<text>Niles Crane (born 1957) is a fictional character on the American sitcom &quot;Frasier&quot;, a spin-off of the television show &quot;Cheers&quot;. He was portrayed by David Hyde Pierce. Niles is the younger brother of Frasier Crane (played by Kelsey Grammer).

Pierce was hired because &quot;Frasier&quot; producers saw his headshot and commented on how much he looked like a young Grammer. Unlike Frasier, part of whose background comes from &quot;Cheers&quot;, Niles&#x27;s background is established over the course of &quot;Frasier&quot;.

Pierce has said that his character was originally explained to him as &quot;what Frasier would be if he had never gone to Boston and never been exposed to the people at Cheers.&quot; Anita Gates of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote in 1998 that &quot;the difference between the brothers is that Frasier knows they&#x27;re being pretentious; Niles honestly doesn&#x27;t&quot;.

== Background ==
Niles was born in Seattle, Washington, in 1957–1959 (depending on different timelines), to Hester Crane, a psychiatrist, and Martin Crane, a police officer. Like his older brother Frasier, Niles was named for one of his mother&#x27;s lab rats. Also like Frasier, Niles was an unusually sensitive child and a frequent target for bullies. As a result, he was quite close to his older brother, and at the same time fiercely competitive with him. Like Frasier, Niles prefers fine arts, music, and intellectual pursuits to physical activities like sports. He is also an established philanthropist.

After attending the private Bryce Academy with Frasier, Niles&#x27;s success in school led to matriculation at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut, as an undergraduate, where he was a member of Phi Beta Kappa, and studied for a year at the University of Cambridge in Cambridge, England as a graduate student. According to the Season 2 episode &quot;The Club&quot;, at some point during his young adulthood when Richard Nixon was campaigning for president, he was arrested for &quot;mooning&quot; Nixon, which according to Niles was a result of him being &quot;young and firm and in love with an anarchist&quot;.

Niles describes his profession as &quot;the saving grace of my life&quot;, and is greatly respected professionally. He specializes in marriage and family therapy. (While substituting for his brother on the radio Niles says, &quot;While Frasier is a Freudian, I am a Jungian. So there&#x27;ll be no blaming mother today!&quot;) Niles is an authority on clinical psychosis, has had his research published in several psychiatric journals, serves on the board of the American Psychiatric Association, and four of his patients have been elected to political office.

Niles often compares his own career to that of his brother, and early in Frasier&#x27;s career as a talk show host makes frequent jokes about the &quot;fast-food approach to psychiatry&quot; that Frasier practices through his radio show. Niles sometimes admits, however, that he envies how his &quot;big shot radio host&quot; brother is well-known, Frasier&#x27;s face appears on &quot;the side of buses&quot;, and he helps many &quot;people who need it&quot;, while no one appreciates his own work.

==Personality==

Niles, like Frasier, is haughty, snobby and fussy, has gourmet tastes, and was described by an interviewer at the &quot;Seattle Post-Intelligencer&quot; as obsessive-compulsive. He frequently wears double breasted suits and Trafalgar limited-edition suspenders. Although Frasier also plays the piano, when they make music together Niles plays while Frasier sings. He is an admirer of the fine arts including opera, theatre, and classical music, drinks fine wine, and enjoys French cuisine which he himself cooks, and frequently obsesses about knowing the right people and climbing the social ladder. At Cafe Nervosa, the coffee house he frequents with Frasier and other friends and family members, Niles&#x27;s usual is a latte with a &quot;whisper&quot; of cinnamon, and occasionally chocolate shavings or nutmeg. According to Daphne, he would &quot;eat a worm if [she] gave it a French name,&quot; while Frasier at one point says, &quot;I&#x27;m a teamster compared to you!&quot;

Also like his brother, Niles is highly intelligent. His IQ is 156, well over the Mensa threshold, and much higher than Frasier&#x27;s (129). Unlike Frasier, however, Niles has a long list of phobias and medical conditions, many of which are clearly psychosomatic. Most prominently, he is quite mysophobic, given to wiping his hands after human contact and wiping down chairs in public places before sitting on them; it is revealed in one episode that the root of this is a babysitter (Ronee Lawrence) who told him scary stories about earwigs that would crawl in through his ears and eat his brains, and lay their eggs on furniture. (When he tells this and other contamination horror stories to a group of fourth-graders, they think he is wonderful for knowing such &quot;cool&quot; facts.) His nose begins to bleed whenever he tells a lie or acts against his code of ethics, and he faints at the sight of his own blood. When extremely stressed, Niles is prone to panic attacks and fits of hyperventilation. On more than one occasion, he&#x27;s fainted. In one episode, he discloses that stress makes him want to hide under a piano. While divorcing his wife Maris Crane, he suffers from stress-induced narcolepsy.

Physically weak and very uncoordinated, Niles is seemingly hopeless at sports and video games, barely able to catch objects even after simple throws (unless Daphne, or occasionally Martin, is doing the throwing; then he is remarkably nimble). However, in some episodes he is shown to be fair at basketball. On one occasion, while attending a basketball game, he is invited onto the floor to attempt a shot from half-court; he makes the basket, astonishing himself, Frasier, and Martin, and earns the temporary nickname &quot;Half-Court Crane.&quot; The brothers are often seen coming or going to squash matches, though Martin once commented in disbelief, &quot;You &quot;have&quot; to wonder what goes on at that squash court!&quot; Accompanying Martin on the shooting range one day, Niles discovers that he is an excellent marksman. He is a fair fencer, and has had some lessons in kickboxing. On other occasions he has expressed interest in lifting weights and taking karate lessons, but these ventures are typically laughed at by his father and brother and often amount to nothing. He is also a master speller, having come close to winning the national spelling competition as a youth and spell-checking the graffiti in a bathroom stall at a local coffee bar with a red marker.

When Niles suffers a walking heart attack, he is not aware of it for several days, because he experiences referred pain and believes he has a toothache. After a dental checkup finds nothing wrong, Frasier&#x27;s producer Roz Doyle tells him that it is probably a sinus infection, but he considers the remote chance that the problem may be his heart. When a number of extremely unlikely events occur to or around him, he consults a doctor and immediately enters a hospital for surgery.

Niles drives originally a Mercedes-Benz E320 with the license plate 5HR1NK, while Frasier drives BMW models. However, following his costly divorce from Maris, his Mercedes is repossessed and he has to drive a Geo Metro hatchback that he&#x27;s embarrassed to drive and refuses to let Frasier see him drive it. After he begins a relationship with Daphne, he begins driving a newer-model Mercedes-Benz E55 AMG. Near the end of the series, he upgrades into a newer-model E500.

==Role in the series==
Niles is Frasier&#x27;s constant companion and rival. The tensions between the brothers began during childhood; Frasier resented the younger Niles distracting their mother from paying attention to him, and Niles disliked the older Frasier reaching career and life milestones first. Nonetheless, they meet every day at Cafe Nervosa, where they discuss their lives and various other topics, with both siblings relying on each other for advice. Niles and Frasier often collaborate on projects, which frequently and comically lead to complete disaster. Some examples are the book—ironically, about sibling rivalry—that they attempt to write, the restaurant they purchase and attempt to transform into an exclusive eatery, and Frasier&#x27;s brief period in private practice next door to Niles&#x27;s office.
David Hyde Pierce said that &quot;Niles is Frasier, if Frasier had never left Seattle&quot;.

===Relationships===
His romantic life – which is plagued by misfortune – is another area explored throughout the series. Niles&#x27;s first wife is Maris Crane, the haughty, anorexic daughter of a wealthy Seattle family, who is never seen on the show, despite being referred to in nearly every episode during his relationship with her. Season 1 references that Niles married for money. Similar to Niles, Maris has a long list of allergies, being allergic to most meats, spices, creams and more. She also has lots of pills and medication which usually have comical side effects such as extreme narcolepsy. Despite being predominantly an anorexic, in one episode she is shown to be eating loads of doughnuts and growing vastly in weight. Maris demonstrates her extremely paranoid and controlling nature throughout the series. Her lack of respect and affection for Niles leads to separation, followed by serving Niles with divorce papers as a bluff; when Niles signed them she was shaken and agreed to couples counseling. However, after appearing to make progress, Niles discovers Maris is having an affair with their couples&#x27; therapist, Dr. Shenkman, ultimately leading to him making the second and final decision for divorce. Maris attempts to reconcile with him by sending him expensive gifts, but Niles remains steadfast in his decision for divorce and Maris responds by shredding their financial settlement document – she turns it into the wrapping paper for her final gift to Niles – a five-cent piece in a jeweler&#x27;s box along with the poem &#x27;Roses are red, your heart is fickle, when I&#x27;m through with you, all you&#x27;ll have is this nickel&#x27; – and proceeds to nearly bankrupt Niles. He is forced to sublet his suite at the Montana and move into the low-rent Shangri-La; while it is far below his usual standard of living, he realizes it is the price he must pay for being free of Maris. After hiring divorce attorney Donny Douglas to end the bitter, drawn-out process, she finally agrees on a settlement when he threatens to expose that her family&#x27;s wealth is not in timber lands but in urinal cakes. A running gag involves Niles speaking affectionately about Maris, despite her poor treatment of him. Despite her physical and mental handicaps, Maris is revealed to be quite good in bed when &quot;properly motivated,&quot; as Niles mentions in Season 2 in the episode &quot;Daphne&#x27;s Room&quot;, after Niles buys her a Mercedes as a birthday present.

Niles&#x27;s most significant relationship on the show is with Daphne Moon, his father&#x27;s physical therapist, perhaps an unlikely attraction given the significant differences in their tastes, temperament and social standing (he at one point refers to her as a &quot;working-class Venus&quot;). His infatuation for her begins the moment they meet. For numerous reasons during the first six seasons of the show, however, Niles is unable to confess his feelings for Daphne, who remains unaware of his love for her (despite her professed psychic abilities).

After divorcing Maris, Niles becomes involved with Mel Karnofsky, Maris&#x27; plastic surgeon; despite being more compatible than his ex-wife, Frasier nonetheless can see Mel&#x27;s true colors in her subtle yet masterful manipulation of Niles&#x27;s affections towards her. The two elope after dating less than six months, but the marriage falls apart after only two days when Niles finally confesses his love for Daphne. His confession occurs the night before her wedding to Donny. The relationship spawns a huge ordeal, prompting Donny to respond by suing both Daphne and Frasier, while Mel forces Niles to participate in a prolonged charade of a happy marriage for the sake of appearances. He goes along with it until he finally loses his temper and shouts out the truth during an important dinner party – that his marriage to Mel is a sham and he refuses to put Daphne through the torture of hiding their love any longer.

Niles&#x27;s feelings for Daphne are the basis for many gags on the show, including the numerous ways he demonstrates how besotted he is with her (such as being entranced by the smell of her hair or staring at her rear end when she bends over), but develops over the course of the series into an important plot line.

Niles is frequently jealous of Daphne&#x27;s boyfriends (and even his own nephew, Frederick, who nurses a crush on Daphne as a pre-adolescent). Niles does tell Frasier repeatedly that he is over Daphne when she accepts Donny Douglas&#x27; proposal of marriage, and proceeds to marry Mel in a kind of rebound, but admits that he still loves Daphne on the eve of her wedding, Frasier tells him that Daphne knows of Niles&#x27;s feelings and reciprocates them. When the two do attempt a relationship, they must reconcile their many lifestyle differences. Fortunately, in the end the couple finds compatibility, and many of Niles&#x27;s nervous eccentricities diminish as he finally manages to maintain a stable relationship.

After Niles and Daphne begin dating, this high degree of infatuation was used to incorporate Jane Leeves&#x27; real-life pregnancy and weight gain. Daphne feels pressured to live up to the &#x27;perfect&#x27; image Niles had imagined; she responds by overeating and gains 60 pounds. Leeves&#x27; maternity leave was written into the show in an arc where Daphne reaches her breaking point and realizes she needs help for her weight problems, so Niles sends her to a health spa where she can lose weight and receive counseling. However, her therapist at the spa told Daphne that her overeating was due to her attempting to live up to Niles&#x27;s &quot;perfect image&quot;, and Frasier points out to Niles that he may not have been in love &quot;with&quot; Daphne, but &quot;at&quot; Daphne, focusing only on her virtues and ignoring all her flaws. Niles and Daphne then end up insulting each other about their flaws, ending with them kissing passionately.

Ultimately Niles and Daphne are together one year before Niles proposes in the ninth season. The two leave to elope in Reno, Nevada at the end of season 9, after Niles tries to reconcile Daphne&#x27;s mother and father. His plan ends in failure, leaving Daphne in doubt about married life, since her mother and father&#x27;s marriage ended after 40 years together. However, Daphne&#x27;s father reveals that no matter how many times he tried to get rid of Niles from his pub, Niles kept coming back until he finally agreed to come back to America with him all in an effort to make Daphne happy; an extreme act of love that he himself (Daphne&#x27;s father) never did for her mother. With the sudden realization that Niles&#x27;s love runs so deep that when he says he&#x27;d do anything for her, he literally means it, Daphne goes over to Niles&#x27;s apartment in the spur of the moment and demands he marry her right then and there, saying, &quot;Because you&#x27;d do anything, even put up with my insane family to make me happy. Because you traveled half way around the world to make my dreams come true, even the impossible ones. And because I can&#x27;t spend one more second without being your wife, Niles Crane, because I adore you.&quot; The two then leave in the night to go and find a place to wed.

The series ends two years into their marriage with the birth of their son, David, who is born at a veterinary clinic. A flash-forward scene in an earlier episode reveals that the couple will have two daughters.

His final line in the series, which he says to Frasier as his brother leaves Seattle, is &quot;I&#x27;ll miss the coffees.&quot; Whilst he hasn&#x27;t appeared in the revival series, he and Frasier briefly share a phone call during Frasier&#x27;s ill-fated lavish Christmas party. In a later episode, it is revealed that Niles and Daphne now live in Sedona, Arizona, where they have purchased a vineyard.

<doc id="460544" wikidata="Q1049540" url="?curid=460544" title="Local government in Northern Ireland">
<text>Local government in Northern Ireland is divided among 11 single-tier districts known as &#x27;Local Government Districts&#x27; (abbreviated LGDs) and formerly known as district council areas (DCAs). Councils in Northern Ireland do not carry out the same range of functions as those in the rest of the United Kingdom; for example they have no responsibility for education, road-building or housing (although they do nominate members to the advisory Northern Ireland Housing Council). Their 
functions include planning, waste and recycling services, leisure and community services, building control and local economic and cultural development. The collection of rates is handled centrally by the Land and Property Services agency of the Northern Ireland Executive.

== Local Government Districts (2015-present) ==
=== Local Government Districts (2012) ===
The 11 districts first had their boundaries determined in 2012. Elections were held to the new councils in 2014, and they assumed the powers of the previous councils in 2015. Basic geographical statistics are shown below. Previously (between 1972 and 2015) the country was divided into 26 smaller districts.

=== District Electoral Areas (2012) ===
Each of the 11 councils is divided into 7 District Electoral Areas (DEAs), with the exception of Belfast, which has 10 DEAs. Each DEA, in turn, is made up of 5, 6 or 7 wards, with the number of councillors for each DEA equal to the number of wards.

There are 80 DEAs in Northern Ireland in total, and the current DEA boundaries were finalised in 2012, and first used in the 2014 election, with the new councils coming into operation in May 2015. Prior to this, the 1993 election was the last time local government boundaries had been redrawn - between 1993 and 2011, there were 102 DEAs across the old 26 councils, with each council having between 3 and 9 DEAs each.

By definition, DEAs nest exactly within the 11 Local Government Districts. However, they do not nest within the parliamentary constituencies - for example, the DEAs of Newry, Slieve Gullion and Cusher all fall entirely within the Newry and Armagh constituency, but the Armagh DEA does not - one of its wards, Blackwatertown, falls within the Fermanagh and South Tyrone constituency instead. This means there is no exact comparison of local government election results with Assembly/Westminster results.

However, comparisons are possible between combinations of 2012 DEAs, and combinations of DEAs/LGDs from before 2014. For example, the total election results in the Limavady and Benbradagh DEAs from 2014 can be compared with the results of the whole Limavady borough from 2011, as both cover the same area. Similar comparisons are as follows:

Note that Erne West is the only DEA in Northern Ireland whose boundaries were completely unchanged between 1993 and 2012.

The 80 DEAs are the most granular unit of elected representation, thus providing a more localised indicator of voting preferences than the results in the larger parliamentary constituencies.

Under STV, each DEA is a multi-member district, electing 5, 6 or 7 councillors, with all councillors representing the entire DEA. Wards do not have elected representation in their own right, and no election results at ward level are officially recorded or published, besides turnout levels at individual polling stations.

The below map shows each DEA numbered, with the 2012 Local Government Districts in bold. The inset map shows DEAs in the districts of Antrim and Newtownabbey, Ards and North Down, Belfast, and Lisburn and Castlereagh.


=== Electoral Wards (2012) ===
Electoral wards are the basic unit of Northern Ireland&#x27;s political geography. Since at least 1973, every local government boundary commission has involved the drawing of ward boundaries, then the grouping of wards into DEAs, such that a DEA has one councillor for each ward it has. Likewise, parliamentary constituencies (and thus, Assembly constituencies) are always made up of combinations of electoral wards. 

Electoral wards are also used in allocating funding, such as for urban regeneration programmes under the Neighbourhood Renewal Strategy.


===Composition of district councils===

This table shows number of councillors by party, election, and district, based on the three local elections that have occurred since local government reform in 2014-15.

This table does not reflect any notional changes between the 2011 election and the 2014 election. &#x27;Minor Nat.&#x27; includes independent nationalists and Aontú. &#x27;Minor Un.&#x27; includes independent unionists, NI21 and UKIP. &#x27;Minor Other&#x27; includes other independents and Labour Alternative.

== Local Government Districts (1973-2015) ==

=== Local Government Districts (1973) ===
The previous set of 26 councils, which preceded the current set of 11 councils, are shown on the below map. They had 583 wards in total - meaning 583 councillors, representing 102 District Electoral Areas.


== History ==

The current pattern of 11 local government districts was established on 1 April 2015, as a result of the reform process that started in 2005.

The previous pattern of local government in Northern Ireland, with 26 councils, was established in 1973 by the Local Government (Boundaries) Act (Northern Ireland) 1971 and the Local Government Act (Northern Ireland) 1972 to replace the previous system established by the Local Government (Ireland) Act 1898. The system was based on the recommendations of the Macrory Report, of June 1970, which presupposed the continued existence of the Government of Northern Ireland to act as a regional-level authority.

From 1921 to 1973, Northern Ireland was divided into six administrative counties (subdivided into urban and rural districts) and two county boroughs. The counties and county boroughs continue to exist for the purposes of lieutenancy and shrievalty. This system, with the abolition of rural districts, remains the model for local government in the Republic of Ireland. (See also List of rural and urban districts in Northern Ireland for more details)

==Elections==
Councillors are elected for a four-year term of office under the single transferable vote (STV) system. Elections were last held on 18 May 2023. To qualify for election, a councillor candidate must be:
* at least 18 years of age, and
* a Commonwealth of Nations or European Union citizen
In addition, they must either:
* be a local elector for the district, or
* have, during the whole of the 12-month period prior to the election, either owned or occupied land in the district, or else resided or worked in the district
The results of the three elections held since the introduction of the 11 new districts in 2014-15 are as follows.

== Combinations ==
The districts are combined for various purposes.

=== Eurostat NUTS level 3 ===
In the Eurostat Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics (NUTS), Northern Ireland is divided into five parts at level 3

=== Former education and library boards ===
There were five education and library boards (ELBs) in Northern Ireland.

As part of the Review of Public Administration process, the library functions of the ELBs were taken over by a new body, the Northern Ireland Library Authority (branded Libraries NI) in April 2009.

The education and skills functions were centralised into a single Education Authority for Northern Ireland in April 2015.

The boards were as follows:

=== Former health and social services boards ===
There were four health and social services boards which were replaced by a single Health and Social Care Board in April 2009.

The former health and social services boards were as follows:

== Reform ==
In June 2002, the Northern Ireland Executive established a Review of Public Administration to review the arrangements for the accountability, development, administration and delivery of public services. Among its recommendations were a reduction in the number of districts. In 2005 Peter Hain, the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, announced proposals to reduce the number of councils to seven. The names and boundaries of the seven districts were announced in March 2007. In March 2008 the restored Northern Executive agreed to create eleven new councils instead of the original seven. The first elections were due to take place in May 2011. However, by May 2010 disagreements among parties in the executive over district boundaries were expected to delay the reforms until 2015. In June 2010 the proposed reforms were abandoned following the failure of the Northern Ireland Executive to reach agreement. However, on 12 March 2012, the Northern Ireland Executive published its programme for government, which included a commitment to reduce the number of councils in Northern Ireland to 11.

<doc id="460547" wikidata="Q113535566" url="?curid=460547" title="Flibbertigibbet">
<text>Flibbertigibbet is a Middle English word referring to a flighty or whimsical person, usually a young woman. In modern use, it is used as a slang term, especially in Yorkshire, for a gossipy or overly talkative person.

==Etymology==
Its origin may lie in a meaningless representation of chattering.

==In literature and culture==
This word also has a historical use as a name for a fiend, devil, or spirit. In the 15th-century English morality play &quot;The Castle of Perseverance&quot;, the Bad Angel addresses the vice figure Detraccio (also called Backbiter and the messenger of the World) as &quot;Flyprgebet&quot; (line 1724). In William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;King Lear&quot; (IV, i (1605)), he is one of the five fiends that Edgar claimed was possessing him, this one in the posture of beggar Tom o&#x27; Bedlam. Shakespeare got the name from Samuel Harsnett&#x27;s &quot;Declaration of Egregious Popish Impostures&quot; (1603), where one reads of 40 fiends that Jesuits cast out and among which was Fliberdigibbet, described as one of &quot;&quot;foure deuils&quot; of the round, or Morrice, whom &quot;Sara&quot; in her fits, tuned together, in measure and sweet ucadence.&quot;

It has been used by extension as a synonym for Puck. It is also used as a nickname for a character in Sir Walter Scott&#x27;s &quot;Kenilworth&quot;, and has gained the meaning of an impish child. Victor Hugo made a 1828 theatrical adaptation of the novel &quot;Kenilworth&quot; titled &quot;Amy Robsart&quot;, where Flibbertigibet is one of the main characters in the story.

Flibbertigibbet similarly is featured as a name in a local legend about Wayland&#x27;s Smithy. According to the tale, Flibbertigibbet was apprentice to Wayland the Smith and greatly exasperated his master. Eventually, Wayland threw Flibbertigibbet down the hill and into a valley, where he was transformed into a stone. Scott associates his Flibbertigibbet character in &quot;Kenilworth&quot; with Wayland Smith.

In 1942, author Roald Dahl wrote his first children&#x27;s novel, &quot;The Gremlins,&quot; in which Gremlins were tiny men who lived on RAF fighters. In the same novel, Dahl called the wives of gremlins &quot;Fifinellas&quot;, their male children &quot;Widgets&quot;, and their female children &quot;Flibbertigibbets&quot;.

The nuns describe free-spirited Sister Maria as, “A flibbertigibbet! A will-o’-the wisp! A clown!” in the show tune “Maria” from the 1959 Broadway musical &#x27;:The Sound of Music&quot; by Rodgers and Hammerstein, and in the subsequent 1965 movie.

In the 1969 book &quot;Slaughterhouse-Five&quot; by Kurt Vonnegut, Barbara Pilgrim, the daughter of the protagonist, is described as a &quot;bitchy flibbertigibbet.&quot;

In the 1990 American romantic comedy film &quot;Joe Versus the Volcano&quot;, Meg Ryan&#x27;s character Angelica refers to herself as a flibbertigibbet.

In the 2011 book Ready Player One, Art3mis, a famous female gunter and blogger, refers to herself as a Flibbertigibbet upon meeting the protagonist.

In 2018 British Author Chris Redmile released a children&#x27;s book titled &quot;The Flibber-ti-gibbet&quot;, a read in rhyme book designed to educate children about the traits of ADHD.

In 2022 British politician Lord Cormack referred to Michael Gove as a &quot;Flibbertigibbet&quot; following disputes over the relocation of the House of Lords.

<text>Giovanni Cesari (25 June 1843 – 10 March 1904) was an Italian singer with a &quot;soprano acuto&quot;, or high soprano voice.

Together with Alessandro Moreschi, Domenico Salvatori and Domenico Mustafà, Cesari was a famous castrato singer of the late 19th century. Born in the town of Frosinone, he was dropped off at an orphanage in 1852 by his parents. Here he started his musical education under the direction of Gaetano Capocci, financed by the Sistine Chapel. He was then admitted, upon completing his studies, as a soprano to the Sistine Chapel Choir at the age of 17 in 1861. Cesari was overall a remarkable soprano, and although he possessed a veiled voice, he was a master of song with an optimal intonation and an exquisite trill.

In addition to being a soprano at the Sistine Chapel Choir, he was also director of sacred music at several churches of Rome (Santa Lucia al Gonfalone, Santo Spirito in Sassia, etc.), and he used to arrange concerts in Rome. In 1896 he was promoted to vice-director of the Cappella, sometimes substituting for the older maestro Domenico Mustafà. He died prematurely in Rome in 1904.

His voice can be heard, rather faintly, together with those of the other choristers on the Sistine Chapel recordings made by Fred Gaisberg in 1902.

<text>The River Rother, a waterway in the northern midlands of England, gives its name to the town of Rotherham and to the Rother Valley parliamentary constituency. It rises in Pilsley in Derbyshire and flows in a generally northwards direction through the centre of Chesterfield, where it feeds the Chesterfield Canal, and on through the Rother Valley Country Park and several districts of Sheffield before joining the River Don at Rotherham in Yorkshire. Historically, it powered mills, mainly corn or flour mills, but most had ceased to operate by the early 20th century, and few of the mill buildings survive.

From the 1880s, the water quality deteriorated rapidly, as a result of coal mining and its associated communities. The river became unable to sustain life, and by 1974, was the most polluted of the rivers within the River Don catchment. The pollutants came from coking plants, from inefficient sewage treatment plants, and from the manufacture of chemicals. Major investment in upgrading the sewage treatment works took place, and in the treatment of industrial effluent before it was discharged to the river. The closure of the main coking plants has also aided the recovery of the river, and enabled restocking with fish to begin in 1994. By 1996, there was evidence for self-sustaining fish populations, and that the river could support organised angling.

A short section of the river in Chesterfield was once navigable, and may become so again as part of a development project, while there are plans to use the course from Rother Valley Country Park to Rotherham for the Rother Link, which would connect the Chesterfield Canal to the River Don Navigation. The lower river is managed because of flood risk: three regulators can restrict its flow. Their operation normally causes flooding of washlands, rather than of centres of population, which might otherwise be inundated.

==Etymology==

The second element of the name &#x27;Rother&#x27; is the Common Brittonic &quot;-duβr&quot;, meaning &#x27;water&#x27; (Welsh &quot;dwfr&quot;). The first element could be &quot;rö-&quot;, an intensive Brittonic prefix meaning &#x27;great&#x27;, or &quot;rūδ&quot;, &#x27;red, reddish-brown&#x27;.

==Course==
The source of the river is at Pilsley near Clay Cross in Derbyshire, from where it flows to the west for a short distance, before turning to the north. The valley is shared with the Derby to Rotherham Railway, which makes the first two of a total of 20 crossings before the river reaches the eastern edges of Danesmoor. It is joined by another stream before passing to the west of North Wingfield, after which the Red Lead Mill Brook joins from the west. Before reaching Chesterfield, Birdholme Brook joins it from the west at Birdholme, Calow Brook joins from the east at Hady, and the River Hipper joins it on the southern edge of the town.

Within Chesterfield, the river was navigable, as the Chesterfield Canal joined the river and used it to access basins on the western bank. The first basin was connected to the river near Wharf Lane footbridge, but the coming of the railway severed the link, and a new basin was constructed to the north of the Brimington Road bridge in 1890. The canal company were not authorised by their Act of Parliament to use the river, but did so despite that. This stretch of the river forms part of a £300 million redevelopment project called Chesterfield Waterside, which will provide housing and amenities in an area which is currently derelict land. The project involves the creation of a short length of new canal to create an island in the centre of the site. A new basin has been constructed near the site of the 1890 basin, although it has not yet been connected to the river. Outline planning permission for the whole site was granted on 15 March 2010.

===Below Chesterfield===
Between Chesterfield and Tapton, the river flows over a large weir while the canal is protected from flooding by a flood gate. The two waterways remain close as they flow northwards between New Whittington and Brimington, where the River Drone joins from the west. At Old Whittington both turn to the east, before turning north again at Staveley. Just before Renishaw, the river passes Slittingmill Farm, once the site of a slitting mill constructed by George Sitwell in the 1650s, used to split iron bars from his furnaces into thin strips for the production of nails, and the first to be constructed in the East Midlands. After the River Doe Lea joins the Rother from the east, the river is crossed by a grade II listed two-arched bridge built around 1840 by the North Midland Railway, which carries a minor road to the golf course.

It continues to the east of Eckington and the west of Killamarsh, to arrive at the Rother Valley Country Park, where the course is largely man-made, as the park is part of a flood-defence scheme. The river was diverted to run close to the railway to the west while 1.7 million tonnes of coal from the reserves under the park were removed by open cast mining between 1976 and 1981. The channel was then rebuilt once mining had ceased and the pit had been filled in. The visitor centre uses a part of Bedgreave Mill, which was originally constructed around 1100, and is one of the first mills known to have been built on the River Don and its tributaries. 

To the north of the site, the river powered Beighton Mill, which produced flour. The tail race, known as Beighton Mill Tail Goit, forms a separate channel to the east of the main channel for around . Brookhouse Colliery, which was operational between 1929 and 1985, was located on the east bank of the tail goit, and the Pigeon Bridge Brook weaved its way through the site, passing under the railway tracks to join the tail goit. As the site developed, sections of it were culverted, and after the pit closed, the site became the Pit House West Opencast Site between 1989 and 1994. 300,000 tonnes of coal were obtained by reworking the spoil heaps from Brookhouse Colliery, and a further 1.2 million tonnes were obtained by opencast mining of the nine seams below the surface. Once extraction was completed, another year was spent landscaping the site. This included opening up the Pigeon Bridge Brook, constructing a series of ponds along its course to create a wetland habitat for wildlife, and re-routing the final section of the brook so that it joins the Rother further upstream, opposite the main lake of the Rother Valley Country Park. A significant proportion of the colliery site has been planted with trees, as part of the South Yorkshire Community Forest.

Beighton Mill Tail Goit is sufficiently large that it was designated as a main river by the Environment Agency. In 2015, they proposed that it should no longer be designated as such, although the main channel of the Rother would remain a main river. The move would transfer the responsibility for the tail goit from the Environment Agency to Rotherham Metropolitan Borough Council, who would then include it in their flood risk management plans. Continuing northwards, the river passes through the Sheffield districts of Beighton and Woodhouse, followed by the Rotherham districts of Catcliffe and Treeton, flowing on to its confluence with the River Don at Ickles, Rotherham.

Some sections of the river were highly polluted, so much so that when the Rother Valley Country Park was being created around the section north of Killamarsh and east of Beighton, cleaner water was brought in from The Moss to feed the park&#x27;s lakes. The recent closures of industry and the work of the Environment Agency has improved the quality of the river Rother. The watercourse now holds a good head of coarse fish, and angling clubs are springing up along its length. Members of Ashfield Angling Club, which has fishing rights on the river near Orgreave, regularly catch chub, roach, barbel, and pike.

The planned Rother Link canal will use part of the river to connect the Sheffield and South Yorkshire Navigation to the Chesterfield Canal.

==Milling==
Historically, the river has been used to power a number of mills, although little remains at most of the sites. The furthest upstream was Whitebank Mill, to the south-west of Spital. It was a corn mill in 1881, but the site was marked as Whitebank Yard by 1898. Spital Mills was a little further north, below the confluence with the Spital Brook and above the River Hipper. In the late 19th century, it was a tobacco mill, and was later known as Mason&#x27;s Cigarette Works, but by 1918 cabinets were being manufactured there. The three-storey mill building has survived, and is now used by Spital Tile Company. To the east of Chesterfield railway station, there were two weirs and a second channel with sluices at both ends, but no sign of a mill building by 1881. Wheeldon Mill was located to the east of Whittington Moor, and was a flour mill in 1885. However, by 1898, the Great Central Railway&#x27;s Chesterfield Loop line to Chesterfield Central railway station had been built through the site, and the main channel of the river had been moved to the west of the railway, to save the need for two bridges. Its name is retained in Wheeldonmill Lock on the Chesterfield Canal.

To the west of Staveley was Staveley Mill. It was a flour mill in 1885 and a corn mill in 1898. It was still in use in 1919, but by 1938, the river had been diverted along the course of the mill leat, and the main channel closed, to accommodate the ever-increasing railway sidings associated with Staveley Works. George Sitwell&#x27;s slitting mill was located on the road from Eckington to Staveley, and was operational from around the 1620s. A weir fed water into the goit, a long channel which ran to the west of the main river to power the mill, while the main channel eventually ran to the east of the Midland Railway&#x27;s North Midland Branch. The tail race from the mill continued northwards to the west of the railway, passing under the railway tracks serving Renishaw Park Collieries, rejoining the main river after it crossed back under the railway. Much of the tail goit, downstream of Slittingmill Farm, still holds water. Renishaw Mill was a flour mill, situated between the former Eckington railway station and the junction of the Smithy Brook with the Rother. A mill was recorded here in 1650, when there were two grist mills under a single roof. The weir and the head race had been removed by 1898.

Chapel Wheel was to the east of the river near Eckington, and was probably fed by Park Brook. However, a map of 1814 appears to show that the mill pond was filled with water taken from the Chesterfield Canal. Its name would suggest that it was used for grinding metal, but by 1898, the channel from the canal had been removed, as had the buildings below the dam. The outflow from Chapelwheel Dam flowed under the railway line to reach the right bank of the Rother. To the west of Netherthorpe, there was a corn mill in the 18th century. The Lord of the Manor for Killamarsh, Sacheverell Pole, sold it to William Cooper of Sheffield in 1795, and Cooper worked with an ironfounder called John Harrison to create an ironworks. They sold it to Joseph Butler in 1800, who built a forge and rolling mill on the site. Butler produced chains, spades and shovels. It was sold again in 1829 to Sir George Sitwell, who then leased it to Joseph Webster. At that time it included several crucible melting furnaces, a cementation furnace and tilt hammers which were water-powered. Webster improved the facilities, to enable him to produce high quality steel wire, used to make cables, hawsers and rigging for ships. In 1831 Webster obtained steam engines to power his rolling mills, and the forge was in operation until 1887. After that, wire continued to be made, and probably metal pipes were added to the output of the works. The original buildings have since been demolished, and modern buildings erected.

Bedgreave Mill was a corn mill and is now part of the visitor centre at Rother Valley Country Park. Two buildings survive, the first dating from the 16th or 17th century. A mill was recorded at Bedgreave, or Betgreave on early maps, in 1631, but the present building is enigmatic. It appears to date from the post-medieval period, but in concept is a medieval single-celled mill. The millstones were arranged on a platform at one end of the building, and the water wheel was below them. Very few mills with this arrangement survive. The second building dates from the mid to late 18th century. A new mill pond was mentioned in 1768, and this may have been the time at which the mill was constructed. It was a water-powered corn mill, but was converted to a steam-powered mill in 1886, after water from the mill leat was found to be leaking into nearby mines. The engine was housed in a single storey engine house. It remained in commercial operation producing animal fodder until 1947. It was restored in 1982 as part of the visitor centre, and retains much of its milling equipment, which can be seen by visitors to the park.

Beighton Mill was located to the north of Rother Valley Country Park. A second channel meanders northwards to the east of the main river, which is called Beighton Mill Tail Goit, although it is not obvious that water would have discharged into it after powering the mill. It was a corn mill in 1877 and 1898, by which time there was a large paper mill immediately to the north of it, served by its own railway siding. The paper mill was built in the 1880s, and was operational until 1926, but the corn mill building had been demolished by 1905. Woodhouse Mill Forge was a corn mill in the 17th and 18th centuries, but subsequently became a forge, producing spades until at least 1956. It was still identified on the 1975 map, but by that time the river had been diverted further to the west. Treeton Mill was a corn mill to the east of the river. A large weir fed water into a long mill pond, and the mill buildings were close to Mill Lane. Mill Goit carried the used water away, and rejoined the river on the southern edge of Catcliffe. The mill was disused in 1905, and only a row of mill cottages were identified in 1923. The main river channel had been moved eastwards and straightened by 1957, to accommodate railway sidings associated with Orgreave Colliery.

Canklow Corn Mill was fed by a long channel called Canklow Goit, diverging from the river close to where it is now crossed by the M1 motorway. The mill pond was also fed by the water from Ulley Brook and Whiston Brook. The mill was marked as disused in 1892, but not so in 1903. By 1923, the river channels had been altered, the mill building was gone, and parts of Canklow Goit had been filled in. The final mill on the river was Town Mill in Rotherham, located next to the Rotherham Old Brewery. It was a corn mill in 1893. It was a roller mill, originally water powered, but later powered by electricity. It was bought by Hovis in the 1950s but was destroyed by fire in 1963. It was rebuilt, continuing to operate until 2008, after which it was demolished.

==Flood defences==

The River Rother is managed by the Environment Agency to mitigate flooding in the Catcliffe and Rotherham areas, through a series of regulators and washlands. The regulators are used to hold back the flow of the river, and the washlands consist of low-lying land adjacent to the river which flood when the flows are held back. This allows flood flows on the River Don to pass through Rotherham before the water from the Rother does so. There are three regulators, at Canklow, Woodhouse Mill and Meadowgate.

Prior to 1958, flooding was a persistent problem near the lower reaches of the river, with Beighton, Catcliffe, Treeton and Woodhouse Mill particularly at risk. When the River Rother Improvement Scheme was first proposed in September 1958, analysis of flood flows revealed that peak flows on the Rother generally reached the River Don at Rotherham after the peak flow on that river had already passed. Enlarging the channel of the Rother would have resulted in the peak flows reaching the Don earlier, effectively moving the problem of flooding downstream to Rotherham. The scheme therefore recognised the need to create and manage washlands to hold back the excess flow under these conditions.

===Regulators===
The first regulator to be installed was at Woodhouse Mill. It is a vertical sluice gate, and is situated at the downstream end of the Woodhouse Mill washlands nature reserve. A railway embankment crosses the nature reserve, and flood arches allow the water to flood both sides of the tracks. There are no floodbanks between the river and the reserve, which results in it flooding soon after the gate is closed. The mechanism here was manufactured by Ransomes and Rapier in 1956, and the regulator was commissioned in 1959. The Canklow regulator, situated close to the A630 link road from junction 33 on the M1 motorway, is also a vertical sluice gate, which when closed causes progressive flooding of seven washland areas on both sides of the M1, capable of holding of flood water. It was installed in 1969 as part of a major road-building project, which saw the M1 motorway and the A630 road built across the washlands.

The third regulator is at Meadowgate, within the boundaries of the Rother Valley Country Park. This provides an additional of storage capacity. and its operation results in progressive flooding of the Meadowgate Lake, the Nethermoor Lake and the main lakes. Levels within the park were carefully designed to allow it to flood in this way, and there are a number of sluices and flap gates so that stored water can be released back to the river in a controlled fashion. The regulator is of a different design to the other two, as the gate is located on the bed of the river, and rotates upwards as required. During a flood event, the Canklow regultor normally closes first, based on levels elsewhere within the Rother catchment, with the other two closing later on.

===Floods===
The Meadowgate regulator was operated in 2000, resulting in the Meadowgate and Nethermoor lake flooding, but water levels remained around below the level at which the main lakes would flood.

The severe floods of 2007 were the result of some 80,000 megalitres of rainfall falling on South Yorkshire on 25 June 2007. The level of the River Rother at Rotherham reached the highest level ever recorded, at , and the regulators were staffed 24 hours a day in order to manage the water. However, there was a power failure at Canklow regulator, and the site had to be evacuated due to the threat posed by the possible breaching of the dam at Ulley Reservoir. The Meadowgate regulator was closed, and resulted in all four of the Rother Valley Country Park lakes flooding within the next 12 hours. Most of the car park and the watersports centre was also flooded, but water levels dropped over the next three days and little damage was caused. Assessment following those floods led the Environment Agency to conclude that the regulators were expensive to maintain, and that they should be removed once some of the flood banks had been remodelled to ensure that the washlands filled and emptied at the correct levels in a flood cycle.
However, by 2023 The Environment Agency had decided that the regulators should be refurbished, and the contract was awarded to JBA Bentley. The vertical gate at Canklow, which is raised and lowered by an electrically powered wire rope hoist, will be replaced with a new gate, with the project including new mechanical, electrical, instrumentation, control and automation (MEICA) systems. Some extra civil engineering work is also required, to improve the anchors holding the sheet-piling of the channel in place. A crane pad to allow the new gate to be placed in position, and to help with future maintenance had to be carefully positioned to avoid the high voltage overhead power lines crossing the site. The regulator at Woodhouse is expected to be decommissiomed and replaced with a passive baffle or orifice plate once modelling of the site to determine their effectiveness has been completed.

The fish-bellied tilting gate at Meadowgate in Rother Valley Country Park, which was operated by a hydraulic ram, has been removed, and replaced by a vertical gate similar to that at Canklow. A temporary control room was constructed while the original buildings were demolished and a new control centre built, ensuring that the regulator remained operational for most of the project timescale. The new type of gate has enabled an improved fish pass to be provided in the channel. Because of the high flow rates during flood events, a solution using 80 pre-cast concrete tiles, each and weighing 4 tonnes was adopted. Upstands on the tiles ensure that there is suitable depth and velocity for fish over a wide range of river flows. To enable the work to proceed in the dry, the river was dammed upstream of the regulator and fed through a flume to discharge below the work site. The new regulator was operational from 21 December 2023.

During routine maintenance in August 2024, the gate at Woodhouse regulator failed in the lowered position. Three pumps were installed to pump water around the failed structure, but in November 2024 these were supplemented by four huge syphon pipes, capable of routing four times as much water around the gate. The Environment Agency stated at the time that they were working on a plan to allow the stuck gate to be raised, without damaging the rest of the structure.

==Water quality==
Laman Blanchard, writing in 1836, described the Rother as &quot;a beauteous stream&quot;, and noted that chub, roach and perch were caught by fishermen who fished from its banks. It was also one of the main sources of salmon for the River Don system. The river did not suffer from the worst effects of the industrial revolution until the 1880s, when the development of coal mining on several of its tributaries resulting in a rapid deterioration in water quality. The industry itself discharged minewater to the river, containing large volumes of solids, which were deposited on the river bed, smothering the vegetation. The villages which grew up around the mines often had little or no sewage treatment facilities, and hence sewage found its way into the river. The River Doe Lea, the River Drone and the Pools Brook became lifeless sewers, as did the Rother. Derbyshire County Council obtained a ruling from the Chesterfield County Court in 1905, which required local authorities to stop polluting the river, and gave them three years to construct sewage treatment works. However, the growth in population outstripped the efforts to resolve these issues, and the river continued to deteriorate. One or two of its tributaries were not polluted, and the River Hipper retained stocks of brown trout and grayling.

In 1974, the river was the most heavily polluted of the rivers in the River Don catchment. For most of its course, it was rated &quot;Grade F&quot; on the Environment Agency&#x27;s scale of river quality. This scale ranges from &quot;Grade A&quot;, which indicates that the water quality is very good and the river is unpolluted, to &quot;Grade F&quot;, which indicates that the water quality is bad, and there is little or no life to be found in the water. The main sources of pollution were from coking plants, where coal was carbonised, from discharges from inefficient sewage treatment plants, and from the manufacture of chemicals.

===Industrial pollution===
The catchment area of the river is industrial and urban, and was the location for 48 sewage treatment works, the discharges from which fed into the river. Of these, eleven were deemed to be unsatisfactory in 1974, and a programme of rationalisation and improvement had reduced the number of works to 29 by 1996. Those closed included all of the unsatisfactory ones. Many of the remaining works were small, but the three major ones were located at Old Whittington, Staveley and Woodhouse Mill. Major upgrading of the Old Whittington sewage treatment works was carried out in the late 1980s and again in 1993, and included the addition of a nitrification plant to remove ammonia from the effluent. This resulted in a dramatic increase in water quality since 1993. Staveley works was built in 1993, and also includes a nitrification plant, while Woodhouse Mill works was commissioned in 1979, and replaced a number of poorly-performing smaller works to the south-east of Sheffield.

The river was also affected by discharges from the Staveley Chemicals and the Coalite sites. Staveley Chemicals were producing chlorine and sodium hydroxide by electrolysing brine, and the water discharged from the site contained significant quantities of mercury and ammonia. Mercury, in particular, is highly toxic to fish even in small concentrations, and in 1987, the works was discharging around per year into the river. The works, which was taken over by Rhône-Poulenc Chemicals, was fitted with a mercury recovery plant, and subsequently virtually no mercury was discharged. The Coalite site was manufacturing chemicals from the liquors produced as a by-product of the adjacent coking plant, and was discharging chlorinated compounds into the river. These were treated as part of a scheme to improve the discharges from the coking plant.

===Regeneration===
Water quality was also affected by four coking plants, at Orgreave, Brookhouse, Avenue and the Coalite plant at Shuttlewood, near Bolsover. Discharges from them significantly increased the ammonia content and the biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) of the river. Orgreave was discharging effluent with 146 mg/L of ammonia in 1985, which needed to be around 70% lower to improve the river quality to Grade D, but the plant closed in 1991, and water quality has improved dramatically since then. Discharges from Avenue coking plant were diverted into a foul sewer in 1986, to enable them to be treated at Old Whittington treatment works. The plant closed in 1992, but problems continued with phenolic oils leaching from the original storage lagoons into the river for several years after closure. Discharges from the Coalite plant reached the river through its tributary, the River Doe Lea. Again, there were significant improvements to the treatment of effluent in 1984, 1989 and 1996. Brookhouse was the smallest of the four works, but closed in the early 1980s before remedial works were implemented. The coking plants were the worst polluters of the river, and their closure resulted in water quality being significantly improved.

A biological survey was carried out in 1993, near Rother Valley Country Park, and only seven types of invertebrates were found, all of which were highly tolerant to pollution. It was recognised that the straight engineered channel where the river had been re-instated after coal mining was not well suited to the support of life, and so a stone weir was constructed, to help with natural aeration of the water, and to increase the flow velocity so that the gravel below the weir was scoured clean. A bay was constructed above the weir, where fish could escape when the river was affected by flooding or pollution incidents. A trial release of fish, funded by contributions from Rhone Poulenc, Coalite Chemicals and Yorkshire Water, was made in April 1994. Half of the total of 2,500 chub and 2,500 roach were released near the new weir, and the other half at Hall Road in Staveley. It soon became clear from anglers that the fish were spreading along the river, and a further 40,000 fish were released that winter. Another survey in September 1995 revealed good growth rates in the fish, and barbel were thriving. Brown trout, thought to have come from the River Hipper or the Barlow Brook, were also found in the Rother, and since these are much less tolerant to organic pollution and low oxygen levels, were a clear indicator that conditions were improving. The following year, chub and dace were released at Old Whittington, and clear evidence that the fish were breeding in the river was found. The river had become a self-sustaining fishery again, and organised angling began for the first time in over 100 years.

===Assessment===
The Environment Agency measure water quality of the river systems in England. Each is given an overall ecological status, which may be one of five levels: high, good, moderate, poor and bad. There are several components that are used to determine this, including biological status, which looks at the quantity and varieties of invertebrates, angiosperms and fish. Chemical status, which compares the concentrations of various chemicals against known safe concentrations, is rated good or fail.

The water quality of the Rother was as follows in 2019.
The section from source to Redleadmill Brook has been rated poor since 2009. The lower Rother, from the Doe Lea to the Don was rated fail for chemical status in 2013, but then improved. Like most rivers in the UK, the chemical status changed from good to fail in 2019, due to the presence of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDE), perfluorooctane sulphonate (PFOS) and mercury compounds, none of which had previously been included in the assessment.

<text>was a town located in Hoi District, east-central Aichi Prefecture, Japan.

As of January 1, 2006, the town had an estimated population of 16,440 and a population density of 449 persons per km². Its total area was 36.61 km².

The town was often called as Mikawaichinomiya to avoid confusion with the much larger city of Ichinomiya in former Owari Province.

==History==
Ichinomiya was named after the Ichinomiya of Mikawa Province, the Toga Shrine.

===Formation and mergers===
* On July 1, 1906 - Modern Ichinomiya village was created through the merger of two small hamlets.
* In 1954 - Ichinomiya annexed the village of Yamato (from neighboring Yana District).
* On April 1, 1961 - The village of Ichinomiya was elevated to town status to become the town of Ichinomiya.
* On February 1, 2006 - Ichinomiya was merged into the expanded city of Toyokawa and has ceased to exist as an independent municipality.

<doc id="460557" wikidata="Q3278577" url="?curid=460557" title="Speed bump">
<text>Speed bumps (also called traffic thresholds, speed breakers or sleeping policemen) are a class of traffic calming devices that use vertical deflection to slow motor-vehicle traffic in order to improve safety conditions. Variations include the speed hump, speed cushion, and speed table.

The use of vertical deflection devices is widespread around the world, and they are most commonly used to enforce a speed limit under .

Although speed bumps are effective in keeping vehicle speeds down, their use is sometimes controversial—as they can increase traffic noise, may damage vehicles if traversed at too great a speed (despite that being the point), and slow emergency vehicles. Poorly-designed speed bumps that stand too tall or with too-sharp an angle can be disruptive for drivers, and may be difficult to navigate for vehicles with low ground clearance, even at very low speeds. Many sports cars have this problem with such speed bumps. Speed bumps can also pose serious hazards to motorcyclists and bicyclists if they are not clearly visible, though in some cases a small cut across the bump allows those vehicles to traverse without impediment.

==Composition==

Each of these devices can be made from a variety of materials, including asphalt, concrete, recycled plastic, metal, or vulcanized rubber. Several trade-offs must be made when selecting the material for a new speed cushion. Traditionally most vertical deflection devices have been constructed of asphalt or concrete. Due to the rigidity and durability of these materials, they have more permanence and are more effective at slowing traffic. However, they can be difficult to shape and form into consistent forms and precise dimensions.

Rubber products are pre-shaped to standard sizes to meet industry standards. Preformed rubber products are typically bolted down, making them easier to install or remove. Temporary bolt-down installations can be ideal for planners in testing the use and positioning of speed bumps before implementing them in a larger project. Bolt-down products can also be removed or relocated during winter snow periods—where speed bumps are easily concealed and may be damaged by snowplows.

==History==
On June 7, 1906, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported on an early implementation of what might be considered speed bumps in Chatham, New Jersey, which planned to raise its crosswalks above the road level: &quot;This scheme of stopping automobile speeding has been discussed by different municipalities, but Chatham is the first place to put it in practice&quot;. The average automobile&#x27;s top speed at the time was around , but braking was poor by modern standards.

Arthur Holly Compton was a physicist and winner of the Nobel Prize in physics in 1927 for his discoveries resulting in major changes in electromagnetic theory. He is commonly known for his work on the Compton Effect with X-rays. He also invented what he called &quot;traffic control bumps&quot;, the basic design for the speed hump, in 1953. Compton began designs on the speed bump after noticing the speed at which motorists passed Brookings Hall at Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri, where he was chancellor.

The British Transport and Road Research Laboratory published a comprehensive report in 1973 examining vehicle behavior for a large variety of different bump geometries. At the time speed humps were not permitted on public roads but had been installed on private roads.

According to a publication by the Institute of Transportation Engineers, the first speed bump in Europe was built in 1970 in the city of Delft in the Netherlands.

==Speed bumps==
A speed bump is also known as a &quot;sleeping policeman&quot; in British English, Maltese English and Caribbean English, a &quot;judder bar&quot; in New Zealand English, and a &quot;lying-down policeman&quot; in Colombia, Dominican Republic, Hungary, Croatia, Serbia, Estonia, Lithuania, Slovenia, Bulgaria and Russia. A speed bump is a bump in a roadway with heights typically ranging between . The traverse distance of a speed bump is typically less than or near to ; contrasting with the wider speed humps, which typically have a traverse distance of .

Speed bumps are used in parking lots and on small-neighborhood roads where space and cost are limited. They are being replaced by Speed Humps (discussed in this Wikipedia section) in higher-traffic areas where speed bumps would be ineffective because bumps are mere blips to law-breaking speeders, while law-abiding drivers must slow to far below the speed limit to avoid large vehicle accelerations and displacements. These are the counter-productive results produced by unavoidable dynamic vehicle response. (See https://lindberglce.com/tech/Worst_Roads.PDF).

Because of these counter-productive responses, speed bumps traversals of at least 2 m (about 5 ft.) with smooth approach and exit should be used wherever possible.

Speed bumps vary in length, but it is typical to leave space between the bump and either edge of an enclosed road (i.e. with curbs and gutters) to allow for drainage. Spaces on either side may also allow more expedient passage for emergency vehicles, though effectiveness will depend on the type of vehicle and specific road design.

===Disadvantages===
Local authorities have cited disadvantages to speed bumps:
*The city of Modesto in California, produced a fact sheet which contains the following disadvantages:
** Slow response time of emergency vehicles;
** May divert traffic to parallel residential streets; and
** Possible increase in noise and pollution for residents living immediately adjacent to the speed bumps.
* The English town of Eastleigh states the following as disadvantages:
** Can cause damage to some vehicles;
** Can increase traffic noise, especially when large goods vehicles pass by;
** Required signs, street lighting and white lines may be visually intrusive;
** Can cause discomfort for drivers and passengers;
** Can cause problems for emergency services and buses.

Other sources argue that speed bumps:
* Distract drivers from other hazards such as children
* Increase pollution as traffic travels in a lower gear using significantly more fuel per mile;
* Are a compromise for more active enforcement;
* Increase noise by creating tire-to-bump thumping and increasing the amount of engine-revving;
* Cause spinal damage and aggravate chronic backache.

In 2003, the chairman of the London Ambulance Service, Sigurd Reinton claimed that delays caused by speed bumps were responsible for up to 500 avoidable deaths from cardiac arrest each year. He later denied the statement.

In Sweden, an evaluation of spinal stress in bus drivers against ISO 2631-5 required on health grounds that:
* bus drivers avoid certain streets until the humps were modified; and
* the maximum acceptable speed be reduced to on one street for drivers encountering 150 humps in a day.

Speed bumps can also have adverse environmental impact. A study found that in one north London street with a speed limit of and fitted with road humps, a petrol driven car produced 64 per cent more nitrogen dioxide (NO2) than in a similar street fitted with road cushions. It also produced 47 per cent more particulate matter (PM) and nearly 60 per cent more carbon monoxide (CO) emissions. Another study estimated that, for a private automobile, the increase in fuel consumption due a pass over a speed bump is responsible for fuel waste of 10ml. This multiplied with the number of vehicles going over a particular speed bump every day suggests significant annual fuel wastage for a single speed bump.

===Dynamic speed bumps===
Dynamic speed bumps differ from conventional speed bumps in that they only activate if a vehicle is traveling above a certain speed. Vehicles traveling below this speed will not experience the discomfort of a conventional speed bump. Dynamic speed bumps may allow the passage of emergency vehicles at higher speeds.

The Actibump system, successfully used in Sweden, is based on powered equipment integrated into the road surface, which operates a platform that is lowered a few centimeters when a speeding vehicle approaches. Any vehicle approaching at or under the speed limit will pass on a level road. The system measures the speed of an oncoming vehicle by using radar.

In another design, a rubber housing is fitted with a pressure relief valve that determines the speed of a vehicle. If the vehicle is traveling below the set speed, the valve opens allowing the bump to deflate as the vehicle drives over it, but it remains closed if the vehicle is traveling too fast. The valve can also be set to allow heavy vehicles, such as fire trucks, ambulances, and buses to cross at higher speeds.

==Speed humps==

A speed hump (also called a road hump, or undulation, and speed ramp) is a rounded traffic calming device used to reduce vehicle speed and thus sound volume on residential streets. Humps are placed across the road to slow traffic and are often installed in a series of several humps to prevent cars from speeding before and after the hump. Common speed hump shapes are parabolic, circular, and sinusoidal. In Norway, speed humps are often placed at pedestrian crossings.

Generally, speed humps have a traverse distance of about and span the width of the road. The height of each hump ranges from . The traverse distance and height of each hump determines the speed at which traffic will travel over the devices. Shorter traverse lengths and greater heights slow cars most drastically. When placed in a series apart, humps will reduce 85th percentile speeds by .

Warning signs should be used to notify approaching motorists of upcoming humps. Humps generally have pavement markings to enhance visibility and a taper edge near the curb to allow a gap for drainage.

Speed humps are used in locations where low speeds are desired and suitable for the surrounding traffic environment. Speed humps are typically placed on residential roads and are not used on major roads, bus routes, or primary emergency response routes. Placement is generally mid-block between intersections.

===Results===
Speed humps typically limit vehicle speeds to about at the hump and at the midpoint between humps, depending on spacing. Studies show an average 18% reduction in traffic volume and an average 13% reduction in collisions.

=== Comparison to speed bumps ===
While similar to speed bumps, humps are less aggressive than speed bumps at low speeds. Humps are often used on streets, while bumps are used more in parking lots. While speed bumps generally slow cars to , humps slow cars to . The narrow traverse distance of speed bumps often allows vehicles to pass over them at high speed with only mild disturbance to the wheels and suspension, and hardly affecting the vehicle cab and its occupants. The relatively long slopes of speed humps are less disruptive at low–moderate speeds, but they create a greater, more sustained vertical deflection; at higher speeds, a more sustained deflection is less-absorbed by vehicle suspensions and has a greater effect on the vehicle as a whole.

===Problems===
One problematic aspect of speed humps is their effect on emergency vehicles. Response time is slowed by 3–5 seconds per hump for fire trucks and fire engines and up to 10 seconds for ambulances with patients on board. Speed humps are thus usually not placed on primary response routes. Speed cushions may be placed on these routes instead.

Occasionally, there is an increase in traffic noise from braking and acceleration of vehicles on streets with speed humps, particularly from buses and trucks. Other effects include increased fuel consumption and emissions as well as increased wear and tear on brakes, engine and suspension components.

Damage caused by snow plows during the winter months is an additional concern.

Heavy sedans, trucks, and SUVs are less affected by speed humps, and may not have to slow down as dramatically.

Thin cuts are sometimes placed in the middle of a hump in order to allow bicycle traffic to pass through. However, forcing cyclists to take a particular line on the road compromises their ability to position themselves safely according to the other traffic on the road at the time.

==Speed cushions==

Speed cushions are a type of speed hump installation designed to alleviate the negative impacts that vertical deflections have on emergency vehicle response times. Speed cushions installations are typically made up of several small speed humps installed across the width of the road with spaces between them. They force normal cars to slow down as they ride with one or both wheels over the humps. Meanwhile, they allow fire engines (and other large vehicles) with wider axles to straddle the cushions without slowing down.

Wider, American-style ambulances might also be able to straddle speed cushions. However, in Europe and Australia, where vehicles like the Mercedes-Benz Sprinter are used most frequently as ambulances, there is no advantage. In these jurisdictions, narrower speed cushions are sometimes placed between lanes to allow ambulances to pass unobstructed while driving over the centre line during an emergency.

===Advantages===
Speed cushions have several distinct advantages over similar traffic calming devices. Many municipalities are challenged by opposition to speed humps and speed tables since they slow down emergency vehicles and buses. Speed cushions address this problem by allowing larger vehicles to straddle the cushion without slowing down. This is also an advantage for buses, as lower floor vehicles can sometimes ground out on traditional humps.
Speed cushions are often less costly than speed humps or tables, and most cities report them to be just as effective. In some jurisdictions, narrower speed cushions are placed at more frequent intervals to allow ambulances to pass while driving over the centre line. Large trucks are also not slowed down.

=== Use in North America and Europe ===
Development of speed cushions has focused primarily on the European context. European vehicles typically have a narrower track width than American vehicles, meaning their left and right wheels are closer together. Emergency vehicles still feature a wide track width, and the difference between them makes speed cushions more applicable. 

In North America, however, consumer vehicles have a track width of . Many emergency vehicles are also equipped with dual tires on their rear axles. The additional tires limit track width to as narrow as , meaning speed cushions may not be suitable for their intended use.

== Speed tables ==

A speed table (also called a bus-friendly hump, flat top hump, or raised pedestrian crossing) is designed as a long speed hump with a flat section in the middle. Speed tables are generally long enough for the entire wheelbase of a passenger car to rest on top. The long, flat design allows cars to pass without slowing as significantly as with speed humps or cushions. Because they slow cars less than similar devices, speed tables are often used on roads with typical residential speed limits.

Speed tables can also be signed as pedestrian crossings, namely zebra crossings. A raised zebra crossing is referred to as a wombat crossing in Australia. Other road features may be included, such as junctions, or even mini-roundabouts. Speed tables are used with zebra crossings repeatedly in Leighton Buzzard.

===Results===
Typical speeds resulting from speed tables are . One sample of 8 sites found a 45% decrease in accidents per year with the use of speed tables. Wombat crossings may reduce casualties by 63%.

===Advantages===
Speed tables are effective in calming traffic on streets where the speed limit needs to be maintained rather than slowing cars more significantly. Traffic speed, volumes, and accidents have been shown to decrease with the use of tables. Although not as responsive to emergency vehicles as speed cushions, speed tables cause less of a delay than humps and are typically preferred by fire departments over speed humps.

==In the United Kingdom==
In the UK, vertical deflection in highways for the purpose of traffic calming typically takes one of the following forms:
* Road humps are the most common variety, and are usually round-topped.
* Speed tables, a type of hump with a central plateau which is both long and broad, and which may include a pedestrian crossing, junction or roundabout, are preferred by some emergency services and bus operators.
* Speed cushions, a raised portion of road with a flat top only extending over part of the carriageway&#x27;s width, are used singly, in a pinch point, or in pairs or triples.
* Rumble strips, uneven road surfaces, are now only used in rural areas and retail parks because of the noise.

The Department for Transport defines the regulations for the design and use of road humps.

===Opposition===
Speed bumps in some areas have been removed after protests by local residents. Such protests cite the lack of any consultation as one factor. For example, complaints from Derby residents prompted the removal of 146 speed bumps from streets at a cost of £460,000. Similar incidents have been reported elsewhere in the UK. UK news sources reported a cyclist being killed in a crash while attempting to avoid a speed bump.

<doc id="460565" wikidata="Q376154" url="?curid=460565" title="Battle of Copenhagen (1807)">
<text>The Second Battle of Copenhagen (or the Bombardment of Copenhagen) (16 August – 7 September 1807) was a British bombardment of the Danish capital, Copenhagen, in order to capture or destroy the Dano-Norwegian fleet during the Napoleonic Wars. The incident led to the outbreak of the Anglo-Russian War of 1807, which ended with the Treaty of Örebro in 1812. The attack on Denmark, a neutral country, was heavily criticized internationally.

Britain&#x27;s first response to Napoleon&#x27;s Continental System was to launch a major naval attack on Denmark. Although neutral, Denmark was under French pressure to pledge its fleet to Napoleon. In September 1807, the Royal Navy bombarded Copenhagen, seizing the Danish fleet and assured use of the sea lanes in the North Sea and Baltic Sea for the British merchant fleet. A consequence of the attack was that Denmark did join the Continental System and the war on the side of France, but without a fleet it had little to offer.

The attack gave rise to the term to &quot;Copenhagenize&quot;.

==Background==
Despite the defeat and loss of many ships in the first Battle of Copenhagen in 1801, Denmark-Norway, possessing Jutland, Norway, Greenland, Schleswig-Holstein, Iceland and several smaller territories, still maintained a considerable navy. The majority of the Danish Army, under the Crown Prince, was at this time defending the southern border against possible attack from the French.

There was concern in Britain that Napoleon might try to force Denmark to close the Baltic Sea to British ships, perhaps by marching French troops into Zealand. The British believed that access to the Baltic was &quot;vitally important to Britain&quot; for trade as well as a major source of necessary raw materials for building and maintaining warships and that it gave the Royal Navy access to help Britain&#x27;s allies Sweden and (before Tilsit) Russia against France. The British thought that after Prussia had been defeated in December 1806, Denmark&#x27;s independence looked increasingly under threat from France. George Canning&#x27;s predecessor as Foreign Secretary, Lord Howick, had tried unsuccessfully to persuade Denmark into a secret alliance with Britain and Sweden.

On 21 January 1807, Lord Hawkesbury told the House of Lords that he had received information from someone on the Continent &quot;that there were secret engagements in the Treaty of Tilsit to employ the navies of Denmark and Portugal against this country&quot;. He refused to publish the source because he said it would endanger their lives.

The reports of French diplomats and merchants in northern Europe made the British government uneasy, and by mid-July, the British believed that the French intended to invade Holstein in order to use Denmark against Britain. Some reports suggested that the Danes had secretly agreed to this. The Cabinet decided to act, and on 14 July Lord Mulgrave obtained from the King permission to send a naval force of 21 to 22 ships to the Kattegat for surveillance of the Danish navy in order to pursue &quot;prompt and vigorous operations&quot; if that seemed necessary. The Cabinet decided on 18 July to send Francis Jackson on a secret mission to Copenhagen to persuade Denmark to give its fleet to Britain. That same day, the Admiralty issued an order for more than 50 ships to sail for &quot;particular service&quot; under Admiral James Gambier. On 19 July, Lord Castlereagh, the Secretary of State for War and the Colonies, ordered General Lord Cathcart at Stralsund to go with his troops to the Sound where they would get reinforcements.

During the night of 21/22 July, Canning received intelligence from Tilsit that Napoleon had tried to persuade Alexander I of Russia to form a maritime league with Denmark and Portugal against Britain. Spencer Perceval, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, wrote a memorandum setting out the government&#x27;s case for sending forces to Copenhagen: &quot;The intelligence from so many and such various sources&quot; that Napoleon&#x27;s intent was to force Denmark into war against Britain could not be doubted. &quot;Nay, the fact that he has openly avowed such intention in an interview with the Emperor of Russia is brought to this country in such a way as it cannot be doubted. Under such circumstances it would be madness, it would be idiotic... to wait for an overt act&quot;. Historian Hilary Barnes notes that Canning had no knowledge of the secret articles of the Treaty of Tilsit. He argues that Canning&#x27;s decision was &quot;rash, calamitous, and lacking in understanding of the Danes and of Danish foreign policy.&quot;

The British assembled a force of 25,000 troops, and the vanguard sailed on 30 July; Jackson set out the next day. Canning offered Denmark a treaty of alliance and mutual defence, with a convention signed for the return of the fleet after the war, the protection of 21 British warships and a subsidy for how many soldiers Denmark kept standing. On 31 July, Napoleon ordered Talleyrand to tell Denmark to prepare for war against Britain or else Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte would invade Holstein. Neither Talleyrand nor Jackson persuaded the Danes to end their neutrality, so Jackson went back to the British fleet assembled in the Sound on 15 August. The British published a proclamation demanding the deposit of the Danish fleet; the Danes responded with &quot;what amounted to a declaration of war&quot;.

As the first move in the campaign a division of twenty-nine vessels under Commodore Richard Goodwin Keats was detached to the great belt with instructions to seal the island of Zealand off from Funen and the west. Within a week some 200 miles of coast had been secured and the Danish army in Holstein prevented from passing into Zealand to lend support. The city of Copenhagen was left to its own resources to defend itself from a British force of 25,000.

On 12 August, the 32-gun Danish frigate &quot;Friderichsværn&quot; sailed for Norway from Elsinor. Admiral Lord Gambier sent the 74-gun third-rate and the 22-gun sixth-rate after her, even though war had not yet been declared. &quot;Comus&quot; was much faster than &quot;Defence&quot; in the light winds and so outdistanced her. On 15 August, &quot;Comus&quot; caught &quot;Friderichsværn&quot; off Marstrand and captured her. The British took her into service as HMS &quot;Frederikscoarn&quot;.

The Danish forces in the city amounted to 5,000 regular troops and a similar number of militias. Most of the civilian inhabitants of Copenhagen were evacuated in the few days before Copenhagen was completely invested.

On 26 August, General Wellesley was detached with his reserve and two light brigades of British artillery, as well as one battalion, eight squadrons and one troop of horse artillery from the King&#x27;s German Legion (KGL) to disperse a force which had been sent to relieve the beleaguered city. On 29 August, at the rivulet of Køge, this significant British force swiftly overpowered the Danish troops, which amounted to only three or four regular battalions and some cavalry (see Battle of Køge).

The Danes rejected British demands, so the Royal Navy fleet under the command of Admiral Gambier bombarded the city from 2 to 5 September. In addition to the military casualties incurred by the Danish army, the bombardment killed roughly 195 civilians and injured 768.

The bombardment included 300 Congreve rockets, which caused fires. Due to the civilian evacuation, the normal firefighting arrangements were ineffective; over a thousand buildings were burned.

On 5 September, the Danes sued for peace, and the capitulation was signed on 7 September. Denmark agreed to surrender its navy and its naval stores. In return, the British undertook to leave Copenhagen within six weeks.

Ernst Peymann, the Danish Commander, had been under orders from the Crown Prince to burn the Danish fleet, which he failed to do, though the reason for his failure is unknown.

Thus, on 7 September Peymann surrendered the fleet (eighteen ships of the line, eleven frigates, two smaller ships, two ship-sloops, seven brig-sloops, two brigs, one schooner and twenty-six gunboats). In addition, the British broke up or destroyed three 74-gun ships of the line on the stocks, along with two of the ships-of-the-fleet and two elderly frigates.

After her capture, one ex-Danish ship of the line, &quot;Neptunos&quot;, ran aground and was burnt on or near the island of Hven. Then, when a storm arose in the Kattegat, the British destroyed or abandoned twenty-three of the captured gunboats. The British added the fifteen captured ships of the line that reached Britain to the British Navy but only four—&quot;Christian VII&quot; 80, &quot;Dannemark&quot; 74, &quot;Norge&quot; 74 and &quot;Princess Carolina&quot; 74—saw subsequent active service.

On 21 October, the British fleet left Copenhagen for the United Kingdom. However, the war continued until 1814, when the Treaty of Kiel was signed.

==Aftermath==

The news of what happened did not reach Canning until 16 September. He wrote to Rev. William Leigh: &quot;Did I not tell you we would save Plumstead from bombardment?&quot; One week later he wrote: &quot;Nothing ever was more brilliant, more salutary or more effectual than the success [at Copenhagen]&quot; and Perceval expressed similar sentiments. &quot;The Times&quot; said that the confiscation of the Danish fleet was &quot;a bare act of self-preservation&quot; and noticed the short distance between Denmark and Ireland or north-east Scotland. William Cobbett in his &quot;Political Register&quot; wrote that it was &quot;vile mockery&quot; and &quot;mere party cavilling&quot; to claim that Denmark had the means to preserve her neutrality. MP William Wilberforce said the expedition could be defended on grounds of self-defence. Thomas Grenville wrote to his brother Lord Grenville that he could not help feeling &quot;that in their [the government&#x27;s] situation we should very probably have given the same order without being able to publish to Parliament the grounds on which we had believed in the hostile mind of Denmark&quot;. Lord Erskine condemned it by saying &quot;if hell did not exist before, Providence would create it now to punish ministers for that damnable measure&quot;.

The opposition claimed the national character was stained and Canning read out in Parliament the previous administration&#x27;s plans in 1806 to stop the Portuguese navy falling into the hands of France. Canning and Castlereagh wished to hold Zealand and suggested that when the British evacuated it as part of the peace they should immediately occupy it again. This was strongly opposed by Sir Arthur Wellesley, however, and it did not happen. The opposition claimed that the attack had turned Denmark from a neutral into an enemy. Canning replied by saying that the British were already hated throughout Europe and so Britain could wage an &quot;all-out maritime war&quot; against France without worrying who they were going to upset.

The opposition did not at first table a vote of censure on the battle and instead, on 3 February 1808, demanded the publication of all the letters sent by the British envoy in Denmark on information regarding the war-readiness of the Danish navy. Canning replied with a three-hour speech which Lord Palmerston described as &quot;so powerful that it gave a decisive turn to the debate&quot;. The three motions on this subject were heavily defeated and on 21 March the opposition tabled a direct motion of censure on the battle. It was defeated by 224 votes to 64 after Canning made a speech &quot;very witty, very eloquent and very able&quot;.

The British bombardment frustrated the first attempt to publish a modern edition of the Anglo-Saxon poem &quot;Beowulf&quot; as the subsequent fire destroyed the 20-year work of scholar Grímur Jónsson Thorkelin. Two manuscripts, however, were recovered and Thorkelin eventually published the poem in 1815.

A horse foaled in 1808 (the year following the battle) was named &quot;Copenhagen&quot; in its honour, and was eventually sold to Wellesley and became his favoured mount, most notably at the Battle of Waterloo.

;Danish privateers
Within one week of the British forces departing Copenhagen, King Christian VII&#x27;s government promulgated the Danish Privateers Regulations (1807). Denmark was now at war with Britain, and a part of the Anglo-Danish conflict would be taken up by privateers.
&quot;Kaperbreve&quot; (letters of marque) were issued in Denmark and Norway from 1807 to 1813—copies of original letters of marque for the two ships &quot;Odin&quot; and &quot;Norges Statholder&quot; are included in this reference. Danish shipping companies donated suitable ships (brigs, schooners and galleases) to the state which could then equip the ships for their new privateering role. One such ship was the brig &quot;Admiral Juel&quot; which ranged the North Sea before her capture by the British off Scarborough.

==Ships involved==
One hundred and twenty-six ships, large and small, were involved at Copenhagen, included those named below.
In addition to those named here, there were another three dozen smaller frigates, sloops, bomb vessels, gun-brigs and schooners (e.g. HMS &quot;Rook&quot; attached to the British fleet), and a very large number of merchant or requisitioned ships carrying troops or supplies.

The following ships sailed with Gambier from England on 26 July 1807:
* &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; 98 (flag of Admiral James Gambier, 1st Captain Sir Home Riggs Popham, 2nd Captain Adam Mackenzie)

The following vessels joined on 5 August off Helsingør:
* &quot;Superb&quot; 74 (Captain Donald M&#x27;Leod) (to which Commodore Richard Goodwin Keats shifted his flag)

The following further vessels joined on 7 August off Helsingør:
* &quot;Minotaur&quot; 74 (Rear-Admiral William Essington, Captain Charles John Moore Mansfield)
* &quot;Valiant&quot; 74 (Captain James Young)
* &quot;Inflexible&quot; 64 (Captain Joshua Rowley Watson)
* &quot;Leyden&quot; 64 (Captain William Cumberland)

The following vessels joined on 8 August or later:
* &quot;Defence&quot; 74 (Captain Charles Ekins)
* &quot;Mars&quot; 74 (Captain William Lukin)
* &quot;Agamemnon&quot; 64 (Captain Jonas Rose)
* &quot;Africaine&quot; 32 (Capt. Richard Raggett)

Lieutenant-General Lord Cathcart arrived in the &quot;Africaine&quot; on 12 August to take command of the ground forces.

* &quot;Stubbekjøbing&quot; had been destroyed at Svanemølle Bay on 26 August by mortar fire from the land.

===Gun barges===
Four barges (stykpram), floating gun platforms each with 20 cannon, were incapable of being moved far and so the British scuttled the barges during their brief occupation of Copenhagen. Of these four barges (&quot;Hajen&quot;, &quot;Kiempen&quot;, &quot;Lindormen&quot; and &quot;Sværdfisken&quot;) only &quot;Hajen&quot; was not raised and refurbished by the Danes after the British departure. A further &quot;unsinkable&quot; floating battery (&quot;Flaadebatteri No 1&quot;) of twenty-four 24-pound cannon was rendered inoperable and decommissioned the following year.

<text>The Huntsman was the winner of the 1862 Grand National steeplechase run on 12 March at Aintree near Liverpool, England. The winner was owned by Viscount de Namur and trained in France by Yorkshire born trainer Henry (Harry) Jeremiah Lamplugh who also chose to ride the horse himself. The Huntsman had previously finished third in the race in 1859 and second in 1860, being ridden in the latter race by the amateur jockey Thomas Townley.

The Huntsman had left Chantilly in February 1861 under the care of Lamplugh to spend a year at Doncaster preparing for the Grand National.

Thirteen ran, with the previous year&#x27;s winner Jealousy being withdrawn on the morning of the race. The Huntsman came to the final fence with only one other horse in with a chance of beating him, Bridegroom, ridden by Richard Sherrard. The Huntsman had more to offer than his rival and went on up the run in to become the first French trained winner of the race. Five horses completed the course although the third placed Romeo had refused at the third last fence while fifth placed Bucephalus had been virtually brought down in the early stages and finished tailed off from his rivals.

The race of 1862 is remembered however for the only human fatality recorded in the Grand National. At the Chair fence situated in front of the grand stands two competitors collided before both fell. One of the riders, Joseph {Joe} Wynne, riding in his first National was crushed and was taken unconscious to the nearby Sefton Arms Inn where he died five hours later. Joe&#x27;s father Dennis (Denny) had won the race as a jockey in 1847 but he himself had died in a fall in 1858.

Within a month of his victory, The Huntsman was taken back to France to the headquarters of his new owner, the Baron de la Motte, at the Imperial Haras [stud] at Abbeville. The Huntsman was to stand for his portrait by M. G. Parquet and then to be put to stud at Abbeville.

<doc id="460587" wikidata="Q204148" url="?curid=460587" title="Cinnamomum cassia">
<text>Cinnamomum cassia, called Chinese cassia or Chinese cinnamon, is an evergreen tree originating in southern China and widely cultivated there and elsewhere in South and Southeast Asia. It is one of several species of &quot;Cinnamomum&quot; used primarily for its aromatic bark, which is used as a spice. The buds are also used as a spice, especially in India, and were used by the ancient Romans.

== Description ==
The tree grows to tall, with grayish bark and hard, elongated leaves that are long and reddish when young.

==Origin and types==
Chinese cassia is a close relative to Ceylon cinnamon (&quot;C. verum&quot;), Saigon cinnamon (&quot;C. loureiroi&quot;), Indonesian cinnamon (&quot;C. burmannii&quot;), and Malabar cinnamon (&quot;C. citriodorum&quot;). In all five species, the dried bark is used as a spice. Chinese cassia&#x27;s flavor is less delicate than that of Ceylon cinnamon. Its bark is thicker, more difficult to crush, and has a rougher texture than that of Ceylon cinnamon. Cassia cinnamon is the most popular variety of cinnamon sold and consumed in North America. 

Chinese cassia is produced in both China and Vietnam. Until the 1960s, Vietnam was the world&#x27;s most important producer of Saigon cinnamon, which has a higher oil content, and consequently has a stronger flavor. Because of the disruption caused by the Vietnam War, however, production of Indonesian cassia in the highlands of the Indonesian island of Sumatra was increased to meet demand. Indonesian cassia has the lowest oil content of the three types of cassia, so commands the lowest price. Chinese cassia has a sweeter flavor than Indonesian cassia, similar to Saigon cinnamon, but with lower oil content.

==Uses==

=== Spice ===
Cassia bark (both powdered and in whole or &quot;stick&quot; form) is used as a flavoring agent for confectionery, desserts, pastries, and meat; it is specified in many curry recipes, where Ceylon cinnamon is less suitable. Traditionally, the bark is stripped off the tree and dried in the shade. After drying, it is thinly sliced for use or ground into a powder. Essential oils made from the stripped bark have many uses, such as in health products, food and drinks. Cassia is sometimes added to Ceylon cinnamon but is a much thicker, coarser product. Cassia is sold as pieces of bark or as neat quills or sticks. Cassia sticks can be distinguished from Ceylon cinnamon sticks in this manner: Ceylon cinnamon sticks have many thin layers and can easily be made into powder using a coffee or spice grinder, whereas cassia sticks are extremely hard and are usually made up of one thick layer.

Cassia buds, although rare, are also occasionally used as a spice. They resemble cloves in appearance and have a mild, flowery cinnamon flavor. Cassia buds are primarily used in old-fashioned pickling recipes, marinades, and teas.

=== Traditional medicine and phytochemicals ===

The part of the bark that is used to make spices is called the Cinnamomi cortex. Chinese cassia (called &quot;ròuguì&quot;; in Chinese) is produced primarily in the southern provinces of Guangxi, Guangdong, and Yunnan. It is considered one of the 50 fundamental herbs in traditional Chinese medicine. More than 160 phytochemicals have been isolated from &quot;Cinnamomum cassia&quot;.

The blood-thinning component called coumarin found in &quot;C. cassia&quot; could damage the liver if consumed in larger amounts, therefore European health agencies have warned against consuming high amounts of cassia. Other bioactive compounds found in the bark, powder and essential oils of &quot;C. cassia&quot; are cinnamaldehyde and styrene. In high doses, these substances can also be toxic to humans.

==History==
A mention by Chinese herbalists suggests that cassia bark was used by humans at least as far back as 2700 B.C. It was a treatment for diarrhea, fevers, and menstrual issues. 

Cassia cinnamon was brought to Egypt around 500 B.C. where it became a valued additive to their embalming mixtures. The Bible suggests that it was part of the anointing oil used by Moses. The Greeks, Romans and ancient Hebrews were the first to use cassia bark as a cooking spice. They also made perfumes with it and used it for medicinal purposes. Cinnamon migrated with the Romans. It was established for culinary use by the 17th century in Europe.

<text>Group Captain Thomas Loel Evelyn Bulkeley Guinness, (9 June 1906 – 31 December 1988) was a British Conservative politician, Member of Parliament (MP) for Bath (1931–1945), business magnate and philanthropist. Guinness also financed the purchase of the &quot;Calypso&quot;, leasing her for one symbolic franc a year to famous oceanic explorer Jacques-Yves Cousteau and his movie &quot;The Silent World&quot; (1956).

==Early life==
Born in Manhattan and raised in the United States and England, Loel Guinness was the only son of Benjamin Seymour Guinness, an Irish lawyer from whom he inherited a fortune, and his first wife, Bridget Henrietta Frances Williams-Bulkeley.

Loel Guinness had two sisters: Meraud Michelle Wemyss Guinness and Tanis Eva Bulkeley Guinness.

He was educated at Royal Military College, Sandhurst. He gained the rank of lieutenant in the service of the Irish Guards.

==Career==
After taking flying lessons, Guinness joined the Royal Aero Club in 1928. The following year, he became one of the first private citizens in England to own an airplane and soon he was a member of the County of London&#x27;s Auxiliary Air Force squadron. He later served as president of Air Work Ltd., an aircraft-parts supplier, and of British United Airways.

In 1931, on his third try, Guinness was elected to Parliament for Bath and was named parliamentary private secretary to Sir Philip Sassoon, the Under Secretary for Air from 1931 to 1935. He held his seat until 1945, when he stood down.

==Second World War==
Guinness gained the rank of group captain in the service of the Royal Auxiliary Air Force. When the Second World War broke out in 1939, Guinness went on active duty with the Royal Air Force. In 1940 he flew as a fighter pilot in the Battle of Britain, famously buying a petrol station near his aerodrome when his driving was restricted by rationing. In 1944 he became commander of a wing of the Second Tactical Air Force and by the war&#x27;s end he had been Mentioned in Despatches five times. He was invested as an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in 1942. The Netherlands made him a Commander of the Order of Orange-Nassau and France made him an Officer of the Legion of Honour and awarded him a Croix de Guerre.

==Personal life==
Guinness&#x27;s first marriage was to Joan Barbara Yarde-Buller (1908–1997). Before their divorce, Loel and Joan had a son, Patrick Benjamin Guinness, who was killed in an automobile accident near Rarogne, Switzerland.

Joan left him for Prince Aly Khan, the eldest son of the Aga Khan III, the 43rd Shia Imam, and Guinness successfully sued Joan and Khan on grounds of adultery. Joan and Khan did not defend the charges and the judge, Mr Justice Bucknill, granted Guinness a &quot;decree nisi&quot; and full custody of their son and ordered Khan to pay court costs. Joan married Khan on 18 May 1936, a few days after the divorce became absolute.

In 1936, he married his second wife, Lady Isabel Violet Kathleen Manners (1918–2008), who was prominent in society at Palm Beach. Together, they were the parents of a son William Loel Seymour Guinness and a daughter Serena Belinda Rosemary &quot;Lindy&quot; Guinness.

In a reversal of the outcome of his first marriage, in 1951, Lady Isabel was granted a divorce after accusing him of adultery, which he did not contest.

On 7 April 1951, he married his third wife, the socialite Gloria Rubio y Alatorre (1913–1980). Her daughter, Dolores married his eldest son, Patrick Benjamin Guinness (1931–1965).

On 31 December 1988, Guinness died of heart disease at The Methodist Hospital in Houston, Texas, United States. He was buried with the remains of his third wife at the Bois-de-Vaux Cemetery, Lausanne.

His granddaughter was Victoria Christina Guinness (born 1960).

<text>The beardfishes consist of a single extant genus, &quot;Polymixia&quot;, of deep-sea marine ray-finned fish named for their pair of long hyoid barbels. They are classified in their own order Polymixiiformes . But as Nelson says, &quot;few groups have been shifted back and forth as frequently as this one, and they were recently added to Paracanthoptergii&quot;. For instance, they have previously been classified as belonging to the Beryciformes, and are presently considered either paracanthopterygians or the sister group to acanthopterygians. They are of little economic importance.

They are found in tropical and subtropical waters of the Atlantic, Indian and western Pacific Ocean. They are bottom-dwelling fish, found down to about depth. Most are relatively small fish, although one species, &quot;Polymixia berndti&quot;, is over in length.

The earliest body fossils are from the Late Cenomanian of Lebanon, of the genus &quot;Pycnosteroides&quot;. However, tentative earlier records are known from distinctive fossil otoliths from the Early Cretaceous (Albian) of Texas, USA. Many different fossil families and genera are known from the Late Cretaceous and early Cenozoic, in contrast to the relatively few surviving species in a single genus. Extant beardfish can thus be considered &quot;living fossils&quot;.

<text>The Jacksonville Jumbo Shrimp are a Minor League Baseball team of the International League (IL) and the Triple-A affiliate of the Miami Marlins. They are located in Jacksonville, Florida, and are named for shrimp caught in the area. The team plays their home games at VyStar Ballpark, which opened in 2003. They previously played at Sam W. Wolfson Baseball Park from 1962 until the end of the 2002 season. 

A team known as the Jacksonville Suns competed in the Triple-A International League from 1962 to 1968. The franchise was relocated to Norfolk, Virginia, as the Tidewater Tides in 1969. After one season without professional baseball, a different Suns team came to the city in 1970 as members of the Double-A Southern League (SL). From 1985 to 1990, the team was known as the Jacksonville Expos during an affiliation with the Montreal Expos, but they returned to the Suns moniker in 1991. The club rebranded as the Jacksonville Jumbo Shrimp before the 2017 season. In conjunction with Major League Baseball&#x27;s reorganization of Minor League Baseball in 2021, the Jumbo Shrimp were elevated to the Triple-A East, which was renamed the International League in 2022.

Jacksonville won their only IL championship in 1968 as the Triple-A affiliate of the New York Mets. They won the SL championship six times. The first came in 1996 as the Double-A affiliate of the Detroit Tigers. As a farm club for the Los Angeles Dodgers, they won in 2001 and 2005. Three SL titles were won as the Double-A affiliate of the Miami Marlins, including back-to-back championships in 2009 and 2010 and most recently in 2014.

Jacksonville, Florida, has hosted professional baseball teams since the late 19th century. Six teams of the Southern League of Colored Base Ballists were based in the city in 1886. An unnamed team played in an early iteration of the Florida State League in 1892. With only a few interruptions from 1904 to 1961, the city was home to such Minor League Baseball teams as the Jays, Tars, and Braves, which played predominantly in the original South Atlantic League (&quot;Sally League&quot;), a predecessor to the modern Southern League. Jacksonville was also home to the Red Caps of the Negro leagues.

===International League (1962–1968)===
The first team from the Sunshine State of Florida known as the Jacksonville Suns arrived in the city by way of Havana, Cuba, and Jersey City, New Jersey. Following the Cuban Revolution in 1959, the Havana Sugar Kings of the Triple-A International League (IL) relocated to become the Jersey City Jerseys during the 1960 season. The franchise folded after the 1961 campaign and was bought by a local group headed by Samuel W. Wolfson, previously the owner of the Jacksonville Braves. The Suns played their home games at Jacksonville Baseball Park, which was renamed Sam W. Wolfson Baseball Park after Wolfson&#x27;s death in 1963.

As the Triple-A affiliate of the Cleveland Indians, the Suns ended their first season by winning the 1962 International League pennant with a league-best 94–60 record under manager Ben Geraghty. In the Governors&#x27; Cup playoffs for the IL championship, they won the semifinals over the Rochester Red Wings but lost the finals to the Atlanta Crackers, 4–3. Shortstop/second baseman Tony Martínez was selected for the IL Most Valuable Player (MVP) Award, and right-hander Joe Schaffernoth won the Most Valuable Pitcher Award.

In 1964, Jacksonville became the top farm club of the St. Louis Cardinals. The team won a second IL pennant that year under manager Harry Walker with an 89–62 season, but they were eliminated in the postseason semifinals by Rochester. Shortstop Joe Morgan was selected as the 1964 league MVP. The Suns switched affiliations to the New York Mets in 1966. During this period, pitchers Tom Seaver (1966) and Nolan Ryan (1967), both future Baseball Hall of Fame inductees, played for the Suns. Skipper Clyde McCullough led the 1968 Suns to win their only IL playoff championship. After defeating the Toledo Mud Hens, 3–1, in the semifinals, they won the league crown over the Columbus Jets, 4–0, in the finals.

When the Milwaukee Braves moved to Atlanta in 1966, the Atlanta Crackers relocated to Richmond, Virginia. This left Jacksonville as the southernmost team in the league, far away from the nearest clubs in Richmond and Louisville, Kentucky. After the 1968 season, the team was relocated to Norfolk, Virginia, as the Tidewater Tides. Jacksonville went without a minor league team in 1969.

===Southern League (1970–2020)===

A new Suns team began play in 1970 when the Double-A Southern League (SL) added expansion franchises in Jacksonville, and Mobile, Alabama. Jacksonville became the Double-A affiliate of both the Milwaukee Brewers and Montreal Expos for their first Southern League season. They became a Cleveland Indians farm club in 1971, and then began a much longer affiliation with the Kansas City Royals in 1972.

The Suns made their first Southern League playoff appearance in 1973 behind Manager of the Year Billy Gardner. They won the Eastern Division title but lost the championship finals versus the Montgomery Rebels, 3–1. Jacksonville returned to the playoffs in 1974 via another Eastern Division title but were again denied a championship by the Knoxville Sox, 3–2. By 1977, the SL had begun using a split-season schedule wherein the division winners from each half qualified for the postseason. The Suns won 1977&#x27;s Second Half Eastern Division title, won the division title over the Savannah Braves, but lost to Montgomery, 2–0, in the finals. Jacksonville made two more appearances in the playoffs with Kansas City but lost in the finals each time. The 1982 team won both halves of the season with a league-best 83–61 record under Manager of the Year Gene Lamont, but they ultimately lost the championship to the Nashville Sounds, 3–1. The 1983 second-half champion Suns lost in the finals, 3–1, to the Birmingham Barons. Outfielder John Morris was selected as the 1983 Southern League MVP.

Jacksonville became the Double-A affiliate of the Montreal Expos in 1984. After being purchased by Peter Bragan Sr. and his family in 1985, the team was renamed the Jacksonville Expos. Much like in the previous affiliation, the Expos made four playoff appearances in seven seasons with Montreal but were eliminated in the Eastern Division series on each occasion (1986, 1987, 1988, and 1990). Individual players and managers, however, garnered several league awards during this period. First baseman Andrés Galarraga was the 1984 Southern League MVP, and skipper Rick Renick was the season&#x27;s Manager of the Year. Tommy Thompson was recognized as the top manager for 1987 after leading the Expos to a league-best 85–59 record. Starting pitcher Brian Holman won the 1987 Most Outstanding Pitcher Award. Two other notable players to appear for Jacksonville in 1987 were future National League MVP Larry Walker and future Hall of Famer Randy Johnson. In 1990, starter Brian Barnes was the Most Outstanding Pitcher, and Jerry Manuel was the Manager of the Year.

Upon switching affiliation to the Seattle Mariners in 1991, the team reverted to its Suns moniker. Over four seasons with Seattle, the Suns never qualified for the playoffs. Right-hander Jim Converse won the 1992 Most Outstanding Pitcher Award after leading the Southern League with 157 strikeouts. Future major league All-Stars Alex Rodriguez (1994) and Bret Boone (1991) came through Jacksonville during the Mariners affiliation.

The Detroit Tigers became the parent club of the Suns in 1995. Behind the leadership of managers Bill Plummer and Larry Parrish, the 1996 Suns won both halves of the season and then the Eastern Division title over the Carolina Mudcats. They went on to defeat the Chattanooga Lookouts, 3–1, to win their first Southern League championship and first league title since 1968. The Detroit-affiliated Suns reached the championship finals twice more but lost to the Mobile BayBears in 1998 and West Tenn Diamond Jaxx in 2000. Outfielder Gabe Kapler won the 1998 MVP Award after leading the league in home runs (28), hits (176), runs (113), doubles (47), RBI (146), total bases (319, and sacrifice flies (11). Closer Francisco Cordero, the league&#x27;s saves leader (27), was 1999&#x27;s Most Outstanding Pitcher.

Jacksonville affiliated with the Los Angeles Dodgers in 2001. Manager of the Year John Shoemaker&#x27;s 2001 club paced the league with an 83–56 mark, winning both halves of the season. They bested Chattanooga, 3–2, to advance to the finals against the Huntsville Stars, but the September 11 terrorist attacks brought a halt to the championship series before it began. Jacksonville and Huntsville were declared co-champions. The 2002 season was the Suns&#x27; last year at Wolfson Park. They moved into the newly constructed Baseball Grounds of Jacksonville, later renamed 121 Financial Ballpark, at the start of the 2003 season, and VyStar Ballpark for the 2025 season. The 11,000-seat, US$34-million venue was created as part of the Better Jacksonville Plan. The 2002 team made a bid to win the championship outright but was swept by Birmingham in the best-of-five finals. Starter Joel Hanrahan was 2003&#x27;s Most Outstanding Pitcher. With Shoemaker still at the helm, the Suns won the first half title before sweeping Birmingham, 3–0, in the Southern Division series. They went on to win their third Southern League championship over West Tenn, 3–1. Though the 2006 club was eliminated by the Montgomery Biscuits in the division series, Shoemaker won his second Manager of the Year Award, and Spike Lundberg was selected as the league&#x27;s Most Outstanding Pitcher.

Jacksonville entered into a new affiliation with the Florida Marlins in 2009; the MLB team became the Miami Marlins in 2012. The relationship got off to an auspicious start as the Suns won back-to-back Southern League championships. Brandon Hyde&#x27;s 2009 second-half winners swept Birmingham for the Southern Division title then defeated the Tennessee Smokies, 3–1, in the finals for the championship win. Tim Leiper took over managerial duties for the 2010 season. After winning both halves of the season with an 81–59 record, Jacksonville bested Mobile, 3–1, in the division series before knocking off Tennessee, 3–1, for the second-straight year in the championship round. Tom Koehler won that season&#x27;s Most Outstanding Pitcher Award. In 2014, the Suns finished the regular season on a ten-game winning streak, edging out the Mississippi Braves by one game to win the second half title. Including the playoffs, the Suns won 16 of their final 17 games en route to winning the Southern Division title over Mobile and their sixth and final Southern League championship over Chattanooga, 3–0. Justin Nicolino was recognized as the league&#x27;s Most Outstanding Pitcher.

The Bragan family sold the franchise to Ken Babby of Fast Forward Sports Group in 2015. The Suns rebranded after the 2016 season, becoming the Jacksonville Jumbo Shrimp. The name combines shrimping, which is popular on Jacksonville&#x27;s St. Johns River, with the sentiment that Jacksonville, Florida&#x27;s largest city, still has a small-town feel, hinting at the moniker&#x27;s oxymoronic nature. The 2017 team won a second half title, but they lost the Southern Division to the Pensacola Blue Wahoos. The start of the 2020 season was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic before being cancelled on June 30.

===Triple-A East / International League (2021–present)===

Since the move to VyStar Ballpark, the Suns have consistently been at or near the top of their league in attendance. This success led to speculation that the team could return to the Triple-A level in the future. In conjunction with Major League Baseball&#x27;s reorganization of the minor leagues after the 2020 season, the Jumbo Shrimp were selected to move up to the Triple-A classification—making them the only active Florida-based team at that level—and continue as affiliates of the Miami Marlins in 2021. They were placed in the 20-team Triple-A East. Jacksonville began competition in the new league on May 4 with an 11–5 victory over the Norfolk Tides at then–121 Financial Ballpark. They ended the season in second place in the Southeastern Division with a 69–51 record. No playoffs were held to determine a league champion; instead, the team with the best regular-season record was declared the winner. However, 10 games that had been postponed from the start of the season were reinserted into the schedule as a postseason tournament called the Triple-A Final Stretch in which all 30 Triple-A clubs competed for the highest winning percentage. Jacksonville finished the tournament tied for seventh place with a 6–4 record. In 2022, the Triple-A East became known as the International League, the name historically used by the regional circuit prior to the 2021 reorganization.

<text>Slow Burn is a 2005 American drama thriller film directed by Wayne Beach and starring Ray Liotta, Jolene Blalock and LL Cool J. It is notable for the extended period between production and eventual release. A crime drama, the film was produced in 2003, was finally given a showing at the 2005 Toronto International Film Festival, and finally got a proper theatrical release in 2007.

==Plot==
Nora Timmer, a biracial (African and European descent) woman, is being questioned by Ford Cole, the District Attorney. Nora, who is the Assistant District Attorney, claims she was being raped by Isaac Duparde when she shot him in the head. Journalist Ty Trippin interviews Ford; Ford surprises Ty by anticipating his first two questions.

Nora explains to Ford that she had first met Isaac a week earlier at a music store, where he came on to her, asking to give her a ride on the rainy night. Nora politely rebuffed his advances, but was forced to accept his offer when she found herself stranded in the rain with no cab to respond to her calls. Issac locked the door to his car when Nora tried to exit upon reaching her home, only to give her a music cassette as a compliment. Nora tells Ford that Issac waited for her in her house one night, grabbed her from behind, and raped her.

Luther Pinks, claiming to be an associate of Isaac, shows up to meet Ford and relates his version of the story, stating that Isaac&#x27;s death was not self-defence, but murder. He states that Nora had seduced Isaac into falling in love and ultimately becoming obsessed with her. He tells Ford about an &#x27;African violet&#x27; tattoo on Nora&#x27;s backside to support his claims. Ford tends to believe him, as he himself had seen it when he and Nora had sex.

Isaac&#x27;s home is set ablaze and Ford receives an odd voicemail from the deceased suggesting a conspiracy involving Nora. Later, Luther tells Ford of a deal Nora supposedly offered Isaac for his cousin who was recently booked on drug charges; if his aunt were to agree to sell her home to an interested party, his cousin would walk. Luther also reveals Nora&#x27;s dirty little secret—that she isn&#x27;t biracial but is using being a minority to benefit her career and to satisfy some strange obsession with being black.

==Cast==

== Release ==
It was released in American theaters on April 13, 2007, but performed poorly. It had an opening weekend of $778,123 in ticket sales and closed in just 2 weeks with a domestic total of $1,237,615 and $559,641 from foreign markets for a worldwide total of $1,797,256. It ranks among the top ten widely released films for having the biggest second weekend drop at the box office, dropping 84.7% from $676,048 to $91,748.

The DVD was released in North America on July 24, 2007, and sold 44,720 units in the opening weekend, translating to revenue of $893,953. This does not include Blu-ray/DVD sales rentals and sales tracking does not extend beyond the first week. 

The film has themes of inter-racial dating, &quot;passing&quot; or pretending to be a member of another race, stereotypes included, and using a rape defense to the accusation of murder.

==Reception==
&quot;Slow Burn&quot; received negative reviews from critics. , the film holds a 12% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 34 reviews with an average rating of 3.63/10. The website&#x27;s critics consensus reads: &quot;With wooden acting and hammy, overheated dialogue, &quot;Slow Burn&quot; isn&#x27;t so much a noir as it is a mediocre parody of one.&quot;

==Novel==
The screenplay is based on a short story by Wayne Beach and Anthony Walton. Wayne Beach converted the story to screenplay and directed the film.

<doc id="460613" wikidata="Q1358313" url="?curid=460613" title="Ring of integers">
<text>In mathematics, the ring of integers of an algebraic number field formula_1 is the ring of all algebraic integers contained in formula_1. An algebraic integer is a root of a monic polynomial with integer coefficients: formula_3. This ring is often denoted by formula_4 or formula_5. Since any integer belongs to formula_1 and is an integral element of formula_1, the ring formula_8 is always a subring of formula_4.

The ring of integers formula_8 is the simplest possible ring of integers. Namely, formula_11 where formula_12 is the field of rational numbers. And indeed, in algebraic number theory the elements of formula_8 are often called the &quot;rational integers&quot; because of this.

The next simplest example is the ring of Gaussian integers formula_14, consisting of complex numbers whose real and imaginary parts are integers. It is the ring of integers in the number field formula_15 of Gaussian rationals, consisting of complex numbers whose real and imaginary parts are rational numbers. Like the rational integers, formula_14 is a Euclidean domain. 

The ring of integers of an algebraic number field is the unique maximal order in the field. It is always a Dedekind domain.

== Properties ==
The ring of integers is a finitely-generated -module. Indeed, it is a free -module, and thus has an integral basis, that is a basis of the -vector space  such that each element  in can be uniquely represented as
:formula_17
with . The rank  of as a free -module is equal to the degree of  over .

==Examples==

=== Computational tool ===
A useful tool for computing the integral closure of the ring of integers in an algebraic field is the discriminant. If is of degree over , and formula_18 form a basis of over , set formula_19. Then, formula_20 is a submodule of the spanned by formula_21. pg. 33 In fact, if is square-free, then formula_22 forms an integral basis for formula_20. pg. 35

=== Cyclotomic extensions ===
If is a prime,  is a th root of unity and is the corresponding cyclotomic field, then an integral basis of is given by .

=== Quadratic extensions ===
If formula_24 is a square-free integer and formula_25 is the corresponding quadratic field, then formula_20 is a ring of quadratic integers and its integral basis is given by if and by if . This can be found by computing the minimal polynomial of an arbitrary element formula_27 where formula_28.

==Multiplicative structure==
In a ring of integers, every element has a factorization into irreducible elements, but the ring need not have the property of unique factorization: for example, in the ring of integers , the element 6 has two essentially different factorizations into irreducibles:
:formula_29

A ring of integers is always a Dedekind domain, and so has unique factorization of ideals into prime ideals.

The units of a ring of integers is a finitely generated abelian group by Dirichlet&#x27;s unit theorem. The torsion subgroup consists of the roots of unity of . A set of torsion-free generators is called a set of &quot;fundamental units&quot;.

==Generalization==
One defines the ring of integers of a non-archimedean local field as the set of all elements of with absolute value ; this is a ring because of the strong triangle inequality. If is the completion of an algebraic number field, its ring of integers is the completion of the latter&#x27;s ring of integers. The ring of integers of an algebraic number field may be characterised as the elements which are integers in every non-archimedean completion.

For example, the -adic integers are the ring of integers of the -adic numbers .

<doc id="460615" wikidata="Q4971470" url="?curid=460615" title="British undergraduate degree classification">
<text>The British undergraduate degree classification system is a grading structure used for undergraduate degrees or bachelor&#x27;s degrees and integrated master&#x27;s degrees in the United Kingdom. The system has been applied, sometimes with significant variation, in other countries and regions.

The UK&#x27;s university degree classification system, established in 1918, serves to recognize academic achievement beyond examination performance. Bachelor&#x27;s degrees in the UK can either be honours or ordinary degrees, with honours degrees classified into First Class, Upper Second Class (2:1), Lower Second Class (2:2), and Third Class based on weighted averages of marks. The specific thresholds for these classifications can vary by institution. Integrated master&#x27;s degrees follow a similar classification, and there is some room for discretion in awarding final classifications based on a student&#x27;s overall performance and work quality.

The honours degree system has been subject to scrutiny owing to significant shifts in the distribution of classifications, leading to calls for reform. Concerns over grade inflation have been observed. The Higher Education Statistics Agency has documented changes, noting an increase in the proportion of First Class and Upper Second Class honours degrees awarded; the percentage of First Class Honours increased from 7% in 1997 to 26% in 2017. Critics argue this trend, driven partly by institutional pressures to maintain high league table rankings, dilutes the value of higher education and undermines public confidence. Despite improvements in teaching and student motivation contributing to higher grades, there is a sentiment that achieving a First or Upper Second Class Honours is no longer sufficient for securing desirable employment, pushing students towards extracurricular activities to enhance their curriculum vitae. The system affects progression to postgraduate education, with most courses requiring at least a 2:1, although work experience and additional qualifications can sometimes compensate for lower classifications. 

In comparison to international grading systems, the UK&#x27;s classifications have equivalents in various countries, adapting to different academic cultures and grading scales. The ongoing debate over grade inflation and its implications for the UK&#x27;s higher education landscape reflect broader concerns about maintaining academic standards and the value of university degrees in an increasingly competitive job market.

== History ==
The classification system as used in the United Kingdom was developed in 1918. Honours were then a means to recognise individuals who demonstrated depth of knowledge or originality, as opposed to relative achievement in examination conditions.

Concern exists about possible grade inflation. It is claimed that academics are under increasing pressure from administrators to award students good marks and grades with little regard for those students&#x27; actual abilities, in order to maintain their league table rankings. The percentage of graduates who receive a first (First Class Honours) grew from 7% in 1997 to 26% in 2017, with the rate of growth sharply accelerating toward the end of this period. A 2018 study by the UK Standing Committee for Quality Assessment concluded that improvements in faculty skill and student motivation are only two of many factors driving average grades upward, that grade inflation is real, that the British undergraduate degree classifications will become less useful to students and employers, and that inflation will undermine public confidence in the overall value of higher education. Students already believe that a first or upper second, by itself, is no longer sufficient to secure a good job, and that they need to engage in extra-curricular activities to build their CV.

== Degree classification ==
A bachelor&#x27;s degree can be an honours degree (bachelor&#x27;s with honours) or an ordinary degree (bachelor&#x27;s without honours). Honours degrees are classified, usually based on a weighted average (with higher weight given to marks in the later years of the course, and often zero weight to those in the first year) of the marks gained in exams and other assessments. While grade boundaries are defined by institutions, there are well-defined conventional values that are generally followed:
* &quot;First Class Honours&quot; (1st, 1 or I) – 70% or higher
* &quot;Second Class Honours&quot;:
** &quot;Upper division&quot; (2:1, 2i or II-1) – 60–69%
** &quot;Lower division&quot; (2:2, 2ii or II-2) – 50–59%
* &quot;Third Class Honours&quot; (3rd, 3 or III) – 40–49%

Students who do not achieve honours may be awarded an ordinary degree, sometimes known as a &quot;pass&quot;. Ordinary degrees, and other exit awards such as the Diploma of Higher Education (DipHE; for completing the first two years of a degree course) and Certificate of Higher Education (CertHE; for completing the first year of a degree course), may be unclassified (pass/fail) or, particularly in Scotland where the ordinary degree is offered as a qualification in its own right, classified into pass, merit and distinction.

Integrated master&#x27;s degrees are usually classified with honours in the same way as a bachelor&#x27;s honours degree, although some integrated master&#x27;s degrees are classified like postgraduate taught master&#x27;s degrees or foundation degrees into:
* &quot;Distinction&quot; – typically 70% and higher
* &quot;Merit&quot; – typically 60–69%
* &quot;Pass&quot; – typically 50–59%.

At most institutions, the system allows a small amount of discretion. A candidate may be elevated to the next degree class if their average marks are close to (or the median of their weighted marks achieves) the higher class, and if they have submitted several pieces of work worthy of the higher class. However, even students with a high average mark may be unable to take honours if they have failed part of the course and so have insufficient credits.

In England, Wales and Northern Ireland, a bachelor&#x27;s degree with honours normally takes three years of full-time study and usually requires 360 credits, of which at least 90 are at level 6 (final year of a bachelor&#x27;s degree) level, while an ordinary bachelor&#x27;s degree normally requires 300 credits, of which 60 are at level 6. In Scotland, the honours bachelor&#x27;s degree takes four years and requires 480 credits with a minimum of 90 at level 10 of the Scottish framework (last year of the honours degree) and 90 at level 9 (penultimate year), while the ordinary degree takes three years and requires 360 credits with a minimum of 60 at level 9 (last year of the ordinary degree).

In Scotland, it is possible to start university a year younger than in the rest of the United Kingdom, as the Scottish Higher exams are often taken at age 16 or 17 (as opposed to 18), so Scottish students often end a four-year course at the same age as a student from elsewhere in the UK taking a three-year course , assuming no gap years or students skipping the first year (direct entry to 2nd year).

When a candidate is awarded a degree with honours, &quot;(Hons)&quot; may be suffixed to their designatory letters – e.g. BA (Hons), BSc (Hons), BMus (Hons), MA (Hons). An MA (Hons) would generally indicate a degree award from certain Scottish universities (c.f. Scottish MA) and is at the same level as a bachelor&#x27;s degree.

===Distribution of classes===
The Higher Education Statistics Agency (HESA) has published the number of degrees awarded with different classifications since 1994–1995. The relative proportions of different classes have changed over this period, with increasing numbers of students being awarded higher honours. The table below shows the percentage of classified degrees (i.e., not including fails or unclassified degrees such as MBBS) in each class at five-year intervals; note that HESA stopped giving statistics separately for third class honours and pass degree after 2003.


=== First Class Honours ===

First Class Honours, referred to as a &quot;first&quot;, is the highest honours classification and indicates high academic achievement. Historically, First Class Honours were uncommon, but since 2019 a first has been awarded to nearly thirty percent of graduates of British universities. The increase is said by some commentators to be due to student-demanded grade inflation rather than students&#x27; academic ability.

In the early 1990s, First Class Honours went to about 7% of graduates, or about one student in 15. The percentages of graduates achieving a First vary greatly by university and course studied. Students of law are least likely to gain a first, while students of mathematical sciences are most likely to gain a first.

A first class honours degree is sometimes colloquially referred to in rhyming slang as a Geoff Hurst after the English 1966 FIFA World Cup footballer, or as a Damien (after the contemporary artist Damien Hirst).

===Upper Second Class Honours ===

The upper division is commonly abbreviated to &quot;2:1&quot; or &quot;II.i&quot; (pronounced &quot;two-one&quot;). The 2:1 is a minimum requirement for entry to many postgraduate courses in the UK. It is also required for the award of a research council postgraduate studentship in the UK, although a combination of qualifications and experience equal to a 2:1 is also acceptable. This is often interpreted as possession of a master&#x27;s degree (sometimes at merit level or above) in addition to a 2:2 undergraduate degree.

The percentage of candidates who achieve Upper Second Class Honours can vary widely by degree subject, as well as by university.

A 2:1 degree (&quot;two-one&quot;) is sometimes referred to as an &quot;Attila&quot; (after Attila the Hun) or a &quot;Trevor Nunn&quot; in rhyming slang in the UK.

Until 1986 the University of Oxford did not distinguish between upper and lower second-class degrees.

===Lower Second Class honours===
This is the lower division of Second Class degrees and is abbreviated as &quot;2:2&quot; or &#x27;&quot;II.ii&quot; (pronounced &quot;two-two&quot;). It is informally referred to, in rhyming slang, as a &quot;Desmond&quot;, after Desmond Tutu.

===Third Class honours===

Third Class Honours, commonly referred to as a &quot;third&quot;, is the lowest honours classification in most UK universities. Informally, it is referred to as a &quot;gentleman&#x27;s third&quot; (&quot;cf.&quot; the &quot;gentleman&#x27;s C&quot; in U.S. parlance). Slang terms in the UK for a third include a &quot;Richard&quot; (after Richard III), a &quot;Douglas&quot; (after Douglas Hurd, the 1980s Conservative MP who actually graduated with a First Class Honours degree in history), or a &quot;Thora&quot; (after Thora Hird, an English TV actress).

Approximately 3-5% of UK students graduating between 2018 and 2022 were awarded thirds.

===Ordinary degree===
While most university bachelor&#x27;s degree courses lead to honours degrees, some universities offer courses leading to ordinary degrees. Some honours courses permit students who do not gain sufficient credits in a year by a small margin to transfer to a parallel ordinary degree course. Ordinary degrees may also sometimes be awarded to honours degree students who do not pass sufficient credits in their final year to gain an honours degree, but pass enough to earn an ordinary degree.

Some Scottish universities offer three-year ordinary degrees as a qualification in their own right, as well as an honours degree over four years. This is in contrast to English universities that have honours degrees with three years of study. An ordinary degree in Scotland is not a failed honours degree, as in certain English universities. Students can decide, usually at the end of their second or third year, whether or not they wish to complete a fourth honours year. Scottish universities may also award their ordinary degrees with distinction if a student achieves a particularly good grade average, usually 70% or above. A common example of a Scottish ordinary degree is the Bachelor of Laws course taken by graduates of other subjects, as this is sufficient (without honours) for entry into the legal profession.

Until the 1970s the University of Oxford awarded a Fourth Class degree as an equivalent of the ordinary degree.

===&quot;Aegrotat&quot;===
An &quot;aegrotat&quot; (; ) degree is an honours or ordinary degree without classification, awarded to a candidate who was unable to undertake their exams due to illness or even death, under the presumption that, had they completed those exams, they would have satisfied the standard required for that degree. &quot;Aegrotat&quot; degrees are often qualified with an appended &quot;(&quot;aegrotat&quot;)&quot;. Following the introduction of new regulations regarding mitigating circumstances, &quot;aegrotat&quot; degrees are less commonly awarded.

===Incorporation of prior learning===

Degrees may be granted which incorporate prior learning, such as by means of CATS points transfer. Where the substance of incorporated credit exceeds a given threshold, the granting institution may be unable to grade sufficient work to award a degree classification. Any degree granted may then be unclassified.

===Variations in classification===

At the University of Cambridge, undergraduate Tripos examinations are split into one or more Parts, which span either one or two years. Each student receives a formal classification for each Part (i.e. Class I, II.i, II.ii, or III). Until October 2020, officially a grade simply existed for every Part of the degree, not for the overall degree. For students beginning their course of study from October 2020, a final class is awarded across the course of study, according to an algorithm determined by the Tripos. Attaining First Class Honours in two Parts culminates in graduating with a &quot;double first&quot;. It is possible in some Triposes to be awarded a &quot;starred first&quot;, for examination scripts that &quot;consistently exhibit the qualities of first class answers to an exceptional degree.&quot; Some Cambridge alumni who achieved Firsts in three Parts of the Tripos are described by their colleges and others as having achieved a &quot;triple first&quot;.

At the University of Oxford, a formal degree class is awarded, typically based on the final examinations. Examinations for Prelims or Honour Moderations are also undertaken in the first or second year, but their results do not typically affect the final degree classification. Until the 1970s, the four honours divisions in Oxford&#x27;s moderations and final examinations were named first, second, third and fourth class, but from the 1970s onwards, Oxford began to adopt the classification system used by other British universities.

Oxford sometimes grants a congratulatory first, which &quot;The New York Times&quot; described as &quot;a highly unusual honor in which the examining professors ask no questions about the candidate&#x27;s written work but simply stand and applaud&quot; and Martin Amis described as &quot;the sort where you are called in for a &quot;viva&quot; and the examiners tell you how much they enjoyed reading your papers&quot;. A &quot;double first&quot; at Oxford informally refers to First Class Honours in both components of an undergraduate degree, i.e., Moderations or Prelims, and the Final Honours School, or in both the bachelor&#x27;s and master&#x27;s components of an integrated master&#x27;s degree.

At University College London, candidates who perform well beyond the requirements of a standard First Class Honours may be nominated to the Dean&#x27;s List. This is generated once per year and recognises outstanding academic achievement in final examinations. There are no set criteria for nomination to the list, but typically only a small number of students from each faculty are nominated per year. Comparable recognition in other anglophone countries is the award of a University Medal.

Degrees in the UK are mapped to levels of the Frameworks for Higher Education Qualifications of UK Degree-Awarding Bodies (FHEQ), which includes the Framework for Qualifications of Higher Education Institutes in Scotland (FQHEIS), which has an alternative numbering of levels corresponding to those of the Scottish Credit and Qualifications Framework (SCQF). Bachelor&#x27;s degrees (including the Scottish MA, but not including medical degrees, dentistry degrees or degrees in veterinary science) attained in the UK are at FHEQ level 6/FQHEIS level 9 (ordinary) or 10 (honours); master&#x27;s degrees (including integrated master&#x27;s degrees and first degrees in medicine, dentistry and veterinary science) are at FHEQ level 7/FQHEIS level 11, and doctoral degrees are at FHEQ level 8/FQHEIS level 12. Bachelor&#x27;s, master&#x27;s and doctoral degrees map to first, second and third cycle qualifications in the Qualifications Framework of the European Higher Education Area.

==International comparisons==

=== Greece ===
The table below depicts the Greek Grading system while illustrates approximately how the Grades are compared with ECTS and UK grades:
=== France ===
The University of St Andrews gives equivalencies between French and British grades for its study-abroad programme. Equivalencies for the purposes of initial teacher training have also been derived by the UK NARIC for 1st, 2:1 and 2:2 degrees, which do not align with St Andrews&#x27; table.
===South Africa===
The South African Qualifications Authority (SAQA) compares international degrees with local degrees before any international student continues their studies in that country. While the British degree accreditation and classification system allows students to go straight from a three-year bachelor&#x27;s degree onto a master&#x27;s degree (normally requiring a 1st or a 2:1 – those with a 2:2 or a 3rd usually require appropriate professional experience), South Africa does not do so unless the student has proven research capabilities. South African Honours degrees prepare the students to undertake a research-specific degree (in terms of master&#x27;s), by spending an in-depth year (up to five modules) creating research proposals and undertaking a research project of limited scope. This prepares students for the research degrees later in their academic career.

=== Spain ===
The UK NARIC has derived equivalencies for the grades of the Spanish &quot;grado&quot; and &quot;licenciatura&quot; degrees for purposes of initial teacher training bursaries.
===The Netherlands===
The Netherlands organisation for international cooperation in higher education (NUFFIC) has compared UK degree classification to Dutch degree grades. Dutch equivalencies have also been calculated by the UK NARIC.

NUFFIC also noted that the grading culture is different in the Netherlands, so that it is very rare for even the best students in the Netherlands to be awarded a 9 or a 10, which represent near perfection and absolute perfection.

===United States===

US comparison services treat English three-year bachelor&#x27;s degrees and American four-year bachelor&#x27;s degrees as equivalent. Some British sources, such as the Dearing Report, consider British honours degrees equivalent to a US master&#x27;s degree and US bachelor&#x27;s degrees as equivalent to British pass degrees in terms of the standard reached in the major subject, due to the higher degree of specialisation in the UK. However, British institutions generally accept US bachelor&#x27;s degrees for admission to postgraduate study (see below).

In comparing US bachelor&#x27;s degrees to British honours degrees, equivalencies can be expressed in terms of either US grade point averages (GPAs) or letter grades. British institutions normally state equivalence in terms of GPAs. Approximate mappings between British classifications and GPAs can be inferred from the graduate admissions criteria used by British universities, which often give international equivalents. For example, University College London (UCL) equates the minimum classification for entrance to GPAs using 2:1 = 3.3 and 2:2 = 3.0. Different universities convert grades differently: the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE) considers a GPA of 3.5 or better as equivalent to gaining a 2:1, while the department of English Language and Literature at Oxford considers a GPA of &quot;about 3.8&quot; equivalent to a first class degree. Similarly, the UK NARIC gives equivalent GPAs for determining eligibility for teacher training bursaries. Durham University&#x27;s &quot;North American Undergraduate Guide&quot; gives a conversion table as a guide to understanding British classifications (rather than for admission to postgraduate study) of 1st = 3.8–4.0, 2:1 = 3.3–3.7, 2:2 = 2.8–3.2 and 3rd = 2.3–2.7.
The GPA conversions are summarised in the following table:

Letter grade equivalents are more commonly used by American institutions. World Education Services (WES), a nonprofit organisation which provides qualification conversion services to many universities and employers, gives 1st = A, 2:1 = A−/B+, 2:2 = B, 3rd = B−, Pass = C. The Fulbright Commission has also created &quot;an unofficial chart with approximate grade conversions between UK results and US GPA&quot;. The table below summarises these conversions, including GPA equivalents for the WES grades given using the letter grade to GPA conversion of Duke University.

=== Canada ===

Canadian academic grades may be given as letters, percentages, 12-point GPAs or 4-point GPAs. The 4-point GPAs are sometimes seen to differ from the US but other sources treat them as equivalent. The Durham conversion specifies GPAs for the US and letter grades/percentages for Canada while the UK NARIC has separate GPA conversions for the four-year bachelor&#x27;s honours, baccalauréat and professional bachelor&#x27;s degrees (which differ from their US GPA equivalents by at most 0.1) and the three-year bachelor&#x27;s degree (which is seen as a lower standard). The &quot;British Graduate Admissions Fact Sheet&quot; from McGill University uses the conversion 1st = 4.0; 2:1 = 3.0; 2:2 = 2.7; 3rd = 2.0; Pass = 1.0; Fail = 0.0.

=== Australia ===

Some universities, such as those in Australia, offer poll degrees (for instance, as a three-year B.A. or a three-year BSc) by default. The terms &quot;ordinary&quot; or &quot;pass&quot; are not used. High-achieving students may be recognised with an honours classification without further coursework or research, as is often the case in engineering (which often contains a research and thesis component) or law. However, other courses (such as humanities, arts, social sciences, and sciences) and other universities may recognise high-achieving students with an honours classification with further coursework or research, undertaken either concurrently with, and as part of or in addition to, a bachelor&#x27;s course, or after completion of a bachelor&#x27;s course requirements and attaining adequately competitive grades.

Some graduate degrees have been or are classified; however, under the Australian Qualifications Framework (AQF), no graduate-level degrees (i.e., master&#x27;s by coursework, master&#x27;s by research, or higher research degrees) may be classified. To comply with this standard, some institutions have commenced, or will commence, offering high-achieving graduates with &quot;distinction&quot;. Notably, this is consistent with British graduate degree classification.

== Progression to postgraduate study ==

Regulations governing the progression of undergraduate degree graduates to postgraduate programmes vary among universities, and are often flexible. A candidate for a postgraduate master&#x27;s degree is usually required to have at least a 2:1 (or 2:2 in some cases) bachelor honours degree, although candidates with firsts are in a considerably stronger position to gain a place in a postgraduate course and to obtain funding, especially in medical and natural sciences. Some institutions specify a 2:1 minimum for certain types of master&#x27;s program, such as for a Master of Research course.

Candidates with a Third or an Ordinary degree are sometimes accepted, provided they have acquired satisfactory professional experience subsequent to graduation. A candidate for a doctoral programme is nearly always required to have a first or 2:1 at bachelor&#x27;s level.

== Medical degrees ==

In the United Kingdom, medicine is usually taught as an undergraduate course, with graduates being awarded a master&#x27;s level qualification: normally the conjoined degrees of Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery (MBBS, BM BCh, MB ChB, etc.) although at Queen&#x27;s University Belfast (and universities in Ireland) Bachelor in the Art of Obstetrics (BAO) is added, and at some universities only the Bachelor of Medicine is awarded – all of these have equal standing. Unlike most undergraduate degrees, the MBBS is not normally considered an honours degree, and thus is not classified into first class honours, etc. Students may be awarded &quot;Merits&quot; and &quot;Distinctions&quot; for parts of the course or the whole course (depending on the institution) and &quot;Honours&quot; may be awarded at some institutions for exceptional performance throughout the course (as a grade above Distinction).

Medical schools split their year groups into 10 deciles. These deciles are the major factor in the calculation of Educational Performance Measure (EPM) points used as part of medical students&#x27; Foundation Programme applications, with the top decile receiving 43 points, decreasing by a point for each decile (so the lowest gets 34 points); 7 points can be awarded for other educational achievements (other degrees and publications), and the EPM points are combined with up to 50 points from the Situational Judgement Test to give a total out of 100.

== Grade point average ==

Following the recommendation of the Burgess report into the honours degree classification system in 2007, the Higher Education Academy ran a pilot in 2013–2014 in collaboration with 21 institutions delivering higher education (ranging from Russell Group universities to Further Education colleges) to investigate how a grade point average (GPA) system would work best in Britain. Two main weighting systems were tested: an American-style average of all marks, weighted only by credit value, and weighting by &quot;exit velocity&quot; in the manner of the honours classification, where modules in the first year are given a low or zero weight and modules in the final year have a higher weight (a third model was only rarely used). Over two-thirds of providers preferred exit-velocity weighting to the straight average.

A GPA scale, tied to percentage marks and letter grades, was recommended for use nationally following the study, to run in parallel with the honours degree classification system. However, a Universities UK and Guild HE report in 2017 found that adoption had been slow, further uptake in the future was unlikely, and the envisaged benefits had not been delivered. Problems encountered included a lack of awareness among employers and students, meaning that where it was introduced it was typically in parallel to instead of in place of traditional degree classifications. Of the 19 institutions who had introduced GPA or had plans to do so, 12 had adopted the HEA-recommended scale while the others had adopted or planned to adopt a different scale. This, together with differences in whether modules were weighted equally (10/19) or differently (9/19) and other differences in design and implementation, meant that GPA scores were not likely to be easily comparable between institutions.

<text>Hornworts are a group of non-vascular Embryophytes (land plants) constituting the division Anthocerotophyta (). The common name refers to the elongated horn-like structure, which is the sporophyte. As in mosses and liverworts, hornworts have a gametophyte-dominant life cycle, in which cells of the plant carry only a single set of genetic information; the flattened, green plant body of a hornwort is the gametophyte stage of the plant.

Hornworts may be found worldwide, though they tend to grow only in places that are damp or humid. Some species grow in large numbers as tiny weeds in the soil of gardens and cultivated fields. Large tropical and sub-tropical species of &quot;Dendroceros&quot; may be found growing on the bark of trees.

The total number of species is still uncertain. While there are more than 300 published species names, the actual number could be as low as 100–150 species.

==Description ==
Like all bryophytes, the dominant life phase of a hornwort is the haploid gametophyte. This stage usually grows as a thin rosette or ribbon-like thallus between one and five centimeters in diameter. Hornworts have lost two plastid division-associated genes, ARC3 and FtsZ2, and have just a single chloroplast per cell (monoplastidy), with the exception of the genus &quot;Megaceros&quot; and some species in the genera &quot;Nothoceros&quot; and &quot;Anthoceros&quot;, which have more than one chloroplast per cell (polyplastidy). In the polyplastidic species, and also some of the monoplastidic species, a cellular structure called a pyrenoid is absent. The pyrenoid is a liquid-like organelle which enables a more efficient photosynthesis, has evolved independently five to six times in hornworts and is present in half of the roughly 200 species. It is formed by the fusion of the chloroplast with other organelles and is composed predominantly of RuBisCO, the key enzyme in carbon fixation. By using inorganic carbon transporters and carbonic anhydrases, up to a 50-fold increase in levels can be achieved. This particular feature is very unusual in land plants, unique to hornworts, but is common among algae. They are also the only group of land plants where flavonoids are completely absent.

Many hornworts develop internal mucilage-filled cavities or canals when groups of cells break down. These cavities secrete hormogonium-inducing factors (HIF) that stimulate nearby, free-living photosynthetic cyanobacteria, especially species of &quot;Nostoc&quot;, to invade and colonize these cavities. Such colonies of bacteria growing inside the thallus give the hornwort a distinctive blue-green color. Symbiotic cyanobacteria have not been reported in &quot;Megaceros&quot; or &quot;Folioceros&quot;. There may also be small &quot;slime pores&quot; on the underside of the thallus. These pores superficially resemble the stomata of other plants.

The horn-shaped sporophyte grows from an archegonium embedded deep in the gametophyte. The growth of the hornwort sporophyte happens from a persistent basal meristem, in contrast to the sporophyte of moss (apical growth) and liverworts (intercalary growth). Unlike liverworts, hornworts have true stomata on their sporophyte as most mosses do. The exceptions are the species &quot;Folioceros incurvus&quot;, the genus &quot;Notothylas&quot; and the three closely related genera &quot;Megaceros&quot;, &quot;Nothoceros&quot; and &quot;Dendroceros&quot;, which do not have stomata. &quot;Notothylas&quot; also differ from other hornworts in having a reduced sporophyte only a few millimeters tall. The sporophyte in hornworts is unique among bryophytes in being long-lived with a persistent photosynthetic capacity. The sporophyte lacks an apical meristem, an auxin-sensitive point of divergence with other land plants some time in the Late Silurian/Early Devonian.

When the sporophyte is mature, it has a multicellular outer layer, a central rod-like columella running up the center, and a layer of tissue in between that produces spores and pseudo-elaters. The pseudo-elaters are multi-cellular, unlike the elaters of liverworts. They have helical thickenings that change shape in response to drying out; they twist and thereby help to disperse the spores. Hornwort spores are relatively large for bryophytes, measuring between 30 and 80 μm in diameter or more. The spores are polar, usually with a distinctive Y-shaped tri-radiate ridge on the proximal surface, and with a distal surface ornamented with bumps or spines.

== Life cycle ==

The life of a hornwort starts from a haploid spore. The spores can be yellow, brown or green. Yellow and brown spores have a thicker wall and contain oils that both protect against desiccation and function as a nutrient storage, allowing them to survive for years. The species &quot;Folioceros fuciformis&quot; and the genera &quot;Megaceros&quot;, &quot;Nothoceros&quot; and &quot;Dendroceros&quot; have short-lived spores with thin and colorless walls that appear green due to the presence of a chloroplast. In most species, there is a single cell inside the spore, and a slender extension of this cell called the &quot;germ tube&quot; germinates from the proximal side of the spore. The tip of the germ tube divides to form an octant (solid geometry) of cells, and the first rhizoid grows as an extension of the original germ cell. The tip continues to divide new cells, which produces a thalloid protonema. By contrast, species of the family Dendrocerotaceae may begin dividing within the spore, becoming multicellular and even photosynthetic before the spore germinates. In either case, the protonema is a transitory stage in the life of a hornwort.

From the protonema grows the adult gametophyte, which is the persistent and independent stage in the life cycle. This stage usually grows as a thin rosette or ribbon-like thallus between one and five centimeters in diameter, and several layers of cells in thickness. It is green or yellow-green from the chlorophyll in its cells, or bluish-green when colonies of cyanobacteria grow inside the plant.

When the gametophyte has grown to its adult size, it produces the sex organs of the hornwort. Most plants are monoecious, with both sex organs on the same plant, but some plants (even within the same species) are dioecious, with separate male and female gametophytes. The female organs are known as archegonia (singular archegonium) and the male organs are known as antheridia (singular antheridium). Both kinds of organs develop just below the surface of the plant and are only later exposed by disintegration of the overlying cells.

The biflagellate sperm must swim from the antheridia, or else be splashed to the archegonia. When this happens, the sperm and egg cell fuse to form a zygote, the cell from which the sporophyte stage of the life cycle will develop. Unlike all other bryophytes, the first cell division of the zygote is longitudinal. Further divisions produce three basic regions of the sporophyte.

At the bottom of the sporophyte (closest to the interior of the gametophyte), is a foot. This is a globular group of cells that receives nutrients from the parent gametophyte, on which the sporophyte will spend its entire existence. In the middle of the sporophyte (just above the foot), is a meristem that will continue to divide and produce new cells for the third region. This third region is the capsule. Both the central and surface cells of the capsule are sterile, but between them is a layer of cells that will divide to produce pseudo-elaters and spores. These are released from the capsule when it splits lengthwise from the tip.

==Evolutionary history==

While the fossil record of crown group hornworts only begins in the upper Cretaceous, the lower Devonian &quot;Horneophyton&quot; may represent a stem group to the clade, as it possesses a sporangium with central columella not attached at the roof. However, the same form of columella is also characteristic of basal moss groups, such as the Sphagnopsida and Andreaeopsida, and has been interpreted as a character common to all early land plants with stomata. The divergence between hornworts and Setaphyta (mosses and liverworts) is estimated to have occurred 479–450 million years ago, and the last common ancestor of present-day hornworts lived in middle Permian about 275 million years ago. Chromosome-scale genome sequencing of three hornwort species corroborates that stomata evolved only once during land plant evolution. It also shows that the three groups of bryophytes share a common ancestor that branched off from the other landplants early in evolution, and that liverworts and mosses are more closely related to each other than to hornworts. Unlike other land plants, the hornwort genome has the low- inducible B gene (LCIB), which is also found in some species of algae. Because the diffusion rate of carbon dioxide is 10,000-fold higher in air than in water, aquatic algae require a mechanism to concentrate CO2 in chloroplasts so as to allow the photosynthetic RuBisCo protein to function efficiently. LCIB is one component of this CO2-concentrating mechanism.

== Classification ==
Hornworts were traditionally considered a class within the division Bryophyta (bryophytes). Later on, the bryophytes were considered paraphyletic, and hence the hornworts were given their own division, Anthocerotophyta (sometimes misspelled Anthocerophyta). However, the most recent phylogenetic evidence leans strongly towards bryophyte monophyly, and it has been proposed that hornworts are de-ranked to the original class Anthocerotopsida.

Traditionally, there was a single class of hornworts, called Anthocerotopsida, or older Anthocerotae. More recently, a second class Leiosporocertotopsida has been segregated for the singularly unusual species &quot;Leiosporoceros dussii&quot;. All other hornworts remain in the class Anthocerotopsida. These two classes are divided further into five orders, each containing a single family.

Among land plants, hornworts are one of the earliest-diverging lineages of the early land plant ancestors; cladistic analysis implies that the group originated prior to the Devonian, around the same time as the mosses and liverworts. There are about 200 species known, but new species are still being discovered. The number and names of genera are a current matter of investigation, and several competing classification schemes have been published since 1988.

Structural features that have been used in the classification of hornworts include: the anatomy of chloroplasts and their numbers within cells, the presence of a pyrenoid, the numbers of antheridia within androecia, and the arrangement of jacket cells of the antheridia.
=== Phylogeny ===
Recent studies of molecular, ultrastructural, and morphological data have yielded a new classification of hornworts.

<text>OctaMED is a music tracker for the Amiga, written by Teijo Kinnunen. The first version, 1.12, was released in 1989 under the name MED, which stands for Music EDitor. In April 1990, version 2.00 was released with MIDI support as the main improvement. In 1991 the first version with the name OctaMED was released, so-called as it could replay eight independent channels on the Amiga&#x27;s four-channel sound chip. This was also the first commercial version of the software. The publisher had previously been RBF Software of Southampton, UK which was run by Ray Burt-Frost. The current publisher is A-EON Technology Ltd.

==History==
The distinguishing feature of MED and OctaMED in comparison to other music trackers on the Amiga was that MED and OctaMED had native MIDI support for external instruments via the Amiga&#x27;s serial port – this allowed many musicians to sequence a combination of outboard studio equipment and internally generated sounds to create studio quality releases such as &quot;I Created Disco&quot; by Calvin Harris.

OctaMED was chiefly used by musicians to create stand-alone works, rather than by game or demo musicians to make tunes that play in the context of a computer game or demo.

Firstly, this is because the MED and OctaMED music replay routine is simply too slow to be used in a game or demo. Most trackers are optimized for speed of replay code, taking less than 3% of CPU time. MED took roughly 40% of CPU time. Secondly, and this is also one of the reasons why MED draws more CPU power, the MED format allowed a greater degree of complexity in music construction, with arbitrary length of pattern sheets, sections and blocks rather than a simple pattern-list, and a greater number of effects for the sound. This additional complexity was welcomed by music composers, who preferred more sophisticated structure to their compositions and did not see it as a simple list of timed note-presses.

The technique of playing more channels of music than the Amiga hardware was capable of was first introduced with Jochen Hippel&#x27;s &quot;Hippel 7V&quot; routine, which used code initially developed for the Atari ST to perform software mixing of 4 channels to a single output, played back alongside the remaining three Amiga hardware sound channels. The seven-channel routine then appeared in a tracker called TFMX. Finally, the routine was optimized so it could mix an additional channel, resulting in eight channels of sound. This playback method was suited for instances where a number of samples that don&#x27;t require fidelity can be played through the software mixed channel, and cleaner samples through the remaining three hardware channels.

OctaMED took a different approach, where two software-mixed channels are played through each of the four hardware audio channels. This brings some limitations, such as paired software channels sharing some effects such as hardware volume control, the higher-quality playback routine requires a more powerful CPU, and some louder samples can sound distorted due to limitations in the mixing process.

OctaMED was developed by Teijo Kinnunen on the Amiga until 1996. His last version, called OctaMED Soundstudio, had features like MIDI file support, ARexx support, support for 16-bit and stereo samples, hard disk recording, and support for up to 64 channels.

Teijo Kinnunen handed over the development of OctaMED to other programmers soon after the final Amiga version was released. The new programmers later released a Windows port, but the lack of features and presence of noticeable bugs meant this edition did not achieve the same level of fame as the Amiga release. More versions of the Windows port were later released. It was subsequently renamed to MED Soundstudio, and has had several releases under that name.

A later approach to extend the features of the Amiga version of OctaMED was performed by Kjetil Matheussen starting in 1997. By hacking the binary he managed to make a more low-level plugin system than was already available via the ARexx language. With the help of NSM (an open source patching and plug-in system for OctaMED) the users could now get access to the CAMD MIDI library, 48-channel MIDI interfaces, signal processing plugins for the sample editor, interaction with the sequencer Bars&amp;Pipes, and many other esoteric features, far extending the features offered for the commercial Windows version of OctaMED.

In February 2015 A-EON Technology Ltd acquired the rights to OctaMED for Amiga and Amiga-like next generation systems from RBF Software.

In January 2024 active development of the Amiga source code was resumed by AmigaKit Ltd on behalf of A-EON Technology Ltd. OctaMED was updated primarily for inclusion in AmigaKit&#x27;s A600GS computer system. It is also supplied pre-installed on the forthcoming A1200NG computer system. The latest OctaMED 8 for the A600GS and A1200NG adds important features such as AHI driver support, CAMD Midi Library support and MIDI hardware support for the A600GS. Further GUI enhancements are planned.

The official OctaMED Amiga forum was opened for users in May 2024 in advance of the new OctaMED 8 release. 

Former version is available for Windows and AmigaOS platforms, called MED SoundStudio.

<text>Urban contemporary music, also known as urban music, urban pop, or just simply urban, is a music radio format. The term was coined by New York radio DJ Frankie Crocker in the early to mid-1970s as a synonym for Black music. Urban contemporary radio stations feature a playlist made up entirely of Black genres such as R&amp;B, pop rap, quiet storm, urban adult contemporary, hip hop, Latin music such as Latin pop, Chicano R&amp;B and Chicano rap, and Caribbean music such as reggae and soca. Urban contemporary was developed through the characteristics of genres such as R&amp;B and soul.

Because urban music is a largely U.S. phenomenon, virtually all urban contemporary formatted radio stations in the United States are located in cities that have sizeable African-American populations, such as New York City; Washington, D.C.; Detroit; Atlanta; Miami; Chicago; Cleveland; Philadelphia; Montgomery; Memphis; St. Louis; Newark; Charleston; New Orleans; Milwaukee; Cincinnati; Dallas; Houston; Oakland; Sacramento; Los Angeles; Trenton; Columbia; Jacksonville; Flint; Baltimore; Boston; Birmingham; Indianapolis; Charlotte; Savannah; Hartford; and Jackson.

Urban contemporary music includes the more contemporary elements of R&amp;B and may incorporate production elements found in urban Euro-pop, urban rock, and urban alternative.

==Summary==
The term urban contemporary music is heavily associated with African-American music, particularly with R&amp;B in African-American contexts. For Latin Americans, reggaeton and Latin hip hop are considered &quot;Latin urban&quot; due to influence of above mentioned genres.

Urban contemporary playlists are dominated by singles by top-selling hip hop and R&amp;B performers. On occasion, an urban contemporary station will play classic soul songs from the 1970s and early 1980s to satisfy the earlier end of the genre.

Many urban-formatted radio stations, such as KJLH, KPRS, KMEL, KDAY, KRNB, and WVEE, play gospel music or urban contemporary gospel music on Sundays.

Mainstream urban is a branch of urban contemporary, and rhythmic contemporary is also a branch.

==History==
===The 1970s===
In 1971, Frankie Crocker would combine all the elements of his background, with jazz and R&amp;B. When Frankie Crocker was appointed as program director of the newly created WBLS in 1974, he created an eclectic music mix of R&amp;B and disco redefining the R&amp;B format as &quot;urban contemporary&quot;. In 1975, WDMT in Cleveland began programming a mix of R&amp;B, disco, and rap. The station featured live street jocks mixing vinyl records each night. The station&#x27;s popularity grew and in 1980, it was Arbitron rated No. 2 12+, just behind the No. 1 rated WMMS with the original &quot;Morning Zoo&quot;.

===The 1980s===
In 1983, WBLS in New York City was the first station to air a rap radio show, &quot;Rap Attack&quot; with Mr. Magic and Marley Marl. Freddie Jackson and Luther Vandross were popular in urban contemporary music scene. Late 1980s, Luther Vandross, Freddy Jackson, and Whitney Houston were popular in this genre.

During the early 1980s as newly formed WRKS-FM (98.7 Kiss FM) became the first rap station in the United States, WBLS quickly began adding more rap songs to its playlists. The urban format by this time was redefined by an eclectic mix of R&amp;B, rap, reggae, dance, house, and freestyle. WBLS continued as the flagship station of the urban format; however, Kiss FM surpassed them in the ratings.

Another successful early urban outlet was WDRQ in Detroit, which switched from a top 40 format in the spring of 1982 and made a #2 showing 12+ in its first Arbitron ratings book. In addition to rap, R&amp;B and dance music, WDRQ featured mainstream pop music with a danceable beat from artists.

Many radio stations imitated the urban sound since it was proven to be more profitable than other formats and had proven itself more adept than straightforward black-targeted R&amp;B formats at attracting white and Latino listeners. 

Late in the decade, WVAZ Chicago and WALR Atlanta became some of the first adult R&amp;B stations, playing artists that appealed to adults rather than rap or other styles that young people enjoyed.

Another subformat of urban contemporary is rhythmic contemporary hits. Stations playing rhythmic contemporary hits plays a great deal of dance music; however, hip-hop has become increasingly popular in the format in recent years. WQHT-FM (Hot 97) and KPWR (Power 106) were the first stations to utilize this format.

===1990s–present===

Since the 1990s, as urban contemporary hits have dominated the US pop charts, many top 40 stations have turned to playing tracks popular on urban contemporary radio stations.

Following periods of fluctuating success, urban music attained commercial dominance during the early 2000s, which featured massive crossover success on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts by R&amp;B and hip hop artists. In 2004, all 12 songs that topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 were African-American recording artists and accounted for 80% of the number-one R&amp;B hits that year. Along with Usher&#x27;s streak of singles, top 40 radio and both pop and R&amp;B charts were topped by OutKast&#x27;s &quot;Hey Ya!&quot;, Snoop Dogg&#x27;s &quot;Drop It Like It&#x27;s Hot&quot;, Terror Squad&#x27;s &quot;Lean Back&quot; and Ciara&#x27;s &quot;Goodies&quot;. Chris Molanphy of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; later remarked that by the early 2000s, urban music &quot;was&quot; pop music.

In late-mid of the decade, KRNB Dallas signed on as an R&amp;B and classic soul station.

By the late 2000s, urban music had taken a backseat on top 40 radio to mainstream EDM sounds, and several successful urban artists, including Rihanna, Chris Brown, Ciara, Usher, Nicole Scherzinger, Akon, Trey Songz, Pitbull, Flo Rida, and Ne-Yo, were making EDM records for top 40 airplay while continuing to make hip hop or pure R&amp;B records for urban airplay. Pure urban formats continue to be successful in markets with large African-American populations, while medium or smaller markets are more likely to feature urban music through the subset of rhythmic contemporary stations with danceable mainstream hits mixed in.

The Grammy Award for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration has been awarded since 2002.

==Name controversy==
In 2020, members of the music industry voiced disagreement over the use of the term &quot;urban&quot; in describing music genres and formats, especially among African-American artists who see the term as a &quot;catchall for music created by black artists, regardless of genre&quot;. Contributing to the debate, Lance Venta of radio industry publication &quot;RadioInsight&quot; claimed that the term &quot;urban&quot; was outdated in that hip hop and R&amp;B music had gained massive popularity outside the inner cities and the descriptor should not serve as a euphemism for &quot;black music&quot;. He recommended substituting the terms &quot;hip hop&quot; for the urban contemporary format and &quot;adult R&amp;B&quot; for urban adult contemporary. Tyler, the Creator also spoke out, stating &quot;[i]t sucks that whenever we — and I mean guys that look like me — do anything that&#x27;s genre-bending or that&#x27;s anything, they always put it in a rap or urban category&quot;, adding that &quot;I don&#x27;t like that &#x27;urban&#x27; word — it&#x27;s just a politically correct way to say the n-word to me&quot;.

Myron Fears, operations manager and program director of the black owned Carter Broadcast Group in Kansas City, defended the use of the &quot;urban&quot; tag. Responding to Republic&#x27;s elimination of the term, he expressed concern that the action diminishes the status of black music executives within record companies and the industry as a whole:
In the wake of the murder of George Floyd and the subsequent protests, a number of institutions dropped the term &quot;urban&quot; in favor of other terms. In June 2020, Republic Records and artist management company Milk &amp; Honey stated that they would drop the use of the word in relation to music of a black origin. That same month, the National Academy for Recording Arts and Sciences renamed and redefined the Grammy Award for Best Urban Contemporary Album with Best Progressive R&amp;B Album, &quot;to appropriately categorize and describe this subgenre. This change includes a more accurate definition to describe the merit or characteristics of music compositions or performances themselves within the genre of R&amp;B&quot;. They also renamed the Best Latin Pop or Urban Album to Best Latin Pop Album, while changing the name of the Latin Rock, Urban or Alternative Album to Best Latin Rock or Alternative Album.

<text>Spirulina is the dried biomass of cyanobacteria (blue-green algae) that can be consumed by humans and animals. The three species are &quot;Arthrospira platensis&quot;, &quot;A. fusiformis&quot;, and &quot;A. maxima&quot;.

Cultivated worldwide, &quot;Arthrospira&quot; is used as a dietary supplement or whole food. It is also used as a feed supplement in the aquaculture, aquarium, and poultry industries.

== Use of the term and differences between species ==
The species &quot;A. maxima&quot; and &quot;A. platensis&quot; were once classified in the genus &quot;Spirulina&quot;. The common name, spirulina, refers to the dried biomass of &quot;A. platensis&quot;, which belongs to photosynthetic bacteria that cover the groups Cyanobacteria and Prochlorophyta. Scientifically, a distinction exists between spirulina and the genus &quot;Arthrospira&quot;. Species of &quot;Arthrospira&quot; have been isolated from alkaline brackish and saline waters in tropical and subtropical regions. Among the various species included in the genus &quot;Arthrospira&quot;, &quot;A. platensis&quot; is the most widely distributed and is mainly found in Africa, but also in Asia. &quot;A. maxima&quot; is believed to be found in California and Mexico. The term &quot;spirulina&quot; remains in use for historical reasons.

&quot;Arthrospira&quot; species are free-floating, filamentous cyanobacteria characterized by cylindrical, multicellular trichomes in an open left-handed helix. They occur naturally in tropical and subtropical lakes with high pH and high concentrations of carbonate and bicarbonate. &quot;A. platensis&quot; occurs in Africa, Asia, and South America, whereas &quot;A. maxima&quot; is confined to Central America. Most cultivated spirulina is produced in open-channel raceway ponds, with paddle wheels used to agitate the water.

Spirulina thrives at a pH around 8.5 and above and a temperature around . They are autotrophic, meaning that they are able to make their own food, and do not need a living energy or organic carbon source. A nutrient feed for growing it is:

* Baking soda 
* Potassium nitrate 
* Sea salt- 
* Potassium phosphate 
* Iron sulphate 
==Historical use==
Spirulina was a food source for the Aztecs and other Mesoamericans until the 16th century; the harvest from Lake Texcoco in Mexico and subsequent sale as cakes were described by one of Cortés&#x27;s soldiers. The Aztecs called it &quot;tecuitlatl&quot;.

Spirulina was found in abundance at Lake Texcoco by French researchers in the 1960s, but no reference to its use by the Aztecs as a daily food source was made after the 16th century, probably because of the draining of the surrounding lakes for agriculture and urban development. The topic of &quot;tecuitlatl&quot;, which was discovered in 1520, was not mentioned again until 1940, when the Belgian phycologist Pierre Dangeard mentioned a cake called &quot;dihe&quot; consumed by the Kanembu tribe, who harvest it from Lake Chad in the African nation of Chad. Dangeard studied the &quot;dihe&quot; samples and found it to be a dried puree of the spring form of the blue-green algae from the lake. The &quot;dihe&quot; is used to make broths for meals, and also sold in markets. The spirulina is harvested from small lakes and ponds around Lake Chad.

During 1964 and 1965, the botanist Jean Leonard confirmed that &quot;dihe&quot; is made up of spirulina, and later studied a bloom of algae in a sodium hydroxide production facility. As a result, the first systematic and detailed study of the growth requirements and physiology of spirulina was performed as a basis for establishing large-scale production in the 1970s.

== Food and nutrition ==

Spirulina is being investigated to address food security and malnutrition, and as dietary support in long-term space flight or Mars missions. Its advantage for food security is that it needs less land and water than livestock to produce protein and energy.

Dried spirulina contains 5% water, 24% carbohydrates, 8% fat, and about 60% (51–71%) protein.

An amount of 100g of spirulina in supplement form as a dried powder supplies and is a rich source (20% or more of the Daily Value, DV) of numerous essential nutrients, particularly protein, B vitamins (thiamin, riboflavin, and niacin, providing 207%, 306%, and 85% DV, respectively), and dietary minerals, such as iron (219% DV) and manganese (90% DV). The lipid content of spirulina is 8% by weight providing the fatty acids, gamma-linolenic acid, linoleic acid, stearidonic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), and arachidonic acid. In contrast to those 2003 estimates (of DHA and EPA each at 2 to 3% of total fatty acids), 2015 research indicated that spirulina products &quot;contained no detectable omega-3 fatty acids&quot; (less than 0.1%, including DHA and EPA).

===Vitamin B12===
Spirulina contains no vitamin B12 naturally, and spirulina supplements are not considered a reliable source of vitamin B12, as they contain predominantly pseudovitamin B12 (Coα-[α-(7-adenyl)]-Coβ-cyanocobamide), which is biologically inactive in humans. In a 2009 position paper on vegetarian diets, the American Dietetic Association stated that spirulina is not a reliable source of active vitamin B12. The medical literature similarly advises that spirulina is unsuitable as a source of B12.

=== Animals and aquaculture ===
Various studies on spirulina as an alternative feed for animal and aquaculture have been done. Spirulina can be fed up to 10% for poultry and less than 4% for quail. An increase in spirulina content up to for 16 days in 21-day-old broiler male chicks resulted in yellow and red coloration of flesh, possibly due to the accumulation of the yellow pigment zeaxanthin. Pigs and rabbits can receive up to 10% of the feed and increase in the spirulina content in cattle resulted in increase in milk yield and weight. Spirulina has been established as an alternative feedstock and immune booster for bigmouth buffalo, milk fish, cultured striped jack, carp, red sea bream, tilapia, catfish, yellow tail, zebrafish, shrimp, and abalone, and up to 2% spirulina per day in aquaculture feed can be safely recommended.

==Research==
According to the U.S. National Institutes of Health, scientific evidence is insufficient to recommend spirulina supplementation for any human condition, and more research is needed to clarify whether consumption yields any benefits. Administration of spirulina has been investigated as a way to control glucose in people with diabetes, but the European Food Safety Authority rejected those claims in 2013. Spirulina has been studied as a potential nutritional supplement for adults and children affected by HIV, but there was no conclusive effect on risk of death, body weight, or immune response.

==Risks==
Spirulina may have adverse interactions when taken with prescription drugs, particularly those affecting the immune system and blood clotting.

=== Safety and toxicology ===

A number of cyanobacteria, of which spirulina is one, produce toxins such as microcystins. Some spirulina supplements have been found to be contaminated with microcystins, albeit at levels below the limit set by the Oregon Health Department. Microcystins can cause gastrointestinal upset, such as diarrhea, flatulence, headache, muscle pain, facial flushing, and sweating. Chronic exposure may lead to liver damage. The effects of chronic exposure to even low levels of microcystins are a concern due to the risk of toxicity to several organ systems.

These toxic compounds are not produced by spirulina itself, but can occur if spirulina batches are contaminated with other, toxin-producing, blue-green algae. Because the U.S. considers spirulina a dietary supplement, its government does not regulate its production and enforces no safety standards for its production or purity. The U.S. National Institutes of Health describes spirulina supplements as &quot;possibly safe&quot;, provided they are free of microcystin contamination, but &quot;likely unsafe&quot; (especially for children) if contaminated. Given the lack of regulatory standards in the U.S., some public-health researchers have raised the concern that consumers cannot be certain that spirulina and other blue-green algae supplements are free of contamination. In 2016, a review by Health Canada of available literature found that spirulina products contained varying levels of microcystins. Health Canada restricts microcystin-LR levels in products containing cyanobacteria to 0.02 μg per kilogram of body weight per day in finished products, or a maximum of 1 part per million in raw materials.

Heavy-metal contamination of spirulina supplements has also raised concern. The Chinese State Food and Drug Administration reported that lead, mercury, and arsenic contamination was widespread in spirulina supplements marketed in China. One study reported the presence of lead up to 5.1 ppm in a sample from a commercial supplement. Spirulina doses of 10 to 19 grams per day over several months have been used safely.

=== Safety issues for certain target groups ===
Like all protein-rich foods, spirulina contains the essential amino acid phenylalanine (2.6–4.1 g/100 g), which should be avoided by people who have phenylketonuria, a rare genetic disorder that prevents the body from metabolizing phenylalanine, which then builds up in the brain, causing damage.

Microcystins have various potential toxicity, especially to children and pregnant women, including liver damage, shock, and death.

In 2024, a literature review on the allergic properties of spirulina was published. It was noted that to date (by July 2023), there have been 5 cases of allergy to spirulina, with 4 out of 5 cases resulting in anaphylaxis according to the classification from the World Allergy Organization&#x27;s Anaphylaxis Guidance of 2020. Based on their research findings, instances of spirulina allergy are infrequently reported or identified, potentially due to spirulina&#x27;s ability to inhibit mast cell degranulation, a critical component of allergic reactions.

<text>Penrith (, ) is a market town and civil parish in the Westmorland and Furness district of Cumbria, England. It is less than outside the Lake District National Park and about south of Carlisle. It is between the Rivers Petteril and Eamont and just north of the River Lowther. The town had a population of 15,181 at the 2011 census. It is part of historic Cumberland.

From 1974 to 2015, it was an unparished area with no local council. A civil parish was reintroduced on 1 April 2015 with the first election for Penrith Town Council on 7 May 2015. The town was previously part of the 1974-created Eden District until 2023.

==Toponymy==

The etymology of &quot;Penrith&quot; has been debated. Several writers argue for the Cumbric or Welsh &quot;head, chief, end&quot; (both noun and adjective) with the Cumbric , Welsh &quot;ford&quot;, to mean &quot;chief ford&quot;, &quot;hill ford&quot;, &quot;ford end&quot;, or Whaley&#x27;s suggestion: &quot;the head of the ford&quot; or &quot;headland by the ford&quot;.

The centre of Penrith, however, lies about from the nearest crossing of the River Eamont at Eamont Bridge. An alternative has been suggested consisting of the same element meaning &quot;head, end, top&quot; + the equivalent of Welsh &quot;crimson&quot;. Research on the medieval spelling variants of Penrith also suggests this alternative etymology. The name &quot;red hill&quot; may refer to Beacon Hill, to the north-east of today&#x27;s town. There is also a place called Redhills to the south-west, near the M6 motorway, and a place called Penruddock, about west of Penrith. These names all reflect the local geology, as red sandstone is abundant in the area and was used for many buildings in Penrith.

==Prehistory==
The origins of Penrith go far back in time. There is archaeological evidence of &quot;early, concentrated and continuous settlement&quot; in the 
area. The Neolithic (c. 4500–2350 BCE) or early-Bronze Age (c. 2500–1000 BCE) sites at nearby Mayburgh Henge, King Arthur&#x27;s Round Table, Little Round Table, Long Meg and Her Daughters, and Little Meg, and the stone circles at Leacet Hill and Oddendale are some of the visible traces of &quot;one of the most important groups of prehistoric ritual sites in the region.&quot; In addition there have been various finds (stone axes, hammers, knives) and carvings found in the Penrith area.

For the Celtic (Iron Age) era (c. 800 BCE – 100 CE), nearby Clifton Dykes has been proposed as the centre of the Carvetti tribe, due to the large enclosure discovered there and assumptions about the strategic position of the Penrith area in the communications systems running north–south through the Eden Valley and east–west across Stainmore.

===Roman period===

Penrith itself was not established by the Romans, but they recognised the strategic importance of the place, especially near the confluence of the rivers Eamont and Lowther, where the Roman road crossing the Pennines (the present A66) came through. In doing so, they built the fort at Brougham (Brocavum) along with another road (the present A6) going north over Beacon Hill to the large fort at Plumpton (Voreda) – and from there northwards to Carlisle (Luguvallium). Brocavum may also have been built in order to have a military presence close to the centre of the Carvetti.

The Roman fort of Voreda occupied the site now known as &quot;Old Penrith&quot;, five miles north of the town. The 18th-century antiquarian and vicar of Penrith, Dr.Hugh Todd, speculated that the Ala I Petriana may have been stationed there, giving its name to the subsequent town, but see the &quot;Toponymy&quot; section above.
The Roman road from Manchester to Carlisle ran through the area. Excavations before an extension to Penrith Cemetery showed the road had survived better at the edges of the field. The cobble and gravel surfaces seemed to have been ploughed out at the centre. The road was constructed by excavating a wide, shallow trench below subsoil level. Large cobbles were probably obtained nearby, as they did not appear frequently in the subsoil in the excavated area. They were added to the excavated subsoil dumped back into the cut to form a stable foundation, canted at the centre of the road.

The two forts close to where Penrith is today would have had a vicus, an ad-hoc civilian settlement nearby, where farmers supplying food to the forts, and traders and others supplying goods and services lived and died. There is evidence of continuous settlement throughout the Roman period and into the post-Roman era.

==History==
Penrith&#x27;s history has been defined primarily by its strategic position on vital north–south and east–west communications routes. This was especially important in its early history, when Anglo-Scottish relations were fraught. Furthermore, Penrith was a Crown possession in its early phase, though often granted to favoured noble families. It did not become a chartered borough or a municipal corporation and had no representation in Parliament. It also gained growth from its proximity to the Inglewood Forest and to the fertile Eden valley, and largely depended upon agriculture, especially cattle rearing and droving.

===Early medieval period===
After the departure of the Romans (c. 450 CE), the north became a patchwork of warring Celtic tribes (Hen Ogledd). One of these may have been Rheged, perhaps with a centre in the Eden valley and covering the area formerly held by the Carvetti. However, this has been disputed by historians. The Rheged Centre, just outside Penrith, commemorates the name.

During the 7th century, the region was invaded by the Angles, a Germanic tribe which moved west from Northumbria. The Celtic place-names in the region such as Penrith, Blencow, Culgaith, Penruddock, were now joined by settlements ending in &quot;-ham&quot; (estate) and &quot;-ton&quot; (farm), such as Askham, Barton, Clifton, Plumpton and Stainton.

From about 870, the area became subject to Viking settlement by Norse from Dublin and the Hebrides, along with Danes from Yorkshire. Settlements with names ending in &quot;-by&quot; (&quot;village&quot;) and &quot;-thorpe&quot; (&quot;hamlet&quot;) were largely on higher ground – the Vikings were pastoralists, the Angles arable farmers. Examples are Melkinthorpe, Langwathby, Lazonby, and Ousby. Little and Great Dockray (not to be confused with the nearby village Dockray) in Penrith itself are Norse names.

The Penrith Hoard of Viking silver brooches was found in the Eden valley at Flusco Pike, Penrith, as were 253 pieces of silver at Lupton. 
Two cross-shafts and four hogbacks, along with a small cross found immediately to the west of St Andrew&#x27;s Church, known as the &quot;Giant&#x27;s Grave&quot; and &quot;Giant&#x27;s Thumb&quot; (c. 920s), have long prompted speculation. They may have been separate items brought together by an antiquary or they may be a genuine group. They appear to be an Anglo-Norse fusion of Christian and Norse motifs, but it is still debated whether they are linked to the King of the Strathclyde Cumbrians, Owain ap Dyfnwal (fl. 934). It is thought that Strathclyde British had settled in parts of north Cumbria in the 10th century.

On 12 July 927, Eamont Bridge (or possibly the monastery at Dacre, Cumbria, or the site of the old Roman fort at Brougham or even the church at Penrith, or a combination of these) was the scene of a gathering of kings from throughout Britain as recorded in the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; and the histories of William of Malmesbury and John of Worcester. Present were Athelstan, King of the Anglo-Saxons and then of the English, Constantín mac Áeda (Constantine II), King of Scots, Owain of Strathclyde, King of the Cumbrians, Hywel Dda, King of Wales, and Ealdred son of Eadulf, Lord of Bamburgh. Athelstan took the submission of some of these other kings, presumably to form some sort of coalition against the Vikings. The growing power of the Scots and perhaps of the Strathclyders, may have persuaded Athelstan to move north and attempt to define the boundaries of the various kingdoms. This is generally taken as the date of foundation of the Kingdom of England, whose northern boundary was the Eamont river, with Westmorland outside the control of Strathclyde. Penrith was effectively held by the Scottish king as overlord of the Strathclyde Cumbrians, until the Norman takeover in 1092. Thereafter Penrith&#x27;s fortunes varied according to the state of play between England and Scotland over ownership of Cumberland, Westmorland and Northumbria.

Penrith may have been founded before the arrival of the Normans. A ditched oval enclosure surrounding the area now occupied by St Andrew&#x27;s Church (a burh - hence &quot;Burrowgate&quot;) has been excavated. A church on the site may date back to the time of Bishop Wilfrid, (c. 670s) whose patron saint was Saint Andrew.

===Later medieval period: Normans and Plantagenets===
The Norman conquest of north Cumbria took place in 1092 under William Rufus, who retained Carlisle, Penrith and some other manors round Penrith as demesne. The Norman and Plantagenet rulers thereafter held Penrith as a crown estate (&quot;Penred Regis&quot;), along with a group of others locally, including Carlatton, Castle Sowerby, Gamblesby, Glassonby, Langwathby, Great Salkeld, Little Salkeld and Scotby. The group became known as the &quot;Queen&#x27;s Hames&quot; (&quot;Queen&#x27;s Homes&quot;) from 1330 onwards.

Membership of the group fluctuated over time. In 1187 a sub-set including Penrith, Langwathby, Great Salkeld, Gamblesby, Glassonby and Scotby was referred to as the Honour of Penrith. From 1242 to 1295, the Honour of Penrith (created &quot;the liberty of Penrith&quot; by the Treaty of York in 1237) was in the hands of the King of Scots, in return for renouncing his claims to Northumberland, Cumberland and Westmorland. King Henry III had been reluctant to cede Penrith to the Scots, as it was a good source of Crown income: the right to hold a market and fair was granted in 1223 by Henry, and arable farming produced good yields and taxes. Tensions between the English Crown&#x27;s agents in Cumberland and the Scottish agents attempting to defend the rights of the Scottish king and his tenants in the liberty of Penrith, may have influenced the mindset of the Scots leading up to the outbreak of the Wars of Scottish Independence.

King Edward I took Penrith and the other manors back into Crown possession (having been taken from the Scots and given to Bishop Anthony Bek). Perhaps to underline the authority of the Crown, Edward also established an Augustinian Friary in 1291. This succumbed to the Reformation in 1539. The Friarage house was built on the site in 1717.

With the Wars of Scottish Independence, Penrith suffered destruction by Scottish forces in 1296 (William Wallace), 1314, 1315–1316 and 1322 (Robert the Bruce). Meanwhile climatic change caused poor harvests. Penrith went from incipient economic growth in the early 14th century to poverty by the third decade. Recovery in the 1330s was again reversed by the devastating Scottish raid of 1345 (David II of Scotland) and the Black Death of 1348–1349 and subsequent years. However, Penrith, Castle Sowerby and the other manors were valuable as a source of royal income, paying debts the Crown owed to those leading the fight against the Scots, such as Roger de Leybourne, Anthony de Lucy and Andrew Harclay, 1st Earl of Carlisle.
There is evidence of a protective wall built round the town after the Scottish raid of 1345. This was strengthened in 1391 by the townspeople and Penrith&#x27;s patron, William Strickland, Bishop of Carlisle, after another Scottish raid by the 1st Earl of Douglas in 1380, and others in 1383 and 1388, when Brougham Castle was probably destroyed as well. It is thought that Strickland built and strengthened the &quot;pele tower&quot; in Benson Row, behind Hutton Hall. He also endowed a chantry (1395) in St Andrew&#x27;s Church, (where the chantry priest may have taught music and grammar), and created Thacka Beck, diverting clean water from the River Petteril, which was notably valuable for the tanning and related industries.

Strickland shared power in Penrith with the Neville family, which had been promoted in the North by Richard II of England to offset the influence of the Percies. In 1396, Ralph Neville, 1st Earl of Westmorland and his wife Joan gained the manors of Penrith and Castle Sowerby: windows in St Andrew&#x27;s Church may depict the Nevilles along with Richard II. Ralph probably started building Penrith Castle, which was continued by his son, Richard Neville, 5th Earl of Salisbury, father of Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick, the &quot;Kingmaker&quot;, whose death in the Battle of Barnet in 1471 led Edward IV of England to grant the Castle and Penrith manors to Richard of Gloucester, the future Richard III, to keep them Yorkist. Richard III used Penrith as a base against the Scots and to promote a Yorkist &quot;affinity&quot; in the area to offset Lancastrian loyalties at nearby Brougham, Appleby (Clifford) and Greystoke (Baron Greystoke) and elsewhere. Tradition has Richard staying in what is now Dockray Hall (once the &quot;Gloucester Arms&quot;) during building work on the castle. The latter was more of a palace than a military stronghold, with a chantry chapel endowed by Richard.

===Early modern period (1485–1714)===
====Tudor period====
The Tudor period saw the centralising tendencies of the Yorkist government continued. The English Reformation, economic and social progress, educational change, the rise of the non-noble landed gentry and the depredations of the plague all affected Tudor England, and Penrith was no exception.

The eclipse of the Nevilles and Percies by the end of the Wars of the Roses opened the field for families such as the Cliffords, the Dacres and the Musgraves to jostle for position in the North (including those of the Sheriff of Cumberland, the Warden of the West March and the keeper of Penrith Castle).
Penrith people were involved in a rebellion of 1536/1537 known as the Pilgrimage of Grace. Eight town residents were executed as a result. The motives seem to have been partly religious, partly to do with a desire for more English government protection against Scottish raids.

The reformation went on apace afterwards – the Augustinian Priory was dissolved and the two chantry bequests closed later. The Strickland bequest partly funded the Penrith Grammar School, founded 1564, in the reign of Elizabeth I. Many governors of the new foundation in St Andrew&#x27;s churchyard were rising Protestant gentry, who moved into various houses in Penrith: the families of Whelpdale (whose coat of arms adorns Dockray Hall), Carleton, Bost and Hutton (who had taken over the pele tower in Benson Row), and Richard Dudley of Yanwath Hall. The foundation was overseen by Sir Thomas Smith, one of Elizabeth&#x27;s trusted Protestant counsellors.

Penrith was not involved in the Rising of the North in 1569, despite involvement by Sir Richard Lowther and his younger brother Gerard, whose house in Penrith became the former &quot;Two Lions Inn&quot;. The merchant, Robert Bartram, may have built the Tudor House in St Andrew&#x27;s Place (1563), indicating a trading class operating in Penrith.

However, there may have been a substantial underclass as well, as shown by possible poverty and poor nutrition causing a high death rate in 1587, when there may have been a typhus epidemic. The Bubonic plague may have caused some 615 deaths in 1597–1598, according to the vicar&#x27;s register (2,260 according to a brass plaque inside St Andrew&#x27;s Church).

====Stuart period====
Penrith in Stuart times was affected by political and religious upheavals that saw the English Civil War, the Commonwealth and the Glorious Revolution, but was spared any fighting. It also escaped the witch-craze phenomenon that afflicted other parts of England. The Union of the Crowns and suppression of the reiver clans such as the Grahams, gave Penrith relief from Scottish raiding and a boost to Penrith&#x27;s commercial prosperity. James VI and I and his entourage of 800 visited Brougham Castle in 1617, which boosted commerce. However, Penrith&#x27;s crossroads position on the north–south and east–west routes made it vulnerable to starving vagrants bringing disease. This, plus a national food shortage, may have led to a typhus epidemic in 1623.

During the Civil War, Penrith&#x27;s gentry were mostly Royalist, but Penrithians seem to have been neither for nor against the King. During the first war (1642–1646), General Leslie took over Brougham Castle for the Covenanters and Penrith became a supply centre for Parliament. In the second civil war starting in 1648, Brougham and Penrith castles were strategic assets. Major-General Lambert, the Parliamentary commander, took over Penrith in June 1648 until forced out by Scottish royalists aided by Sir Philip Musgrave of Edenhall. The Covenanters supported the future Charles II after 1648. He stayed at Carleton Hall in 1651 on his way south to defeat at the Battle of Worcester.
Because Penrith lacked borough or corporation status, governance fell on the local nobility, gentry and clergy, (such as Hugh Todd). During the Commonwealth, Presbyterian &quot;Godly rule&quot; was administered at St Andrew&#x27;s Church by the local Justice of the peace, Thomas Langhorne, who had bought Lowther&#x27;s Newhall/Two Lions house. Meanwhile, Penrith benefited from work on restoration of Brougham and other castles, and by charitable donations undertaken by Lady Anne Clifford. The gradual rise in religious toleration eventually saw in 1699 the establishment, by the Quakers, of Penrith&#x27;s second place of worship, the Friends&#x27; Meeting House in Meeting House Lane.

Leading gentry of Cumberland and Westmorland gathered at the &quot;George Inn&quot; on 4 January 1688 at the behest of Lord Preston, the Lord Lieutenant of Cumberland and Westmorland. He was attempting to gauge the views of leading figures in the counties (deputy-lieutenants, and J.P.s) on the intention of King James II to introduce greater religious toleration. Partly due to efforts by John Lowther, 1st Viscount Lonsdale, the attendees were persuaded to give a non-committal reply. The Whig Lowther went on to contribute to securing the two counties for King William in the Glorious Revolution and advancing his career, unlike his local (Tory) rival Christopher Musgrave of Edenhall who had been more dilatory in his support for William. This exemplified local politics feeding into national politics.

The economy of Penrith &quot;continued to rely on cattle rearing, slaughtering and the processing of cattle products&quot; (leather goods, tanning, shoemaking).

===Local government before 1974===

Penrith was an urban district from 1894 to 1974, when it merged into Eden District. It was coterminous with the civil parish of Penrith, although when the council was abolished, Penrith became an unparished area. The area had been an urban sanitary district presided over by a Local Board of Health. The district also contained the hamlets of Carleton (now a suburb of Penrith), Bowscar, Plumpton Head and some of the village of Eamont Bridge. It was split into four wards – North, South, East and West – which remained the basic local-government divisions in the town until the 1990s.

In the 1920s, Penrith Castle came into council possession, its grounds becoming a public park. Castle Hill (Tyne Close) Housing Estate was built nearby. Further council housing was built at Fair Hill and Castletown before the Second World War, and after the war at Scaws, Townhead and Pategill. The district was bordered on three sides by Penrith Rural District, the southern boundary marked by the River Eamont being with Westmorland.

==Governance==
===UK Parliament===
Penrith is in the parliamentary constituency of Penrith and Solway. Its Member of Parliament (MP) since 2024 is Markus Campbell-Savours (Labour).

===Local government===
Since 2023, Penrith has had two levels of local government – Westmorland and Furness unitary authority (see below) and Penrith parish (town).

Until 2023, for county purposes, it was governed by Cumbria County Council, whose social services and education departments used to have area offices in the town. It was the seat of administration for Eden District Council, one of the largest districts by area in England and the most sparsely populated. It was based at offices in Penrith Town Hall and at the building now known as Mansion House, formerly Bishop Yards House.

A civil parish of Penrith was first formed in 1866. Between 1894 and 1974, the Urban District council acted as the parish council, but on its abolition, its successor authority, Eden District Council, decided that Penrith would become an unparished area under the district council&#x27;s direct control. In 2014 a referendum was held open to all registered voters in the unparished area of Penrith to see if they wanted a parish council for Penrith, and the result was in favour. The first elections to this were held on 7 May 2015. Initially the town council was based in offices in St Andrews Place; however, since 2017, it has taken the former county council offices in Friargate.

===Former local government divisions===
For electing councillors to Eden District Council and to Penrith Town Council, the civil parish of Penrith was divided into six wards:
*Penrith West: Castletown and parts of the town centre and Townhead
*Penrith North: part of the town centre, the New Streets, most of Townhead and the outlying settlements of Roundthorn, Bowscar and Plumpton Head
*Penrith South: Wetheriggs, Castle Hill, a small part of the town centre, part of Eamont Bridge and part of the Bridge Lane/Victoria Road area
*Penrith East: part of the town centre, Scaws, Carleton Parklands and Barco
*Penrith Carleton (formerly part of Penrith East): Carleton Village, High Carleton, Carleton Heights, Carleton Hall Gardens
*Penrith Pategill (formerly part of Penrith East): Pategill, Carleton Drive/Place, Tynefield Drive/Court and part of Eamont Bridge

Penrith West and South wards made up the Penrith West Electoral Division of Cumbria County Council, while East, Carleton and Pategill wards combine as Penrith East division. Penrith North, along with the rural Lazonby ward, made up Penrith North division.

===2023 changes to Local Government===
In 2023, Cumbria County Council and the 6 District councils within the county were abolished and replaced by two new unitary authorities. Eden along with South Lakeland and the Borough of Barrow-in-Furness became the new unitary District of Westmorland and Furness. The first elections to the new authority took place in May 2022. Penrith was divided into two new wards for the new council – Penrith North (the former Eden council wards of Penrith North and East) and Penrith South (the former West, South, Carleton and Pategill wards).

A nascent campaign has arisen, demanding that Penrith be included within Cumberland, given that it forms part of the historic county of Cumberland and has never been part of Westmorland.

==Geography==
===Watercourses===
Penrith lies in the Eden Valley, just north of the River Eamont. Other local rivers bounding the town are the Lowther and Petteril. Thacka Beck flows through the town centre partly in a culvert, remaining mostly underground. It links the River Petteril and the River Eamont. For many centuries, the Beck provided Penrith&#x27;s main water supply. Thacka Beck Nature Reserve provides flood storage to protect buildings in Penrith. Another stream, the Myers or Dog Beck, flows through and under the south-west of the town, joining Thacka Beck near Tynefield Court. The Dog Beck section has also been known as Scumscaw Beck or Tyne Syke. In 2014 the pub chain Wetherspoons opened a branch in Penrith, naming it the &quot;Dog Beck&quot;. There are also streams or becks running through the Carleton area of the town.

===Divisions and suburbs===
====Castletown====
Castletown, west of the West Coast Main Line, includes the Gilwilly Industrial Estate and some of the Penrith or Myers Industrial Estate. The area, originally built for workers on the railway line, mostly consists of late 19th and early 20th-century terraced housing, including some council housing. Since the 1990s, private developments such as Greystoke Park, Castletown Drive and Castle Park have appeared.

There was until March 2010 a pub in the suburb, &quot;The Castle Inn&quot;, and in previous years a sub-post office, a Co-op store and other shops, all now closed. Until the 1970s, Castletown had its Church of England St Saviour&#x27;s in Brougham Street, acting as a chapel of ease to Penrith&#x27;s parish church of St Andrew, originally built as a Primitive Methodist chapel. As of 2017, the Oasis Evangelical Church holds services at Brackenber Court sheltered housing complex in Musgrave Street. The Church in the Barn, Elim Pentecostal church, meets at the community centre at Gilwilly.

The suburb has a community centre on the recreation ground at Gilwilly and until recently held an annual gala day and parade throughout Penrith. At one time in the mid-20th century elections were held amongst regulars at the &quot;Castle&quot; pub to find a &quot;Mayor of Castletown&quot;. There is longstanding rivalry between the Castletown and Townhead districts.

====Townhead====
Townhead is the town&#x27;s northern area, including the Fair Hill district and the Voreda Park or Anchor housing estate. It mainly flanks the A6 road, heading uphill towards Carlisle. The road is named Stricklandgate and Scotland Road, but on maps before the mid-19th century it appears as Town Head. It was one of seven constablewicks into which the ancient Penrith parish divided, alongside Middlegate, Burrowgate, Dockray and Netherend in the town proper and Plumpton Head and Carleton beyond.

====New Streets====

New Streets marks an area between Townhead and Scaws on the side of the Beacon Hill or Fell, with steep streets of some terraced housing, but mainly detached and semi-detached houses of the late 19th century. These streets from north to south are Graham, Wordsworth, Lowther and Arthur Street. The term sometimes includes Fell Lane, which is actually the ancient east road from Penrith town centre to Langwathby), and Croft Avenue and Croft Terrace (from about 1930), which were not developed till later. At the foot is Drovers Lane, once Back Lane, subdivided into Drovers Terrace, Wordsworth Terrace, Lowther Terrace, Bath Terrace, Arthur Terrace, Lonsdale Terrace, and finally Meeting House Lane. Along the top is Beacon Edge, with extensive views over the town and towards the Lake District. Until the turn of the 20th century, Beacon Edge was known as Beacon Road. Apart from the streets up the fellside there are some that link smaller housing developments between them.

The fellside is known to have been used as a burial ground for victims of bubonic plague, which struck Penrith down the centuries. There are also areas that still have farming names, such as a wooded enclosure in Fell Lane known as the Pinfold (or Pinny) – once a pound for stray animals until owners paid to reclaim them. One lane off Beacon Edge is still Intack Lane, i. e. the lane to farmed land. Most of what formed the intack was passed to Penrith Cemetery.

====Scaws====
The Scaws Estate was built by Penrith Urban District Council after World War II on land hitherto known as the Flatt Field and Scaws Farm, as part of the Lowther Estates. Scaws Farm is now Coldsprings Farm. Later some private housing was built on higher parts of the estate.

Beaconside Primary School stands in the centre of the estate, where there were once three corner shops and a launderette. Adjoining Scaws are the private Barcohill and Meadow Croft housing estates.

====Carleton====

Carleton was once a separate settlement of houses along one side of the A686 road following the boundary of the built-up area. Carleton Hall holds the headquarters of the Cumbria Constabulary. The area is the home of Carelton Banks FC, colloquially the Pinks.

====Pategill====
Adjoining Carleton is the Pategill Housing Estate. It began as a council estate on land once part of the Carleton Hall estate and is still mostly owned by housing associations. Two streets, Prince Charles Close and Jubilee Close, were opened by the Prince of Wales in 1977. The centre of the estate is accessible by foot only and there was until 2012 a small convenience store. Several properties are run as sheltered housing for the elderly.

====Wetheriggs====
The Wetheriggs, Skirsgill and Castle Hill or Tyne Close areas were developed in the 1920s by Penrith Urban District Council on land formerly known as Scumscaw. The first private housing was developed in Holme Riggs Avenue and Skirsgill Gardens just before World War II. Further development did not start until the 1960s and 1970s, on land between Wetheriggs Lane and Ullswater Road. Not until the late 1980s were the two roads connected by the Clifford Road extension, which saw the Skirsgill area developed. There are three schools: Ullswater Community College. North Lakes Junior and Queen Elizabeth Grammar School (QEGS). The Crescent in Clifford Road holds sheltered accommodation for the elderly. There was once a shop at the junction of Huntley Avenue and Clifford Road and another at the foot of Holme Riggs Avenue. The large North Lakes Hotel and Spa stands at the junction of Clifford and Ullswater Roads, overlooking the Skirsgill Junction 40 Interchange of the M6 motorway, A66 and A592 roads.

====Penrith New Squares====
Plans to expand Penrith town centre south into the Southend Road area began by expanding the swimming pool area into a leisure centre, to replace a previous car park and sports fields, including ones used by Penrith and Penrith United football clubs. Plans for the rest of the scheme were drawn up by a property firm and included a supermarket and shopping streets, car parking and housing. Penrith New Squares refers to shops to be centred round two squares for parking and public entertainment.

Work here was suspended in October 2008 due to the financial crisis, but a new deal was agreed with Sainsbury&#x27;s and it resumed in 2011. The update includes less new housing, with parts deferred for up to five years. Sainsbury&#x27;s opened in December 2011. In June 2013, the first shop in the squares opened, along with a walk through from Sainsbury&#x27;s to the town centre.

==Landmarks==

The main church is St Andrew&#x27;s, built in 1720–1722 in an imposing Grecian style, abutting a 13th-century tower. The churchyard has ancient crosses and hogback tombstones known as the Giant&#x27;s Grave (early 10th century) and Giant&#x27;s Thumb (remains of a Norse cross from about 920).

Ruins of Penrith Castle (14th–16th centuries) can be seen from the adjacent railway station. It is run by English Heritage. To the south-east of the town are more substantial ruins of Brougham Castle, also held by English Heritage, as are the ancient henge sites known as Mayburgh Henge and King Arthur&#x27;s Round Table to the south.
The town centre has a Clock Tower erected in 1861 to mark Philip Musgrave of Edenhall. Hutton Hall in Friargate has a 14th-century pele tower at the rear, attached to an 18th-century building. Dockray Hall (once the &quot;Gloucester Arms&quot;) dates from about 1470 and may include remains of another pele tower. Richard, Duke of Gloucester resided there before becoming King Richard III and carried out extensive work at Penrith Castle about 1471.

Penrith has many wells. Well-dressing ceremonies took place on days in May. Three miles south-east, on the River Eamont opposite Ninekirks, are the &quot;Giants&#x27; Caves&quot;, with a well dedicated to St Ninian. These are enlarged out of Lower Permian sandstone and their associated breccias and purple shales.

Just north of the town is a wooded signal-beacon hill named Beacon Hill, originally Penrith Fell. Its last use was probably in 1804 in the war against Napoleon. Traditionally, Beacon Pike warned of danger from Scotland. Though ringed by commercial woodland owned by Lowther Estates, it still has natural woodlands visited by locals and tourists. On a clear day most of Eden Valley, local fells, Pennines and parts of the North Lakes can be seen. Beacon Hill possibly gave Penrith its Celtic name of &quot;red hill&quot;.

A fibreglass -tall statue of King Kong once stood in the Skirsgill Auction Mart.

It has wards for the elderly, mental health care and minor injuries, and a Primary Care Assessment unit, a maternity wing and the Lady Anne Clifford Day Hospital. Various weekly clinics are held at the hospital and the adjacent health centre, which opened in 1983 and brought all three NHS medical practices into one building – two have since merged. There is also a pharmacy in the centre.

Like other rural towns of its size, Penrith relies on public houses to form the basis of social entertainment. It was once famous for the sheer number of its pubs, served by five working breweries.

==Economy==

As a market town relying heavily on the tourist trade, Penrith benefits from some high-street chain stores and local specialist shops alongside other businesses such as banks, building societies and travel agents.

Market days are traditionally Tuesday and Saturday. On Tuesdays there was a small outdoor market in Great Dockray and Cornmarket. This ceased in the early 21st century, since when a small farmers&#x27; market has been held in the Market Square once a month. On Saturdays, Cumbria&#x27;s largest outdoor market takes place at the Auction Mart alongside the M6 motorway junction 40.

The main central shopping areas are Middlegate, Little Dockray, Devonshire Street/Market Square, Cornmarket, King Street, Angel Lane and the Devonshire Arcade and Angel Square precincts, with some shops in Burrowgate, Brunswick Road and Great Dockray.

Although the main industries are based around tourism and agriculture, some others are represented. For example, in 2011 Greggs opened a new bakery at Gilwilly, replacing two bakeries in the Friargate area that used to belong to the Penrith-based Birketts firm. Domino&#x27;s Pizza had a dough manufacturing site at Gilwilly until 2019. The model firm Lilliput Lane (now part of Enesco) was founded in Penrith and until March 2009 had its main factory at Skirsgill Park. Also at Penrith Industrial Estate is the Penrith Door Company factory, formerly part of Magnet Joinery, now of the American-based JELD-WEN group.

Agriculture-based industries include For Farmers, which has a large animal feed mill on the Penrith Industrial Estate. Until 2005 there was another feed mill at Gilwilly, originally belonging to Cumberland and Westmorland Farmers Ltd, but eventually becoming part of the Carrs Milling Industries group. Local butchers Cranstons have an expanding meat packing, pie and sandwich-manufacturing site alongside their shop and head office on Ullswater Road.

Penrith was known for its tanning industry and breweries. The tanneries were mainly in the Friargate/Old London Road area of the town. There were at one time five working breweries. Penrith in recent years has attracted many larger international haulage firms to open depots beside the M6.

Fylde Guitars is a manufacturer of hand-made fretted musical instruments, founded in Penrith in 1973 by luthier Roger Bucknall. Its instruments command high prices. All are hand-made using traditional techniques and have been developed in collaboration with professional players. Fylde Guitars is the only UK guitar maker to have been awarded the Acoustic Guitar Magazine &quot;Gold Award&quot;, in 2000.

==Sport==
Penrith is home to Penrith Rugby Union Football Club, which currently plays in the RFU National League 3 North. Home games are played at Winters Park in Penrith.

There is a skate park area by the Penrith Leisure Centre. The skate park opened in 2007.

Penrith has a golf club and driving range. Penrith Castle Park houses the town&#x27;s Bowling Club.

Penrith Swimming Club was founded in 1881 and was then based at Frenchfield in the River Eamont. Training sessions originally involved great variations of conditions that challenged the skills of any swimmer. Icy water, strong currents and obstacles like weed and the odd eel or two provided the ultimate test of stamina. It was all a far cry from conditions for today&#x27;s training sessions, held at Penrith Leisure Centre.

Penrith Canoe Club, founded in 2012, trains at the local leisure centre. Its main activity is canoe polo, in which the club was represented at the World Championships in Syracuse, Italy 2016 by its under-21 women&#x27;s squad, which finished a respectable fourth.

Penrith Tennis Club is located in the grounds of Penrith Rugby Club at Carleton Village.

==Regular events==
;Mayday Carnival: On the first Monday in May, Penrith holds a Mayday Carnival run by Penrith Lions Club.

==Climate==
Like most of the British Isles, Penrith has a maritime climate with mild summers and winters. The nearest Met Office weather station is at Newton Rigg, about a mile outside of the centre. Temperatures have ranged from in July 1901, down to in February 1969, although this was nearly exceeded by a fall to in December 2010. Newton Rigg also holds a record for the coldest April temperature reported in England: in April 1917.

<text>In functional analysis, it is often convenient to define a linear transformation on a complete, normed vector space formula_1 by first defining a linear transformation formula_2 on a dense subset of formula_1 and then continuously extending formula_2 to the whole space via the theorem below. The resulting extension remains linear and bounded, and is thus continuous, which makes it a continuous [[Linear extension (linear algebra)|linear extension]]. 

This procedure is known as continuous linear extension.

==Theorem==

Every bounded linear transformation formula_2 from a normed vector space formula_1 to a complete, normed vector space formula_7 can be uniquely extended to a bounded linear transformation formula_8 from the completion of formula_1 to formula_10 In addition, the operator norm of formula_2 is formula_12 if and only if the norm of formula_8 is formula_14

This theorem is sometimes called the BLT theorem.

==Application==

Consider, for instance, the definition of the Riemann integral. A step function on a closed interval formula_15 is a function of the form: formula_16
where formula_17 are real numbers, formula_18 and formula_19 denotes the indicator function of the set formula_20 The space of all step functions on formula_21 normed by the formula_22 norm (see Lp space), is a normed vector space which we denote by formula_23 Define the integral of a step function by: formula_24 
formula_25 as a function is a bounded linear transformation from formula_26 into formula_27

Let formula_28 denote the space of bounded, piecewise continuous functions on formula_15 that are continuous from the right, along with the formula_22 norm. The space formula_26 is dense in formula_32 so we can apply the BLT theorem to extend the linear transformation formula_25 to a bounded linear transformation formula_34 from formula_28 to formula_27 This defines the Riemann integral of all functions in formula_28; for every formula_38 formula_39

==The Hahn–Banach theorem==

The above theorem can be used to extend a bounded linear transformation formula_40 to a bounded linear transformation from formula_41 to formula_42 &quot;if&quot; formula_43 is dense in formula_44 If formula_43 is not dense in formula_46 then the Hahn–Banach theorem may sometimes be used to show that an extension exists. However, the extension may not be unique.

<doc id="460642" wikidata="Q249092" url="?curid=460642" title="Equicontinuity">
<text>In mathematical analysis, a family of functions is equicontinuous if all the functions are continuous and they have equal variation over a given neighbourhood, in a precise sense described herein. 
In particular, the concept applies to countable families, and thus &quot;sequences&quot; of functions.

Equicontinuity appears in the formulation of Ascoli&#x27;s theorem, which states that a subset of &quot;C&quot;(&quot;X&quot;), the space of continuous functions on a compact Hausdorff space &quot;X&quot;, is compact if and only if it is closed, pointwise bounded and equicontinuous. 
As a corollary, a sequence in &quot;C&quot;(&quot;X&quot;) is uniformly convergent if and only if it is equicontinuous and converges pointwise to a function (not necessarily continuous a-priori). 
In particular, the limit of an equicontinuous pointwise convergent sequence of continuous functions &quot;fn&quot; on either metric space or locally compact space is continuous. If, in addition, &quot;fn&quot; are holomorphic, then the limit is also holomorphic.

The uniform boundedness principle states that a pointwise bounded family of continuous linear operators between Banach spaces is equicontinuous.

== Equicontinuity between metric spaces ==

Let &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; be two metric spaces, and &quot;F&quot; a family of functions from &quot;X&quot; to &quot;Y&quot;. We shall denote by &quot;d&quot; the respective metrics of these spaces.

The family &quot;F&quot; is equicontinuous at a point &quot;x&quot;0 ∈ &quot;X&quot; if for every ε &gt; 0, there exists a δ &gt; 0 such that &quot;d&quot;(&quot;ƒ&quot;(&quot;x&quot;0), &quot;ƒ&quot;(&quot;x&quot;)) &lt; ε for all &quot;ƒ&quot; ∈ &quot;F&quot; and all &quot;x&quot; such that &quot;d&quot;(&quot;x&quot;0, &quot;x&quot;) &lt; δ. 
The family is pointwise equicontinuous if it is equicontinuous at each point of &quot;X&quot;.

The family &quot;F&quot; is uniformly equicontinuous if for every ε &gt; 0, there exists a δ &gt; 0 such that &quot;d&quot;(&quot;ƒ&quot;(&quot;x&quot;1), &quot;ƒ&quot;(&quot;x&quot;2)) &lt; ε for all &quot;ƒ&quot; ∈ &quot;F&quot; and all &quot;x&quot;1, &quot;x&quot;2 ∈ &quot;X&quot; such that &quot;d&quot;(&quot;x&quot;1, &quot;x&quot;2) &lt; δ.

For comparison, the statement &#x27;all functions &quot;ƒ&quot; in &quot;F&quot; are continuous&#x27; means that for every ε &gt; 0, every &quot;ƒ&quot; ∈ &quot;F&quot;, and every &quot;x&quot;0 ∈ &quot;X&quot;, there exists a δ &gt; 0 such that &quot;d&quot;(&quot;ƒ&quot;(&quot;x&quot;0), &quot;ƒ&quot;(&quot;x&quot;)) &lt; ε for all &quot;x&quot; ∈ &quot;X&quot; such that &quot;d&quot;(&quot;x&quot;0, &quot;x&quot;) &lt; δ.

* For &quot;continuity&quot;, δ may depend on ε, &quot;ƒ&quot;, and &quot;x&quot;0.
* For &quot;uniform continuity&quot;, δ may depend on ε and &quot;ƒ&quot;.
* For &quot;pointwise equicontinuity&quot;, δ may depend on ε and &quot;x&quot;0.
* For &quot;uniform equicontinuity&quot;, δ may depend only on ε.

More generally, when &quot;X&quot; is a topological space, a set &quot;F&quot; of functions from &quot;X&quot; to &quot;Y&quot; is said to be equicontinuous at &quot;x&quot; if for every ε &gt; 0, &quot;x&quot; has a neighborhood &quot;Ux&quot; such that
: formula_1
for all and &quot;ƒ&quot; ∈ &quot;F&quot;. This definition usually appears in the context of topological vector spaces.

When &quot;X&quot; is compact, a set is uniformly equicontinuous if and only if it is equicontinuous at every point, for essentially the same reason as that uniform continuity and continuity coincide on compact spaces. 
Used on its own, the term &quot;equicontinuity&quot; may refer to either the pointwise or uniform notion, depending on the context. On a compact space, these notions coincide.

Some basic properties follow immediately from the definition. Every finite set of continuous functions is equicontinuous. The closure of an equicontinuous set is again equicontinuous. 
Every member of a uniformly equicontinuous set of functions is uniformly continuous, and every finite set of uniformly continuous functions is uniformly equicontinuous.

=== Examples ===

*A set of functions with a common Lipschitz constant is (uniformly) equicontinuous. In particular, this is the case if the set consists of functions with derivatives bounded by the same constant.
*Uniform boundedness principle gives a sufficient condition for a set of continuous linear operators to be equicontinuous.
*A family of iterates of an analytic function is equicontinuous on the Fatou set.

=== Counterexamples ===

*The sequence of functions fn(x) = arctan(nx), is not equicontinuous because the definition is violated at x0=0.

== Equicontinuity of maps valued in topological groups ==

Suppose that is a topological space and is an additive topological group (i.e. a group endowed with a topology making its operations continuous). 
Topological vector spaces are prominent examples of topological groups and every topological group has an associated canonical uniformity.

:Definition: A family of maps from into is said to be equicontinuous at if for every neighborhood of in , there exists some neighborhood of in such that for every . We say that is equicontinuous if it is equicontinuous at every point of .

Note that if is equicontinuous at a point then every map in is continuous at the point. 
Clearly, every finite set of continuous maps from into is equicontinuous.

==Equicontinuous linear maps==
Because every topological vector space (TVS) is a topological group, the definition of an equicontinuous family of maps given for topological groups transfers to TVSs without change.

===Characterization of equicontinuous linear maps===

A family formula_2 of maps of the form formula_3 between two topological vector spaces is said to be formula_4 if for every neighborhood formula_5 of the origin in formula_6 there exists some neighborhood formula_7 of the origin in formula_8 such that formula_9 for all formula_10 

If formula_2 is a family of maps and formula_7 is a set then let formula_13 With notation, if formula_7 and formula_5 are sets then formula_16 for all formula_17 if and only if formula_18 

Let formula_8 and formula_6 be topological vector spaces (TVSs) and formula_2 be a family of linear operators from formula_8 into formula_23 
Then the following are equivalent: 
while if formula_6 is locally convex then this list may be extended to include:
while if formula_8 and formula_6 are locally convex then this list may be extended to include: 
while if formula_8 is barreled and formula_6 is locally convex then this list may be extended to include:
while if formula_8 and formula_6 are Banach spaces then this list may be extended to include: 
====Characterization of equicontinuous linear functionals====
Let formula_8 be a topological vector space (TVS) over the field formula_32 with continuous dual space formula_33 
A family formula_2 of linear functionals on formula_8 is said to be formula_4 if for every neighborhood formula_5 of the origin in formula_32 there exists some neighborhood formula_7 of the origin in formula_8 such that formula_9 for all formula_10 

For any subset formula_43 the following are equivalent: 
while if formula_8 is normed then this list may be extended to include:
while if formula_8 is a barreled space then this list may be extended to include:
===Properties of equicontinuous linear maps===

The uniform boundedness principle (also known as the Banach–Steinhaus theorem) states that a set formula_2 of linear maps between Banach spaces is equicontinuous if it is pointwise bounded; that is, formula_47 for each formula_48 The result can be generalized to a case when formula_6 is locally convex and formula_8 is a barreled space.

====Properties of equicontinuous linear functionals====

Alaoglu&#x27;s theorem implies that the weak-* closure of an equicontinuous subset of formula_51 is weak-* compact; thus that every equicontinuous subset is weak-* relatively compact.

If formula_8 is any locally convex TVS, then the family of all barrels in formula_8 and the family of all subsets of formula_51 that are convex, balanced, closed, and bounded in formula_55 correspond to each other by polarity (with respect to formula_56). 
It follows that a locally convex TVS formula_8 is barreled if and only if every bounded subset of formula_58 is equicontinuous.

==Equicontinuity and uniform convergence==

Let &quot;X&quot; be a compact Hausdorff space, and equip &quot;C&quot;(&quot;X&quot;) with the uniform norm, thus making &quot;C&quot;(&quot;X&quot;) a Banach space, hence a metric space. Then Arzelà–Ascoli theorem states that a subset of &quot;C&quot;(&quot;X&quot;) is compact if and only if it is closed, uniformly bounded and equicontinuous. 
This is analogous to the Heine–Borel theorem, which states that subsets of R&quot;n&quot; are compact if and only if they are closed and bounded. 
As a corollary, every uniformly bounded equicontinuous sequence in &quot;C&quot;(&quot;X&quot;) contains a subsequence that converges uniformly to a continuous function on &quot;X&quot;.

In view of Arzelà–Ascoli theorem, a sequence in &quot;C&quot;(&quot;X&quot;) converges uniformly if and only if it is equicontinuous and converges pointwise. The hypothesis of the statement can be weakened a bit: a sequence in &quot;C&quot;(&quot;X&quot;) converges uniformly if it is equicontinuous and converges pointwise on a dense subset to some function on &quot;X&quot; (not assumed continuous).
This weaker version is typically used to prove Arzelà–Ascoli theorem for separable compact spaces. Another consequence is that the limit of an equicontinuous pointwise convergent sequence of continuous functions on a metric space, or on a locally compact space, is continuous. (See below for an example.) 
In the above, the hypothesis of compactness of &quot;X&quot;  cannot be relaxed. 
To see that, consider a compactly supported continuous function &quot;g&quot; on R with &quot;g&quot;(0) = 1, and consider the equicontinuous sequence of functions on R defined by &quot;ƒ&quot;&quot;n&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) = . Then, &quot;ƒ&quot;&quot;n&quot; converges pointwise to 0 but does not converge uniformly to 0.

This criterion for uniform convergence is often useful in real and complex analysis. Suppose we are given a sequence of continuous functions that converges pointwise on some open subset &quot;G&quot; of R&quot;n&quot;. As noted above, it actually converges uniformly on a compact subset of &quot;G&quot; if it is equicontinuous on the compact set. In practice, showing the equicontinuity is often not so difficult. For example, if the sequence consists of differentiable functions or functions with some regularity (e.g., the functions are solutions of a differential equation), then the mean value theorem or some other kinds of estimates can be used to show the sequence is equicontinuous. It then follows that the limit of the sequence is continuous on every compact subset of &quot;G&quot;; thus, continuous on &quot;G&quot;. A similar argument can be made when the functions are holomorphic. One can use, for instance, Cauchy&#x27;s estimate to show the equicontinuity (on a compact subset) and conclude that the limit is holomorphic. Note that the equicontinuity is essential here. For example, &quot;ƒ&quot;&quot;n&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) = converges to a multiple of the discontinuous sign function.

==Generalizations==

===Equicontinuity in topological spaces===

The most general scenario in which equicontinuity can be defined is for topological spaces whereas &quot;uniform&quot; equicontinuity requires the filter of neighbourhoods of one point to be somehow comparable with the filter of neighbourhood of another point. The latter is most generally done via a uniform structure, giving a uniform space. Appropriate definitions in these cases are as follows:

:A set &quot;A&quot; of functions continuous between two topological spaces &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; is topologically equicontinuous at the points &quot;x&quot; ∈ &quot;X&quot; and &quot;y&quot; ∈ &quot;Y&quot; if for any open set &quot;O&quot; about &quot;y&quot;, there are neighborhoods &quot;U&quot; of &quot;x&quot; and &quot;V&quot; of &quot;y&quot; such that for every &quot;f&quot; ∈ &quot;A&quot;, if the intersection of &quot;f&quot;[&quot;U&quot;] and &quot;V&quot; is nonempty, &quot;f&quot;[&quot;U&quot;] ⊆ &quot;O&quot;. Then &quot;A&quot; is said to be topologically equicontinuous at &quot;x&quot; ∈ &quot;X&quot; if it is topologically equicontinuous at &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; for each &quot;y&quot; ∈ &quot;Y&quot;. Finally, &quot;A&quot; is equicontinuous if it is equicontinuous at &quot;x&quot; for all points &quot;x&quot; ∈ &quot;X&quot;.

:A set &quot;A&quot; of continuous functions between two uniform spaces &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; is uniformly equicontinuous if for every element &quot;W&quot; of the uniformity on &quot;Y&quot;, the set
:is a member of the uniformity on &quot;X&quot;

;Introduction to uniform spaces
We now briefly describe the basic idea underlying uniformities.

The uniformity is a non-empty collection of subsets of where, among many other properties, every , contains the diagonal of (i.e. ). 
Every element of is called an entourage.

Uniformities generalize the idea (taken from metric spaces) of points that are &quot;-close&quot; (for ), meaning that their distance is &lt; . 
To clarify this, suppose that is a metric space (so the diagonal of is the set )
For any , let 
denote the set of all pairs of points that are -close. 
Note that if we were to &quot;forget&quot; that existed then, for any , we would still be able to determine whether or not two points of are -close by using only the sets . 
In this way, the sets encapsulate all the information necessary to define things such as uniform continuity and uniform convergence with&quot;out&quot; needing any metric. 
Axiomatizing the most basic properties of these sets leads to the definition of a uniformity. 
Indeed, the sets generate the uniformity that is canonically associated with the metric space .

The benefit of this generalization is that we may now extend some important definitions that make sense for metric spaces (e.g. completeness) to a broader category of topological spaces. 
In particular, to topological groups and topological vector spaces.

;A weaker concept is that of even continuity:

:A set &quot;A&quot; of continuous functions between two topological spaces &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; is said to be evenly continuous at &quot;x&quot; ∈ &quot;X&quot; and &quot;y&quot; ∈ &quot;Y&quot; if given any open set &quot;O&quot; containing &quot;y&quot; there are neighborhoods &quot;U&quot; of &quot;x&quot; and &quot;V&quot; of &quot;y&quot; such that &quot;f&quot;[&quot;U&quot;] ⊆ &quot;O&quot; whenever &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) ∈ &quot;V&quot;. It is evenly continuous at &quot;x&quot; if it is evenly continuous at &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; for every &quot;y&quot; ∈ &quot;Y&quot;, and evenly continuous if it is evenly continuous at &quot;x&quot; for every &quot;x&quot; ∈ &quot;X&quot;.

===Stochastic equicontinuity===
Stochastic equicontinuity is a version of equicontinuity used in the context of sequences of functions of random variables, and their convergence.

<text>Alexander O&#x27;Neal (born November 15, 1953) is an American R&amp;B singer, songwriter and arranger from Natchez, Mississippi.

O&#x27;Neal came to prominence in the mid-1980s as a solo artist, with eleven Top 40 singles on the US R&amp;B chart, three of which also reached the Top 40 of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. However, he enjoyed more mainstream success in the United Kingdom, achieving fourteen Top 40 singles on the UK Singles Chart between 1985 and 1996, along with three top ten albums on the UK Albums Chart.

His solo singles, sometimes dealing with lost love, include &quot;If You Were Here Tonight&quot;, &quot;Fake&quot;, &quot;Criticize&quot;, &quot;The Lovers&quot;, &quot;(What Can I Say) To Make You Love Me&quot;, &quot;All True Man&quot;, &quot;Love Makes No Sense&quot; and &quot;In the Middle&quot;. He is also known for duets with Tabu labelmate Cherrelle such as &quot;Saturday Love&quot; and &quot;Never Knew Love Like This&quot;. AllMusic described O&#x27;Neal as having a &quot;tough voice [that] has the same grain and range as that of Otis Redding.&quot;

O&#x27;Neal released his debut album, the eponymous &quot;Alexander O&#x27;Neal&quot;, in 1985. Since then, he has released nine studio albums, six compilation albums and two live albums.

==Early life==
Alexander O&#x27;Neal was born November 15, 1953, in Natchez, Mississippi, United States, just a few months after his father died. After graduating from high school in Natchez, he attended Alcorn State University. At the age of 20, he relocated to Minneapolis, where he performed with several bands including the Mystics and Wynd Chymes. He became a member of Enterprise for a brief period before joining Flyte Tyme, a band which included Monte Moir, Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis.

==Early career==
According to Jimmy Jam, In 1980/1981, O&#x27;Neal (along with fellow members of the band Flyte Tyme) met with Prince and Morris Day at Perkins restaurant in Minneapolis to discuss forming a band that would be called The Time that would be signed to Prince under the Warner Bros. label. Following a disagreement with Prince, O&#x27;Neal was replaced as lead singer by Morris Day.

O&#x27;Neal subsequently formed an R&amp;B band called Alexander and recorded a couple 12&quot; singles, &quot;Do You Dare/Playroom&quot; and &quot;Attitude&quot; for a Chicago area independent label, based in Merrillville, Indiana, called Erect Records.

In 1984, O&#x27;Neal signed a deal with Clarence Avant&#x27;s Tabu Records. He did some backing vocals for other artists on the same label, including The S.O.S. Band and Cherrelle.

==1985–present: solo career==
In 1985, O&#x27;Neal released his self-titled debut album under the production of Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis as well as Monte Moir. It included three singles that reached the Top 20 of the R&amp;B Singles Chart. The same year, he also scored his first R&amp;B Top 10 single with &quot;Saturday Love&quot;, a duet with Cherrelle from her &quot;High Priority&quot; album. The song peaked at #2 on the R&amp;B chart and #26 on the pop chart, while also beginning a string of UK hit singles for O&#x27;Neal by peaking at #6 on the UK Singles Chart in early 1986. This UK success continued when &quot;If You Were Here Tonight&quot;, which had previously peaked at #81, re-entered the charts to reach #13 in March 1986.

In 1987, O&#x27;Neal released the album &quot;Hearsay&quot;, which was certified gold in the US and yielded his biggest US hit in &quot;Fake&quot;, which topped the R&amp;B chart and reached #25 on the pop chart. The song also peaked at #7 on the Billboard dance chart. The follow-up single, &quot;Criticize&quot;, peaked at #4 on the R&amp;B chart and #70 on the pop chart. The third single, &quot;Never Knew Love Like This&quot;, another duet with Cherrelle, peaked at #2 on the R&amp;B chart and #28 on the pop chart. However, by this time O&#x27;Neal was enjoying much greater success in the UK, where &quot;Hearsay&quot; peaked at #4 on the UK Albums Chart, eventually being certified triple platinum and spawning six Top 40 hits on the UK Singles Chart. The most successful of these gave O&#x27;Neal his biggest UK hit when &quot;Criticize&quot; peaked at #4 on the chart in late 1987. &quot;Fake&quot; became a UK Top 40 hit twice, first in 1987 followed by a remix (&quot;Fake &#x27;88&quot;) in 1988. The &quot;Hit Mix&quot; (a megamix of O&#x27;Neal&#x27;s hits) also reached the UK Top 20 in December 1989.

In December 1988, O&#x27;Neal released a Christmas album, &quot;My Gift to You&quot;, featuring a cover of &quot;The Christmas Song&quot; that reached the UK Top 40.

In 1991, O&#x27;Neal released his fourth album, &quot;All True Man&quot;. The album was certified gold in the US, with the title track reaching #5 on the R&amp;B chart and #43 on the pop chart. The album became his highest charting release in the UK, reaching #2 and going gold, although it ultimately sold fewer copies than &quot;Hearsay&quot;. The title track reached #18 on the UK Singles Chart. In 1992, his first greatest hits album, &quot;This Thing Called Love: The Greatest Hits of Alexander O&#x27;Neal&quot;, became another Top 5 success in the UK.

In 1993, O&#x27;Neal&#x27;s final album with the Tabu label, &quot;Love Makes No Sense&quot;, was released. This was the first album made without production from Jam and Lewis. Although it reached the UK Top 20 and two singles from the album reached the UK Top 40, sales were not as strong as his earlier releases. After leaving Tabu O&#x27;Neal signed for Motown, but no singles or albums were released. In 1995, another greatest hits compilation, &quot;The Best of Alexander O&#x27;Neal&quot;, was released. A year later the compilation was re-released with three added tracks from O&#x27;Neal&#x27;s short period with Motown.

In 1996, his first album with One World Records, &quot;Lovers Again&quot;, was released. The album did not chart in the UK, though the single &quot;Let&#x27;s Get Together&quot; reached the UK Top 40. In 2001, he released an album on Eagle Records, &quot;Saga of a Married Man&quot;. The album was produced by former Prince drummer, Bobby Z. In 2005, he recorded his first live album, &quot;Alexander O&#x27;Neal Live at Hammersmith Apollo&quot;, featuring songs from throughout his career.

In 2008, O&#x27;Neal released &quot;Alex Loves...&quot;, his first studio album in six years. The album peaked at #49 in the UK, and was his first charting album of new material in 15 years.

In 2014, O&#x27;Neal signed a new management deal with Howard Perl Management (Beverly Hills), which awarded him extensive tours and a cast member on Celebrity Big Brother.

In June 2016, O&#x27;Neal collaborated with Manchester-based funk band, Mamma Freedom, on the single, &quot;Fake&quot;, a re-recording of his 1987 single of the same name. The single was released shortly before O&#x27;Neal embarked upon a UK tour, with Mamma Freedom providing support.

In 2017, O&#x27;Neal collaborated with Manchester-based funk band Mamma Freedom on the album &quot;Hearsay30&quot;, a re-recording of his 1987 album. The album was released on December 1, 2017.

In 2019, O&#x27;Neal made an appearance alongside Cherrelle at the Soul Train Awards to pay tribute to long-time collaborators Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis.

In 2021, O&#x27;Neal made an appearance alongside Whyso, O&#x27;Mega Red, and J Dore of The High Children on &quot;Say His Name,&quot; a song dedicated to the memory of George Floyd.

==Television==
In 2006 O&#x27;Neal appeared on the &quot;Weakest Link, All Singing All Dancing Edition&quot;, where he was the 5th contestant voted off the show. In 2006 and 2007, O&#x27;Neal participated on the British reality singing contest show &quot;Just the Two of Us&quot;. In 2008 O&#x27;Neal took part in a &quot;Wife Swap&quot; UK special, swapping his wife Cynthia with broadcaster and TV personality Jilly Goolden. The programme included an in-depth interview with O&#x27;Neal by noted UK R&amp;B writer Pete Lewis of the award-winning magazine &quot;Blues &amp; Soul&quot;. The interview was featured in full in the August 2008 issue of the magazine.

In 2011 the TV One series &quot;Unsung&quot; profiled O&#x27;Neal&#x27;s rise to fame, along with the story of Cherrelle.

In 2015, O&#x27;Neal took part in the Channel 5 reality series &quot;Celebrity Big Brother&quot;. On Day 12, O&#x27;Neal decided to leave the show.

==Honors and awards==
O&#x27;Neal was honored with a star on the outside mural of the Minneapolis nightclub First Avenue, recognizing performers that have played sold-out shows or have otherwise demonstrated a major contribution to the culture at the iconic venue. Receiving a star &quot;might be the most prestigious public honor an artist can receive in Minneapolis,&quot; according to journalist Steve Marsh.

<text>Miriam Waddington (née Dworkin; 23 December 1917 – 3 March 2004) was a Canadian poet, short story writer and translator. She was part of a Montreal literary circle that included F. R. Scott, Irving Layton and Louis Dudek.

==Biography==
Miriam Waddington was born in Winnipeg, Manitoba, she studied English at the University of Toronto (B.A. 1939) and social work at the University of Pennsylvania (M.A.). She worked for many years as a social worker in Montreal, Quebec. She later relocated to the then Toronto suburb of North York, where she worked for North York Family Services. In 1964, she joined the English department at York University. She retired in 1983.

She died in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada on 3 March 2004 after suffering a stroke in late February. After her death, much of her own works and personal library were donated by her sons to the archives of Simon Fraser University in Burnaby, British Columbia. The donation was a significant and appreciated endowment. Her archival fonds is held at Library and Archives Canada in Ottawa.

==Honours==
Miriam Waddington was awarded Borestone Mountain Awards for best poetry in 1963, 1966, and 1974. She received the J.J. Segal Award in 1972. She was the Canada Council Exchange Poet to Wales in 1980, and served as writer-in-residence at the Windsor Public Library and at the University of Ottawa.

Waddington received honorary doctorates from Lakehead University in 1975 and York University in 1985.

Her poem &quot;Jacques Cartier in Toronto&quot; is featured on the back of the Canadian $100 bill released in 2004.

<doc id="460656" wikidata="Q2872542" url="?curid=460656" title="Symphony No. 8 (Sibelius)">
<text>The Symphony No. 8, JS 190, was the final major compositional project of the Finnish composer Jean Sibelius, occupying him intermittently from the mid-1920s until around 1938, though he never published it. During this time Sibelius was at the peak of his fame, a national figure in his native Finland and a composer of international stature. A fair copy of at least the first movement was made, but how much of the Eighth Symphony was completed is unknown. Sibelius repeatedly refused to release it for performance, though he continued to assert that he was working on it even after he had, according to later reports from his family, burned the score and associated material, probably in 1945.

Much of Sibelius&#x27;s reputation, during his lifetime and subsequently, derived from his work as a symphonist. His Seventh Symphony of 1924 has been widely recognised as a landmark in the development of symphonic form, and at the time there was no reason to suppose that the flow of innovative orchestral works would not continue. However, after the symphonic poem &quot;Tapiola&quot;, completed in 1926, his output was confined to relatively minor pieces and revisions to earlier works. During the 1930s the Eighth Symphony&#x27;s premiere was promised to Serge Koussevitzky and the Boston Symphony Orchestra on several occasions, but as each scheduled date approached Sibelius demurred, claiming that the work was not ready for performance. Similar promises made to the British conductor Basil Cameron and to the Finnish Georg Schnéevoigt likewise proved illusory. It is thought that Sibelius&#x27;s perfectionism and exalted reputation prevented him ever completing the symphony to his satisfaction; he wanted it to be even better than his Seventh.

After Sibelius&#x27;s death in 1957, news of the Eighth Symphony&#x27;s destruction was made public, and it was assumed that the work had disappeared forever. But in the 1990s, when the composer&#x27;s many notebooks and sketches were being catalogued, scholars first raised the possibility that fragments of the music for the lost symphony might have survived. Since then, several short manuscript sketches have been tentatively identified with the Eighth, three of which (comprising less than three minutes of music) were recorded by the Helsinki Philharmonic Orchestra in 2011. While a few musicologists have speculated that, if further fragments can be identified, it may be possible to reconstruct the entire work, others have suggested that this is unlikely given the ambiguity of the extant material. The propriety of publicly performing music that Sibelius himself had rejected has also been questioned.

==Background==

Jean Sibelius was born in 1865 in Finland, since 1809 an autonomous grand duchy within the Russian Empire having earlier been under Swedish control for many centuries. The country remained divided between a culturally dominant Swedish-speaking minority, to which the Sibelius family belonged, and a more nationalistically-minded Finnish-speaking, or &quot;Fennoman&quot; majority. In about 1889 Sibelius met his future wife, Aino Järnefelt, who came from a staunch Fennoman family. Sibelius&#x27;s association with the Järnefelts helped to awaken and develop his own nationalism; in 1892, the year of his marriage to Aino, he completed his first overtly nationalistic work, the symphonic suite &quot;Kullervo&quot;. Through the 1890s, as Russian control over the duchy grew increasingly oppressive, Sibelius produced a series of works reflecting Finnish resistance to foreign rule, culminating in the tone poem &quot;Finlandia&quot;.

Sibelius&#x27;s national stature was recognised in 1897 when he was awarded a state pension to enable him to spend more time composing. In 1904 he and Aino settled in Ainola, a country residence he built on the shores of Lake Tuusula in Järvenpää, where they lived for the remainder of their lives. Although life at Ainola was not always calm and carefree—Sibelius was often in debt and prone to bouts of heavy drinking—he managed over the following 20 years to produce a large output of orchestral works, chamber music, piano pieces and songs, as well as lighter music. His popularity spread across Europe to the United States where, during a triumphant tour in 1914, he was awarded an honorary doctorate by Yale University. At home his status was such that his 50th birthday celebrations in 1915 were a national event, the centrepiece of which was the Helsinki premiere of his Fifth Symphony.

By the mid-1920s Sibelius had acquired the status of a living national monument and was the principal cultural ambassador of his country, independent since 1917. According to his biographer Guy Rickards, he invested &quot;his most crucial inspiration&quot; into the seven symphonies he composed between 1898 and 1924. The Sibelius scholar James Hepokoski considers the compact, single-movement Seventh Symphony, which Sibelius completed in 1924, to be the composer&#x27;s most remarkable symphonic achievement, &quot;the consummate realization of his late-style rethinking of form&quot;. It was followed in 1926 by &quot;Tapiola&quot;, a tone poem in which, says Rickards, Sibelius &quot;pushed orchestral resources into quite new regions ...&quot;Tapiola&quot; was thirty or forty years ahead of its time&quot;.

==Composition==
===Beginnings===
The first reference to the Eighth Symphony in Sibelius&#x27;s diary is an undated entry from September 1926: &quot;I offered to create something for America.&quot; However, some of the initial ideas for the new symphony were almost certainly set down earlier, since it was Sibelius&#x27;s compositional habit to set aside themes and motifs for use in later projects. Thus, one of the extant sketches for his Seventh Symphony, on which he was engaged in 1923–24, contains a ringed motif marked &quot;VIII&quot;. By the autumn of 1927 Sibelius was able to inform the &quot;New York Times&quot; music critic Olin Downes—one of his greatest admirers—that he had set down two movements of the Eighth on paper and had composed the rest in his head.

Early in 1928 Sibelius made one of his regular visits to Berlin, to imbibe the city&#x27;s musical life and to compose. He sent positive work-in-progress reports to Aino: the symphony, he said, will be &quot;wonderful&quot;. Back home in Ainola in September, he told his sister that he was &quot;writing a new work, which will be sent to America. It will still need time. But it will turn out well.&quot; In December 1928, however, when his Danish publisher Wilhelm Hansen asked him how the work was developing, Sibelius was less forthcoming; the symphony existed, he said, only in his head. Thereafter Sibelius&#x27;s reports of the symphony&#x27;s progress became equivocal, sometimes contradictory, and difficult to follow.

===Progress and prevarication===

Probably at the instigation of Downes, Sibelius had promised the world premiere of his new symphony to Serge Koussevitzky and the Boston Symphony Orchestra. For several years, in a protracted correspondence with the conductor and Downes, Sibelius hesitated and prevaricated. In January 1930 he said the symphony was &quot;not nearly ready and I cannot say when it will be ready&quot;, but in August that year he told Koussevitzky that a performance in the spring of 1931 was possible. Nothing resulted from this. In the summer of 1931 Sibelius told Downes that not only was the Eighth Symphony almost ready for the printers, he also had several other new works pending. Thus encouraged, in December 1931 Koussevitzky used the &quot;Boston Evening Transcript&quot; to announce the work for the orchestra&#x27;s 1931–32 season. This brought a swift telegram from Sibelius, to the effect that the symphony would not, after all, be ready for that season.

Koussevitzky then decided to perform all of Sibelius&#x27;s symphonies in the Boston Symphony&#x27;s 1932–33 season, with the world premiere of the Eighth as the culmination. In June 1932 Sibelius wrote to Koussevitzky suggesting that the Eighth be scheduled for the end of October. A week later he retracted: &quot;I am very disturbed about it. Please do not announce the performance.&quot; Further promises, for December 1932 and January 1933, brought forth no scores. Koussevitzky was by now losing hope, yet he inquired once more, in the summer of 1933. Sibelius was evasive; he made no promise of delivery but would &quot;return to the matter at a later date&quot;. So far as Koussevitzky and the Boston Symphony were concerned, the matter ended there. Sibelius had made agreements with other conductors; he had promised the European premiere to Basil Cameron and the Royal Philharmonic Society, and the first Finnish performance to Georg Schnéevoigt, who had recently taken over direction of the Helsinki Philharmonic Orchestra. These arrangements were, however, subject to the illusory Boston premiere, and thus were stillborn. Later in the decade, Eugene Ormandy, a fervent admirer of Sibelius who directed the Philadelphia Orchestra from 1936, is thought to have lobbied strongly for the right to perform the premiere, should the symphony in due course emerge.

During his procrastinations with Koussevitzky, Sibelius continued to work on the symphony. In 1931 he again spent time in Berlin, writing to Aino in May 1931 that &quot;the symphony is advancing with rapid strides&quot;. Progress was interrupted by illness, but towards the end of the year Sibelius was confidently asserting that &quot;I am writing my eighth symphony and I am full of youth. How can this be explained?&quot; In May 1933, as he continued to deny Koussevitzky, Sibelius wrote in his diary that he was deeply immersed in composition: &quot;It is as if I had come home ... I&#x27;m taking everything in another way, more deeply. A gypsy within me. Romantic.&quot; Later that summer he informed a journalist that his new symphony was nearly complete: &quot;It will be the reckoning of my whole existence – sixty-eight years. It will probably be my last. Eight symphonies and a hundred songs. It has to be enough.&quot;

At some stage in that summer the formal copying of the symphony began. On 4 September 1933 Paul Voigt, Sibelius&#x27;s long-time copyist, sent a bill for making a fair copy of the first movement—23 pages of music. Sibelius informed him—the note survives—that the complete manuscript would be about eight times as long as this excerpt, indicating that the symphony might be on a larger scale than any of its seven predecessors. Aino Sibelius later recalled other visits to Voigt that autumn at which Sibelius, whose mood she described as gloomy and taciturn, delivered further piles of music manuscript to the copyist.

===Limbo===
Various reports appeared to confirm that the symphony&#x27;s release was imminent. The Finnish composer Leevi Madetoja mentioned in 1934 that the work was virtually complete; an article by the Swedish journalist Kurt Nordfors indicated that two movements were complete and the rest sketched out. As pressure to produce the symphony increased, Sibelius became increasingly withdrawn and unwilling to discuss his progress. In December 1935, during an interview in connection with his 70th birthday celebrations, he indicated that he had discarded a whole year&#x27;s work; this pointed to a full-scale revision of the Eighth. However, when &quot;The Times&quot;″s correspondent asked for details of the work&#x27;s progress Sibelius became irritated. He was furious when Downes continued to pester him for information, on one occasion shouting &quot;Ich kann nicht!&quot; (&quot;I cannot!&quot;).

A receipt found among Sibelius&#x27;s papers refers to a &quot;Symphonie&quot; being bound by the firm of Weilin &amp; Göös in August 1938. While it is not established that this transaction related to the Eighth, the Sibelius scholar Kari Kilpeläinen points out that none of the earlier symphony scores carry the unnumbered heading &quot;Symphonie&quot;, and asks: &quot;Could he have omitted the number to prevent news of the now completed Eighth from spreading? Or did he not give the work a number at all, because he was not satisfied with it?&quot; The composer&#x27;s daughter Katarina spoke of the self-doubt that afflicted her father at this time, aggravated by the continuing expectations and fuss that surrounded the Eighth Symphony. &quot;He wanted it to be better than the other symphonies. Finally it became a burden, even though so much of it had already been written down. In the end I don&#x27;t know whether he would have accepted what he had written.&quot;

Sibelius remained in Finland during the Winter War of 1939–40, despite offers of asylum in the United States. After the war ended in March 1940 he moved with his family to an apartment on Kammiokatu (later renamed Sibeliuksenkatu or &#x27;Sibelius Street&#x27; in his honour) in the Töölö district of Helsinki, where they remained for a year. During that time they were visited by the pianist Martti Paavola, who was able to examine the contents of Sibelius&#x27;s safe. Paavola later reported to his pupil Einar Englund that among the music kept there was a symphony, &quot;most likely the Eighth&quot;.

==Destruction==
Back in Ainola, Sibelius busied himself by making new arrangements of old songs. However, his mind returned frequently to the now apparently moribund symphony. In February 1943 he told his secretary, Santeri Levas, that he hoped to complete a &quot;great work&quot; before he died, but blamed the war for his inability to make progress: &quot;I cannot sleep at nights when I think about it.&quot; In June he discussed the symphony with his future son-in-law Jussi Jalas and provided another reason for its non-completion: &quot;For each of my symphonies I have developed a special technique. It can&#x27;t be something superficial, it has to be something that has been lived though. In my new work I am struggling with precisely these issues.&quot; Sibelius also told Jalas that all rough sketches and drafts were to be burned after his death; he did not want anyone labelling these rejected scraps as &quot;Sibelius letzten Gedanken&quot; (Sibelius&#x27;s last thoughts).

At some time in the mid-1940s, probably in summer 1945, Sibelius and Aino together burned a large number of the composer&#x27;s manuscripts on the stove in the dining room at Ainola. There is no record of what was burned; while most commentators assume that the Eighth Symphony was among the works destroyed, Kilpeläinen observes that there had been at least two manuscripts of the work—the original and Voigt&#x27;s copy—as well as sketches and fragments of earlier versions. It is possible, says Kilpeläinen, that Sibelius may not have burned them all. Aino, who found the process very painful, recalled later that the burning appeared to ease Sibelius&#x27;s mind: &quot;After this, my husband appeared calmer and his attitude was more optimistic. It was a happy time&quot;. The most optimistic interpretation of his action, according to &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&#x27;s&quot; music critic David Patrick Stearns, is that he got rid of old drafts of the symphony to clear his mind for a fresh start. In 1947, after visiting Ainola, the conductor Nils-Eric Fougstedt claimed to have seen a copy of the Eighth on the shelf, with separate choral parts. The musicologist Erkki Salmenhaara posits the idea of two burnings: that of 1945 which destroyed early material, and another after Sibelius finally recognised that he could never complete the work to his satisfaction.

Although Sibelius informed his secretary in late August 1945 that the symphony had been burned, the matter remained a secret confined to the composer&#x27;s private circle. During the remaining years of his life, Sibelius from time to time hinted that the Eighth Symphony project was still alive. In August 1945 he wrote to Basil Cameron: &quot;I have finished my eighth symphony several times, but I am still not satisfied with it. I will be delighted to hand it over to you when the time comes.&quot; In fact, after the burning he had altogether abandoned creative composing; in 1951, when the Royal Philharmonic Society requested a work to mark the 1951 Festival of Britain, Sibelius declined. As late as 1953 he told his secretary Levas that he was working on the symphony &quot;in his mind&quot;; only in 1954 did he admit, in a letter to the widow of his friend Adolf Paul, that it would never be completed. Sibelius died on 20 September 1957; the next day his daughter Eva Paloheimo announced publicly that the Eighth Symphony did not exist. The burning of the manuscript became generally known later, when Aino revealed the fact to the composer&#x27;s biographer Erik W. Tawaststjerna.
Critics and commentators have pondered the reasons why Sibelius finally abandoned the symphony. Throughout his life he was prone to depression and often suffered crises of self-confidence. Alex Ross, in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, quotes an entry from the composer&#x27;s 1927 diary, when the Eighth Symphony was allegedly under way:

&quot;This loneliness is driving me crazy... To be able to live in the first place, I must have alcohol. Wine or whisky. That&#x27;s the matter. Abused, alone, and all my real friends are dead. My current prestige here at home is rock-bottom. Impossible to work. If only there were a solution.&quot;

Writers have pointed to the hand tremor that made writing difficult and to the alcoholism that afflicted him at numerous stages of his life. Others have argued that Sibelius&#x27;s exalted status as a national hero effectively silenced him; he became afraid that any further major work would not live up to the expectations of the adoring nation. Andrew Barnett, another of the composer&#x27;s many biographers, points to Sibelius&#x27;s intense self-criticism; he would withhold or suppress anything that failed to meet his self-imposed standards: &quot;It was this attitude that brought about the destruction of the Eighth Symphony, but the very same trait forced him to keep on revising the Fifth until it was perfect.&quot; The historian Mark McKenna agrees that Sibelius became stifled by a combination of perfectionism and increasing self-doubt. The myth, sustained for more than 15 years, that Sibelius was still working on the symphony was, according to McKenna, a deliberate fiction: &quot;To admit that he had stopped completely would be to admit the unthinkable—that he was no longer a composer&quot;.

==Discoveries==

After his death Sibelius, though remaining popular with the general public, was frequently denigrated by critics who found his music dated and tedious. René Leibowitz, a proponent of the music of Arnold Schoenberg, published a pamphlet describing Sibelius as &quot;the worst composer in the world&quot;; others dismissed him as irrelevant in what was perceived for a time as an irresistible movement towards atonality. This climate diminished curiosity about the existence of material from a possible Sibelius Eighth, until late in the 20th century, when critical interest in the composer revived. In 1995 Kilpeläinen, who had published a survey of the Sibelius manuscripts held in the Helsinki University Library, wrote that all that could definitely be connected to the Eighth Symphony were a single page from a draft score and the ringed melody fragment marked &quot;VIII&quot; within the Seventh Symphony sketches. He added, however, that the library contained further Sibelius sketches from the late 1920s and early 1930s, some of which are akin to the ringed fragment and which could conceivably have been intended for the Eighth Symphony. Kilpeläinen also revealed that &quot;[j]ust recently various documents have come to light which no one dreamt even existed. Maybe there are still some clues to the 8th Symphony hidden away and just waiting for some scholar to discover them.&quot;

In 2004, in an article entitled &quot;On Some Apparent Sketches for Sibelius&#x27;s Eighth Symphony&quot;, the musical theorist Nors Josephson identifies around 20 manuscripts or fragments held in the Helsinki University Library as being relevant to the symphony and concludes that: &quot;Given the abundance of preserved material for this work, one looks forward with great anticipation to a thoughtful, meticulous completion of the entire composition&quot;. Another Sibelius scholar, Timo Virtanen, has examined the same material and is more restrained, concluding that although some of the sketches may relate to the Eighth Symphony, it is not possible to determine exactly which, if any, these are. Even the fragment marked &quot;VIII&quot;, he maintains, cannot with certainty be said to relate to the symphony, since Sibelius often used both Roman and Arabic numerals to refer to themes, motifs or passages within a composition. Virtanen provides a further note of caution: &quot;We should be aware that [the fragments] are, after all, drafts: unfinished as music, and representing only a certain stage in planning a new composition&quot;.

Despite his reservations, in October 2011 Virtanen cooperated with another scholar, Vesa Sirén, to prepare three of the more developed fragments for performance. The sketches were copied and tidied, but nothing not written by Sibelius was added to the material. Permission from the Sibelius Rights Holders was secured, and John Storgårds, chief conductor of the Helsinki Philharmonic, agreed to play and record these excerpts at the orchestra&#x27;s rehearsal session on 30 October 2011. The pieces comprise an opening segment of about a minute&#x27;s duration, an eight-second fragment that might be part of a scherzo, and a final scrap of orchestral music again lasting roughly a minute. Sirén describes the music as &quot;strange, powerful, and with daring, spicy harmonies—a step into the new even after &quot;Tapiola&quot; and the music for &quot;The Tempest&quot;&quot;. Stearns gives a more detailed insight: &quot;The first excerpt is classic Sibelian announcement of a first movement. There&#x27;s a genteel orchestral thunderclap that throws open the door to a harmonic world that is Sibelius&#x27; alone, but has strange dissonances unlike any other work. Another glimpse sounds like the beginning of a scherzo, surprisingly spring-like with a buoyant flute solo. Another snippet has a classic Sibelian bassoon solo, the sort that speaks of primal things and goes to a dark, wintry underworld.&quot;

==Speculation==

Although only the first movement, copied by Voigt, is fully accepted as having been completed, the intended scale and general character of the Eighth Symphony may be inferred from several sources. Sibelius&#x27;s correspondence with Voigt and with his binders, in 1933 and 1938 respectively, indicates the possibility of a notably large-scale work. Apart from Nils-Eric Fougstedt&#x27;s 1947 observation, there are also indications from Voigt that the work may have contained choral elements, along the lines of Beethoven&#x27;s Ninth.

From the available fragments of music, both Virtanen and Andrew Mellor of &quot;Gramophone&quot; detect hints of &quot;Tapiola&quot;, particularly in the first of the three extracts. Kilpeläinen points to some of Sibelius&#x27;s late minor works, in particular the &quot;Five Esquisses&quot; for piano Op. 114 (1929), as providing evidence that in his final compositional years Sibelius was &quot;progressing towards a more abstract idiom: clear, ethereal images little touched by the human passions&quot;. Further originality, Kilpeläinen says, is found in the &quot;Surusoitto&quot; music for organ, composed in 1931 for the funeral of Sibelius&#x27;s friend Akseli Gallen-Kallela, a work that Aino Sibelius admitted might have been based on Eighth Symphony material: &quot;Did the new symphony&quot;, asks Kilpeläinen, &quot;thus also represent a modern sound unlike that of his previous style, with bleak, open tones and unresolved dissonances?&quot; After the recording of the fragments, Storgårds could recognise the composer&#x27;s late style, adding that &quot;the harmonies are so wild and the music so exciting that I&#x27;d really love to know how he went on with this.&quot; Sibelius&#x27;s only preserved comment on the music itself, as distinct from his occasional progress reports, is a remark to Schnéevoigt in December 1932: &quot;You have no idea how clever it is&quot;.

Scholars and critics are divided in their views about the value of the recovered excerpts. On the one hand, Josephson is convinced that sufficient material exists for a reconstruction of the entire symphony and eagerly awaits the undertaking of this task. This view is echoed by Stearns: &quot;[T]here&#x27;s absolutely no reason not to attempt a completion&quot;. Others, however, are more circumspect: Virtanen, in particular, emphasises that although the music is irrefutably late Sibelius, it has not been established beyond doubt that any of it belongs to the Eighth Symphony. Sirén, who played a major role in organising the performance of the fragments, believes that completion is impossible on the basis of existing sketches, and would be dependent on further discoveries. He also surmises that Sibelius, having rejected the work, would not have relished hearing the fragments played, a viewpoint which McKenna endorses: &quot;Watching the performance on YouTube, I could not help but think how disappointed the composer would have been to hear his unfinished music performed.&quot; Reviewing the recorded excerpts in &quot;Gramophone&quot;, Andrew Mellor remarks that even if further manuscripts should come to light, the Sibelius Rights Holders would have full control over the material and would decide whether performance was appropriate. Mellor concludes: &quot;We&#x27;ve had to wait some 80 years to hear less than three minutes of music, and the mystery of the Eighth isn&#x27;t set to unfold any more rapidly from here&quot;.

<text>Huángbò Xīyùn (, ) (died 850) was an influential master of Zen Buddhism during the Tang dynasty. He was part of the Hongzhou school of Chan founded by Mazu.

Huángbò was a student of Baizhang Huaihai (720–814), and the teacher of Linji Yixuan (J. Rinzai) (died 866) (Wade–Giles: Lin-chi I-hsüan; Japanese: Rinzai Gigen).

==Biography==

===Sources===
Very little about Huángbò&#x27;s life is known for certain as, unlike other &quot;Transmission of the Lamp&quot; literature, there is no biographical information included with Huángbò&#x27;s collection of sayings and sermons, the &quot;Chuanxin Fayao&quot; (傳心法要, &quot;Essentials of Mind Transmission&quot;) and the &quot;Wanling Lu&quot; (宛陵錄, &quot;Record of Wan-ling&quot;; Japanese: &quot;Enryōroku&quot;).

He was born in Fuzhou, China. The records indicated that Huángbò was extraordinarily tall.

===Monastic life===
Huángbò began his monastic life on Mount Huangbo in Fujian province, receiving the Buddhist name Xiyun (Hsi-yun). As was the custom of the times, he traveled around seeking instructions from various Chan masters. He visited Mt. Tiantai and sought teachings from the National Teacher Nanyang Huizhong (Wade–Giles: Nan-yang Hui-chung; Japanese: Nan’yō Echū). At some point he may also have studied under Nanquan Puyuan (748–835) (Wade–Giles: Nan-ch’üan P’u-yüan; Japanese: Nansen Fugan), a student of Mazu Daoyi (Wade–Giles: Ma-tsu Tao-i; Japanese: Baso Dōitsu) (709–788)

However, Huángbò&#x27;s main teacher was Baizhang Huaihai (Wade–Giles: Pai-chang Huai-hai; Japanese: Hyakujo Ekai), another Mazu student, and it was from Baizhang that Huángbò received Dharma transmission. According to Yuanwu Keqin&#x27;s commentary in &quot;The Blue Cliff Record&quot;, when Huángbò first met Baizhang, Baizhang exclaimed, “Magnificent! Imposing! Where have you come from?” Huángbò replied, “Magnificent and imposing, I’ve come from the mountains.” 

===Lung-hsing Monastery===
In 842, a prominent government official in Jiangxi province, Pei Xiu (Wade–Giles: P’ei Hsiu) (787 or 797–860), invited Huángbò to take up residence at Longxing Monastery. Pei was an ardent student of Chan and received teachings from Huángbò, eventually building a monastery for Huángbò around 846, which the master named Huang-po after the mountain where he had been a novice monk.

===Death===
Before Huángbò died, he named thirteen successors, the most prominent of which was Linji Yixuan. He was given the posthumous title (probably under the urging of Pei Xiu who became chief minister of the central government in 853) of “Chan Master Without Limits” (Tuan Chi Ch’an Shih).

John Blofeld says he died on Mount Huangbo during the T&#x27;ai Chung reign of the Tang dynasty, or between 847 and 859. Blofeld says his memorial pagoda is &quot;The Tower of Spacious Karma&quot; and that it was Emperor Hsüan Tsung who gave him the title &quot;The Zen Master Who Destroys All Limitations&quot;.

==Teachings==

===Sources===
What is known of Huángbò&#x27;s teachings comes from two texts, the &quot;Chuanxin Fayao&quot; (傳心法要, &quot;Essential of Mind Transmission&quot;) and the &quot;Wanling Lu&quot; (宛陵錄, &quot;Record of Wan-ling&quot;; Japanese: &quot;Enryōroku&quot;) written by Huángbò&#x27;s student, Pei Xiu. Pei compiled the teachings from his own notes and sent the manuscript to the senior monks on Mount Huangbo for further editing and emendation.

The “official” version of the Huángbò literature was published as part of the &quot;Transmission of the Lamp&quot;, Compiled during the Ching-te Period, in 1004. The record of Huángbò is more or less equally split between sermons by the master and question and answer dialogues between the master and his disciples and lay people.

===One Mind===
Huángbò&#x27;s teaching centered on the concept of “mind” (Chinese: 心 &quot;xin&quot;), a central issue for Buddhism since its inception. He taught that mind cannot be sought by the mind. One of his most important sayings was &quot;mind is the Buddha&quot;. He said: 
He also said: 
He also firmly rejected all dualism, especially between the “ordinary” and “enlightened” states: 
===A single spiritual brilliance===
Huangbo connected the One Mind with the single spiritual brilliance (or one pure radiance) of the &quot;Śūraṅgama Sūtra&quot;, which divides to become the six sense spheres. According to Huangbo, if one can recognize that the eighteen realms (the six sense organs, six sense objects, and corresponding six consciousnesses) have no objective existence, then the six sensory capabilities will be just a single spiritual brilliance.

Huangbo also likened mind to the sun which shines spontaneously, &quot;shining without intending to shine.&quot; For Huangbo, when one transcends the dharmas of being and non-being, one&#x27;s mind is like the sun whose brilliance shines naturally, and this requires no effort. Similarly, Huangbo said:
Consider the sunlight. You may say it is near, yet if you follow it from world to world you will never catch it in your hands. Then you may describe it as far away and, lo, you will see it just before your eyes. Follow it and, behold, it escapes you; run from it and it follows you close. You can neither possess it nor have done with it. From this example you can understand how it is with the true Nature of all things and, henceforth, there will be no need to grieve or to worry about such things.

===Tathāgatagarbha===
Since all is Buddha-mind, all actions reflect the Buddha, are actions of a Buddha. Huángbò&#x27;s teaching on this reflected the Indian concept of the tathāgatagarbha, the idea that within all beings is the nature of the Buddha. Therefore, Huángbò taught that seeking the Buddha was futile as the Buddha resided within: 
Huángbò was adamant that any form of “seeking” was not only useless, but obstructed clarity: 
Furthermore, he claimed that 
===The three bodies of a Buddha===
Regarding the three bodies of a Buddha (the dharmakāya, sambhogakāya, and nirmānakāya), Huangbo taught that the two form bodies, the sambhogakāya and nirmānakāya, were not the true Buddha. This is because the form bodies merely respond to circumstances and phenomena, giving teachings in accordance with the differing capabilities of sentient beings, in various appearances and guises. Moreover, for Huangbo, spoken Dharma that responds to events through the senses is not the real Dharma. On the other hand, the dharmakāya preaches the Dharma without anything that is preached or realized. Thus, Huangbo says, &quot;The Dharma body’s preaching of the Dharma cannot be sought with word, voice, shape, or [written] character. It is without anything that is preached and without anything that is realized, but is only the transparency of the self-nature.&quot;

===Non-attachment to written texts===
According to the accounts, Huángbò avoided clinging to written texts. This is exemplified by the following story:
:Pei Xiu presented Huángbò with a text he had written on his understanding of Chan.
:Huángbò placed the text down without looking at and after a long pause asked, “Do you understand?”
:Pei Xiu replied, “I don’t understand.”
:Huángbò said, “If it can be understood in this manner, then it isn’t the true teaching. If it can be seen in paper and ink, then it’s not the essence of our order.” 

What Huángbò knew was that students of Chan often became attached to “seeking” enlightenment and he constantly warned against this (and all attachment) as an obstruction to enlightenment: 
Although Huángbò often cautioned students against dependence on textual practices, pointing to the necessity of direct experience over sutra study, his record shows that he was familiar with a wide selection of Buddhist doctrines and texts, including the Diamond Sutra, the Vimalakīrti Sutra and the Lotus Sutra.

===Hitting and shouting===
Huángbò was also noted for the manner of his teaching, incorporating the hitting and shouting pioneered by Mazu. There are a number of instances in the record of Huángbò slapping students.

The Blue Cliff Record tells the story of the future emperor of China, hiding in the Chan community as a novice monk, receiving slaps from Huángbò for questioning why Huángbò was bowing to an image of the Buddha.

The most famous instance was when Linji Yixuan was directed by the head monk, Muzhou Daoming, to question Huángbò on the meaning of Buddhism after Linji had been practicing in Huángbò&#x27;s monastery for three years without an interview. Three times Linji went to Huángbò and three times the only answer he got was a slap.

His apparent disrespect was extended to his own position: 
===Overcoming fear===
While Huángbò was an uncompromising and somewhat fearsome Chan teacher, he understood the nature of fear in students when they heard the doctrine of emptiness and the Void: 
He taught that &quot;no activity&quot; was the gateway of his Dharma but that

<doc id="460661" wikidata="Q2112756" url="?curid=460661" title="Promenade deck">
<text>The promenade deck is a deck found on several types of passenger ships and riverboats. It usually extends from bow to stern, on both sides, and includes areas open to the outside, resulting in a continuous outside walkway suitable for &quot;promenading&quot; (i.e., walking), thus the name.

On older passenger ships, the promenade deck was simply the top outside deck below the superstructure, and was enclosed by a railing. Lifeboats are typically kept on davits accessible from the promenade. A 1919 glossary of marine terminology defined the promenade deck as a deck above the ship&#x27;s saloon, usually for the exclusive use of first-class passengers.

On a Mississippi riverboat, the promenade deck is the second deck, or floor, up from the waterline, above the main deck, and below the texas deck.

On modern cruise ships with superstructures as high and broad as the hull, the promenade deck is often largely enclosed, with railing-lined &quot;cutouts&quot; and wooden decking to recall the old days. The promenade may be used for jogging as well as walking, and signs indicate the mileage.

==Centerline promenade==

Many cruise ships and cruiseferries built by Aker Finnyards and its predecessor Kvaerner Masa-Yards have a wide, multi-deck promenade running along the center-line of the ship through most of the superstructure, also referred to as a horizontal atrium. This allows the majority of cabins on the upper decks to have a window, either to the port or starboard side or to the promenade. This design was first used in the cruiseferries and , built in 1990 and 1991, respectively. This was notably carried onto the , and the cruise ships operated by Royal Caribbean International, where it is referred to as the Royal Promenade.

<text>Homer Lusk Collyer (November 6, 1881March 21, 1947) and Langley Wakeman Collyer (October 3, 1885), known as the Collyer brothers, were two American brothers who became infamous for their bizarre natures and compulsive hoarding. The two lived in seclusion in their Harlem brownstone at 2078 Fifth Avenue (at the corner of 128th Street) in New York City where they obsessively collected books, furniture, musical instruments, and myriad other items, with booby traps set up in corridors and doorways to crush intruders. Both died in their home in March 1947 and were found (Homer on March 21, Langley on April 8) surrounded by more than 140 tons () of collected items that they had amassed over several decades.

Since the 1960s, the site of the former Collyer house has been a pocket park, named for the brothers.

==Family and education==
The Collyer brothers were sons of Herman Livingston Collyer (1857–1923), a Manhattan gynecologist who worked at Bellevue Hospital, and his first cousin, Susie Gage Frost Collyer (1856–1929), a former opera singer. The brothers claimed that their ancestors had traveled to America from England on the &quot;Fortune&quot;, the ship that arrived in Massachusetts in 1621, a year after the &quot;Mayflower&quot;. The Collyers&#x27; mother and father were both descended from the Livingstons, a New York family with roots going back to the 18th century. Robert Livingston was the first of the Livingston family to immigrate to America in 1672 — 52 years after the &quot;Mayflower&quot;. In 1880, Herman and Susie had their first child, a daughter they named Susan, who died at four months old. The following year, on November 6, the couple&#x27;s first son, Homer Lusk, was born. In 1885, their second son, Langley Wakeman, was born. At the time of Langley&#x27;s birth, the couple were living in a tenement while Herman Collyer interned at Bellevue. As a child, Homer attended PS (Public School) 69. At the age of 14, he was accepted to the College of the City of New York as a &quot;sub-freshman&quot;, earning his bachelor&#x27;s degree six years later.

Both Homer and Langley attended Columbia University, which had just relocated to its present-day Morningside Heights campus. Homer obtained a degree in admiralty law, while Langley studied engineering and chemistry. Langley was also an accomplished concert pianist; he played professionally for a time and performed at Carnegie Hall. Langley was also a layman of the Trinity Church where the family had been parishioners since 1697.

In 1909, Herman Collyer moved the family into a four-story brownstone in the Harlem neighborhood at 2078 Fifth Avenue. Dr. Collyer was known to be eccentric and was said to frequently paddle down the East River in a canoe to the City Hospital on Blackwell&#x27;s Island, where he occasionally worked, and then carry the canoe back to his home in Harlem after he came ashore on Manhattan Island. Around 1919, Herman and Susie Collyer separated. Dr. Collyer moved to a new home at 153 West 77th Street while Susie stayed in the Harlem brownstone. Homer and Langley, who had never married or lived on their own, chose to remain with their mother. Dr. Collyer died in 1923, leaving his sons all of his possessions, including items from his medical practice, which they brought to their home in Harlem. Susie Collyer died in 1929, leaving the brothers all her possessions and the Harlem brownstone.

==Seclusion and hoarding==
After their mother&#x27;s death, the Collyer brothers continued to live together in the Harlem brownstone they inherited. For the next four years, the brothers socialized with others and left their home on a regular basis. Homer continued to practice law while Langley worked as a piano dealer. Both also taught Sunday school at the Trinity Church. In 1933, Homer lost his eyesight due to hemorrhages in the back of his eyes. Langley quit his job to care for his brother and the two began to withdraw from society. As time progressed, the brothers became fearful due to changes in the neighborhood; the largely upper-class area changed dramatically due to the economic effects of the Great Depression. The brothers were also uncomfortable with the shift in racial demographics, as more African Americans moved into the once-empty apartment houses that were built near a projected subway route. When later asked why the two chose to shut themselves off from the world, Langley replied, &quot;We don&#x27;t want to be bothered.&quot;

As rumors about the brothers&#x27; unconventional lifestyle spread throughout Harlem, crowds began to congregate outside their home. The attention caused the brothers&#x27; fears to increase along with their eccentricities. After teenagers threw rocks at their windows, they boarded them up and wired the doors shut. After unfounded rumors spread throughout the neighborhood that the brothers&#x27; home contained valuables and large sums of money, several people attempted to burglarize the home. In an attempt to exclude burglars, Langley constructed booby traps and tunnels among the collection of items and trash that filled the house. The house soon became a maze of boxes, complicated tunnel systems consisting of junk and trash rigged with trip wires. The brothers lived in &quot;nests&quot; created amongst the debris that was piled to the ceiling.

Langley spent the majority of his time tinkering with various inventions, such as a device to vacuum the inside of pianos and a Model T Ford adapted to generate electricity. He also cared for his brother Homer. Langley later told a reporter that he fed and bathed his brother, read him classic literature, as he could no longer see, and played piano sonatas for him. He also tended to Homer&#x27;s health and was determined to cure his brother&#x27;s physical ailments through &quot;diet and rest&quot;. Langley concocted a diet for his brother consisting of one hundred oranges a week, black bread, and peanut butter, claiming that this regimen was curing Homer&#x27;s blindness. After Homer became paralyzed due to inflammatory rheumatism, he refused to seek professional medical treatment, because both brothers distrusted doctors. The brothers feared that if Homer sought medical attention, doctors would cut his optic nerve, leaving him permanently blind, and give him drugs that would hasten his death. Langley later told a reporter, &quot;You must remember that we are the sons of a doctor. We have a medical library of 15,000 books in the house. We decided we would not call in any doctors. You see, we knew too much about medicine.&quot;

Langley began venturing out of the house only after midnight and would walk miles all over the city to get food, sometimes going as far as the Williamsburg, Brooklyn section of the city to buy as little as a loaf of bread. He would also pick food out of the garbage and collect food that was going to be thrown out by grocers and butchers to bring back to his brother Homer.

By the early 1930s, the Collyer brothers&#x27; brownstone had fallen into disrepair. Their telephone was disconnected in 1937 and was never reconnected, as the brothers said they had no one to talk to. Because the brothers failed to pay their bills, the electricity, water, and gas were turned off in 1938. They took to warming the large house using only a small kerosene heater. For a time, Langley attempted to generate electricity by means of a car engine. Langley would fetch their water from a pump in a nearby park. Their only link to the outside world was via a crystal radio that Langley made.

Neighbors and shopkeepers in the area described Langley as a generally polite and rational man, but added that he was &quot;crazy&quot;. A reporter who interviewed Langley in 1942 described him as a &quot;soft-spoken old gentleman with a liking for privacy&quot; who spoke in a &quot;low, polite and cultivated voice&quot;. His appearance was disheveled; he sported a droopy mustache, wore a 1910 boating cap and his tattered clothes were held together by pins. While Langley ventured out of the home and occasionally interacted with other people, Homer had scarcely been seen or heard from since he went blind and retreated from the world in 1933. Langley was fiercely protective of Homer and would not allow anyone to see or speak to him. When he caught neighbors attempting to peek into their windows from a neighboring home, Langley bought the property for $7,500 cash. When a small fire broke out in the home in 1941, Langley refused to let firemen who extinguished the fire see or speak to his brother.

==Public scrutiny==
In 1932, shortly before Homer Collyer went blind, he purchased the lot across the street from their house at 2077 Fifth Avenue, with the intent of developing it by putting up an apartment building, but after the onset of his blindness, any plans of profit from the real estate venture ended. Since the Collyer brothers never paid any of their bills and stopped paying income taxes in 1931, the property was repossessed by the City of New York in 1943 to pay the $1,900 in back income taxes that the brothers owed. Langley protested the repossession of their property, saying that since they had no income, they should not have to pay income taxes.

While rumors and legends abounded in Harlem about the brothers, they came to wider attention when, in 1938, a story about their refusal to sell their home to a real estate agent for $125,000 appeared in &quot;The New York Times&quot;. The &quot;Times&quot; repeated information about the brothers&#x27; hoarding and also repeated neighborhood rumors that the brothers lived in some sort of &quot;Orientalist splendor&quot; and were sitting on vast piles of cash, afraid to deposit it in a bank. Neither rumor was true; however, the brothers were not insolvent.

After &quot;The New York Times&quot; story ran, Helen Worden, a reporter from &quot;New York World-Telegram&quot;, became interested in the brothers and interviewed Langley (Worden would release a book about the brothers in 1954). Langley told Worden that he stopped playing piano professionally after performing at Carnegie Hall because &quot;Paderewski followed me. He got better notices than I. What was the use of going on?&quot; Langley explained that he dressed in shabby clothing, because &quot;[T]hey would rob me if I didn&#x27;t&quot;.

The Collyer brothers made the news again when, in 1939, workers from Consolidated Edison attempted to force their way into the house to remove two gas meters that had been shut off in 1928, and were met with hostility from the reclusive brothers. The incident, publicized in the local press, reportedly drew a crowd of a thousand curious onlookers and was one of the few times Homer was seen outside their apartment. The brothers drew media attention again in August 1942 when the Bowery Savings Bank threatened to evict the Collyers for failing to pay their mortgage for three years. That same year, &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot; reporter Herbert Clyde Lewis interviewed Langley. In response to a query about the bundles of newspapers that were kept in the brothers&#x27; home, Langley replied, &quot;I am saving newspapers for Homer, so that when he regains his sight he can catch up on the news.&quot;

In November 1942, the Bowery Savings Bank began eviction procedures and sent a cleanup crew to the home. Langley began yelling at the workers, prompting the neighbors to summon the police. When the police attempted to force their way into the home by smashing down the front door, they were stymied by a sheer wall of junk piled from floor to ceiling. They found Langley in a clearing he had made in the middle of the debris. Without comment, Langley made out a check for $6,700 ( equivalent of $), paying off the mortgage in full in a single payment. He then ordered everyone off the premises, and withdrew from outside scrutiny once more, emerging only at night when he wanted to file criminal complaints against intruders, get food, or collect items that piqued his interest.

==Homer Collyer&#x27;s death==

On March 21, 1947, an anonymous tipster who identified himself only as &quot;Charles Smith&quot; phoned the 22nd Police Precinct and insisted there was a dead body in the house. The caller claimed that the smell of decomposition was emanating from the house. As the police were used to calls from neighbors about the Collyer brothers&#x27; home, a patrol officer was dispatched. The responding officer initially had a difficult time getting into the house. There was no doorbell or telephone and the doors were locked; and though the basement windows were broken, they were protected by iron grillwork. An emergency squad of seven men eventually had no choice but to begin pulling out all of the junk that was blocking their way and throw it out onto the street below. The brownstone&#x27;s foyer was packed solid by a wall of old newspapers, folding beds and chairs, half a sewing machine, boxes, parts of a wine press, and numerous other pieces of junk. A patrolman finally broke in through a window into a second-story bedroom. Behind this window lay, among other things, more packages and newspaper bundles, empty cardboard boxes lashed together with rope, the frame of a baby carriage, a rake, and old umbrellas tied together. After five hours of digging, Homer Collyer&#x27;s body was found in an alcove surrounded by filled boxes and newspapers that were piled to the ceiling. Homer was wearing a tattered blue-and-white bathrobe, his matted, grey hair reached his shoulders, and his head was resting on his knees.

The medical examiner confirmed Homer&#x27;s identity and said that he had been dead for approximately ten hours. According to the medical examiner, Homer died from starvation and heart disease. Police initially suspected that Langley Collyer was the man who phoned in the anonymous tip regarding his brother&#x27;s death and theorized that he fled the house before police arrived. It was later discovered that, in fact, a neighbor had called police based on a rumor he had heard. A police officer was posted outside the home to wait for Langley, but he never arrived. Police began to suspect that Langley was dead when he failed to attend Homer&#x27;s funeral, held on April 1.

==Langley Collyer&#x27;s discovery==
After the discovery of Homer&#x27;s body, rumors began circulating that Langley had been seen aboard a bus heading for Atlantic City. A manhunt along the New Jersey shore turned up nothing. Reports of Langley sightings led police to a total of nine states. The police continued searching the house, removing 3,000 books, including several outdated phone books, a horse&#x27;s jawbone, a Steinway piano, an early X-ray machine, and more bundles of newspapers. More than nineteen tons of junk were removed from the ground floor of the brownstone. The police continued to clear away the brothers&#x27; stockpile for another week, removing another eighty-four tons of trash and junk from the house. Although a good deal of the junk came from their father&#x27;s medical practice, a considerable portion was discarded items collected by Langley over the years. Approximately 2,000 people stood outside the home to watch the clean-up effort.

On April 8, 1947, a workman found the body of Langley Collyer ten feet (3 m) from where Homer had died. Langley was found in a two-foot (60 cm) wide tunnel lined with rusty bed springs and a chest of drawers. His decomposing body, which was the actual source of the smell reported by the anonymous tipster, had been partially eaten by rats and was covered by a suitcase, bundles of newspapers and three metal bread boxes. The medical examiner determined that Langley had died around March 9. Police theorized that Langley was crawling through the tunnel to take food to his paralyzed brother when he inadvertently tripped a booby trap he had created and got crushed by debris. His death was attributed to asphyxiation.

The brothers were buried next to their parents in unmarked graves at Cypress Hills Cemetery, in the Brooklyn borough.

==House contents==
Police and workmen removed approximately 120 tons of valuables, junk and other items from the Collyer brownstone. Items were removed from the house such as baby carriages, a doll carriage, rusted bicycles, old food, potato peelers, a collection of guns, glass chandeliers, bowling balls, camera equipment, the folding top of a horse-drawn carriage, a sawhorse, three body forms, painted portraits, photos of pin-up girls from the early 1900s, plaster busts, Mrs. Collyer&#x27;s hope chests, rusty bed springs, the kerosene stove, a child&#x27;s chair (the brothers were lifelong bachelors and childless), more than 25,000 books (including thousands about medicine and engineering and more than 2,500 on law), human organs pickled in jars, eight live cats, the chassis of the old Model T with which Langley had been tinkering, tapestries, hundreds of yards of unused silks and other fabrics, clocks, fourteen pianos (both grand and upright), a clavichord, two organs, banjos, violins, bugles, accordions, a gramophone and records, and countless bundles of newspapers and magazines, some of them decades old, and thousands of bottles and tin cans and a great deal of garbage. Near the spot where Homer had died, police also found 34 bank account passbooks, with a total of $3,007 (about $ as of ).

Some of the more unusual items found in the home were exhibited at Hubert&#x27;s Dime Museum, where they were featured alongside Human Marvels and sideshow performers. The centerpiece of this display was the chair in which Homer Collyer had died. The Collyer chair passed into the hands of private collectors upon being removed from public exhibit in 1956.

The house, having long gone without maintenance, was decaying: the roof leaked, and some walls had caved in, showering bricks and mortar on the rooms below. The house was deemed &quot;unsafe and [a] fire hazard&quot; in July 1947 and was razed later that month.

Most of the items found in the Collyer brothers&#x27; house were deemed worthless and were disposed of. The salvageable items fetched about $2,000 at auction; the cumulative estate of the Collyer brothers was valued at $91,000 (equivalent to $ in ), of which $20,000 worth was personal property (jewelry, cash, securities, and the like). Fifty-six people, mostly first and second cousins, made claims for the estate. A Pittsburgh woman named Ella Davis claimed to be the long lost sister of the Collyers. Davis&#x27; claim was dismissed after she failed to provide a birth certificate to prove her identity (years earlier, Davis claimed she was the widow of Peter Liebach, another wealthy recluse, from Pittsburgh, who was found murdered in 1937). In October 1952, the New York County court decided that twenty-three of the claimants were to split the estate equally.

==In popular culture==
*A Collyer&#x27;s Mansion (also Collyer Mansion or just Collyer) is a modern East Coast firefighting term for a dwelling of hoarders that is so filled with trash and debris it becomes a serious danger to the occupants and emergency responders.
*In the 1955–1956 &quot;Classic 39&quot; season of &quot;The Honeymooners&quot; (&quot;The Worry Wart&quot;), affable neighbor Ed Norton, chiding Ralph Kramden for his thriftiness, quips &quot;Congratulations on that 93 cent gas bill, Ralph ... You broke the all-time low gas bill record, set by the Collyer brothers in 1931!&quot;
*The 1995 movie &quot;Unstrung Heroes&quot; features two uncles whose lifestyle and apartment are a direct homage to the Collyer brothers. The film was based on a 1991 memoir by Franz Lidz, who, in 2003, published &quot;Ghosty Men: The Strange but True Story of the Collyer Brothers, New York&#x27;s Greatest Hoarders&quot;. &quot;Ghosty Men&quot; also chronicles the parallel life of Arthur Lidz, the hermit uncle of &quot;Unstrung Heroes&quot;, who grew up near the Collyer mansion and was inspired by the brothers.
*The 1999 &quot;Frasier&quot; episode &quot;The Dinner Party&quot; includes references to the Collyer brothers. Frasier and Niles&#x27; father, Martin, unfavorably compares the Crane brothers to Homer and Langley. Martin describes the Collyers as &quot;a couple of nutsos&quot; who shared an apartment filled with catacombs of junk. Frasier and Niles dismiss Martin&#x27;s comparison, but in a silent scene played out over the show&#x27;s credits, Frasier is seen hurriedly removing bundled newspapers from his apartment. 
*The 2009 novel &quot;Homer &amp; Langley&quot;, by E. L. Doctorow, is a work of historical fiction that speculates on the brothers&#x27; inner lives. Taking considerable historical liberties, the novel extends their lifespans into the late 1970s and switches the brothers&#x27; birth order.
*Matt Bell&#x27;s short story &quot;The Collectors&quot; focuses on the months leading up to the Collyers&#x27; deaths, as well as exploring Langley&#x27;s memories of their past and the effects on the people who discover their bodies. It was first published in 2009 as a chapbook, then included in Bell&#x27;s debut collection &quot;How They Were Found&quot; in 2010.
*The brothers are also the inspiration behind Richard Greenberg&#x27;s play &quot;The Dazzle&quot;, which played in London in the winter of 2015–16. Andrew Scott and David Dawson played Langley and Homer respectively in the production by Emily Dobbs, which was staged at the former site of the Central Saint Martins School of Art on Charing Cross Road.
*A 1973 episode of the television show &quot;The Streets of San Francisco&quot; titled &quot;The House on Hyde Street&quot; was inspired by the Collyers.

<text>Debenhams plc was a British department store chain that operated in the United Kingdom, Ireland and Denmark, as well as franchised locations across Europe and the Asia Pacific.

The company was founded in 1778 as a single store in London and grew to 178 locations across those countries, also owning the Danish department store chain Magasin du Nord. In its final years, its headquarters were within the premises of its flagship store in Oxford Street, London. The range of goods sold included middle-to-high-end clothing, beauty, household items, and furniture.

The company suffered financial difficulties in the 21st century and entered administration twice, in April 2019 and April 2020. In November 2020, Debenhams&#x27; main concession operator Arcadia also entered administration, leading to the collapse of talks with JD Sports and Frasers Group over a potential rescue. As a result, Debenhams announced it would be liquidated.

The Debenhams brand and website were purchased by the online retailer Boohoo for £55M in January 2021. However, Boohoo did not retain any stores, meaning the loss of up to 12,000 jobs. Boohoo relaunched the website as Debenhams.com on 12 April 2021 under its own company, Debenhams.com Online Limited, when Debenhams&#x27; stores reopened to begin closing down sales following a relaxation of some COVID-19 restrictions. After 243 years in business, the remaining Debenhams department stores closed for the final time during May 2021.

==History==
===18th and 19th centuries===

The business was formed in 1778 by William Clark, who began trading at 44 Wigmore Street in London as a drapers&#x27; store. In 1813, William Debenham became a partner and the corporate name changed to &quot;Clark &amp; Debenham&quot;. The shop was later renamed Cavendish House and sold drapery, silks, haberdashery, millinery, hosiery, lace, and family mourning goods. As the trade grew, the partners determined to expand the business by opening branches in Cheltenham and Harrogate.

By 1823, Clark &amp; Debenham had opened a small drapery business at 3 Promenade Rooms, Cheltenham, selling a selection of silks, muslins, shawls, gloves, lace and fancy goods. In 1837, Clark retired from the business and Debenham took two of his most trusted staff, William Pooley and John Smith, as partners, trading in both London and Cheltenham as Debenham, Pooley &amp; Smith. By 1840, the management of the Cheltenham branch appears to have been given to Clement Freebody, Debenham&#x27;s brother-in-law. Around 1843, another branch shop was launched in Harrogate.

Extended and refurbished premises opened in Cheltenham in October 1844. Pooley and Smith retired from the business in 1851 when Debenham took his son, William, and Clement Freebody into partnership, trading as Debenham, Son &amp; Freebody. At this time all three shops in London, Cheltenham, and Harrogate were trading in similar goods and issued a joint catalogue, called the Fashion Book, that was the basis of an extensive mail-order trade. In 1876 when Freebody retired, a new partnership, Debenham &amp; Hewitt, was formed. George Hewitt appears to have worked at the Cheltenham store as a draper&#x27;s assistant during the early 1860s but details of his subsequent career are not known. By 1883, George Hewitt was the sole owner of the Cheltenham business, Frank and William Debenham having withdrawn to manage the London store as a separate concern.

===20th century===

The business was incorporated as &quot;Debenhams Limited&quot; in 1905. A new headquarters building, which was designed by William Wallace and James Glen Sivewright Gibson and built by Trollope &amp; Colls, was completed in Wigmore Street in 1908. Debenhams at this time did not operate any other department stores, but did supply to others across the country via its wholesale business. It was because of the debts owed to them through their wholesaling deals that they acquired control over Marshall &amp; Snelgrove at Oxford Street and Harvey Nichols in Knightsbridge both in London in 1919. The business at this time was run by Ernest Debenham and his close friend Frederick Oliver. In 1926, Oliver retired, and upon the advice of the Whitehall Trust, Debenhams Securities was formed to buy Oliver&#x27;s share in the business, with Ernest Debenham as chair and being joined by Frederick Richmond and Maurice Wright.

However, during the mid-1920s, several new investment groups were created and started buying up regional drapers and department stores. Clarence Hatry had created the Drapery Trust in 1925, while Charterhouse Bank&#x27;s company, Charterhouse Investments Trust (under Sir Arthur Wheeler, 1st Baronet), had created United Drapery Stores in 1927, and Selfridge Provincial Stores was created by James White and Gordon Selfridge in 1926. These were seen to be a threat to Debenhams&#x27; wholesale business, as the company would lose sales to these new combined groups. Frederick Richmond and Maurice Wright thought it was too late to start creating a provincial group, so started negotiations with Clarence Hatry in 1927 to purchase the Drapery Trust. By November the deal was agreed for £2,350,000, mostly funded through Hatry&#x27;s company Austin Friars Trust purchasing £1,600,000 of Debenhams shares.

As part of the deal, Ernest Debenham was forced out of the business, along with his son Peter. In a letter to &quot;The Times&quot;, Ernest wrote

The new enlarged company was offered to the public in February 1928, with the release of 2 million preference shares through merchant bank M. Samuel &amp; Co, with the company being first listed on the London Stock Exchange later that year. In 1929, as part of his fraudulent plan to raise the cash for his deal to purchase United Steel, Hatry forged £478,100 of shares in the Drapery Trust, but by September 1929 he had confessed to his crimes. The connection of Clarence Hatry to Debenhams plunged the company into a crisis once his finances started to unravel, in addition to the Drapery Trust dividend collapsing and its export business diving due to the economy. Maurice Wright completed a rewriting of the capital in 1934, and merged the three operations, Debenhams, Debenhams Securities and Drapery Trust, slashing the company&#x27;s issued capital from £15,100,000 to £6,000,000. Wright would later be made Managing Director, before becoming Chairman in 1948.

During the 1930s and 1940s the company continued to expand, becoming the biggest department store company in the country by 1948, with the stores retaining their original names until a reorganisation in the 1970s. In 1944 the company announced a post-tax profit of £249,605. An example of these acquisitions was the purchase of the Norwich stores of Buntings and Chamberlains in 1949, leading to them controlling four of the city&#x27;s department stores. During 1957, the company purchased the ladies fashion store, Cresta, from W. Garfield Weston&#x27;s Howardsgate Holdings. In 1959 the business failed in a takeover of rival department store group Harrods, rivalling United Drapery Stores and eventual winner House of Fraser.

The company closed several branches in 1970, with Birmingham (Marshall &amp; Snelgrove, formerly Warwick House), Manchester (Marshall &amp; Snelgrove in St Annes Place), Sheffield (Marshall &amp; Snelgrove, Leopold Street) and Southsea (Plummers, Palmerston Road) properties being sold by auction. In 1972, United Drapery Stores made an offer to purchase Debenhams, along with interest from Sears plc and Tesco, but were fought off by chairman Sir Anthony Burney. The company entered the superstore revolution by opening two Scan Superstores, which sold an assortment of Debenhams normal products in a supermarket like environment. In 1976 the company acquired Browns of Chester. It remained the only one of the company&#x27;s UK stores to have retained an individual identity until all stores closed in 2021. The business diversified during the 1970s buying South East based supermarket group Cater Brothers in 1972, after the death of its chairman Leslie Cater. Using the new purchasing power Debenhams modernised its 40 food halls within its stores, branding them Cater&#x27;s Food Halls, and opened two new Cater superstores. However the business declined in the intense marketplace and in 1979 the chain was sold to Allied Suppliers who converted the Cater stores into their Presto format. Debenham&#x27;s other experiment into the superstore market, the two Scan Superstores were sold to Tesco in February 1978. Other diversifications included Greens Cameras &amp; High-Fi and New Dimension, a home furniture and furnishing business. The company continued to open new stores, with Mansfield, Stirling and Eltham being opened in 1977. The company at times struggled in the 1970s, with a former chief executive stating it had

The company closed its ladies clothing chain Cresta in 1980, selling 27 of the stores to Irvine Sellar&#x27;s fashion group, which also purchased the York store which was rebranded as Marshalls by Sellars. This followed on from the £1.7 million sale of Greens Photography and Hifi to Dixons in late 1979.
Debenhams was targeted three times during the 1980s by the Animal Liberation Front in protest at the sale of animal furs in stores. Stores in Romford, Luton, and Harrow were fire-bombed by members, the worst attack being on the Luton store. As a result, the company stopped selling clothes with animal furs. It was alleged by Caroline Lucas MP in a debate in Westminster Hall that Bob Lambert, a then undercover police officer, planted the fire bomb that caused £340,000 worth of damage to the Harrow branch of Debenhams in 1987. It is unclear if anything has come of these allegations as of March 2014. 

In 1985 the company was acquired by the Burton Group. At the time of the takeover deal, Burtons claimed,

Following the closure of the store in Dudley in January 1981 and the Birmingham store in 1983, the company&#x27;s only store in the West Midlands for the next six years was a town centre store in Walsall. On 4 November 1989, it opened a store at the Merry Hill Shopping Centre in Brierley Hill.

Debenhams entered Ireland as the anchor store at the Jervis Shopping Centre in Dublin in 1996, and then established a second anchor store at Mahon Point Shopping Centre in Cork in 2005.

Debenhams demerged from the Burton Group in January 1998 and was once again listed as a separate company on the London Stock Exchange. It expanded under the leadership of Belinda Earl who was appointed CEO in 2000.

===21st century===

Debenhams opened its largest British store on 4 September 2003, at the new Bull Ring shopping centre in Birmingham. The new store contained 19,230 sq m and opened 20 years after the company closed its Birmingham city centre store due to declining trade. A private consortium named Baroness Retail Limited, comprising CVC Capital Partners, Texas Pacific Group, Merrill Lynch Global Private Equity and management, acquired the company in November 2003 in a leveraged buyout, for which the consortium only provided £600m of equity and added £1.2bn in debt. According to &quot;The Financial Times&quot;, the consortium &quot;then extracted more than £1bn via property sale and leaseback agreements&quot;, before returning the business to a listing on the London Stock Exchange in 2006.

On 8 August 2006, it was announced that Debenhams would buy the leaseholds of nine of the 11 Roches Stores department stores in Ireland for €29 million. Under the deal, the stores, including those in St. Patrick&#x27;s Street in Cork and Henry Street in Dublin would be rebranded as Debenhams stores. The Roche family retained the ownership of the stores, and Debenhams became the new tenants.
The company purchased the brand name and stock of Principles in March 2009 after the business entered administration. Principles operated concessions within 121 Debenhams stores, and was subsequently relaunched by Ben de Lisi as part of the Designers at Debenhams range. In November 2009, Debenhams acquired the Danish department store group Magasin Du Nord for £12.3 million. The company operates six stores in Denmark under the Magasin brand.

In July 2010 Debenhams purchased the 115 Faith concessions trading within its stores, after Faith entered administration. In April 2012 the company announced it would be building 14 new stores, and was in negotiations over a further 25 sites in the UK. Debenhams agreed to become the anchor store at the Riverside shopping centre in Shrewsbury. By September 2012, the company announced that like-for-like sales had risen by 3.3% in the six months up to that date.
Debenhams moved to a new headquarters in 2013, in Brock Street, London built by British Land. The company leased of office space from British Land for 25 years. The company began a refurbishment of its flagship store in Oxford Street, London in 2013, which involved the installation of 180,000 aluminium tiles on the exterior of the building that appears to ripple with the wind. An existing floor was also converted to become a trading floor. The total cost of the refurbishment was in the region of £40 million, of which Debenhams contributed £25 million. The owner of the building, British Land, also contributed towards the cost. The refurbishment was due to be completed by February 2014.

The company&#x27;s trading statement for the 17 weeks up to 28 December 2013 was released on 31 December 2013, and revealed a reduction in pre-tax profit from £115 million to £85 million. On 2 January 2014, the company&#x27;s chief financial officer Simon Herrick resigned, following criticism of his financial decisions. On 13 January 2014 4.6% of Debenhams shares were bought by Sports Direct, the retailer run by Mike Ashley. The stock market purchase of 56.8 million shares (worth around £46m) was made without the prior knowledge of the Debenhams board. Sports Direct stated at the time it intends to be a supportive share holder. The Debenhams board responded by stating they are open-minded with regard to exploring operational opportunities to improve its performance. Sports Direct sold its shares on 16 January 2014, although they took out an option to buy further shares up to a total of 6.6%. In August 2017, it emerged that Ashley had secured 21% of the shares which gave him over 10% of voting rights in the company.

During 2017 Debenhams opened two new stores, one in Stevenage and one in Wolverhampton. The 80,000 sq ft Stevenage store was opened on 24 August 2017 at Roaring Meg Retail and Leisure Park by Celebrity fashion designer Julien MacDonald and local hero Jean Robinson, who had won a competition for the privilege. The store was the first to be designed under the vision of CEO Sergio Bucher, with a new layout and format with the emphasis on encouraging people to stay longer.
The second store to open during 2017 was the new 93,000 sq ft store at Wolverhampton&#x27;s Mander Centre. The store was opened on 12 October 2017 as part of the centre&#x27;s £35 million refurbishments, it was also Debenhams&#x27; first store in Wolverhampton. It was only the second to feature the new layout previously only seen in the Stevenage store, and only the second to feature the company&#x27;s new deli-restaurant format Loaf &amp; Bloom, only previously seen at Milton Keynes.

In February 2018, the company announced a reduction of up to 320 store management roles across the business by the end of March. Sports Direct increased its holding in the company to 29.7% on 2 March, just below the level whereby it would be required to submit a formal takeover approach.

====Financial difficulties====
After media speculation about Debenhams&#x27; survival, in 2018 the company announced the largest loss in its history, a pre-tax loss of £491 million, and the closure of up to 50 stores with the potential loss of 4,000 jobs.

On 9 April 2019, the company announced that they had gone into pre-pack administration.

On 26 April 2019, the company announced that in addition to rent reductions on all except 39 stores, 22 stores would close after Christmas 2019. This included the recently opened Wolverhampton store plus Altrincham, Ashford, Birmingham Fort, Canterbury, Chatham, Eastbourne, Folkestone, Great Yarmouth, Guildford, Kirkcaldy, Orpington, Slough, Southport, Southsea, Staines, Stockton-on-Tees, Walton-on-Thames, Wandsworth, Welwyn Garden City, Wimbledon and Witney.

On 6 April 2020, Debenhams confirmed it had filed a notice of intent to appoint administrators. CEO Stefaan Vansteenkiste said it was due to &quot;unprecedented&quot; circumstances caused by the COVID-19 lockdown and was to &quot;protect [the] business, ... employees, and other important stakeholders&quot;. On 9 April 2020, the company went into administration.

On 9 April 2020, Debenhams confirmed it planned to close 11 stores in Ireland with immediate effect.

In April 2020, Debenhams closed seven UK stores and was set to close five more when Coronavirus restrictions were lifted. This included the Croydon store that anchored the Centrale shopping mall (previously the Drummond Centre) that Debenhams had acquired when they took over the Kennards chain of stores, bringing to a close a trading period of more than 150 years from that site.

In July 2020, Debenhams was set to abandon its property in Princes Street in Edinburgh, which it leased from Legal &amp; General, in order to make room for a £50m hotel. In the same month, Debenhams put itself up for sale to prevent it going into liquidation, hoping to find a buyer by September. In August 2020, the company announced it was cutting 2,500 job positions as a result of the economic effects of the pandemic. The job cuts affected store management positions; sales managers, visual merchandise managers, and selling support managers were set to be axed. According to the company, &quot;The trading environment is clearly a long way from returning to normal. Such difficult decisions are being taken by many retailers right now, and we will continue to take all necessary steps to give Debenhams every chance of a viable future.&quot; In September 2020, Debenhams put its seven store Danish chain, Magasin du Nord, up for sale. Magasin Du Nord was later sold to German department store Peek &amp; Cloppenburg for £120 million.

On 1 December 2020, after the collapse of talks with Arcadia (which went into administration the previous day) and JD Sports over a potential rescue, Debenhams announced it was going into liquidation, putting 12,000 jobs in 124 UK stores at risk unless the administrators could find buyers for all or parts of the business. With the company in administration and on the verge of liquidation, on 6 December 2020, Mike Ashley&#x27;s Frasers Group was reported to be in talks to acquire Debenhams, though it was later reported that Ashley was mainly interested in using empty Debenhams stores to expand his other chains, including House of Fraser, Sports Direct and Flannels; taking &#x27;vacant possession&#x27; would avoid redundancy costs for existing staff.

On 13 January 2021, Debenhams announced it would permanently shut six stores in England due to the COVID-19 lockdown. They included the flagship Oxford Street store in London, plus those in Worcester, Weymouth, Staines, Harrogate and Portsmouth; the move involved 320 job losses.

On 25 January 2021, it was announced that Boohoo had bought the Debenhams brand and website for £55m, but did not retain any of the remaining 118 stores, meaning the loss of up to 12,000 jobs. Boohoo relaunched the website as Debenhams.com in April that year. On 5 May 2021, the liquidator announced that all remaining UK stores would close on 15 May 2021, marking the end of Debenhams as a department store retailer in the UK after 243 years. Despite the closure in the UK, Debenhams in Middle East countries remained unaffected and continues its operations as of June 2023.

==Products and services==

In 1993 the company introduced the &#x27;Designers at Debenhams&#x27; brand, the creation of then CEO Belinda Earl, Ben de Lisi and Spencer Hawken. The idea introduced designer names and brands such as Jasper Conran, John Rocha, Butterfly by Matthew Williamson, H! by Henry Holland, Star by Julien Macdonald, Frost French, Janet Reger, Ted Baker, St George by Duffer, Jeff Banks, and Ben de Lisi. The company also started selling goods under a number of brand names that it owned. In 2010, Debenhams announced the launch of four new designer names to its fashion range: Jonathan Saunders, Preen, Jonathan Kelsey, and Roksanda Ilincic.
Stores also contained concessions whereby other retailers could trade. Brands in stores include Oasis, Coast, Phase Eight and Warehouse. In June 2014, the company announced a trial of Sports Direct concessions in its Harrow and Southsea stores, which if successful would be expanded to other stores. This followed the purchase of a stake in Debenhams by Mike Ashley, the owner of Sports Direct, in January 2014. Later that year, Debenhams also launched trials of Costa Coffee and Mothercare concessions within stores.

In October 2016, the company announced it would begin to focus less on clothing and more on food, beauty products and gifts. It also hired the former lighting buying team of collapsed rival BHS to begin introducing new lighting departments in stores. Debenhams followed this in December 2016 with a plan to discontinue its Betty Jackson Black ladies fashion brand, and significantly reduce its Jeff Banks menswear range in favour of expanding the Hammond &amp; Co. brand.

The company operated retail websites in the UK and Ireland, as well as a mobile-enabled website and mobile apps that allowed customers to shop the online range and scan product barcodes in store.

Debenhams provided store card and credit card services, operated by NewDay. Insurance products were also provided under the Debenhams brand by other financial companies. Debenhams also operated bureaux de change in selected stores. The company ran a loyalty card programme, branded the Debenhams Beauty Club, where customers could collect points with the purchase of health and beauty products.

In 1956, Debenhams owned or controlled through its subsidiary, the Drapery Trust, the following businesses, which it rated in different classes:
In addition, the business ran several wholesale businesses including, amongst others Debenhams Wholesale, Chamberlins, DLMS and St Aldate Warehouse.

In 1979, it was reported that Debenhams operated 70 department stores in England, 2 in Wales and 1 in Scotland, though the following still operated under their original names:

*Swan &amp; Edgar, London 
*Harvey Nichols, London 
*Browns, Chester
*Corders, Ipswich 
*Garlands, Norwich 
*Plummers, Southampton 
*Hills, Hove

The company also operated 33 Cresta Fashion stores, 22 Caters Supermarkets, 109 Lotus shoeshops, toy and sports retailer Hamleys, Greens Cameras &amp; Hifi and News Dimension, a home furniture and furnishings company.

As of December 2020, the company owned and operated 124 stores in the United Kingdom, and 7 under the Magasin du Nord brand in Denmark. Debenhams occupied the most sites of any of the traditional department store groups in the UK. The majority of the original trading names of the stores, in each of their respective locations, were replaced with the &quot;Debenhams&quot; name during the 1970s. All the department stores in the group traded as &quot;Debenhams&quot; (although the store in Chester was still dual-signed as Debenhams and Browns of Chester).

In April 2020, stores operated in Ireland by Debenhams Ireland ceased trading with the loss of nearly 2,000 jobs.

<doc id="460672" wikidata="Q5988007" url="?curid=460672" title="Ideal norm">
<text>In commutative algebra, the norm of an ideal is a generalization of a norm of an element in the field extension. It is particularly important in number theory since it measures the size of an ideal of a complicated number ring in terms of an ideal in a less complicated ring. When the less complicated number ring is taken to be the ring of integers, Z, then the norm of a nonzero ideal &quot;I&quot; of a number ring &quot;R&quot; is simply the size of the finite quotient ring &quot;R&quot;/&quot;I&quot;.

== Relative norm ==
Let &quot;A&quot; be a Dedekind domain with field of fractions &quot;K&quot; and integral closure of &quot;B&quot; in a finite separable extension &quot;L&quot; of &quot;K&quot;. (this implies that &quot;B&quot; is also a Dedekind domain.) Let formula_1 and formula_2 be the ideal groups of &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot;, respectively (i.e., the sets of nonzero fractional ideals.) Following the technique developed by Jean-Pierre Serre, the norm map
:formula_3
is the unique group homomorphism that satisfies
:formula_4
for all nonzero prime ideals formula_5 of &quot;B&quot;, where formula_6 is the prime ideal of &quot;A&quot; lying below formula_5.
Alternatively, for any formula_8 one can equivalently define formula_9 to be the fractional ideal of &quot;A&quot; generated by the set formula_10 of field norms of elements of &quot;B&quot;.

For formula_11, one has formula_12, where formula_13.

The ideal norm of a principal ideal is thus compatible with the field norm of an element:
:formula_14

Let formula_15 be a Galois extension of number fields with rings of integers formula_16.

Then the preceding applies with formula_17, and for any formula_18 we have
:formula_19
which is an element of formula_20.

The notation formula_21 is sometimes shortened to formula_22, an abuse of notation that is compatible with also writing formula_22 for the field norm, as noted above.
In the case formula_24, it is reasonable to use positive rational numbers as the range for formula_25 since formula_26 has trivial ideal class group and unit group formula_27, thus each nonzero fractional ideal of formula_26 is generated by a uniquely determined positive rational number.
Under this convention the relative norm from formula_29 down to formula_24 coincides with the absolute norm defined below.

== Absolute norm ==

Let formula_29 be a number field with ring of integers formula_32, and formula_33 a nonzero (integral) ideal of formula_32.

The absolute norm of formula_33 is
:formula_36
By convention, the norm of the zero ideal is taken to be zero.

If formula_37 is a principal ideal, then
:formula_38.

The norm is completely multiplicative: if formula_33 and formula_40 are ideals of formula_32, then

:formula_42.

Thus the absolute norm extends uniquely to a group homomorphism
:formula_43
defined for all nonzero fractional ideals of formula_32.

The norm of an ideal formula_33 can be used to give an upper bound on the field norm of the smallest nonzero element it contains:

there always exists a nonzero formula_46 for which
:formula_47
where

:* formula_48 is the discriminant of formula_29 and
:* formula_50 is the number of pairs of (non-real) complex embeddings of into formula_51 (the number of complex places of ).

<doc id="460674" wikidata="Q688951" url="?curid=460674" title="Declaration of Pillnitz">
<text>The Declaration of Pillnitz was a statement of five sentences issued on 27 August 1791 at Pillnitz Castle near Dresden (Saxony) by Frederick William II of Prussia and the Habsburg Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor who was Marie Antoinette&#x27;s brother. It declared the joint support of the Holy Roman Empire and of Prussia for King Louis XVI of France against the French Revolution.

==Background==
Since the French Revolution of 1789, Leopold had become increasingly concerned about the safety of his sister, Marie Antoinette, and her family but felt that any intervention in French affairs would only increase their danger. At the same time, many French aristocrats were fleeing France and taking up residence in neighbouring countries, spreading fear of the Revolution and agitating for foreign support to Louis XVI. After Louis and his family had fled Paris in the hopes of inciting a counter-revolution, known as the Flight to Varennes in June 1791, Louis had been apprehended and was returned to Paris and kept under armed guard. On 6 July 1791, Leopold issued the Padua Circular, calling on the sovereigns of Europe to join him in demanding Louis&#x27; freedom.

==Purpose==
Calling on European powers to intervene if Louis was threatened, the declaration was intended to serve as a warning to the French revolutionaries to stop infringing on the king&#x27;s prerogatives and to permit his resumption of power.

The declaration stated that Austria would go to war if and only if all the other major European powers also went to war with France. Leopold chose this wording so that he would not be forced to go to war. He knew that the British prime minister, William Pitt, did not support war with France. Leopold issued the declaration only to satisfy the French émigrés who had taken refuge in his country and were calling for foreign interference in their homeland.

(The Pillnitz Conference itself dealt mainly with the Polish Question and the war of Austria against the Ottoman Empire.)

==Text of the Declaration==
==Consequences==
The National Assembly of France interpreted the declaration to mean that Austria and Prussia were threatening the revolution, which had the result of radicalising the French revolutionaries and increasing tensions. The National Assembly voted for the French annexation of the Comtat Venaissin including Avignon from the Papal States in September 1791. Austria and Prussia concluded a defensive alliance in February 1792. Radical Frenchmen who called for war, such as Jacques Pierre Brissot, used the Declaration of Pillnitz as a pretext to gain influence and declare war on 20 April 1792, leading to the campaigns of 1792 in the French Revolutionary Wars.

<doc id="460679" wikidata="Q490643" url="?curid=460679" title="Kokshetau">
<text>Kokshetau (; ; ; ), formerly known as Kokchetav (; ) between 1868 and 1993, is a lakeside city in northern Kazakhstan and the capital of Akmola Region. It stretches along the southern shore of Lake Kopa, lying in the north of Kokshetau Hills, a northern subsystem of the Kokshetau Uplands (Saryarka) and the southern edge of the Ishim Steppe. It is named after Mount Kokshe.

Kokshetau is the 17th-most populous city in Kazakhstan, the 4th-most populous city in northern part of the country, and the largest city in Akmola Region. It was the administrative center of Kokshetau Region (oblast) from 1944 to 1991 as part of the Soviet Union and from 1991 as part of Kazakhstan to 1997 when it was abolished. It is also situated at the junction of the Trans-Kazakhstan and South Siberian railways. Kokshetau lies at an elevation of approximately above sea level. The climate of Kokshetau features hot summers and cold winters.

It has 176,849 inhabitants (2024 est.), up from 123,389 (1999 census), while Akmola Region had a total population of 738,587 (2019 est.), down from 1,061,820 (1989 census), making it the tenth most populous region in Kazakhstan. The city&#x27;s history has been influenced by people of many nations and religions. Kokshetau retains multiethnic population, with 59% ethnic Kazakhs (up from 36%), the rest being mostly 28% ethnic Russians (down from 42%) and other ethnic groups such as Ukrainians, Tatars and Germans. Kokshetau City Administration (area of ), with a population of roughly 165,153 residents, includes one settlement administration (which consists of the work settlement of Stantsyonny) and the Krasnoyarsk rural district, which includes two rural settlements (the villages of Krasny Yar and Kyzyl-Zhuldyz).

The city is considered to have been founded in 1824 as a military fortress, while it was granted city status in 1895. It was the centre of Kokshetau Region, which was abolished in 1997. It is well known for its nature and tourist sites, such as Burabay and Zerendi, among others. The city&#x27;s main football team is FC Okzhetpes. Kokshetau is about from Petropavl, northwest of the national capital Astana along the A1, from Omsk along the A13, and from Kostanay. The city is served by Kokshetau Airport (KOV). The akim (mayor) is Anuar Kumpekeev from the Amanat Party.

Kokshetau is an important economic, educational, and cultural centre of the Akmola Region. Attractions in and around Kokshetau include Akmola Regional Museum of History and Local Lore, Bukpa Hill, Kokshetau City Park, Kokshetau City History Museum, Museum of Literature and Art. The northwest entrance to Burabay National Park () and Burabay spa town is a little over 43 miles (70 km) from Kokshetau. Kokshetau was awarded the title Kazakhstan City of Culture for the year 2021.

== Names and etymology ==

*, a transliteration of the Russian form 
* 

The name Kokshetau (; ) is of Kazakh origin literally meaning a (), &quot;kokshe&quot; / &quot;&quot;, meaning () and &quot;tau&quot; / &quot;&quot;, meaning () — the name of always turning blue, as if in a deep haze of mountains, thus &quot;Blueish Mountain/Smoky-Blue Mountain&quot; in English. That is how from ancient times Kazakhs were calling the highest mountain in Akmola Region &quot;Mount Kokshe&quot; (947 m), located 60 miles away from the city.
Following the collapse of the Soviet Union, Kazakhstan declared its independence on 16 December 1991 (Kazakhstan Independence Day), and on 7 October 1993, by the Resolution of the Presidium of the Supreme Council of the Republic of Kazakhstan, the city of &quot;Kokchetav&quot; () was renamed to the more Kazakh sounding &quot;Kokshetau&quot; as part of the government&#x27;s campaign to apply Kazakh names to cities, but the city&#x27;s airport still retains KOV as its IATA code. In Russian it became known as Kokshetau.

===Chronology of name changes===
Historically, several names in various languages have identified Kokshetau.

* Stanitsa Kokchetavskaya (1827–1868; which is a romanized back-transliteration from Russian name in Cyrillic: ; )
* Kokchetav (1868–1993; in publications dating from the Soviet period, the city name was occasionally spelled in English as &quot;Kokchetav&quot;, which is a back-transliteration from post-revolution Russian name in Cyrillic: , Russian name in Cyrillic script (1868-1918): ; Kazakh name in Yañalif script (1929-1940): , Kazakh name in Cyrillic script (after 1940): )
* Kokshetau (since 1993; which is a romanized back-transliteration from Russian name in Cyrillic: ; Kazakh name in Cyrillic script: , Kazakh name in Latin script (new version before 2021): , Kazakh name in Latin script (latest version of the Kazakh Latin alphabet after 2021): )

==Physical geography and geology==

===Location===
Kokshetau is located in the country of Kazakhstan and lies in the northern portion of Akmola Region. The city is located on the border of the West Siberian Plain, on the southeastern shore of Lake Kopa, at an altitude of 234 meters above sea level, in the Kokshetau Mountains, north part of the Kokshetau Hills, the foothills of which surround the city from the south and west. It covers an area of . It is located about north-west of the national capital of Astana.

The city lay along low hills and by a kidney-shaped lake. There are numerous hills in the vicinity of the city (Bukpa Hill). The city is located in the flat part of the interfluve of the Kylshakty river, flowing in the eastern part of the city, and the Shagalaly river, flowing from the western side of the city. The city has several parks and gardens. Also, within the city limits can be found small forests, mostly consisting of birches and pine plantations. The Kokshetau area is known for its two national parks, Burabay and Kokshetau.

== History ==

===Early history===
Kokshetau past incorporates all the main stages and turning points of the history of Kazakhstan. For many centuries, nomadic Kazakh tribes lived on the territory of the former Kokshetau Region. The territory of Kokshetau was part of the Middle Horde, the clans of the tribal union of the Argyns that occupied vast regions of Northern and Central Kazakhstan. In the 18th – 19th centuries, the headquarters of famous khans, such as Abylai Khan, Kasym Khan, Kenesary Khan, were located on the land of Kokshetau Region.

===Foundation of Kokshetau (1824–1917)===
As Russia&#x27;s hand stretched southwards, Kokshetau was initially founded on 29 April 1824 as an administrative outpost at the foot of the southern side of Mount Kokshe on the shores of Lake Ulken Shabakty. The Middle Horde signed treaties of protection with Russia. The local population strongly opposed the fact that the new settlement was placed in the chosen place. In the summer of 1827, the district order was transferred to the new place where the city of Kokshetau is now located. The settlement began to be called Kokchetav. The construction of the settlement began at the foot of Bukpa Hill, on the southern shores of Lake Kopa, and a picket was set up to protect the district order.

By the middle of 19th-century, the population of the settlement was significantly increasing due to the migration of the peasants from Russia (Povolzhye) and Ukraine who were driven to migrate by starvation and poverty to farm the steppe. In 1868, when the Akmolinsk Oblast was formed, Kokshetau became a district city in this region, which further developed as a center of agricultural and animal husbandry and as a resort town. In 1876, the city lost its military significance. The line and fortress were abolished. In 1895, Kokshetau was granted city status. By that time the population in the town was above 5 thousand people.

=== Soviet era (1918–1991) ===
In 1928, Kokshetau District was divided into several boroughs and until 1944 Kokshetau&#x27;s territory was part of Karaganda Region and later part of North Kazakhstan Region. On 16 March 1944, according to the Decree of the Presidium of Supreme Soviet of Kazakh SSR, Kokshetau became the administrative center of the newly created Kokchetav Oblast. Relatively rapid growth and development of Kokshetau took place during the years of development of virgin lands, especially in the second half of the 1950s.

=== Fall of the Soviet Union and modern history (1991–present) ===
On 3 May 1997, Kokshetau Oblast was abolished, the city was deprived of the status of a regional center. On 8 April 1999, after Akmola and North Kazakhstan regions were reorganized, Kokshetau became the center of Akmola Region.

===Landmarks===
The city is full of numerous buildings and monuments that reflect its rich and diverse history. The architecture of Kokshetau has been shaped through its history by the progression of historical eras. Many buildings of Kokshetau are ranged from a different number of architectural styles.

==== Historical architecture ====
The architecture of the city dates back to 19th century, the city had numerous wooden buildings with elaborate decor. Kokshetau is the home of a unique architectural tradition and community with number of historical buildings in city. There are a number of two-story wooden houses in the city built mostly in the middle of the 20th century as temporary habitations. Among other notable buildings are the mansions of the merchant Andrei Vasilievich Sokolov (late of the 19th century - beginning of the 20th century), the Akmola Regional Museum of History and Local Lore (beginning of the 20th century).

==== Soviet-era architecture ====
Industrialization in Kokshetau started in the late 1920s. The city&#x27;s 3,000-worker Soviet construction trust built some of the large, gray, faceless apartment buildings that were so typical of Soviet society and still stand, often in disrepair, today. The apartments housed the trust&#x27;s own construction workers, among others, in units of one to three rooms. The city&#x27;s apartment houses are called “Khrushchyovka” and “Stalinka” due to the peculiarities of architectural approaches in their construction.

==== Contemporary architecture ====
When the Iron Curtain was falling, but the Soviet Union still was intact, five citizens from the city paid a visit to Waukesha. Among them was then mayor of the city, Askar Khassen, who took the idea of building more single homes in Kokshetau, as comfortable as the homes in the US. On the hilly outskirts of Kokshetau, someone may find the fingerprint of Waukesha County. There are big, expensive, single-family homes. They&#x27;re inching up the hills. In Kokshetau, the locals have a name for this high-priced neighborhood of single-family homes, &quot;Small America&quot; or &quot;Khassen&#x27;s Cottages&quot;. Prominently located at the opening of this housing development are tall brick pillars, a sign outlining location of lots, and a decorative brick wall, all reminiscent of the gated entries seen in some Waukesha County subdivisions.

When the Soviet Union crumbled and Kazakhstan became an independent country in 1991, the city&#x27;s construction trust-turned-business began to put a face on their buildings.

<doc id="460683" wikidata="Q829244" url="?curid=460683" title="Borough of Berwick-upon-Tweed">
<text>Berwick-upon-Tweed was a local government district and borough in Northumberland in the north-east of England, on the border with Scotland. The district had a resident population of 25,949 according to the 2001 census, which also notes that it is the most ethnically homogeneous in the country, with 99.6% of the population recording themselves in the 2001 census as &quot;White&quot;. It was also the least populated district in England with borough status, and the third-least densely populated local government district (after Eden and Tynedale).

Its main town is Berwick-upon-Tweed, sited immediately to the north of the Tweed estuary. The town is ancient, the scene of a number of battles; it has perhaps the best remaining example of a (almost completely intact) town wall, built for defensive purposes.

On the south of the estuary, the port of Tweedmouth is the point of export of diverse goods, but especially grain and roadstone. The remainder of the borough is rural, bordered to the west by the Cheviot Hills, and to the east by a scenic coastline.

The borough was formed on 1 April 1974 by the merger of the previous borough of Berwick-upon-Tweed with Belford Rural District, Glendale Rural District and Norham and Islandshires Rural District.

Berwick was the first district in Britain to hold a referendum on whether to have a directly elected mayor. This referendum, on 7 June 2001, decided against an elected mayor.

The district was abolished as part of the 2009 structural changes to local government in England effective from 1 April 2009 with responsibilities being transferred to Northumberland County Council, a unitary authority.

==Settlements and parishes==

<text>Evolutionary programming is an evolutionary algorithm, where a share of new population is created by mutation of previous population without crossover. Evolutionary programming differs from evolution strategy ES(formula_1) in one detail. All individuals are selected for the new population, while in ES(formula_1), every individual has the same probability to be selected. It is one of the four major evolutionary algorithm paradigms.

==History==
It was first used by Lawrence J. Fogel in the US in 1960 in order to use simulated evolution as a learning process aiming to generate artificial intelligence. It was used to evolve finite-state machines as predictors.

<doc id="460690" wikidata="Q92660" url="?curid=460690" title="James Clark (programmer)">
<text>James Clark (born &lt;time datetime=&quot;1964-02-23&quot;&gt;23 February 1964&lt;/time&gt;) is a software engineer and creator of various open-source software including groff, expat and several XML specifications.

==Education and early life==
Clark was born in London and educated at Charterhouse School and Merton College, Oxford where he studied Mathematics and Philosophy.

==Career==
Clark has lived in Bangkok, Thailand since &lt;time&gt;1995&lt;/time&gt;, and is permanent Thai resident. He owns a company called Thai Open Source Software Center, which provides him a legal framework for his open-source activities. Clark is the author and creator of groff, as well as an XML editing mode for GNU Emacs.

===Work on XML ===
Clark served as technical lead of the working group that developed XML—notably contributing the self-closing, empty element tag syntax, and the name XML. His contributions to XML are cited in dozens of books on the subject. Clark is the author or co-author of a number of influential specifications and implementations, including:

* DSSSL: An SGML transformation and styling language.
* Expat: An open-source XML parser.
* XSLT: XSL Transformations, a part of the XSL family. He was the editor of the XSLT 1.0 specification.
* XPath: Path language for addressing XML documents; used by XSLT but also as a free-standing language. He was the editor of the XPath 1.0 specification. 
* TREX: Tree regular experessions for XML (TREX) is a schema language for XML. TREX has been merged with RELAX to create RELAX NG.
* RELAX NG: an XML Schema language, with both an explicit XML syntax and a compact syntax. Clark was critical of the XML Schema (W3C) language (also known as XSD) and developed RELAX NG in response
* Jing: An implementation of RELAX NG.
* Clark Notation: A way to express an XML Name in a compact way
* Ballerina: Ballerina is an open source general-purpose programming language for application programmers.
Clark is listed as a member of the working group that developed the Java Stream processing API for XML (StAX) JSR 173 at the JCP.

=== Software Industry Promotion Agency (SIPA)===
From &lt;time datetime=&quot;2004-11&quot;&gt;November 2004&lt;/time&gt; until late &lt;time&gt;2006&lt;/time&gt;, Clark worked for Thailand&#x27;s Software Industry Promotion Agency (SIPA), to promote open source technologies and open standards in the country. This work included pushing the Thai localization of OpenOffice.org office suite and the Mozilla Firefox web browser, along with other open source software packages.

Other projects at SIPA include:

* Chantra: An open source Thai project with programs for Windows, like the OpenCD project.
* Suriyan GNU/Linux: A user-friendly &quot;instant server&quot; system for small and medium-sized companies not to be confused with SIPA&#x27;s new, unrelated project with a similar name, Suriyan Linux Live CD.

<doc id="460691" wikidata="Q1439979" url="?curid=460691" title="Alnwick District">
<text>Alnwick was a local government district of Northumberland, England. Its council was based in the town of Alnwick and the district had a population of 31,029 according to the 2001 census.

It was one of the most rural and sparsely populated districts in the United Kingdom, having a resident population of 32,300 in an area of 1,079.51 square kilometres, according to the 2001 census. (That is 29 persons per km² compared with the UK average of 245 persons per km².) Just over 50% of the population was located in the three main towns of Alnwick (7,600), Amble (6,100) and Rothbury (2,500), with the remainder dispersed across large and small villages, hamlets and isolated dwellings.

It was the second most racially homogeneous community in the country, in the terms measured in the 2001 census with 99.6% of the population recording their ethnicity as &quot;White&quot;.

The district was formed on 1 April 1974 as a merger of the urban districts of Alnwick and Amble and the rural districts of Alnwick and Rothbury. The district was abolished as part of structural changes to local government in England effective from 1 April 2009. Its responsibilities were transferred to Northumberland County Council, which became a unitary authority.

==Politics==

Elections to the district council were held every 4 years from 1973 to the last election in 2007. Independents, Conservatives and Liberal Democrats held majorities on the council at different times, but from 1995 onwards no party had a majority. As of the last election in 2007 the council was composed of the following councillors:-

== Main towns ==
=== Alnwick ===
Alnwick was the largest of the three main towns in the district. It is a reasonably busy rural market town. According to &quot;Country Life&quot;, October 2002, &quot;Alnwick is the most picturesque market town in Northumberland, and the best place to live in Britain&quot;. The town dates back approximately to the 7th century, and is the ancestral seat of the Duke of Northumberland, who still resides at Alnwick Castle. Historically, Alnwick was a fortified town, an agricultural centre and a staging post on the Great North Road between Edinburgh and London. The fabric of the town, in parts, reflects its history, although there has been much contemporary development.

=== Amble ===
The historic port of Amble is located on the River Coquet estuary and is the southern gateway to Northumberland&#x27;s Heritage Coast.

=== Rothbury ===
Rothbury is a picturesque historic market town with its origins dating back to the 11th century. It is situated on the River Coquet, and provides a gateway to Upper Coquetdale and the Northumberland National Park.

<doc id="460695" wikidata="Q7707552" url="?curid=460695" title="Texas Centennial Exposition">
<text>The Texas Centennial Exposition was a world&#x27;s fair presented from June 6 to November 29, 1936, at Fair Park, Dallas, Texas. A celebration of the 100th anniversary of Texas&#x27;s independence from Mexico in 1836, it also celebrated Texas and Western American culture. More than 50 buildings were constructed for the exposition, and many remain today as notable examples of Art Deco architecture. Attracting more than six million people including US President Franklin Roosevelt, the exposition was credited with buffering Dallas from the Great Depression.

==Background==
The Texas Centennial Exposition was held at Fair Park in Dallas, to celebrate the 100th anniversary of Texas&#x27;s independence from Mexico in 1836. It was also a celebration of Texas and Western culture. Three Texas cities (Dallas, Houston, and San Antonio) competed to host the exposition, with Dallas receiving the nod from the Texas Centennial Commission because it offered the largest cash commitment ($7,791,000), the existing facilities of the State Fair of Texas, and a strong group of leaders.

George Dahl was director general of a group of architects who designed the more than 50 buildings constructed for the exposition at Fair Park, a landscaped expanse then comprising 178 acres. Some 30 of the structures remain, representing one of the largest intact groupings of world&#x27;s fair buildings and open spaces remaining in the United States. Chief among these buildings is the Texas Hall of State, which was not completed until after the opening of the exposition.

==Event==
The Texas Centennial Exposition was held at Fair Park in Dallas, June 6 – November 29, 1936. The event attracted 6,353,827 visitors, and cost around $25 million. The exposition was credited for buffering Dallas from the Great Depression, creating over 10,000 jobs and giving a $50 million boost to the local economy.

The Cavalcade of Texas, a historical pageant covering four centuries of Texas history, was one of the most popular attractions at the Exposition. The Hall of Negro Life was another popular attraction and is believed to be the first recognition of African-American culture at a world&#x27;s fair. The Hall was decorated with four murals by the celebrated painter Aaron Douglas. The Texas Centennial Olympics, held in the Cotton Bowl, hosted the first integrated public athletic competition in the history of the South. Universal produced a newsreel of preparations for the Centennial beauty pageant, which shows models attempting to fit into life-sized cutouts of the Texas Centennial Committee&#x27;s concept of the &quot;perfect figure&quot;.

The celebrated Federal Theatre Project production of &quot;Macbeth&quot;, adapted and directed by Orson Welles with an all-black cast, was featured August 13–23 in the new band shell and 5,000-seat open-air amphitheatre. The production was one of the most talked-about features of the exposition and drew large, enthusiastic audiences. For many it was their first opportunity to see a professional dramatic performance by African American actors. Integrated seating was a unique experience for theatergoers in Dallas.

President Franklin D. Roosevelt visited the exposition in a widely publicized event on June 12.

Gene Autry&#x27;s film &quot;The Big Show&quot; was filmed on location and shows many of the buildings and events of the event.

The Centennial Exposition required a massive publicity effort, but the promotion department was stymied by a lack of photographs. Never before had the state been photographed for advertising purposes. The Centennial Exposition hired Polly Smith to travel the state and tell the story of Texas through photos.

After a successful five-month run, the Texas Centennial Exposition was closed. The exhibits changed and reopened the following year as the Greater Texas &amp; Pan-American Exposition.

== Legacy ==
The Fair Park Texas Centennial Buildings were designated a National Historic Landmark in 1986.

In October 2010, the National Building Museum in Washington, D.C., opened an exhibition titled &quot;Designing Tomorrow: America&#x27;s World&#x27;s Fairs of the 1930s&quot;. This exhibition, which was available for view until September 2011, prominently featured the Texas Centennial Exposition.

<doc id="460697" wikidata="Q579132" url="?curid=460697" title="Sandžak">
<text>Sandžak (Serbian Cyrillic: ; ) is a historical and geo-political region in the Balkans, located in the southwestern part of Serbia and the eastern part of Montenegro. The Bosnian/Serbian term &quot;Sandžak&quot; derives from the Sanjak of Novi Pazar, a former Ottoman administrative district founded in 1865. Sandžak is inhabited by a majority of ethnic Bosniaks.

Various empires and kingdoms have ruled over the region. In the 12th century, Sandžak was part of the region of Raška under the medieval Serbian Kingdom. During the Ottoman territorial expansion into the western Balkans in a series of wars, the region became an important administrative district, with Novi Pazar as its administrative center. Sandžak was under Austro-Hungarian occupation between 1878 and 1909 as a garrison, until an agreement between Austria-Hungary and the Ottoman Empire resulted in the withdrawal of Austro-Hungarian troops from Sandžak in exchange for full control over Bosnia. In 1912, it was divided between the Kingdom of Montenegro and the Kingdom of Serbia.

Novi Pazar serves as Sandžak&#x27;s economic and cultural center and is the region&#x27;s most populous city. Sandžak has a diverse and complex ethnic and religious composition, with significant Eastern Orthodox, Roman Catholic, and Sunni Muslim populations. Bosniaks comprise ethnic majority in this region.

==Etymology==
The Serbo-Croatian term &quot;Sandžak&quot; (Serbian Cyrillic: ) is the transcription of Ottoman Turkish &quot;sancak&quot; (sanjak, &quot;province&quot;); the Sanjak of Novi Pazar, known in Serbo-Croatian as &quot;Novopazarski sandžak&quot;. Historically, it is known as &quot;Raška&quot; by the Serbs. The region is known as &quot;Sanxhak&quot; in Albanian. 

==Geography==
Sandžak stretches from the southeastern border of Bosnia and Herzegovina to the borders with Kosovo and Albania at an area of around 8,500 square kilometers. Six municipalities of Sandžak are in Serbia (Novi Pazar, Sjenica, Tutin, Prijepolje, Nova Varoš, and Priboj), and seven in Montenegro (Pljevlja, Bijelo Polje, Berane, Petnjica, Rožaje, Gusinje, and Plav). Sometimes the Montenegrin municipality of Andrijevica is also regarded as part of Sandžak.

The most populated municipality in the region is Novi Pazar (100,410), while other large municipalities are: Pljevlja (31,060), and Priboj (27,133). In Serbia, the municipalities of Novi Pazar and Tutin are part of the Raška District, while the municipalities of Sjenica, Prijepolje, Nova Varoš, and Priboj, are part of the Zlatibor District.

==History==

===Ottoman rule===
The Serbian Despotate was invaded by the Ottoman Empire in 1455. Apart from the effect of a lengthy period under Ottoman domination, many of the subject populations were periodically and forcefully converted to Islam as a result of a deliberate move by the Ottoman Turks as part of a policy of ensuring the loyalty of the population against a potential Venetian invasion. However, Islam was spread by force in the areas under the control of the Ottoman sultan through the &quot;devşirme&quot; system of child levy enslavement, by which indigenous European Christian boys from the Balkans (predominantly Albanians, Bulgarians, Croats, Greeks, Romanians, Serbs, and Ukrainians) were taken, levied, subjected to forced circumcision and forced conversion to Islam, and incorporated into the Ottoman army, and &quot;jizya&quot; taxes.

The Islamization of Sandžak was otherwise caused by a number of factors, mainly economic, as Muslims didn&#x27;t pay the &quot;devşirme&quot; tributes and &quot;jizya&quot; taxes. The Muslims were also privileged compared to Christians, who were unable to work in the administration or testify in court against Muslims, as they were treated as &quot;dhimmi&quot;. The second factor that contributed to the Islamization were migrations; a large demographic shift occurred after the Great Turkish War (1683–1699). Part of the Slavic-speaking Orthodox Christian population was expelled northwards, while other Christians and Muslims were driven to the Ottoman territory. The land abandoned by the Eastern Orthodox Serbs was settled by populations from neighbouring areas who either were or became Muslim in Sandžak. Large migrations occurred throughout the 18th and 19th centuries. The third factor of Islamization was the geographical location of Sandžak, which allowed it to become a trade centre, facilitating conversions amongst merchants. The tribal migrations to Sandžak had contributed a large role to its history and identity along with culture.
The second half of the 19th century was very important in terms of shaping the current ethnic and political situation in Sandžak. Austria-Hungary supported Sandžak&#x27;s separation from the Ottoman Empire, or at least its autonomy within it. The reason was to prevent the kingdoms of Montenegro and Serbia from unifying, and allow Austria-Hungary&#x27;s further expansion into the Balkans. Per these plans, Sandžak was seen as part of the Condominium of Bosnia and Herzegovina, while its Muslim population played a significant role, giving Austrian-Hungarians a pretext of protecting the Muslim minority from the Eastern Orthodox Serbs.

Sandzak was an administrative part of the Sanjak of Bosnia until 1790, when it become a separated Sanjak of Novi Pazar. However, in 1867, it become a part of the Bosnia Vilayet that consisted of seven sanjaks, including the Sanjak of Novi Pazar. This led to Sandžak Muslims identifying themselves with other Slavic Muslims in Bosnia.
Albanian speakers gradually migrated or were relocated to the Ottoman provinces of Kosovo and North Macedonia, leaving a primarily Slavic-speaking population in the rest of the region (except in a southeastern corner of Sandžak that ended up as a part of Kosovo).

Some members of the Albanian Shkreli and Kelmendi tribes began migrating into the lower Pešter and Sandžak regions at around 1700. The Kelmendi chief had converted to Islam, and promised to convert his people to. A total of 251 Kelmendi households (1,987 people) were resettled in the Pešter area on that occasion, however five years later part the exiled Kelmendi managed to fight their way back to their homeland, and in 1711 they sent out a large raiding force to bring back some other from Pešter too. The remaining Kelmendi and Shkreli converted to Islam and became Slavophones by the 20th century, and as of today they now self-identify as part of the Bosniak ethnicity, although in the Pešter plateau they partly utilized the Albanian language until the middle of the 20th century, particuarily in the villages of Ugao, Boroštica, Doliće, and Gradac. Since the 18th century, many people originating from the Hoti tribe have migrated to and live in Sandžak, mainly in the Tutin area, but also in Sjenica.

In October 1912, during the First Balkan War, Serbian and Montenegrin troops seized Sandžak, which was then divided between the two countries. This led to the displacement of many Slavic Muslims and Albanians, who migrated to Ottoman Turkey as &quot;muhajir&quot;.

After the war, Sandžak became a part of the newly formed State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs. The region acted as a bridge between the Muslims in the West in Bosnia and Herzegovina and those in the East in Kosovo and North Macedonia. However, the Slavic Muslims of Sandžak suffered economic decline due to the defeat and collapse of the Ottoman Empire, which had been their primary source of economic stability. Additionally, the agrarian reform implemented in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia worsened their economic situation, leading to the emigration of Muslims from Sandžak to the Ottoman Empire.

===World War I===
During World War I, Sandžak was occupied by Austria-Hungary. In 1919, an Albanian revolt, which later came to be known as the &quot;Plav rebellion&quot; rose up in the Rožaje, Gusinje, and Plav districts, fighting against the inclusion of Sandžak in the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. As a result, during the Serbian army&#x27;s second occupation of Rožaje, which took place in 1918-1919, seven hundred Albanian citizens were slaughtered in Rožaje. In 1919, Serb forces attacked Albanian populations in Plav and Gusinje, which had appealed to the British government for protection. About 450 local civilians were killed after the uprising was quelled. These events resulted in a large influx of Albanians migrating to the Principality of Albania.

=== World War II ===
In World War II, Sandžak was the battleground of several factions. In 1941, the region was partitioned between the Italian governorate of Montenegro, the Italian protectorate over the Kingdom of Albania, and the Territory of the Military Commander in Serbia. The Muslim population was in general anti-partisan. They were organized in small formations known in historiography as the Sandžak Muslim militia. These formations depending on their location and regional politics were affiliated to Albanian nationalist groups linked to Balli Kombëtar in central and south Sandžak or to Muslim Ustaše groups in the north. Many Orthodox Serbs organized in the Serbian nationalist Chetniks. The stance of these factions towards the Nazi forces ranged from armed resistance to open collaboration. Smaller groups of both Orthodox Serbs and Muslims organized after 1943 in the Yugoslav Partisan Anti-Fascist Council of the People&#x27;s Liberation of Sandžak. Each faction sought the inclusion of Sandžak in the post-war period into separate states. Albanian militia fought for inclusion in Greater Albania, while Ustaše formations wanted at least part of Sandžak to join the Bosnian Muslims of the Independent State of Croatia. Amonge these factions, the Yugoslavs, Slavic Muslims, Serbs, and Montenegrins adopted different strategies. Muslims wanted either unification with Bosnia under a federal Yugoslavia or the establishment of an autonomous Sandžak region. Serbs and Montenegrins wanted the area to either pass entirely to Serbia or Montenegro.

The formal partition of Sandžak between Italian and German spheres of influence was largely ignored as local politics shaped control over the area. Prijepolje which formally was within the Italian area of rule in Montenegro was in fact under the NDH-affiliated Sulejman Pačariz, while Novi Pazar in the German sphere was led by the Albanian nationalist Aqif Bluta. Clashes between Albanians and Serbs in south Sandžak began in April 1941. In other cities of Sandžak similar battles between different factions played out. Otto von Erdmannsdorf, the special envoy of Germany to Sandžak mentioned in his correspondence that up to 100,000 Albanians from Sandžak wanted to be moved from Serbia under the jurisdiction of Albania. The Italian and German forces considered to enact population exchange from Sandžak to Kosovo to stop interethnic violence between Serbs and Albanians. Peter Pfeiffer, diplomat of the Foreign Office of Germany warned that relocation plans would cause a great rift between the German army and Albanians and they were abandoned. In November 1941 as clashes continued Albanians defeated the Chetniks in the battle of Novi Pazar. The battle was followed by reprisals against the Serbs of Novi Pazar. In 1943, Chetnik forces based in Montenegro conducted a series of ethnic cleansing operations against Muslims in the Bihor region of modern-day Serbia. In May 1943, an estimated 5400 Albanian men, women and children in Bihor were massacred by Chetnik forces under Pavle Đurišić. In a reaction, the notables of the region then published a memorandum and declared themselves to be Albanians. The memorandum was sent to Prime Minister Ekrem Libohova whom they asked to intervene so the region could be united to the Albanian kingdom. It has been estimated that 9,000 Muslims were killed in total by the Chetniks and affiliated groups during the war in Sandžak. The Jewish community of Novi Pazar was initially not harassed because the city didn&#x27;t have any considerable concentration of German forces, but on March 2, 1942 the city&#x27;s Jews were rounded up by the German army and killed in extermination camps (the men in Bubanj and the women and children in Sajmište).

1943 year saw the creation of the SS-Police &quot;Self-Defence&quot; Regiment Sandžak, being formed by joining three battalions of Albanian collaborationist troops with one battalion of the Sandžak Muslim militia. At one point around 2,000 members of the SS regiment operated in Sjenica. Its leader was Sulejman Pačariz, an Islamic cleric of Albanian origin.
The Anti-Fascist Council of People&#x27;s Liberation of Sandžak (AVNOS) had been founded on 20 November 1943 in Pljevlja. In January 1944, the Land Assembly of Montenegro and the Bay of Kotor claimed Sandžak as part of a future Montenegrin federal unit. However, in March, the Communist Party opposed this, insisting that Sandžak&#x27;s representatives at AVNOJ should decide on the matter. In February 1945, the Presidency of the AVNOJ made a decision to oppose the Sandžak&#x27;s autonomy. The AVNOJ explained that the Sandžak did not have a national basis for an autonomy and opposed crumbling of the Serbian and Montenegrin totality. On 29 March 1945 in Novi Pazar, the AVNOS accepted the decision of the AVNOJ and divided itself between Serbia and Montenegro. Sandžak was divided based on the 1912 demarcation line.

===SFR Yugoslavia===
Economically, Sandžak remained undeveloped. It had a small amount of crude and low-revenue industry. Freight was transported by trucks over poor roads. Schools for business students, which remained poor in general education, were opened for working-class youth. The Sandžak had no faculty, not even a department or any school of higher education.

Sandžak saw a process of industrialisation, during which factories were opened in several cities, including Novi Pazar, Prijepolje, Priboj, Ivangrad, while the coal mines were opened in the Prijepolje area. The urbanisation caused a major social and economic shift. Many people left villages for towns. The national composition of the urban centres was changed to the disadvantage of the Muslims, as most of those who inhabited the cities were Serbs. The Muslims continued to lose their economic status, continuing the trend inherited from the time of the collapse of the Ottoman Empire and the agrarian reform in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. The emigration of the Muslims to Turkey also continued, caused by the general underdevelopment of the region, disagreement with the communist authorities and the mistrust with the Serbs and Montenegrins, but also due to the nationalisation and expropriation of property. Serbs from Sandžak also moved to the wealthier regions of the central Serbia or to Belgrade or Vojvodina, while the Muslims moved to Bosnia and Herzegovina as well.

====Autonomy referendum of 1991====
Between 25 and 27 October 1991, a referendum on Sandžak&#x27;s autonomy was held, organized by the Muslim National Council of Sandžak (MNVS) which consisted of the Muslim Party of Democratic Action (SDA) and other Bosnian Muslim organizations and parties. It was declared illegal by Serbia. According to the SDA, 70.2% of the population participated in the referendum with 98.92% voting in favor of autonomy.

===Contemporary period===
With the democratic changes in Serbia in 2000, the ethnic Bosniaks were enabled to start participating in the political life in Serbia and Montenegro, including Rasim Ljajić, an ethnic Bosniak, who was a minister in the verious governments of Serbia, and Rifat Rastoder, who was the Deputy President of the Parliament of Montenegro. Census data shows a general emigration of all ethnicities from this underdeveloped region.

== Demographics ==

The population of the sanjak of Novi Pazar was ethnically and religiously diverse. In 1878-81, Muslim Slav muhacirs (refugees) from areas which became part of Montenegro, settled in the sanjak. As Ottoman institutions only registered religious affiliation, official Ottoman statistics about ethnicity do not exist. Austrian, Bulgarian and Serbian consulates in the area produced their own ethnographic estimations about the sanjak. In general, three main groups lived in the region: Orthodox Serbs, Muslim and Catholic Albanians and Muslim Slavs (noted in contemporary sources as Bosniaks). Small communities of Romani, Turks and Jews lived mainly in towns. The Bulgarian foreign ministry compiled a report in 1901-02. The five kazas (districts) of the sanjak of the Novi Pazar at that time were: Akova, Sjenica, Kolašin, Novi Pazar and Nova Varoš. According to the Bulgarian report, in the kaza of Akova there were 47 Albanian villages which had 1,266 households. Serbs lived in 11 villages which had 216 households. The town of Akova (Bijelo Polje) had 100 Albanian and Serb households. There were also mixed villages - inhabited by both Serbs and Albanians - which had 115 households with 575 inhabitants. The kaza of Sjenica was inhabited mainly by Orthodox Serbs (69 villages with 624 households) and Bosnian Muslims (46 villages with 655 households). Seventeen villages had a population of both Orthodox Serbs and Bosnian Muslims. Albanians (505 households) lived exclusively in the town of Sjenica. The kaza of Novi Pazar had 1,749 households in 244 Serb villages and 896 households in 81 Albanian villages. Nine villages inhabited by both Serbs and Albanians had 173 households. The town of Novi Pazar had a total of 1,749 Serb and Albanian households with 8,745 inhabitants. The kaza of Kolašin had 27 Albanian villages with 732 households and 5 Serb villages with 75 households. The administrative centre of the kaza, Šahovići, had 25 Albanian households. The kaza of Novi Varoš, according the Bulgarian report, had 19 Serbian villages with 298 households and &quot;one Bosnian village with 200 houses&quot;. Novi Varoš had 725 Serb and some Albanian households.

The last official registration of the population of the sanjak of Novi Pazar before the Balkan Wars was conducted in 1910. The 1910 Ottoman census recorded 52,833 Muslims and 27,814 Orthodox Serbs. About 65% of the population were Muslims and 35% Serbian Orthodox. The majority of the Muslim population were Albanians.

The last Yugoslav pre-war census of 1931 counted in Bijelo Polje, Prijepolje, Nova Varoš, Pljevlja, Priboj, Sjenica and Štavica a total population of 204,068. They were mostly counted as Orthodox Serbs or Montenegrins (56.48%) and Bosnian Muslims (43.09%).

Most Bosniaks declared themselves ethnic Muslims in 1991 census. By the 2002-2003 census, however, most of them declared themselves Bosniaks. There is still a significant minority that identify as Muslims (by ethnicity). There are still some Albanian villages (Boroštica, Doliće and Ugao) in the Pešter region. There were a larger presence of Albanians in Sandžak in the past, however due to various factors such as migration, assimilation, along with mixing, many identify as Bosniaks instead. Catholic Albanian groups which settled in Tutin and Pešter in the early 18th century were converted to Islam in that period. Their descendants make up the large majority of the population of Tutin and the Pešter plateau.

The Slavic dialect of Gusinje and Plav (sometimes considered part of Sandžak) shows very high structural influence from Albanian. Its uniqueness in terms of language contact between Albanian and Slavic is explained by the fact that most Slavic-speakers in today&#x27;s Plav and Gusinje are of Albanian origin.

=== Ethnic structure ===

The total population of the municipalities of Sandžak in Serbia and Montenegro is around 385,666. A plurality of people in Sandžak identify as Bosniaks. They form 52.05% (197,754) of the region&#x27;s population. Serbs form 30.03% (114,121), Montenegrins 6.97% (26,494), ethnic Muslims 4.71% (17,879), and Albanians 1.06% (4,035). About 19,687 (5.18%) people belong to smaller communities or have chosen to not declare an ethnic identity.

=== Religious structure ===

Religion in Sandžak is also as diverse as the ethnic composition, most of the Bosniaks being Muslim while a majority of the Serbs being Orthodox Christian. However, because of the prolonged Ottoman rule, Sandžak is more Muslim orientated.

<doc id="460698" wikidata="Q1972611" url="?curid=460698" title="Renoise">
<text>Renoise is a digital audio workstation (DAW) based upon the heritage and development of tracker software. Its primary use is the composition of music using sound samples, soft synths, and effects plug-ins. It is also able to interface with MIDI and OSC equipment. The main difference between Renoise and other music software is the characteristic vertical timeline sequencer used by tracking software.

==History==
Renoise was originally based on the code of another tracker called NoiseTrekker, made by Juan Antonio Arguelles Rius (Arguru). The then-unnamed Renoise project was initiated by Eduard Müller (Taktik) and Zvonko Tesic (Phazze) in December 2000. The development team planned to take tracking software into a new standard of quality, enabling tracking scene composers to make audio of the same quality as other existing professional packages, while still keeping the proven interface that originated with Soundtracker in 1987. Version 1.0 was released in June 2002. Over the years the development team has grown to distribute the tasks of testing, administrative, support and web duties among several people.

==Features==
Renoise currently runs under recent versions of Windows (DirectSound or ASIO), Mac OS X (Core Audio) and Linux (ALSA or JACK).
Renoise has full MIDI and MIDI sync support, VST 3 plugin support, ASIO multi I/O cards support, integrated sampler and sample editor, internal real-time DSP effects with unlimited number of effects per track, master and send tracks, full automation of all commands, Hi-Fi wav/aiff rendering (up to 32-bit, 192 kHz), Rewire support, etc.

Supported sample formats

WAV, AIFF, FLAC, Ogg, MP3, CAF

Supported effects standards

VSTi, AU, LADSPA, DSSI

Renoise also features a Signal Follower and cross-track routing. The Signal Follower analyzes the audio output of a track and automates user-specified parameters based on the values it generates. Cross-track routing sends the automation of any Meta Device to any track. Computer Music magazine considered the combination of these two features to &quot;open up some incredibly powerful control possibilities&quot;, and demonstrated how the signal triggered by a drum loop could control the filter cutoff frequency on a bass sound.

Renoise includes an arranging tool called the &quot;pattern matrix&quot;, full cross-track modulation routing, built-in effects including a signal-follower metadevice that allows sidechain functionality, automatic softsynth-to-sample instrument rendering, and improved MIDI mapping.

==Versions==
Renoise is available as either a demo or a commercial version. The demo version excludes rendering to .WAV, ASIO support in Windows (DirectSound only) and a few other features. Also, the demo version has nag screens. The commercial version includes high quality WAV rendering (up to 32 bit 192 kHz) and ASIO support.

==Development==
With the introduction of Lua scripting in version 2.6, users can expand Renoise. They are encouraged to share their work on the centralized Renoise Tools web page.

===XRNS file format===
The XRNS file format is native to Renoise. It is based on the XML standard, and so is readable in any text editor. The XML-based file format makes it possible for anyone to develop 3rd party applications and other systems in order to manipulate file content.

===Third-party tools===
A project for creating PHP scripts utilities for needed advanced edit tasks has been set up at SourceForge: XRNS-PHP project.
In August 2007, a functional XRNS2MIDI script was published by Renoise team member Bantai. It enables Renoise users, via an external frontend, to convert native songs into regular MIDI files (.mid) and thus exporting their work for use in conventional piano-roll sequencers such as Cubase or Reason.

Since version 2.6, it is possible to extend Renoise capabilities by writing plugins in the Lua programming language. A specific tools mini site has been created to showcase these. Almost any aspect of the program, except realtime audio data mangling, can be scripted using the native Renoise Lua API.

<doc id="460700" wikidata="Q1497184" url="?curid=460700" title="Fractional ideal">
<text>In mathematics, in particular commutative algebra, the concept of fractional ideal is introduced in the context of integral domains and is particularly fruitful in the study of Dedekind domains. In some sense, fractional ideals of an integral domain are like ideals where denominators are allowed. In contexts where fractional ideals and ordinary ring ideals are both under discussion, the latter are sometimes termed integral ideals for clarity.

==Definition and basic results==

Let formula_1 be an integral domain, and let formula_2 be its field of fractions.

A fractional ideal of formula_1 is an formula_1-submodule formula_5 of formula_6 such that there exists a non-zero formula_7 such that formula_8. The element formula_9 can be thought of as clearing out the denominators in formula_5, hence the name fractional ideal.

The principal fractional ideals are those formula_1-submodules of formula_6 generated by a single nonzero element of formula_6. A fractional ideal formula_5 is contained in formula_1 if and only if it is an (integral) ideal of formula_1.

A fractional ideal formula_5 is called invertible if there is another fractional ideal formula_18 such that
:formula_19
where
:formula_20
is the product of the two fractional ideals.

In this case, the fractional ideal formula_18 is uniquely determined and equal to the generalized ideal quotient 
:formula_22
The set of invertible fractional ideals form an commutative group with respect to the above product, where the identity is the unit ideal formula_23 itself. This group is called the group of fractional ideals of formula_1. The principal fractional ideals form a subgroup. A (nonzero) fractional ideal is invertible if and only if it is projective as an formula_1-module. Geometrically, this means an invertible fractional ideal can be interpreted as rank 1 vector bundle over the affine scheme formula_26.

Every finitely generated &quot;R&quot;-submodule of &quot;K&quot; is a fractional ideal and if formula_1 is noetherian these are all the fractional ideals of formula_1.

==Dedekind domains==

In Dedekind domains, the situation is much simpler. In particular, every non-zero fractional ideal is invertible. In fact, this property characterizes Dedekind domains:
:An integral domain is a Dedekind domain if and only if every non-zero fractional ideal is invertible.

The set of fractional ideals over a Dedekind domain formula_1 is denoted formula_30.

Its quotient group of fractional ideals by the subgroup of principal fractional ideals is an important invariant of a Dedekind domain called the ideal class group.

==Number fields==
For the special case of number fields formula_6 (such as formula_32, where formula_33 = &quot;exp(2π i/n)&quot;) there is an associated ring denoted formula_34 called the ring of integers of formula_6. For example, formula_36 for formula_37 square-free and congruent to formula_38. The key property of these rings formula_34 is they are Dedekind domains. Hence the theory of fractional ideals can be described for the rings of integers of number fields. In fact, class field theory is the study of such groups of class rings.

=== Associated structures ===
For the ring of integerspg 2 formula_34 of a number field, the group of fractional ideals forms a group denoted formula_41 and the subgroup of principal fractional ideals is denoted formula_42. The ideal class group is the group of fractional ideals modulo the principal fractional ideals, so
: formula_43
and its class number formula_44 is the order of the group, formula_45. In some ways, the class number is a measure for how &quot;far&quot; the ring of integers formula_34 is from being a unique factorization domain (UFD). This is because formula_47 if and only if formula_34 is a UFD.

==== Exact sequence for ideal class groups ====
There is an exact sequence
:formula_49
associated to every number field.

=== Structure theorem for fractional ideals ===
One of the important structure theorems for fractional ideals of a number field states that every fractional ideal formula_5 decomposes uniquely up to ordering as
:formula_51
for prime ideals
:formula_52.

in the spectrum of formula_34. For example,
:formula_54 factors as formula_55

Also, because fractional ideals over a number field are all finitely generated we can clear denominators by multiplying by some formula_56 to get an ideal formula_18. Hence
: formula_58
Another useful structure theorem is that integral fractional ideals are generated by up to 2 elements. We call a fractional ideal which is a subset of formula_34 &quot;integral&quot;.

==Examples==
* formula_60 is a fractional ideal over formula_61
*For formula_62 the ideal formula_63 splits in formula_64 as formula_65
* For formula_66 we have the factorization formula_67. This is because if we multiply it out, we get
*:formula_68
:Since formula_69 satisfies formula_70, our factorization makes sense.
* For formula_71 we can multiply the fractional ideals
:: formula_72 and formula_73
: to get the ideal
::formula_74

==Divisorial ideal==
Let formula_75 denote the intersection of all principal fractional ideals containing a nonzero fractional ideal formula_5.

Equivalently,
:formula_77
where as above
:formula_78 
If formula_79 then &quot;I&quot; is called divisorial. In other words, a divisorial ideal is a nonzero intersection of some nonempty set of fractional principal ideals.

If &quot;I&quot; is divisorial and &quot;J&quot; is a nonzero fractional ideal, then (&quot;I&quot; : &quot;J&quot;) is divisorial.

Let &quot;R&quot; be a local Krull domain (e.g., a Noetherian integrally closed local domain). Then &quot;R&quot; is a discrete valuation ring if and only if the maximal ideal of &quot;R&quot; is divisorial.

An integral domain that satisfies the ascending chain conditions on divisorial ideals is called a Mori domain.

<text>The gavotte (also gavot, gavote, or gavotta) is a French dance, taking its name from a folk dance of the Gavot, the people of the Pays de Gap region of Dauphiné in the southeast of France, where the dance originated, according to one source. According to another reference, the word &quot;gavotte&quot; is a generic term for a variety of French folk dances, and most likely originated in Lower Brittany in the west, or possibly Provence in the southeast or the French Basque Country in the southwest of France. It is notated in or time and is usually of moderate tempo, though the folk dances also use meters such as and .

In late 16th-century Renaissance dance, the gavotte is first mentioned as the last of a suite of branles. Popular at the court of Louis XIV, it became one of many optional dances in the classical suite of dances. Many were composed by Lully, Rameau and Gluck, and the 17th-century cibell is a variety. The dance was popular in France throughout the 18th century and spread widely. In early courtly use the gavotte involved kissing, but this was replaced by the presentation of flowers.

The gavotte of the 16th, 17th, and 18th centuries has nothing in common with the 19th-century column-dance called the &quot;gavotte&quot; but may be compared with the rigaudon and the bourrée.

==Etymology==
The term &quot;gavotte&quot; for a lively dance originated in the 1690s from Old Provençal &quot;gavoto&quot; (mountaineer&#x27;s dance) from &quot;gavot&quot;, a local name for an Alpine resident, said to mean literally &quot;boor&quot;, &quot;glutton&quot;, from &quot;gaver&quot; (to stuff, force-feed poultry) from Old Provençal &quot;gava&quot; (crop). The word is cognate to French &quot;gavache&quot; (coward, dastard). The Italianized form is &quot;gavotta&quot;.

==Musical characteristics==
The phrases of the 18th-century French court gavotte begin in the middle of the bar, creating a half-measure (half-bar) upbeat. However the music for the earlier court gavotte, first described by Thoinot Arbeau in 1589, invariably began on the downbeat of a duple measure. Later composers also wrote gavottes that began on the downbeat rather than on the half-measure: an example is Jean-Philippe Rameau&#x27;s &quot;Gavotte Variée&quot; in A minor for keyboard. Various folk gavottes found in mid-20th-century Brittany are danced to music in , , , and time.

In the ballroom the gavotte was often paired with a preceding triple-time minuet: both dances are stately, and the gavotte&#x27;s lifted step contrasted with the shuffling minuet step. It had a steady rhythm, not broken up into faster notes.
In the Baroque suite the gavotte is played after (or sometimes before) the sarabande. Like most dance movements of the Baroque period it is typically in binary form but this may be extended by a second melody in the same metre, often one called the &quot;musette&quot;, having a pedal drone to imitate the French bagpipes, played after the first to create a grand ternary form; A–(A)–B–A. There is a &quot;Gavotte en Rondeau&quot; (&quot;Gavotte in rondo form&quot;) in J.S. Bach&#x27;s Partita No. 3 in E Major for solo violin, BWV 1006.

The gavotte could be played at a variety of tempos: Johann Gottfried Walther wrote that the gavotte is &quot;often quick but occasionally slow&quot;.

==Renaissance==
The gavotte is first described in the late 16th century as a suite or miscellany of double branles danced in a line or circle to music in duple time, &quot;with little springs in the manner of the Haut Barrois&quot; branle and with some of the steps &quot;divided&quot; with figures borrowed from the galliard.

The basic gavotte step, as described by Arbeau, is that of the common or double branle, a line of dancers moving alternately to the left and right with a &quot;double à gauche&quot; and &quot;double à droite&quot;, each requiring a count of four. In the double branle these composite steps consist of; a &quot;pied largi&quot; (firm outward step), a &quot;pied approche&quot; (the other foot drawn near to the first), another &quot;pied largi&quot; and a &quot;pied joint&quot; (the other foot drawn against the first).

In the gavotte&#x27;s &quot;double à gauche&quot; a skip (&quot;petit saut&quot;) is inserted after each of the four components; the second &quot;pied largi&quot; is replaced by a &quot;marque pied croisé&quot; (the following foot crosses over the left with toe contacting the floor); the final &quot;pied approche&quot; is replaced by a &quot;grève croisée&quot; (the right foot crosses over the left, raised).

The &quot;double à droite&quot; begins with a &quot;pieds joints&quot; and &quot;petit saut&quot;, followed by two quick steps, a &quot;marque pied gauche croisé&quot; and &quot;marque pied droit croisé&quot;, during beat two, a &quot;grève droit croisée&quot; and &quot;petit saut&quot; on beat three and on the last beat &quot;pieds joints&quot; and a &quot;capriole&quot; (leap into the air with entrechat).

==Baroque ==

The gavotte became popular in the court of Louis XIV where Jean-Baptiste Lully was the leading court composer. Gaétan Vestris did much to define the dance. Subsequently many composers of the Baroque period incorporated the dance as one of many optional additions to the standard instrumental suite of the era. The examples in suites and partitas by Johann Sebastian Bach are well known.

Movements of early 18th-century musical works entitled &quot;Tempo di gavotta&quot; sometimes indicated the sense of a gavotte rhythm or movement, without fitting the number of measures or strains typical of the actual dance. Examples of these can be found in the works of Arcangelo Corelli or Johann Sebastian Bach.

George Frideric Handel wrote a number of gavottes, including the fifth-and-final movement, Allegro, of the Concerto Grosso in B-flat major, Op. 3, No. 2, HWV 313.

==Later examples==
Composers in the 19th century wrote gavottes that began, like the 16th-century gavotte, on the downbeat rather than on the half-measure upbeat. The famous Gavotte in D by Gossec is such an example, as is the Gavotte in Massenet&#x27;s &quot;Manon&quot; but not the one in Ambroise Thomas&#x27;s &quot;Mignon&quot;. A gavotte also occurs in the second act of &quot;The Gondoliers&quot; and the Act I finale of &quot;Ruddigore&quot;, both by Gilbert and Sullivan.

Edvard Grieg&#x27;s suite &quot;From Holberg&#x27;s Time&quot;, based on eighteenth-century dance forms, features a &quot;Gavotte&quot; as its third movement (1884).
Australian composer Fred Werner used a gavotte he composed for teaching students.

Igor Stravinsky&#x27;s ballet &quot;Pulcinella&quot; features a &quot;Gavotta con due variazioni&quot;, as number 18, and movement VI in the suite (1922).

Sergei Prokofiev employs a gavotte instead of a minuet in his Symphony No. 1 (&quot;Classical&quot;), Op. 25 (1917), and includes another one as the second of his Ten Piano Pieces Op. 12 (1913), and another as the third of his Four Piano Pieces, Op. 32 (1918).

Leonard Bernstein&#x27;s &quot;Candide&quot; has a &quot;Venice Gavotte&quot; in act 2.

&quot;The Ascot Gavotte&quot; is a song in the 1956 musical &quot;My Fair Lady&quot; by Alan Jay Lerner and Frederick Loewe.

* Carly Simon&#x27;s song &quot;You&#x27;re So Vain&quot; includes the lyric &quot;You had one eye in the mirror as you watched yourself gavotte&quot;. In this context it means &quot;moving in a pretentious manner&quot;.
* The Stephen Sondheim musical &quot;Sunday in the Park with George&quot; uses the word &quot;gavotte&quot; as a satirical device in the otherwise irregular, non-steadily rhythmical, song &quot;It&#x27;s Hot Up Here&quot; to start the second act, &quot;We&#x27;re stuck up here in this gavotte&quot;.
* The Johnny Mercer song &quot;Strip Polka&quot; includes the lyric &quot;Oh, she hates corny waltzes and she hates the gavotte&quot;.
* Geneticist W. D. Hamilton in his paper &quot;Gamblers since life began: barnacles, aphids, elms.&quot; in &quot;The Quarterly Review of Biology&quot; (1975) referred to the drilled formality of the mechanisms of individual reproduction as &quot;the gavotte of chromosomes&quot;.
* Philosopher Stephen David Ross characterises metaphysical aporia as &quot;the disruptive side of a tradition that needs both repetition and its annihilation for intelligibility. It is a site at which same and other dance their unending gavotte of life and death.&quot;
*Agustín Barrios wrote a solo guitar piece, &quot;Madrigal Gavotte&quot;, which is a combination of the two styles.
* In the anime &quot;Kiniro no Corda&quot; (&quot;La Corda d&#x27;Oro&quot;), &quot;Gavotte in D&quot; by Gossec is heard many times, though referred to only as &quot;Gavotte&quot;.
* In the 1990 novel &quot;Good Omens&quot; by Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman, it is noted that one cannot determine how many angels can dance on the head of a pin, because angels do not dance—the exception being the Principality Aziraphale, who once learned to do the gavotte in a discreet gentlemen&#x27;s club in Portland Place in the late 1880s.
*In the Broadway musical &quot;1776&quot; during the song &quot;Cool, Considerate Men&quot;, reference is made to &quot;Mr. Adams&#x27; new gavotte&quot;—a reference regarding John Adams&#x27; ideas for a declaration of independence from Great Britain.
*In the 1967 film &quot;How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying&quot; the song &quot;A Secretary Is Not a Toy&quot; refers to a gavotte.

*In the mid-nineteenth-century novel &quot;The Scout&quot;, William Gilmore Simms describes a lonely sentry: &quot;He sang, and whistled, and soliloquized; and, not unfrequently, relieved the dull measured step of the sentinel by the indulgence of such a gavotte as a beef-eating British soldier of the &#x27;prince&#x27;s own&#x27; might be supposed capable of displaying in that period of buckram movement.&quot;
* Describing American foreign policy in the wake of the September 11 attacks, author Norman Podhoretz says, &quot;Far from &#x27;rushing into war&#x27;, we were spending months dancing a diplomatic gavotte in the vain hope of enlisting the help of France, Germany, and Russia.&quot;
* Polish resistance fighter (1906–1987) describes his personal experience of the chaos of the first German air strike on Poland in these terms: &quot;Paintings were falling off the walls, the Biedermeier sofa and its complement of chairs bounced around as if dancing some crazy gavotte, the Bechstein grand piano slid past me on two of its casters ...&quot;.

<text>The Protection of Children Act 1978 (c. 37) is an act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom that criminalized indecent photographs of children. The act applies in England and Wales. Similar provision for Scotland is contained in the Civic Government (Scotland) Act 1982 and for Northern Ireland in the Protection of Children (Northern Ireland) Order 1978.

==History==
The Protection of Children Bill was put before Parliament as a Private Member&#x27;s Bill by the Conservative member of parliament Cyril Townsend in the 1977–1978 parliamentary session. This bill came about as a result of the concern over child pornography and the sexual exploitation of children that had arisen in the United States of America in 1977. This cause was taken up in the UK by the press and Mary Whitehouse, who in a speech in 1977 had accused the Albany Trust of using public money effectively supporting the Paedophile Information Exchange (the project for a joint Albany/PIE pamphlet was scrapped). Decades later, it emerged that she had been accurate in her assertion. The existence of PIE was given by Townsend as an issue favouring legislation against child pornography. Whitehouse&#x27;s National Viewers&#x27; and Listeners&#x27; Association was able to campaign in support of the Bill and present a petition bearing 1.5 million signatures.

When the progress of the bill was threatened by MP Ian Mikardo, who blocked it to protest against tactics being used by the Conservative party to block Edward Fletcher&#x27;s bill on employment protection, the Prime Minister, James Callaghan, stepped in to ensure that the Bill received the time required to become law.

== Offences ==
Currently, the Act defines as offences, roughly:
*To take or make any indecent photograph or pseudo-photograph of a child;
*To show or distribute such (pseudo-)photographs;
*To possess such (pseudo-)photographs with intent to show or distribute them;
*To advertise for showing or distributing such (pseudo-)photographs.

== Amendments ==

=== 1994 ===
Originally, in 1978, the Act referred to &quot;photographs&quot;. 
In 1994, to cover also actions involving images created or altered with machines like computers, the Act was amended by the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994, to refer to taking, or &quot;making&quot;, &quot;photographs or pseudo-photographs&quot;, etcetera.

=== 2008 ===
The Act was further amended by the Criminal Justice and Immigration Act 2008, which provided that &quot;photograph&quot; includes:

&quot;a tracing or other image, whether made by electronic or other means (of whatever nature)— 
(i) which is not itself a photograph or pseudo-photograph, but 
(ii) which is derived from the whole or part of a photograph or pseudo-photograph (or a combination of either or both),&quot; and including data stored on a computer disc or by any other form of electronic means that can be converted into such an image.

== Definitions ==

=== The &quot;making&quot; offence ===
Causing an indecent photograph of a child to exist on a computer screen is considered to be &quot;making an indecent photograph of a child&quot;.

&quot;A person who either downloads images on to disc or who prints them off is making them. The Act is not only concerned with the original creation of images, but also their proliferation. Photographs or pseudo-photographs found on the Internet may have originated from outside the United Kingdom; to download or print within the jurisdiction is to create new material which hitherto may not have existed therein.&quot; (&quot;R v Bowden&quot;)

Because of the &quot;Bowden&quot; decision, it was also necessary to add a defence where it was necessary to make an indecent photograph or pseudo-photograph for the purposes of a criminal investigation.

1.– (1) Subject to sections 1A and 1B, it is an offence for a person–
:(a) to take, or permit to be taken or to make, any indecent photograph or pseudo-photograph of a child; or
:(b) to distribute or show such indecent photographs or pseudo-photographs; or
:(c) to have in his possession such indecent photographs or pseudo-photographs, with a view to their being distributed or shown by himself or others; or
:(d) to publish or cause to be published any advertisement likely to be understood as conveying that the advertiser distributes or shows such indecent photographs or pseudo-photographs or intends to do so.

=== Definition of a child ===
Initially, the definition of a child was contained in the definition of offences:
:1.-(1) It is an offence for a person-
::(a) to take, or permit to be taken, any indecent photograph of a child (meaning in this Act a person under the age of 16) ;

While adding the definition of pseudo-photographs, the 1994 Act deleted this definition and inserted a new subsection to the interpretation section:-

:7.-(6) &#x27;Child&#x27;, subject to subsection (8), means a person under the age of 16.

Subsection (8) defines pseudo-photographs.

Section 45 of the Sexual Offences Act 2003 made a number of changes to the 1978 Act. Principally it redefines a &quot;child&quot; for the purposes of the 1978 Act as a person under 18 years, rather than under 16 years, of age.

Section 45 of the Sexual Offences Act 2003 also inserted new sections 1A (Marriage and other relationships) into the 1978 Act and 160A into the Criminal Justice Act 1988. These sections apply where, in proceedings for an offence under section 1 of the 1978 Act or section 160 of the 1988 Act relating to an indecent photograph of a child, the defendant proves that the photograph was of the child aged 16 or over, and that at the time of the offence charged the child and the defendant were married or in a relationship. These sections were further amended by the Civil Partnerships Act 2004 to &quot;civil relationships&quot; after &quot;were married&quot;

=== Definition of photograph ===
&#x27;Photograph&#x27; shall include film, video-recording, copy of photograph or film or video-recording, photo comprised in a film or video-recording; negatives of photograph etc.; data on a computer etc. which can be converted to photograph etc.

=== Definition of indecent ===
The Act does not define the term &#x27;indecent&#x27;.

=== Definition of pseudo-photograph ===
The Act defines a &quot;pseudo-photograph&quot; as &quot;an image, whether made by computer-graphics or otherwise howsoever, which appears to be a photograph&quot;, and 
further a copy of a pseudo-photograph, including data stored on a computer disc or by any other form of electronic means that can be converted into a pseudo-photograph.

== Offences committed abroad ==
Offences under this Act are subject to the dual criminality provisions of s.72 of the Sexual Offences Act 2003.

==Interpretation==

===Indecency===

In &quot;R v Graham-Kerr&quot; (1988), the accused had taken photographs of a young boy at a nudist meeting at a public swimming baths. The Court of Appeal held that the motivation of the photographer had no influence on the decency or otherwise of the photographs taken; a photograph is an indecent photograph of a child if it is indecent, and if it shows a child.

Whether or not a photograph or pseudo-photograph is indecent is a question of fact, and as a question of fact it is something for a jury or magistrate to decide. The jury should apply the standard of decency which ordinary right-thinking members of the public would set - the &quot;recognised standards of propriety&quot; as &quot;R v Stamford&quot; [1972] puts it.

===Relevance of the age of a known subject===
In &quot;R v Owen&quot; (1988), it was held that age of the child in the photograph is a consideration the jury should bear in mind when deciding whether or not the image is &quot;indecent&quot;. Owen was a professional photographer who had taken a number of photographs of a 14-year-old girl who, it was claimed, wanted to become a model. In these photographs the girl was scantily dressed and showing her bare breasts. The defence argued that the image should be judged as it stood, disregarding evidence of the girl&#x27;s age - presumably thinking that a similar image showing a model over the age of 16 would not be considered indecent at that time.

===Computer files===
In &quot;R v Fellows&quot; (1997) the Court of Appeal held that a computer file came within the scope of the definitions of the Act.

Section 7(2) of the 1978 Act defines references to an indecent photograph as including a copy of an indecent photograph.

A computer file contains data, not visible, which can be converted by appropriate technical means into a screen image and into a print which exactly reproduces the original photograph from which it was derived. It is a form of copy which makes the original photograph, or a copy of it, available for viewing by a person who has access to the file. There is nothing in the Act which makes it necessary that a copy should itself be a photograph within the dictionary or the statutory definition, and if there was, it would make the inclusion of the reference to a copy unnecessary. The Court of Appeal concluded that there is no restriction on the nature of a copy, and that the data in a computer file represents the original photograph, in another form.

===Establishing &quot;mens rea&quot;===

In 2003, the Sentencing Advisory Panel provided guidance for Judges considering sentences for people convicted of an offence under the Protection of Children Act. The lowest level of indecency was described as &quot;images depicting erotic posing with no sexual activity.&quot;

In &quot;R v Mould&quot; (2000), the Appeal Court ruled that &quot;Mr Burton [representing Mr Mould] was rightly concerned that the jury, in deciding whether or not the photograph was indecent, would wrongly take into account [data showing access to paedophile discussion forums].&quot; Although it was agreed that the jury should not use such information to make a judgment regarding the decency of the image for which Mr Mould was convicted, it was understood that &quot;the prosecution [successfully] sought to rely on it in order to prove that the appellant had deliberately created the .bmp file.&quot;

While a defendant&#x27;s proven sexual attraction to children should not affect indecency, it may affect the perceived &quot;mens rea&quot; of an act.

===Prosecuting a photograph where the age of the subject is unknown===
Where the age of the subject of a photograph is uncertain (i.e. where the identity of the subject is unknown), the subject&#x27;s age shall be determined from the photograph.

Section 2.-(3) provides that a person is to be taken as having been a child at any material time if it appears from the evidence as a whole that he was then under the defined age of a child.

In &quot;R v Land&quot; (1997), the Court of Appeal held that a jury is as well placed as an expert (e.g. a paediatrician) to assess any argument addressed to the question whether the prosecution had established that the person depicted in a photograph was a child, and in any event expert evidence would be inadmissible: expert evidence is admitted only to assist the court with information which was outside the normal experience and knowledge of the judge or jury.

===Making photographs (computer files)===
In an appeal against conviction in &quot;R v Bowden&quot; (1999), the Court of Appeal held that downloading data representing indecent photographs of children from the Internet amounts to an offence within the meaning of s.1(1)(a) of the Protection of Children Act 1978.

===Collages===

In &quot;Goodland v DPP&quot; (2000), Lord Justice Simon Brown ruled that &quot;an image made by an exhibit which obviously consists, as this one does, of parts of two different photographs sellotaped together cannot be said to appear to be &quot;a photograph&quot;. This means that, if an item does not appear to be a single photograph, it does not fall within the scope of the Protection of Children Act. A photocopy or scan of such an item may appear to be a single photograph and so fall under the Act and could therefore be illegal if it shows a child and is judged to be indecent.

==Sentencing==

The sentencing guidelines for offences committed contrary to the Protection of Children Act were decided by the Sentencing Advisory Panel, to assist with sentencing during &quot;R v Oliver et al.&quot;. They have since been updated by the Sentencing Council.

The categories of indecent images are as follows:

Judges use the following guidelines when sentencing someone who has been convicted under the &quot;Protection of Children Act&quot;:

A person who is convicted of an offence under the Protection of Children Act is also likely to be banned from working with children in the United Kingdom, and ordered to sign the Sex Offenders Register. They are also barred from working in the legal and medical professions and will be dishonourably discharged from HM Armed Forces.

==Defences==

There are a small number of defences against charges under the Protection of Children Act. Below is a list of defences set by the statutes, precedents and case law.

===Marriage and enduring relationships===

On May 1, 2004, when section 45 of the Sexual Offences Act 2003 came into force, raising the general minimum age to appear in sexual images, in England and Wales, from 16 to 18, under the Protection of Children Act 1978, exceptions were provided for in law for contexts in which images of 16 and 17-years-olds were to remain lawful, these being under the following contexts:

In cases where a defendant has taken or made a photographic image of a child over the age of 16, the defendant is not guilty if, at the time when they obtained the photograph, they and the child:

:: (a) were married; or

:: (b) lived together as partners in an &quot;enduring family relationship&quot;1; and

:: (c) the defendant &quot;reasonably believed&quot; that the child consented to the image being obtained.

This exemption was introduced in 2003 under the Sexual Offences Act, which had changed the statutory definition of &quot;child&quot; (in the Protection of Children Act) from 16 to 18.
1 - A definition of &quot;enduring family relationship&quot; is not supplied within the Act.

===&quot;Mens rea&quot;===

The common-law &quot;mens rea&quot; defence applies to the Protection of Children Act offences. The prosecution must demonstrate that a defendant took a photograph deliberately, intending it to be an indecent photograph showing a child. Presumabably the notion of intention is that defined elsewhere in English criminal law found in &quot;Woolin&quot; [1998]: that is, either clear intent or (summarised) &#x27;whatever the defendant&#x27;s purpose, if it is virtually certain that the actus reus will result from the defendant&#x27;s action, then the jury may infer intent.&quot;

By the latter test mere &quot;foreseeability&quot; or &quot;likelihood&quot; will not suffice (see &quot;Nedrick&quot; and &quot;Woollin&quot;) as this encroaches on the notion of recklessness. It would appear that the offences in the act are of specific intent (that is, intent is required and not mere recklessness, and certainly the offences are not absolute with strict liability, see &quot;Smith&quot; and &quot;Jayson&quot; below).

This was upheld in &quot;R v Smith and Jayson&quot; (2003), where it was held that &quot;the mens rea necessary to constitute the offence [of making an indecent pseudo-photograph of a child] is that the act of making should be a deliberate and intentional act with knowledge that the image made is, or is likely to be, an indecent image of a child&quot;

It is thus a defence for the defendant to raise sufficient doubt about whether he took, made, distributed, showed or possessed an image without the knowledge that the image was, or was likely to be:

::* an indecent image; and
::* an image of a child.

Further to this, if an image is found only in a computer cache, if the defendant can reasonably be thought not to have had knowledge of the existence of the cache, he is innocent of a possession offence. The mere existence of the image in the cache should not necessarily be sufficient proof that the image was made when it was downloaded, however; this should be backed up by evidence of an intentional directed search, for example (see &quot;Atkins v DPP&quot;).

The definition of the mens rea for making, however was thought to be thrown into confusion by the decision in &quot;Harrison v R [2007] EWCA Crim 2976&quot; where it was suggested that if the actions of the defendant were &quot;very likely&quot; to make an image that would constitute the mens rea. &quot;Smith&quot; and &quot;Jayson&quot; however were not overtly overruled and &quot;Harrison&quot; is regarded as made &quot;per incuriam&quot; or at least a badly worded setting out of the rule found in &quot;Woollin.&quot; In &quot;Harrison&quot; there was clear and admitted evidence that a directed (and &quot;unusual&quot;) search for and visit to a site had been made which would fall under the &quot;Woollin&quot; rule - it could be argued that it was a virtual certainty that images would be made (in the cache). Harrison knew that &quot;pop-ups&quot; which contained indecent images of children would be produced and carried on regardless.

<text>Jan Kodeš (born 1 March 1946) is a Czech former professional tennis player. A three-time major singles champion, Kodeš was one of the premier players in the early 1970s.

Kodeš&#x27;s greatest success was achieved on the clay courts of the French Open, where he won the singles title in 1970 and 1971. However, he also won Wimbledon on grass courts in 1973, although the tournament was largely boycotted by top players that year in a show of solidarity over the ban of Nikola Pilić by the International Lawn Tennis Federation (ILTF).

Kodeš never played at the Australian Open, but was twice the runner-up at the US Open, in 1971 and 1973. Kodeš reached his highest ATP ranking of world No. 5 in September 1973. During the Open Era, he won nine top-level singles titles and 17 doubles titles.

Kodeš was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in 1990. In 2013, he received the Czech Fair Play Award from the Czech Olympic Committee. He is an economics graduate of the Prague University.

==Career statistics==

The tables do not include victories and final participation in tournaments from 1966 to 1969, such as victories in international championships and tournaments in Santiago, Viña del Mar, Sao Paulo, Lyon, Cannes, Luxembourg, St. Petersburg (USA), Beirut, Zaragoza, Split, Varna, Plovdiv, Paris (Racing Club) and three times in the MM CSSR in Bratislava. In doubles with Javorsky in Bratislava, then with Jan Kukal, he won tournaments in Lyon, Hilversum, Macon (USA), Pittsburgh, Caracas, Istanbul, Bratislava, Beirut and Split. With Pala in Luxembourg and Zaragoza. With Rodriguez in Viña del Mar, Chile. In all these tournaments or championships, the starting field was always at least 32 players, like today&#x27;s ATP tour tournaments, but they are not listed in the ATP Tour yearbooks because the ATP Tour did not exist at that time and did not publish publications.

In the book written by Petr Kolar and Jan Kodes, &quot;A Journey to Glory from behind the Iron Curtain&quot;, there are 25 singles wins, 27 appearances in finals, 32 doubles wins and 29 appearances in doubles finals. He participated in the final Grand Prix &quot;Masters&quot; tournaments (now ATP Finals) from 1970-1974 (Tokyo 1970, Paris 1971, Barcelona 1972, Boston 1973 and Dallas 1974).

===Grand Slam finals: 5 (3 titles, 2 runner-ups)===
===Grand Slam singles performance timeline===


==Open era finals==
===Singles (9 titles, 19 runner-ups)===
===Doubles (17 titles, 24 runner-ups)===
At results above are not shown wins and runner-ups from 1965 to 1969, such as tournaments in Santiago, Viňa del Mar, São Paulo, Lyon, Cannes, Luxembourg, Split, Varna, Plovdiv, Paris (Racing Club) or International championships of Czechoslovakia in Bratislava. The draws of players were always minimum 32 players, same as at contemporary ATP Tour events, but they are not listed in ATP Annuals, since ATP was founded at 1972.

<doc id="460780" wikidata="Q246716" url="?curid=460780" title="Bob Wilson (footballer, born 1941)">
<text>Robert Primrose Wilson (born 30 October 1941) is a former Scotland international football goalkeeper and later broadcaster / anchorman.

As a player, Wilson spent 11 years at Arsenal, where he made over 300 appearances. He also featured as a youth and senior international for Scotland. After retiring as a player, he turned to coaching and broadcasting, presenting football programmes on television for 28 years until 2002. Wilson also founded the Willow Foundation charity in memory of his daughter.

==Early life==
Wilson was born on Ashgate Road, in Chesterfield, where his father William was the Borough Engineer and Surveyor, and his mother Catherine Wilson (née Primrose) was a magistrate. Their Ashgate Road house was named &quot;Threepwood&quot; after the Galston, East Ayrshire farm where William Wilson was born.

He was the youngest child of six and had much older brothers and an elder sister. Two of his brothers were killed in the Second World War, one as a Spitfire pilot and the other as a rear-gunner in a Lancaster.

He spent time with Loughborough College.

==Club career==

Wilson started late as a professional player, as his father would not let him sign papers with Manchester United as he thought it was not a reasonable job whilst he was a youth. Wilson then went on to Loughborough College for training as a teacher. He had been playing reserve games for Wolverhampton Wanderers as an amateur between 1961 and 1963 and was the first amateur to have a transfer fee paid (£7,500). He remained an amateur for eight months when he signed for Arsenal in July 1963 until he signed professional forms in March 1964.

Wilson made his debut against Nottingham Forest on 26 October 1963 in a 4–2 win. However, being forced to play understudy to Jim Furnell, it was to be over four years until Wilson became first-choice keeper in 1968, after Furnell made a mistake in an FA Cup tie against Birmingham City in March 1968. Wilson took over and remained in goal for Arsenal for the remainder of the 1967–68 season.

Later, firmly ensconced in the Arsenal side, Wilson was ever-present in the 1968–69 season, which included Arsenal&#x27;s loss to Swindon Town in the 1969 League Cup Final. Despite sustaining a broken arm the following season, 1969–70, Wilson recovered and won his first trophy with Arsenal, the 1969–70 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup. In 1971, he was Arsenal&#x27;s player of the year in their Double-winning season, in which he played every first-team match in League and Cup, culminating in the 1971 FA Cup Final win over Liverpool.

Wilson continued to play as Arsenal&#x27;s keeper through the early 1970s, although an injury late on in the 1972 FA Cup semi-final against Stoke City meant he missed Arsenal&#x27;s 1972 FA Cup Final loss to Leeds United and much of the 1972–73 season. Understudy Geoff Barnett took his place, but Wilson regained the number one shirt once fully recovered, and was Arsenal&#x27;s first-choice goalkeeper up until his surprisingly early retirement from playing in May 1974, at the age of 32.

As a student and teacher of goalkeeping, Wilson has identified his own signature technique as diving at his opponents&#x27; feet to save goals. This caused him a number of injuries throughout his career.

==International career==
He became eligible to play for Scotland when the rules were changed in 1970 to allow players to play for their parents&#x27; countries of origin, if they had not already played for their own country. Wilson was selected by Scotland manager Tommy Docherty for his first match in charge, against Portugal on 13 October 1971. Wilson was also selected for the match against the Netherlands on 1 December 1971, but Bobby Clark of Aberdeen was preferred after this.

==Coaching career==
After retiring, Wilson was goalkeeping coach for Arsenal for 28 years, during which Pat Jennings, John Lukic, and David Seaman were goalkeepers. He retired at the end of the 2002–03 season, having helped Arsenal win two more doubles in 1997–98 and 2001–02, as only one of two people to have been involved with all three, with the other being Pat Rice.

==Broadcasting career==
===BBC===
Wilson had already appeared as a pundit for the BBC during the 1970 World Cup. He became a television presenter after retiring from football, working for the BBC from 1974 to 1994 as host of &quot;Football Focus&quot;. During the late 1980s and early 1990s, he also presented &quot;Grandstand&quot; on a fairly regular basis (he was the presenter on &quot;Grandstand&quot; during the afternoon of the Hillsborough Disaster in 1989), and also occasionally presented &quot;Sportsnight&quot;. During the 1980s, he co-presented &quot;Match of the Day&quot; alongside Jimmy Hill, and also worked extensively on the BBC&#x27;s World Cup coverage into the 1990s. During Des Lynam&#x27;s time as the main BBC anchorman, Wilson often covered much of the World Cup while Lynam was concentrating on the Wimbledon Tennis Championships. Wilson also read the sports bulletins on &quot;Breakfast News&quot; during the late 1980s and early-mid 1990s, and was one of the hosts of the BBC Olympics coverage from Seoul in 1988.

===ITV===
In late 1994, he moved to ITV, where he presented the station&#x27;s UEFA Champions League, League Cup and FA Cup coverage. In addition, he presented Carlton Television&#x27;s midweek highlights programme &quot;Carlton Sport&quot;. He also fronted ITV&#x27;s coverage of Euro 96 and the 1998 World Cup, including England&#x27;s loss to Argentina on penalties in the last 16 stage, which was watched by more than 23 million viewers. Following the arrival of Des Lynam at ITV in 1999, Wilson&#x27;s role was diminished and he was mostly seen presenting late night highlights programmes on ITV. He also hosted coverage of matches being shown on On Digital&#x27;s sports channels and he remained with them as it evolved into the ill-fated ITV Sport Channel, presenting the service&#x27;s coverage of the pay-per-view Premier League matches. By the early 2000s, Gabby Logan had assumed some of Wilson&#x27;s work, especially on the main ITV channel, and Wilson had a much smaller role with the station at the 2002 World Cup, which was to be his last work for ITV.

He still makes occasional appearances on television, on the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Football Focus&quot; and &quot;Match of the Day 2&quot;, as well as occasional work on documentary programmes for Sky Sports. Half Man Half Biscuit made reference to Wilson as a broadcaster in the song &quot;Bob Wilson – Anchorman&quot;.

He was the subject of &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; in 1998, when he was surprised by Michael Aspel during a training session with Arsenal at their training ground near St Albans.

===&quot;Roy of the Rovers&quot;===
In the mid-1980s he featured in a comic strip when he spent a season playing for the fictional Melchester Rovers team in &quot;Roy of the Rovers&quot;, in a team containing another former professional player turned TV presenter, Emlyn Hughes, and Spandau Ballet members Martin Kemp and Steve Norman. The quartet helped lead Rovers to League Cup glory and a record-breaking successive number of clean sheets – a somewhat unrealistic achievement considering Wilson&#x27;s age and the fact he had not played for more than 10 years.

==Personal life==
Wilson married Margaret &quot;Megs&quot; Miles on 25 July 1964 at Holy Trinity Church, Chesterfield, and they had three children: John (born 1965), Anna (1966–1998) and Robert (born 1968). John Wilson is a presenter on &quot;Front Row&quot;, the BBC Radio 4 arts programme. Megs Wilson died in November 2023.

It was announced in April 2014 that Wilson was fighting prostate cancer.

His middle name, Primrose, stems from a Scottish tradition of giving children their mother&#x27;s maiden name as a middle name.

Wilson&#x27;s great niece is Gina Coladangelo, a British businesswoman and lobbyist who made headlines in 2021 after exposure of her extramarital affair with Health Secretary Matt Hancock.

===Charity work===
In February 1994, his daughter Anna was diagnosed with malignant schwannoma, a cancer of the nerve sheath. She died on 1 December 1998, six days before her 32nd birthday. The &quot;Willow Foundation&quot; was set up in her memory in 1999 and operated locally, mainly in Hertfordshire. Wilson relaunched the charity on 4 October 2005 with a national remit. The organisation was established in Anna&#x27;s memory and now helps some of the estimated 12,500 people in the UK, aged 16–40, who are diagnosed every year with the illness.

In 2007, Wilson was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) for his charity work.

=== Honorary award ===
In 1989, Wilson received an honorary award of Doctor of Letters from Loughborough University.

<doc id="460783" wikidata="Q2908751" url="?curid=460783" title="Delta Dreamflight">
<text>Delta Dreamflight, renamed Dreamflight and later Take Flight during its final two years of operation, was an attraction located in Magic Kingdom&#x27;s Tomorrowland at the Walt Disney World Resort. It was sponsored by Delta Air Lines. Dreamflight replaced an attraction called If You Could Fly (originally If You Had Wings), sponsored by Eastern Air Lines.

==Overview==
Dreamflight was a dark ride which showcased the history of flight using simplistic sets, some Audio-Animatronics, and projection effects, utilizing the Omnimover ride system.

Guests entered a queue mimicking an airport terminal. The front of an actual Delta 767 was situated on the left, giving the illusion that guests were actually boarding a jetliner named &quot;The Spirit of Delta.&quot;

Aboard the attraction, guests first encountered a mural depicting the golden era of aviation in America, followed by a hot air balloon and other flying contraptions in the style of a pop-up book. Next, a giant crop field of the American mid-west in the roaring 1920s featured biplanes, stunt planes, and barnstormers, flying above.

Guests would then emerge onto a dock in the San Francisco Bay and into the fuselage of Boeing 314 Flying Boat, before finding themselves in Tokyo and then Paris.

Footage of a plane taking off simulated their flight&#x27;s departure to the next area, flying through a canyon over water and through a futuristic city with fireworks.

==Delta sponsorship==
Delta sponsored the ride from its opening in 1989 through the end of 1995. The decision not to renew was made in part due to costs of sponsoring the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, Georgia. From January 1, 1996 to June 4, 1996, the attraction was renamed simply Dreamflight. On June 5, 1996 it reopened as Take Flight. All references to Delta were removed, and the attraction&#x27;s theme songs were rerecorded.

The attraction ultimately closed on January 5, 1998. It was replaced by the interactive dark ride Buzz Lightyear&#x27;s Space Ranger Spin, inspired by Disney/Pixar&#x27;s &quot;Toy Story&quot; films.

<doc id="460785" wikidata="Q312613" url="?curid=460785" title="Richard II, Duke of Normandy">
<text>Richard II (died 28 August 1026), called the Good (French: &quot;Le Bon&quot;), was the duke of Normandy from 996 until 1026.

==Life==
Richard was the eldest surviving son and heir of Richard the Fearless and Gunnor. He succeeded his father as the ruler of Normandy in 996. During his minority, the first five years of his reign, his regent was Count Rodulf of Ivry, his uncle, who wielded the power and put down a peasant insurrection at the beginning of Richard&#x27;s reign.

Richard had deep religious interests and found he had much in common with King Robert II of France, whom he helped militarily against the Duchy of Burgundy. He forged a marriage alliance with Duke Geoffrey I of Brittany by marrying his sister Hawise to him and by his own marriage to Geoffrey&#x27;s sister Judith.

By 1000, Vikings had begun raiding England again, where they would subsequently cross the channel to Normandy and sell their plunder. Richard provided the Vikings with sanctuary and even welcomed them. This act violated a treaty signed between his father Richard I and King Æthelred II of England, in which he agreed not to aid enemies of England following similar events of assisting the Danes. As a result, Richard was forced to repel an English attack on the Cotentin Peninsula that was led by Æthelred. Æthelred had given orders that Richard be captured, bound, and brought to England. But the English were not prepared for the rapid response of the Norman cavalry and were utterly defeated.

Richard attempted to improve relations with England through his sister Emma&#x27;s marriage to Æthelred. This marriage was significant in that it later gave his grandson, William the Conqueror, the basis of his claim to the throne of England. Emma with her two sons Edward and Alfred fled to Normandy, followed shortly thereafter by her husband King Æthelred. Soon after the death of Ethelred, Cnut the Great married Emma, forcing Richard to recognize the new regime as his sister was again queen. Richard had contacts with Scandinavian Vikings throughout his reign and he employed Viking mercenaries. Following the St Brice&#x27;s Day Massacre ordered by Æthelred in 1013, King Sweyn Forkbeard of Denmark summoned an army to exact revenge on the English and sailed for England. He stopped in Rouen and was well received and treated courteously by Richard, who concluded an alliance with him.

Richard II carried on his father Richard&#x27;s commission from his clerk and confessor, Dudo of Saint-Quentin, of a history of the dukes of Normandy. While Dudo had access to written records and to eye-witnesses, his history is more panegyric than chronicle: its narrative is of the pagan conversion to Christianity and the consequent legitimacy of rule of the dukes. As such, it is a careful mix of mendacity and veracity, and should not be read uncritically.

In 1025 and 1026 Richard confirmed gifts of his great-grandfather Rollo to Saint-Ouen at Rouen. His other numerous grants to monastic houses tend to indicate the areas over which Richard had ducal control, namely Caen, the Éverecin, the Cotentin, the Pays de Caux, and Rouen.

Richard II died in 1026. His eldest son, Richard III, became the new duke.

==Marriages and children==
Richard married firstly, c.1000, Judith (982–1017), daughter of Conan I of Brittany, by whom he had the following issue:

*Richard III (c. 1002/4), duke of Normandy
*Alice (c. 1003/5), married Count Reginald I of Burgundy
*Robert (c. 1005/7), duke of Normandy
*William (c. 1007/9), monk at Fécamp, d. 1025, buried at Fécamp Abbey
*Eleanor (c. 1011/3), married to Count Baldwin IV of Flanders
*Matilda (c. 1013/5), nun at Fecamp, d. 1033.

With his second wife, Poppa of Envermeu, Richard had the following issue:
*Mauger (c. 1019), archbishop of Rouen
*William (c. 1020/5), count of Arques

<text>The prowfish (Zaprora silenus) is a species of scorpaeniform marine fish found in the northern Pacific Ocean. It is the only extant member of the family, Zaproridae. There are 2 extinct species only known with fossil records, &quot;Zaprora koreana&quot; from the Middle Miocene Duho Formation in Pohang, South Korea. Another genus, &quot;Araeosteus rothi&quot;, is known from the Monterey Formation and the Modelo Formation in Southern California.

Prowfish range from the Aleutian Islands, Alaska west to Kamchatka, Russia; from Navarin Canyon in the Bering Sea south to Hokkaidō, Japan and Monterey, California. An otherwise little-known species, prowfish are important to subsistence fisheries in remote regions.

Growing to a length of , prowfish have stout, laterally compressed and elongated bodies. They have single, somewhat high dorsal fin running nearly the entire length of the back; it may contain 54–58 pliable spines. The anal fin is also fairly extensive. The tail fin is large, rounded and truncated; the pectoral fins are enlarged and pelvic fins are conspicuously absent. The mouth is slightly upturned with small, closely set, sharp teeth confined to the jaws. The head is convex, ending in a projecting snout. This explains the family name Zaproridae; from the Greek &quot;za&quot;, an intensifier, and &quot;prora&quot; meaning &quot;prow&quot;. The species name &quot;silneus&quot; is a reference to Silenus, a figure in Greek mythology.

The distinctive head of the prowfish also features a number of sensory pores made all the more obvious by fringes of blue or white. Prowfish have small ctenoid scales and a variable coloration; typically, they are bluish-grey to olive brown with small dark spots, grading to lighter shades ventrally. The lateral line and swim bladder are absent.

Prowfish prefer rocky substrates and range from relatively shallow waters to . They are benthic animals spending most of their time on or near the bottom. Their diet consists principally of scyphozoans and salps; prowfish use their large mouths to tear chunks from the bells of jellyfish and ctenophores. Prowfish may also eat smaller fish and amphipods; however, juveniles feed exclusively on jellyfish. Larger skates and Pacific halibut are known predators of prowfish.

Little is known of prowfish reproduction, but juveniles have been observed to be pelagic; unlike adults, they spend their time in the middle levels of the water column, closely associated with their jellyfish prey. Indeed, juvenile prowfish will seek shelter from prey within the bells of larger jellies. This behaviour has led to their confusion with the medusafish (&quot;Icichthys lockingtoni&quot;) of the family Centrolophidae. Most female prowfish are thought to reach maturity at around five years. There is little sexual dimorphism; females are slightly heavier for their length.

<text>In the context of telecommunications, a terminal is a device which ends a telecommunications link and is the point at which a signal enters or leaves a network. Examples of terminal equipment include telephones, fax machines, computer terminals, printers and workstations.

An end instrument is a piece of equipment connected to the wires at the end of a telecommunications link. In telephony, this is usually a telephone connected to a local loop. End instruments that relate to data terminal equipment include printers, computers, barcode readers, automated teller machines (ATMs) and the console ports of routers.
