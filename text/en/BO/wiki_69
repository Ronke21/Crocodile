<text>Sierra de San Pedro Mártir (Kiliwa: ʔxaal haq, ) is a mountain range located within southern Ensenada Municipality and southern Baja California state, of northwestern Mexico.

It is a major mountain range in the long Peninsular Ranges System, that extends from Southern California down the Baja California Peninsula into Baja California Sur state.

==Geography==
The range&#x27;s highest peak is Picacho del Diablo at in elevation. Also known as &quot;Cerro de la Encantada&quot; (Enchanted Mountain) and &quot;Picacho la Providencia&quot; (Providence Peak), it is the highest point in Baja California state and of the entire Baja California Peninsula.

The range is a drainage divide that demarcates the drainages flowing west into the Pacific Ocean or east into the Gulf of California for this section of the Baja California Peninsula. Snow is usually present at the highest elevations in the winter.

The Sierra de Juárez are on the north, and Sierra de San Francisco are on the south, both are also part of the Peninsular Ranges System.

===Features===
;Parque Nacional Sierra de San Pedro Mártir
Parque Nacional Sierra de San Pedro Mártir protects an area of in the Sierra de San Pedro Mártir. It was established by presidential decree in 1974, and the first of two national parks to be established on the Baja California Peninsula. The second is Parque Nacional Constitución de 1857 to the north, in the Sierra de Juárez and also in Baja California state.

;National Astronomical Observatory
The National Astronomical Observatory is located at an elevation of in the range. The astronomical complex was built in 1975. It has several large telescopes, the largest of which is in diameter. The observatory&#x27;s site takes advantage of the high elevation, along with typically clear skies, low relative humidity, low atmospheric pollution, low light pollution, and low levels of radio interference.

The range was a site considered for construction of the Thirty Meter Telescope, now tentatively planned for a controversial site on Mauna Kea in Hawaii.

In 1889, there was a gold rush in the Santa Clara mountains about southeast of Ensenada.

==Ecology==

;Flora
Sierra de San Pedro Mártir has a very similar flora to the Sierra de Juárez on the north. Higher elevations have Sierra Juarez and San Pedro Martir pine-oak forests ecoregion flora, which are surrounded at lower elevations by California chaparral and woodlands ecoregion flora, and at lowest elevations by the Baja California desert ecoregion flora.

The flora is distinct from that of &#x27;mainland&#x27; Mexico across the Gulf of California to the east, and shares many species with the Laguna Mountains and Cuyamaca Mountains, also Peninsular Ranges, in San Diego County, California. Typical conifer species include white fir, sugar pine and Jeffrey pine. The critically endangered San Pedro Mártir cypress (&quot;Hesperocyparis montana&quot;) is endemic to the Sierra. The canyons of the lower eastern Sierra de Pedro Mártir are the southernmost of natural distribution of the California fan palm (&quot;Washingtonia filifera&quot;). Native oaks include coast live oak (&quot;Quercus agrifolia&quot;), canyon live oak (&quot;Quercus chrysolepis&quot;), Engelmann oak (&quot;Quercus engelmannii&quot;), and Baja oak (&quot;Quercus peninsularis&quot;).

;Fauna
Baja California rainbow trout (&quot;Oncorhynchus mykiss nelsoni&quot;) are native to the headwaters of Rio Santo Domingo in the Sierra San Pedro Mártir. Desert bighorn sheep (&quot;Ovis canadensis nelsoni&quot;) also live in the range.

California condors, zoo-bred from the San Diego Zoo Safari Park condor program, were reintroduced into the Sierra San Pedro Martir in 2002, the first time seen in the range since 1937. Each year, a small group of young California condors are selected from the pool of birds being bred by the Los Angeles Zoo, San Diego Zoo Safari Park, Oregon Zoo, and The Peregrine Fund for release to the wild. Annual releases range from four to seven zoo-bred birds. As of 2022 there were about 40 condors living in the Sierra.

<doc id="459442" wikidata="Q96392575" url="?curid=459442" title="Member of Provincial Parliament (Canada)">
<text>A member of Provincial Parliament (MPP) is an elected member of the Legislative Assembly of the Canadian province of Ontario. Elsewhere in Canada, the titular designation &quot;Member of Provincial Parliament&quot; has also been used to refer to members of the Legislative Assembly of Lower Canada from 1791 to 1838, and to members of the Legislative Assembly of Quebec from 1955 to 1968.

== Ontario ==
The titular designation &quot;Member of Provincial Parliament&quot; and the acronym &quot;MPP&quot; were formally adopted by the Ontario legislature on April 7, 1938. Before the adoption of this resolution, members had no fixed designation. Prior to Confederation in 1867, members of the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Canada had been known by various titles, including MPP, MLA and MHA. This confusion persisted after 1867, with members of the Ontario legislature using the title Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) or Member of Provincial Parliament (MPP) interchangeably.

In 1938, Frederick Fraser Hunter, the member for St. Patrick, introduced a private member&#x27;s bill to designate members with the title Member of Parliament (MP), arguing that the titles of MPP or MLA were confusing, inaccurate, and undignified. However, his proposal failed to pass. As an alternative, a resolution was adopted fixing the title as Member of Provincial Parliament (MPP).

The text of the resolution passed by the House on that day is as follows:

&quot;On motion of Mr. Hunter, seconded by Mr. Miller&quot;,
&quot;Resolved&quot;, That in all matters of address, titular distinction, formal correspondence, official proceedings and all similar matters having to do with and coming under the jurisdiction of the Legislature of Ontario, the members of the Legislative Assembly shall be entitled to the designation &quot;Member of Provincial Parliament&quot; and its abbreviation &quot;M.P.P.&quot;

== Quebec ==
In Quebec, a bill to adopt the titular designation &quot;Member of Provincial Parliament&quot; (&quot;fr:membre du Parlement provincial&quot;) and the initialism &quot;MPP&quot; (&quot;fr:M.P.P.&quot;) was assented on December 15, 1955. Like in Ontario, members had no fixed designation prior to this bill&#x27;s adoption, although they were usually referred to as &quot;Members of the Legislative Assembly&quot; (MLAs) (&quot;fr:membres de l&#x27;Assemblée législative (M.A.L.s)&quot;).

The bill to change the titular designation was supported by Quebec premier Maurice Duplessis, who gave a speech in support of it in the legislative assembly. The reasons he gave for this change were the following:

# The French acronym for &quot;Member of the Legislative Assembly&quot; (&quot;M.A.L.&quot;) can sometimes be pronounced as &quot;mal&quot;, which means &quot;evil&quot; in French.
# Quebec&#x27;s legislature has all the fiscal and constitutional prerogatives to be considered a &quot;Parliament&quot;, and the new designation would better reflect that.
# The new designation would be a return to the original designation used before confederation.
# The Acronym MPP is the same in French and in English.

The designation was changed again in 1968 when the National Assembly of Quebec was renamed. The member&#x27;s titular designation was &quot;Member of the Quebec Parliament&quot; (MQP, or &quot;membre du Parlement du Québec (M.P.Q)&quot;) from 1968 to 1971, then &quot;Member of the National Assembly&quot; (MNA, or &quot;membres de l&#x27;Assemblée Nationale (M.A.N.&quot;) from 1971 to 1982. The designation &quot;Member of the National Assembly&quot; is still used in English, but the French titular designation was abolished, and MNAs are now simply referred to as &quot;député&quot;, the same title used for federal members of Parliament and for the members of other provincial assemblies.

== Other designations ==
Ontario is currently the only Canadian provincial legislative assembly to employ this designation. Members of other Canadian provincial and territorial assemblies employ the titles:

* &quot;Member of the National Assembly&quot; (MNA) in Quebec,
* &quot;Member of the House of Assembly&quot; (MHA) in Newfoundland and Labrador
* &quot;Member of the Legislative Assembly&quot; (MLA) in all other provinces and territories.

<doc id="459445" wikidata="Q885701" url="?curid=459445" title="Blue Ensign">
<text>The Blue Ensign is a British ensign that may be used on vessels by certain authorised yacht clubs, Royal Research Ships and British merchant vessels whose master holds a commission in the Royal Naval Reserve or has otherwise been issued a warrant. Defaced versions with a badge or other emblem are used more broadly; in the United Kingdom by authorised government or private bodies; and internationally by nations or organisations previously a part of the British Empire. 

The evolution of the Blue Ensign followed that of the Union Jack. The ensign originated in the 17th century with the St George&#x27;s Cross (the Flag of England) in the canton, and with a blue field.

The Acts of Union 1707 united England (which included present day Wales) with Scotland in the Kingdom of Great Britain, thus producing a new Blue Ensign with the new Union Flag, containing a saltire, in the canton. With the Act of Union 1800, Ireland became a part of the new United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, and St Patrick&#x27;s Cross was incorporated into the Union Flag and, accordingly, into the cantons of all British ensigns from 1 January 1801.

==Plain Blue Ensign==
Prior to the reorganisation of the Royal Navy in 1864, the plain blue ensign had been the ensign of one of three squadrons of the Royal Navy, the Blue Squadron. This changed in 1864, when an order in council provided that the Red Ensign was allocated to merchantmen, the Blue Ensign was to be the flag of ships in public service or commanded by an officer in the Royal Naval Reserve, and the White Ensign was allocated to the Navy.

Thus, since 1864, the plain blue ensign (without any defacement or modification) is permitted to be worn, instead of the Red Ensign, by three categories of civilian vessel:

# British merchant vessels whose officers and crew include a certain number of retired Royal Navy personnel or Royal Naval Reservists, or are commanded by an officer of the Royal Naval Reserve in possession of a Government warrant. The number and rank of such crew members required has varied over the years, as have the additional conditions required, since the system was first introduced in 1864.
# Royal Research Ships by warrant whether crewed by former Royal Navy personnel or Merchant Navy personnel.
# British-registered yachts belonging to members of the following yacht clubs:

*Hornet Services Sailing Club
*Royal Naval Club and Royal Albert Yacht Club
*Royal Brighton Yacht Club, Victoria
*Royal British Virgin Islands Yacht Club 
*Royal Cinque Ports Yacht Club 
*Royal Cruising Club
*Royal Dorset Yacht Club
*Royal Engineer Yacht Club 
*Royal Geelong Yacht Club, Victoria
*Royal Gourock Yacht Club 
*Royal Highland Yacht Club 
*Royal Marines Sailing Club
*Royal Melbourne Yacht Squadron, Victoria
*Royal Motor Yacht Club 
*Royal Naval Sailing Association 
*Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve Yacht Club 
*Royal New Zealand Yacht Squadron
*Royal Perth Yacht Club, Western Australia
*Royal Northern and Clyde Yacht Club 
*Royal Port Nicholson Yacht Club, New Zealand
*Royal Queensland Yacht Squadron
*Royal Scottish Motor Yacht Club
*Royal Solent Yacht Club
*Royal South Australia Yacht Squadron
*Royal Southern Yacht Club
*Royal Sydney Yacht Squadron, New South Wales
*Royal Temple Yacht Club
*Royal Thames Yacht Club
*Royal Victorian Motor Yacht Club
*Royal Welsh Yacht Club 
*Royal Western Yacht Club of England
*Royal Western Yacht Club of Scotland
*Royal Yacht Club of Tasmania
*Royal Yacht Club of Victoria
*Sussex Motor Yacht Club
*The Cruising Association

Permission for yachts to wear the blue ensign (and other special yachting ensigns) was suspended during both World War I and World War II.

In addition, prior to WWI, a number of ships (in particular, the and ) were listed as Royal Navy Reserve Merchant Vessels, receiving an annual subsidy from the navy and were permitted to fly the blue ensign.

==Defaced Blue Ensign==
Since 1864, the Blue Ensign is defaced with a badge or emblem, to form the ensign of United Kingdom government departments or public bodies. Current defaced Blue Ensigns (besides yacht clubs listed below) are:


Royal Air Force marine vessels (such as seaplane tenders) flew a defaced blue ensign with an eagle and anchor.

Yachting Blue Ensigns defaced by the badge of the club were recorded in the Navy List until 1985, and now they are administered by the Royal Yachting Association for the Ministry of Defence. Current defaced Blue Ensigns are:
==Flags of the Crown Dependencies using defaced Blue Ensigns==
* Government Ensign of Alderney
* Government Ensign of Guernsey
* Government Ensign of Jersey

==Flags of British Overseas Territories using defaced Blue Ensigns==
Current flags:
* Flag of Anguilla
* Government Ensign of Bermuda (the flag commonly used on land is Bermuda&#x27;s Red Ensign)
* Flag of the British Virgin Islands
* Flag of the Cayman Islands
* Flag of the Falkland Islands
* Government Ensign of Gibraltar (there is another flag, not based on an ensign, that is commonly used on land)

<doc id="459447" wikidata="Q701552" url="?curid=459447" title="Han Sui">
<text>Han Sui () (140s - June or July 215), courtesy name Wenyue, originally named Han Yue, was a military general and minor warlord who lived during the late Eastern Han dynasty of China. For most of his life, he was active in Liang Province (涼州; covering parts of present-day Shaanxi and Gansu) and was involved in several rebellions against the Han government and the warlord Cao Cao.

==Life==
With the backing of the Qiang people who populated much of Liang Province, Han Sui participated in the Liang Province Rebellion against the Han dynasty in the name of killing eunuchs during the rule of Emperor Ling. He joined forces with others in the area, such as Bian Zhang, Beigong Yu (北宫玉) and Liwen Hou (李文侯). Despite suffering a defeat by government forces under Dong Zhuo, Han Sui maintained the support of the Qiang people and maintained his territory in Liang Province. Han Sui is thought to have preferred to remain somewhat behind the scenes, placing someone else in the position of leadership while holding real power himself. When Bian Zhang and the other leaders passed from the scene, he placed Wang Guo (王國) in power with the help of his ally Ma Teng, whom he pledged a pact of brotherhood with. The arrangement did not last long, however, and Wang Guo was removed from power after being defeated by the Han general Huangfu Song. It was at this point that Han Sui and Ma Teng declared themselves co-rulers of Liang Province, now mostly autonomous due to turmoil in the Han dynasty.

Early in 192, the two of them submitted to the Han central government, then under Dong Zhuo&#x27;s control, but Dong Zhuo was assassinated by Lü Bu and Wang Yun in May. After Li Jue, Guo Si and other former followers of Dong Zhuo seized control of the Han central government later that year, Han Sui and Ma Teng allied themselves with Liu Yan and led their armies to attack the Han imperial capital, Chang&#x27;an. After suffering a major defeat 13 miles west of Chang&#x27;an, and running short on supplies, the warlords retreated back to Liang Province.

Not long afterwards, however, Han Sui and Ma Teng&#x27;s relationship soured and the two of them battled each other for control of Liang Province. Their battle escalated to the point where both were killing each other&#x27;s wives and children. Cao Cao, having achieved victory at the Battle of Guandu in 200CE, sent Zhong Yao to broker a peace between the two sides and to place Liang Province under Cao Cao&#x27;s authority. After the terms were agreed to, Han Sui and Ma Teng would give assistance to Cao Cao in the remainder of his battles against Yuan Shao. After this, Ma Teng was forcibly summoned to Ye and Han Sui placed Ma Teng&#x27;s son Ma Chao in charge of Liang Province.

When Cao Cao began gathering armies with the intent of invading Hanzhong Commandery, then under the rule of Zhang Lu, Han Sui and Ma Chao suspected that it was they, and not Zhang Lu who would be attacked. The two of them gathered warlords from the western regions and went to war against Cao Cao. In the course of the conflict, however, Cao Cao managed to turn Ma Chao and Han Sui against each other. Han Sui realised that there was no hope for victory with the forces divided against each other in suspicion, and retreated once again to Liang Province. Cao Cao captured and killed Han Sui&#x27;s children and grandchildren.

When Xiahou Yuan began his subjugation of Liang Province, Han Sui fought against Xiahou, but was ultimately defeated and forced to retreat. He discussed the idea of retreating to Yi Province (covering present-day Sichuan and Chongqing), but his subordinate Chenggong Ying encouraged him to continue his fight against Cao Cao instead. At this point, he was either murdered by some of his own followers or died of illness. In either case, his head was brought to Cao Cao by Han Sui&#x27;s subordinates as they all surrendered. He was believed to have been over 70 years old at the time of his death.

==In &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;==
In the 14th-century historical novel &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;, Han Sui is depicted as Ma Teng&#x27;s sworn brother and subordinate, when historically he was actually a warlord of equal footing as Ma Teng. Han Sui&#x27;s preference to remain out of the scenes may have been a reason for this depiction.

In the novel, during Ma Chao&#x27;s battles against Cao Cao&#x27;s forces, Han Sui has eight elite officers serving under him. After Cao Cao successfully used a scheme to turn Ma Chao and Han Sui against each other, Ma Chao grew suspicious of Han Sui and attacked him, cutting off his left arm in the process. Han Sui managed to escape and defect to Cao Cao, who accepted his surrender and allowed him to continue serving as a general in Liang Province alongside Xiahou Yuan.

<doc id="459448" wikidata="Q2704850" url="?curid=459448" title="Castell Coch">
<text>; ) is a 19th-century Gothic Revival castle built above the village of Tongwynlais in Wales. The first castle on the site was built by the Normans after 1081 to protect the newly conquered town of Cardiff and control the route along the River Taff. Abandoned shortly afterwards, the castle&#x27;s earth motte was reused by Gilbert de Clare as the basis for a new stone fortification, which he built between 1267 and 1277 to control his freshly annexed Welsh lands. This castle may have been destroyed in the native Welsh rebellion of 1314. In 1760, the castle ruins were acquired by John Stuart, 3rd Earl of Bute, as part of a marriage settlement that brought the family vast estates in South Wales.

John Crichton-Stuart, 3rd Marquess of Bute, inherited the castle in 1848. One of Britain&#x27;s wealthiest men, with interests in architecture and antiquarian studies, he employed the architect William Burges to rebuild the castle, &quot;as a country residence for occasional occupation in the summer&quot;, using the medieval remains as a basis for the design. Burges rebuilt the outside of the castle between 1875 and 1879, before turning to the interior; he died in 1881 and the work was finished by Burges&#x27;s remaining team in 1891. Bute reintroduced commercial viticulture into Britain, planting a vineyard just below the castle, and wine production continued until the First World War. He made little use of his new retreat, and in 1950 his grandson, the 5th Marquess of Bute, placed it into the care of the state. It is now controlled by the Welsh heritage agency Cadw.

Castell Coch&#x27;s external features and the High Victorian interiors led the historian David McLees to describe it as &quot;one of the greatest Victorian triumphs of architectural composition&quot;. The exterior, based on 19th-century studies by the antiquarian George Thomas Clark, is relatively authentic in style, although its three stone towers were adapted by Burges to present a dramatic silhouette, closer in design to mainland European castles such as Chillon than native British fortifications. The interiors were elaborately decorated, with specially designed furniture and fittings; the designs include extensive use of symbolism drawing on classical and legendary themes. Joseph Mordaunt Crook wrote that the castle represented &quot;the learned dream world of a great patron and his favourite architect, recreating from a heap of rubble a fairy-tale castle which seems almost to have materialised from the margins of a medieval manuscript&quot;.

The surrounding Castell Coch beech woods contain rare plant species and unusual geological features and are protected as a Site of Special Scientific Interest.

==History==

===11th–14th centuries===

The first castle on the Castell Coch site was probably built after 1081, during the Norman invasion of Wales. It formed one of a string of eight fortifications intended to defend the newly conquered town of Cardiff and control the route along the Taff Gorge, which leads to the town. It took the form of a raised, earth-work motte, about across at the base and on the top, protected by the surrounding steep slopes. The 16th-century historian Rice Merrick claimed that the castle was built by the Welsh lord Ifor ap Meurig, but there are no records of this phase of the castle&#x27;s history and modern historians doubt this account. The first castle was probably abandoned after 1093 when the Norman lordship of Glamorgan was created, changing the line of the frontier.

In 1267, Gilbert de Clare, who held the Lordship of Glamorgan, seized the lands around the town of Senghenydd in the north of Glamorgan from their native Welsh ruler. Caerphilly Castle was built to control the new territory and Castell Coch—strategically located between Cardiff and Caerphilly—was reoccupied. A new castle was built in stone around the motte, comprising a shell-wall, a projecting circular tower, a gatehouse and a square hall above an undercroft. The north-west section of the walls was protected by a talus and the sides of the motte were scarped to increase their angle, all producing a small but powerful fortification. Further work followed between 1268 and 1277, which added two large towers, a turning-bridge for the gatehouse and further protection to the north-west walls.

On Gilbert&#x27;s death, the castle passed to his widow Joan and around this time it was referred to as , Latin for &quot;the red castle&quot;, probably after the colour of the red sandstone defences. Gilbert&#x27;s son, also named Gilbert, inherited the property in 1307. He died at the Battle of Bannockburn in 1314, triggering an uprising of the native Welsh in the region. Castell Coch was probably destroyed by the rebels in July 1314, and possibly slighted to put it beyond any further use; it was not rebuilt and the site was abandoned.

===15th–19th centuries===

====Bute ownership====

Castell Coch remained derelict; the antiquarian John Leland, visiting around 1536, described it as &quot;all in ruin, no big thing but high&quot;. The artist and illustrator Julius Caesar Ibbetson painted the castle in 1792, depicting substantial remains and a prominent tower, with a lime kiln in operation alongside the fortification. Stone from the castle may have been used to feed the kilns during this period. A similar view was sketched by an unknown artist in the early 19th century, showing more trees around the ruins; a few years later, Robert Drane recommended the site as a place for picnics and noted its abundance of wild garlic.

The ruins were acquired by the earls of Bute in 1760, when John Stuart, the 3rd Earl and, from 1794, the 1st Marquess, married Lady Charlotte Windsor, heiress of Viscount Windsor, adding her estates in South Wales to his inheritance. John&#x27;s grandson, John Crichton-Stuart, developed the Cardiff Docks in the first half of the 19th century; although the docks were not especially profitable, they opened opportunities for the expansion of the coal industry in the South Wales valleys, making the Bute family extremely wealthy. The 2nd Marquess carried out exploration for iron ore at Castell Coch in 1827 and considered establishing an ironworks there.

The 3rd Marquess of Bute, another John Crichton-Stuart, inherited the castle and the family estates as a child in 1848. On his coming of age, Bute&#x27;s landed estates and industrial inheritance made him one of the wealthiest men in the world. He had a wide range of interests including archaeology, theology, linguistics and history. Interest in medieval architecture increased in Britain during the 19th century, and in 1850 the antiquarian George Thomas Clark surveyed Castell Coch and published his findings, the first major scholarly work about the castle. The ruins were covered in rubble, ivy, brushwood and weeds; the keep had been largely destroyed and the gatehouse was so covered with debris that Clark failed to discover it. Nonetheless, Clark considered the external walls &quot;tolerably perfect&quot; and advised that the castle be conserved, complete with the ivy-covered stonework.

In 1871, Bute asked his chief Cardiff engineer, John McConnochie, to excavate and clear the castle ruins. The report on the investigations was produced by William Burges, an architect with an interest in medieval architecture who had met Bute in 1865. The Marquess subsequently employed him to redevelop Cardiff Castle in the late 1860s, and the two men became close collaborators. Burges&#x27;s lavishly illustrated report, which drew extensively on Clark&#x27;s earlier work, laid out two options: either conserve the ruins or rebuild the castle to create a house for occasional occupation in the summer. On receipt of the report, Bute commissioned Burges to rebuild Castle Coch in a Gothic Revival style.

====Reconstruction====

The reconstruction of Castell Coch was delayed until 1875, because of the demands of work at Cardiff Castle and an unfounded concern by the Marquess&#x27;s trustees that he was facing bankruptcy. On commencement, the Kitchen Tower, Hall Block and shell wall were rebuilt first, followed by the Well Tower and the Gatehouse, and the Keep Tower last. Burges&#x27;s drawings for the proposed rebuilding survive at the Bute seat of Mount Stuart. The drawings were supplemented by a large number of wooden and plaster models, from smaller pieces to full-size models of furniture.

The bulk of the external work was complete by the end of 1879. The result closely followed Burges&#x27;s original plans, with the exception of an additional watch tower intended to resemble a minaret, and some defensive timber hoardings, both of which were not undertaken. Clark continued to advise Burges on historical aspects of the reconstruction and the architect tested the details of proposed features, such as the drawbridge and portcullis, against surviving designs at other British castles.

Burges&#x27;s team of craftsmen at Castell Coch included many who had worked with him at Cardiff Castle and elsewhere. John Chapple, his office manager, designed most of the furnishings and furniture, and William Frame acted as clerk of works. Horatio Lonsdale was Burges&#x27;s chief artist, painting extensive murals at the castle. His main sculptor was Thomas Nicholls, together with another long-time collaborator, the Italian sculptor Ceccardo Fucigna.

Stimulated by antiquarian writings about British viticulture, Bute decided to reintroduce commercial grape vines into Britain in 1873. He sent his gardener Andrew Pettigrew to France for training and planted a vineyard just beneath the castle in 1875. The first harvests were poor and the initial harvest in 1877 produced only 240 bottles. &quot;Punch&quot; magazine claimed that any wine produced would be so unpleasant that &quot;it would take four men to drink it—two to hold the victim and one to pour the wine down his throat&quot;. By 1887, the output was 3,000 bottles of sweet white wine of reasonable quality. Bute persevered, commercial success followed and 40 hogsheads of wine, including a red varietal using Gamay grapes, were produced annually by 1894 to positive reviews.

Burges died in 1881 after catching a severe chill during a site visit to the castle. His brother-in-law, the architect Richard Pullan, took over the commission and delegated most of the work to Frame, who directed the work on the interior until its completion in 1891. Bute and his wife Gwendolen were consulted over the details of the interior decoration; replica family portraits based on those at Cardiff were commissioned to hang on the walls. Clark approved of the result, commenting in 1884 that the restoration was in &quot;excellent taste&quot;. An oratory originally built on the roof of the Well Tower was removed before 1891 but in other respects the completed castle was left unaltered.

The castle was not greatly used; the Marquess rarely visited after its completion. The property had probably only been intended for limited, informal use, for example as a retreat following picnics. Although it had reception rooms suitable for large gatherings, it had only three bedrooms and was too far from Cardiff for casual visits. The restored castle initially received little interest from the architectural community, possibly because the total rebuilding of the castle ran counter to the increasingly popular late-Victorian philosophy of conserving older buildings and monuments.

===20th–21st centuries===

Bute died in 1900 and his widow, the Marchioness, was given a life interest in Castell Coch; during her mourning, she and her daughter, Lady Margaret Crichton-Stuart, occupied the castle and made occasional visits thereafter. Production in the castle vineyards ceased during the First World War due to the shortages of the sugar needed for the fermentation process, and in 1920 the vineyards were uprooted. John, the 4th Marquess, acquired the castle in 1932 but made little use of it. He also began to reduce the family&#x27;s investments in South Wales. The coal trade had declined after 1918 and industry had suffered during the depression of the 1920s; by 1938, the great majority of the family interests, including the coal mines and docks, had been sold off or nationalised.

The 5th Marquess of Bute, another John, succeeded in 1947 and, in 1950, he placed the castle in the care of the Ministry of Works. The donation was accepted only with reluctance; in the post-war period Burges&#x27;s reputation, and that of Victorian architecture more generally, were at their lowest ebb, and the castle was considered a &quot;hideous Victorian joke&quot;. The Marquess also disposed of Cardiff Castle, which he gave to the city, removing the family portraits from the castle before doing so. In turn, the paintings in Castell Coch were removed by the ministry and sent to Cardiff, the National Museum of Wales providing alternatives from their collection for Castell Coch. Many of the original furnishings, removed in 1950, have been recovered in the later 20th and 21st centuries and returned to their original locations in the castle. Two stained-glass panels from the demolished chapel, lost since 1901, were rediscovered at an auction in 2010 and were bought by Cadw for £125,000 in 2011. Academic interest in the property grew, with publications in the 1950s and 1960s exploring its artistic and architectural value. Since 1984, the property has been administered by Cadw, an agency of the Welsh Government, and is open to the public; it typically receives between 50,000 and 75,000 visits per year; this number dropped during the COVID-19 pandemic, and 23,095 people visited in 2021. The Drawing Room is available for wedding ceremonies.

The castle has been used as a location for films and television programmes, including &quot;The Black Knight&quot; (1954), &quot;Sword of the Valiant&quot; (1984), &quot;The Worst Witch&quot; (1998), &quot;Wolf Hall&quot; (2015) and several episodes of &quot;Doctor Who&quot;.

The castle&#x27;s exposed position causes it to suffer from penetrating damp and periodic restoration has been necessary. The stone tiles on the roof were replaced by slate in 1972, a programme of repair was carried out on the Keep in 2007 and interior conservation work was undertaken in 2011 to address problems in Lady Bute&#x27;s Bedroom, where damp had begun to damage the finishings. In 2017 a systematic restoration of the three towers was begun, to secure the exteriors and protect the interiors which had continued to deteriorate due to water ingress. Work on the Keep tower was completed in 2019, a two-year programme to repair the Well tower began in 2024, and Cadw has started planning for a similar restoration of the Kitchen tower. The castle will remain open to visitors throughout the restoration work.

==Architecture==

===Overview===
Castell Coch occupies a stretch of woodland on the slopes above the village of Tongwynlais and the River Taff, about north-west of the centre of Cardiff. The architecture is High Victorian Gothic Revival in style, influenced by contemporary 19th-century French restorations. Its design combines the surviving elements of the medieval castle with 19th-century additions to produce a building which the historian Charles Kightly considered &quot;the crowning glory of the Gothic Revival&quot; in Britain. John B. Hiling, in his study &quot;The Architecture of Wales: From the first to the twenty-first century&quot;, suggests that Castell Coch, and Cardiff Castle, are &quot;the most remarkable domestic buildings to be resurrected in the nineteenth century&quot;. The castle is protected under UK law as a Grade I listed building due to its exceptional architectural and historical interest.

===Exterior===

The castle comprises three circular towers—the Keep, the Kitchen Tower and the Well Tower—along with the Hall Block, the Gatehouse and a shell wall; the buildings almost entirely encase the original motte in stone. The older parts of the castle are constructed from crudely laid red sandstone rubble and grey limestone, the 19th-century additions in more precisely cut red Pennant sandstone. A ditch is cut out of the rock in front of the Gatehouse and leads to an eastern approach road. The castle is surrounded by woodland and the 19th-century vineyards below it have been converted into a golf course. In 1850, George Clark recorded an &quot;outer court&quot; of which nothing remains; this may, in fact, have been the traces of the earlier lime kiln operations around the site.

The Gatehouse is reached across a wooden bridge, incorporating a drawbridge. Burges intended the bridge to copy those of medieval castles, which he believed were designed to be easily set on fire in the event of attack. The Gatehouse was fitted with a wooden defensive bretèche and, above the entrance, Burges sited a portcullis and a glazed statue of the Madonna and Child sculpted by Ceccardo Fucigna.

The Keep is in diameter with a square, spurred base; in the 13th century there would have been an adjacent turret, on the south-west side, containing latrines, but few traces remain. There is no evidence that the tower that Burges termed a keep would have fulfilled this function in the medieval period and he appears to have chosen the name because of his initial decision to locate the bedrooms of Lord and Lady Bute in the rebuilt tower. The Kitchen Tower is also across and rests on a square, spurred base. It was originally two storeys high and contained the medieval kitchen; Burges raised its height and gave it a conical roof and chimneys. The walls of these two towers are around thick at the base, thinning to at the top. The Well Tower at in diameter is slightly narrower than the Keep or Kitchen Tower, with a well in its lowest chamber sunk into the ground. The Well Tower lacks the spurs of the other two towers and has a flat rather than curved back, facing onto the courtyard, similar to some of the towers built at Caerphilly by the de Clares.

The towers contribute to what the architectural writer Charles Handley-Read considered the castle&#x27;s &quot;sculptural and dramatic exterior&quot;. Almost equal in diameter, but of differing conical roof designs and heights, and topped with copper-gilt weather vanes, they combine to produce a romantic appearance, which Matthew Williams described as bringing &quot;a Wagnerian to the Taff Valley&quot;.

The design of the towers was influenced by the work of the contemporary French architect Eugène Viollet-le-Duc, including his restorations of Carcassonne and the châteaus of Aigle and Chillon. While the exterior of Castell Coch is relatively true to English 13th-century medieval design—albeit heavily influenced by the Gothic Revival movement—the inclusion of the conical roofs, which more closely resemble those of fortifications in France or Switzerland than of Britain, is historically inaccurate. Although he mounted a historical defence (see box), Burges chose the roofs mainly for architectural effect, arguing that they appeared &quot;more picturesque&quot;, and to provide additional room for accommodation in the castle.

The three towers lead into a small oval courtyard that sits on the top of the motte, about across lengthways. Cantilevered galleries and wall-walks run around the inside of the courtyard with neat and orderly woodwork; the historian Peter Floud critiqued it as &quot;perhaps too much like the backcloth for an historical pageant&quot;. Burges reconstructed the shell wall that runs along the north-west side of the courtyard thick, complete with arrow holes and a battlement.

===Interior===
The Keep, the Well Tower and the Kitchen Tower incorporate a series of apartments, of which the main sequence, the Castellan&#x27;s Rooms, lies within the Keep. The Hall, the Drawing Room, Lord Bute&#x27;s Bedroom and Lady Bute&#x27;s Bedroom form a suite of rooms that exemplify the High Victorian Gothic style of 19th-century Britain. Unlike the exterior of the castle, which deliberately imitated the architecture of the 13th century, the interior was purely High Victorian in style. On Burges&#x27;s decoration of Cardiff Castle and Castell Coch, Handley-Read wrote: &quot;I have yet to see any High Victorian interiors from the hand, very largely, of one designer, to equal either in homogeneity or completeness, in quality of execution or originality of conception the best of the interiors of the Welsh castles. For sheer power of intoxication, Burges stand[s] unrivalled.&quot;

====The Banqueting Hall====

The Banqueting Hall is across with an ceiling, and occupies the whole of the first floor of the Hall Block. Burges persuaded Bute and the antiquarian George Clark that the medieval hall would have stood on the first floor. His original plan saw access via one of two equally circuitous routes through the Well Tower or around the entire internal gallery to enter the hall through a passage next to the Drawing Room. Neither approach was acceptable to Bute and at a late stage, around 1878/79, the present entrance was created by expanding a window at the head of the internal gallery.

The hall is austere; the architectural historian John Newman critiqued its decoration as &quot;dilute&quot; and &quot;unfocused&quot;, Crook as &quot;anaemic&quot;. It features stencilled ceilings and murals which resemble medieval manuscripts. The murals were designed by Horatio Lonsdale and executed by Campbell, Smith &amp; Company. The furniture is by John Chapple, made in Lord Bute&#x27;s workshops at Cardiff. The tapered chimney of the room, modelled on 15th-century French equivalents, contains a statue carved by Thomas Nicholls. Although the architectural historian Mark Girouard suggested that the statue depicts the Hebrew King David, most historians believe that it shows Lucius of Britain, according to legend the founder of the diocese of Llandaff in nearby Cardiff.

====The Drawing Room====

The octagonal Drawing Room occupies the first and second floors of the Keep. The ceiling is supported by vaulted stone ribs modelled on Viollet-Le-Duc&#x27;s work at Château de Coucy and the lower and upper halves of the room are divided by a minstrels&#x27; gallery. The original plans for the space involved two chambers, one on each floor, and the new design was adopted only in 1879, Burges noting at the time that he intended to &quot;indulge in a little more ornament&quot; than elsewhere in the castle.

The decoration of the room focuses on what Newman described as the &quot;intertwined themes [of] the fecundity of nature and the fragility of life&quot;. A fireplace by Thomas Nicholls features the Three Fates, the trio of Greek goddesses who are depicted spinning, measuring and cutting the thread of life. The ceiling&#x27;s vaulting is carved with butterflies, reaching up to a golden sunburst at the apex of the room, while plumed birds fly up into a starry sky in the intervening sections. Around the room, 58 panels, each depicting one or more unique plants, are surmounted by a mural showing animals from twenty-four of Aesop&#x27;s Fables. The plants are wild flowers from the Mediterranean, where Lord Bute spent his winter months each year. Carved birds, lizards and other wildlife decorate the doorways.

The historian Terry Measham wrote that the Drawing Room and Lady Bute&#x27;s Bedroom, &quot;so powerful in their effect, are the two most important interiors in the castle&quot;. The architectural writer Andrew Lilwall-Smith considered the Drawing Room to be &quot;Burges&#x27;s &quot;, encapsulating his &quot;romantic vision of the Middle Ages&quot;. The decoration of the ceiling, which was carried out while Burges was alive, differs in tone from the treatment of the murals, and the decoration of Lady Bute&#x27;s Bedroom, which were both completed, under the direction of William Frame and Horatio Lonsdale respectively, after Burges&#x27;s death. Burges&#x27;s work is distinctively High Gothic in style, while the later efforts are more influenced by the softer colours and character of the Aesthetic movement, which had grown in popularity by the 1880s.

====Lord Bute&#x27;s Bedroom====
In comparison to other rooms within the castle, Lord Bute&#x27;s Bedroom, sited above the Winch Room, is relatively small and simple. The original plan had Bute&#x27;s personal accommodation in the Keep but the expansion of the Drawing Room to a double-height room in 1879 required a late change of plan. The bedroom contains an ornately carved fireplace. Doors lead off the room to an internal balcony overlooking the courtyard and to the bretèche over the gate arch. The furniture is mainly by Chapple and post-dates Burges, although the washstand and dressing table are pared-down versions of two pieces – the Narcissus Washstand and the Crocker Dressing Table – that Burges made for his own home in London, The Tower House.

This bedroom is also less richly ornamented than many in the castle, making extensive use of plain, stencilled geometrical patterns on the walls. Crook suggested this provided some &quot;spartan&quot; relief before the culmination of the castle in Lady Bute&#x27;s Bedroom but Floud considered the result &quot;thin&quot; and drab in comparison with the more richly decorated chambers. The bedroom would have been impractical for regular use, lacking wardrobes and other storage.

====Lady Bute&#x27;s Bedroom====
Lady Bute&#x27;s Bedroom comprises the upper two floors of the Keep, with a coffered, double-dome ceiling that rises up into the tower&#x27;s conical roof. The room was completed after Burges&#x27;s death and, although he had created an outline model for the room&#x27;s structure, which survives, he did not undertake detailed plans for its decoration. His team attempted to fulfil his vision for the room—&quot;would Mr Burges have done it?&quot; William Frame asked Nicholls in a letter of 1887—but the interior decoration was the work of Lonsdale between 1887 and 1888, with considerable involvement from Bute and his wife.

The room is circular, with the window embrasures forming a sequence of arches around the outside. It is richly decorated, with love as the theme, displaying carved monkeys, pomegranates and grapevines on the ceiling, and nesting birds topping the pillars. Lord Bute thought the monkeys inappropriately &quot;lascivious&quot;. Above the fireplace is a winged statue of Psyche, the Greek goddess of the soul, carrying a heart-shaped shield which displays the arms of the Bute family. The washbasin, designed by John Chapple, has a dragon tap, and cisterns for hot and cold water covered with crenellated towers. The Marchioness&#x27;s scarlet and gold bed is the most notable piece of furniture in the room, modelled on a medieval original drawn by Viollet-le-Duc. Crook described the bed as being &quot;medieval to the point of acute discomfort&quot;.

The bedroom is Moorish in style, a popular inspiration in mid-Victorian interior design, and echoes earlier work by Burges in the Arab Room at Cardiff Castle and in the chancel at St Mary&#x27;s Church at Studley Royal in Yorkshire. Lilwall-Smith likened the chamber, with its &quot;Moorish-looking dome, maroon-and-gold painted furniture and large, low bed decorated with glass crystal orbs&quot;, to a scene from the &quot;Arabian Nights&quot;. Peter Floud criticised the eclectic nature of this Moorish theme and contrasted it unfavourably with the more consistent style Burges applied to the Arab Room, suggesting that it gave the bedroom an overly theatrical, even pantomime-like, character. The historian Matthew Williams considered that Lonsdale&#x27;s efforts lack the imagination and flair that Burges himself might have brought to the room.

====Other rooms====
The Windlass Room, or Winch Room, is in the Gatehouse, entered from the Drawing Room. It contains a working mechanism for operating the drawbridge and the portcullis. The equipment was originally intended for the second floor, which Burges considered the most historically authentic location. When later design modifications led him to move Lord Bute&#x27;s Bedroom into that space, the equipment was simplified and placed on the first floor. The Windlass Room includes murder holes, which Burges thought would have enabled medieval inhabitants of the castle to pour boiling water and oil on attackers.

An oratory or chapel, originally fitted to the roof of the Well Tower but removed before 1891, was decorated with twenty stained-glass windows. Ten of these windows are displayed at Cardiff Castle, while the other ten are displayed on site; two missing windows having been returned to the castle in 2011. Pullan, in a paper read to the annual meeting of the Royal Institute of British Architects on 17 April 1882, just before the first anniversary of Burges&#x27;s death, included a description of the chapel; &quot;of wooden construction, partly projecting on immense wooden brackets towards the courtyard, and forming a most picturesque object&quot;. Other rooms in the castle include Lady Margaret Bute&#x27;s Bedroom, the servants&#x27; hall and the kitchen.

===Interior design details===
==Landscape – Site of Special Scientific Interest==

The woods surrounding the castle, known as the Taff Gorge complex, are among the most westerly natural beech woodlands in the British Isles. They contain dog&#x27;s mercury, ramsons, sanicles, bird&#x27;s-nest orchid, greater butterfly-orchid and yellow bird&#x27;s nest plants. The area has unusual rock outcrops, which show the point where Devonian Old Red Sandstone and Carboniferous Limestone beds meet; the Castell Coch Quarry is in the vicinity. The area is protected as the Castell Coch Woodlands and Road Section Site of Special Scientific Interest.

The woods above the castle are accessible to the public and are used for walking, mountain biking and horse riding. To the southeast of the castle, a nine-hole golf course occupies the site of the former vineyard.

<doc id="459453" wikidata="Q5153583" url="?curid=459453" title="Common operator notation">
<text>In programming languages, scientific calculators and similar common operator notation or operator grammar is a way to define and analyse mathematical and other formal expressions. In this model a linear sequence of tokens are divided into two classes: operators and operands.

Operands are objects upon which the operators operate. These include literal numbers and other constants as well as identifiers (names) which may represent anything from simple scalar variables to complex aggregated structures and objects, depending on the complexity and capability of the language at hand as well as usage context. One special type of operand is the parenthesis group. An expression enclosed in parentheses is typically recursively evaluated to be treated as a single operand on the next evaluation level.

Each operator is given a position, precedence, and an associativity. The operator precedence is a number (from high to low or vice versa) that defines which operator takes an operand that is surrounded by two operators of different precedence (or priority). Multiplication normally has higher precedence than addition, for example, so 3+4×5 = 3+(4×5) ≠ (3+4)×5.

In terms of operator position, an operator may be prefix, postfix, or infix. A prefix operator immediately precedes its operand, as in −x. A postfix operator immediately succeeds its operand, as in x! for instance. An infix operator is positioned in between a left and a right operand, as in x+y. Some languages, most notably the C-syntax family, stretches this conventional terminology and speaks also of &quot;ternary&quot; infix operators (a?b:c). Theoretically it would even be possible (but not necessarily practical) to define parenthesization as a unary bifix operation.

== Operator associativity ==

Operator associativity determines what happens when an operand is surrounded by operators of the same precedence, as in 1-2-3: An operator can be left-associative, right-associative, or non-associative. Left-associative operators are applied to operands in left-to-right order while right-associative operators are the other way round. The basic arithmetic operators are normally all left-associative, which means that 1-2-3 = (1-2)-3 ≠ 1-(2-3), for instance. This does not hold true for higher operators. For example, exponentiation is normally right-associative in mathematics, but is implemented as left-associative in some computer applications like Excel. In programming languages where assignment is implemented as an operator, that operator is often right-associative. If so, a statement like would be equivalent to , which means that the value of c is copied to b which is then copied to a. An operator which is non-associative cannot compete for operands with operators of equal precedence. In Prolog for example, the infix operator is non-associative, so constructs such as are syntax errors. 
Unary prefix operators such as − (negation) or sin (trigonometric function) are typically associative prefix operators. When more than one associative prefix or postfix operator of equal precedence precedes or succeeds an operand, the operators closest to the operand goes first. So −sin x = −(sin x), and sin -x = sin(-x).

Mathematically oriented languages (such as on scientific calculators) sometimes allow implicit multiplication with higher priority than prefix operators (such as sin), so that sin 2x+1 = (sin(2x))+1, for instance.

However, prefix (and postfix) operators do not &quot;necessarily&quot; have higher precedence than all infix operators. Some (hypothetical) programming language may well have an operator called sin with a precedence lower than × but higher than + for instance. In such a language, sin 2·x+1 = sin(2·x)+1 would be true, instead of (sin 2)·x+1, as would normally be the case.

The rules for expression evaluation are usually three-fold:
# Treat any sub-expression in parentheses as a single recursively-evaluated operand (there may be different kinds of parentheses though, with different semantics).
# Bind operands to operators of higher precedence before those of lower precedence.
# For equal precedence, bind operands to operators according to the associativity of the operators.

Some more examples:


==Generalizations of Common Operator Notation==
The use of operator precedence classes and associativities is just one way. However, it is not the most general way: this model cannot give an operator more precedence when competing with &#x27;−&#x27; than it can when competing with &#x27;+&#x27;, while still giving &#x27;+&#x27; and &#x27;−&#x27; equivalent precedences and associativities. A generalized version of this model (in which each operator can be given independent left and right precedences) can be found at .

<doc id="459456" wikidata="Q237599" url="?curid=459456" title="House of Borgia">
<text>The House of Borgia ( ; ; Spanish and ; ) was a Spanish noble family, which rose to prominence during the Italian Renaissance. They were from Xàtiva, Kingdom of Valencia, the surname being a toponymic from the town of Borja, then in the Crown of Aragon, in Spain.

The Borgias became prominent in ecclesiastical and political affairs in the 15th and 16th centuries, producing two popes: Alfons de Borja, who ruled as Pope Callixtus III during 1455–1458, and Rodrigo Lanzol Borgia, as Pope Alexander VI, during 1492–1503.

Especially during the reign of Alexander VI, they were suspected of many crimes, including adultery, incest, simony, theft, bribery, and murder (especially murder by arsenic poisoning). Because of their grasping for power, they made enemies of the Medici, the Sforza, and the Dominican friar Girolamo Savonarola, among others. They were also patrons of the arts who contributed to the development of Renaissance art.

The Borgia family stands out in history as being infamously steeped in sin and immorality, yet there is evidence to suggest that this one-dimensional characterization is a result of undeserved contemporary critiques.

== History ==

=== Early history ===
The Borja was a noble house with origin in the town of Borja (Zaragoza) in the then Crown of Aragon. During this time, there were numerous unsubstantiated claims that the family was of originally Jewish descent, and were pretending to be pious Roman Catholics. These underground rumours were propagated by, among others, Giuliano della Rovere, and the family was frequently described as marranos by political opponents. The rumours have persisted in popular culture for centuries, listed in the &quot;Semi-Gotha&quot; of 1912. The family themselves propagated a spurious genealogical descent from a 12th-century claimant to the crown of the Kingdom of Aragon, Pedro de Atarés, Lord of Borja, who actually died childless.

=== Alfons ===

Alfons de Borja (1378–1458) was born to Francina Llançol and Domingo de Borja in La Torreta, Canals, which was then situated in the Kingdom of Valencia.

Alfons de Borja was a professor of law at the University of Lleida, then a diplomat for the Kings of Aragon before becoming a cardinal. At an advanced age, he was elected Pope Callixtus III in 1455 as a compromise candidate and reigned as Pope for just three years, until his death in 1458.

=== Rodrigo ===

Rodrigo Borgia (1431–1503) was born in Xàtiva, also in the Kingdom of Valencia, to Isabel de Borja i Cavanilles and Jofré Llançol i Escrivà. He studied law at Bologna and was appointed as cardinal by his uncle, Alfons Borgia, Pope Callixtus III. He was elected Pope in 1492, taking the regnal name Alexander VI. While a cardinal, he maintained a long-term illicit relationship with Vannozza dei Cattanei, with whom he had four children: Giovanni; Cesare; Lucrezia; and Gioffre. Rodrigo also had children by other women, including one daughter with his mistress, Giulia Farnese.

As Alexander VI, Rodrigo was recognized as a skilled politician and diplomat. However, he was widely criticized during his reign for his over-spending, sale of Church offices, lasciviousness, and nepotism. As Pope, he sought to acquire more personal and papal power and wealth, often ennobling and enriching the Borgia family directly. He appointed his son, Giovanni, as captain-general of the papal army, his foremost military representative, and established another son, Cesare, as a cardinal. Alexander used the marriages of his children to build alliances with powerful families in Italy and Spain. At the time, the Sforza family, which comprised the Milanese faction, was one of the most powerful in Europe, so Alexander united the two families by marrying Lucrezia to Giovanni Sforza. He also married Gioffre, his youngest son from Vannozza, to Sancha of Aragon of the Crown of Aragon and Naples. He established a second familial link to the Spanish royal house through Giovanni&#x27;s marriage during what was a period of on-again/off-again conflict between France and Spain over the Kingdom of Naples.

It is reported that under Alexander VI&#x27;s rule the Borgias hosted orgies in the Vatican Palace. The &quot;Banquet of Chestnuts&quot; is considered one of the most disreputable balls of this kind. Johann Burchard reports that fifty courtesans were in attendance for the entertainment of the banquet guests. It is alleged not only was the Pope present, but also two of his children, Lucrezia and Cesare. Other researchers however, such as Monsignor Peter de Roo (1839–1926), have rejected the rumors of the &quot;fifty courtesans&quot; as being at odds with Alexander VI&#x27;s essentially decent but much maligned character.

Pope Alexander VI died in Rome in 1503 after contracting a disease, generally believed to have been malaria. Two of Alexander&#x27;s successors, Sixtus V and Urban VIII, described him as one of the most outstanding popes since St. Peter.

=== Cesare ===

Cesare was Rodrigo Borgia&#x27;s second son with Vannozza dei Cattanei. Cesare&#x27;s education was precisely planned by his father: he was educated by tutors in Rome until his 12th birthday. He grew up to become a charming man skilled at war and politics. He studied law and the humanities at the University of Perugia, then went to the University of Pisa to study theology. As soon as he graduated from the university, his father made him a cardinal.

Cesare was suspected of murdering his brother Giovanni, but there is no clear evidence to confirm this. However, Giovanni&#x27;s death cleared the path for Cesare to become a layman and gain the honors his brother received from their father, Pope Alexander VI. Although Cesare had been a cardinal, he left the holy orders to gain power and take over the position Giovanni once held: a condottiero. He was finally married to French princess Charlotte d&#x27;Albret.

After Alexander&#x27;s death in 1503, Cesare affected the choice of the next Pope. He needed a candidate who would not threaten his plans to create his own principality in Central Italy. Cesare&#x27;s candidate (Pius III) did become Pope, but he died a month after the selection. Cesare was then forced to support Giuliano della Rovere. The cardinal promised Cesare that he could keep all of his titles and honors. Later, della Rovere betrayed him and became his fiercest enemy.

Cesare died in 1507, at Viana Castle in Navarre, Spain, while besieging the rebellious army of Count de Lerín. The castle was held by Louis de Beaumont at the time it was besieged by Cesare Borgia and King John&#x27;s army of 10,000 men in 1507. In order to attempt to breach the extremely strong, natural fortification of the castle, Cesare counted on a desperate surprise attack. He was killed during the battle, in which his army failed to take the castle.

=== Lucrezia ===

Lucrezia was born in Subiaco, Italy to Cardinal Rodrigo Borgia and Roman mistress Vannozza dei Catanei. Before the age of 13, she was engaged to two Spanish princes. After her father became Pope she was married to Giovanni Sforza in 1493 at the age of 13. It was a typical political marriage to improve Alexander&#x27;s power; however, when Pope Alexander VI no longer needed the Sforzas, the marriage was annulled in 1497 on the dubious grounds that it had never been consummated.

Shortly afterwards she was involved in a scandal involving her alleged relationship with Pedro Calderón, a Spaniard generally known as Perotto. His body was found in the Tiber on February 14, 1498, along with the body of one of Lucrezia&#x27;s ladies. It is likely that Cesare had them killed as an affair would have damaged the negotiations being conducted for another marriage. During this time rumors were also spread suggesting that a child born at this time, Giovanni Borgia, also known as the &quot;Infans Romanus&quot; (child of Rome) was Lucrezia&#x27;s.

Lucrezia&#x27;s second marriage, to wealthy young Prince Alfonso of Aragon, allowed the Borgias to form an alliance with another powerful family. However, this relationship did not last long either. Cesare wished to strengthen his relations with France and completely break with the Kingdom of Naples. As Alfonso&#x27;s father was the ruler of the Kingdom of Naples, the young husband was in great danger. Although the first attempt at murder did not succeed, Alfonso was eventually strangled in his own quarters.

Lucrezia&#x27;s third and final husband was Alfonso I d&#x27;Este, Duke of Ferrara. After her father died in 1503, she lived a life of freedom in Ferrara with her husband and children. Her pregnancies were difficult and she lost several babies after birth. She died in 1519, 10 days after the birth and death of her last child, Isabella Maria. She was buried in a tomb with Isabella and Alfonso.
Lucrezia was rumored to be a notorious poisoner and she became famous for her skill at political intrigue. However, some recent revisionists have looked at her in a more sympathetic light, claiming her to be a victim of her family&#x27;s deceptions.

The Borgias were infamous in their time, and have inspired numerous references in popular culture. They include novels, such as &quot;City of God: A Novel of the Borgias&quot; (1979) by Cecelia Holland, &quot;The Family&quot; (2001) by Mario Puzo, and &quot;Summer of Night&quot; (1991) by Dan Simmons, plays, operas, comics, films like &quot;The Borgia&quot; (2006), television series like &quot;Borgia&quot; (2011) and &quot;The Borgias&quot; (2011) on Showtime, and video games the likes of &quot;Assassin&#x27;s Creed: Brotherhood&quot; (2010) by Ubisoft.

In series 4 of the sketch comedy TV show &quot;Horrible Histories&quot;, a song called &quot;the Borgia Family&quot; was featured in the section &#x27;Radical Renaissance&#x27;. The song is a parody of the theme song to the Addams Family.

The family lore and artifacts are essential to the plot of the 1959 Disney film &quot;The Shaggy Dog&quot;.

UsefulCharts on YouTube featured the Borgia family, discussing the well known and lesser known members of the Borgia family.

<doc id="459459" wikidata="Q559744" url="?curid=459459" title="Lu Su">
<text>Lu Su (172–217), courtesy name Zijing, was a Chinese military general and politician serving under the warlord Sun Quan during the late Eastern Han dynasty. In the year 200, when Sun Quan had just taken over the reins of power, his adviser Zhou Yu recommended Lu Su as a talent to Sun Quan. As one of Sun Quan&#x27;s most important advisers in the warlord&#x27;s early career, Lu Su is best known for making some significant contributions. Firstly, in 200 he drafted a long-term strategy for Sun Quan&#x27;s power bloc to emerge as one of three major contending powers in China – a plan similar to Zhuge Liang&#x27;s Longzhong Plan, which was proposed about seven years later. Secondly, before the Battle of Red Cliffs in late 208, he was the first person to persuade Sun Quan to ally with Liu Bei against Cao Cao. Thirdly, he succeeded Zhou Yu as the frontline commander of Sun Quan&#x27;s forces in 210 after Zhou&#x27;s death and maintained the Sun–Liu alliance. Fourthly, in 215, he represented Sun Quan at the negotiations with Liu Bei&#x27;s general Guan Yu during the Sun–Liu territorial dispute over Jing Province.

==Early life==
Lu Su was from Dongcheng County (), Linhuai Commandery (), which is located southeast of present-day Dingyuan County, Anhui. He lost his father not long after he was born, so he lived with his grandmother. Lu Su was very generous with his family&#x27;s wealth as he used it to help the needy. Wei Zhao&#x27;s &quot;Book of Wu&quot; () described Lu Su as having a stalwart and extraordinary appearance. He had great ambitions since he was young and was very fond of strategy.

Towards the end of the Eastern Han dynasty, when chaos broke out throughout China due to the Yellow Turban Rebellion and Dong Zhuo&#x27;s tyranny, Lu Su sold his family&#x27;s lands and properties and used the money to help the poor. He also spent his time associating with other reputable and talented persons. He was well-loved by his fellow townsfolk.

The &quot;Book of Wu&quot; gave another account of Lu Su&#x27;s life during that chaotic period. Apart from practising sword-fighting, horse-riding and archery, he also hired a group of young men as his retainers, and provided them with clothing and food. They often went to the hills to hunt and practise military arts. The elders of the clan remarked: &quot;We got this wild boy because the Lu clan is in decline!&quot;

==Moving to Jiangdong==
Around 196, when Zhou Yu was nominally serving as the Chief () of Juchao County under the warlord Yuan Shu, he wanted to leave Yuan Shu and travel east to the Jiangdong (or Wu) region to join Sun Ce, who had recently conquered some territories in Jiangdong over the past few years. Along the way, Zhou Yu and his militia, numbering a few hundred men, visited Lu Su and requested for supplies. At the time, Lu Su owned two large granaries, each capable of storing 3,000 &quot;hu&quot; of grain. He pointed at one granary and gave it to Zhou Yu. Realising that Lu Su was no ordinary person, Zhou Yu thanked and befriended him. The third-century historian Chen Shou compared their friendship to that of Gongsun Qiao and Ji Zha () during the Spring and Autumn period. The Chinese idiom &quot;pointing at a granary and presenting it&quot; (), which means to generously provide aid to someone, originated from this anecdote.

When Yuan Shu heard of Lu Su&#x27;s fame, he wanted to recruit him to serve as the Chief of Dongcheng County (東城縣; present-day Suining County, Jiangsu). However, Lu Su refused because he saw that Yuan Shu&#x27;s administration was ill-disciplined and predicted that Yuan Shu would ultimately meet his downfall. He told his followers, &quot;The central government has collapsed. Robbers and bandits are rampant. The areas around the Huai and Si rivers are no longer safe. I heard the lands in Jiangdong are fertile and they have a prosperous population and powerful armed forces. We can take shelter there. Are you willing to accompany me to that paradise and wait until stability is restored in central China?&quot; They unanimously agreed to follow him.

Lu Su led his followers and some civilians southward to Juchao County to join Zhou Yu. He ordered able-bodied young men to guard the rear while the others continued moving forward. The local authorities sent some armed horsemen to stop Lu Su and his followers from leaving. When the riders caught up with them, Lu Su turned back and said, &quot;All of you are capable men, so you should understand what&#x27;s going on. The Empire is now in a state of chaos. While you won&#x27;t be rewarded for your efforts (even if you manage to stop us), you will also not be punished for failing to stop us. Do you really want to force us to fight?&quot; He then placed a shield upright on the ground and fired an arrow at it. The arrow pierced through the shield. The horsemen realised that they could not stop Lu Su so they gave up and left. Lu Su and his followers then crossed the Yangtze River with Zhou Yu and arrived in Jiangdong, where they met Sun Ce, who also saw great potential in Lu Su.

In Jiangdong, Lu Su lived in Qu&#x27;e County (曲阿縣; in present-day Danyang, Jiangsu) for some time before making a short trip back to Dongcheng County later to attend his grandmother&#x27;s funeral.

==Nearly leaving Jiangdong==
Liu Ye, a friend of Lu Su, once wrote a letter to him: &quot;Warlords and heroes have emerged all over the Empire. I believe the time has come for me to put my talents to good use. I am in a rush to fetch my mother but I will be stopping at Dongcheng County for a while. I heard that recently there is one Zheng Bao (鄭寶) who has rallied thousands of followers in Chaohu and gained control over some very fertile lands. Many people in Lujiang Commandery are planning to join him – including myself. As of now, he is still gathering followers. You should act fast and not miss this opportunity.&quot; Lu Su agreed with what Liu Ye told him. After his grandmother&#x27;s funeral, Lu Su returned to Qu&#x27;e County and planned to leave Jiangdong and head north to join Zheng Bao. However, after he found out that Zhou Yu had fetched his mother to Wu Commandery (around present-day Suzhou, Jiangsu), he gave up his plan to leave Jiangdong and headed to Wu Commandery to meet Zhou Yu.

In 200, after Sun Ce was assassinated, his younger brother Sun Quan succeeded him as the warlord controlling the Jiangdong territories. When Lu Su arrived in Wu Commandery, Zhou Yu told him, &quot;In the past, Ma Yuan once told Emperor Guangwu, &#x27;In this era, not only do lords choose their subjects; subjects also choose the lords they wish to serve.&#x27; The new lord [Sun Quan] welcomes and respects persons of virtue and talent. He has recruited many extraordinary people. Besides, I also heard a saying that in the past, philosophers predicted that the successor to the Liu clan&#x27;s empire [the Han dynasty] will rise in the southeast. As you can see, these events are already in motion. This is the time for heroes to rise up and showcase their talents and abilities, and contribute to the construction of a new empire to receive the Mandate of Heaven. Having said this, I don&#x27;t think you need to take Liu Ye&#x27;s words to heart.&quot; Lu Su heeded Zhou Yu&#x27;s advice and remained in Jiangdong.

The historian Chen Shou, who wrote Lu Su&#x27;s biography, believed that Zhou Yu recommended Lu Su to Sun Quan because he knew that his lord needed to widely recruit more of such talents to accomplish his goal of building up his power bloc. Therefore, he could not afford to let Lu Su leave.

==Drafting a plan for Sun Quan==
Sun Quan immediately summoned Lu Su to meet him, and was pleased to see Lu Su. When the other guests were leaving after the meeting, Lu Su also took his leave but Sun Quan called him back. They shared a table and had a private conversation over drinks. Sun Quan asked, &quot;The Han dynasty is in decline and there is turmoil everywhere. I have inherited the work of my father and elder brother, and I intend to make achievements like those of Duke Huan of Qi and Duke Wen of Jin. I am honoured to have your noble patronage. What advice do you have for me?&quot; Lu Su replied: Sun Quan replied, &quot;Now, I am doing my best to support the Han dynasty. What you said can&#x27;t be achieved.&quot;

Zhang Zhao, a senior adviser to Sun Quan, felt that Lu Su was not humble enough so he often spoke ill of Lu Su in front of their lord. Pointing out that Lu Su was too young and neglectful, Zhang Zhao advised Sun Quan to refrain from entrusting Lu Su with important responsibilities. However, Sun Quan ignored Zhang Zhao and continued to treat Lu Su respectfully and regard him highly. He gave new clothes and curtains to Lu Su&#x27;s mother and restored Lu Su&#x27;s family to their prior status as a wealthy family.

==Formation of the Sun–Liu alliance==
When Liu Biao died in 208, his younger son Liu Cong succeeded him as the Governor of Jing Province (covering present-day Hubei and Hunan). Upon receiving news of Liu Biao&#x27;s death, Lu Su told Sun Quan, Sun Quan then sent Lu Su as his representative to Jing Province.

When Lu Su reached Xiakou (夏口; present-day Hankou, Hubei), he heard that Cao Cao and his forces were advancing towards Jing Province so he travelled day and night in the hope of reaching Xiangyang (Jing Province&#x27;s capital) in the shortest time possible. When he arrived at Nan Commandery (南郡; around present-day Jingzhou, Hubei), he received news that Liu Cong had already surrendered to Cao Cao, and that Jing Province was now under Cao Cao&#x27;s control. At the same time, Liu Bei had been defeated at the Battle of Changban and was trying to cross the Yangtze and head further south. Lu Su met Liu Bei at Changban (長阪; in present-day Dangyang, Hubei), where he conveyed Sun Quan&#x27;s intentions to Liu Bei and pointed out that Jiangdong was very stable. Liu Bei was delighted. Lu Su also met and befriended Liu Bei&#x27;s adviser Zhuge Liang; he told Zhuge Liang that he was a friend of Zhuge Jin, Zhuge Liang&#x27;s elder brother. Liu Bei moved to Xiakou, where he instructed Zhuge Liang to follow Lu Su to meet Sun Quan and discuss the formation of a Sun–Liu alliance against Cao Cao.

===Contradiction===
Pei Songzhi, who annotated Lu Su&#x27;s biography, argued that Lu Su was actually the first person to propose forming a Sun–Liu alliance against Cao Cao. When Lu Su told Zhuge Liang that he was Zhuge Jin&#x27;s friend, Zhuge Liang would probably have already heard of Lu Su but had yet to meet him in person. Pei Songzhi pointed out that Zhuge Liang&#x27;s biography in the &quot;Shu Shu&quot; (蜀書; &quot;Book of Shu&quot;) recorded: &quot;Zhuge Liang persuaded Sun Quan with his argument on forming an alliance. Sun Quan was very pleased.&quot; Going by the &quot;Shu Shu&quot; account, the first person who suggested the Sun–Liu alliance should be Zhuge Liang instead of Lu Su. Pei Songzhi commented that the historians in Eastern Wu and Shu Han gave conflicting accounts on who was the first person who conceived the idea of the Sun–Liu alliance because they wanted their respective states to claim that credit. Pei Songzhi also remarked that this was one of the flaws in the &quot;Sanguozhi&quot; because the author Chen Shou wrote both Lu Su and Zhuge Liang&#x27;s biographies but the two biographies contradict each other on this point.

==Urging Sun Quan to resist Cao Cao==
In late 208, when Sun Quan received news that Cao Cao was planning to lead his forces across the Yangtze to invade Jiangdong, he discussed with his subjects on how to deal with Cao Cao. Everyone present at the meeting advised Sun Quan to surrender and welcome Cao Cao; only Lu Su remained silent. When Sun Quan left the meeting for a change of clothes, Lu Su hurriedly left his seat and followed his lord. Sun Quan sensed that Lu Su had something to say so he held Lu Su&#x27;s hand and asked him, &quot;What do you want to tell me?&quot; Lu Su replied, Sun Quan sighed, &quot;I am very disappointed with those gentlemen. Your thoughts are exactly the same as mine. That&#x27;s why I say you are Heaven&#x27;s gift to me.&quot;

===Alternative accounts===
The &quot;Wei Shu&quot; (魏書; &quot;Book of Wei&quot;) and the &quot;Jiuzhou Chunqiu&quot; () gave different accounts on how Lu Su urged Sun Quan to go to war with Cao Cao. They recorded that Lu Su attempted to use reverse psychology to persuade Sun Quan by saying, &quot;Cao Cao is truly a formidable foe. He has engulfed Yuan Shao&#x27;s territories and his forces are very powerful. If he uses the might of a victorious army to invade a weak and chaotic state, he&#x27;ll definitely win. Why don&#x27;t we dispatch our troops to assist him, while you send your family to Ye (Cao Cao&#x27;s base in northern China)? If not, we&#x27;ll be in danger.&quot; When a furious Sun Quan wanted to execute Lu Su, the latter said, &quot;We are in dire straits. Since you have other plans, why don&#x27;t you assist Liu Bei instead of executing me?&quot; Sun Quan agreed with Lu Su&#x27;s idea, so he ordered Zhou Yu to lead his forces to help Liu Bei.

The fourth-century historian Sun Sheng commented that both Wei Zhao&#x27;s &quot;Book of Wu&quot; and the &quot;Jiang Biao Zhuan&quot; () recorded that Lu Su urged Sun Quan to resist Cao Cao and build his own empire. When Liu Biao died, Lu Su advised Sun Quan to observe the developments. There was no mention of Lu Su using reverse psychology to persuade Sun Quan to go to war with Cao Cao. Sun Sheng pointed out that there were many others among Sun Quan&#x27;s subjects who urged their lord to surrender, so it made no sense for Sun Quan to single out Lu Su. He concluded that the accounts on Lu Su&#x27;s use of reverse psychology are absurd and unreliable.

==Battle of Red Cliffs==
At the time, Zhou Yu was in Poyang County so Lu Su advised Sun Quan to quickly summon Zhou Yu back to discuss their plans on how to counter Cao Cao&#x27;s impending invasion. When Zhou Yu returned, he also urged Sun Quan to resist Cao Cao. This resulted in Sun Quan arriving at his final decision to go to war with Cao Cao. Sun Quan put Zhou Yu in command of his military forces and appointed Lu Su as Colonel Who Praises the Army () to assist Zhou Yu in formulating the battle plan.

In the winter of 208, the allied forces of Sun Quan and Liu Bei defeated Cao Cao&#x27;s forces at the decisive Battle of Red Cliffs. When Lu Su returned after the battle, Sun Quan hosted a grand reception for him and said: &quot;Zijing, I dismounted from my horse and received you on foot. Is this enough to illuminate your glory?&quot; Lu Su replied: &quot;No.&quot; All the others present at the scene were startled by Lu Su&#x27;s response. After taking his seat, Lu Su raised his horsewhip and said: &quot;I hope that our lord will spread his might and virtues throughout the Four Seas, expand his territories to cover the Nine Provinces, and successfully build an empire. When he has achieved that and he comes to receive me on a carriage, I will be the first to feel honoured.&quot; Sun Quan clapped his hands and laughed.

==Handing over Jing Province to Liu Bei==
In 210, Liu Bei travelled to Jing (京; present-day Zhenjiang, Jiangsu) to meet Sun Quan and request for the governorship of Jing Province. Only Lu Su advised Sun Quan to &quot;lend&quot; Jing Province to Liu Bei so as to strengthen the Sun-Liu alliance against Cao Cao.

At the time, Lü Fan urged Sun Quan to hold Liu Bei hostage in Jiangdong and prevent him from returning to Jing Province. However, Lu Su objected: &quot;No. My lord, you may have received the blessings of Heaven, but Cao Cao is still a foe to be reckoned with. As we have recently taken control of Jing Province, we haven&#x27;t earned the trust and support of its people yet. It&#x27;s better to &#x27;lend&#x27; it to Liu Bei and let him help us pacify the area. The best strategy to adopt now is to create more enemies for Cao Cao and less enemies for ourselves.&quot; Sun Quan agreed with Lu Su.

Cao Cao was writing when he received news that Sun Quan had &quot;lent&quot; Jing Province to Liu Bei. He dropped his brush upon hearing that.

==Succeeding Zhou Yu==
In 210, when Zhou Yu became critically ill, he wrote to Sun Quan: 

The &quot;Jiang Biao Zhuan&quot; () provided a longer, but generally similar, account of Zhou Yu&#x27;s message to Sun Quan before his death. Zhou Yu wrote: 

After Zhou Yu&#x27;s death, Lu Su was appointed as Colonel of Vehement Martial Might () and succeeded Zhou Yu. He took charge of the 4,000 troops and the four counties which used to be under Zhou Yu&#x27;s control. Cheng Pu succeeded Zhou Yu as the Grand Administrator () of Nan Commandery (南郡; around present-day Jingzhou, Hubei). Lu Su was at Jiangling County initially, so he moved to Lukou (陸口; in present-day Jiayu County, Hubei) and garrisoned there. Lu Su governed with justice and benevolence, and the number of troops under his command increased to over 10,000. He was subsequently promoted to Lieutenant-General () and appointed as the Administrator of Hanchang Commandery (漢昌郡; around present-day Pingjiang County, Hunan).

In 214, Lu Su accompanied Sun Quan on a campaign at Wan County (皖縣; present-day Qianshan County, Anhui), a garrison under Cao Cao&#x27;s control. After Sun Quan&#x27;s forces emerged victorious, Lu Su was reassigned as General Who Crosses the River ().

==Sun–Liu territorial dispute==
===Background===
Before Zhou Yu died, he, along with Gan Ning and others, had constantly urged Sun Quan to seize Yi Province (covering present-day Sichuan and Chongqing) from its governor, Liu Zhang. However, Zhou Yu died of illness while making preparations for an invasion of Yi Province. When Sun Quan asked Liu Bei for his opinion, Liu Bei, who secretly had the intention of seizing Yi Province for himself, lied to Sun Quan: &quot;Liu Zhang and I are members of the imperial clan, so we should strive to uphold the Han dynasty with the aid of our ancestors&#x27; blessings. Now, when I heard that Liu Zhang has offended his neighbours, I feel afraid and don&#x27;t dare to probe further. I hope you can show leniency towards him. If you don&#x27;t, I will retire and return to the countryside.&quot; Liu Bei revealed his true intentions later when he attacked Liu Zhang himself and eventually seized control of Yi Province. During the campaign against Liu Zhang, Liu Bei left his general Guan Yu behind to guard Jing Province in his absence. When Sun Quan heard about Liu Bei&#x27;s takeover of Yi Province, he angrily remarked: &quot;This cunning barbarian dares to trick me!&quot;

At the same time, tensions were rising at the Sun–Liu border in Jing Province as both sides became more suspicious of each other. Lu Su tried to reduce the tensions by being friendly towards Liu Bei&#x27;s side. After Liu Bei took over Yi Province, Sun Quan asked him to return three commanderies in southern Jing Province – Changsha (), Lingling (零陵; around present-day Yongzhou, Hunan) and Guiyang (桂陽; around present-day Chenzhou, Hunan) – but Liu Bei refused. Sun Quan then ordered his general Lü Meng to lead his forces to seize the three commanderies by force. When Liu Bei found out, he returned to Gong&#x27;an County and sent Guan Yu to lead an army to stop Lü Meng.

===Negotiations===
At Yiyang, Lu Su invited Guan Yu to attend a meeting to discuss the dispute. During the negotiations, both sides stationed their soldiers more than 100 paces away from the meeting area and the officers present at the talks were each armed with only a blade weapon. Lu Su told Guan Yu: Before Lu Su could finish what he was saying, an unnamed person interrupted him and said: &quot;Whoever has the ability to govern the land shall have control over it. Isn&#x27;t it so?&quot; Lu Su angrily rebuked that person in a firm and stern tone. Guan Yu drew his sword, stood up and said, &quot;This is a state-level problem. We can&#x27;t hope to understand it.&quot; He left after that.

====&quot;Wu Shu&quot; account====
Wei Zhao&#x27;s &quot;Book of Wu&quot; provided more details on the meeting. Prior to the talks, Lu Su&#x27;s subordinates feared that Guan Yu would try to harm Lu Su, so they advised Lu Su against attending the meeting. However, Lu Su replied: &quot;It&#x27;s better for us to settle this issue in a peaceful manner. Liu Bei may have acted against our lord&#x27;s interests, but we haven&#x27;t agreed on who is right and who is wrong. Do you think Guan Yu will dare to do something as rash as killing me at this point in time?&quot;

Lu Su then met Guan Yu, who told him: 

Lu Su replied: Guan Yu did not respond to what Lu Su said.

Liu Bei eventually agreed to divide Jing Province between his and Sun Quan&#x27;s domains along the Xiang River. Both sides withdrew their forces.

==Death==
Lu Su died at the age of 46 (by East Asian age reckoning) in 217. Sun Quan mourned his death and attended his funeral. Zhuge Liang also held a memorial service for Lu Su.

==Descendants==
Lu Su&#x27;s son, Lu Shu () (217 - 274), was born physically strong. Zhang Cheng once remarked that Lu Shu would become very outstanding in the future. Between 258 and 264, during the reign of Sun Xiu, Lu Shu served as General of Illustrious Martial Might () and Area Commander () of Wuchang, and was named as a Marquis of a Chief Village (). Between 269 and 271, during the reign of Sun Xiu&#x27;s successor, Sun Hao, Lu Shu was reassigned as the Area Commander of Xiakou (). Lu Shu was known for being very disciplined and competent in his duties. He died in 274.

Lu Shu&#x27;s son, Lu Mu (), inherited his father&#x27;s marquis title and military post.

==Appraisal==
Wei Zhao&#x27;s &quot;Book of Wu&quot; () described Lu Su as follows: Lu Su was a strict person who rarely indulged in material pleasures, led a frugal life, and had no interest in common hobbies. He maintained good military discipline and executed orders without fail. Even when he was in the army, he was often seen reading books. He was proficient in arguing and writing. He could think far and possessed an exemplary sense of judgment. He was the best after Zhou Yu.

Sun Quan once told Lü Meng: 

In May 229, when Sun Quan was attending a ceremony to declare himself emperor and establish the state of Eastern Wu, he told his subjects: &quot;In the past, Lu Zijing often spoke about what is happening now. Indeed, he had good foresight.&quot;

==In &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;==

Lu Su appeared as a character in the 14th-century historical novel &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;, which romanticises the historical events before and during the Three Kingdoms period. In the novel, Lu Su&#x27;s role is significantly downplayed as compared to his historical counterpart, such that he is mainly used as a foil between Zhuge Liang and Zhou Yu to highlight their intelligence, especially for the former. He is also used to add minor comic relief to the rivalry between Zhuge Liang and Zhou Yu, particularly in the events leading to the Battle of Red Cliffs. Besides, he is also portrayed as an honest and sententious man who is often easily cheated and taken advantage of, resulting in his maladroit handling of the territorial dispute over Jing Province between Liu Bei and Sun Quan.

==In popular culture==
Lu Su was first introduced as a playable character in the eighth installment of Koei&#x27;s &quot;Dynasty Warriors&quot; video game series and &quot;Warriors Orochi 4&quot;. He also appears in Koei&#x27;s strategy game series &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;.

<text>Guo Jia () (170– October 207), courtesy name Fengxiao, was an adviser to the warlord Cao Cao during the late Eastern Han dynasty of China. Throughout his 11 years of service, Guo Jia aided Cao Cao greatly with his brilliance and foresight, and his strategies were instrumental to Cao Cao&#x27;s triumphs over rival warlords such as Lü Bu and Yuan Shao. For example, four years before Cao Cao&#x27;s decisive victory over Yuan Shao at the Battle of Guandu, Guo Jia already foresaw that Cao Cao would win when he pointed out ten advantages Cao Cao had over Yuan Shao.

==Historical sources on Guo Jia&#x27;s life==
The authoritative historical source on Guo Jia&#x27;s life is the &quot;Records of the Three Kingdoms&quot; (&quot;Sanguozhi&quot;), which was written by Chen Shou in the third century. In the fifth century, Pei Songzhi annotated the &quot;Sanguozhi&quot; by incorporating information from other sources to Chen Shou&#x27;s original work and adding his personal commentary. Some alternative texts used in the annotations to Guo Jia&#x27;s biography include: &quot;Fu Zi&quot;, by Fu Xuan; &quot;Wei Shu&quot; (&quot;Book of Wei&quot;), by Wang Chen, Xun Yi and Ruan Ji; &quot;Shiyu&quot; (&quot;Accounts of this Generation&quot;), by Guo Song.

==Early life==
Guo Jia was from Yangzhai County (), Yingchuan Commandery (), which is in present-day Yuzhou, Henan. As a youth, he was famous for his intelligence and foresight. Since reaching adulthood at around the age of 19, Guo Jia had been travelling around the country and befriending members of the scholar-gentry and other talented persons. He did not associate himself with the &quot;hoi polloi&quot; and was thus not very well known outside of his circles. However, all those who knew him recognised his talent and felt that he was extraordinary. When he was 26, he served in the Han government as a minor official in the office of the Minister over the Masses ().

Guo Jia once travelled to Hebei to meet Yuan Shao, an influential warlord who controlled most of northern China at the time. He later told Yuan Shao&#x27;s advisers Xin Ping and Guo Tu, &quot;An intelligent adviser should be prudent when he chooses which lord he wishes to serve so that his lord will heed every piece of advice he gives. The adviser can then establish his reputation. Lord Yuan (Yuan Shao) wishes to mimic the Duke of Zhou by recruiting men of talent to serve under him but he does not know how to tap into their abilities. He focuses too much on unnecessary details and neglects the main points; he likes to listen to many ideas but is indecisive. It is difficult for him to save the Empire from its troubles and achieve hegemony over the various warlords!&quot; Guo Jia then left Yuan Shao.

==Coming to serve Cao Cao==
Around the time, Cao Cao had a brilliant adviser, Xi Zhicai (), whom he appreciated greatly, but Xi died early. Cao Cao told another adviser Xun Yu, &quot;Ever since Xi Zhicai died, I&#x27;ve been lacking someone whom I can form strategies with. I heard there are many talents in the Ru and Ying regions. Who can replace Xi Zhicai?&quot; Xun Yu recommended Guo Jia to Cao Cao. Cao Cao and Guo Jia had a discussion on the affairs of their time, after which the former remarked: &quot;This must be the man who will help me achieve greatness.&quot; Guo Jia also happily said, &quot;He&#x27;s truly the lord I wish to serve.&quot; Guo Jia was then appointed as a Libationer () in the army of Cao Cao, who then held the position of Minister over the Masses () in the Han imperial court.

===Evaluation of Cao Cao&#x27;s advantages over Yuan Shao===
The &quot;Fu Zi&quot; recorded a detailed conversation between Guo Jia and Cao Cao, in which the former carefully pointed out ten advantages the latter had over Yuan Shao. Cao Cao asked Guo Jia, &quot;Benchu (Yuan Shao) rules Ji, Qing and Bing provinces and has vast territories and large numbers of troops under his command. However, he has also been making offensive moves. I intend to attack him, but my forces are weaker than his, so what should I do?&quot;

Guo Jia replied, 

Cao Cao laughed and said, &quot;If what you&#x27;ve said is true, I feel really flattered.&quot; Guo Jia said, &quot;Yuan Shao is now occupied in a war with Gongsun Zan in the north. We should head east to attack Lü Bu. If we don&#x27;t eliminate Lü Bu first, when Yuan Shao attacks us and Lü Bu assists him, we&#x27;ll be in deep trouble.&quot; Cao Cao agreed with Guo Jia.

==Cao Cao&#x27;s campaign against Lü Bu==
In 198, Cao Cao launched a campaign against his rival Lü Bu in Xu Province, leading to the Battle of Xiapi. Lü Bu lost three battles and retreated to Xiapi (下邳; present-day Pizhou, Jiangsu). Cao Cao&#x27;s forces besieged the city for months but they still could not conquer it because Lü Bu and his men resisted firmly. By then, Cao Cao&#x27;s troops were tired and weary of battle, so Cao intended to withdraw his forces. However, Guo Jia and Xun You told Cao Cao, &quot;Lü Bu is courageous but foolhardy. His army&#x27;s morale is low because he has already lost three battles. The troops look up to their commander. If their commander shows any sign of weakness, the men will lose their fighting spirit. Lü Bu may have Chen Gong as an intelligent adviser but the latter&#x27;s strategies always come late. Now, we should take advantage of this situation, when the morale of Lü Bu&#x27;s forces is low and when Chen Gong has yet to think of a solution, to press on a fierce attack and we&#x27;ll achieve victory.&quot; Cao Cao heeded their advice and directed the waters of the Yi () and Si rivers to flood Xiapi, resulting in his triumph over Lü Bu.

The &quot;Fu Zi&quot; recorded another piece of advice Guo Jia gave to Cao Cao during the Battle of Xiapi: &quot;In the past, Xiang Yu never lost any of the over 70 battles he fought in, but once the tide turned against him, he ended up in death and destruction. This was due to his reliance on his personal courage and his negligence towards strategy. Lü Bu has lost three consecutive battles and his army&#x27;s morale is low and his defences are weakening. His might is not comparable to Xiang Yu, and he is now overwhelmed by defeat and weariness. If we take advantage of our successes to press on the attack on him, we can defeat him.&quot; Cao Cao agreed with him.

==Advice to Cao Cao on how to handle Liu Bei==
According to the &quot;Wei Shu&quot;, Guo Jia advised Cao Cao on how to handle Liu Bei when Liu Bei came to join Cao Cao in 196, after Lü Bu seized control of Xu Province from Liu&#x27;s general Zhang Fei. On Cao Cao&#x27;s suggestion, Emperor Xian appointed Liu Bei as the Governor () of Yu Province (). Someone told Cao Cao, &quot;Liu Bei has the ambition of a hero. If you don&#x27;t eliminate him now, he&#x27;ll become a threat to you in the future.&quot; Cao Cao asked Guo Jia for his opinion, to which Guo replied, &quot;That&#x27;s true. However, when you raised an army in the name of righteousness and pledged to help the common people eliminate tyrants, you attracted talented and capable people to serve under you based on your sincerity and integrity. Liu Bei is known to be a hero, so if you kill him when he comes to serve you, you will be viewed as someone who harms men of virtue. Other talented persons will start to doubt you and may even change their minds about serving you. If that happens, who will help you achieve your goals? Therefore, it&#x27;s imperative that you carefully consider the consequences of ruining your good reputation for the sake of eliminating one man who poses a threat to you.&quot; Cao Cao laughed and said, &quot;I understand.&quot;

However, the &quot;Fu Zi&quot; gave a completely different account of Guo&#x27;s advice to Cao Cao on how to handle Liu Bei. Guo Jia told Cao Cao, &quot;Liu Bei has great ambitions and has won the hearts of many people. Zhang Fei and Guan Yu are formidable fighters and they have pledged to serve him with their lives. From what I observe, Liu Bei will never truly submit to anyone, and his intentions are unclear. The people in the past once said, &#x27;If you let the enemy off today, they will become a threat to you for a long time.&#x27; You should settle (Liu Bei) soon.&quot; At the time, Cao Cao was using Emperor Xian as a figurehead to command respect and had attracted many heroes to serve under him so he did not heed Guo Jia&#x27;s advice. When Cao Cao later sent Liu Bei with an army to attack Yuan Shu, Guo Jia and Cheng Yu warned Cao, &quot;Liu Bei will rebel if you let him go!&quot; By then, Liu Bei had already left and he really did rebel against Cao Cao as he later seized control of Xu Province from Che Zhou, the provincial governor appointed by Cao Cao. Cao Cao regretted not following Guo Jia&#x27;s advice.

Pei Songzhi noted that the &quot;Wei Shu&quot; account is exactly the opposite of the &quot;Fu Zi&quot; account, but did not give his opinion on which he regarded to be the genuine one. The Chronicles of Huayang stated that following Lu Bu&#x27;s defeat at Xiapi. Both Cheng Yu and Guo Jia encouraged Cao Cao to have Liu Bei killed but that Cao Cao refused fearing that such an act may hurt his reputation.

==Prediction of Sun Ce&#x27;s death==
Between 194 and 199, the warlord Sun Ce embarked on a series of conquests in Jiangdong and seized control of most of the territories in the region. Around 200, Cao Cao finally engaged Yuan Shao at the Battle of Guandu. When Sun Ce heard that Cao Cao was locked in a stalemate with Yuan Shao at Guandu, he planned to lead an army across the Yangtze River and launch a surprise attack on the imperial capital Xu (許; present-day Xuchang, Henan), which was Cao Cao&#x27;s base. When Cao Cao&#x27;s men received news of the impending assault, they were all shocked and frightened, but Guo Jia said, &quot;Sun Ce had newly conquered the lands in Jiangdong and he killed many heroes whose followers were willing to die for them. Besides, Sun Ce is overly confident and is unprepared, so even though he has thousands of troops, the situation is not much different from him setting out to conquer the Central Plains all by himself. If he encounters assassins, he&#x27;ll have to deal with them alone. From what I observe, he&#x27;ll eventually die at the hands of a common man.&quot; Guo Jia&#x27;s prediction came true as Sun Ce was assassinated by the followers of Xu Gong (a commandery administrator he killed earlier) before he could even carry out his plan.

Pei Songzhi commented that Guo Jia&#x27;s accurate prediction of Sun Ce&#x27;s assassination was a display of Guo&#x27;s foresight, but not a good gauge of Guo&#x27;s brilliance because Guo did not manage to predict which year Sun Ce would die. He felt that it was purely coincidental that Sun Ce was assassinated in the same year he was planning to attack Xu.

==Suggestion to Cao Cao to attack Liu Bei first before attacking Yuan Shao==
According to the &quot;Fu Zi&quot;, before the Battle of Guandu, Cao Cao wanted to attack Liu Bei (who had rebelled and seized control of Xu Province) first before dealing with Yuan Shao. However, some of Cao Cao&#x27;s advisers expressed their worries that Yuan Shao would take advantage of their absence to attack them, rendering them trapped between Yuan and Liu Bei. Cao Cao faced a dilemma so he asked Guo Jia for his opinion. Guo Jia suggested, &quot;Yuan Shao is suspicious and he hesitates before he makes any decision, so he won&#x27;t make his move fast. Liu Bei had just taken control of Xu Province so his situation isn&#x27;t stable yet. He can be easily defeated if we attack him fast and hard. This is a critical opportunity, we mustn&#x27;t lose it.&quot; Cao Cao agreed and immediately led an army east to attack Liu Bei and defeated the latter. After his defeat, Liu Bei fled to Hebei to join Yuan Shao. Throughout that period of time, Yuan Shao did not make any move.

However, Pei Songzhi commented that Guo Jia was not the one who pointed out Yuan Shao&#x27;s weakness and suggested to launch a swift attack on Liu Bei. Rather, according to Cao Cao&#x27;s biography in the &quot;Sanguozhi&quot;, it was Cao who thought of that plan himself.

==Cao Cao&#x27;s campaigns against Yuan Shao&#x27;s sons==
Cao Cao scored a decisive victory over Yuan Shao at the Battle of Guandu in 200. Yuan Shao died two years after his defeat and his sons Yuan Tan and Yuan Shang started fighting each other for control over their father&#x27;s vast domain. Cao Cao defeated Yuan Tan and Yuan Shang at the Battle of Liyang in 202–203 and won several consecutive battles. At the time, many of Cao Cao&#x27;s generals urged Cao to take advantage of his successes to continue attacking the Yuans, but Guo Jia said, &quot;Yuan Shao loved both sons so he couldn&#x27;t decide between them who would succeed him. With advisers like Guo Tu and Pang Ji to assist the Yuans, internal conflict will definitely break out between them. If we press on our attacks, the Yuans will unite to resist us. If we withdraw our forces, the Yuans will start fighting among themselves. Why don&#x27;t we turn south and attack Liu Biao in Jing Province first? We should wait until the Yuan brothers start fighting each other and then attack them. We&#x27;ll achieve victory in this way.&quot; Cao Cao agreed and prepared for a campaign against Liu Biao.

Internal conflict did break out between Yuan Tan and Yuan Shang later, which resulted in Yuan Tan being defeated by his younger brother. Yuan Tan retreated to Pingyuan () and sent Xin Pi to meet Cao Cao, agreeing to surrender to Cao and requesting for assistance in dealing with Yuan Shang. Cao Cao led his forces north and defeated Yuan Shang at the Battle of Ye in 204. In 205, Cao Cao attacked Yuan Tan on some pretence and defeated him at the Battle of Nanpi. By then, Cao Cao had pacified most of Ji Province in northern China. In recognition of his contributions, the Han imperial court enfeoffed Guo Jia as the Marquis of Weiyang Village ().

===Battle of White Wolf Mountain===
When Cao Cao was preparing for another campaign against Yuan Shang (who had fled to join his second brother Yuan Xi and the Wuhuan tribes), many of his followers were worried that Liu Biao might send Liu Bei (who had become a vassal under Liu Biao) to attack Cao Cao&#x27;s base, the imperial capital Xu (許; present-day Xuchang, Henan). However, Guo Jia said to Cao Cao, &quot;Your military might may be very well known now, but the Wuhuan will definitely not set up defences because they are deluded by a false sense of security since they are far away from you. As such, if you seize this opportunity to launch a surprise attack on them, you can eliminate them. Besides, Yuan Shao treated the ethnic minorities well and the Yuan brothers are still alive. Now, the people of northern China submit to you because they fear your military might, and you&#x27;ve yet to pacify them through benevolent governance. If you abandon the campaign and head south instead, the Wuhuan and Yuan Shao&#x27;s former followers might rally the support of the people in northern China, who are likely to respond to their call. When that happens, the attention of Tadun (a Wuhuan chieftain) will be aroused and he may think of attacking you, and by then we would have lost Qing and Ji provinces. Liu Biao is a person who does nothing but sit and talk. He also does not trust Liu Bei as the latter is more capable than him – if he entrusts Liu Bei with important responsibilities, he will be worried that the latter will no longer submit to him; if he gives Liu Bei trivial tasks to do, the latter will be reluctant to serve him. Even if you empty your territories to campaign far away, you have no worries.&quot; Cao Cao proceeded with his campaign against the Yuan brothers and the Wuhuan.

When Cao Cao&#x27;s forces arrived at Yi (), Guo Jia said, &quot;A swift army is powerful. Now, as we&#x27;ve travelled a long distance, we have much heavy baggage so we cannot launch a swift attack. If the enemy learns of our approach, they will definitely prepare defences. Why don&#x27;t we leave the heavy baggage behind and send our light forces to take a shortcut and launch a surprise attack?&quot; Cao Cao led his army through a secret passage at Lulong Pass () and headed directly towards the Wuhuan chieftains&#x27; headquarters. The Wuhuan were shocked when they heard of Cao Cao&#x27;s approach and they hastily assembled their army, but were defeated by Cao Cao at the Battle of White Wolf Mountain. Tadun was killed in battle. The Yuan brothers fled to Liaodong to join the warlord Gongsun Kang, who captured and executed them and then sent their heads to Cao Cao.

==Death==
Guo Jia was known for his deep foresight, which allowed him to accurately predict the outcomes of events. Cao Cao once remarked, &quot;Only Fengxiao knows what&#x27;s on my mind.&quot;

Chen Qun once made many complaints about Guo Jia, saying how Guo was very unbridled in his ways. Guo Jia, however, remained calm in the face of these accusations. Cao Cao still regarded Guo Jia highly but was also pleased that Chen Qun stood by his own principles.

Guo Jia fell ill after departing from Liucheng (柳城; in present-day Chaoyang County, Liaoning) following Cao Cao&#x27;s victory at the Battle of White Wolf Mountain in 207. He was 38 years old (by East Asian age reckoning) at that time and he died not long later. Cao Cao was very grieved by Guo Jia&#x27;s death. He told Xun You, &quot;All of you are around the same age as me; only Fengxiao was the youngest. I planned to entrust him with responsibilities before my death, but it&#x27;s destined that he would die at such a young age.&quot;

Cao Cao then wrote a memorial to Emperor Xian: &quot;Army Libationer Guo Jia had served in the military for 11 years. There would be a discussion whenever we faced difficult situations, and when I could not decide on what to do, he was the one who helped me arrive at my decisions. He has made great contributions in the pacification of the Empire. It is unfortunate that he died early and did not manage to complete his task. We should not forget his contributions. I suggest that his family be granted an additional 800 taxable households under their control, making it a total of 1,000 households.&quot; The &quot;Wei Shu&quot; () recorded a longer memorial written by Cao Cao to Emperor Xian, requesting for Guo Jia to be honoured. Guo Jia was granted the posthumous title &quot;Marquis Zhen&quot; (), which literally means &quot;chaste marquis&quot;.

In 209, when Cao Cao was returning to Xu (許; present-day Xuchang, Henan) after his defeat at the Battle of Red Cliffs, he passed by Baqiu (), where a plague broke out in his army. He ordered the boats to be burnt, and sighed, &quot;If Guo Fengxiao was around, I wouldn&#x27;t have ended up like this.&quot; Cao Cao mourned Guo Jia again. He also wrote to Xun Yu twice to lament Guo Jia&#x27;s death.

==Family==
Guo Jia&#x27;s peerage was inherited by his son, Guo Yi (), whose courtesy name was Boyi (). Wang Chang wrote in his book &quot;Family Rules&quot; () that Guo Yi was &quot;well-read and intelligent, but prejudiced and not generous in how he treated others; he was respectful towards people he favoured, but contemptuous towards people he disliked.&quot; Wang Chang thus hoped that his children would learn from Guo Yi&#x27;s example and not be like him. Guo Yi served as a Literary Scholar of the Crown Prince () in the state of Cao Wei during the Three Kingdoms period and died relatively early like his father before him.

Guo Yi&#x27;s son, Guo Shen (), inherited his father&#x27;s peerage, and was in turn succeeded by his son Guo Lie () when he died.

Guo Jia had another grandson, Guo Chang (), whose courtesy name was Taizhong (). Guo Chang was known for his brilliance and he served as a Regular Mounted Attendant () in the Cao Wei state during the Three Kingdoms period.

==In &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;==
Guo Jia appears as a character in the historical novel &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot; (&quot;Sanguo Yanyi&quot;) by Luo Guanzhong, which romanticises the historical events before and during the Three Kingdoms period.

In chapter 33 of the novel, Guo Jia was accompanying Cao Cao on his campaign against the Yuan brothers (Yuan Shang and Yuan Xi) and the Wuhuan when he fell sick because he could not adjust to the climate. He advised Cao Cao to leave the heavy baggage behind and launch a swift attack on the enemy with a light force, which resulted in Cao&#x27;s victory later at the Battle of White Wolf Mountain. Guo Jia remained in Yizhou () to recover and did not follow Cao Cao to the frontline. When Cao Cao returned to Yizhou later, he was deeply grieved to hear that Guo Jia had already died several days ago. Before his death, Guo Jia wrote Cao Cao a note, whose contents were not revealed until later in the chapter. When Cao Cao received news that Yuan Shang and Yuan Xi had fled to Liaodong to join the warlord Gongsun Kang, his subordinates urged him to either attack Liaodong or return to Xu (許; present-day Xuchang, Henan), but Cao told them to wait until they had received the Yuan brothers&#x27; heads. Just then, Cao Cao heard that Gongsun Kang had captured and killed the Yuan brothers and sent their heads to him, and his followers were very surprised. Cao Cao then revealed Guo Jia&#x27;s note, which stated: &quot;I heard that Yuan Xi and Yuan Shang had fled to Liaodong. You should not mobilise the army. Gongsun Kang had long feared that the Yuans would conquer his territory so he would definitely feel suspicious when the Yuan brothers join him. If you attack them, they will unite to resist you and you cannot overcome them quickly; if you do not move, Gongsun Kang and the Yuans will fight each other, and this is definite.&quot;

==In popular culture==
Guo Jia is first introduced as a playable character in the &quot;Xtreme Legends&quot; version of the seventh instalment in Koei&#x27;s &quot;Dynasty Warriors&quot; video game series. He also appears in Koei&#x27;s &quot;Dynasty Tactics&quot; and &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot; series.

Guo Jia is the protagonist of the manga by .

He is portrayed by Wang Jinxin in the 2010 Chinese television series &quot;Three Kingdoms&quot;.

<text>Baron Dormer, of Wyng (or Wenge), County of Buckingham, is a title in the Peerage of England. It was created on 30 June 1615 for Sir Robert Dormer, 1st Baronet. He had, only twenty days earlier on 10 June 1615, been created a baronet &quot;of Wing in the County of Buckingham&quot;, in the Baronetage of England.

His grandson, the 2nd Baron Dormer was raised to Viscount Ascott in the County of Buckingham, and Earl of Carnarvon in 1628, and later became a prominent Royalist commander in the Civil War. On the death of his son, the second Earl, in 1707, the viscountcy and earldom became extinct. However, the late Earl was succeeded in the baronetcy and barony by his second cousin, the fourth Baron. He was the grandson of The Hon. Anthony Dormer, second son of the first Baron. On his death this line of the family also failed and the titles passed to his second cousin, the fifth Baron. He was the grandson of The Hon. Robert Dormer, third son of the first Baron. He was succeeded by his son, the sixth Baron. He was a Roman Catholic priest and did not assume the title. On his death the title passed to his younger brother, the seventh Baron.

His grandson, the tenth Baron, who succeeded his half-brother in 1819, was, like many of the recusant Dormer family, a Roman Catholic. However, he converted to the Church of England and took his seat in the House of Lords. He was succeeded by his first cousin, the eleventh Baron. He was the son of The Hon. John Dormer, second son of the seventh Baron. Lord Dormer served as an officer in the Austrian Army. the titles are held by his great-great-grandson, the eighteenth Baron, who succeeded his father in 2016.

<doc id="459466" wikidata="Q16950756" url="?curid=459466" title="Comprehensive Employment and Training Act">
<text>The Comprehensive Employment and Training Act (CETA, ) was a United States federal law enacted by the Congress, and signed into law by President Richard Nixon on December 28, 1973 to train workers and provide them with jobs in the public service. The bill was introduced as S. 1559, the Job Training and Community Services Act, by Republican Representative Jack Kemp of New York.

The program offered work to those with low incomes and the long term unemployed as well as summer jobs to low income high school students. Full-time jobs were provided for a period of 12 to 24 months in public agencies or private not for profit organizations. The intent was to impart a marketable skill that would allow participants to move to an unsubsidized job. It was an extension of the Works Progress Administration (WPA) program from the 1930s.

Inspired by the WPA&#x27;s employment of artists in the service to the community in the 1930s, the San Francisco Arts Commission initiated the CETA/Neighborhood Arts Program in the 1970s, which employed painters, muralists, musicians, performing artists, poets and gardeners to work in schools, community centers, prisons and wherever their skills and services were of value to the community. The idea for CETA/Neighborhood Arts Program came from John Kreidler, then working with the Arts Commission as an intern, with the Arts Commission&#x27;s Neighborhood Arts Program under the direction of Stephen Goldstine. The program was so successful in San Francisco that it became a model for similar programs, nationally. The CETA Artists Project in New York City was one of the largest.

Nine years later, CETA was replaced by the Job Training Partnership Act.

<text>Roman Dirge (born Roman Elliot; April 29, 1972) is an American comic book writer, artist, and former magician. He is best known as the creator of the comic book series &quot;Lenore, the Cute Little Dead Girl&quot;.

==Career==
Told by his art teachers that he would never make it as an artist due to his crude style, he quit art and became a full-time magician. After a few years, his passion for art overtook him and he created the comic &quot;Lenore, the Cute Little Dead Girl&quot; for &quot;Xenophobe&quot; magazine. The comic strips were later seen by Dan Vado, president of Slave Labor Graphics.

Dirge has also written books such as &quot;Something At The Window Is Scratching&quot;, &quot;The Monsters In My Tummy&quot;, &quot;The Cat With A Really Big Head: And One Other Story That Isn&#x27;t As Good&quot; and has done work for &quot;The Haunted Mansion&quot; comics. He has over 75 tattoos.

On February 26, 2013, Dirge and his then girlfriend were injured in a hit-and-run accident in Hollywood, California, while crossing the street. One of Dirge&#x27;s legs was severely injured and had to be rebuilt with a metal rod, but he was said to be in good spirits despite facing a long recovery.

==Animation==
26 episodes of a Lenore Animation were created for Sony&#x27;s website ScreenBlast, these are no longer available on Screenblast, but can now be seen on Dirge&#x27;s site Spooky Land. Roman Dirge wrote for his friend, and fellow Slave Labor Graphics artist Jhonen Vasquez&#x27;s &quot;Invader ZIM&quot;, and on the back of the second &quot;Invader ZIM&quot; DVD it says &quot;Made with 100% more Dirge&quot; with a picture of him on it, &quot;Invader Zim&quot; style.

== Music ==
Dirge was in a band during high school named Of Worlds Long Dead.

Dirge provided original art for Scarling&#x27;s tour posters in 2003.

Dirge provided the cover, booklet and CD art for the 2001 album &quot;Welt&quot; as well as the cover art for the 2018 album &quot;Tricks&quot; by ohGr.

<text>A breathing gas is a mixture of gaseous chemical elements and compounds used for respiration. Air is the most common and only natural breathing gas, but other mixtures of gases, or pure oxygen, are also used in breathing equipment and enclosed habitats. Oxygen is the essential component for any breathing gas. Breathing gases for hyperbaric use have been developed to improve on the performance of ordinary air by reducing the risk of decompression sickness, reducing the duration of decompression, reducing nitrogen narcosis or reducing work of breathing and allowing safer deep diving.

== Description ==
A breathing gas is a mixture of gaseous chemical elements and compounds used for respiration. Air is the most common and only natural breathing gas. Other mixtures of gases, or pure oxygen, are also used in breathing equipment and enclosed habitats such as scuba equipment, surface supplied diving equipment, recompression chambers, high-altitude mountaineering, high-flying aircraft, submarines, space suits, spacecraft, medical life support and first aid equipment, and anaesthetic machines.

== Contents ==

Oxygen is the essential component for any breathing gas, at a partial pressure of between roughly 0.16 and 1.60 bar at the ambient pressure, occasionally lower for high altitude mountaineering, or higher for hyperbaric oxygen treatment. The oxygen is usually the only metabolically active component unless the gas is an anaesthetic mixture. Some of the oxygen in the breathing gas is consumed by the metabolic processes, and the inert components are unchanged, and serve mainly to dilute the oxygen to an appropriate concentration, and are therefore also known as diluent gases.

Most breathing gases therefore are a mixture of oxygen and one or more metabolically inert gases. Breathing gases for hyperbaric use have been developed to improve on the performance of ordinary air by reducing the risk of decompression sickness, reducing the duration of decompression, reducing nitrogen narcosis or allowing safer deep diving. The techniques used to fill diving cylinders with gases other than air or pure oxygen are called gas blending.

Breathing gases for use at ambient pressures below normal atmospheric pressure are usually pure oxygen or air enriched with oxygen to provide sufficient oxygen to maintain life and consciousness, or to allow higher levels of exertion than would be possible using air. It is common to provide the additional oxygen as a pure gas added to the breathing air at inhalation, or though a life-support system.

== For diving and other hyperbaric use ==

A safe breathing gas for use has four essential features:
* It must contain sufficient oxygen to support life, consciousness and work rate of the breather.
* It must not contain harmful contaminants. Carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide are common poisons which may contaminate breathing gases. There are many other possibilities.
* It must not become toxic when being breathed at high pressure such as when underwater. Oxygen and nitrogen are examples of gases that become toxic under pressure.
* It must not be too dense to breathe. Work of breathing increases with density and viscosity. Maximum ventilation drops by about 50% when density is equivalent to air at 30 msw, and carbon dioxide levels rise unacceptably for moderate exercise with a gas density exceeding 6 g/litre. Breathing gas density of 10 g/litre or more may cause runaway hypercapnia even at very low work levels, with potentially fatal effects.
These common diving breathing gases are used:
* Air is a mixture of 21% oxygen, 78% nitrogen, and approximately 1% other trace gases, primarily argon; to simplify calculations this last 1% is usually treated as if it were nitrogen. Being freely available and simple to use, it is the most common diving gas. As its nitrogen component causes nitrogen narcosis, it is considered to have a safe depth limit of about for most divers, although the maximum operating depth (MOD) of air taking an allowable oxygen partial pressure of 1,6 bar is . Breathing air is air meeting specified standards for contaminants.
* Pure oxygen is mainly used to speed the shallow decompression stops at the end of a military, commercial, or technical dive. Risk of acute oxygen toxicity increases rapidly at pressures greater than 6 metres sea water. It was much used in frogmen&#x27;s rebreathers, and is still used by attack swimmers.
* are mixtures of two or more gases specifically blended for use as breathing gas for divers. They may be mixed to the composition required before the dive, for open circuit use, or produced in the breathing circuit of a rebreather during the dive. Diving using mixed gases is referred to as mixed gas diving.
** &quot;Nitrox&quot; is a mixture of oxygen and nitrogen, either by mixing oxygen with air, or by removing nitrogen from air, and generally refers to mixtures which are more than 21% oxygen. It can be used as a tool to accelerate in-water decompression stops or to decrease the risk of decompression sickness and thus prolong a dive (a common misconception is that the diver can go deeper, this is not true owing to a shallower maximum operating depth than on conventional air).
** &quot;Trimix&quot; is a mixture of oxygen, nitrogen and helium and is often used at depth in technical diving and commercial diving instead of air to decrease density, reduce nitrogen narcosis and to avoid the dangers of oxygen toxicity.
** &quot;Heliox&quot; is a mixture of oxygen and helium and is often used in the deep phase of a commercial deep dive to eliminate nitrogen narcosis and reduce density, to limit work of breathing. Heliox is the standard mixture type for deep offshore saturation diving.
** &quot;Heliair&quot; is a form of trimix that is easily blended from helium and air without using pure oxygen. It always has a 21:79 ratio of oxygen to nitrogen; the balance of the mix is helium.
** &quot;Hydreliox&quot; is a mixture of oxygen, helium, and hydrogen and is used for dives below 130 metres in commercial diving. Experimental work using hydreliox is also done in deep technical diving, where the hydrogen is used to reduce HPNS.
** &quot;Hydrox&quot;, a gas mixture of hydrogen and oxygen, is used as a breathing gas in very deep diving.
** &quot;Neox&quot; (also called neonox) is a mixture of oxygen and neon sometimes employed in deep commercial diving. It is rarely used due to its cost. Also, DCS symptoms produced by neon (&quot;neox bends&quot;) have a poor reputation, being widely reported to be more severe than those produced by an exactly equivalent dive-table and mix with helium.

=== Breathing air ===
Breathing air is atmospheric air with a standard of purity suitable for human breathing in the specified application. For hyperbaric use, the partial pressure of contaminants is increased in proportion to the absolute pressure, and must be limited to a safe composition for the depth or pressure range in which it is to be used.

=== Classification by oxygen fraction ===
Breathing gases for diving are classified by oxygen fraction. The boundaries set by authorities may differ slightly, as the effects vary gradually with concentration and between people, and are not accurately predictable.
;: where the oxygen content does not differ greatly from that of air and allows continuous safe use at atmospheric pressure.
;, or : where the oxygen content exceeds atmospheric levels, generally to a level where there is some measurable physiological effect over long term use, and sometimes requiring special procedures for handling due to increased fire hazard. The associated risks are oxygen toxicity at depth and fire, particularly in the breathing apparatus.
;: where the oxygen content is less than that of air, generally to the extent that there is a significant risk of measurable physiological effect over the short term. The immediate risk is usually hypoxic incapacitation at or near the surface.

=== Individual component gases ===
Breathing gases for diving are mixed from a small number of component gases which provide special characteristics to the mixture which are not available from atmospheric air.

==== Oxygen ====
Oxygen (O2) must be present in every breathing gas. This is because it is essential to the human body&#x27;s metabolic process, which sustains life. The human body cannot store oxygen for later use as it does with food. If the body is deprived of oxygen for more than a few minutes, unconsciousness and death result. The tissues and organs within the body (notably the heart and brain) are damaged if deprived of oxygen for much longer than four minutes.

Filling a diving cylinder with pure oxygen costs around five times more than filling it with compressed air. As oxygen supports combustion and causes rust in diving cylinders, it should be handled with caution when gas blending.

Oxygen has historically been obtained by fractional distillation of liquid air, but is increasingly obtained by non-cryogenic technologies such as pressure swing adsorption (PSA) and vacuum swing adsorption (VSA) technologies.

The fraction of the oxygen component of a breathing gas mixture is sometimes used when naming the mix:
* &quot;hypoxic&quot; mixes, strictly, contain less than 21% oxygen, although often a boundary of 16% is used, and are designed only to be breathed at depth as a &quot;bottom gas&quot; where the higher pressure increases the partial pressure of oxygen to a safe level. Trimix, Heliox and Heliair are gas blends commonly used for hypoxic mixes and are used in professional and technical diving as deep breathing gases. A may be assigned to a hypoxic gas mixture, based on the depth at which the partial pressure is equal to the minimum oxygen partial pressure acceptable to the person or organisation using the gas.
* &quot;normoxic&quot; mixes have the same proportion of oxygen as air, 21%. The maximum operating depth of a normoxic mix could be as shallow as . Trimix with between 17% and 21% oxygen is often described as normoxic because it contains a high enough proportion of oxygen to be safe to breathe at the surface.
* &quot;hyperoxic&quot; mixes have more than 21% oxygen. Enriched Air Nitrox (EANx) is a typical hyperoxic breathing gas. Hyperoxic mixtures, when compared to air, cause oxygen toxicity at shallower depths but can be used to shorten decompression stops by drawing dissolved inert gases out of the body more quickly.

The fraction of the oxygen determines the greatest depth at which the mixture can safely be used to avoid oxygen toxicity. This depth is called the maximum operating depth.

The concentration of oxygen in a gas mix depends on the fraction and the pressure of the mixture. It is expressed by the partial pressure of oxygen (PO2).

The partial pressure of any component gas in a mixture is calculated as:

:&quot;partial pressure = total absolute pressure × volume fraction of gas component&quot;

For the oxygen component,

:PO2 = P × FO2
where:
:PO2 = partial pressure of oxygen
:P = total pressure
:FO2 = volume fraction of oxygen content

The minimum safe partial pressure of oxygen in a breathing gas is commonly held to be 16 kPa (0.16 bar). Below this partial pressure the diver may be at risk of unconsciousness and death due to hypoxia, depending on factors including individual physiology and level of exertion. When a hypoxic mix is breathed in shallow water it may not have a high enough PO2 to keep the diver conscious. For this reason normoxic or hyperoxic &quot;travel gases&quot; are used at medium depth between the &quot;bottom&quot; and &quot;decompression&quot; phases of the dive.

The maximum safe PO2 in a breathing gas depends on exposure time, the level of exercise and the security of the breathing equipment being used. It is typically between 100 kPa (1 bar) and 160 kPa (1.6 bar); for dives of less than three hours it is commonly considered to be 140 kPa (1.4 bar), although the U.S. Navy has been known to authorize dives with a PO2 of as much as 180 kPa (1.8 bar). At high PO2 or longer exposures, the diver risks oxygen toxicity which may result in a seizure. Each breathing gas has a maximum operating depth that is determined by its oxygen content. For therapeutic recompression and hyperbaric oxygen therapy partial pressures of 2.8 bar are commonly used in the chamber, but there is no risk of drowning if the occupant loses consciousness. For longer periods such as in saturation diving, 0.4 bar can be tolerated over several weeks.

Oxygen analysers are used to measure the oxygen partial pressure in the gas mix.

 Divox is breathing grade oxygen labelled for diving use. In the Netherlands, pure oxygen for breathing purposes is regarded as medicinal as opposed to industrial oxygen, such as that used in welding, and is only available on medical prescription. The diving industry registered Divox as a trademark for breathing grade oxygen to circumvent the strict rules concerning medicinal oxygen thus making it easier for (recreational) scuba divers to obtain oxygen for blending their breathing gas.
In most countries, there is no difference in purity in medical oxygen and industrial oxygen, as they are produced by exactly the same methods and manufacturers, but labeled and filled differently. The chief difference between them is that the record-keeping trail is much more extensive for medical oxygen, to more easily identify the exact manufacturing trail of a &quot;lot&quot; or batch of oxygen, in case problems with its purity are discovered. Aviation grade oxygen is similar to medical oxygen, but may have a lower moisture content.

==== Diluent gases ====

Gases which have no metabolic function in the breathing gas are used to dilute the gas, and are therefore classed as diluent gases. Some of them have a reversible narcotic effect at high partial pressure, and must therefore be limited to avoid excessive narcotic effects at the maximum pressure at which they are intended to be breathed. Diluent gases also affect the density of the gas mixture and thereby the work of breathing.

===== Nitrogen =====
Nitrogen (N2) is a diatomic gas and the main component of air, the cheapest and most common breathing gas used for diving. It causes nitrogen narcosis in the diver, so its use is limited to shallower dives. Nitrogen can cause decompression sickness.

Equivalent air depth is used to estimate the decompression requirements of a nitrox (oxygen/nitrogen) mixture. Equivalent narcotic depth is used to estimate the narcotic potency of trimix (oxygen/helium/nitrogen mixture). Many divers find that the level of narcosis caused by a dive, whilst breathing air, is a comfortable maximum.

Nitrogen in a gas mix is almost always obtained by adding air to the mix.

===== Helium =====

Helium (He) is an inert gas that is less narcotic than nitrogen at equivalent pressure (in fact there is no evidence for any narcosis from helium at all), and it has a much lower density, so it is more suitable for deeper dives than nitrogen. Helium is equally able to cause decompression sickness. At high pressures, helium also causes high-pressure nervous syndrome, which is a central nervous system irritation syndrome which is in some ways opposite to narcosis.

Helium mixture fills are considerably more expensive than air fills due to the cost of helium and the cost of mixing and compressing the mix.

Helium is not suitable for dry suit inflation owing to its poor thermal insulation properties – compared to air, which is regarded as a reasonable insulator, helium has six times the thermal conductivity. Helium&#x27;s low molecular weight (monatomic MW=4, compared with diatomic nitrogen MW=28) increases the timbre of the breather&#x27;s voice, which may impede communication. This is because the speed of sound is faster in a lower molecular weight gas, which increases the resonance frequency of the vocal cords. Helium leaks from damaged or faulty valves more readily than other gases because atoms of helium are smaller allowing them to pass through smaller gaps in seals.

Helium is found in significant amounts only in natural gas, from which it is extracted at low temperatures by fractional distillation.

===== Neon =====

Neon (Ne) is an inert gas sometimes used in deep commercial diving but is very expensive. Like helium, it is less narcotic than nitrogen, but unlike helium, it does not distort the diver&#x27;s voice. Compared to helium, neon has superior thermal insulating properties.

===== Hydrogen =====
Hydrogen (H2) has been used in deep diving gas mixes but is very explosive when mixed with more than about 4 to 5% oxygen (such as the oxygen found in breathing gas). This limits use of hydrogen to deep dives and imposes complicated protocols to ensure that excess oxygen is cleared from the breathing equipment before breathing hydrogen starts. Like helium, it raises the timbre of the diver&#x27;s voice. The hydrogen-oxygen mix when used as a diving gas is sometimes referred to as Hydrox. Mixtures containing both hydrogen and helium as diluents are termed Hydreliox.

=== Unwelcome components of breathing gases for diving ===
Many gases are not suitable for use in diving breathing gases. Here is an incomplete list of gases commonly present in a diving environment:

==== Argon ====
Argon (Ar) is an inert gas that is more narcotic than nitrogen, so is &quot;not&quot; generally suitable as a diving breathing gas. Argox is used for decompression research. It is sometimes used for dry suit inflation by divers whose primary breathing gas is helium-based, because of argon&#x27;s good thermal insulation properties. Argon is more expensive than air or oxygen, but considerably less expensive than helium. Argon is a component of natural air, and constitutes 0.934% by volume of the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere.

==== Carbon dioxide ====
Carbon dioxide (CO2) is produced by the metabolism in the human body and can cause carbon dioxide poisoning. When breathing gas is recycled in a rebreather or life support system, the carbon dioxide is removed by scrubbers before the gas is re-used.

==== Carbon monoxide ====
Carbon monoxide (CO) is a highly toxic gas that competes with dioxygen for binding to hemoglobin, thereby preventing the blood from carrying oxygen (see carbon monoxide poisoning). It is typically produced by incomplete combustion. Four common sources are:
* Internal combustion engine exhaust gas containing CO in the air being drawn into a diving air compressor. CO in the intake air cannot be stopped by any filter. The exhausts of all internal combustion engines running on petroleum fuels contain some CO, and this is a particular problem on boats, where the intake of the compressor cannot be arbitrarily moved as far as desired from the engine and compressor exhausts.
* Heating of lubricants inside the compressor may vaporize them sufficiently to be available to a compressor intake or intake system line.
* In some cases hydrocarbon lubricating oil may be drawn into the compressor&#x27;s cylinder directly through damaged or worn seals, and the oil may (and usually will) then undergo combustion, being ignited by the immense compression ratio and subsequent temperature rise. Since heavy oils don&#x27;t burn well – especially when not atomized properly – incomplete combustion will result in carbon monoxide production.
* A similar process is thought to potentially happen to any particulate material, which contains &quot;organic&quot; (carbon-containing) matter, especially in cylinders which are used for hyperoxic gas mixtures. If the compressor air filter(s) fail, ordinary dust will be introduced to the cylinder, which contains organic matter (since it usually contains humus). A more severe danger is that air particulates on boats and industrial areas, where cylinders are filled, often contain carbon-particulate combustion products (these are what makes a dirt rag black), and these represent a more severe CO danger when introduced into a cylinder.
Carbon monoxide is generally avoided as far as is reasonably practicable by positioning of the air intake in uncontaminated air, filtration of particulates from the intake air, use of suitable compressor design and appropriate lubricants, and ensuring that running temperatures are not excessive. Where the residual risk is excessive, a hopcalite catalyst can be used in the high pressure filter to convert carbon monoxide into carbon dioxide, which is far less toxic.

==== Hydrocarbons ====
Hydrocarbons (C&quot;x&quot;H&quot;y&quot;) are present in compressor lubricants and fuels. They can enter diving cylinders as a result of contamination, leaks, or due to incomplete combustion near the air intake.
* They can act as a fuel in combustion increasing the risk of explosion, especially in high-oxygen gas mixtures.
* Inhaling oil mist can damage the lungs and ultimately cause the lungs to degenerate with severe lipid pneumonia or emphysema.

=== Moisture content ===
The process of compressing gas into a diving cylinder removes moisture from the gas. This is good for corrosion prevention in the cylinder but means that the diver inhales very dry gas. The dry gas extracts moisture from the diver&#x27;s lungs while underwater contributing to dehydration, which is also thought to be a predisposing risk factor of decompression sickness. Evaporation in the lungs causes a significant heat loss. Dry gas is also uncomfortable, causing a dry mouth and throat and making the diver thirsty. This problem is reduced in rebreathers because the soda lime reaction, which removes carbon dioxide, also puts moisture back into the breathing gas, and the relative humidity and temperature of exhaled gas is relatively high and there is a cumulative effect due to rebreathing. In hot climates, open circuit diving can accelerate heat exhaustion because of dehydration. Another concern with regard to moisture content is the tendency of moisture to condense as the gas expands while passing through the regulator; this coupled with the extreme reduction in temperature, also due to the decompression, can cause the moisture to solidify as ice. This icing up in a regulator can cause moving parts to seize and the regulator to fail or free flow.
This is one of the reasons that scuba regulators are generally constructed from brass, and chrome plated (for protection). Brass, with its good thermal conductive properties, quickly conducts heat from the surrounding water to the cold, newly decompressed air, helping to prevent icing up.

=== Gas analysis ===

Gas mixtures must generally be analysed either in process or after blending for quality control. This is particularly important for breathing gas mixtures where errors can affect the health and safety of the end user. It is difficult to detect most gases that are likely to be present in diving cylinders because they are colourless, odourless and tasteless. Electronic sensors exist for some gases, such as oxygen analysers, helium analyser, carbon monoxide detectors and carbon dioxide detectors. Oxygen analysers are commonly found underwater in rebreathers. Oxygen and helium analysers are often used on the surface during gas blending to determine the percentage of oxygen or helium in a breathing gas mix. Chemical and other types of gas detection methods are not often used in recreational diving, but are used for periodic quality testing of compressed breathing air from diving air compressors.

===Breathing gas standards===
Standards for breathing gas quality are published by national and international organisations, and may be enforced in terms of legislation. In the UK, the Health and Safety Executive indicate that the requirements for breathing gases for divers are based on the BS EN 12021:2014.
The specifications are listed for oxygen compatible air, nitrox mixtures produced by adding oxygen, removing nitrogen, or mixing nitrogen and oxygen, mixtures of helium and oxygen (heliox), mixtures of helium, nitrogen and oxygen (trimix), and pure oxygen, for both open circuit and reclaim systems, and for high pressure and low pressure supply (above and below 40 bar supply).

Oxygen content is variable depending on the operating depth, but the tolerance depends on the gas fraction range, being ±0.25% for an oxygen fraction below 10% by volume, ±0.5% for a fraction between 10% and 20%, and ±1% for a fraction over 20%.

Water content is limited by risks of icing of control valves, and corrosion of containment surfaces – higher humidity is not a physiological problem – and is generally a factor of dew point.

Other specified contaminants are carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, oil, and volatile hydrocarbons, which are limited by toxic effects. Other possible contaminants should be analysed based on risk assessment, and the required frequency of testing for contaminants is also based on risk assessment.

In Australia breathing air quality is specified by Australian Standard 2299.1, Section 3.13 Breathing Gas Quality.

=== Diving gas blending ===

Gas blending (or gas mixing) of breathing gases for diving is the filling of gas cylinders with non-air breathing gas mixtures.
Filling cylinders with a mixture of gases has dangers for both the filler and the diver. During filling there is a risk of fire due to use of oxygen and a risk of explosion due to the use of high-pressure gases. The composition of the mix must be safe for the depth and duration of the planned dive. If the concentration of oxygen is too lean the diver may lose consciousness due to hypoxia and if it is too rich the diver may develop oxygen toxicity. The concentration of inert gases, such as nitrogen and helium, are planned and checked to avoid nitrogen narcosis and decompression sickness.

Methods used include batch mixing by partial pressure or by mass fraction, and continuous blending processes. Completed blends are analysed for composition for the safety of the user. Gas blenders may be required by legislation to prove competence if filling for other persons.

=== Density ===
Excessive density of a breathing gas can raise the work of breathing to intolerable levels, and can cause carbon dioxide retention at lower densities. Helium is used as a component to reduce density as well as to reduce narcosis at depth. Like partial pressure, density of a mixture of gases is in proportion to the volumetric fraction of the component gases, and absolute pressure. The ideal gas laws are adequately precise for gases at respirable pressures.

The density of a gas mixture at a given temperature and pressure can be calculated as:
:ρm = (ρ1 V1 + ρ2 V2 + .. + ρn Vn) / (V1 + V2 + ... + Vn)
where
:ρm = density of the gas mixture
:ρ1 ... ρn = density of each of the components
:V1 ... Vn = partial volume of each of the component gases

Since gas fraction Fi (volumetric fraction) of each gas can be expressed as Vi / (V1 + V2 + ... + Vn )

by substitution,
:ρm = (ρ1 F1 + ρ2 F2 + .. + ρn Fn)

== Hypobaric breathing gases ==

Breathing gases for use at reduced ambient pressure are used for high altitude flight in unpressurised aircraft, in space flight, particularly in space suits, and for high altitude mountaineering. In all these cases, the primary consideration is providing an adequate partial pressure of oxygen. In some cases the breathing gas has oxygen added to make up a sufficient concentration, and in other cases the breathing gas may be pure or nearly pure oxygen. Closed circuit systems may be used to conserve the breathing gas, which may be in limited supply – in the case of mountaineering the user must carry the supplemental oxygen, and in space flight the cost of lifting mass into orbit is very high.

== Medical breathing gases ==
Medical use of breathing gases other than air include oxygen therapy and anesthesia applications.

===Oxygen therapy===
Oxygen is required by people for normal cell metabolism. Air is typically 21% oxygen by volume. This is normally sufficient, but in some circumstances the oxygen supply to tissues is compromised.
Oxygen therapy, also known as supplemental oxygen, is the use of oxygen as a medical treatment. This can include for low blood oxygen, carbon monoxide toxicity, cluster headaches, and to maintain enough oxygen while inhaled anesthetics are given. Long term oxygen is often useful in people with chronically low oxygen such as from severe COPD or cystic fibrosis. Oxygen can be given in a number of ways including nasal cannula, face mask, and inside a hyperbaric chamber.
High concentrations of oxygen can cause oxygen toxicity such as lung damage or result in respiratory failure in those who are predisposed. It can also dry out the nose and increase the risk of fires in those who smoke. The target oxygen saturation recommended depends on the condition being treated. In most conditions a saturation of 94-98% is recommended, while in those at risk of carbon dioxide retention saturations of 88-92% are preferred, and in those with carbon monoxide toxicity or cardiac arrest the saturation should be as high as possible.
The use of oxygen in medicine become common around 1917. It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines. The cost of home oxygen is about US$150 a month in Brazil and US$400 a month in the United States. Home oxygen can be provided either by oxygen tanks or an oxygen concentrator. Oxygen is believed to be the most common treatment given in hospitals in the developed world.

===Anaesthetic gases===


The most common approach to general anaesthesia is through the use of inhaled general anesthetics. Each has its own potency which is correlated to its solubility in oil. This relationship exists because the drugs bind directly to cavities in proteins of the central nervous system, although several theories of general anaesthetic action have been described. Inhalational anesthetics are thought to exact their effects on different parts of the central nervous system. For instance, the immobilizing effect of inhaled anesthetics results from an effect on the spinal cord whereas sedation, hypnosis and amnesia involve sites in the brain.

An inhalational anaesthetic is a chemical compound possessing general anaesthetic properties that can be delivered via inhalation. Agents of significant contemporary clinical interest include volatile anaesthetic agents such as isoflurane, sevoflurane and desflurane, and anaesthetic gases such as nitrous oxide and xenon.

====Administration====
Anaesthetic gases are administered by anaesthetists (a term which includes anaesthesiologists, nurse anaesthetists, and anaesthesiologist assistants) through an anaesthesia mask, laryngeal mask airway or tracheal tube connected to an anaesthetic vaporiser and an anaesthetic delivery system.
The anaesthetic machine (UK English) or anesthesia machine (US English) or Boyle&#x27;s machine is used to support the administration of anaesthesia. The most common type of anaesthetic machine in use in the developed world is the continuous-flow anaesthetic machine, which is designed to provide an accurate and continuous supply of medical gases (such as oxygen and nitrous oxide), mixed with an accurate concentration of anaesthetic vapour (such as isoflurane), and deliver this to the patient at a safe pressure and flow. Modern machines incorporate a ventilator, suction unit, and patient monitoring devices. Exhaled gas is passed through a scrubber to remove carbon dioxide, and the anaesthetic vapour and oxygen are replenished as required before the mixture is returned to the patient.

<doc id="459474" wikidata="Q448733" url="?curid=459474" title="Operator associativity">
<text>In programming language theory, the associativity of an operator is a property that determines how operators of the same precedence are grouped in the absence of parentheses. If an operand is both preceded and followed by operators (for example, codice_1), and those operators have equal precedence, then the operand may be used as input to two different operations (i.e. the two operations indicated by the two operators). The choice of which operations to apply the operand to, is determined by the associativity of the operators. Operators may be associative (meaning the operations can be grouped arbitrarily), left-associative (meaning the operations are grouped from the left), right-associative (meaning the operations are grouped from the right) or non-associative (meaning operations cannot be chained, often because the output type is incompatible with the input types). The associativity and precedence of an operator is a part of the definition of the programming language; different programming languages may have different associativity and precedence for the same type of operator.

Consider the expression codice_2. If the operator codice_3 has left associativity, this expression would be interpreted as codice_4. If the operator has right associativity, the expression would be interpreted as codice_5. If the operator is non-associative, the expression might be a syntax error, or it might have some special meaning. Some mathematical operators have inherent associativity. For example, subtraction and division, as used in conventional math notation, are inherently left-associative. Addition and multiplication, by contrast, are both left and right associative. (e.g. codice_6).

Many programming language manuals provide a table of operator precedence and associativity; see, for example, the table for C and C++.

The concept of notational associativity described here is related to, but different from, the mathematical associativity. An operation that is mathematically associative, by definition requires no notational associativity. (For example, addition has the associative property, therefore it does not have to be either left associative or right associative.) An operation that is not mathematically associative, however, must be notationally left-, right-, or non-associative. (For example, subtraction does not have the associative property, therefore it must have notational associativity.)

== Examples ==

Associativity is only needed when the operators in an expression have the same precedence. Usually codice_7 and codice_8 have the same precedence. Consider the expression codice_9. The result could be either codice_10 or codice_11. The former result corresponds to the case when codice_7 and codice_8 are left-associative, the latter to when codice_7 and codice_8 are right-associative.

In order to reflect normal usage, addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operators are usually left-associative, while for an exponentiation operator (if present) there is no general agreement. Any assignment operators are typically right-associative. To prevent cases where operands would be associated with two operators, or no operator at all, operators with the same precedence must have the same associativity.

=== A detailed example ===

Consider the expression codice_16, in which codice_17 is taken to be a right-associative exponentiation operator. A parser reading the tokens from left to right would apply the associativity rule to a branch, because of the right-associativity of codice_17, in the following way:
# Term codice_19 is read.
# Nonterminal codice_17 is read. Node: &quot;codice_21&quot;.
# Term codice_22 is read. Node: &quot;codice_23&quot;.
# Nonterminal codice_17 is read, triggering the right-associativity rule. Associativity decides node: &quot;codice_25&quot;.
# Term codice_26 is read. Node: &quot;codice_27&quot;.
# Nonterminal codice_17 is read, triggering the re-application of the right-associativity rule. Node &quot;codice_29&quot;.
# Term codice_30 is read. Node &quot;codice_31&quot;. 
# No tokens to read. Apply associativity to produce parse tree &quot;codice_32&quot;.
This can then be evaluated depth-first, starting at the top node (the first codice_17):
# The evaluator walks down the tree, from the first, over the second, to the third codice_17 expression.
# It evaluates as: 3 = 9. The result replaces the expression branch as the second operand of the second codice_17.
# Evaluation continues one level up the parse tree as: 4 = . Again, the result replaces the expression branch as the second operand of the first codice_17. 
# Again, the evaluator steps up the tree to the root expression and evaluates as: 5 ≈ . The last remaining branch collapses and the result becomes the overall result, therefore completing overall evaluation.
A left-associative evaluation would have resulted in the parse tree codice_37 and the completely different result (625) = ≈ .

== Right-associativity of assignment operators ==

In many imperative programming languages, the assignment operator is defined to be right-associative, and assignment is defined to be an expression (which evaluates to a value), not just a statement. This allows chained assignment by using the value of one assignment expression as the right operand of the next assignment expression.

In C, the assignment codice_38 is an expression that evaluates to the same value as the expression codice_39 converted to the type of codice_40, with the side effect of storing the R-value of codice_39 into the L-value of codice_40. Therefore the expression codice_43 can be interpreted as codice_44. The alternative expression codice_45 raises an error because codice_38 is not an L-value expression, i.e. it has an R-value but not an L-value where to store the R-value of codice_47. The right-associativity of the codice_48 operator allows expressions such as codice_49 to be interpreted as codice_43.

In C++, the assignment codice_38 is an expression that evaluates to the same value as the expression codice_40, with the side effect of storing the R-value of codice_39 into the L-value of codice_40. Therefore the expression codice_43 can still be interpreted as codice_44. And the alternative expression codice_45 can be interpreted as codice_58 instead of raising an error. The right-associativity of the codice_48 operator allows expressions such as codice_49 to be interpreted as codice_43.

== Non-associative operators ==
Non-associative operators are operators that have no defined behavior when used in sequence in an expression. In Prolog the infix operator codice_62 is non-associative because constructs such as &quot;codice_63&quot; constitute syntax errors.

Another possibility is that sequences of certain operators are interpreted in some other way, which cannot be expressed as associativity. This generally means that syntactically, there is a special rule for sequences of these operations, and semantically the behavior is different. A good example is in Python, which has several such constructs. Since assignments are statements, not operations, the assignment operator does not have a value and is not associative. Chained assignment is instead implemented by having a grammar rule for sequences of assignments codice_49, which are then assigned left-to-right. Further, combinations of assignment and augmented assignment, like codice_65 are not legal in Python, though they are legal in C. Another example are comparison operators, such as codice_66, codice_67, and codice_68. A chained comparison like codice_69 is interpreted as codice_70, not equivalent to either codice_71 or codice_72.

<text>The European Car of the Year award is an international Car of the Year award established in 1964 by a collective of automobile magazines from different countries in Europe. The current organising media of the award are &quot;Auto&quot; (Italy), &quot;Autocar&quot; (United Kingdom), &quot;Autopista&quot; (Spain), &quot;Autovisie&quot; (Netherlands), &quot;L&#x27;Automobile Magazine&quot; (France), &quot;Stern&quot; (Germany) and &quot;Vi Bilägare&quot; (Sweden).

The voting jury consists of motoring journalists from publications throughout Europe. Representation from each country is based on the size of the country&#x27;s car market, and car manufacturing industry. There are no categories or class winners — the stated objective is to find a &quot;single, decisive winner&quot; among all competing cars. Since 1977, the jury gathers every late September at Hotel Tannishus in Tversted, Denmark to compare and test drive most of the eligible cars, an event also known as the &quot;Tannistest&quot;. Besides driving on public roads, the jury has the opportunity to do a moose test on Sindal Airport.

The 2025 European Car of the Year was announced on 10 January 2025, the winner being the Renault 5 E-Tech/Alpine A290.

==Current rules==
Eligible cars are new models released in the twelve months prior to the award. The award is not restricted to European cars, but nominees must be available in at least five European countries, and have expected sales of 5,000 a year.

Nominees are judged on the following criteria: design, comfort, safety, economy, handling, performance, functionality, environmental requirements, driver satisfaction and price. Technical innovation and value for money are also important factors.

A shortlist of seven cars is selected by a simple vote. For the final round of voting, each jury member has 25 points to distribute among the finalists. The points must be distributed to at least five cars, with no more than ten to any one car, and no joint top marks. The voting is open, and each jury member provides published justification for their vote distribution.

Under these rules, the decisiveness of the victory has varied greatly. For example, in 1988, the Peugeot 405 won by 212 points, the biggest gap in the history of the &quot;European Car of the Year&quot; competition; such feat was repeated in 2013, as the Mk VII Volkswagen Golf won by the same points gap. In 2010 the Volkswagen Polo won by a mere 10 points, received maximum points from twenty-five jurors, and was the top choice of 59.

The Renault Clio (1991, 2006), Volkswagen Golf (1992, 2013), Opel/Vauxhall Astra (1985, 2016), Toyota Yaris (2000, 2021) and Renault Scénic (1997, 2024) are the only cars to have won the award more than once.

In 2011, the Nissan Leaf was the first electrically-powered vehicle to be awarded &quot;Car of the Year&quot;.

==Current jury==
From 2024, the &quot;Car of The Year&quot; jury contains 60 journalists from 23 countries: six each from France, Germany, Italy, Spain and Great Britain, three from Austria, the Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland, two from Belgium, Hungary, Poland, Portugal and one each from the Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, Greece, Ireland, Luxembourg, Norway, Slovenia, Turkey and Romania.

In August 2024, it was announced that after almost 20 years, Romania once again has a member in the &quot;Car of The Year&quot; jury, Florin Micu, general editor of the &quot;Auto Expert&quot;, &quot;Auto Motor și Sport&quot; and &quot;Flote Auto&quot; magazines.

==Result==
===1960s===
British carmakers produced the first two winners of the award. The Rover 2000 saloon was the inaugural winner in 1964 while the Austin 1800 was victorious in 1965. The Rover won over another British contender, the rear-engine Hillman Imp.

The Renault 16 was the world&#x27;s first production hatchback car and won the award for 1966, having been launched at the beginning of 1965. A year later in 1967, the award went to the Fiat 124, which won more than twice as many as voted as its nearest competitor, the BMW 1600. Fiat missed out the following year 1968, however, when its 125 was pipped to the award by the revolutionary new NSU Ro80, one of the first production cars to feature a rotary engine.

Peugeot claimed the accolade for the first time with the 1969 award, which was won by its 504 saloon, a large family car which offered a high standard of interior comfort and build quality. 
===1970s===
The Fiat 128 was the next winner of the award in 1970, while a year in 1971 later the innovative new Citroën GS family saloon won the award.

Fiat became the first manufacturer to win the award for a third time when its 127 supermini won the 1972 title. The next winner of the award in 1973 was the Audi 80, and the 1974 award went to the Mercedes-Benz 450SE luxury saloon.

Despite financial problems which led to its takeover by Peugeot that year, Citroën won the accolade in 1975 with its flagship CX saloon, which fought off a strong challenge from the highly acclaimed Volkswagen Golf. Then came Chrysler Europe&#x27;s first winner of the award in 1976, the contemporary Simca 1307/1308 (Chrysler Alpine in the United Kingdom). Despite all the strife which troubled British Leyland throughout the 1970s, the state-owned carmaker achieved recognition for 1977 when its Rover 3500 executive car won the award. This was the last time a British marque would win the contest (discounting the Vauxhall models which were badge engineered Opels) – until the Jaguar I-Pace took the crown in 2019.

Sports cars have traditionally accounted for only a tiny percentage of car sales throughout Europe, but the European Car of the Year accolade was won by one for 1978, when the Porsche 928 sealed the award in the face of competition from the BMW 7 Series and Ford Granada.

Just before the sale of its European division to Peugeot, Chrysler achieved a success second in the contest with its Horizon, which won the 1979 award ahead of one of its main rivals, Fiat Ritmo/Strada. 
===1980s===
Lancia finally achieved recognition a year later in 1980 when its stylish new Delta hatchback was voted European Car of the Year.

Ford finally achieved success in the contest when the Escort MkIII, the first of that model line to feature front-wheel drive or a hatchback, sealed the award for 1981, fighting off competition from British Leyland&#x27;s crucial Austin Metro supermini and the Fiat Panda. A year later in 1982, the accolade was perhaps surprisingly won by the Renault 9, which managed to finish ahead of the more widely well regarded Opel Ascona C and the MK2 Volkswagen Polo. The 1983 award was won by the Audi 100, which narrowly finished ahead of the slightly smaller and similarly aerodynamic Ford Sierra.

The 1984 award saw two new superminis finish well ahead of the nearest contenders. The Fiat Uno was Fiat&#x27;s fourth success in the history of the award, finishing slightly ahead of the Peugeot 205. A year later in 1985, General Motors finally achieved recognition when its latest version of the Opel Kadett/Vauxhall Astra sealed it. Ford achieved a second victory in the 1986 contest with its new Scorpio/Granada flagship Which unsuccessful in the American market. General Motors made it two victories in three years when its own flagship model, the Opel Omega/Vauxhall Carlton, won the award for 1987.

19 years after the 504 gave Peugeot its first European Car of the Year, the French carmaker finally enjoyed its second triumph in the competition when its mid-range 405 saloon won the 1988 award by a wide margin. A year later in 1989, Fiat became the first manufacturer to win the award five times when its ground-breaking new Tipo achieved victory.
===1990s===
Citroën&#x27;s new XM flagship model won the award for 1990, with its French rival Renault scoring success a year later in 1991 with the new Clio supermini, which signalled the end for the iconic R5. With the award now nearly 30 years old, Volkswagen finally achieved recognition in 1992 when its MK3 Golf won the award, finishing ahead of two of its most important competitors – the Vauxhall/Opel Astra and Citroën ZX.

A non-European brand – with a British-built product – won the award for the first time for 1993, when the Nissan Micra earned top marks ahead of the Fiat Cinquecento (a car which helped the popularity of city cars in Europe to soar over the next few years) and Renault&#x27;s new flagship, the Safrane.

Ford achieved a third success in the competition with its Mondeo, successor to the Sierra, winning the award for 1994. Fiat increased its number of victories in the contest to six, when its new Punto supermini won the award for 1995, just as its Uno and 127 ancestors had done many years earlier. Fiat won the award two years in a row in 1996, when its Bravo/Brava range pipped the stylish Peugeot 406 to the honour.

Renault&#x27;s innovative compact MPV, the Scénic, won the European Car of the Year and Japan Import Car of the Year for 1997, while the Fiat subsidiary Alfa Romeo won the next year&#x27;s award for the first time with its 156 mid-range sports saloon in 1998.

Ford achieved a fourth success in the contest when its boldly-styled Focus won the 1999 award, fighting off competition from the latest Vauxhall/Opel Astra as well as Peugeot&#x27;s stylish 206 supermini. 
===2000s===
In 2000, a Japanese manufacturer – this time with a Japanese-built product – won the award when the Toyota Yaris Hatchback and Yaris Verso Mini MPV earned top marks in Car of the Year Japan and European Car of the Year ahead of the boldly-styled Fiat Multipla and the practical Vauxhall/Opel Zafira compact MPV.

Alfa Romeo&#x27;s modern revival continued when its stylish 147 won the award for 2001, with the next winner in 2002 being the Peugeot 307. It was another French success for 2003, when the second generation Renault Megane was the winner.

Fiat achieved its eighth success in the contest when its all-new Panda won the 2004 award. Toyota made it two victories from six years when its radical Prius hybrid won the 2005 award. The Renault Clio became the first model to win the award twice when the third generation of the popular supermini won it for 2006, having previously won in 1991.

Ford&#x27;s stylish and practical S-Max won the 2007 award, fighting off a close challenge from the Vauxhall/Opel Corsa, earlier versions of which had been largely overlooked by the contest&#x27;s judges.

Fiat made in nine victories in the contest when it won the 2008 award with the 500 model, a retro-styled take on its iconic small car which had first been launched 50 years earlier. In 2009, the next award went to a more traditional and mainstream offering, when Vauxhall/Opel won the award for only the third time with its Insignia.
===2010s===
The Volkswagen Polo supermini had been around in several forms since its launch in the mid-1970s, but the all-new version launched in 2009 was the first generation of Polo to win the award in 2010, and the second Volkswagen model to win the award.

Then came two years of success for battery electric cars, with the British-built Nissan Leaf and United States-built (Opel) Vauxhall Ampera/Chevrolet Volt winning the 2011 and 2012 award respectively.

The Volkswagen Golf (having previously won in 1992) then joined the Renault Clio with the distinction of two wins in the contest when the MK7 version won the 2013 award. One of the Golf&#x27;s key rivals, the Peugeot 308, was the next winner in 2014. A year later in 2015, the Volkswagen Passat was awarded. In 2016, the Opel/Vauxhall Astra, another key rival to the Golf, became the third automobile to win the award twice, having previously won in 1985.

In 2017, Peugeot won with the fifth time with the crossover 3008, marking the first time an SUV winning the award.

The 2018 winner is for a Swedish manufacturer for the first time in the history of the competition, with the Volvo XC40 winning.

For the first time in the award&#x27;s history, the Jaguar I-Pace and Alpine A110 both scored a tie with 250 points. Therefore, the winner had to be determined by the number of first place votes. The 2019 winner was the Jaguar with 18 votes compared to the Alpine with 16 votes. This mark the first time Jaguar wins the award, despite Jaguar&#x27;s retail sales worldwide started to decline since 2019.
===2020s===
In 2020, the Peugeot 208 won the award at the 2020 Geneva Motor Show, despite the 2020 event cancellation due to the COVID-19 pandemic and Switzerland&#x27;s decision to impose a limit on gatherings of over 1,000 people.

For first time in ten years, the 2021 award was not announced at the Geneva Motor Show, again due to the event cancellation because of the COVID-19 pandemic and this continued for the next two consecutive years. The 2021 winner was the Toyota Yaris becoming the fourth model to win the award twice, having previously won in 2000. 

Kia&#x27;s first model under their EV nomenclature system for battery electric cars, the EV6, won the 2022 award, marking the first time in history a Korean manufacturer winning the award. The next winner in 2023 was the Jeep Avenger, marketed primarily for the European market and mark the first time Jeep wins the award.

In 2024, the award was held for the final time at the Geneva Motor Show before the event cancellation indefinitely. The 2024 winner was the Renault Scenic E-Tech become the fifth model to win the award twice, having previously won in 1997. Although, the Scenic E-Tech is a battery electric crossover SUV, compared to the 1997 winner being an MPV powered by internal combustion engines. Since the cancellation of the Geneva Motor Show, the next year winner was announced at the Brussels Motor Show. The 2025 winner was the Renault 5 E-Tech, therefore Renault won the award for the second year in a row.

<text>The Walker Art Gallery is an art gallery in Liverpool, which houses one of the largest art collections in England outside London. It is part of the National Museums Liverpool group.

==History==
The Walker Art Gallery&#x27;s collection dates from 1819 when the Liverpool Royal Institution acquired 37 paintings from the collection of William Roscoe, who had to sell his collection following the failure of his banking business, though it was saved from being broken up by his friends and associates.

In 1843, the Royal Institution&#x27;s collection was displayed in a purpose-built gallery next to the Institution&#x27;s main premises. In 1850 negotiations by an association of citizens to take over the Institution&#x27;s collection, for display in a proposed art gallery, library and museum, came to nothing.

The collection grew over the following decades: in 1851 Liverpool Town Council bought Liverpool Academy&#x27;s diploma collection and further works were acquired from the Liverpool Society for the Fine Arts, founded in 1858. The competition between the academy and society eventually led to both collapsing.

William Brown Library and Museum opened in 1860, named after a Liverpool merchant whose generosity enabled the Town Council to act upon an 1852 Act of Parliament which allowed the establishment of a public library, museum and art gallery, and in 1871 the council organised the first Liverpool Autumn Exhibition, held at the new library and museum.

The success of the exhibition enabled the Library, Museum and Arts Committee to purchase works for the council&#x27;s permanent collection, buying around 150 works between 1871 and 1910. Works acquired included WF Yeames&#x27; &quot;And when did you last see your father?&quot; and Dante Gabriel Rossetti&#x27;s &quot;Dante&#x27;s Dream&quot;.

Designed by local architects Cornelius Sherlock and H. H. Vale, the Walker Art Gallery was opened on 6 September 1877 by Edward Henry Stanley, 15th Earl of Derby. It is named after its founding benefactor, Sir Andrew Barclay Walker (1824–1893), a former mayor of Liverpool and wealthy brewer born in Ayrshire who expanded the family business to England and moved to live in Gateacre.

In 1893, the Liverpool Royal Institution placed its collection on long-term loan to the gallery and in 1948 presented William Roscoe&#x27;s collection and other works. This occurred during post-war reconstruction when the gallery was closed, re-opening in 1951. During the Second World War the gallery was taken over by the Ministry of Food and the collection was dispersed for safety.

Extensions to the gallery were opened in 1884 and 1933 (following a two-year closure) when the gallery re-opened with an exhibition including Picasso and Gauguin. In 2002 the gallery re-opened following a major refurbishment.

In 1986, the gallery achieved national status, as part of the National Museums and Galleries on Merseyside.

The gallery is housed in a neo-Classical building located on William Brown Street. The neighbouring area includes the William Brown Library, World Museum Liverpool, St. George&#x27;s Hall, Wellington&#x27;s Column, Lime Street Station and the entrance to the Queensway Tunnel. The other major art gallery in Liverpool is Tate Liverpool, at the Albert Dock, which houses modern art.

==Permanent collection==

The Walker&#x27;s collection includes Italian and Netherlandish paintings from 1300 to 1550, European art from 1550 to 1900, including works by Giambattista Pittoni, Rembrandt, Poussin and Degas, 18th and 19th-century British art, including a major collection of Victorian painting and many Pre-Raphaelite works, a wide collection of prints, drawings and watercolours, 20th-century works by artists such as Lucian Freud, David Hockney and Gilbert and George and a major sculpture collection. The select collection of minor or decorative arts covers a wide range, from Gothic ivories to British ceramics up to the present day. The Gallery also houses the only original Stuart Sutcliffe painting on permanent display in Liverpool.

On 17 December 2011, the Walker Art Gallery got a new addition to its collection – a statue of a priest vandalised by Banksy. The renowned graffiti artist has sawn off the face of an 18th-century replica stone bust and glued on a selection of bathroom tiles. The resulting &#x27;pixellated&#x27; portrait is entitled &quot;Cardinal Sin&quot; and is believed to be a comment on the abuse scandal in the Church and its subsequent cover-up. This piece of art is displayed in Room three, which is one of the 17th-century Old Master galleries.

As of 2 July 2013, the &quot;La Masseuse&quot; sculpture by Edgar Degas, previously owned by Lucian Freud, found a permanent home at the Walker Art Gallery, thanks to the donation-in-payment system put in place by the Arts Council England.

==Exhibitions==
The first John Moores Contemporary Painting Prize exhibition was held in 1957. Sponsored by Sir John Moores, founder of Littlewoods, the competition has been held every two years ever since and is the biggest painting prize in the UK.

There is a regular programme of temporary exhibitions which in 2009-10 has included Aubrey Williams, Bridget Riley, Sickert and Freud.

In 2004, the gallery staged &quot;The Stuckists Punk Victorian&quot;, the first national museum exhibition of the Stuckist art movement. The Gallery also takes part in the Liverpool Biennial.

<text>Baron Darcy de Knayth is a title in the Peerage of England. It was created in 1332 for John Darcy (or D&#x27;Arcy) with remainder to his heirs general, allowing daughters to inherit.

At the death of the sixth baron, the barony fell into abeyance between his two daughters, which the Sovereign terminated in 1641 in favour of Conyers Darcy, as he was also an heir of the abeyant Barony Darcy de Darcy (created 1509). He also successfully petitioned for the termination of the abeyance of the Barony of Conyers in his favour, and both baronies were considered new creations, with remainder to his heirs male. He was called to parliament as Baron Darcy and Conyers.

His son, also named Conyers Darcy, was granted the title of Earl of Holderness. The two titles remained united until the death of the fourth earl, when the earldom became extinct, while the baronies were claimed by his daughter, Lady Amelia. Lady Amelia was briefly married to the future fifth Duke of Leeds, and the sixth and seventh Dukes held the baronies &quot;de jure&quot;.

At the death of the seventh Duke of Leeds in 1859, the two baronies separated from the dukedom. Sackville Lane-Fox, eldest son of the 7th Duke of Leeds&#x27; eldest daughter, claimed the baronies &quot;de jure&quot;, which again became abeyant upon his death in 1888. The abeyance for the Barony of Conyers was terminated in 1892 in favour of Lane-Fox&#x27;s eldest daughter Marcia Pelham, Countess of Yarborough. On 29 September 1903, the abeyance of the Barony of Darcy de Knayth was terminated in favour of Lane-Fox&#x27;s younger daughter, Violet Herbert, Countess of Powis. At the same time, the 1641 ruling, considering the titles new creations only for the heirs male of Conyers Darcy, was reversed, and it was ruled that both baronies were to be held in remainder for heirs general.

<text>A ticker-tape parade is a parade event held in an urban setting, characterized by large amounts of shredded paper thrown onto the parade route from the surrounding buildings, creating a celebratory flurry of paper. Originally, actual ticker tape was used; however, now it is commonly substituted with confetti. 

The concept originates in and is most usually associated with the United States, especially New York City. Outside the United States, ticker-tape parades are often associated with the 1978 FIFA World Cup held in Argentina.

==History==
The term originated in New York City after a spontaneous celebration held on October 28, 1886, during the dedication of the Statue of Liberty and is still most closely associated with New York City. The term &quot;ticker tape&quot; originally referred to the use of the paper output of ticker-tape machines, which were remotely driven devices used in brokerages to provide updated stock market quotes. The term &quot;ticker&quot; came from the sound made by the machine as it printed.

In New York City, ticker-tape parades are reserved for special occasions. Soon after the first such parade in 1886, city officials realized the utility of such events and began to hold them on triumphal occasions, such as the return of Theodore Roosevelt from his African safari, Gertrude Ederle swimming the English Channel, and Charles Lindbergh&#x27;s trans-Atlantic flight. The first individual to be honored with a ticker-tape parade was Admiral George Dewey, hero of the battle of Manila Bay, in 1899, when two million people came out to New York City. Following World War II, several ticker-tape parades were given in honor of victorious generals and admirals, including General Dwight D. Eisenhower and Admiral Chester Nimitz. Two of the longest and largest ticker-tape parades were given for World War II and Korean War General Douglas MacArthur in 1951, after he was relieved of duty by President Harry S. Truman, and for astronaut John Glenn in 1962. Golfing greats Bobby Jones (1921 and 1930) and Ben Hogan (1953) were honored with ticker-tape parades after their British Open triumphs.

The section of lower Broadway through the Financial District that serves as the parade route for these events is colloquially called the &quot;Canyon of Heroes&quot;. More than 200 black granite strips embedded in the sidewalks along the Canyon of Heroes list honorees of past ticker-tape parades. By the early 21st century, such parades became far more infrequent, largely limited to championship sports teams, and celebrations of the return of astronauts and military troops.

Ticker tape technology became obsolete in the 1960s, as television and computers came into use for transmitting financial information. Modern parades utilize waste office paper and toilet paper that have been cut using conventional paper shredders. The city also distributes paper confetti.

<doc id="459502" wikidata="Q500912" url="?curid=459502" title="Sturmtruppen">
<text>Sturmtruppen is a successful Italian series of anti-war comic books written and drawn by Bonvi, the artistic pseudonym of Franco Bonvicini. It started as four-frame comic strips back in 1968 and evolved into fully sized collector books by the 1990s. The series continued until the early 2000s.

== Subject ==
&quot;Sturmtruppen&quot; concerns the misadventures of an anonymous German army unit (which is implied to be a battalion) in various war theatres of World War II, by portraying the daily life, sufferings, problems and joys of the average, anonymous soldier. The Sturmtruppen never see a single enemy soldier in the course of decades of comic strips, though the enemy&#x27;s presence is felt through sniper- tank- and artillery fire, whose lethal effects rake all too often through the ranks of the Sturmtruppen&#x27;s forgotten soldiers.

The series never explicitly mentioned that the war being fought is actually World War II, since no specific date is ever mentioned. There are, however, occasional references to specific battle theaters, place names as well as the mostly accurate portrayal of vehicles, weapons and uniforms of the period. Several deliberate anachronisms such as mentions of the Kaiser appear throughout the series, giving the impression that the war in question wages on endlessly, and that the stories told could be, in fact, referring to &quot;any&quot; war.

=== Language ===
A trademark of the comic is the use of an improper, German-mocking Italian, usually achieved by adding a final &quot;-en&quot; to most Italian words, or by exchanging &quot;q&quot;s with &quot;k&quot;s, and &quot;v&quot;s with &quot;f&quot;s to achieve a &quot;German-sounding&quot; Italian.

=== Themes ===
The stories and characters themselves are based partly on the military experience of the author himself, and partly on military literature (Remarque&#x27;s &quot;All Quiet on the Western Front&quot;, Guy Sajer&#x27;s The Forgotten Soldier, Sven Hassel&#x27;s books, etc...), folklore and of course stereotypes. Bonvi was also an expert in World War II German uniforms and equipment and, despite some cartoonish deformations, all of the Sturmtruppen hardware is historically faithful: from iconic objects and vehicles (MP40, Stielhandgranaten, personal harnesses, kubelwagens, stukas), to more obscure and esoteric weapons (like Brummbar assault guns).

The subject of the stories themselves carry a lot of criticism against war and the absurdity of military bureaucracy and mentality and (also by references to Joseph Heller&#x27;s &quot;Catch-22&quot; and to Robert Altman&#x27;s &quot;M*A*S*H&quot;) also the message that &quot;civilian&quot; life isn&#x27;t much different from military life, disguised. But criticism can subtly extend to today life&#x27;s aspects, including TV predominance, class divisions and Roman Church&#x27;s dogma.

The monologue of an anonymous soldier muttering to himself:

:&quot;Kuesta maledetta najen dovrà pur finiren. Ne ho piene le tasken di dofer dire &#x27;Signorsì&#x27; a un kvalsiasi graduaten. Non fedo l&#x27;oren di ridifentaren un cifilen kvalsiasi e poter diren &#x27;Sissignore&#x27; a un kvalsiasi superioren&quot;,

which can be translated (preserving the Pseudo-Germanisms) more or less as:

:&quot;Zis damned military service vill haff to end sometime. I&#x27;ve grown tired of hafing to say &#x27;sir yes&#x27; to anyone with a higher ranken. I kan barely vait to return to being an anonymous civilian and being able to zay &#x27;Yes,sir&#x27; to any of my superiors...&quot;

This gives a clear idea of the black humour and Kafkaesque atmosphere of this comic book.

== Characters ==

Most characters don&#x27;t have proper names but, rather, are called by their military rank or position. Most simple soldiers are given generic &quot;German&quot; names such as Otto, Franz, Fritz, etc. Recurring characters include:

*The &quot;Sergenten&quot; (Sergeant), a cruel veteran completely absorbed into the system and obsessed with &quot;duty&quot; and &quot;discipline&quot;. He frequently abuses his position by beating up soldiers for no reason and using them as living barbed wire poles and barricades, ordering them to run into a minefield or to remove their gas masks in the middle of a gas attack to &quot;check out if it&#x27;s safe&quot;, etc. Although he is referred to as a Sergeant, his arm rank chevrons are those of a Wehrmacht obergefreiter, which would be equivalent to a conscript corporal and not a feldwebel.
*The &quot;Kapitanen&quot; (Captain) is sometimes one of the few characters representing sanity in an otherwise completely insane environment. He usually stays calm and rational even when dealing with the most bizarre and peculiar (or hilarious) situations. However, he is also hopelessly tied to the system and unable to think outside it. He is also easily drawn to dangerous tasks in order to advance his rank (the dangers are of course for the soldiers only). Even if he is just a Captain, he is often mentioned as commanding a battalion. Rarely, throughout the series his commanded unit is mentioned as being the &quot;3rd Battalion&quot;. His character is also one of the most variable throughout the series, to adapt to new situations. Most of the time he is portrayed as no-nonsense, grumpy and distanced from his subordinates, while at the other extreme he has been portrayed as a chronic alcoholic with disregard even for personal danger, caring for his soldiers even after his death. When more than one higher officer were present in the same strip they ALL shared the same features (hawkish nose, taller stature, eyes obscured by the cap&#x27;s visor) as if to reinforce Bonvi&#x27;s &#x27;class warfare&#x27; statement that &#x27;superiors&#x27; are a kind of &#x27;separate race&#x27; from &#x27;common people&#x27;.
*The &quot;Mediken Militaren&quot; (Military Medic), a Major of the medical corps who had actually studied as a veterinarian, but because &quot;...animals refused to be treated by him, he was assigned to the closest human category: the soldiers.&quot; From time to time the doctor becomes obsessed with things such as vampires, researching the elixir of invisibility or some &quot;revolutionary&quot; battlefield medicine procedure, usually at the expense of the poor soldiers and his fellow officers. His rank of Major is rarely ever mentioned in the series, with the most famous case being the episode with Captain asking for the doctor&#x27;s urgent recovery in a psychiatric clinic due to his obsession with invisibility, only to be reminded by the higher command that &quot;Since the doctor has a higher rank than him, he has the right to consider himself invisible as he wishes&quot;.
*The &quot;Sottotenenten di Komplementen&quot; (Complement Second Lieutenant), an incompetent young officer who has obtained his rank through nepotism and bureaucracy inside the army itself. While he willingly offers to carry out the most dangerous and responsible tasks to prove himself, he usually ends up failing miserably.
*The so-called Italian ally, &quot;Il Fiero Alleaten Galeazzo Musolesi&quot; (The Fierce Ally Galeazzo Musolesi), with a name clearly mocking both Benito Mussolini and Galeazzo Ciano. The character is a dishonest and cowardly man always trying to steal from and take advantage of his &quot;allies&quot;, willing to perform any task as long as it&#x27;s not too hard and he can somehow cheat on it. He also has strange fixations like posing in front of the enemy in order to &quot;demoralize them&quot; (but only when the enemy lines are to his back) or cultivating small &quot;war gardens&quot; with vegetables. His name derives from a prank Bonvi played in high school when he wrote a letter to a local paper pretending to be a World War I veteran and signing it &quot;Galeazzo Musolesi&quot;.
*The prostitute (oft referred as &quot;Lili Marlenen&quot; in a nod to the famous Lili Marleen) is a leggy beauty (very 70-ish in appearance) clad in a trenchcoat and leaning to a bomb-distorted lamp-post. She&#x27;s naturally ready to sell out her services to anyone but also has a naive and good-natured &quot;admirer&quot; who constantly brings her flowers and chocolates instead of the money she demands.
*The &quot;Kuoken Militaren&quot; (Military Cook) is the battalion&#x27;s cook, always being criticized for the quality of his food and usually having to deal with an eternal lack of food and supplies or administration problems. These problems usually result in him serving horrible food such as dried peas instead of pea soup &quot;because there&#x27;s no water&quot;, frozen soup, soup made of motor oil and boiled tires, or even from dirty laundry water. At one point there is a meat shortage, but the shortage is resolved after the mysterious disappearance of several young soldiers... The cook is also in constant battle with the &quot;Sergenten&quot; and the &quot;Proud Ally&quot; who always try to either sabotage his kitchen or steal his food. Common running jokes in the series involve the cook&#x27;s experiments with &quot;foods&quot; such as pieces of cadavers or even Frankenstein-like ingredients that actually become alive and attack the soldiers.
*The &quot;Alleaten del Sol Levante&quot; (The Ally from the Rising Sun) is a clear satire of the Japanese soldier, partly based on stereotypes such as a self-sacrificing attitude, sense of honor, etcetera. He is also portrayed as a sex maniac and exchanges racist taunts with Musolesi, whom he despises. Because of his short stature, for a long time he is believed to be the son of a gay couple of German soldiers.
*The 27th Armoured Battalion (of Discipline) is a duo of hardened veterans who embody Bonvi&#x27;s homage to Sven Hassel picturesque war novels. The unkempt, tough-as-nails grognards are the only soldiers not to be intimidated by the cruel sergeant and often manage to scare him away. They spend time defusing aircraft bombs with impromptu equipment (such as bottle-openers) and telling colorful anecdotes of their previous experiences in penal units and military jails (often lifted &#x27;as-is&#x27; from Hassel&#x27;s novels).
*The &quot;Uffizialen Superioren&quot; (Superior Officers) represent the remote source of supreme authority, which occasionally materializes as colonels, generals or other inspecting officers. In one series, an aging general finds himself stripped off his uniform and, by extension, of all his authority and might. He is rudely treated as a senile old man, until he manages to get his uniform back, along with all his respect and authority.
*The SS execution squad and the Jew are one of the many examples of dark humour in Sturmtruppen: the SS must &quot;exterminate&quot; the Jew, but they are so bad at shooting that they always miss; the SS commander blames the Jew for moving. On his side, the Jew is very collaborative, trying to cheer up the SS commander when he suffers a nervous breakdown by telling him the details of his execution and cremation.
*The &quot;Eroiken Portaferiten&quot; (combat medics) are tasked with recovering wounded soldiers from the battlefield with their stretcher. However, they are often clumsy and end up aggravating the conditions of the wounded themselves, when they are not actually looting the fallen and wounded for golden watches, golden teeth, wallets, et cetera.
*Private &quot;Bekkinen Franz&quot; (Undertaker Franz) is the battalion&#x27;s undertaker, with the grim task of burying the dead. Doing so has turned himself into a grim, insensitive man, down to the point of interpreting the noise and complaints made by men buried still alive as &quot;interference with his work&quot; and &quot;disrespect for the defunct&quot;.
*&quot;Soldaten Humbert&quot; (Private Humbert) is a caveman-like soldier covered in a thick fur and having very poor personal hygiene and revolting habits, taken to grotesque extremes such as eating his own lice, forcing anyone near him to wear a gas mask, and eating with his bare hands claiming that &quot;this way, flies stick to the fingers and don&#x27;t enter the mouth&quot;. He is implied to never have bathed in his life (but this is also implied of the &quot;Sergenten&quot;), and an attempt to shave off his fur results in him disappearing under a large pile of hair, raising doubts as to his actually being human. He often is shown as only capable of grunting and screaming, but in some strips he can talk normally and drive a motorcycle.
*&quot;Soldaten Sigfried von Nibelunghen&quot; (Private Sigfried von Nibelunghen) is a young recruit who proudly admits having falsified his birth certificate in order to enlist voluntarily. He eagerly volunteers to perform all sorts of dangerous or tedious tasks, such as accepting &quot;the extraordinary honour&quot; of performing five consecutive watch turns, or laying minefields blindfolded so that &quot;even under torture, he would not be able to give the mines&#x27; positions away to the enemy&quot;. He also pesters the Captain to order an attack on a sun-bathed field of golden crops, so that he can die a &quot;heroic death&quot;. He falls victim to one of his own mines, and loses all ability to communicate, rendering him a prisoner in his own body. In the end, as he considers the harsh reality of his condition against the idealized vision of war he had been led to believe, he thinks to himself, &quot;I fear that I have been duped&quot;.

== Film adaptations ==
&quot;Sturmtruppens success spurred two cinema adaptations. The first one, &quot;Sturmtruppen&quot; (1976), was co-written by Bonvicini and directed by Salvatore Samperi. In 1982 a sequel, &#x27;, was released, again directed by Samperi and featuring Renato Pozzetto, Massimo Boldi and Teo Teocoli. Bonvi had a small part as a German officer.

On 16 August 2006 Miramax moved forward with plans to create a live-action movie based on &quot;Sturmtruppen&quot;.

==Videogame adaptations==

There has been only one officially licensed video game based on the &quot;Sturmtruppen&quot; comics, on the Amiga platform, called &quot;&quot; published by the Italian software publisher iDea in 1992. The game was not critically well received, getting a 44% score by &quot;Amiga Joker&quot; magazine in November 1992, and 3/5 stars from &quot;Amiga Power&quot; in 1994.

<text>Indoor soccer or arena soccer is a form of five-a-side or six-a-side version of minifootball. It is derived from association football and adapted to be played in walled hardcourt indoor arena. It is a different sport to the FIFA-sanctioned indoor football sport of Futsal.

Indoor soccer, as it is most often known in the United States and Canada, was originally developed in these two countries as a way to play soccer during the winter months, when snow would make outdoor play difficult. In those countries, gymnasiums are adapted for indoor soccer play. In other countries the game is played in either indoor or outdoor arenas surrounded by walls, and is referred to by different names (such as &quot;fast football&quot; (&quot;futbol rapido&quot;) in Mexico, &quot;Futebol Society&quot; or &quot;showbol&quot; in Brazil, and &quot;indoor football&quot; (&quot;futbol indoor&quot;) in Spain).

Indoor soccer has different regulations from other versions of association football designed for indoor play, such as futsal and five-a-side football. Unlike futsal, which is played on wooden or ceramic surfaces, indoor soccer is played on synthetic turf (or, in the case of the British Masters Football variety, synthetic carpet). Indoor soccer courts are either delimited by walls or lines, and there are no player throw-ins.
FIFA, the international body that oversees international association football competitions, does not sanction the synthetic turf version of indoor soccer, having developed its own code of indoor football (which they refer to as futsal).

Indoor soccer is most popular in the United States, Canada, and Mexico, with several amateur, collegiate and professional leagues functioning. While internationally less popular than futsal, indoor soccer is also played at the league level in many countries outside North America. The World Minifootball Federation (WMF) is the governing body of indoor soccer at the international level, having replaced the International Fast Football Federation (FIFRA).

The term &quot;minifootball&quot;, which was originally coined in Europe, has been adopted by the WMF as a standard international name for the sport.

== Around the world ==
===International competitions===
Indoor soccer is played throughout the world. Currently, the international federation dedicated to promoting the sport is the World Minifootball Federation (WMF) based in Switzerland. The WMF replaced the International Fast Football Federation (FIFRA), which had been based in Mexico and later, the United States. There are also regional federations who govern the sport including: African Minifootball Federation (AMF), Asian Minifootball Confederation (AMC), Confederación Panamericana de Minifútbol (CPM), European Minifootball Federation (EMF), Oceania Minifootball Federation (OMF).

Before Futsal was overseen by FIFA, the first Futsal World Champion was held in São Paulo, Brazil. This competition took place in 1982 and was conducted by the FIFUSA (before FIFA). Brazil came in first in the first Futsal World Tournament (1982) and the second Futsal World Tournament (1985). FIFA overtook this championship in 1989 and renamed the competition the FIFA Futsal World Championship.

During its existence, FIFRA organized several indoor soccer tournaments for national teams, including the Indoor Soccer World Championship. The only edition of this tournament took place in Mexico in 1997. No other world championship was played until 2015, when the first WMF World Cup was held in the United States. As of 2019 three WMF World Cups have been organized, with Mexico being the current world champion. A World Cup for Under-21 players was held in Prague in 2018, with the Czech team taking the title. A World Cup for women is planned for 2021 in Kyiv, Ukraine.

Star Sixes, an indoor six-a-side football tournament for national teams from around the world, was held in the O2 Arena in London in 2017. Held outside the auspices of the WMF, this tournament featured players which formerly played in the association football national teams of their home countries. A total of twelve teams participated, with France winning the title. It is intended to make Star Sixes a recurring event; a second edition took place in 2019, with England winning the title.

===United States and Canada===
Indoor soccer is a common sport in the United States and especially Canada and you can read differences like Indoor Soccer Vs Futsal in detail, with both amateur and professional leagues, due to the short season for outdoor soccer in Canada and the Northern United States, and the ubiquity of arenas built for ice hockey and basketball which can easily be converted to indoor soccer (similar reasons as to why indoor lacrosse is more popular in Canada, field lacrosse in the United States). Indoor soccer is especially popular in Northern Canada due to the often unplayable outdoor conditions and its appearance in the Arctic Winter Games.

The United States Indoor Soccer Association was founded in 1998. USIndoor soccer oversees all indoor soccer sports as well as &quot;arena soccer&quot; and &quot;Futsal&quot; in the United States.

Major Arena Soccer League is the top indoor soccer league in North America.

===Mexico===
Indoor soccer or futbol rapido has also become a popular sport in Mexico, being included as part of the &quot;Universiada&quot; (University National Games) and the &quot;CONADEIP&quot; (Private School Tournament), in which university school teams from all over Mexico compete. In Mexico, &quot;indoor&quot; soccer fields are frequently built outdoors (though indoor courts are also used in some tournaments). In 2012 an eight-team indoor soccer league was launched, which consists of former professional association football players from Liga MX.

===South America===
Indoor soccer is known in Brazil as &quot;showbol&quot;, with several current regional leagues. Formal national leagues have also been formed in Bolivia, Colombia, Uruguay, Ecuador and Peru. However, the most common variations of indoor soccer played in Brazil are futsal but also .

===Europe===
Indoor soccer is also played in several European countries. In the United Kingdom, Masters Football is the most well-known competition. Tournaments among Masters teams (consisting of veteran former players from professional 11-a-side teams from each country) are regularly played. In Spain, some over-30 ex-professionals represent their clubs in the Liga Fertiberia which plays a five-a-side variant.

The European indoor soccer federation, known as the European Minifootball Federation (EMF), organizes the European Minifootball Championship (miniEURO) every year, and in recent years countries have established national minifootball associations. EMF organize variations of six-a-side football and this could come in different shapes and sizes from a large custom-built facility with multiple pitches or even an 11-a-side pitch temporarily split into smaller pitches. This is not to be confused with the term used in Russia and some other former Soviet countries, where the term mini-football is used to describe futsal.

===Australia===
Indoor soccer&#x27;s journey within Australia can be traced back to its emergence as a response to challenges posed by weather conditions and limited outdoor space. As the sport gained traction, purpose-built indoor facilities started to dot the Australian landscape, offering players a controlled environment where they could indulge in their passion year-round.

==Rules==

Rules vary between governing bodies, but some of the nearly universal rule deviations from association football include:

* The Field. Most indoor soccer arenas are rectangular or oblong in shape, with artificial turf floors. In many collegiate intramural leagues, the game may be played on basketball courts, in which case the floor is hardwood. Walls (often the hockey dasher boards and plexiglas used for that sport) bound the arena. Field sizes are generally smaller than soccer fields, and the goals are recessed into the walls. Goals are also smaller than in standard soccer and the penalty area is also smaller. The field is commonly 200&#x27; by 85&#x27; (approx 61m by 26m), the regulation size for a hockey rink in North America.
* Duration. Most indoor soccer games are divided into four quarters of 15 minutes each, for a total of 60 minutes of play time. There are two 3-minute periods between the first and second, third and fourth quarters and one 15-minute half-time between the second and third quarters. If the game stays tied until the time runs out, there will be extra 15-minute, golden goal overtime periods. However, amateur leagues generally consist of two 25-minute halves with no overtime for tied games. In Futsal, each team may announce one timeout per half consisting of one minute each. Also, there is no added times for injuries, overtime, or stoppage time.
* The team. Most indoor soccer games are played with six active players per team including goalkeeper and either defense or forward also known as attackers and strikers. Substitute players are permitted. At high levels of play, it is common for players to move fluidly between positions instead of staying statically in one position. 
* Play off of walls. The ball may be struck in such a way that it contacts one or more walls without penalty or stoppage. If the ball flies over the walls or contacts the ceiling, play is stopped and the team opposing the one that most recently touched the ball is awarded a free kick at the location where the ball left the arena or made contact with the ceiling.
* Contact rules. Standard contact rules generally apply (i.e. ball contact must be made during a play on the ball, no charging with hands or elbows, no charging from behind, no holding the opponent etc.). Many leagues ban the use of the sliding tackle, though such techniques are less useful on artificial turf or wood than they are on a slick natural turf field. If one attempts to slide on an indoor field, painful burns and/or cuts can occur.
* No offside. Most leagues play without an offside rule. Some leagues enforce a &quot;three-line violation&quot;, prohibiting players from playing the ball in the air from behind the front line of their own penalty area across all three lines into the opponent&#x27;s penalty area. Violations often result in a free kick for the opposing team at the front line of the offending team&#x27;s penalty area.

Beyond these common threads, the sport is structured according to the idiosyncrasies of individual leagues. Most of these rules are adopted from other arena sports like ice hockey. Below is a listing of some of the more common ones:

* Substitution. Most leagues allow unlimited substitutions while the ball is out of play. Some allow live substitution while the game is in progress, provided that one player leaves the arena before another steps on. A minority of leagues require substitution in shifts.
* Cards. In addition to the traditional yellow and red cards of association football, some leagues include a card of a third color (blue is a common color) or another form of warning before the issuance of a yellow card. Often, leagues with a third card include a penalty box rule, and issuance of this third card requires the penalized player to sit in the box for a prescribed period of time (usually two minutes as in ice hockey) during which his or her team plays shorthanded. In leagues using the traditional card system, it is common for the yellow card to carry with it a penalty box rule. A blue card in an indoor league can be for serious fouls or unsportsmanlike like behavior. For example, it can be because of a deliberate handball by a player, mishandling of the ball by a goal keeper, goalkeeper endangerment, boarding, and any foul during a shootout by the goalkeeper. A blue card requires a two- minute penalty for the player. If you were to obtain a second blue card, you would be awarded a yellow card in its place and be punished with another two-minute penalty. A third time penalty receives an administrative red card meaning a two- minute penalty and ejection for the player. A straight red card receives a five- minute penalty and ejection for the player.
* Zones. Because of short fields and walls surrounding the goal, a common tactic is to attempt to score at kickoff by shooting at the goal and charging at the goal with all five non-goalkeeper players who overwhelm the other team&#x27;s defense and score at close range. As this depletes the tactics and drama of the game, many leagues have adopted an ice hockey-like zone rule, requiring that the ball not cross more than a certain forward distance toward the goal without being touched by a player.
* The ball. For indoor soccer played on artificial turf, the soccer ball is regulation and the same as outdoor soccer. For futsal, or indoor soccer on hard wood, the ball is designed to be low- bounce, weighted, and harder as there is a smaller playing area.
* The crease. Some leagues enforce a special zone inside the goalkeeper&#x27;s box called the crease. No player may shoot the ball from inside the crease unless that player entered the crease already having the ball.
* Multi-point scoring. Some leagues value goals scored from a greater distance to be worth two or three points from behind an arc, similar to basketball&#x27;s three-point field goal. Sometimes, leagues with a multi-point system also use a rule that a minor technical infraction gives the non-offending team a one-on-one opportunity to score on the opposing goalkeeper, worth one point. Many indoor coed leagues will give a female player two points for scoring a single goal.
* Sixth attacker. Some leagues allow a team which is trailing by one or two goals late in the final period to replace the goalkeeper with a sixth position player to increase its offense in an attempt to tie the match, exactly as is done in ice hockey under those conditions.
* Goalkeeper. In Indoor arena soccer, the goalkeeper has different rules than regular soccer mandates. If the goalie has control of the ball, with either hands or feet for over five seconds in the penalty arch, a free kick will be awarded to the opposite team. In Futsal, the goalkeeper may not possess the ball for over four seconds in their own half. Also, the goalkeeper is not allowed to throw the ball over the half-way line. In addition, the goalkeeper may not touch the ball if the ball did not go out of play, go over the halfway line, or become in possession of the opposite team. In any of these circumstances, a penalty will be awarded and a penalty kick for the other team will take place.
* Accumulated Fouls. In Futsal, all fouls are recorded on the score board and if a team reaches six or more fouls, the opposing team is awarded a free kick without a wall. There are two penalty spots to take a kick from depending on where the penalty happened. The first penalty spot is 20 feet from the goal line on the top of the arch. The second penalty spot is 30 feet from the goal line and at the center of the goal. The accumulated fouls are reset at the beginning of the second half but carry over into extra time.

<doc id="459510" wikidata="Q1302864" url="?curid=459510" title="Sliding tackle">
<text>A sliding tackle, also called slide tackle, is a tackle in association football in which one leg extends to push the ball away from the opposing player.
Sliding tackles can often be sources of controversy, particularly when players being tackled fall down over the tackler&#x27;s foot (or the ball stopped by the tackler&#x27;s foot), and penalties, free kicks and cards are assessed (or are conspicuous by their absence).

==Commonly associated fouls and misconduct==

A sliding tackle is not in itself foul play; however, there are a number of fouls that commonly occur during the execution of a sliding tackle.

Examples of such fouls punishable by a direct free kick or penalty kick include:
*When a player behaves in a manner considered by the referee to be &quot;careless, reckless or using excessive force&quot;:
**kicks or attempts to kick an opponent;
**trips or attempts to trip an opponent;
**jumps at an opponent;
**charges an opponent;
**tackles an opponent.
&quot;Careless&quot; means that the player has shown a lack of attention of consideration when making a challenge or that they acted without precaution. &quot;Reckless&quot; means that the player has acted with complete disregard to the danger to, or consequences for, their opponent. &quot;Using excessive force&quot; means that the player has far exceeded the necessary use of force and is in danger of injuring an opponent.

&quot;Careless&quot; challenges are punished by only a direct free kick or penalty kick. However, &quot;reckless&quot; challenges are also punished with a caution (yellow card) for unsporting behaviour as well as a direct free kick or penalty kick, while challenges committed with &quot;excessive force&quot; are also punished with a send-off (red card) for serious foul play as well as a direct free kick or penalty kick.

&quot;Playing in a dangerous manner&quot; is punishable by an indirect free kick. &quot;Playing in a dangerous manner&quot; is defined as any action, that while trying to play the ball, threatens injury to someone (including the player themselves). It is committed with an opponent nearby and prevents the opponent from playing the ball for fear of injury. If any physical contact is made, the offence becomes an offence punishable with a direct free kick or penalty kick.

Slide tackles that are made as two-footed lunges at an opponent are generally considered to endanger the safety of an opponent and are hence sanctioned as serious foul play, resulting in a sending-off. This is still the case even if the ball is won cleanly without touching an opponent.

==Strategy==

The slide tackle is attractive to the defender because it allows them to cover a larger area of ground while attempting to dispossess an opponent. It is often a &quot;last-ditch&quot; attempt to dispossess an opponent due to frequent misses and the difficulty of recovering in the event that the slide tackle fails to take the ball away. After a slide tackle, the tackler is left sitting or lying on the ground with one leg extended. The tackler therefore also runs the risk of personal injury. Ideally, the other foot ends up folded underneath their rear end, where it can be used to push the tackler back up to their feet to continue play.

If doing a sliding tackle to the right, the player&#x27;s right leg must be straight when going down into the tackle and their left leg should be bent slightly behind the right one in order to achieve maximum potential in gaining the ball. If doing a sliding tackle to the left, the player&#x27;s left leg must be straight and their right leg should be bent behind the left one.

==Potential revisions==
In 2017, then Mayor Bill de Blasio announced on Twitter that he intended to have Marshall Pétain&#x27;s plaque removed from the Canyon of Heroes. This happened after a national debate over the propriety of Confederate monuments spilled over into a reassessment of monuments in general. Pétain was honored in 1931 for his service in World War I. After France&#x27;s defeat by Germany, he advocated surrender rather than resistance; Pétain headed the Nazi collaborationist government of Vichy France from 1940–1944. France itself has largely removed all commemoration for Pétain; the last street named after him was renamed in 2010.

<text>The September Six were six members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) who were excommunicated or disfellowshipped by the church in September 1993, allegedly for publishing scholarly work against or criticizing church doctrine or leadership. The term &quot;September Six&quot; was coined by &quot;The Salt Lake Tribune&quot; and was used in the media and subsequent discussion. The church&#x27;s action was referred to by some as evidence of an anti-intellectual posture on the part of church leadership.

== Six Individuals ==

=== Lynne Kanavel Whitesides ===
Lynne Kanavel Whitesides is a Mormon feminist and is noted for speaking on the Mother in Heaven. Whitesides was the first of the group to experience church discipline and was disfellowshipped September 14, 1993. Though technically still a member, Whitesides claims that she &quot;exploded&quot; out of the church and her marriage in 1993, and she now considers herself a practitioner of Native American philosophies.

=== Avraham Gileadi ===
Avraham Gileadi is a Hebrew scholar and literary analyst, who is considered theologically conservative. Following his 1981 Ph.D. in ancient studies from Brigham Young University, he published a new interpretive translation of the Book of Isaiah in 1988 and a study of its eschatological prophecies in 1991. Mormon scholars, including Hugh Nibley, Truman G. Madsen and Ellis Rasmussen, praised his work, but his argument that the Isaiah prophecies pointed to a human &quot;Davidic king&quot; who would emerge in the Last Days, apart from Jesus Christ, was controversial, and his second book was pulled from the shelves by its publisher, church-owned Deseret Book. The reasons for his excommunication on September 15 are unclear. According to Margaret Toscano (whose husband was among the September Six and who would also later be excommunicated), Gileadi&#x27;s &quot;books interpreting Mormon scripture challenged the exclusive right of leaders to define doctrine,&quot; but Gileadi himself disputes that characterization. In 1996, Gileadi was rebaptized into the church after a second membership council, conducted by his stake president. As with all LDS Church rebaptisms, the original disciplinary action was expunged from the church&#x27;s records, and is now treated as if it never happened. Gileadi is currently an active member of the church.

=== Paul Toscano ===
Paul Toscano is a Salt Lake City attorney who co-authored, with Margaret Merrill Toscano, a controversial book, &quot;Strangers in Paradox: Explorations in Mormon Theology&quot; (1990), and in 1992, he co-founded The Mormon Alliance. He later wrote the book&quot; The Sanctity of Dissent&quot; (1994) and its sequel, &quot;The Sacrament of Doubt&quot; (2007).

He was excommunicated from the LDS Church on September 19, 1993. The reasons for his excommunication, as reportedly given by church leaders, were apostasy and false teaching. According to Toscano, the actual reason was insubordination in refusing to curb his sharp criticism of Church leaders&#x27; preference for legalism, ecclesiastical tyranny, white-washed Mormon history, and hierarchical authoritarianism, which privilege the image of the corporate church above its commitment to its members, to the teachings and the revelations of founder Joseph Smith, and to the gospel of Jesus Christ.

In 2007, Toscano wrote that he lost his faith &quot;like losing your eyesight after an accident.&quot; He regrets that church leaders have disregarded his criticisms of what he considers the church&#x27;s growing anti-intellectualism, homophobia, misogyny, and elitism.

Toscano&#x27;s wife, Margaret, faced her own disciplinary council for her doctrinal and feminist views and was excommunicated on November 30, 2000. Some view her excommunication as constituting a &quot;seventh&quot; member of the September Six, as she was summoned in 1993, but ecclesiastical focus shifted to her husband. Margaret&#x27;s discipline was delayed until 2000. Margaret later wrote &quot;The Missing Rib: The Forgotten Place of Queens and Priestesses in the Establishment of Zion&quot; as well as the tenth chapter of &quot;Transforming the Faiths of our Fathers: Women who Changed American Religion&quot; (2004), edited by Ann Braude.

=== Maxine Hanks ===
Maxine Hanks is a Mormon feminist theologian, who compiled and edited the anthology &quot;Women and Authority: Re-emerging Mormon Feminism&quot; (1992). She was excommunicated on September 19, along with fellow contributor D. Michael Quinn. In February 2012, Hanks was rebaptized as a member of the church.

=== Lavina Fielding Anderson ===
Lavina Fielding Anderson was a Mormon feminist writer who edited the books &quot;Sisters in Spirit: Mormon Women in Historical and Cultural Perspective&quot; (1992) and &quot;Lucy&#x27;s Book&quot;, an edition of the Lucy Mack Smith narrative. She was a former editor for the &quot;Ensign&quot; and served as editor for the &quot;Journal of Mormon History&quot; from 1991 to May 2009. She was excommunicated September 23 for apostasy, allegedly because of her article &quot;The LDS Intellectual Community and Church Leadership: A Contemporary Chronology&quot; in &quot;Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought&quot;. She also wrote chapter 9, &quot;The Grammar of Inequity&quot; in the book &quot;Women and Authority: Re-emerging Mormon Feminism&quot; (1992).

Anderson continued to attend LDS Church services as a non-member. She wrote on Mormon issues, including editing the multi-volume &quot;Case Reports of the Mormon Alliance&quot;, an ongoing collection of interviews with Mormons who believe they were unfairly disciplined by the church. After her husband&#x27;s death in 2018, Anderson&#x27;s bishop approached her about reinstatement, the first ecclesiastical leader in the twenty-four years since she was excommunicated to do so. In 2019, her local stake leaders reconvened her disciplinary council, in which she affirmed her faith but also expressed multiple views contrary to church teachings. The council recommended her rebaptism to the First Presidency; this was rejected without explanation, and without reiterating her conditions for reinstatement. Anderson continued to attend weekly church services and published in 2020 a collection of essays regarding inclusiveness and gender inequality in her book &quot;Mercy Without End: Toward a More Inclusive Church&quot;. She died on October 29, 2023.

=== D. Michael Quinn ===
D. Michael Quinn was a Mormon historian. Among other studies, he documented LDS Church-sanctioned polygamy from 1890 until 1904, after the 1890 Manifesto that officially abandoned the practice. He wrote chapter 17, &quot;Mormon Women Have Had the Priesthood Since 1843&quot; in the book &quot;Women and Authority: Re-emerging Mormon Feminism&quot; (1992). He was excommunicated September 26.

Quinn was summoned to a disciplinary council to answer charges of &quot;conduct unbecoming a member of the Church and apostasy,&quot; including very sensitive and highly confidential&#x27; matters that were not related to Michael&#x27;s historical writings.&quot; Anderson has suggested that the &quot;allusion to Michael&#x27;s sexual orientation, which Michael had not yet made public, was unmistakable.&quot;

Quinn afterwards published several critical studies of Mormon hierarchy, including his three-volume work of &quot;The Mormon Hierarchy: Origins of Power&quot;, &quot;The Mormon Hierarchy: Extensions of Power&quot;, and &quot;The Mormon Hierarchy: Wealth and Corporate Power.&quot; He also authored the 1996 book &quot;Same-Sex Dynamics Among Nineteenth-Century Americans: A Mormon Example&quot;, which argues that homosexuality was common among early Mormons and was not seen as a serious sin or transgression. He also authored the 1987 book, &quot;Early Mormonism and the Magic World View&quot;, which argues that early Mormon leaders were greatly influenced by folk magic and superstitious beliefs including stone looking, charms, and divining rods.

Despite his excommunication and critical writings, Quinn, who was after his excommunication openly gay, still considered himself to be a Latter-day Saint, a stance he maintained until his death in 2021.

==Church measures taken==

Except for Whitesides, all of the September Six were excommunicated. Whitesides was disfellowshipped, a lesser sanction that does not formally expel one from church membership. To date, three of the September Six have retained or regained church membership: Avraham Gileadi and Maxine Hanks, who were rebaptized, and Lynne Whitesides, who remains a disfellowshipped member.

While the LDS Church sometimes announces that a prominent member has been excommunicated, the default policy is to refuse to publicly discuss details about the reasons for any excommunication, even if details of the proceedings are made public by that person. Other than the summons sent to each of the six (specifying that their behavior was &quot;contrary to the laws and order of the church&quot;), the church is silent on why a member was disciplined. Such disciplinary proceedings are typically undertaken locally, initiated by leaders at the ward or stake level, although at least one of the September Six suggested his excommunication was orchestrated by higher-ranking church leaders.

Procedures pertaining to the organization of these disciplinary councils are found in the church&#x27;s scriptural &quot;Doctrine and Covenants&quot; section 102 as well as in its administrative handbook. During the time of the September Six, &quot;Handbook 1,&quot; which was only available to ecclesiastical leaders, was in use. In 2020, the church publicly published a revised handbook, &quot;General Handbook: Serving in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.&quot; The 2020 Handbook changes some language and procedures regarding church discipline.

The LDS Church later excommunicated Janice Merrill Allred in 1995 and Margaret Merrill Toscano in 2000, both of whom had collaborated with several of the September Six and were also involved in disciplinary actions during 1993.

<text>Raymond Alan Whyberd (18 September 1930 – 24 May 2010) was an English ventriloquist, television entertainer, and writer. His career spanned over half a century, though he was most popular from the 1950s until the 1980s. He was associated primarily with the dummies Lord Charles and Ali Kat and later with the puppets Tich and Quackers.

==Early life==
Born Raymond Alan Whyberd in Greenwich, London, Alan was educated at Morden Terrace School, Lewisham. He was introduced to the world of entertainment at a young age, entering a talent contest at the age of five at his local Gaumont cinema.

==Entertainment career==
Aged 13, Alan became a call-boy at the Hippodrome Theatre in Lewisham, where he started to do magic sets on stage between acts. He then started to entertain private functions, introducing ventriloquism into his act, along with playing the ukulele. He soon left school to begin performing full-time.

Alan toured in cabaret all over the world and performed once with Laurel and Hardy in 1954. Laurel had provided inspiration for the look of Alan&#x27;s most famous creation, Lord Charles, who first appeared at a charity show in Wormwood Scrubs Prison, London.

Alan made his television debut with Lord Charles on the BBC programme &quot;The Good Old Days&quot; in the 1960s and the pair regularly re-appeared on the programme. In the 1960s he also appeared on a children&#x27;s programme &quot;Tich and Quackers&quot; with Tich, a small boy, and his pet duck Quackers. He created the puppet character &quot;Ali Cat&quot; for the HTV series &quot;Magic Circle&quot; (1977). He was also the presenter for two years of the BBC show &quot;Ice Show&quot;. In 1985 he was a special guest for Bob Hope&#x27;s birthday show at London&#x27;s Lyric Theatre. In 1986 he presented a show on Channel 4 on ventriloquism, called &quot;A Gottle of Geer&quot;, which he later adapted into a book.

Alan continued to perform into his seventies, doing tours, performing in plays, and undertaking conference and corporate events. In 1991 he had a cameo in &quot;ElDorado&quot; the BBC soap, slapping actor Alex Leam who had slagged off ventriloquism. In 1998/1999 he entertained guests on the &quot;QE2&quot;. He took a break from stage work due to ill health but he did not rule out a return, if his health had permitted. His last stage appearance was in November 2008 when he performed at a special charity concert in Bridlington organised by his friend Greg Knight who was MP for the town. At the end of his performance he received a standing ovation.

==Writing==
Alan wrote four novels: &quot;Death and Deception&quot; in 2007 and &quot;A Game of Murder&quot; in 2008 (both published by Robert Hale), &quot;A Fear of Vengeance&quot; (2010, published by FA Thorpe) and &quot;Retribution&quot; (2011, published posthumously by Robert Hale). 

He also wrote for Tony Hancock, Dave Allen and for the shows &quot;Morecambe and Wise&quot;, &quot;The Two Ronnies&quot; and &quot;Bootsie and Snudge&quot;, usually under the name Ray Whyberd.

==Personal life==
Alan married Greta Motherwell in 1956; they divorced in 1972. He was in a relationship with Barbie Hayes in the 1980s. He married Jane Laycock in 1991.

Alan lived in Reigate, Surrey. He died from complications of pneumonia and pulmonary fibrosis at East Surrey Hospital in Redhill, on 24 May 2010, at the age of 79.

<doc id="459533" wikidata="Q6249252" url="?curid=459533" title="John Moore (Australian politician)">
<text>John Colinton Moore, (16 November 1936 – 22 January 2025) was an Australian politician. He was a Liberal member of the House of Representatives for over 25 years, serving between 1975 and 2001, and was a minister in the Fraser and Howard governments.

==Background==
Moore was born in Rockhampton, Queensland on 16 November 1936. He was raised on a cattle station west of Bowen. His early education was through the Australian correspondence system used for isolated families. He finished his secondary education at The Armidale School, an Anglican boarding school for boys, before entering the University of Queensland and graduating with a Bachelor of Commerce with additional study in Accounting.

==Early career==
Before he entered politics, Moore had a career as a businessman and stock broker. He spent four years (1960–1963) with A.R. Walker &amp; Co. before forming his own brokerage (John Moore &amp; Company) in 1964. He was a member of the Brisbane Stock Exchange from 1961 until 1974. He grew his firm into the largest single trader business in Queensland, opening offices in regional centres there and in New South Wales. He also held directorship or board membership in a number of Australian companies, such as Brandt Limited and Phillips. He was a board member of the Australian subsidiary of some multinational investment firms including Merrill Lynch and Citigroup. Moore was appointed to the Council of The Australian National University in 1971, and served as a Councillor until 1976.

Moore became a member of the Liberal Party in 1964, and by 1966 was serving in its state Executive Committee in Queensland. He was President of the Queensland Party twice; from 1973 to 1976 and again from 1984 to 1990. By party rules this also made him a member of the Federal Executive Committee (FEC) of the party. He served on the FEC in one role or another for almost thirty years.

==Political career==
Moore was elected to the House of Representatives for the Division of Ryan in Brisbane at the 1975 federal election. His first ministerial office was during the fourth Fraser government, when he was Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs from 1980 to 1982. He was forced to resign from this portfolio when it was shown that fellow minister Michael MacKellar had brought a television into Australia without paying customs duty and that Moore as the minister responsible for Customs had failed to adequately respond to a report of the incident.

While the Labor governments of Bob Hawke and Paul Keating were in power from 1983 to 1996, Moore served in the opposition&#x27;s Shadow Cabinet for several key ministries including Finance, Industry and Commerce, and Communications.

In 1985 Liberal leader Andrew Peacock chose Moore to challenge deputy Liberal leader John Howard but Howard retained the position beating Moore in a vote by Liberal party room members.
This led to Peacock resigning as leader and Howard elected in his place.
Moore again contested the deputy leadership now vacated by Howard&#x27;s elevation as leader but the position was ultimately won by Neil Brown.

When the 1996 election saw the Coalition return to power, Moore was appointed to the Cabinet in the new Howard government, as Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism and Vice-President of the Executive Council. In this position Moore had a major role in shaping new government policies affecting the motor vehicle and pharmaceutical industries. In cooperation with industrial leaders, he created a long range policy package, &quot;Investing for Growth.&quot;

In 1996, Moore came close to being forced to resign a ministry for the second time in his career, when it was discovered that his share holdings included significant investments that could potentially create a conflict of interest with his ministerial portfolio. These investments breached the Howard government&#x27;s ministerial code of conduct, but Moore was allowed to stay on.

After the 1998 election, Moore was appointed Minister for Defence. The most significant events during this period were the deployment of forces to East Timor as a part of the U.N. peace-keeping effort and the upgrade and operationalisation of the Collins Class Submarine Fleet. Famously, Moore had a falling out with the Secretary of the Department of Defence, Paul Barratt, resulting in the termination of Barratt&#x27;s employment contract. Moore&#x27;s most lasting legacy within the Australian Defence Force was the White Paper &quot;Defence 2000: Our Future Defence Force&quot;, released late in his ministry. Howard said: &quot;The Defence White Paper is the most far-sighted reshaping of Australia&#x27;s defence capability in a generation. It would not have been possible without John Moore&#x27;s determination to improve management within Defence and also win new resources for the ADF&quot;.

During the course of his second term in government, Howard reorganised Cabinet, and appointed Peter Reith as the Minister for Defence, with effect from 30 January 2001. Moore therefore left Cabinet as Howard did not move him to another portfolio. Moore then resigned his seat in Parliament on 5 February 2001. His resignation came at a bad time for the government, and the subsequent Ryan by-election saw Labor take the normally comfortably safe Liberal seat.

In 2015, Moore and three other former MPs brought a case before the High Court of Australia, purporting that reductions to their retirement allowances and limitations on the number of &quot;domestic return trips per year&quot; under the Members of Parliament (Life Gold Pass) Act 2002 was unconstitutional under S51(xxxi) of the Constitution of Australia. They lost the case in 2016, with the court finding that Parliament was entitled to vary the terms of allowances.

== Later life ==
John Moore died on 22 January 2025, at the age of 88, at the Berlasco Court Caring Centre, Indooroopilly. A state funeral was held on 4 February 2025 at Christ Church in St Lucia.

==Honours==
Moore was appointed an Officer of the Order of Australia in 2004 for service to the community through the Australian Parliament, to the development of strategic industry policy, and to both policy and management reform in the defence sector.

<doc id="459546" wikidata="Q777039" url="?curid=459546" title="Guy's Hospital">
<text>Guy&#x27;s Hospital is an NHS hospital founded by philanthropist Thomas Guy in 1721, located in the borough of Southwark in central London. It is part of Guy&#x27;s and St Thomas&#x27; NHS Foundation Trust and one of the institutions that comprise the King&#x27;s Health Partners, an academic health science centre.

It is a large teaching hospital and is, with St Thomas&#x27; Hospital and King&#x27;s College Hospital, the location of King&#x27;s College London GKT School of Medical Education.

The hospital&#x27;s Tower Wing (originally known as Guy&#x27;s Tower) was, when built in 1974, the tallest hospital building in the world, standing at with 34 floors. The tower was overtaken as the world&#x27;s tallest healthcare-related building by The Belaire in New York City in 1988. As of June 2019, the Tower Wing, which remains one of the tallest buildings in London, is the world&#x27;s sixth-tallest hospital building.

==History==
The hospital dates from 1721, when it was founded by philanthropist Thomas Guy, who had made a fortune as a printer of Bibles and greatly increased it by speculating in the South Sea Bubble. It was originally established as a hospital to treat &quot;incurables&quot; discharged from St Thomas&#x27; Hospital. Guy had been a governor and benefactor of St Thomas&#x27; and his fellow governors supported his intention by granting the south-side of St Thomas Street for a peppercorn rent for 999 years. Following his death in 1724, Thomas Guy was entombed at the hospital&#x27;s chapel (also dating from the 18th century), in a tomb featuring a marble sculpture by John Bacon.

The original buildings formed a courtyard facing St Thomas Street, comprising the hall on the east side and the chapel, Matron&#x27;s House and Surgeon&#x27;s House on the west side. The original main buildings were built by the King&#x27;s Master Mason, John Deval, in 1739.

A bequest of £180,000 by William Hunt in 1829, one of the largest charitable bequests in England in historic terms, allowed for a further hundred beds to be accommodated. Hunt&#x27;s name was given to the southern expansion of the hospital buildings which took place in 1850. Two inner quadrangles were divided by a cloister which was later restyled and dedicated to the hospital&#x27;s members who fell in the First World War. The east side comprised the care wards and the &quot;counting house&quot; with the governors&#x27; Burfoot Court Room. The north-side quadrangle is dominated by a statue of Lord Nuffield (1877–1963) who was the chairman of governors for many years and also a major benefactor.

In 1879-1880 the &#x27;Guy&#x27;s Hospital dispute&#x27; between matron Margaret Burt and hospital medical staff highlighted how doctors sometimes felt that their authority was being challenged by new-style matrons. Florence Nightingale advocated that these new trained matrons had full control and discipline over their nursing staff. Margaret Burt ultimately resigned, but this was not an isolated episode and other matrons experienced similar issues, such as Eva Luckes.

In 1974, the hospital added the 34-storey Guy&#x27;s Tower and 29-storey Guy&#x27;s House: this complex was designed by Watkins Gray. The Wolfson Centre for Age-Related Diseases, which is dedicated to improving outcomes of conditions such as Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, stroke, Parkinson&#x27;s disease and spinal cord injury, was opened by the Princess Royal in December 2004.

In October 2005 children&#x27;s departments moved to the Evelina London Children&#x27;s Hospital in the grounds next to St Thomas&#x27;s close to the Palace of Westminster. A new cancer centre, designed by Rogers Stirk Harbour + Partners, and built by Laing O&#x27;Rourke at a cost of £160 million, was completed in April 2016.

==Facilities==
Medical services at the Guy&#x27;s site are now concentrated in the buildings to the east of Great Maze Pond: these buildings, which are connected, are known as Tower Wing, Bermondsey Wing, Southwark Wing and Borough Wing. The Cancer Centre is in a separate building just to the south. To the west of the Great Maze Pond is Guy&#x27;s Campus which forms part of King&#x27;s College London.

At high, Guy&#x27;s Tower (now called the Tower Wing) regained its tallest hospital building in the world status in 2014. It has since been surpassed by the Outpatient Center at the Houston Methodist Hospital, in Houston, USA at .

<text>The Union of Christian Baptist Churches in Romania () is a Baptist Christian denomination in Romania. It is affiliated with the Romanian Evangelical Alliance, the European Baptist Federation and the Baptist World Alliance. The headquarters is in Bucharest.

==History==
===Origins===

The first modern-era Baptists in Romania were of German extraction. Karl Scharschmidt came to what is now southern Romania from Hungary in 1856 and settled in Bucharest. Scharschmidt, a carpenter by trade, had been baptized by Johann Gerhard Oncken in Hamburg in 1845. By 1863 enough converts had been made to form a church, and Oncken sent August Liebig to serve them as pastor. This church, the oldest Baptist church in Romania, in still in existence and meets on Popa Rusu Street (Bethany Baptist Church). Russian Baptist immigrants, mostly from the southern Ukraine, came to Dobruja around 1862 and founded a church in Cataloi in 1869. Hungarian Baptists formed a church in Transylvania in 1875.

===Formation===
Baptist witnesses did not enter Old Romania until the 20th century, and Orthodox opposition was strong. Nevertheless, a church was organized in Jegalia in 1909. An ethnic Romanian church was formed in Bucharest in 1912 by Constantin Adorian (1882–1954), a Romanian who had previously joined the German Baptist church in Bucharest. Adorian led in forming the Baptist Union of Romania in 1920. He met in June 1919 with Radu Tașcă, Vasile Berbecar, Teodor Sida and other baptist pastors from Crișana in Buteni to discuss the formation of a &quot;Union of Romanian Baptist Communities&quot;. The organization was formally created in February 1920, when, after gaining approval from the authorities, a congress was held in the same location with representatives from baptist churches from all around the country. 

In 1921, it founded the Bucharest Baptist Theological Institute, which would later become the Faculty of Baptist Theology, affiliated to the University of Bucharest.

In 1930, the Union had 45,000 members. Before 1944, the legal status of evangelical groups such as the Baptists was not well-defined. Due to World War II and the military dictatorship of General Antonescu, laws were passed in 1942 and 1943 dissolving all religious associations in Romania. As a consequence, Baptists could not meet, worship or evangelize. On August 31, 1944, these laws were abrogated, and the Baptists (and others) could once again engage in religious activity legally. In 1948 Baptists were officially recognized by the state as a legal &quot;cult&quot;.

According to a census published by the association in 2023, it claimed 1,697 churches and 83,853 members. The members of the Convention of the Hungarian Baptist Churches of Romania, a subgroup of the national Baptist Union, were counted separately and are 8,321 in 253 churches, making for a total of 92,174 members and 1,900 churches.

====Calvinist-Arminian debate====

Historically, the baptist churches in Romania were very much influenced by calvinism. This was no surprise given the fact that the church had German roots. According to the Romanian historiographer, Alexa Popovici, early baptists had a &quot;Calvinist inclination&quot;. There is evidence to suggest that, at some point, calvinist soteriology, including double predestination, was preached in some congregations in Transylvania. The liberal tendencies of the Reformed Church made some Hungarians switch to the baptist tradition which also contributed to the predominant calvinist view among Romanian baptists. However the church would experience a shift towards arminianism during the interwar period due to the founding of a formal seminary in collaboration with the Southern Baptist Convention and the theological influences of Edgar Young Mullins. The arminian position will remain the predominant view among Romanian baptists for much of the communist period. After the 1989 Revolution, the calvinist position would reemerge and gain popularity once again, although it would still remain a minority view.

==Relation with the state==
The separation of church and state is a core doctrine in baptist tradition.

===Funds===
Out of the 19 officially recognised denominations in Romania, the Baptist Union is one of the only three which do not accept subsidies from the government for the salaries of its ministers, believing that it is the deliberate duty of every believer to financially support the activities of his church. However, the Union accepts subsidies from the local authorities for the construction or reparation of its churches when their funds are insufficient. The church also runs its own pension fund for its retired pastors.

== Schools ==

The Union has 8 theological high schools and 2 post-secondary non-tertiary educational institutions, as well as 2 tertiary institutions: The Baptist Theological Institute in Bucharest (accredited by the University of Bucharest) and the Emanuel University in Oradea, Bihor.

<text>The Walker Art Center is a multidisciplinary contemporary art center in the Lowry Hill neighborhood of Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States. The Walker is one of the most-visited modern and contemporary art museums in the U.S.: together with the adjacent Minneapolis Sculpture Garden and Cowles Conservatory, it has an annual attendance of around 700,000 visitors. The museum&#x27;s permanent collection includes over 13,000 modern and contemporary art pieces, including books, costumes, drawings, media works, paintings, photography, prints, and sculpture.

The Walker Art Center began in 1879 as an art gallery in the home of lumber baron Thomas Barlow Walker. Walker formally established his collection as the Walker Art Gallery in 1927. With the support of the Federal Art Project of the Works Progress Administration, the Walker Art Gallery became the Walker Art Center in January 1940. The Walker celebrated its 75th anniversary as a public art center in 2015.

The Walker&#x27;s new building, designed by Edward Larrabee Barnes and opened in 1971, saw a major expansion in 2005. Swiss architects Herzog &amp; de Meuron&#x27;s addition included an additional gallery space, a theater, restaurant, shop, and a special events space.

==Programs==

===Visual arts===
The visual arts program has been a part of the Walker Art Center since its founding. The program includes an ongoing cycle of exhibitions in the galleries as well as a permanent collection of acquired, donated, and commissioned works. Since the 1960s, the Visual Arts program has commissioned works from artists to exhibit and held residencies for artists including Robert Irwin, Glenn Ligon, Barry McGee, Catherine Opie, Lorna Simpson, Nari Ward, and Nairy Baghramian.

The Walker&#x27;s collection represents works of modern and contemporary art, especially focused after 1960. Its holdings include more than 13,000 pieces, including books, costumes, drawings, media works, paintings, photography, prints, and sculpture. In 2015, the Walker celebrated the 75th anniversary of its founding as a public art center with a yearlong exhibition &quot;Art at the Center: 75 Years of Walker Collections&quot;. Some collection highlights include:

* Chuck Close, &quot;Big Self-Portrait&quot;
* Franz Marc, &quot;Die grossen blauen Pferde (The Large Blue Horses)&quot; 
* Edward Hopper, &quot;Office at Night&quot;
* Yves Klein, &quot;Suaire de Mondo Cane (Mondo Cane Shroud)&quot;
* Goshka Macuga, &quot;Lost Forty&quot;
* Andy Warhol, &quot;16 Jackies&quot;

===Performing arts===
Live performance art is a major part of the Walker&#x27;s programming and it is seen as a leader in exhibiting the medium. In 1940, the Walker began presenting local dance, poetry, and concerts, largely organized by volunteers. By 1963, this group had become Center Opera, the Walker&#x27;s performing arts program focused on exhibiting new works emphasizing visual design. In 1970, Center Opera disbanded from the Walker and became the Minnesota Opera. The same year, Performing Arts was officially designated as a department of the Walker Art Center.

Since the 1960s, Performing Arts at the Walker has commissioned 265 performance works. In addition, the department programs a 25-show season every year that includes performance art, theater, dance, spoken word, and music. It is one of the nation&#x27;s largest performing arts programs of its kind found in a museum. A number of artists have long histories working with and performing at the Walker, most notably choreographers Bill T. Jones, Meredith Monk, and Merce Cunningham, for whom the Walker staged the retrospective &quot;Life Performs Art&quot; in 1998. As a longtime associate of the Merce Cunningham Dance Company, the Walker was able to acquire 150 art objects central to the company&#x27;s history from the Cunningham Foundation in 2011. The agreement included sculptures, sets, costumes and other works by artists like Robert Rauschenberg and Jasper Johns.

===Moving image===
The Walker&#x27;s film and video programs feature both contemporary and historical works. In the 1940s, the Walker identified moving images (mostly movies, but also experimental films) as integral to contemporary life. Artists of that time were experimenting with film&#x27;s formal properties, such as light, motion, and sound, while also separating film art from conventional narrative cinema.

In 1973, the Film/Video Department was officially formed and the Edmond R. Ruben Film and Video Study Collection was established, along with an endowment to fund the development of the archive. Ruben, a leading figure in film exhibition in the Upper Midwest, and his wife, Evelyn, believed in collecting films as a way of preserving the art form. Today, with more than 850 titles, the Ruben Collection brings together classic and contemporary cinema as well as documentaries, avant-garde films, and video works by artists. It holds works by visual artists ranging from Salvador Dalí, Marcel Duchamp, and Fernand Léger to extensive contemporary work by William Klein, Derek Jarman, Bruce Conner, Marcel Broodthaers, Matthew Barney, Nam June Paik, Wolf Vostell, and experimental artists such as Paul Sharits and Stan Brakhage.

===Design===
The Walker maintains a professional, in-house design and editorial department to fulfill its various communication needs. The department is responsible for the design and editing of all printed materials, including the creation and planning of publications such as exhibition catalogues, bimonthly magazines, and books, as well as exhibition and event graphics, signage programs, and promotional campaigns.

The department also organizes design-related projects and programs, such as lectures, exhibitions, and special commissions. Over the course of its 60-plus-year history, the department has organized many important exhibitions on architecture and design and has served as a forum for contemporary design issues, bringing hundreds of architects, designers, and critics to the Twin Cities through programs such as the Insights design lecture series, which celebrated its 30th year in 2016. During the 1940s, the Walker built two &quot;idea houses&quot; exhibiting the latest in building materials, furnishings and architectural design trends.

From the late 1960s until the early &#x27;90s, the museum&#x27;s design curator, Mildred Friedman, helped conceive and stage exhibitions on, among other topics, the Dutch avant-garde movement De Stijl, the design process at the Modernist furniture company Herman Miller, the history of graphic design, and traditional and contemporary Japanese arts, crafts and culture. For more than 30 years, the Walker has also offered the Mildred S. Friedman Design Fellowship, a yearlong program for young designers.

===Digital media===
The Walker&#x27;s New Media Initiatives group (renamed Digital Media in 2017) oversees mnartists.org, an online database of Minnesota artists and organizations that provides a digital gathering place for the local arts community. Through a partnership with the Minneapolis Institute of Art, the Walker manages ArtsConnectEd, an online resource for arts educators that draws from both institutions&#x27; permanent collection resources.

In 1998, the Walker acquired &quot;äda&#x27;web&quot;, an early net art website curated by Benjamin Weil and designed by Vivian Selbo. The first official project of &quot;äda&#x27;web&quot; went up in May 1995, although it had been informally active since February of the same year.

In 2011, the Walker website was relaunched as a news-style website, featuring essays, interviews, and videos by both Walker staff and guest writers, as well as curated news links about global art and culture. The relaunch was met with positive reviews around the art world.

===Education and public programs===
Learning is emphasized as a core experience at the Walker through a mix of education programs, community building efforts, and interpretive projects. The department conducts community, family, interpretive, public, school, teen, and tour programs, as well as mnartists.org. Each division offers programs and activities in visual art, performing arts, film/video, new media, design, and architecture. To inform these undertakings, the staff work with Walker curators and partners from local organizations, artists, schools, and community groups. Advisory groups such as the Walker Art Center Teen Arts Council, Tour Guide Council, and the Parent Advisory Group are also implemented in the department for the Walker to further build relationships with its audience.

===Publishing===
The Walker&#x27;s long history of publishing includes the production of exhibition catalogues, books, and periodicals as well as digital publishing. From 1946 to 1954, it published the &quot;Everyday Art Quarterly&quot;; in 1954, the publication changed its name to &quot;Design Quarterly&quot; and &quot;shifted its emphasis away from consuming design to understanding design&#x27;s impact on society and its processes and methods of practice and inquiry.&quot; It was discontinued in 1993. The Walker&#x27;s in-house design studio has created countless exhibition catalogues dedicated to the art of Marcel Broodthaers, Trisha Brown, Huang Yong Ping, Kiki Smith, Kara Walker, Andy Warhol, and Krzysztof Wodiczko, among many others, as well as books on design, architecture, social practice, and other topics in contemporary art. In 2011, the Walker redesigned its homepage as an &quot;idea hub,&quot; a news-magazine format that presents original interviews, videos, commissioned essays, scholarly writings, and newslinks. The publishing-forward homepage was hailed as a &quot;game-changer, the website that every art museum will have to consider from this point forward&quot; (Tyler Green, Modern Art Notes) and &quot;a model for other institutions of all kinds&quot; (Alexis Madrigal, &quot;The Atlantic&quot;). The site won Best of the Web awards at the 2012 Museums and the Web conference, including &quot;Best Overall Site&quot; and &quot;Best Innovative/Experimental Site.&quot; It also won a gold MUSE Award for &quot;Online Presence, Media &amp; Technology&quot; from the American Alliance of Museums. In 2017, the homepage was redesigned, and the Walker&#x27;s digital publishing was rebranded under the title Walker Reader, a magazine landing page that aggregates original content from the Walker&#x27;s five verticals.

In April 2020, &quot;The New York Times&quot; said the Walker website was one of the best museum sites during the COVID pandemic, stating the &quot;Walker Reader&quot; was &quot;an editorial arm of the museum that features debates on Indigenous art, or on how museums respond to the #MeToo movement. Treating the digital museum as coequal to the physical museum means you can be nimble when disaster strikes.” In August 2020, the Walker Reader ceased publication.

==Campus==

Located on a 17-acre urban campus, the Walker Art Center&#x27;s 260,000 square foot, 8-story building encompasses 10 art galleries along with a cinema, theater, shop, restaurant, and café, along with other special events spaces and lecture rooms.

The original building was designed by New York-based architect Edward Larrabee Barnes and opened in May 1971. Barnes designed the building in the minimalist style of the period with a plain, modular brick exterior and expansive white spaces in the interior. The structure is a unique arrangement of galleries that spiral up around a central staircase and open onto rooftop terraces. The Walker&#x27;s architecture gained critical acclaim upon its opening and Barnes received the American Institute of Architects Award for his work.

In 2005, Barnes&#x27;s original building underwent a $67 million expansion designed by Swiss architects Jacques Herzog and Pierre de Meuron. The addition was built on a &quot;town square&quot; concept meant to open up Barnes&#x27;s boxlike building through accessible gathering spaces. Its central element is an abstract geometric tower made of aluminum mesh panels, built for Herzog &amp; de Meuron by the Minnesota firm Spantek, and glass windows that holds the theater, restaurant, and shop spaces. Windowed halls containing expanded gallery and atrium spaces connect the tower to the original structure.

In 2015, the Walker announced a plan to unify the Walker and the surrounding Minneapolis Sculpture Garden. Key features of the renovation include a new entry pavilion for the Walker, a new hillside green space, the Upper Garden, and the reconstruction of the 26-year-old sculpture garden, a partnership with the Minneapolis Park and Recreation Board. The project also implements green-roof technology, rainwater reclamation systems in the garden, and the addition of hundreds of new trees throughout the campus. The renovation was completed in November 2016, with the sculpture garden reopening to the public in spring 2017.

==History==

The Walker Art Center began with Minneapolis businessman Thomas Barlow Walker, who held one of the largest art collections in the nation. In 1879, he dedicated part of his home to exhibiting the art to the public for free. In 1916, Walker purchased the land now known as Lowry Hill to build a museum for his growing collection. His museum, the Walker Art Galleries, was opened on May 21, 1927.

In 1939, the Minnesota Arts Council was granted control of the building on Lowry Hill, along with its art collection, in order to create a civic art center. With the assistance of the Works Progress Administration, building improvements were made and the Walker Art Center opened in January 1940. Daniel Defenbacher, who led the Federal Art Project&#x27;s Community Art Center program, left the WPA to become the first director of the Walker Art Center. Around this time, the Walker officially began its focus on modern and contemporary works of art.

The Walker&#x27;s current building, designed by Edward Larrabee Barnes, opened in 1971 and expanded in 1984. Minneapolis Parks and Recreation partnered with the Walker Art Center to establish the Minneapolis Sculpture Garden on the Walker&#x27;s campus in 1988.

In 1984, the Walker Art Center hosted a residency for Keith Haring, during which he created many notable works and murals. 

Opened in April 2005, the most recent building expansion nearly doubled the size of the Walker Art Center. The expansion, designed by Herzog &amp; de Meuron, included an additional gallery space, a theater, restaurant, shop, and special events space.

In June 2017, the reopening of the sculpture garden after reconstruction was delayed due to protests over Sam Durant&#x27;s sculpture &quot;Scaffold&quot;.

==Management==

===Funding===
The Walker Art Center is supported in part by a grant provided by the Minnesota State Arts Board through an appropriation by the Minnesota Legislature from the State&#x27;s general fund and its arts and cultural heritage fund. To ensure the Walker&#x27;s creative independence, then-director Kathy Halbreich forswore millions of dollars in potential state aid for the museum&#x27;s $73.8 million expansion in 2005, a decision that resulted in a one-year salary freeze, some staff cuts, and the elimination of the Walker&#x27;s new-media art program.

In 2011, the Walker Art Center reported net assets of $243 million. Its annual expenses were $22 million, and its endowment was at $152 million. The museum director&#x27;s compensation is at around $375,000.

===Audience engagement===
As of 2011, total attendance was at about 590,000 visitors, out of which 22% were Teen and Youth Visitors.

===Directors===
*Daniel Defenbacher, 1940–1951

<doc id="459560" wikidata="Q1570280" url="?curid=459560" title="Low-carbohydrate diet">
<text>Low-carbohydrate diets restrict carbohydrate consumption relative to the average diet. Foods high in carbohydrates (e.g., sugar, bread, pasta) are limited, and replaced with foods containing a higher percentage of fat and protein (e.g., meat, poultry, fish, shellfish, eggs, cheese, nuts, and seeds), as well as low carbohydrate foods (e.g. spinach, kale, chard, collards, and other fibrous vegetables).
There is a lack of standardization of how much carbohydrate low-carbohydrate diets must have, and this has complicated research. One definition, from the American Academy of Family Physicians, specifies low-carbohydrate diets as having less than 20% of calories from carbohydrates.
There is no good evidence that low-carbohydrate dieting confers any particular health benefits apart from weight loss, where low-carbohydrate diets achieve outcomes similar to other diets, as weight loss is mainly determined by calorie restriction and adherence.
One form of low-carbohydrate diet called the ketogenic diet was first established as a medical diet for treating epilepsy. It became a popular diet for weight loss through celebrity endorsement, but there is no evidence of any distinctive benefit for this purpose and the diet carries a risk of adverse effects, with the British Dietetic Association naming it one of the &quot;top five worst celeb diets to avoid&quot; in 2018.

== Definition and classification ==
=== Macronutrient ratios ===
The macronutrient ratios of low-carbohydrate diets are not standardized. , the conflicting definitions of &quot;low-carbohydrate&quot; diets have complicated research into the subject.

The National Lipid Association Nutrition and Lifestyle Task Force define low-carbohydrate diets and those containing less than 25% of calories from carbohydrates, and very low carbohydrate diets being those containing less than 10% carbohydrates. A 2016 review of low-carbohydrate diets classified diets with 50 g of carbohydrate per day (less than 10% of total calories) as &quot;very low&quot; and diets with 40% of calories from carbohydrates as &quot;mild&quot; low-carbohydrate diets. The UK National Health Service recommend that &quot;carbohydrates should be the body&#x27;s main source of energy in a healthy, balanced diet.&quot;

=== Foodstuffs ===

There is evidence that the quality, rather than the quantity, of carbohydrate in a diet is important for health, and that high-fiber slow-digesting carbohydrate-rich foods are healthful while highly refined and sugary foods are less so. A diet chosen to address health concerns should be tailored to the individual&#x27;s specific needs.

Most vegetables are low- or moderate-carbohydrate foods (in some low-carbohydrate diets, fiber is excluded because it is not a nutritive carbohydrate). Some vegetables, such as potatoes, carrots, maize (corn) and rice are high in starch. Most low-carbohydrate diet plans accommodate vegetables such as broccoli, spinach, kale, lettuce, cucumbers, cauliflower, Brussels sprouts, peppers and most green-leafy vegetables.

== Authority opinions ==
The National Academy of Medicine recommends a daily average of 130 g of carbohydrates per day. The FAO and WHO similarly recommend that the majority of dietary energy come from carbohydrates. Low-carbohydrate diets are not an option recommended in the 2015–2020 edition of Dietary Guidelines for Americans, which instead recommends a low-fat diet.

Carbohydrate has been wrongly accused of being a uniquely &quot;fattening&quot; macronutrient, misleading many dieters into compromising the nutritiousness of their diet by eliminating carbohydrate-rich food. Low-carbohydrate diet proponents emphasize research saying that low-carbohydrate diets can initially cause slightly greater weight loss than a balanced diet, but any such advantage does not persist. In the long-term successful weight maintenance is determined by calorie intake, and not by macronutrient ratios.

The public has become confused by the way in which some diets, such as the Zone diet and the South Beach diet are promoted as &quot;low-carbohydrate&quot; when in fact they would more properly be termed &quot;medium-carbohydrate&quot; diets.

=== Carbohydrate-insulin hypothesis ===
Low-carbohydrate diet advocates including Gary Taubes and David Ludwig have proposed a &quot;carbohydrate-insulin hypothesis&quot; in which carbohydrates are said to be uniquely fattening because they raise insulin levels and cause fat to accumulate unduly. The hypothesis appears to run counter to known human biology whereby there is no good evidence of any such association between the actions of insulin, fat accumulation, and obesity. The hypothesis predicted that low-carbohydrate dieting would offer a &quot;metabolic advantage&quot; of increased energy expenditure equivalent to 400–600 kcal(kilocalorie)/day, in accord with the promise of the Atkin&#x27;s diet: a &quot;high calorie way to stay thin forever&quot;.

With funding from the Laura and John Arnold Foundation, in 2012, Taubes co-founded the Nutrition Science Initiative (NuSI), with the aim of raising over $200 million to undertake a &quot;Manhattan Project For Nutrition&quot; and validate the hypothesis. Intermediate results, published in the &quot;American Journal of Clinical Nutrition&quot; did not provide convincing evidence of any advantage to a low-carbohydrate diet as compared to diets of other composition. This study revealed a marginal (~100 kcal/d) but statistically significant effect of the ketogenic diet to increase 24-hour energy expenditure measured in a respiratory chamber, but the effect waned over time. Ultimately a very low-calorie, ketogenic diet (of 5% carbohydrate) &quot;was not associated with significant loss of fat mass&quot; compared to a non-specialized diet with the same calories; there was no useful &quot;metabolic advantage&quot;. In 2017, Kevin Hall, a National Institutes of Health researcher hired to assist with the project, wrote that the carbohydrate-insulin hypothesis had been falsified by experiment. Hall wrote &quot;the rise in obesity prevalence may be primarily due to increased consumption of refined carbohydrates, but the mechanisms are likely to be quite different from those proposed by the carbohydrate–insulin model.&quot;

== Health aspects ==

=== Adherence ===
It has been repeatedly found that in the long-term, all diets with the same calorific value perform the same for weight loss, except for the one differentiating factor of how well people can faithfully follow the dietary programme. A study comparing groups taking low-fat, low-carbohydrate and Mediterranean diets found at six months the low-carbohydrate diet still had most people adhering to it, but thereafter the situation reversed: at two years the low-carbohydrate group had the highest incidence of lapses and dropouts. This may be due to the comparatively limited food choice of low-carbohydrate diets.

=== Body weight ===
In the short and medium term, people taking a low-carbohydrate diet can experience more weight loss than people taking a low-fat diet. The Endocrine Society stated that &quot;when calorie intake is held constant ... body-fat accumulation does not appear to be affected by even very pronounced changes in the amount of fat vs. carbohydrate in the diet&quot;. People on such a diet have very slightly more weight loss initially, equivalent to approximately 100kcal/day, but that advantage diminishes over time and is ultimately insignificant. A Cochrane review from 2022 looked into longer periods of two years and found no benefit for adhering to a low-carbohydrate diet in comparison to balanced diets.

Much of the research comparing low-fat vs. low-carbohydrate dieting has been of poor quality and studies which reported large effects have garnered disproportionate attention in comparison to those which are methodologically sound. A 2018 review said &quot;higher-quality meta-analyses reported little or no difference in weight loss between the two diets.&quot; Low-quality meta-analyses have tended to report favourably on the effect of low-carbohydrate diets: a systematic review reported that 8 out of 10 meta-analyses assessed whether weight loss outcomes could have been affected by publication bias, and 7 of them concluded positively. A 2017 review concluded that a variety of diets, including low-carbohydrate diets, achieve similar weight loss outcomes, which are mainly determined by calorie restriction and adherence rather than the type of diet.

=== Cardiovascular health ===
Eating a low-carbohydrate diet for less than two years was found to not worsen markers for cardiovascular health. However, following a low-carb diet for many years is associated with dying from heart disease. Low-carbohydrate diets in the long-term have detrimental effects on lipid parameters such as increase in total and LDL cholesterol. This is because most people on low-carbohydrate diets eat more animal source foods and less fruits and vegetables rich in fiber and micronutrients.

The American College of Cardiology recommends a clinician-patient discussion for people who want to go on a very low-carbohydrate diet. People on the diet should be informed that it may worsen LDL-C levels and cardiovascular health in the long-term. Those with atherosclerosis should be counseled to avoid low-carbohydrate diets.

=== Diabetes ===
There is limited evidence for the effectiveness of low-carbohydrate diets for people with type 1 diabetes. For certain individuals, it may be feasible to follow a low-carbohydrate regime combined with carefully managed insulin dosing. This can be hard to maintain and there are concerns about potential adverse health effects caused by the diet. In general, people with type 1 diabetes are advised to follow an individualized eating plan.

The proportion of carbohydrate in a diet is not linked to the risk of type 2 diabetes, although there is some evidence that diets containing certain high-carbohydrate items – such as sugar-sweetened drinks or white rice – are associated with an increased risk. Some evidence indicates that consuming fewer carbohydrate foods may reduce biomarkers of type 2 diabetes.
A 2019 consensus report on nutrition therapy for adults with diabetes and prediabetes the American Diabetes Association (ADA) states &quot;Reducing overall carbohydrate intake for individuals with diabetes has demonstrated the most evidence for improving glycemia (blood sugar) and may be applied in a variety of eating patterns that meet individual needs and preferences.&quot; However, another source states that there is no good evidence that low-carbohydrate diets are better than a conventional healthy diet in which carbohydrates typically account for more than 40% of calories consumed. Low-carbohydrate dieting has no effect on the kidney function of people who have type 2 diabetes.

Limiting carbohydrate consumption generally results in improved glucose control, although without long-term weight loss. Low-carbohydrate diets can be useful to help people with type 2 diabetes lose weight, but &quot;no single approach has been proven to be consistently superior.&quot; According to the ADA, people with diabetes should be &quot;developing healthy eating patterns rather than focusing on individual macronutrients, micronutrients, or single foods.&quot; They recommended that the carbohydrates in a diet should come from &quot;vegetables, legumes, fruits, dairy (milk and yogurt), and whole grains&quot;, while highly refined foods and sugary drinks should be avoided. For individuals with type 2 diabetes who can&#x27;t meet the glycemic targets or where reducing anti-glycemic medications is a priority, the ADA says that low or very-low carbohydrate diets are a viable approach.

A 2021 umbrella review found that low-carbohydrate diets are no better for weight loss than higher-carbohydrate or low-fat diets in diabetic patients.

=== Exercise and fatigue ===
A low-carbohydrate diet has been found to reduce endurance capacity for intense exercise efforts, and depleted muscle glycogen following such efforts is only slowly replenished if a low-carbohydrate diet is taken. Inadequate carbohydrate intake during athletic training causes metabolic acidosis, which may be responsible for the impaired performance which has been observed.

=== Safety ===
A low-carbohydrate diet causes extensive metabolism of fatty acids, which are used by the liver to make ketone bodies, which provide energy to important organs, including the brain, heart, and kidneys, in a condition called ketosis. Ketosis can have other causes such as alcoholism and diabetes. Excessive accumulation of ketone bodies occurs when its production is greater than consumption, leading to ketoacidosis, a potentially life-threatening condition. Rarely, a low-carbohydrate ketogenic diet can also give rise to ketoacidosis, especially in patients with comorbid conditions. There are infrequent case reports of ketoacidosis occurring in people who follow low-carbohydrate diets such as the Atkins and South Beach diets. This has led to the suggestion that ketoacidosis should be considered a potential hazard of low-carbohydrate dieting.

High- and low-carbohydrate diets that are rich in animal-derived proteins and fats may be associated with increased mortality. Conversely, with plant-derived proteins and fats, there may be a decrease of mortality. A 2021 study from Japan looked at the long-term aspects of low-carb eating. The study included 90,171 participants with a median 17 years of follow-up. The study found that a high adherence to low-carb eating was associated with increased overall cancer risk. Looking at the diet composition the authors found that eating more animals foods was associated with an increased cancer risk while plant fat consumption was not.

, research has paid insufficient attention to the potential adverse effects of carbohydrate restricted dieting, particularly for micronutrient sufficiency, bone health and cancer risk. One low-quality meta-analysis reported that adverse effects could include &quot;constipation, headache, halitosis, muscle cramps and general weakness&quot;.

In a comprehensive systematic review of 2018, Churuangsuk and colleagues reported that other case reports give rise to concerns of other potential risks of low-carbohydrate dieting including hyperosmolar coma, Wernicke&#x27;s encephalopathy, optic neuropathy from thiamine deficiency, acute coronary syndrome and anxiety disorder.

Significantly restricting the proportion of carbohydrate in diet risks causing malnutrition, and can make it difficult to get enough dietary fiber to stay healthy.

As of 2014, it appeared that with respect to the risk of death for people with cardiovascular disease, the kind of carbohydrates consumed are important; diets relatively higher in fiber and whole grains lead to reduced risk of death from cardiovascular disease compared to diets high in refined grains.

== History ==

=== First descriptions ===
In 1797, John Rollo reported on the results of treating two diabetic Army officers with a low-carbohydrate diet and medications. A very low-carbohydrate diet was the standard treatment for diabetes throughout the nineteenth century.

In 1825, Jean Brillat-Savarin promoted a low-carb diet in his book, &quot;The Physiology of Taste&quot;.

In 1863, William Banting, a formerly obese English undertaker and coffin maker, published &quot;Letter on Corpulence Addressed to the Public&quot;, in which he described a diet for weight control giving up bread, butter, milk, sugar, beer, and potatoes. His booklet was widely read, so much so that some people used the term &quot;Banting&quot; for the activity now called &quot;dieting&quot;.

Physicians who advocated a low-carbohydrate diet consisting of large amounts of animal fat and protein to treat diabetes in the late 1800s include James Lomax Bardsley, Apollinaire Bouchardat and Frederick William Pavy. Arnaldo Cantani isolated his diabetic patients in locked rooms and prescribed them an exclusive animal-based diet.

In the early 1900s Frederick Madison Allen developed a highly restrictive short term regime which was described by Walter R. Steiner at the 1916 annual convention of the Connecticut State Medical Society as &quot;The Starvation Treatment of Diabetes Mellitus&quot;. This diet was often administered in a hospital in order to better ensure compliance and safety.

=== Modern low-carbohydrate diets ===

Other low-carbohydrate diets in the 1960s included the Air Force diet, &quot;Martinis &amp; Whipped Cream&quot; in 1966, and the Drinking Man&#x27;s Diet. In 1972, Robert Atkins published &quot;Dr. Atkins&#x27; Diet Revolution&quot;, which advocated the low-carbohydrate diet he had successfully used in treating people in the 1960s. The book was a publishing success, but was widely criticized by the mainstream medical community as being dangerous and misleading, thereby limiting its appeal at the time.

The concept of the glycemic index was developed in 1981 by David Jenkins to account for variances in speed of digestion of different types of carbohydrates. This concept classifies foods according to the rapidity of their effect on blood sugar levelswith fast-digesting simple carbohydrates causing a sharper increase and slower-digesting complex carbohydrates, such as whole grains, a slower one. Jenkins&#x27;s research laid the scientific groundwork for subsequent low-carbohydrate diets.

In 1992, Atkins published an update from his 1972 book, &quot;Dr. Atkins&#x27; New Diet Revolution&quot;, and other doctors began to publish books based on the same principles. During the late 1990s and early 2000s, low-carbohydrate diets became some of the most popular diets in the US. By some accounts, up to 18% of the population was using one type of low-carbohydrate diet or another at the peak of their popularity. Food manufacturers and restaurant chains noted the trend, as it affected their businesses. Parts of the mainstream medical community have denounced low-carbohydrate diets as being dangerous to health, such as the AHA in 2001 and the American Kidney Fund in 2002.

==== Ketogenic diet ====

The original ketogenic diet is a high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet developed in the 1920s and used to treat drug-resistant childhood epilepsy. Most epilepsy specialists order these children to eat 80% of the diet from fat by weight (90% of calories), plus carbohydrate-free vitamins and minerals to prevent vitamin deficiency. Although this extreme diet plan can be life-saving compared to the alternative, it is not a harmless diet. Children on this diet are at risk of broken bones, stunted growth, kidney stones, high cholesterol, and micronutrient deficiency. 

The fad diet that adopted the same name is also a high-fat, low-carb diet, but with a lower fat content. A typical version of this keto diet for adults has about 50% of food by weight coming from fat (70% of calories). Proponents claim that it induces weight loss. The premise of the weight-loss ketogenic diet is that if the body is deprived of glucose obtained from carbohydrate foods, it will produce energy from stored fat. There are some different approaches to a keto diet, including:

* &quot;ketogenic diet&quot; (KD) – usually less than 50 grams of carbohydrates per day (assuming total intake of 2,000 calories).
* &quot;very low-calorie ketogenic diet&quot; (VLCKD) – same as KD, but limits total calories to a maximum of 800 calories per day.
* &quot;ketogenic low-carbohydrate high-fat diet&quot; (K-LCHF) – same as KD, with the additional restriction of 60 to 80% of calories coming from fat. 
* &quot;modified Atkins diet&quot; (MAD) – fewer carbohydrates than K-LCHF (less than 10 grams per day), and encourages high-fat foods without specifying a specific required amount.

A very low calorie ketogenic diet that is high in fat but low in protein is an effective means for weight loss in those who are overweight or obese, yielding an average weight loss of 10 kg over four weeks, with maintenance of the weight loss for up to two years. However, concerns about serum sodium levels led researchers to propose the diet only be used in &quot;selected&quot; people, and under strict medical supervision.

In 2021 the American Heart Association issued a scientific statement on dietary guidance to improve cardiovascular health which noted that &quot;there is insufficient evidence to support any existing popular or fad diets such as the ketogenic diet and intermittent fasting to promote heart health&quot;.

<doc id="459575" wikidata="Q1153004" url="?curid=459575" title="Gordon MacRae">
<text>Albert Gordon MacRae (March 12, 1921 – January 24, 1986) was an American actor, singer, and television and radio host. He appeared in the film versions of two Rodgers and Hammerstein musicals, &quot;Oklahoma!&quot; (1955) and &quot;Carousel&quot; (1956), and played the leading man opposite Doris Day in &quot;On Moonlight Bay&quot; (1951) and sequel &quot;By The Light of the Silvery Moon&quot; (1953).

==Early life==
Gordon MacRae was born in East Orange, New Jersey, to parents William LaMont MacRae, a toolmaker and radio singer, and Helen Violet Sonn, a concert pianist. His father was descended from Clan MacRae. MacRae attended Nottingham High School in Syracuse, New York, where he was active in the Drama Club. He later attended and graduated in 1940 from Deerfield Academy in Deerfield, Massachusetts, and thereafter served as a navigator in IX Troop Carrier Command in the United States Army Air Forces during World War II.

==Career==
===Singer===
MacRae was a baritone. Winning a contest enabled him to sing at the 1939 New York World&#x27;s Fair with the Harry James and Les Brown orchestras.

===Broadway===
He made his Broadway debut in 1942, acquiring his first recording contract soon afterwards. Many of his recordings were made with Jo Stafford.

===Radio===
On the radio in 1945, his talents were showcased on the &quot;Gordon MacRae Show&quot; on the CBS network in collaboration with the conductor Archie Bleyer. In 1946, his fifteen minute variety show &quot;Skyline Roof&quot; also featured emerging musical talent, including the accordionist John Serry Sr. MacRae was also the host and lead actor on &quot;The Railroad Hour&quot;, a half-hour anthology series made up of condensed versions of hit Broadway musicals. The programs were later released as popular studio cast albums, most of which have been reissued on CD.

In 1946, he was in the revue &quot;Three to Make Ready&quot;, which ran for 326 performances.

===Film===
MacRae signed a contract with Warner Bros. in 1947. In 1948, he appeared in his first film, &quot;The Big Punch&quot;, a drama about boxing. He followed this with a film noir with Virginia Mayo, &quot;Backfire&quot; (made in 1948, released 1950).

MacRae&#x27;s first on-screen musical was &quot;Look for the Silver Lining&quot; (1949), a biopic of Marilyn Miller (June Haver), where MacRae played Frank Carter. David Butler directed. MacRae was reunited with Haver and Butler in &quot;The Daughter of Rosie O&#x27;Grady&quot; (1950). Warners put him in a Western, &quot;Return of the Frontiersman&quot; (1950). Then he starred with Doris Day in &quot;Tea for Two&quot; (1950), a reworking of &quot;No, No, Nanette&quot;, also for Butler. Public response was enthusiastic. MacRae and Day were teamed again in &quot;The West Point Story&quot; (1950) starring James Cagney and Mayo, &quot;On Moonlight Bay&quot; (1951), and the all-star Korean War tribute, &quot;Starlift&quot; (1951).

MacRae was in a military school musical, &quot;About Face&quot; (1952) with Eddie Bracken, then he and Day did a sequel to &quot;On Moonlight Bay&quot;, &quot;By the Light of the Silvery Moon&quot; (1953). That same year, he starred opposite Kathryn Grayson in the third film version of &quot;The Desert Song&quot; and teamed with Jane Powell in &quot;Three Sailors and a Girl&quot; (1953). MacRae&#x27;s best known film role was Curly in the big screen adaptation of &quot;Oklahoma!&quot; (1955) alongside Shirley Jones. He and Jones were used on another Rodgers and Hammerstein adaptation, &quot;Carousel&quot; (1956), at 20th Century Fox (now 20th Century Studios). MacRae played Buddy De Sylva in &quot;The Best Things in Life Are Free&quot; (1956) for 20th Century-Fox.

===Television===
MacRae was host and singer on &quot;The Gordon MacRae Show&quot; on NBC in 1956. He appeared frequently on television, on such variety programs as &quot;The Ford Show, Starring Tennessee Ernie Ford&quot;. He also appeared on drama shows such as &quot;Lux Video Theatre&quot;.

During Christmas 1958, MacRae and Ford performed the Christmas hymn &quot;O Holy Night&quot;. Earlier in 1958, MacRae guest-starred on the short-lived NBC variety series &quot;The Polly Bergen Show&quot;.

He starred in the TV musical &quot;The Gift of the Magi&quot; (1958). Thereafter, MacRae appeared on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;, &quot;The Dinah Shore Chevy Show&quot;, &quot;The Pat Boone Chevy Showroom&quot;, and &quot;The Bell Telephone Hour&quot;.

===Later career===
MacRae guest starred on &quot;McCloud&quot;. He had supporting roles in the films &quot;Zero to Sixty&quot; (1978) and &quot;The Pilot&quot; (1980).

==Personal life==
MacRae was married to Sheila MacRae from 1941 until 1967. They met on the set of a play and it was &quot;love at first sight.&quot; The couple were the parents of four children, including actresses Heather and Meredith MacRae. Sheila later married television producer Ronald Wayne.

MacRae&#x27;s second marriage was to Elizabeth Lambert Schrafft on September 25, 1967, and together they had one daughter. They remained married until his death. He battled alcohol problems for many years, but overcame them by the late 1970s.

MacRae had cancer of the mouth and jaw. He died in 1986 of pneumonia, at his home in Lincoln, Nebraska, aged 64. He was buried at the Wyuka Cemetery in Lincoln, Nebraska.

<doc id="459582" wikidata="Q4862824" url="?curid=459582" title="Baron St John of Bletso">
<text>Baron St John of Bletso, in the County of Bedford, is a title in the Peerage of England. It was created in 1582 for Oliver St John.

For a period, the title Baron St John was subsumed within the title Earl of Bolingbroke which was granted to the fourth Baron. The Earldom died out with the third Earl, but the Barony continued via another branch which had since become the baronet line. The eldest son of the 1st Earl was advanced to the barony by Writ of acceleration under King Charles I to become the 5th Baron. However he died in the civil war without becoming Earl, This resulted in the existence of an additional baron in the sequence but this was not taken into account by the family when the barony was continued.

Hence there is a discrepancy between the complete numbered series used by Burke and Debrett, and the numbering series in use by the family, particularly in the 18th and 19th century. Hence the numbers on family graves of this time are one less than the numbers used in the principal peerage registers that form the basis for this article.

==History==
According to Horace Round (1901) the St John family of Bletso are descended from the St Johns of Fonmon Castle in Glamorgan, Wales. Again according to Round, this was possibly a cadet branch of St John of Basing, Hampshire, and Halnaker, Sussex, which family descended in the male line from the Norman Hugh de Port (d.1091) lord of the manor of Port-en-Bessin in Normandy who took part in the Norman Conquest of England in 1066, and was subsequently granted 53 manors in Hampshire. However according to Brownhill (1931) the male ancestry of St John of Bletso cannot be traced further back than Alexander de St John (fl.1340) of Instow in Devon.

Oliver St John, the 1st Baron was the great-great-grandson of Sir John St John (died c. 1482), eldest son of Sir John Oliver St John of Bletso (died 1437), the husband of Margaret, great-great-granddaughter of Roger de Beauchamp (died 1380), who was summoned to Parliament as Baron Beauchamp of Bletso from 1363 to 1379. Since then that title had not been assumed although Oliver St John was considered to be the line of heir. He was succeeded by his son, the second Baron. He was one of the peers who sat during the trial of Mary, Queen of Scots. He died without male heirs and the claim to the barony of Beauchamp of Bletsoe passed to his daughter Anne, the wife of William Howard, Lord Howard Effingham, eldest son and heir of Charles Howard, 1st Earl of Nottingham.

He was succeeded in the barony of St John of Bletsoe by his younger brother, the third Baron. The latter&#x27;s son, the fourth Baron, was created Earl of Bolingbroke in 1624. His eldest son and heir apparent, Oliver St John, was in 1641 summoned to the House of Lords through a writ of acceleration in his father&#x27;s junior title of Baron St John of Bletsoe. However, he predeceased his father (killed at the Battle of Edgehill in 1642) but due to the writ of acceleration issued he is known as the fifth Baron St John of Bletsoe. The Earl was succeeded by his grandson, the second Earl. He was the son of Sir Paulet St John, younger son of the first Earl. He died childless and was succeeded by his younger brother, the third Earl, who represented Bedford in the House of Commons. He never married and on his death in 1711 the earldom became extinct.

The barony was inherited by his second cousin once removed, Sir Paulet St Andrew St John, 5th Baronet, who became the eighth Baron. He was the great-great-grandson of the Hon. Sir Rowland St John, fourth son of the third Baron (see below for more information on the baronetcy). His cousin&#x27;s son, the fourteenth Baron, sat as a Member of Parliament for Bedfordshire. His grandson, the seventeenth Baron, served as Lord Lieutenant of Bedfordshire from 1905 to 1912. the titles are held by the latter&#x27;s great-grandson, the twenty-second Baron, who succeeded his father in 1978. He is one of the ninety elected hereditary peers that remain in the House of Lords after the passing of the House of Lords Act 1999, and sits as a cross-bencher.

The St John Baronetcy, of Woodford in the County of Northampton, was created in the Baronetage of England in 1660 for Oliver St John. He was the son of the Hon. Sir Rowland St John, fourth son of the third Baron St John of Bletsoe. His son, the second Baronet, represented Northamptonshire in the House of Commons. The latter&#x27;s grandson, the fifth Baronet, succeeded as eighth Baron St John of Bletsoe in 1711 (see above for later history of the titles).

Oliver St John (died c. 1497), younger brother of the aforementioned Sir John St John (died c. 1482), was the ancestor of the Viscounts Grandison and the Viscounts Bolingbroke and St John.

<doc id="459583" wikidata="Q7873708" url="?curid=459583" title="USS Sabine (1855)">
<text>The first USS &quot;Sabine&quot; was a sailing frigate built by the United States Navy in 1855. The ship was among the first ships to see action in the American Civil War. In 1862, a large portion of the crew were volunteers from the &quot;Sabine&quot;.

She was built at the New York Navy Yard. Her keel was laid in 1822, but she was not launched until 3 February 1855. During this period, she underwent various alterations, the most extensive being a lengthening of her hull by twenty feet. Built essentially from plans, she was commissioned on 23 August 1858, Capt. Henry A. Adams in command.

==Service history==

===Paraguay Expedition and Home Fleet, 1858–1861===

Her first cruise took the frigate to Montevideo and Buenos Aires in October 1858 with the Paraguay expedition, a task force commanded by Flag Officer William B. Shubrick, after that country&#x27;s firing on . She conveyed Commissioner Bowlin and served as flagship during the voyage to South America, but was not officially considered part of the expedition fleet, &quot;as she was not designed to act against Paraguay, not being able to ascend the river&quot;. The expedition won the United States an indemnity and a renewed treaty. &quot;Sabine&quot; then operated out of New York with the Home Fleet until July 1861.

===Civil War, 1861–1865===

Through July and August, she was out of commission at Portsmouth Naval Shipyard. Recommissioning on 30 August, she was ordered to join the Atlantic Blockading Squadron on 9 September.

During the Civil War, &quot;Sabine&quot; was actively employed along the east coast searching for Confederate raiders. She participated in the relief and reinforcement of Fort Pickens, Florida, in April 1861, under command of Capt. Adams; the rescue of 500 marines and the crew of chartered troop transport &quot;Governor&quot; during a violent storm off South Carolina on 2 and 3 November 1861; the search for in March 1862, after the ship-of-the-line had been badly damaged by a storm while sailing to Port Royal, South Carolina; and the hunt for CSS &quot;Alabama&quot; in October 1862 and CSS &quot;Tacony&quot; in June 1863.

&quot;Sabine&quot; returned to New York for blockade duty with the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron until ordered in August 1864 to Norfolk, Virginia as a training ship for Navy apprentices and landsmen.

===Training ship, 1865–1877===
After the war, she was transferred to New London, Connecticut for the same purpose until 1868. In 1867, an apprentice on &quot;Sabine&quot;, Frank Du Moulin, was awarded the Medal of Honor for rescuing a crewmate who had fallen from the rigging into the water. In 1869 and 1870, the ship conducted midshipman training cruises to European and Mediterranean ports. In 1871 &quot;Sabine&quot; was repaired at Boston; and, from 1872 to 1876, she served as a receiving ship at Portsmouth, New Hampshire. In 1877, she was laid up until she was sold on 23 September 1883 at Portsmouth to J.L. Snow of Rockland, Maine.

== Memorials ==
The last remaining armament from the &quot;Sabine&quot;, a 6.4 inch 100 Pounder Parrott Rifled Naval Cannon, currently resides on display outside the Grand Traverse County courthouse in Traverse City, Michigan. It was one of the two 100-pounder rifled cannons that were mounted on swiveling carriages on the &quot;Sabine&quot;. The cannon was donated to Grand Traverse County by Senator William Alden Smith in 1910.

<doc id="459586" wikidata="Q655996" url="?curid=459586" title="The Devils (film)">
<text>The Devils is a 1971 historical psychological horror-drama film written, produced and directed by Ken Russell, and starring Vanessa Redgrave and Oliver Reed. A dramatised historical account of the fall of Urbain Grandier, a 17th-century Roman Catholic priest accused of witchcraft after the possessions in Loudun, France, the plot also focuses on Sister Jeanne des Anges, a sexually repressed nun who incites the accusations.

A co-production between the United Kingdom and the United States, &quot;The Devils&quot; is in part adapted from the 1952 non-fiction book &quot;The Devils of Loudun&quot; by Aldous Huxley, as well as John Whiting&#x27;s subsequent 1960 play &quot;The Devils&quot;. United Artists initially pitched the idea to Russell but bowed out after reading his finished screenplay, as they felt it was too controversial in nature. Warner Bros. agreed to produce and distribute, and filming largely took place at Pinewood Studios in late 1970.

The film&#x27;s graphic portrayal of violent and sexual content, often combined with religion, ignited harsh reaction from censors, and it originally received an X rating in both the United Kingdom and the United States. It was banned in several countries, and heavily edited for exhibition in others. Although critics largely dismissed the film for its explicit content, it won awards for Best Director at the 33rd Venice International Film Festival, as well as from the U.S. National Board of Review. Although a restoration of Russell&#x27;s director&#x27;s cut of &quot;The Devils&quot; was given its first theatrical release in the UK in 2002, this version has not been made officially available on home media, and releases of edited versions of the film on DVD and streaming services remain scant.

Film scholarship primarily focuses on themes of sexual repression and political corruption. &quot;The Devils&quot; has been recognized as one of the most controversial films of all time by numerous publications and critics, and remained banned in Finland until 2001.

==Plot==
In 17th-century France, Cardinal Richelieu is influencing Louis XIII in an attempt to gain further power. He convinces Louis that the fortifications of cities throughout France should be demolished to prevent Protestants from rising up. Louis agrees, but forbids Richelieu from carrying out demolitions in the town of Loudun, having made a promise to its Governor not to damage the town.

Meanwhile, in Loudun, the Governor has died, leaving control of the city to Urbain Grandier, a dissolute, proud and popular priest. He is having an affair with a relative of Father Canon Jean Mignon, another priest in the town; Grandier is, however, unaware that the neurotic, hunchbacked Sister Jeanne des Anges, the abbess of the local Ursuline convent, is sexually obsessed with him. Sister Jeanne asks for Grandier to become the convent&#x27;s new confessor. Grandier secretly marries another woman, Madeleine De Brou, but news of this reaches Sister Jeanne, who becomes jealous. When Madeleine returns a book by Ursuline foundress Angela Merici that Sister Jeanne had earlier lent her, the abbess attacks her and accuses her of being a &quot;fornicator&quot; and &quot;sacrilegious&quot;.

Baron Jean de Laubardemont arrives with orders to demolish the city&#x27;s walls, overriding Grandier&#x27;s orders to stop. Grandier summons the town&#x27;s soldiers and forces Laubardemont to back down pending the arrival of an order for the demolition from King Louis. Grandier departs Loudun to visit the King. In the meantime, Sister Jeanne is informed by Father Mignon that he is to be their new confessor. She informs him of Grandier&#x27;s marriage and affairs, and also inadvertently accuses Grandier of witchcraft and of possessing her, which Mignon relays to Laubardemont. In the process, the information is pared down to just the claim that Grandier has bewitched the convent and dealt with the Devil. With Grandier away from Loudon, Laubardemont and Mignon decide to find evidence against him.

Laubardemont summons inquisitor Father Pierre Barre, a &quot;professional witch-hunter&quot;, whose interrogations involve depraved acts of &quot;exorcism&quot;, including the forced administration of enemas to his victims. Sister Jeanne claims that Grandier has bewitched her, and the other nuns do the same. A public exorcism erupts in a church, in which the nuns remove their clothes and enter a state of &quot;religious&quot; frenzy. Duke Henri de Condé (actually King Louis in disguise) arrives, claiming to be carrying a holy relic which can exorcise the &quot;devils&quot; possessing the nuns. Father Barre then proceeds to use the relic in &quot;exorcising&quot; the nuns, who then act as though they have been cured—until Condé/Louis reveals the case allegedly containing the relic to be empty. The possessions and the exorcisms then continue unabated, descending into a massive orgy in which the nuns remove the crucifix from above the high altar and masturbate with it.

During the chaos, Grandier and Madeleine return. Grandier denies bewitching the nuns and condemns Sister Jeanne, but he and Madeleine are arrested nonetheless. The nuns are returned to the convent, where Sister Jeanne attempts to hang herself, but is cut down before she dies. After being given a show trial, Grandier is shaven and tortured. The judges sentence Grandier to death by burning at the stake. Laubardemont has also obtained permission to destroy the city&#x27;s fortifications. Despite pressure to confess to the charges, Grandier refuses, and is taken to be burnt at the stake. His executioner promises to strangle him rather than let him suffer death by fire, but Barre starts the fire himself, and Mignon, visibly panic-stricken about the possibility of Grandier&#x27;s innocence, pulls the noose tight before it can be used to strangle Grandier. As Grandier burns, Laubardemont orders for explosive charges to be set off and the city walls are blown up, causing the revelling townspeople to flee.

After the execution, Barre leaves Loudun to continue his witch-hunting activities elsewhere in the Vienne region of Nouvelle-Aquitaine. Laubardemont informs Sister Jeanne that Mignon has been put away in an asylum for claiming that Grandier was innocent, and that &quot;with no signed confession to prove otherwise, everyone has the same opinion&quot;. He gives her Grandier&#x27;s charred femur and leaves. Sister Jeanne kisses and masturbates with the bone. Madeleine, having been released, walks over the rubble of Loudun&#x27;s walls and out of the ruined city.

==Themes==

Addressing the film&#x27;s initial reaction among critics, social groups and Warner Bros. executives, film historian Tim Lucas describes &quot;The Devils&quot; as &quot;not merely an indictment of 17th Century conspiracies, but an indictment of political agendas which have been with us throughout the course of human history. When government is at its most immoral, history shows that it tends to ally itself with the Church, and to deflect public attention from its own corruption by demonizing convenient scapegoats—artists, philosophers, progressives... in a word, &quot;liberals&quot;.&quot; Comparing Grandier&#x27;s demonization to various issues of contention in the United States during various decades of the 20th century, from alcohol in the 1920s to tobacco smoking in the 1990s, he notes that although public opinion on such issues evolves over time, the film articulates that &quot;in the crossfire of ideals and oratory, lives are sometimes destroyed.&quot;

Meanwhile, film scholar Thomas Atkins attests that, while &quot;The Devils&quot; contains overt themes regarding religion and political influence, the film is more concerned with &quot;sex and sexual aberrations&quot;. He interprets the film as being centrally thematically interested in sexual repression and its cumulative effects on the human psyche. Commenting on the Sister Jeanne character, Atkins writes: &quot;There are any number of examples of tormented visualization involving the Mother Superior...  What more stunning visual metaphor for the psychological suffocation of the Mother Superior than to stuff her deformed body into a tiny lookout space from which she watches her fantasy lover? The mere confinement of mass in congested space creates an understanding of the annihilating pleasures of her sexual drive.&quot; Atkins likens Sister Jeanne&#x27;s erotic fantasy sequences to &quot;eroticism from a deranged consciousness&quot;. Filmmaker Alex Cox concurs with this point, stating that &quot;The Devils&quot; &quot;could have been a turgid tale of human rights versus intolerance&quot;, but instead became something &quot;much more: an intense, at times surreal, at times hideously realistic story of sexual obsession and oppression&quot;.

The color white is featured significantly, specifically in the design of the cityscape, which largely consists of overtly white stone structures. Atkins insists that through this use of blank white, Russell establishes a &quot;leitmotif of whiteness which resists and dissolves natural relationships&quot;; Adam Scovell further notes that the &quot;horrifying white-clean aesthetic&quot; of Russell and Jarman&#x27;s vision of Loudun appears to be inspired by Sister Jeanne&#x27;s exorcism being compared to a &quot;rape in a public lavatory&quot; in the Huxley novel.

==Production==
===Development===

In November 1965, following the Broadway opening of John Whiting&#x27;s 1961 play &quot;The Devils&quot;—which was based on Aldous Huxley&#x27;s non-fiction book &quot;The Devils of Loudun&quot; (1952), about the alleged 17th-century possessions in Loudun, France—producer Alexander H. Cohen announced plans to adapt the play for film, revealing that he had made a formal offer to Huxley&#x27;s estate for the rights. After Cohen&#x27;s deal failed to materialize, United Artists signed a deal with producer Robert H. Solo to make the adaptation in August 1969. Following the success of Ken Russell&#x27;s &quot;Women in Love&quot; (1969) in the United States, United Artists suggested to Russell that he adapt &quot;The Devils of Loudun&quot;. According to journalist John Baxter and Russell&#x27;s widow Lisi Tribble, he was familiar with the story by the time United Artists proposed the project to him, having watched a production of Whiting&#x27;s play in London and subsequently being inspired to research its historical basis. Russell said that &quot;when I first read the story, I was knocked out by it—it was just so shocking—and I wanted others to be knocked out by it, too. I felt I had to make it.&quot; Russell later said at the time he made the film: &quot;I was a devout Catholic and very secure in my faith. I knew I wasn&#x27;t making a pornographic film... although I am not a political creature, I always viewed &quot;The Devils&quot; as my one political film. To me it was about brainwashing, about the state taking over.&quot; Though Russell admired Whiting&#x27;s play, his screenplay mainly drew from Huxley&#x27;s book as he found the play &quot;too sentimental&quot;.

Some extraneous elements incorporated into the screenplay were not found in either source, including details about the plague, which were supplied by Russell&#x27;s brother-in-law, a scholar of French history. Upon studying Grandier, Russell felt that he &quot;represented the paradox of the Catholic church...  Grandier is a priest but he is also a man, and that puts him into some absurd situations.&quot; In Russell&#x27;s original screenplay, the role of Sister Jeanne of the Angels, the disabled Mother Superior, was significantly larger, and continued after Grandier&#x27;s execution. However, in order to shorten the lengthy screenplay, Russell was forced to cut down the role.

United Artists announced the film in August 1969, with Solo to produce under a three-picture deal with the studio, and Russell to direct. Filming was set to start in May 1970. However, after United Artists executives read the screenplay, they &quot;refused to touch it&quot;, abandoning plans to fund the production. At the time, production designer Derek Jarman had already constructed some of the sets for the film. It was subsequently acquired by Warner Bros., who signed on in March 1970 to distribute the film.

===Casting===

Oliver Reed, who had worked with Russell previously on &quot;Women in Love&quot;, was cast as Urbain Grandier, the philandering doomed priest. Richard Johnson, who had portrayed Grandier in a stage production of &quot;The Devils&quot;, had originally been attached to the project in 1969, but eventually dropped out of the production. Reed agreed to do the film for a percentage of the profits. Gemma Jones was cast as Madeleine de Brou, Grandier&#x27;s wife. Sister Jeanne des Anges was originally to be played by Glenda Jackson, who had starred opposite Reed in Russell&#x27;s &quot;Women in Love&quot;, as well as in Russell&#x27;s &quot;The Music Lovers&quot; (1971). However, Jackson turned down the role saying: &quot;I don&#x27;t want to play any more neurotic sex starved parts.&quot; Russell later claimed that he felt Jackson had actually turned down the role because it had been truncated from his original screenplay. Jackson was replaced by Vanessa Redgrave.

Max Adrian was cast as inquisitor Ibert (in his second-to-last film performance), while Dudley Sutton, who had become a cult figure for his performance in &quot;The Leather Boys&quot; (1964), agreed to appear in the film as Baron de Laubardemont. Sutton recalled that all of the &quot;respectable actors turned it down. They thought it was blasphemous, which it is not.&quot; In the role of Father Mignon, a priest who attempts to usurp Grandier&#x27;s power, Russell cast Murray Melvin, despite the fact that he was decades younger than the character, who was intended to be in his eighties. Michael Gothard, an English character actor, was cast as self-professed witch hunter Father Barre. Russell cast Christopher Logue, an occasional actor who was mainly known as a poet and literary scholar, as the vengeful Cardinal Richelieu.

As Philippe, the young woman Grandier impregnates, Russell cast television actress Georgina Hale. Judith Paris, originally a dancer, was cast as Sister Agnes, Richelieu&#x27;s niece who enters the convent under the guise of becoming a nun in order to gather information on Sister Jeanne. In the credits, her role is mislabeled as &quot;Sister Judith&quot;.

===Filming===
Filming began 17 August 1970 in London at Pinewood Studios. &quot;The Devils&quot; marked Jarman&#x27;s debut in the film industry; having previously worked in theatre, he was introduced to Russell by his friend, Hornsey College of Art teacher Janet Detuer and agreed to work on the film after seeing &quot;Women in Love&quot;. His set for Loudun, which took three months to design, was the largest set constructed on Pinewood&#x27;s backlot since &quot;Cleopatra&quot; (1963), and was influenced by the works of neoclassical artists such as Claude Nicolas Ledoux, Étienne-Louis Boullée and Giovanni Battista Piranesi. Russell and Jarman were further influenced by the blank white sets of Carl Theodor Dreyer&#x27;s &quot;The Passion of Joan of Arc&quot; (1928) and the cityscape in Fritz Lang&#x27;s &quot;Metropolis&quot; (1927). The interiors of many buildings, specifically the convent, were crafted with plaster and made to appear as masonry; the plaster designs were then nailed to plywood framework. According to Christopher Hobbs, the film&#x27;s prop designer, Jarman &quot;was very inexperienced, and found the work exhaustive and difficult&quot;, but Russell was very supportive of his ideas and designs.

Director Russell hired a large cast of extras, whom he later referred to as &quot;a bad bunch&quot; who were demanding, and alleged that one of the female extras appearing as a civilian was sexually assaulted by another male extra. Jones recalled that Reed, who at the time had a reputation for being disruptive and confrontational, was extremely kind to her on set, and &quot;behaved impeccably&quot;. Sutton recalled of Redgrave that she was &quot;always an adventurous type of person&quot; on the set, in terms of exploring her character and interacting with the other performers. Russell echoed this sentiment, referring to Redgrave as &quot;one of the least bothersome actresses I could ever wish for; she just threw herself into it.&quot;

Additional photography occurred at Bamburgh Castle in Northumberland, England. Jones recalled filming at the castle as challenging due to cold weather and having the flu during this period of the shoot, to which Russell was &quot;frightfully unsympathetic&quot;. Throughout the shoot, Russell and Reed clashed frequently, and by the time principal photography had finished, the two were hardly on speaking terms.

===Music===
The film&#x27;s score was composed for a small ensemble by Peter Maxwell Davies. Russell was reportedly intrigued by Davies&#x27; composition &quot;Eight Songs for a Mad King&quot;, which had provoked strong reactions when it was premiered in 1969. Davies reportedly took the job because he was interested in the late medieval and Renaissance historical period depicted in the film. He went on to write a score for Russell&#x27;s next film, &quot;The Boy Friend&quot;. Australian promoter James Murdoch, who was also Davies&#x27; agent, was involved in organising the music for both these films.

The score was recorded by Davies&#x27; regular collaborators the Fires of London who took on extra players as the score required more instruments than their basic line-up. Davies&#x27; music is complemented by period music (including a couple of numbers from &quot;Terpsichore&quot;), performed by the Early Music Consort of London under the direction of David Munrow.
In 1974, the Fires of London and the Early Music Consort of London gave a performance of a concert suite of the music at the Proms. &quot;Terpsichore&quot;, which was not well known when the film was made, has become a popular choice for concert hall performances, and Davies&#x27; contributions to the soundtrack have also been revived in the concert hall.

==Release and reception==
===Box office===
&quot;The Devils&quot; was one of the most popular films in 1972 at the British box office, earning theatrical rentals of approximately $8–9 million in Europe. It was also popular in Italy. With an additional $2 million in the United States and Canada from a limited release, its worldwide rentals total roughly $11 million.

===Critical reception===
&quot;The Devils&quot; received significant negative critical reaction upon its release due to its &quot;outrageous&quot;, &quot;overheated&quot;, and &quot;pornographic&quot; nature. The film was publicly condemned by the Vatican, who, though acknowledging that it contained some artistic merit, asked that its screenings at the Venice International Film Festival be cancelled. Judith Crist called the film a &quot;grand fiesta for sadists and perverts&quot;, while Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film a rare zero-star rating, sarcastically mocking it as overly self-important. Pauline Kael wrote in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; that Russell &quot;doesn&#x27;t report hysteria, he markets it.&quot; Vincent Canby, writing for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, noted that the film contains &quot;silly, melodramatic effects&quot;, and felt that the performances were hindered by the nature of the screenplay, writing: &quot;Oliver Reed suggests some recognizable humanity as poor Father Grandier, but everyone else is ridiculous. Vanessa Redgrave, who can be, I think, a fine actress, plays Sister Jeanne with a plastic hump, a Hansel-and-Gretel giggle, and so much sibilance that when she says &#x27;Satan is ever ready to seduce us with sensual delights&#x27;, you might think that Groucho Marx had let the air out of her tires.&quot;

Charles Champlin of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; lambasted the film, writing that its message is &quot;not anti-clerical—there&#x27;s hardly enough clericalism to be anti anymore—it is anti-humanity. A rage against cruelty has become a celebration of it... you weep not for the evils and the ignorance of the past, but for the cleverness and sickness of the day.&quot; Ann Guarino of the New York &quot;Daily News&quot; noted that the film &quot;could not be more anti-Catholic in tone or more sensationalized in treatment&quot;, but conceded that the performances in the film were competent. The &quot;Ottawa Citizen&quot;″s Gordon Stoneham similarly felt the film had been over-sensationalized, noting that Russell focuses so much on the &quot;baroque effects, and concentrates so much on the Grand Guignol aspects of the affair, the narrative is never firmly in focus.&quot;

Bridget Byrne of the &quot;Los Angeles Herald Examiner&quot; alternately praised the film as &quot;brilliant, audacious, and grotesque&quot;, likening it to a fairytale, but added that audiences &quot;have to grasp its philosophy, work out the undercurrents of seriousness, close the structural gaps for [themselves], even as [they] are transported by a literal orgy of splendor.&quot; Writing for the Hackensack, New Jersey &quot;Record&quot;, John Crittenden praised the film&#x27;s visuals as &quot;genius&quot;, but criticised Reed&#x27;s performance while asserting that Redgrave was underused. Stephen Farber of &quot;The New York Times&quot; noted the film as an ambitious work, conceding that the &quot;ideas in Russell&#x27;s film may seem overly schematic, but his terrifying, fantastical nightmare images have astonishing psychological power.&quot;

On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;The Devils&quot; holds an approval rating of 70%, based on 33 reviews, and an average rating of 8.20/10. The website&#x27;s critics consensus reads, &quot;Grimly stylish, Ken Russell&#x27;s baroque opus is both provocative and persuasive in its contention that the greatest blasphemy is the leveraging of faith for power.&quot; On Metacritic, it has a weighted average score of 49 out of 100, based on 11 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average&quot; reviews.

===Censorship history===
The explicit sexual and violent content, paired with its commentary on religious institutions, resulted in significant censorship. Commenting on the controversial nature, Reed stated: &quot;We never set out to make a pretty Christian film. Charlton Heston made enough of those... The film is about twisted people.&quot; The British Board of Film Censors found the combination of religious themes and violent sexual imagery a serious challenge, particularly as the Board was being lobbied by socially conservative pressure groups such as the Festival of Light at the time of distribution. In order to gain a release and earn a British &#x27;X&#x27; certificate (suitable for those aged 18 and over), Russell made minor cuts to the more explicit nudity (mainly in the cathedral and convent sequences), details from the first exorcism (mainly that which indicated an anal insertion), some shots of the crushing of Grandier&#x27;s legs, and a pantomime sequence during the climactic burning. Russell later said:


The most significant cuts were made by Warner Bros., prior to submission to the BBFC. Two notable scenes were removed in their entirety: One was a two-and-a-half-minute sequence featuring naked nuns sexually defiling a statue of Christ, which includes Father Mignon looking down on the scene and masturbating. Another scene towards the end showed Sister Jeanne masturbating with the charred femur of Grandier following his burning at the stake. Due to its content, the former scene has been popularly referred to as the &quot;Rape of Christ&quot; sequence.

The British theatrical cut, which runs 111 minutes, was given an &#x27;X&#x27; certificate (no one under 18 years of age admitted); despite the BBFC&#x27;s approval of this version, it was banned in 17 local councils across Britain. In the United States, it was truncated further for theatrical exhibition: The Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) edited to approximately 108 minutes, and also awarded an &#x27;X&#x27; rating. Russell expressed frustration, commenting that they &quot;killed the key scene&quot; [the Rape of Christ] and that &quot;Warner Brothers cut out the best of &quot;The Devils&quot;.&quot; Speaking on the American version of the film, Russell said the cuts &quot;adversely affected the story, to the point where in America the film is disjointed and incomprehensible.&quot; In 1973, in anticipation of a reissue of the film coinciding with their release of &quot;The Exorcist&quot; (1973), Warner Bros. resubmitted the American version of &quot;The Devils&quot; to the MPAA after further removing several allusions to lesbianism prior to Sister Jeanne&#x27;s attempted suicide and a brief shot of Grandier&#x27;s shattered legs during the torture scene; this version was awarded an &#x27;R&#x27; rating. The film remained banned in Finland for over 30 years, until it was lifted in November 2001.

The director&#x27;s cut (approximately 117 minutes), with all aforementioned footage restored, was screened for the first time in London on 25 November 2002, along with a making-of documentary titled &quot;Hell on Earth&quot;, produced for Channel 4. The extended version was procured by Mark Kermode, who uncovered the footage in the Warner Bros. vaults. In a 2014 videoblog titled &quot;Kermode Uncut: What To Do About The Devils&quot;, Kermode revealed that Warner Bros. was responsible for blocking various efforts to allow the director&#x27;s cut of the film to be released on home media, as they considered the tone of the deleted material, specifically the &quot;Rape of Christ&quot; sequence, to be &quot;distasteful&quot;, and that they also had turned down offers from distributors such as The Criterion Collection interested in buying the film or acquiring the North American sublicensing rights.

===Accolades===
===Home media===
&quot;The Devils&quot; has had a complicated release history in home media formats, with various cuts being made available in different formats. The film made its America home media debut circa 1979–1980, when ON TV made the 1973 &#x27;R&#x27; rated version available as part of its late night programming. Warner Home Video released the film on VHS in the United States in 1983, labelled as featuring a 105-minute cut of the film; however, this is a misprint, as this edition actually runs 103 minutes, due to time compression. Warner reissued a VHS edition in 1995, with a corrected label of a 103-minute running time. On 30 May 1995, the UK theatrical version made its debut on British television as part of BBC2&#x27;s &quot;Forbidden Weekend&quot;, a series of films with troubled censorship histories; the screening was introduced by Cox and then-BBFC director James Ferman. This version was shown in a partially letterboxed aspect ratio of 1.80:1, with the credits being shown in the correct 2.35:1 ratio. Prior to this broadcast, the UK theatrical version had been shown on Sat.1 in Germany, with a 1.73:1 aspect ratio. A VHS was issued in the United Kingdom by Warner in 2002 as part of their &quot;Masters of the Movies&quot; series, reportedly running 104 minutes. However, according to film historian Richard Crouse, the VHS version available in the United Kingdom is identical to the American VHS editions, despite the labelled runtimes. Lucas notes that most VHS releases of the film featured either &quot;sloppy&quot; pan and scan work or poor letterboxing.

A bootlegged NTSC-format DVD was released by Angel Digital in 2005, with the excised footage reinstated, along with the &quot;Hell on Earth&quot; documentary included as a bonus feature. In 2008, it was suspected that Warner Home Video may have been planning a U.S. DVD release for the film, as cover artwork was leaked on the internet. However, Warner responded to the claim by deeming the leaked news an &quot;error&quot;. In June 2010, Warner released &quot;The Devils&quot; in a 108-minute version for purchase and rental through the iTunes Store, but the title was removed without explanation three days later.

On 19 March 2012, the British Film Institute released a two-disc DVD featuring the 111-minute UK theatrical version (sped up to 107 minutes to accommodate the technicalities of PAL colour). The BFI release also includes the Kermode documentary &quot;Hell on Earth&quot;, as well as a vintage documentary shot during the production entitled &quot;Directing Devils&quot;, among other features.

In March 2017, streaming service Shudder began carrying the 109-minute U.S. release version of &quot;The Devils&quot;. In September 2018, FilmStruck began streaming the same U.S. cut and it was subsequently added to the Criterion Channel in October 2019, almost a year after FilmStruck shut down. The film was then removed from Criterion&#x27;s offerings shortly afterwards, but re-uploaded in January 2024.

==Legacy==
&quot;The Devils&quot; has been cited as one of the most controversial films of all time
by such critics as Richard Crouse, among others. Filmsite included it in their list of the 100 most controversial films ever made, and in 2015, &quot;Time Out&quot; magazine ranked it 47 on their list of the &quot;50 Most Controversial Movies in History&quot;.

Following his transition into experimental filmmaking, Jarman produced the Super 8 short film &quot;The Devils at the Elgin&quot; (1974). Described by Sam Ashby as a &quot;hypnotic, nightmarish monochrome that loops some of the more religious iconographic moments&quot; from Russell&#x27;s original, the film was captured from a screening of &quot;The Devils&quot; at the Elgin Theater in New York City. Jarman noted that Maddeline&#x27;s escape from Loudun in the original film&#x27;s ending gave the impression that &quot;she walks into a blizzard of ashes&quot; when rendered on Super 8 stock. When screening &quot;The Devils at the Elgin&quot; at festivals or his studio, Jarman would synchronize the film to a cassette tape recording of Nico&#x27;s cover version of the Doors&#x27; song &quot;The End&quot;.

Film historian Joel W. Finler described &quot;The Devils&quot; as Russell&#x27;s &quot;most brilliant cinematic achievement, but widely regarded as his most distasteful and offensive work.&quot; In 2002, when 100 filmmakers and critics were asked by &quot;Sight and Sound&quot; to cite what they considered to be the ten most important films ever made, &quot;The Devils&quot; featured in the lists submitted by Kermode and Cox; for the magazine&#x27;s 2012 poll, the film appeared in the lists submitted by Kermode and Lucas, as well as those submitted by filmmaker Abel Ferrara and fellow critics Vic Pratt, Billy Chainsaw and David Sorfa. In 2014, Mexican filmmaker Guillermo del Toro publicly criticised Warner Bros. for censoring the film and limiting its availability in home video markets.

<text>Beer is a crater lying situated within the Margaritifer Sinus quadrangle (MC-19) region of the planet Mars, named in honor of the German astronomer, Wilhelm Beer. It is located at 14.4°S 351.8°E .

Beer and collaborator Johann Heinrich Mädler produced the first reasonably good maps of Mars in the early 1830s. When doing so, they selected a particular feature for the prime meridian of their charts. Their choice was strengthened when Giovanni Schiaparelli used the same location in 1877 for his more famous maps of Mars. The feature was later called Sinus Meridiani (&quot;Middle Bay&quot;), but following the landing of the NASA probe MER-B Opportunity in 2004 it is perhaps better known as Meridiani Planum. Currently the Martian prime meridian is the crater Airy-0.

Beer lies in the southwest of Meridiani Planum, about 8° from the prime meridian and about 10° west from the crater Mädler. Schiaparelli is also in the region.

<text>Mädler is a crater on Mars. It was named in honor of the German astronomer Johann Heinrich Mädler by the IAU in 1973.

Mädler and collaborator Wilhelm Beer produced the first reasonably good maps of Mars in the early 1830s. When doing so, they selected a particular feature for the prime meridian of their charts. Their choice was strengthened when Giovanni Schiaparelli used the same location in 1877 for his more famous maps of Mars. The feature was later called Sinus Meridiani (&quot;Middle Bay&quot; or &quot;Bay of the Meridian&quot;), but following the landing of the NASA probe MER-B &quot;Opportunity&quot; in 2004 is perhaps better known as Meridiani Planum.

Mädler lies in the south of Meridiani Planum, close to the prime meridian and about 10° east of Beer. Schiaparelli is also in the region.

A valley-lake system called Markikh Vallis that once held water flowed into Mädler crater from the south, and formed a lake within Mädler and the adjacent, smaller crater to the southeast. The water flowed out of Mädler to the west and eventually to the northern plains.

<text>The American Bar Association (ABA) is a voluntary bar association of lawyers and law students in the United States; national in scope, it is not specific to any single jurisdiction. Founded in 1878, the ABA&#x27;s stated activities are the setting of academic standards for law schools, and the formulation of model ethical codes related to the legal profession. As of fiscal year 2017, the ABA had 194,000 dues-paying members, constituting approximately 24.4% of American attorneys. In 1979, half of all lawyers in the U.S. were members of the ABA. In 2016, about one third of the 1.3 million practicing lawyers in the U.S. were included in the ABA membership of 400,000, with figures largely unchanged in 2024.

The organization&#x27;s national headquarters are in Chicago, Illinois, with a branch office in Washington, D.C.. The association is affiliated with the law, legal, and professional research sponsoring organization the American Bar Foundation.

==History==

The ABA was founded on August 21, 1878, in Saratoga Springs, New York, by 75 lawyers from 20 states and the District of Columbia. According to the ABA website:

The purpose of the original organization, as set forth in its first constitution, was &quot;the advancement of the science of jurisprudence, the promotion of the administration of justice and a uniformity of legislation throughout the country...&quot;

In 1918, the first women were admitted to the ABA – Judge Mary Belle Grossman of Cleveland and Mary Florence Lathrop of Denver.

Prior to 1943, the ABA did not admit any African-American members and its discrimination led to the formation in 1937 of the National Lawyers Guild. The ABA denied admittance to Francis E. Rivers in 1943 and several prominent members threatened to quit as a result and the organization was finally integrated.

The ABA appointed Jill Wine-Banks as its first woman executive director, who served from 1987 to 1990. Roberta Cooper Ramo was the first female president of the ABA from 1995 to 1996.

In 2016 ABA introduced a new ethics rule prohibiting attorneys from using sexist, racist and condescending terms. The rule also prohibits attorneys from engaging in discrimination based on age in the conduct of bar association activities.

On May 1, 2019, the ABA launched a new membership model aimed at reversing declining membership and revenue. As mentioned in &quot;Criticisms&quot;, below, and despite ABA&#x27;s own rule against age-discriminatory conduct, the &quot;experience-based&quot; component of the ABA dues structure is a proxy for age discrimination, imposing significantly higher dues on lawyers as their years in practice increase.

==Leadership and governance==
The ABA adopts &quot;policy&quot; (organizational positions) on certain legislative and national issues, as voted on by its elected, 589-member House of Delegates. Its board of governors, with 44 members, has the authority to act for the ABA, consistent with previous action of the House of Delegates, when the House is not in session.

The ABA president, elected to a one-year term, is chief executive officer of the association, while the appointed, longer-serving executive director works as chief operating officer. The conclusion of the ABA annual meeting, in August, is when a new president takes office, as well as when the main sessions of the House of Delegates take place. The annual meeting also gives the general membership the opportunity to participate in educational programs and hear speakers address many issues.

In 2010, Jack L. Rives, formerly TJAG (The Judge Advocate General of the Air Force), was appointed executive director and chief operating officer (COO). Alpha M. Brady was named ABA Executive Director/COO after Rives&#x27; retirement in March 2023. She joined the ABA staff in 1988 and rose through the ranks at the association before being named deputy executive director in 2022.

== Model ethical standards for lawyers ==

One function of the ABA is its creation and maintenance of a code of ethical standards for lawyers. Its first ethics code was created in 1908, and the code has undergone substantial revisions since. This code, called the Model Rules of Professional Conduct (1983), — or, in its older form, the Model Code of Professional Responsibility (1969) — has been adopted in 49 states, along with the District of Columbia and four territories (Northern Mariana Islands, Guam, and the United States Virgin Islands). The one state that has not adopted the ABA&#x27;s code is California, and Puerto Rico is the sole territory that has not adopted the ABA&#x27;s code. However, parts of the State Bar of California&#x27;s California Rules of Professional Conduct were drawn from the ABA models.

== Accreditation of U.S. law schools since 1923 ==
The United States Department of Education recognises the Council of the ABA Section on Legal Education and Admissions to the Bar as a professional accrediting agency for law schools in the U.S. American law schools that are accredited by the council are termed &quot;approved&quot; by the ABA, which indicates the law school was found to be in compliance with ABA accreditation standards.

ABA accreditation is important not only because it affects the recognition of the law schools involved, but it also affects a graduate&#x27;s ability to practice law in a particular state. Specifically, in most U.S. jurisdictions, graduation from an ABA-accredited law school is prerequisite towards being allowed to sit for that state&#x27;s bar exam, and even for existing lawyers to be admitted to the bar of another state upon motion. Even states which recognize unaccredited schools within their borders will generally not recognize such schools from other jurisdictions for purposes of bar admission.

For law students attending ABA-accredited schools, memberships are available for free. Students attending non-ABA accredited law schools are permitted to join the ABA as associate members.

In November 2022, the ABA Legal Education and Admissions to the Bar Council voted to eliminate its accreditation requirement that law schools in the United States require prospective students submit results on the LSAT or an alternative valid and reliable standardized admissions test (while continuing to permit law schools to require them of their own accord). The ABA’s House of Delegates rejected that proposal in 2023 over concerns it would make admissions offices more dependent on subjective measures such as the prestige of an applicant’s college, potentially putting minority applicants at a disadvantage.

In 2024, the council created a new variance process by which individual law schools may apply for permission to bypass the existing admission test requirement. This new process does not require approval from the House of Delegates as it is not part of accreditation standards.

=== Accreditation process criticisms ===
The ABA accreditation process has been widely criticized for failing to ensure that law schools are disclosing accurate post-graduate statistics which may mislead students regarding the post-graduate job market, especially in light of ever-growing student loan debt. There are heated debates over requirements placed on law schools by the ABA. Many states and practitioners believe ABA requirements to be unnecessary, costly, outdated and lacking innovation. Some legal professionals and academics feel these requirements promote the rising cost of tuition. The collision of attorney layoffs in 2009, the glut of fresh non-top-tier law graduates without work, and the continued expansion of law schools raised questions on whether the ABA has been too lenient in its accreditation process.

A non-profit organization, Law School Transparency, called upon the ABA to provide meaningful statistics regarding the employment prospects and salary information of graduates of ABA accredited institutions. In 2011 and 2012, the ABA updated its accreditation process to include penalties and possible loss of accreditation for schools that misrepresented their graduates&#x27; employment data, as well as, greatly expanded the information required from accredited laws schools regarding student bar-passage rates and post-graduate employment. Despite the ongoing controversy surrounding law school accreditation standards and inability of law school graduates to effectively service their educational debt, the ABA continued to approve new law schools.

Since 2014, the ABA has required law schools to disclose more information about their applicants and graduates. Required information now includes such information as admissions data, tuition and fees, living costs, conditional scholarships, enrollment data, numbers of full-time and part-time faculty, class sizes for first-year and upper-class courses, employment outcomes and bar passage data. The 205 ABA-approved law schools reported that, 10 months after graduation, 28,029 graduates of the class of 2015, or 70 percent, were employed in long-term, full-time positions where bar passage is required or a J.D. is preferred.

In May 2019, the ABA Council of the Section of Legal Education and Admissions to the Bar changed the requirement for graduate bar passage rates. Previously, to remain accredited, schools had to have a 75% bar passage rate for students within 5 years of graduation, with various ways to meet this standard and no law schools having ever been found in violation of the rule. The new rule requires the 75% bar passage rate be achieved within 2 years with no exceptions.  The change was passed by the Section despite failing a vote in the ABA House of Delegates twice. Proponents of the change say the increased standard will ensure students are better prepared for passing the bar and for legal practice in general with less students acquiring large student debt without reasonable job opportunities. Opponents claim this will adversely affect diversity in law schools, which will be forced to increase their admissions standards and required LSAT scores, which in turn will disproportionately affect minority applicants. Under the new plan, 14 schools will be at risk of losing their accreditation if their bar-passage rates do not improve within two years. At the time of the rule change, three law schools were currently in the process of closing, and another school was under probation. In June 2019, the ABA voted to revoke the accreditation of Thomas Jefferson School of Law in San Diego, California.

===Antitrust consent decree and contempt fine===
In 1995 the United States Department of Justice accused the ABA of violating Section 1 of the Sherman Act in its law school accreditation proceedings. The case was resolved with a consent decree. In 2006, the ABA acknowledged that it violated the consent decree and paid DOJ a $185,000 fine.

==Continuing legal education==
The American Bar Association Center for Continuing Legal Education (ABA-CLE) serves as the central CLE resource for the ABA. It is overseen by the ABA Standing Committee on Continuing Legal Education and works closely with experts from the ABA Sections and the profession at large. In addition to its own distribution, the ABA-CLE is also delivered via private, non-profit CLE organizations, such as Practising Law Institute and for-profit organizations, such as West LegalEdCenter.

== Publications ==
The ABA Publishing division of the Association publishes a variety of law education and practice resources and monthly magazine, as well as memoirs and works of legal history and fiction under its Ankerwycke imprint, which launched in 2014.

===&quot;ABA Journal&quot;===

The association publishes a monthly print and digital magazine circulated to all members, the &quot;ABA Journal&quot; (since 1984, formerly &quot;American Bar Association Journal&quot;, 1915–1983).

===Sections, divisions and forums===
ABA members may also join practice setting or subject-specific &quot;sections&quot;, &quot;divisions&quot;, or &quot;forums&quot;, and each entity publishes a variety of newsletters and magazines for its members (such as &quot;Law Practice Magazine&quot; published by the Law Practice Division; GPSolo Magazine published by the Solo, Small Firm and General Practice Division and
&quot;Probate and Property Magazine&quot; published by the Real Property, Trust and Estate Law)
). Some of these magazines, such as the Business Law Section&#x27;s &quot;Business Law Today&quot;, are available on-line to non-members. The first such journal was the &quot;Annual Bulletin&quot; of the Comparative Law Bureau, the first comparative law journal in the U.S. (1908–1914). The entities also hold their own meetings, such as the annual Solo Day.

Each entity typically has a publication program that includes (1) books, usually oriented toward practitioners; (2) scholarly journals, such as &quot;Administrative Law Review&quot; (published by the ABA Section of Administrative Law &amp; Regulatory Practice and The American University Washington College of Law) and &quot;The International Lawyer&quot; (published by the ABA Section of International Law and SMU Dedman School of Law); (3) newsletters, such as The International Law News (published by the ABA Section of International Law); (4) e-publications, such as a monthly message from the section chair, or updates on substantive law developments; and (5) committee publications, such as a committee newsletter published by one of the substantive law committees.
==Center for Human Rights==

The Center for Human Rights (CHR) was established in 2001.

The CHR established the annual Eleanor Roosevelt Prize for Global Human Rights Advancement in 2018. Several nominees are awarded the prize each year.

== Commissions ==
The ABA&#x27;s Commission on Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity was established in 2007.

The ABA&#x27;s Criminal Justice Section, specifically the Corrections Committee, focuses on the United States Criminal Justice System and its surrounding laws, policies, and structure. The Corrections Committee &quot;is pushing to provide greater assistance ... for those reentering society&quot; from prison by pushing law schools and state bar associations to provide opportunities for law students to represent prisoners reentering society.

In 2017, the ABA&#x27;s Commission on Women in the Profession released &quot;A Current Glance at Women in the Law&quot;, providing research about the status of women in the American legal profession. The report showed a 6 percent increase in women attorneys over the last decade, with women currently making up 36 percent of the legal profession. Law schools award 47.3 percent of J.D.s to women, which has been consistent for the past 10 years. In private practice law firms, women make up less than 22 percent of partners, a 4.2 percent increase over the last 10 years. In the last decade, there has been a significant growth rate of women in the role of general counsel in Fortune 500 companies, but still women only represent 24.8 percent of Fortune 500 general counsels. Since 2003, the Commission on Women in the Profession also supported quantitative and qualitative research (conducted by NORC at the University of Chicago researcher Mandy Sha) on the experiences of Hispanic, African-American, Native American, and Asian American women in the legal profession and produced a toolkit in 2014 to assist bar associations, law firms, and corporations.

==Positions on social and legal issues==
===Policies on LGBT people===
In 2011, the ABA&#x27;s House of Delegates passed an anti-bullying resolution that included sexual orientation and gender identity among characteristics that should be protected, along with race, religion, national origin, sex, and disability.

At the 2013 annual meeting, the ABA&#x27;s House of Delegates passed a resolution that made it harder for criminal defense lawyers to use the LGBT panic defense, which argues that a crime victim&#x27;s sexual orientation or gender identity should mitigate the defendant&#x27;s guilt. At the 2014 annual meeting, the ABA passed Resolution 114B, which stated that &quot;lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people have a human right to be free from discrimination, threats, and violence based on their LGBT status&quot;, and called on the governments of countries where such discriminatory laws exist to repeal them.

===Mandatory sentencing requirements===

A hearing in 2009 heard testimony from the ABA that &quot;Sentencing by mandatory minimums is the antithesis of rational sentencing policy&quot;. In 2004 the association called for the repeal of mandatory minimum sentences, stating that &quot;there is no need for mandatory minimum sentences in a guided sentencing system.&quot;

===Presidential signing statements===
In July 2006, an ABA task force under ABA president, then Michael S. Greco, released a report that concluded that George W. Bush&#x27;s use of &quot;signing statements&quot; violates the Constitution. These are documents attached by the president when signing bills, in which the president expresses an opinion that newly created legal restrictions on the executive branch or president are not binding and need not be enforced or obeyed as written.

===Same sex marriage===
At the 2010 annual meeting, the ABA passed Resolution 111 urging every state, territorial, and tribal government to eliminate legal barriers to civil marriage between two persons of the same sex who are otherwise eligible to marry.

==Rating of judicial nominees==
For decades, the ABA has participated in the federal judicial nomination process by vetting nominees and giving them a rating ranging from &quot;not qualified&quot; to &quot;well qualified&quot;. According to a compendium of those ratings, the ABA&#x27;s Committee on the Federal Judiciary began rating Supreme Court nominees in 1956, but: &quot;At various points in its history, the committee altered its ratings categories, making comparisons across time difficult.&quot;

The committee consists of two members from the ninth judicial circuit, one member from each of the other federal judicial circuits and the chair of the committee. The ABA&#x27;s board of governors, House of Delegates and officers are not involved with the work of the committee, and it is completely insulated from the rest of the ABA&#x27;s activities, including its policies. Although the committee rates prospective nominees, it does not propose, recommend or endorse candidates for nomination to the federal judiciary, as that would compromise its independent evaluative function.

The committee works in strictly-enforced confidentiality, typically evaluating around 60 nominees per year. Nominees are rated as &quot;well qualified&quot;, &quot;qualified&quot; or &quot;not qualified&quot;. If the president selects a prospective nominee, the committee chair notifies the White House, the Department of Justice, the members of the Senate Judiciary Committee and the nominee of the committee&#x27;s rating.

There are several procedural differences between the committee&#x27;s investigations of Supreme Court nominees and those of lower courts, notably that investigations of Supreme Court nominees are conducted after the president has submitted a nomination. Also, there is added scrutiny with Supreme Court nominees, such as teams of law professors examining the legal writings of the prospective justice.

The process has been alleged by some (including the Federalist Society) to have a liberal bias. For example, the ABA gave Ronald Reagan&#x27;s judicial nominees Richard Posner and Frank H. Easterbrook low &quot;qualified/not qualified&quot; ratings; later, the ABA gave Bill Clinton judicial nominees with similar resumes &quot;well qualified&quot; ratings.

In 2001, the George W. Bush administration announced that it would cease submitting names to the ABA in advance of judicial nominations. The ABA continued to rate nominees, just not before the names were released publicly. During the Obama administration, the ABA was once again given advance notice of judicial nominees for rating. President Trump returned to George W. Bush&#x27;s policy of not giving the ABA advanced notice of judicial nominees. Seven of George W. Bush&#x27;s nominees received a &#x27;not qualified&#x27; ranking, four of Clinton&#x27;s nominees, zero of Obama&#x27;s nominees, and, through December 2018, six of Trump&#x27;s nominees were rated &#x27;not qualified&#x27;. For recent U.S. Supreme Court nominees, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., Justice Samuel Alito, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Justice Elena Kagan, Justice Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh, Amy Coney Barrett, and Ketanji Brown Jackson all received the same &quot;well qualified&quot; rating.

In 2001 a study &quot;found that nominees confirmed to the federal appeals courts with prior judicial experience fared about the same before the bar association whether they were nominated by the first President George Bush or President Bill Clinton. But ... &#x27;among those without prior judicial experience, the differences were stark: 65 percent of Clinton nominees received the A.B.A.&#x27;s highest rating compared to 17 percent of Bush nominees.&#x27;&quot; In 2012, a study was released in &quot;Political Research Quarterly&quot; showing that from 1977 to 2008 there was a distinct bias in favor of judicial candidates nominated by a Democratic president, with all other factors being equal. Candidates nominated by a Democratic president were 15 percent more likely to receive a &quot;well qualified&quot; ranking than a similarly qualified candidate nominated by a Republican president. Supporters of the rating system argue that nominees rated &#x27;not qualified&#x27; will not perform as well as judges, however, a 2010 study found &quot;a review of tens of thousands of dispositions does not provide generally persuasive evidence that judges rated by the ABA as &quot;Well Qualified&quot; perform better.&quot;

=== Nominee ratings during the Trump administration ===
The ABA judicial nominee rating process drew additional attention during the Trump administration. Through June 2019, six of President Trump&#x27;s nominees were rated &quot;not qualified.&quot; Three of those were ranked unanimously not qualified, which had only occurred twice previously since the George H. W. Bush administration. These ratings added further fuel to conservatives&#x27; arguments of bias in the nominee rating process. Republicans argued that members of the Committee on the Federal Judiciary have allowed their personal liberal political leanings to influence their ratings under the category of judicial temperament.

Members of the committee were accused of asking inappropriate questions of a nominee regarding abortion and negatively referring to Republicans as &quot;you people.&quot; Senator Ted Cruz stated that the ABA is a liberal advocacy group and, as such, &quot;should not be treated as a fair or impartial arbiter of merit.&quot; Senator Ben Sasse also criticized the organization for taking liberal stances on issues then proclaiming to be neutral when evaluating judicial nominees. The ABA said &quot;evaluation of these candidates does not consider the nominees&#x27; politics, their ideology or their party affiliation and has found unqualified candidates put forth by both political parties.&quot;

==Criticisms==
Throughout its history, the ABA has faced a range of criticism for different issues, including for their past stances regarding race, their diversity (or lack thereof), and for their policy positions. 

=== Racism and diversity ===
The ABA has been criticized for racism. In 1911, William H. Lewis, who was the Assistant Attorney General of the United States at that time, was initially admitted to the ABA, but his admission was rescinded in 1912 due to his race. This policy only changed in 1943, but no African American lawyers joined until 1950. In 1925, African-American lawyers formed the National Bar Association at a time when the ABA would not allow them to be members. In 2024, the National Bar Association has about 67,000 members and 84 chapters.

=== Policy positions ===
In recent years, the ABA has also drawn some criticism, mainly from the conservative side of the political spectrum, for taking positions on controversial public policy topics such as abortion, gun control, and same-sex marriage. The ABA&#x27;s official position in favor of abortion rights led to the formation of an alternative organization for lawyers in 1993, the National Lawyers for Life, now the National Lawyers Association. The Federalist Society previously sponsored a twice-a-year publication called &quot;ABA Watch&quot; that reports on the political activities of the ABA.

Writing for &quot;Forbes&quot;, Mark A. Cohen criticized the ABA for failing to keep the practice of law in America up with the changing demands of modern society. Cohen also criticized the ABA for opposing regulatory reform that would help increase access to affordable legal services for those in need and for engaging in protectionism when some legal services could be performed by paralegals and other non-lawyer professionals at a lower cost. Eighty percent of Americans cannot afford legal services and the ABA has failed to embrace alternative legal delivery methods that could address this problem.

The ABA also failed to address rules that prohibit some online legal referral websites when it updated the Model Rules regarding Communication Concerning a Lawyer&#x27;s Services.

<text>The Red Vineyards near Arles is an oil painting by the Dutch painter Vincent van Gogh, executed on a privately primed Toile de 30 piece of burlap in early November 1888. It depicts workers in a vineyard, and it is the only painting known by name that Van Gogh sold in his lifetime.

==History==
&quot;The Red Vineyard&quot; was exhibited for the first time at the annual exhibition of Les XX, 1890, in Brussels, and sold for 400 francs to Belgian painter and collector Anna Boch, a member of Les XX. Anna was the sister of Eugène Boch, another impressionist painter and a friend of Van Gogh, whose portrait Van Gogh painted (&quot;Le Peintre aux Étoiles&quot;) in Arles in autumn 1888. In a later letter to his brother Theo discussing the sale, Van Gogh admitted with some embarrassment that the Bochs paid the Les XX 1890 Exhibition sticker price, when in fact they probably should have gotten a &quot;friend&#x27;s price&quot;.

The painting was later purchased, in 1909, from a Paris art gallery by Ivan Morozov. After the Russian Revolution, the painting was subsequently nationalised by the Bolsheviks and was eventually passed to Moscow&#x27;s Pushkin State Museum of Fine Arts, where it resides today.

<text>Aéroplanes Morane-Saulnier was a French aircraft manufacturing company formed in October 1911 by Raymond Saulnier and the Morane brothers, Léon and Robert. The company was taken over and diversified in the 1960s.

==History==
===Model development===
Morane-Saulnier&#x27;s first product was the Morane-Borel monoplane, a development of a monoplane design produced by the Morane company (sometimes called Type A) in partnership with Gabriel Borel). Using a wing-warping mechanism for control, this was the type in which Jules Védrines won the Paris-Madrid race on 26 May 1911.


Morane-Saulnier&#x27;s first commercially successful design was the Morane-Saulnier G, a wire-braced shoulder-wing monoplane with wing warping. This led to the development of a series of aircraft and was very successful in racing and setting records. The Type G was a 2-seater, and was reduced slightly in size to produce the Morane-Saulnier H, a single-seater, and was given a faired fuselage to produce the Morane-Saulnier N single-seat fighter. The Morane-Saulnier H was modified so that its wings were mounted parasol fashion, above the fuselage to afford the observer a better view, creating the Morane-Saulnier L. The L was then fitted with a faired fuselage as on the N and ailerons to make the Morane-Saulnier LA, which was then completely redesigned (though looking very similar) to make the Morane-Saulnier P which would be the basis for a whole family of aircraft developed in the 1920s. The Type N was developed into the larger and more powerful Morane-Saulnier I and the very similar Morane-Saulnier V, but these were not successful, being too powerful and having inadequate controls. The V was then redesigned to create the Morane-Saulnier AC which substituted ailerons for wing warping and had a strut-braced wing. The AC was not particularly successful, in part because of poor field of view a shoulder-mounted wing produced, so the Morane-Saulnier AI was developed, in which the wing was raised above the fuselage. The AI lost out in the competition to the SPAD XIII but was built in limited numbers in case there was a problem with the SPAD; as it turned out it was the AI that suffered structural problems.

In parallel to the L the Morane-Saulnier BB was developed for the RFC, which was a Type P built as a biplane. Because the type &#x27;BB&#x27; when pronounced in French sounds like Bebe (or baby), this became the type&#x27;s nickname. Most of these types had no fixed fin, or horizontal stabilizer, with the result that they were not only very sensitive on the controls, but also could not even be flown hands off. One early pilot noted that if one left the aircraft to its own devices it would end up going upside down in the opposite direction. Despite this, many were used as trainers, including a great many that had their wings stripped so they couldn&#x27;t fly, creating what was known as a Penguin.

The Type L has the distinction of being the first fighter aircraft used during World War I when one was fitted with a machine gun firing through the propeller, which was fitted with metal plates to deflect any bullets that struck it. This was flown with success by Roland Garros, who would later be considered to be the first French Ace. A similar system was fitted to the Type N pending the arrival of other machine guns, which made the system workable. While flying his modified Type L, Garros crashed on the German side of the lines and the wreckage was examined by Fokker just prior to Fokker producing a similar system.

After the war, Morane-Saulnier produced a number of designs for training and general aviation, but with the threat of war in the late thirties it once again turned to military aircraft. During the late 1920s and early 1930s, it produced a number of parasol wing fighters including the M.S.230 and M.S.315, but all were of limited performance and were relegated to training duties. Morane-Saulnier had much more success with its dramatically modernized M.S.406, which was the French Air Force&#x27;s most numerous fighter at the start of the war. The 406 was advanced only at the time of its introduction in 1935, and suffered terribly against the more modern Messerschmitt Bf 109s it faced in 1940.

During World War II, Morane-Saulnier was operated under German control and built a number of German types including the Fieseler Storch, known after the war as the Morane-Saulnier MS.500 Criquet. Morane-Saulnier also produced a number of trainer and civilian aircraft models, the best known of which was the successful &quot;Rallye&quot; series of four-seat STOL semi-aerobatic tourers (see picture above).

Morane-Saulnier was purchased by Potez on 7 January 1962, and became SEEMS, the &quot;Societe d&#x27;Exploitation des Etablissements Morane-Saulnier&quot;. In 1966 its civilian models were spun off to form SOCATA, the &quot;Societe de Construction d&#x27;Avions de Tourisme et d&#x27;Affaires&quot;, which was eventually purchased by Aérospatiale.

===Development of gun synchronisation===
The company and Saulnier himself had a significant role in the development of the concept of synchronising machine gun fire through an aircraft&#x27;s propeller.

<doc id="459631" wikidata="Q4379908" url="?curid=459631" title="Purchase of commissions in the British Army">
<text>Between the 17th and 19th centuries, officer&#x27;s commissions in infantry and cavalry units of the English and British armies could be purchased. This avoided the need to wait to be promoted for merit or seniority, and was the usual way to obtain a rank in both armies. The practice began in 1683 during the reign of Charles II of England, and continued to exist until it was abolished on 1 November 1871 as part of the Cardwell Reforms. Formally, the purchase price of a commission was a cash bond for good behaviour, liable to be forfeited if the officer in question was found guilty of cowardice, desertion, or gross misconduct.

==Great Britain and Ireland==
Only commissions in cavalry and infantry regiments could be purchased and therefore only those up to the rank of colonel. Commissions in the Royal Engineers and the Royal Artillery were awarded to those who graduated from a course at the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich and subsequent promotion was by seniority. Also, the Royal Navy never practised the sale of commissions, with advancement in officer ranks being solely by merit or seniority, at least in theory (in practice, the requirement for new officers to purchase expensive uniforms and study materials restricted naval commissions to sons of the middle and upper classes).

===Values===
The official values of commissions varied by branch (see below). Payments in excess of regulation (non-official) usually accorded with the differing social prestige of different regiments.

For example, in 1837 the costs of commissions were:
These prices were incremental. To purchase a promotion, an officer only had to pay the difference in price between his existing rank and the desired rank.

===Regimental and social factors===
Theoretically, a commission could be sold only for its official value and was to be offered first to the next most senior officer in the same regiment. In practice, there was also an unofficial &quot;over-regulation price&quot; or &quot;regimental value&quot;, which might double the official cost. Desirable commissions in fashionable regiments were often sold to the highest bidder after an auction. A self-interested senior officer might well regard his commission as his pension fund and would encourage the increase of its value. An officer who incurred or inherited debts might sell his commission to raise funds.

Social exclusiveness was preserved not only by money, as regimental colonels were permitted to – and often did – refuse the purchase of a commission in their regiment by a man who had the necessary money but was not from a social background to their liking. This was especially the case in the Household and Guards regiments, which were dominated by the nobility. Elsewhere, however, it was not unknown for Colonels to lend deserving senior non-commissioned officers or warrant officers the funds necessary to purchase commissions.

Not all first commissions or promotions were paid for. If an officer was killed in action or appointed to the Staff (usually through being promoted to Major General), this created a series of &quot;non-purchase vacancies&quot; within his regiment. These could also occur when new regiments or battalions were created, or when the establishments of existing units were expanded. However, all vacancies resulting from officers dying of disease, retiring (whether on full or half pay) or resigning their commissions were &quot;purchase vacancies&quot;. A period, usually of several years, had to elapse before an officer who succeeded to a non-purchase vacancy could sell his commission. For instance, if a Captain were promoted to Major to fill a non-purchase vacancy but decided to quit the Army immediately afterwards, he would receive only the value of his Captain&#x27;s commission.

===Active service===
Various regulations required minimum durations of service in a given rank and restricted officers from selling or exchanging their commissions to avoid active service. Exceptions and exemptions from these were at the discretion of the Commander in Chief. In 1806 there was a major scandal when it was discovered that Mary Anne Clarke, the mistress of then Commander in Chief Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany, was engaged in selling commissions for her personal profit.

The worst potential effects of the system were mitigated during intensive conflicts such as the Napoleonic Wars by heavy casualties among senior ranks, which resulted in many non-purchase vacancies, and also discouraged wealthy who were not keen on active service, thereby ensuring that many commissions were exchanged for their nominal value only. There was also the possibility of promotion to brevet army ranks for deserving officers. An officer might be a subaltern or Captain in his regiment, but might hold a higher local rank if attached to other units or allied armies, or might be given a higher Army rank by the Commander-in-Chief or the Monarch in recognition of meritorious service or a notable feat of bravery. Officers bearing dispatches giving news of a victory (such as Waterloo), often received such promotion, and might be specially selected by a General in the field for this purpose.

===Abolition of the practice===
The malpractices associated with the purchase of commissions reached their height in the long peace between the Napoleonic Wars and the Crimean War, when James Brudenell, Lord Cardigan paid £35,000 () for the lieutenant-colonelcy of the stylish 11th Hussars. It became obvious in the Crimea that the system of purchase often resulted in incompetence, such as that which resulted in the Charge of the Light Brigade, led by Cardigan. An inquiry (the Commission on Purchase) was established in 1855, and commented unfavourably on the institution. The practice of purchase of commissions was finally abolished as part of the 1871 Cardwell reforms which made many changes to the structure and procedures of the Army.

==Other armies==

During the eighteenth century the purchase of commissions was a common practice in many European armies, although not usually to the same extent as in Britain. In Spain, after having enlisted as a midshipman in the Spanish Navy in 1733, Pedro Caro Fontes, the future 2nd Marquis of La Romana, purchased his commission as a lieutenant colonel of a dragoon regiment the following year.

The practice had been discontinued for the French infantry in 1758, although retained in the socially more exclusive cavalry until the French Revolution. The Austrian government had attempted to place restrictions on the practice, although it continued informally. Only in the Prussian Army was it unknown. In Russia, Peter the Great mandated that all officers must start as privates, so the common method was to register an infant scion of a noble family as a private; reporting for service at the age of 15, the boy would already be promoted on seniority to a junior lieutenant or equivalent rank. This practice became gradually obsolete during the early 19th century and was formally abolished by the Russian military reforms of 1864.

<text>Rybinsk (, ) is the second-largest city of Yaroslavl Oblast in Russia. It lies at the confluence of the Volga and Sheksna rivers, north-north-east of Moscow. Population: 

It was previously known as &quot;Ust-Sheksna&quot; (until 1504), &quot;Rybnaya Sloboda&quot; (until 1777), &quot;Shcherbakov&quot; (1946–1957), and &quot;Andropov&quot; (1984–1989).

==History==
===Early history===

Rybinsk is one of the oldest Slavic settlements on the Volga River. The place was first recorded by chroniclers in 1071 as Ust-Sheksna, i.e. &quot;the mouth of the Sheksna&quot;. During this period the settlement was a regional center for craft and metal based produce and for trade. In the mid-13th century, Ust-Sheksna was laid waste by invading Mongols. For the next few centuries, the settlement was referred to alternatively as Ust-Sheksna or Rybansk. From 1504, it was identified in documents as Rybnaya Sloboda (literally: &quot;the fishing village&quot;). The name is explained by the fact that the settlement supplied the Muscovite court with choice sturgeons and sterlets. In the 17th century, when the &quot;sloboda&quot; was capitalizing on the trade of the Muscovy Company with Western Europe, it was rich enough to build several stone churches, of which only one survives to the present. More old architecture may be found in the neighborhood, including the last of Muscovite three-tented churches (in the Alexandrov Hermitage) and the Ushakov family shrine (on Epiphany Island).

===Golden age===
In the 18th century, the &quot;sloboda&quot; continued to thrive on the Volga trade. Catherine the Great granted Rybnaya Sloboda municipal rights and renamed it Rybinsk. It was a place where the cargo was reloaded from large Volga vessels to smaller boats capable of navigating in the shallow Mariinsk Canal system, which connects the Russian hinterland with the Baltic Sea. With the population of 7,000, the town daily accommodated up to 170,000 sailors and up to 2,000 river vessels. Consequently, the local river port became known as the &quot;capital of barge-haulers&quot;.
The town&#x27;s most conspicuous landmark, the Neoclassical Savior-Transfiguration Cathedral, was constructed on the Volga riverside from 1838 until 1851. It was built to a design that the Dean of the Imperial Academy of Arts, Avraam Melnikov, had prepared for Saint Isaac&#x27;s Cathedral in St. Petersburg. After Melnikov lost the contest for the best project of St. Isaac&#x27;s Cathedral to Auguste de Montferrand, he sold his grandiose design to the municipal authorities of Rybinsk.
As a trade capital of the Upper Volga, Rybinsk formerly attracted scores of foreigners, who built a Lutheran church and an imposing Roman Catholic cathedral, said to be the tallest on the Volga. There is also the Nobel Family Museum, documenting the operations of that prominent Swedish family during the Russian Empire.

20th-century American film moguls Nicholas Schenck and Joseph Schenck were born in the town, and there is a grand 18th-century mansion of the Mikhalkov family, whose living members include Sergey Mikhalkov, Nikita Mikhalkov, and Andron Konchalovsky.

===20th century===
In the Soviet years, Rybinsk continued its impressive renaming record, for it changed its name four times: to Shcherbakov (after Aleksandr Shcherbakov) in 1946, back to Rybinsk in 1957, to Andropov (after Yuri Andropov) in 1984, and back to Rybinsk in 1989.

==Administrative and municipal status==
Within the framework of administrative divisions, Rybinsk serves as the administrative center of Rybinsky District, even though it is not a part of it. As an administrative division, it is incorporated separately as the city of oblast significance of Rybinsk—an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the districts. As a municipal division, the city of oblast significance of Rybinsk is incorporated as Rybinsk Urban Okrug.

==Economy==
The most important industries of modern Rybinsk are NPO Saturn (two plants) AL Turborus aircraft engines, power and naval gas turbines manufacturing, RGT small plant 30 - 100 MW range gas turbines, electronics radiotronics (NPO Luch), Kalashnikov Pella Rybinsk shipyard Euroyachting, Vympel Shipyard, and a hydroelectric power station. As the experts warn, the giant Rybinsk dam which holds the Rybinsk Reservoir (formerly touted as the largest man-made body of water on Earth) places the town in the imminent danger of the dam breaking and the reservoir flooding the city. The city is served by the Staroselye Airport.

==Geography==
===Climate===
Rybinsk has a four-season humid continental climate with significant differences between winters and summers, although the cold winters are still significantly less severe than those found on similar parallels further east in Russia. Spring comes in the second half of March and lasts about 2 months. The weather in spring is usually dry and partly cloudy and the temperature rises quickly. Summer begins in the second half of May, but short-term returns of cold weather are possible. Summer is moderately warm and humid, lasting about three and a half months. The warmest month is July, when the weather is often hot with daytime temperatures up to +30 degrees. Autumn begins in early September, but the temperature decreases slowly, so the weather is relatively warm and sunny until the middle of the month. Later the weather becomes cloudy and it rains often. November can be either the last month of autumn, with cloudy weather and frequent rains, or the first month of winter, with frosts and stable snow cover. The yearly mean is around .
==Paleontology==
Near Rybinsk, fossils of Early Triassic temnospondyls were discovered. Remains of &quot;Thoosuchus&quot; and &quot;Benthosuchus&quot; have been found in the Lower Olenekian deposits.

==International relations==
Rybinsk is twinned with:

* Kingsport, Tennessee, United States (1989) 
* Johnson City, Tennessee, United States (1989) 
* Bristol, Tennessee, United States (1989)

<text>Earl of Inchcape is a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. It was created in 1929 for the Scottish shipping magnate and public servant James Mackay, 1st Viscount Inchcape. He had been created Baron Inchcape, of Strathnaver in the County of Sutherland, in 1911, and Viscount Inchcape, of Strathnaver in the County of Sutherland, in 1924. He was made Viscount Glenapp, of Strathnaver in the County of Sutherland, at the same time as he was given the earldom. These titles are also in the Peerage of the United Kingdom.

The family seat is Carlock House near Ballantrae, Ayrshire. The former family seat was Glenapp Castle, which is now a luxury hotel. It was sold by the Mackay family in 1982, having been acquired by the 1st Earl of Inchcape in 1917. The present Earl of Inchcape, however, still owns the Glenapp Estate.

<text>Baron Saye and Sele is a title in the Peerage of England held by the Twisleton-Wykeham-Fiennes family. The title dates to 1447 but it was recreated in 1603. Confusion over the details of the 15th-century title has led to conflicting order for titleholders; authorities such as &quot;Burke&#x27;s Peerage&quot; and &quot;Debrett&#x27;s Peerage&quot; do not agree on whether or not the 1447 creation is still extant.

==History==
The Saye (also spelt Say) family is an ancient one. According to the &quot;Roman de Rou&quot;, a &quot;le sire de Saye&quot; took part in the Norman conquest in 1087, after which they gained prominence and land. The name Saye possibly refers to Sai, Normandy. In the 11th century, a William de Say married Agnes, daughter of Hugh de Grandmesnil, but his connection to the later titleholders is not confirmed.

However, the history of the title has been traced to another William de Saye, who was granted lands by Empress Matilda in 1141–42 and, at a later time in The Anarchy, joined his brother-in-law Geoffrey de Mandeville, 1st Earl of Essex, fighting against King Stephen of England. This William was likely killed in the same raid on Burwell Castle that killed Essex.

William&#x27;s eldest son, William II de Saye, had two daughters, one of whom, Beatrice, married Geoffrey Fitz Peter, 1st Earl of Essex (of the second creation). Lands held by the de Maminots — including the Manor of Deptford, known now as Sayes Court — came to the family through Alice, daughter of Hugh II de Maminot, who married William II de Saye&#x27;s second son, Geoffrey II de Saye. The Sayes also adopted the Maminot arms, &quot;quarterly or and gules&quot;. Geoffrey II de Saye filed legal suits against his cousin, the new Earl of Essex, for the lands belonging to the Mandeville family. His son Geoffrey III de Saye, who held the Lordship of West Greenwich inherited from his mother, was one of the 25 feudal barons who stood surety for Magna Carta in 1215. His son William III de Saye traveled with and fought for Henry III and is recorded as a witness for the Treaty of York in 1237. William IV de Saye fought for Edward I in his conquest of Wales (1277–1283).

His grandson Geoffrey III de Saye was created feudal baron Saye by writ in 1313. His son Geoffrey IV de Saye, the second baron, married Lady Maud de Beauchamp, daughter of 10th Earl of Warwick. Their son William, the third baron, was knighted in 1361 and married Beatrice, daughter of Sir Thomas de Brewose (Breouse/Brewes/Braose). William died by 7 August 1375, leaving the title to their young son John, who died a few years later.

The title then passed to John&#x27;s sister Elizabeth, 16. She married Sir John de Falvesle, 1st Lord Falvesley. After his death she married secondly Sir William Heron, who sat in Parliament as Lord Say by right of his wife. She died in 1399 without heirs, after which the barony became abeyant among her three aunts. Idonea was married to John de Clinton, 3rd Lord de Clinton; Joan married Sir William Fiennes (died 1359); and Elizabeth married Sir Thomas de Aldoun.

Of the three, only Joan had male issue. Her second but eldest surviving son Sir William Fiennes (died 1403) was the father of Sir Roger Fiennes, MP for Sussex and Treasurer of the Household. With the spoils of the Hundred Years&#x27; War, Sir Roger built Herstmonceux Castle. His elder son Sir Richard Fiennes was called to Parliament as 7th Lord Dacre in right of his wife, Joan Dacre, 7th Baroness Dacre.

The Barony of Saye and Sele is thought to have been created by letters patent in 1447 for Sir Roger&#x27;s second son, James Fiennes, for his services in the Hundred Years&#x27; War. The patent creating the original barony was lost, so it was assumed that the barony was created by writ, meaning that it could descend to heirs-general, and not only heirs-male.

However, several authorities, including &quot;Burke&#x27;s Peerage&quot;, agree that the assumption was erroneous, and that the original creation was by letters patent, and thus identify the initial holder as Lordship of Saye and Sele.

His son, the second baron, was summoned to Parliament but killed at the Battle of Barnet in 1471. His son, the &quot;de jure&quot; third Baron, was known as Lord Saye and Sele but was never summoned to Parliament. The peerage is therefore considered to have become dormant (unclaimed) on the death of the second Baron. His great-great-great-grandson, Richard Fiennes, the &quot;de jure&quot; seventh baron, claimed the title in 1573. For years, he remained unsuccessful, but in 1603 James I granted him letters patent confirming his right to the title. The patent confirmed that the barony created in 1447 belonged to Richard Fiennes, but on the condition that, for the purposes of precedence or seniority, it would be considered as having been created in 1603, and also provided that no future Baron Saye and Sele would assert the precedence of 1447. The patent, furthermore, allowed the title to pass to heirs-general, based on the erroneous assumption that the barony was created by writ.

William Fiennes, the eighth Baron, was created Viscount Saye and Sele, also in the Peerage of England, in 1624. On the death of his son, the second Viscount, the two titles separated. The barony fell into abeyance between the late Baron&#x27;s daughters Hon. Elizabeth, wife of John Twisleton, and Hon. Frances, wife of Andrew Ellis. The Viscountcy could only be passed on to male heirs and was inherited by the Baron&#x27;s nephew, the third Viscount. He was the son of Nathaniel Fiennes, second son of the first Viscount. When his son, the fourth Viscount, died, this line of the family also failed. He was succeeded by his cousin, the fifth Viscount. He was the son of John Fiennes, third son of the first Viscount. He was in his turn succeeded by another cousin, the sixth Viscount. On his death in 1781, there were no more male heirs left of the first Viscount, and the title became extinct.
By 1715, all of the coheirs to the Barony of Saye and Sele had died save one; Cecil Twisleton, &quot;de jure&quot; tenth Baroness Saye and Sele. She was the daughter of the aforementioned Hon. Elizabeth, daughter of the second Viscount Saye and Sele. However, the barony was only formally called out of abeyance in favour of her great-grandson, Thomas Twisleton, who became the thirteenth Baron Saye and Sele. He was a General in the Army. His son, the fourteenth Baron, assumed the additional surnames of Fiennes and Eardley in 1825. He was succeeded by his son, the fifteenth Baron, who in his turn was succeeded by his cousin, the sixteenth Baron. In 1849 he assumed the additional surnames of Wykeham-Fiennes (the first Viscount Saye and Sele was a descendant of the sister and heiress of William of Wykeham). His grandson, the eighteenth Baron, served as Comptroller of the Household from 1912 to 1915 in the Liberal government of H.H. Asquith. As of 2024 the title is held by his great-grandson, the twenty-second Baron. In 1965 he relinquished the additional surnames of Twisleton and Wykeham.

Eustace Edward Fiennes, second son of the seventeenth Baron, represented Banbury in Parliament and also served as Governor of the Leeward Islands. In 1916 he was created a baronet, of Banbury in the County of Oxford. Since 1944 the baronetcy has been held by his grandson, explorer Ranulph Fiennes. Actors Ralph Fiennes and Joseph Fiennes are from a cadet branch of the family, being descended from Frederick the sixteenth Baron.

Through the marriage of the second Viscount to a daughter of Edward Cecil, 1st Viscount Wimbledon, the family descends from William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley, as well as the Plantagenet Kings of England.

<doc id="459642" wikidata="Q454734" url="?curid=459642" title="Evelyn Underhill">
<text>Evelyn Underhill (6 December 1875 – 15 June 1941) was an English Anglo-Catholic writer and pacifist known for her numerous works on religion and spiritual practice, in particular Christian mysticism. Her best-known work is &quot;Mysticism&quot;, published in 1911.

==Life==
Underhill was born in Wolverhampton. She was a poet and novelist as well as a pacifist and mystic. An only child, she described her early mystical insights as &quot;abrupt experiences of the peaceful, undifferentiated plane of reality—like the &#x27;still desert&#x27; of the mystic—in which there was no multiplicity nor need of explanation&quot;. The meaning of these experiences became a lifelong quest and a source of private angst, provoking her to research and write.

Both her father, Arthur Underhill, and her husband, Hubert Stuart Moore, were writers (on the law), London barristers, and yachtsmen. She and her husband grew up together and were married on 3 July 1907. The couple had no children. She travelled regularly within Europe, primarily to Switzerland, France and Italy, where she pursued her interests in art and Catholicism, visiting numerous churches and monasteries. Neither her husband (a Protestant) nor her parents shared her interest in spiritual matters.

Underhill was called simply &quot;Mrs Moore&quot; by many of her friends. She was a prolific author and published over 30 books either under her maiden name, Underhill, or under the pseudonym &quot;John Cordelier&quot;, as was the case for the 1912 book &quot;The Spiral Way&quot;. Initially an agnostic, she gradually began to acquire an interest in Neoplatonism and from there was increasingly drawn to Catholicism against the objections of her husband, eventually becoming a prominent Anglo-Catholic. Her spiritual mentor from 1921 to 1924 was Baron Friedrich von Hügel, who was appreciative of her writing yet concerned with her focus on mysticism and who encouraged her to adopt a much more Christocentric view as opposed to the theistic and intellectual one she had previously held. She described him as &quot;the most wonderful personality. ... so saintly, truthful, sane and tolerant&quot; (Cropper, p. 44) and was influenced by him toward more charitable and down-to-earth activities. After his death in 1925, her writings became more focused on the Holy Spirit and she became prominent in the Anglican Church as a lay leader of spiritual retreats, a spiritual director for hundreds of individuals, guest speaker, radio lecturer and proponent of contemplative prayer.

Underhill came of age in the Edwardian era, at the turn of the 20th century and, like most of her contemporaries, had a decided romantic bent. The enormous excitement in those days was mysteriously compounded of the psychic, the psychological, the occult, the mystical, the medieval, the advance of science, the apotheosis of art, the rediscovery of the feminine, the unashamedly sensuous, and the most ethereally &quot;spiritual&quot; (Armstrong, p. xiii–xiv). Anglicanism seemed to her out-of-key with this, her world. She sought the centre of life as she and many of her generation conceived it, not in the state religion, but in experience and the heart. This age of &quot;the soul&quot; was one of those periods when a sudden easing of social taboos brings on a great sense of personal emancipation and desire for an El Dorado despised by an older, more morose and insensitive generation.

As an only child, she was devoted to her parents and, later, to her husband. She was fully engaged in the life of a barrister&#x27;s daughter and wife, including the entertainment and charitable work that entailed, and pursued a daily regimen that included writing, research, worship, prayer and meditation. It was a fundamental axiom of hers that all of life was sacred, as that was what &quot;incarnation&quot; was about.

She was a cousin of Francis Underhill, Bishop of Bath and Wells from 1937.

===Education===
Underhill was educated at home, except for three years at a private school in Folkestone, and subsequently read history and botany at King&#x27;s College London. An honorary Doctorate of Divinity was conferred on her by Aberdeen University and she was made a fellow of King&#x27;s College. She was the first woman to lecture to the clergy in the Church of England and the first woman officially to conduct spiritual retreats for the church. She was also the first woman to establish ecumenical links between churches and one of the first woman theologians to lecture in English colleges and universities, which she did frequently. Underhill was an award-winning bookbinder, studying with the most renowned masters of the time. She was schooled in the classics, well read in Western spirituality, well informed (in addition to theology) in the philosophy, psychology, and physics of her day, and was a writer and reviewer for &quot;The Spectator&quot;.
===Early work===

Before undertaking many of her better-known expository works on mysticism, she first published a small book of satirical poems on legal dilemmas, &quot;The Bar-Lamb&#x27;s Ballad Book&quot;, which received a favourable welcome. Underhill then wrote three unconventional, though profoundly spiritual novels. Like Charles Williams and, later, Susan Howatch, Underhill used her narratives to explore the sacramental intersection of the physical with the spiritual. She then uses that sacramental framework effectively to illustrate the unfolding of a human drama. Her novels are entitled &quot;The Grey World&quot; (1904), &quot;The Lost Word&quot; (1907), and &quot;The Column of Dust&quot; (1909). In her first novel, &quot;The Grey World&quot;, described by one reviewer as an extremely interesting psychological study, the hero&#x27;s mystical journey begins with death, and then moves through reincarnation, beyond the grey world, and into the choice of a simple life devoted to beauty, reflecting Underhill&#x27;s own serious perspective as a young woman.
It seems so much easier in these days to live morally than to live beautifully. Lots of us manage to exist for years without ever sinning against society, but we sin against loveliness every hour of the day.
&quot;The Lost Word&quot; and &quot;The Column of Dust&quot; are also concerned with the problem of living in two worlds and reflect the writer&#x27;s own spiritual challenges. In the 1909 novel, her heroine encounters a rift in the solid stuff of her universe:
She had seen, abruptly, the insecurity of those defences which protect our illusions and ward off the horrors of truth. She had found a little hole in the wall of appearances; and peeping through, had caught a glimpse of that seething pot of spiritual forces whence, now and then, a bubble rises to the surface of things.
Underhill&#x27;s novels suggest that perhaps for the mystic, two worlds may be better than one. For her, mystical experience seems inseparable from some kind of enhancement of consciousness or expansion of perceptual and aesthetic horizons—to see things as they are, in their meanness and insignificance when viewed in opposition to the divine reality, but in their luminosity and grandeur when seen bathed in divine radiance. But at this stage the mystic&#x27;s mind is subject to fear and insecurity, its powers undeveloped. The first novel takes us only to this point. Further stages demand suffering, because mysticism is more than merely vision or cultivating a latent potentiality of the soul in cosy isolation. According to Underhill&#x27;s view, the subsequent pain and tension, and final loss of the private painful ego-centered life for the sake of regaining one&#x27;s true self, has little to do with the first beatific vision. Her two later novels are built on the ideal of total self-surrender even to the apparent sacrifice of the vision itself, as necessary for the fullest possible integration of human life. This was for her the equivalent of working out within, the metaphorical intent of the life story of Jesus. One is reunited with the original vision—no longer as mere spectator but as part of it. This dimension of self-loss and resurrection is worked out in &quot;The Lost Word&quot;, but there is some doubt as to its general inevitability. In &quot;The Column of Dust&quot;, the heroine&#x27;s physical death reinforces dramatically the mystical death to which she has already surrendered. Two lives are better than one but only on the condition that a process of painful re-integration intervenes to re-establish unity between Self and Reality.

All her characters derive their interest from the theological meaning and value which they represent, and it is her ingenious handling of so much difficult symbolic material that makes her work psychologically interesting as a forerunner of such 20th-century writers as Susan Howatch, whose successful novels also embody the psychological value of religious metaphor and the traditions of Christian mysticism. Her first novel received critical acclaim, but her last was generally derided. Yet her novels give remarkable insight into what we may assume was her decision to avoid what St Augustine described as the temptation of &quot;fuga in solitudinem&quot; (&quot;the flight into solitude&quot;), but instead acquiescing to a loving, positive acceptance of this world. Not looking back, by this time she was already working on her magnum opus.

==Writings on religion==
===&quot;Mysticism&quot; (1911)===
Underhill&#x27;s book, &quot;Mysticism: A Study of the Nature and Development of Man&#x27;s Spiritual Consciousness&quot;, was published in 1911. The spirit of the book is romantic, engaged, and theoretical rather than historical or scientific. Underhill has little use for theoretical explanations and the traditional religious experience, formal classifications or analysis. She dismisses William James&#x27;s &quot;The Varieties of Religious Experience&quot; (1902), and his &quot;four marks of the mystic state&quot; (ineffability, noetic quality, transience, and passivity). James had admitted that his own constitution shut him off almost entirely from the enjoyment of mystical states, thus his treatment was purely objective. Underhill substituted (1) mysticism is practical, not theoretical, (2) mysticism is an entirely spiritual activity, (3) the business and method of mysticism is love, and (4) mysticism entails a definite psychological experience. Her insistence on the psychological approach was that it was the glamorous science of the pre-war period, offering the potential key to the secrets of human advances in intelligence, creativity, and genius, and already psychological findings were being applied in theology (i.e., William Sanday&#x27;s &quot;Christologies Ancient and Modern&quot;).

She divided her subject into two parts: the first, an introduction, and the second, a detailed study of the nature and development of human consciousness. In the first section, in order to free the subject of mysticism from confusion and misapprehension, she approached it from the point of view of the psychologist, the symbolist and the theologian. To separate mysticism from its most dubious connection, she included a chapter on mysticism and magic. Mysticism has been associated with the occult, magic, secret rites, and fanaticism, while she knew the mystics throughout history to be the world&#x27;s spiritual pioneers.

She divided her map of &quot;the way&quot; into five stages: the first was the &quot;Awakening of Self&quot;. She quotes Henry Suso (disciple of Meister Eckhart):
That which the Servitor saw had no form neither any manner of being; yet he had of it a joy such as he might have known in the seeing of shapes and substances of all joyful things. His heart was hungry, yet satisfied, his soul was full of contentment and joy: his prayers and his hopes were fulfilled. (Cropper p. 46)
Underhill tells how Suso&#x27;s description of how the abstract truth (related to each soul&#x27;s true nature and purpose), once remembered, contains the power of fulfilment and became the starting point of her own path. The second stage she presents as psychological &quot;Purgation of
Self&quot;, quoting the Theologia Germanica (14th century, anonymous) regarding the transcendence of ego (Underhill&#x27;s &quot;little self&quot;):
We must cast all things from us and strip ourselves of them and refrain from claiming anything for our own.
The third stage she titles &quot;Illumination&quot; and quotes William Law:
Everything in ...nature, is descended out that which is eternal, and stands as a. ..visible outbirth of it, so when we know how to separate out the grossness, death, and darkness. ..from it, we find. ..it in its eternal state.
The fourth stage she describes as the &quot;Dark Night of the Soul&quot; (which her correspondence leads us to believe she struggled with throughout her life) wherein one is deprived of all that has been valuable to the lower self, and quoting Mechthild of Magdeburg:
...since Thou hast taken from me all that I had of Thee, yet of Thy grace leave me the gift which every dog has by nature: that of being true to Thee in my distress, when I am deprived of all consolation. This I desire more fervently than Thy heavenly Kingdom.
And last she devotes a chapter to the unitive life, the sum of the mystic way:
When love has carried us above all things into the Divine Dark, there we are transformed by the Eternal Word Who is the image of the Father; and as the air is penetrated by the sun, thus we receive in peace the Incomprehensible Light, enfolding us, and penetrating us. (Ruysbroech)

Where Underhill struck new ground was in her insistence that this state of union produced a glorious and fruitful creativeness, so that the mystic who attains this final perfectness is the most active doer – not the reclusive dreaming lover of God.
We are all the kindred of the mystics. ..Strange and far away from us though they seem, they are not cut off from us by some impassable abyss. They belong to us; the giants, the heroes of our race. As the achievement of genius belongs not to itself only but also to the society that brought it forth;...the supernal accomplishment of the mystics is ours also. ..our guarantee of the end to which immanent love, the hidden steersman. ..is moving. ..us on the path toward the Real. They come back to us from an encounter with life&#x27;s most august secret. ..filled with amazing tidings which they can hardly tell. We, longing for some assurance. ..urge them to pass on their revelation. ..the old demand of the dim-sighted and incredulous. ..But they cannot. ..only fragments of the Symbolic Vision. According to their strength and passion, these lovers of the Absolute. ..have not shrunk from the suffering. ..Beauty and agony have called. ..have awakened a heroic response. For them the winter is over. ..Life new, unquenchable and lovely comes to meet them with the dawn. (Cropper, p. 47)

The book ends with an extremely valuable appendix, a kind of who&#x27;s who of mysticism, which shows its persistence and interconnection from century to century.

===&quot;Ruysbroeck&quot; (1914)===
A work by Evelyn Underhill on the 14th-century Flemish mystic Jan van Ruusbroec (1293–1381), entitled &quot;Ruysbroeck&quot;, was published in London in 1914. She had discussed him from several different perspectives during the course of her 1911 book on &quot;Mysticism&quot;.

I. &quot;Life.&quot; She starts with a biography, drawn mainly from two near-contemporary works on his life, each written by a fellow monastic: Pomerius, and Gerard Naghel.

His childhood was spent in the village of Ruysbroeck. [page 7] At eleven he ran away to Brussels, where he began to live with his uncle, John Hinckaert, a canon at the Cathedral of St Gudule, and a younger canon, Francis van Coudenberg. [10] At twenty-four he was ordained a priest and became a prebend at St Gudule. [12] At his first Mass he envisioned his mother&#x27;s spirit released from Purgatory and entering Heaven. [15] From age 26 to 50 Ruysbroeck was a cathedral chaplain at St Gudule. [15] Although he &quot;seemed a nobody to those who did not know him&quot;, he was developing a strong spiritual life, &quot;a penetrating intellect, a fearless heart, deep knowledge of human nature, remarkable powers of expression&quot;. [17] At one point he wrote strong pamphlets and led a campaign against a heretical group, the Brethren of the Free Spirit led by Bloemardinne, who practiced a self-indulgent &quot;mysticality&quot;. [18–20] Later, with the two now elderly canons, he moved into the countryside at Groenendael (&quot;Green Valley&quot;). [21–22] Pomerius writes that he retired not to hide his light &quot;but that he might tend it better&quot; [22]. Five years later their community became a Priory under the Augustinian Canons. [23]

Many of his works were written during this period, often drawing lessons from nature. [24] He had a favourite tree, under which he would sit and write what the &#x27;Spirit&#x27; gave to him. [25] He solemnly affirmed that his works were composed under the &quot;domination of an inspiring power&quot;, writes Underhill. [26] Pomerius says that Ruysbroeck could enter a state of contemplation in which he appeared surrounded by radiant light. [26–27] Alongside his spiritual ascent, Naghel says, he cultivated the friendship of those around him, enriching their lives. [27–28] He worked in the garden fields of the priory, and sought to help out creatures of the forest. [29–30] He moved from the senses to the transcendent without frontiers or cleavage, Underhill writes, these being for him &quot;but two moods within the mind of God&quot;. [30] He counseled many who came to him, including Gerard Groot of the Brothers of the Common Life. [31] His advice would plumb the &quot;purity and direction&quot; of the seeker&#x27;s will, and the seeker&#x27;s love. [32] There, at Groenendael, he finally made a &quot;leap to a more abundant life&quot;. [34] In &quot;The Sparkling Stone&quot; Ruysbroeck wrote about coming to know the love &quot;which giveth more than one can take, and asketh more than one can pay&quot;. [34]

II. &quot;Works.&quot; Next, Underhill gives a bibliography of Ruysbroeck&#x27;s eleven admittedly authentic works, providing details on each work&#x27;s origin, nature, and contents, as well as their place in his writings. 1. &quot;The Spiritual Tabernacle&quot;; 2. &quot;The Twelve Points of True Faith&quot;; 3. &quot;The Book of the Four Temptations&quot;; 4. &quot;The Book of the Kingdom of God&#x27;s Lovers&quot;; 5. &quot;The Adornment of the Spiritual Marriage&quot;; 6. &quot;The Mirror of Eternal Salvation&quot; or &quot;Book of the Blessed Sacraments&quot;; 7. &quot;The Seven Cloisters&quot;; 8. &quot;The Seven Degrees of the Ladder of Love&quot;; 9. &quot;The Book of the Sparkling Stone&quot;; 10. &quot;The Book of the Supreme Truth&quot;; 11. &quot;The Twelve Béguines&quot;. [36–51]

III. &quot;Doctrine of God.&quot; Several types of mystics are described. The first (e .g., St Teresa) deals with personal psychological experiences and emotional reactions, leaving the nature of God to existing theology. [page 52] The second (e. g., Plotinus) has passion sprung from the vision of a philosopher; the intellect often is more active than the heart, yet like a poet such a mystic strives to sketch his vision of the Ultimate. [53] The greatest mystics (e. g., St Augustine) embrace at once &quot;the infinite and the intimate&quot; so that &quot;God is both near and far, and the paradox of transcendent-immanent Reality is a self-evident if an inexpressible truth.&quot; Such mystics &quot;give us by turns a subjective and psychological, an objective and metaphysical, reading of spiritual experience.&quot; Here is Ruysbroeck. [53–54]

An apostolic mystic [55] represents humanity in its quest to discern the Divine Reality, she writes, being like &quot;the artist extending our universe, the pioneer cutting our path, the hunter winning food for our souls.&quot; [56] Yet, although his experience is personal, his language is often drawn from tradition. [57] His words about an ineffable Nature of God, &quot;a dim silence, and a wild desert,&quot; may be suggestive, musical, she writes, &quot;which enchant rather than inform the soul&quot;. [58] Ruysbroeck goes venturing &quot;to hover over that Abyss which is &#x27;beyond Reason,&#x27; stammering and breaking into wild poetry in the desperate attempt to seize the unseizable truth.&quot; [55] &quot;[T]he One is &#x27;neither This nor That&#x27;.&quot; [61]

&quot;God as known by man&quot; is the Absolute One who combines and resolves the contradictory natures of time and eternity, becoming and being; who is both transcendent and immanent, abstract and personal, work and rest, the unmoved mover and movement itself. God is above the storm, yet inspires the flux. [59–60] The &quot;omnipotent and ever-active Creator&quot; who is &quot;perpetually breathing forth His energetic Life in new births of being and new floods of grace.&quot; [60] Yet the soul may persist, go beyond this &quot;fruitful&quot; nature, into the simple essence of God. There we humans would find that &quot;absolute and abiding Reality, which seems to man Eternal Rest, the &#x27;Deep Quiet of the Godhead,&#x27; the &#x27;Abyss,&#x27; the &#x27;Dim Silence&#x27;; and which we can taste indeed but never know. There, &#x27;all lovers lose themselves&#x27;.&quot; [60]

The Trinity, according to Ruysbroeck, works in living distinctions, &quot;the fruitful nature of the Persons.&quot; [61] The Trinity in itself is a Unity, yet a manifestation of the active and creative Divine, a Union of Three Persons, which is the Godhead. [60–61] Beyond and within the Trinity, or the Godhead, then, is the &quot;fathomless Abyss&quot; [60] that &quot;is&quot; the &quot;Simple Being of God&quot; that is &quot;an Eternal Rest of God and of all created things.&quot; [61]

The Father is the unconditioned Origin, Strength and Power, of all things. [62] The Son is the Eternal Word and Wisdom that shines forth in the world of conditions. [62] The Holy Spirit is Love and Generosity emanating from the mutual contemplation of Father and Son. [62] The Three Persons &quot;exist in an &quot;eternal distinction&quot; [emphasis added] for that world of conditions wherein the human soul is immersed&quot;. [63] By the acts of the Three Persons all created things are born; by the incarnation and crucifixion we human souls are adorned with love, and so to be drawn back to our Source. &quot;This is the circling course of the Divine life-process.&quot; [63]

But beyond and above this &quot;eternal distinction&quot; lies &quot;the superessential world, transcending all conditions, inaccessible to thought-- &#x27;the measureless solitude of the Godhead, where God possesses Himself in joy.&#x27; This is the ultimate world of the mystic.&quot; [63–64] There, she continues, quoting Ruysbroeck: &quot;[W]e can speak no more of Father, Son and Holy Spirit nor of any creature; but only of one Being, which is the very substance of the Divine Persons. There were we all one before our creation; for this is our &quot;superessence&quot;... . There the Godhead is, in simple essence, without activity; Eternal Rest, Unconditioned Dark, the Nameless Being, the Superessence of all created things, and the simple and infinite Bliss of God and of all the Saints.&quot; [64] &quot;The simple light of this Being... includes and embraces the unity of the Divine Persons and the soul... .&quot; It envelopes and irradiates the ground (movement) of human souls and the fruition of their adherence to God, finding union in the &quot;Divine life-process&quot;, the Rose. &quot;And this is the union of God and the souls that love Him.&quot; [64–65]

IV. &quot;Doctrine of Humankind.&quot; For Ruysbroeck, &quot;God is the &#x27;Living Pattern of Creation&#x27; who has impressed His image on each soul, and in every adult spirit the character of that image must be brought from the hiddenness and realized.&quot; [66] The pattern is trinitarian; there are three properties of the human soul. First, resembling the Father, &quot;the bare, still place to which consciousness retreats in introversion... .&quot; [67] Second, following the Son, &quot;the power of knowing Divine things by intuitive comprehension: man&#x27;s fragmentary share in the character of the Logos, or Wisdom of God.&quot; [67–68] &quot;The third property we call the &quot;spark&quot; of the soul. It is the inward and natural tendency of the soul towards its Source; and here do we receive the Holy Spirit, the Charity of God.&quot; [68]. So will God work within the human being; in later spiritual development we may form with God a Union, and eventually a Unity. [70–71]

The mighty force of Love is the &quot;very self-hood of God&quot; in this mysterious communion. [72, 73] &quot;As we lay hold upon the Divine Life, devour and assimilate it, so in that very act the Divine Life devours us, and knits us up into the mystical Body,&quot; she writes. &quot;It is the nature of love,&quot; says Ruysbroeck, &quot;ever to give and to take, to love and be loved, and these two things meet in whomsoever loves. Thus the love of Christ is both avid and generous... as He devours us, so He would feed us. If He absorbs us utterly into Himself, in return He gives us His very self again.&quot; [75–76] &quot;Hungry love,&quot; &quot;generous love,&quot; &quot;stormy love&quot; touches the human soul with its Divine creative energy and, once we become conscious of it, evokes in us an answering storm of love. &quot;The whole of our human growth within the spiritual order is conditioned by the quality of this response; by the will, the industry, the courage, with which [we accept our] part in the Divine give-and-take.&quot; [74] As Ruysbroeck puts it:
That measureless Love which is God Himself, dwells in the pure deeps of our spirit, like a burning brazier of coal. And it throws forth brilliant and fiery sparks which stir and enkindle heart and senses, will and desire, and all the powers of the soul, with a fire of love; a storm, a rage, a measureless fury of love. These be the weapons with which we fight against the terrible and immense Love of God, who would consume all loving spirits and swallow them in Himself. Love arms us with its own gifts, and clarifies our reason, and commands, counsels and advises us to oppose Him, to fight against Him, and to maintain against Him our right to love, so long as we may. [74–75]
The drama of this giving and receiving Love constitutes a single act, for God is as an &quot;ocean which ebbs and flows&quot; or as an &quot;inbreathing and outbreathing&quot;. [75, 76] &quot;Love is a unifying power, manifested in motion itself, &#x27;an outgoing attraction, which drags us out of ourselves and calls us to be melted and naughted in the Unity&#x27;; and all his deepest thoughts of it are expressed in terms of movement.&quot; [76]

Next, the spiritual development of the soul is addressed. [76–88] Ruysbroeck adumbrates how one may progress from the Active life, to the Interior life, to the Superessential life; these correspond to the three natural orders of Becoming, Being, and God, or to the three rôles of the Servant, the Friend, and the &quot;hidden child&quot; of God. [77, 85] The Active life focuses on ethics, on conforming the self&#x27;s daily life to the Will of God, and takes place in the world of the senses, &quot;by means&quot;. [78] The Interior life embraces a vision of spiritual reality, where the self&#x27;s contacts with the Divine take place &quot;without means&quot;. [78] The Superessential life transcends the intellectual plane, whereby the self does not merely behold, but rather has fruition of the Godhead in life and in love, at work and at rest, in union and in bliss. [78, 86, 87] The analogy with the traditional &quot;threefold way&quot; of Purgation, Illumination, and Union, is not exact. The Interior life of Ruysbroeck contains aspects of the traditional Union also, while the Superessential life &quot;takes the soul to heights of fruition which few amongst even the greatest unitive mystics have attained or described.&quot; [78–79]

At the end of her chapter IV, she discusses &quot;certain key-words frequent in Ruysbroeck&#x27;s works,&quot; e.g., &quot;Fruition&quot; [89], &quot;Simple&quot; [89–90], &quot;Bareness&quot; or &quot;Nudity&quot; [90], and &quot;the great pair of opposites, fundamental to his thought, called in the Flemish vernacular &quot;wise&quot; and &quot;onwise&quot;.&quot; [91–93] The &quot;wise&quot; can be understood by the &quot;normal man [living] within the temporal order&quot; by use of &quot;his ordinary mental furniture&quot;. [91] Yet regarding the &quot;onwise&quot; he has &quot;escaped alike from the tyrannies and comforts of the world&quot; and made the &quot;ascent into the Nought&quot;. [92] She comments, &quot;This is the direct, unmediated world of spiritual intuition; where the self touches a Reality that has not been passed through the filters of sense and thought.&quot; [92] After a short quote from Jalālu&#x27;ddīn Rumi, she completes her chapter by presenting 18 lines from Ruysbroeck&#x27;s &quot;The Twelve Bêguines&quot; (cap. viii) which concern Contemplation: 

:Contemplation is a knowing that is in no wise ...
:Never can it sink down into the Reason,
:And above it can the Reason never climb. ...
:It is not God,
:But it is the Light by which we see Him.
:Those who walk in the Divine Light of it
:Discover in themselves the Unwalled. 
:That which is in no wise, is above Reason, not without it ...
:The contemplative life is without amazement. 
:That which is in no wise sees, it knows not what;
:For it is above all, and is neither This nor That. [93]

V, VI, VII, VIII. In her last four chapters, Underhill continues her discussion of Ruysbroeck, describing the Active Life [94–114], the Interior Life (Illumination and Destitution [115–135], Union and Contemplation [136–163]), and the Superessential Life [164–185].

===&quot;The Mysticism of Plotinus&quot; (1919)===
An essay originally published in &quot;The Quarterly Review&quot; (1919), and later collected in &quot;The Essentials of Mysticism and other essays&quot; (London: J. M. Dent 1920) at pp. 116–140. Underhill here addresses Plotinus (204–270) of Alexandria and later of Rome.

A Neoplatonist as well as a spiritual guide, Plotinus writes regarding both formal philosophy and hands-on, personal, inner experience. Underhill makes the distinction between the geographer who draws maps of the mind, and the seeker who actually travels in the realms of spirit. [page 118] She observes that usually mystics do not follow the mere maps of metaphysicians. [page 117]

In the &quot;Enneads&quot; Plotinus presents the Divine as an unequal triune, in descending order: (a) the One, perfection, having nothing, seeking nothing, needing nothing, yet it overflows creatively, the source of being; [121] (b) the emitted &quot;Nous&quot; or Spirit, with intelligence, wisdom, poetic intuition, the &quot;Father and Companion&quot; of the soul; [121–122] and, (c) the emitted Soul or Life, the vital essence of the world, which aspires to communion with the Spirit above, while also directly engaged with the physical world beneath. [123]

People &quot;come forth from God&quot; and will find happiness once re-united, first with the &quot;Nous&quot;, later with the One. [125] Such might be the merely logical outcome for the metaphysician, yet Plotinus the seeker also presents this return to the Divine as a series of moral purgations and a shedding of irrational delusions, leading eventually to entry into the intuitively beautiful. [126] This intellectual and moral path toward a life aesthetic will progressively disclose an invisible source, the &quot;Nous&quot;, the forms of Beauty. [127] Love is the prevailing inspiration, although the One is impersonal. [128] The mystic will pass through stages of purification, and of enlightenment, resulting in a shift in the centre of our being &quot;from sense to soul, from soul to spirit,&quot; in preparation for an &quot;ultimate transformation of consciousness&quot;. [125, 127] Upon our arrival, we shall know ecstasy and &quot;no longer sing out of tune, but form a divine chorus round the One.&quot; [129]

St. Augustine (354–430) criticizes such Neoplatonism as neglecting the needs of struggling and imperfect human beings. The One of Plotinus may act as a magnet for the human soul, but it cannot be said to show mercy, nor to help, or love, or redeem the individual on earth. [130] Other western mystics writing on the Neoplatonists mention this lack of &quot;mutual attraction&quot; between humanity and the unconscious, unknowable One. [130–131] In this regard Julian of Norwich (1342–1416) would write, &quot;Our natural will is to have God, and the good-will of God is to have us.&quot; [130]

Plotinus leaves the problem of evil unresolved, but having no place in the blissful life; here, the social, ethical side of religion seems to be shorted. His philosophy does not include qualities comparable to the Gospel&#x27;s divine &quot;transfiguration of pain&quot; through Jesus. [131] Plotinus &quot;the self-sufficient sage&quot; does not teach us charity, writes St. Augustine. [132]

Nonetheless, Underhill notes, Plotinus and Neoplatonism were very influential among the mystics of Christianity (and Islam). St. Augustine the Church Father was himself deeply affected by Plotinus, and through him the western Church. [133–135, 137] So, too, was Dionysius (5th century, Syria), whose writings would also prove very influential. [133, 135] As well were others, e.g., Erigena [135], Dante [136], Ruysbroeck [136, 138], Eckhart [138], and Boehme [139].

===&quot;Worship&quot; (1936)===
In her preface, the author disclaims being &quot;a liturgical expert&quot;. Neither is it her purpose to offer criticism of the different approaches to worship as practiced by the various religious bodies. Rather she endeavors to show &quot;the love that has gone to their adornment [and] the shelter they can offer to many different kinds of adoring souls.&quot; She begins chapter one by declaring that &quot;Worship, in all its grades and kinds, is the response of the creature to the Eternal: nor need we limit this definition to the human sphere. ...we may think of the whole of the Universe, seen and unseen, conscious and unconscious, as an act of worship.&quot;

==Influences==
Underhill&#x27;s life was greatly affected by her husband&#x27;s resistance to her joining the Catholic Church, to which she was powerfully drawn and which she entered in the year of their marriage. At first she believed it to be only a delay in her decision, but it proved to be lifelong. He was a writer himself and was supportive of her writing both before and after their marriage in 1907, though he did not share her spiritual affinities. Her fiction was written in the six years of 1903–1909 and represents her four major interests of that general period: philosophy (neoplatonism), theism/mysticism, the Catholic liturgy, and human love/compassion. In her earlier writings Underhill often wrote using the terms &quot;mysticism&quot; and &quot;mystics&quot; but later began to adopt the terms &quot;spirituality&quot; and &quot;saints&quot; because she felt they were less threatening. She was often criticized for believing that the mystical life should be accessible to the average person.

Her fiction was also influenced by the literary creed expounded by her close friend Arthur Machen, mainly his &quot;Hieroglyphics&quot; of 1902, summarised by his biographer:
There are certain truths about the universe and its constitution – as distinct from the particular things in it that come before our observation – which cannot be grasped by human reason or expressed in precise words: but they can be apprehended by some people at least, in a semi-mystical experience, called ecstasy, and a work of art is great insofar as this experience is caught and expressed in it. Because, however, the truths concerned transcend a language attuned to the description of material objects, the expression can only be through hieroglyphics, and it is of such hieroglyphics that literature consists.

In Underhill&#x27;s case the quest for psychological realism is subordinate to larger metaphysical considerations which she shared with Arthur Machen. Incorporating the Holy Grail into their fiction (stimulated perhaps by their association with Arthur Waite and his affiliation with the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn), for Machen the Holy Grail was perhaps &quot;the&quot; hieroglyph, &quot;the&quot; crystallisation in one sacred emblem of all man&#x27;s transcendental yearning, &quot;the&quot; gateway to vision and lasting appeasement of his discontents, while for her it was the center of atonement-linked meanings as she pointed out to Margaret Robinson in a letter responding to Robinson&#x27;s criticism of Underhill&#x27;s last novel:
Don&#x27;t marvel at your own temerity in criticising. Why should you? Of course, this thing wasn&#x27;t written for you – I never write for anyone at all, except in letters of direction! But, I take leave to think the doctrine contained in it is one you&#x27;ll have to assimilate sooner or later and which won&#x27;t do you any harm. It&#x27;s not &quot;mine&quot; you know. You will find it all in Eckhart. ... They all know, as Richard of St Victor said, that the Fire of Love &quot;burns.&quot; We have not fulfilled our destiny when we have sat down at a safe distance from it, purring like overfed cats, &#x27;suffering is the ancient law of love&#x27; – and its highest pleasure into the bargain, oddly enough. ... A sponge cake and milk religion is neither true to this world nor to the next. As for the Christ being too august a word for our little hardships – I think it is truer that it is &quot;so&quot; august as to give our little hardships a tincture of Royalty once we try them up into it. I don&#x27;t think a Pattern which was &#x27;meek &amp; lowly&#x27; is likely to fail of application to very humble and ordinary things. For most of us don&#x27;t get a chance &quot;but&quot; the humble and ordinary: and He came that we might all have life more abundantly, according to our measure. There that&#x27;s all!

Two contemporary philosophical writers dominated Underhill&#x27;s thinking at the time she wrote &quot;Mysticism&quot;: Rudolf Eucken and Henri Bergson. While neither displayed an interest in mysticism, both seemed to their disciples to advance a spiritual explanation of the universe. Also, she describes the fashionable creed of the time as &quot;vitalism&quot; and the term adequately sums up the prevailing worship of life in all its exuberance, variety and limitless possibility which pervaded pre-war culture and society. For her, Eucken and Bergson confirmed the deepest intuitions of the mystics. (Armstrong, &quot;Evelyn Underhill&quot;)

Among the mystics, Ruysbroeck was to her the most influential and satisfying of all the medieval mystics, and she found herself very much at one with him in the years when he was working as an unknown priest in Brussels, for she herself had also a hidden side.
His career which covers the greater part of the fourteenth century, that golden age of Christian Mysticism, seems to exhibit within the circle of a single personality, and carry up to a higher term than ever before, all the best attainments of the Middle Ages in the realm of Eternal life. The central doctrine of the Divine Fatherhood, and of the soul&#x27;s power to become the Son of God, it is this raised to the of intensity ... and demonstrated with the exactitude of the mathematician, and the passion of a poet, which Ruysbroeck gives us ... the ninth and tenth chapters of &quot;The Sparkling Stone&quot; the high water mark of mystical literature. Nowhere else do we find such a combination of soaring vision with the most delicate and intimate psychological analysis. The old Mystic sitting under his tree, seems here to be gazing at and reporting to us the final secrets of that Eternal World... (Cropper, p. 57) 

One of her most significant influences and important collaborations was with the Nobel Laureate, Rabindranath Tagore, the Indian mystic, author, and world traveller. They published a major translation of the work of Kabir (&quot;100 Poems of Kabir&quot;, called &quot;Songs of Kabir&quot;) together in 1915, to which she wrote the introduction. He introduced her to the spiritual genius of India which she expressed enthusiastically in a letter:
This is the first time I have had the privilege of being with one who is a Master in the things I care so much about but know so little of as yet: &amp; I understand now something of what your writers mean when they insist on the necessity and value of the personal teacher and the fact that he gives something which the learner cannot get in any other way. It has been like hearing the language of which I barely know the alphabet, spoken perfectly. (Letters)
They did not keep up their correspondence in later years. Both suffered debilitating illnesses in the last year of life and died in the summer of 1941, greatly distressed by the outbreak of World War II.

In 1921, Underhill was to all outward appearances in an assured and enviable position. She had been asked by the University of Oxford to give the first of a new series of lectures on religion, and she was the first woman to gain such an honour. She was an authority on her own subject of mysticism and respected for her research and scholarship. Her writing was in demand, and she had an interesting and notable set of friends, devoted readers, a happy marriage and affectionate and loyal parents. At the same time she felt that her foundations were insecure and that her zeal for Reality was resting on a basis that was too fragile.

By 1939, she was a member of the Anglican Pacifist Fellowship, writing a number of important tracts expressing her anti-war sentiment.

After converting to Anglicanism, and perhaps overwhelmed by her knowledge of the achievements of the mystics and their perilous heights, her ten-year friendship with Catholic philosopher and writer Baron Friedrich von Hügel turned into one of spiritual direction. Charles Williams wrote in his introduction to her &quot;Letters&quot;: &#x27;The equal swaying level of devotion and scepticism (related to the church) which is, for some souls, as much the Way as continuous simple faith is to others, was a distress to her... She wanted to be &quot;sure.&quot; Writing to Von Hügel of the darkness she struggled with:
What ought I to do?...being naturally self-indulgent and at present unfortunately professionally very prosperous and petted, nothing will get done unless I make a Rule. Neither intellectual work nor religion give me any real discipline because I have a strong attachment to both...it is useless advising anything people could notice or that would look pious. That is beyond me. In my lucid moments I see only too clearly that the only possible end of this road is complete, unconditional self-consecration, and for this I have not the nerve, the character or the depth. There has been some sort of mistake. My soul is too small for it and yet it is at bottom the only thing that I really want. It feels sometimes as if, whilst still a jumble of conflicting impulses and violent faults I were being pushed from behind towards an edge I dare not jump over.&quot;

In a later letter 12 July, the Baron&#x27;s practical concerns for signs of strain in Underhill&#x27;s spiritual state are expressed. His comments give insight into her struggles:
I do not at all like this craving for absolute certainty that this or that experience of yours, is what it seems to yourself. And I am assuredly not going to declare that I am absolutely certain of the final and evidential worth of any of those experiences. They are not articles of faith. ... You are at times tempted to scepticism and so you long to have some, if only one direct personal experience which shall be beyond the reach of all reasonable doubt. But such an escape...would...possibly be a most dangerous one, and would only weaken you, or shrivel you, or puff you up. By all means...believe them, if and when they humble and yet brace you, to be probably from God. But do not build your faith upon them; do not make them an end when they exist only to be a means...I am not sure that God does want a marked preponderance of this or that work or virtue in our life – that would feed still further your natural temperament, already too vehement. (Cropper biography)

Although Underhill continued to struggle to the end, craving certainty that her beatific visions were purposeful, suffering as only a pacifist can from the devastating onslaught of World War II and the Church&#x27;s powerlessness to affect events, she may well have played a powerful part in the survival of her country through the influence of her words and the impact of her teachings on thousands regarding the power of prayer. 

Surviving the London Blitz of 1940, her health disintegrated further and she died in the following year. She is buried with her husband in the churchyard extension at St John-at-Hampstead in London.

More than any other person, she was responsible for introducing the forgotten authors of medieval and Catholic spirituality to a largely Protestant audience and the lives of eastern mystics to the English-speaking world. As a frequent guest on radio, her 1936 work &quot;The Spiritual Life&quot; was especially influential as transcribed from a series of broadcasts given as a sequel to those by Dom Bernard Clements on the subject of prayer. Fellow theologian Charles Williams wrote the introduction to her published &quot;Letters&quot; in 1943, which reveal much about this prodigious woman. Upon her death, &quot;The Times&quot; reported that on the subject of theology, she was &quot;unmatched by any of the professional teachers of her day.&quot;

==Veneration==
Evelyn Underhill is honoured on 15 June in the liturgical calendars of several Anglican churches, including those of the Anglican Church of Australia, the Anglican Church in Aotearoa, New Zealand and Polynesia, the Episcopal Anglican Church of Brazil, the Church of England, the Episcopal Church in the United States of America, and the Anglican Church in North America.

<doc id="459664" wikidata="Q782879" url="?curid=459664" title="The Beacon Street Collection">
<text>The Beacon Street Collection is the second studio album by American rock band No Doubt. It was released independently on March 25, 1995, through the band&#x27;s label Beacon Street Records. Produced by the band and recorded in a homemade studio in the garage of their house on Beacon Avenue in Anaheim, California, from which the album takes its name, &quot;The Beacon Street Collection&quot; was released during a period when the band was receiving little attention from their label Interscope Records, and were not getting a chance to record a second album, as the label was disillusioned with them after the commercial failure of their 1992 eponymous debut. No Doubt had written large numbers of songs and knew that they would not make it onto any Interscope album, so they built their own studio and recorded the album there. Two singles were released: &quot;Squeal&quot; and &quot;Doghouse&quot;.

The album sold over 100,000 copies, over three times as many as their first album sold. Its success ensured that Interscope financed the band&#x27;s third album &quot;Tragic Kingdom&quot;, which was a massive success, selling 16 million copies worldwide and attracting extensive interest in the band. &quot;The Beacon Street Collection&quot; was re-released in 1997 by Interscope as part of the band&#x27;s back catalog.

== Background ==

No Doubt released their self-titled debut album in 1992, a year after being signed to Interscope. The group&#x27;s blend of upbeat brass-dominated songs and funk-style bass riffs came at a time when most of the United States was in the thrall of grunge music, a genre whose angst-ridden lyrics and dirty sound could not have contrasted more with the atmosphere of most of the songs on No Doubt&#x27;s pop-oriented album. Not surprisingly, the band lost out to the now-ubiquitous grunge music and the album was a commercial failure, with only 30,000 copies sold. In the words of the program director of KROQ, a Los Angeles radio station on which it was one of the band&#x27;s driving ambitions to be played: &quot;It would take an act of God for this band to get on the radio.&quot;

The band started to work on its second album in 1993 but Interscope, having lost faith in the band, rejected most of its material and so it was paired with producer Matthew Wilder. Eric Stefani did not like to relinquish creative control to someone outside the band and eventually stopped recording or rehearsing. He left No Doubt in 1994 to pursue an animation career on the cartoon TV series &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. Kanal then ended his seven-year relationship with Gwen, saying that he needed &quot;space&quot;.

== Music ==
A large number of songs on &quot;The Beacon Street Collection&quot; were written by Eric Stefani, who left the group before their third album was recorded. This gave the album a similar sound to their first album, &quot;No Doubt&quot;, in which Eric Stefani had collaborated in the writing of all the songs. Because the lyrics in &quot;Tragic Kingdom&quot; were written mainly by Gwen Stefani about her experiences in life, the style of music changed from what No Doubt had previously produced. Tom Dumont explained the change in sound in an interview for Backstage Online:

=== Production ===
No Doubt became frustrated at the lack of progress they were making with Interscope, who were proving unreliable in their support of the band. Instead, they built their own studio in their garage on Beacon Avenue in Anaheim, California Although the band had knowledge that they didn&#x27;t want any songs to be released in an Interscope-distributed album, they recorded &quot;The Beacon Street Collection&quot; in their studio and Clear Lake Audio in one long weekend. Their independence shocked their company representative, Tony Ferguson, who had assumed they were recording a third single.

=== Singles ===
In 1994, before recording of the album had even begun, No Doubt released two seven-inch singles for their fans. The first was &quot;Squeal&quot;, a song written by Eric Stefani, detailing a criminal&#x27;s reaction to her partner&#x27;s betrayal to the police. They had agreed to be &quot;in this together&quot; but, after he &quot;squeals&quot;, she resolves to &quot;kill the narc who wrote it and said it [that she was guilty of a crime]&quot;. The single&#x27;s B-side was &quot;My Room Is Still Clean&quot;, written by Tony Kanal and recorded live at the Icehouse in Fullerton, California on February 13, 1993.

The second single was &quot;Doghouse&quot;, written by Eric Stefani. It is about a man who is bullied and dominated by his girlfriend and is unwilling to force the situation to change. The song uses the metaphor of a dog and its master to illustrate the nature of the relationship, saying that she had got him &quot;by the reins&quot; and he has been &quot;conditioned&quot; by her. The single&#x27;s B-side was &quot;You Can&#x27;t Teach an Ol&#x27; Dog New Tricks&quot;, written by Eric Stefani.

== Reception ==
=== Significance ===

On its original release in March 1995, &quot;The Beacon Street Collection&quot; was only available in local record stores in Orange County, California and at No Doubt&#x27;s shows. Its rawer sound proved popular with the band&#x27;s fans and the band&#x27;s first batch of one thousand copies sold out within only a few months after its release. Interscope realized the band&#x27;s potential and allowed them to record their third album, &quot;Tragic Kingdom&quot; in various Los Angeles studios, &quot;wherever they could get a deal on a studio&quot;. During a recording session, the band was introduced to Paul Palmer, who was interested in mixing the new album. He owned his own record label Trauma Records, which was associated with Interscope. Interscope willingly sublicensed the project to Trauma Records in 1995 and &quot;Tragic Kingdom&quot; got the personal focus that comes from a small company.

By the end of the year, 100,000 copies of &quot;The Beacon Street Collection&quot; had been sold, over three times as many as their first album, &quot;No Doubt&quot;. These sales were mostly due to the release of &quot;Tragic Kingdom&quot;, which was released seven months after &quot;The Beacon Street Collection&quot; in October 1995. &quot;Tragic Kingdom&quot; was a massive commercial success, reaching sales of over 10 million in the United States and 16 million worldwide, peaking at number one on several charts and being certified Diamond (10,000,000 units) in the US and Canada and Platinum in the UK and Australia. This success created an extensive interest in the band&#x27;s back catalog so, in October 1997, &quot;The Beacon Street Collection&quot; was re-released on Interscope.

In an interview with Axcess Magazine in April 1996, Gwen Stefani described the release of &quot;The Beacon Street Collection&quot; as &quot;one of the best things [they] ever did because [they] were able to take some songs that would have probably gotten lost and document them&quot;.

AllMusic called the album &quot;finer than the [band&#x27;s] debut&quot;, and described it as containing more of a &quot;raw sound inspired [...] by punk&quot; than the style of No Doubt&#x27;s first album, which was heavily &quot;synth and new wave&quot;. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, in 1997, called it &quot;more focused than &quot;Tragic Kingdom&quot;&quot; with &quot;reggae frat-house grooves and perky horns&quot;, and complimented &quot;Gwen&#x27;s feisty Kewpie-doll wail&quot; and the &quot;swaying ballads&quot;, attributing it to &quot;the band&#x27;s willing spirit&quot;. Rock on the Net retrospectively called the album &quot;a raw expression of their sound&quot; and describing it as &quot;80s punk with 90s grunge.

<text>USS &quot;Katahdin&quot; was a built for the U.S. Navy during the American Civil War.

&quot;Katahdin&quot; was outfitted as a gunboat with cannon and rifled gun for blockade duty and two howitzers for shore bombardment.

== Built in Bath, Maine, in 1861 ==

The &quot;90-day gunboat&quot; was launched by Larrabee &amp; Allen of Bath, Maine, on 12 October 1861, and commissioned at Boston Navy Yard on 17 February 1862, with Lieutenant George Henry Preble in command.

== Civil War service ==

=== Assigned to the West Gulf blockade ===

&quot;Katahdin&quot; was assigned to the West Gulf Blockading Squadron to bolster its strength as Flag Officer David Farragut prepared for his epochal attack on New Orleans. After entering the Mississippi River early in April, &quot;Katahdin&quot; assisted Farragut in his unprecedented effort to work the squadron&#x27;s deep-draft, salt-water ships across the bar into the river.

On 16 April she moved up the river with the fleet to a position below Fort Jackson and Fort St. Philip guarding the approaches to New Orleans with over 100 guns. The next morning a Confederate steamer came down and fired at the fleet; but, when &quot;Katahdin&quot;&#x27;s guns answered briskly the Southern ship retired out of range. The following day the mortar flotilla opened an intensive bombardment of the forts which continued intermittently for the next six days until it reached a mighty crescendo in the small hours of 24 April as the Union fleet got underway and headed up the river toward the forts.

=== Racing past Forts Jackson and St. Philip ===

Half an hour later, when the Confederate guns opened fire, &quot;Katahdin&quot; steamed steadily ahead, replying with all her guns. Only two rounds struck the gunboat during the dash, one damaging the foremast and the other the smokestack.

After passing the forts and sailing beyond the range of their artillery, the Union ships anchored opposite Quarantine abreast a Confederate encampment which raised a white flag. During the morning she collected ordnance surrendered by Confederate troops ashore. The next day she proceeded up the river firing on and silencing Southern batteries on both banks. The afternoon, upon arriving New Orleans, Louisiana, with the fleet, she captured schooner &quot;John Gilpin&quot; with a cargo of cotton.

=== Lower Mississippi River operations ===

&quot;Katahdin&quot; operated in the vicinity of New Orleans until 16 May when she got underway up river to join the squadron, which had proceeded her to Vicksburg, Mississippi. While moving up stream, she gathered valuable information about conditions in the Mississippi valley; and, throughout Farragut&#x27;s operations above Vicksburg, she continued to perform reconnaissance missions as she convoyed vessels which supplied the force at Vicksburg from New Orleans.

In July, when Farragut withdrew from the Mississippi River to attend to his blockaders in the gulf, he left &quot;Katahdin&quot; in the river with &quot;Essex&quot;, &quot;Sumter&quot;, and &quot;Kineo&quot; to protect Army units in the area and to police the river. During much of this time &quot;Katahdin&quot; was stationed at Baton Rouge.

On 5 August Confederates attacked the Union encampment at Baton Rouge in force. The gunboats supported the badly outnumbered Northern soldiers enabling them to repulse the attack. Then they fired over the town into the Confederate camp, forcing them to withdraw out of range. The next morning &quot;Kineo&quot; and &quot;Katahdin&quot; guarded the right flank of the Union Army while &quot;Essex&quot; and &quot;Cayuga&quot; got underway to engage ironclad ram CSS &quot;Arkansas&quot;. However, as the Union warships were closing on &quot;Arkansas&quot;, the ram&#x27;s engines failed leaving her unable to flee or fight; she was set afire by her officers and abandoned before she blew up.

For the next fortnight the threat of an attack kept the ships constantly on the alert to protect the troops which depended upon naval fire support. Finally, upon orders from General Butler, the Union Army evacuated Baton Rouge 21 August. Just before embarking the troops, the gunboats beat off an attack on the Union pickets with rapid and heavy fire. &quot;Katahdin&quot; brought up the rear as the ships steamed to New Orleans, where they arrived the following morning.

=== Supporting Union troops at Donaldsonville ===

After repairs at New Orleans, the gunboat stood up the river 5 September with &quot;Kineo&quot; and &quot;Scioto&quot; scouring the banks for information. With &quot;Itasca&quot; she covered the landing of Army troops 22 September at Donaldsonville, Louisiana. While the expedition was ashore, the gunboats protected them; and, shortly before the soldiers reembarked, naval gunfire beat back a Southern attack which threatened to cut off the landing party. This support prevented annihilation of the landing party by vastly superior forces and enabled it to retreat to &quot;Laurel Hill&quot; for passage to safety in New Orleans.

=== Capturing a large herd of cattle ===

In the months that followed, the gunboats constantly patrolled the river to protect Union communications, to gather information on Confederate activity, and to cut the flow across the Mississippi River of food and men to Confederate armies in the East. With 3 other gunboats &quot;Katahdin&quot; intercepted a drove of some 1,500 cattle from Texas and loaded them on transports for passage to New Orleans. The value of this beef to the South can be attested by the fact that, four miles below Donaldsonville, about 3,000 infantrymen supported by nine field pieces struck back at the ships in a desperate attempt to recapture the cattle. The gunboats opened promptly and in about 20 minute drove the Confederates from their position.

The months that followed were a period of constant stress and peril for the gunboats. &quot;We are constantly under fire ... as we pass up and down the river,&quot; Lt. Roe, the commanding officer of &quot;Katahdin&quot;, reported.

Our fighting is a savage Indian warfare. The troops and guns are concealed, and watch for us as we pass along and fire and flee.

=== Blockading the Texas coast ===

In January 1863 &quot;Katahdin&quot; was ordered to reinforce the blockade off Galveston, Texas after that port had been recaptured by the Confederacy on New Year&#x27;s Day. While serving in the Gulf off the Texas coast, &quot;Katahdin&quot; and &quot;Owasco&quot;&#x27; chased, captured, and burned blockade running schooner &quot;Hanover&quot; 10 May 1863. She captured schooner &quot;Excelsior&quot; 13 July off San Luis Pass, Texas.

Thereafter &quot;Katahdin&quot; continued to serve in the blockade of the Texas coast, cutting off supplies sorely needed by the Confederates. On 30 April 1864 she chased the former revenue cutter &quot;Harriet Lane&quot; and steamer &quot;Alice&quot; as they escaped from Galveston; but, after a brisk and lengthy race, &quot;Katahdin&quot; was finally outdistanced. She was more successful 31 October when the gunboat overtook &quot;Albert Edward&quot; as the British schooner tried to slip out of the same port with a cargo of cotton.

== Post-war decommissioning ==

After the Confederate collapse in April 1865, the veteran gunboat returned north and decommissioned 14 July 1865. &quot;Katahdin&quot; was sold at New York City 30 November and documented as &quot;Juno&quot; 20 October 1866.

<text>Uglich () is a historic town in Yaroslavl Oblast, Russia, located on the Volga River. Population: 

==History==
The city was first documented in 1148 as &quot;Ugliche Pole&quot; (&quot;Corner Field&quot;). The town&#x27;s name is thought to allude to the nearby turn in the Volga River, and is derived from the Russian word &quot;ugol&quot; (a corner, a nook).

=== Principality of Uglich ===
From 1218 until 1328, Uglich was the seat of a small princedom. At that time, the local princes sold their rights to the great prince of Moscow. Uglich was a border town of the Grand Duchy of Moscow, and it was burned several times in conflicts by Lithuanians, Tatars, and the grand prince of Tver.

Grand Duke Ivan III of Moscow gave the town in 1462 to his younger brother Andrey Bolshoy (Andrey the Great). During Andrey&#x27;s reign, the town was expanded and the first stone buildings were constructed. Particularly notable were the cathedral (rebuilt in 1713), the Intercession Monastery (destroyed by the Bolsheviks in the early 20th century as part of the Uglich water reservoir), and the red-brick palace of the prince (completed in 1481 and still standing).

===Reign of Ivan the Terrible===
During the reign of Ivan the Terrible, the town passed to his only brother, Yury. Local inhabitants helped the Tsar capture the city of Kazan by building a wooden fortress that was transported via the Volga all the way to Kazan. Throughout the 16th century, Uglich prospered both politically and economically, but thereafter its fortunes began to decline.

===Death of Tsarevich Dmitry===
After Ivan&#x27;s death, his youngest son Dmitry Ivanovich was banished to Uglich in 1584. The most well-known event in the town&#x27;s history took place on May 15, 1591, when the 10-year-old boy was found dead with his throat cut in the palace courtyard. Suspicion immediately fell on the tsar&#x27;s chief advisor, Boris Godunov. Official investigators concluded, however, that Dimitriy&#x27;s death was an accident. They cut a &quot;tongue&quot; from the cathedral bell that rang the news of Dimitriy&#x27;s death and &quot;exiled&quot; it to Siberia.

As Dimitry was the last scion of the ancient Rurik Dynasty, his death precipitated the dynastic and political crisis known as the Time of Troubles. People readily believed that Dmitry was alive and supported several False Dmitrys (see False Dmitry I, False Dmitry II, False Dmitry III), who each tried to grab the Muscovite throne. During the Time of Troubles, Poles besieged the Alexeievsky and Uleima monasteries and burned them down, killing all the populace who had sought refuge inside.

The Romanov Tsars quickly arranged to canonize the martyred Tsesarevich and to designate Uglich as a place of pilgrimage. On the spot where Dimitry was thought to have been murdered, the city in 1690 built a small Church of St. Demetrios on the Blood. Its red walls and blue domes are visible as travelers go north on the Volga. The palace where the prince lived was turned into a museum. The image of Tsesarevich with a knife in his hand was adopted as the town&#x27;s coat of arms.

===Later history===
In the first third of the 18th century, the kremlin cathedral and its remarkable bell tower were demolished and rebuilt. Other 18th-century landmarks include the Smolenskaya, Korsunskaya, Kazanskaya and Bogoyavlenskaya churches. The most important edifice of the 19th century is the cathedral of the Theophany Convent, consecrated in 1853.
Infrastructure improvements included a railway station, connecting residents to transportation via other routes than the river. A watch manufacturing plant operated in the 20th-century town, making Chaika watches; this has since closed. A hydroelectric power station was built under Stalin&#x27;s reign to generate power from the Volga. But development of the dam and Uglich Reservoir resulted in severe flooding of the town&#x27;s outskirts. In November 2008 the Nexans cable mill opened.

==Administrative and municipal status==
Within the framework of administrative divisions, Uglich serves as the administrative center of Uglichsky District, although it is independent of it. As an administrative division, it is incorporated separately as the &quot;town of oblast significance of Uglich&quot;—an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the districts. As a municipal division, the town of oblast significance of Uglich is incorporated within Uglichsky Municipal District as Uglich Urban Settlement.

==Architecture==
Apart from the kremlin, the city center features other examples of historic Russian architecture. Particularly notable are the Alexeievsky and Resurrection monasteries. The Assumption three-tented church (1628) of the Alexeyevsky Monastery is considered a gem of Russian medieval architecture. The common people said this church was &quot;Marvelous&quot;, and that qualifier became part of its official name. Located nearby is the more conventional Church of St. John the Baptist (1681).

Closer to the bank of the Volga is the Resurrection Monastery with a huge cathedral, refectory, belfry, and summer church. All these buildings stand in a row and date to 1674–77. Opposite the monastery is the graceful Church of the Nativity of St. John the Baptist. It was built in 1689-90 by a local merchant to commemorate the spot where his son had drowned.

More historic architecture may be seen in the vicinity of Uglich, including the 17th-century Uleima Monastery and a fine church in Divnogorye.

<doc id="459675" wikidata="Q4078458" url="?curid=459675" title="Baron Stafford">
<text>Baron Stafford, referring to the town of Stafford, is a title that has been created several times in the Peerage of England. In the 14th century, the barons of the first creation were made earls. Those of the fifth creation, in the 17th century, became first viscounts and then earls. Since 1913, the title has been held by the Fitzherbert family.

==History of the title==
The first creation was by writ in 1299 for Edmond de Stafford. His successor, the second baron, was made &quot;Earl of Stafford&quot; in 1351, and the sixth earl was made &quot;Duke of Buckingham&quot; in 1444. The sixth earl was the son of Anne of Gloucester, Countess of Buckingham, daughter of Thomas of Woodstock, Earl of Buckingham (later Duke of Gloucester), youngest son of King Edward III of England. Stafford was an important supporter of the House of Lancaster in the Wars of the Roses, and was killed at the Battle of Northampton in July 1460. The 1st Duke of Buckingham was succeeded in his titles by his grandson Henry, who aided Richard III in his claiming the throne in 1483 (Edward IV of England&#x27;s marriage to Elizabeth Woodville having been declared null and void and Edward&#x27;s sons illegitimate by Act of Parliament Titulus Regius), but who then led a revolt against Richard. He was executed for treason in 1483 and his titles were declared forfeit. His son Edward was restored as 3rd Duke upon Henry VII&#x27;s accession to the throne in 1485, but he was ultimately executed in 1521 due to his opposition to Cardinal Thomas Wolsey, Henry VIII&#x27;s chief advisor. When he was executed for treason, his titles were declared forfeit.

The second creation, again by writ, was for Richard Stafford, who was created Baron Stafford of Clifton. At the death of the fourth baron, that title fell into abeyance.

The third creation was in 1411 for Sir Hugh Stafford, a son of Hugh Stafford, 2nd Earl of Stafford; he had married Elizabeth Bourchier, 4th Baroness Bourchier (c. 1399 – 1433), only child and sole heiress of Bartholomew Bourchier, 3rd Baron Bourchier (d.1409). Hugh was summoned to Parliament in lieu of his wife, as Baron Stafford. At his death, this title became extinct since he left no heirs.

The fourth creation was in 1547 for Henry Stafford. In 1558, his title was recognized as carrying precedence from 1299, so he is in fact the 10th Baron.

The fifth creation of the title came in 1640 in favour of William Howard. He was the third and youngest son of Thomas Howard, 21st Earl of Arundel, grandson of Thomas Howard, 4th Duke of Norfolk (see the Duke of Norfolk). He married Mary Stafford, only sister of Henry Stafford, 5th Baron de Stafford (of the 1547 creation, which is considered to have become extinct upon the death of Mary&#x27;s uncle, the sixth Baron, sometime around 1640). On 12 September 1640 William Howard was created Baron Stafford, with remainder, in default of heirs male of the body, to the heirs of his body by his wife Mary and with the precedence of the 1547 barony. The same day Mary was made Baroness Stafford in her own right. This title was for life only. Two months later, on 11 November, William Howard was created Viscount Stafford, with remainder to his issue male.

Lord Stafford later became implicated in the Titus Oates plot, where fabricated evidence was used to prove an alleged Catholic plot against Charles II. He was attainted in 1678, with his titles forfeited. In 1680, he was impeached by the House of Commons and executed. After the accession of the Catholic James II, Mary, Baroness Stafford, was created Countess of Stafford for life in 1688. On the same day, her eldest son by Lord Stafford, Henry Stafford-Howard, was created Earl of Stafford, with remainder to his brothers John and Francis. However, he was not allowed to succeed in the barony or viscountcy of Stafford as these titles were still under attainder.

Henry was succeeded according to the special remainder by his nephew, the second Earl (the eldest son of John). He was succeeded by his son, the third Earl. When he died childless, the title passed to his uncle, the fourth Earl. He was also childless and on his death in 1762 the earldom became extinct (the viscountcy of Stafford also formally became extinct, although the title was then under attainder). The claim to the barony of Stafford passed to the late Earl&#x27;s niece, Anastasia, the &quot;de jure&quot; sixth Baroness Stafford. She was the daughter of the second Earl of Stafford. However, Anastasia was childless and on her death in 1807 the claim passed to her first cousin once removed, Sir William Jerningham, 6th Baronet, of Cossey (see Jerningham Baronets for earlier history of this title). He was the son of Sir George Jerningham, 5th Baronet, and his wife Mary, Lady Jerningham, only daughter of Mary Plowden, sister of the fourth Earl of Stafford.

Jerningham died in 1809, when the claim passed to his son Sir George William Jerningham, 7th Baronet. He petitioned the House of Lords for a reversal of the attainder and for a writ of summons of Parliament. In 1824 the attainder of the first Baron was completely reversed, and on 6 July 1825, the House of Lords decided that Jerningham had been successful in his claim to the barony. He was summoned to Parliament the same year as the eighth Baron Stafford. In 1826 he assumed by Royal licence the additional surname and arms of Stafford. He was succeeded by his eldest son, the ninth Baron. He had earlier represented Pontefract in the House of Commons. When he died the titles passed to his nephew, the tenth Baron, and then to the latter&#x27;s brother, the eleventh Baron. On the eleventh Baron&#x27;s death in 1913 the barony and baronetcy separated. The baronetcy was passed on to Sir Henry William Stafford Jerningham, 11th Baronet (on whose death in 1935 the title became extinct; see Jerningham Baronets).

The barony, which could be inherited through female lines, was passed on to the late Baron&#x27;s nephew Francis Edward Fitzherbert, the twelfth Baron. He was the son of Emily Charlotte (sister of both the tenth and eleventh Baron) and her husband, Basil Thomas Fitzherbert. He assumed in 1913 by Royal licence the additional surname and arms of Stafford. He was succeeded by his younger brother, the thirteenth Baron. He was an admiral in the Royal Navy. On his death, the title passed to his nephew, the fourteenth Baron. , the barony is held by the latter&#x27;s son, the fifteenth Baron, who succeeded his father in 1986.

The seat of the Jerningham family, who held the title from 1825 to 1913, was Costessey Hall in Norfolk (demolished in 1925). The seat of the Fitzherbert family is Swynnerton Hall in Swynnerton, near Stone, Staffordshire.

Not to be confused with the title of Marquess of Stafford (created in 1786 in the Peerage of Great Britain), since 1833 the courtesy title for the heir of the Duke of Sutherland.

<text>A warning sign is a type of sign which indicates a potential hazard, obstacle, or condition requiring special attention. Some are traffic signs that indicate hazards on roads that may not be readily apparent to a driver.

While warning traffic sign designs vary, they usually take the shape of an equilateral triangle with a white background and thick red border. In the People&#x27;s Republic of China (excluding Macau and Hong Kong) and North Korea, they appear with a black border and a yellow background. In Sweden, Greece, Finland, Iceland, Poland, Cuba, Nigeria, South Korea and Vietnam, they have a red border with an amber background. The polar bear warning sign in Svalbard recently changed from displaying a black bear on white background to a white bear on black background (both signs are triangular with a red border). Some countries (like France, Norway and Spain) that normally use a white background have adopted an orange or amber background for road work or construction signs.

Warning signs in some countries have a diamond shape in place of the standard triangular shape. In the United States, Canada, Mexico, Australia, Japan, Liberia, Sri Lanka, New Zealand, most of Central and South America, some countries of Southeast Asia, and also Ireland (diverging from the standards of the rest of Europe) warning signs are black on a yellow background and usually diamond-shaped, while temporary signs (which are typically construction signs) are black on an orange background. Some other countries, like Argentina and Taiwan, use a combination of triangle and diamond-shaped warning signs.

The warning signs usually contain a symbol. In Europe they are based on the UNECE Vienna Convention on Road Signs and Signals. In the United States they are based on the MUTCD standard and often contain text only.

== History ==
Some of the first roadside signs—ancient milestones—merely gave distance measures. Hazard warnings were rare though occasional specimens appeared, such as the specific warning about horse-drawn vehicles backing up which was carved in stone in Lisbon&#x27;s Alfama neighborhood in 1686. The early signs did not have high-contrast lettering and their messages might have been easily overlooked. Signs were written in the local language (); symbolic signs, though long used on certain tradesmen&#x27;s signs (like the pawnbrokers&#x27; tri-ball symbol) were to be used for traffic only much later in history.

Complex signage systems emerged with the appearance of motorcars. In 1908 the automobile association in West London erected some warning signs. In 1909, nine European governments agreed on the use of four pictorial symbols, indicating &quot;bump&quot;, &quot;curve&quot;, &quot;intersection&quot;, and &quot;railroad crossing&quot;. The intensive work on international road signs that took place between 1926 and 1949 eventually led to the development of the European road sign system.

As the 20th century progressed, and traffic volume and vehicle speeds increased, so did the importance of road sign visibility. Earlier flat-painted signs gave way to , which in turn gave way to button copy signs— round retroreflective &quot;buttons&quot; helped to achieve greater night visibility. Flat metal signs reappeared in the 1980s with the widespread use of surfaces covered with retroflective sheeting materials like Scotchlite.

In Europe, 1968 Vienna Convention on Road Signs and Signals (which became effective in 1978) tried, among other things, to standardize important signs. After the fall of the Iron Curtain and greater ease of country-to-country driving in the EU, European countries moved toward lessening the regional differences in warning signs.

In modern regulations, U.S. warning signs are classified as &quot;Series W&quot; signs, starting with the W1 Series (curves and turns) and ending with the W25 Series (concerning extended green traffic lights). Some U.S. warning signs are without category while others like the warning stripes at tunnel portals or plain red &quot;End of Roadway&quot; signs are classified as Object Markers (OM Series). In the U.S., &quot;Stop&quot; and speed limit signs fall under the R Series (Regulatory). Modern U.S. signs are widely standardized; unless they are antique holdovers from an earlier era, oddities like a yellow &quot;Stop&quot; sign or a red &quot;Slippery When Wet&quot; sign would typically appear only on private property—perhaps at a hospital campus or in a shopping mall parking lot.

Street sign theft by pranksters, souvenir hunters, and scrappers has become problematic: removal of warning signs costs municipalities money to replace lost signs, and can contribute to traffic collisions. Some authorities affix theft-deterrence stickers to the back sides of signs. Some jurisdictions have criminalized unauthorized possession of road signs or have outlawed their resale to scrap metal dealers. In some cases, thieves whose sign-removal lead to road fatalities have been charged with manslaughter. Artistically inclined vandals sometimes paint additional details onto warning signs: a beer bottle, a handgun, or a boom box added to the outstretched hand of the &quot;Pedestrian Crossing&quot; person, for example.

== Modern traffic warning sign shapes and colors ==
Warning signs can indicate any potential hazard, obstacle or condition requiring special attention. Some of the most common warning signs are the following.

=== General caution ===

General warning signs are used in instances in which the particular hazard, obstacle or condition is not covered by a standard sign. In Europe, they usually comprise an exclamation mark on the standard triangular sign (Unicode ) with an auxiliary sign below in the local language identifying the hazard, obstacle or condition. In Sweden, the general warning sign has only a vertical line instead of exclamation mark; this model was used also in many other European countries until the 1990s. In the United States and other countries using diamond-shaped signs, the explanatory language is often written directly on the diamond-shaped sign, although it may contain only a general warning such as &quot;Caution&quot;, and pictograms may also be used.

=== Obstacles ===
Warning signs can be placed in advance of, next to or on a specific obstacle. Obstacles such as railway level crossings may have several warning signs beforehand, while bridge ramparts typically have reflective signs placed directly on them on either side. These signs can be specific to the shape requirements of the obstacle, for example, bridge rampart signs are often tall and skinny so as not to intrude into the lane.

=== Curves and corners ===

These signs indicate that dangerous or unexpected bends in the road are ahead. Signs typically indicate whether the curves are to the right or to the left, the angle of the curve and whether it is one curve or a series of curves.

==== Chevrons and arrows ====
Chevron-shaped symbols or arrows on rectangular signs may be placed at the actual location of the bend or curve to further mark the location of the curve and to assist in the negotiation of the curve. They may also be used to indicate &quot;merge&quot; with other traffic, as for an on-ramp of a limited-access highway.
&lt;br&gt;
An unusual occurrence of the rectangular arrow sign appears on the eastbound approach to Dead Man&#x27;s Curve in Cleveland, Ohio, US, a curve so sharp that in places an arrow&#x27;s stem is printed on one sign and the arrow&#x27;s point is printed on another larger sign further down the road; from the driver&#x27;s perspective at a distance, the two signs visually blend together to form one large arrow image.

=== Steep hills ===
Truck drivers will need to pay attention to &quot;Steep grade&quot; warnings (or &quot;Down grade, use lower gear&quot;), sometimes posted with the percent grade (e.g., 12%). Steep hills may also feature &quot;Runaway truck escape&quot; or &quot;Emergency stop&quot; areas with corresponding signs. The UK has a sign warning of &quot;Adverse camber&quot; on a curve.

=== Lane starts and ends ===
These signs indicate when a multilane highway is being narrowed, when a passing lane is ending, or where the road is widening or a passing lane starting. Another type of sign is used to indicate central &quot;two-way&quot; left turning lane in center of roadway. Warning signs may also warn of &quot;Highway ends&quot;, where the road changes class or type.

=== Merge to stay with through traffic ===
In the United States and Canada, there is special signage for lanes that are about to exit, so that drivers who wish to remain on the main road have adequate time to merge. Such lanes are sometimes indicated by special striping (&quot;alligator stripes&quot;) and the sign, &quot;Through Traffic Merge Left&quot; (or right). On freeways, the green directions sign for the exit ramp may have the additional notation, &quot;Exit Only&quot;, and should have black letters on a yellow background for emphasis.

=== Bridges ===

These signs are used where traffic may be constricted to a narrow bridge, or where the bridge may have a movable span closed to vehicles while boats pass (e.g., drawbridge). They may also be used for underpass to indicate low overhead clearance.

=== Tunnels ===
These signs are used to indicate tunnels, where lights are usually required, and a general change in the light level. May also indicate low ceiling clearance. Truck drivers should also watch for prohibited cargo signs (e.g., propane) upon approach to tunnels.

=== Road conditions ===
Warns road users of severe road conditions (&quot;Icy road&quot;, &quot;Bump&quot;, etc). Also &quot;Loose gravel&quot;, &quot;Soft shoulder&quot;, &quot;Speed hump&quot;, and &quot;Watch for ice&quot;.

=== Falling rocks ===
These signs may be used to indicate the hazards of fallen or falling rocks on the road ahead. They are usually pictographs, but may also include wording, such as &quot;falling rocks&quot;. In Italy the words may be &quot; or &quot;; in France &quot;&quot;; in Mexico &quot;s&quot;.

=== Pedestrian crossings ===
These signs are used to warn drivers of people walking in the street. They may also be used to warn of children playing, playgrounds, bicycle area, deaf child, blind pedestrians, and thickly settled zones where pedestrians may enter the road.

In California, United States near the Mexican border, there were warning signs showing a running family. This was to warn motorists to look out for illegal immigrants who try to escape authorities by running through freeway traffic. The symbol was created by California Department of Transportation employee John Hood in the late 1980s.

=== Schools ===
These signs mark school zones (in which lower speed limits may be in place), student crossings, crossing guards or signals ahead. In the U.S. and Canada, pentagon-shaped signs are used in place of the usual diamond-shaped signs. The shape of the U.S. school zone resembles a one-room schoolhouse and is the only U.S. sign shaped this way. Some Canadian provinces use an identical sign.

=== Bicycles ===
Bicycle crossing signs warn that bicycles will cross at their location.

=== Animals crossing the roadway ===

These signs warn of animals that may stray onto the road. They can be either wild (as with deer or moose) or farm animals (as with cows or ducks). In the United States, a &quot;share the road&quot; plaque is sometimes placed below these warning signs when used in this manner.

=== Unusual vehicles in roadway ===

These signs are found where road users can encounter slow, large or non-typical vehicles such as forklifts, handcarts and military vehicles. They are more common around quarries, airports, industrial zones, military installations and rural areas.

=== Road work or construction ===
These signs are often temporary in nature and used to indicate road work (construction), poor roads, or temporary conditions ahead on the road including flagmen, uneven pavement, etc. (Note that some &quot;high water&quot; signs are posted to alert drivers of a flood-prone area and do not actually mean that there is a flooded section of road ahead.) In France, Italy, Spain, Norway etc., warning (and speed limit) signs connected with road work have a yellow background in place of the usual white background on signs. In North America and Ireland, signs connected with road work have an orange background.

=== Traffic signals ===
These warning signs indicate that traffic lights are ahead, and are often used when it is difficult to see that a traffic light may already be showing red, to warn a driver to prepare to slow down. They may be supplemented with flashing light or lighted sign when light is red or turning red. Some countries also have signs warning of signals for ramp meters, fire stations, and airfields.

=== Intersections ===

These signs warn of road crossings at crossroads, T-intersections, roundabouts, or Y-intersections. They may also indicate &quot;hidden driveway&quot; intersecting the road ahead. (Compare with bridges, overpasses, viaducts).

=== Warning signs for regulatory signs ===


Like for traffic signals, some &quot;stop&quot; or &quot;yield&quot; signs may require additional warning or reminder, especially in dense areas or where the sign has been added recently.

=== Oncoming traffic ===
These signs may be used to warn people of oncoming traffic; shown when a motorway becomes a dual carriageway or a normal road without a central reservation or median.

=== Level crossing (railway crossing) ===
These signs are used to warn of level crossings ahead. In most countries, a red triangle warning sign is used, with various pictograms for unguarded crossings, crossings with manual gates, and automatic level crossings. In most of Europe, an old-style gate is used for a crossing with gates, and a steam locomotive for a crossing without gates. Germany uses an electric train. Similar pictograms are also used in Ireland, albeit on an amber diamond sign. In the United States the warning of all types of railway crossings is made using a circular yellow sign. The actual crossing is also marked with crossed &quot;railroad crossing&quot; crossbuck signs (stop, look, listen) and possibly lights, bells, and barriers.

=== Low flying aircraft ===
A warning sign with the image of an aircraft in the middle of it indicates an airport or airfield, where drivers should be prepared for low-flying aircraft.

=== Crosswinds or side winds ===
Flying socks, as indicated in Poland by a windsock on red triangle or yellow diamond signs, indicate locations where a strong side wind may cause the trajectory of the moving vehicle to change drastically, perhaps even &quot;flying&quot; across lanes, causing an accident.

=== Roads with one entry point ===
Roadways that only have one entry/exit point - &quot;dead end&quot;, &quot;not a through street&quot; or &quot;no outlet&quot;.

=== End of roadway ===

Signs indicating the end point of a roadway.

=== Fire stations ===
These signs warn of approach to where firefighters may be entering the road with fire engines or other emergency apparatus, where other drivers will have to stop and wait until they pass.

== Traffic warning signs with lights ==
Some warning signs have flashing lights to alert drivers of conditions ahead or remind drivers to slow down. In Britain, they are called &quot;warning lights&quot;. Flashing lights can be dangerous for people with certain forms of epilepsy and/or sensory processing disorder.
