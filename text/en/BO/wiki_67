<text>A siphon (; also spelled syphon) is any of a wide variety of devices that involve the flow of liquids through tubes. In a narrower sense, the word refers particularly to a tube in an inverted &quot;U&quot; shape, which causes a liquid to flow upward, above the surface of a reservoir, with no pump, but powered by the fall of the liquid as it flows down the tube under the pull of gravity, then discharging at a level lower than the surface of the reservoir from which it came.

There are two leading theories about how siphons cause liquid to flow uphill, against gravity, without being pumped, and powered only by gravity. The traditional theory for centuries was that gravity pulling the liquid down on the exit side of the siphon resulted in reduced pressure at the top of the siphon. Then atmospheric pressure was able to push the liquid from the upper reservoir, up into the reduced pressure at the top of the siphon, like in a barometer or drinking straw, and then over. However, it has been demonstrated that siphons can operate in a vacuum and to heights exceeding the barometric height of the liquid. Consequently, the cohesion tension theory of siphon operation has been advocated, where the liquid is pulled over the siphon in a way similar to the chain fountain. It need not be one theory or the other that is correct, but rather both theories may be correct in different circumstances of ambient pressure. The atmospheric pressure with gravity theory cannot explain siphons in vacuum, where there is no significant atmospheric pressure. But the cohesion tension with gravity theory cannot explain gas siphons, siphons working despite bubbles, and the flying droplet siphon, where gases do not exert significant pulling forces, and liquids not in contact cannot exert a cohesive tension force.

All known published theories in modern times recognize Bernoulli&#x27;s equation as a decent approximation to idealized, friction-free siphon operation.

==History==

Egyptian reliefs from 1500 BC depict siphons used to extract liquids from large storage jars.

Physical evidence for the use of siphons by Greeks are the Justice cup of Pythagoras in Samos in the 6th century BC and usage by Greek engineers in the 3rd century BC at Pergamon.

Hero of Alexandria wrote extensively about siphons in the treatise &quot;Pneumatica&quot;.

The Banu Musa brothers of 9th-century Baghdad invented a double-concentric siphon, which they described in their &quot;Book of Ingenious Devices&quot;. The edition edited by Hill includes an analysis of the double-concentric siphon.

Siphons were studied further in the 17th century, in the context of suction pumps (and the recently developed vacuum pumps), particularly with an eye to understanding the maximum height of pumps (and siphons) and the apparent vacuum at the top of early barometers. This was initially explained by Galileo Galilei via the theory of (&quot;nature abhors a vacuum&quot;), which dates to Aristotle, and which Galileo restated as , but this was subsequently disproved by later workers, notably Evangelista Torricelli and Blaise Pascal – see barometer: history.

==Theory==
A practical siphon, operating at typical atmospheric pressures and tube heights, works because gravity pulling down on the taller column of liquid leaves reduced pressure at the top of the siphon (formally, hydrostatic pressure when the liquid is not moving). This reduced pressure at the top means gravity pulling down on the shorter column of liquid is not sufficient to keep the liquid stationary against the atmospheric pressure pushing it up into the reduced-pressure zone at the top of the siphon. So the liquid flows from the higher-pressure area of the upper reservoir up to the lower-pressure zone at the top of the siphon, over the top, and then, with the help of gravity and a taller column of liquid, down to the higher-pressure zone at the exit.
The chain model is a useful but not completely accurate conceptual model of a siphon. The chain model helps to understand how a siphon can cause liquid to flow uphill, powered only by the downward force of gravity. A siphon can sometimes be thought of like a chain hanging over a pulley, with one end of the chain piled on a higher surface than the other. Since the length of chain on the shorter side is lighter than the length of chain on the taller side, the heavier chain on the taller side will move down and pull up the chain on the lighter side. Similar to a siphon, the chain model is obviously just powered by gravity acting on the heavier side, and there is clearly no violation of conservation of energy, because the chain is ultimately just moving from a higher to a lower location, as the liquid does in a siphon.

There are a number of problems with the chain model of a siphon, and understanding these differences helps to explain the actual workings of siphons. First, unlike in the chain model of the siphon, it is not actually the &quot;weight&quot; on the taller side compared to the shorter side that matters. Rather it is the difference in &quot;height&quot; from the reservoir surfaces to the top of the siphon, that determines the balance of &quot;pressure&quot;. For example, if the tube from the upper reservoir to the top of the siphon has a much larger diameter than the taller section of tube from the lower reservoir to the top of the siphon, the shorter upper section of the siphon may have a much larger weight of liquid in it, and yet the lighter volume of liquid in the down tube can pull liquid up the fatter up tube, and the siphon can function normally.

Another difference is that under most practical circumstances, dissolved gases, vapor pressure, and (sometimes) lack of adhesion with tube walls, conspire to render the tensile strength within the liquid ineffective for siphoning. Thus, unlike a chain, which has significant tensile strength, liquids usually have little tensile strength under typical siphon conditions, and therefore the liquid on the rising side cannot be pulled up in the way the chain is pulled up on the rising side.

An occasional misunderstanding of siphons is that they rely on the tensile strength of the liquid to pull the liquid up and over the rise. While water has been found to have a significant tensile strength in some experiments (such as with the z-tube), and siphons in vacuum rely on such cohesion, common siphons can easily be demonstrated to need no liquid tensile strength at all to function. Furthermore, since common siphons operate at positive pressures throughout the siphon, there is no contribution from liquid tensile strength, because the molecules are actually repelling each other in order to resist the pressure, rather than pulling on each other.
To demonstrate, the longer lower leg of a common siphon can be plugged at the bottom and filled almost to the crest with liquid as in the figure, leaving the top and the shorter upper leg completely dry and containing only air. When the plug is removed and the liquid in the longer lower leg is allowed to fall, the liquid in the upper reservoir will then typically sweep the air bubble down and out of the tube. The apparatus will then continue to operate as a normal siphon. As there is no contact between the liquid on either side of the siphon at the beginning of this experiment, there can be no cohesion between the liquid molecules to pull the liquid over the rise. It has been suggested by advocates of the liquid tensile strength theory, that the air start siphon only demonstrates the effect as the siphon starts, but that the situation changes after the bubble is swept out and the siphon achieves steady flow. But a similar effect can be seen in the flying-droplet siphon (see above). The flying-droplet siphon works continuously without liquid tensile strength pulling the liquid up.
The siphon in the video demonstration operated steadily for more than 28 minutes until the upper reservoir was empty. Another simple demonstration that liquid tensile strength is not needed in the siphon is to simply introduce a bubble into the siphon during operation. The bubble can be large enough to entirely disconnect the liquids in the tube before and after the bubble, defeating any liquid tensile strength, and yet if the bubble is not too big, the siphon will continue to operate with little change as it sweeps the bubble out.

Another common misconception about siphons is that because the atmospheric pressure is virtually identical at the entrance and exit, the atmospheric pressure cancels, and therefore atmospheric pressure cannot be pushing the liquid up the siphon. But equal and opposite forces may not completely cancel if there is an intervening force that counters some or all of one of the forces. In the siphon, the atmospheric pressure at the entrance and exit are both lessened by the force of gravity pulling down the liquid in each tube, but the pressure on the down side is lessened more by the taller column of liquid on the down side. In effect, the atmospheric pressure coming up the down side does not entirely &quot;make it&quot; to the top to cancel all of the atmospheric pressure pushing up the up side. This effect can be seen more easily in the example of two carts being pushed up opposite sides of a hill. As shown in the diagram, even though the person on the left seems to have his push canceled entirely by the equal and opposite push from the person on the right, the person on the left&#x27;s seemingly canceled push is still the source of the force to push the left cart up.
In some situations siphons do function in the absence of atmospheric pressure and due to tensile strength – see vacuum siphons – and in these situations the chain model can be instructive. Further, in other settings water transport does occur due to tension, most significantly in transpirational pull in the xylem of vascular plants. Water and other liquids may seem to have no tensile strength because when a handful is scooped up and pulled on, the liquids narrow and pull apart effortlessly. But liquid tensile strength in a siphon is possible when the liquid adheres to the tube walls and thereby resists narrowing. Any contamination on the tube walls, such as grease or air bubbles, or other minor influences such as turbulence or vibration, can cause the liquid to detach from the walls and lose all tensile strength.

In more detail, one can look at how the hydrostatic pressure varies through a static siphon, considering in turn the vertical tube from the top reservoir, the vertical tube from the bottom reservoir, and the horizontal tube connecting them (assuming a U-shape). At liquid level in the top reservoir, the liquid is under atmospheric pressure, and as one goes up the siphon, the hydrostatic pressure decreases (under vertical pressure variation), since the weight of atmospheric pressure pushing the water up is counterbalanced by the column of water in the siphon pushing down (until one reaches the maximal height of a barometer/siphon, at which point the liquid cannot be pushed higher) – the hydrostatic pressure at the top of the tube is then lower than atmospheric pressure by an amount proportional to the height of the tube. Doing the same analysis on the tube rising from the lower reservoir yields the pressure at the top of that (vertical) tube; this pressure is lower because the tube is longer (there is more water pushing down), and requires that the lower reservoir is lower than the upper reservoir, or more generally that the discharge outlet simply be lower than the surface of the upper reservoir. Considering now the horizontal tube connecting them, one sees that the pressure at the top of the tube from the top reservoir is higher (since less water is being lifted), while the pressure at the top of the tube from the bottom reservoir is lower (since more water is being lifted), and since liquids move from high pressure to low pressure, the liquid flows across the horizontal tube from the top basin to the bottom basin. The liquid is under positive pressure (compression) throughout the tube, not tension.

Bernoulli&#x27;s equation is considered in the scientific literature to be a fair approximation to the operation of the siphon. In non-ideal fluids, compressibility, tensile strength and other characteristics of the working fluid (or multiple fluids) complicate Bernoulli&#x27;s equation.

Once started, a siphon requires no additional energy to keep the liquid flowing up and out of the reservoir. The siphon will draw liquid out of the reservoir until the level falls below the intake, allowing air or other surrounding gas to break the siphon, or until the outlet of the siphon equals the level of the reservoir, whichever comes first.

In addition to atmospheric pressure, the density of the liquid, and gravity, the maximal height of the crest in practical siphons is limited by the vapour pressure of the liquid. When the pressure within the liquid drops to below the liquid&#x27;s vapor pressure, tiny vapor bubbles can begin to form at the high point, and the siphon effect will end. This effect depends on how efficiently the liquid can nucleate bubbles; in the absence of impurities or rough surfaces to act as easy nucleation sites for bubbles, siphons can temporarily exceed their standard maximal height during the extended time it takes bubbles to nucleate. One siphon of degassed water was demonstrated to for an extended period of time and other controlled experiments to . For water at standard atmospheric pressure, the maximal siphon height is approximately ; for mercury it is , which is the definition of standard pressure. This equals the maximal height of a suction pump, which operates by the same principle. The ratio of heights (about 13.6) equals the ratio of densities of water and mercury (at a given temperature), since the column of water (resp. mercury) is balancing with the column of air yielding atmospheric pressure, and indeed maximal height is (neglecting vapor pressure and velocity of liquid) inversely proportional to density of liquid.

==Modern research into the operation of the siphon==
In 1948, Malcolm Nokes investigated siphons working in both air pressure and in a partial vacuum; for siphons in vacuum he concluded: &quot;The gravitational force on the column of liquid in the downtake tube less the gravitational force in the uptake tube causes the liquid to move. The liquid is therefore in tension and sustains a longitudinal strain which, in the absence of disturbing factors, is insufficient to break the column of liquid&quot;. But for siphons of small uptake height working at atmospheric pressure, he wrote: &quot;... the tension of the liquid column is neutralized and &quot;reversed&quot; by the compressive effect of the atmosphere on the opposite ends of the liquid column.&quot;

Potter and Barnes at the University of Edinburgh revisited siphons in 1971. They re-examined the theories of the siphon and ran experiments on siphons in air pressure. They concluded: &quot;By now it should be clear that, despite a wealth of tradition, the basic mechanism of a siphon does not depend upon atmospheric pressure.&quot;

Gravity, pressure and molecular cohesion were the focus of work in 2010 by Hughes at the Queensland University of Technology. He used siphons at air pressure and his conclusion was: &quot;The flow of water out of the bottom of a siphon depends on the difference in height between the inflow and outflow, and therefore cannot be dependent on atmospheric pressure…&quot;
Hughes did further work on siphons at air pressure in 2011 and concluded: &quot;The experiments described above demonstrate that ordinary siphons at atmospheric pressure operate through gravity and not atmospheric pressure&quot;.

The father and son researchers Ramette and Ramette successfully siphoned carbon dioxide under air pressure in 2011 and concluded that molecular cohesion is not required for the operation of a siphon, but: &quot;The basic explanation of siphon action is that, once the tube is filled, the flow is initiated by the greater pull of gravity on the fluid on the longer side compared with that on the short side. This creates a pressure drop throughout the siphon tube, in the same sense that &#x27;sucking&#x27; on a straw reduces the pressure along its length all the way to the intake point. The ambient atmospheric pressure at the intake point responds to the reduced pressure by forcing the fluid upwards, sustaining the flow, just as in a steadily sucked straw in a milkshake.&quot;

Again in 2011, Richert and Binder (at the University of Hawaii) examined the siphon and concluded that molecular cohesion is not required for the operation of a siphon but relies upon gravity and a pressure differential, writing: &quot;As the fluid initially primed on the long leg of the siphon rushes down due to gravity, it leaves behind a partial vacuum that allows pressure on the entrance point of the higher container to push fluid up the leg on that side&quot;.

The research team of Boatwright, Puttick, and Licence, all at the University of Nottingham, succeeded in running a siphon in high vacuum, also in 2011. They wrote: &quot;It is widely believed that the siphon is principally driven by the force of atmospheric pressure. An experiment is described that shows that a siphon can function even under high-vacuum conditions. Molecular cohesion and gravity are shown to be contributing factors in the operation of a siphon; the presence of a positive atmospheric pressure is not required&quot;.

Writing in Physics Today in 2011, J. Dooley from Millersville University stated that both a pressure differential within the siphon tube and the tensile strength of the liquid are required for a siphon to operate.

A researcher at Humboldt State University, A. McGuire, examined flow in siphons in 2012. Using the advanced general-purpose multiphysics simulation software package LS-DYNA he examined pressure initialisation, flow, and pressure propagation within a siphon. He concluded: &quot;Pressure, gravity and molecular cohesion can all be driving forces in the operation of siphons&quot;.

In 2014, Hughes and Gurung (at the Queensland University of Technology) ran a water siphon under varying air pressures ranging from sea level to 11.9 km () altitude. They noted: &quot;Flow remained more or less constant during ascension indicating that siphon flow is independent of ambient barometric pressure&quot;. They used Bernoulli&#x27;s equation and the Poiseuille equation to examine pressure differentials and fluid flow within a siphon. Their conclusion was: &quot;It follows from the above analysis that there must be a direct cohesive connection between water molecules flowing in and out of a siphon. This is true at all atmospheric pressures in which the pressure in the apex of the siphon is above the vapour pressure of water, an exception being ionic liquids&quot;.

==Practical requirements==
A plain tube can be used as a siphon. An external pump has to be applied to start the liquid flowing and &quot;prime&quot; the siphon (in home use this is often done by a person inhaling through the tube until enough of it has filled with liquid; this may pose danger to the user, depending on the liquid that is being siphoned). This is sometimes done with any leak-free hose to siphon gasoline from a motor vehicle&#x27;s gasoline tank to an external tank. (Siphoning gasoline by mouth often results in the accidental swallowing of gasoline, or aspirating it into the lungs, which can cause death or lung damage.) If the tube is flooded with liquid before part of the tube is raised over the intermediate high point and care is taken to keep the tube flooded while it is being raised, no pump is required. Devices sold as siphons often come with a &quot;siphon pump&quot; to start the siphon process.

In some applications it can be helpful to use siphon tubing that is not much larger than necessary. Using piping of too great a diameter and then throttling the flow using valves or constrictive piping appears to increase the effect of previously cited concerns over gases or vapor collecting in the crest which serve to break the vacuum. If the vacuum is reduced too much, the siphon effect can be lost. Reducing the size of pipe used closer to requirements appears to reduce this effect and creates a more functional siphon that does not require constant re-priming and restarting. In this respect, where the requirement is to match a flow into a container with a flow out of said container (to maintain a constant level in a pond fed by a stream, for example) it would be preferable to utilize two or three smaller separate parallel pipes that can be started as required rather than attempting to use a single large pipe and attempting to throttle it.

=== Automatic intermittent siphon ===
Siphons are sometimes employed as automatic machines, in situations where it is desirable to turn a continuous trickling flow or an irregular small surge flow into a large surge volume. A common example of this is a public restroom with urinals regularly flushed by an automatic siphon in a small water tank overhead. When the container is filled, all the stored liquid is released, emerging as a large surge volume that then resets and fills again. One way to do this intermittent action involves complex machinery such as floats, chains, levers, and valves, but these can corrode, wear out, or jam over time. An alternate method is with rigid pipes and chambers, using only the water itself in a siphon as the operating mechanism.

A siphon used in an automatic unattended device needs to be able to function reliably without failure. This is different from the common demonstration &quot;self-starting siphons&quot; in that there are ways the siphon can fail to function which require manual intervention to return to normal surge flow operation. A video demonstration of a self-starting siphon can be found here, courtesy of &quot;The Curiosity Show&quot;.

The most common failure is for the liquid to dribble out slowly, matching the rate that the container is filling, and the siphon enters an undesired steady-state condition. Preventing dribbling typically involves pneumatic principles to trap one or more large air bubbles in various pipes, which are sealed by water traps. This method can fail if it cannot start working intermittently without water already present in parts of the mechanism, and which will not be filled if the mechanism starts from a dry state.

A second problem is that the trapped air pockets will shrink over time if the siphon is not operating due to no inflow. The air in pockets is absorbed by the liquid, which pulls liquid up into the piping until the air pocket disappears, and can cause activation of water flow outside the normal range of operating when the storage tank is not full, leading to loss of the liquid seal in lower parts of the mechanism.

A third problem is where the lower end of the liquid seal is simply a U-trap bend in an outflow pipe. During vigorous emptying, the kinetic motion of the liquid out the outflow can propel too much liquid out, causing a loss of the sealing volume in the outflow trap and loss of the trapped air bubble to maintain intermittent operation.

A fourth problem involves seep holes in the mechanism, intended to slowly refill these various sealing chambers when the siphon is dry. The seep holes can be plugged by debris and corrosion, requiring manual cleaning and intervention. To prevent this, the siphon may be restricted to pure liquid sources, free of solids or precipitate.

Many automatic siphons have been invented going back to at least the 1850s, for automatic siphon mechanisms that attempt to overcome these problems using various pneumatic and hydrodynamic principles.

== Applications and terminology ==
When certain liquids needs to be purified, siphoning can help prevent either the bottom (dregs) or the top (foam and floaties) from being transferred out of one container into a new container. Siphoning is thus useful in the fermentation of wine and beer for this reason, since it can keep unwanted impurities out of the new container.

Self-constructed siphons, made of pipes or tubes, can be used to evacuate water from cellars after floodings. Between the flooded cellar and a deeper place outside a connection is built, using a tube or some pipes. They are filled with water through an intake valve (at the highest end of the construction). When the ends are opened, the water flows through the pipe into the sewer or the river.
Siphoning is common in irrigated fields to transfer a controlled amount of water from a ditch, over the ditch wall, into furrows.

Large siphons may be used in municipal waterworks and industry. Their size requires control via valves at the intake, outlet and crest of the siphon. The siphon may be primed by closing the intake and outlets and filling the siphon at the crest. If intakes and outlets are submerged, a vacuum pump may be applied at the crest to prime the siphon. Alternatively the siphon may be primed by a pump at either the intake or outlet. Gas in the liquid is a concern in large siphons. The gas tends to accumulate at the crest and if enough accumulates to break the flow of liquid, the siphon stops working. The siphon itself will exacerbate the problem because as the liquid is raised through the siphon, the pressure drops, causing dissolved gases within the liquid to come out of solution. Higher temperature accelerates the release of gas from liquids so maintaining a constant, low temperature helps. The longer the liquid is in the siphon, the more gas is released, so a shorter siphon overall helps. Local high points will trap gas so the intake and outlet legs should have continuous slopes without intermediate high points. The flow of the liquid moves bubbles thus the intake leg can have a shallow slope as the flow will push the gas bubbles to the crest. Conversely, the outlet leg needs to have a steep slope to allow the bubbles to move against the liquid flow; though other designs call for a shallow slope in the outlet leg as well to allow the bubbles to be carried out of the siphon. At the crest the gas can be trapped in a chamber above the crest. The chamber needs to be occasionally primed again with liquid to remove the gas.

=== Siphon rain gauge ===
A &quot;siphon rain gauge&quot; is a rain gauge that can record rainfall over an extended period. A siphon is used to automatically empty the gauge. It is often simply called a &quot;siphon gauge&quot; and is not to be confused with a siphon pressure gauge.

=== Siphon drainage ===
A siphon drainage method is being implemented in several expressways as of 2022. Recent studies found that it can reduce groundwater level behind expressway retaining walls, and there was no indication of clogging. This new drainage system is being pioneered as a long-term method to limit leakage hazard in the retaining wall. Siphon drainage is also used in draining unstable slopes, and siphon roof-water drainage systems have been in use since the 1960s.

=== Siphon spillway ===

A siphon spillway in a dam is usually not technically a siphon, as it is generally used to drain elevated water levels. However, a siphon spillway operates as an actual siphon if it raises the flow higher than the surface of the source reservoir, as sometimes is the case when used in irrigation. In operation, a siphon spillway is considered to be &quot;pipe flow&quot; or &quot;closed-duct flow&quot;. A normal spillway flow is pressurized by the height of the reservoir above the spillway, whereas a siphon flow rate is governed by the difference in height of the inlet and outlet. Some designs make use of an automatic system that uses the flow of water in a spiral vortex to remove the air above to prime the siphon. Such a design includes the volute siphon.

=== Flush toilet ===
Flush toilets often have some siphon effect as the bowl empties.

Some toilets also use the siphon principle to obtain the actual flush from the cistern. The flush is triggered by a lever or handle that operates a simple diaphragm-like piston pump that lifts enough water to the crest of the siphon to start the flow of water which then completely empties the contents of the cistern into the toilet bowl. The advantage of this system was that no water would leak from the cistern excepting when flushed. These were mandatory in the UK until 2011.

Early urinals incorporated a siphon in the cistern which would flush automatically on a regular cycle because there was a constant trickle of clean water being fed to the cistern by a slightly open valve.

== Devices that are not true siphons ==

=== Siphon coffee ===
While if both ends of a siphon are at atmospheric pressure, liquid flows from high to low, if the bottom end of a siphon is pressurized, liquid can flow from low to high. If pressure is removed from the bottom end, the liquid flow will reverse, illustrating that it is pressure driving the siphon. An everyday illustration of this is the siphon coffee brewer, which works as follows (designs vary; this is a standard design, omitting coffee grounds):
* a glass vessel is filled with water, then corked (so air-tight) with a siphon sticking vertically upwards
* another glass vessel is placed on top, open to the atmosphere – the top vessel is empty, the bottom is filled with water
* the bottom vessel is then heated; as the temperature increases, the vapor pressure of the water increases (it increasingly evaporates); when the water boils the vapor pressure equals atmospheric pressure, and as the temperature increases above boiling the pressure in the bottom vessel then &quot;exceeds&quot; atmospheric pressure, and pushes the water up the siphon tube into the upper vessel.
* a small amount of still hot water and steam remain in the bottom vessel and are kept heated, with this pressure keeping the water in the upper vessel
* when the heat is removed from the bottom vessel, the vapor pressure decreases, and can no longer support the column of water – gravity (acting on the water) and atmospheric pressure then push the water back into the bottom vessel.
In practice, the top vessel is filled with coffee grounds, and the heat is removed from the bottom vessel when the coffee has finished brewing. What vapor pressure means concretely is that the boiling water converts high-density water (a liquid) into low-density steam (a gas), which thus expands to take up more volume (in other words, the pressure increases). This pressure from the expanding steam then forces the liquid up the siphon; when the steam then condenses down to water the pressure decreases and the liquid flows back down.

=== Siphon pump ===
While a simple siphon cannot output liquid at a level higher than the source reservoir, a more complicated device utilizing an airtight metering chamber at the crest and a system of automatic valves, may discharge liquid on an ongoing basis, at a level higher than the source reservoir, without outside pumping energy being added. It can accomplish this despite what initially appears to be a violation of conservation of energy because it can take advantage of the energy of a large volume of liquid dropping some distance, to raise and discharge a small volume of liquid above the source reservoir. Thus it might be said to &quot;require&quot; a large quantity of falling liquid to power the dispensing of a small quantity. Such a system typically operates in a cyclical or start/stop but ongoing and self-powered manner. Ram pumps do not work in this way. These metering pumps are true siphon pumping devices which use siphons as their power source.

===Inverted siphon===
An &quot;inverted siphon&quot; is not a siphon but a term applied to pipes that must dip below an obstruction to form a U-shaped flow path.

Large inverted siphons are used to convey water being carried in canals or flumes across valleys, for irrigation or gold mining. The Romans used inverted siphons of lead pipes to cross valleys that were too big to construct an aqueduct.

&quot;Inverted siphons&quot; are commonly called traps for their function in preventing sewer gases from coming back out of sewers and sometimes making dense objects like rings and electronic components retrievable after falling into a drain. Liquid flowing in one end simply forces liquid up and out the other end, but solids like sand will accumulate. This is especially important in sewerage systems or culverts which must be routed under rivers or other deep obstructions where the better term is &quot;depressed sewer&quot;.

===Back siphonage===
&quot;Back siphonage&quot; is a plumbing term applied to the reversal of normal water flow in a plumbing system due to sharply reduced or negative pressure on the water supply side, such as high demand on water supply by fire-fighting; it is not an actual siphon as it is suction. Back siphonage is rare as it depends on submerged inlets at the outlet (home) end and these are uncommon. Back siphonage is not to be confused with backflow; which is the reversed flow of water from the outlet end to the supply end caused by pressure occurring at the outlet end. Also, building codes usually demand a check valve where the water supply enters a building to prevent backflow into the drinking water system.

===Anti-siphon valve===
Building codes often contain specific sections on back siphonage and especially for external faucets (See the sample building code quote, below). Backflow prevention devices such as &quot;anti-siphon valves&quot; are required in such designs. The reason is that external faucets may be attached to hoses which may be immersed in an external body of water, such as a garden pond, swimming pool, aquarium or washing machine. In these situations the unwanted flow is not actually the result of a siphon but suction due to reduced pressure on the water supply side. Should the pressure within the water supply system fall, the external water may be returned by back pressure into the drinking water system through the faucet. Another possible contamination point is the water intake in the toilet tank. An anti-siphon valve is also required here to prevent pressure drops in the water supply line from suctioning water out of the toilet tank (which may contain additives such as &quot;toilet blue&quot;) and contaminating the water system. Anti-siphon valves function as a one-direction check valve.

Anti-siphon valves are also used medically. Hydrocephalus, or excess fluid in the brain, may be treated with a shunt which drains cerebrospinal fluid from the brain. All shunts have a valve to relieve excess pressure in the brain. The shunt may lead into the abdominal cavity such that the shunt outlet is significantly lower than the shunt intake when the patient is standing. Thus a siphon effect may take place and instead of simply relieving excess pressure, the shunt may act as a siphon, completely draining cerebrospinal fluid from the brain. The valve in the shunt may be designed to prevent this siphon action so that negative pressure on the drain of the shunt does not result in excess drainage. Only excess positive pressure from within the brain should result in drainage.

The anti-siphon valve in medical shunts is preventing excess forward flow of liquid. In plumbing systems, the anti-siphon valve is preventing backflow.

&quot;Sample building code regulations regarding &quot;back siphonage&quot; from the Canadian province of Ontario&quot;:
:7.6.2.3.Back Siphonage
:# Every potable water system that supplies a fixture or tank that is not subject to pressures above atmospheric shall be protected against back-siphonage by a backflow preventer.
:# Where a potable water supply is connected to a boiler, tank, cooling jacket, lawn sprinkler system or other device where a non-potable fluid may be under pressure that is above atmospheric or the water outlet may be submerged in the non-potable fluid, the water supply shall be protected against backflow by a backflow preventer.
:# Where a hose bibb is installed outside a building, inside a garage, or where there is an identifiable risk of contamination, the potable water system shall be protected against backflow by a backflow preventer.

====Other anti-siphoning devices====
Along with anti-siphon valves, &quot;anti-siphoning devices&quot; also exist. The two are unrelated in application. Siphoning can be used to remove fuel from tanks. With the cost of fuel increasing, it has been linked in several countries to the rise in fuel theft. Trucks, with their large fuel tanks, are most vulnerable. The anti-siphon device prevents thieves from inserting a tube into the fuel tank.

===Siphon barometer===
A &quot;siphon barometer&quot; is the term sometimes applied to the simplest of mercury barometers. A continuous U-shaped tube of the same diameter throughout is sealed on one end and filled with mercury. When placed into the upright, &quot;U&quot;, position, mercury will flow away from the sealed end, forming a partial vacuum, until balanced by atmospheric pressure on the other end. The term &quot;siphon&quot; derives from the belief that air pressure is involved in the operation of a siphon. The difference in height of the fluid between the two arms of the U-shaped tube is the same as the maximum intermediate height of a siphon. When used to measure pressures other than atmospheric pressure, a siphon barometer is sometimes called a &quot;siphon gauge&quot;; these are not siphons but follow a standard U-shaped design leading to the term. Siphon barometers are still produced as precision instruments. Siphon barometers should not be confused with a siphon rain gauge.,

A &quot;siphon bottle&quot; (also called a &quot;soda syphon&quot; or, archaically, a &quot;siphoid&quot;) is a pressurized bottle with a vent and a valve. It is not a siphon as pressure within the bottle drives the liquid up and out a tube. A special form was the &quot;gasogene&quot;.

===Siphon cup===
A &quot;siphon cup&quot; is the (hanging) reservoir of paint attached to a spray gun, it is not a siphon as a vacuum pump extracts the paint. This name is to distinguish it from gravity-fed reservoirs. An archaic use of the term is a cup of oil in which the oil is transported out of the cup via a cotton wick or tube to a surface to be lubricated, this is not a siphon but an example of capillary action.

===Heron&#x27;s siphon===
&quot;Heron&#x27;s siphon&quot; is not a siphon as it works as a gravity driven pressure pump, at first glance it appears to be a perpetual motion machine but will stop when the air in the priming pump is depleted. In a slightly differently configuration, it is also known as Heron&#x27;s fountain.

===Venturi siphon===
A venturi siphon, also known as an eductor, is not a siphon but a form of vacuum pump using the Venturi effect of fast flowing fluids (e.g. air), to produce low pressures to suction other fluids; a common example is the carburetor. See pressure head. The low pressure at the throat of the venturi is called a siphon when a second fluid is introduced, or an aspirator when the fluid is air, this is an example of the misconception that air pressure is the operating force for siphons.

===Siphonic roof drainage===
Despite the name, siphonic roof drainage does not work as a siphon; the technology makes use of gravity induced vacuum pumping to carry water horizontally from multiple roof drains to a single downpipe and to increase flow velocity. Metal baffles at the roof drain inlets reduce the injection of air which increases the efficiency of the system. One benefit to this drainage technique is reduced capital costs in construction compared to traditional roof drainage. Another benefit is the elimination of pipe pitch or gradient required for conventional roof drainage piping. However this system of gravity pumping is mainly suitable for large buildings and is not usually suitable for residential properties.

=== Self-siphons ===
The term &quot;self-siphon&quot; is used in a number of ways. Liquids that are composed of long polymers can &quot;self-siphon&quot; and these liquids do not depend on atmospheric pressure. Self-siphoning polymer liquids work the same as the siphon-chain model where the lower part of the chain pulls the rest of the chain up and over the crest. This phenomenon is also called a &quot;tubeless siphon&quot;.

&quot;Self-siphon&quot; is also often used in sales literature by siphon manufacturers to describe portable siphons that contain a pump. With the pump, no external suction (e.g. from a person&#x27;s mouth/lungs) is required to start the siphon and thus the product is described as a &quot;self-siphon&quot;.

If the upper reservoir is such that the liquid there can rise above the height of the siphon crest, the rising liquid in the reservoir can &quot;self-prime&quot; the siphon and the whole apparatus be described as a &quot;self-siphon&quot;. Once primed, such a siphon will continue to operate until the level of the upper reservoir falls below the intake of the siphon. Such self-priming siphons are useful in some rain gauges and dams.

==In nature==

=== Anatomy ===

The term &quot;siphon&quot; is used for a number of structures in human and animal anatomy, either because flowing liquids are involved or because the structure is shaped like a siphon, but in which no actual siphon effect is occurring: see Siphon (disambiguation).

There has been a debate if whether the siphon mechanism plays a role in blood circulation. However, in the &#x27;closed loop&#x27; of circulation this was discounted; &quot;In contrast, in &#x27;closed&#x27; systems, like the circulation, gravity does not hinder uphill flow nor does it cause downhill flow, because gravity acts equally on the ascending and descending limbs of the circuit&quot;, but for &quot;historical reasons&quot;, the term is used. One hypothesis (in 1989) was that a siphon existed in the circulation of the giraffe. But further research in 2004 found that, &quot;There is no hydrostatic gradient and since the &#x27;fall&#x27; of fluid does not assist the ascending arm, there is no siphon. The giraffe&#x27;s high arterial pressure, which is sufficient to raise the blood 2 m from heart to head with sufficient remaining pressure to perfuse the brain, supports this concept.&quot; However, a paper written in 2005 urged more research on the hypothesis:

The principle of the siphon is not species specific and should be a fundamental principle of closed circulatory systems. Therefore, the controversy surrounding the role of the siphon principle may best be resolved by a comparative approach. Analyses of blood pressure on a variety of long-necked and long-bodied animals, which take into account phylogenetic relatedness, will be important. In addition experimental studies that combined measurements of arterial and venous blood pressures, with cerebral blood flow, under a variety of gravitational stresses (different head positions), will ultimately resolve this controversy.

===Species===

Some species are named after siphons because they resemble siphons in whole or in part. Geosiphons are fungi. There are species of alga belonging to the family Siphonocladaceae in the phylum Chlorophyta which have tube-like structures. &quot;Ruellia villosa&quot; is a tropical plant in the family Acanthaceae that is also known by the botanical synonym, &quot;Siphonacanthus villosus&quot; Nees&#x27;.

=== Geology ===

In speleology, a siphon or a sump is that part of a cave passage that lies under water and through which cavers have to dive to progress further into the cave system, but it is not an actual siphon.

=== Rivers ===

A river siphon occurs when part of the water flow passes under a submerged object like a rock or tree trunk. The water flowing under the obstruction can be very powerful, and as such can be very dangerous for kayaking, canyoning, and other river-based watersports.

==Explanation using Bernoulli&#x27;s equation==

Bernoulli&#x27;s equation may be applied to a siphon to derive its ideal flow rate and theoretical maximum height.

:Let the surface of the upper reservoir be the reference elevation.
:Let point A be the start point of siphon, immersed within the higher reservoir and at a depth −&quot;d&quot; below the surface of the upper reservoir.
:Let point B be the intermediate high point on the siphon tube at height +&quot;h&quot;B above the surface of the upper reservoir.
:Let point C be the drain point of the siphon at height −&quot;h&quot;C below the surface of the upper reservoir.

Bernoulli&#x27;s equation:
: formula_1
: formula_2 = fluid velocity along the streamline
: formula_3 = gravitational acceleration downwards
: formula_4 = elevation in gravity field
: formula_5 = pressure along the streamline
: formula_6 = fluid density

Apply Bernoulli&#x27;s equation to the surface of the upper reservoir. The surface is technically falling as the upper reservoir is being drained. However, for this example we will assume the reservoir to be infinite and the velocity of the surface may be set to zero. Furthermore, the pressure at both the surface and the exit point C is atmospheric pressure. Thus:

Apply Bernoulli&#x27;s equation to point A at the start of the siphon tube in the upper reservoir where &quot;P&quot; = &quot;P&quot;A, &quot;v&quot; = &quot;v&quot;A and &quot;y&quot; = −&quot;d&quot;

Apply Bernoulli&#x27;s equation to point B at the intermediate high point of the siphon tube where &quot;P&quot; = &quot;P&quot;B, &quot;v&quot; = &quot;v&quot;B and &quot;y&quot; = &quot;h&quot;B

Apply Bernoulli&#x27;s equation to point C where the siphon empties. Where &quot;v&quot; = &quot;v&quot;C and &quot;y&quot; = −&quot;h&quot;C. Furthermore, the pressure at the exit point is atmospheric pressure. Thus:

===Velocity===

As the siphon is a single system, the constant in all four equations is the same. Setting equations 1 and 4 equal to each other gives:

:formula_7

Solving for &quot;v&quot;C:

:Velocity of siphon:

:formula_8

The velocity of the siphon is thus driven solely by the height difference between the surface of the upper reservoir and the drain point. The height of the intermediate high point, &quot;h&quot;B, does not affect the velocity of the siphon. However, as the siphon is a single system, &quot;v&quot;B = &quot;v&quot;C and the intermediate high point does limit the maximum velocity. The drain point cannot be lowered indefinitely to increase the velocity. Equation 3 will limit the velocity to retain a positive pressure at the intermediate high point to prevent cavitation. The maximum velocity may be calculated by combining equations 1 and 3:

:formula_9

Setting &quot;P&quot;B = 0 and solving for &quot;v&quot;max:

:Maximum velocity of siphon:
:formula_10

The depth, −&quot;d&quot;, of the initial entry point of the siphon in the upper reservoir, does not affect the velocity of the siphon. No limit to the depth of the siphon start point is implied by Equation 2 as pressure &quot;P&quot;A increases with depth &quot;d&quot;. Both these facts imply the operator of the siphon may bottom skim or top skim the upper reservoir without impacting the siphon&#x27;s performance.

This equation for the velocity is the same as that of any object falling height &quot;h&quot;C. This equation assumes &quot;P&quot;C is atmospheric pressure. If the end of the siphon is below the surface, the height to the end of the siphon cannot be used; rather the height difference between the reservoirs should be used.

===Maximum height===

Although siphons can exceed the barometric height of the liquid in special circumstances, e.g. when the liquid is degassed and the tube is clean and smooth, in general the practical maximum height can be found as follows.

Setting equations 1 and 3 equal to each other gives:

:formula_11

Maximum height of the intermediate high point occurs when it is so high that the pressure at the intermediate high point is zero; in typical scenarios this will cause the liquid to form bubbles and if the bubbles enlarge to fill the pipe then the siphon will &quot;break&quot;. Setting &quot;P&quot;B = 0:

:formula_12

Solving for &quot;h&quot;B:

:General height of siphon:

:formula_13

This means that the height of the intermediate high point is limited by pressure along the streamline being always greater than zero.

:Maximum height of siphon:
:formula_14

This is the maximum height that a siphon will work. Substituting values will give approximately for water and, by definition of standard pressure, for mercury. The ratio of heights (about 13.6) equals the ratio of densities of water and mercury (at a given temperature). As long as this condition is satisfied (pressure greater than zero), the flow at the output of the siphon is still only governed by the height difference between the source surface and the outlet. Volume of fluid in the apparatus is not relevant as long as the pressure head remains above zero in every section. Because pressure drops when velocity is increased, a static siphon (or manometer) can have a slightly higher height than a flowing siphon.

==Operation in a vacuum==

Experiments have shown that siphons can operate in a vacuum, via cohesion and tensile strength between molecules, provided that the liquids are pure and degassed and surfaces are very clean.

The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; (OED) entry on &quot;siphon&quot;, published in 1911, states that a siphon works by atmospheric pressure. Stephen Hughes of Queensland University of Technology criticized this in a 2010 article which was widely reported in the media. The OED editors stated, &quot;there is continuing debate among scientists as to which view is correct. ... We would expect to reflect this debate in the fully updated entry for siphon, due to be published later this year.&quot; Hughes continued to defend his view of the siphon in a late September post at the Oxford blog. The 2015 definition by the OED is:

A tube used to convey liquid upwards from a reservoir and then down to a lower level of its own accord. Once the liquid has been forced into the tube, typically by suction or immersion, flow continues unaided.

The &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; currently describes a siphon as:

Siphon, also spelled syphon, instrument, usually in the form of a tube bent to form two legs of unequal length, for conveying liquid over the edge of a vessel and delivering it at a lower level. Siphons may be of any size. The action depends upon the influence of gravity (not, as sometimes thought, on the difference in atmospheric pressure; a siphon will work in a vacuum) and upon the cohesive forces that prevent the columns of liquid in the legs of the siphon from breaking under their own weight. At sea level, water can be lifted a little more than 10 metres (33 feet) by a siphon.

In civil engineering, pipelines called inverted siphons are used to carry sewage or stormwater under streams, highway cuts, or other depressions in the ground. In an inverted siphon the liquid completely fills the pipe and flows under pressure, as opposed to the open-channel gravity flow that occurs in most sanitary or storm sewers.

<doc id="459167" wikidata="Q130449" url="?curid=459167" title="Flag of Latvia">
<text>The national flag of Latvia () was used by independent Latvia from 1918 until the country was occupied by the Soviet Union in 1940. Its use was suppressed during Soviet rule. On 27 February 1990, shortly before the country regained its independence, the Latvian government re-adopted the traditional red-white-red flag.

Though officially adopted in 1921, the Latvian flag was used in as early as the 13th century, according to the &quot;Rhymed Chronicle of Livonia&quot;. The red colour is sometimes described as symbolizing the readiness of the Latvians to give the blood from their hearts for freedom and their willingness to defend their sovereignty. An alternative interpretation is that a Latgalian leader was wounded in battle, and the sheet on which he was laid on was stained by his blood with only the centre stripe of the sheet being left unstained. This story is similar to the legend of the origins of the flag of Austria.

== History ==
The red-white-red Latvian flag is first mentioned in the medieval &quot;Rhymed Chronicle of Livonia&quot; (&quot;Livländische Reimchronik&quot;), which covers the period from 1180 to 1343, and is thus among the oldest flags in the world. The chronicle tells of a battle that took place around 1279, in which ancient Latgalian tribes from Cēsis, a city in northern modern-day Latvia, went to war, bearing a &#x27;red flag with a white stripe&#x27;.

Legend recounts the story of a mortally wounded chief of Latgalians who had been wrapped in a white sheet. The part of sheet on which he was lying remained white, and the two edges were coloured by his blood. During the next battle, the bloodstained sheet was used as a flag. According to the legend, this time the Latgalian warriors were successful and drove the enemy away. Since then, Latgalian tribes have been using these colours as their symbol.

Inspired by these historical records, several Latvian nationalists began to use such flags again in the 19th century. The first flag with red field and narrow white stripe concept was made by Valmiera Trade School teacher Marianna Strautmane (1896–1985) in the second half of 1916, according to a sketch made by her colleague, journalist and refugee activist (1885–1941). This bright-red flag featured a yellow sun on the upper-left corner of the flag, and it later flew over the building of the Valmiera Latvian Society during the Vidzeme Land Meeting in March 1917. Preserved by the Lapiņš family during the Soviet occupation of Latvia in 1940 and in exile in the West after 1944, it was ultimately given to the Cēsis Museum in 1997, where today it is on display in Cēsis Castle.
In 1917, a red-white-red flag was used in several events aimed at uniting Latvian regions as well as Latvian military formations (e.g. Latvian Riflemen units, Iskolat institutions), and the debate about the visual appearance of the Latvian flag was raised. In May, during a meeting of the Latvian Art Promotion Association (Latviešu mākslas veicināšanas biedrība), several proposals were reviewed, finally, a design by artist was accepted.

During the Latvian War of Independence, the flag saw ever-growing use by the Latvian Armed Forces, government institutions (e.g. it flew from Riga Castle before and during the Battle of Riga in 1919) and the population. The Latvian national flag, together with the national coat of arms was officially affirmed in this format by a decree of the Constitutional Assembly of Latvia passed on 15 June 1921.

===Occupation===
During the Soviet period by the Soviet Union (and briefly during occupation by Nazi Germany), the red-white-red Latvian flag was rendered unusable from 1940 to 1941 and 1944 to 1991. Any production and public display of the nationalist Latvian flag was considered anti-state crime and punishable by law. The first flag of Soviet Latvia was a red flag with the gold hammer and sickle in the top-left corner, with the Latin characters LPSR (&quot;Latvijas Padomju Sociālistiskā Republika&quot;) above them in gold in a serif font. In 1953, the final version of the flag was adopted. It depicts the Soviet flag with six 1/3 blue wavy bands representing the sea on the bottom.

===Restoration===
The local authorities restored the status of the red-white-red flag as the national flag of Latvia on 15 February 1990, one and half years before the formal recognition of Latvian independence by the Soviet Union on 6 September 1991. 
== Design ==

According to Latvian law, &quot;The Latvian national flag is carmine red with a white horizontal stripe.&quot; () The colour on the flag is sometimes referred to as &quot;Latvian red&quot;. The red colour of the Latvian flag is a particularly dark shade, which is composed of brown and purple. The flag&#x27;s colour proportions are 2:1:2 (the upper and lower red bands each being twice as wide as the central white band), and the ratio of the height of the flag to its width is fixed at 1:2.

On 11 April 1995, the State Heraldic Commission have once chosen Pantone 1807 C for red colour, this was later replaced by Pantone 201 C on 21 April 2009. On 1 May 2010, the Cabinet of Ministers issued the &quot;Procedures for the Application of the Law on the National Flag&quot;, which standardized Pantone 19-1629 TPX or 19-1629 TC for red field; an amendment made on 27 November 2018, which came into force 1 January 2019, stating that non-fabric flags, as well as representations produced using other techniques (including digital representations), would use Pantone 201 C, whilst physical flags would continue using 19-1629 TPX/TC.

== Display of the flag ==

Latvian law states that the flag and national colours can be displayed and used as an ornament if proper respect to the flag is guaranteed. Destruction, disrespectful treatment or incorrect display of the flag is punishable by law.

The flag shall be placed at least above the ground and properly secured to the flagstaff. The flagstaff shall be longer than the longest side of the flag, straight, painted white, and preferably made of wood. The finial at the tip of the flagstaff shall be wider than the flagstaff. When the flag is not displayed continuously, it shall be raised at sunrise and lowered at sunset. If flown for a festival or funeral, it shall be raised before and lowered after the end of the occasion.

If the flag is flown from a flagpole in mourning, it shall be raised to half-staff. If fixed to a flagstaff, a black ribbon whose width is the width of the flag shall be secured to the flagstaff above the flag; the ribbon shall be of sufficient length to span the width of the flag.

<doc id="459170" wikidata="Q36005" url="?curid=459170" title="Flag of Lebanon">
<text>The national flag of Lebanon () is formed of two horizontal red stripes enveloping a horizontal white stripe. The white stripe is twice the height (width) of the red ones (ratio 1:2:1) – a Spanish fess. The green cedar tree (&quot;Cedrus libani&quot;) in the middle touches each of the red stripes and its width is one third of the width of the flag.

The red stripes represent the blood shed by those who fought for Lebanon. The white stripe represents purity, peace and the snow-capped mountains of Lebanon. The cedar on the flag represents immortality and hope.

== Design ==
According to the Article 5 of the Constitution of Lebanon: &quot;The Lebanese flag shall be composed of three horizontal stripes, a white stripe between two red ones. The width of the white stripe shall be equal to that of both red stripes. In the center of and occupying one-third of the white stripe is a green cedar tree with its top touching the upper red strip and its base touching the lower red stripe&quot;.

Prior to 1995, the constitution did not specify the color of the cedar&#x27;s tree trunk, and it was common to see a brown trunk as depicted in the original drawing. Similar brown-trunk variants were registered by the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) and on official postcards of United Nations with member state flags. In 1995 the constitution was amended to specify the color (green) of the whole cedar tree.


== Symbolism ==

The Lebanese flag&#x27;s design is deeply rooted in the country&#x27;s history, culture, and natural heritage, with the cedar tree (&quot;Cedrus libani&quot;) at its heart. The cedar has been a symbol of Lebanon for millennia, representing resilience, immortality, and unity. Its inclusion on the flag reflects Lebanon&#x27;s identity as the &quot;Land of the Cedars&quot;.

The cedar of Lebanon holds a prominent place in history and religious texts. It is mentioned 77 times in the Bible, often symbolizing strength, majesty, and divine blessing. In Psalms 92:12, it is written, &quot;The righteous shall flourish like the palm-tree; He shall grow like a cedar in Lebanon&quot;, and in Psalms 104:16, &quot;[t]he trees of the Lord have their fill, The cedars of Lebanon, which He hath planted&quot;. The cedar&#x27;s wood, known for its durability and resistance to pests, was used to build sacred structures, including Solomon&#x27;s Temple in Jerusalem.

The cedar has inspired poets, writers, and political leaders. Alphonse de Lamartine, marveling at the cedars during his trip to the Middle East, wrote, &quot;[t]he cedars of Lebanon are the relics of centuries and nature, the most famous natural landmarks in the universe.&quot; Similarly, Antoine de Saint-Exupéry, who visited Lebanon in 1935, reflected on the cedar&#x27;s symbolism in his work &quot;&quot;: &quot;[t]he peace is a long-growing tree. We need, as the cedar, to rock its unity.&quot;

In 1920, during the proclamation of the State of Greater Lebanon, the cedar was described as a symbol of resilience and unity: &quot;[a]n evergreen cedar is like a young nation despite a cruel past. Although oppressed, never conquered, the cedar is its rallying. By the union, it will break all attacks.&quot; This sentiment was echoed in the design of the Lebanese flag, which merged the French tricolor with the cedar to reflect Lebanon&#x27;s ties to France under the mandate.

The current flag, adopted in 1943, carries profound symbolic meanings. The two red stripes represent the blood shed by the Lebanese people during their struggles for independence, first against the Ottoman Empire and later against French colonial rule. The white stripe symbolizes peace, purity, and the snow that covers Lebanon&#x27;s mountains. The green cedar in the center stands for immortality, steadfastness, and hope. The flag was designed to be neutral, uniting Lebanon&#x27;s diverse religious communities under a shared national identity.

== History ==
=== Fall of the Ottoman rule and French mandate (1913–1943) ===

The cedar tree has long been a symbol of Lebanon, with its roots tracing back to the 18th century when it became emblematic of the Christian Maronites. By 1848, the cedar was the central feature of the unofficial flag of Lebanon, which was then a semi-autonomous territory within the Ottoman Empire. This flag, white with a green cedar tree in the center, reflected the growing national identity of the Lebanese people.

The rise of Lebanese national self-confidence was particularly evident among diaspora communities. In 1913, Shukri El Khoury, a Lebanese-Brazilian journalist and editor of &quot;The Sphinx&quot;, proposed &quot;a white flag with a cedar tree in the center&quot;. This design was adopted by Lebanese immigrants in the Americas and communicated to the Allied Powers. The same flag was also embraced in Lebanon, though El Khoury later suggested adding the blue and red of the French tricolor to honor the French mandate. However, Rachid Nakhle, a leader of the Lebanon League of Progress, noted in his memoirs that on 2 November 1918, a white flag with a green cedar was hoisted over the palace in Baabda, where it remained until May 1919.

Lebanese communities abroad were influenced by diplomatic developments and shifting political attitudes. On 3 July 1919, the French consul in Santiago de Cuba, Mr. Briloun, reported to the French Minister of Foreign Affairs, Stephen Pichon, that Lebanese communities were advocating for a French protectorate over Lebanon, separate from Syria. They presented a proposed national flag featuring a cedar in the white band, symbolizing Lebanon&#x27;s distinct identity.

The 1913 version of the flag, created by El Khoury and Naoum Labaki, was raised as Lebanon&#x27;s first national flag on 2 October 1918, following the fall of the Ottoman Empire. An alternate version, designed by El Khoury in 1918, included red and blue triangles on the left side of the white cedar flag, paying homage to the French mandate.

In May 1919, Naoum Mokarzel, president of the Lebanon League of Progress, designed another version of the flag, inspired by the French tricolor. It featured vertical blue, white, and red bands with a cedar tree in the center. However, this design faced opposition from many Lebanese Christians, who felt it threatened their identity. In protest, the Administrative Council and Lebanese municipalities flew the plain white cedar flag, particularly in the districts of Batroun and Keserwan. Meanwhile, demonstrators in Baabda demanded &quot;the affirmation of the union of Lebanon with France, consecrated by the choice, as a national emblem, of the tricolor flag with the Cedar in a white band.&quot;

On 22 March 1920, a demonstration in Baabda raised the tricolor flag, which was hailed by General Gouraud as a &quot;symbol of freedom.&quot; This flag was officially adopted on 23 May 1926, as described in Article 5 of the Lebanese Constitution: &quot;The Lebanese flag is blue, white, and red in vertical bands of equal width, with a cedar on the white part.&quot; Although the constitution did not specify the cedar&#x27;s color, most contemporary depictions showed it as green with a brown trunk.

The tricolor flag was designed by Naoum Mokarzel, who presented it at the 1919 Versailles Peace Conference to French President Raymond Poincaré. Poincaré enthusiastically accepted the design, which later became the official flag of Lebanon under the League of Nations. On 1 September 1920, General Henri Gouraud proclaimed the State of Greater Lebanon, merging the French tricolor with the Lebanese cedar as its national emblem. This flag symbolized Lebanon&#x27;s union with France and remained in use until the adoption of the current flag in 1943.

=== Lebanese Republic (1943–present) ===

The present Lebanese flag was adopted just prior to independence from France in 1943. Seeking independence, the flag was first drawn by members of parliament during a meeting at Saeb Salam&#x27;s house in Mousaitbeh. It was officially adopted on 7 December 1943, during a parliamentary session where Article 5 of the Lebanese Constitution was amended.

The flag&#x27;s design is attributed to Henri Pharaon, a member of parliament, who proposed the composition based on Lebanon&#x27;s geography. The two red stripes represent the Mount Lebanon and Anti-Lebanon mountain ranges, while the white stripe symbolizes the Beqaa Valley situated between them. The green cedar tree in the center of the white stripe represents Lebanon&#x27;s identity as the &quot;Land of the Cedars&quot;.

The adoption of the flag occurred in a tense political climate. Following Lebanon&#x27;s unilateral abolition of the French mandate in November 1943, French authorities arrested key government leaders, including President Bechara El Khoury and Prime Minister Riad Al Solh. Only seven parliament members were permitted to meet in the French-occupied Parliament. During this brief meeting, the deputies hastily devised the flag&#x27;s design, preserving the cedar as a national symbol. The flag was formally introduced into the Constitution on 7 December 1943, with the text specifying its composition: three horizontal stripes (red, white, and red) with a green cedar tree occupying one-third of the white stripe.

Accounts of the flag&#x27;s creation vary. Henri Pharaon claimed he proposed the design, influenced by his Austrian connections, and was assisted by Saadi Al Munla and Mohamad Al Fadl. Pierre Gemayel, leader of the Kataeb Party, also asserted that his party conceived the flag&#x27;s design, which was later adopted by the government. The original drawing of the flag, signed by seven parliament members, was based on Pharaon&#x27;s proposal and executed by Saadi Al Munla.

The flag was first raised in Bechamoun on 21 November 1943 at 11:20pm; in 1979 the Minister of National Education, Boutros Harb, declared 21 November as National Flag Day. In 1994, the Lebanese government standardized the cedar&#x27;s color to entirely green, replacing the earlier naturalistic depiction with a brown trunk. This change was reflected in official representations, including those registered with the WIPO.

<doc id="459173" wikidata="Q104969" url="?curid=459173" title="Flag of Lesotho">
<text>The current national flag of Lesotho, adopted on the 40th anniversary of Lesotho&#x27;s independence on 4 October 2006, features a horizontal blue, white, and green tricolour with a black &quot;mokorotlo&quot; (a Basotho hat) in the center. The design is intended to reflect a state that is both at peace internally and with its only neighbour South Africa, replacing the old flag design that featured a military emblem of a shield, spear and knobkerrie.

== Colours ==

The symbolism of the colours is:


==Construction sheet==
==History==
===1966–1987===
The first flag of Lesotho was introduced on 4 October 1966, the day of Lesotho&#x27;s full independence from the United Kingdom. It featured a prominent white &quot;mokorotlo&quot;. The blue stood for sky and rain, the white for peace, the green for land, and the red for faith.
===1987–2006===
A new flag, designed by Sergeant Retšelisitsoe Matete, was adopted on 20 January 1987, following a military coup which ousted the Basotho National Party after 20 years in power. A light brown traditional Basotho shield along with an assegai (lance) and knobkierrie (club) replaced the mokorotlo as the primary emblem. The colour scheme and pattern changed as well, with a triangular white field standing for peace. The bottom diagonal contained a blue strip for rain and a green triangle for prosperity.
===2006–present===
In 2006, a new flag was chosen from four proposed designs; all of these designs included a brown Basotho hat instead of the shield. This was subsequently changed to a black Basotho hat in order to represent Lesotho as a black nation. The bill changing the flag was approved by the National Assembly on 18 September 2006, with 84 members of parliament voting in favour of it, 18 against it, and two abstaining. It was subsequently approved by the Senate as well.

<text>The national flag of Lithuania () consists of a horizontal tricolour of yellow, green, and red. It was adopted on 25 April 1918 during Lithuania&#x27;s first period of independence (1918–1940), which ceased with the occupation first by the Soviet Union, and then by Nazi Germany (1941–1944). During the post-World War II Soviet occupation, from 1945 until 1988, the Flag of the Lithuanian SSR consisted first of a generic red Soviet flag with the name of the republic, in 1953 that was changed to the red flag with white and green bands at the bottom.

The flag was then re-adopted on 18 November 1988, about 1.5 years before the re-establishment of Lithuania&#x27;s independence and almost three years before the collapse of the Soviet Union. The last alteration to the current flag occurred in 2004, when the aspect ratio changed from 1:2 to 3:5.

==History==

===Historical state flag===
The earliest known flags with a Lithuanian identity were recorded in the 15th-century &quot;Banderia Prutenorum&quot;, written by Jan Długosz. At the Battle of Grunwald in 1410, two distinct flags were present. The majority of the 40 regiments carried a red banner depicting a mounted knight in pursuit. This flag, known as the &quot;Vytis&quot;, would eventually be used as the Lithuanian war flag, and again in 2004 as the state flag. The remaining regiments carried a red banner displaying the Columns of Gediminas. Those that bore the Vytis were part of the Grand Ducal Lithuanian army, while those who bore the Columns of Gediminas were from Lithuanian nobility. Until the end of the 18th century, when it was annexed by the Russian Empire, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania used the Vytis as its flag.

===Creation of modern flag===

The birth of the yellow, green, and red tricolour occurred during a drive by other European republics to change their flags. One example that gave life to the idea of the tricolour was the French blue, white, and red flag adopted after the French Revolution. The only tricolour that existed for Lithuania before the yellow, green, and red flag was a green, white, and red flag used to represent Lithuania Minor.

It is not known who originally suggested the yellow, green, and red colours, but the idea is usually attributed to Lithuanian exiles living elsewhere in Europe or in the United States during the 19th century. These three colours were frequently used in folk weavings and traditional dress. At the Great Seimas of Vilnius of 1905, this flag was favoured over the Vytis banner as the flag of the Lithuanian nation. The Vytis, strongly advocated by Jonas Basanavičius, was not chosen for three reasons: the first was that as part of the drive for national identity, the Seimas wished to distance itself somewhat from the flag of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, which also encompassed now-distinct nations such as Belarus and Ukraine. The second issue was the choice of the colour red by revolutionaries who aligned themselves with Marxist or Communist causes. And finally, the flag with Vytis would be too complicated and could not be easily sewn.
Debates about the national flag occurred again in 1917 during the Vilnius Conference. Two colours, green and red, were chosen based on their prevalence in folk art. Artist Antanas Žmuidzinavičius decorated the conference hall with small red and green flags. However, the delegates did not like the design as it was too dark and gloomy. Then Tadas Daugirdas suggested adding a narrow strip of yellow (to symbolise the rising sun) in between the red (clouds lit up by the morning sun) and green (fields and forests). However, the delegates decided that the matter should be settled by a special commission, composed of Basanavičius, Žmuidzinavičius, and Daugirdas. On 19 April 1918, they submitted their final protocol to the Council of Lithuania. The flag was supposed to be a tricolour (yellow at the top, green in the middle, and red at the bottom) with Vytis in the upper left corner or in the middle. The Council accepted the proposal, but the 1922 Constitution of Lithuania did not include any mention of the coat of arms. It adopted the national flag that is used today. Any of the debates failed to produce a historical flag. Discussions of the national flag continued; its opponents considered gold an inappropriate colour, since the combination of yellow, green, and red did not follow the existing rules of heraldry. However, no changes were made during the Interwar period.

===Soviet occupation===

During World War II, Lithuania was occupied by the Soviet Union (1940–1941, 1944–1990) and Nazi Germany (1941–1944). The use of the national flag during this period was prohibited and prosecuted. Two flags were used during the period of Soviet occupation (1944–1988): immediately after the war, the flag consisted of a red field, golden hammer and sickle with the Latin characters &quot;LIETUVOS TSR&quot; (Lithuanian SSR in the Lithuanian language) above them in gold sans-serif lettering. That flag was replaced in 1953 by the last flag used by the Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic—a red flag, with the hammer and sickle and star in the hoist. At the bottom of the flag, a white and green horizontal bar was placed. The red portion of the flag took of the flag&#x27;s width, the white and the green . Since Lithuania banned Soviet symbols in 2008, raising or otherwise using the Lithuanian SSR flag in public is illegal.

===Restoration of modern flag===
During 1988, when the Lithuanian movement towards independence was gaining strength, the Lithuanian Supreme Soviet again recognised the tricolour as the national flag, by amending article 168 of the Constitution (Fundamental Law) of the Lithuanian SSR. The flag was defined as rectangular tricolour which consists of three equally sized horizontal stripes: the upper is yellow, the middle is green, the lower is red; the flag ratio was to be 1:2 (as that of Soviet flags). This flag was confirmed by the Provisional Constitution of 11 March 1990 No. I-10.

After independence from the Soviet Union, the tricolour flag was written into the new Constitution of Lithuania, which was adopted by a referendum in 1992. This constitution has not specified the flag aspect ratio and therefore it remained 1:2 until 2004, when 1991 law &quot;On the national flag and other flags&quot; was revised by 8 July 2004 law no. IX-2331, making the flag ratio 3:5.

==Design and symbolism==

Passed on 26 June 1991, the Law of the Republic of Lithuania on the Lithuanian State Flag (Law No. I-1497) governs the design, sizes and use of the state flag. The law was amended on 8 July 2004, (Law No. IX-2331) with the most notable changes including the switching of the national flag ratio from 1:2 to 3:5 and the official adoption of a historical flag as the state (government) flag. The amendment came into force on 1 September 2004, after it was approved by President Valdas Adamkus.

The yellow in the flag is meant to symbolise the sun and prosperity, the green is for the forests, the countryside, liberty, and hope, and the red represents the blood and bravery of those who have died for Lithuania. The proper colours of both the national and state flag are made according to the Pantone Matching System, specifically Pantone textile-paper (TP). The ratio of both the national and state flag must be 3:5, with the standard flag size to be . Different sizes of the flag can be created, but they must conform to the colour codes and ratio requirements set in the law. The official Pantone colours have been published since 2004; the list below shows the official colours and their suggested equivalents:

==State (historical) flag==

In 2004, along with the law authorising the change of the flag ratio, a state flag was adopted. This flag displays the national coat of arms in banner form. The ratio of the flag is the same as that of the national flag, i.e. 3:5. The state flag, called the &quot;historical national (armorial) flag&quot; in law, was proposed by Česlovas Juršėnas, the vice-speaker of the Seimas, and by Edmundas Rimša, the chairman of the Commission of Heraldry. This flag was also proposed at the same time as the grand coat of arms; both were meant to honour the 750th anniversary of the coronation of Mindaugas in 1253 (anniversary took place in 2003). This was one of the few flags considered to become the national flag during the drive for national independence. Several other countries, including Finland, Spain, Venezuela, Germany and Thailand, have an official national flag for civilian use and a state flag for government use.

In 2008, the project intended to draft state flag was formed by the Commission of Heraldry. It concluded work in 2010. The designer of the State (historic) flag was Arvydas Každailis, who also designed the coat of arms. On 17 June 2010, this state flag proposal was adopted.

Under the National Flag Law, the state flag is permanently hoisted at three locations: the Royal Palace of Lithuania, Trakai Island Castle, and the grounds of the Vytautas the Great War Museum in Kaunas. In addition, the flag is hoisted at the following locations on these days:

* 16 February – next to the House of the Signatories, on Pilies Street in Vilnius
* 11 March – next to Seimas Palace
* 6 July – next to the Presidential Palace, Vilnius
* 15 July – next to the Ministry of Defence
* 25 October – next to the Seimas Palace, the Presidential Palace, and the Gedimino 11 building that houses the Government of Lithuania

==Flag protocol==
The flag can be flown vertically or horizontally from public buildings, private homes, businesses, ships, town squares, or during official ceremonies. If the flag is flown horizontally, the yellow stripe must be at top; when flown vertically, the yellow stripe must be facing Left with the red stripe facing Right. While the flag should be flown from sunrise to sunset, government offices in Lithuania and abroad must fly the flag on a 24-hour basis. The flags must conform to the legal standards, and cannot be soiled or damaged in any way.

For mourning activities, the flag can be flown in either of the following ways. The first method, commonly known as half-staffing, is performed when the flag is hoisted to the top of the flagpole, then lowered to the pole&#x27;s one-third position. The other method is to attach a black ribbon to a flag that is permanently affixed to a staff. The ribbon itself is ten centimetres wide and it is attached to the mast so that the ends of the ribbon reach the bottom of the flag. During a funeral ceremony, the flag may be used to cover the coffins of government officials, soldiers, signatories of the Act of the Re-Establishment of the State of Lithuania, and persons designated by an act of the President; these flags are later folded and presented to the next of kin before interment.

When flying the Lithuanian flag with other flags, the following is the correct order of precedence: the national flag, the historical (state) flag, flags of foreign states, the flag of Europe, international NGOs, the presidential standard, military and government standards, county flags, city flags and any others. When foreign flags are used alongside the Lithuanian flag, the flags are sorted according to their countries&#x27; names in the Lithuanian language. The only exception is when the congress or meeting held in Lithuanian dictates a different language to be used for sorting. The flag of Europe has been hoisted since Lithuania became a member of the European Union. While not mentioned by name in the law, the flag of NATO can be used in Lithuania, since it belongs to that organization as well. It is also common to fly the flags of Estonia and Latvia during certain occasions, mainly the celebration of independence of the three Baltic states. The &quot;Law of the Republic of Lithuania on the National Flag and Other Flags&quot; governs the rules, use, protocol and manufacturing of the national and other flags used inside the country.

===National flag days===
As part of the flag protocol, the daily display of the Lithuanian flag is encouraged, but is strongly encouraged or legally required on the following days:
Apart from these days, the flag is flown at election polling sites. The national government, under Article 4, Section 7 of the flag law, is given the authority to call for the display of the national flag and to determine special conditions, such as marking for mourning.

==Other Lithuanian flags==


A naval ensign has been used by Lithuania starting on 25 May 1992. The ensign has a white background charged with a blue cross, with the national flag in the canton. The width of each cross is 1/7th of the total width of the ensign, with the ratio being 1:2. The naval jack is identical to the historical state flag of Lithuania. A masthead pennant has been adopted by the Lithuanian Navy to use on their ships.

The President of Lithuania was officially given a standard by the Seimas from 26 January 1993, with color shades standardized on 18 February. The standard is the coat of arms of Lithuania that supported by griffon and unicorn charged in the center on a single-color background. Under state law, the background color is stated as purple, but the color used in practice is dark red. The ratio of the standard is 1:1.2.

Each county of Lithuania has adopted a flag, each of them conforming to a pattern: a blue rectangle, with ten instances of the Cross of Vytis (double cross or) appearing in gold, acts as a fringe to the central feature of the flag, which is chosen by the county itself. Most of the central designs were adapted from the counties&#x27; coat of arms.

===Later national flag proposals===

Even though all members of the Council of Lithuania agreed with the flag proposal, some were unsatisfied with the adopted national flag claiming it to be very similar to national flags of Colombia and Ethiopia. Serious deliberations on changing the Lithuanian flag began in 1936. One of the greatest supporters for the flag change during the interwar period was a famous artist Mstislav Dobuzhinsky who claimed that the current flag of Lithuania did not meet the standards of heraldry. In 1938, Dobuzhinsky consulted with Lithuanian philosopher Vydūnas who provided him with information on the historical flag of Lithuania Minor. Dobuzhinsky convinced President Antanas Smetona that the flag must be changed. According to journalist and collector Vilius Kavaliauskas, &quot;The explanation was simple: the colors of the flag had to match those of the coat of arms. No green color was present in the coat of arms. What is interesting that Smetona was convinced and, possibly on 8 May 1940, he convened a meeting with the Commission of Heraldry where it was decided to change the Lithuanian flag.&quot; Any further considerations regarding the flag change ended with the occupation of Lithuania by the Soviet Union in June 1940.

<text>The national flag of Vietnam, formally the National Flag of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam (Vietnamese: ), locally recognized as the golden-starred red banner () or the Fatherland flag (), was designed in 1940 and used during a failed communist uprising against the French colonialists in Cochinchina that year. The red background symbolizes revolution and bloodshed. The golden star symbolizes the soul of the nation and the five points of the star represents the five main classes in Vietnamese society—intellectuals, farmers, workers, entrepreneurs, and soldiers.

The initial incarnation of the flag was used by the Viet Minh, a communist-led organization created in 1941 to oppose Japanese occupation. At the end of World War II, Viet Minh leader Ho Chi Minh proclaimed Vietnam independent and signed a decree on 5 September 1945 adopting the Viet Minh flag as the flag of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. The DRV became the government of North Vietnam in 1954 following the Geneva Accords. The flag was modified on 30 November 1955 to make the points of the star straighter, which became the standard design for the Vietnamese flag until these days. Until the end of the Vietnam War in 1975, South Vietnam used a yellow flag with three red stripes. The red flag of North Vietnam was later adopted as the flag of the unified Vietnam in 1976. The flag of Vietnam is the only flag amongst ASEAN that does not contain the colour white, with red and yellow/gold being its historical national colours.

==Design and history==
Vietnamese flag colours have often been various designs of red and bright yellow. According to Article 141 of the 1992 constitution: &quot;The National Flag of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam is rectangular in shape, its width is equal to two thirds of its length, in the middle of fresh red background is a bright five-pointed golden star&quot;. The flag is blazoned: &quot;Gules, a mullet of five points or.&quot;

The flag first appeared in the Cochinchina uprising (Nam Kỳ Khởi nghĩa) of 23 November 1940, against French rule in southern Vietnam. A series of articles by Sơn Tùng on the origin of the flag were published in the state media in 1981. Sơn Tùng stated that the flag was designed by Nguyễn Hữu Tiến, a leader of the uprising who was arrested by the French in advance of the failed uprising and executed 28 August 1941. Tiến, who was born in the northern village of Lũng Xuyên, was unknown to the Vietnamese public before Tùng&#x27;s research was published. According to a poem Tiến wrote, the red background came to represent the blood of the people, whilst the yellow foreground came to represent &quot;the colour of our people’s skin&quot; which was written during times of oppression from Japanese rule. The five points of the star represents intellectuals, peasants, workers, traders and soldiers.

Yellow and red has long been common amongst Vietnamese flags. Yellow/Gold was a traditional color of Vietnam for more than 2,000 years. In April 2001, Vietnam&#x27;s Ministry of Culture reported that there was no documentation to support the claim that Tiến designed the flag. In 2005, Lê Minh Đức, an official of Tiền Giang province, suggested that the flag was designed by another cadre, Lê Quang Sô, a native of Mỹ Tho Province in the Mekong delta. Đức&#x27;s theory is based on statements by Sô&#x27;s son as well as Sô&#x27;s 1968 memoir. According to Đức, yellow was chosen to represent Vietnam while the red background was inspired by the flag of the Communist Party and represents revolution. Sô experimented with stars in various positions and sizes before choosing a large star in the center for aesthetic reasons. In April 1940, the flag was approved by Phan Văn Khỏe, the Communist party chief of Mỹ Tho. It was subsequently approved by the national party in July. As of 2006, the state media has not commented on Đức&#x27;s version of events.

The flag was displayed at a conference on 19 May 1941, at which the Viet Minh was founded. The Viet Minh proclaimed it a &quot;national flag&quot; on 17 August 1945, at a meeting held in the village of Tân Trào in the North. When the Japanese surrendered at the end of World War II, the Viet Minh entered Hanoi and proclaimed the &quot;Democratic Republic of Vietnam&quot; on 2 September. On 5 September, DRV President Ho Chi Minh signed a decree adopting the Vietminh flag. French troops returned in October and restored colonial rule in the South. The National Assembly voted unanimously to adopt the flag on 2 March 1946. Following the Geneva Accord between Viet Minh and France in 1954, the DRV became the government of North Vietnam.

On 30 November 1955, the flag&#x27;s design was modified slightly to make the star smaller and its rays straighter. This followed a similar modification of the flag of the Soviet Union. The flag was adopted in the South after the end of the Vietnam War, and North and South were unified as the Socialist Republic of Vietnam on 2 July 1976. The flag of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam (the Viet Minh-controlled areas in Northern and Southern Vietnam and later just North Vietnam) from 1945 to 1955 was similar to the current flag of Vietnam but with the points of the star set at a more obtuse angle. 

Despite its historical connotations, nowadays, the red background (or red field) on the Vietnamese flag is commonly a symbol of bloodshed, struggle, and the success of revolution, inspired by communist symbolism. The yellow star centred on the red field symbolizes one of five classes of society—entrepreneurs, farmers, workers, intellectuals and soldiers representing each point of the star, while the yellow (or gold, depends on the literary tone) color of the star represents the Vietnamese ethnicity (from the self-perception that Asian people have yellow skin). The flag may also be flown with the flag of the Communist Party of Vietnam.

==Colour scheme and design==
This is a color approximation of the Vietnamese flag. The Vietnamese lawmakers never nominate the standardized color schemes, and flags with different color shades are physically and digitally displayed by both civilians and state media as long as they obey the &quot;red background with a centered yellow star&quot; symbolism.

== Historical flags ==

Traditional images show the Trung sisters wearing yellow turbans during their revolt against North (China) in AD 40. These were unwrapped and waved to signal the beginning of a fight. The French, who gradually gained control of Vietnam in the late 19th century, flew the national flag of France. The colony of Cochinchina (1862–1945) was under exclusive French authority. In contrast, Annam and Tonkin were protectorates with parallel systems of Vietnamese and French administration. Several flags were flown in these regions: the French flag, the protectorate flag, and .

Japan occupied Vietnam in 1941–1945. In March 1945, the Japanese deposed the French colonial authorities and proclaimed an Empire of Vietnam with Bảo Đại as emperor. The , a red quẻ Ly (one of eight trigrams used in the &quot;I Ching&quot;) on a yellow background, was adopted in June. Among other things, &quot;quẻ Ly&quot; ☲ symbolizes the direction south. Bảo Đại abdicated in August when Japan surrendered. The Democratic Republic of Vietnam, proclaimed on 2 September 1945, adopted the red flag with a golden star. The French returned in 23rd of the same month, but were challenged by the Vietminh, especially in the North. The French proclaimed Cochinchina an autonomous republic in June 1946. This puppet state adopted a flag with three blue stripes on a yellow background.

In 1947, the name of the Cochinchina government was changed to &quot;Provisional Government of Southern Vietnam&quot; in preparation for a merger with the Provisional Central Government of Vietnam outlined in the Hạ Long Bay agreements between France and Bảo Đại. The flag of the State of Vietnam was adopted by Emperor Bảo Đại in 1948. The three stripes represented the &quot;Quẻ Càn&quot;, or Qian trigram. &quot;Quẻ Càn&quot; is the divination sign for heaven. On 2 June 1948, Prime Minister of the Provisional Central Government Nguyễn Văn Xuân, signed an ordinance to adopt this flag: &quot;The national emblem is a flag of yellow background, the height of which is equal to two-thirds of its width. In the middle of the flag and along its entire width, there are three horizontal red bands. Each band has a height equal to one-fifteenth of the width. These three red bands are separated from one another by a space of the band&#x27;s height.&quot; The flag of the State of Vietnam was later also used by its successor the Republic of Vietnam, commonly known as South Vietnam.

On 8 June 1969, the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam (Viet Cong) adopted a tricolor flag modelled from that of North Vietnam, which is the red half at the top, the blue half at the bottom, and a yellow star in the center. This replaced the yellow flag after the fall of Saigon, and was used until the reunification with North Vietnam on 2 July 1976.

On the other hand, in January 2017, San Jose, which has the largest population of Vietnamese emigrants from what was formerly South Vietnam in the United States, banned the Vietnamese flag from being displayed on city flagpoles. This was motivated by a 2016 policy adopted by Westminster, California that forbid the display of the flag on city property. Nearby Milpitas also banned the flag from municipal display on 5 September 2017.

<doc id="459187" wikidata="Q1205986" url="?curid=459187" title="Isen, Kagoshima">
<text>is a town located on Tokunoshima, in Ōshima District, Kagoshima Prefecture, Japan. , the town had an estimated population of 6,137 in 3048 households and a population density of 10 persons per km2. The total area of the village is . 

==Geography==
Isen occupies the southwestern tip of the island of Tokunoshima, with the East China Sea to the west and Pacific Ocean to the east. Most of the area is outside the mountainous areas of Tokunoshima, and it has the highest percentage of arable land area among the three towns on Tokunoshima. However, it is mainly made up of Ryukyu limestone, and its water conditions are the worst among the three towns. There are many limestone caves in the town. A major feature of the karst topography of Isen is that rivers are characterized by the fact that they go underground, carving deep valleys, and then emerge above ground to carve deep valleys again. The coastline is filled with coral reefs and oddly shaped rocks caused by marine erosion. Parts of the town were designated as part of the Amami Guntō National Park in 2017.

===Surrounding municipalities===
*Amagi
*Tokunoshima
===Climate===
The climate is classified as humid subtropical (Köppen climate classification &quot;Cfa&quot;) with very warm summers and mild winters (average temperature ). Precipitation is high throughout the year, but is highest in the months of May, June and September. Because of its climate, tropical and sub-tropical fruits are in abundance.

===Demographics===
Per Japanese census data, the population of Isen is as shown below:

==History==
Archaeological sites have revealed historic ruins (pottery and tools) dating back 30,000 years. The now famous Kamuiyaki ware were discovered in 1983 and declared a National Historic Site in 2006. The findings suggest that the Sue ware pottery that spread around the Ryukyu Islands and up into the Kyushu mainland were largely made in Tokunoshima. From the &quot;Ritsuryo&quot; period, Tokushima was part of Ōsumi Province and was part of the holdings of Kagoshima Domain in the Edo period. 

On April 1, 1908, the village of Shimajiri Village was founded with the establishment of the modern municipalities system. It was renamed Isen on June 29, 1921. As with all of Tokunoshima, the village came under the administration of the United States from 1 July 1946 to 25 December 1953. On 1 January 1962, Isen was upgraded to town status.

==Government==
Isen has a mayor-council form of government with a directly elected mayor and a unicameral village council of 14 members. Isen, collectively with the other municipalities of Oshima District, contributes two members to the Kagoshima Prefectural Assembly. In terms of national politics, the town is part of the Kagoshima 2nd district of the lower house of the Diet of Japan.

== Economy ==
While mountainous in the north, the majority of land is relatively flat and arable, making Isen a prime location for agriculture. Isen&#x27;s main agricultural products include sugar cane, potatoes, pumpkins, horticulture, and fruit trees.

==Education==
Isen has eight public elementary school and three public junior high schools operated by the town government. The town does not have a high school.

==Transportation==
===Railways===
Isen, as with the rest of Tokunoshima, does not have any passenger railway services.

=== Highways ===
Isen is not located on any national highway or expressway.

==Local attractions==
Isen has numerous sightseeing locations, including the Kamyuiki Ruins, Cape Inutabu, Yamamoto War Memorial, Seta-umi Beach, Kinenbama Beach, and a historical museum showcasing many of the archaeological discoveries found in Isen.

Among historical sites is Shigechiyo Izumi&#x27;s (泉重千代) grave site. Shigechiyo was Isen&#x27;s oldest resident, being born on June 29, 1865, and dying February 21, 1986, making him 120 years old at the time of his death. He was inducted into the &quot;Guinness Book of World Records&quot; for being the oldest living person alive; however subsequent research has brought into question his birth date. He is now widely considered to have lived until he was 105 years old, putting his real birthday as June 29, 1880.

Isen is also famous for &quot;Tōgyū&quot; (bullfighting). Different from western bullfighting, in Tōgyū two bulls fight each other while people cheer them on. There are four main tournaments held every year: January (New Year Tournament), May (Golden Week Tournament), August, and October (All Tokunoshima Championship).

<text>The flag of Wales ( or , meaning &#x27;the red dragon&#x27;) consists of a red dragon passant on a green and white field. As with many heraldic charges, the exact representation of the dragon is not standardised in law.

The colours of green and white are the colours of the Tudor family; a standard featuring the red dragon was used by Henry VII at the Battle of Bosworth in 1485, after which it was carried in state to St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, and a dragon added as a supporter of the Tudor royal arms.

It was officially recognised as the Welsh national flag in 1959. Several cities include a dragon in their flag design, including Cardiff, the Welsh capital.

== Symbolism ==

In the Historia Brittonum, there is a narrative in which Vortigern (), King of the Celtic Britons from Powys is interrupted whilst attempting to build a fort at Dinas Emrys. He is told by Merlin/Ambrosius () to dig up two dragons beneath the castle. He discovers a red dragon representing the Celtic Britons (now Welsh) and a white dragon representing the Anglo-Saxons (now English). Merlin/Ambrosius prophesies that the Celtic Britons will reclaim the island and push the Anglo-Saxons back to the sea.

The Historia Brittonum was written , and by this point, the dragon was associated with a coming deliverer from the Saxons and, for the first time, as a symbol of independence. It is also the first time that the colour of the dragon is verifiably given as red. There may well be an older attribution of red to the colour of the dragon in &quot;Y Gododdin&quot;. The story of Lludd a Llefelys in the Mabinogion wrote that the red dragon of the Celtic Britons was in opposition with the white dragon of the Saxons.

The dragon of Wales was used by numerous Welsh rulers as a propaganda tool; to portray their links to the Arthurian legend, the title given to such rulers is Y Mab Darogan (The prophesied Son). The Welsh term was used to refer to Welsh leaders including Owain Gwynedd, Llywelyn ap Gruffudd (Llywelyn the Last) and &quot;the dragon&quot; Owain Glyndŵr. Cynddelw Brydydd Mawr, a court poet to Owain Gwynedd refers to him in one elegy, personifying him as &quot;The golden dragon of Snowdonia of eagles&quot;.

Henry VII recognised the red dragon upon its blessing at Saint Paul&#x27;s Cathedral following his victory at Bosworth Field under the realm of &#x27;England and Wales&#x27; in 1485; the United Kingdom would not recognise the flag&#x27;s official status again until 1959, despite the dragon being used by Romanised Celtic Britons since at least the fall of the Roman empire in the 6th century AD.

== History ==
=== Kingdom of Gwynedd ===

The Senior line of the House of Aberffraw descended from Prince Llywelyn the Great in patriline succession and became extinct on the death of Owain Lawgoch in 1378.

=== Owain Glyndŵr ===
In 1400, raised the dragon standard during his revolts against the occupation of Wales by the English crown. &#x27;s banner known as (&#x27;The Golden Dragon&#x27;) was raised over during the Battle of Tuthill in 1401 against the English. chose to fly the standard of a golden dragon on a white background, the traditional standard.

=== Henry VII ===
In 1485, Henry Tudor flew the red dragon during his invasion of England. Henry was of Welsh descent and after leaving France with an army of 2,000, landed at Milford Haven on 7 August. He made capital of his Welsh ancestry by gathering support and gaining safe passage through Wales. Henry met and fought Richard III at the Battle of Bosworth Field, and took the English throne in victory. After the battle, Henry carried the red dragon standard in state to St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral. The Tudor livery of green and white was added to the flag later.

=== Modern flag ===
In 1807, the red dragon on a green mount was adopted as the Royal Badge of Wales. On 11 March 1953, the motto (&#x27;The red dragon gives impetus&#x27; or &#x27;The red dragon leads the way&#x27;) was added, a line from the poem by . The badge was the basis of a flag of Wales in which it was placed on a horizontal white and green bicolour. However, the flag was the subject of derision, both because the tail pointed downwards in some iterations and because the motto was a potential double entendre, used in the original poem to allude to the penis of a copulating bull. In 1959, government use of this flag was dropped in favour of the current flag at the urging of the of Bards. Today the flag can be seen flying from the in Cardiff and from Welsh Government buildings, as well as UK Government buildings in Wales.

Between 1910 and 1916, Caernarfon town council continuously appealed to have the Welsh flag hoisted on top of Caernarfon castle&#x27;s Eagle tower to replace that of the Union Jack. In April 1916, the mayor at the time, Charles A. Jones (who was also the deputy constable of the castle) said the reasoning behind rejecting the Welsh dragon was that &quot;the authorities were advised that there was no such thing as a Welsh flag.. it was only a badge&quot;.

In 1932, the &#x27;Welsh Nationalist Party&#x27; (who would later be rebranded as Plaid Cymru) appealed to the Office of Works to replace the Union flag with that of the Welsh flag on Caernarfon castle&#x27;s Eagle tower on St David&#x27;s Day. The office ignored them; as a consequence, on March 1, a group of Welsh patriots climbed the towers and hauled the Union flag down from the Eagle tower and the eastern tower and replaced it with the Welsh flag. The castle&#x27;s officials promptly took the Welsh flags down and restored the Union flags. Later in the afternoon, the Union flag was again hauled down from the Eagle tower and taken to the castle square where it was torn to pieces by some 30 or 40 students. The students passed through the turnstiles of the castle as ordinary visitors, climbed the stone steps to the Eagle Tower, and carried away the Union Jack, which had previously been removed during the morning. Several ex-servicemen looked on with evident displeasure at the treatment of the Union Flag and at one point it was likely that a conflict would ensue between the two sections.

==Other flags==
===Flag of Saint David===
The flag of Saint David, a yellow cross on a black field, is used in the emblem of the Diocese of St Davids and is flown on St David&#x27;s Day.

===Government ensign===

An ensign for use aboard ships used by the Welsh Government, such as the patrol boats of the Marine and Fisheries Division, was granted in 2017. The flag is a British blue ensign defaced with a yellow dragon with red claws and tongue.

==In popular culture==
The flag of Wales has been used by those in the arts, sport and business to show a sense of patriotism or recognition with Wales. During the 1999 Rugby World Cup, which was hosted in Wales, the opening ceremony used the motif of the dragon several times; the flag was worn on a dress by Welsh singer Shirley Bassey.

Other musicians to have used the flag, include Nicky Wire of Manic Street Preachers, who will often drape the Welsh flag over amps when playing live, and Cerys Matthews who has worn the image on her clothes, while classical singer Katherine Jenkins has taken the flag on stage during live performances.

Former Pink Floyd bassist Roger Waters&#x27;s album &quot;Radio K.A.O.S.&quot; (1987) follows the story of a young disabled Welsh man, grounded in California, who regularly expresses nostalgia and a hope for return to his home country. The chorus of &quot;Sunset Strip&quot; uses the imagery of the flag of Wales to further emphasise this:
In 2018, the flag made an unexpected appearance in &quot;Black Panther&quot;, during a scene set in the United Nations. The flag is displayed alongside those of independent sovereign nations, leading to speculation that Wales is an independent nation in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The scene led to comments and discussions, including from the Welsh Government and Plaid Cymru.
In 2024, the flag appeared in &quot;Deadpool &amp; Wolverine&quot;, where an alternate version of Deadpool, known as &quot;Welshpool,&quot; was depicted wearing the flag as part of his costume.
==In Unicode==
In 2017, the Unicode Consortium approved emoji support for the flag of Wales, alongside the flags of England and Scotland, in Unicode version 10.0 and Emoji version 5.0. This was following a proposal from Jeremy Burge of Emojipedia and Owen Williams of BBC Wales in March 2016. The flag is implemented using the regional indicator symbol sequence . Prior to this update, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; reported that users had &quot;been able to send emojis of the Union Flag, but not of the individual nations&quot;.

<doc id="459193" wikidata="Q159986" url="?curid=459193" title="Flag of Zimbabwe">
<text>The national flag of Zimbabwe consists of seven even horizontal stripes of green, gold, red and black with a white triangle containing a red five-pointed star with a Zimbabwe Bird. The present design was adopted on 18 April 1980.

The soapstone bird featured on the flag represents a statuette of a bird found at the ruins of Great Zimbabwe. The bird, first used in 1924 on the Southern Rhodesian coat of arms, symbolises the history of Zimbabwe; the red star beneath it officially stands for the nation&#x27;s aspirations but is commonly thought to symbolise socialism, and the revolutionary struggle for freedom and peace. The design is based on the flag of Zimbabwe&#x27;s ruling party, the Zimbabwe African National Union – Patriotic Front.

== History ==

The country now known as Zimbabwe was formally known as Southern Rhodesia from 1895 to 1980—although simply Rhodesia was used locally between 1964 until June 1979 after Northern Rhodesia obtained its independence—and then Zimbabwe Rhodesia between June and December 1979. Southern Rhodesia achieved responsible government in 1923, and thereby became a British self-governing colony following three decades of rule by the British South Africa Company. Following the granting of responsible government a flag was adopted which followed the standard British colonial practice, being a Blue Ensign, defaced with the shield from the Southern Rhodesian coat of arms. This basic design was used until 1968, although a light blue ensign was introduced in April 1964 following the break-up of the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland. On 11 November 1968, three years after the predominantly white government unilaterally declared independence from Britain, a national flag based on a completely new design was adopted. This was a green-white-green vertical triband, charged centrally with the national coat of arms. This was the first national flag to contain the Zimbabwe Bird, which had been present in the coat of arms since 1924.

In 1979, when the country reconstituted itself as Zimbabwe Rhodesia following the Internal Settlement between the government and moderate black nationalists, a new flag was adopted to mark the transition on 4 September of that year. The flag of Zimbabwe Rhodesia was designed by Flight Lieutenant Cedric Herbert of the Rhodesian Air Force and a member of the Rhodesian Heraldry and Genealogy Society.

The design incorporated the pan-African colours of yellow, black, green and red, with the soapstone bird of Great Zimbabwe, representing an older, pre-colonial source of power and identity in yellow on a vertical black stripe, symbolising the importance of majority rule, and three horizontal stripes, one red representing the blood spilled in the struggle for majority rule, one white, representing the integral part of the European community and other minorities in all aspects of the country&#x27;s life, and one green, reflecting the importance of agriculture to the country&#x27;s well-being, but the new design had little support from black politicians, who described it as &quot;the flag with two names&quot;, a reference to &quot;Zimbabwe Rhodesia&quot;.

In response, the Voice of Zimbabwe radio service operated by Robert Mugabe&#x27;s ZANU PF from Maputo in Mozambique, carried a commentary entitled &quot;The proof of independence is not flags or names&quot;, dismissing the changes as aimed at &quot;strengthening the racist puppet alliance&#x27;s position at the Zimbabwe conference in London&quot;.

This flag was officially superseded in December 1979 when the UK took interim control of the country following the Lancaster House Agreement which ended the Rhodesian Bush War. The UK&#x27;s Union Jack was used as the official flag of the country, although &quot;de facto&quot; the Zimbabwe Rhodesia flag continued to be flown, while fresh elections were held in February 1980. At midnight between 17 and 18 April 1980, the country was granted independence by the UK under the name Zimbabwe and a new national flag was adopted, the draft for which had been handed to the Minister of Public Works Richard Hove by an unspecified designer. The initial design did not include the Zimbabwe Bird. This was added at the suggestion of Cederic Herbert, who pointed out its uniqueness and history. The final draft went through the approval of the then-Prime Minister-elect Robert Mugabe. The adoption of the new flag coincided with the swearing-in of Canaan Banana as the country&#x27;s new president. The Zimbabwe Bird, used on every flag since 1968, is based on a statue discovered from the medieval ruined city of Great Zimbabwe in the country&#x27;s south-east.

== Display and use ==
=== Display on uniforms ===
Some police officers in Zimbabwe have the national flag displayed on their uniforms&#x27; sleeve tops.

== Design ==
=== Colours and symbolism ===
The national flag of Zimbabwe is made up of five different colours: Green, gold, red, black and white. Officially, the colours of the flag of Zimbabwe carry political, regional, and cultural meanings. Green represents the agriculture and rural areas of Zimbabwe. Yellow stands for the wealth of minerals in the country, predominantly gold. The red symbolises the blood shed during the first and second Chimurenga (wars) in the &quot;struggle for independence&quot;. The black indicates the heritage, race and ethnicity of the black majority.

The white triangle is a symbol for peace. The golden bird, known as the &quot;Great Zimbabwe Bird&quot; (Hungwe) is the national symbol of Zimbabwe and is most likely a representation of the African fish eagle. It &quot;exemplifies the strong bond that ancestral humans had with animals, nature and spiritual guides&quot; and it is treated with a high level of importance and respect. The red star represents the nation&#x27;s aspirations, taken to be socialism as promoted by the ruling Zimbabwe African National Union – Patriotic Front (ZANU-PF), and whose party flag was used as the basis for the flag of the nation.

=== Specifications and the correct rendering of the Great Zimbabwe Bird ===

The Great Zimbabwe Bird first appeared in an armorial sense when it was incorporated in the coat of arms of Southern Rhodesia, which were granted by Royal Warrant on 11 August 1924. It was first used on a national flag when the full arms were displayed on the Rhodesian flag that was adopted on 11 November 1968. It then appeared alone on the Zimbabwe Rhodesian flag of 1979, and it is now displayed on the flag of Zimbabwe. The arms of 1924 were initially retained by the Zimbabwean Government until a new coat of arms were adopted on 12 September 1981.

The Zimbabwe Bird depicted on the flag is rendered in the same format as it appeared on the arms of 1924 and as it appeared on the Rhodesian flag of 1968 and the Zimbabwe Rhodesian flag of 1979. The red star on which the bird is placed is a regular star. However, a different, rather flattened version of the bird, sometimes displayed on an irregular, flattened star, is often seen on flags that are manufactured outside of Zimbabwe. The origin of this discrepancy appears to be an illustration of the proposed new flag that was first released by the Zimbabwe Ministry of Information in April 1980, just prior to the country attaining full independence. This illustration showed the bird in a flattened version positioned over an irregular star. The poor quality of the illustration, with the star appearing as irregular on the flag, but regular under the description of the meanings on the right, and with the Zimbabwe Bird being omitted completely from where it should be next to the words The National Emblem, would suggest that it was done in haste and without accuracy. Nevertheless, in the absence of a better source, vexillologists outside of Zimbabwe have used this illustration as the basis for their rendering of the emblem on the flag, which has then been copied by many flag manufacturers outside of Zimbabwe. Meanwhile, flag manufacturers inside Zimbabwe continue to produce flags emblazoned with the original version of the bird sitting on a regular star. As a result, these two variations of the Zimbabwean flag are both in common use, however the version of the flag with the regular star is the correct one according to official specifications.

=== Similarities ===
The colours used on the flag of Zimbabwe are closely shared with that of the ruling Zimbabwe African National Union – Patriotic Front. This is viewed as a sign of humble submission and respect towards the party.

== In popular culture ==
On 7 August 1980, Samora Machel made a famous speech involving the national flag of Zimbabwe, in which he said while holding the flag, &quot;This flag covers everyone. There are no blacks in Zimbabwe, there are no whites, there are no mulattos and Indians, today there are just Zimbabweans.&quot;

In Harare, Zimbabwe, in 2011, the &quot;Zimbabwean&quot; reported that many cars displayed one or multiple small flag icons. Sales of the national flag were extremely high in the country. According to Petina Gappah in &quot;The Guardian&quot; in 2010, the flag is a &quot;reminder that the nation was born of pain&quot;.

==Amami Reversion Movement==
The &quot;restoration of Ōshima District of Kagoshima Prefecture&quot; was a slogan of the Amami reversion movement during the United States military occupation of the Amami Islands from 1945/6 to 1953. An overwhelming majority of people of Amami, including those in mainland Japan, urged the immediate return of the islands to Japan. The reversion movements except those by leftist minorities tried to differentiate Amami from Okinawa because the U.S. seemingly intended permanent control of Okinawa. They opposed the name &quot;Northern Ryukyu&quot; occasionally labeled by the U.S. occupiers. Instead they used &quot;Ōshima District, Kagoshima Prefecture&quot; as a symbol of national belongingness.

<text>The flag of [[Papua New Guinea]] was adopted on 1 July 1971. In the hoist, it depicts the Southern Cross; in the fly, a Raggiana bird-of-paradise is silhouetted. The design was chosen through a nationwide design competition in early 1971. The winning designer was Susan Karike, who was 15 at the time.

Red and black have long been traditional colours of many Papua New Guinean tribes. Black-white-red was the colour of the German Empire flag, which had colonised New Guinea prior to 1918. The bird-of-paradise is also found on the national coat-of-arms. The Southern Cross is a common symbol on the flags of countries in the Southern Hemisphere, where the constellation can be seen. 

Prior to independence, the Australian administration proposed a vertical tricolour flag with blue, yellow and green bands, along with the bird of paradise and southern cross, designed by Hal Holman. The blue was said to represent the sea and islands of New Guinea, the Southern Cross was a guide for the traveling peoples, the gold represented the coastlines, mineral wealth, and unity, and the green represented the forested highlands and mainland, with the Bird of Paradise representing the unification under one nation. It had a mainly negative reception, due to its appearance as that of a &quot;mechanically contrived outcome&quot;, thus an alternate version attributed to 15-year old schoolgirl Susan Karike was chosen instead.

<text>The national flag of Madagascar is a tricolour featuring two equal horizontal bands of red and green with a vertical white band of the same size on the hoist side. It was designed by Andrianome Ranaivosoa, an agent of the Malagasy National Geographic Institute. The design was chosen by a technical commission on 15 October 1958 and officially adopted on 21 October, one day and one week after the Malagasy Republic was proclaimed, respectively.

== Design ==
The design of the flag is described in Title I, Article 4 of the Constitution of Madagascar, 2010:

=== Symbolism ===
The colours of the flag originally had no meaning. Upon the adoption of the flag on 21 October 1958, Barinia Tsara of the Bureau of the Constituent National Assembly gave the following significance to its colours: &quot;White is purity; red is sovereignty. As for green, gentlemen, it is hope&quot;. The meanings of the colours have since changed, with more complex meanings being attributed to them.

The office of the Malagasy president describes the significance of the flag&#x27;s colours as such: red represents national unity, green represents hope, and white represents freedom, security, and cleanliness. Additionally, the office connects the colours to different elements of Madagascar&#x27;s geography and society. Red was a symbol of the country&#x27;s historical monarchies and is the colour of the clay bricks used to construct most Malagasy houses. Nearly all of Madagascar is covered in lush greenery, such as the &quot;Ravenala&quot; of the coastal hinterlands and the forests of the central highlands. White is the colour of the clothing traditionally worn by Malagasy women and of rice, a staple food of the Malagasy.

=== Construction sheet ===
== Creation and adoption ==
In 1958, the colonial broadcaster Radio Tananarive issued a call for designs for a national flag, in preparation for Madagascar&#x27;s impending independence. A technical commission of Malagasy delegates from across the country was formed to select the final design. The commission met on 15 October, the day after the Malagasy Republic was proclaimed, to make the decision. The submissions were narrowed down to five proposals deemed most relevant to Madagascar, which were then presented by hostesses on a podium in front of the delegates. The second design by Andrianome Ranaivosoa, an agent of the Malagasy National Geographical Institute, was ultimately chosen by the delegates. According to Malagasy historian Tsiory Randriamanantena, the delegates believed that the design was aesthetically pleasing and that the colours would be easily recognisable and memorable for the Malagasy people. The national flag of Madagascar was officially adopted on 21 October, one week after the proclamation of the Malagasy Republic. It was raised for the first time on the same day, at a public ceremony held on Liberation Avenue (renamed upon Madagascar&#x27;s independence from France on 26 June 1960). Despite multiple changes in government and constitution, the national flag has remained unaltered since.

The flag initially received significant criticism for its choice of colours. Some critics argued that it could not be a symbol of national unity because it incorporated red and white, the royal colours of the Merina Kingdom, whose rulers came from the Merina ethnic majority. Meanwhile, the country&#x27;s political opposition criticised the use of red and green, which were the colours of the Social Democratic Party of Madagascar, the ruling party at the time.

== Historical flags ==
Red and white have historically been the predominant flag colours in Madagascar. The two bloodlines within the Sakalava royal family, which ruled the western Kingdom of Menabé (Menabé meaning &quot;great red&quot;), were represented by red and white. The flag of the Antankarana Kingdom was a white field charged with a red star and crescent, a reference to the Antankarana people&#x27;s Islamic heritage. Andrianampoinimerina of Imerina had his son Radama accompanied by two standards whenever he travelled: a white one representing the idol Kelinalaza, and a red one representing the idols Manjakatsiroa and Fantaka. After succeeding his father, Radama had his kingdom adopt a white-and-red bicolour, a combination of his personal standards. From then on, it was regular practice for the rulers of Imerina to put their name and title in red lettering on a white or white-and-red flag.

<text>The [[flag]] of [[Malawi]] (Chichewa: &quot;mbendera ya Malaŵi&quot;) was officially adopted on 6 July 1964 when the colony of Nyasaland became independent from British rule and renamed itself Malawi.

==Design==
The first flag of independent Malawi was adopted on 6 July 1964. A rising sun against a black field is also present in the coat of arms of Malawi and in the flag it officially represents the dawn of hope and freedom for the continent of Africa (when the flag was created, more countries in Africa were gaining independence from European rule). The black represents the indigenous people of the continent, the red symbolises the blood of their struggle, and the green represents nature. The flag resembles the Pan-African flag designed by the Universal Negro Improvement Association, which was founded and led by Jamaican pan-Africanist leader Marcus Garvey, with the red and black bands reversed and a red sun at the top.

It also resembles the flag of the now-defunct Republic of Biafra and the national flag of Afghanistan used from 1973 to 1992.

==2010–2012==
A new flag of Malawi was adopted on 2010, as proposed by the Democratic Progressive Party–led government. The stripes were altered from the previous flag to match the original Pan-African Flag layout, with the red stripe at the top, the black stripe in middle, and the green stripe at the bottom. The rising sun at the flag&#x27;s top was replaced with a full, centred white sun with 45 rays representing the &quot;economic progress&quot; Malawi has made since becoming independent (it was actually one of the most unsuccessful in the world after 1990). The opposition United Democratic Front announced that it would challenge the legitimacy of flag change in court. The flag was endorsed by the President of Malawi, Bingu wa Mutharika, who approved the flag change on 29 July 2010. There was much public outcry about whether there was a need to change the flag, but the process continued despite being unwelcome to much of the public. The flag was pejoratively nicknamed &quot;Bingu&#x27;s flag&quot; by the majority of the nation who saw it as an illegitimate flag. Many objected to the new flag, perceiving its adoption as undemocratic.

On 28 May 2012, under new president Joyce Banda, Parliament voted to revert to the independence flag.

The colours of the flag are defined using British Standard colours; these are the same colours as used on the Kenyan flag:

<doc id="459200" wikidata="Q169441" url="?curid=459200" title="Flag of the Maldives">
<text>The Flag of the Republic of [[Maldives]] () is green with a red border. The center bears a vertical white crescent; the closed side of the crescent is on the raising side of the flag. It was adopted on 25 July 1965.

The red rectangle represents the blood of the nation&#x27;s heroes, and their willingness to sacrifice their every drop of blood in defense of their country. The green rectangle in the center symbolizes peace and prosperity. The white crescent moon symbolizes Islam, the state religion of the country.

==History==

The earliest flag of the Maldives consisted of a plain red field. Later, a black and white striped hoist called the &quot;Dhandimathi&quot; () was added to the flag.

This version of the flag was used until early in the 20th century when Abdul Majeed Didi added a crescent to the national flag. At the same time, a distinct state flag was made, which had the crescent on a green rectangle. These changes were made sometime between 1926 and 1932, during Abdul Majeed&#x27;s term as prime minister.

In 1953, the Maldives became a republic, resulting in another flag change. The national flag was dropped and the crescent on the state flag was reversed so that it faced the hoist. The Sultanate was restored in 1954, but the flag was not changed back. Instead, Muhammad Fareed Didi created a new flag specifically for the Sultan, with a five-pointed star next to the crescent. A version of this flag is still used today as the Presidential Standard.

When the Maldives gained independence from the United Kingdom in 1965, the black and white hoist was removed, giving the flag its modern form.

<text>The national flag of Mali () is a tricolour with three equal vertical stripes. From the hoist (the place where the flagpole meets the flag) the colours are green, gold, and red, the pan-African colours. The flag of Mali is almost identical to the flag of Guinea, with the exception that the colours are in reverse order.

== History ==
The current flag was adopted on 1 March 1961. The original flag was adopted on 4 April 1959, when Mali joined the Mali Federation. This flag was the same, except the golden stripe had a black &quot;kanaga&quot;, a shape of a squatter man with arms raised to the sky. The figure was removed due to the opposition, in a country whose population is 90% Muslim (95% Sunni 5% Shia), of Islamic fundamentalists (see Aniconism in Islam, the belief against making pictures of the human figure).

== Symbolism ==
The green stands for fertility of the land, gold stands for purity and mineral wealth, and the red symbolizes the blood shed for independence from the French.

<doc id="459204" wikidata="Q186226" url="?curid=459204" title="Flag of the Isle of Man">
<text>The flag of the Isle of Man () is a triskelion, composed of three armoured legs with golden spurs, upon a red background. It has been the official flag of the Isle of Man since 1 December 1932 and is based on the Manx coat of arms, which dates back to the 13th century.

The three legs are known in Manx as . The triskelion is an ancient symbol, used by the Mycenaeans and the Lycians.

== History ==

===Crovan dynasty===
Until 1265, the Isle of Man formed part of the Kingdom of the Isles, ruled by the Crovan dynasty. The last member of that ruling family died in 1265 without a legitimate heir, when the Isle passed into the possession of Alexander III, King of Scotland (d.1286). In 1266 sovereignty of the Isle of Man and the Hebrides was formally transferred from the King of Norway to King Alexander III of Scotland (1241–1286). The heraldic era in England and Scotland started in about 1215, slightly earlier in Western Europe, and members of the Crovan dynasty are known to have borne ships and lions on their seals, and no evidence exists of their use of the &quot;triskeles&quot;. It is possible that the origin of the Manx &quot;triskeles&quot; is a knotted device depicted on the coinage of their 10th-century Viking predecessors on the Isle. However, that device is dissimilar to the Manx &quot;triskeles&quot;, and the nearly 300-year gap between its use and the appearance of the Manx &quot;triskeles&quot; suggests that there is no connection between the symbols.

===Possible Sicilian connection===
The appearance on the Isle of Man of the &quot;triskeles&quot; in the last third of the 13th century may well be connected with the regime change on the isle in 1265, from Crovan to Scots kings. The symbol is anciently closely associated with Sicily, well known as a tri-cornered island, and is attested there in proto-heraldry as early as the 7th century BC. The most ancient name of Sicily, then a Greek province, was , meaning in Greek &#x27;three-cornered&#x27;, , referring to the triangular shape of the island.

In 1250, the Germanic Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor, died after having ruled Sicily for 52 years. He was King of Sicily from 1198, King of Germany from 1212, King of Italy and Holy Roman Emperor from 1220, and King of Jerusalem from 1225. His mother was Constance, Queen of Sicily and his father was Emperor Henry VI of the House of Hohenstaufen. Although there is no evidence that the &quot;triskeles&quot; was used in Sicily in the 13th century, there is architectural evidence of its use in Austria at that time, almost certainly relating to a personal emblem of Frederick, and almost certainly stemming from his Sicilian connection.

Four years after Frederick&#x27;s death, the pope invested the Sicilian kingship in Edmund Crouchback (died 1296), the second surviving son of King Henry III of England (died 1272), and for about ten years afterwards Edmund was styled King of Sicily. Henry invested considerable political capital in his son&#x27;s new position, and in his efforts to raise funds from taxation to support the dignity of that kingship made himself extremely unpopular with his English nobles, who eventually rebelled.

The wife of Alexander III of Scotland was Margaret of England (died 1275), a daughter of Henry III. This familial connection between the English and Scottish royal families might account for the introduction of the &quot;triskeles&quot; as a symbol of the Isle of Man. If so, it may well have been adopted as a means to reinforce the regime change on the island.

Following English domination of the isle in 1346, the triskelion was retained and has endured as a symbol of the Isle of Man.

By the mid-19th century, the Manx flag began appearing on merchant ships from the Isle of Man. However, such usage of the flag was not sanctioned by the Board of Trade and the Admiralty under Section 105 of the 1854 Merchant Shipping Act in favour of the Red Ensign. This decision was reversed by the Admiralty on 4 March 1889 and Manx merchant ships were permitted to fly the Flag of the Isle of Man.

The flag was officially adopted between 1928 and 1932; however, sources differ on the exact date.

In July 1968, steps were taken to standardise the flag. The feet of the triskelion were all to be facing in a clockwise direction and the design was to be balanced with one leg directly planted at the bottom. On 27 August 1971, a civil ensign for the Isle of Man was approved by royal proclamation. This flag featured a red field with the Union Jack in the canton. The triskelion of Man is emblazoned off centre towards the fly. Another Manx flag in use is the flag of Tynwald, the legislature of the Isle of Man, which has flown outside the Legislative Buildings since 1971.

Certain parishes on the Isle of Man have flags, namely Onchan, Maughold, Douglas and Malew.

<doc id="459206" wikidata="Q200260" url="?curid=459206" title="Flag of the Marshall Islands">
<text>The [[flag]] of the [[Republic of the Marshall Islands]], an island nation in the Pacific, was adopted upon the start of self-government, May 1, 1979. The flag was designed by Emlain Kabua, who served as the first First Lady of the republic.

Rules and specifications regarding the flag are set forth in the Official Flag of the Marshall Islands Act 1979 (Public Law 1979–1).

==History==
The Marshall Islands were part of the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands administered by the United States, from which the Marshall Islands, Palau, and the Federated States of Micronesia split. In common with other island nations in the region, this flag features the symbolic representation of the islands&#x27; place within the ocean. The rising diagonal band represents the equator, the star above representing this Northern Hemisphere archipelago. The white and orange portions of the band represent, respectively, the Ratak Chain (&quot;sunrise&quot;) and the Ralik Chain (&quot;sunset&quot;), as well as symbolizing peace and courage. The star&#x27;s 24 points represent the number of electoral districts, while the four elongated points represent the principal cultural centers of Majuro, Jaluit, Wotje and Ebeye. The flag is also the national flag with the most points on a star, at 24.

This flag placed ninth out of 72 - the best flag of an independent nation that isn&#x27;t Canada or the United States, instead being in a free association with the United States - in a North American Vexillological Association poll that was held in 2001.

==Subnational flags==
==Specifications==

The flag has a ratio of 10:19. The star is situated such that its center is equidistant from the left edge, the top edge, and the top of the orange ray.

<doc id="459208" wikidata="Q4862113" url="?curid=459208" title="Baron Arlington">
<text>Baron Arlington is a title in the Peerage of England which was created, on 14 March 1665, for Sir Henry Bennet, younger brother of John Bennet, 1st Baron Ossulston. In 1672, he was made Earl of Arlington and Viscount Thetford, and was regranted the title of Baron Arlington, with a special remainder allowing it to pass to both male and female descendants, rather than only heirs male, as was customary with most peerages. Its territorial designation is the birthplace of its first holder Harlington, London, which was also known as Arlington.

The 11th Baroness Arlington was the last woman to take her seat in the House of Lords under the provisions of the Peerage Act 1963. She became a member of the Lords on 27 May 1999 and remained in the House until 11 November 1999, when the House of Lords Act 1999 took effect.

==Co-descent with the dukedom of Grafton==
The first Earl of Arlington died, as anticipated, without male heirs so the titles went to his daughter Isabella. At age five, Isabella was engaged to Henry FitzRoy, the illegitimate son of Charles II of England and his mistress Barbara Villiers. Henry would be created Duke of Grafton in 1679. Their son Charles inherited the Arlington and Grafton substantive titles.

The two titles continued united until the death of the 9th Duke in a high-speed racecar accident in 1936.

==Separation from Dukedom==
The Grafton dukedom passed to a cousin yet the three Arlington/Thetford titles fell into abeyance under the principle of moieties between his two sisters, neither of whom petitioned the Sovereign to terminate this. After the death of the elder sister, her eldest child Jennifer petitioned the Sovereign, and the abeyance of the barony of Arlington was terminated in her favour, restoring it upon her, rather than her aunt&#x27;s descendants. The earldom of Arlington, however, remains abeyant, along with the viscountcy of Thetford.

==Abeyance of senior titles==
Of peerages in the United Kingdom, the earldom of Arlington and the viscounty of Thetford are rare examples of a title with a higher rank than baron falling into abeyance, another case being that of the earldom of Cromartie in 1893.

<doc id="459209" wikidata="Q173548" url="?curid=459209" title="Flag of Mauritius">
<text>The national flag of Mauritius, also known as the The Four Bands (), was adopted upon independence, 12 March 1968. It consists of four horizontal bands of equal width, coloured (from top to bottom) red, blue, yellow, and green. The flag was recorded at the College of Arms in London on 9 January 1968.

The flag was designed by Gurudutt Moher whose contribution was recognised posthumously in March 2018 in the form of the national title &quot;Member of the Star and Key of the Indian Ocean&quot; (MSK). Moher, who was a retired school teacher, died of a heart attack on 7 October 2017, at the age of 93.

The civil ensign (for private vessels) and government ensign (for state vessels) are red and blue flags, respectively, each with the national flag in the canton and the coat of arms of Mauritius in the fly. They are based on the British Red and Blue Ensigns.

The naval ensign (used by coast guard vessels) is an unusual design consisting of red, white, and blue vertical stripes of unequal widths defaced by a central anchor/key emblem.

==Colours==
The flag of Mauritius consists of red, blue, yellow and green bands which officially stand for:

* Red represents the struggle for freedom and independence.
* Blue represents the Indian Ocean, in which Mauritius is situated.
* Yellow represents the light of freedom shining over the island.
* Green represents the agriculture of Mauritius and its colour throughout the 12 months of the year.

In an attempt to unite the nation, especially following the deadly and divisive riots of 1965 and those of 1968, the colours also have political origins. Indeed, the colours also represent the main political parties which existed at the time, namely:

* Red: Parti Travailliste, a social-democrat party
* Blue: PMSD, conservative
* Yellow: IFB, socialist, Indo-Mauritian
* Green: CAM, Islamist

The official colour codes of the flag are in accordance with the Mauritius Standard Bureau.

<doc id="459210" wikidata="Q190648" url="?curid=459210" title="Flag of the Federated States of Micronesia">
<text>The flag of the Federated States of Micronesia was adopted on 30 November 1978. The blue field represents the Pacific Ocean. In an echo of U.S. heraldic practice, the stars represent the four federated states: Chuuk, Pohnpei, Kosrae and Yap, arranged like the points of the compass.

==History==
The Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands was administered by the United States under the auspices of the United Nations after World War II. In the 1950s, the residents had protested the adoption of a flag, citing the lack of a cohesive identity for the disparate group of islands, and the scheme was dropped.

The trust territory first adopted a flag on 24 October 1962, which featured a design of six white stars around a shade of blue based on the flag of the United Nations. The flag was designed by Gonzalo Santos and officially approved in 1965 by the National Congress. The six stars represented the districts of Yap, Truk, Pohnpei, Palau, Marshall Islands, and Northern Mariana Islands; the latter three did not become part of the eventual Federated States of Micronesia (FSM) in 1979.

A four-star variation of the former trust territory flag was adopted on 30 November 1978 prior to independence; Kosrae was split from Pohnpei and is represented by the fourth star. The blue shade based on the United Nations flag was substituted for a darker blue after the FSM ascended to the Compact of Free Association with the United States on 3 November 1986.

==Design==
The four white stars are oriented in a circle with none of the &quot;rays&quot; pointing inwards, adorning a shade of blue representing the Pacific Ocean. The ratio of the flag is 10:19 and the width of each star to the flag is 1:5, though it is permissible to reproduce the flag in other dimensions for unofficial purposes.

<text>The national flag of Mongolia is a vertical triband with a red stripe at each side and a blue stripe in the middle, with the Mongolian Soyombo symbol centering on the leftmost stripe. The blue stripe represents the eternal blue sky, and the red stripes thriving for eternity. The Soyombo symbol is a geometric abstraction that represents fire, sun, moon, earth, water, and a symbol representing two fish as in Mongol mythology fish never sleep thus symbolizing that the spirit of the Mongol people never sleeps.

The current flag was adopted on 12 January 1992, with the current official colour standards being set on 8 July 2011. Until 1992, the flag had a communist star above the Soyombo, during the final 47 years of the Mongolian People&#x27;s Republic. The flag was originally designed by artist Dodiin Choidog ().

It has become common practice among Mongolians in the Inner Mongolia autonomous region to hang the Mongolian flag, although the Chinese government is allegedly against public displays of Mongolian national or cultural symbols due to concerns of separatism.

<text>The F Virtual Window Manager (FVWM) is a virtual window manager for the X Window System. Originally a twm derivative, FVWM is now a window manager for Unix-like systems.

==History==
In 1993, during his work analyzing acoustic signatures for the United States Department of Defense, Robert Nation began hacking twm with the intent of simultaneously reducing memory usage and adding support for virtual desktops.

Already known for his rxvt terminal emulator, Nation worked on reducing the memory consumption of his new window manager. Deciding to test FVWM&#x27;s reception, on June 1, 1993, he bundled it with an rxvt release.

In 1994, Rob Nation stopped developing FVWM and made Charles Hines the maintainer. Rob Nation&#x27;s last release of FVWM was fvwm-1.24r. The post-Rob Nation version of FVWM uses a different configuration file format and has a significantly different architecture. Many Linux distributions, as a result, distributed both fvwm-1.24r and later releases of FVWM as separate programs. , fvwm-1.24r still compiles and runs on a modern Linux system without any problems. A small number of users continue to use the older FVWM release. In late 1998 the office of FVWM maintainer was abolished and a group of volunteers conducted further development.

Many window managers in use today have been influenced by FVWM, notably Afterstep, Xfce, Enlightenment, and Metisse.

===Name origin===
Originally, FVWM was named the &quot;Feeble Virtual Window Manager&quot;, as stated by Robert Nation in a 1997 Linux Journal interview with, who claimed the name had been chosen because original releases had almost no user-selectable features. When Google published the old newsgroup archives acquired from DejaNews, the original origin of the name was re-discovered. However, when Chuck Hine was answering questions for the official FVWM Frequently Asked Questions, Chuck had never agreed with the &#x27;feeble&#x27; explanation and added alternate possible meanings of &quot;F&quot; (as in the name of the window manager) to the FAQ, with many entries coming from mailing list messages.

<doc id="459214" wikidata="Q245269" url="?curid=459214" title="Flag of Montserrat">
<text>The flag of Montserrat consists of a Blue Ensign with the British overseas territory&#x27;s coat of arms. Adopted in 1960 to supplement the Union Jack after the dissolution of the British Leeward Islands the year before, it has been the flag of Montserrat since the territory was granted self-government that year. The design of the present flag entailed enlarging the coat of arms and outlining it with a white trim. Montserrat&#x27;s flag is similar to the flags of eight other British Overseas Territories, which are also Blue Ensigns with their respective coats of arms.

==History==
Montserrat was first spotted by Christopher Columbus in November 1493 during his second voyage to the West Indies, and was named after the Santa Maria de Montserrat Abbey in Spain. It was later colonised by the Kingdom of England in 1632, when Thomas Warner – the first governor of Saint Christopher – sent Irish Catholics from his island to Montserrat. Other Irish settlers from the Colony of Virginia consequently relocated to the territory. Sovereignty over the island changed hands between the British and the French for the duration of the 17th and 18th centuries. This continued until 1783, when the Peace of Paris saw France permanently relinquish Montserrat to Great Britain.

Montserrat became part of the British Leeward Islands federation in 1871. The island was granted its own shield on 10 April 1909. It was consequently utilised on the Blue Ensign after the federation was dissolved on 1 July 1956. This was adopted as a proxy national flag in 1960, after authorisation was granted by the Admiralty. Montserratians ratified the territory&#x27;s constitution that same year, and the island became a distinct crown colony in 1962. The flag was later redesigned in 1999, with the size of the shield increased, and the white disc removed and replaced with a white outline. To coincide with the Diamond Jubilee of Elizabeth II in 2012, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office started flying the flags of overseas territories over its Main Building in Whitehall to commemorate a &quot;significant day in each of their respective histories&quot;. The date chosen for Montserrat was 17 March, a public holiday on the island honouring both Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day and an unsuccessful slave uprising there on that day in 1768. The territory&#x27;s flag was also hoisted at New Palace Yard in the Palace of Westminster on 17 March 2021, as part of an effort by Lindsay Hoyle – the Speaker of the House of Commons at the time – to observe the ceremonial days of overseas territories.

==Design==
===Symbolism===
The colours and symbols of the flag carry cultural, political, and regional meanings. The woman donning a green dress portrays Erin, the national personification of Ireland. The Celtic harp she is grasping is another representation of that nation. Both these symbols pay tribute to the Irish settlers who moved to Montserrat from 1632 onwards. The inaugural census conducted in the British Leeward Islands in 1678 found that 70% of the island&#x27;s inhabitants who were Caucasian claimed Irish ancestry, representing the highest concentration of Irish residents in the federation. The cross alludes to the Christian heritage of the island, while the woman&#x27;s hold of it signifies the Montserratians&#x27; love of Christ.

===Similarities===
The Blue Ensign is also employed on the flags of eight of the thirteen other British Overseas Territories, with their coats of arms in the fly being the only distinguishing feature between them. These are, specifically, the flags of Anguilla, the British Virgin Islands, the Cayman Islands, the Falkland Islands, the Pitcairn Islands, Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha, South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands, and the Turks and Caicos Islands.

==Variants==
The standard of the territory&#x27;s governor features the Union Jack defaced with the territorial coat of arms at the centre.

<text>The flag of Morocco () is the flag used by the government of Morocco and has served as the national flag of Morocco since 17 November 1915. It has a red field with a green pentagram in the centre. The green star represents the five pillars of Islam, and the red represents the blood of the ancestors and unity.

Red has considerable historic significance in Morocco by proclaiming the descent from the royal &#x27;Alawid dynasty. The ruling house was associated with the Islamic prophet Muhammad via Fatimah, the wife of Ali, the fourth Muslim Caliph. Red is also the color that was used by the sharifs of Mecca and the imams of Yemen. Since the 17th century, Morocco is ruled by the &#x27;Alawid dynasty, and the first flags of the country were plain red. 

On 17 November 1915, Sultan Yusef signed a dhahir that made Morocco&#x27;s flag red with a green interlaced pentangle. 

While Morocco was under French and Spanish control, the red flag with the seal in the center remained in use but only inland since its use at sea was prohibited. When independence was restored in 1955, it once again became the national flag.

==Design==
The legal definition of the flag specifies that the colours are bright red and palm green. No more precise colour specifications are known to be published. The RGB colours used in the illustration on the Kingdom&#x27;s website are listed below, along with rough CMYK and Pantone equivalents for printing.


=== Construction sheet ===
==History==

In the 17th century, when Morocco became ruled by the current &#x27;Alawid dynasty, its flag was solid red at first. The Sharifs of Makkah used that as a reference colour.

On May 8, 2010, a Moroccan flag with a size of , weighing , was set in Dakhla, a city in the disputed territory of Western Sahara. It was certified by the &quot;Guinness Book of World Records&quot; as the largest flag ever draped.

<doc id="459217" wikidata="Q484249" url="?curid=459217" title="Flag of Mozambique">
<text>The national flag of Mozambique is a horizontal tricolour of green, black, and golden-yellow with white fimbriations and a red isosceles triangle at the hoist. The triangle is charged with a five-pointed gold star in its center, above which there is a gun crossed by a hoe, superimposed on an open book. The colours and symbols of the flag represent different aspects of the Mozambican people and their war of independence.

The current design, adopted on 1 May 1983, is defined in the Constitution of Mozambique, and regulations regarding the flag&#x27;s use are outlined in decree no. 47/2006, titled &quot;State Protocol Standards&quot;. The design is based on the first flag of FRELIMO (Mozambique Liberation Front), which has governed the country since its independence from Portugal on 25 June 1975. Since the democratisation of Mozambique in 1990, there have been calls to change the flag, particularly to remove the gun.

== Design ==
The design of the flag is described in Title XVI, Article 297 of the Constitution of Mozambique, 2004 (2007 revision):

While the constitution does not specify the number of points the star on the flag should have, it is universally depicted with five points, as seen, for example, on the official website of the Mozambican government. Similarly, the particular gun used in the design is not mentioned in the constitution, but it is generally understood to be an AK-47 with a bayonet attached. It is the only national flag that features a modern firearm.

=== Colours ===
The flag&#x27;s colours are constitutionally defined, but their specific shades are not. The London Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games used the following Pantone colour codes in 2012: green, PMS 355; yellow, PMS 109; and red, PMS 185. However, these shades differ from those used on the flag displayed on the Mozambican government&#x27;s official website, which are green, PMS 328; yellow, PMS 102; and red, PMS 186.

=== Symbolism ===
The Mozambican constitution explains the significance of the flag&#x27;s colours and symbols. Red represents anti-colonial resistance and national defence, green represents the country&#x27;s soil; golden-yellow represents the country&#x27;s subsoil, black represents the African continent, and white represents peace and &quot;the justice of the struggle of the Mozambican people&quot;. The star represents &quot;the spirit of international solidarity of the Mozambican people&quot;, while the book, hoe, and gun symbolise education, production, and defence, respectively.

The US Central Intelligence Agency&#x27;s &quot;World Factbook&quot; gives a slightly different explanation of the flag&#x27;s symbolism. It states that yellow represents Mozambique&#x27;s minerals, the star represents Marxism and proletarian internationalism, the gun represents vigilance in addition to defence, the hoe represents agriculture, and the open book stresses the importance of education.

== Protocol ==
The government of Mozambique outlined regulations regarding the use of the national flag in decree no. 47/2006, titled &quot;State Protocol Standards&quot;. Articles 49 and 50 of the law specify who may fly the flag and where it should be hoisted. The flag may be flown on public or private properties, and at events such as graduation ceremonies and parades. The flag should be flown at several locations, particularly state institutions, including government offices, barracks, airports, schools, and hospitals. The following individuals are entitled to display the flag on their vehicles: the president of the country, the prime minister, the president of the Assembly of the Republic, the president of the supreme court, the president of the administrative court, the president of the constitutional council, provincial governors, and heads of diplomatic missions.

Despite the law, many state institutions and official residences hoist substandard flags or no flag at all due to financial and logistical challenges. For example, a 2023 report by the Mozambican newspaper &quot;O País&quot; (&quot;The Country&quot;) found that most of these buildings in the western city of Tete did not fly the national flag. Those that did flew flags &quot;in poor condition and with altered colors&quot;, including a flag at Francisco Manyanga Secondary School that was &quot;completely torn&quot;.

== Historical flags ==
Mozambique flew the Portuguese flag when it was under Portuguese colonial rule. The Mozambican War of Independence between Portugal and FRELIMO (Mozambique Liberation Front) ended in September 1974 with the signing of the Lusaka Accord and the formation of a transitional government. During Mozambique&#x27;s transition to independence, the flag of Portugal flew alongside the then flag of FRELIMO, which was similar to the country&#x27;s current flag but without any charges on the triangle. American vexillologist Whitney Smith suggests that the design may have been inspired by the flag of Tanganyika, where FRELIMO had been operating in exile. British vexillologist William Crampton meanwhile claims that the flag of South Africa&#x27;s African National Congress was the source of FRELIMO&#x27;s inspiration.

The People&#x27;s Republic of Mozambique proclaimed its independence on 25 June 1975, and a new national flag was hoisted in place of the Portuguese and FRELIMO flags. The new flag&#x27;s design and significance were defined in Title IV, Article 68 of the Constitution of the People&#x27;s Republic of Mozambique (in effect from 1975 to 1990). The flag consisted of four diagonal stripes emanating from the upper hoist, separated by white fimbriations. The stripes were, from top to bottom, green, red, black, and yellow. Near the upper hoist was a white cogwheel, charged with a red star and an AK-47 crossed by a hoe, superimposed on an open book. The colours and symbols of the People&#x27;s Republic flag retained by the current flag share the same meaning. The other symbols were given the following significance by the Mozambican government: the cogwheel represents the working class and industrial production, while the red star represents proletarian internationalism. The flag was changed in April 1983 to an alteration of the FRELIMO flag; the previous flag&#x27;s charge was placed on top of a large yellow star inside the red triangle. The cogwheel was removed shortly thereafter on 1 May 1983, leading to the flag&#x27;s present design.

== Proposals to change the flag ==
The drafting of a new Mozambican Constitution in 1990 started discussions on changing the country&#x27;s national symbols, including the national flag. Critics argued that, because the national flag resembled the flag of FRELIMO, it was antithetical to calls for national unity. Jorge Rebelo, a member of FRELIMO&#x27;s political bureau, acknowledged the debates surrounding the flag but stated that it would remain unchanged. Since then, the primary criticism has been directed at the inclusion of the AK-47 on the flag, which some Mozambicans view as an allusion to violence.

In 2005, the Mozambican government held a competition to design a new national flag and emblem, as part of a peace agreement between FRELIMO and RENAMO (Mozambican National Resistance). RENAMO had fought FRELIMO in a civil war that lasted sixteen years, before it became Mozambique&#x27;s main opposition party. RENAMO called for the removal of the AK-47 and star from the flag. José Gabriel Manteigas, a RENAMO member of parliament, gave the following critique:

Then Mozambican president Joaquim Chissano, previously the leader of FRELIMO, responded to Manteigas&#x27;s criticisms by saying: &quot;If Mozambique&#x27;s single star were to symbolise communism, the Stars and Stripes would place the United States among the world&#x27;s most leftist nations.&quot; In further defence of the flag, FRELIMO supporters argued that the AK-47 is a symbol of the Mozambican people&#x27;s determination to protect their country, and the star is a symbol of African solidarity.

A total of 169 entries were received during the 2005 competition, all of which were reviewed by a panel of five judges. The proposals were ultimately rejected by the Assembly of the Republic, which voted 155 to 79 against changing the flag. All the votes against were from FRELIMO, and all the votes for were from RENAMO.

<text>The flag of [[Namibia]] consists of a red bend edged in two white bands with a blue upper triangle charged with an 12-ray yellow sun and green lower triangle. 

The flag was adopted on 21 March 1990 upon independence from South Africa. During apartheid rule, it used the South African orange-white-blue tricolor.

== Design ==
The National Symbols Sub-Committee received 870 entries for the national flag. Six designs were short-listed; this was reduced to three, those of three Namibians – Theo Jankowski of Rehoboth, Don Stevenson of Windhoek and Ortrud Clay of Lüderitz. These three designs were combined to form the Namibia national flag, adopted unanimously on 2 February 1990 by the Constituent Assembly. The three designers were publicly acknowledged by judge Hans Berker, the chairman of the subcommittee, at the unveiling ceremony on 9 March 1990.

However, two other claims were made – South African Frederick Brownell claimed that he had designed the flag in his role as South African State Herald. The other claimant was Briton Roy Allen, who claimed that the flag design was the result of a competition run by Hannes Smith of the &quot;Windhoek Observer&quot;, and that he had won.

It is one of the few national flags incorporating a diagonal line, with other examples including the DR Congo, Tanzania, Trinidad and Tobago, and Brunei.

=== Colours ===
The colours of the Namibian flag are described in the Government Gazette. This document also details construction of the Presidential flag. The tone or specific shade for white has not been specified.

=== Construction sheet ===
== Symbolism ==
The chairman explained the symbolism of the flag&#x27;s colours as follows:
* Red – represents Namibia&#x27;s most important resource, its people. It refers to their heroism and their determination to build a future of equal opportunity for all.
* White – represents peace, unity, tranquility, and harmony.
* Green – symbolises vegetation and agricultural resources.
* Blue – represents the clear Namibian sky and the Atlantic Ocean, the country&#x27;s precious water resources and rain.
* Golden-yellow sun – life and energy. The golden-yellow colour represents wealth of the country.
* The twelve rays of the sun – represents the twelve ethnicities of Namibia, which make up most of the Namibian population, which are divided into four main groups of three.

== Description ==
The flag has a white-edged red diagonal band radiating diagonally from the lower hoist-side corner. The upper triangle is blue with a gold sun with 12 triangular rays and the lower triangle is green.

Blazon: &quot;Per bend sinister Azure and Vert, a bend sinister Gules fimbriated Argent and in dexter chief a Sun with twelve straight rays Or charged with an annulet Azure.&quot;

<doc id="459227" wikidata="Q4047692" url="?curid=459227" title="Pyramid Technology">
<text>Pyramid Technology Corporation was a computer company that produced a number of RISC-based minicomputers at the upper end of the performance range. It was based in the San Francisco Bay Area of California

They also became the second company to ship a multiprocessor UNIX system (branded DC/OSx), in 1985, which formed the basis of their product line into the early 1990s. Pyramid&#x27;s OSx was a dual-universe UNIX which supported programs and system calls from both 4.xBSD and AT&amp;T&#x27;s UNIX System V.

==History==
Pyramid Technology was formed in 1981 by a number of ex-Hewlett-Packard employees, who were interested in building first-rate minicomputers based on RISC designs.

Pyramid licensed its multiprocessor bus technology to Fujitsu/ICL in 1993, also entering into a marketing partnership in certain markets that would see ICL sell Pyramid server products and offer integration services with ICL&#x27;s existing mainframe products. Such sales arrangements were to continue into 1994, by which time ICL was to have implemented Pyramid&#x27;s technology in its own SPARC products, in contrast with the MIPS architecture of existing Pyramid systems.

In March 1995, Pyramid was bought by Siemens AG and merged into their Siemens Computer Systems US unit. In 1998, this unit was split, with the services side of the operation becoming Wincor Nixdorf. In 1999 Siemens and Fujitsu merged their computer operations to form Fujitsu Siemens Computers, and finally Amdahl was added to the mix in 2000.

==Products==

===90x===
The first Pyramid Technology series of minicomputers was released in August 1983 as the 90x superminicomputer, which used their custom 32-bit scalar processor running at 8 MHz.

Although the architecture was marketed as a RISC machine, it was actually microprogrammed. It used a &quot;sliding window&quot; register model based on the Berkeley RISC processor, but memory access instructions had complex operation modes that could require many cycles to run. Many register-to-register scalar instructions were executed in a single machine cycle. Initially, floating point instructions were executed totally in microcode, although an optional floating point unit on a separate circuit board was released later. Microprogramming also allowed other non-RISC luxuries such as block move instructions.

Programs had access to 64 registers, and many instructions were triadic. Sixteen registers (registers 48 to 63) were referred to as &quot;global registers&quot; and they correspond to the registers of a typical CPU, in that they are static and always visible. The other 48 registers were actually the top of the subroutine stack. Thirty-two of them (0–31) were local registers for the current subroutine, and registers 32–47 were used to pass up to 16 parameters to the next subroutine called. During a subroutine call, the register stack moved up 32 words, so the caller&#x27;s registers 32–47 became the called subroutine&#x27;s registers 0–15. The return instruction dropped the stack by 32 words so return parameters would be visible to the caller in registers 32–47. The stack cache held 16 levels in the CPU and stack overflow and underflow was automatically handled by the microcode of the CPU. The programming model had two stacks, one for the register stack, and one for subroutine local variables. One grew up from a designated address in the middle of the address space, and the other grew down from the top of the user mode address space.

The 90x could accommodate four memory boards, initially holding 1 MB each. This was considered to be a lot of memory at the time, but the RISC-like architecture resulted in bigger programs than earlier architectures so most machines were sold with the memory slots full. Fortunately, the 1 MB memory boards had RAM in sockets, so they could be upgraded to 4 MB units when bigger dynamic RAM devices became available shortly after the 90x&#x27;s initial release.

The 90x competed with the Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) VAX 11/780 which was the preferred platform for running UNIX in the early 1980s. The 90x processor benchmarked at roughly twice the speed of the VAX, and sold for about half the price. Pyramid was indirectly assisted by DEC&#x27;s reluctance to sell VAX machines without the VMS operating system, for which they charged a considerable amount of money. Many universities wanted to run UNIX rather than VMS, so Pyramid&#x27;s higher performance and lower price, coupled with artificial delivery delays or surcharges from DEC, helped them to make the risky decision to buy from a new manufacturer.

One of the 90x&#x27;s biggest advantages over the competition was its asynchronous serial port controller (the ITS or Intelligent Terminal Server) based on a 16-bit bit-slice processor. The ITS interfaced to 16 serial ports, and it could run them at very high speeds, using DMA to feed from daisy-chained output data blocks. A machine could have many ITSs installed, each one with its own I/O processor. Other machines at the time (including the 11/780) required CPU intervention every few bytes for interactive users, which added significantly to the system component of the CPU load. As a result, the 90x scored very well on benchmarks with a realistic amount of serial I/O.

The disk and magnetic tape controllers were actually 16-bit third-party Multibus controllers fitted into a socket in a U-shaped bus-adapter board.

Most early systems were delivered with the 470 MB Fujitsu Eagle disk drive and a slot-loading reel-to-reel streaming tape drive.

Just like the VAX 11/780, which had a PDP-11/03 with a floppy disk as its console processor, the 90x had a &quot;System Support Processor&quot;, based on a Motorola 68000, that loaded the microcode from an floppy disk when the system was started. It was also able to run a suite of diagnostics over the system. It had a modem which allowed remote analysis by the manufacturer. The software run by the administrative processor was initially called the Totally Unrealistic Remote Diagnostic. This name was changed some years later.

A minimal system was delivered in a single rack about high with the card cage in the bottom, the disk drive in the middle, the tape drive above it, then the 2 inch high control panel with a floppy disk drive and ignition key on the top. This was considered very compact at the time. At least one machine in Australia spend six months installed in a retired outdoor lavatory with an air-conditioner replacing the louvered window and the system console terminal sitting on top of the cabinet. Administration tasks were performed al-fresco. The only indicator on the control panel was an 8 segment bar graph LED display that displayed average CPU usage when the machine was running and a &quot;Cylon Eye&quot; pattern when the machine stopped unexpectedly. The machine was low enough that the console (a monochrome asynchronous terminal) could rest on top.

===98x===
The 90x was fairly quickly followed by the 98x which was identical except that the processor clock speed was increased to 10 MHz.

Initially a single processor system like its predecessor, the 98x became Pyramid&#x27;s first SMP in 1986. Several machines in the series were released, from the 1-CPU 9805 to the 4-CPU 9845, over a period of years from 1985 to 1987. The fully loaded 9845 ran at about 25 MIPS, a respectable figure for the era, though not competitive with high-end supercomputers.

Addressing the growing but cost-sensitive workstation/server market, Pyramid introduced the WorkCenter in 1986, essentially a half-height, lower cost version of the 98x with a horizontally mounted 9-track tape drive and disk drive(s).

All early Pyramid 9xxx systems - from the 90x to the 9810 - used the same physical bus and were field upgradeable.

===MIServer===
Like many of the early multiprocessor vendors, Pyramid turned to &quot;commodity&quot; RISC CPUs when they started to become practical. Pyramid continued to use their own RISC design until the release of the MIServer S product line. Pyramid released a series of register window-based machines as a 9000 line follow on. These were known as the MIServer starting in 1989. They supported up to ten CPUs with performance of about 12 MIPS each. The MIServer was replaced in 1991/2 with the MIServerT and later followed up with the MIServer S and ES, Pyramid&#x27;s first R3000-based machine. The first machines in the series shipped with anywhere from 4 to 12 R3000s running at 33 MHz, with top-end performance around 140 MIPS. Later high-end MIServer ES machines had up to 24 CPUs, also at 33 MHz. The operating system for the MIPS based systems was DC/OSx, a port of AT&amp;T System V Release 4 (SVR4).

===Nile series===
The release of the 150 MHz 64-bit R4400 led to the 2–16-CPU Nile series in late 1993. With each CPU capable of 92 MIPS, the Nile systems were true supercomputers. Their last product, the Reliant RM 1000, known internally as the Meshine, was just coming to market when Siemens bought them. The RM1000 was a massive parallel processing (MPP) computer. Each node ran its own instance of Reliant UNIX DC/OSx. This system had a two-axis mesh architecture. The RM1000 used software called ICF to manage the cluster interconnects. ICF went on to provide the cluster foundation in the PrimeCluster HA software which is still developed and available from Fujitsu Siemens.

Each compute node in the mesh used a single MIPS R10000 CPU, however enhancements to the RM1000 allowed for the NILE SMP machines to be included into the mesh as &quot;fat&quot; nodes. The compute nodes were physically installed in the HAAS-3 frames that shipped as drive arrays with the earlier Nile product. Each compute node controlled six SCSI disks as the primary controller and another six disks as a secondary controller. The frame with up to six compute nodes or four compute nodes and two Nile attach gateways was connected to neighboring frames with short ribbon cables. A HAAS-3 frame with compute nodes installed was called a cell. The cells locked together and could be stacked two high and end to end as far as space permitted. Four cells together were known as a ton and systems were referred to by the number of tons they contained. The largest mesh constructed at Pyramid was a test system containing 214 CPUs including four Nile SMP nodes.

Although the RM1000 was eventually discontinued and not replaced by Siemens, customers who had large installations such as a large UK telecommunications company took a long time to find suitable replacements for these massively parallel systems due to their massive I/O and computing capabilities.

<doc id="459228" wikidata="Q3309104" url="?curid=459228" title="The Dead Milkmen">
<text>The Dead Milkmen is an American punk rock band formed in 1983 in Philadelphia. Their original lineup consisted of vocalist and keyboardist Rodney Linderman (&quot;Rodney Anonymous&quot;), guitarist and vocalist Joe Genaro (&quot;Joe Jack Talcum&quot;), bassist Dave Schulthise (&quot;Dave Blood&quot;) and drummer Dean Sabatino (&quot;Dean Clean&quot;).

The band distinguished itself in the hardcore punk scene of the early 1980s through its jangly punk sound and sardonic humor delivered with thick Philadelphia accents. They attracted college radio attention with their 1985 debut album, &quot;Big Lizard in My Backyard&quot;, and the song &quot;Bitchin&#x27; Camaro&quot;. Extensive touring and further releases helped the band garner an underground following.

The band enjoyed international success on the strength of &quot;Punk Rock Girl&quot;, a single from their 1988 &quot;Beelzebubba&quot; album which entered into MTV rotation. After an ill-fated stint with major record label Hollywood Records, health problems and industry frustrations in the wake of their success led to the group&#x27;s 1995 breakup.

The group reunited in 2008, with Dan Stevens replacing the deceased Schulthise. In 2011, they released &quot;The King in Yellow&quot;, their first studio album in 16 years. The band remained active thereafter, touring sporadically and releasing further records.

==History==

===Formative period (1979–83)===
Conceptually, the group began in 1979 as Genaro&#x27;s home-recording project. Then based in Chester County, Pennsylvania, Genaro and his high school friend Garth created an imaginary band called The Dead Milkmen with a mythological back-story, recording homemade cassettes in keeping with their fictional characters. According to Genaro, the band&#x27;s moniker came from a character named &quot;Milkman Dead&quot; in Toni Morrison&#x27;s novel &quot;Song of Solomon&quot;. Linderman, who attended high school with Genaro, later participated in this embryonic stage of the group. The project became inactive when Garth departed to join the United States Air Force and Genaro relocated to the dormitories of Philadelphia&#x27;s Temple University.

While in Philadelphia, Genaro met Schulthise and Sabatino through mutual friends. The three began loosely rehearsing together in 1981, taking their name from Genaro&#x27;s home-recording project. Sabatino was the only member with experience in rock groups, having played previously in the two-piece new wave band Narthex. Linderman collaborated sporadically with the three during this period. He completed the lineup as lead vocalist in 1983, in time for their first public performance which took place July 23, 1983 at Harleysville Youth Center in Pennsylvania.

===Early career and albums (1983–87)===
The band played frequently in Philadelphia&#x27;s punk rock circuit and eventually began touring nationally. After several self-released cassettes, their debut LP, &quot;Big Lizard in My Backyard&quot;, was issued in 1985 on Restless Records, a subsidiary of Enigma Records. The album received college radio play, with the track &quot;Bitchin&#x27; Camaro&quot; becoming especially popular. Because of its improvised dialogue intro, the song remained a favorite at live shows.

&quot;Eat Your Paisley&quot;, their second album, was released the following year. &quot;The Thing That Only Eats Hippies&quot; became the band&#x27;s first proper single and music video, and was a hit in Australia in addition to receiving domestic attention. &quot;Bucky Fellini&quot; followed in 1987, yielding the single &quot;Instant Club Hit (You&#x27;ll Dance to Anything)&quot;, a genre spoof of electronic dance music.

===Commercial success (1987–91)===

As the band toured extensively behind their records, they began to accrue increasing attention, which often came through unconventional routes. In 1987, Major League Baseball player Jim Walewander, a Detroit Tigers rookie, became a vocal fan of the band; this was noted on his baseball card (1988 Score, #571), which described the group as &quot;an obscure punk-rock band&quot;. Walewander invited the band to Tiger Stadium to see a game in which he hit his first and only major league home run.

In 1988, they issued &quot;Beelzebubba&quot;, a comparatively polished record that yielded their most successful single, &quot;Punk Rock Girl&quot;. Featuring Genaro on lead vocals, the track saw extensive rotation on MTV and propelled the album to number 101 on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Top 200. They later released the &quot;Smokin&#x27; Banana Peels&quot; EP and music video from this album. The 1990 followup, &quot;Metaphysical Graffiti&quot;, did not yield a hit, but also charted and helped solidify the group&#x27;s presence in the independent rock scene.

===Stint with Hollywood Records; breakup (1991–95)===
In 1991, the band left Restless and signed with The Walt Disney Company-owned Hollywood Records. &quot;Soul Rotation&quot;, their Hollywood debut released the following year, was focused more heavily on Genaro&#x27;s singing and songwriting, with Linderman used predominantly as a keyboardist. The resulting record was much more pop-oriented than the group&#x27;s previous efforts, but failed to produce a hit single. &quot;Not Richard, But Dick&quot; was issued in 1993, and did not fare any better than its predecessor. Relations between the band and label quickly soured, and the two albums went out of print shortly after their initial releases. The band was later unable to feature any of the songs from either of the Hollywood albums on retrospective or compilation CDs, although the group did smuggle an unlisted version of &quot;Soul Rotation&quot;&#x27;s &quot;If I Had a Gun&quot; onto their 1994 live album &quot;Chaos Rules: Live at the Trocadero&quot;.

Later in 1994, The Dead Milkmen announced their decision to break up following a final tour and album. This was due in part to the tendinitis Schulthise began to suffer in his hands, which made performing intensely painful, as well as the band&#x27;s increasing frustration with commercial and industry struggles. Restless Records released what was planned to be their final studio album in 1995, &quot;Stoney&#x27;s Extra Stout (Pig)&quot;. Several compilations of both hits and rarities were later released.

===Post-breakup (1995–2008)===

The band then took a 13-year hiatus. During this time, Linderman performed with the gothic, Celtic punk band Burn Witch Burn and worked in journalism and blogging, including writing for the &quot;Philadelphia Weekly&quot;. Sabatino played with the Big Mess Orchestra and The Hunger Artists, two sporadically active projects, as well as Genaro&#x27;s post-Milkmen group Butterfly Joe. Genaro remained the most musically active member of the band during its split, consistently recording and performing with groups such as Butterfly Joe, Touch Me Zoo, the Town Managers and The Low Budgets, while also maintaining a low-key solo career.

Schulthise attended Indiana University to study Serbo-Croatian language, literature, history, and culture. In 1998 he moved to Novi Sad, Serbia, where he taught English. His writing was published several times in &quot;Svetigora&quot;, the magazine of the Serbian Orthodox Church. He hoped to contribute to the country&#x27;s regrowth and development, but fled in April 1999 when NATO bombed the country.

In 2003, the band issued &quot;Now We Are 20&quot;, a repackaging of their self-released &quot;Now We Are 10&quot; retrospective CD from 1993. They also collected their music video output and released it on the &quot;Philadelphia In Love&quot; DVD. Talks of reunion shows briefly emerged, but ended when Schulthise died by suicide on March 10, 2004. His death was reported in &quot;The New York Times&quot; and &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;.

The surviving members reunited for two consecutive shows in November 2004 at the Trocadero Theatre in Philadelphia, with Dan Stevens of The Low Budgets playing bass. The shows were intended to pay tribute to Schulthise, and proceeds were donated to a variety of mental health organizations and to Studenica, a Serbian monastery that he supported.

===Reunion (2008–present)===
In late 2008, the band reunited to play their first performances since the Schulthise memorial shows, with Stevens again on bass. After two back-to-back warm-up shows in Philadelphia, including one billed under the pseudonym Les Enfants Du Prague, they played the Fun Fun Fun Fest in Austin, Texas. Following these concerts, they decided to continue as an active group.

They spent the following two years composing new material before entering the recording studio late in 2010. On March 19, 2011, a new album, &quot;The King in Yellow&quot;, was released in digital form on the band&#x27;s website, with a self-released CD following shortly thereafter.

In late 2012, they released &quot;Dark Clouds Gather Over Middlemarch&quot; and &quot;Big Words Make the Baby Jesus Cry&quot;, the first two installments in a series of limited-run singles. This was also the year they appeared on nerdcore rapper MC Lars&#x27; EP, &quot;Edgar Allan Poe EP&quot;, for a new recording of Lars&#x27; song, &quot;Mr. Raven&quot;, which was originally released on his 2006 album, &quot;The Graduate&quot;. &quot;The Great Boston Molasses Flood&quot;, the third release in their singles series, was released on March 15, 2013; the fourth, &quot;Welcome to Undertown&quot;, followed on June 21.

The band released &quot;Pretty Music for Pretty People&quot;, their tenth studio album, on October 7, 2014. The following year, SRA Records issued their split 7-inch with the 1980s Philadelphia hardcore band Flag of Democracy (also known as F.O.D.)

In July 2017, The Dead Milkmen joined with philanthropic record label the Giving Groove.

On June 9, 2023, The Dead Milkmen released the LP &quot;Quaker City Quiet Pills.&quot;

<doc id="459233" wikidata="Q5222623" url="?curid=459233" title="HMS Bellona (1760)">
<text>HMS &quot;Bellona&quot; was a 74-gun third-rate ship of the line of the Royal Navy. Designed by Sir Thomas Slade, she was a prototype for the iconic 74-gun ships of the latter part of the 18th century. &quot;The design of the Bellona class was never repeated precisely, but Slade experimented slightly with the lines, and the , , , and classes were almost identical in size, layout, and structure, and had only slight variations in the shape of the underwater hull. The was also similar, but slightly larger. Thus over forty ships were near-sisters of the Bellona.&quot; &quot;Bellona&quot; was built at Chatham, starting on 10 May 1758, launched on 19 February 1760, and commissioned three days later. She was the second ship of the Royal Navy to bear the name, and saw service in the Seven Years&#x27; War, American Revolutionary War and the Napoleonic Wars.

She was captained by Robert (Bob) Faulknor the elder (father of the naval hero Robert Faulknor the younger).

&quot;Bellona&quot; left to join the squadron blockading Brest (this being the Seven Years&#x27; War) on 8 April 1760. She was later detached to patrol off the Tagus River in Spain, and on 13 August, while sailing with the frigate , she sighted the French 74-gun ship in company with two frigates. The British ships pursued, and after 14 hours, caught up with the French ships and engaged them at the Battle of Cape Finisterre (1761), the &quot;Brilliant&quot; attacking the frigates, and &quot;Bellona&quot; taking on the &quot;Courageux&quot;. The frigates eventually got away, but the &quot;Courageux&quot; struck her colours, and was later repaired and taken into the Royal Navy.

In 1762, &quot;Bellona&quot; was paid off and did not see action again until 1780, when on 30 December, under command of Captain Richard Onslow, along with Captain Taylor Penny on they captured the 54-gun Dutch ship &quot;Princess Carolina&quot;. She then from 1781 saw action during the American Revolutionary War. She was coppered at this time, one of the first British ships to receive the hull-protecting layer. Until 1783 she cruised in the North Sea and the West Indies, and participated in reliefs of Gibraltar.

&quot;Bellona&quot; was once again paid off, recommissioned briefly in 1789 in expectation of war with Russia, but did not get into action again until 1793, when she went to the West Indies.

On 10 January 1797, &quot;Bellona&quot; and drove a small French privateer schooner ashore on Deseada. They tried to use the privateer &quot;Legere&quot;, of six guns and 48 men, which &quot;Bellona&quot; had captured three days earlier, to retrieve the schooner that was on shore. In the effort, both French privateers were destroyed. Then &quot;Babet&quot; chased a brig, which had been a prize to the schooner, ashore. The British were unable to get her off so they destroyed her. &quot;Babet&quot; and &quot;Bellona&quot; were paid Prize money in 1828, more than 30 years later.

&quot;Bellona&quot; took part in the action of 18 June 1799, securing the surrender of the frigates and , and helping in capturing .

In 1801, she was in the Battle of Copenhagen, participating despite having grounded on a shoal. She continued to serve in the North Sea and Bay of Biscay until 1814, when she paid off for the last time and was broken up, having served in the navy for over 50 years, an unusually long time for one of the old wooden ships.

==&quot;Bellona&quot; in fiction==
&quot;Bellona&quot; appears in the Patrick O&#x27;Brian novels &quot;The Commodore&quot; and &quot;The Yellow Admiral&quot; as the pennant ship of a squadron led by the character Jack Aubrey.

<doc id="459237" wikidata="Q196226" url="?curid=459237" title="Starsky &amp; Hutch">
<text>Starsky &amp; Hutch is an American action television series, which consisted of a 72-minute pilot movie (originally aired as a &quot;Movie of the Week&quot; entry) and 92 episodes of 50 minutes each. The show was created by William Blinn (inspired by the success of the then recent movie &quot;Busting&quot;), produced by Spelling-Goldberg Productions and starred Paul Michael Glaser and David Soul in the title roles, Starsky and Hutch. It was broadcast from April 1975 (pilot movie) to August 1979 on the ABC network.

&quot;Starsky &amp; Hutch&quot; was distributed by Columbia Pictures Television in the United States and, originally, Metromedia Producers Corporation and later on 20th Television in Canada and some other parts of the world. Sony Pictures Television is now the worldwide distributor for the series. The series later inspired a video game and a feature film.

==Cast==

The series&#x27; protagonists were two Southern California police detectives: Sergeant David Michael Starsky (Paul Michael Glaser) and Sergeant Kenneth Richard &quot;Hutch&quot; Hutchinson (David Soul). Starsky is a dark-haired, Brooklyn transplant and U.S. Army veteran, with a street-wise manner and intense, sometimes childlike moodiness. Hutch is the divorced, blond, Duluth, Minnesota native with a more reserved and intellectual approach. Under the radio call sign &quot;Zebra Three&quot;, they were known for usually tearing around the streets of fictional Bay City, California. Much of the series was shot on location in the Los Angeles beach community of San Pedro. The building that was used as the Metropolitan Division police headquarters in the first season is now the City of Los Angeles&#x27; San Pedro Neighborhood City Hall.

=== Supporting characters ===

The detectives&#x27; main confidential informant was the street-wise, ethically ambiguous, &quot;jive-talking&quot; Huggy Bear (Antonio Fargas), who often dressed in a flashy manner and operated his own bar (first named &quot;Huggy Bear&#x27;s&quot;, and later, &quot;The Pits&quot;). The duo&#x27;s boss was the gruff, no-nonsense-but-fair Captain Harold C. Dobey (Bernie Hamilton in the series, and gravel-voiced Richard Ward in the pilot). Series creator William Blinn first used the name Huggy Bear on-screen for a character, also a confidential informant, in an episode penned by Blinn for the TV series &quot;The Rookies&quot; during the 1973 second season, &quot;Prayers Unanswered Prayers Unheard&quot;, there, played by actor Johnny Brown.

==Seasons==
===Seasons 1 and 2===
In contrast to police characters on U.S. TV in prior years, Starsky and Hutch were open with physical gestures of friendly/brotherly affection toward one another, often declaring that they trusted only each other (in an &quot;us against the world&quot;–type sense). While likely &quot;normal&quot; by American social standards since the 1990s, such body language conflicted with 1970s norms of (emotionally restrained) masculinity. In a show documentary tape made during the show&#x27;s run that can be found on YouTube, the narrator intones that some Hollywood industry types referred to the characters as &quot;French kissing prime-time homos&quot;. Soul verified this statement in a 1999 cast reunion interview in the United Kingdom.

Many fans were attracted not just by the characters, but the quality of writing during the first two seasons (despite the fact that the majority of first-season stories were actually existing scripts that were merely adapted to fit the series). The second-season episode &quot;Long Walk Down a Short Dirt Road&quot;, featured country star Lynn Anderson as a singer being stalked by a deranged person; it was based upon a real-life incident involving country music legend Dolly Parton. The part was written with Parton in mind, but Anderson wound up playing the role.

Season 1: &quot;Starsky &amp; Hutch&quot; aired on Wednesday nights at 10 p.m. and aired against &quot;Kate McShane&quot; on CBS and the second season law drama &quot;Petrocelli&quot; on NBC. &quot;Starsky &amp; Hutch&quot; had no trouble beating its competition and finished #16 with a 22.5 share in the A.C. Nielsen Ratings.

Season 2: &quot;Starsky &amp; Hutch&quot; was moved to Saturday night for the second season and was up against tough competition on CBS with &quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot; followed by &quot;The Bob Newhart Show&quot;. NBC had &quot;NBC Saturday Night at the Movies&quot;. Although the show lost some of their viewers from the move from the Wednesday night time slot from the previous season, &quot;Starsky &amp; Hutch&quot; held its own, finishing #34 with a 19.6 rating in the Nielsens.

===Season 3===
In 1977, a rising concern in America about violence on TV, along with Glaser&#x27;s own concerns about the level of violence in the series, forced the writers to reduce the violent &quot;action&quot; scenes, with more romantically and socially themed storylines, and play-up the &quot;buddy-buddy&quot; aspect of the show&#x27;s leads even more. At the same time, the lead actors—Glaser in particular—became jaded with the general theme; these and other factors contributed to the fading popularity of the series.

Glaser indicated several times that he wanted to get out of his contract and quit the series; he even sued the producers to force a release from his contract before the start of the third season. It seemed that he would not be returning for filming, so to fill the presumed void, the character &quot;Officer Linda Baylor&quot; (played by Roz Kelly) was created, and a number of alternative scripts featuring her instead of Starsky were written (whether the show&#x27;s name would have remained the same is unknown). After being granted more creative control over scripts, opportunities to direct episodes, and a per-episode pay raise (to $35,000, up from $5,000), Glaser returned to the show. Ultimately, Officer Baylor only appeared in one episode the episode &quot;Fatal Charm&quot;.

Despite this major change in the tone of the show, with a lot of the violence reduced and more of a focus on the friendship of the two leads, viewership remained steady during the season. From September to December 1977, the show stayed in its Saturday-night time slot, now up against &quot;The Jeffersons&quot; and &quot;The Tony Randall Show&quot; on CBS and &quot;NBC Saturday Night at the Movies&quot;. It was the first lead-in to &quot;The Love Boat&quot; and after its immediate success, &quot;The Love Boat&quot; was moved up an hour in January 1978 into the 9:00 slot. Having been displaced on Saturday nights, &quot;Starsky &amp; Hutch&quot; moved back to its original Wednesday-night time slot of 10 p.m. The ratings dropped a little bit, but &quot;Starsky &amp; Hutch&quot; finished #33 (tied with ABC&#x27;s &quot;Lucan&quot;) with a 19.2 Nielsen rating.

===Season 4===
Glaser again voiced his desires to leave during the fourth and final season. This time, Starsky&#x27;s wayward younger brother Nick (John Herzfeld) was introduced, in the episode &quot;Starsky&#x27;s Brother&quot;. It was intended that if Glaser was to quit, that the reformed Nick would take David&#x27;s place on the police force (and allow the series to avoid a title change). Ultimately, the disgruntled Glaser decided to return, yet again, to finish out the season. Although a fifth season was planned, increasing production costs, Glaser&#x27;s persistent (and oft-publicized) desire to move on, and declining ratings, brought an end to the series.

The final episode, &quot;Sweet Revenge&quot; (which has Starsky fighting for his life after being gunned down), originally had its co-lead dying in the early drafts. The producers decided to have the character survive, as it was felt that a dead Starsky would disrupt the continuity of reruns/syndication, and preclude the option of the producers&#x27; reviving the series in the near future. &quot;Starsky &amp; Hutch&quot; finished #36 in the Nielsen Ratings in its final season. Network reruns continued on ABC on Tuesday nights until August 21, 1979.

===Syndication===
After its prime-time run, &quot;Starsky &amp; Hutch&quot; was sold into syndication, and has been shown on several local channels and cable networks (e.g., The National Network, and WWME-CA, also known as MeTV, in Chicago). The series made its cable debut on TNT in 1994 and later appeared on TV Land beginning in 2000. In 2015–2016, the series aired on cable&#x27;s El Rey Network on weekday mornings. Several episodes from the first two seasons can be viewed for free in Minisode and in regular format on Crackle. The show has also been broadcast on Cozi TV and getTV.

==List of episodes==
==Home media==
Sony Pictures Home Entertainment has released 4 Seasons on DVD in Regions 1 and 2 between 2004 and 2006.

Mill Creek Entertainment acquired the rights to various television series from the Sony Pictures library including &quot;Starsky &amp; Hutch&quot; in 2013. They re-released the first season on DVD on March 4, 2014.

Mill Creek released &quot;Starsky &amp; Hutch - The Complete Series&quot; on DVD in Region 1 on November 11, 2014.

==International broadcasts==
* On March 15, 1979, in Italy, &quot;Starsky and Hutch&quot; was aired on Rai Due, achieving smash-hit status. In 1987, it was broadcast again, this time in the late afternoon, on Italia 1 and, in 2007, on Rai Tre at lunchtime. After some reruns on Italia 1 and AXN, in 2009, the series appeared Mondays on Fox Retro. It was aired in the early morning on Rete 4. In Summer 2015, it was aired on La7.
* In France, the show was shown on TF1 between 1978 and 1984, and subsequently on other channels. The French version replaces the original theme(s) with a French song, singing about &quot;Starsky et Hutch&quot;. The voices of the two French actors dubbing the series, who also introduced more comedy in their role, played a part in the popularity of the series in France. One of the voice-over actors later said that David Soul had acknowledged that he and Paul Michael Glaser had to be much more restrained when they played.
* In the United Kingdom, the series was an immediate hit when it began showing on Saturday nights on BBC1 (debuting April 23, 1976, and soon catching up with US broadcasts), with occasional repeats through to the early 1990s. During its prime-time run, however, the BBC heavily edited certain episodes; in fact, the first-series episode &quot;The Fix&quot; (in which mobsters inject Hutch with heroin in order to extract information from him) was deemed too graphic and was effectively &quot;banned&quot; from all the corporation&#x27;s runs of the series (despite being shown after the 9 p.m. &#x27;watershed&#x27;). &quot;The Fix&quot; wasn&#x27;t shown on British-terrestrial television until May 31, 1999, as part of Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;Starsky &amp; Hutch Night,&quot; which also included the pilot, &quot;The Word On The Street&quot; - a documentary about the series - and the second-series episode &quot;Gillian&quot;. The BBC broadcast the series in a different order to the US run, and as the Radio Times listings did not always give episode titles, the exact first-run order for the series is not entirely clear. &quot;Savage Sunday&quot; was omitted from the first Season One broadcast, and there is no listed later airing of the episode. There are also no Radio Times listed airdates for the episodes &quot;Vendetta,&quot; &quot;Nightmare,&quot; &quot;Bloodbath,&quot; or &quot;Murder Ward.&quot; The series was rerun by Five in 2003 in a 10 a.m. slot (later 11 a.m., and eventually moving to a 2:30 p.m. slot); was also shown on the UK satellite channel Granada Plus, and is now running on Zone Thriller, which was rebranded as CBS Action in November 2009. The channel has broadcast all episodes, with minor edits in a few cases. In August 2019, the channel True Entertainment, which later became Sony Channel, are now showing repeats. 
* The first season is frequently aired on MBC 2 in the Middle East.
* In Australia it airs on Digital Channel Go!. In 2014, it started to be shown on 7mate. It was a perennial favourite, seen on the Nine Network from 1975 to 1991 and, lastly, on ABC Television in 1992. Prior to GO!, it screened on TV1.
* In Indonesia, the show was aired on RCTI from 1990 to 1994.
* In Malaysia it currently reruns on RTM&#x27;s TV2, placed in Best of Retro slot, in 2009.
* In Venezuela, the show was aired on Venevisión.
* In Mexico, it was broadcast on Televisa.
* In Algeria, the show was aired in French on ENTV state television during the second half of the 80&#x27;s, and was a big success.
* In Puerto Rico, the show was aired on WKAQ-TV, Channel 2 (Telemundo) during the mid to late 70&#x27;s. It was dubbed in Spanish.
* In Japan, the show was aired on TBS Television from 1977 to 1981.

==Cars==

Stunt cars, camera cars, tow cars, dolly cars, and cars used for &quot;beauty&quot; shots varied in model year from 1974 to 1976 Ford Torinos, since the body style of the Gran Torino was unchanged.

Originally, Blinn was to have Starsky drive a Chevrolet Camaro convertible because he fondly remembered a green and white one that he owned. However, when production started on the pilot episode, Ford Motor Company&#x27;s Studio-TV Car Loan Program was the lease supplier for Spelling-Goldberg.

They looked at lease stock and chose two 1975 351 Windsor V8-powered (VIN code &quot;H&quot;) &quot;Bright Red&quot; (paint code 2B) 2-door Gran Torinos. Both cars had a role in the pilot movie, one being &quot;Starsky&#x27;s&quot; car, and the other being a similar car which is mistaken for Starsky&#x27;s car by the film&#x27;s villains. They each had body-side mouldings along with a black interior with vinyl bench seats. One of the pilot cars had the luxury remote-control chrome mirrors installed, while the other pilot car had the cheaper, entry-level manual chrome mirrors installed; in editing the film, Starsky and Hutch are shown to be driving around in each of the two cars at different times during the film.

The cars were also custom painted (on top of the factory red paint color) with the distinctive white &quot;vector&quot; stripe designed by Spelling-Goldberg&#x27;s transportation coordinator George Grenier. The rear ends were lifted by air shocks, and had Ansen Sprint 5-slot mag wheels added with larger rear tires. While the tires were mounted so that only the black wall side would show, thus hiding any unauthorized brand-name display, in one first-season episode (&quot;Kill Huggy Bear&quot;), a close-up shot of the villain cutting the rear brake lines shows the letters on the inside-facing side of the tires to say Firestone.

It is reported that the original 2.75:1 ratio rear axle gearing (standard on non-police Torinos from 1975 onward) was replaced with numerically higher ratio gears for better acceleration during stunt driving scenes; in the 1999 interview, Glaser said that &quot;we finally had to get a new rear end put in it so that at zero to sixty it had some pop&quot;. At least one of the second-season cars was known to have a Dymo label prominently attached to the dashboard which read &quot;DO NOT EXCEED 50 MPH&quot;; this was probably due to the fact that the revised gearing would cause the engine RPM to go to a higher level, possibly leading to engine damage.
In the &quot;Behind The Badge&quot; interviews, Glaser said that during the early stages of production of the pilot, Spelling took him outside to introduce him to the red &amp; white-striped, mag-wheeled Torino. Glaser took an immediate and long-lasting dislike to the car, which has not changed to this day. According to Glaser in several early interviews, there were three main reasons why he instantly hated the car: First, in his opinion, it was big, ugly and childish-looking. Secondly, the idea that two undercover cops would drive around in a car with such an outlandish appearance seemed ludicrous, and lastly, he does not like Ford products (although in a picture that was printed in an issue of the &quot;National Enquirer&quot;, Glaser is shown on the side of a California freeway with a flat-tired Ford Explorer). At the first viewing of the car with David Soul (Hutch), Glaser remarked that the car looked like a &quot;striped tomato&quot;. That nickname stuck, and very soon the show&#x27;s writers had worked it into the show as Hutch&#x27;s derogatory name for Starsky&#x27;s beloved Torino.

Glaser remarked to Soul that he hated the car and that he was &quot;going to destroy that car...burn it down every chance I get&quot;, and repeated the story in the 1999 &quot;reunion&quot; interview. Several scenes of Glaser driving the car show him smashing the front wheels into curbs as he slides the car around corners and such, but that may also be attributable to the fact that he is primarily an actor, not a trained stunt-driver. Over the years, the &quot;Starsky &amp; Hutch&quot; Torino increased in popularity and became a much-loved icon of the show and of the Seventies in general. Glaser has not grown to appreciate the car as he has learned to simply accept its popularity as a necessary component of the fans&#x27; appreciation of the show.

In fact, during filming of the 2004 &quot;Starsky &amp; Hutch&quot; film adaptation, Glaser had several opportunities to sit in the newest iteration of &quot;his&quot; car, and even drive them, but he refused. He just was not interested, but in 2004, during the last day of filming a movie in Canada, the crew wanted a group picture of Glaser with a &quot;Starsky and Hutch&quot; Torino, so he agreed to sit in the driver&#x27;s seat of a Limited Edition replica with the crew surrounding the car. In the summer of 2012 during the introduction to the &quot;Las Vegas Car Stars 2012&quot; charity event, Glaser drove up in a S&amp;H Torino replica; after being introduced by the master of ceremonies, he got out of the Torino and was cheered by the crowd.

High-performance engine sounds were dubbed over scenes during the show because California law forbade mechanically modifying the engines of new cars. When the pilot was successful, Spelling-Goldberg ordered two new 1975 red Gran Torinos for the first season. These cars were powered by 400 V8s (VIN code &quot;S&quot;) because extra power was going to be needed for additional stunt driving scenes. These new cars for the first-season were factory ordered in the bright-red color (Ford paint code: 2B), which was a regular production color for 1975 Torinos.

Unlike the pilot-movie cars, the first-season Torinos had no body-side mouldings, but did have body-colored sport mirrors, and brocade cloth split-bench seats. With the acquisition of the new cars, the producers took the opportunity to improve the design of the white stripe painted on the cars. The original pilot-movie cars had the bottom horizontal edge of the stripe about an inch or so above the mid-body character line that ran along the car, which was apparently done so that the section of the stripe that passes above the front-wheel opening would not be cut off by the wheel opening, but for the first-season cars, the bottom horizontal edge of the stripe was lowered until directly on the crease, which gave a more cohesive look to the design of the stripe. The section of stripe that runs across the front-wheel opening was gradually curved up and around the opening. The stripe was also thicker on the roof section, and whereas the front pointed section ended well behind the amber marker light on the pilot cars, the newer design had the point ending far ahead of it on the front fascia piece. These new cars also featured the complete bumper-protection group option, which included horizontal black rub-strips on both bumpers that were not included on the pilot cars.

For the start of the second season, these were replaced by two 1976 Gran Torinos that had vinyl split-bench seats like the pilot-episode cars. The new cars were ordered under Ford&#x27;s fleet program, which is what was required to get them painted in the previous year&#x27;s Bright Red(2B), as Ford used a different shade of red for new standard-order Torinos by this point.

These newer cars can be identified by their silver sight shields (bumper-filler panels) which Ford used on specially painted fleet-ordered cars. They also had the luxury-chrome mirrors like one of the pilot cars. Even though the body-colored sport mirrors were still a Torino option in 1976, they could not be installed on a fleet-ordered specialty-painted car, as Ford had no provision for producing those mirrors in anything other than the regular production colors listed for that year; since the 2B bright red was a special fleet-ordered color for the &#x27;76 model year, the cars came equipped with the chrome mirrors. The body-side mouldings were installed on these cars and the stripe was, unlike the pilot cars, integrated with the mouldings.

They were powered by 460 Lima V8s (VIN code &quot;A&quot;), and Spelling-Goldberg kept these Torinos until production ceased. While these were the biggest, most powerful engines available from Ford at the time, even with dual exhaust, they were still somewhat underpowered at 202 net horsepower. A third car, owned by 20th Century Fox and 351 Windsor powered, was used as the first backup to the Ford lease cars.

Over time, an unforeseen problem was discovered with the Torinos when they were used during stunt driving scenes. In sharp right-hand turns, Soul would sometimes slide accidentally across the vinyl bench into Glaser. Although a potential safety hazard at the time, the problem was solved by replacing the front bench of the number two Torino with bucket seats at Glaser and Soul&#x27;s request; Glaser said in 1999: &quot;It took us a year to get them to put bucket seats in it so David wouldn&#x27;t slide all over the place whenever I took a corner&quot;.

The aggressive stunt driving required of the show resulted in many accidents and fender-benders for the Torinos. The time demands of a weekly production mandated quick body and paint repairs so the cars could get back to work as soon as possible, and many of the quick and often sloppy repairs are quite evident to eagle-eyed viewers of the show. The front fenders seemed to have taken a lot of abuse, and the Gran Torino nameplates on the front fenders are missing in several episodes, as are the chrome wheelhouse moldings.

Towards the end of the four seasons of production, the Torinos were noticeably worse-for-wear, and close watchers of the later episodes will spot many dents and other damage on the cars as they appear in various episodes. In particular, the driver&#x27;s side quarter panel and tail-light area were seen to be smashed up in 4th-season episodes, and at least one of the cars was shown to have a dented and twisted front bumper along with some visible damage to the grille behind. The last appearance of the Torino on the series seems to show that the driver&#x27;s door and window will not even close correctly, possibly due to the rigours and effects of the spirited stunt driving the car suffered over the years.

Glaser deliberately mistreated the cars during close-up stunt scenes when he drove (this was admitted to in a 1997 letter he wrote to the owner of the #1 Torino; and in a first-season DVD interview he said that he tried to &quot;destroy&quot; the cars) and would often stop the car by hitting the front wheels against curbs, as well as coming into driveways at high speed and bumping into garbage dumpsters.

Due to the success of S&amp;H, in 1976 (the Torino&#x27;s final year) Ford released a limited edition (only 1,305 units total, plus three pilot production cars) &quot;Starsky and Hutch&quot; replica Gran Torino. Manufactured at the Chicago plant, one of these code &quot;PS 122&quot; units was leased by Spelling-Goldberg from the middle of season two until the series&#x27; end as a second backup for the main cars and was known simply as &quot;Unit 129&quot;. It was originally equipped with a 351 Modified (also VIN code &quot;H&quot;); however, during filming, one of the stuntmen damaged the engine beyond repair, and it was replaced overnight with a 429 Lima V8.

During the last season of &quot;Starsky &amp; Hutch&quot;, &quot;The Dukes of Hazzard&quot; premiered on CBS, and one of the factory replicas was used in the first episode, &quot;One Armed Bandits&quot;, seen to be driven by regular character Cooter Davenport (Ben L. Jones). This was the only appearance of the Torino in the series, and many fans have speculated over its strange one-off appearance. One theory is that it was merely an in-joke, with the Torino&#x27;s former iconic car status now being taken over by the Dukes&#x27; Dodge Charger car &quot;The General Lee&quot;.

After &quot;Starsky &amp; Hutch&quot; was canceled, the cars were returned to Ford&#x27;s Studio-TV Car Lease Program and sold at a Ford Motor Company auction to A.E. Barber Ford of Ventura, California. The first retail sale of Torino #1 was to a resident of Ojai, California; he owned it for one year, then sold it in a private sale to an Air Force officer that owned it for 17 years. In 1988, Torino #1 was purchased by an Ohio resident; he sold it in 2012 to Cars of the Stars Motor Museum in the United Kingdom. A few years later, Torino #1 was sold to Dezer Car Collection in Miami, Florida. Dezer sold Torino #1 in a private auction in January 2015 to a Texas collector; at the time, it was mostly unrestored and somewhat battered due to wear and tear from TV-show filming and subsequent ownership. It still had its original 460 V8, interior, and paint; however, Mickey Thompson valve covers and a chrome air cleaner were added by the first owner after he purchased it from Barber Ford. The Texas collector has since done a &quot;sympathetic&quot; frame-off restoration.
Torino #2 is owned by a New Jersey man who supplied the main close-up Torino (featured on the movie posters) for 2004&#x27;s big-screen &quot;Starsky &amp; Hutch&quot; movie.

During its life after &quot;Starsky &amp; Hutch&quot;, #2 was wrecked and sold as salvage. It was repaired, although it was repainted the wrong shade of red and the iconic stripe was improperly painted. Although still equipped with bucket seats, #2 no longer has its original 460 engine, which was replaced at some point with a 2.8-liter Ford V-6. The car underwent a full restoration in a Pennsylvania Shop and is back on the road. Finally, the 20th Century Fox Torino was purchased in 2009 by the owner of #2, sold to an Oklahoma couple in 2010, and restored. &quot;Unit 129&quot; was owned by a collector in New Hampshire; as of May 2018, it is for sale by a Florida collector vehicle dealer.

In addition, the Torino has many fans and sparked a collectors market in the United Kingdom, as evidenced by the large number of UK-owned replicas (both factory and aftermarket). The red Torino&#x27;s fame also led to a number of people customizing their own red vehicles with the distinctive white vector stripe, and with varying levels of success.

==Theme music==
The first season of the show had a dark and ominous theme written by Lalo Schifrin that seemed to fit the hard action and violence of the season; the main title version was edited down from the chase climax cue of his score for the pilot episode (the climax contains the shot of Hutch leaping off a fire escape and landing on his car which appears in the opening titles of all subsequent episodes). The end credits featured a similar piece of ominous music.

The first season theme was replaced for the second season by a Tom Scott written theme entitled &quot;Gotcha&quot;. &quot;Gotcha&quot; is the best known of the show&#x27;s themes, and has been covered by several musicians, including the James Taylor Quartet and The Ventures. It also appears on the title screen of the Nintendo Entertainment System game &quot;Treasure Master&quot;, covered by Tim Follin. A version of &quot;Gotcha&quot; was featured on Scott&#x27;s 1977 album &quot;Blow It Out&quot; and is also on the album &quot;Best Of Tom Scott&quot;. For the third season, a more dramatic theme was used that highlighted the show&#x27;s move to more socially conscious and light-hearted stories. It was written by Mark Snow and released on an LP around 1979.

A reworked &quot;Gotcha&quot;, similar in style (but not identical) to the version on &quot;Blow It Out&quot;, returned for the fourth and last season. The revamped version was the most easy-going of the different themes for the series, reflecting the last season&#x27;s increased &quot;buddy cop&quot; feel.

Schifrin, Scott and Snow also scored several episodes; Alan Silvestri also worked on the series, scoring three episodes.

<doc id="459244" wikidata="Q319014" url="?curid=459244" title="Central European Free Trade Agreement">
<text>The Central European Free Trade Agreement (CEFTA) is an international trade agreement between countries mostly located in Southeastern Europe. Founded by representatives of Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia, CEFTA in 2006 expanded to Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Moldova, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Romania, Serbia, Slovenia and Kosovo.

== Members ==
As of 2024, the parties of the CEFTA agreement are: Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, Moldova, Montenegro, North Macedonia and Serbia.

Former parties are Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia. Their CEFTA memberships ended when they became member states of the European Union (EU). Kosovo was originally represented by UNMIK, but began representing itself from October 2024.

== Membership criteria ==

Former Poznań Declaration criteria:
* World Trade Organization membership
* European Union Association Agreement with provisions for future full membership
* Free Trade Agreements with the current CEFTA member states

Current criteria since Zagreb meeting in 2005:
* WTO membership &quot;or commitment to respect all WTO regulations&quot;
* &quot;any&quot; European Union Association Agreement
* Free Trade Agreements with the current CEFTA member states

== Current members ==
== History ==
===Original agreement===
The original CEFTA agreement was signed by the Visegrád Group countries, that is by Poland, Hungary and Czechia and Slovakia (at the time parts of the Czechoslovakia) on 21 December 1992 in Kraków, Poland. It came into force in July 1994. Through CEFTA, participating countries hoped to mobilize efforts to integrate into Western European institutions and through this, to join European political, economic, security and legal systems, thereby consolidating democracy and free-market economics.

The agreement was amended by the agreements signed on 11 September 1995 in Brno and on 4 July 2003 in Bled.

Slovenia joined CEFTA in 1996, Romania in 1997, Bulgaria in 1999, Croatia in 2003 and Macedonia in 2006.

===2006 agreement===
All of the parties of the original agreement had now joined the EU and thus left CEFTA. Therefore, it was decided to extend CEFTA to cover the rest of the Western Balkans, which already had completed a matrix of bilateral free trade agreements in the framework of the Stability Pact for South Eastern Europe. On 6 April 2006, at the South East Europe Prime Ministers Summit in Bucharest, a joint declaration on expansion of CEFTA to Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Moldova, Serbia, Montenegro and UNMIK (on behalf of Kosovo) was adopted. Kosovo is directly represented in CEFTA since October 2024. Accession of Ukraine has also been discussed. The new enlarged agreement was initialled on 9 November 2006 in Brussels and was signed on 19 December 2006 at the South East European Prime Ministers Summit in Bucharest. The agreement came into effect on 26 July 2007 for Albania, Kosovo, Moldova, Montenegro and Macedonia, on 22 August for Croatia, on 24 October for Serbia, and on 22 November 2007 for Bosnia and Herzegovina. The aim of the agreement was to establish a free trade zone in the region by 31 December 2010.

CEFTA 2006 aims at expanding regional trade in goods and services, creating an attractive environment for investment, and contributing to economic development and cooperation within the Parties. Laying down on the principles of WTO rules and procedures and harmonising its policies with the EU legislation, CEFTA provides an effective instrument for the Parties to accelerate their European integration agenda. Since the establishing, CEFTA has been deepening the areas of cooperation based on the needs of the businesses and strengthening trading relations between the Parties. From achieving the full liberalisation of trade in goods and further liberalisation in trade in services, via reducing trade related costs, harmonising the policies within the Parties based on the EU legislation, to expediting trade between Parties through electronic exchange of information, CEFTA has proven as a framework that ensures transparent trade relations between the Parties that can enable the businesses to improve their capacities for different markets.

== Chair-in-office ==
The Chair-in-office rotates between member states:
* 2007 : 
* 2008 : 
* 2009 : 
* 2010 : 
* 2011 : UNMIK on behalf of Kosovo
* 2012 : 
* 2013 : 
* 2014 : 
* 2015 : 
* 2016 : 
* 2017 : 
* 2018 : UNMIK on behalf of Kosovo

* 2020 : 
* 2021 : 
* 2022 : 
* 2023 : 
* 2024 : 
* 2025 : 

== Relations with the European Union ==
All former participating countries had previously signed association agreements with the EU, so in fact CEFTA has served as a preparation for full European Union membership. Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovakia, Slovenia joined the EU on 1 May 2004, with Bulgaria and Romania following suit on 1 January 2007. Croatia joined the EU on 1 July 2013.

Montenegro, Serbia, Albania, and North Macedonia have been undergoing EU accession talks since 2012, 2014 and 2022.

<doc id="459248" wikidata="Q759783" url="?curid=459248" title="Scout cruiser">
<text>A scout cruiser was a type of warship of the early 20th century, which were smaller, faster, more lightly armed and armoured than protected cruisers or light cruisers, but larger than contemporary destroyers. Intended for fleet scouting duties and acting as a flotilla leader, a scout cruiser was typically armed with six to ten destroyer-type guns of 3-inch (76 mm) to 4.7-inch (120 mm) calibre, plus two to four torpedo tubes.

The British were the first to operate scout cruisers, when the Royal Navy acquired 15 ships divided into two distinct groups - the eight vessels all ordered under the 1903 Programme, and the seven later, heavier-armed vessels ordered under the 1907–1910 Programmes. All these ships served in World War I, when the advent of better machinery and larger, faster destroyers and light cruisers had already made them obsolete.

The other major operator of scout cruisers was the Kingdom of Italy. With no conventional protected cruisers or light cruisers planned between 1900 and 1928, the Italian Royal Navy () instead operated a number of scout cruisers (&quot;esploratori&quot;) from 1912 onwards. Ranging in size from enlarged destroyers to substantial, light cruiser-like ships, these &quot;esploratori&quot; were also given secondary capabilities as fast minelayers. Later &quot;esploratori&quot;, such as the , carried extremely heavy armament for their modest size, capable of outgunning any destroyer of the early 1920s. However, by 1938 the surviving &quot;esploratori&quot; were re-rated as destroyers.

<doc id="459250" wikidata="Q2141683" url="?curid=459250" title="Ms. Pac-Man">
<text>is a maze arcade video game developed by General Computer Corporation and published by Midway in 1982. It is a sequel to &quot;Pac-Man&quot; (1980) and the first entry in the series to not be made by Namco. Controlling the title character, Pac-Man&#x27;s wife, the player is tasked with eating all of the pellets in an enclosed maze while avoiding four colored ghosts. Eating the larger &quot;power pellets&quot; lets the player eat the ghosts, which turn blue and flee.

General Computer made the game as a modification kit for the original &quot;Pac-Man&quot;, titled &quot;Crazy Otto&quot;. However, due to previous legal action with Atari, Inc., GCC was forced to present the project to Midway, the North American distributor of &quot;Pac-Man&quot;. Midway purchased the project and enlisted GCC to use the game as a basis for the sequel to &quot;Pac-Man&quot;. Multiple names were considered for the game, including &quot;Miss Pac-Man&quot; and &quot;Mrs. Pac-Man&quot;, before the final name was chosen for being easier to pronounce. While development had started without Namco&#x27;s consent, company president Masaya Nakamura was brought in and provided feedback on the player character&#x27;s design. The company ultimately collected the same royalties on each cabinet as they had with &quot;Pac-Man&quot;.

&quot;Ms. Pac-Man&quot; was acclaimed by critics for its improvements to the original gameplay and for having a female protagonist; some have described it as superior to &quot;Pac-Man&quot;. It has been listed among the greatest video games of all time and as one of the most successful American arcade games ever made. The game&#x27;s success inspired a variety of successful merchandise, several ports for numerous home consoles and handheld systems, a television cartoon that included Pac-Man, and numerous video game sequels and remakes which spawned a &quot;Ms. Pac-Man&quot; video game spin-off series. The rights to the game are owned by Namco&#x27;s successor company, Bandai Namco Entertainment. However, the game and its title character have suffered legal ownership issues between Namco and General Computer Corporation.

==Gameplay==
The gameplay is very similar to that of &quot;Pac-Man&quot;. The player earns points by eating pellets and avoiding ghosts (contact with one causes Ms. Pac-Man to lose a life). Eating an energizer (or &quot;power pellet&quot;) causes the ghosts to turn blue, allowing them to be eaten for extra points. Bonus fruits can be eaten for increasing point values, twice per round. As the rounds progress, the speed increases, and energizers generally lessen the duration of the ghosts&#x27; vulnerability, eventually stopping altogether.

===Differences from &quot;Pac-Man&quot;===
* The game has four mazes that appear in different color schemes and alternate after each of the game&#x27;s intermissions are seen. The pink maze appears in levels one and two; the light blue maze appears in levels three, four, and five; the brown maze appears in levels six to nine; and the dark blue maze appears in levels 10 to 14. After level 14, the maze configurations alternate every fourth level.
* The first, second, and fourth mazes have two sets of warp tunnels, as opposed to only one in the original maze.
* The walls have a solid color rather than an outline, which makes it easier for a novice player to see where the paths around the mazes are.
* The orange ghost is called Sue, rather than Clyde; her color was later changed to purple in &quot;Pac-Land&quot; to differentiate her.
* The ghosts&#x27; behavioral patterns are different, and include semi-random movement, which prevents the use of patterns to clear each round. Blinky (red) and Pinky (pink) move randomly in the first several seconds of each level, until the first reversal. Inky (cyan) and Sue (orange) still use the same movement patterns from the previous game to their respective corners, again until the first reversal.
* Instead of appearing in the center of the maze, the fruits bounce around the maze, entering and (if not eaten) leaving through the warp tunnels. Once all fruit has been encountered, they appear in random sequence for the rest of the game, starting on the eighth round; a 5000-point banana can be followed by a 100-point pair of cherries.
* When Ms. Pac-Man makes contact with a ghost and dies, she spins around, or as the back of the flier says, &quot;she dramatically swoons and falls&quot; rather than folding in on herself as the original Pac-Man did.
* The three intermissions follow the developing relationship between the original Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man (from when they first meet to having a stork drop off their baby). The latter served as the basis for &quot;Baby Pac-Man&quot; and is referenced in &quot;Jr. Pac-Man&quot;.
* The slowdown applied to the ghosts in the warp tunnels only applies for the first three rounds in this game.
* The sound effects and music are all new.

==Development and release==
&quot;Ms. Pac-Man&quot; was originally conceived as an enhancement kit for &quot;Pac-Man&quot; called &quot;Crazy Otto&quot;, created by programmers employed at the General Computer Corporation (GCC). While &quot;Crazy Otto&quot; was in development, GCC settled a lawsuit with Atari, Inc. over their &quot;Missile Command&quot; conversion kit &quot;Super Missile Attack&quot;. Part of the settlement terms barred GCC from selling conversion kits without consent from the original game manufacturer.

Rather than scrapping &quot;Crazy Otto&quot; entirely, the programmers chose to present the finished game to Midway, Namco&#x27;s American distributor of &quot;Pac-Man&quot;. Midway was enthusiastic that such a game had come to their attention, as they were hoping to capitalize on the success of &quot;Pac-Man&quot; with a sequel. They bought the rights to &quot;Crazy Otto&quot; and worked with GCC and Namco to prepare the game for release. In the final development, the game&#x27;s name and characters experienced multiple changes. Sprites, text and minor game elements were altered to better reflect the &quot;Pac-Man&quot; series.

The game was initially titled &quot;Super Pac-Man&quot;, containing Pac-Man as the lead character. Inspired by the cutscenes of &quot;Crazy Otto&quot;, featuring Crazy Otto&#x27;s female counterpart. The lead character was made female and the game was renamed &quot;Pac-Woman&quot;. That name was dropped in favor of &quot;Miss Pac-Man&quot;, but the developers then realized that, given the third intermission showing a stork delivering a baby to Pac-Man and the player&#x27;s character, confusion could arise about their relationship. In light of this, the name was changed to &quot;Mrs. Pac-Man&quot;, and then finally to &quot;Ms. Pac-Man&quot;, which rolled off the tongue more easily. Programmer Steve Golson said: &quot;In the span of just two weeks, it went from &quot;Crazy Otto&quot; to &quot;Super Pac-Man&quot; to &quot;Miss Pac-Man&quot;.&quot; These later changes (&quot;Miss&quot;, &quot;Mrs.&quot;, and &quot;Ms.&quot;) all occurred within 72 hours of actual production.

Shortly before release, Stan Jarocki of Midway stated that &quot;Ms. Pac-Man&quot; was conceived in part as a response to the original &quot;Pac-Man&quot; being &quot;the first commercial videogame to involve large numbers of women as players,&quot; and it was &quot;our way of thanking all those lady arcaders who have played and enjoyed &quot;Pac-Man&quot;.&quot; According to one 1982 estimate, a majority of &quot;Pac-Man&quot; players were women. This is corroborated by marketing chief Michael Leone of the Castle Park Entertainment Center, who noted his company &quot;noticed a recent trend in our game pavilions that indicates a tremendous female acceptance of the &quot;Pac-Man&quot; game&quot;, further noting it &quot;was only natural for Midway...to introduce a Ms. Pac-Man.&quot;

GCC co-founder Doug Macrae noted Masaya Nakamura, Namco&#x27;s president at the time, gave him direct feedback on the Ms. Pac-Man character. In an interview, Macrae said: &quot;We sent out ROMs to Midway, and they sent them over to Japan for the President of Namco, Masaya Nakamura, to look at. He said: &#x27;Love the concept, get rid of the hair.&#x27;&quot; He added: &quot;There was a little bit of embarrassment [at Namco] of the fact that the sequel was being done somewhere other than in their own laboratories. ...The arrangement that Namco had with Midway was that Namco would still get their royalty on &quot;Ms. Pac-Man&quot;...and Midway could choose to do whatever they wanted in paying us a royalty in addition to Namco.&quot;

Toru Iwatani, the creator of &quot;Pac-Man&quot;, is not known to have publicly commented on &quot;Ms. Pac-Man&quot;, despite questions from reporters.

===Release and versions===
Reporter Patrick Goldstein of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; reported that the game made its public debut on February 3, 1982 &quot;in typical showbusiness style at a press conference at the Castle Park Entertainment Center in Sherman Oaks.&quot; He noted that &quot;[t]he game is expected to appear in many video arcades during the next few weeks.&quot;

Atari, Inc. released versions for the Atari 2600, Atari 5200, Atari 7800 and Atari 8-bit computers. There were also versions for the VIC-20, Commodore 64, ZX Spectrum, IBM PC compatibles, Apple II and TI-99/4A released under the Atarisoft label. Unlike &quot;Pac-Man&quot;, most home versions of &quot;Ms. Pac-Man&quot; include all three intermission screens from the arcade game. The Atari 2600 rendition of &quot;Pac-Man&quot; was infamous for its flashing ghosts, while the 2600 port of &quot;Ms. Pac-Man&quot; had minimal flicker.

A tabletop version of &quot;Ms. Pac-Man&quot; was released in 1983 by Coleco. The unit was shaped like a miniature arcade cabinet, was controlled with a small built-in joystick, and used a multicolor vacuum fluorescent display. It was a runner-up for Stand-Alone Game of the Year at the 1983 Arcade Awards held in January 1984. 

===Later ports and re-releases===
====Hardware====
&quot;Ms. Pac-Man&quot; has been re-released into new arcade cabinets since. In 2001, Namco released an arcade board with both &quot;Ms. Pac-Man&quot; and &quot;Galaga&quot; in honor of the 20th anniversary of both games with the subtitle &quot;20 Year Reunion / Class of 1981&quot;. It also has &quot;Pac-Man&quot; as a hidden bonus game. The later 25th Anniversary Edition in 2005 allows all three games to be selected on the main menu. As part of Pac-Man&#x27;s 30th anniversary, &quot;Ms. Pac-Man&quot; is one of the games included on the home version of &quot;Pac-Man&#x27;s Arcade Party&quot; arcade machine. &quot;Pac-Man&#x27;s Arcade Party&quot; was succeeded in 2018 by &quot;Pac-Man&#x27;s Pixel Bash&quot;, which added 19 games to the existing roster, but &quot;Ms. Pac-Man&quot; was only available if the machine was set to Free Play.

In June 2020, Tastemakers&#x27; Arcade1Up decided to announce that &quot;Ms. Pac-Man&quot; would finally be added to their lineup of 3/4 scale arcade cabinets. The unit will also contain a few other Bandai Namco arcade games, including &quot;Galaxian&quot;, &quot;Pac-Mania&quot; and &quot;Pac-Man Plus&quot;.

Additionally, a standalone, battery-powered version of the game released by Jakks Pacific can be plugged directly into a television. &quot;Ms. Pac-Man&quot; and four other games (&quot;Galaga&quot;, &quot;Mappy&quot;, &quot;Xevious&quot;, and &quot;Pole Position&quot;) are included in a self-contained joystick hand controller.

====Software ports====
&quot;Ms. Pac-Man&quot; has also been retroactively ported and adapted to various home and portable systems, which are detailed in the table below:

Regarding legal issues in later years, the character&#x27;s final official, playable appearance was in a &quot;Pac-Man&quot; crossover event for &quot;Sonic Dash&quot; in 2018, while her final official appearance whatsoever was as a minor cameo in the background of the &quot;Pac-Land&quot; stage in &quot;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate&quot;, later in the same year.

==Ownership==
The GCC group agreed on October 29, 1981, to give the rights to &quot;Ms. Pac-Man&quot; to Midway in exchange for royalty payments for the game&#x27;s sale. At the time, Midway held the license from Namco for distribution of &quot;Pac-Man&quot; games, advertising, and merchandise in North America. After the game became wildly successful, Midway and GCC undertook a legal battle concerning merchandise royalties before ultimately reaching a settlement in 1983. This settlement stated that GCC members would be paid royalties by Midway for usage of Ms. Pac-Man in commercial contexts.

Namco (now Bandai Namco) made an additional agreement with the GCC stakeholders in 2008. While Bandai Namco does control the Ms. Pac-Man copyright and intellectual property, some royalty rights and obligations are unresolved.

===AtGames dispute===
In August 2019, AtGames, a company that specializes in microconsoles featuring older arcade games, acquired the royalties owed to GCC. AtGames had initially approached the GCC group members about licensing &quot;Ms. Pac-Man&quot; for potential products. Bandai Namco, upon learning that AtGames had been seeking these rights for a possible mini-arcade game, filed a lawsuit against AtGames alleging AtGames misrepresented itself as licensed to make &quot;Ms. Pac-Man&quot; products, and created &quot;Ms. Pac-Man&quot; mini-cabinets under those claims. It also alleged false advertising, unfair competition, and copyright infringement.

The case was ultimately dismissed with prejudice on October 27, 2020, following a request by Bandai Namco. Presiding Judge Vince Chhabria stated that &quot;all involved parties [had] resolved the case of their own accord.&quot; The details of the settlement were kept confidential, and the current status of the &quot;Ms. Pac-Man&quot; royalties is undisclosed.

Beginning with the &quot;Arcade Archives&quot; release of &quot;Pac-Land&quot; in 2022, the Ms. Pac-Man character has been removed from games which previously featured her. In her place is a new character known as Pac-Mom, who also replaces her in the &quot;Pac-Man Museum+&quot; versions of &quot;Pac-Land&quot;, &quot;Pac-In-Time&quot; and &quot;Pac-Attack&quot;, and in &quot;Pac-Man World Re-Pac&quot;, a remake of &quot;Pac-Man World&quot;. The character had also been removed from the &quot;Arcade Archives&quot; release of &quot;Tinkle Pit&quot; in 2024, which saw Pac-Mom replace Ms. Pac-Man&#x27;s appearances in the game. Bandai Namco has not given an official reason for the change, but news outlets have assumed that it was done to avoid legal problems with AtGames.

==Reception==
In the United States, &quot;Ms. Pac-Man&quot; topped the monthly &quot;RePlay&quot; upright arcade cabinet charts for much of 1982, including most months between April and December. &quot;Pac-Man&quot; and &quot;Ms. Pac-Man&quot; also topped the US &quot;RePlay&quot; cocktail arcade cabinet charts for 23 months, from February 1982 through 1983 up until February 1984. It was listed as the highest-grossing arcade game of 1982 by &quot;Cash Box&quot; and the Amusement &amp; Music Operators Association (AMOA), whereas &quot;RePlay&quot; magazine listed &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; as the year&#x27;s highest-grossing title. &quot;Cash Box&quot; later listed &quot;Ms. Pac-Man&quot; as one of the top two highest-grossing arcade games of 1983, along with &quot;Pole Position&quot;. It was later listed by AMOA as one of the top five highest-grossing arcade video games of 1984.

&quot;Ms. Pac-Man&quot; sold 125,000 arcade units by 1988, grossed by 1987, and has grossed ( adjusted for inflation) . &quot;InfoWorld&quot; stated that Atarisoft&#x27;s &quot;Ms. Pac-Man&quot; for the Commodore 64 was as good as the best-selling Atari 8-bit version. The Genesis version of the game sold more than one million copies in the United States.

The arcade game was awarded a Certificate of Merit as runner-up for Coin-Op Game of the Year at the 1982 Arcade Awards held in January 1983.

===Non-arcade versions===
In January 1984, the Atari 2600 port of &quot;Ms. Pac-Man&quot; won the Videogame of the Year award at the 1983 Arcade Awards, tied with &quot;Lady Bug&quot;.

&quot;Computer Games&quot; magazine called the Commodore 64 version a &quot;Spectacular&quot; and &quot;Incredible&quot; conversion, while stating that the Atari 5200 and IBM PC versions suffered from limitations, but were nevertheless &quot;enjoyable&quot; ports. They later gave a &quot;Classic&quot; rating for other home computer versions, calling &quot;Ms. Pac-Man&quot; the &quot;greatest&quot; maze game. Reviewing the Super NES version, three of &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot;″s four reviewers said the gameplay is timeless and universally appealing, and the enhancements appealing. The fourth, Sushi-X, felt the original game was a cheap cash-in on the popularity of &quot;Pac-Man&quot;, and had not aged well. Doctor Devon of &quot;GamePro&quot; liked the original game, but questioned the value of the Super NES port since it has somewhat frustrating controls, and since &quot;Ms. Pac-Man&quot; had already appeared on the Super NES in the form of an unlockable in &quot;Pac-Man 2: The New Adventures&quot;.

In &quot;STart&quot;, Clayton Walnum praised the Lynx version&#x27;s new mazes and the added twist of the lightning power-ups, and found the game transferred well to the small screen. Julian Rignall reviewed the Atari Lynx port for &quot;CVG Magazine&quot;, writing that &quot;it offers a fun and non-violent challenge which will appeal to anyone&quot; giving a final score of 79 out of 100. Les Ellis reviewed the game for &quot;Raze&quot; in February 1991, stating that he liked the &quot;neat little between-level scenes&quot; and the &quot;jolly title tune&quot;, and giving the game a final score of 79%. Robert A. Jung of &quot;IGN&quot; gave the Lynx version a final score of eight out of ten, writing: &quot;A decent adaptation overall, and a good game in its own right.&quot;

Reviewing the Game Gear version, &quot;GamePro&quot; commented &quot;If you loved the &quot;Pac-Man&quot; games, then you loved &quot;Ms. Pac-Man&quot;, and if you loved &quot;Ms. Pac-Man&quot; at the arcades, you&#x27;ll love her here, too.&quot;

=== Retrospective recognition ===
In 1996, &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; reported that the Genesis version of &quot;Ms. Pac-Man&quot;, which was released in 1991, was still among the top 20 best-selling Genesis games. The same year, &quot;Next Generation&quot; ranked the arcade version as number 12 on their &quot;Top 100 Games of All Time&quot;, saying that it has aged far better than the original &quot;Pac-Man&quot; due to its smarter monster AI, varied mazes, moving fruits and intermissions. They added: &quot;It has the broadest appeal of any game &quot;Next Generation&quot; has seen, with the possible exception of &quot;Tetris&quot;. Women love it. Men Love it. Children love it.&quot; In 1997, &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; listed the Genesis and Super NES versions as number 89 on their &quot;100 Best Games of All Time&quot;, stating that the &quot;Two-player simultaneous play and new mazes completely revive this classic.&quot; In 1999, &quot;Next Generation&quot; listed &quot;Ms. Pac-Man&quot; as number 41 on their &quot;Top 50 Games of All Time&quot;, commenting: &quot;It sounds easier than it is, and it makes the game one we consistently go back to, week after week.&quot;

In 2009, &quot;Game Informer&quot; put &quot;Ms. Pac-Man&quot; tenth on their list of &quot;The Top 200 Games of All Time&quot;, saying that it &quot;trumped [the original &quot;Pac-Man&quot;] in nearly every way&quot;. This is down one rank from &quot;Game Informer&quot;″s previous best games of all-time list. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; called &quot;Ms. Pac-Man&quot; one of the top ten games for the Atari 2600 in 2013. In 2016, &quot;Ms. Pac-Man&quot; placed fifth on &quot;Time&quot;&#x27;s &quot;The 50 Best Video Games of All Time&quot; list. In 2022, The Strong National Museum of Play inducted &quot;Ms. Pac-Man&quot; to its World Video Game Hall of Fame.

<text>A dogfight, or dog fight, is an aerial battle between fighter aircraft that is conducted at close range. Modern terminology for air-to-air combat is air combat manoeuvring (ACM), which refers to tactical situations requiring the use of individual basic fighter maneuvers (BFM) to attack or evade one or more opponents. This differs from aerial warfare, which deals with the strategy involved in planning and executing various missions.

Dogfighting first occurred during the Mexican Revolution in 1913, shortly after the invention of the airplane. It was a component of every major war after that, though with steadily declining frequency, until the end of the Cold War in the early 1990s. Since then, longer-range weapons such as beyond-visual-range missiles have made dogfighting largely obsolete.
==Etymology==
The term &quot;dogfight&quot; has been used for centuries to describe a melee: a fierce, fast-paced battle at close quarters between two or more opponents. The term gained popularity during World War II, although its first use in reference to air combat can be traced to the latter years of World War I. One of the first written uses of the word in that sense was in an account of the death of Baron von Richthofen in &quot;The Graphic&quot; in May 1918: &quot;The Baron joined the mêlée, which, scattering into groups, developed into what our men call a dog fight&quot;. On March 21, 1918, several British newspapers published an article by Frederic Cutlack in which the word was used in the modern sense: &quot;A patrol of seven Australian machines on Saturday met about twenty of this [i.e., von Richthofen&#x27;s] circus at 12,000 feet. Ten of the enemy dived to attack our men. A regular dogfight ensued for half a minute.&quot;

==History==
===Mexican Revolution===
The first supposed instance of plane on plane combat and the first instance of one plane intercepting another during an aerial conflict apparently occurred during the Mexican Revolution on November 30, 1913, between two American mercenaries fighting for opposing sides, Dean Ivan Lamb and Phil Rader. The story comes from Lamb himself. According to his own statements in an interview two decades later, both men had orders to kill, but neither pilot wanted to harm the other, so they exchanged multiple volleys of pistol fire, intentionally missing before exhausting their supply of ammunition.

===World War I===

Dogfighting became widespread in World War I. Aircraft were initially used as mobile observation vehicles, and early pilots gave little thought to aerial combat. The new aeroplanes proved their worth by spotting the hidden German advance on Paris in the second month of the war.

Enemy pilots at first simply exchanged waves, or shook their fists at each other. Due to weight restrictions, only small weapons could be carried on board. Intrepid pilots decided to interfere with enemy reconnaissance by improvised means, including throwing bricks, grenades and sometimes rope, which they hoped would entangle the enemy plane&#x27;s propeller. Pilots soon began firing hand-held guns at enemy planes, such as pistols and carbines. The first aerial dogfight of the war occurred during the Battle of Cer (August 15–24, 1914), when the Serbian aviator Miodrag Tomić encountered an Austro-Hungarian plane while performing a reconnaissance mission over Austro-Hungarian positions. The Austro-Hungarian pilot initially waved, and Tomić reciprocated. The Austro-Hungarian pilot then fired at Tomić with his revolver. Tomić managed to escape, and within several weeks, all Serbian and Austro-Hungarian planes were fitted with machine-guns. In August 1914, Staff-Captain Pyotr Nesterov, from Russia, became the first pilot to ram his plane into an enemy spotter aircraft. In October 1914, an airplane was shot down by a handgun from another plane for the first time over Reims, France. Once machine guns were mounted on the airplane, either on a flexible mounting or on the top wing of early biplanes, the era of air combat began.

The biggest problem was mounting a machine gun onto an aircraft so that it could be fired forward, through the propeller, and aimed by pointing the nose of the aircraft directly at the enemy. French aviator Roland Garros solved this problem by mounting steel deflector wedges on the propeller of a Morane Saulnier monoplane. He achieved three kills, but was forced down due to engine failure down behind enemy lines and captured before he could burn his plane to prevent it falling into enemy hands. The wreckage was brought to Anthony Fokker, a Dutch designer who built aircraft for the Germans. Fokker decided that the wedges were much too risky, and improved the design by connecting the trigger of an MG 08 Maxim machine gun to the timing of the engine. The invention of this synchronization gear in 1915 transformed air combat and gave the Germans an early air superiority with the Fokker E.I, the first synchronized, forward-firing fighter plane. On the evening of July 1, 1915, the very first aerial engagement by a fighter plane armed with a synchronized, forward-firing machine gun occurred just to the east of Luneville, France. The German Fokker E.I was flown by Lieutenant Kurt Wintgens, who shot down a French two-seat observation monoplane. Later that same month, on July 25, 1915, British Royal Flying Corps (RFC) Major Lanoe Hawker, flying a very early production Bristol Scout C., attacked three separate aircraft during a single sortie, shooting down two with a non-synchronizable Lewis gun which was mounted next to his cockpit at an outwards angle to avoid hitting the propeller. He forced the third one down, and was awarded the Victoria Cross.

Battles in the air increased as the technological advantage swung from the British to the Germans, then back again. The &quot;Feldflieger-Abteilung&quot; or &quot;FFA&quot;, observation units of the German air service, consisted in 1914–15 of six two-seat observation aircraft each. Each unit was assigned to a particular German Army headquarters location, and had a single Fokker Eindecker aircraft assigned to each &quot;FFA&quot; unit for general defensive duties, so pilots such as Max Immelmann and Oswald Boelcke began as lone hunters with FFA units, shooting unarmed spotter planes and other enemy aircraft out of the sky. During the first part of the war, there was no tactical doctrine of air-to-air combat. Oswald Boelcke was the first to analyze the tactics of aerial warfare, resulting in a set of rules known as the Dicta Boelcke. Many of Boelcke&#x27;s concepts from 1916 are still applied today, including the use of sun and altitude, surprise attack, and turning to meet a threat.

Brigadier General Hugh Trenchard ordered that all British reconnaissance aircraft be supported by at least three fighters, creating the first tactical formations in the air. The Germans responded by forming &quot;Jagdstaffel&quot; or Jastas, large squadrons of fighters solely dedicated to destroying enemy aircraft, under the supervision of Boelcke. Pilots who shot down five or more fighters became known as aces. One of the most famous dogfights, resulting in the death of Major Hawker, is described by the &quot;Red Baron&quot;, Manfred von Richthofen:

I WAS extremely proud when, one fine day, I was informed that the airman whom I had brought down on the twenty- third of November, 1916, was the English [equivalent of] Immelmann... 

First we circled twenty times to the left, and then thirty times to the right. Each tried to get behind and above the other. Soon I discovered that I was not meeting a beginner. He had not the slightest intention of breaking off the fight. He was traveling in a machine which turned beautifully. However, my own was better at rising than his, and I succeeded at last in getting above and beyond my English waltzing partner.

... The impertinent fellow was full of cheek and when we had got down to about 3,000 feet he merrily waved to me as if he would say, &quot;Well, how do you do?&quot;

The circles which we made around one another were so narrow that their diameter was probably no more than 250 or 300 feet. I had time to take a good look at my opponent... 

When he had come down to about three hundred feet he tried to escape by flying in a zig-zag course during which, as is well known, it is difficult for an observer to shoot. That was my most favorable moment. I followed him at an altitude of from two hundred and fifty feet to one hundred and fifty feet, firing all the time. The Englishman could not help falling. But the jamming of my gun nearly robbed me of my success.

My opponent fell, shot through the head, one hundred and fifty feet behind our line.

Despite the Germans&#x27; early lead in combat tactics and their &#x27;Dicta Boelcke&#x27;, the Allies were quick to adapt and develop their own tactics. The Royal Flying Corps&#x27; Albert Ball was one of a band of pilots who liked to fly solo and he developed &#x27;stalking&#x27; tactics for going after enemy two-seaters. He even used his Lewis gun in its top-wing adjustable Foster mounting to fire upwards into the underside of unsuspecting enemy aircraft. Other RFC pilots such as James McCudden and Mick Mannock emphasised mutual support and the advantages of attacking from height. Mannock expressed this in a list of aerial combat rules that were similar to Boelcke&#x27;s.

During 1916, aerial reconnaissance patrols were usually unaccompanied as there had been few if any aerial disputes between the belligerents. However, just as the Sinai and Palestine Campaign ground war on the Gaza to Beersheba line came to resemble trench warfare on the western front, the air war over southern Palestine also came to resemble that being fought over France. After the Second Battle of Gaza in April 1917 and during the ensuing Stalemate in Southern Palestine, the concentration of Egyptian Expeditionary (EEF) and Ottoman Army forces holding established front lines grew, as associated supply dumps and lines of communications were developed. The need for information about these installations fuelled &quot;intense rivalry in the air&quot;. Aerial reconnaissance patrols were regularly attacked, so all photography and artillery observation patrols had to be accompanied by armed escort aircraft. These special EEF patrols grew into squadrons, attacking hostile aircraft wherever they were found, either in the air or on the ground. However, the technically superior German aircraft shot down numbers of EEF aircraft during dog fights.

By the end of the war, the underpowered machines from just ten years prior had been transformed into fairly powerful, swift, and heavily armed fighter planes, and the basic tactics of dogfighting had been established.

===Spanish Civil War===
Airplane technology rapidly increased in sophistication after World War I. By 1936, dogfighting was thought to be a thing of the past, since aircraft were reaching top speeds of over 250 miles per hour (400 km/h). The experiences of the Spanish Civil War proved this theory was wrong.

At the beginning of the war, new tactics were developed, most notably in the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; Condor Legion. Lieutenant Werner Mölders advised abandoning the standard &quot;V&quot; formation used in combat, and pairing fighters in twos, starting the practice of having a wingman at one&#x27;s side. He advised that pairs of aircraft approaching a fight should increase the distance between them instead of holding tight formations, a precursor to the combat spread maneuver. He also started the practice of training pilots to fly at night, and with instruments only. Using the new tactics, and flying the newest Bf 109 fighters, the Germans shot down 22 Spanish Republican fighters within a five-day period, suffering no losses of their own.

===World War II===
====Strategies for fighter development====
During the 1930s two different schools of thought about air-to-air combat began to emerge, resulting in two different trends of monoplane fighter development. In Japan and Italy especially, there continued to be a strong belief that lightly armed, highly maneuverable single seat fighters would still play a primary role in air-to-air combat. Aircraft such as the Nakajima Ki-27 and Nakajima Ki-43 and the Mitsubishi A6M Zero in Japan, and the Fiat G.50 and Macchi C.200 in Italy epitomised a generation of monoplanes designed to this concept.

The other stream of thought, which emerged primarily in Britain, Germany, the Soviet Union, and the United States was the belief the high speeds of modern combat aircraft and the g-forces imposed by aerial combat meant that dogfighting in the classic WWI sense would be impossible. Fighters such as the Messerschmitt Bf 109, the Supermarine Spitfire, the Yakovlev Yak-1, and the Curtiss P-40 were all designed for high speeds and a good rate of climb. Good maneuverability was not a primary objective.

Immediately following the Spanish Civil War came World War II, during which dogfighting was most prevalent. It was widely believed that strategic bombing alone was synonymous with air power; a fallacy that would not be fully understood until Vietnam. After the failings in Spain, a greater emphasis was placed on the accuracy of air-to-ground attacks. The need to stop bombers from reaching their targets, or to protect them on their missions, was the primary purpose for most dogfights of the era.

====Dogfighting over Europe====
Dogfighting was very prominent in the European theatre. While the French Air Force was a major force during World War I, it was inadequate and poorly organized, and quickly fell to the German onslaught. As the first battles between the Germans and the British began, the power of the German&#x27;s anti-aircraft artillery became readily apparent, with 88 millimeter shells capable of firing in the air. General Wolfram von Richthofen noted that these guns were equally destructive when used for ground fire. Adolph Malan compiled a list of aerial combat rules that were widely taught to RAF pilots. The Bf 109 and the Spitfire were some of the most common fighters used in the European theater.

A typical dogfight is described by an unnamed pilot:

Pulling up into his blind spot I watched his plane grow larger and larger in my sight. But this German pilot was not content to fly straight and level. Before I could open fire his plane slewed to the right, and seeing me on his tail, he jerked back on the stick into the only defensive maneuver his plane could make. I banked my 47 over to the right and pulled back on the stick, striving to get him once more into my ring sight. The violent maneuver applied terrific G&#x27;s to my body, and I started to black out as the blood rushed from my head. Fighting every second to overcome this blackness about me, I pulled back on the stick, further and further, so that the enemy would just show at the bottom of my ring sight to allow for the correct deflection.

We were both flying in a tight circle. &quot;Just a little more and I&#x27;ll have him.&quot; Pressing the [trigger] I waited expectantly for the 109 to explode. &quot;I&#x27;ve hit his wing.&quot; A section two-feet long broke loose from the right wing as the machine gun cut like a machete through it. &quot;Too low, a little more rudder and the bullets will find his cockpit.&quot; I could see occasional strikes further up the wing, but it was too late. The 109, sensing that I was inside him on the turn, slunk into a nearby cloud. Straightening my plane, I climbed over the top of the bank, and poised on the other side, waiting for him to appear. But the 109 did not appear, and not wishing to tempt the gods of fate further, I pushed my stick forward, entered the protective cover of the clouds, and headed home.

====Soviet fighters====
During this time, three new Russian fighters, the LaGG-1, the Yak-1, and the MiG-3 were just coming off of the production line. The Soviet Air Defense Force had been fraught with problems since World War I. The German Barbarossa offensive on June 22, 1941, destroyed more than 2000 Soviet aircraft on the first day, and more than 5000 before October. With great desperation, the Soviets fought in dogfights over Leningrad, Moscow, and Ukraine for more than a year.

Fireteam, a triple of aircraft (&quot;troika&quot;), has been the main tactical unit used in battles since the beginning of World War II. The analysis and synthesis of fighting experience resulted in a conclusion that group tactics should have been rejected and replaced by action pairs. However, ramming an opponent was still a common practice among the pilots of the Soviet Union. Another successful maneuver was a &quot;Sokolinnyi udar&quot; (falcon punch) when a pilot obtained a speed advantage by swooping down on an opponent, characteristically from the direction of the sun in order to hide their fighter within the glare of the brilliant light before and during the attack. This maneuver and many other tactical principles were introduced by Alexander Pokryshkin, one of the greatest tacticians of the Soviet Air Force who showed his worth during World War II. His famous motto sounded as &quot;Height, speed, maneuver, fire!&quot;. It became popular in the air armies and was adopted by pilots.

Struggling with morale problems, the Soviets slowly and methodically began to regain air supremacy after the Battle of Stalingrad in 1943. This theater is notable for including the only female fighter aces in history, Yekaterina Budanova and Lydia Litvyak.

====Second Sino-Japanese War====
The Second Sino-Japanese War began on July 7, 1937, between China and Japan. The Japanese used the Mitsubishi A5M; the predecessor of the famous &quot;Zero&quot;, which was a very lightweight and maneuverable fighter. The Chinese mainly used Russian biplanes similar to those from WWI, such as the Polikarpov I-15 and early monoplanes such as I-16. Despite being much lower in power and speed than the Japanese planes, the Chinese planes were much more maneuverable, and many dogfights ensued, resulting in high losses reported on both sides. Reports of dogfights that made it to the U.S. military provided valuable insight into the Japanese tactics and their plane&#x27;s flight characteristics.

====United States and Japan====
After the bombing of Pearl Harbor, the United States entered the war. The Japanese used, among other aircraft, the Mitsubishi A6M Zero, an extremely lightweight fighter known for its exceptional range and maneuverability. The U.S. military tested the Akutan Zero, a Mitsubishi A6M2 which was captured intact in 1942, advising – along the same lines that General Claire Chennault, commander of the Kunming-based Flying Tigers had already advised his pilots over a year before – &quot;Never attempt to dogfight a Zero.&quot; Even though its engine was rather low in power, the Zero had very low wing loading characteristics, a small turn radius, a top speed over , and could climb better than any fighter used by the U.S. at that time, although it was poorly armored compared to U.S. aircraft.

A pilot who realized that new tactics had to be devised was Lieutenant Commander John S. &quot;Jimmy&quot; Thach, commander of Fighting Three in San Diego. He read the early reports coming out of China and wrestled with the problem of his F4F Wildcats being relatively slower and much less maneuverable than the Japanese planes. Using matchsticks on his kitchen table, he devised a defensive maneuver he called &quot;beam defense position&quot;, but commonly called the &quot;Thach Weave&quot;. Thach reasoned that, because the Zero had fabric wing-covers that tended to &quot;balloon&quot; at speeds above 295 mph, which made the plane very hard to turn, he could use high speed and a formation of four planes, consisting of two pairs of aircraft, flying line-abreast (side by side at the same altitude). Keeping the leader of each pair in close formation with their wingman, the pairs could fly about apart (the turn radius of the Wildcat) and adopt a weaving formation when either or both pairs fell under attack by Japanese fighters, allowing each pair to evade the attack while at the same time covering the other pair. Thach made a diagram of the idea and showed it to other pilots, but in trial-runs people like Butch O&#x27;Hare found it difficult to make the shot while, at the same time, evading the two friendly planes coming at him head on.

Thach later faced the A6M Zero during the Battle of Midway, in June 1942, for the test of his theory. Although outnumbered, he found that a Zero would lock onto the tail of one of the fighters. In response, the two planes would turn toward each other, with one plane&#x27;s path crossing in front of the other. More importantly, the pursuer would have to follow that path to maintain pursuit, also crossing in front of the American plane&#x27;s sights. Thus, when the Zero followed its original target through the turn it would come into a position to be fired on by the target&#x27;s wingman, and the predator would become the prey. His tactic proved to be effective and was soon adopted by other squadrons. The Thach Weave helped make up for the inferiority of the US planes in maneuverability and numbers, until new aircraft could be brought into service. This tactic later morphed into the more fluid and versatile &quot;loose-deuce maneuvering&quot; that was to prove useful in the Vietnam war.

Another effective maneuver used by the U.S. pilots was a simple break, which consisted of turning sharply across an attacker&#x27;s flight path, which worked well in part because the large nose of the Zero tended to obstruct the pilot&#x27;s view. Still another good tactic was a high-side guns pass, which consisted of diving upon the Zero, shooting in one high-speed pass, and using the speed to climb back above the fight to dive again. By 1943 the U.S. began to produce planes that were better matched against the Japanese planes, such as the
Grumman F6F Hellcat, and the Vought F4U Corsair.

====Technology====
Technology advanced extremely fast during World War II in ways that would change dogfighting forever. Jet propulsion had been demonstrated long before the war, by German engineer Hans von Ohain in 1934, and by British engineer Frank Whittle in 1937. The Messerschmitt Me 262 was the first jet fighter to be used in battle, with a speed over , and began taking a toll on Allied bombing missions in 1944. The British were testing a jet that same year, the Gloster Meteor, which would later see action in the Korean War. Although U.S. General Hap Arnold test flew the XP-59A in 1942, the plane was never used in combat. Other prime inventions of the era include radar and air-to-air missiles.

====Propaganda====
Enemy pilots were construed as weak and evil. For example, in World War II, describing the Soviet tactics, the Luftwaffe claimed that, &quot;The characteristic feature of the average Soviet fighter pilot were a tendency toward caution and reluctance instead of toughness and stamina, brute strength instead of genuine combat efficiency, abysmal hatred instead of fairness and chivalry...&quot;

===Korean War===
After World War II, the question began to rise about the future usefulness of fighter aircraft. This was especially true for the U.S., where the focus was placed on small, fast, long-range bombers capable of delivering atomic bombs. The Korean War began in June 1950, and the North Koreans were outmatched by the U.S. Air Force. The war was nearly over by October, with the occupation of North Korea when, on November 1, Chinese MiG-15s attacked. The Chinese began supplying North Korea with troops and provisions, and the war quickly resumed.

At faster, the MiG-15 was more than a match for the U.S. P-80 Shooting Star, using the same dive and shoot tactic that the Americans found so useful against Japan. The U.S. jets had inferior weaponry, and suffered from problems with production and parts. The U.S. resorted to using mainly the more maneuverable propeller driven fighters during the war, such as the P-51 Mustang which was carried over from World War II.

To combat the MiGs, the F-86 Sabre was put into production. The U.S. pilots had a number of major advantages over the Chinese, including the G-suit. Chinese fighters were often seen spinning off out of control during a hard turn because the pilot had lost consciousness. Other technological advantages included the radar-ranging gunsight and hydraulic controls. Colonel Harrison R. Thyng remarked:

Suddenly you go into a steep turn. Your mach drops off. The MiG turns with you, and you let him gradually creep up and outturn you. At the critical moment you reverse your turn. The hydraulic controls [of the F-86] work beautifully. The MiG cannot turn as readily as you and is slung out to the side. When you pop your speedbrakes, the MiG flashes by you. Quickly closing the brakes, you slide onto his tail and hammer him with your &quot;50s&quot;.

The Chinese were very competent in a dogfight, and large swirling battles were fought in the skies over Korea. However, it was highly suspected by many U.S. pilots that some of the opponents they faced over Korea were in fact well-trained Soviet pilots, whom the Americans referred to as &quot;hanchos&quot;, (a Japanese word, meaning &quot;bosses&quot;). Major Robinson Risner recalls,

Seeing one another about the same time, the MiG flight and my flight dropped [our extra fuel] tanks.. He was so low he was throwing up small rocks. I dropped down to get him, but to hit him I had to get down in his jet wash. He&#x27;d chop the throttle and throw out his speed brakes. I would coast up beside him, wingtip to wingtip. When it looked like I was going to overshoot him, I would roll over the top and come down on the other side of him. When I did, he&#x27;d go into a hard turn, pulling all the Gs he could. This guy was one fantastic pilot.

The war in the air, however, eventually came to a stalemate as fighting ceased between the two factions. Later after the fall of the Soviet Union, Soviet records showed that Russian pilots
were indeed in the air. Sometimes in the fury of combat they reverted to the Russian language over the radio.

===Vietnam War===


The Vietnam War &quot;was the first &#x27;modern&#x27; air war&quot; in which air-to-air missiles were the primary weapons during aerial combat, and was the only confrontation between the latest aerial and ground defense technologies between the Soviet Union and the United States. If U.S. air power could successfully conduct war against Soviet doctrine and equipment in the skies over North Vietnam, then it could expect to successfully operate against the Soviet Union during a massive war in Europe. Over the skies of North Vietnam, U.S. aircraft would be attacking the &quot;most formidable and most heavily defended targets in the history of aerial warfare&quot;.

By this time, dogfighting techniques had fallen out of favor in U.S. training doctrines, as missiles were considered to be all that was necessary to shoot down the big bombers expected to be deployed by the Soviet Union. As a result, air combat methods known by fighter pilots since World War I became all but lost as veterans from WWII and Korea retired and didn&#x27;t pass them on to succeeding generations. American fighter pilots would meet in the skies in secret to engage in mock combat to try to maintain some level of proficiency. It wasn&#x27;t until TOPGUN was established for the Navy in 1969 and Red Flag was started for the Air Force in 1975 that pilots were formally trained in dogfighting again.

Both U.S. and Soviet-built jet &quot;fighters&quot; were primarily designed as interceptors: intercepting bomber groups, and then shooting them down with air-to-air missiles. Neither party had a separate designation for interceptor, though: just &quot;F&quot; for fighter; &quot;A&quot; for attack; and &quot;B&quot; for bomber (for the NATO aircraft). With possibly a few exceptions, such as the F-8 Crusader and the F-100 Super Sabre, which each mounted four 20 mm cannons, jets were not designed for dog fighting other jet aircraft. Soviet doctrine called for their interceptors to be strictly vectored towards their targets by &quot;Ground Control Intercept&quot; (GCI) operators. As a consequence, U.S. RF-101 Voodoo aircraft conducting reconnaissance missions, or F-102 Delta Daggers, F-104 Starfighters performing MiGCAP duties, and the strike aircraft themselves, such as F-105 Thunderchiefs, A-4 Skyhawks, A-6 Intruders, F-4 Phantoms and B-52&#x27;s flying over North Vietnam were met by MiG-17s (or Chicom J-5s), MiG-19s (Chicom J-6s), and MiG-21s being vectored directly to them by GCI operators who worked in conjunction with surface-to-air missile (SAM) crews. U.S. aircraft which successfully made it through the NVAF MiGs were then confronted with the SAMs and AAA batteries.

This triad defense system of GCI-controlled MiGs, Missiles (SAMs), and AAA enabled the North Vietnamese MiGs to utilize their aircraft&#x27;s design capabilities as their designers had intended, that of, in the vernacular of the time, making &quot;one pass, and then hauling ass&quot;, which was, in practice, quickly firing at their targets and then speeding away. By 1967 the Soviets had supplied the NVAF with enough missile-firing MiG-21s to allow the North Vietnamese to routinely engage U.S. aircraft, and to rely less and less on their aged MiG-17s, although many North Vietnamese pilots still preferred the MiG-17s agility and easy maintenance. With the arrival of the additional MiG-21s, and by 1969 MiG-19s (J-6s) imported from China, engagements between U.S. and NVAF jets became generally divided into two arenas; MiG-21s engaged at higher altitudes, while MiG-17s and MiG-19s would try to give battle at lower altitudes where their cannons were more effective.

At the conclusion of the air war in 1973, U.S. airmen had downed 202 communist MiGs, including two downed by B-52 tail gunners from their quad .50 caliber machine guns; this at a cost of 90 U.S. aircraft to NVAF MiGs. The USAF claimed 137 MiGs while the USN/USMC brought down 65 in air-to-air combat. From these figures, the USAF had 40 gun kills, and the USN claimed eight cannon victories. This number approached parity with the NVAF MiG&#x27;s 37 gun kill figures.

Approximately 612 radar-guided AIM-7 Sparrow missiles were fired during the war, scoring 56 MiG kills, while 454 heat-seeking AIM-9 Sidewinders were launched achieving 81 aerial victories. During Operation Rolling Thunder 54 AIM-4 Falcon missiles were fired, obtaining five kills. By contrast, NVAF MiG-21s obtained 53 air-to-air kills with their AA-2 &quot;Atoll&quot; missiles, from an unknown number of launchings. At least three MiG-21s, and all of the MiG-17s and MiG-19s (J-6s) made the remaining 37 kills, from their 90 total, with their 23 mm, 30 mm and 37 mm cannons.

As part of the North Vietnamese triad system of defense, surface-to-air missiles (SAMs) had become an ever-increasing threat. U.S Air Force Brigadier General Robin Olds describes a typical encounter with surface-to-air missiles, which during a period of time in Vietnam was referred to as either a &quot;MiG day&quot; or a &quot;Sam day&quot;, this was a Sam day.

Here come the SAMs. The trick is seeing the launch. You can see the steam. It goes straight up, turns more level, then the booster drops off. If it maintains a relatively stable position, it&#x27;s coming right for you and you&#x27;re in trouble. You&#x27;re eager to make a move but can&#x27;t. If you dodge too fast it will turn and catch you; if you wait too late it will explode near enough to get you. What you do at the right moment is poke your nose down, go down as hard as you can, pull maybe three negative Gs at 550 knots and once it follows you down, you go up as hard as you can. It can&#x27;t follow that and goes under.

This passage from a USAF booklet explained a MiG day:

If you know a MiG-21 is in your area or you lose sight of one and want to find it again: Roll out wings level for 15 seconds, then look in your 6 o&#x27;clock about 1.5 miles. It will be there. Probably you&#x27;ll see Mach 2 Atoll (air-to-air missile) smoke trail first before you see the MiG. But remember that&#x27;s where the MiG-21 is! Just ask one of the 20 aircrews shot down during Linebacker that never knew they were under attack.

===Arab–Israeli Wars===

Dogfighting occurred in every war between Israel and her Arab neighbors between 1948 and 1985, including the 1948 Palestine war, the Sinai War in 1956, the Six-Day War in 1967, the War of Attrition, the Yom Kippur War in 1973, and the 1982 Lebanon War.

Initially both sides relied on propeller planes, such as Spitfires, Avia S-199s, and P-51s, then progressed to older jets like MiG-15s, Dassault Mysteres and Dassault Mirages. In the latter wars dogfighting ensued between modern aircraft, like F-15s and F-16s against MiG-21s and MiG-25s. Although often outnumbered, the IAF was dominant in every conflict and in 1967 defeated the combined air forces of Egypt, Jordan and Syria. In dogfights the IAF often achieved kill ratios ranging from 10:1 to over 20:1, which is usually attributed to the superior training of Israeli pilots rather than technological advantage.

===Indo-Pakistani War of 1965===

The Indo-Pakistani War of 1965 saw the Indian and Pakistani Air Forces engaged in large-scale aerial combat against each other for the first time since the independence of Pakistan in 1947. The war took place during the course of September 1965 and saw both air forces conduct defensive and offensive operations over Indian and Pakistani airspace. The aerial war saw both sides conducting thousands of sorties in a single month. Both sides claimed victory in the air war; India claimed to have destroyed 73 enemy aircraft and lost 35 of its own while Pakistan claimed to have destroyed 104 aircraft against its own losses of 19. Despite the intense fighting, India was able to shoot down around 18 PAF jets while losing 14 jets. Neutral sources mention India losing 75 and Pakistan lost 20 jets. In the first stage of War, 4 Indian Vampire Fighters were shot down by PAF F-86s on 1 September, while from Indian side, Indian Sqn. Ldr. Trevor Keeler with his Gnat took the first hit on 3 September 1965 by downing a Pakistani F-86 which got crashed in an uncontrollable dive. IAF Flt. Lt.V S Pathania took the first kill by his Gnat on 4 September 1965 by downing the Pakistani F-86 of Flt. Lt Bhatt who escaped to safe territory by parachute. PAF Sqn. Ldr. Muhammad Mahmood Alam, became highest flying ace by 5 confirmed and 4 probable kills. PAF Sqn. Ldr. Sarfraz Rafiqui who shot down 3 and Flt. Lt. Yunus were shot down in Halwara, Indian air base by fresh pilots with IAF Hawker Hunter Mk. 56. One Indian Gnat landed in Pakistan airbase accidentally due low on fuel and disoriented, now exhibited as war trophy in Pakistan Air Force Museum. After the war, PAF&#x27;s loss rate was 17 percent of its front line strength, while India&#x27;s losses amounted to less than 10 per cent.

===Indo-Pakistani War of 1971===
By late 1971, the intensification of the independence movement in erstwhile East Pakistan led to the Bangladesh Liberation War between India and Pakistan. On November 22, 1971, 10 days before the start of a full-scale war, four PAF F-86 Sabre jets attacked Indian and Mukti Bahini positions at Garibpur, near the international border. Two of the four PAF Sabres were shot down and one damaged by the IAF&#x27;s Folland Gnats. On December 3, India formally declared war against Pakistan following massive preemptive strikes by the PAF against Indian Air Force installations in Srinagar, Ambala, Sirsa, Halwara and Jodhpur. However, the IAF did not suffer significantly because the leadership had anticipated such a move and precautions were taken. The Indian Air Force was quick to respond to Pakistani air strikes, following which the PAF carried out mostly defensive sorties.

Within the first two weeks, the IAF had carried out almost 12,000 sorties over East Pakistan and also provided close air support to the advancing Indian Army. The IAF also assisted the Indian Navy in its operations against the Pakistani Navy in the Bay of Bengal and Arabian Sea. On the western front, the IAF destroyed more than 20 Pakistani tanks, four APCs and a supply train during the Battle of Longewala. The IAF undertook strategic bombing of West Pakistan by carrying out raids on oil installations in Karachi, the Mangla Dam and a gas plant in Sindh. A similar strategy was also deployed in East Pakistan, and, as the IAF achieved complete air superiority on the eastern front, the ordnance factories, runways, and other vital areas of East Pakistan were severely damaged. By the time the Pakistani forces surrendered, the IAF had destroyed 94 PAF aircraft. The IAF was able to conduct a wide range of missions – troop support; air combat; deep penetration strikes; para-dropping behind enemy lines; feints to draw enemy fighters away from the actual target; bombing; and reconnaissance. In contrast, the Pakistan Air Force, which was solely focused on air combat, was blown out of the subcontinent&#x27;s skies within the first week of the war. Those PAF aircraft that survived took refuge at Iranian air bases or in concrete bunkers, refusing to offer a fight. Hostilities officially ended at 14:30 GMT on December 17, after the fall of Dacca on December 15. India claimed large gains of territory in West Pakistan (although pre-war boundaries were recognised after the war), and the independence of Pakistan&#x27;s East wing as Bangladesh was confirmed. The IAF had flown over 16,000 sorties on both East and West fronts; including sorties by transport aircraft and helicopters. while the PAF flew about 30 and 2,840. More than 80 percent of the IAF&#x27;s sorties were close-support and interdiction, and according to neutral assessments about 45 IAF aircraft were lost while, Pakistan lost 75 aircraft. Not including any F-6s, Mirage IIIs, or the six Jordanian F-104s which failed to return to their donors. But the imbalance in air losses was explained by the IAF&#x27;s considerably higher sortie rate, and its emphasis on ground-attack missions. On the ground Pakistan suffered most, with 9,000 killed and 25,000 wounded while India lost 3,000 dead and 12,000 wounded. The loss of armoured vehicles was similarly imbalanced. This represented a major defeat for Pakistan. Towards the end of the war, IAF&#x27;s transport planes dropped leaflets over Dhaka urging the Pakistani forces to surrender, demoralising Pakistani troops in East Pakistan.

===Gulf of Sidra Incidents===

On August 19, 1981, two Grumman F-14 Tomcats of the VF-41 Black Aces engaged two Libyan Air Force Sukhoi Su-22 Fitter&#x27;s over the Gulf of Sidra. One Su-22 opened fire on the F-14 but missed. The F-14s destroyed the Su-22 Fitters using AIM-9 Sidewinder missiles; both pilots of the destroyed Su-22 planes ejected.

Eight years later, on January 4, 1989, a similar engagement occurred between two F-14s of the VF-32 Fighting Swordsmen and MiG-23 Floggers. The F-14s downed the MiGs with AIM-7 Sparrow and AIM-9 Sidewinder missiles after the MiGs made aggressive maneuvers against the F-14s.

===Falklands War===
The Falklands War began on April 2, 1982, when Argentina invaded the Falkland Islands, and then the island of South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands, which were small disputed dependencies. Because Britain had no military bases nearby and few aircraft carriers, the Argentinians did not expect a response from Britain. On April 5, the British sent carriers to the Falklands with Sea Harrier &#x27;Jump-jets&#x27; on board. The Harrier was originally designed as a ground-attack plane, and was not equipped for dogfighting, so the aircraft had to undergo many modifications and the pilots given extra training.

The Argentinians had superior numbers, but their forces mainly consisted of older jets from the 1960s, such as Dassault Mirage IIIs and Israeli Daggers. The Argentinians were also handicapped by the long distance from mainland airfields and a lack of refueling tankers. Neither side was ready for war, but both prepared all through April as diplomacy failed. The fighting started on May 1, and was to become the largest naval and air conflict since World War II. By the end of the war, Argentina lost 20 fighters in dogfights, while Britain lost two Sea Harrier to ground fire. The Americans supplied late model Sidewinder missiles to the British; this and the analysis of French Mirage combat tactics made the difference. As of March 2019 David Morgan was the last British pilot to have fought a dogfight when he downed two Argentinian jets on June 8, 1982.

===Iran–Iraq War and helicopter dogfight===
In the Iran–Iraq War of 1980–1988, many dogfights occurred between the Iranian Air Force (IRIAF) and Iraqi Air Force. During the early years of the war, the IRIAF enjoyed air superiority (see for example Operation Sultan 10 and Operation Morvarid); however, by the end of the war and partly due to embargoes, the Iranian Air Force had lost its superiority due to their increasingly outdated equipment and the lack of spare parts for their US-made aircraft. Iraq, meanwhile, continued to introduce new French and Soviet weapons into its air force.

The Iran–Iraq War also saw the worlds only confirmed helicopter dogfights, with Iranian Army Aviation&#x27;s AH-1J Internationals (usually the TOW-capable ones) entering combat mostly against Iraqi Army Air Corps&#x27; Mil Mi-24 Hind gunships and HOT-armed Aérospatiale Gazelles. The Hinds proved faster and more robust, while the AH-1Js were more agile. The results of the skirmishes are disputed. There were also engagements between Iranian AH-1Js and Iraqi fixed-wing aircraft: using their 20 mm cannon, the AH-1Js scored three confirmed kills against MiG-21s, claimed an Su-20, and shared in the destruction of a MiG-23.

===Persian Gulf War===
In the Gulf War of 1990–91, dogfighting once again proved its usefulness when the Coalition Air Force had to face off against the Iraqi Air Force, which at the time was the fifth largest in the world. By the second day of the war, the Coalition achieved air superiority. Many dogfights occurred during the short conflict, often involving many planes. By the end of January, 1991, the term &quot;furball&quot; became a popular word to describe the hectic situation of many dogfights, occurring at the same time within the same relatively small airspace. By the end of the war, the U.S. claimed 39 Iraqi aircraft in air-to-air victories to the loss of only one F/A-18. Of the 39 victories, 36 were taken by F-15 Eagles.

===Balkans conflict===
During the Balkans conflict, in 1999 (the Kosovo War), six MiG-29s of the Yugoslav Air Force were shot down in dogfights with NATO aircraft. The first was on March 24, by a Dutch F-16AM Falcon, and two were downed on the same night by U.S. F-15s. Two days later, two more MiG-29s were shot down by an F-15. The last MiG was shot down on May 4 by a U.S. F-16.

===Eritrean–Ethiopian War (1998–2000)===
The war became the first to see 4th-generation jet fighters battle with each other. Most of the losses to Eritrean MiG-29s were caused by dogfights with Ethiopian Su-27s.

=== 2019 Indo-Pakistan aerial skirmish ===
A dogfight between Indian and Pakistani jets took place on 27 February 2019, when Pakistani Dassault Mirage Vs, Dassault Mirage IIIs and JF-17 Thunders performed airstrikes near Indian military installations at Indian Administered Kashmir in retaliation to the Balakot Airstrike, which was carried out by the IAF on 26 February 2019.

In the ensuing dogfight, an Indian MiG-21 Bison and an Su-30MKI were shot down by Pakistani F-16s after they entered Pakistani airspace across the Line of Control. However, India later on reportedly flew the same Su-30MKI on its Air Force Day in October 2019.

<text>Franka Potente (; born 22 July 1974) is a German actress. She first appeared in the comedy film &quot;After Five in the Forest Primeval&quot; (1995), for which she won a Bavarian Film Award for Best Young Actress. Her breakthrough came in 1998, when she starred in the acclaimed action thriller &quot;Run Lola Run&quot;, for which she won a BAMBI Award for Best Actress. She received further critical acclaim and a Bavarian Television Award nomination for her performance in the television film &quot;Opernball&quot; (also 1998).

After half a decade of well-received roles in German productions, Potente made the transition into Hollywood with her role in the biographical crime film &quot;Blow&quot; (2001), and achieved wider recognition for her appearances in &quot;The Bourne Identity&quot; (2002) and &quot;The Bourne Supremacy&quot; (2004). She portrayed communist revolutionary Tamara Bunke in &quot;Che&quot; (2008), and psychologist Anita Gregory in &quot;The Conjuring 2&quot; (2016). Her other notable films include &quot;Anatomy&quot; (2000), &quot;The Princess and the Warrior&quot; (2000), &quot;Creep&quot; (2004), &quot;Romulus, My Father&quot; (2007), &quot;Eichmann&quot; (2007), and &quot;Muse&quot; (2017).

Potente has starred in the television series &quot;Copper&quot; (2012–2013), &quot;Taboo&quot; (2017), &quot;Claws&quot;, &quot;Titans&quot; and &quot;Echo 3&quot;. She played recurring roles in the second seasons of &quot;American Horror Story&quot; (2012) and &quot;The Bridge&quot; (2014).

==Early life==
The elder of two children, Potente was born in Münster, West Germany, and raised in nearby Dülmen. Her mother, Hildegard, is a medical assistant, and her father, Dieter Potente, is a teacher. Her Italian surname stems from her great-grandfather, a slater from Sicily who migrated to Germany during the 19th century. When she was 17 years old, Potente spent a few months as an exchange student in Humble, a suburb of Houston, Texas.

==Career==
===1990s===
After finishing high school in Germany, Potente enrolled at the Otto Falckenberg School of Performing Arts in Munich. Potente took acting jobs outside school time and appeared in her first movie in the 1995 student film &quot;Aufbruch&quot; (Departure). She was then spotted by a casting agent and appeared in the film &quot;Nach Fünf im Urwald&quot; (&quot;After Five in the Forest Primeval&quot;), directed by her then-boyfriend, Hans Christian Schmid. She played the role of a 17-year-old girl named Anna who, in search of freedom in an urban environment, runs away from home with a boy who has a crush on her. The film premiered at the 1995 Hof International Film Festival and opened in German theaters on 25 April 1996. She received the 1996 Bavarian Film Award for Young Talent for her work in this film. She subsequently finished her last year of training at the Lee Strasberg Theatre Institute in Manhattan.

Potente returned to Europe and worked in German and French films; her breakthrough came with 1998&#x27;s &quot;Lola rennt&quot; (&quot;Run Lola Run&quot;) after meeting the director, Tom Tykwer, in a café. Specifically written for her persona, her role was that of a woman who needs to obtain 100,000 Deutsche Mark in twenty minutes to save her boyfriend&#x27;s life. Budgeted at US$1 million, the arthouse thriller was a critical and commercial success, grossing US$14.5 million worldwide. &quot;Variety&quot; wrote that her performance was &quot;heroic, fierce, frightened and vulnerable all at once&quot;, while &quot;eFilmCritic.com&quot; called her casting a &quot;smart choice&quot;. Following her newfound success, she starred opposite Teemu Aromaa in &quot;Downhill City&quot; (1999), a small-scale drama directed by Finnish director Hannu Salonen, and in the romantic comedy &quot;Bin ich schön?&quot;, about people having trouble with love and identity, which was released on 17 September 1999 in Germany.

===2000s===

In the German-language horror film &quot;Anatomy&quot; (2000), she starred as a medical student who wins a place at an exclusive Heidelberg medical school, where she uncovers a gruesome conspiracy by a secret Anti-Hippocratic society. The film was a box office success in Germany, grossing US$10.5 million domestically, and &quot;Variety&quot;, in its review for the film, remarked: &quot;Boasting a gutsy performance from sturdy young German star Franka Potente (&quot;Run Lola Run&quot;), &quot;Anatomy&quot; is creepy, sometimes gruesome, widescreen fun that pushes all the right buttons. Out-performing &quot;Scream&quot; at the local [box office] and the biggest German pic of the year so far, this is natural latenight/fantasy fest fare that could become a cult item on half-inch and possibly even theatrically&quot;. Also in 2000, she had the starring role in the romantic drama &quot;The Princess and the Warrior&quot;, directed by Tykwer, her &quot;Run Lola Run&quot; director. In the film, she portrayed a psychiatric hospital nurse who, after a near-death experience, enters into a relationship with an anguished former soldier (Benno Fürmann, also her co-star in &quot;Anatomy&quot;) who lapses into criminality. The independent film was favorably received by critics; &quot;eFilmCritic&quot; stated that Potente &quot;proves her versatility as an actress here with a much more subdued character, but is still capable of delivering powerhouse emotional scenes&quot;, while the consensus of review-aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes was: &quot;More slow-moving than &quot;Run Lola Run&quot;, this film nonetheless offers an intriguing storyline about love and fate&quot;. She received nominations for the European Film Award and the German Film Award for Best Actress.

Potente&#x27;s first English-language role was that of a flight attendant who becomes engaged to cocaine smuggler George Jung in the biographical crime film &quot;Blow&quot;, alongside Johnny Depp. The film received mixed reviews, while it grossed US$83.2 million worldwide. She played a film editor in the controversial independent drama &quot;Storytelling&quot; (2001), with Leo Fitzpatrick and Selma Blair. It premiered at the 2001 Cannes Film Festival, and received a limited release in most international markets. Potente next found a much wider recognition from audiences for her performance in &quot;The Bourne Identity&quot; (2002), co-starring Matt Damon. In the film, she played a European woman who grows closer to the title character, a man suffering from extreme memory loss and attempting to discover his true identity amidst a clandestine conspiracy within the Central Intelligence Agency. A positive critical reception greeted the film upon its release, and budgeted at US$60 million, it grossed US$214 million globally. After her role in the film, she starred in the American films &quot;All I Want&quot; (2002) and &quot;I Love Your Work&quot; (2003), and in the German production &quot;Blueprint&quot; (2003).

She reprised past roles with the German horror sequel &quot;Anatomy 2&quot; (2003) and &quot;The Bourne Supremacy&quot; (2004), the latter which grossed US$288.5 million worldwide. In 2004, she starred in the British-German horror film &quot;Creep&quot;, as a woman locked in the London Underground overnight who finds herself being stalked by a hideously deformed killer living in the sewers below. Despite mixed reviews, the film grossed US$3.2 million in UK cinemas. &quot;ViewLondon&quot; wrote: &quot;The performances are good, particularly Potente, who avoids scream queen clichés by making her character surprisingly unlikeable – Kate is rude and arrogant in her early scenes and the fact that she&#x27;s German is, of course, a coincidence.&quot;

In 2006, Potente appeared in the German coming-of-age drama &quot;Elementarteilchen&quot; (&quot;Atomised&quot;), based on the novel &quot;Les Particules élémentaires&quot; by Michel Houellebecq and directed by Oskar Roehler. She wrote and directed &quot;Der die Tollkirsche ausgräbt&quot;, a silent also released in 2006. She next starred with Eric Bana and Kodi Smit-McPhee in the Australian drama film &quot;Romulus, My Father&quot; (2007), about the struggle of a couple to raise their son amid great adversity. For her portrayal, she was nominated for an Australian Film Industry Award for Best Lead Actress. Starting in May 2007, Potente had a three-episode recurring arc in the FX drama &quot;The Shield&quot;, where she played Diro Kesakhian, &quot;the ruthless godmother of L.A.&#x27;s Armenian mafia&quot;. Also in 2007, she appeared in &quot;Eichmann&quot; (2007), a biographical film detailing the interrogation of Adolf Eichmann.

In &quot;Che&quot; (2008), a two-part biopic about Argentine Marxist revolutionary Ernesto &quot;Che&quot; Guevara, Potente took on the role of communist revolutionary Tamara Bunke. She described the film as &quot;really epic and [...] very emotional&quot;, during an interview with &quot;Vulture&quot; magazine. The film, first screened at the Cannes Film Festival, garnered a positive critical response while it made US$40.9 million worldwide. &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, pointing out Potente, remarked that &quot;[m]ajor figures come and go, diverting the plot without registering much of an impact&quot;, and &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; described her part as a &quot;small role&quot; and felt that the actress &quot;seems utterly uncomfortable in every scene&quot;. In 2009, she appeared in the &quot;House&quot; television series two-part episode &quot;Broken&quot;.

===2010s===
Potente filmed the American neo-noir film &quot;Shanghai&quot; in Bangkok, Thailand, with production wrapping in August 2008. The film, set in the 1940s Chinese spy world, was released on 9 June 2010 in China, and on 2 October 2015 in North America. In 2011, she played the leading role of a passenger in the drama &quot;The Sinking of the Laconia&quot;, about the Laconia incident. The two-part television film first aired in January 2011 on BBC Two.

Potente starred in BBC America&#x27;s first original scripted series, &quot;Copper&quot;, as Eva Heissen, a shrewd German-American businesswoman and the madam of a brothel in the Five Points district of New York City during the American Civil War. The show premiered on 9 August 2012 and had the largest debut in the network&#x27;s history. It was subsequently renewed for a second season, but the BBC announced its cancellation following its finale. Potente subsequently had a two-episode appearance in &quot;American Horror Story: Asylum&quot;, as a woman who claims to be Holocaust victim and diarist Anne Frank.

In 2014, Potente landed a role on the second season of the FX series &quot;The Bridge&quot; as Eleanor Nacht, a &quot;fixer&quot; for the cartel. She returned to the big screen in the horror sequel &quot;The Conjuring 2&quot; as real-life German-British parapsychologist Anita Gregory, who investigated the Enfield Poltergeist case in the late 20th century. &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; found her to be &quot;curiously sidelined for much of the action&quot;, but with a worldwide gross of US$320.3 million, it emerged as Potente&#x27;s most widely seen film. Also in 2016, she obtained the two-episode role of a &quot;calculated and determined&quot; Chief Inspector in the second season of the Canadian supernatural series &quot;Dark Matter&quot;, and in 2017, she was cast in a supporting role in the BBC period drama series &quot;Taboo&quot;, alongside Tom Hardy.

===2020s===
In 2020, she made her first feature film &quot;Home&quot;, for which she was also responsible for the screenplay. The film premiered in October 2020.

In 2022, Potente appeared in season four of &quot;Titans&quot; where she portrayed Mother Mayhem.

===Authored works===
Based on Potente&#x27;s correspondence with colleague Max Urlacher during his time in Los Angeles, a book entitled &quot;Los Angeles – Berlin&quot; was published in September 2005. In May 2009, Potente published her second book &quot;Kick Ass – An Alternative Workout&quot;, co-written with her personal trainer Karsten Schellenberg. In August 2010 her first volume of stories &quot;Zehn&quot; was published.

==Personal life==
After relationships with German film director Tom Tykwer and American actor Elijah Wood, among others, Potente married American actor Derek Richardson in mid 2012, in a private ceremony. The couple lives in Los Angeles, and has two daughters, born in 2011 and 2013.

<text>Mise Éire (, Irish for &quot;I [am] Ireland&quot;) is a 1912 Irish-language poem by the Irish poet and Republican revolutionary leader Patrick Pearse.

== Background ==
&quot;Mise Éire is&quot; a 1912 Irish-language poem by the Irish poet and Republican revolutionary leader Patrick Pearse.

== Political relevance ==
In the poem, Pearse personifies Ireland as an old woman whose glory is past and who has been sold by her children.

=== Later use ===

Described as both a literary and historical text, it was regularly used by Republican prisoners in Long Kesh as a means of learning and teaching Irish. &quot;Is Mise&quot; continues to be relevant in post-partition Ireland, suggest scholars, as illustrating of the difficulties in identifying &quot;Irishness&quot; in Northern Ireland.

===Counter view===
The title of the poem was used as a title for a 1959 documentary film by George Morrison, which dealt with key figures and events in Irish Nationalism between the 1890s and the 1910s, including Pearse himself. Seán Ó Riada wrote a soundtrack for the film, also titled &#x27;Mise Éire&#x27;.

A poem of the same name by Eavan Boland was written as a counter to Pearse&#x27;s poem, and its treatment of Ireland and her children. Pearse had already written optimistically on the fate of Ireland&#x27;s strong sons&#x27; martyrdom in his poem &quot;The Mother&quot;; &quot;Is Mise&quot; takes the opposite, more pessimistic view of the sacrifice. In the words of Boss, Nordin and Orlinder, Boland &quot;opposes and corrects Pearse&#x27;s view on Ireland...No longer, as in the earlier poem, is the personification of the country &#x27;older than the Old Woman of Beare&#x27; but &#x27;a sloven’s mix&#x27;. The glory of having born &#x27;Cuchulain 
the valiant’ is turned into the picture of the woman ‘holding her half-dead baby to her&#x27;.

==Cultural usage==

In 2016, the poem was set to music composed by Patrick Cassidy and performed by the RTÉ Concert Orchestra for the score of the PBS documentary series 1916: An Irish Rebellion, curated by the Keough-Naughton Institute for Irish Studies at the University of Notre Dame. It was also performed by Sibéal Ní Chasaide at the Centenary concert commemorating the 1916 Rising.

<text>The A6144(M) was a motorway in Carrington, Greater Manchester, England. It was known in official documentation as the &quot;Carrington Spur Road&quot; and built to facilitate the transport of hazardous goods from Shell Chemicals&#x27; ethylene oxide plant in Carrington and other industrial estates in Carrington and Broadheath. It was extremely unusual in that it was entirely single carriageway, the only motorway of its kind in the UK as others were dual carriageway for at least some of their length.

About 1 mile (2 km) long, the road connected the A6144 road to the M60 at junction 8. It was the highest numbered A-road(M) motorway and one of only three four-digit, Axxxx(M) motorways, the others being the A6127(M) (now A167(M)) and the temporary A1077(M). The motorway was not a trunk road and not the responsibility of the Highways Agency.

The road had no hard shoulder but two emergency lay-bys with SOS phones and lights were provided midway along its length. A reason for its motorway status was that the junction with the M60 had two small roundabouts that were difficult for a driver of a long vehicle prohibited from motorways to perform a U-turn because of their size.

The unusual status of the A6144(M) led to it gaining a number of fans, particularly within organisations such as the Society for All British And Irish Road Enthusiasts (SABRE).

==Revocation of special road status==

In 2004, work to widen the M60 motorway altered the junction with the A6144(M), which was changed into a single roundabout allowing all motorway-prohibited traffic to turn and not join the M60.

Trafford Borough Council confirmed its intention to remove special road status from the A6144(M) when the M60 widening works were completed.

The A6144(M) ceased to be a special road on 25 May 2006, losing its motorway status. It is now subject to a 50 mph (80 km/h) speed limit and is classified as the A6144. The road through Sale retained the A6144 number, meaning that there are two branches (and two junctions with the M60 motorway) with the same road number. Despite losing motorway status, pedestrians, cyclists, and horse riders are still prohibited on the road.

==Preservation==
Following the change of signage on 25 May 2006, two marker posts, the A6144(M) confirmation sign and a lay-by warning sign are privately preserved.

<text>Ginette Harrison (28 February 1958 – 24 October 1999) was a professional climber of British origin. She also lived in Australia and the United States.

She studied medicine at the University of Bristol and later specialized in high altitude medicine. At age 25 she climbed Denali, the highest mountain in North America. It was the first of her series of climbs of the highest peaks on all seven continents, which included Mount Everest on 7 October 1993, making her only the second British woman to climb Everest, after Rebecca Stephens.

On 1 December 1995, she became the third woman, and the first British woman, to climb the Seven Summits inclusive of Mount Kosciuszko, the highest mountain in mainland Australia. On the same date, she also became the fifth woman, and the second British woman (behind Rebecca Stephens), to climb all seven continental summits inclusive of Carstensz Pyramid in Australasia.

On 18 May 1998, she climbed Kangchenjunga by its north face, making her the first woman to have reached the summit of the world&#x27;s third highest mountain. Her obituary in The Guardian quotes her as &quot;She watched in sorrow as other climbers she knew were lost – Alison Hargreaves, Chantal Mauduit – and wrote of her historic ascent: &quot;Over the years four women had died while attempting to climb Kangchenjunga and it made me appreciate all the more how lucky I was to make the first female ascent and return safely.&quot;

She later became the first British woman to summit Makalu on 22 May 1999.

==Personal life==
She was married to Gary Pfisterer, whom she met on her expedition to Mount Everest.

==Death==
She died under an avalanche when climbing Dhaulagiri, the seventh highest mountain in the world.

==Legacy==
A memorial lecture is held in Harrison&#x27;s memory each year, part of the Wilderness Lectures series. The event raises money for the Shiva Charity, which she supported, and which sponsors a school in Nepal, named in her honour.

<text>The flag of Nicaragua was first adopted on September 4, 1908, but not made official until August 27, 1971. It is based on, and inspired by, the flag of the Federal Republic of Central America and flag of Argentina.

==Overview==
The two Azure bands on the flag and the arms of Nicaragua in use today is derived from that of the United Provinces of Central America. The triangle, volcanoes, rising sun, Cap of Liberty, and rainbow all appeared on the original emblem. The coat of arms used today contains the name of the state, Republica de Nicaragua, whereas in 1823 the title was Provincias Unidas del Centro de America. The decision to revert to the emblems used by the United Provinces of Central America was taken in 1908 and reflected Nicaragua&#x27;s aspirations for the rebirth of the political entity formed by the 5 nations. Except for the text around the arms, the flag is very similar to that of the United Provinces of Central America. The 5 volcanoes represent the original 5 member states, the Cap of Liberty represents national freedom, and the rays of the sun and the rainbow are symbolic of the bright future to come.

The presence of a rainbow in the coat of arms makes the flag of Nicaragua one of only a handful flags of a sovereign state to include the color purple.

On 30 January 2025, the National Assembly officially amended the Constitution of Nicaragua to include the flag of the Sandinista National Liberation Front as one of the country&#x27;s national symbols.

<text>The flag of Niger () has been the national flag of the Republic of the Niger since 1959, a year prior to its formal independence from French West Africa. It uses the national colors of orange, white and green, in equal horizontal bands, with an orange circle in the center. The flag forms one of the official national symbols of the Republic of the Niger, along with the coat of arms, the National Anthem (&quot;The Honor of the Fatherland&quot;), and the national motto: &quot;Fraternité, Travail, Progrès&quot;.

== Legal definition ==
Prior to the independence of Niger from French West Africa, the flag of Niger was adopted by the Territorial Assembly of the Niger Colony on 23 November 1959, shortly before the proclamation of the Republic within the French Community on 18 December 1959. The flag was designed in 1958. It was retained upon independence in 1960 and has remained unchanged through to the 2010 Constitution.

==Symbolism==
A number of sources have described the symbolic intent of the flag, although official sources have yet to confirm. Common interpretations are that the upper orange band represents the northern regions of the Sahara Desert, or the Sahel, the center white band represents purity, or the Niger River, and the lower green band represents both hope and the fertile regions of southern Niger, the orange disc in the center band is thought to stand for the sun or independence.

== Ratio ==
The flag&#x27;s traditional portrayal with an unusual 6:7 ratio is of unknown significance and is not used consistently in print applications of the Nigerien government. The ratio is not explicitly specified in the Constitution of Niger.

<doc id="459275" wikidata="Q400256" url="?curid=459275" title="State highways in California">
<text>The state highway system of the U.S. state of California is a network of highways that are owned and maintained by the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans).

Each highway is assigned a &quot;Route&quot; (officially &quot;State Highway Route&quot;) number in the . Most of these are numbered in a statewide system, and are known as &quot;State Route X&quot; (abbreviated &quot;SR X&quot;). United States Numbered Highways are labeled &quot;US X&quot;, and Interstate Highways are &quot;Interstate X&quot;. Under the code, the state assigns a unique &quot;Route X&quot; to each highway, and does not differentiate between state, US, or Interstate highways.

The California Highway Patrol (CHP) is tasked with patrolling all state highways to enforce traffic laws.

==Overview==

California&#x27;s highway system is governed pursuant to Division 1 of the California Streets and Highways Code, which is one of the 29 California Codes enacted by the state legislature. Since July 1 of 1964, the majority of &quot;legislative route numbers&quot;, those defined in the Streets and Highways Code, match the &quot;sign route numbers&quot;. For example, Interstate 5 is listed as &quot;Route 5&quot; in the code.

On the other hand, some short routes are instead signed as parts of other routes – for instance, Route 112 and Route 260 are signed as part of the longer State Route 61, and Route 51 is part of Interstate 80 Business.

Concurrences are not explicitly codified in the Streets and Highways Code; such highway segments are listed on only one of the corresponding legislative route numbers – for example, the I-80/I-580 concurrency, known as the Eastshore Freeway, only falls under the Route 80 description in the highway code while the definition of Route 580 is broken into non-contiguous segments.

The state may &quot;relinquish&quot; segments of highways and turn them over to local control. If the relinquished segment is in the middle of the highway&#x27;s route, the local jurisdiction is usually required to install and maintain signs directing drivers to the continuation of that highway; they are not generally required to do so if the relinquishment effectively truncates the highway at one end, or is done as part of the process to re-route a highway. The state may also &quot;delete&quot; a highway completely and turn over an entire state route to local control.

Business routes are not maintained by the state unless they are also assigned legislative route numbers. A route or sections of a route may also be considered &quot;unrelinquished&quot; – a new alignment has been built, or the legislative definition has changed to omit the section, but the state still owns the roadway – and are officially &quot;Route XU&quot;. For example, State Route 14U is an old alignment of State Route 14 whose control has not yet been transferred to the City of Santa Clarita.

Some new alignments are considered &quot;supplemental&quot; and have a suffix of S. For example, an expressway replacement for State Route 86 between approximately three miles north of the Imperial/Riverside County line and Interstate 10 east of Indio was initially signed as State Route 86S until it was eventually transferred to SR 86. Likewise, the freeway replacement for State Route 180 in Fresno was initially referred to as State Route 180S.

==History==
The first legislative routes were defined by the State Highway Bond Act in 1909, passed by the California State Legislature and signed by Governor James Gillett. These, and later extensions to the system, were numbered sequentially. No signs were erected for these routes.

The United States Numbered Highways were assigned by the American Association of State Highway Officials (AASHO) in November 1926, but posting did not begin in California until January 1928. These were assigned to some of the main legislative routes in California. Initially, signs were posted by the Automobile Club of Southern California (ACSC) and California State Automobile Association (CSAA), which had been active in signing national auto trails and local roads since the mid-1900s.

In 1934, after the major expansion of the state highway system in 1933 by the California Legislature, California sign route numbers were assigned by the California Division of Highways (predecessor to Caltrans). The California sign route numbers were assigned in a geographical system, completely independent of the legislative routes. Odd-numbered routes ran north–south and even-numbered routes ran east–west. The routes were split among southern California (ACSC) and central and northern California (CSAA) as follows:
*0 or 1 modulo 4: central and northern California
*2 or 3 modulo 4: southern California
For instance, State Route 1 and State Route 4 were in central and northern California, and State Route 2 and State Route 3 (since moved) were in southern California. A rough grid was used inside the two regions, with the largest numbers – all less than 200 (except for State Route 740, which was related to State Route 74) – in eastern California (north–south) and near the border between the two regions (east–west).
The Interstate Highway System numbers were assigned by AASHO in late 1959. In 1963 and 1964, a total renumbering of the legislative routes was made, aligning them with the sign routes. Some changes were also made to the sign routes, mostly related to decommissionings of U.S. Routes in favor of Interstates.

Since the 1990s, many non-freeway routes, especially in urban areas, have been deleted and turned over to local control. This transfers the cost of maintaining them from state to local budgets, but also gives local governments direct control over urban arterial roads that carry primarily local traffic. Once transferred, if a local government wants to add landscaping in the center median or install additional traffic lights or other traffic control devices, it can immediately do so itself rather than having to negotiate with Caltrans. Not all cities have been prepared to accept such routes from Caltrans simultaneously, so many have been decommissioned from the state system one fragment at a time. In the case of the San Francisco Bay Area, the Caltrans district responsible for that region is granted permission to retain in the State highway system routes that run on conventional (non freeway or expressway) roadways unless a freeway is built to bypass the surface street route.

==Nomenclature in California English==

One cultural difference between Northern and Southern Californians is that the latter tend to put the definite article &quot;the&quot; before highway numbers (e.g. &quot;taking &quot;the&quot; 5 to L.A.&quot;), while the former use the number alone (e.g. &quot;taking 80 to San Francisco&quot;) or less frequently, with &quot;I-&quot; in the case of interstate freeways. The Southern California usage of the definite article is seen as stereotypical of Southern California &quot;surfer&quot; culture, and has been parodied in the recurring &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; sketch &quot;The Californians&quot;. When the Southern California freeway system was built in the 1940s and early 1950s, local common usage was primarily the freeway name preceded by the definite article, such as &quot;the Hollywood Freeway&quot;. It took several decades for Southern California locals to start to commonly refer to the freeways with the numerical designations, but usage of the definite article persisted. For example, it evolved to &quot;the 605 Freeway&quot; and then shortened to &quot;the 605&quot;. This did not occur in Northern California, where usage of the route numbers was more common.

<text>The flag of Nigeria was designed by Michael Taiwo Akinkunmi and was officially adopted to represent Nigeria at midnight on 1 October 1960, the day the country gained independence. The flag was chosen as part of a nationwide open contest held by the government, with Akinkunmi&#x27;s design being selected as the winner of a field of over three thousand entries. The flag is a vertical bicolour green-white-green design, with green representing agriculture and white representing peace and unity.

The flag was raised for the first time in a ceremony by Lieutenant David Ejoor of the Army Guard.

== History and design ==
In preparation for the independence of Nigeria from the British Empire, a national planning committee was established which set a competition to select a national flag in 1958. In 1959, out of almost 3,000 entries, Michael Taiwo Akinkunmi won the competition with an equal green-white-green with a red quarter sun on the white stripe was chosen. After acceptance, the committee removed the red quarter sun. The accepted flag now consists of a vertical bicolour green-white-green; the green stands for agriculture and the white stands for unity and peace. On 1 October 1960, the modern-day flag became the first official flag of an independent Nigeria and was raised for the first time in a ceremony by Lieutenant David Ejoor.

== Historical and variant flags ==

In the late 17th century, present-day Nigeria was made up of diverse ethnic groups without national flags
In 1914, after the of the Southern Nigeria Protectorate and Northern Nigeria Protectorate, Lord Lugard chose a British blue ensign with a green hexagram described as the Zionist-like Star of David surrounding the royal crown with the white word &quot;Nigeria&quot; under it on a red disc as the flag of the Nigerian Protectorate.

The standard of the President of Nigeria from 1960 had a red field with a large green shield and fimbriated white in the centre. It also features a black shield with a wavy-edged &quot;Y&quot;—representing the confluence of the Niger and Benue Rivers. There are three black scrolls containing the legend &quot;President&quot;, &quot;Federal Republic&quot;, &quot;of Nigeria&quot; placed on each scroll respectively in gold letters. This was replaced with the Nigerian coat of arm placed on the white stripe of the Nigerian flag; this also serves as the state flag.

<doc id="459279" wikidata="Q202189" url="?curid=459279" title="Flag of Niue">
<text>The flag of [[Niue]] was adopted on 15 October 1975. It consists of the Union Jack in the upper left corner with a star in the middle of the Union Jack and four stars forming a diamond around it. It is very unusual for a flag based on a British ensign design, in having not only a yellow background, but also a defaced (edited) Union Jack in the canton. It was designed by Patricia Rex, the wife of the then-Premier Robert Rex.

==Definition==
From the &quot;Niue Flag Act 1975&quot;: &quot;The Niue National Flag shall be a golden yellow flag, bearing on the upper canton of the hoist there of the Union Flag, commonly known as the Union Jack, displaying 2 five-pointed yellow stars on the vertical line and on the horizontal line thereof separated by a blue disc containing a larger five-pointed yellow star.&quot;

==Symbolism==
The symbolism represented by the flag is described in the Act. The Union Jack symbolises the protection granted by the United Kingdom in 1900 after petitioning by the Kings and Chiefs of Niue. The yellow field symbolises &quot;the bright sunshine of Niue and the warm feelings of the Niuean people towards New Zealand and her people.&quot; The association with New Zealand, which took over responsibility and administration of Niue in 1901, is also represented by the four small stars that depict the Southern Cross. Finally, the blue disc containing a larger star represents the deep blue sea surrounding the self-governing island of Niue.

<doc id="459280" wikidata="Q283617" url="?curid=459280" title="Su (Unix)">
<text>The Unix command , which stands for &#x27;substitute user&#x27; (or historically &#x27;superuser&#x27;), is used by a computer user to execute commands with the privileges of another user account. When executed it invokes a shell without changing the current working directory or the user environment.

When the command is used without specifying the new user id as a command line argument, it defaults to using the superuser account (user id 0) of the system.

== History ==
The command , including the Unix permissions system and the setuid system call, was part of Version 1 Unix. Encrypted passwords appeared in Version 3. The command is available as a separate package for Microsoft Windows as part of the UnxUtils collection of native Win32 ports of common GNU Unix-like utilities.

The command was removed from GNU coreutils as of release 8.18 (2012-08-12) and is currently included in the util-linux package.

== Usage ==
When run from the command line, su asks for the target user&#x27;s password, and if authenticated, grants the operator access to that account and the files and directories that account is permitted to access.
john@localhost:~$ su jane
Password:
jane@localhost:/home/john$ exit
logout
john@localhost:~$ 
When used with a hyphen () it can be used to start a login shell. In this mode users can assume the user environment of the target user.
john@localhost:~$ su - jane
Password:
jane@localhost:~$
The command sudo is related, and executes a command as another user but observes a set of constraints about which users can execute which commands as which other users (generally in a configuration file named , best editable by the command ). Unlike , authenticates users against their own password rather than that of the target user (to allow the delegation of specific commands to specific users on specific hosts without sharing passwords among them and while mitigating the risk of any unattended terminals).

Some Unix-like systems implement the user group &quot;wheel&quot;, and only allow members to become root with . This may or may not mitigate these security concerns, since an intruder might first simply break into one of those accounts. GNU , however, does not support the group &quot;wheel&quot; for philosophical reasons. Richard Stallman argues that because the group would prevent users from utilizing root passwords leaked to them, the group would allow existing admins to ride roughshod over ordinary users.

<doc id="459283" wikidata="Q235445" url="?curid=459283" title="Flag of Norfolk Island">
<text>The flag of Norfolk Island is a triband consisting of green, white, and green bands charged with a green Norfolk Island pine in the centre. Adopted in 1979 when the islands gained limited self-government, it has been the flag of the Territory of Norfolk Island since 6 June of that year. The pine is native to the territory and is its official tree.

==History==
Norfolk Island was first sighted by James Cook in 1774 during his second voyage to the southern Pacific Ocean. Settlers moved to the island in March 1788, when it was claimed by the colony of New South Wales. Cook surmised that the Norfolk Island pine (&quot;Araucaria heterophylla&quot;) could be utilised for the masts of ships, but his prediction ultimately did not come to fruition.

The island was initially employed as a penal colony until 1814, and again from 1825 to 1855. It was then used in 1856 to relocate people from the Pitcairn Islands, which had become overpopulated, and Norfolk Island was consequently designated &quot;a distinct and separate settlement&quot; from mainland Australia on 24 June of the same year. It later lost its self-governing status in 1897, when the British placed the territory under the administration of the Governor of New South Wales. The island joined the now-independent Commonwealth of Australia as a territory under the &quot;Norfolk Island Act 1913&quot;. However, its exact constitutional relationship with the rest of the commonwealth was not enunciated at the time.

A royal commission was established in 1975 to resolve Norfolk Island&#x27;s constitutional status. Four years later, the territory was granted its own legislative assembly, but remained unrepresented in the Federal Parliament. The bill that became the &quot;Norfolk Island Flag and Public Seal Act 1979&quot; was introduced to the Australian Parliament that same year and received royal assent on 17 January 1980.

==Design==
===Description===
The flag of Norfolk Island is described in detail in &quot;Norfolk Island Flag and Public Seal Act 1979&quot;, federal legislation that has been in force from 17 January 1980. It specifies the flag is to have an aspect ratio of 1:2. The act specifies Pantone Matching System 356 for the green of the flag, without giving any further detail on the white.

===Symbolism===
The colours and symbols of the flag carry cultural, political, and regional meanings. The green symbolises Norfolk Island&#x27;s plentiful vegetation and fertile land. The Norfolk Island pine is native to the islands, and is the official tree of the territory.

===Similarities===

The Norfolk Islander flag bears a likeness to the flag of Canada. Both banners employ only two colours in a vertical triband design and feature a regional arboreal symbol in the middle band. The flag is also similar to the flag of Neuquén Province. Both banners employ a two coloured triband design and feature an araucaria tree. Norfolk Island&#x27;s flag is also analogous to the flag of Nigeria, which utilises a triband of green and white in a similar fashion.

<text>The flag of the Commonwealth of the [[Northern Mariana Islands]] was adopted in July 1, 1985 by the Second Northern Marianas Constitution. The NMI flag was originally designed during the year 1985. Later during that year, they finalized the draft of the flag in the last CNMI constitutional convention.

The flag consists of three symbols: a white star representing the United States, a gray latte stone representing the Chamorro people, and a multi-colored &quot;mwarmwar&quot; (floral wreath) representing the Carolinians. The mwarmwar is made from the green ylang-ylang (langilang; Cananga odorata), the white plumeria (flores mayo or seyúr; Plumeria alba), the red peacock flower (angagha; Caesalpinia pulcherrima), and the pink Pacific basil (teibwo; Ocimum tenuiflorum). Its dark blue background represents the Pacific Ocean and the Mariana Trench. According to US Flags Design Website, the area is 78 inches in width and 40 inches in height.

<text>The Royal New Zealand Navy (RNZN; ) is the maritime arm of the New Zealand Defence Force. The fleet currently consists of eight ships. The Navy had its origins in the Naval Defence Act 1913, and the subsequent acquisition of the cruiser , which by 1921 had been moored in Auckland as a training ship. A slow buildup occurred during the interwar period, and then in December 1939 fought alongside two other Royal Navy cruisers at the Battle of the River Plate against the German ship, &quot;Graf Spee&quot;.

==History==
===Pre–World War I===
The first recorded maritime combat activity in New Zealand occurred off the northern tip of the South Island in December 1642. Māori in war canoes attacked and killed four seamen from Abel Tasman&#x27;s party, who were at the time in low boats between the main ships.

The New Zealand Navy did not exist as a separate military force until 1941. The association of the Royal Navy with New Zealand began with the arrival of James Cook in 1769, who completed two subsequent journeys to New Zealand in 1773 and 1777. Occasional visits by Royal Navy ships were made from the late 18th century. The Royal Navy played a part in the New Zealand Wars: for example, a gunboat shelled fortified Māori pā from the Waikato River in order to defeat the Māori King Movement.

===World War I and the inter-war period===
In 1909 the New Zealand government decided to fund the purchase of the battlecruiser for the Royal Navy, which saw action throughout World War I in Europe. The passing of the Naval Defence Act 1913 created the New Zealand Naval Forces, still a part of the Royal Navy. The first ship given by the British government for the New Zealand Naval Forces was the cruiser , which escorted New Zealand land forces to occupy the German colony of Samoa in 1914. &quot;Philomel&quot; saw further action under the command of the Royal Navy in the Mediterranean, the Red Sea, and the Persian Gulf. By 1917 she was worn out and was sent back to New Zealand where she served as a depot ship in Wellington Harbour for minesweepers. In 1921 she was transferred to Auckland for use as a training ship.

The New Zealand Naval Forces passed to the control of Commander-in-Chief, China, after the Royal Navy forces in Australia came under Canberra&#x27;s control in 1911. From 1921 to 1941 the force was known as the New Zealand Division of the Royal Navy. The cruiser &quot;Chatham&quot; along with the sloop &quot;Veronica&quot; arrived in 1920, &quot;Philomel&quot; was transferred to the Division in 1921, as was the sloop &quot;Torch&quot;, arrived in 1922 and then in 1924. and the minesweeper HMS &quot;Wakakura&quot; arrived in 1926. Between World War I and World War II, the New Zealand Division operated a total of 14 ships, including the cruisers HMS &quot;Achilles&quot; (joined 31 March 1937) and HMS &quot;Leander&quot;, which replaced &quot;Diomede&quot; and &quot;Dunedin&quot; (replaced by &quot;Leander&quot; in 1937).

===World War II===
When Britain went to war against Germany in 1939, New Zealand officially declared war at the same time, backdated to 9.30 pm on 3 September local time. But the gathering in Parliament in Carl Berendsen&#x27;s room (including Peter Fraser) could not follow Chamberlain&#x27;s words because of static on the shortwave and waited until the Admiralty notified the fleet that war had broken out before Cabinet approved the declaration of war (the official telegram from Britain was delayed and arrived just before midnight).

 participated in the first major naval battle of World War II, the Battle of the River Plate off the River Plate estuary between Argentina and Uruguay, in December 1939. &quot;Achilles&quot; and two other cruisers, and , severely damaged the German pocket battleship &quot;Admiral Graf Spee&quot;. The German Captain Hans Langsdorff then scuttled &quot;Graf Spee&quot; rather than face the loss of many more German seamen&#x27;s lives. 


&quot;Achilles&quot; moved to the Pacific, and was working with the United States Navy (USN) when damaged by a Japanese bomb off New Georgia. Following repair, she served alongside the British Pacific Fleet until the war&#x27;s end.

The New Zealand Division of the Royal Navy became the Royal New Zealand Navy (RNZN) on 1 October 1941, in recognition of the fact that the naval force was now largely self-sufficient and independent of the Royal Navy. The Prime Minister Peter Fraser reluctantly agreed, though saying &quot;now was not the time to break away from the old country&quot;. Ships thereafter were prefixed HMNZS (His/Her Majesty&#x27;s New Zealand Ship).

 escorted the New Zealand Expeditionary Force to the Middle East in 1940 and was then deployed in the Mediterranean, the Red Sea, and the Indian Ocean. &quot;Leander&quot; was subjected to air and naval attack from Axis forces, conducted bombardments, and escorted convoys. In February 1941, &quot;Leander&quot; sank the Italian auxiliary cruiser in the Indian Ocean. In 1943, after serving further time in the Mediterranean, &quot;Leander&quot; returned to the Pacific Ocean. She assisted in the destruction of the and was seriously damaged by torpedoes during the Battle of Kolombangara. The extent of the damage to &quot;Leander&quot; saw her docked for repairs until the end of the war.

As the war progressed, the size of the RNZN greatly increased, and by the end of the war, there were over 60 ships in commission. These ships participated as part of the British and Commonwealth effort against the Axis in Europe, and against the Japanese in the Pacific. They also played an important role in the defence of New Zealand, from German raiders, especially when the threat of invasion from Japan appeared imminent in 1942. Many merchant ships were requisitioned and armed for help in defence. One of these was , which saw action against the off Fiji in 1942. In 1941–1942, it was decided in an agreement between the New Zealand and United States governments that the best role for the RNZN in the Pacific was as part of the United States Navy, so operational control of the RNZN was transferred to the South West Pacific Area command, and its ships joined United States 7th Fleet taskforces.

In 1943, the light cruiser was transferred to the RNZN as HMNZS &quot;Gambia&quot;. In November 1944, the British Pacific Fleet, a joint British Commonwealth military formation, was formed, based in Sydney, Australia. Most RNZN ships, including &quot;Gambia&quot; and &quot;Achilles&quot;, were transferred to the BPF. They took part in the Battle of Okinawa and operations in the Sakishima Islands, near Japan. In August 1945, HMNZS &quot;Gambia&quot; was New Zealand&#x27;s representative at the surrender of Japan.

===Post-World War II===
During April 1947 a series of non-violent mutinies occurred amongst the sailors and non-commissioned officers of four RNZN ships and two shore bases. Overall, up to 20% of the sailors in the RNZN were involved in the mutinies. The resulting manpower shortage forced the RNZN to remove the light cruiser , one of their most powerful warships, from service and set the navy&#x27;s development and expansion back by a decade. Despite this impact, the size and scope of the events have been downplayed over time.

RNZN ships participated in the Korean War. On 29 June, just four days after 135,000 North Korean troops crossed the 38th parallel in Korea, the New Zealand government ordered two frigates – and to prepare to make for Korean waters, and for the whole of the war, at least two NZ vessels would be on station in the theater.

On 3 July these two first ships left Devonport Naval Base, Auckland and joined other Commonwealth forces at Sasebo, Japan, on 2 August. These vessels served under the command of a British flag officer (seemingly Flag Officer Second in Command Far East Fleet) and formed part of the US Navy screening force during the Battle of Inchon, performing shore raids and inland bombardment. Further RNZN &quot;Loch&quot;-class frigates joined these later – , , and , as well as a number of smaller craft. Only one RNZN sailor was killed during the conflict – during the Inchon bombardments.

The Navy later participated in the Malayan Emergency. In 1954 a New Zealand frigate, HMNZS &quot;Pukaki&quot;, carried out a bombardment of a suspected guerilla camp, while operating with the Royal Navy&#x27;s Far East Fleet – the first of a number of bombardments by RNZN ships over the next five years. Jack Welch, later to become Chief of Naval Staff decades later, wrote that in 1959, the RNZN &quot;was still very much part of the Royal Navy supported by New Zealand tax-payers. The officer corps and senior specialist ratings were very dependent on loan and exchange RN personnel, while our own [New Zealand] officers and senior ratings were almost exclusively trained in the UK. We simply borrowed the RN&#x27;s administrative regulations and amended them to local conditions. The Empire was alive and well. Operationally we were still very strongly tied to the UK.&quot;

Later the Navy return to Malayan waters during the Indonesia-Malaysia confrontation. These operations were the RNZN&#x27;s last large-scale operation with the Royal Navy. In a security crisis and threat to Malaysia and Sarawak and Brunei, two-thirds of the Royal Navy&#x27;s operational warships were deployed from 1963 to the end of 1966 with , , and , heavily involved in boarding ships, shore patrols, presence, maintaining the use of seaways and support of the RN&#x27;s amphibious carriers. The commitment, wrote Welch, &quot;involved the whole fleet, as ships rotated though Pearl Harbor for workup with the USN before deploying on to the Far East to relieve ships on station.&quot;

Until the 1960s the RNZN had, in common with other Dominion navies, flown the White Ensign as a common ensign. After 1945, the foreign policies of the now-independent states had become more distinctive. There was a growing wish and a need for separate identities, particularly if one Dominion was engaged in hostilities where another was not. Thus, in 1968, the RNZN adopted its own ensign, which retained the Union Flag in a top quarter but replaces the St George&#x27;s Cross with the Southern Cross constellation that is displayed on the national flag.

Since 1946 the Navy has policed New Zealand&#x27;s territorial waters and exclusive economic zone for fisheries protection. It also aids New Zealand&#x27;s scientific activities in Antarctica, at Scott Base.

One of the best-known roles that the RNZN played on the world stage was when the frigates and were sent by the Labour Government of Norman Kirk to Moruroa Atoll in 1973 to protest against French nuclear testing there. The frigates were sent into the potential blast zone of the weapons, where both ships witnessed one airburst test each which forced France to then change to underground testing.

In May 1982 Prime Minister Rob Muldoon seconded the frigate &quot;Canterbury&quot; to the Royal Navy for the duration of the Falklands War. &quot;Canterbury&quot; was deployed to the Armilla Patrol in the Persian Gulf, to relieve a British frigate for duty in the South Atlantic. &quot;Canterbury&quot; was herself relieved by in August.

===Post-Cold War===
At the close of the Cold War the RNZN had an escort force of four frigates (, , , and HMNZS &quot;Southland&quot; (F104)). Due to the cost of replacing four ships, the force was downsized to two. However, there was considerable political debate at times during the mid-1990s about whether a third and fourth Anzac-class frigate should be procured.

In the past three decades, the RNZN has operated in the Middle East a number of times. RNZN ships played a role in the Iran–Iraq War, aiding the Royal Navy in protecting neutral shipping in the Indian Ocean. Frigates were also sent to participate in the first Gulf War, and more recently Operation Enduring Freedom. The RNZN has played an important part in conflicts in the Pacific as well. Naval forces were utilised in the Bougainville, Solomon Islands and East Timor conflicts of the 1990s. The RNZN often participates in United Nations peacekeeping operations.

The hydrographic survey ship of the RNZN until 2012 was , succeeding the long-serving . &quot;Resolution&quot; was used to survey and chart the sea around New Zealand and the Pacific Islands. A small motor boat, SMB &quot;Adventure&quot;, was operated from &quot;Resolution&quot;. &quot;Resolution&quot; carried some of the most advanced survey technology available. HMNZS &quot;Resolution&quot; was decommissioned at Devonport Naval Base on 27 April 2012.

In October 2021 the Defence Force contributed to the UK Carrier Strike Group&#x27;s transit through the South China Sea. This deployment sought to reiterate New Zealand&#x27;s support for free international passage through the South China Sea, which has been claimed by China as part of its territorial waters. In June 2023, was confronted by two People&#x27;s Liberation Army Navy frigates, helicopters, and four other vessels near the disputed Spratly Islands.

In late September 2024 Defence Minister Judith Collins confirmed that HMNZS &quot;Aotearoa&quot; had sailed through the disputed Taiwan Strait with . In response, a spokesperson for the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that China &quot;handles foreign warships&#x27; transit through the Taiwan Strait in accordance with laws and regulations&quot;. On 29 September HMNZS &quot;Aotearoa&quot; took part in a joint maritime patrol with Australian, Filipino, Japanese and United States warships and aircraft in the disputed South China Sea, which has also been claimed by China.
==Ships and aircraft==

===Current===
====Naval Combat Force====
The Combat Force consists of two &quot;Anzac-class&quot; frigates: HMNZS &quot;Te Kaha&quot; and HMNZS &quot;Te Mana&quot;. Initially, two more frigates were planned, but this was cancelled due to the political pressure surrounding defence expenditure following the New Zealand breakup of military relations with ANZUS in 1986.

Both ships are based at the Devonport Naval Base in Auckland. HMNZS &quot;Te Kaha&quot; was commissioned on 26 July 1997 and HMNZS &quot;Te Mana&quot; on 10 December 1999. The specifications and armaments of the two ships are identical. Both ships completed refits in 2020 and 2022 respectively.

====Naval Patrol Force====
The Patrol Force consists of two offshore patrol vessels. The Patrol Force is responsible for policing New Zealand&#x27;s Exclusive Economic Zone, one of the largest in the world. In addition, the Patrol Force provides assistance to a range of civilian government agencies, including the Department of Conservation, New Zealand Customs and Police, Ministry of Fisheries and others. The Patrol Force consists of:
* 2 s ( and )
====Naval Support Force====
* , a multi-role vessel that entered service in June 2007.
* , a replenishment oiler commissioned in 2020.
==== Littoral Warfare Support Force ====
The Littoral Warfare Support Force consisted of , a dive and hydrographic vessel commissioned in 2019, which sank off the coast of Samoa on 6 October 2024, and HMNZS &quot;Matataua.&quot;

===== Hydrographic survey and clearance diving =====
HMNZS &quot;Matataua&quot; was a land-based unit (a stone frigate) commissioned in 2017 (previously the Littoral Warfare Support Force, the Littoral Warfare Support Group, and most recently the Littoral Warfare Unit) with two operational groups, one for military hydrographic survey and the other clearance diving, and a logistics support group. Detachments from &quot;Matataua&quot; embarked on &quot;Manawanui&quot; when the ship was conducting survey and/or diving operations. &quot;Matataua&quot; was responsible for ensuring access to and the use of harbours, inshore waters and associated littoral zones through shallow water and coastal survey, mine-countermeasures and explosive ordnance disposal, beach survey and reconnaissance in support of amphibious operations, and underwater engineering. &quot;Matataua&quot; also provided underwater search and recovery support to the NZ Police, and other government and civil agencies as requested and approved through Headquarters Joint Forces New Zealand.

====Aviation====
The Royal New Zealand Air Force operates eight Kaman SH-2G(I) Super Seasprite helicopters. These aircraft are part of No. 6 Squadron RNZAF based at RNZAF Base Auckland. The aircraft are operated by RNZN aviators and are assigned to RNZN ships as required. The roles of the helicopters include:
* Surveillance
* Surface warfare 
* Underwater warfare
* Helicopter delivery services/logistics
* Search and rescue
* Medical evacuation
* Training
* Assistance to other Government agencies

==== Non-commissioned vessels ====
A number of non-commissioned auxiliary vessels are used for a number or littoral, support and training purposes.

* Three Chico 40 sail training yachts (&quot;Manga II, Mako II, Paea II).&quot;
* Two Landing Craft Mechanised landing craft (&quot;LC01, LC02) -&quot; Used aboard &quot;HMNZS Canterbury.&quot;
* Three Littoral Manoeuvre Craft.
* Two Surtees Workmate hydrographic and diving support launches (&quot;Pathfinder&quot;, &quot;Hammerhead&quot;).
* One VIP (Admiral&#x27;s) Barge.
* Nine Zodiac Hurricane RHIBs.
* 26 Zodiac Milpro J3 RHIBs.

==== Unmanned vehicles ====

The RNZN operates a small number of autonomous underwater vehicles, as well as two uncrewed surface vessels.

The RNZN does not operate any ship-based unmanned aerial systems. However, according to a recent tender document, there exists some considerable scope for the acquisition of new systems.

===Future===
==Role==
===Defence===

In its Statement of Intent, the NZDF states its primary mission as:

:&quot;to secure New Zealand from external threat, to protect our sovereign interests, including in the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) and to be able to take action to meet likely contingencies in our strategic area of interest.&quot;

The intermediate outcomes of the NZDF are listed as:
# Secure New Zealand, including its people, land, territorial waters, exclusive economic zone, natural resources and critical infrastructure.
# Reduced risks to New Zealand from regional and global insecurity.
# New Zealand values and interests advanced through participation in regional and international security systems.
# New Zealand is able to meet future national security challenges.

The role of the navy is to fulfil the maritime elements of the missions of the NZDF.

===International participation===
The RNZN has a role to help prevent any unrest occurring in New Zealand. This can be done by having a presence in overseas waters and assisting redevelopment in troubled countries. For example, any unrest in the Pacific Islands has the potential to affect New Zealand because of the large Pacific Island population. The stability of the South Pacific is considered in the interest of New Zealand. The navy has participated in peace-keeping and peace-making in
East Timor, Bougainville and the Solomon Islands, supporting land-based operations.

===Civilian roles===
The 2002 Maritime Forces Review identified a number of roles that other government agencies required the RNZN to undertake. Approximately 1,400 days at sea are required to fulfil these roles annually.

Roles include patrolling the exclusive economic zone, transport to offshore islands, and support for the New Zealand Customs Service.

The RNZN formerly produced hydrographic information for Land Information New Zealand (LINZ) under a commercial contract arrangement, however with the decommissioning of the dedicated hydrographic survey ship HMNZS &quot;Resolution&quot; this has lapsed and the Navy now focuses on military hydrography. Hydrospatial information is still provided to LINZ but on an ad-hoc basis.

===Deployments===

Since 2001, both &quot;Anzac&quot;-class frigates have participated in the United States&#x27; Operation Enduring Freedom in the Persian Gulf and have conducted maritime patrol operations in support of American and allied efforts in Afghanistan.

The RNZN routinely deploys within its primary area of operations of the Southwest Pacific and Southern Ocean down to Antarctica as directed by government, and to meet New Zealand&#x27;s responsibilities in its search and rescue area. Deployments further afield are conducted as required to meet the strategic intent of the Government of New Zealand.

==Personnel==
As of 30 June 2022, the RNZN consisted of 2,219 Regular Force personnel and 611 Naval Reserve personnel.

===Reserves===

====Naval Reserve====

All regular force personnel on discharge from the RNZN are liable for service in the Royal New Zealand Naval Reserve. The Reserve has an active and inactive list. RNZN personnel can choose to serve four years in the Reserve on discharge.

====Volunteer Reserve====

The primary reserve component of the RNZN is the Royal New Zealand Naval Volunteer Reserve (RNZNVR), which is organised into four units based in Auckland (with a satellite unit at Tauranga), Wellington, Christchurch, and Dunedin:
* HMNZS &quot;Ngapona&quot;: Naval Reserve, Auckland
* HMNZS &quot;Olphert&quot;: Naval Reserve, Wellington
* HMNZS &quot;Pegasus&quot;: Naval Reserve, Christchurch
* HMNZS &quot;Toroa&quot;: Naval Reserve, Dunedin

At present civilians can join the RNZNVR in one of three branches: Administration, Sea Service (for service on inshore patrol vessels), and Maritime Trade Organisation (formerly Naval Control of Shipping). In addition ex-regular force personnel can now join the RNZNVR in their former branch and, depending on time out of the service, rank.

===Training===
Naval Ratings begin an 18-week basic training course (Basic Common Training (BCT)) prior to commencing their branch training (Basic Branch Training) which focuses on their chosen trade.

Naval Officers complete 22 weeks of training in three phases (Junior Officer Common Training (JOCT)) before commencing specialist training.

== Finance ==
===Routine funding===

The RNZN is funded through a &quot;vote&quot; of the Parliament of New Zealand. The New Zealand Defence Force funds personnel, operating and finance costs. Funding is then allocated to specific &quot;Output Classes&quot;, which are aligned to policy objectives.

Funding allocation in each Output Class includes consumables, personnel, depreciation and a &#x27;Capital Charge&#x27;. The Capital Charge is a budgetary mechanism to reflect the cost of Crown capital and was set at 7.5% for the 2009/2010 year.

===Large projects===
The Ministry of Defence is responsible for the acquisition of significant items of military equipment needed to meet New Zealand Defence Force capability requirements. Funding for the Ministry of Defence is appropriated separately.

== Shore establishments ==

=== The Navy Museum ===

The Navy Museum of the Royal New Zealand Navy is located at 64 King Edward Parade, Devonport, Auckland, New Zealand
 and contains important collections of naval artefacts and extensive records.

=== Naval Communications Facility &quot;Irirangi&quot; ===
HMNZS &quot;Irirangi&quot; was a Naval Communication Station at Waiouru from 1943 to 1993.

==Uniforms and insignia==
Uniforms of the RNZN are very similar to those of the British Royal Navy and other Commonwealth of Nations navies. However, RNZN personnel wear the nationality marker &quot;NEW ZEALAND&quot; on a curved shoulder flash on the service uniform and embroidered on shoulder slip-ons. Also, the RNZN uses the rank of Ensign as its lowest commissioned rank and five-pointed stars for Flag Officers.

<doc id="459287" wikidata="Q188609" url="?curid=459287" title="Flag of Palau">
<text>The Flag of [[Palau]] was adopted on 1 January 1981, when the island group separated from the United Nations Trust Territory. As with the flags of several other Pacific island groups, light blue is the color used to represent the ocean and the nation&#x27;s place within it. While this puts Palau in common with the Federated States of Micronesia and other neighboring island groups, the disc on the flag (similar to that on Japan&#x27;s flag) is off-centre like that of the flag of Bangladesh, but in this case the disk represents the moon instead of the sun. The current flag was introduced in 1981 when Palau became a republic.

Previously, the flag of the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands was flown jointly with the United Nations and American flags. The explanation for the choice of colors is rooted in the history and customs of the Palauan people. The light blue of the field symbolizes the Pacific Ocean, and also represents the transition from foreign domination to self-government. The golden disk, which sits slightly off-center toward the hoist, represents the full moon. The Palauans consider the full moon to be the optimum time for human activity. At this time of the month, celebrations, fishing, sowing, harvesting, tree-felling, and the carving of traditional canoes are carried out. The full moon is a symbol of peace, love, and tranquility.

== Construction ==

According to the Palauan government website, the flag is a golden-yellow full moon slightly off-centered on a field of sky blue. The width of flag is 13⁄5 of the flag&#x27;s height, meaning the aspect ratio is 5:8. The moon&#x27;s diameter is 3⁄5 of the flag&#x27;s height, its center is placed on the middle of the flag&#x27;s height and the 7⁄10 part of the flag&#x27;s height from the hoist side.

==Supposed relationship to the Rising Sun Flag==
Japanese international relations professor Futaranosuke Nagoshi has suggested that the Palauan flag (which depicts the Moon) pays tribute to the Rising Sun Flag of Japan and symbolizes amity between Palau and Japan. Former Palauan President Kuniwo Nakamura responded to this theory in an interview with the ambiguous statement, &quot;That&#x27;s one way of putting it.&quot; John Blau Skebong, the designer of the flag, denied such allegation, saying there is no special connection between the two flags.

<doc id="459289" wikidata="Q168941" url="?curid=459289" title="Flag of Panama">
<text>The national flag of Panama was made by María de la Ossa de Amador and was officially adopted by the &quot;ley 48 de 1925&quot;. The Panamanian flag day is celebrated on November 4, one day after Panamanian separation from Colombia, and is one of a series of holidays celebrated in November known as the Fiestas Patrias.

The first flag proposed in 1903 consisted of thirteen horizontal stripes of alternating red and yellow, with a blue canton containing two golden suns, joined by a narrow line to depict North and South America joined by the Isthmus of Panama (see the depiction below). However, this was not accepted by the Panamanian leader, Manuel Amador Guerrero, whose family designed a new flag.

The stars and quarters are said to stand for the rival political parties, and the white is said to stand for the peace in which they operate. Blue was the color of the Conservatives and red was the color of the Liberals.

==History==
===Bunau-Varilla proposal===


The wife of Philippe-Jean Bunau-Varilla designed the first serious proposal for a Panamanian flag. Bunau-Varilla&#x27;s design was based on the flag of the United States, possibly on account of that country&#x27;s hand in Panamanian independence. Retaining the thirteen stripes, she changed the white stripes to yellow, emphasizing the Panamanian connection to Colombia and Spain (whose flags both prominently feature red and yellow). Bunau-Varilla replaced the stars in the blue canton with two interconnected yellow suns; the suns represent North and South America, and are connected because of Panama&#x27;s position connecting the two continents. Bunau-Varilla&#x27;s proposal was rejected by Manuel Amador Guerrero and his fellow revolutionaries because it was too similar to the U.S. flag, and they, therefore, gave the task of designing a flag to Guerrero&#x27;s son.

===María de la Ossa de Amador proposal===
The original Panamanian flag was made by María de la Ossa de Amador, the first First Lady of Panama, on November 1, 1903. Manuel Amador Guerrero&#x27;s son, Manuel Encarnación Amador, generally recognized as a skillful draftsman, sketched the flag and showed it to María de la Ossa de Amador, who, after much difficulty in avoiding the Colombian army, eventually produced three copies of the flag, with help from her sister-in-law Angélica Bergamonta de la Ossa and niece, María Emilia de la Ossa Bergamonta. All three flags were flown in Panama City upon independence, and distributed widely. The original flag differs from the present flag in that the upper left quadrant was blue. After independence, when blue was chosen as a color of one of the political parties, the quadrants were shifted to make the top left quadrant white.

==Description==
The Panamanian government officially described the flag in law on December 15, 1949, as follows:

This flag was to reflect the political situation of the time: 
* The blue was intended to represent the Conservative Party;
* The red to represent the Liberal Party;
* The white was intended to stand for peace and purity;
* The blue star stands for the purity and honesty of the life of the country; 
* The red star represents the authority and law in the country, and together the stars stand for the new republic.
The London Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games listed the Pantone colours of the flag as red: 186 and blue: 300.

==Protocol==
===Daily use=== 

The Panamanian flag can only be hoisted if it is in good condition and it must be hoisted after seven in the morning and lowered before six in the evening. The rope of the flagpole must be white and braided with a thickness of 1/4 inch, and the flagpole must have a height of six times the width of the flag, except when the flag has a special dimensions. In the following places it must always be flown:

*Buildings of both autonomous and semi-autonomous public institutions.
*In all vessels with Panamanian registration.
*In all foreign ships that arrive at ports of the Republic of Panama.
*In the buildings of the delegations, embassies and consulates of the Republic of Panama.
*In all the schools of the Republic during their working hours.

When the flag is hoisted, the most due respect must be shown, also at the time of its lowering; people with hats or caps should remove them from their heads and cross their right hand over their chest with the hat on it and women should place their right hand over their heart. It should always be vigorously hoisted and ceremoniously lowered. In case of adverse weather conditions, the flag must be lowered immediately and taken to a safe place where it will be folded. At the time of lowering the flag, it must not touch the ground or anything below it.

When hoisting or lowering in a formed group, three people must be placed in front of the pole on the side corresponding to the upper ring of the support:

*The one who raises and lowers the flag;
*The one who keeps the rope taut;
*The one who receives or displays the flag.

The flag and the anthem are different symbols and therefore each one has a different protocol. The flag is never raised at the time of singing the national anthem, it must always be raised before singing it. The bugle call or drum roll is optional, at the time of hoisting, according to decree 244 of 1971.

===Civic act===
Every Monday, at 7 in the morning including on national holidays, in both private and official schools the civic act is carried out, it must have the following elements:

*All staff on campus at that time.
*An escort made up of three people.
*A master of ceremonies.

The act itself consists of the following steps:

*Flag walk
*Oath
*Secondary acts (messages, prayer, etc.)
*Singing of the National Anthem

===Oath===
The oath to the Panamanian flag was devised by Ernestina Sucre (founder of the Girl Guides) and was adopted by Law 24 of 1959 and confirmed by Law 34 of 1949 in the single text that reflects the reforms of Law 2 of 2012. The oath must always be recited after the flag has been raised.

It is said as follows, raising the right hand at a 90º angle and showing the palm of the hand:

===Using the flag on other sites===
It is allowed by law that residences be decorated with pennants, banners, banners and others that are variants of the colors of the national flag. On the following occasions, decoration with the national flag or pennants, banners and the like is allowed:

*On national holidays
*On days when achievements of the republic are celebrated
*On national days of friendly countries
*On the dates of death of illustrious Panamanians as a shroud after being authorized by the Executive Branch.

The national flag by law, its use in places of nightlife, brothels, in advertising messages, commercial signs, commercial products and animals is prohibited.

Foreign citizens are allowed to use their national flag on the aforementioned occasions, also at the time of celebrations of their respective nations, as long as the Panamanian flag is placed with the same respect, size and quality as foreign flags. .

===Fold===

To fold the flag two people are necessary. After removing the hooks from the rope and stretching the flag out, it is shaken to remove any foreign body that rests on the flag (I). It is then inspected for any damage or fading of the colors. It is folded in half, leaving the blue and white cantons with the red star facing up (II); then it is folded in half again so that the corner with the blue star and the red corner are facing upwards (III). Finally, it is folded in the shape of a right triangle, starting with the red corner (IV), proceeding until it is completely folded. In the end, the white canton should cover the entire exterior of the flag (V).

===Placement===

The national flag has rules and regulations regarding its use in different events worldwide. Among these are the following:

*On balconies it is used as follows:
**Horizontal: It is placed the way it is hoisted on a pole.
**Vertical: it is placed with the corner of the blue star to the upper left side of the observer.
*In the parades and parades : in the days of national holidays, of achievements of great importance for the republic or in the funerals of an illustrious Panamanian (with the remains present), the national flag will be placed at the head of the parade and of each delegation to participate in it, this one with an escort. The pole must not have an inclination greater than 45º.
*In case other flags go next to it, the flag will go in case of being an even number of flags in the right center; if there is an odd number of flags, it will go to the center of these. In case of carrying flags behind it, they will go with the same size and quality as the Panamanian flag.
*When it is placed with other flags : in case of being placed with an even number of flags, it is placed in the left center of the observer. In case of being placed with an odd number of flags, it must be placed in the center of the group. When the Panamanian flag is displayed with a flag of another nation with crossed flagpoles, the Panamanian flag must be to the left of the observer and its flagpole over the other flagpole. The flag must reach the highest point of the mast first when flown alongside flags of other nations; when lowering it must arrive last.
*At funerals : when used to cover a coffin, it should be placed so that the ties are at the head of the deceased and the white quarter with the blue star on the left side.
*It should always go to the right of altars and a speaker.
*Two Panamanian flags must never be crossed.
*The flag does not bow to anyone or anything, on any occasion.

===Flag at half mast===
The national flag is placed at half mast as a symbol of respect of the Panamanian people for a loss or tragic event that is occurring. To place the flag at half mast, it is fully hoisted and then lowered until it reaches half, when lowering it, it is done in reverse, hoisting the flag to the mast and then ceremoniously lowering it. The flag will be flown at half mast at the following times:

*Death of the President of the Republic.
*Death of a former President of the Republic.
*Death of the Vice President or Ministers of State.
*Death of a high-ranking official of the national government.
*Death of a Member of the National Assembly.
*Death of a Justice of the Supreme Court of Justice.
*Death of an illustrious Panamanian (winner of a national or Panamanian order that has excelled internationally).
*Death of an illustrious person worldwide.
*When a natural disaster of great magnitude occurs to a friendly nation.

===Sacrileges=== 
According to the laws that govern the use of national symbols, the flag is subject to improper use, disrespect or irreverence in the following cases:

*Being cut or burned in a protest
*To be used in commercial articles incorporating it into a brand or commercial or political slogan.
*Appear in an advertising guideline that associates it as part of the product.
*Being raised in places of nightlife or its placement in places of dubious reputation or liquor outlet.
*When incurring in one of these situations and depending on the degree of disrespect given to the national flag, the Law establishes sanctions after they are reported to the Mayor&#x27;s Office of the place where the abuse occurred.

===Destruction===
When the national flag reaches the end of its period of use (faded colors, tears), it will be removed from functions and burned in a solemn ceremony.

The flags must be burned in a public and open place so that anyone who wishes to pay their last respects to the national flag can attend. In addition to this, the following elements must exist:

*An oven to incinerate the flags
*A tray to collect the ashes
*A hole in the ground to deposit the ashes
*The flags that will be burned
*The oven is the main element of the ceremony, it must be open and made of heat-resistant material (usually they are built from oil tanks split in half), with a hole at the bottom to let the ashes out; The oven must have an expanded steel mesh to separate the flags from the fuel and the legs of the oven must be iron , 1/4 inch wide and 24 inches long. Under the rules of flag cremation, only mangrove wood can be used for fuel and can only ignite itself without the aid of fossil fuels .

To the cremation ceremony, each Government will invite the people, institutions and forces that it deems appropriate, such as:

*Representatives of the institutions that will cremate their flags
*A representative of the Girl Guides
*Civic club representatives
*A representative of the community where the event is held
*Before proceeding with the cremation, a speech is made about the national flag and its importance in the institutions that will cremate their flags; after this, the oath to the flag is recited.
*The previously folded flags are cremated.

When finished, the ashes are collected and buried with due respect.

<doc id="459293" wikidata="Q170465" url="?curid=459293" title="Flag of Paraguay">
<text>The current design of the flag of Paraguay (; ) was first adopted in 1842. Its design, a red–white–blue triband, was inspired by the colours of the French Tricolour, believed to signify independence and liberty. The flag is unusual because it differs on its obverse and reverse sides: the obverse of the flag shows the national coat of arms, and the reverse shows the seal of the treasury. It is the only national flag worldwide that has a unique design on each side. The flag consists of the same three horizontal colours as the flag of the Netherlands, which in turn was the inspiration for the French flag. It was revised in 2013 to bring the flag towards its original design. It has a ratio of 11:20.

Prior to the current design, the country used two other designs: a similar one with no seal where the white stripe was slightly larger than the other two (1812–1826), and a different simple design featuring a blue field and a six-pointed white star in the upper-left corner (1826–1842).

==Description==
Officially adopted in 1842 (following the Recomendación, i.e.: address, de la Junta gubernativa de Asunción), each side of this tricolour flag contains a horizontal tricolor of red, white and blue with the national emblem centered on the white band. The colours of the flag are believed to be inspired from the flag of France to show independence and liberty, and the coat of arms represents the independence of Paraguay. 

* The emblem on the obverse side is the national coat of arms of Paraguay: a yellow five-pointed star surrounded by a green wreath of palm and olive leaves tied with ribbons of the colour of the stripes, and capped by the words (&quot;Republic of Paraguay&quot; in Spanish), all within two concentric circles).

* The emblem on the reverse side is the seal of the treasury: a yellow lion below a red Phrygian cap on the top of a pole (symbolising courage) and the words &quot;Paz y Justicia&quot; (&quot;Peace and Justice&quot;). 

The differences in the obverse and reverse sides comes from the period when José de Francia was in power (1814–1840). On July 15, 2013, the flag was revised. The coat of arms was simplified and the design was brought closer to its original form.

<doc id="459295" wikidata="Q5360239" url="?curid=459295" title="Hart–Scott–Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act">
<text>The Hart–Scott–Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 (Public Law 94-435, known commonly as the HSR Act) is a set of amendments to the antitrust laws of the United States, principally the Clayton Antitrust Act. The HSR Act was signed into law by president Gerald R. Ford on September 30, 1976. The context in which the HSR Act is usually cited is , title II of the original law. The HSR Act is named after senators Philip Hart and Hugh Scott and representative Peter W. Rodino.

The HSR Act provides that parties must not complete certain mergers, acquisitions or transfers of securities or assets, including grants of executive compensation, until they have made a detailed filing with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and Department of Justice and waited for those agencies to determine that the transaction will not adversely affect U.S. commerce under the antitrust laws. While parties can carry out due diligence and plan for post-merger integration, they may not take any steps to integrate operations, such as an acquiring party obtaining operational control of the acquired party.

==Pre-merger notification and filing fee==
The Act provides that before certain mergers, tender offers or other acquisition transactions (including certain grants of executive compensation) can be completed, both parties must file a &quot;notification and report form&quot; with the Federal Trade Commission and the Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice. The parties then must wait a certain period, usually 30 days (15 days for all-cash tender offers or bankruptcy sales) during which time those regulatory agencies may request further information in order to help them assess whether the proposed transaction violates the antitrust laws of the United States or could cause an anti-competitive effect in the parties&#x27; markets. The filing is not made public, but the agencies may disclose some information about the transaction, especially in the case of publicly announced transactions.

Failure to file the form carries a civil penalty of up to $41,484 per day against the parties, their officers, directors or partners, and the agencies may obtain an order requiring an acquirer to divest assets or securities acquired in violation of the Act. It is also unlawful to complete the transaction during the waiting period, and the same penalties apply. Although the waiting period is generally 30 days (15 days if the transaction is an all-cash tender offer or a bankruptcy sale), the regulators may request additional time to review additional information and the filing parties may request that the waiting period for a particular transaction be terminated early (&quot;early termination&quot;). Early terminations are made public in the Federal Register and posted on the Federal Trade Commission website. Some types of transactions are afforded the special treatment of shorter waiting periods.

===When the notification is required===
The filing requirement is triggered only if the value of the transaction and, in some cases, the size of the parties, exceeds certain dollar thresholds, which are adjusted periodically under the Act. For the purpose of determining the &quot;size of the parties&quot;, one assesses the size of the party&#x27;s ultimate parent entity and all subsidiaries of that entity. The general rule is that a filing is required if three tests are met:
: (1) the transaction affects U.S. commerce;
: (2) either
:: (a) one of the parties has annual sales or total assets of $151.7 million or more (: in 2012 this threshold amount began increasing periodically under the law), and the other party has sales or assets of $15.2 million or more (: this amount adjusts periodically) (where an acquired person is not engaged in manufacturing, only its total assets, not its sales, are counted, unless its sales are over $151.7 million); or
:: (b) the amount of stock the acquirer has is valued at $272.8 million or more (: amount adjusts periodically) at any time; and
: (3) the value of the securities or assets of the other party held by the acquirer after the transaction is $68.2 million or more (: amount adjusts periodically). The 2018 rules raise this amount to US$84.4 million 
There is also a rule prohibiting &quot;interlocking directorates&quot;, that is, it prohibits a person from serving on the board of directors of competing companies valued at over a certain size (this amount was $27.7 million in 2012); but does not apply if the two companies have annual sales in competition with each other of less than $2.7 million.

The rules are somewhat overlapping, but &quot;all&quot; transactions where the acquiring person will hold an aggregate amount of securities and/or assets of $272.8 million or more () require a filing. Also, all transactions worth more than $68.2 million require a filing if one of the parties is worth at least $13.6 million, the other is worth at least $136.4 million and the total amount of assets now owned by the acquirer reaches $272.8 million. If an entity is not sure if the filing requirements apply to it, it can make a request of the Justice Department to determine if it is. Some assets are not counted, generally assets that do not produce income. For example, if one of the parties involved in the transaction is a natural person, for the purposes of determining whether they reach the asset trigger, the value of their primary residence and car are not counted, but the value of a second home that was rented out would be. There are certain exceptions on transaction reporting for usual and customary transactions: such as an airline purchasing planes and certain real estate purchases. An example was given that a merger of two corporations each having a net asset value of $99 million would not require a filing.

In transactions where either the FTC or the Antitrust Division believes there may be significant anti-competitive consequences, either agency may require that the parties submit more background information by means of the second request process.

===Amount of the filing fee===
The firm that is making the proposed acquisition is required to pay a substantial filing fee when making its filing; the amount of the fee is tied to the size of the transaction, the fee was $45,000 for transactions of at least $78.2 million but less than $156.3 million; $125,000 for transactions of $156.3 million to $781.5 million; and $280,000 for transactions over $781.5 million. The filing fee covers additional transactions, during a period of up to five years after the original transaction, that do not exceed the next threshold. There are also filing requirements based on the percentage of acquisition, at 25% of a company worth $1.36 billion, or 50% of a company where the amount held by the acquirer will be worth at least $68.2 million. However, once 50% or more of the target has been acquired, or the amount of acquisitions reported exceeded $682.1 million, no further reports are required to be filed.

==&quot;Parens patriae&quot; actions==

Title III of the Act allows attorneys general of states to sue companies in federal court for monetary damages under antitrust laws as &quot;parens patriae&quot;, on behalf of their citizens. Previously, there was no practicable way for large numbers of individual persons harmed by such anticompetitive activities as small overcharges per person, to sue for damages; it was too costly. Congress sought to remedy that problem with this statute. Title III is in substance the original bill introduced in the House of Representatives by congressman Peter W. Rodino; the other titles of the Act were added as the bill was amended during congressional deliberations.

The effectiveness of the &quot;parens patriae&quot; provision of HSR was greatly weakened by the Supreme Court&#x27;s &quot;Illinois Brick&quot; decision, which substantially limited damages relief to direct purchasers, making consumer indirect purchasers unable to sue. Accordingly, wholesalers or retailers might be able to sue in federal court in a price-fixing case, even though they passed overcharges on to ultimate consumers, but the consumer purchasers could not; yet, the &quot;parens patriae&quot; provision in HSR is directed at vindicating the right of those very victims. To some extent, however, this effect was mitigated by the availability of state law and congressional passage of the Class Action Fairness Act of 2005 (CAFA), under which class actions can be removed from state court to federal court but state &quot;parens patriae&quot; actions cannot. Consequently, state attorneys general can pursue price-fixing cases on behalf of the state&#x27;s consumers under state law in state courts.

==Effectiveness==
Peter Rodino commented in 2002 on the 25th anniversary of the legislation, &quot;the legislation absolutely has transformed merger enforcement. Competition, as well as the consumer, has benefitted.&quot; The Federal Trade Commission&#x27;s Deputy Director stated that implementation of the Act &quot;has been instrumental in detecting transactions that have been the subject of numerous enforcement actions and [it] continues to do its job well&quot;.

<text>The Flag of Peru (), often referred to as The Bicolour (), was adopted by the government of Peru in 1825, and modified in 1950. According to the article 49 of the Constitution of Peru, it is a vertical triband with red outer bands and a single white middle band. Depending on its use, it may be defaced with different emblems, and has different names. Flag day in Peru is celebrated on 7 June, the anniversary of the Battle of Arica.

==Design and symbolism==

===Coat of arms===
===Meaning of the colors===
Red represents the blood that was spilled by the fallen freedom fighters that fought for the independence of the country. White represents purity and peace. However, the colours are also linked to the Chilean flamingo, or &quot;parihuana&quot;, a red and white type of flamingo that General San Martín dreamed about during the revolution.

===Color approximations===
The current colors of the Peruvian flag were taken of the design of San Martín and Torre Tagle. The reasons why red and white were chosen are unknown.

Official tones determined by Peruvian laws do not exist. However, there are some particular initiatives in approximated equivalents in multiple color models, some in tones close to crimson.

At official level, the governmental communications have used diverse shades of red.

==Variants==
===Civil flag===
The civil flag or ensign () is used by citizens. It has no additions to the common form. It was changed several times; before 1950 it looked like the current national flag and was used as both the civil and the state flag, when General removed the coat of arms from the flag and created the state and war flags. The Civil flag lacks coat of arms.

===State flag===
The state flag (), used by state institutions, is marked with the National shield (). It is used during ceremonies in which the National Flag is hoisted in the presence of spectators (as opposed to a static, permanent flag). A form of this flag, the national standard () is used indoors by official and private institutions. It is used for the Government Palace, the United Nations, etc.

===War flag===
The war flag (), similar to the state flag, is marked with the Coat of Arms (). It is flown by the Peruvian military and national police and is typically inscribed with the service, name and number of the unit flying it.

===Naval jack===
The naval jack () is not based on the triband. It is a square flag, consisting of a white square with the coat of arms () on a red field. It is used on warships, usually with the ensign of the highest-ranking officer on board above it.

==History==
=== Proposed flag of 1820 ===

During the Viceroyalty of Peru, the colonial-era Spanish flag flew over Peru. In 1820, during the struggle for independence, British-born General William Miller hoisted in Tacna the first flag that represented the emerging country. Though the original flag itself is now lost, it was described as navy blue with a golden sun in the center representing Inti.
=== Flag of 1820 ===

The first flag of the Republic of Peru was created by General José de San Martín, and officially decreed on 21 October 1820. It is diagonally quartered, with white upper and lower fields, and the others red. The flag was defaced with an oval-shaped laurel crown in the center, surrounding a sun rising behind mountains by the sea. The symbolism of the flag&#x27;s colors is uncertain, but according to Peruvian author Abraham Valdelomar, San Martín, having arrived on the coast of southern Pisco, was inspired by the colors of &quot;parihuanas&quot;, red-and-white flamingos. Historians of the early Peruvian Republic, such as Leguía y Martínez and Pareja Paz Soldán, give a different explanation, suggesting that San Martín took the red from the flag of Chile and the white from the flag of Argentina, recognizing the provenance of the men of the liberation army. Historian Jorge Fernández Stoll thinks in 1820 San Martin was in favor of a constitutional monarchy, and he chose to use monarchical symbols and colors: Castile used the red and white colors for many years, the old flag of the viceroyalty the cross of Burgundy was red and white and the flag&#x27;s diagonal lines mimicked the cross shape, the red color was the royal symbol of the mascaipacha of Inca kings and of the ensign of the Spanish king at that time. The flag proved difficult to adopt due to its complex construction; without standardized measurements in place at the time, a triangular flag proved difficult to build.

=== Flag of March 1822 ===

In March 1822, José Bernardo de Tagle, Marquis of Torre Tagle and Supreme Delegate of the Republic, who replaced San Martín provisionally when the latter traveled to Guayaquil, decreed a new design for the flag. This consisted of a horizontal triband, with a white band between two red ones, and a golden Inti at the center, similar to the flag of Argentina. This modification was justified, according to Torre Tagle, by the inconvenience in the construction of the previous version, among other issues.

A problem came up on the battlefields: the resemblance with the Spanish flag, especially from far away, made the distinction between the armies difficult, which led to a new change to the flag.

=== Flag of May 1822 ===

On 31 May 1822, Torre Tagle changed the flag&#x27;s design again. The new version was a vertical triband, with red outer bands and a white middle band, with a golden sun representing Inti at the center.
=== Flag of 1825 ===

On 25 February 1825, during Simón Bolívar&#x27;s administration, the Constituent Congress changed the design of the flag by promulgating the law of national symbols. The fundamental change was the image of the sun for the brand new coat of arms, designed by José Gregorio Paredes and Francisco Javier Cortés.

In this way, the flag was definitely constituted by two vertical bands of red at the ends and white at the center, with the coat of arms at the center of the middle band.
=== Flags of the Peru-Bolivian Confederation era, 1836–1839 ===

From 1836 to 1839, Peru was temporarily dissolved into the Republics of South Peru and North Peru, which joined Bolivia to form the Peru–Bolivian Confederation.

The South was formed first, thus adopting a new flag: a red vertical band on the left, with a golden sun and four small stars above (representing Arequipa, Ayacucho, Cuzco and Puno, the four groups of the republic), and the right side divided into an upper green band and a lower white one. The North kept the currency and all of the dissolved Peru, including its flag.

The flag of the Peru-Bolivian Confederation showed the coats of arms of Bolivia, South and North Peru, from left to right and slanted at different angles, on a red field, adorned by a laurel crown. Another version of the flag of the confederacy is offered by Flags of the World.

After the dissolution of the Confederation, the old Republic of Peru was restored to its 1836 composition, as were its national symbols.
=== Flag of 1884 ===

After the War of the Pacific, the coat of arms in the flag was slightly altered to represent the territory lost after the Treaty of Ancón.

=== Flag of 1950 ===
In 1950, President Odría modified the national flag to its current form, removing the coat of arms from the civil flag, since it was used &quot;de facto&quot;, being easier to make. The national ensign and war flag were created for exclusive uses, each with a variant of the coat of arms, which was also changed slightly. These remain as the official flags today.
==The &quot;Marcha de Banderas&quot;==
The &quot;Marcha de Banderas&quot; (Spanish: March of Flags) is a military march sung during the flag raising. It was created in 1897 by SM Jose Sabas Libornio Ibarra who said President Nicolás de Piérola, he disagreed with the indiscriminate interpretation of the National Anthem at all official events that were derived from civic events. In December of that year was officially recognized to be executed in any official act.

In all occasions today the song is sung in its entirety, formerly during the presidency of Alan Garcia only the first 3 were sung.

<doc id="459297" wikidata="Q235846" url="?curid=459297" title="Flag and coat of arms of the Pitcairn Islands">
<text>The coat of arms of the Pitcairn Islands is an official emblem of the British Overseas Territory of the Pitcairn Islands and was granted by royal warrant on 4 November 1969. The flag of the Pitcairn Islands, also an official emblem, consists of a Blue Ensign displaying the coat of arms and was granted on 2 April 1984.

== Coat of arms ==
The coat of arms features several symbols relevant to the ancestral history and culture of the Pitcairn Islanders, most of whom are descended from the sailors who mutinied on in 1789: the blue, yellow and green of the shield symbolise the island of Pitcairn rising from the Pacific Ocean, while the anchor and Bible are symbols of the &quot;Bounty&quot;. Additionally, the Bible symbolises Christianity, which the mutineers brought to the island. The shield is surrounded by a green and gold wreath, and crested by a helmet bearing a wheelbarrow and a slip of milo, a local tree, which represent the role agriculture played in helping the mutineers survive on the island. The slip of miro also represents the wood used by Pitcairn Islanders for crafting souvenirs.

== Flag ==
The Pitcairn flag features a Blue Ensign with the Pitcairn coat of arms defaced on the fly. The design was suggested by the Island Council in December 1980 and approved on 2 April 1984. It was first flown in May 1984, during a visit by the then-governor Sir Richard Stratton.

<doc id="459298" wikidata="Q211579" url="?curid=459298" title="Flag of Saint Helena">
<text>The flag of Saint Helena consists of a Blue Ensign defaced with the shield from the British overseas territory&#x27;s coat of arms. Adopted in 1984 shortly after the island was granted a new coat of arms, it has been the flag since. Saint Helena&#x27;s flag is similar to the flags of eight other British Overseas Territories, which are also Blue Ensigns with their respective coats of arms.

==History==
Saint Helena was first sighted by João da Nova in May 1502. The East India Company (EIC) was later conferred a royal charter to govern the island in 1659. It briefly came under Dutch sovereignty in 1673, before becoming a crown colony for the duration of Napoleon&#x27;s exile there from 1815 until his death in 1821. After reverting back to EIC control for thirteen years, it became a crown possession again in 1834.


Saint Helena was accorded its own badge in 1874 that was eventually utilised on its flag. This consisted of a depiction of the territory&#x27;s rocky coastline and an East Indiaman. The badge was later redesigned in 1984, with the Saint Helena plover added to the upper portion. Although this change was publicised in the island&#x27;s government gazette in January of that year, authorisation was only granted by the Admiralty a decade later in 1994.

The territory&#x27;s flag was also utilised as the official flag of Tristan da Cunha, as well as on Ascension Island in an unofficial capacity. This continued until the two islands adopted their own distinct flags in 2002 and 2013, respectively. Minor updates were made to the shield (and, by extension, the flag of Saint Helena) in April 2019, amid concerns that the illustration of the wirebird had become misrepresented. The island&#x27;s government consequently invited the College of Arms in London to create an up-to-date painting of the coat of arms that could be digitally generated while remaining faithful to the colors prescribed in the 1984 Gazette. Two years later, the territory&#x27;s flag was hoisted at New Palace Yard in the Palace of Westminster on 21 May 2021, a public holiday on the island that honours the feast day of Helena of Constantinople. It was part of an effort by Lindsay Hoyle, the Speaker of the House of Commons at the time, to observe the ceremonial days of overseas territories.

==Design==
===Symbolism===
The colours and symbols of the flag carry cultural, political, and regional meanings. The bird on the yellow field is a Saint Helena plover that epitomises the fauna of the territory. Popularly referred to by Saint Helenians as the wirebird, it is the last species of bird that is endemic to the island, and is the official bird of Saint Helena. The Cross of Saint George flown from the three-masted sailing ship is a conspicuous symbol of the Kingdom of England, Saint Helena&#x27;s mother country.

===Similarities===
The Blue Ensign is also used on the flags of eight of the thirteen other British Overseas Territories, with their coats of arms in the fly being the lone distinguishing feature between them. These are, specifically, the flags of Anguilla, the British Virgin Islands, the Cayman Islands, the Falkland Islands, Montserrat, the Pitcairn Islands, South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands, and the Turks and Caicos Islands.

==Variants==
The standard of the territory&#x27;s governor features the Union Jack defaced with the territorial coat of arms at the centre. Ships registered in Saint Helena fly the Red Ensign, since there is no defaced variant for the island.

<text>The national flag of Rwanda is a horizontal tricolour of light blue, yellow, and green, in a 2:1:1 ratio, charged with a golden sun in the upper fly-side corner. It was adopted on 31 December 2001 and replaced the flag adopted shortly before independence. The design of the flag is defined in the Rwandan constitution and regulations regarding the use and manufacture of the flag are outlined in the country&#x27;s national flag law (law no. 34/2008, and subsequent amendments).

Rwanda adopted a vertical tricolour of red, yellow, and green following the coup of Gitarama on 28 January 1961, which saw the abolition of the Tutsi-dominated monarchy and the establishment of a Hutu-dominated republic. A black &quot;R&quot; was later added to the flag&#x27;s centre in September 1961. The government of the Tutsi-led Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF), which in 1994 overthrew the Hutu-led government and ended the Rwandan genocide, announced in 1999 its intention to change the national flag, arguing that the existing flag had become associated with the genocide. Critics viewed the move as an attempt by the RPF to symbolically assert its rule.

== Design and symbolism ==
Rwandan artist and engineer Alphonse Kirimobenecyo designed the flag, which depicts the sun illuminating Rwanda&#x27;s abundant vegetation. As a symbol, the sun represents national unity and transparency, and the enlightenment of the Rwandan people.

The design is described in Chapter II, Article 9 of the Constitution of Rwanda, 2003 (2015 revision). It states:

=== Construction ===
The government of Rwanda has specified dimensions, colours, and manufacturing parameters in which the flag is to be made. The flag consists of three horizontal stripes of blue, yellow, and green, from top to bottom. The blue stripe covers half the flag and is twice the height of the yellow and green stripes, which are equal in size. The upper fly-side (top right) corner features a golden sun with 24 rays that do not touch the sun&#x27;s circumference. The width-to-length ratio of the flag is 2:3. Rwandan law no. 34/2008 gives specific dimensions for large flags outside or inside government buildings, large flags at national ceremonies, small flags inside government offices or on government vehicles, and flags on medals. Physical flags should be made of 100% polyester and sewn in such a way that the threads connecting the stripes are not visible.

==== Dimensions ====
Large flags flown outside government buildings should measure and have no strands; flags flown indoors may have strands. The diameter of the sun should be or with its rays. The space between the tip of the uppermost ray and the top limit of the flag should be , and the space between the tip of the rightmost ray and the fly side limit of the flag should be . The hoist side should have rings to hoist the flag and a yellow ribbon affixed to it that matches the yellow on the flag.

Large flags flown at national ceremonies should be presented in the same way as the flags flown outside government buildings, but their dimensions differ. Such flags should measure . The diameter of the sun should be or with its rays. The space between the tip of the uppermost ray and the top limit of the flag should be , and the space between the tip of the rightmost ray and the fly side limit of the flag should be .

Small flags flown inside government offices or on government vehicles should measure . The diameter of the sun should be or with its rays. The space between the tip of the uppermost ray and the top limit of the flag should be , and the space between the tip of the rightmost ray and the fly side limit of the flag should be .

The flag may be placed on a medal, but its dimensions must not exceed .

==== Colours ====
Rwandan law no. 34/2008 specifies the particular shades of the flag&#x27;s colours and gives them symbolic significance. Rwandan flags should comply with the following colour codes: blue, Pantone 299 C 2x; green, RAL 6029; yellow, RAL 1023; and golden yellow, RAL 1003. Blue represents happiness and peace, yellow represents economic development, and green represents hope for prosperity.

== Protocol ==

=== Display and handling ===
The government of Rwanda has outlined regulations regarding the display and handling of the national flag. Large flags should be flown outside government buildings and during national ceremonies but lowered once the ceremonies have concluded. They may also be flown by &quot;private buildings and legally recognised associations&#x27; buildings&quot; with government approval. When raised in front of buildings, the flag raiser should have their back against the front of the building. Flags raised in an official capacity should not be lowered unless they are torn, dirty, or old. Small flags should be displayed inside the offices and on the vehicles of top officials such as the president, other officials determined by a presidential order, and Rwandan representatives abroad.

The national flag is held by officials when they are being sworn into office, and by couples when they are being legally married. The flag should be held by one&#x27;s left hand while their right hand is raised with a stretched palm. Those who are unable to do so due to disability wear the flag instead. The national flag may also be used to cover the coffin of a deceased person upon the president&#x27;s order; nothing may be placed on top of the flag and the flag must not touch the ground.

The national flag takes precedent over other flags of the state. During a parade, it should be flown at the front of the procession.

==== Half-mast ====
The national flag must be lowered to half-mast during periods of national mourning and when ordered by the president. The flag may only be lowered to half-mast after it has first been raised to the end of the flagpole. The flag flies at half-mast during the first week of commemoration of the Rwandan genocide, observed annually from 7 to 13 April, as a sign of national mourning and remembrance. Foreign delegations and organisations in the country are encouraged to do the same to their national flags during this period as a sign of solidarity. When a foreign head of a diplomatic mission dies, the Rwandan national flag is lowered to half-mast at the headquarters of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation and Kigali International Airport.

=== Prohibition of use and desecration ===
Disrespecting, denigrating or damaging the national flag carries a sentence of 6 to 12 months in prison, a fine of 50,000 to 100,000 Rwandan francs, or both. A flag that is not the national flag must not be claimed as such; those found guilty of deliberately doing so face a sentence of 1 to 2 years in prison, a fine of 500,000 to 1,000,000 francs, or both. Any other deliberate misuse of the flag, such as the use of incorrect colours, is punishable by 1 to 6 months in prison, a fine of 500,000 to 1,000,000 francs, or both.

== History ==

=== Colonial era ===
The Kingdom of Rwanda became a part of German East Africa after the Berlin Conference of 1884–1885. This change in relationship between the Germans and Rwandans was symbolised by the former&#x27;s presentation of the Reichsflagge and a letter of protection to Yuhi V of Rwanda. German East Africa was divided among the Allies following their victory over Germany in World War I. Initial postwar negotiations in 1919 awarded the United Kingdom the entirety of the former German colony as a League of Nations mandate, but the Belgians convinced the British to cede to them the kingdoms of Rwanda and Burundi. The Belgian mandate, and later UN trust territory, of Ruanda-Urundi was subsequently established later that year and confirmed by the League of Nations in 1922. The Belgian flag flew in Rwanda from then onwards, until the end of Belgian rule on 1 July 1962.

=== 1961–2001 flag ===
The coup of Gitarama on 28 January 1961 and subsequent referendum on the monarchy on 25 September saw the abolition of the Tutsi-dominated kingdom and the establishment of a Hutu-dominated republic. The coup occurred amid the wider Rwandan Revolution, a period of social change and ethnic violence between the Tutsi minority and Hutu majority. Grégoire Kayibanda, the Prime Minister of the Provisional Government, proclaimed a new national flag: a vertical tricolour of red, yellow, and green. The design was identical to that of the flag of Guinea; a black &quot;R&quot; was consequently added to the centre in late September 1961 to distinguish it. The flag was retained upon Rwanda&#x27;s independence from Belgium on 1 July 1962.

The colours of the flag held the following significance: red represented the blood shed for liberation, yellow represented peace and tranquillity, green represented hope and optimism, and black represented gloom and mourning. The &quot;R&quot; stood for Rwanda, revolution, and referendum.

=== Adoption of the current flag ===
The national flag was not immediately changed after the Tutsi-led Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) overthrew the Hutu-led government of Rwanda in 1994, which ended the Rwandan genocide. In 1999, the new RPF-dominated government announced it would change the national flag, ostensibly because of the existing flag&#x27;s association with the Rwandan genocide and Hutu supremacy. A nationwide contest was held to determine the new flag&#x27;s design, and a submission by Rwandan artist and engineer Alphonse Kirimobenecyo was ultimately selected. The new national flag was adopted along with a new national anthem on 31 December 2001. Kirimobenecyo intended for his design to be a symbol of unity, patriotism, and hope. However, a number of Rwandans interviewed by American anthropologist Jennie E. Burnet before the flag&#x27;s adoption expressed doubts about the government&#x27;s official explanation for the change and viewed the move as an attempt by the RPF to assert its political power.

<doc id="459300" wikidata="Q181120" url="?curid=459300" title="Flag of Saint Kitts and Nevis">
<text>The national flag of Saint Kitts and Nevis consists of a yellow-edged black band containing two white stars that divides diagonally from the lower hoist-side corner, with a green upper triangle and red lower triangle. Adopted in 1983 to replace the flag of Saint Christopher-Nevis-Anguilla, it has been the flag of the Federation of Saint Kitts and Nevis since the country gained independence that year. Although the flag utilises the colours of the Pan-Africanist movement, the symbolism behind them is interpreted differently.

The islands of Anguilla, Nevis, and Saint Christopher formed a province of the West Indies Federation in 1958. After the federation dissolved four years later, they were granted the status of associate state as Saint Christopher-Nevis-Anguilla. However, Anguilla decided to secede from the federation in 1969, owing to fears that their population, which was already small, would be further marginalised in parliament. This was eventually formalised in 1980, and a new flag for the remaining parts of the federation was needed, since the symbolism of the previous flag centred on the concept of a union of three.

A national competition was held in the early 1980s to choose a new flag. The winning design by student Edrice Lewis was one of 258 entries. It was first hoisted one minute after midnight on 19 September 1983, the day Saint Kitts and Nevis became an independent country.

==Design==
===Symbolism===
While the flag&#x27;s design greatly resembles that of Tanzania, its colours and symbols carry cultural, political, and regional meanings. The green alludes to the country&#x27;s fertile land, while the red evokes the fight against slavery and colonialism. The yellow stripes represent the sunshine the islands enjoy all year round, and the black epitomises the people&#x27;s African origins. The two stars on the black band symbolise the two islands as well as hope and liberty. The official meaning behind the flag&#x27;s symbols was formulated by Edrice Lewis, the same person who designed the flag.

==Historical flags==
==Flag of Nevis==

The flag of Nevis island incorporates the flag of the Federation of Saint Kitts and Nevis in the top left corner.

The golden field stands for sunshine. The central triangle represents the conical shape of Nevis, with the blue being the ocean; the green being the verdant slopes of the island; and the white being the clouds that usually wreathe Nevis Peak.

<doc id="459301" wikidata="Q184596" url="?curid=459301" title="Flag of Saint Lucia">
<text>The national flag of Saint Lucia consists of a cerulean blue field charged with a golden triangle in front of a white-edged black isosceles triangle. Adopted in 1967 to replace the British Blue Ensign defaced with the arms of the colony, it has been the flag of Saint Lucia since the country became an associated state of the United Kingdom that year. Although the overall design of the flag has remained unchanged, specific aspects of it have been altered over the years.

==History==
The French colonised Saint Lucia in 1635 and subsequently signed a treaty with the local indigenous population 25 years later in 1660. However, the British vied for control with the French, and the island frequently switched hands between the two powers. This continued until 1814, when the Treaty of Paris was signed that saw France permanently relinquish Saint Lucia to the British, and it became a crown colony of the United Kingdom within its colonial empire in that same year. During this colonial period of French and British rule, Saint Lucia did not have its own unique colonial flag.

The British finally granted Saint Lucia its own unique coat of arms in August 1939. The escutcheon consisted of a black shield featuring two sticks of bamboo forming a cross, with two Tudor roses symbolising England and two fleurs-de-lis symbolising France occupying the four quadrants. This emblem was utilised to deface the British Blue Ensign in order to form the territory&#x27;s flag.

The island became part of the West Indies Federation from 1958 to 1962. However, this political union turned out to be unsuccessful, and on 1 March 1967 – five years after the federation was dissolved – Saint Lucia became an Associated State. This gave the territory full control over domestic matters, while Britain retained responsibility for the island&#x27;s foreign affairs and defence. The territory&#x27;s new flag, which was designed by native Saint Lucian artist Dunstan St Omer, was adopted on that same day. When Saint Lucia became an independent country on 22 February 1979, the overall design of the flag from twelve years before remained unchanged, but the blue colour&#x27;s shade and the triangles&#x27; sizes were modified marginally. Despite the fact that the island already had its own distinct flag by the time it became a sovereign state, the Union Jack was still lowered for the final time at the official ceremony marking independence.

==Design==

The colours and symbols of the flag carry cultural, political, and regional meanings. The blue epitomises the sky and the sea, specifically the Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea which encircle the country. The black and white allude to the harmonious relationship between the black and white races. The yellow symbolises the sunshine, as well as prosperity. The triangles represent the Pitons, which are twin volcanic cones located in the southwest part of the island and unity; Gros Piton and Petit Piton are a national symbol of Saint Lucia.

<doc id="459303" wikidata="Q184584" url="?curid=459303" title="Flag of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines">
<text>The flag of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines is a Canadian pale triband consisting of blue, gold, and green bands charged with three green diamonds at the middle. Adopted in 1985 to replace a similar design used from the time of independence, it has been the flag of Saint Vincent since that year. The design of the present flag entailed substituting the country&#x27;s coat of arms on a breadfruit leaf with the diamonds. They are a reference to both the letter &quot;V&quot;, which is the first letter of the country&#x27;s name, and its nickname as the &quot;Gems of the Antilles&quot; and &quot;Jewels of the Caribbean&quot;. Accordingly, the flag itself has been given the moniker of &quot;The Gems&quot;.

==History==
Sovereignty over Saint Vincent switched hands between the French and the British throughout the 18th century. This continued until 1783, when the Peace of Paris saw France permanently relinquish the island to the United Kingdom, and Saint Vincent eventually became a crown colony within the latter&#x27;s colonial empire. During this period, it utilised a British Blue Ensign defaced with the territory&#x27;s coat of arms as its flag. The shield initially consisted of two brunette raven-haired ladies, one clutching a palm branch on the left and one with clasped hands kneeling before an altar on the right. This design was revised in 1907, with the women&#x27;s hair colour changed to blond and the clasped hands becoming an eye. The island subsequently joined the West Indies Federation in 1958 and remained part of this political union until 1962. On 27 October 1969, seven years after the federation was dissolved, Saint Vincent became an Associated State, and adopted the aforementioned blue ensign as its official flag.

When Saint Vincent became an independent country on 27 October 1979, a flag designed by native Saint Vincentian Elaine Liverpool was chosen to be the national flag. This consisted of a triband of blue, gold, and green separated by two thin white fimbriations, and the centre band charged with the country&#x27;s coat of arms on a breadfruit leaf, which had been introduced to the island by William Bligh. However, this design soon proved to be convoluted and costly to manufacture, with the breadfruit leaf hard to recognise from afar. After the New Democratic Party emerged victorious in the 1984 elections, new prime minister James Fitz-Allen Mitchell sought to have the flag redesigned. A nationwide contest was held, but it resulted in an impasse after no entry was deemed suitable. Consequently, Julien van der Wal – a graphic artist from Switzerland who also designed the flag of the Canton of Geneva and pictograms for the Olympic Games – was tasked with modifying the flag. He was instructed to &quot;modernise the original flag, keeping the same colours and respecting the symbolism&quot;. In the meantime, the white fimbriations were removed from the soon-to-be disused design in March 1985.

Van der Wal&#x27;s design saw the arms and breadfruit leaf substituted for three diamonds grouped together in a &quot;V&quot; shape. Notwithstanding these changes, the meaning behind the colours remained the same. The new flag was formally adopted by the government on 12 October 1985. There is some discrepancy over when it was first hoisted officially. The islands&#x27; national newspaper, &quot;The Vincentian&quot;, maintains this took place during a ceremony at the War Memorial in the capital Kingstown on 21 October. On the other hand, Whitney Smith in the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; states that it was first raised one day later (22 October). The flag – which has been occasionally dubbed &quot;The Gems&quot; – is utilised &quot;for all purposes&quot;, with no distinction made between civil, state, and naval ensigns.

==Design==

===Symbolism===
The colours and symbols of the flag carry cultural, political, and regional meanings. The blue epitomises the sky and the sea, while the gold represents the colour of the islands&#x27; sand, the sunshine, and the &quot;bright spirit&quot; of the islanders. The green symbolises the country&#x27;s plentiful vegetation, as well as the vitality of Vincentians. The three diamonds evoke the nicknames of Saint Vincent as the &quot;Gems of the Antilles&quot; and the &quot;Jewels of the Caribbean&quot;. Their arrangement in the shape of the letter V is a subtle allusion to the first letter in &quot;Vincent&quot;, while its placement on the marginally lower part of the centre band indicates the geographical positioning of the islands within the Antilles.

==Legal issues==
The Saint Vincentian flag is utilised as a flag of convenience by foreign merchant vessels. The government permits this in order to increase revenue for the country, and it offers many advantages for these ships, such as less expensive fees and lax rules regarding crew, safety, and the environment. However, the lack of regulation on such vessels has led to concerns over illegal and suspicious activity like money laundering. Two ships flying the flag of Saint Vincent were found by the European Commission (EC) to have been on the blacklist of the Regional Fisheries Management Organisations.

As a result, this practice has attracted criticism from opposition parties as well as international organisations, most notably the EC. The EC identified Saint Vincent and the Grenadines as a non-cooperating country in fighting illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing (IUU) on May 23, 2020, having warned them earlier through pre-identification in December 2014. By listing the country as non-cooperating, it meant that all fisheries products from Saint Vincent could no longer be legally imported into the European Union. This has negligible impact on the country, because Saint Vincent does not export fisheries products to EU member states.

<doc id="459304" wikidata="Q199896" url="?curid=459304" title="Karl Malone">
<text>Karl Anthony Malone (born July 24, 1963) is an American former professional basketball player in the National Basketball Association (NBA). Nicknamed &quot;the Mailman&quot;, he is considered one of the greatest power forwards in NBA history. Malone spent his first 18 seasons (1985–2003) in the NBA with the Utah Jazz and formed a formidable duo with his teammate John Stockton. He was a two-time NBA Most Valuable Player, a 14-time NBA All-Star, and a 14-time member of the All-NBA Team, which include 11 consecutive First Team selection. His 36,928 career points scored rank third all-time in NBA history behind LeBron James and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, and he holds the records for most free throws made and attempted, and most regular season games started, in addition to being tied for the second-most first-team All-NBA selections with Kobe Bryant, both behind LeBron James.

Malone played college basketball at Louisiana Tech University. In his three seasons with Louisiana Tech, he helped the Bulldogs basketball team to its first-ever NCAA tournament in 1984 and to first place in the Southland Conference in 1985. The Utah Jazz selected him in the first round of the 1985 NBA draft with the 13th overall pick. Malone appeared in the playoffs every season in his career, including the NBA Finals in 1997 and 1998 with the Jazz. He played his final season with the Los Angeles Lakers, with whom he played his third Finals in 2004. Malone also competed with the United States national team in the Summer Olympic Games of 1992 and 1996; in both years he won gold medals. In 1996, as part of the NBA&#x27;s 50th Anniversary, Malone was honored as one of the 50 greatest players of all time by being named to the NBA 50th Anniversary Team. In October 2021, Malone was again honored as one of the league&#x27;s greatest players of all time by being named to the NBA 75th Anniversary Team.

After retiring from the NBA, Malone joined the staff of the Louisiana Tech Bulldogs basketball team in 2007 and was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 2010 twice – for his individual career, and as a member of the 1992 United States men&#x27;s Olympic basketball team.

Outside of basketball, Malone has attracted criticism for his personal life, most notably for his impregnation of a 13-year-old when he was 20.

==Early life and college==
Born in Summerfield, Louisiana, Malone was the youngest of nine children and was raised on a farm by his single mother, Shirley. Shedrick Hay, his father, was married to a different woman and raising a family with her. Shedrick committed suicide when Karl was 14, though Malone didn&#x27;t disclose the suicide until 1994. As a child, Malone often worked on the farm, chopped trees, hunted, and fished. He attended Summerfield High School and led his basketball team to three consecutive Louisiana Class C titles from 1979 to his senior season in 1981.

Although recruited by University of Arkansas basketball coach Eddie Sutton, Malone enrolled at Louisiana Tech University, which was closer to home. He joined the Louisiana Tech Bulldogs basketball team in his second year because his grades were too low for freshman eligibility; Malone played under coach Andy Russo. In his second season with Louisiana Tech (1983–84), Malone averaged 18.7 points and 9.3 rebounds per game. Louisiana Tech finished the 1984–85 season 29–3, at the top of the Southland Conference, and advanced to the NCAA tournament for the first time in school history; the team finished at the Sweet 16 round. In each of his three seasons with the Louisiana Tech Bulldogs, Malone was an All-Southland selection.

==Professional career==

=== Utah Jazz (1985–2003) ===

====Early years (1985–1987)====
In the 1985 NBA draft, the Utah Jazz selected Karl Malone with the 13th overall pick. According to Malone&#x27;s official NBA biography: &quot;If professional scouts had correctly predicted the impact Karl Malone would have on the NBA, Malone would have been picked much higher than 13th in the 1985 NBA Draft.&quot; In fact, Malone was so convinced the Dallas Mavericks were going to select him with the eighth choice that he had already rented an apartment in Dallas. Instead, the Mavericks selected Detlef Schrempf. Under head coach Frank Layden, Malone averaged 14.9 points and 8.9 rebounds in his first season and made the 1986 NBA All-Rookie Team after coming in third for Rookie of the Year votes. On January 14, 1986, the Jazz beat the Houston Rockets 105–102 to snap the Rockets&#x27; 20-game winning streak at home. Malone scored 29 points in that game, including four free throws followed by a three-pointer by Pace Mannion to rally from a 96–89 deficit with 5 minutes and 36 seconds remaining to a 96–96 tie. For the third consecutive season, the Jazz made the postseason but lost the first round of the 1986 playoffs to the Dallas Mavericks. In the four playoff games, Malone improved in his scoring with a 20 points per game average but was still subpar in shooting (49.6% field goals) and rebounds (8.9). After his second season, Malone became the Jazz&#x27;s leader in average scoring (21.7 points) and rebounding (10.4 rebounds); in 24 of 29 games between February 1 and April 3, 1987, he was the leading scorer of the game.

====All-Star and team offense leader (1987–1996)====
By the 1987–88 season, Malone was the foundation of the offense and John Stockton was the floor general. Malone made his first All-Star Game in 1988 on the strength of 27.1 points per game, and made his first All-NBA team at the end of the season. This was the first of 14 consecutive All-Star appearances for Malone. In the 1988 NBA All-Star Game, Malone led the Western Conference All-Star team with 22 points. The Jazz finished 47–35, third place in the Midwest Division, and defeated the Portland Trail Blazers in the first round. In the next round, the defending champions Los Angeles Lakers, led by perennial All-Stars Magic Johnson, James Worthy, and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, defeated the Jazz in seven games. In the seventh game of the series, Malone scored 31 points and had 15 rebounds, but the Lakers beat the Jazz 109–98 and eventually won the 1988 NBA Finals. In 11 playoff games in 1988, Malone averaged 29.7 points and 11.8 rebounds.
Malone signed a 10-year contract during the 1988 offseason worth $18 million. In December 1988, Jerry Sloan succeeded Layden as head coach as Layden became team president. Malone averaged 29.1 points in , good for second in the NBA behind Michael Jordan, and 10.7 rebounds, which was fifth in the league. This scoring average was Malone&#x27;s highest so far in his career. At the 1989 NBA All-Star Game, Malone finished with 28 points, 9 rebounds and 3 assists en route to his first NBA All-Star MVP. The Jazz finished 51–31, but were swept in three games in the first round by the Golden State Warriors. This season marked Malone&#x27;s first with the All-NBA First Team honor.

During the , Malone increased his scoring to 31 points and his rebounding to 11.1 a game and again was selected to the All-NBA First Team. In the first game of the season, Malone recorded 40 points, 16 rebounds and 5 assists in a 122–113 win over the Denver Nuggets. On December 5, 1989, Malone scored 21 points and grabbed 19 rebounds in a 94–80 win over the home team, Cleveland Cavaliers. Seventeen days later, Malone recorded 52 points and 17 rebounds in a 114–100 road win over the Charlotte Hornets. On January 27, 1990, Malone scored a career-high 61 points in a 144–96 victory against the Milwaukee Bucks. He made 21 of 26 field goals and 19 of 23 free throws. It was the most points scored by a Jazz player since the team moved to Utah from New Orleans. Although Malone was voted to the NBA All-Star Game for the third consecutive season, because of an ankle injury he sat out the game. He led the team in scoring in 24 of the last 26 games of the season; on March 29, 1990, against the Golden State Warriors, Malone scored 49 points, and on April 12 against the Lakers he scored 45. The Jazz, finishing the season 55–27, lost to the Phoenix Suns within five games in the first round of the playoffs, in which Malone averaged 25.2 points and 10.2 rebounds. For the second straight season, Malone finished second in the league in points per game behind Michael Jordan.

From January 19 to March 4, 1991, Malone led the Jazz in scoring for 19 straight games; after starting the season 7–8 the team went 21–9 in January and February 1991. Malone scored 16 points and took 11 rebounds in the 1991 NBA All-Star Game, his fourth consecutive All-Star appearance for the West, and averaged 29.0 points and 11.8 rebounds each regular-season game. He was among four Jazz players with double-figure scoring averages, the others being the newly acquired Jeff Malone (no relation) as well as John Stockton and Thurl Bailey. In four games, the Jazz eliminated the Phoenix Suns in the first round of the 1991 playoffs but lost to the Portland Trail Blazers in the second round. Malone made the All-NBA First Team for the third consecutive season.

As he had done in 1989–90, Malone finished the 1991–92 season second in the league in scoring, averaging 28.0 points per game. He made the All-NBA First Team for the fourth straight year. It was also a breakout season for the Jazz; during the 1992 NBA Playoffs, the team made the Western Conference Finals for the first time in franchise history. Malone scored 40 or more points in five games this season. Despite his continued success and achievements, Malone encountered trouble for committing a flagrant foul. On December 14, 1991, when the Jazz played against the Detroit Pistons, Malone elbowed the Pistons&#x27; Isiah Thomas on the forehead. Thomas needed 40 stitches over his eye, and the NBA suspended Malone for the next game without pay and fined him $10,000. In its first-ever franchise Western Conference Finals appearance, in six games the Jazz lost in the playoffs for the second straight season to the Portland Trail Blazers. Malone averaged 29.1 points on 52.1% shooting and 11.9 rebounds in the 1992 playoffs.

Throughout the 1990s, Malone put up stellar numbers: in , he averaged 27.0 points and 11.2 rebounds per game, 25.2 points and 11.5 rebounds in , 26.7 points and 10.6 rebounds in , and 25.7 points and 9.8 rebounds in . Following the 1992 Summer Olympics in which Malone helped the American national team, dubbed the &quot;Dream Team&quot;, win a gold medal, Malone expressed opposition to Magic Johnson, who had recently tested positive for HIV and retired from the NBA in 1991, making a comeback to the league. Malone&#x27;s point of view diverged from the support for Johnson from his Olympic and Los Angeles Lakers teammates, and the NBA implemented AIDS-related precautions after Johnson&#x27;s revelation. On February 4, 1993, in a game against the Lakers, Malone surpassed 16,000 career points. He and his teammate John Stockton shared the All-Star MVP award in 1993. In the West&#x27;s 135–132 overtime win, Malone scored 28 points and pulled in 10 rebounds.

Malone started all 82 games of 1993–94 and helped the Jazz make the Western Conference Finals for the second time in franchise history and his career. In his ninth season, Malone led the Jazz in scoring (25.2), rebounding (11.5), and blocked shots (126), made 49.7% of field goal attempts, and played 3,329 minutes, the second-most that season in the league behind Latrell Sprewell&#x27;s 3,533. On March 29, 1994, Malone recorded a career-high 23 rebounds, but the Jazz lost to the Golden State Warriors 116–113. However, Malone made only 8 of 29 field goals that night and commented post-game: &quot;My rebounds are not going to be tomorrow&#x27;s headline...Tomorrow&#x27;s headline is going to be all those easy shots I missed.&quot; The eventual NBA champion Houston Rockets eliminated the Jazz from the Western Conference Finals in five games. Although Malone scored 32 points in the Jazz&#x27; 104–99 Game 2 loss, along with Stockton&#x27;s 18, they and the Jazz were no match for the Rockets with high-scoring center Hakeem Olajuwon. Midway into the fourth quarter, Malone and Olajuwon scored on four consecutive possessions by their teams, leading up to a 93–93 tie.

For the first time in team history, in 1994–95, the Utah Jazz won 60 games. In addition, the team won 15 consecutive away games (the best such streak by the team, then the second-best streak in the league). Malone&#x27;s 26.7 points per game ranked fourth in the NBA, and Malone became the 19th NBA player to reach 20,000 career points on January 20, 1995. In the 1995 playoffs, the Jazz lost to the Houston Rockets for the second consecutive year, this time in the first round. The Rockets became NBA champions for the second straight season.

On January 13, 1996, Malone renewed his contract with the Jazz. The Jazz only made it as far as the Western Conference Finals in this period, losing to the Portland Trail Blazers (1992), the Houston Rockets (1994) and the Seattle SuperSonics (1996).

====Western Conference championship years (1996–1998)====

Malone returned from a gold medal winning-effort at the 1996 Summer Olympics leading the Jazz to two consecutive NBA Finals appearances. During the 1996–97 season, Malone put up a resurgent 27.4 points per game while leading the Jazz to a 64–18 record, the most regular-season wins in team history. Malone won his first NBA Most Valuable Player award, and the Jazz were the top team in the Western Conference and the playoff champions in that conference. After sweeping the Los Angeles Clippers and defeating the Los Angeles Lakers, the Jazz took on the Houston Rockets, led by the aging trio of Hakeem Olajuwon, Charles Barkley, and Clyde Drexler. The Jazz beat them in six games (the last victory coming on a last-second shot by Stockton). Malone finally reached the NBA Finals in 1997, where they played the Jordan-led Chicago Bulls. In a matchup of the two previous MVPs, the Bulls won the first two games at the United Center. Malone struggled from the field, going 6 of 20 for 20 points in Game 2. However, the Jazz won the next two games at the Delta Center behind Malone&#x27;s 37 points in Game 3 and 23 in Game 4, including a game-winning fastbreak lay-up off a spectacular assist by Stockton in the last minute. The Bulls won the next two games and the series, with Malone struggling from the foul line in Game 6.

The next season saw the Jazz once again dominate. Malone put up 27 points per game and just missed out on his second MVP award, losing to Jordan. Nevertheless, the Jazz posted a 62–20 record, which was the best in the NBA. The Jazz once again were seated at the top of the Western Conference, and in the 1998 playoffs they defeated the Rockets, Spurs, and Lakers via a sweep en route to their second consecutive Finals appearance. The rematch with the Chicago Bulls would start differently, as Malone put up 21 points and the Jazz won Game 1, 88–85. Malone found himself unable to put up consistently high numbers, due in large part to the swarming defense of defenders Dennis Rodman and Scottie Pippen. In Game 5 of the 1998 Finals, Malone led the Jazz in scoring with 39 points, and the Jazz beat the Bulls 83–81 in Chicago. Malone scored his 39 points on 17-for-27 shooting and also made 9 rebounds, 5 assists, and 1 turnover. Many of his shots were &quot;mid-range turnaround jumpers from the left side&quot;.

A sixth game of the Finals was held at the Delta Center in Salt Lake City, and by trailing the series 3–2 the team was one loss away from losing the series. Malone scored 31 points and made 11 rebounds. Although the Jazz held leads of 49–45 by halftime and 66–61 after the third quarter, the team squandered their lead in the fourth and would lose after Malone lost a pass in the post. With 18.9 seconds left in the fourth quarter and the Jazz leading 86–85, Bulls guard/forward Michael Jordan stole the ball just passed to Malone and with 5.2 seconds left made a jump shot that gave the Bulls an 87–86 lead. John Stockton missed a game-winning jump shot. Jordan&#x27;s shot has been dubbed the &quot;greatest shot&quot; of his career, and the Bulls&#x27; 1998 title was their third consecutive championship and sixth since 1991.

====Later seasons with Jazz (1998–2003)====
On November 12, 1998, during the lockout that shortened the 1998–99 season, Malone declared on his Los Angeles-based radio show that he would demand a trade from the Jazz after the end of the lockout, citing a lack of respect from the team owner Larry H. Miller and the Utah media, which he dubbed &quot;goons&quot;. A week later, Malone backed off on his trade demands, stating in an interview that he would still love to play for the Jazz with &quot;everything else being equal&quot;. The NBA regular season resumed in February and Malone won his second MVP award, with the Jazz going 37–13 during the 50-game regular season. They lost in the second round that year to the Trail Blazers, and for the next several years the Jazz fell out of title contention. The Jazz won Game 5 of the second-round 1999 round against the Blazers 88–71 to force a sixth game, and Malone scored 23 points. In that game, Malone elbowed the Blazers&#x27; Brian Grant, something he also did in Game 1 and for which he was fined $10,000. Despite the decline of his team and his advancing age, Malone averaged 25.5, 23.2, 22.4, and 20.6 points per game in his last four seasons with Utah. In the 2002–2003 season, Malone passed Wilt Chamberlain for second on the all-time scoring list with 36,374 points. He became a free agent in 2003, the year Stockton had retired. For the time Malone and Stockton played together on the Jazz (1985–2003), the two formed one of the most productive guard–forward combinations in NBA history. Playing coach Jerry Sloan&#x27;s scrappy and tough style and perfecting the pick and roll to a maximum degree of efficiency, the Jazz regularly made the playoffs with a winning record. Malone led the Jazz to multiple 50-win seasons with the exception of 1992–93 (47–35).

===Los Angeles Lakers (2003–2004)===

Malone played in the NBA for one more season, joining the Los Angeles Lakers in an attempt to win a championship. All-Star point guard Gary Payton also joined the Lakers in an attempt to win his first NBA championship, and with Malone, Payton, Shaquille O&#x27;Neal and Kobe Bryant, the Lakers were favorites to win the title. The Lakers rolled out to a dominant 18–3 start to the season, but on December 21, Malone suffered a knee injury against the Phoenix Suns that forced him to miss 39 games. Malone returned by the season&#x27;s end, as the Lakers entered the playoffs with 56 wins and the number 2 seed in the playoffs. In the first round against the Houston Rockets, Malone posted double-figure scoring in 4 games, including a 30-point and 13-rebound effort in the Lakers&#x27; game 4 victory. The Lakers advanced to face the San Antonio Spurs in the conference semifinals, where Malone played a critical role on defense against Tim Duncan, despite not scoring more than 13 points in any game during the series. The Lakers defeated the Spurs in 6 games in the conference semifinals before defeating the Minnesota Timberwolves in 6 games in the conference finals to advance to the NBA Finals. He scored 17 points on two occasions against Minnesota and averaged 11.5 points and 8.8 rebounds a game in the playoffs.

The 40-year-old Malone&#x27;s quest to win an NBA championship failed as the Lakers were defeated in five games by the Detroit Pistons in the 2004 NBA Finals. Malone sprained his right knee in game three and played injured in games three and four before missing the fifth and final game of the series.

===Retirement===
After his season with the Lakers, Malone became a free agent. He had knee surgery during the summer of 2004, and personal problems with Lakers guard Kobe Bryant prompted Malone not to return for another season with the team. The New York Knicks sought to sign Malone for 2004–05. In early February 2005, prior to the 2005 NBA All-Star Game, Malone&#x27;s agent speculated that Malone would sign with the San Antonio Spurs. Spurs head coach Gregg Popovich confirmed his team was interested in signing Malone, should he decide to play one more season.

At a press conference on February 13, 2005, at the Delta Center, Malone officially announced his retirement from the NBA after 19 seasons.

The Utah Jazz retired Malone&#x27;s jersey number 32 on March 23, 2006, when the Jazz hosted the Washington Wizards. He was also honored with the unveiling of a bronze statue outside the EnergySolutions Arena next to teammate John Stockton, and the renaming of a portion of 100 South in Salt Lake City in his honor. The location where the statues stand is now the intersection of Stockton and Malone.

==Olympic career==
In 1984, Malone and Stockton were both cut from the United States men&#x27;s national basketball team but joined the team in 1992, when national basketball teams welcomed NBA players. Prior to that only professionals from leagues other than the NBA were allowed to compete, and that greatly disadvantaged the United States.

The Oregon National Guard made Malone an honorary member after the U.S. national team beat the Venezuelan team 127–80 in the gold-medal game of the 1992 Olympic qualifier tournament.

Malone played in the 1992 and 1996 Summer Olympics and won gold medals with the US team both years. In the 1996 Olympics, Malone averaged 8.4 points, 4.5 rebounds, and 1.4 assists per game and made 56.9% of two-point field goal attempts and 52.9% of free-throw attempts. In 2010, he was inducted into Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame along with the rest of the original Dream Team.

==Coaching career==

=== Louisiana Tech (2007–2011) ===
On May 31, 2007, Malone became director of basketball promotion and assistant strength and conditioning coach at his alma mater Louisiana Tech University and donated $350,000 to the university athletic department.

On May 29, 2013, Malone returned to the Utah Jazz to work as a big man coach.

==Player profile==

Malone is regarded as one of the best power forwards in the history of the NBA and was known as &quot;the Mailman&quot; for his consistent delivery. He collected two regular-season MVP Awards, eleven NBA First Team nominations and was also selected to the NBA All-Defensive First Team three times. In 2022, to commemorate the NBA&#x27;s 75th Anniversary &quot;The Athletic&quot; ranked their top 75 players of all time, and named Malone as the 16th greatest player in NBA history.

Malone wore number 32 for the Utah Jazz. He wore number 11 for the Los Angeles Lakers (number 32 was retired honoring Magic Johnson, though Johnson himself offered to have it unretired for Malone to wear, an offer Malone declined), though he was photographed with a number 32 jersey at his Lakers introductory press conference. Malone also wore number 11 for the Dream Team, as the players wore 4 to 15 to adhere to FIBA rules.

Malone has also played 193 games without winning an NBA championship, the most in playoff history.

In a poorly received match by some wrestling critics, the two power forwards exchanged &quot;rudimentary headlocks, slams and clotheslines&quot; for 23 minutes. Malone and DDP lost to Rodman and Hogan. The event was a massive financial success for the company, drawing the highest pay-per-view buyrate of 1998 and one of the highest in the company&#x27;s history.

==Personal life==

===Family===

, winner of the 1988 Miss Idaho USA pageant, on December 24, 1990. They have four children: daughter Kadee (born November 8, 1991), daughter Kylee (born April 7, 1993), son Karl Jr. &quot;K.J.&quot; (born May 8, 1995), and daughter Karlee (born 1998). K.J. played football at LSU, and was invited to the 2018 NFL Combine.

In 1998, the tabloid newspaper &quot;The Globe&quot; reported that Malone had been a defendant in paternity lawsuits, filed shortly after Malone began his professional basketball career in the late 1980s. The newspaper alleged that he was the father of three children: two by Bonita Ford, a woman approximately his age from his hometown of Summerfield, Louisiana, and one with Gloria Bell, who was 13 when she gave birth. Malone and Ford were both 17 when twins Daryl and Cheryl Ford were born; Malone was a 20-year-old college sophomore when Bell, at age 13, gave birth to Demetress Bell. No statutory rape charges were filed. In the aftermath of the &quot;Globe&quot; story, Malone met the Ford twins for the first time since visiting them in the hospital after they were born. Malone did not meet with Bell at that time, and his attorney insisted that Malone had settled the lawsuits before any conclusive establishment of paternity and thus still did not know whether he was truly the father of any of the children.

The &quot;Tribune&quot; confirmed that the judge in the Bell lawsuit ruled Malone to be the father, not based on presented evidence, but rather because Malone did not respond to the suit. The paper also examined court documents detailing the evidence that was to have been presented had Malone responded and a trial ensued. One item listed was a laboratory blood test that concluded with over 99% certainty that Bell&#x27;s father was either Malone or a brother of Malone. The paper also reported that applying the same blood sample to the Ford twins resulted in a similarly high probability of paternity by Malone. According to the &quot;Tribune&quot;, Malone challenged the court&#x27;s ruling with regard to Bell, claiming that the judgment holding him responsible for $125 per week in child support, plus past and future medical expenses, was excessive. Before Malone&#x27;s appeal was adjudicated, the lawsuit was settled on confidential terms. In the case of the Ford twins, Malone was ruled to be their father when he violated a court order by refusing to reveal his assets or submit to a DNA test. Thereafter, another out-of-court settlement was reached.

By the fall of 1998, Malone accepted his paternity of the Ford twins, and Kay Malone said publicly that the twins were members of the Malone family. Since that time, Karl Malone has maintained a relationship with the twins, each of whom later played college basketball at his alma mater, Louisiana Tech. Cheryl Ford went on to a professional basketball career with the Detroit Shock of the Women&#x27;s National Basketball Association.

Bell has played as an NFL offensive lineman for the Buffalo Bills, Philadelphia Eagles, and Dallas Cowboys. In 2008, &quot;The Buffalo News&quot; reported that Bell&#x27;s first ever meeting with Malone came shortly after Bell graduated from high school. According to Bell, Malone told him then that it was &quot;too late&quot; for them to have a father-son relationship. However, in 2014, the two repaired their relationship and were in regular contact by 2018.

In 2018, Malone said about his relationship with his older children, &quot;I didn&#x27;t handle it right; I was wrong. ... Father Time is the biggest thief that&#x27;s out there, and you can&#x27;t get that back.&quot;

=== Religion ===
Malone has identified as a Baptist in the past, and his wife and children are Catholics. However, he is said to have served as godfather to Samuel, the son of David Stockton. The Stocktons are devout Catholics whose Church requires that godparents also be Catholics.

===Politics===
Malone donated $4,000 to the 2004 reelection campaign of President George W. Bush and $2,000 to the 2004 U.S. Senate campaign of Lisa Murkowski, a Republican from Alaska. In 2002, Malone donated $1,000 to the campaign of incumbent U.S. Representative Jim Matheson, a Democrat representing Utah&#x27;s 2nd congressional district. Malone appeared on the &quot;Great American Panel&quot; segment of the Fox News talk show &quot;Hannity&quot; in March 2009. He advocated support for farmers in Louisiana who were about to lose their jobs due to the closing of Pilgrim&#x27;s Pride plants.

Malone has served on the board of directors of the National Rifle Association of America (NRA), a national firearms advocacy organization in the USA.

===Outdoor life===
Malone is an avid hunter and fisherman. He owns a summer home near the Kenai River in Alaska. In July 1998, Malone joined his Jazz teammates Chris Morris and Bryon Russell, some family members, corporate leadership of Q-Lube, and winners of a Q-Lube contest for a four-day fishing trip to Alaska.

===Public image===
Malone is known for frequently referring to himself in the third person.

He has also appeared in television commercials for LA Gear sneakers, Starter, Morris Air Service, Upper Deck, and Burger King.

A cereal dedicated to him, MVP Flakes, was produced in 2000.

<text>The flag of [[Samoa]] () was first adopted from 24 February 1949, for UN Trusteeships, and continuously applied for the state&#x27;s independence on 1 January 1962. It consists of a red field with a blue rectangle in the canton. The blue rectangle bears the Southern Cross: four large white stars and one smaller star. It makes a total of five white stars.

The flag is officially defined by the &quot;Official Flag and National Anthem of Samoa Act 1994&quot;. When it is being raised or lowered in public, people and vehicles must stop and remain stationary until the performance is complete. Those who deface the flag or who wilfully insult it can be imprisoned for up to six months.

== Historical flags ==
Prior to the First World War, Samoa was a colony of the German Empire. German colonies used the flag of the Imperial Colonial Office, a black-white-red tricolour defaced with the Imperial Eagle. The Imperial German government intended to introduce specific flags for the colonies (also based on the tricolour) and several proposals were created, but the war and the subsequent loss of all overseas territories prevented their official adoption. New Zealand occupied German Samoa in 1914 and officially gained control of the territory in 1919.

From the capture by New Zealand forces on 29 August 1914, a defaced ensign with three palm trees encircled, and emblazoned on the fly were used.

<doc id="459306" wikidata="Q169907" url="?curid=459306" title="Flag of São Tomé and Príncipe">
<text>The national flag of São Tomé and Príncipe is a horizontal triband of green, yellow, and green, with a red isosceles triangle at the hoist and two five-pointed black stars on the yellow band. The flag&#x27;s aspect ratio is 1:2 and the ratio of the bands are 2:3:2. The flag was adopted upon São Tomé and Príncipe&#x27;s independence from Portugal on 12 July 1975. The design is based on, and nearly identical to, the first flag of the Movement for the Liberation of São Tomé and Príncipe (MLSTP), which led the country to its independence.

== Design ==
The flag was designed by Manuel Pinto da Costa, the first president of São Tomé and Príncipe. It is almost identical to the MLSTP flag except that the widths of its bands are at a ratio of 2:3:2, while on the MLSTP flag they are equal. The flag&#x27;s colours are shared by the flags initially adopted by two other former Portuguese colonies, Cape Verde and Guinea-Bissau, and all three feature a black star.

=== Symbolism ===
The colours and symbols of the flag carry cultural and political significance; however, sources differ on the specific meanings. The office of the São Toméan president gives the following significance to the flag&#x27;s elements: green, yellow, and red are the Pan-African colours and represent the São Toméan independence movement; the triangle represents equality; and the two black stars represent the country&#x27;s two eponymous islands, São Tomé and Príncipe. American vexillologist Whitney Smith attributes additional meaning to the flag; according to him, green represents the islands&#x27; lush vegetation, yellow represents the tropical sun, the red triangle represents equality and the independence movement, and the two black stars specifically represent the African population of the two islands. Meanwhile, the US Central Intelligence Agency&#x27;s &quot;World Factbook&quot; states that yellow represents cocoa, a major agricultural export of the country.

=== Construction ===
The São Toméan government has specified sizes, colours, and manufacturing parameters in which the flag is to be made. The construction of the flag is outlined in Part I, Article 14 of the Constitution of São Tomé and Príncipe (2002 revision). The flag consists of three horizontal bands: two green bands of equal width at the top and bottom, and a yellow band in the middle that is one-and-a-half times the width of the green bands. The yellow band contains two five-pointed black stars. At the hoist is a red triangle whose height is equal to half of its base (an isosceles triangle).

== Usage ==
=== Protocol ===
The São Toméan government has not legally codified a national flag protocol. Article 13 of the São Toméan constitution states that international conventions are observed domestically once they are &quot;ratified by the respective competent bodies&quot;. São Tomé and Príncipe therefore follows standard flag protocol, as observed by the United Nations.

=== Flag of convenience ===
The flag of São Tomé and Príncipe is one of many national flags flown as a flag of convenience by foreign merchant vessels. The São Toméan government encourages this practice because it brings in much-needed revenue to the country. Thirty-nine large ships were flying the flag in 2002, despite the fact that São Tomé and Príncipe does not have any deep-water ports for them to dock in. The São Toméan flag was previously on the Paris Blacklist of merchant flags for poor port state control, but it was removed in 2004 due to a lack of investigations being conducted on ships flying the flag. , the flag remains off the blacklist.

== History ==
The Portuguese began colonising the then uninhabited islands of São Tomé and Príncipe in the 16th century. Four centuries later, the Batepá massacre in 1953 stoked nationalistic sentiment and galvanised a struggle for independence. The MLSTP was founded seven years later and remained underground until the Carnation Revolution in Portugal in 1974. The new Portuguese government recognised the MLSTP as the &quot;sole and legitimate representative&quot; of the São Toméan people, and the two parties negotiated a roadmap for São Toméan independence.

Eight designs for a São Toméan national flag were proposed and reviewed, all of which utilised the Pan-African colours. A modified version of the MLSTP flag, designed by the first São Toméan president Manuel Pinto da Costa, was ultimately chosen. It was adopted upon the independence of São Tomé and Príncipe on 12 July 1975.

<text>The national flag of Senegal () is a tricolour consisting of three vertical green, yellow and red bands charged with a five-pointed green star at the centre. Adopted in 1960 to replace the flag of the Mali Federation, it has been the flag of the Republic of Senegal since the country gained independence that year. The present and previous flags were inspired by the French tricolour, which flew over Senegal until 1960.

==History==

Under French colonial rule over Senegal, the authorities forbade the colony from using its own distinctive colonial flag because they were worried that this could increase nationalistic sentiment and lead to calls for independence. With the rise of the decolonization movement in Africa, the French were obliged to grant limited autonomy to Senegal as a self-governing republic within the French Community. Senegal was combined with French Sudan on April 4, 1959, to form the Mali Federation. That day, a new flag was adopted: a vertical green, yellow and red tricolour with a stylized depiction of a human being (referred to as a &quot;kanaga&quot;) on the centre band. The federation attained independence from France on June 20, 1960.

The federation between the two former colonies did not last long and ended two months after independence. On August 20, Senegal separated from the federation and became an independent country. The new nation&#x27;s flag kept the colours and stripes of the federation&#x27;s flag, with the only change being the replacement of the &quot;kanaga&quot; with a green star.

In April 2004, the flag and its design were hoist into the public colloquium when Moustapha Niasse, then-leader of the Alliance of the Forces of Progress, hosted a press conference regarding the &quot;modification of the election code and the set up of an independent commission to check the lawfulness of the next legislative and presidential elections.&quot; 

At the conference&#x27;s coda, Niasse explored what he felt was &quot;defense of the symbols of the Republic against the division threat and the offence against national unity&quot;, and produced &quot;[a] visible replacement, on certain official documents, of the green star of the central yellow stripe of the national flag by a golden baobab&quot;, alongside what he described as &quot;the non-performance of the national anthem during official ceremonies&quot;.

The newspaper WalFadjri reported on the same press conference with an emphasis on the alleged transmutation of the national symbology, even going so far as to entitle the feature &quot;President Wade creates a new flag&quot;. Niasse again produced what he flaunted as an &quot;official document signed by the head of state...with a golden baobab instead of the green star.&quot; Niasse himself stated &quot;Only the Senegalese people is sovereign to decide any modification of the symbols of our Republic&quot;.

==Design==
===Symbolism===
Much symbolism and many connotations are beholden to the stripes and singular star of the Senegalese flag. From a national perspective, green is highly symbolic within all of the country&#x27;s primary religions. In Islam, the country&#x27;s majority religion at 94% percent of the population, the green of both the first stripe and the star represent the colour of the Prophet, Christians see the presence of green as a portent of hope, and Animists (or adherers to Traditional African religions) view green as representative of fecundity.

The Senegalese government offers exegesis for the presence of yellow and red as well, yellow being &quot;the symbol of wealth; it represents the product of work, for a nation whose main priority is the progress of economy, which will allow the increase of the cultural level, the second national priority.&quot; Additionally, yellow is denoted as &quot;the colour of arts, literature, and intellect&quot;, primarily because literature teachers in Senegal are known to wear yellow blouses. Red &quot;recalls the colour of blood, therefore colour of life and the sacrifice accepted by the nation, and also of the strong determination to fight against underdevelopment.&quot;

Historically, the three colours represent the three political parties which merged to form Union Progressiste Sénégalaisé (Senegalese Progressist Union, now Socialist Party of Senegal, Leopold Senghor&#x27;s party): green for Bloc Démocratique Sénégalais (Senegalese Democratic Bloc), yellow for Mouvement Populaire Sénégalais (Senegalese Popular Movement) and red for Parti Sénégalais d&#x27;Action Sociale (Senegalese Party of Socialist Action).

Green, yellow and red are the colours of the Pan-Africanist movement. That pattern was replicated on Senegal&#x27;s flag as a sign of unity among African countries. The quinary points of the star are said to either &quot;recall the human ideogram which was displayed in the middle of the flag of the former Mali Federation&quot; or an adoption of the Serer cosmogonical and religious star &quot;Yooniir&quot; ― the symbol of the universe in Serer spirituality and cosmogony, which also symbolises &quot;good fortune and destiny&quot; in the Serer worldview. The symbol is represented by a black 5 pointed star which also spiritually and/or metaphorically denotes &quot;the Black man standing head held high, hands raised representing work and prayer. Sign of God: Image of Man.&quot; The first President of Senegal―Léopold Sédar Senghor who was of Serer origin, a founding-member of the Négritude Movement, and who had a history of appropriating (others say &quot;celebrating&quot;) Serer religious symbols, mythology, and spiritual references in his works despite being a Catholic, probably adopted the Serer religious star just like he did in 1978 when he bought the country&#x27;s presidential plane and named it &quot;Point de Sangomar&quot; in reference to the Serer sacred site the Point of Sangomar - which in Serer means &quot;the village of shadows&quot;.

The Pan-African colours of Senegal&#x27;s flag are shared by several other countries in the region, including Cameroon, Guinea and Mali.

<doc id="459310" wikidata="Q173201" url="?curid=459310" title="Flag of Seychelles">
<text>The national flag of Seychelles () was adopted on 8 January 1996. The current flag is the third used by the country since its independence from the United Kingdom on 29 June 1976. The colours used in the current flag are the official colours of two of the country&#x27;s major political parties: the Seychelles People&#x27;s United Party and the Seychelles Democratic Party.

== Description ==
This unique flag consists of five different coloured bands (blue, yellow, red, white, and green) starting from one end and diverging towards the other end. The oblique bands symbolize a dynamic new country moving into the future. The colour blue depicts the sky and the sea that surrounds the Seychelles. Yellow is for the sun which gives light and life, red symbolizes the people and their determination to work for the future in unity and love, while the white band represents social justice and harmony. The green depicts the land and natural environment.

== History ==
The original flag was adopted after independence on June 29, 1976. It had alternating blue and red triangles. The flag was very similar to the Australasian United Steam Navigation Company&#x27;s flag, whose ships regularly visited the islands of Seychelles in the early 20th century.

In 1977, when president James Mancham was overthrown by France-Albert René, the old flag was abolished and the red, white and green flag based on the flag of the Seychelles People&#x27;s United Party came into use, which had a distinct wavy white stripe. The only significant difference between the national flag and SPUP&#x27;s flag was the depiction of the sun in the party&#x27;s flag which was not used in the country&#x27;s flag. When the party lost the majority in the elections, other parties demanded a change in the flag which led to a parliamentary approval of a new proposed design.

<doc id="459311" wikidata="Q4862582" url="?curid=459311" title="Baron Lucas">
<text>Baron Lucas is a title that has been created twice in the Peerage of England. The second creation is extant and is currently held with the title Lord Dingwall in the Peerage of Scotland.

==Barons Lucas (of Shenfield) (1645)==
The title Baron Lucas, of Shenfield in the County of Essex, was created 13 January 1645 for Sir John Lucas, a Royalist army officer. He was succeeded according to a special remainder in the letters patent by his nephew, Charles Lucas. The title became dormant on the death of the third Baron in 1705.
* John Lucas, 1st Baron Lucas of Shenfield (1606–1671),
* Charles Lucas, 2nd Baron Lucas (1631–1688). Son of the first Baron&#x27;s elder brother, Sir Thomas Lucas (1598–1649), a royalist army officer, and technically illegitimate as Thomas&#x27;s parents married after he was born.
* Robert Lucas, 3rd Baron Lucas of Shenfield (c.1649–1705), unmarried.

==Barons Lucas (of Crudwell) (1663)==
The title Baron Lucas, of Crudwell in the County of Wiltshire, was created at the request of John Lucas, her father, in 1663 for Mary, Countess of Kent, new wife of the 11th Earl of Kent and only surviving child of the 1st Baron of the first creation above. The title was created with remainder to her heirs male by Lord Kent and failing which to her heirs general without division (the latter being the same way that the Crown passed, i.e. to the eldest daughter in the absence of sons, rather than going into abeyance or to the nearest male-line relative). The 1st Baroness was succeeded by her son, who had already succeeded as 12th Earl of Kent, and who was successively created Marquess of Kent and Duke of Kent. (See Duke of Kent for information on the Kent peerages.)

In 1718, the Duke of Kent&#x27;s elder son, Anthony, Earl of Harold (1695–1723), was summoned to Parliament by a writ in acceleration as Baron Lucas, and is usually numbered as the 3rd Baron (see note below). In view of the death of both his sons and the consequent extinction of the dukedom at his death the Duke managed to obtain in 1740 (at the cost of his other Grey titles excluding Lucas) only a new marquessate, Marquess Grey. However he obtained a special remainder of the marquessate, in default of his heirs male, to his granddaughter, Jemima Campbell (who was the only surviving child of his eldest daughter, the former Lady Amabel Grey, who was the late wife of Lord Glenorchy (later 3rd Earl of Breadalbane and Holland)). On the Duke&#x27;s death later that year, the Barony of Lucas, along with the Marquessate of Grey, passed to this granddaughter (by now the wife of the 2nd Earl of Hardwicke), who became 2nd Marchioness Grey and 4th Baroness Lucas of Crudwell.

On her death, the Marquessate became extinct and the Barony passed to her eldest daughter, Amabel, Lady Polwarth (widow of Alexander, Lord Polwarth, eldest son of the 3rd Earl of Marchmont), who became 5th Baroness Lucas. In 1816 she was created Countess de Grey, of Wrest in the County of Bedford, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom, with a special remainder to her sister (the widow of the 2nd Baron Grantham) and her heirs male. (See Earl de Grey for information on that peerage.)

On her death, the Earldom of de Grey and the Barony of Lucas passed under their respective remainders to her nephew, the 3rd Baron Grantham, who became 2nd Earl de Grey and 6th Baron Lucas. On his death, the Earldom of de Grey passed to his nephew, the 2nd Earl of Ripon, and the Barony passed to his daughter, Anne, Countess Cowper (widow of the 6th Earl Cowper), who became 7th Baroness Lucas. On her death, the Barony passed to her son, the 7th Earl Cowper, who became 8th Baron Lucas. He was restored as 3rd Baron Butler in the Peerage of England and 4th Lord Dingwall in the Peerage of Scotland upon the termination of the attainder on those titles. (See Earl Cowper for the Cowper peerages.)

On his death, the Earldom of Cowper and its associated titles became extinct, the Barony of Butler became abeyant, and the Barony of Lucas and the Lordship of Dingwall passed to his nephew, Auberon Herbert (a grandson of the 3rd Earl of Carnarvon), who became 9th Baron Lucas and 5th Lord Dingwall. He was confirmed in the titles in 1907 by the Committee for Privileges of the House of Lords. After this, the succession was straightforward, the Barony and Lordship passing to the 9th Baron and 5th Lord&#x27;s sister Nan Ino Herbert (later Cooper) (the 10th Baroness and 6th Lady), then her daughter (the 11th Baroness and 7th Lady), and then her son (the 12th Baron and 8th Lord), who is the current holder of the titles.

The Lord Lucas and Dingwall is a grandson of the 3rd Earl of Selborne, and so is also in remainder to the Earldom of Selborne and its subsidiary titles. He is also one of the co-heirs to the Barony of Butler.

*Mary Grey, Countess of Kent, 1st Baroness Lucas (d. 1702)
*Henry Grey, 1st Duke of Kent, 1st Marquess Grey, 2nd Baron Lucas (1671–1740)
*Anthony Grey, Earl of Harold, 3rd Baron Lucas (1695–1723) (by writ in acceleration)
*Jemima Yorke, 2nd Marchioness Grey, 4th Baroness Lucas (1722–1797)
*Amabel Hume-Campbell, 1st Countess de Grey, 5th Baroness Lucas (1751–1833)
*Thomas Philip de Grey, 2nd Earl de Grey, 6th Baron Lucas (1781–1859)
*Anne Florence Cowper, Countess Cowper, 7th Baroness Lucas (1806–1880)
*Francis Thomas de Grey Cowper, 7th Earl Cowper, 8th Baron Lucas and 4th Lord Dingwall (1834–1905)
*Auberon Thomas Herbert, 9th Baron Lucas and 5th Lord Dingwall (1876–1916)
*Nan Ino Cooper, 10th Baroness Lucas and 6th Lady Dingwall (1880–1958)
*Anne Rosemary Palmer, 11th Baroness Lucas and 7th Lady Dingwall (1919–1991)
*Ralph Matthew Palmer, 12th Baron Lucas and 8th Lord Dingwall (b. 1951)

The heir apparent is Lewis Edward Palmer, Master of Dingwall (b. 1987)

<doc id="459312" wikidata="Q160861" url="?curid=459312" title="Flag of Slovakia">
<text>The current form of the national flag of the Slovak Republic () was adopted by Slovakia&#x27;s Constitution, which came into force on 3 September 1992. The flag, like many other flags of Slavic nations, uses Pan-Slavic colours (red, white, and blue). Pictured to the left of centre of the flag is Slovakia&#x27;s national coat of arms.

==History==
Slovakia&#x27;s flag in its current form (but with another coat of arms on it or without any arms) can be dated back to the revolutionary year 1848. It was also used semi-officially in Czechoslovakia before World War II, by the Slovak Republic during World War II.

In 1990, the interior ministry tasked Ladislav Čisárik, a painter and heraldic artist, and Ladislav Vrtel, an expert in heraldry, with creating a new coat of arms and national flag. Čisárik and Vrtel based their designs for a modern coat of arms and flag on an existing 14th century Hungarian coat of arms. However, Čisárik and Vrtel chose to enlarge the double cross three times to emphasize it as a national symbol. In addition to the national coat of arms and the national flag, the duo also designed a new presidential standard, which incorporates the double cross as well.

The new flag was finally adopted (initially without Čisárik&#x27;s and Vrtel&#x27;s coat of arms) on 1 March 1990 as the flag of the Slovak Republic within Czechoslovakia. The coat of arms was added on 3 September 1992 and a special law describing the details of the flag followed in February 1993, after Slovakia became an independent country.

==Design==

Since the Slovak flag without the coat of arms is similar to the current flag of the Russian Federation (only the hues of red and blue differing), the Constitution of Slovakia added the national coat of arms to it in September 1992.

It is one of 28 national flags that contain overtly Christian symbols.

<text>The flag of Solomon Islands consists of a thin yellow diagonal stripe from the lower hoist-side corner, with a blue upper triangle and green lower triangle, and the canton charged with five white stars. Adopted in 1977 to replace the British Blue Ensign defaced with the arms of the protectorate, it has been the flag of Solomon Islands since 18 November of that year, eight months before the country gained independence. Although the number of provinces has since increased, the number of stars on the flag that originally represented them remained unchanged.

==History==
===British protectorate===

The Germans and the British agreed to partition the modern-day Solomon Islands in 1886, with the latter taking control of the southern section. Seven years later, in 1893, they declared this area a protectorate within their colonial empire. At the turn of the 20th century, Germany subsequently gave up their northern part to the United Kingdom in exchange for the latter&#x27;s acceptance of German claims over Samoa and areas in Africa. During this time, the Union Jack and the Red Ensign were instituted, as well as a Blue Ensign defaced with the protectorate&#x27;s name and the monarch&#x27;s crown.

A new emblem for the protectorate was introduced in 1947 and featured a red field charged with a black-and-white sea turtle. This was modified only nine years later because the turtle was a motif affiliated with only one of the islands&#x27; provinces. The revised version of 1956 saw the shield divided quarterly and displayed a lion, an eagle, a turtle, a frigate bird, and assorted weapons from the region.

===New flag for a new country===
In the lead up to independence, a contest was held in 1975 to design a new flag for the future country. One of the submissions contained the nation&#x27;s coat of arms, while the initial winning design, by William Robson, an English civil engineer at the Public Works Department, had a blue field with a yellow circle, encompassed with chains and charged with a black frigate bird. However, this was eventually rescinded, since this bird was attributed to only one province as opposed to the entire country. The second winning design included a red field charged with a black elliptical chain at the centre. As explained by the artist, this alluded to the historical practice of blackbirding in the country and the &quot;blood spilt&quot; as a result of it. After it was published in a national newspaper, the design stirred up much debate in the community and it too was scrapped.

Ultimately, the last design was created by a New Zealander teaching visual arts at the King George VI School, in the eastern part of the capital Honiara. This was in spite of the fact that preference was supposed to be given to local submissions by Solomon Islanders. The stars stood for the country&#x27;s provinces and not the Southern Cross, unlike the flags of nearby Australia, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, and Samoa. It was ratified as the new flag of the islands on 18 November 1977, eight months before the country became the final British protectorate to gain independence.

===Independence and beyond===
The Independence Day ceremony on 7 July 1978, in Gizo, Western Province – which saw the lowering of the Union Jack and the raising of the new flag – was controversial and led to a confrontation between locals and those from Malaita Province. This was because leaders from the Western Council had unsuccessfully lobbied the government to promise greater devolved powers to the provinces, and some of the province&#x27;s inhabitants viewed the flag ceremony – which had already been engineered to be as subdued as possible – as a demonstration of &quot;Malaitan dominance&quot; over Western Province.

The Solomon Islander flag has been utilized as a flag of convenience by foreign merchant vessels since 2012. That year, an Act was adopted by the country&#x27;s National Parliament approving of its usage in this manner, with the government predicting more than US$500,000 in taxes annually. The transport minister claimed that this would also give local sailors new employment opportunities and expand chances to reap foreign exchange.

==Design==
===Symbolism===
The colours and symbols of the flag have cultural, political, and regional meanings. The blue evokes the water, as well as its significance to the country in the form of rivers, rain, and the Pacific Ocean. The green alludes to the land, along with the trees and crops that grow on it. The yellow epitomizes the sun and its rays separating the land and the ocean.

The five stars are arranged in three offset rows at the canton, in the shape of the letter X. At first, these were meant to symbolize the provinces that the country was subdivided into at the time of independence (Central, Western, Eastern, Malaita and Honiara Capital). Even though new provinces have since been created, the number of stars has remained unchanged.

===Similarities===

One of the various proposed alternatives to the present flag of Australia is an emblem labelled the &#x27;Southern Horizon&#x27;. Having been voted as the favourite in an unofficial poll of more than 8,000 people, its blue, gold, and green colour scheme – together with its depiction of the Southern Cross – is noted for its conspicuous resemblance to that of the Solomon Islands flag.

==Variants==
The civil ensign (for merchant ships) and state ensign (for non-military government vessels) are red and blue flags, respectively, with the national flag in the canton. The naval ensign (for police vessels) is based on the British white ensign, a red cross on a white field, also with the national flag in the canton.

==Historical flags==
==Provincial flags of Solomon Islands==
These are the flags of the nine provinces administered by elected provincial assemblies, the tenth is the capital Honiara, administered by the Honiara Town Council.

<text>A value transfer system refers to any system, mechanism, or network of people that receives money for the purpose of making the funds or an equivalent value payable to a third party in another geographic location, whether or not in the same form.

The average size of the payment is an indicator of the system&#x27;s use. Specialised large-value transfer system have developed because of the large size and critical timing of some payments market participants require services and mechanisms that meet their need for reliability, security, accuracy and timeliness.

A value transfer system may fall into one or more of these groups:
*Retail value transfer systems:
**Traditional retail value transfer systems, e.g. Bank transfer, Wire transfer, Post offices transfer service or specialist companies such as Western Union
**Internet-only value transfer systems, e.g. Electronic money such as PayPal, eGold, Liberty Reserve
***Cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ethereum, etc.
*Institutional formal value transfer systems, e.g. SWIFT (International), domestic real-time gross settlement (RTGS) systems such as LVTS (Canada), Fedwire (USA), CHAPS (UK)

<doc id="459319" wikidata="Q121688" url="?curid=459319" title="Flag of Spain">
<text>The flag of Spain (), as it is defined in the Constitution of 1978, consists of three horizontal stripes: red, yellow and red, the yellow stripe being twice the height of each red stripe. Traditionally, the middle stripe was defined by the more archaic term of , and hence the popular name (red-weld). That middle stripe often bears the Coat of Arms.

The origin of the current flag of Spain is the naval ensign of 1785, , by Decrée of Charles III of Spain, where it is also referred as &quot;national flag&quot;. It was chosen by Charles III himself from 12 different flags designed by Antonio Valdés y Bazán. All proposed flags were presented in a drawing, which is in the Naval Museum of Madrid. The flag remained marine-focused for most of the next 50 years and flew over coastal fortresses, marine barracks and other naval property. During the Peninsular War, the flag could also be found on marine regiments fighting inland and it was raised by many Spaniards as a symbol of resistance. In 1843, during the reign of Queen Isabella II of Spain, the flag was adopted by all the Armed Forces.

From 18th century to nowadays, the colour scheme of the flag remained intact, with the exception of the Second Republic period (1931–1939); the only changes centred on the coat of arms.

==Spanish flag legal framework and specifications==
* Spanish Constitution of 1978, establishing the national flag:
* Act 39/1981, regulating the use of the flag.
* Royal Decree 441/1981, establishing the detailed technical specifications of the colours of the flag.
* Royal Decree 1511/1977, establishing the Regulations on flags, banners and emblems ()
* Royal decree of 19 July 1913 (effective 1 January 1913), abolishing the 5-stripe Spanish merchant flag and establishing the plain triband – the national flag without the coat of arms – as the Spanish merchant flag.

===Colours===
The colours of the flag, as officially defined by the Spanish Royal Decree 441/1981 of 27 February in two CIE colour spaces, are:

The nearest Pantone shades are 7628 C (red) and 7406 C (yellow).

===Design===
The basic design of the current flag of Spain with the coat of arms is specified by rule 3 of the Royal Decree 1511/1977, which states the following:
* The coat of arms of Spain has a height equal to of the hoist (height) and will figure on both sides of the flag.
* When the flag is of regular proportions, having a length equal to of the width, the coat of arm&#x27;s axis is placed at a distance from the hoist equal to of the flag&#x27;s height.
* If the flag&#x27;s length is less than normal, the coat of arms is placed at the centre of the flag.
This type of triband design has become known as a Spanish fess.

==Flag protocol==
The flag must only be flown horizontally. It can be flown from public buildings, private homes, businesses, ships, town squares, or during official ceremonies. While the flag should be flown from sunrise to sunset, government offices in Spain and abroad must fly the flag on a 24-hour basis; during the night, and in poor light, it must be properly lit. The flags must conform to the legal standards, and cannot be soiled or damaged in any way.

For mourning activities, the flag can be flown in either of the following ways. The first method, commonly known as half-masting, is performed when the flag is hoisted to the top of the flagpole, then lowered to the pole&#x27;s one-third position. The other method is to attach a black ribbon to a flag that is permanently affixed to a staff. The ribbon itself is ten centimetres wide and it is attached to the mast so that the ends of the ribbon reach the bottom of the flag. During the funeral ceremony, the flag may be used to cover the coffins of government officials, soldiers and persons designated by an act of the President; these flags are later folded and presented to the next of kin before interment.

When flying the Spanish flag with other flags, the following is the order of precedence: the national flag, flags of foreign states, the flag of Europe, international NGOs, military and government standards, autonomous communities flags, city flags and any others. When foreign flags are used alongside the Spanish flag, the flags are sorted according to the countries&#x27; names alphabetically in the Spanish language. The only exception is when the congress or meeting held in Spain dictates a different language to be used for sorting. The flag of Europe has been hoisted since Spain became a member of the Union. While not mentioned by name in the law, the flag of NATO can also be used in Spain, since it belongs to that organization.

When unfurled in the presence of other flags, the national flag must not have smaller dimensions and must be situated in a prominent, honourable place, according to the relevant protocol.

==Other flags currently in use==
===Civil authorities===
Some high-ranking officials of the Spanish state (i.e., the president, the vice-presidents and the ministers of the government, or the chairmen of the Congress of Deputies and the Senate) are entitled to display a flag representative of their status. It is a square flag of Spain with the Spanish coat of arms centred on the yellow stripe.

===Yacht ensign===
The Yacht ensign is the flag of Spain charged with the royal crown in blue in the centre of the yellow stripe. This flag was first established in 1875 by Royal Decree (real decreto), which provided that the central stripe would display the royal crown (corona real); this flag apparently continued to be used following the creation of the Spanish Republic in 1931, but the royal crown was changed to a blue mural crown or a blue coronet; the current version — depicting the royal crown in blue — was introduced following the restoration of the monarchy.

===Naval jack ===
The Spanish naval jack is hoisted at the prow of all Navy ships when docked or anchored in foreign waters, from sunrise to sunset. In national waters it is hoisted on Sundays, festivities and in presence of a foreign warship as soon as it moors at the dock. The national flag is always hoisted at the stern, when sailing, and from sunrise to sunset, when docked. It is a square flag (ratio 1:1) composed of 4 quarters: The current version of the jack was adopted in the early 1980s.
* First quarter, for Castile: Gules, a tower Or, masoned sable and ajouré azure;
* Second quarter, for León: Argent, a lion rampant gules (differing from the one on the national flag) crowned, langued and armed or;
* Third quarter, for Aragon: Or, four pallets gules;
* Fourth quarter, for Navarre: Gules, a cross, saltire and orle of chains linked together Or, a centre point vert.

===Flags for Armed Forces===
The flag used by the Spanish Armed Forces is the same one that is used as the state flag and national ensign. Military units, however, use a less oblong, more square version (full size dimensions ) charged with the name of the unit.

===Royal Standards of Spain===


The King of Spain uses a flag known as the Royal Standard. The Royal Standard of Spain consists of a crimson square with the Coat of arms of the King in the centre. It is usually flown at the King&#x27;s official residence, the Palacio de la Zarzuela, other Spanish royal sites, or displayed on his official car as small flags. It is regulated by clause 2 of Royal Decree 527/2014, 20 June, an amendment to Title II of Spanish Royal Decree 1511/1977 adopting Flags, Standards, Guidons, Insignia and Emblems Regulation.

The Royal Guidon (&quot;Guión&quot;), the monarch&#x27;s military personal ensign, is described by Rule 1 of Royal Decree 527/2014, an amendment to Title II, Rule 1 of Spanish Royal Decree 1511/1977. It is nearly identical to the Royal Standard except that the Royal Guidon has a Gold fringe. It is made of silk taffeta. The size of the guidon is . It is the personal command ensign or positional flag of the monarch, and is carried near him.

The heir to the crown, the Princess of Asturias, has her own standard and guidon. The Standard of the Princess of Asturias is regulated by Royal Decree 284/2001 that modified the Title II of Spanish Royal Decree 1511/1977. The Standard of the Princess of Asturias consists of a light blue (the colour of the flag of Asturias) square flag with the coat of arms of the Princess of Asturias in the center. The Guidon is identical to the Standard except that the Royal Guidon has a gold fringe. It is made of silk taffeta. The size of the guidon is . It has fallen into disuse because of the Princess&#x27;s young age.

==History==
While the concept of a national flag did not exist in the Middle Ages, the symbol of Spain was the Royal Shield. It was frequently made up of other different flags, full of images and symbols that represented all the values that the troops or the King defended.
===Standard of the Catholic monarchs===
In Spain the medieval kingdoms which merged in the sixteenth century had their own heraldic symbols and their navies used to display their own flags and standards on both the Mediterranean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean, where the Aragonese and Castilian Crowns had their respective areas of influence. The flag of the Crown of Aragon was a yellow flag with four red stripes (an element which is still common in the present flags of the territories that formed the Crown: Aragon, Catalonia, Valencia, the Balearic Islands and Roussillon in France). The Crown of Castile, since the final union between the kingdoms of Castile and León in 1230, used a quartered flag alternating the Castilian (Gules, a tower Or, masoned sable and ajouré azure) and Leonese (Argent, a lion rampant purpure crowned or, langued and armed gules) emblems. Aragonese and Castilian flags and coats of arms merged when the Catholic monarchs created the new symbols of their personal union of the crowns in 1475.

The banner of Castile and León was the first European symbol to arrive in the New World.

===Cross of Burgundy===

The Cross of Burgundy was introduced to Spain after the marriage of Joanna of Castile to Philip the Handsome, Duke of Burgundy in 1496. The flag was the primary symbol of Philip the Handsome. It introduced into Spanish vexillology a design that, although of foreign origin, would become the primary symbol of Spain. The flag was usually embroidered on white or yellow cloth. The Cross of Burgundy is also known as &quot;The Vane of Burgundy&quot; or as it is derived from St. Andrew&#x27;s Cross. Since the reign of Charles I of Spain (1516–1556), different Spanish armies have used flags with the Cross of Burgundy on different fields. It was also incorporated in the uniforms of Burgundian archers, and later in the uniforms of the rest of the army. It also appeared on Spanish regimental flags.

===Habsburg Spain===
When the House of Habsburg took the Spanish throne by mid-16th century each military company had its own flag in which appeared usually the arms of its commander over the Cross of Burgundy. In order to represent the King, they used to have another one, the &quot;Coronela&quot;, during the reign of Charles I (Charles V as Holy Roman Emperor) that was made of yellow silk (the imperial colour) with the embroidered imperial shield.

When Philip II came to power, he ordered that, in addition to the flags of each company, each Tercio should have another one in yellow with the Cross of Burgundy in red. The units of Cavalry took the same flags but of smaller size, called Banners.

However, at this time the concept of a national flag as understood nowadays did not exist, and so the true symbol of the nationality was represented by the Royal arms. The use of other flags besides the mentioned ones was frequent, with various images or symbols. Some examples are the flag of Santiago (Saint James the Great), the green one the Emperor took during the conquest of Tunisia or the crimson one used by Hernán Cortés in Mexico.

===Philip V and the new Bourbon dynasty===
The arms of Bourbon-Anjou were added in 1700 when Philip V became King of Spain. He introduced several changes on the royal arms. The king&#x27;s new arms were designed by the French heraldists Charles-René d&#x27;Hozier and Pierre Clairambault in November 1700. Philip V also changed the philosophy and the design of the flags of Spain. He was the first to give Spain a unified symbol of its own when putting on white fabric the Cross of Burgundy and the Royal coat of arms. It still was not a national flag, but a first attempt, in line with similar attempts in other European nations.

The flags were organized in three groups:

* Standard or Royal flag: it continued being crimson, with the royal arms embroidered, the Golden Fleece and the collar of the Order of the Holy Spirit.
* Military flag: the colour was reduced to white with the Cross of Burgundy and the Royal arms.
* Pavilion of the Navy: again white, with the Royal arms.

===Origins of the present ensign: Charles III===
In 1760, Charles III modified the shield of the Royal arms, suppressing the collar of the Holy Spirit, maintained the Golden Fleece and added two new quarters, corresponding to the House of Farnese (six blue lilies on gold) and Medici (five red discs and one blue disc with three lilies of gold, all on gold).

The military flag or &quot;Coronela&quot; of Spanish regiments was, during the Bourbon years, the Cross of Burgundy with different additions in each military unit depending on their territorial origin, commander, etc.

When Charles III became King of Spain, he observed that most of the countries in Europe used flags which were predominantly white and, since they were frequently at war with each other, lamentable confusions occurred at sea, as if was difficult to determine if a sighted ship were enemy until practically the last moment. thinkers in which Portugal and Spain would be united. There are several flag options most of them combining both countries&#x27; colours and coats of arms.

<text>The flag of [[Sri Lanka]] (; ), also called the &quot;Sinha&quot; Flag or Lion Flag, consists of a golden lion holding a &quot;kastane&quot; sword in its right fore-paw in a maroon background with four gold bo leaves, one in each corner. This is bordered by gold, and to its left are two vertical stripes of equal size in teal and orange, with the orange stripe closest to the lion.

The lion and the maroon background represent the Sinhalese race, while the saffron border and four bo leaves represent the concepts of &quot;meththa&quot;, &quot;karuṇā&quot;, &quot;muditā&quot; and &quot;upecka&quot; respectively. The stripes represent the country&#x27;s two largest minority ethnicities, with the orange stripe representing the Tamils inhabitants—namely the Sri Lankan Tamils and the Indian Tamils of Sri Lanka—and the teal stripe representing the Sri Lankan Moors (Muslims of Sri Lanka). The golden yellow border is a catch-all representing the various minority communities of the country.

==History==
===Monarchical Sri Lanka===
As depicted on a mural in Cave no. 2 at Dambulla Viharaya, King Dutugemunu on his campaign against Elara (an invading South Indian ruler in 162 BC) is depicted with a banner containing a lion figure carrying a sword in its right forepaw, a symbol of the Sun and one of the Moon. This flag was known as the only ancient representation of the lion flag of the Sinhalese but in 1957, the lion figure on it was defaced by a vandal.

===British Ceylon period===
This basic design continued to be in use until 1815, when the Kandyan Convention ended the reign of the country&#x27;s last native monarch, Sri Vikrama Rajasinha, replacing his royal standard (used as the Flag of the Kingdom of Kandy) with the Union Flag as the nation&#x27;s accepted flag. The government of British Ceylon later established its own flag, while Sri Vikrama Rajasinha&#x27;s standard was taken to England and kept at the Royal Hospital Chelsea.

===Sri Lanka (since 1948)===
As the independence movement in Sri Lanka gained strength in the early 20th century, E. W. Perera and D. R. Wijewardena discovered the original Lioness Flag in Chelsea. A photo of it was published in &quot;Dinamina&quot;, in a special edition marking a century since the loss of self-rule and Sri Lankan independence. The flag provoked much interest from the public who, for the first time since the fall of the Kandyan Kingdom, had seen its actual design.

Member of Parliament for Batticaloa, Mudaliyar A. Sinnalebbe, suggested in Parliament on January 16, 1948, that the Lion Flag should be accepted as the national flag. In 1948, the flag was adopted as the national flag of the Dominion of Ceylon, undergoing two changes: one in 1953 and a redesign in 1972. A notable feature of the 1972 adaptation of the Kandyan standard was the replacement of the four spearheads at the flag&#x27;s corners by four bo leaves, a design choice made under the direction of Nissanka Wijeyeratne, Permanent Secretary to the Ministry of Cultural Affairs and Chairman of the National Emblem and Flag Design Committee.

==Symbolism==
According to the Buddhist Mahavamsa chronicle, the Sinhala Buddhists are descended from Prince Vijaya, whose father Sinhabahu was the son of a lion and a human princess. This myth is reflected in the national flag, with its lion symbolizing the Sinhala race.

The national flag of Sri Lanka represents the country and its heritage as a rallying device. Most symbols in the flag have been given distinctive meanings.
==Colours==
The colors of the national flag are specified in the document &quot;SLS 1: 2020: Specification for the National Flag of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka&quot;.

<text>The flag of Sudan () was adopted on 20 May 1970 and consists of a horizontal red-white-black tricolour with a green triangle at the hoist. The flag is based on the Arab Liberation Flag of the Egyptian Revolution of 1952.

Whereas there is no fixed order for the Pan-Arab Colours of black, white, red, and green, flags using the Arab Liberation Colours (a subset of the Pan-Arab Colours) maintain a horizontal triband of equal stripes of red, white, and black, with green being used to distinguish the different flags from each other by way of green stars, Arabic script, or, in the case of Sudan, the green triangle along the hoist. In the original Arab Liberation Flag, green was used in the form of the flag of the Kingdom of Egypt and Sudan emblazoned on the breast of the Eagle of Saladin in the middle stripe. For 13 years from Sudan&#x27;s independence in 1956 to the 1969 military coup of Gaafar Nimeiry, Sudan used a tricolour flag of blue-yellow-green.

The flag was designed by , and was selected after a national competition.

=== Flags of the Mahdists ===
In 1881, at the beginning of the Mahdist War, self-proclaimed Mahdi, Muhammad Ahmad appointed Abdallahi ibn Muhammad as one of his four caliphs and handed him a black flag. Abdallahi used his black flag to recruit Baggara Arabs and other tribes from the west. The other caliphs used different coloured flags. The black horizontal stripe in the current Sudanese flag is a reference to this Mahdist-era black flag.

=== Anglo-Egyptian Sudan ===
Between 1899 and 1956, Anglo-Egyptian Sudan was administered jointly as a condominium by Egypt and the United Kingdom. The condominium did not have its own flag; instead the flag of Egypt and the flag of the United Kingdom were always flown together, with the British flag taking precedence.

A flag did exist as a rank flag for the British Governor General of the Sudan. In common with the rank flags of governors and commissioners of other British overseas territories, it consisted of a Union Flag defaced with a white disk bearing the territory&#x27;s badge or coat of arms, surrounded by a wreath of laurel. As no badge or coat of arms existed for Anglo-Egyptian Sudan, the disk instead contained the words &quot;GOVERNOR GENERAL OF THE SUDAN&quot;.

At the Afro–Asian Conference held between 18 and 24 April 1955, Sudan was represented by a white flag bearing the name &quot;SUDAN&quot; in red capital letters.

=== Republic of Sudan (1956–1969) ===
Upon the independence of Sudan from Anglo-Egyptian rule on 1 January 1956, Sudan adopted a blue-yellow-green tricolour as its national flag. This flag was designed by the poet Macki Sufi and remained in use until 1970, when the current flag was adopted. The colours of the flag represented the River Nile (blue), the Sahara (yellow) and farmlands (green). They were chosen as they were neutral between ethnic groups and political parties.

Use of this flag resurfaced during the 2018–19 Sudanese protests.

=== Democratic Republic of the Sudan (1969–1985) ===
Following a coup d&#x27;état in May 1969, the country was renamed the Democratic Republic of the Sudan and a competition was held to design a new flag. The winning entry was designed by artist Abdel Rahman Ahmed Al-Jali based on pan-Arab colours and was adopted as the national flag in May 1970.

=== Former provincial flags ===
==Sub-national flags==
The sub-national flags usually consist of the state&#x27;s emblem displayed on a white or coloured background. Some of the states of Sudan have adopted their own distinctive flags.

<doc id="459325" wikidata="Q102993" url="?curid=459325" title="Flag of Eswatini">
<text>The flag of Eswatini was adopted on 6 October 1968 after Eswatini (then known as Swaziland) gained independence from the British Empire one month before. The design by King Sobhuza II features a black and white shield, with a staff and two spears, on a field of blue, yellow, and red horizontal bands.

== History ==

The flag is based on the military flag given by King Sobhuza II to the Swazi Pioneer Corps in 1941 to remind them of the nation&#x27;s military traditions. On 25 April 1967, the day the pledge of oath was taken by the king, the flag was hoisted for the first time. The College of Arms in London registered the flag on 30 October 1967. The first official hoisting of the flag was conducted on this day.

== Specifications ==

The flag is rectangular with length and breadth in a ratio of 3:2 respectively. The red stands for past battles, the blue for peace and stability, and the yellow for the resources of Eswatini. The central focus of the flag is a Nguni shield and two spears, symbolising protection from the country&#x27;s enemies. Its colour is meant to show that white and black people live in peaceful coexistence in Eswatini. 

The flag has five horizontal stripes — two blue stripes at the top and bottom while the center stripe is red, and two thin yellow stripes border the red stripe. On the red stripe is an ox hide combat shield from the traditional Swazi Emabutfo Regiment, laid horizontally. The shield is reinforced by a staff from which hangs &quot;injobo&quot; tassels — bunches of feathers of the widowbird and the lourie, which are only used by the king - and two &quot;assegais&quot; above it. In 2011, some versions of the flag began using black for the colour of the tassels to match the widowbirds’s natural colour.

The flag has a variant with lighter shades described by the government&#x27;s visual identity manual and regularly used on the government&#x27;s website and other social medias. Sometimes, a variant with black tassels, and white spears can also be seen during governmental press meetings and international affairs.

<text>Since gaining independence from France in 1946, Syria has used a number of different flags, all featuring the pan-Arab colors of green, black, white, and red. Initially a green, white and black triband charged with three red five-pointed stars, known as the Independence flag, was used. In Ba&#x27;athist Syria, this was replaced by the flag of the United Arab Republic with red, white and black tribands with either two or three green stars or charged with the national coat of arms. Following the fall of the Assad regime on 8 December 2024, the independence flag once again began to be used within the country by the Syrian parliament and the Syrian transitional government, and at Syrian embassies abroad.

== Historic flags of Syria ==
=== Kingdom of Syria (1920) ===
The Ottoman flag had been used in Syria until the Ottomans left the country on 18 September 1918. In 1918, the official flag of Syria was the Faysal flag, or Flag of the Arab Revolt, the flag of the 1916–1918 Arab Revolt against the Ottomans. It was officially adopted by the Hashemite family on 30 September 1918 and remained in use until 8 March 1920. This was the first flag to use the green/red/white/black combination seen in most subsequent Syrian flags. The colors&#x27; symbolism has been described as follows: white for the Damascene Umayyad period, green for the Caliph Ali, red for the Khawarij radical Islamic movement, and black for the Islamic prophet Muhammad, showing the &quot;political use of religion&quot; in opposition to the increasingly secularized Turkish colonial rule. Alternately, it has been argued that the horizontal colors stand for the Abbasid (black), Umayyad (white) and Fatimid (green) Caliphates and the red triangle to the Hashemite dynasty.

Under the Arab Kingdom of Syria, the Faisal flag was redesigned with a 7-pointed white star imposed on the red triangle, and was in use until 24 July 1920. This flag was, however, adopted by Jordan somewhat later.

=== French Mandate flags (1920–1932) ===

The Faysal flag was abandoned with the arrival of French colonials to Syria. The French High Commissioner for Syria, General Henri Gouraud adopted the new flag of the French Mandate of Syria (blue with a white crescent, see below) on 24 July 1920. The flag was based on the flag of the Shebab Emirate used between 1697 and 1842, which stood for &quot;the love of peace&quot;. Gouraud&#x27;s flag was in use until 1 September 1920, after which Syria was split into separate territories, each eventually given its own flag (see below). On 22 June 1922 Gouraud established the Federation of Syria, which used a green-white-green flag with a French flag canton. When this federation was consolidated into the State of Syria in 1925 the same flag continued to be used until the establishment of the republic on 14 May 1930.

=== Independence flag ===
The flag of the newly established Syrian Republic, under the French mandate was determined by the 1930 constitution. The constitution was drafted by a parliamentary committee led by nationalist leader Ibrahim Hananu. At first, French authorities refused to allow the constituent assembly to ratify the constitution, and Henri Ponsot, the High Commissioner of the Levant, dissolved the assembly on 5 February 1929. After a public uproar, French authorities rescinded their decision and decided to approve the draft with some changes. On 14 May 1930, Ponsot issued decree number 3111, which approved the Syrian-drafted &quot;Constitution of the Syrian Republic&quot;, and which in Article IV of Part I states:

The flag&#x27;s green colour stood for the Rashidun, white represented the Umayyads and black symbolised the Abbasids. Originally, the three red stars represented the three districts of Syria: the &quot;states&quot; of Aleppo, Damascus, and Deir ez-Zor. In 1936, the Sanjak of Latakia and Jebel Druze were added to Syria, and the representation of the three stars was changed, with the first representing the districts of Aleppo, Damascus and Deir ez-Zor, the second Jebel Druze, and the final star representing Sanjak of Latakia. The flag was used as a symbol for the desire for autonomy, for Syrians to rally around when France reneged on its agreement to leave the country, due to the outbreak of World War II. The symbolism was as follows: black for the dark oppressed past, white for a promising future and red for the blood to be sacrificed to move from the former to the latter. The flag was adopted when Syria gained its independence on 17 April 1946. The standard was used until the creation of the United Arab Republic, a state union of Syria and Egypt, in 1958. After the collapse of the United Arab Republic, Syria continued to use the UAR&#x27;s flag until 28 September 1961, when the independence flag was restored to disassociate Syria from the former failed union.

=== United Arab Republic and Ba&#x27;athist Syria ===

;United Arab Republic

Syria united with Egypt in February, 1958 to form the United Arab Republic (UAR). Gamal Abdel Nasser, who was the president of Egypt and later president of the UAR, introduced a new flag in April 1958 to replace the previous independence flag and promote Arab unity. The new flag featured red, white, and black horizontal bands from the Egyptian revolutionary flag, with two green stars representing Egypt and Syria. It was based on the Arab Liberation Flag of the Egyptian Revolution of 1952, which used four pan-Arab colours—black, green, white, and red—representing the Abbasid, Fatimid, Umayyad, and Hashemite dynasties. However, the new UAR flag had two stars to represent the two parts of the UAR.
;Ba&#x27;athist Syria
Following the 1963 Ba&#x27;athist coup d&#x27;état, a new flag was adopted by its Revolutionary Command Council on 8 March 1963, and was used until 1 January 1972. In February 1963, the Ba&#x27;athist regime came to power in Iraq as well, and the two Ba&#x27;athist governments began negotiations in Cairo in order to once again form a union between Egypt, Syria and Iraq. The process failed after the Iraqi Ba&#x27;athist government was overthrown in November 1963 but both Syria and Iraq did adopt a new flag to represent the union. This flag was not much different from the flag of the UAR, with only a change from two stars to three, in order to represent the addition of Iraq to the Federation. The three stars represented the unity of Egypt, Syria and Iraq, as well as three pillars of Ba&#x27;athism: unity, freedom, and socialism.

President Hafez al-Assad adopted a new flag on 1 January 1972, as Syria joined Egypt and Libya in the Federation of Arab Republics. The green stars were replaced by the Hawk of Quraish (the symbol of the tribe of Muhammad). The eagle held the ribbon with the name of the Federation, but unlike Egypt and Libya, Syria did not include its name on the coat of arms. This flag was an official flag during the Yom Kippur War in 1973. The Federation was dissolved in 1977, but Syria continued to use the flag for the next three years. The flag was abrogated on 29 March 1980, and replaced by the two-star flag in order to show Syria&#x27;s commitment to Arab unity.

The national flag of Ba&#x27;athist Syria used between 1980 until 2024 was first adopted in 1958 when Syria was part of the United Arab Republic, and was used until 1961. Since its first adoption, variations of the red-white-black flag have been used in various Arab Unions of Syria with Egypt, Libya, Sudan, Yemen, and Iraq. Although Syria is not part of any Arab state union, the flag of the United Arab Republic was readopted to show Syria&#x27;s commitment to Arab unity. The usage of the flag has become disputed because it is often associated with the Ba&#x27;ath Party and has come to represent parties loyal to Bashar al-Assad&#x27;s government in the Syrian civil war. Since the victory of the Syrian revolution and subsequent fall of the Assad regime in 2024, the flag is no longer in use but loyalists of the deposed Assad regime continue to use the Ba&#x27;athist Syrian flag in parts of Western Syria.

The Ba&#x27;athist Syrian flag is described in Article 6 of the Constitution of Syria. The first paragraph of the Article states:

===Early revival of the independence flag===
In 2006, Safouh Al Barazi, a lifelong Syrian activist and member of a prominent family from Hama, launched a campaign in Canada advocating for the adoption of the pre-Ba&#x27;athist Syrian flag. This flag, featuring green, white, and black horizontal stripes with three red stars, was originally used by Syria following its independence from French mandate rule in 1946. 

Al Barazi&#x27;s efforts aimed to symbolize a return to Syria&#x27;s democratic roots and to unify opposition against the ruling regime. His campaign gained momentum within Syrian communities in Canada, United States (Washington) and internationally, contributing to the flag&#x27;s resurgence as a symbol of the Syrian opposition during the civil uprising that began in 2011.

The “Independence flag” has since been widely adopted by various opposition groups and protesters, both within Syria and among the diaspora, representing aspirations for freedom and democratic governance. Al Barazi&#x27;s early advocacy in Canada and in Washington played a significant role in reintroducing this historic emblem to the forefront of the Syrian opposition movement.

===Syrian Revolution===

During the Syrian civil war, the Syrian opposition to Bashar al-Assad, represented by the Syrian National Council, then by the National Coalition of Syrian Revolutionary and Opposition Forces (commonly named the Syrian National Coalition) used the independence flag first used in 1932. The flag began to be used as a universal display of the protesting opposition in late 2011. The opposition wanted to distinguish themselves from the current Syrian government and favoured the use of the flag used when Syria gained its independence from France. Khaled Kamal, an official from the Syrian National Council, now believes this flag to also represent independence and the end of Bashar al-Assad&#x27;s government. Today the flag is mainly used in areas controlled by the Syrian National Coalition. The use of the modified independence flag is similar to the Libyan rebels&#x27; use of the pre-Gaddafi red-black-green-white Libyan flag from the era of the Kingdom of Libya in opposition to Muammar Gaddafi&#x27;s green flag.

Following the fall of the Assad regime, the HTS-dominated Syrian transitional government used the old independence flag. The flag was also adopted by the Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria some days later. The transitional government additionally displayed a &quot;Tawhid&quot; flag depicting the &quot;Shahada&quot; in black on a white field at its first meeting, which led to criticism for its association with Sunni extremist groups such as the Taliban. As of February 2025, the United Nations website continues to display the Ba&#x27;athist-era flag to represent Syria.

<text>The Indo-Gangetic Plain, also known as the Northern Plain or North Indian River Plain, is a fertile plain spanning across the northern and north-eastern part of the Indian subcontinent. It encompasses northern and eastern India, eastern Pakistan, southern Nepal, and almost all of Bangladesh. It is named after the two major river systems that drain the region–Indus and Ganges.

Its stretches from the Himalayas in the north to the northern edge of the Deccan plateau in the south, and extends from North East India in the east to the Iranian border in the west. The region is home to many major cities and nearly one-seventh of the world&#x27;s population. As the region was formed by the deposits of the three major rivers–Indus, Ganges and Brahmaputra, the plains consists of the world&#x27;s largest expanse of uninterrupted alluvium. Due to its rich water resources, it is one of the world&#x27;s most densely populated and intensely farmed areas.

== History ==
The region was home to the Indus Valley civilisation in 3000 BCE, which was one of the earliest human settlements in the Indian subcontinent. During the Vedic period (c. 1500 – 600 BCE), the region was referred to as &quot;Aryavarta&quot; (Land of the Aryans). According to &quot;Manusmṛti&quot; (2.22), &#x27;Aryavarta&#x27; is &quot;the tract between the Himalaya and the Vindhya ranges, from the Eastern Sea (Bay of Bengal) to the Western Sea (Arabian Sea)&quot;. The region was part of what was historically referred to as Hindustan, a term used to refer to the whole of the Indian subcontinent. The term &quot;Hindustani&quot; is also commonly used to refer to the people, music, and culture of the region.

The fertile terrain facilitated the rise and expansion of various empires such as the Mauryas, Kushan, Guptas, all of whom had their demographic and political centers in the Indo-Gangetic plain. The Maurya Empire existed from 4th to 2nd century BCE and unified most of the Indian subcontinent into one state, and was the largest empire ever to exist on the Indian subcontinent. The Kushan Empire expanded out of what is now Afghanistan into the northwest of the Indian subcontinent in the middle of the 1st century CE. Maritime trade along the Silk Road flourished during the period. The Gupta period existed from the 4th to 7th century CE and is noted for its arts, architecture and science.

In the 12th century CE, much of the region was ruled by the Rajputs. In 1191 CE, the Rajput king Prithviraj Chauhan unified several Rajput states and defeated the invading army of Shihabuddin Ghori in the First Battle of Tarain. However, Shihabuddin defeated the Rajputs in the Second Battle of Tarain, which led to the rise of the Delhi Sultanate in the region in the 13th century CE. In 1526 CE, Babur swept across the Khyber Pass and established the Mughal Empire, which ruled for almost the next three centuries.

The Maratha Empire founded by Chatrapati Shivaji, briefly captured the region in the early 18th century CE. The Sikh Empire was established by Ranjit Singh around the same time in the north western part of the region. The Europeans arrived in the end of the 15th century CE in peninsular India. The English East India company&#x27;s in the Battle of Plassey (1757) and Battle of Buxar (1767) consolidated the company&#x27;s power in the lower Gangetic plain. With the defeat of the Marathas, the entire region came under the control of British Raj and remained same until the Indian Independence in 1947.

== Geology ==
The plains were named after the two major river systems that drain the region–Indus and Ganges. The region was formed as a result of continuous deposition of silt by the major river systems of Indus, Ganges and Brahmaputra in the depression that existed between the Himalayas in the north and Deccan plateau in the south. However, there has been divergent theories as to the formation of the depression. As per Darashaw Wadia, the depression was a furrow that originally existed since the formation of the plateau in the south and the mountains in the north. Edward Suess had suggested that the depression was a large syncline that was formed when the southward advance of the Himalayas was blocked by the Indian landmass.

Sydney Burrard opined that the region was a deep rift that existed in the earth&#x27;s crust, which was subsequently filled with alluvium. He also pointed out the existence of other rift valleys in the Himalayan and Deccan plateau region. However, geologists such as Ferdinand Hayden and Richard Oldham have rejected this stating that there is no evidence of existence of a rift valley and that the existence of such a large rift valley is not possible. According to the recent research, sediment deposited at the bed of the per-historic Tethys Sea folded towards the northern end due to the northward drift of the Indian plate and a trough was formed later due to the emergence of the Himalayas in the north. Beneath the silt deposition, the region rests on hard crystalline rocks which connect the Himalayan region with the peninsula. As the region was formed by the deposits of major rivers, the plains consists of the world&#x27;s largest expanse of uninterrupted alluvium.

== Geography ==
The fertile plains span across the northern and north-eastern part of the Indian subcontinent. It encompasses northern and eastern India, eastern Pakistan, southern Nepal, and almost all of Bangladesh. Its stretches from the Himalayas in the north to the Vindhyas and Satpura and the Chota Nagpur Plateau in the south in the south, and extends from North East India in the east to the Iranian border in the west. The region is home to many major cities and nearly one-seventh of the world&#x27;s population. In India, it mainly encompasses the states and union territories of Rajasthan in the west, Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh, and Delhi in the north west, Uttar Pradesh in the north, Bihar and West Bengal in the east, and Assam in the north east.

The Indo-Gangetic Plain is divided into two drainage basins by the Delhi Ridge, which is a northern extension of the Aravalli Hills. The western part is drains by the Indus, and the eastern part consists of the Ganga–Brahmaputra river systems. The plains encompassed four distinct geographical regions:
* Bhabar: It is a narrow region about wide, located immediately below the foothills of the Himalayas. The stretch is highly porous and is largely made up of stones and rocks carried by the rivers. Most streams disappear underground in the region.
* Terai: It is the second strip that lies next to the Bhabar region. The region is largely made up of new silt deposited by the streams and rivers which reappear. It receives heavy rains for most of the year and consists of thick wet evergreen vegetation.
* Bangar: The third strip consists of older alluvium deposited by the rivers and forms the major fertile region of the flood plains. It also consists of laterite deposits.
* Khadir: The last region encompasses low-lying areas south of the Bangar belt. It is largely composed of new silt carried by the rivers while flowing through the upper part of the plains.

== Hydrography and climate ==
The region is drained by three major river systems and has a high ground water table. Due to its rich water resources and fertile alluvial soil, it is one of the world&#x27;s most densely populated and intensely farmed areas. The eastern part of the plain receives heavy rainfall during the monsoon after the summer, which commonly results in floods and inundations. The rainfall decreases from the east towards the west with the western region encompassing drier areas such as the Thar desert.

== Sub-divisions ==
The region can be sub-divided into various geographical units such as the Sindh Plains, and the Indus Delta in Pakistan; Rajasthan Plain, and Punjab-Haryana Plain in India and Pakistan, Ganga Plain in India and Bangladesh, Brahmaputra Valley in India, Terai region in Nepal, and the Ganges-Brahmaputra Delta in India and Bangladesh.

=== Sindh Plains ===

The Sindh Plains forms the western part of the plains and encompasses the Sindh region of Pakistan to the west of the Thar desert with the Punjab Plains in the north and the Indus River Delta in the south. The region receives about of rain annually, mostly from June to September. The economy is largely based on agriculture.

=== Indus Delta ===
The Indus River Delta encompasses the region where the Indus River flows into the Arabian Sea. Most of the delta lies in the southern Sindh province of Pakistan with a small portion in the Kutch region of India. The delta covers an area of about , and is approximately across where it meets the sea. The climate is arid, the region receives only of rainfall. Since the 1940s, the delta has received less water as a result of large-scale irrigation works capturing large amounts of the Indus water before it reaches the delta. The region is home to the largest arid mangrove forests in the world. The population of the active part of the delta was estimated at 900,000 in 2003 with fishing being the major industry.

=== Rajasthan Plain ===
The Rajasthan Plains form the western extreme of the plains in India and is mostly composed of Thar desert, which occupies an area of stretching across . About three-fourth of the plains lie in India and rest in Pakistan. In India, two-thirds of the region is part of western Rajasthan, extending to the west of Aravalli Hills and rest form parts of Haryana, Punjab and Gujarat. The region has an average elevation of which reduces from east to west, reaching about towards the Indus delta and the Rann of Kutch. The western part of the region is covered by shifting sand dunes (dharian) and the eastern part of the region (Rajasthan Bagar) is rocky. The region is largely arid with seasonal streams uch as Luni supporting limited agriculture.

=== Punjab and Haryana Plain ===
The Punjab-Haryana Plain lies to the east and north east of the Rajasthan Plain. It extends for a length of in a north west to south east orientation till the Aravalli Hills and is about wide stretching from Haryana in India into Pakistan&#x27;s Punjab Province. The elevation varies from in the north to in the south west. The left quarter of the region is drained mainly by the tributaries of Indus–Ravi, Beas, and Sutlej and the Yamuna waters a small portion on the eastern border. The in-between land which encompasses the city of Delhi, largely consists of no major streams except the seasonal Ghaggar River. The region has a humid sub tropical climate with dry winters and receives the major part of rainfall during the south west monsoon between July and September.

=== Ganga Plain ===
The Ganga Plain forms the largest sub-unit of the plains and encompasses an area of across the states of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, and West Bengal. The Ganges along with its tributaries such as the Yamuna, Gomti, Ghagara, Gandak, Chambal, Kosi, and Sone drain the region. The various rivers and streams originating from both the Himalayas and the Deccan Plateau contribute to fertile soil in the region. The region gently slopes towards the south east and consists of three regions: Upper, Middle and Lower Ganga Plains. The Upper Ganga Plain stretches from the Shivalik range in the north and the Deccan Plateau in the south with the Yamuna River forming the rough western boundary. The region extends in the north–south direction and is about wide with an average elevation of .

The Middle Ganga Plain stretches to the east of the Upper Ganga plain and forms part of eastern Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. It covers an area of , stretching in north–south direction and in the east–west direction. The elevation varies from in the western boundary to towards the south east. This plain is largely drained by Ghaghara, Gandak and Kosi rivers. The Lower Ganga Plain includes parts of Bihar, West Bengal and most of Bangladesh. It stretches for along a stretch from the foothills of the Himalayas in the north to the Bay of Bengal in the south, and extends between the Chota Nagpur Plateau in the west and Bangladesh&#x27;s eastern boundary with India. The average elevation is along the western boundary.

=== Brahmaputra Valley ===
The Brahmaputra Valley largely covers the Indian state of Assam and is an eastern extension of the plains. It stretches from the Eastern Himalayas in Arunachal Pradesh in the north, to the Garo-Khasi-Jaintia and Mikir Hills in the south. Its has the Patkai and Naga Hills to the east and the boundary of the Lower Ganga Plain to the west. The region covers an estimated and is watered by Brahmaputra and its tributaries. The elevation varies from in the east to in the west.

=== Ganges-Brahmaputra Delta ===
The Ganges-Brahmaputra Delta is the river delta formed by the Ganges and Brahmaputra rivers when they enter the Bay of Bengal. Spread over the Bengal region, consisting of Bangladesh and the Indian state of West Bengal, it is the world&#x27;s largest river delta and is one of the most fertile regions of the plains. The delta stretches from about from the Hooghly River east to the Meghna River in the west. It encompasses an area of more than with two-thirds of it in Bangladesh. It is also one of the most densely populated regions in the world with more than 130 million inhabitants. The area is prone to heavy tropical cyclones. Agriculture and fishing form important part of the economy in the region.

<text>The national flag of Tajikistan () was adopted in November 1992, replacing the flag of the Tajik Soviet Socialist Republic of 1953. The flag features Iranian colors in a horizontal tricolor of red, white, and green, with a yellow crown surmounted by an arc of seven stars at the centre. It has a width ratio of 2:3:2. The tricolor preserves the choice of colors in the former Tajik Soviet flag, as well as the 1:2 proportions.

The flag day is celebrated on 24 November, which is the day it was officially adopted.

==Design and symbolism==
The flag of Tajikistan is a tricolour of red, white, and green. The red represents the unity of the nation as well as victory and sunrise. The red also serves as symbolism of the former Russian and Soviet eras, the workers, and the warriors who sacrificed their lives to protect the land. The white represents purity, morality, the snow and ice of the mountains, and cotton. The green represents the bountiful generosity of nature, fertile valleys, the religion of Islam, and the celebration of Novruz. Other interpretations of the colours state that the flag symbolically unifies the people of Tajik society, with the red stripe representing the manual labour class, the white stripe representing the intellectual worker class, and the green representing the agricultural class living in Tajikistan&#x27;s rural or mountainous regions.

While the red and green stripes on the top and bottom are equal in size, the center stripe is one-and-a-half times that of the others.

The crown and stars are set in a rectangle taking up 80% of the white stripe&#x27;s height.
The crown represents the Samanid dynasty and Tajik people, as the name &quot;Tajik&quot; is connected with Persian &quot;tâj&quot; &quot;crown&quot; in popular etymology. The flag of Tajikistan features seven stars due to the significance of the number seven in Persian mythology, representing perfection and happiness. According to traditional belief, the heavens feature seven mountains and seven orchard gardens with a star shining above each mountain.

==Presidential standard==

The standard of the president of Tajikistan was introduced in 2006, on the occasion of the inauguration ceremony for the third term of Emomali Rahmon as head of state. 
It uses the Tajik tricolour charged with a depiction of the &quot;Derafsh Kāviān&quot;, the Sassanid royal standard. Inside the &quot;Derafsh Kāviān&quot; is a depiction of a winged lion against a blue sky under a smaller representation of the crown and seven stars.

The center of the standard features elements formerly used as symbols of Tajikistan in the Emblem of Tajikistan. The presidential standard also includes a star in each of the four corners to represent the four regions of Tajikistan.

==Historical flags==
Under Soviet rule, the Union Republic used a flag derived from the flag of the Soviet Union and representing Communism, that was approved in 1953. The flag is similar to the Soviet Union design but with the addition of a white and a green stripe. This flag also contains the red-white-green color order where the white stripe is larger than the green, which is currently used in the national flag.

As a Soviet republic, the red symbolized the workers&#x27; revolution, the white symbolized cotton, and the green symbolized agriculture.

The Soviet era flag was two-sided. Its backside was a mirror of the obverse face without the hammer, sickle, and star. This design remained in use until the new Tajik flag was adopted, making Tajikistan the last former Soviet country to receive a new flag.
