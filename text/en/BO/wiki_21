<text> (, ; lit. &quot;Latest News&quot;) is an Israeli daily newspaper published in Tel Aviv. Founded in 1939, when Tel Aviv was part of Mandatory Palestine, is Israel&#x27;s largest paid newspaper by sales and circulation and has been described as &quot;undoubtedly the country&#x27;s number-one paper.&quot; It is published in the tabloid format.

It is known as centrist, compared to the left-leaning &quot;Ha&#x27;aretz&quot; and right-leaning, distributed-for-free &quot;Israel Hayom&quot; newspapers in Israel.

==History==
=== 1939–1948: Foundation and expansion ===
 was established in 1939 by an investor named . It was the first evening paper in Mandatory Palestine, and attempted to emulate the format of the &quot;London Evening Standard&quot;. Running into financial difficulties, Komarov sold the paper to , a wealthy land dealer who regarded the paper as an interesting hobby and a long-term financial investment. His sons Reuben and Noah ran the paper, with Noah as the first managing editor.

=== 1948–1984: In competition with Maariv ===
In 1948, a large group of journalists and staff members led by chief editor Ezriel Carlebach left to form &quot;Yedioth Maariv,&quot; shortly later known as &quot;Maariv&quot;. According to Carlebach and his associates, their reason for leaving was Mozes&#x27; interference in their editorial decisions. He was replaced as chief editor by Herzl Rosenblum. Carelbach is considered the most prominent journalist of his era and his and his associates&#x27; departure from &quot;Yedioth&quot; is commonly known in Israeli media history as &quot;The Putsch&quot;, or the coup. This began an ongoing battle for circulation and prestige between the rival newspapers, which peaked during the 1990s when both papers were discovered to have bugged one another&#x27;s phones. In the first decades following Carlebach&#x27;s departure, &quot;Maariv&quot;″s circulation greatly outnumbered &quot;Yedioth&quot;″s although over the years &quot;Yedioth&quot;″s readership grew steadily and by the early 1980s its circulation eclipsed &quot;Maariv&quot;″s and made it the country&#x27;s largest newspaper. This success was in large part thanks to the efforts of Dov Yudkovski, a distant cousin of Mozes and Holocaust survivor who joined &quot;Yedioth&quot; following &quot;the Putsch&quot; in 1948, serving as editorial manager between 1953 and 1986, and chief editor between 1986 and 1989. Although officially Rosenblum held the title of chief editor between 1948 and 1986, his duties only extended to writing the paper&#x27;s leading editorial article while Yudkovski acted as chief editor in practice.

=== 1984–1993: In competition with &quot;Hadashot&quot; ===
On March 4, 1984, a new competitor to &quot;Yediot Ahronoth&quot; was established, the &quot;Hadashot&quot; newspaper founded by Amos Schocken. &quot;Hadashot&quot; featured a large color headline and color pages, and used more innovative and less formal language. Its main target audience were the readers of &quot;Yediot Ahronot&quot;, a situation that required &quot;Yediot Ahronot&quot; to react in order to maintain its readers and market position. &quot;Yediot&quot; editor Moshe Vardi, together with Noni Mozes, led the transition of the newspaper to printing in color. Zeev Galili, appointed head of reporters, recruited a series of freelance reporters from other newspapers, and worked to improve the newspaper&#x27;s ability to obtain scoops. The changes in &quot;Yediot Ahronot&quot; paid off, and &quot;Hadashot&quot; was forced to close after nine years of activity, after heavy losses for the Schocken family.

=== 1993–2007: Back in control ===
For his achievements, Yudkovski was awarded the Sokolov Prize for Journalism in 2000 and the 2002 Israel Prize in Communications.

Moshi Vardi was replaced as editor in 2005 by Rafi Ginat. Shilo De-Beer was promoted to editor in April 2007.

=== Since 2007: In competition with &quot;Israel Hayom&quot; ===
In 2007, &quot;Israel Hayom&quot;, a free newspaper owned by the family of casino mogul Sheldon Adelson, was launched. By July 2010, &quot;Israel Hayom&quot; had overtaken as the most read newspaper in terms of exposure with a rate of 35.2% compared to &quot;Yedioth&quot;&#x27;s 34.9%.

De-Beer was replaced as editor by Ron Yaron in 2011. As of 2017, the paper is headed by Noah Mozes&#x27;s son, Arnon Mozes. In January 2017, secret recordings were released of conversations between Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Mozes discussing a potential deal in which the newspaper would provide better coverage of Netanyahu in exchange for the government limiting the circulation of competitor &quot;Israel Hayom&quot;. This led to the opening of &quot;Case 2000&quot; corruption investigation against Netanyahu.

==Ownership==
The newspaper is owned by the Yedioth Ahronoth Group, which also owns shares in several Israeli mass media companies, such as &quot;Channel 2&quot;, a commercial television channel; &quot;Hot&quot;, the national cable TV company; &quot;Yedioth Tikshoret&quot;, a group of weekly local newspapers; &quot;Vesti&quot;, a Russian language newspaper; magazines, such as the weekly TV guide magazine &quot;Pnai Plus&quot; and weekly women&#x27;s magazine &quot;La&#x27;Isha&quot;; and other non-media companies.

 has its own publishing house called &quot;Yedioth Sfarim&quot; (Hebrew ידיעות ספרים).

==Circulation and reputation==
As of July 31, 2023, a TGI survey indicated that &quot;Israel Hayom&quot;, distributed for free, is Israel&#x27;s most read newspaper, with a 29.4% weekday readership exposure, followed by &quot;Yedioth Ahronoth&quot;, with 22.3%, &quot;Haaretz&quot; with 4.8%, &quot;Globes&quot; with 4% and &quot;Maariv&quot; with 3.9%.

In 2006, &quot;Yedioth Ahronoth&quot; was the most widely-read newspaper among both native Hebrew and Arabic speakers.

According to one author, its marketing strategy emphasizes &quot;drama and human interest over sophisticated analysis.&quot;

In 2003, the co-founder of Aswat, an organization supporting lesbian Palestinian women, was outed by the Yedioth Ahronoth after agreeing to an interview, despite asking for her sexual orientation not be included in the article, which led to significant personal backlash.

==Editorial stance==
&quot;Haaretz&quot; wrote in 2021 that &quot;Yedioth Ahronoth&quot; publisher Arnon Mozes &quot;held three series of meetings in which they discussed advancing their interests: Netanyahu sought favorable coverage in the publications of the Yedioth Ahronoth group, while Mozes sought to restrict a competing newspaper – &quot;Yisrael Hayom&quot;, a free daily owned by the Jewish-American businessman and political donor Sheldon Adelson&quot;.

The paper describes itself as the &quot;nation&#x27;s newspaper&quot; and generally offers editorial space to views across the Israeli political spectrum. &quot;The Forward&quot; has described Yedioth Ahronoth as centrist compared to the right-leaning &quot;Ma&#x27;ariv&quot; and left-leaning &quot;Ha&#x27;aretz&quot;.

 has been described as generally critical of Benjamin Netanyahu. A study conducted by Moran Rada with the Israeli Democracy Institute showed that &quot;Yedioth&quot;″s coverage of the 2009 Israeli legislative election was biased in favor of Kadima and its leader Tzipi Livni in most editorial decisions, and that the paper chooses to play down events that do not help to promote a positive image for her, while on the other hand, touting and inflating events that help promote Livni and her party. Oren Frisco reached a similar conclusion after the 2009 Knesset elections, writing that throughout the campaign, &quot;Yediot Ahronoth&quot; was biased against Netanyahu.

<text>Maria Geraldine Smith (born 29 August 1961) is a former British Labour Party politician who was the Member of Parliament for Morecambe and Lunesdale from 1997 to 2010.

==Early life==
She was educated at Morecambe High School and Lancaster and Morecambe College, where she gained a Diploma in Business Studies. Her first campaign was supported by the Communication Workers Union, for which she was formerly an officer. Prior to becoming taking office, she worked for the Royal Mail from 1980 to 1997, and was a member of Lancaster City Council.

==Parliamentary career==
After the Labour Party&#x27;s poor showing in the local government elections of 4 May 2006 she was linked to a campaign on a timetable for Tony Blair&#x27;s departure as Prime Minister and also expressed a preference for Gordon Brown to succeed him. She also found &quot;outrageous&quot; the survival of John Prescott as a government minister following the reshuffle. She said that she believed William Hague would be the next Conservative Prime Minister, rather than David Cameron. In August 2009, she criticised the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 2008 which conferred legal parenthood on a biological mother&#x27;s female partner, saying &quot;To have a birth certificate with two mothers and no father is just madness.&quot; Smith was a member of the All-Party Parliamentary Flag Group.

On Wednesday 17 September 2008, Smith was interviewed by Tony Livesey on BBC Radio Lancashire&#x27;s Breakfast Show; she attacked the so-called &quot;Lancashire Mafia&quot; for their plot against Prime Minister Gordon Brown, and accused those behind the scenes of being cowards.

Smith narrowly lost her seat to the Conservative David Morris in the general election in May 2010.

==Personal life==
Geraldine Smith was the Patron of the Morecambe Bay National Osteoporosis Society Support Group until 2010.

Geraldine Smith was the President of 455 (Morecambe and Heysham) Squadron Air Training Corps until 2010 when she regretfully to its members stood down after a number of years as an ambassador to youth development in the area. The Air Training Corps is a youth organisation sponsored by the Royal Air Force for local youth between the ages of 13 and 18 giving them opportunities to learn new skills and support their local community.

<text>Jacqueline Jill Smith, Baroness Smith of Malvern, (born 3 November 1962), is a British politician, broadcaster and life peer who has been serving as Minister of State for Skills and Government spokesperson for Equalities since 2024. A member of the Labour Party, she was Member of Parliament (MP) for Redditch from 1997 to 2010. Smith previously served as Home Secretary under Gordon Brown from 2007 to 2009 and was the first woman to hold the position.

Smith was born and raised in Malvern, Worcestershire. She attended Hertford College, Oxford, before training to become a teacher at Worcester College of Higher Education and having a career as an economics and business studies teacher. She was elected for Redditch at the 1997 general election. She joined the government in 1999 and served in a series of ministerial positions under Prime Minister Tony Blair. In the 2006 cabinet reshuffle she was promoted to Chief Whip.

Following the formation of the Brown ministry in 2007, Smith became the first female Home Secretary. She resigned as Home Secretary in June 2009 following her involvement in the parliamentary expenses scandal in which she had falsely claimed that a room in her sister&#x27;s house was her main home; she was also the subject of controversy after it emerged that her husband had used taxpayer money to purchase pornographic videos. Smith, one of the highest profile figures involved in the scandal, then lost her seat as MP for Redditch in the 2010 general election. Between leaving the House of Commons and rejoining the government in 2024, she remained in public life as a political pundit and took up roles in various other sectors, such as health and media.

==Early life and career==
Smith was born in Malvern, Worcestershire. She attended Dyson Perrins High School in Malvern. Her parents were teachers, and both Labour councillors, although her mother briefly joined the Social Democratic Party. Her local MP, Conservative backbencher Michael Spicer, recalled in Parliament in 2003 how he had first met her when he addressed the sixth form at The Chase School, where her mother was a teacher; he joked: &quot;So great was my eloquence that she immediately rushed off and joined the Labour Party.&quot; Smith obtained a place to study philosophy, politics and economics at Hertford College, Oxford.

After graduating, she moved to London and worked as a researcher for Labour MP Terry Davis.

Deciding she wanted a career outside politics, Smith moved out of London and gained a Postgraduate Certificate in Education from Worcester College of Higher Education. Working as a school teacher, she taught economics at Arrow Vale High School in Redditch from 1986 to 1988 and at Worcester Sixth Form College, before becoming head of economics and General National Vocational Qualification co-ordinator at Haybridge High School, Hagley in 1990. During this time Smith held positions in the local Labour party and campaigned on behalf of the party.

Smith worked as secretary of the National Organisation of Labour Students and describes herself as having a &quot;feminist background&quot;. She served on Redditch Borough Council from 1991 to 1996, where she chaired the development committee. Smith was unsuccessful in an attempt to be elected as (Labour) MP for the safe Conservative seat of Mid Worcestershire in the 1992 general election, despite achieving a 4.9% swing. In early 1997 she was identified by &quot;The Independent&quot; as a potential future cabinet member.

==Political career==

===Member of Parliament===
Smith was selected through an all-women shortlist as the Labour candidate for Redditch, a new constituency created after a boundary review. She won the seat in the 1997 general election, as part of a then-record number of female MPs elected to the House of Commons.

Smith entered the Government in July 1999, as a Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State at the Department for Education and Employment, working with the Minister for School Standards Estelle Morris. She then became a Minister of State at the Department of Health after the 2001 general election. She was appointed as deputy Minister for Women in 2003, working alongside Secretary of State Patricia Hewitt. In this role she published the government&#x27;s proposals for same-sex civil partnerships, a system designed to offer same-sex couples an opportunity to gain legal recognition for their relationships with an associated set of rights and responsibilities.

In the 2005 general election Smith had a majority of just 2,716 (6.7% of the vote), owing to boundary changes.

===Minister for Schools===
Following the 2005 general election, Smith was appointed Minister of State for Schools at the Department for Education and Skills, replacing Stephen Twigg who had lost his seat. Teacher trade union sources stated that Smith &quot;talked to us on our level&quot;.

===Chief Whip===
In the 2006 cabinet reshuffle Smith was appointed as the government&#x27;s Chief Whip. In a period when supporters of Gordon Brown were pushing Prime Minister Tony Blair to resign, she was successfully able to calm the situation down. The BBC&#x27;s political editor Nick Robinson described her as being effective at &quot;making peace between the warring Blair and Brown factions&quot;.

Smith was regarded as a loyal Blairite during Tony Blair&#x27;s premiership, a position reflected in her voting record, and she was brought to tears by Blair&#x27;s farewell appearance in the House of Commons.

===Home Secretary===
In Gordon Brown&#x27;s first cabinet reshuffle on 28 June 2007, Smith expressed interest in becoming Secretary of State for Education, but was appointed Home Secretary. She became the first woman to hold the position and the third woman to hold one of the Great Offices of State, after Margaret Thatcher (Prime Minister) and Margaret Beckett (Foreign Secretary). Just one day into her new job bombs were found in London, and a terrorist attack took place in Glasgow the following day.

On 24 January 2008, she announced new powers for the police, including the proposal to permit law enforcement services to hold terrorist suspects or those linked to terrorism for up to 42 days without charging them. In the same month Smith said that she would not feel safe on the streets of London at night. Critics suggested her statements were an admission that the government had failed to tackle crime effectively. Smith also introduced legislation to toughen the prostitution laws of England and Wales, making it a criminal offence to pay for sex with a prostitute controlled by a pimp, with the possibility that anyone caught paying for sex with an illegally trafficked woman could face criminal charges.

Smith introduced a crime mapping scheme to allow citizens of England and Wales to access local crime information and how to combat crime. As Home Secretary, she was able to announce that minor crime dropped year-on-year under the Labour government, and continued to do so in 2008.

Smith managed to pass the 42-day detention law plans in the House of Commons, despite heavy opposition. The House of Lords voted overwhelmingly against the law, with some of the Lords reportedly characterising it as &quot;fatally flawed, ill-thought-through and unnecessary&quot;, stating that &quot;it seeks to further erode fundamental legal and civil rights&quot;. In March 2009, Smith published the first ever public Counter Terror Strategy.

When Conservative MP Damian Green was arrested in his Commons office, Smith stated that she was not informed of the impending arrest. The Metropolitan Police said that Green was &quot;arrested on suspicion of conspiring to commit misconduct in a public office and aiding and abetting, counselling or procuring misconduct in a public office&quot;. A junior Home Office official, Christopher Galley, was later arrested regarding the same alleged offences as Green, and was released on bail. He was not charged, but he was suspended from his Home Office job while the investigation continued. He was later dismissed from his position for gross misconduct. Green did not dispute having dealings with the Home Office official.

In March 2009, at the height of the expenses furore, a leaked poll of Labour Party members revealed that Smith was considered to be the worst performing member of the Cabinet, with only 56% of her party believing she was doing a good job.

==== National identity legislation ====

In May 2009, Smith announced that the cost of introducing the National Identity Card project, had risen to an estimated £5.3 billion, and that it would first become compulsory for foreign students and airport staff. It was planned that the cards would be made available from high-street shops at an estimated cost of £60. Smith defended her decision to use high-street shops, and stated that the hope was to make enrolment in the scheme a less intimidating experience and to make the cards easier to access. She claimed, despite evidence to the contrary, that the majority of the population was in favour of the scheme. In another privacy-related issue, Smith said she was disappointed at the European Court of Human Rights&#x27; decision to strike down a law allowing the government to store the DNA and fingerprints of people with no criminal record; in December 2008 an estimated 850,000 such DNA samples were being held in England and Wales. Her compromise was to scale down the length of time that data could be kept, with a maximum limit of 12 years. This went against the spirit of the Court&#x27;s decision.

==== Drug policy ====
On 19 July 2007, Smith admitted to smoking cannabis a few times in Oxford in the 1980s. &quot;I did break the law... I was wrong... drugs are wrong&quot;, she said. Asked why students today should listen when she urged them not to try the drug, she said that the dangers of cannabis use had become clearer, including mental health issues and the increasing strength of the drug over the past 25 years. Smith&#x27;s admission was made public the day after Gordon Brown appointed her head of a new government review of UK drugs strategy.

In May 2008, against the recommendations of her own scientific advisers, Smith reversed the government&#x27;s 2004 decision to downgrade cannabis to a class C drug, returning it to the status of class B, with the law change taking effect on 26 January 2009. According to her most senior expert drugs adviser Professor David Nutt, the following exchange took place between Smith and himself:
In February 2009, Smith was accused by Nutt of making a political decision in rejecting the scientific advice to downgrade ecstasy from a class A drug. The advisory council on the misuse of drugs (ACMD) report on ecstasy, based on a 12-month study of 4,000 academic papers, concluded that it is nowhere near as dangerous as other class A drugs such as heroin and crack cocaine, and should be downgraded to class B alongside amphetamines and cannabis. The advice was not followed; the government saying that it was &quot;not prepared to send a message to young people that we take ecstasy less seriously&quot;. Smith was also widely criticised by the scientific community for bullying Professor Nutt into apologising for his factual comments that, in the course of a normal year, more people died from falling off horses than died from taking ecstasy.

====Exclusion list====
On 5 May 2009, Smith named 16 &quot;undesirable individuals&quot;, including convicted murderers and advocates of violence, who were to be banned from entering the United Kingdom over their alleged threat to public order. Controversially, the exclusion list included outspoken American talk radio host Michael Savage, who instructed London lawyers to sue Smith for &quot;serious and damaging defamatory allegations&quot;.

A Home Office spokeswoman said: &quot;The home secretary has made it clear that if such a case was brought that any legal proceedings would be robustly defended.&quot;
Smith defended the choice of individuals by declaring, &quot;If you can&#x27;t live by the rules that we live by, the standards and the values that we live by, we should exclude you from this country and, what&#x27;s more, now we will make public those people that we have excluded.&quot; &quot;The Guardian&quot; criticised Smith&#x27;s actions.

====Expenses controversies and resignation====

Smith was investigated by the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards over accusations that she had inappropriately designated her sister&#x27;s home in London as her main residence. The arrangement had allowed Smith to claim over £116,000 on her family&#x27;s Redditch home since becoming an MP. Smith said that she had followed advice from parliamentary authorities.

On 8 February 2009, it was reported in the media that Smith had designated a house in London owned by her sister as her main residence in order to claim a parliamentary allowance for her house in Redditch as a secondary home, despite explicitly stating on her website that she &quot;lives in Redditch&quot;. When asked whether it was fair that she made claims believed to have been made for items such as a flat-screen TV and scatter cushions, she said that analyses of her receipts had been very particular. In response to criticisms over her housing allowances, she said it was the &quot;nature of the job&quot; that MPs had to furnish and run two properties.

It was also reported that Smith had claimed expenses for a telecoms bill that contained two pornographic films and two other pay-per-view films. Smith said it was a mistake, and she would repay the amount. The reports made clear that the films had been viewed in the family home at a time when Smith was not present, and that she had given her husband, Richard Timney, a &quot;real ear-bashing&quot; over the incident. This and other cases prompted calls for reform of the additional costs allowance and a new system of payments to be introduced. Gordon Brown supported her and said she had done nothing wrong. However, Sir Alistair Graham, the former chairman of the Committee on Standards in Public Life, was critical of her actions, stating that naming her sister&#x27;s spare bedroom as her main home was &quot;near fraudulent&quot;. Smith was one of the highest profile politicians involved in the expenses scandal and citing the impact on her family life she later resigned.

In October 2009, it was reported that the Standards Commissioner, John Lyon, had looked into complaints over her expense claims. He concluded that, although her London home was a genuine home and she had spent more nights there than in her Redditch home, her constituency home was in fact her main home, and that she was in breach of Commons rules, despite &quot;significant mitigating circumstances&quot;. The claims for pay-per-view films were also found to be in breach. Ms Smith was not asked to repay any money, but was told to &quot;apologise to the House by means of a personal statement.&quot; Smith reacted by saying that she was &quot;disappointed that this process has not led to a fairer set of conclusions, based on objective and consistent application of the rules as they were at the time.&quot;

In an interview with &quot;Radio Times&quot; published in February 2011, Smith claimed that her expenses had been scrutinised because she was a woman, saying: &quot;[I] know that it was my expenses people looked at first because I was a woman and should have been at home looking after my husband and children.&quot; Smith said that she had felt &quot;frozen rather than angry&quot; on learning that her husband had entered a parliamentary expenses claim for two pornographic films.

On 2 June 2009, Smith confirmed that she would leave the Cabinet in the next reshuffle, expected after the local and European elections. She left office on 5 June and returned to the backbenches. She was replaced by Alan Johnson. In a subsequent interview with &quot;Total Politics&quot; magazine regarding her time as Home Secretary, Smith described how she felt under-qualified for her ministerial roles, adding &quot;when I became Home Secretary, I&#x27;d never run a major organisation. I hope I did a good job. But if I did, it was more by luck than by any kind of development of skills. I think we should have been better trained. I think there should have been more induction.&quot; Smith&#x27;s major achievements as Home Secretary were introduction of tougher prostitution laws, a reduction in crime rates and promotion of Police Community Support Officers. Journalist Andrew Pierce echoed Smith&#x27;s comments about her unsuitability for the position of home secretary, going further by stating: &quot;Smith, beset by gaffes and errors, was hopelessly out of her depth in one of the most demanding jobs in politics&quot;.

===Leaving Parliament===
In the general election on 6 May 2010, Smith lost her seat as MP for Redditch to Karen Lumley of the Conservative Party, who won the seat with a majority of 5,821 votes. Smith said that she had been &quot;immensely honoured&quot; to serve Redditch. Smith wrote an open letter to the new Conservative home secretary Theresa May, advising her that the post was often seen as a &quot;poisoned chalice&quot;.

== After politics (2010–2024) ==
In 2010, she began working as a consultant for KPMG and as an adviser to Sarina Russo Job Access. She applied to be vice-chairman of the BBC Trust. Smith presented a documentary on pornography, for BBC Radio 5 Live, called &quot;Porn Again&quot; which was broadcast on 3 March 2011. It was followed by a special edition of the Tony Livesey show, discussing pornography.
She regularly appeared on &quot;This Week&quot; and &quot;Question Time&quot;, and was also a regular weekly commentator on Sky News&#x27; &quot;Press Preview&quot;. She also contributed to &quot;The Purple Book&quot; in 2011, putting forward new ideas on crime and policing.

On 24 August 2011 it emerged that Smith had arranged for two prisoners on day-release to paint a room in her house, when they were supposed to be undertaking work to benefit the community. The Ministry of Justice launched an internal investigation into the matter, and Smith made a donation to the charity overseeing the scheme. The episode was condemned by Matthew Elliot of the TaxPayers&#x27; Alliance, who stated: &quot;It&#x27;s a disgrace that a former home secretary has used prisoners as her personal handymen&quot;.

Smith previously co-hosted a weekly show on talk radio station LBC alongside former Conservative cabinet minister David Mellor – she took over from Ken Livingstone after he left to contest the London mayoral race of 2012. She became chair of University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust in December 2013, though in 2020 she stepped down from this role temporarily to perform in &quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot;.

Smith publicly supported the campaign for the UK to remain in the European Union in the 2016 EU referendum, and continued to argue for a second referendum on the issue until the 2019 general election.

Since 2017, Smith has co-hosted a weekly political and current affairs podcast, entitled For The Many, alongside LBC broadcaster Iain Dale. She has appeared on &quot;Good Morning Britain&quot; on ITV. She is also the chair of both the Jo Cox Foundation and the Sandwell Children&#x27;s Trust.

In September 2020, it was announced that Smith would compete in the eighteenth series of &quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot;. She was partnered with Anton Du Beke, and became the first celebrity to be voted off the show.

In 2021 she was appointed as chair of both Barts Health NHS Trust and Barking, Havering and Redbridge University Hospitals NHS Trust.

== Return to politics as a member of the House of Lords ==
Following Labour&#x27;s victory in the 2024 general election, Prime Minister Keir Starmer appointed Smith Minister of State for Skills; a life peerage was conferred on her to allow her to hold the position. She was ennobled on the 17 July 2024 with the title Baroness Smith of Malvern, &quot;of Malvern in the County of Worcestershire&quot;.

Smith was introduced to the House of Lords on 18 July 2024. She made her maiden speech in the Lords on 19 July during a debate on the King&#x27;s Speech.

==Personal life==

Smith married Richard Timney in October 1987 and they have two sons. While an MP, Smith employed her husband as her parliamentary aide on a salary of £40,000. In January 2020, she and Timney announced they had ended their marriage.

==Honours==
* 2003: Appointed to the Privy Council of the United Kingdom, giving her the honorific title &quot;The Right Honourable&quot; for life.
* 2013: She was recognized as one of the BBC&#x27;s 100 women.

<text>John Francis Spellar, Baron Spellar, (born 5 August 1947), is a British politician who served as Member of Parliament (MP) for Warley, formerly Warley West, from 1992 to 2024. A member of the Labour Party, he previously represented Birmingham Northfield from 1982 to 1983. He served as a minister in various departments between 1997 and 2005, and as Comptroller of the Household in the Whips&#x27; Office between 2008 and 2010. After Labour entered opposition, he served as a shadow Foreign Office minister from 2010 to 2015.

==Early life==
Spellar was born in Bromley and educated at Dulwich College and St Edmund Hall, Oxford. He was Chairman of the Oxford University Labour Club in 1967.

Spellar was the Political Officer of the Electrical, Electronic, Telecommunications and Plumbing Union (EETPU) from 1969 to 1992, and was a speech-writer for general secretaries Frank Chapple and Eric Hammond. As a young union officer he attended, along with John Golding and Roger Godsiff, the St Ermin&#x27;s group of senior trade union leaders who organised to prevent the Bennite left taking over the party in the years 1981–1987.

He was a councillor in the London Borough of Bromley between 1970 and 1974.

==Parliamentary career==
Spellar stood for the constituency of Bromley at the 1970 general election as Labour&#x27;s youngest candidate.

He was first elected to the House of Commons in the 1982 Birmingham Northfield by-election but lost at the 1983 general election to the Conservative candidate, Roger King. At the 1987 general election he stood again for the same seat but was again unsuccessful against King. Spellar returned to the House of Commons in the 1992 general election becoming the MP for Warley West with a majority of 5,472, and was appointed an opposition whip. Following a period as opposition spokesman for Northern Ireland in 1994, he was moved to shadow Defence minister in 1995.

At the 1997 general election, Spellar was elected as MP for the new Warley constituency, after Warley West had been abolished in a boundary review. In the new Labour government, he was appointed Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State at the Ministry of Defence, being promoted to become Minister of State for the Armed Forces in 1999. In 2001, he was appointed to the Privy Council, as Minister of State for Transport in the Department for Transport, Local Government and the Regions with rights to attend Cabinet. After the 2002 reshuffle, he became Minister of State at the Department for Transport, and moved to the Northern Ireland Office in 2003. He was banned from the offices of both the Mayor of Derry and the Mayor of Belfast during that year, because he supported the reinstatement to the British Army of convicted murderers Mark Wright and James Fisher of the Scots Guards. He left the front benches in 2005, but in 2008, he rejoined the government as a whip (Comptroller of the Household) and served until Labour entered opposition in May 2010.

In November 2015, Spellar he suggested that Jeremy Corbyn should resign as Labour leader over the question of whether to conduct air strikes on ISIL in Syria. Spellar was in favour of military action, and he described Corbyn&#x27;s admission that he could not personally support the air strikes as an &quot;attempted coup&quot; by &quot;Corbyn and his tiny band of Trots in the bunker.&quot; Spellar supported Owen Smith in the 2016 Labour leadership election.

In November 2017, Spellar was appointed as a member of the UK parliament delegation to the NATO Parliamentary Assembly.

In March 2019, Spellar was one of 21 MPs—and the only Labour MP—to vote against LGBTQ-inclusive sex and relationships education in English schools. He defended his vote by saying that &quot;parents have the primary responsibility for bringing up their children and they may have different views.” The co-chair of LGBT Labour Melantha Chittenden tweeted in response to his vote, saying: &quot;Woke up to find out that one Labour MP voted against LGBT inclusive relationship and sex education and I’ve been sat here trying to work out how to explain how furious I am, but I only have one thing to say: John Spellar shame on you.&quot;

On 27 May 2024, Spellar announced he would step down at the 2024 general election, after having served as an MP for over 32 years.

=== Peerage ===
After standing down as an MP, Spellar was nominated for a life peerage in the 2024 Dissolution Honours. He was created &quot;Baron Spellar, of Smethwick in the County of the West Midlands&quot;, on 12 August 2024.

==Other political activities==
Spellar is a vice-chair of Labour Friends of Israel. He is a Director of the centre-right Labour grouping Labour First, and sits on the Advisory Council of the Henry Jackson Society, a prominent neoliberal and neoconservative foreign policy think tank. He is also a member of the Council on Geostrategy Advisory Board.

==Personal life==
Spellar was married to dentist Anne Wilmot from 1981 until her death in 2003. They had a daughter.

<doc id="450466" wikidata="Q4934055" url="?curid=450466" title="Bob Spink">
<text>Robert Michael Spink (born 1 August 1948) is a British former politician who was a member of parliament (MP) for Castle Point in Essex (1992 to 1997, and 2001 to 2010).

Spink was elected as the Conservative Party MP for Castle Point in 1992, lost his seat in 1997, but regained it in 2001. Having resigned the Conservative whip in March 2008, in April 2008 he defected to the UK Independence Party (UKIP), becoming that party&#x27;s first MP. In November 2008, he became an independent. Standing as an independent, he lost his seat in the 2010 election to the Conservative candidate, Rebecca Harris.

Spink subsequently rejoined UKIP. In 2017, he was convicted on four counts of electoral fraud, and was given a six-month prison sentence, suspended for two years, in January 2018.

==Early life==
He was educated at Holycroft Secondary Modern School (now a primary school) on Victoria Road in Keighley and Southall Technical College. At the University of Manchester, he gained a BSc Hons (1st) in 1972. At Cranfield University, he gained an MSc in industrial engineering and administration in 1975 and PhD in economics and management in 1988.

He joined the Royal Air Force (RAF) in 1964 and, until 1966, did his basic training at RAF Cosford and RAF Uxbridge, being invalided. He was an engineer for EMI Electronics Ltd from 1966 to 1977 in Hayes and gained an Ordinary National Certificate (ONC) from Southall Technical College in 1969 when on day-release, then became an industrial management consultant in 1977 for Harold Whitehead and Partners. From 1980 to 1984, he was a director of Seafarer Navigation International Ltd (eventually bought by Standard Communications) in Bournemouth and, from 1989 to 1993, he was a non-executive director of Bournemouth International Airport. From 1984 to 1993, he was a management consultant. From 1997 to 2001, he worked for Harold Whitehead in Windsor. He was a county councillor in Dorset from 1985 to 1992.

==Parliamentary career==
In May 1994, Spink presented an adjournment debate in the House of Commons in strong opposition to proposals to reduce the age of consent for homosexual acts from 21 to 18 The age of consent was later reduced to 18 after the passing of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994.

In April 2005, before the general election, Spink placed an advertisement in the local &quot;Yellow Advertiser&quot; newspaper criticising the Labour government&#x27;s record against illegal immigration. His rival for the constituency, the Labour candidate Luke Akehurst, denounced Spink&#x27;s advert as provoking racial tension. Spink won the election increasing his share of the vote by 3.7%.

In March 2008, Spink announced to the UK House of Commons that he had resigned the Conservative Party whip because of &quot;criminal and other irregularities&quot; in his constituency. Soon afterwards, in April 2008, he joined UK Independence Party and therefore became it first member of parliament. He later found himself at odds with his new party over the issue of whether or not to extend the amount of time a suspect can be detained without charge from 28 to 42 days. He voted for the bill, but UKIP opposed it.

Spink is opposed to abortion and supports the reintroduction of capital punishment. He is against research into animal chimeras.

In March 2010, Spink confirmed he was encouraging candidates to stand in local elections under the label &quot;Independent Save Our Green Belt&quot;. At the 2010 general election, he stood as an independent candidate, but made it clear that he was supporting UKIP. UKIP aided his election campaign and he received 27% of the vote, but lost Castle Point to the Conservative Rebecca Harris. In 2014, he rejoined UKIP.

==Electoral fraud==
In January 2018, Spink was given a six-month suspended prison sentence with 150 hours community service and ordered to pay £5,000 costs, for electoral fraud. He had tricked elderly and infirm constituents into signing election nomination forms which they believed were petitions. They did not know they were to nominate a UKIP candidate or that Spink represented UKIP. Sentencing, Judge Ian Graham said, &quot;This sort of offending undermines the working of democratic structures in this country. The democratic process depends on the good faith of those who engage in it, because a lot of what happens is of course quite difficult to police.&quot;

==Personal life==
He married Janet Barham and they have three sons and a daughter. They have since divorced.

<doc id="450468" wikidata="Q2150632" url="?curid=450468" title="Richard Spring, Baron Risby">
<text>Richard John Grenville Spring, Baron Risby (born 24 September 1946) is a former Conservative Party politician in the United Kingdom. He served as Member of Parliament (MP) for Bury St Edmunds from 1992 to 1997, and for West Suffolk from 1997 to 2010. He joined the House of Lords in 2010.

==Biography==
Spring was born into the prominent Spring family, in 1946 in Cape Town, South Africa where he attended Rondebosch and Cape Town University. He subsequently studied at Magdalene College, Cambridge. He married Hon. Jane Henniker-Major, daughter of John Henniker-Major, 8th Baron Henniker, in 1979. They divorced, having had two children.

==Career==
===Finance===
Lord Risby has more than 20 years&#x27; experience in the financial sector. Following his graduation from Cambridge University, Spring started his career in the City. He joined Merrill Lynch in 1971 and was appointed as vice-president in 1976, a position which he held until 1986. He has furthermore worked with E F Hutton, Lehman Brothers and Furman Selz.

===Parliament===
Spring contested Ashton-under-Lyne at the 1983 general election. He was first elected as an MP at the 1992 General Election, representing Bury St Edmunds. Spring served as Parliamentary Private Secretary to Sir Patrick Mayhew as Secretary of State for Northern Ireland (1994–95).

Spring resigned from this position in 1995, after &quot;News of the World&quot; published a story detailing a sex encounter he had allegedly been involved in. The publication of the story was attacked as an example of paid entrapment, and on the grounds that it served no public interest. &quot;News of the World&quot; columnist Woodrow Wyatt, writing in &quot;The Times&quot;, stated that &quot;[t]hat anyone is entitled to privacy in their homes, in their cups or in their beds is a wholly alien concept to the &quot;News of the World&quot;. The &quot;News of the World&quot; has as good as asked for a privacy law. The Government and Opposition should no longer hesitate to produce it&quot;. Even the &quot;News of the World&quot;&#x27;s proprietor, Rupert Murdoch, privately criticised the story as &quot;over the top&quot;.

Spring&#x27;s resignation was seen as a blow to John Major&#x27;s Back to Basics campaign.
Spring subsequently served as PPS to Tim Eggar as Minister for Trade and Industry (1995–96) and to Nicholas Soames and James Arbuthnot as Ministers of State at the Ministry of Defence (1996–97).

In 1997, Spring was elected as MP for West Suffolk. Between 1997 and 2000 he was Opposition spokesman for Culture, Media and Sport. He was Opposition Spokesman for Foreign Affairs between 2000 and 2004 and Shadow Minister for the Treasury between 2004 and 2005. On 23 November 2009, Spring announced that he would stand down at the 2010 general election.

He served as a Governor of the Westminster Foundation for Democracy from 2000 to 2009.

Between 2005 and 2010 he was a vice-chairman of the Conservative Party and vice-chairman of Conservative Business Relations as well. In 2005 he was appointed co-chairman of Conservative City Circle and in 2007 he founded Conservative City Future, of which he is Patron with Sir John Major.

He was also Director of the British Syrian Society between 2003 and 2011, and featured on a 2012 Dispatches program on the Assad regime.

On 24 December 2010, Spring was created a life peer as Baron Risby of Haverhill in the County of Suffolk. Lord Risby sits as a Conservative in the House of Lords.

From 2011 to 2015, Risby was the vice-chairman of the All-Party Parliamentary Group for East Asian Business. In November 2012, Lord Risby was announced as one of nine prime ministerial trade envoys, with responsibility for Algeria and, in 2019, Lebanon.

Lord Risby was on the EU External Affairs Committee in the Lords between 2015 and 2018. In 2020 to 2022 he was a member of the International Agreements Committee.

===Other interests===
In 1994, he chaired a parliamentary enquiry into the taxation of horseracing.

Risby is co-chairman of the All Party Parliamentary Group for Ukraine. In his capacity as the then Chairman of the British Ukrainian Society, he co-chaired the Scenarios for Ukraine programme for the World Economic Forum in Davos. Since May 2022 he has been on the Russian Government black list.

In November 2023, Risby initiated a parliamentary debate to persuade the UK Government to declare the Ukrainian Holodomor as genocide.

Risby has been a director of several businesses and organisations, including Hawkley Oil and Gas Ltd and Minexco Petroleum Inc, and was the president of the Association for Decentralised Energy. He is also the Deputy Chairman of the Small Business Bureau. In 2016, he was made a Government appointed director the Horserace Betting Levy Board.

He is a Patron of the London Magazine and of the Open Road charity, and is a member of the Advisory Board of the Council on Geostrategy.

In 2007, he was nominated for a British Computer Society award for accessibility. In 2009, he was awarded the Parliamentary Award for Road Safety in recognition of his community campaigning.

<text>The Diocese of Sydney is a diocese in Sydney, within the Province of New South Wales of the Anglican Church of Australia. The majority of the diocese is evangelical and low church in tradition.

The diocese goes as far as Lithgow in the west and the Hawkesbury River in the north, and it includes much of the New South Wales south coast. It encompasses Australia&#x27;s largest city as well as the city of Wollongong, and includes Lord Howe Island and Norfolk Island. It is, geographically, among the larger Anglican dioceses in the world, though the smallest diocese in the state of New South Wales and one of the smaller dioceses in Australia. By attendance, it is also by far the largest diocese in the Anglican Church of Australia; in 2011, its 58,300 weekly attenders accounted for 37.6 percent of the Anglican Church&#x27;s weekly attendance of 155,000, and in 2015, the diocese&#x27;s 688 active clergy accounted for 28.1 percent of the active clergy across the church. As of 2023, the diocese reported that 48,000 adults, or about one percent of the total population in its boundaries, regularly attend services at Diocese of Sydney churches.

Kanishka Raffel, formerly Dean of St Andrew&#x27;s Cathedral, Sydney since 4 February 2016, was elected as Archbishop of Sydney on 6 May 2021, and was consecrated and installed in that position on 28 May 2021.

==History==
===Foundations===
====Richard Johnson====
The Anglican ministry has been present in Sydney since its foundation in 1788. An Evangelical cleric, Richard Johnson, was the first chaplain to the new colony of New South Wales and was sponsored by the London Missionary Society. Other chaplains, notably Samuel Marsden and William Cowper, were also sent. Their positions were unusual as their stipends were paid partly by the colonial government and some (Marsden among them) received large grants of land from the governor of the colony. Some (again including Marsden) were also magistrates. The early chaplains (Johnson and Marsden) were under the authority of the governor, as per their commissions. In 1802, Governor King declared the Parish of St. Phillip&#x27;s Sydney (later named St Philip&#x27;s Church, Sydney, after the Apostle) and St. John&#x27;s Parramatta, (later St John&#x27;s Cathedral, Parramatta) and &#x27;that the churches now building at Sydney and Parramatta be named Saint Phillip and Saint John.&#x27;

====Thomas Hobbes Scott====
In 1825 Thomas Hobbes Scott the former secretary to J. T. Bigge, the commissioner of the inquiry into the administration of the colony of New South Wales by Governor Lachlan Macquarie, was appointed the first Archdeacon of Australia while still under the jurisdiction of the Bishop of Calcutta. The archdeaconry was created as a corporation sole.

In his position as archdeacon, Scott was a member of the Legislative Council (ranking next behind the Lieutenant Governor) and had almost complete control of all church matters. The Colonial Office appointed him King&#x27;s Visitor to schools and so he became responsible for public education throughout the colony. His educational policy was guided by the principle that the church and education were inseparably connected and the funds to sustain them were administered by the same trustees. Since this view was shared by the Colonial Office, the Governor Bathurst, in March 1826, created the Corporation of the Trustees of Church and School Lands, granting one-seventh of the lands of New South Wales to the corporation for the purposes of the Church of England and education in the colony. Scott became the ex officio Vice-President (the President being the Governor.)

It was mainly the combination of Archdeacon Scott&#x27;s official positions as a member of the Legislative Council, as King&#x27;s Visitor and also as Vice-President of the Corporation of Church and School Lands and of the substantial nature of the granting of the lands to the Corporation that led to Courts later holding that at this time the Church of England was the established church in the Colony of New South Wales. Scott retired in 1829 and was succeeded by William Grant Broughton. Scott was shipwrecked while returning to England and assisted the Anglican ministry in the new colony of Western Australia and then in establishing a Church of England chaplaincy in Batavia in the then Dutch East Indies.

====William Grant Broughton====

William Grant Broughton succeeded Scott in 1828. During the time that Broughton was the archdeacon the corporation was abolished and the Church of England lost its favoured place and other Christian churches were also awarded glebe land in towns in the colony. Unlike in England, the Church of England was never &#x27;established&#x27; in New South Wales.

The Diocese of Australia was formed by letters patent dated 18 January 1836 and Broughton was enthroned as Bishop of Australia on 5 June 1836. He then lost the &quot;ex officio&quot; position on the Legislative Council (though regaining it briefly later before the creation of a partly elected council in 1842). He continued an education policy and established The King&#x27;s School, Sydney.

===Formation of the diocese===
The Diocese of Tasmania separated from the Diocese of Australia in 1842. In 1842 (after the erections of New Zealand and Tasmania dioceses), her jurisdiction was described as &quot;Australia, Norfolk Island&quot; (but not &quot;Van Diemen&#x27;s Land&quot;) or &quot;New South Wales, Port Phillip &quot;(i.e. Victoria)&quot;, Norfolk Island, South Australia&quot;. By letters patent of 25 June 1847, the Diocese of Australia was divided into the four separate dioceses of Sydney, Adelaide, Newcastle and Melbourne. Broughton remained as Bishop of Sydney; he became metropolitan bishop and the Diocese of Sydney recognised as the metro-political see over Newcastle, Adelaide, Melbourne, Tasmania and New Zealand. The Diocese of Sydney has been led by an archbishop since 1897.

====Moore Theological College====

The diocese initially relied upon priests and bishops who were trained in and had migrated from England and Ireland. Broughton had attempted to found a theological college but it closed in 1849. In 1856, Moore Theological College opened, the official theological college (seminary) for Sydney Anglicans. Since that time it has grown in size and stature. In 2006 it had in excess of 450 students, many of whom end up in ministry outside the ecclesiastical and geographical boundaries of the Sydney diocese.

===Anglican Church League===
Since the beginning of the 20th century, Evangelicals within the diocese were concerned about growing Anglo-Catholicism and Modernism within the church and fought very hard to preserve Sydney&#x27;s Evangelical nature—especially as Tractarian clergy had started arriving from England in the 19th century. Out of this came the Anglican Church League, a body of Evangelicals who worked in the politics of the diocese to further the Evangelical cause. Currently, all bishops and most senior officeholders in the diocese are members of the Anglican Church League.

===Anglicans Together===
In response to the dominance of Evangelicalism and Calvinism in the diocese, a number of other Anglicans and parishes identified with different Anglican traditions of churchmanship, such as Anglo-Catholicism and Broad Church, have joined in the formation of an organisation called Anglicans Together. The organisation supports traditional forms of Anglican liturgy, such as the Book of Common Prayer, as well as encouraging a broader spectrum of theological perspective. Members of Anglicans Together also support celebrating the Eucharist every Sunday and its focus as the principal form of Christian worship. The use of vestments for clergy and an emphasis on the Catholic nature of Anglicanism are also supported.

==Characteristics of Sydney Anglicanism==
===Evangelical distinctives===
Most Sydney Anglicans stand within the evangelical English Puritan traditions. Evangelicals within the diocese see themselves as standing in the heritage of the English Reformation and direct the diocese accordingly. As such the diocese officially holds to belief in the divine inspiration and authority of scripture in line with the official statement of Anglican belief, the &quot;Articles of Religion&quot; (more commonly known as the Thirty-Nine Articles). There are, however, a number of beliefs that differentiate the Evangelicalism of the Diocese of Sydney from other Evangelical traditions:

#Typological interpretation of the Old Testament—a biblical theological approach which interprets Old Testament prophecies regarding the Land of Israel, the Jerusalem Temple and the Davidic Kingdom as having a typological rather than literal fulfilment in the New Covenant; thus rejecting dispensationalism and Christian Zionism which are more characteristic of American Evangelicalism. This approach is described by Graeme Goldsworthy, a Sydney theologian, in his book &quot;According to Plan&quot;.
#Identification of &quot;church&quot; with the local congregation as opposed to a diocese or denomination. Sydney&#x27;s ecclesiology, influenced by the former Principal and Vice-Principal of Moore College David Broughton Knox and Donald Robinson (later respectively Principal of George Whitefield College and Archbishop of Sydney) among others, believes that the church is God&#x27;s people meeting around God&#x27;s Word. This leads to church meetings being centred around the public reading, explanation and response to God&#x27;s Word. Further, Anglicans in Sydney generally identify themselves primarily with their local congregation rather than a denomination or institution, and place less emphasis on the celebration of Holy Communion (called the Eucharist by many Anglicans) than do Anglicans of many other dioceses. 
#The importance of evangelism and a personal faith.

Sydney Anglicans have been described as fundamentalist and sect-like by their opponents. They respond by arguing that whereas fundamentalists interpret all parts of the Bible literally Evangelicals in Sydney interpret the Bible in the context of the literary genre. 

===Affiliation with Anglican doctrine===
For most of the last 450 years Anglicans worldwide have used the Book of Common Prayer framed by Archbishop of Canterbury Thomas Cranmer in 1549, revised significantly in 1552 and modified slightly in 1662. They have also subscribed to, or otherwise acknowledged as foundational, the Thirty-Nine Articles of Religion as listed in the Book of Common Prayer. While the Book of Common Prayer is no longer used in many Sydney churches, the diocese still fully affirms the doctrine and principles embodied within it as they interpret them. In keeping with the theologically reformed character of the 39 Articles, the diocese holds the view that all church doctrine and traditions are subject to the authority of Scripture.

===Disassociation from Anglican tradition===
There are some areas of church practice that are being challenged within the diocese that have potential ramifications for the wider Anglican Communion. The system of episcopal order is under review with some eager to redefine some of the roles of the threefold order of deacons, priests and bishops. 

The diocese is considering whether the laying on of hands at confirmation could be performed by the rector of the parish. Although confirmation by a priest is common practice in Orthodoxy and is permitted in certain circumstances in Roman Catholicism, in the Anglican tradition confirmation can only be celebrated by a bishop. In 2005, possibly as a precursor to this change, the diocese formally removed the requirement of confirmation prior to partaking of communion for those who have been baptised as adults. However, it is common practice throughout the diocese to allow all adults who profess genuine repentance and Christian faith to receive communion regardless of whether they have been baptised or confirmed.

Lay presidency (also known as &quot;Lay Administration of Holy Communion&quot;) is being considered, whereby the Lord&#x27;s Supper could be celebrated by deacons and authorised laity, including women. According to current church law, only ordained priests and bishops are allowed to preside at the Lord&#x27;s Supper. An ordinance to permit lay presidency was not proceeded with at the diocesan synod in 2005 due to concerns regarding its legality. However, this issue hasn&#x27;t died and new motions are being drafted ready to be put before the next diocesan synod. In October 2008, the &quot;Australian Church Record&quot; and the &quot;Anglican Church League&quot; published &quot;The Lord&#x27;s Supper in Human Hands. Who Should Administer?&quot;, which describes the forty-year discussion of this issue in Sydney and summarises the debate. Although Sydney was not the first diocese, nor the only one, in which this issue has been raised, it has been discussed within the diocese for a number of years. This publication has been widely distributed so that the Anglican Communion might examine and consider Sydney&#x27;s discussions.

====Liturgical practice====
Few churches sing canticles and responses, either from the 1662 &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot; or &quot;An Australian Prayer Book&quot;.

The term &quot;meeting&quot; is sometimes used interchangeably with &quot;service&quot;. The most notable example of this is St Andrew&#x27;s Cathedral. Many meetings at Evangelical churches in the diocese do not use a prayer book or a liturgical form of service. There is often an early morning (e.g. 8.00 am) service that follows Morning Prayer or Holy Communion from &quot;An Australian Prayer Book&quot;. Even where no formal liturgy is used many core elements of Anglican liturgy may still be used for congregational participation, such as a corporate confession of sin, saying of creeds and corporate prayers. A screen and projector may be used in place of books. Lay or congregational participation in Sydney churches also occurs through Bible readings, leading intercessory prayer, leading the meetings, testimonies and interviews, singing and playing music. In many parishes fermented communion wine has been replaced with grape juice. Predominantly, the reason given for this is to be sensitive to people for whom alcohol could cause a problem.

====Vestments====
Since 1911 the diocese has prohibited the wearing of the chasuble, a vestment now generally worn elsewhere in Australia for the celebration of the Eucharist. Traditionally in Sydney most clergy have worn the choir habit for all services but a few have also worn a cope and stole when celebrating the Eucharist and at certain other services. This prohibition against chasubles was originated by Archbishop Wright, an English Evangelical, who did so on the basis that the vestment was deemed illegal, relying on decisions of the English ecclesiastical courts as finally upheld in the Privy Council in Read v Bishop of Lincoln [1892] AC 664 (see also Ritualist movement). The main objection to this vestment in the mind of Sydney Anglicans is that it is associated with the high church idea of a &quot;sacrificing&quot; priesthood. That idea is contrary to Sydney&#x27;s low church views of both Holy Communion and of the role and function of the ordained ministry. The archbishop&#x27;s practice has since been codified by a synod ordinance, making Sydney the only diocese in the whole Anglican Communion that continues to ban the wearing of chasubles, reinforcing the perceived ongoing disapproval of Anglo-Catholics in the diocese. 

The cope, therefore, is often worn at Anglo-Catholic churches where the celebrant at the Eucharist would conventionally wear the chasuble. In general those clergy who robe wear a cassock, surplice, scarf and, occasionally, also an academic hood. Since about 1990 there has sometimes been a practice of wearing a long surplice without a cassock, particularly through the summer. Most clergy in the diocese, however, dispense even with these robes, conducting church services in street clothes ranging from a suit and tie or clerical collar, to smart casual attire.

==Influential people==
===Theological influences===

The Sydney diocese has been shaped by the activities and beliefs of many influential people throughout the 20th century:

*T. C. Hammond was an Anglican from Ireland who moved to Australia to become the Principal of Moore Theological College during the 1930s. Hammond&#x27;s influence was critical as he injected an intellectual Calvinism into his students. The book &quot;In Understanding Be Men&quot;, a summary of Christian doctrine, was his lasting legacy and it is still in print today.
*David Broughton Knox was Principal of Moore Theological College from 1959 until 1985. Along with Donald Robinson (Vice-Principal from 1959 until 1972), Knox pioneered the study of Biblical theology, which in turn influenced the Sydney Anglican ecclesiology. Knox was strongly opposed to Anglo-Catholic practices in parish ministry. Knox promoted the dominant role of the male, both as head of the house and head of the church.
*John Chapman was Director of Sydney&#x27;s Department of Evangelism (now Evangelism Ministries) from 1970 until 1995. He used his ability as a public speaker and evangelist to promote local church missions. Evangelism thus became a priority within the Sydney Anglican churches at around the same time that church-going became less important to mainstream Australia. Chapman&#x27;s influence ensured that Sydney Anglicans were able to mobilise in evangelism to prevent too many people from leaving the churches.
*Billy Graham, the American evangelist, visited Sydney for crusades in 1959, 1968 and 1979. Many who were converted at the 1959 crusade ended up studying at Moore Theological College and entering the ministry, including Peter Jensen and Phillip Jensen (below). The 1959 crusade had a permanent influence on Sydney Anglicans, who placed a great priority on preaching the gospel and calling for a personal decision of faith.
*John Stott, the English preacher and former Rector of All Souls, Langham Place, visited Australia many times during the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s. He introduced Sydney Anglicans to expository preaching as the main method of preaching sermons. Thus many Anglican churches in Sydney are regularly exposed to a preaching style that works through Bible passages, explains them and applies them to everyday life. Rather than preaching topical or theological sermons, Sydney Anglican preachers are more likely to preach systematically through verses, chapters and books of the Bible. However, prominent figures within the influential Anglican Church League have criticised Stott for supporting the doctrine of Annihilationism.
*Peter Jensen entered Moore Theological College in the late 1960s and was appointed principal in 1985. In 2001 he was elected Archbishop of Sydney and he immediately called on all churches in the Sydney diocese to aim to reach 10% of their communities by 2012.
*Phillip Jensen, Peter Jensen&#x27;s younger brother, became chaplain to the University of New South Wales in 1975 and Rector of St Matthias&#x27; Centennial Park in 1977. He is deeply conservative in his Calvinist theology yet radical and iconoclastic in his ministry style. His work at the University of New South Wales included the creation of the Ministry Training Strategy (MTS) which trained young men and women in practical ministry skills before sending them to Moore Theological College. In 2003 Jensen was appointed as Dean of St Andrew&#x27;s Cathedral in Sydney.
*D. A. Carson, Canadian-born Reformed Evangelical New Testament theologian, currently teaching at Trinity Evangelical Divinity School in Chicago, Illinois. Carson is a regular visitor to the Anglican Diocese of Sydney.

===Notable former archbishops===
*Howard West Kilvinton Mowll, archbishop from 1933 to 1958. Mowll&#x27;s vision for church planting, overseas missions, and church welfare work is unrivalled in Australian history. As a staunch Evangelical, returning from the mission field of China, Mowll experienced early difficulties in a predominantly liberal church; before rising to national prominence during the war years with his assistance rendered to many in need during this time. Within a month of World War II starting he had formed the Church of England National Emergency Fund (CENEF) which was supported with volunteers and fundraising by the Sydney Diocesan Churchwomen&#x27;s Association. CENEF funded huts for recreation and chaplains in military camps around Sydney, as well as at St Andrew&#x27;s Cathedral and other churches around Sydney. To continue to help ex-service people after the war and youth work, CENEF raised funds to buy 201 Castlereagh Street, Sydney, and Rathane in the Royal National Park. CENEF leveraged the Castlereagh St building to buy land at Gilbulla and in for a retirement village. This retirement village was one of his great achievements (some say Dorothy, Mowll&#x27;s wife, was the driving force behind the idea), and became the first retirement village in Australia. Today this site remains the flagship for the Diocese&#x27;s Anglican Retirement Villages. In 1947, following WWII, Mowll was elected Primate of Australia.
*Marcus Loane, archbishop from 1966 to 1982. Loane was the first Australian-born Archbishop of Sydney and was the Primate of Australia from 1978 to 1982.
*Donald Robinson, archbishop from 1982 to 1993. As a theologian and former Vice-Principal of Moore Theological College, he was highly regarded in Sydney for his evangelical teaching. He put much energy into church planting in new housing areas and in building up existing churches in populous low-income suburbs. He was strongly opposed to the ordination of women.
*Harry Goodhew, archbishop from 1993 to 2001. Appointed as a moderate &quot;conservative&quot;, Goodhew attempted to heal rifts within the Diocese while maintaining a conservative Evangelical stance. He continued to promote the &quot;Archbishop&#x27;s Vision for Growth&quot; founded by Robinson. Goodhew opened pathways between the Anglican Diocese of Sydney and other churches, promoted communication between Christians and Jews and supported the Roman Catholic-founded Cursillo movement which rapidly expanded among some more progressive Anglicans within the Diocese. To ease the tensions involved in the debate over women&#x27;s ordination, Goodhew placed a moratorium on discussing the issue for a time.

==Relationships, politics and policy==

===Relationship with Australian Anglicanism===
For most of the last century the uncompromisingly Evangelical positions adopted by the leaders of the Sydney diocese have contrasted with that of most other Anglican dioceses in Australia which have tended to be more Anglo-Catholic in their style of worship. This contrast helped to delay the adoption of a constitution for the Australian church and, in 1942, led to legal action being taken, ostensibly by members of the parish of Canowindra, a small town in the Diocese of Bathurst, but strongly supported by members of the Sydney diocese, Broughton Knox and T. C. Hammond (who both gave evidence in the ensuing proceedings) against the then Bishop of Bathurst, Arnold Lomas Wylde. In these proceedings, which ended in a split decision in the High Court of Australia, those bringing the action sought to prevent the parishes in the Bathurst diocese from using &quot;The Red Book&quot;, a devotional manual authorised by the bishop. 

These differences in teaching and style of worship have become more marked in recent years as those leading the Diocese of Sydney allege that other dioceses have become theologically liberal. This has placed continued strain on relationships with those other dioceses. As a consequence of this some parishes outside the Sydney diocese are reluctant to invite Sydney-trained clergy to ministry positions and, conversely, clergy trained outside Sydney are rarely invited to minister within the Sydney diocese. However, many of the large and growing Evangelical churches in dioceses such as Adelaide and Perth continue to recruit some clergy and lay staff trained at Moore College.

==== Affiliation with the FIEC ====
Some Sydney Anglicans were involved in planting independent evangelical churches in other parts of Australia, now member churches of the denomination called the Fellowship of Independent Evangelical Churches (FIEC) Australia. Other Anglican churches objected to the Sydney diocese helping to plant churches outside its boundaries and the complementarian views of FIEC churches have been questioned in the secular press. Prominent Sydney clergy such as Phillip Jensen and the Moore College principal, John Woodhouse, have been on the boards of some of these churches. At the 2005 synod links between Sydney Anglicans and independent Evangelical churches were strengthened and in 2019, fourteen FIEC churches were affiliated with the Sydney diocese. Moore College describes itself as the training partner for the FIEC.

===Relationship with the charismatic movement===
The Sydney diocese has been less influenced by the charismatic movement than some other dioceses. While there are some parishes with strong charismatic leanings, most clergy support the doctrinal position that Christians are &quot;filled&quot; with the Holy Spirit at the time of conversion rather than as a separate Christian experience (as believed by some Pentecostals). As with other mainstream Christian church traditions, there is a fundamental belief in the central role of the Holy Spirit in conversion and sanctification of believers and the Fruit of the Holy Spirit is expected to be exhibited by all Christians.

===Relationships within the diocese===
Within the Sydney diocese there are parishes which support a range of doctrinal positions or use formal liturgical styles of worship that differ from the Evangelicalism which is dominant within the diocese. Differences can become politicised prior to the election of an archbishop with a number of clergy coalescing into like-minded groups. The two most visible groups are &quot;The Anglican Church League&quot; who support the Diocese&#x27;s majority Evangelical position and &quot;Anglicans Together&quot; who are more theologically broad in their understanding of the Bible and promote a diversity of liturgical practice, which they believe to be in line with the Lambeth Quadrilateral.

===Anglican realignment===
The diocese has been a major force in the Anglican realignment movement, since the election of the first openly non-celibate gay bishop in the Anglican Communion, Gene Robinson, by the Episcopal Church of the United States in 2003. The Diocese of Sydney and Archbishop Peter Jensen in particular have been active in the Global Anglican Future Conference (GAFCON) and in the Global South, seeking a renewed Anglican Communion, more faithful to their understanding of Christian orthodoxy. In this way, the Diocese of Sydney supported the birth of the Anglican Church in North America as an alternative to the Episcopal Church and, in October 2009, their synod approved a resolution calling for the admission of the new province into the Anglican Communion. The resolution stated that the &quot;Synod welcomes the creation of the Province of the Anglican Church in North America (ACNA) under the leadership of Archbishop Bob Duncan and notes the GAFCON Primates Council recognition of the ACNA as genuinely Anglican and its recommendation that Anglican Provinces affirm full communion with the ACNA. Synod therefore expresses its desire to be in full communion with the ACNA&quot;. It was also decided to seek a General Synod motion expressing the Anglican Church of Australia purpose to be in full communion with the new province.

===Sydney diocese and politics===
Some external commentators (including the retired American bishop John Shelby Spong, &quot;Sydney Morning Herald&quot; writer Chris McGillion and journalist Muriel Porter) have attempted to link Sydney Evangelicals to the conservative &quot;right&quot;. While most Sydney clergy strongly support conservative positions on controversial areas such as euthanasia, homosexuality and abortion, they also strongly support social justice issues such as protection of the rights of the underprivileged and the rights of unauthorised immigrants seeking refugee status.

This &quot;left&quot; wing element has a lengthy history. Archdeacon R. B. Hammond (no relation to T. C. Hammond) who was the rector of St Barnabas&#x27; Broadway operated soup kitchens during the 1930s and was then a founders of a self-help community which became known as Hammondville where unemployed people built homes, established market gardens and so found work. More lately Sir Marcus Loane was noted for his criticisms of the then Liberal-Country Party coalition governments on issues relating to Vietnamese refugees after the end of the Vietnam War, seeking the ready admission of refugees to Australia. Loane was also outspoken on issues involving uranium mining. There have been clergy willing to speak out against the more conservative policies of the Diocese of Sydney. In 2007, Keith Mascord (formerly of Mission Australia) sent an open letter to the Standing Committee, revealing disgruntlements of people within the church (both leaders and congregation members) and suggesting alternative ways forward.

The perception that Sydney Anglicans have adopted fundamentalism (see comments under Evangelical distinctives) has led to assumptions that the diocese gives implicit support for &quot;right leaning&quot; politicians in Australia.

In 2017, the Sydney Anglican Diocese donated $1,000,000 to the &quot;No&quot; campaign in response to the Australian Marriage Law Postal Survey about same sex marriage.

===Ecumenical relations===
While the Anglican communion&#x27;s largest evangelical diocese has worked closely with its Roman Catholic counterpart on social issues for many years, the doctrinal divisions between Calvinists and Catholics are too great to be overcome by a common distaste for liberal Anglicanism. On 28 October 2009, the Diocese of Sydney&#x27;s synod adopted a resolution urging all Anglicans to reject the Vatican&#x27;s establishment of personal ordinariates for disaffected Anglo-Catholic traditionalists.

===Sexual abuse, incidence and policy===
The diocese has been disturbed by revelations of sexual abuse. Victor Roland Cole, a member of the standing committee and a former president of the Anglican Church League, was named in the Paedophile Enquiry of the Royal Commission into the New South Wales Police Service. In March 2003, Cole was defrocked on the grounds of sexual misconduct involving a 14-year-old girl. Other cases were examined by the commission but not dealt with in public hearings. In 1996, the Diocese established the Church Discipline Ordinance which provides a mechanism for allegations and complaints to be dealt with and wrongdoers to be removed from their positions in the diocese.

The diocese is committed to safe ministry and the wellbeing of all those who participate in the activities of the church and there is zero tolerance for misconduct and abuse. The Professional Standards Unit (PSU) is responsible for receiving and taking care of complaints of child abuse or sexual misconduct by clergy and church workers.

===Women&#x27;s ordination===

One of the main differences between Sydney and the majority of other Anglican dioceses in Australia has been its unwillingness to ordain women to the priesthood (itself a term infrequently used in the diocese) or presbyterate. This issue is an indicator of Sydney&#x27;s specificity in ecclesiology and theology to most other dioceses within the Anglican Communion.

The diocese has ordained women as deacons since 1989.

<text>Rachel Anne Squire (13 July 1954 – 5 January 2006) was a British Labour politician who served as Member of Parliament (MP) for Dunfermline West in Scotland from 1992 general election to 2005, and then for Dunfermline and West Fife from 2005 until her death after a long series of illnesses.

==Background==
Squire was born in Carshalton, Surrey. She attended the all-female Godolphin and Latymer School in Hammersmith and then proceeded to a degree in Archaeology and Anthropology at Durham University, and a social work qualification at Birmingham University. 

After university, Squire became a social worker, also working in factories and other manual jobs. She became a full-time official with National Union of Public Employees, the public sector union, later part of UNISON. Working for the union took her to Merseyside and then to Scotland, where she became the union&#x27;s education officer. She served on the Labour Scottish Executive Committee, and was chair of the Linlithgow Constituency Labour Party.

In 1984, Squire married Allan Mason, and they had two children.

==Member of Parliament==
Squire was elected MP for Dunfermline West in 1992, replacing Dick Douglas, who had defected to the SNP two years prior. According to a profile on the BBC website, Rachel Squire was &quot;one of the most committed and successful constituency advocates in Parliament&quot;. She worked to get regeneration funds for her constituency, campaigned for the Rosyth Dockyard and secured funds to put off the closure of the Longannet coal mine.

In Parliament, Squire was a member of the Defence Select Committee and served as PPS to Education ministers Stephen Byers and Estelle Morris from 1997 to 2001.
Squire was a patron for Brain Tumour Action, a cancer charity. She was diagnosed with a brain tumour in 1993, and a second one in 2003. On 2 June 2005, she was admitted to hospital after suffering a stroke, thought to have been caused by bleeding stemming from the second brain tumour. She did not recover, and died from cancer at her home in Saline, Fife, on 5 January 2006.

Her death prompted the Dunfermline and West Fife by-election, held on 9 February 2006, in which her former seat was won by Willie Rennie for the Liberal Democrats.

<doc id="450477" wikidata="Q7188628" url="?curid=450477" title="Phyllis Starkey">
<text>Phyllis Margaret Starkey (née Williams; born 4 January 1947) is a British Labour party politician, who was the Member of Parliament (MP) for Milton Keynes South West from 1997 to 2010. She had previously served as Leader of Oxford City Council.

==Early life==
She was the daughter of Dr John Williams, a food chemist, and Catherine Hooson Williams. She attended the independent Perse School for Girls in Cambridge then read for a Bachelor of Arts degree in Biochemistry at Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford, graduating in 1970. In 1974, as a graduate student of Clare Hall, Cambridge, she was awarded the degree of Doctor of Philosophy by the University of Cambridge.

==Early career==
Before she entered Parliament, Starkey&#x27;s career was in biomedical research. Her early work with Alan Barrett at the University of Cambridge was in the field of biochemistry, and included formulating the trap hypothesis of peptidase inhibition. From 1974 to 1981, she was at the Strangeways Laboratory in Cambridge. She later headed a group at the University of Oxford researching problems of pregnancy. She was at the Sir William Dunn School of Pathology in Oxford from 1981 to 1984. She lectured in Obstetrics at the University of Oxford and was a fellow of Somerville College, Oxford, from 1984 to 1993.

Subsequently, she worked as an expert in science and technology policy and bioethics for the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council from 1993 to 1997. From 1997 to 1998 she was a fellow of St Antony&#x27;s College, Oxford.

Starkey joined the Labour Party in 1974 and became a councillor on Oxford City Council in 1983. She held various positions on the council, including that of Leader of the council (1990–93) and Chair of the Finance Committee (1988–90 and 1993–96).

==Parliamentary career==
Starkey was selected to stand for election for Labour through an all-women shortlist. As a female entrant to Parliament after the 1997 general election, Starkey was part of the intake dubbed &#x27;The Blair Babes&#x27; by the UK media following a photoshoot by the Labour Party to show off how many women MPs were in the new government. Her Parliamentary voting record showed she was a staunch supporter of the legislation introduced by the Labour governments, including the occasional contentious issues within her party. Such were her Blairite credentials that Ken Livingstone, Labour&#x27;s Mayor of London, dubbed her &quot;Phyllis Stasi&quot;

===On the backbenches (1997–2001)===
Starkey was a Member of the Select Committee on the Modernisation of the House of Commons between 1997 and 1999, during which time significant changes to parliamentary procedures were introduced, including the establishment of the Westminster Hall debating chamber and the beginning of alterations to sitting hours of Parliament to make them more &#x27;family friendly&#x27;.

In 1998 Starkey highlighted the need for a national register for door supervisors (bouncers) to protect young people&#x27;s safety while clubbing, and introduced a Private Members Bill to Parliament to establish one. Whilst her Bill did not succeed, the Government was persuaded of the need for a register, and it was incorporated into the Private Security Industry Act 2001 which led to the formation of the Security Industry Authority in 2003.

Between 1999 and 2001, Starkey was a member of the Foreign Affairs Select Committee.

===Parliamentary Private Secretary (2001–2005)===
After the 2001 general election Starkey was subsequently appointed Parliamentary Private Secretary (PPS) to junior Foreign Office Ministers Denis MacShane and Ben Bradshaw and from May–October 2002 was PPS to Denis MacShane and Mike O&#x27;Brien. In November 2002 she transferred to become PPS to Denis MacShane in his new role as Minister of State for Europe.

===Select committee chair (2005–2010)===
After the general election in May 2005, Starkey was appointed chair of the Committee on the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister. Following the reorganisation of Government Departments announced on 5 May 2006, the committee was renamed the Communities and Local Government Select Committee, though its role and the majority of its remit remained the same.

In 2006, there were some notable examples of Starkey becoming increasingly critical of the Prime Minister Tony Blair. In March she used a tough line of questioning during PMQs regarding the tensions between Israel and the Palestinian Authority, and in July during a Liaison Committee session with the PM she raised concerns in relation to the Government&#x27;s work on education and employment for the Pakistani and Bangladeshi communities of Britain.

In 2007 Starkey along with Jeffrey Donaldson MP called for an investigation into the private security and military services firm ArmorGroup, who held contracts with the British Government for police training in Iraq and Afghanistan. She has also pressed the Government to regulate nail bars and for a ban on a potentially harmful chemical glue used in some outlets to affix fake nails.

Starkey took a close interest in the political situation in the Middle East in her last Parliament, and travelled to both Palestine and Lebanon. Her outspoken opinion on the Israeli incursion into Lebanon in 2006 was firmly at odds with the Labour leadership. In a pop quiz of MPs involved in Middle East issues run by &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; newspaper in 2007, Starkey was commended along with Conservative MP Andrew Rosindell for getting the highest score, with all but one answer correct.

Starkey was comparatively untroubled by &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;&#x27;s investigation of the MPs&#x27; expenses scandal in 2009, though she was one of the MPs to have travelled abroad as a guest of the British Council, a taxpayer-funded organisation, which became the subject of controversy when the Speaker Michael Martin withheld information relating to the declaration of the hospitality provided. Starkey said she could not remember if she had spoken to the Registrar about her trip, but was of the opinion she did not have to declare a trip that was effectively paid for by the Government and the taxpayer; a position endorsed by the Commons Registrar of Members&#x27; Interests.

===Defeat===
At the 2010 general election, Starkey ran in the redrawn seat of Milton Keynes South but lost to Conservative candidate Iain Stewart, whom she had previously defeated in 2001 and 2005.

==Personal life==
She married Hugh Walton Starkey on 6 September 1969. They have two daughters.

<doc id="450479" wikidata="Q949514" url="?curid=450479" title="Jim Wright">
<text>James Claude Wright Jr. (December 22, 1922 – May 6, 2015) was an American politician who served as the 48th speaker of the United States House of Representatives from 1987 to 1989. He represented Texas&#x27; 12th congressional district as a Democrat from 1955 to 1989.

Born in Fort Worth, Texas, Wright won election to the Texas House of Representatives after serving in the United States Army Air Forces during World War II. He won election to Congress in 1954, representing a district that included his home town of Fort Worth. Like most Texas Democrats, Wright distinguished himself from many of his fellow Southern congressmen in his refusal to sign the 1956 Southern Manifesto. He voted for the Civil Rights Acts of 1960 and 1968, the final version of the Civil Rights Act of 1957, and the initial House amendment to the Voting Rights Act of 1965, but voted against the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the 24th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. He also became a senior member of the House Public Works Committee.

In 1976, Wright narrowly won election to the position of House Majority Leader. Wright voted in favor of the bill establishing Martin Luther King Jr. Day as a federal holiday in August 1983. He became Speaker of the House after Tip O&#x27;Neill retired in 1987. In March 1988, Wright led the House Democratic Caucus as Speaker to override President Reagan&#x27;s veto of the Civil Rights Restoration Act of 1987. Wright resigned from Congress in June 1989 amid a House Ethics Committee investigation into compensation that he and his wife had received. After leaving Congress, Wright became a professor at Texas Christian University. He died in Fort Worth in 2015.

==Early life==
Wright was born in Fort Worth, the son of Marie (Lyster) and James Claude Wright. Wright was of English and Irish ancestry. Because his father was a traveling salesman, Wright and his two sisters were reared in numerous communities in Texas and Oklahoma. He mostly attended Fort Worth and Dallas public schools, eventually graduating from Adamson High School (formerly Oak Cliff High School). He studied at Weatherford College and the University of Texas at Austin, but did not graduate.

In December 1941, Wright enlisted in the United States Army Air Forces, and after training, he was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Air Corps in 1942. He trained as a bombardier and earned a Distinguished Flying Cross flying during combat in B-24 Liberators with the 530th Bomb Squadron, 380th Bomb Group (Heavy) in the South Pacific during World War II. His retelling of his wartime exploits is contained in his 2005 book &quot;The Flying Circus: Pacific War—1943—As Seen through A Bombsight&quot;.

After the war, he made his home in Weatherford, where he joined partners in forming a Trade Show exhibition and marketing firm. As a Democrat, he won his first election without opposition in 1946 to the Texas House of Representatives, where he served from 1947 to 1949. He was defeated in his bid for reelection in 1948, after a rival claimed that Wright was weak in opposing both communism and interracial marriage. He was the mayor of Weatherford from 1950 to 1954. In 1953, he served as president of the League of Texas Municipalities.

==Career in Congress==

In 1954, he was elected to Congress from Texas&#x27;s 12th congressional district, which included Fort Worth and Weatherford. He won despite the fervid opposition of &quot;Fort Worth Star-Telegram&quot; publisher Amon G. Carter, who supported incumbent Democrat Wingate Lucas. Wright would be re-elected fourteen times, gradually rising in prominence in the party and in Congress. He developed a close relationship with Amon G. Carter Jr., and often repeated the axiom that the easiest way to &quot;defeat an enemy is to make him your friend.&quot;

On the morning of November 22, 1963, Wright appeared with President John F. Kennedy at the Hotel Texas for a breakfast event and a short speech outside.

In 1956, Wright refused to join most of his regional colleagues in signing the segregationist Southern Manifesto, and voted in favor of the Civil Rights Acts of 1960 and 1968. Wright voted against the initial House resolution for the Civil Rights Act of 1957 on June 18, 1957, but voted in favor of the Senate amendment to the bill on August 27, 1957. Wright voted in favor of the House amendment to the Voting Rights Act of 1965 on July 9, 1965, but did not vote on the joint conference committee report on August 3, 1965. Wright voted against the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The bill required desegregation of public accommodations and established the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, and Wright&#x27;s reason for not supporting the bill had to do with the voting rights provision of the law, which Wright enthusiastically supported, and felt the Civil Rights Act was weak without the right to vote granted to all citizens. It was signed into law by Wright&#x27;s friend, President Johnson. Wright also voted against the 24th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. Wright would later vote in favor of the bill establishing Martin Luther King Jr. Day as a federal holiday in August 1983 as well as lead the House Democratic Caucus as Speaker in March 1988 to override President Reagan&#x27;s veto of the Civil Rights Restoration Act of 1987.

In the Dallas/Fort Worth Metroplex, Jim Wright is infamous for the Wright Amendment, a contentious law he sponsored that restricted air travel from Dallas&#x27; secondary airport, Love Field. Passed in 1979, the Wright Amendment was originally designed to protect the then-fledgling Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport. The Amendment allows non-stop flights originating from or bound to any commercial airport within of the DFW Airport Control Tower to serve only states bordering Texas. It was the compromise agreed to with Southwest Airlines to expand their territory beyond Texas. This requires any flight going to or coming from a destination within that radius (Dallas Love Field and the now-defunct Greater Southwest International Airport in Fort Worth were the only airports affected) to land in a contiguous (bordering) state before continuing on to its destination. This effectively limited traffic from Love Field and GSIA to small, regional airlines (and provided the springboard for the later success of Southwest Airlines, which initially flew only within Texas) who were largely unable to compete with DFW Airport as a result. While the Amendment was welcomed at first, there were increasing doubts about its necessity as DFW grew into one of the three largest airports in the world. Many saw it as a boondoggle to benefit one particular group. Others saw it as an unlawful restraint of trade imposed against the two affected airports, and no others, in spite of the fact that public officials of Dallas and Ft Worth had agreed to the restrictions (Virginia McGuire, daughter of James C. Wright, direct conversation). However, the largest opposition came increasingly from people who simply felt that the amendment had outlived its usefulness and was also an unwarranted intrusion on the free markets of the deregulated airline industry. In 2006 Congress passed the Wright Amendment Reform Act of 2006, which repealed the Wright Amendment in stages; the last restrictions on travel from Love Field were lifted on October 13, 2014. 
Wright strongly supported the Superconducting Super Collider project in Waxahachie in Ellis County, but the work was halted in 1993.

===Majority leader===
In 1971, Wright was appointed a Democratic deputy whip, picked for ideological balance. In this role, he was assigned responsibility for persuading Southern Democrats to support House Democratic leadership. Though Wright never chaired a House committee or a high-profile subcommittee, he used his outgoing personality to obtain commitments from friends and his two decades of seniority on the Public Works Committee to amass obligations from colleagues by helping secure funding for federal buildings, roads, highway interchanges, and water projects. These efforts left him well-positioned to campaign for a position in the House leadership when a vacancy occurred.

In the December 1976 House Democratic leadership elections, Majority Leader Tip O&#x27;Neill faced no opposition to succeed Carl Albert as Speaker of the House. The contest to succeed O&#x27;Neill included Wright, Phillip Burton, Richard Bolling, and John McFall. Burton was assumed to be the frontrunner, and on the first ballot, he received 106 votes, Bolling 81, Wright 77, and McFall 31. According to Democratic caucus rules, the low finisher was obligated to withdraw, which McFall did. On the second ballot, Burton received 107 votes, Wright 95, and Bolling 93. With Bolling eliminated, on the third ballot, Wright won with 148 votes to 147 for Burton.

===Speaker of the House===

When the 100th Congress convened on January 6, 1987, Wright was elected Speaker of the House (254–173 over Republican Robert H. Michel), succeeding Tip O&#x27;Neill, who had retired after 10 years in the post. At the time, Wright stated that being speaker of the House &quot;is the greatest responsibility that can come to a lawmaker anywhere in the world.&quot;

In July 1988, he chaired the Democratic Party convention that nominated Michael Dukakis for president. During that convention, Wright introduced John F. Kennedy Jr. for Kennedy&#x27;s first televised speech. Almost 25 years earlier, on November 22, 1963, President John F. Kennedy, in his last speech before being assassinated, praised Wright&#x27;s service in the Congress, saying &quot;and here in Fort Worth he has contributed to its growth. He speaks for Fort Worth and he speaks for the country, and I don&#x27;t know any city that is better represented in the Congress of the United States than Fort Worth.&quot;

While Dukakis lost the 1988 presidential election to Republican George H. W. Bush, Democrats retained control of the House in the coinciding congressional elections, thus when the 101st Congress opened on January 3, 1989, Wright was re-elected as speaker. According to historian Julian E. Zelizer, the majority Democrats ran roughshod over the Republican (GOP) minority. They minimized the number of staff positions available to the minority, kept them out of decision-making, and gerrymandered their home districts. Firebrand Republican Newt Gingrich argued that American democracy was being ruined by the Democrats&#x27; tactics and that the GOP had to destroy the system before it could be saved. Cooperation in governance, says Zelizer, was put aside as they deposed Speaker Wright and regained power. Gingrich gained support from the media and from good government forces in his crusade to persuade Americans that the system was, in Gingrich&#x27;s words, “morally, intellectually and spiritually corrupt.” Gingrich did force out Wright, but after he became Speaker Gingrich was himself forced out and scandal ruined the careers of other top GOP leaders.

====Aide controversy====
In May 1989, controversy arose when media reports revealed that Wright&#x27;s top assistant, John Mack, had violently attacked a woman 16 years earlier. The woman, Pamela Small, was hit repeatedly with a hammer, stabbed and slashed with a knife and left for dead. Small survived the attack, and reported it to the police. Mack was convicted of malicious wounding and was sentenced to 15 years in prison, but was paroled after serving 27 months. Mack, whose brother was married to Wright&#x27;s daughter, was given a clerk&#x27;s job in the Capitol upon his release. He went on to become the executive director of the Democratic Steering and Policy Committee and served as Wright&#x27;s chief legislative strategist. Critics, including feminist activist Andrea Dworkin, alleged that Wright manipulated the legal system to get Mack off and, subsequently, protected him from media scrutiny. Amid the blistering public condemnation, John Mack resigned from his post on May 11, and House members of both parties began to question whether Wright could long-remain as speaker.

====Ethics investigation and resignation====

In 1988 Wright became the target of an inquiry by the House Ethics Committee. Their report in early 1989 implied that he had used bulk purchases of his book, &quot;Reflections of a Public Man&quot;, to earn speaking fees in excess of the allowed maximum, and that his wife, Betty, was given a make work job and perks to avoid the limit on gifts. Faced with an increasing loss of effectiveness, Wright tendered his resignation as Speaker on May 31, 1989, the resignation to become effective on the selection of a successor. He was the first Speaker to resign because of a scandal. On June 6, the Democratic Caucus brought Wright&#x27;s speakership to an end by selecting his replacement, Tom Foley of Washington, and on June 30 Wright resigned his seat in Congress.

The incident was controversial and was a part of the increasing partisan infighting that has plagued the Congress ever since. The original charges were filed by Newt Gingrich in 1988 and their effect propelled Gingrich&#x27;s own career advancement to the Speaker&#x27;s chair.

Michael Parenti, critic of the national security state, attributed Wright&#x27;s forced resignation to the critical questions he was raising in the late 1980s with regard to CIA covert actions in Nicaragua. Wright had not only criticized Reagan&#x27;s policy, but taken the extremely unusual step of entering into negotiations with the Nicaraguan government as Speaker.

William K. Black claims that Wright&#x27;s interventions in the Savings and Loan (S&amp;L) crisis &quot;were decisive in forcing him to resign in disgrace from the House&quot;. Black wrote that Wright had been saved from financial ruin and elevated to Speaker of the House by massive campaign contributions from control frauds like Charles Keating. The control frauds managed to get hundreds of executives of S&amp;Ls, many legitimate, to talk with their representatives in the US congress to delay effective governmental action against the frauds. This action only increased (a) the billions of dollars their ultimate failures cost the US taxpayers and (b) the magnitude of the resulting scandal. Wright&#x27;s account of these facts was very different, citing both abuse of power by regulators, and money laundering by S&amp;Ls in the profits diverted to Nicaragua in the Iran-Contra scandal. The scandal robbed Wright&#x27;s Democratic party of the &quot;sleaze factor&quot; issue in the 1988 presidential election, thereby handing the election to the Republican George H. W. Bush, according to Black. He resigned to avoid the official documentation of his role in this that would almost certainly have come from hearings by the United States House Committee on Ethics, as it did for the Keating Five. Wright&#x27;s personal and public account of why he resigned was very different from that cited by William Black, who claimed Wright abused his power and certainly had reason to protect his own position and decisions at the Federal Home Loan Bank.

The charges filed against Wright did not mention Nicaragua. The Iran-Contra operations from 1984 through most of 1986 involved the secret governmental support of Contra military and paramilitary activities in Nicaragua, despite Congressional prohibition on the support. The Reagan White House was very involved in the sale of U.S. arms to Iran in contravention of stated U.S. policy and in possible violation of arms-export controls. In late November 1986, Reagan Administration officials announced that some of the proceeds from the sale of U.S. arms to Iran had been diverted to the Contras. President Bush&#x27;s pardon of Secretary Weinberger on December 24, 1992, pre-empted a trial in which defense counsel indicated that they intended to call Bush as a witness.

A report by special counsel implicated him in a number of influence peddling charges, such as Vernon Savings and Loan, and attempting to get William K. Black fired as the deputy director of the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation (FSLIC) under Gray. However, the charges against him concluded that, &quot;while the Congressman&#x27;s dealings with representatives of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board may have been intemperate, the committee was not persuaded that there is reason to believe that he exercised undue influence in his dealings with that agency.&quot;

==Life after Congress==
After his resignation from the House, Wright retired to Fort Worth. He served as a professor at Texas Christian University there, teaching a course titled &quot;Congress and the Presidents.&quot; He also wrote several books after his retirement. He was an avid reader but was stricken with macular degeneration.

In November 2013, Wright was denied a voter ID card at a Texas Department of Public Safety office, as he hadn&#x27;t brought the duly-required documentation with him on the day of his visit. He told the &quot;Fort Worth Star Telegram&quot; that &quot;Nobody was ugly to us, but they insisted that they wouldn&#x27;t give me an ID.&quot; Wright expressed concern that the Texas voter ID law will unfairly deny elderly voters like himself the ability to vote. Wright indicated that he had worked out a solution with the Texas DPS that would allow him to cast a ballot in an upcoming election, but feared that other elderly people, especially those in retirement homes, would be unable to navigate the requirements.

Toward the end of his life, in May 2014, Wright expressed regret over resigning as Speaker of the House. He said it may have been a &quot;gross misjudgment&quot; at the time.

==Death==
Wright died at the age of 92 on May 6, 2015. He was survived by his wife Betty and four children. He had previously undergone surgery twice to treat cancer, though it is not clear if his death was cancer-related.

House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-CA, stated, &quot;Speaker Wright was a person of deep courage, brilliant eloquence, and complete mastery of the legislative process. Speaker Wright&#x27;s strong, decisive leadership built an indelible legacy of progress, not only in his beloved state of Texas, but around the world. Wright championed prosperity for every working family, and helped lead the way to peace to Central America.&quot; The Speaker of the House, John Boehner, R-OH, stated that, &quot;Speaker Wright understood as well as anyone this institution&#x27;s closeness to the people, calling the House &#x27;the raw essence of the nation&#x27;.&quot; President Barack Obama stated, &quot;As a representative from Texas and Speaker of the House, Jim was passionate about investing in infrastructure, and he worked tirelessly to promote peace in Central America. Today, our thoughts and prayers are with Jim&#x27;s family and friends, and the people he represented in Congress for so many years.&quot;

<text>Anthony David Steen CBE (born 22 July 1939) is a former British Conservative Party politician and barrister. He was a Member of Parliament (MP) from 1974 to 2010, and the Chairman of the Human Trafficking Foundation. Having represented Totnes in Devon since 1997, he was previously MP for South Hams from 1983, and had also been the MP for Liverpool Wavertree between February 1974 and 1983. From 1992 to 1994, he was Parliamentary Private Secretary (PPS) to Peter Brooke MP as Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport.

Steen is widely acknowledged as one of the leading figures acting to combat human trafficking in the UK, and in 2015 he was appointed a CBE in recognition of his contribution to the fight against modern slavery. In February 2016, Steen and Baron Randall of Uxbridge were appointed Special Envoys on modern slavery to the Mayor of London.

==Early life==

Anthony David Steen was born in July 1939 to Stephen Nicholas Steen (formerly Stein), one time Chairman and President of Smith &amp; Nephew, and Jacqueline Annette, daughter of William (formerly Wolko or Woolf) Slavouski, a Russian fur and skin trader. He attended Westminster School and University College London where he gained an LLB. He became a barrister in 1962.

Steen worked at the Bernhard Baron Settlement as a youth club leader with Sir Basil Henriques, an East London magistrate, from 1959 to 1967. Whilst at the Settlement, in 1964, he founded Task Force, an organisation to enable young people to help the elderly, and served as its director from 1964 to 1968, employing 50 full-time staff. By 1967, Task Force had recruited 15,000 young volunteers, in their teens and twenties, from across London to help with over 7,000 vulnerable elderly and lonely people living within the 32 London boroughs. They offered practical work such as gardening, shopping, redecorating. Task Force worked with the majority of London boroughs and its units have, over the years, since been assimilated either within those local authorities&#x27; budgets or joined forces with existing NGOs working with the elderly. The Task Force Trust was launched in 1974 to raise additional money for youth volunteering. he Trust continues to exist and is presently funding projects which link asylum-seekers with local communities.

In 1963, Sir John Foster, then MP for Northwich, highlighted Steen&#x27;s work in an Adjournment Debate in the House of Commons. As a result, Christopher Chataway MP, a junior minister for education (from 1962 to 1964), offered government funding for Task Force. The subsequent government, under Prime Minister Harold Wilson, asked Steen to head up a national equivalent to Task Force. The Young Volunteer Force Foundation (YVFF) was launched in 1968 at 10 Downing Street, with the object of recruiting young people throughout the UK to tackle community and social problems, to encourage altruism, promote people to care for those less fortunate than themselves. YVFF employed around 100 young people. The chairman was Selwyn Lloyd MP, a former Chancellor and Foreign Secretary, and the Vice-Chairmen were Jo Grimond MP, Leader of the Liberal Party, and Douglas Houghton MP, Chairman of the Labour Party. Projects were launched in England, Scotland and Wales, resulting in greater community involvement and social awareness. The Young Volunteer Force was subsequently renamed the Community Development Foundation. Steen was its first director, serving from 1968 to 1974. It was the largest organisation of its kind, and attracted over £1 million of government grant annually.

In 1981, Miles Copeland, Manager of the Police Pop Group, invited Steen to be Chairman of the Outlandos Trust, a charity funded by Police concerts. It provided musical instruments for musically gifted but underprivileged young people. The Trust distributed over £180,000 worth of musical instruments. In 1978, Steen set up &#x27;Thatcher&#x27;s&#x27;, a fund-raising tearoom in Liverpool, which was opened by
Margaret Thatcher, then Leader of the Opposition. Run by the local Conservative association, it raised money for local charities. From 1991 to 2010, Steen was a Trustee of the Dartington International Summer School,
having been an aspiring young pianist. From 1993 to 2012, he was a trustee of Education Extra, a charity set up by Lord Young of Dartington to promote after-school activities in areas of urban deprivation.

==Legal career==

Steen was a pupil in Heathcote Williams QC, Leonard Caplan QC Chambers, and was offered a tenancy by Sir John Foster MP QC in his Hare Court Chambers. He was called to the Bar in 1962 (Gray&#x27;s Inn) and practised as a Barrister in landlord and tenant and common law from 1962 to 1974. He worked on the Court Martial&#x27;s Defence Counsel for the Ministry of Defence from 1964 to 1968, lectured in law for the Council of Legal Education, 1964–67, and acted for the National Union of Headteachers from 1968 to 1972. He championed pro-bono legal advice at the Mary Ward Advice Centre. In 1970–71, he served as an adviser to federal and provincial Canadian governments on unemployment and youth issues. He retired from the Bar in 1983.

==Parliamentary career==
Steen served as Member of Parliament for Liverpool Wavertree from February 1974 to 1983, and for Totnes from 1983 to 2010 (South Hams 1983 to 1997).

In the House of Commons, Steen served as a member of the Select Committee on Immigration and Race Relations (1975–79), as Vice-Chairman of the Select Committee on Social Services (1979–81) and subsequently as a member of that committee (1990–95), as Vice-Chairman of the Select Committee on the Environment (1983–85), and subsequently as a member of that committee (1991–94), as Chairman of the Urban and Inner City Committee (1987–92), as a member of the European Scrutiny Committee (1997-2010). He was also Chairman of the group of Conservative MPs elected in the 1974 general elections, and chaired the Conservative backbench committees on youth and young children (1976–79) and urban affairs and new towns (1979–83), and served as Chairman of the Conservative Deregulation Committee (1993–97) and of the West Country Members’ Group (1992–94). He was also Vice Chairman of the All-Party Fisheries Committee (1997-2010), Chairman of the All-Party Group on Trafficking of Women and Children (2006–10), Chairman of the backbench Sane Planning Group (1987–92), and a member of the Parliamentary Population and Development Group (1987–92). He was elected by Conservative MPs as Secretary of the Conservative Backbench 1922 Committee (2001–10).

From 1992 to 1994, Steen served as Parliamentary Private Secretary (PPS) to the Rt Hon Peter Brooke MP when the latter was Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport in government of Prime Minister John Major.

In 1985, Steen piloted the Dartmoor Commons Bill through Parliament. In 1993–94, his three Ten Minute Rule Bills on deregulation contributed to the Major government&#x27;s Deregulation Initiative. In 1994, he initiated a Ten Minute Rule Bill, the French Language Bill, which proposed to ban the use of words of French origin in the UK, to &#x27;highlight the bizarre situation&#x27;, as he put it, whereby the French National Assembly and Senate had recently passed legislation banning the use of English words and expressions, such &#x27;software&#x27;, &#x27;tee-shirt&#x27; and &#x27;hamburger&#x27;, in France. A &#x27;tongue in cheek&#x27; initiative, it would have been administered by traffic wardens. In 2000, he initiated a Private Member&#x27;s Bill on urban regeneration and protection of the countryside.
In his role as chairman of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on the Trafficking of Women and Children, Steen did much to raise awareness of the scourge of human trafficking in the UK.. In February 2010, Steen saw his Private Member&#x27;s Bill to establish a national Anti-Slavery Day adopted by the House of Commons, as the Anti-Slavery Day Act. Since then there have been two annual events to mark Anti-Slavery Day - on 18 October each year - and to raise awareness of the issue of human trafficking in the UK. In 2011, activities took place across the country, including a reception at 10 Downing Street to mark the occasion, hosted by Prime Minister David Cameron, whilst the inaugural Human Trafficking Foundation Media Awards, when the Commons Speaker and Home Secretary give awards to journalists, broadcasters and film makers in recognition of their fight to end slavery, took place at Westminster.

Viewed as on the centre-left of the Conservative Party, Steen backed Kenneth Clarke&#x27;s three leadership bids in 1997, 2001 and 2005. In 2001, he denounced the supporters of Iain Duncan Smith as &#x27;bigots&#x27;. Steen describes himself as a &#x27;Euro-pragmatist&#x27; and was in favour of the UK continued membership of the European Union, voting to remain in the June 2016 referendum.

===Expenses scandal===

In May 2009, Steen was involved in the parliamentary expenses scandal. He was reported by &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; to have claimed over £87,000 on his constituency mansion which he designated as his second home. Expenses included items for rabbit fencing, tree surgery (his home is surrounded by 500 trees, he also claimed for their inspection,) woodland consultants and bore hole maintenance. As a result, he announced he would not contest the next general election.

===Campaign against Human Trafficking===

Since 2005, Steen has concentrated on issues related to modern-day slavery and human trafficking. In 2006, he established the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Human Trafficking of Women and Children, with the then Speaker of the House of Commons, Michael Martin MP as its first president. He campaigned for the UK to sign the European Convention of Action against Trafficking in Human Beings. In October 2007, he was awarded the Children&#x27;s Champion Award in recognition of his advocacy of the rights of trafficked children in the UK.

In 2010, Steen established the Human Trafficking Foundation, an organisation (of which he is executive chairman) that works with NGOs and charities in the sector combatting human trafficking around the UK.The foundation has worked with ECPAT UK and Asociata High Level Group for Children (Romania) to establish &#x27;Parliamentarians Against Human Trafficking&#x27;, a Europe-wide project to forge a network of parliamentarians across the continent fighting human trafficking.

In 2015, Steen served as special envoy to the prime minister and to Parliament&#x27;s Joint Select Committee on the draft Modern Slavery Bill. In February 2016, Steen and Baron Randall of Uxbridge (then Sir John Randall MP) were appointed special envoys on modern slavery to the mayor of London. In October 2018, Steen was appointed a specialist adviser, representing NGOs and civil society, on a review into the operation of the Modern Slavery Act. In November 2018, he was appointed specialist adviser on modern slavery to the Home Affairs Select Committee in the House of Commons.

==Personal life==

He married Carolyn Padfield in 1966. She is a child psychologist. They have a son, Jason, who has a consultancy in London specialising in aviation and is married with two children, living in London, and a daughter, Xanthe, who is a qualified teacher and has worked as a television presenter and writer in London.

<doc id="450501" wikidata="Q328791" url="?curid=450501" title="Gary Streeter">
<text>Sir Gary Nicholas Streeter (born 2 October 1955) is a Conservative Party politician in the United Kingdom. He served as a Member of Parliament (MP) for over 30 years, representing South West Devon from its creation in 1997 to 2024, and previously holding its main predecessor seat of Plymouth Sutton, from which the majority its electorate was taken, between 1992 and 1997. During the Fifty-fifth Parliament, Streeter had been the longest-serving MP representing a constituency in the county of Devon.

== Early life ==
Streeter attended Tiverton Grammar School, Tiverton, Devon, where he was head boy from 1972 to 1973, then King&#x27;s College London, where he gained a first-class honours law degree. From 1984 to 1998, he was a solicitor and partner at Foot and Bowden (now called Foot Anstey) in Plymouth, where he specialised in company and employment law. In 1998 Streeter was fined £1,000 by the Law Society for conduct unbecoming a solicitor due to a conflict of interest when dealing with a business merger in 1991 while with Foot Bowden Limited. 

Streeter&#x27;s initial political experience was as a councillor on Plymouth City Council, where he represented Mount Gould ward from 1986 to 1992. Having been elected to serve as a member of the Social Democratic Party (SDP), in January 1988 he defected to the Conservative Party. Reflecting on his career in an interview with the Plymouth &quot;Evening Herald&quot; years later, Streeter attributed his initial party allegiance to the influence of David Owen, then SDP leader and MP for Plymouth Devonport, but explained that by 1988 he had come to &quot;believe strongly in individual responsibility, in the family, the nation, enterprise. I thought to myself &#x27;I am a natural Conservative, what am I doing in the SDP?&#x27; So I crossed over.&quot;

== Parliamentary career ==
Streeter served as a junior minister in the Lord Chancellor&#x27;s Department under Prime Minister John Major from 1996 until the defeat of the Major Government in 1997, and was Shadow Secretary of State for International Development in the Shadow Cabinet of William Hague from 1998 until the new Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith returned him to the backbenches in 2001.

He is currently a member of the Speaker&#x27;s Committee on the Electoral Commission and is the member of the committee responsible for answering oral questions in Parliament on behalf of the Electoral Commission. He assumed the role after Sir Peter Viggers stepped down during the MPs&#x27; expenses scandal. His own expenses for 2008/09 were £162,719, ranking 158th out of 647 MPs.

In March 2012, Streeter was one of three MPs who signed a letter to the Advertising Standards Authority asking it to reverse its decision to stop the Christian group &quot;Healing on the Streets of Bath&quot; from making explicit claims that prayer can heal. The letter called for the ASA to provide &quot;indisputable scientific evidence&quot; that faith healing did not work. Another signer, Tim Farron of the Liberal Democrats, later wrote that the letter was not &quot;well-worded&quot; and that he should not have signed it &quot;as it was written&quot;.

In 2013, Streeter referred to the &quot;familiar glint in the swivelled eyes of the purists&quot; within his own party in an article attacking the divisions caused by those activists who were calling for a referendum on EU membership. The remark followed allegations that senior members of the government had characterised Eurosceptic activists as &quot;swivel-eyed loons&quot;. Streeter argued that the result of party infighting over the issue would be &quot;a Labour-led government bend[ing] the knee to Brussels&quot;.

Streeter was opposed to Brexit prior to the 2016 referendum. In November 2018, Streeter announced his support for Theresa May&#x27;s Brexit agreement.

In December 2018, it was announced that Streeter would receive a knighthood in the 2019 New Year Honours List. Streeter told the Press Association that he hoped his honour reflected, in part, his work over the past decade as chairman of the all-party group on Christians in Parliament and supporting new MPs once they had arrived at Westminster.

Streeter was a supporter of Esther McVey during the 2019 Conservative Party leadership election and one of the proposers of her nomination. McVey was eliminated in the first round of voting. In later rounds he backed Sajid Javid, who was appointed Chancellor of the Exchequer by eventual victor Boris Johnson later that year.

Streeter was reelected at the 2019 general election with an increased majority. He briefly acted as Second Deputy Chairman of Ways and Means at the start of the 2019 Parliament. On 2 February 2022, Streeter announced that he had submitted a letter to the chairman of the 1922 Committee, seeking a motion of no confidence in the prime minister, Boris Johnson, stating that &quot;I cannot reconcile the pain and sacrifice of the vast majority of the British Public during lockdown with the attitude and activities of those working in Downing Street&quot;.

Following the resignation of Boris Johnson in July 2022, Streeter announced his support for Rishi Sunak in the subsequent July–September 2022 Conservative Party leadership election. He became the seventh MP to publicly call for the resignation of Prime Minister Liz Truss on 20 October.

On 25 November 2022, he announced that he would not seek re-election at the 2024 general election.

== Personal life ==
Streeter married Janet Stevens in 1978 in Barnstaple; the couple have a son and daughter, live near Plympton in Devon. He is a committed Christian.

In the 2015 election, his son Gareth was the Conservative candidate for Rother Valley in South Yorkshire. He polled third, behind incumbent Sir Kevin Barron and Cowles of UKIP. In 2023, Gareth Streeter was selected prospective parliamentary candidate for Plymouth Sutton and Devonport for the 2024 general election.

<doc id="450506" wikidata="Q328737" url="?curid=450506" title="Graham Stringer">
<text>Graham Eric Stringer (born 17 February 1950) is a British Labour politician who has served as Member of Parliament for Blackley and Middleton South since the 2024 general election. He has served as the area&#x27;s MP continuously since 1997, having previously represented the analoguous predecessor constituencies of Manchester Blackley (1997–2010), and Blackley and Broughton (2010–2024). He was Leader of Manchester City Council from 1984 to 1996 and served as chair of Manchester Airport from 1996 to 1997.

==Early life and career==
Graham Stringer was born on 17 February 1950 in Manchester. He attended Christ Church Primary School in Beswick and Openshaw Technical High School for Boys in Openshaw. After graduating in chemistry from the University of Sheffield in 1971, Stringer worked as an analytical chemist in the plastics industry.

He became a local councillor in Manchester in 1979, and was Manchester City Council leader from 1984 to 1996. He was also chair of Manchester Airport from 1996 to 1997.

==Parliamentary career==
He is a member of Labour Friends of Israel.

At the 1997 general election, Stringer was elected to Parliament as MP for Manchester Blackley with 70% of the vote and a majority of 19,588.

Stringer was a member of the Environment, Transport and Regional Affairs Select Committee until 1999. He then served as Parliamentary Secretary to the Cabinet Office until 2001.

At the 2001 general election, Stringer was re-elected as MP for Manchester Blackley with a decreased vote share of 68.9% and a decreased majority of 14,464. He was again re-elected at the 2005 general election with a decreased vote share of 62.3% and a decreased majority of 12,027.

After a spell on the back benches and as a government whip, he spent the last six years of the Labour Government as a member of the Transport Select Committee. He campaigned against a proposed Congestion Charge in Greater Manchester. 

In September 2008, Stringer became the first Labour MP to publicly call for Gordon Brown to resign as Prime Minister.

Prior to the 2010 general election, Stringer&#x27;s constituency of Manchester Blackley was abolished, and replaced with Blackley and Broughton. At the 2010 general election, Stringer was elected to Parliament as MP for Blackley and Broughton with 54.3% of the vote and a majority of 12,303.

In January 2011, he called for Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson, a lifelong Labour voter and vocal supporter of the party at elections, to be given a seat in the House of Lords. 

He was a critic of former Labour Party leader Ed Miliband, whom he accused in May 2014 of running an &quot;unforgivably unprofessional&quot; campaign, and referred to as &quot;not an asset on the doorsteps&quot; when campaigning.

At the 2015 general election, Stringer was re-elected as MP for Blackley and Broughton with an increased vote share of 61.9% and an increased majority of 16,874.

At the snap 2017 general election, Stringer was again re-elected with an increased vote share of 70.5% and an increased majority of 19,601.

Stringer was again re-elected at the 2019 general election, with a decreased vote share of 61.9% and a decreased majority of 14,402.

As a result of the 2023 Periodic Review of Westminster constituencies, Stringer&#x27;s constituency of Blackley and Broughton was abolished, and replaced with Blackley and Middleton South. In June 2024, Stringer was selected as the Labour candidate for Blackley and Middleton South, and he was duly elected at the 2024 general election with a decreased majority of 10,220.

==Political Views==

===Controversies on Dyslexia===
In January 2009, Stringer denied the existence of dyslexia, calling it &quot;a cruel fiction&quot; invented by &quot;the education establishment&quot; to divert blame for illiteracy from &quot;their eclectic and incomplete methods for instruction&quot;. The Dyslexia Action charity and the British Dyslexia Association criticised Stringer&#x27;s claims.
===Global Warming===
Stringer is a trustee of the Global Warming Policy Foundation, an organisation that promotes climate change denialism. As a member of the Science and Technology Committee, Stringer participated in the investigation into the Climatic Research Unit email controversy (&quot;Climategate&quot;) in 2010, questioning Phil Jones closely on transparency and other issues; in the five-member group producing the report, he voted against the other three voting members on every vote, representing a formulation more critical of the CRU and climate scientists.

In an op-ed in March 2011, Stringer criticised the British inquiries into the CRU email controversy, writing that the controversy &quot;demanded independent and objective scrutiny of the science by independent panels. This did not happen&quot;. 

Stringer contributed to the book &quot;What Next for Labour? Ideas for a New Generation&quot; in January 2012; his piece was entitled &quot;Transport Policy for the Twenty-First Century&quot;.

Stringer was a member of the Energy and Climate Change Select Committee from 2013 to 2015. In 2014, Stringer was one of two MPs on the committee to vote against the acceptance of the Intergovernmental Panel of Climate Change conclusion that humans are the dominant cause of global warming.

===Immigration===
In February 2014, Stringer, along with 98 others, voted for the Dominic Raab amendment to the Immigration Bill, aimed at preventing foreign criminals using European Human Rights Law in deportation cases.

===Brexit===

Stringer has established a reputation as a prominent Eurosceptic in the Labour Party who favoured a referendum on the EU. He called for Britain to leave the EU in the 2016 Brexit referendum, describing the EU as a barrier to a progressive government. 

On 17 July 2018, a vote was held on whether the United Kingdom should remain in the customs union in the event of a no deal Brexit. Frank Field, Kate Hoey, John Mann and Stringer were the only Labour MPs to oppose the amendment, which was voted down by 307 votes to 301.

===COVID-19===

On 21 October 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, Stringer was the only Labour MP to vote against implementing stricter lockdown in the North West of England, an area that includes his own constituency in Greater Manchester.

==Personal life==
In 1999, he married Kathryn Carr; they have three children. In the 2021 BBC One drama &quot;The Trick&quot;, a dramatisation of the Climategate scandal, Stringer was portrayed by Andrew Dunn.

<doc id="450508" wikidata="Q315661" url="?curid=450508" title="Pierre Werner">
<text>Pierre Werner (29 December 1913 – 24 June 2002) was a Luxembourgish politician in the Christian Social People&#x27;s Party (CSV) who was the 19th prime minister of Luxembourg from 1959 to 1974 and the 21st from 1979 to 1984.

==Training and early activities==

Pierre Werner was born in Saint-André-lez-Lille, Nord, France, to parents from Luxembourg. He studied at the &quot;Cours Supérieurs de Luxembourg&quot; (a forerunner to the University of Luxembourg) from 1933 to 1934 and continued his higher education at the Law Faculty of the University of Paris and the École libre des sciences politiques from 1934 to 1937. In 1938, he completed a PhD in law in Luxembourg. He was involved in several student organisations, becoming chairman of the Association of Catholic Students from 1935 to 1937 and vice-president of the Pax Romana movement (The International Movement for Intellectual and Cultural Affairs) in 1937.

In 1938 he became a lawyer in Luxembourg City, before becoming a banker instead. During the Nazi occupation of Luxembourg (1940–1945) Werner gave clandestine support to the resistance against the occupation forces. After World War II he became the Controller of the banking system in his country. He attended the Bretton Woods Conference which set up the International Monetary Fund (IMF).

== Government ==
Werner was appointed as Finance Minister of Luxembourg in 1953, and was 19th and 21st Prime Minister from 1959 to 1974 and from 1979 to 1984. He also served as Minister for Culture.

As head of government, he governed in coalition with the Democratic Party (1959–1964), then the Luxembourg Socialist Workers&#x27; Party (1964–1969), then the DP again (1969–1974). Werner and the CSV went into opposition for the first time since World War II from 1974 to 1979. When he returned to power, his last government was another coalition with the DP (1979–1984).

Werner was instrumental in solving the &quot;empty chair&quot; crisis provoked in 1965 by President Charles de Gaulle who, dissatisfied with the orientations of European integration at that time, had decided France would suspend its participation in meetings with other Member States; Werner persuaded France to resume its seat, thus re-enabling the decision-making process. In 1970, Werner was given the mandate by the heads of State or government to draft, with a group of experts, a blueprint for an economic and monetary union within the EEC. His report advocated gradual reforms, the irreversible fixing of exchange rates, and the introduction of a single currency within a decade. As it happened, the plan was not implemented at the time, due to internal political disagreements, and the oil crisis; however the “Werner Plan” was later revived and extended by Jacques Delors. Its principles were enshrined in the Treaty of Maastricht, paving the way for the single European currency, i.e. the euro.

As Prime Minister, Werner, a Christian Democrat, undertook the diversification of the national economy, hard hit by a major Europe-wide crisis in the steel industry, by attracting new industrial investments, as well as financial services to the Grand Duchy. He placed Luxembourg on the map of global satellite communications. He is remembered for having used &quot;tripartite&quot; social mediation (industry, labour and government) to overcome the severe steel crisis which lasted from 1979 to 1984. He placed the process of European integration at the centre of the policy of his country. With friends such as Joseph Bech, Jean Monnet and Robert Schuman, Werner was a determined advocate of European integration. During his terms in office, he negotiated the relocation of several European institutions to Luxembourg.

The Pierre Werner Institute (Institut Pierre Werner, IPW) was created in Luxembourg in 2003 at the behest of the Foreign Ministers of France, Germany and Luxembourg (at the time, respectively Dominique de Villepin, Joschka Fischer and Lydie Polfer), the project having been fostered by Erna Hennicot-Schoepges, then Minister for Culture, Universities and Research in Luxembourg. IPW organises seminars and conferences aimed at promoting better understanding among the three founding countries, but also more widely throughout Europe.

Werner, a sponsor of culture and especially music, actively promoted the restoration of Luxembourg&#x27;s heritage (e.g. Vianden Castle). A fan of cricket since living in London, the United Kingdom, in 1930, Werner was Honorary President of the Optimists Cricket Club, which he promoted during, between, and after his premierships. In his honour, Luxembourg&#x27;s main cricket ground, the Pierre Werner Cricket Ground in Walferdange, is named after him.

Pierre Werner died on 24 June 2002, in Luxembourg City.

==Political responsibilities==

Pierre Werner served as &#x27;President of the Government&#x27; (Prime Minister) from 1959 to 1974 and from 1979 to 1984.&lt;br&gt;On each occasion this post was combined with several ministerial portfolios :

* 1954–1959: Minister of Finance and Minister of the Armed Forces;
* 1959–1964: President of the Government and Minister of Finance;
* 1964–1967: President of the Government, Minister for the Treasury, Minister for Foreign Affairs, Minister for Justice;
* 1967–1969: President of the Government, Minister for the Treasury, Minister for the Civil Service;
* 1969–1974: President of the Government, Minister for Finance;
* 1979–1984: President of the Government.

Werner was a member of parliament and leader of the CSV from 1974 to 1979. During this period he was the leader of the parliamentary opposition. In 1979 the CSV won the parliamentary elections in Luxembourg.
At this time, Werner was also elected to the European Parliament but he chose not to sit as an MEP, to serve as President of the Government.

==Other activities==

After withdrawing from politics in 1984, Pierre Werner continued to assume some official duties and pursue cultural activities.
From 1985 to 1987, he was Chairman of the Governing Board of the &quot;Compagnie luxembourgeoise de télédiffusion&quot; (CLT, Radio Luxembourg). Werner placed Luxembourg on the map of global satellite communications.
From 1989 to 1996, he was chairman of the board directors of the Société Européenne des Satellites, becoming honorary chairman in 1996. During this last term of office, he had laid the ground for the establishment of this company. He worked hard both within Luxembourg and abroad to realise his vision for a medium-power satellite in Luxembourg, enabling his country to become a forerunner in global satellite telecommunications.

Pierre Werner was also a member of the National Ethics Committee of Luxembourg.

<text>Robert Andrew Stunell, Baron Stunell, (24 November 1942 – 29 April 2024) was a British Liberal Democrat politician who served as Member of Parliament for Hazel Grove from 1997 until he stood down in 2015, and then as a member of the House of Lords from 2015.

From 2010 to 2012 he served as the parliamentary under-secretary of state at the Department of Communities and Local Government. He was nominated for a life peerage in the 2015 Dissolution Honours.

== Early life and career ==
Andrew Stunell was born in Sutton, Surrey. He was educated at Surbiton County Grammar School for Boys, before studying architecture at the University of Manchester and Liverpool Polytechnic. He became a member of RIBA in 1969.

Stunell married Gillian Chorley in 1967. They have three sons and two daughters. He was a former Baptist lay preacher and an active member of his local Methodist church.

After graduation he was an architectural assistant until 1989, working for CWS Manchester from 1965 to 1967, Runcorn New Town from 1967 to 1981, then freelance 1981–5. From 1989 to 1996 he worked as Political Secretary of the Association of Liberal Democrat Councillors and was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 1995 New Year Honours.

Stunell was elected to Chester City Council in 1979 and to Cheshire County Council in 1981. He subsequently served on Stockport Council for six years, remaining on the Council for a time after his election as an MP. He contested the City of Chester constituency three times, as the Liberal Party candidate in 1979 and for the SDP-Liberal Alliance in 1983 and 1987.

== Member of Parliament, 1997–2015 ==

=== Hazel Grove ===
Stunell was elected as the member of parliament for Hazel Grove in 1997 having fought the seat previously in 1992 when he came second with 43.1% of the vote. The general election of 1997 resulted in a majority of 11,814 and a 54.5% of the vote, taking the seat from the Conservatives. He retained the seat at the 2001 (52%), 2005 (49.5%) and 2010 (48.8%) general elections.

=== Liberal Democrat Frontbench ===

On entering parliament in 1997 Stunell was appointed the Shadow Energy minister under Paddy Ashdown, a role he performed until 2005. At the same time Stunell operated as the party&#x27;s deputy chief whip, only stepping down from that position in 2001 when he was elected to the position of Chief Whip, a position he was re-elected to in 2005. He stood down from the role in March 2006 to serve as the Shadow Secretary of State for communities and local government which concluded in December 2007 when Nick Clegg asked him to become chair of the Liberal Democrat local elections team. In January 2009 Stunell was appointed to be the Liberal Democrat representative on the International Development Select Committee and in August 2009 he was asked to take on the role of vice-chair of the general election campaign.

Following the general election of 2010, no one political party was able to secure a majority in the House of Commons. As a result, the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats entered into negotiations with each other to form the United Kingdom&#x27;s first coalition government since the Second World War.

Stunell along with Danny Alexander, Chris Huhne and David Laws acted as the negotiating team for the Liberal Democrats with William Hague, Oliver Letwin, George Osborne and Edward Llewellyn acting for the Conservatives.

His responsibilities in the role were community cohesion, race equality, building regulations and the implementation of the Big Society particularly with regard to housing and regeneration.

He was sworn in as a member of the Privy Council of the United Kingdom on 7 November 2012 at Buckingham Palace. This entitled him to the Honorific Prefix &quot;The Right Honourable&quot; for life.

Stunell was knighted for public and political service in the 2013 Birthday Honours. receiving the accolade from the Prince of Wales on 24 January 2014.

In 2013 he announced that he would be stepping down at the next general election.

==Life peerage==

<text>Gerard Sutcliffe (born 13 May 1953) is a British Labour Party politician who was Member of Parliament (MP) for Bradford South from 1994 to 2015. He was the Minister for Sport and Tourism in the Brown Government.

== Biography ==

Born in Salford, Sutcliffe was educated in Bradford at Cardinal Hinsley Grammar School, but left aged sixteen, and then worked as a salesman and for a printers company, becoming a deputy branch secretary of the print workers trade union SOGAT. He was a member of Bradford City Council from 1982 to 1994, serving as the council&#x27;s leader from 1992 to 1994.

When Bradford South&#x27;s Labour MP Bob Cryer was killed in a car crash in April 1994, Sutcliffe was selected as the Labour candidate for the resulting by-election. He won the by-election with 55% of the vote, and held the seat until he stood down in 2015.

In Parliament, he served on the Public Accounts Committee from 1996 to 1998, and was a member of the Unopposed Bills Panel from 1997 to 1999.

After the 1997 general election, when a Labour government took power under Tony Blair, Sutcliffe was appointed as Parliamentary Private Secretary (PPS) to Harriet Harman, the Secretary of State for Social Security. After Harman was dismissed from the Cabinet in July 1998, he served as PPS to Stephen Byers, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury. When Byers was promoted to Secretary of State for Trade and Industry in December 1998, Sutcliffe remained his PPS.

From 2003 to 2006 he was Parliamentary Under Secretary of State at the Department of Trade and Industry, with responsibility for employment and for consumer and competition policy. In the May 2006 reshuffle he was moved to the Home Office, as Minister for Prisons and the Probation Service. As part of the reorganisation of the Home Office he became Parliamentary Under Secretary of State at the newly formed Ministry of Justice in May 2007. He stayed there only a short time until the reshuffle on 29 June 2007, when he was moved to the Department for Culture, Media and Sport.

As Minister for Sport at the time of the Beijing Olympics he entered a wager with his Australian counterpart Kate Ellis that Great Britain would finish above Australia in the final medal table, with each Minister promising to wear the opposite nation&#x27;s colours to a sporting event if they lose. Sutcliffe won the bet, with Britain finishing fourth and Australia sixth.

Sutcliffe supported Andy Burnham in the 2010 Labour Party leadership election and acted as Burnham&#x27;s campaign manager. From 2010 until 2011, Sutcliffe served as Shadow Minister for Immigration. In May 2014, Sutcliffe announced that he would stand down at the following general election. He is a member of Unite the Union.

<doc id="450515" wikidata="Q2410467" url="?curid=450515" title="Azuma's inequality">
<text>In probability theory, the Azuma–Hoeffding inequality (named after Kazuoki Azuma and Wassily Hoeffding) gives a concentration result for the values of martingales that have bounded differences.

Suppose formula_1 is a martingale (or super-martingale) and

:formula_2

almost surely. Then for all positive integers &quot;N&quot; and all positive reals &quot;formula_3&quot;,

:formula_4

And symmetrically (when &quot;X&quot;&quot;k&quot; is a sub-martingale):

:formula_5

If &quot;X&quot; is a martingale, using both inequalities above and applying the union bound allows one to obtain a two-sided bound:

:formula_6

==Proof==
The proof shares similar idea of the proof for the general form of Azuma&#x27;s inequality listed below. Actually, this can be viewed as a direct corollary of the general form of Azuma&#x27;s inequality.

==A general form of Azuma&#x27;s inequality==

===Limitation of the vanilla Azuma&#x27;s inequality===
Note that the vanilla Azuma&#x27;s inequality requires symmetric bounds on martingale increments, i.e. formula_7. So, if known bound is asymmetric, e.g. formula_8, to use Azuma&#x27;s inequality, one need to choose formula_9 which might be a waste of information on the boundedness of formula_10. However, this issue can be resolved and one can obtain a tighter probability bound with the following general form of Azuma&#x27;s inequality.

===Statement===
Let formula_11 be a martingale (or supermartingale) with respect to filtration formula_12. Assume there are predictable processes formula_13 and formula_14 with respect to formula_15, i.e. for all formula_16, formula_17 are formula_18-measurable, and constants formula_19 such that
:formula_20
almost surely. Then for all formula_21,
:formula_22
Since a submartingale is a supermartingale with signs reversed, we have if instead formula_23 is a martingale (or submartingale),
:formula_24
If formula_23 is a martingale, since it is both a supermartingale and submartingale, by applying union bound to the two inequalities above, we could obtain the two-sided bound:
:formula_26

===Proof===
We will prove the supermartingale case only as the rest are self-evident. By Doob decomposition, we could decompose supermartingale formula_27 as formula_28 where formula_29 is a martingale and formula_30 is a nonincreasing predictable sequence (Note that if formula_27 itself is a martingale, then formula_32). From formula_33, we have
:formula_34
Applying Chernoff bound to formula_35, we have for formula_21,

:formula_37

For the inner expectation term, since 

(i) formula_38 as formula_39 is a martingale; 

(ii) formula_40;

(iii) formula_41 and formula_42 are both formula_18-measurable as formula_44 is a predictable process; 

(iv) formula_45;

by applying Hoeffding&#x27;s lemma, we have
:formula_46
Repeating this step, one could get
:formula_47
Note that the minimum is achieved at formula_48, so we have
:formula_49 
Finally, since formula_50 and formula_51 as formula_52 is nonincreasing, so event formula_53 implies formula_54, and therefore
:formula_55

===Remark===
Note that by setting formula_56, we could obtain the vanilla Azuma&#x27;s inequality.

Note that for either submartingale or supermartingale, only one side of Azuma&#x27;s inequality holds. We can&#x27;t say much about how fast a submartingale with bounded increments rises (or a supermartingale falls).

This general form of Azuma&#x27;s inequality applied to the Doob martingale gives McDiarmid&#x27;s inequality which is common in the analysis of randomized algorithms.
==Simple example of Azuma&#x27;s inequality for coin flips==
Let &quot;F&quot;&quot;i&quot; be a sequence of independent and identically distributed random coin flips (i.e., let &quot;F&quot;&quot;i&quot; be equally likely to be −1 or 1 independent of the other values of &quot;F&quot;&quot;i&quot;). Defining formula_57 yields a martingale with |&quot;X&quot;&quot;k&quot; − &quot;X&quot;&quot;k&quot;−1| ≤ 1, allowing us to apply Azuma&#x27;s inequality. Specifically, we get

:formula_58

For example, if we set &quot;t&quot; proportional to &quot;n&quot;, then this tells us that although the &quot;maximum&quot; possible value of &quot;X&quot;&quot;n&quot; scales linearly with &quot;n&quot;, the &quot;probability&quot; that the sum scales linearly with &quot;n&quot; decreases exponentially fast with &quot;n&quot;.

If we set formula_59 we get:

:formula_60

which means that the probability of deviating more than formula_61 approaches 0 as &quot;n&quot; goes to infinity.

==Remark==

A similar inequality was proved under weaker assumptions by Sergei Bernstein in 1937.

Hoeffding proved this result for independent variables rather than martingale differences, and also observed that slight modifications of his argument establish the result for martingale differences (see page 9 of his 1963 paper).

<text>Sir Desmond Angus Swayne (born 20 August 1956) is a British Conservative Party politician who has been the Member of Parliament for New Forest West since 1997.

Before going into politics, Swayne was a teacher, and then a manager at the Royal Bank of Scotland. He was Parliamentary Private Secretary to David Cameron, both during his time as Leader of the Opposition, 2005–10, and then for two years while Cameron was Prime Minister. In September 2012 he was appointed as Lord Commissioner of HM Treasury and in July 2014 as Minister for International Development. Swayne was knighted in the 2016 Birthday Honours for political and parliamentary services.

He was a supporter of the Eurosceptic pressure group Leave Means Leave. He is also a prominent critic of the British government response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

==Early life and career==
Desmond Swayne was born on 20 August 1956 in Bern, the capital of Switzerland, to George Joseph and Elizabeth McAlister Swayne (&quot;née&quot; Gibson). He was privately educated at Drumley House Preparatory School at Mossblown in South Ayrshire and Bedford School. He studied Theology at St Mary&#x27;s College at the University of St Andrews.

Swayne taught economics at Charterhouse School for one year followed by seven years at Wrekin College (both independent boarding schools). On 22 November 1986, as a prospective parliamentary candidate for a South Wales constituency, he was quoted in the &quot;Western Mail&quot; saying that &quot;the surest way to protect the public from AIDS is to outlaw homosexuality and lock up offenders&quot;. From 1987 to 1997, he was a computer systems manager at Royal Bank of Scotland.

===Military career===

On 2 August 1987, Swayne was commissioned into the Royal Armoured Corps, Territorial Army in the rank of second lieutenant (on probation). He served with the Queen&#x27;s Own Mercian Yeomanry. He was promoted to lieutenant on 2 August 1989, and to captain on 1 August 1992. On 1 November 1992, Swayne transferred to the newly formed Royal Mercian and Lancastrian Yeomanry. He was promoted to major on 14 December 1996 with seniority from 1 January 1996.

In 2003, he was called up and posted to Iraq as part of the Iraq War. He served for six months before returning to the House of Commons.

==Parliamentary career==
At the 1987 general election, Swayne stood as the Conservative Party candidate in Pontypridd, coming second with 19.5% of the vote behind the incumbent Labour MP Brynmor John.

Swayne again stood for Parliament at the 1992 general election in West Bromwich West, coming second with 35.5% of the vote behind the incumbent Labour MP Betty Boothroyd.

Swayne was elected to Parliament as MP for New Forest West at the 1997 general election with 50.6% of the vote and a majority of 11,332. In the subsequent Conservative Party leadership election, Swayne supported Michael Howard, and later John Redwood. 

From 1997 to 2001, he held shadow ministerial portfolios for Northern Ireland, health and defence and as a senior opposition whip. In September 2004, Swayne was appointed Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Leader of the Opposition.

At the 2001 general election, Swayne was re-elected as MP for New Forest West with an increased vote share of 55.7% and an increased majority of 13,191. He was again re-elected at the 2005 general election with an increased vote share of 56.4% and an increased majority of 17,285.

Following the election of David Cameron as leader of the Conservative Party in December 2005, Swayne was appointed as his PPS. In 2006, a series of Swayne&#x27;s e-mails to Cameron with unflattering descriptions of fellow Conservatives was leaked to the media.

As a result of the expenses scandal, Swayne repaid the £6,131 that he claimed for a new kitchen at his second-home flat in North Kensington in 2006, and £60.66 over claimed for a water bill. Swayne employs his wife Moira as part-time Executive Secretary/Office Manager. Swayne provided a full breakdown of his expenses on his website, and was found by local media in South Dorset to be the lowest claiming of the local MP expenses&#x27; league table, after claiming £94,754 expenses in 2007/08, compared with £91,737 in 2006/07.

In addition to his salary as an MP, in 2009 Swayne reportedly earned £12,000 a year as a director of property development firm Lewis Charles Sofia Property Fund, which predominantly specialises in holiday developments in Bulgaria; and around £5,000 in his role as a major in the Army Reserve.

At the 2010 general election, Swayne was again re-elected, with an increased vote share of 58.8% and a decreased majority of 16,896. After the election, Swayne maintained his role as a PPS in government. 

On 11 June 2011, it was announced Swayne would be appointed a Privy Counsellor in the Queen&#x27;s 2011 Birthday Honours List. On 13 July 2011, Swayne was duly sworn in as member of Council. In 2014, he was appointed as a minister for international development.

In the Commons he sits on the Ecclesiastical Committee (Joint Committee). He has previously sat on the International Trade Committee, the Administration Committee, the Defence Committee, the Procedure Committee, the Social Security Committee and Scottish Affairs Committee.

At the 2015 general election, Swayne was again re-elected, with an increased vote share of 59.9% and an increased majority of 20,604. He was again re-elected at the snap 2017 general election with an increased vote share of 66.8% and an increased majority of 23,431.

On 28 September 2019, Swayne remarked that &quot;blackface&quot; was an &quot;entirely acceptable bit of fun&quot;. On 30 September, it was reported that he wore blackface while attending a Blues Brothers themed party, where he was pictured posing as James Brown. Swayne said he &quot;went to some trouble to be as authentic as possible&quot; in creating the costume. After initially declining to apologise, Swayne later said he was sorry for any offence that he gave.

At the 2019 general election, Swayne was again re-elected, with a decreased vote share of 63.8% and an increased majority of 24,403.

In June 2020, responding to a question about the policing of protests following the police murder of George Floyd in the US, Swayne said &quot;looters, arsonists and rioters have it coming&quot;.

On 18 August 2021, Swayne suggested in Parliament that Afghan refugees should have been joining &quot;the resistance&quot; against a brutal regime rather than &quot;queuing at the airport&quot; after the fall of Kabul.

Swayne was again re-elected at the 2024 general election, with a decreased vote share of 35.4% and a decreased majority of 5,600.

=== COVID-19 pandemic ===
Swayne has been critical of the UK government&#x27;s response to the COVID-19 pandemic, especially the lockdown response after 24 March 2020. Swayne believes that the government should have taken a softer approach, including keeping shops and public spaces open as had the Swedish government, and that the government&#x27;s lockdown measures and policies were disproportionate to the threat posed by the virus.

Speaking to parliament in July 2020, Swayne described the Coronavirus law requiring the public to wear face masks in indoor public places as &quot;a monstrous imposition&quot;, and said that it would make him less likely to go shopping. In a television interview in December 2020 he called for the health and scientific lobby to be &quot;put in its place&quot; and said: &quot;they cannot go on telling us how we must live our lives forever.&quot;

In a speech in parliament on 28 September 2020, Swayne stated that &quot;the policy of the government has been disproportionate in response to this threat. There may be a virus one day that threatens our very way of life, but this is not it, even if we are behaving as if it were.&quot; Furthermore, he argued that the government had been following the advice of small group of scientists without doing their job as politicians and imposing &quot;a sense of proportion&quot; and &quot;not be in thrall&quot; of science.

Swayne believes that there has been &quot;censorship&quot; of opposing arguments or criticisms of the lockdown policies. On 15 October 2020 Swayne asked the Leader of the House of Commons if a debate could be held on censorship due to &quot;the sinister disappearance of the link from Google to the Great Barrington declaration&quot;. He has donated money to anti-lockdown demonstration organiser Piers Corbyn who had been fined for his breaching lockdown regulations.

It was reported in January 2021 that Swayne had said that some COVID-19 figures were being &quot;manipulated&quot;, and that it was &quot;difficult to reconcile&quot; occupation levels of intensive care units with being &quot;told there is a deathly, deadly pandemic proceeding&quot;. Swayne said that the NHS was &quot;bouncing round at the typical level of deaths for the time of year&quot;, although at the time he spoke the Office for National Statistics was reporting deaths as 14% above the five-year average. The comments were made in a November 2020 interview with Save Our Rights, an anti-mask and anti-lockdown movement that had made false claims about COVID vaccines, during which Swayne urged the group to &quot;persist&quot; in its work. When questioned on the matter in January 2021, Swayne stated that &quot;anyone who wants to talk to me about vaccines can consult my website or indeed my question I put to the Prime Minister yesterday [...] and you will see that you will see that I am the most enthusiastic vaxxer&quot; and said that he &quot;spoke to [Save Our Rights] exclusively about their campaign about lockdown because I share their objective. I&#x27;m against lockdown.&quot; Swayne&#x27;s comments were criticised by the Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH), arguing such comments would &quot;cost lives&quot;, and Deputy leader of the Labour Party Angela Rayner.

On 28 January 2021 the Minister for the Cabinet Office, Michael Gove, said that Swayne was &quot;completely out of order&quot; and should apologise. On the same day, Swayne responded to these comments on talkRADIO and Sky News. Angela Rayner urged action be taken against Swayne for endorsing conspiracy theories about COVID-19 and suggesting that the official figures had been manipulated, &quot;a deeply dangerous claim for which there is absolutely no evidence&quot;. Swayne said that &quot;we are getting very close to thought crime [...] that the deputy leader of the Labour Party is complaining about what another member of Parliament says and things as if this was some sort of criminal activity.&quot;

Swayne said that &quot;What really worries me is the grip the scientists still have on driving policy. The government needs to recognise that this is coming at a devastating cost. At some stage someone has to have a more realistic point of view.&quot;

In a 2021 interview with anti-vaccination filmmaker Del Bigtree, Swayne said that Britain had become &quot;a police state&quot; and accused the government of attempting to enact &quot;social control&quot;. When questioned about this by Sky News, Swayne stated that he had never heard of Bigtree. In January 2021, Swayne was criticised by the Board of Deputies of British Jews for his 2020 appearance on &quot;The Richie Allen Show&quot;, which has been accused of anti-Semitism.

In December 2021, Swayne was criticised for his arguments against compulsory vaccine passports, which included factually inaccurate comparisons between COVID deaths and those from flu and traffic accidents. Swayne questioned whether the health measures were proportionate, characterising the Health Protection Agency as a &quot;Ministry of Fear&quot; and saying that he felt his government had &quot;abandoned any principle of social democracy or liberal democracy&quot;.

==Personal life==
Swayne married Moira Cecily Teek in 1987. They have one son and two daughters. He is a Christian and a member of Christians in Parliament.

==Honours and decorations==
Swayne is a recipient of the Queen&#x27;s Golden Jubilee Medal, the Iraq Medal, and the Queen&#x27;s Diamond Jubilee Medal. He has also received the Territorial Decoration for 12 years&#x27; service in the Territorial Army. In June 2009, he was awarded the Volunteer Reserves Service Medal.

Swayne was knighted in the 2016 Birthday Honours for political and parliamentary service.

<text>Hugo George William Swire, Baron Swire, (born 30 November 1959) is a British politician. He served as the Member of Parliament (MP) for East Devon from 2001 until 2019. A member of the Conservative Party, he has had several ministerial roles, most recently as Minister of State for Europe and the Americas, a role he held until July 2016. Swire is currently the Deputy Chairman of the Commonwealth Enterprise and Investment Council. He retired from the House of Commons at the 2019 general election. Since 2022 he has been a member of the House of Lords.

==Early life and education==

Swire was born on 30 November 1959. His great-great-great-grandfather, John Swire (b. 1793), was the founder of the Liverpool textile trading business that later became the Swire Group, the multi-billion USD conglomerate based in Hong Kong. He is the brother of Sophia Swire.

Swire was privately educated at St. Aubyns School, a preparatory school in Rottingdean, East Sussex, and at Eton College. He studied at the University of St Andrews for a year before attending the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst.

==Career==
Swire served in the Grenadier Guards for three years, between 1980 and 1983, before working as a financial consultant. He became the first Head of Development for the National Gallery in 1988, before working at the auction house Sotheby&#x27;s from 1992, where he became a Director in 1996. He held this role when standing for election in 2001.

Swire was non-executive chairman of Photo-Me International prior to joining the Government.

==Member of Parliament==
He contested Greenock and Inverclyde in 1997, finishing fourth. In 2001 he won the seat of East Devon. Two years after his election to Parliament, Swire became an Opposition whip. In 2004, he was promoted to become Shadow Culture Minister. He joined the Shadow Cabinet on 8 December 2005, when new leader David Cameron appointed him Shadow Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport.
Swire was sacked in the July 2007 Conservative frontbench reshuffle for suggesting his party would scrap free museum entry. He returned to the backbenches, and amongst other roles became Hon. Secretary of the Conservative Middle East Council.

===Minister of State for Northern Ireland===
In May 2010 he was appointed Minister of State for Northern Ireland in the newly elected Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government headed by Prime Minister David Cameron.

===Minister of State for Europe and the Americas===
Swire was made Minister of State for Europe and the Americas on 4 September 2012. On 6 September 2013, he sent letters to the &quot;South China Morning Post&quot; and &quot;Ming Pao&quot;, commenting on the universal suffrage of Hong Kong SAR, emphasising the importance of democracy. Moreover, he added that he would provide any support towards the establishment of universal suffrage in Hong Kong.

In January 2015, Hong Kong&#x27;s leaders caused diplomatic outrage after declining to meet him to discuss political reform. Swire believed the Chinese government feared it would cause pro-democracy unrest, though the purpose of the visit was also to support trade. He resigned from his ministerial post on 15 July 2016, following the sacking of several other ministers who were considered to be close to David Cameron. He had tweeted: &quot;Not a good time to be a Cameroon. The tumbrils are rolling again!&quot;

Swire was made a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George in the 2016 Prime Minister&#x27;s Resignation Honours.

===Conservative Middle East Council===
Swire became Chairman of the Conservative Middle East Council (CMEC) in September 2016, having previously been a member of the group. In June 2016, he accepted a donation of £10,000 from the wife of a billionaire with links to the leadership of Saudi Arabia. The journalist Peter Oborne has criticised the direction of CMEC away from its earlier focus on Palestine, to greater interest on the Gulf States, including Saudi Arabia.

===Expenses===
Various aspects of Swire&#x27;s parliamentary expenses have generated adverse comments from critics. He was criticised for having the joint highest Additional Cost Allowance in the country in 2002/03, but argued that it was legal and that he had not financially benefited from the arrangement as he only rented the property in his constituency that the bulk of the costs related to. He was featured in articles on questionable expenses claims in &quot;The Telegraph&quot;, &quot;The Guardian&quot; and the BBC website in 2009, with attention made to his claims for a designer laptop case, an opera booklet and a satellite navigation system. Swire argued that the claims were sound and that he had not been asked to pay any of them back.

Although Parliament banned new MPs from employing family members from June 2017, Swire continued to employ his wife as his Senior Researcher/Parliamentary Assistant until his retirement. He stated in 2009 that family members could add value and that his wife has an &#x27;extraordinary knowledge of the constituency having worked for me&#x27;.

===Other===
Swire correctly predicted in November 2016 that Donald Trump would win the election for President of the United States of America.

Although a eurosceptic, Swire supported the official position of his party and campaigned for the United Kingdom to remain in the European Union before the EU membership referendum on 23 June 2016. After the result was announced, Swire continued to support the party leadership and advocated leaving the European Union.

==House of Lords==

It was announced on 14 October 2022, that as part of the 2022 Special Honours, Swire would be appointed a life peer. On 1 November 2022, he was created Baron Swire, &quot;of Down St Mary in the County of Devon&quot;.

==Personal life==
Swire married Alexandra (Sasha) Nott, the daughter of Sir John Nott (former Conservative Secretary of State for Defence, whose tenure included the Falklands War) in December 1996 in Kensington. The couple have two daughters (born May 1997 and August 2001). Julian Nott is one of Swire&#x27;s brothers-in-law. Swire is distantly related to Australian musician Rob Swire.

<text>Baron Petre (), of Writtle, in the County of Essex, is a title in the Peerage of England. It was created in 1603 for Sir John Petre. His family has since been associated with the county of Essex. He represented Essex in parliament and served as Lord Lieutenant of Essex. Lord Petre was the son of Sir William Petre, Secretary of State to Henry VIII, Mary I, Edward VI and Elizabeth I. Sir William acquired Ingatestone Hall and the surrounding manor from Henry for the full market value after it had been surrendered to the King by Barking Abbey during the Suppression of the Monasteries.

==History==

The first Baron was succeeded by his son, William Petre, 2nd Baron Petre. He sat as Member of Parliament for Essex. His grandson, William Petre, 4th Baron Petre, was one of the accused in the Titus Oates plot and died in the Tower of London in 1684. His younger brother, Thomas Petre, 6th Baron Petre, was Lord Lieutenant of Essex. His great-grandson, Robert Petre, 9th Baron Petre, who succeeded his father the year of his birth, married Anne Howard, daughter of Philip Howard, younger brother of Edward Howard, 9th Duke of Norfolk. On her uncle&#x27;s death in 1777 Anne became co-heiress to the baronies of Howard, Furnivall, Strange of Blackmere, Talbot, Braose of Gower, Dacre of Gillesland, Greystock, Ferrers of Wemme, Giffard of Brimsfield and Verdon.

Their great-great-grandson, Bernard Petre, 14th Baron Petre, married Etheldreda, daughter of William Robinson Clark. In 1913 (five years after the death of Lord Petre) the abeyance of the ancient barony of Furnivall was terminated by the King in favour of their daughter Mary Frances Katherine Petre, who became the nineteenth Baroness Furnivall (see the Baron Furnivall for more information). Petre was succeeded by his younger brother, Philip Petre, 15th Baron Petre. the title is held by the latter&#x27;s great-grandson, John Petre, 18th Baron Petre, who succeeded his father in 1989. Lord Petre has been Lord Lieutenant of Essex since 2002.

Another member of the Petre family was Father Sir Edward Petre, 3rd Baronet, the unpopular chaplain and advisor to James II. James made him Clerk of the Closet and asked the Pope to make him a bishop and later a Cardinal but was refused both requests.

The Petre family have been staunchly loyal to Roman Catholicism. It was the first Baron who publicly acknowledged his Catholicism. At least twelve members of the family have been Jesuits. The family has also produced two bishops, Francis (1692–1775) and Benjamin (1672–1758). These two were coadjutor bishops of, respectively, Bishop Dicconson and Bishop Challoner.

The feudal Lordship of Writtle had for centuries been the possession of the de Brus family and early chroniclers give the manor there as the birthplace of Robert the Bruce.

==Properties==
The family seats are Ingatestone Hall (principal), at Ingatestone, Essex, and Writtle Park, Essex. The family-owned Thorndon Hall, near Brentwood, is set in an extensive deer park. Formerly called &quot;Thorndon &quot;Old&quot; Hall&quot;, it burned down in the early 18th century; after which &quot;New&quot; Thorndon Hall was built about a mile north, in Ingrave. This too suffered from a fire in the 1880s and has since been rebuilt as flats within the repaired walls, and the family mortuary chapel nearby is now owned by Historic Chapels Trust. Thorndon Park is mostly now run by Essex County Council as a Country Park with the Petre family retaining limited ownerships.

<doc id="450520" wikidata="Q306250" url="?curid=450520" title="Robert Syms">
<text>Sir Robert Andrew Raymond Syms (born 15 August 1956) is a Conservative Party politician who was the Member of Parliament (MP) for Poole from 1997 to 2024. He received a knighthood in 2017.

==Early life and career ==
Robert Syms was born on 15 August 1956 in Chippenham, Wiltshire, and went to Collegiate School, a private school in Bristol. 

He was leader of North Wiltshire District Council from 1984 to 1987 and a Wiltshire County Councillor from 1985 to 1997. 

Syms has also been managing director of his family&#x27;s plant hire firm on Bristol Road in Chippenham, and is a Fellow of the Chartered Institute of Building. He retains a directorship and shareholding in Marden Holdings Ltd, headquartered in Bristol Road, Chippenham.

==Parliamentary career==
At the 1992 general election, Syms stood as the Conservative candidate in Walsall North, coming second with 39.4% of the vote behind the incumbent Labour MP David Winnick.

Syms was elected to Parliament as MP for Poole at the 1997 general election with 42.1% of the vote and a majority of 5,298. At the 2001 general election, Syms was re-elected as MP for Poole with an increased vote share of 45.1% and an increased majority of 7,166. He was again re-elected at the 2005 general election, with a decreased vote share of 43.4% and a decreased majority of 5,988.

In May 2009, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; reported that Syms had claimed more than £2,000 of furniture for his designated second home in London which was delivered to his parents&#x27; address in Wiltshire. Syms denied any wrongdoing, telling the &quot;Bournemouth Echo&quot;: &quot;It was purely a matter of convenience from my point of view&quot;. Syms said the furniture was only delivered and assembled at his parents&#x27; home, then later transported to his London address.

At the 2010 general election, Syms was again re-elected, with an increased vote share of 47.5% and an increased majority of 7,541.

Syms was an assistant whip for the Coalition government between 2012 and 2013. He has served on a variety of select committees, acting as chair of the Regulatory Reform Committee from July 2010 to September 2012 and the High Speed Rail select committee from April 2014 to February 2016.

At the 2015 general election, Syms was again re-elected with an increased vote share of 50.1% and an increased majority of 15,789.

Syms organised a letter signed by more than 80 fellow Eurosceptic Conservative MPs urging David Cameron to continue as Prime Minister regardless of the result of the EU referendum in 2016. He backed Theresa May&#x27;s leadership bid following Cameron&#x27;s resignation, and was appointed as a Government Whip and Lord Commissioner of HM Treasury upon May&#x27;s succession.

At the snap 2017 general election, Syms was again re-elected, with an increased vote share of 57.9% and a decreased majority of 14,209.

In June 2017, Syms was criticised for using aggressive and unprofessional language on Twitter. He replied to a tweet calling the Conservative-DUP deal after the 2017 general election a &quot;coalition&quot; by calling the twitter user a &quot;dick&quot;.

At the 2019 general election, Syms was again re-elected, with an increased vote share of 58.7% and an increased majority of 19,116.

In 2020, Syms became a &quot;lockdown rebel&quot; and a steering committee member of the lockdown-sceptic COVID Recovery Group alongside a group of Conservative MPs who opposed the UK government&#x27;s December 2020 lockdown. They have been seen as an &quot;echo&quot; of the Brexiteer European Research Group (ERG) of MPs, and a response by backbench Conservatives to Nigel Farage&#x27;s anti-lockdown Reform UK party.

At the 2024 general election, Syms lost his seat to Labour&#x27;s Neil Duncan-Jordan by a margin of 18 votes. Syms&#x27;s vote share was reduced to 31.8%. This was after multiple recounts.

==Personal life==
He is divorced and has two teenage children. Syms was appointed Knight Bachelor in October 2017.

<doc id="450525" wikidata="Q915079" url="?curid=450525" title="Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm">
<text>In cryptography, the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) offers a variant of the Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA) which uses elliptic-curve cryptography.

==Key and signature sizes==
As with elliptic-curve cryptography in general, the bit size of the private key believed to be needed for ECDSA is about twice the size of the security level, in bits. For example, at a security level of 80 bits—meaning an attacker requires a maximum of about formula_1 operations to find the private key—the size of an ECDSA private key would be 160 bits. On the other hand, the signature size is the same for both DSA and ECDSA: approximately formula_2 bits, where formula_3 is the exponent in the formula formula_4, that is, about 320 bits for a security level of 80 bits, which is equivalent to formula_1 operations.

==Signature generation algorithm==
Suppose Alice wants to send a signed message to Bob. Initially, they must agree on the curve parameters formula_6. In addition to the field and equation of the curve, we need formula_7, a base point of prime order on the curve; formula_8 is the multiplicative order of the point formula_7.

The order formula_8 of the base point formula_7 must be prime. Indeed, we assume that every nonzero element of the ring formula_12 is invertible, so that formula_12 must be a field. It implies that formula_8 must be prime (cf. Bézout&#x27;s identity).

Alice creates a key pair, consisting of a private key integer formula_15, randomly selected in the interval formula_16; and a public key curve point formula_17. We use formula_18 to denote elliptic curve point multiplication by a scalar.

For Alice to sign a message formula_19, she follows these steps:

# Calculate formula_20. (Here HASH is a cryptographic hash function, such as SHA-2, with the output converted to an integer.)
# Let formula_21 be the formula_22 leftmost bits of formula_23, where formula_22 is the bit length of the group order formula_8. (Note that formula_21 can be &quot;greater&quot; than formula_8 but not &quot;longer&quot;.)
# Select a cryptographically secure random integer formula_28 from formula_16.
# Calculate the curve point formula_30.
# Calculate formula_31. If formula_32, go back to step 3.
# Calculate formula_33. If formula_34, go back to step 3.
# The signature is the pair formula_35. (And formula_36 is also a valid signature.)

As the standard notes, it is not only required for formula_28 to be secret, but it is also crucial to select different formula_28 for different signatures. Otherwise, the equation in step 6 can be solved for formula_15, the private key: given two signatures formula_35 and formula_41, employing the same unknown formula_28 for different known messages formula_19 and formula_44, an attacker can calculate formula_21 and formula_46, and since formula_47 (all operations in this paragraph are done modulo formula_8) the attacker can find formula_49. Since formula_50, the attacker can now calculate the private key formula_51. 

This implementation failure was used, for example, to extract the signing key used for the PlayStation 3 gaming-console. 

Another way ECDSA signature may leak private keys is when formula_28 is generated by a faulty random number generator. Such a failure in random number generation caused users of Android Bitcoin Wallet to lose their funds in August 2013. 

To ensure that formula_28 is unique for each message, one may bypass random number generation completely and generate deterministic signatures by deriving formula_28 from both the message and the private key.

==Signature verification algorithm==
For Bob to authenticate Alice&#x27;s signature formula_55 on a message formula_19, he must have a copy of her public-key curve point formula_57. Bob can verify formula_57 is a valid curve point as follows:

# Check that formula_57 is not equal to the identity element , and its coordinates are otherwise valid.
# Check that formula_57 lies on the curve.
# Check that formula_61.

After that, Bob follows these steps:

# Verify that and are integers in formula_16. If not, the signature is invalid.
# Calculate formula_20, where HASH is the same function used in the signature generation. 
# Let formula_21 be the formula_22 leftmost bits of .
# Calculate formula_66 and formula_67.
# Calculate the curve point formula_68. If formula_69 then the signature is invalid.
# The signature is valid if formula_70, invalid otherwise.

Note that an efficient implementation would compute inverse formula_71 only once. Also, using Shamir&#x27;s trick, a sum of two scalar multiplications formula_72 can be calculated faster than two scalar multiplications done independently.

===Correctness of the algorithm===
It is not immediately obvious why verification even functions correctly. To see why, denote as the curve point computed in step 5 of verification,

: formula_73

From the definition of the public key as formula_17,

: formula_75

Because elliptic curve scalar multiplication distributes over addition,

: formula_76

Expanding the definition of formula_77 and formula_78 from verification step 4,

: formula_79

Collecting the common term formula_80,

: formula_81

Expanding the definition of from signature step 6,

: formula_82

Since the inverse of an inverse is the original element, and the product of an element&#x27;s inverse and the element is the identity, we are left with

: formula_83

From the definition of , this is verification step 6.

This shows only that a correctly signed message will verify correctly; other properties such as incorrectly signed messages failing to verify correctly and resistance to cryptanalytic attacks are required for a secure signature algorithm.

==Public key recovery==
Given a message and Alice&#x27;s signature formula_55 on that message, Bob can (potentially) recover Alice&#x27;s public key:

# Verify that and are integers in formula_16. If not, the signature is invalid.
# Calculate a curve point formula_86 where formula_87 is one of formula_88, formula_89, formula_90, etc. (provided formula_87 is not too large for the field of the curve) and formula_92 is a value such that the curve equation is satisfied. Note that there may be several curve points satisfying these conditions, and each different value results in a distinct recovered key.
# Calculate formula_20, where HASH is the same function used in the signature generation. 
# Let be the formula_22 leftmost bits of .
# Calculate formula_95 and formula_96.
# Calculate the curve point formula_97.
# The signature is valid if formula_57, matches Alice&#x27;s public key.
# The signature is invalid if all the possible points have been tried and none match Alice&#x27;s public key.

Note that an invalid signature, or a signature from a different message, will result in the recovery of an incorrect public key. The recovery algorithm can only be used to check validity of a signature if the signer&#x27;s public key (or its hash) is known beforehand.

===Correctness of the recovery algorithm===
Start with the definition of formula_57 from recovery step 6,

: formula_97

From the definition formula_101 from signing step 4,

: formula_102

Because elliptic curve scalar multiplication distributes over addition,

: formula_103

Expanding the definition of formula_77 and formula_78 from recovery step 5,

: formula_106

Expanding the definition of from signature step 6,

: formula_107

Since the product of an element&#x27;s inverse and the element is the identity, we are left with

: formula_108

The first and second terms cancel each other out,

: formula_17

From the definition of formula_17, this is Alice&#x27;s public key.

This shows that a correctly signed message will recover the correct public key, provided additional information was shared to uniquely calculate curve point formula_86 from signature value .

==Security==
In December 2010, a group calling itself &quot;fail0verflow&quot; announced the recovery of the ECDSA private key used by Sony to sign software for the PlayStation 3 game console. However, this attack only worked because Sony did not properly implement the algorithm, because formula_28 was static instead of random. As pointed out in the Signature generation algorithm section above, this makes formula_15 solvable, rendering the entire algorithm useless.

On March 29, 2011, two researchers published an IACR paper demonstrating that it is possible to retrieve a TLS private key of a server using OpenSSL that authenticates with Elliptic Curves DSA over a binary field via a timing attack. The vulnerability was fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.0e.

In August 2013, it was revealed that bugs in some implementations of the Java class SecureRandom sometimes generated collisions in the formula_28 value. This allowed hackers to recover private keys giving them the same control over bitcoin transactions as legitimate keys&#x27; owners had, using the same exploit that was used to reveal the PS3 signing key on some Android app implementations, which use Java and rely on ECDSA to authenticate transactions.

This issue can be prevented by deterministic generation of k, as described by RFC 6979.

=== Concerns ===
Some concerns expressed about ECDSA:

# &quot;Political concerns&quot;: the trustworthiness of NIST-produced curves being questioned after revelations were made that the NSA willingly inserts backdoors into software, hardware components and published standards; well-known cryptographers have expressed doubts about how the NIST curves were designed, and voluntary tainting has already been proved in the past. (See also the &quot;libssh curve25519 introduction&quot;.) Nevertheless, a proof that the named NIST curves exploit a rare weakness is missing yet.
# &quot;Technical concerns&quot;: the difficulty of properly implementing the standard, its slowness, and design flaws which reduce security in insufficiently defensive implementations.

<doc id="450526" wikidata="Q193541" url="?curid=450526" title="French New Wave">
<text>The New Wave (, ), also called the French New Wave, is a French art film movement that emerged in the late 1950s. The movement was characterized by its rejection of traditional filmmaking conventions in favor of experimentation and a spirit of iconoclasm. New Wave filmmakers explored new approaches to editing, visual style, and narrative, as well as engagement with the social and political upheavals of the era, often making use of irony or exploring existential themes. The New Wave is often considered one of the most influential movements in the history of cinema.

The term was first used by a group of French film critics and cinephiles associated with the magazine in the late 1950s and 1960s. These critics rejected the (&quot;Tradition of Quality&quot;) of mainstream French cinema, which emphasized craft over innovation and old works over experimentation. This was apparent in a manifesto-like 1954 essay by François Truffaut, &quot;&quot;, where he denounced the adaptation of safe literary works into unimaginative films. Along with Truffaut, a number of writers for became leading New Wave filmmakers, including Jean-Luc Godard, Éric Rohmer, Jacques Rivette, and Claude Chabrol. The associated Left Bank film community included directors such as Alain Resnais, Agnès Varda, Jacques Demy and Chris Marker.

Using portable equipment and requiring little or no set up time, the New Wave way of filmmaking often presented a documentary style. The films exhibited direct sounds on film stock that required less light. Filming techniques included fragmented, discontinuous editing, and long takes. The combination of realism, subjectivity, and authorial commentary created a narrative ambiguity in the sense that questions that arise in a film are not answered in the end.

Although naturally associated with Francophone countries, the movement has had a continual influence within various other cinephile cultures over the past several decades inside of many other nations. The United Kingdom and the United States, both of them being primarily English-speaking, are of note. &quot;Kitchen sink realism&quot; as an artistic approach intellectually challenging social conventions and traditions in the U.K. is an example, as are some elements of the &quot;new sincerity&quot; subculture within the U.S. that involve deliberately defying certain critical expectations in filmmaking.

== Origins of the movement ==

Alexandre Astruc&#x27;s manifesto &quot;The Birth of a New Avant-Garde: The Camera-Stylo&quot;, published in &quot;L&#x27;Écran&quot; on 30 March 1948, outlined some of the ideas that were later expanded upon by François Truffaut and the . It argues that &quot;cinema was in the process of becoming a new means of expression on the same level as painting and the novel ... a form in which and by which an artist can express his thoughts, however abstract they may be, or translate his obsessions exactly as he does in the contemporary essay or novel. This is why I would like to call this new age of cinema the age of the &quot;caméra-stylo.&quot;&quot;

Some of the most prominent pioneers among the group, including François Truffaut, Jean-Luc Godard, Éric Rohmer, Claude Chabrol, and Jacques Rivette, began as critics for the famous film magazine . &quot;Cahiers&quot; co-founder and theorist André Bazin was a prominent source of influence for the movement. By means of criticism and editorialization, they laid the groundwork for a set of concepts, revolutionary at the time, which the American film critic Andrew Sarris called &quot;auteur theory&quot;. (The original French &quot;&quot;, translated literally as &quot;The policy of authors&quot;.) Bazin and Henri Langlois, founder and curator of the , were the dual father figures of the movement. These men of cinema valued the expression of the director&#x27;s personal vision in both the film&#x27;s style and script.

Truffaut also credits the American film &quot;Little Fugitive&quot; (1953) by Ruth Orkin, Ray Ashley and Morris Engel with helping to start the French New Wave, when he said: &quot;Our New Wave would never have come into being, if it hadn&#x27;t been for the young American Morris Engel who showed us the way to independent production with [this] fine movie.&quot;

The auteur theory holds that the director is the &quot;author&quot; of their movies, with a personal signature visible from film to film. They praised movies by Jean Renoir and Jean Vigo, and made then-radical cases for the artistic distinction and greatness of Hollywood studio directors such as Orson Welles, John Ford, Alfred Hitchcock and Nicholas Ray. The beginning of the New Wave was to some extent an exercise by the &quot;Cahiers&quot; writers in applying this philosophy to the world by directing movies themselves.

Apart from the role that films by Jean Rouch have played in the movement, Chabrol&#x27;s &quot;Le Beau Serge&quot; (1958) is traditionally (but debatably) credited as the first New Wave feature. Agnès Varda&#x27;s &quot;La Pointe Courte&quot; (1955) was chronologically the first, but did not have a commercial release until 2008. Truffaut, with &quot;The 400 Blows&quot; (1959), and Godard, with &quot;Breathless&quot; (1960) had unexpected international successes, both critical and financial, that turned the world&#x27;s attention to the activities of the New Wave and enabled the movement to flourish. Part of their technique was to portray characters not readily labeled as protagonists in the classic sense of audience identification.

The auteurs of this era owe their popularity to the support they received from their youthful audience. Most of these directors were born in the 1930s and grew up in Paris, relating to how their viewers might be experiencing life. With a high concentration on fashion, urban professional life, and all-night parties, the life of France&#x27;s youth was exquisitely captured.

The French New Wave was popular roughly between 1958 and 1962. The socio-economic forces at play shortly after World War II strongly influenced the movement. Politically and financially drained, France tended to fall back on the old popular pre-war traditions. One such tradition was straight narrative cinema, specifically classical French film. The movement has its roots in rebellion against the reliance on past forms (often adapted from traditional novelistic structures), criticizing, in particular, the way these forms could force the audience to submit to a dictatorial plot-line. They were especially against the French &quot;cinema of quality&quot;, the type of high-minded, literary period films held in esteem at French film festivals, often regarded as &quot;untouchable&quot; by criticism.

New Wave critics and directors studied the work of Western classics and applied new avant-garde stylistic direction. The low-budget approach helped filmmakers get at the essential art form and find what was, to them, a much more comfortable and contemporary form of production. Charlie Chaplin, Alfred Hitchcock, Orson Welles, Howard Hawks, John Ford, Sam Fuller and Don Siegel were held up in admiration. French New Wave is influenced by Italian Neorealism and classical Hollywood cinema.

In a 1961 interview, Truffaut said that &quot;the &#x27;New Wave&#x27; is neither a movement, nor a school, nor a group, it&#x27;s a &quot;quality&quot; and in December 1962 published a list of 162 film directors who had made their feature film debut since 1959. Many of these directors, such as Edmond Agabra and Henri Zaphiratos, were not as successful or enduring as the well-known members of the New Wave and today would not be considered part of it. Shortly after Truffaut&#x27;s published list appeared, Godard publicly declared that the New Wave was more exclusive and included only Truffaut, Chabrol, Rivette, Rohmer, and himself, stating that &quot;Cahiers&quot; was the nucleus&quot; of the movement. Godard also acknowledged filmmakers such as Resnais, Astruc, Varda, and Demy as esteemed contemporaries, but said that they represented &quot;their own fund of culture&quot; and were separate from the New Wave.

Many of the directors associated with the New Wave continued to make films into the 21st century.

== Film techniques==

The movies featured unprecedented methods of expression, such as long tracking shots (like the famous traffic jam sequence in Godard&#x27;s 1967 film &quot;Weekend&quot;). Also, these movies featured existential themes, often stressing the individual and the acceptance of the absurdity of human existence. Filled with irony and sarcasm, the films also tend to reference other films. 

Many of the French New Wave films were produced on tight budgets, often shot in a friend&#x27;s apartment or yard, using the director&#x27;s friends as the cast and crew. Directors were also forced to improvise with equipment (for example, using a shopping cart for tracking shots.) The cost of film was also a major concern; thus, efforts to save film turned into stylistic innovations. For example, in Jean-Luc Godard&#x27;s &quot;Breathless&quot; (&quot;&quot;), after being told the film was too long and he must cut it down to one hour and a half he decided (on the suggestion of Jean-Pierre Melville) to remove several scenes from the feature using jump cuts, as they were filmed in one long take. Parts that did not work were simply cut from the middle of the take, a practical decision, and also a purposeful stylistic one.

The cinematic stylings of the French New Wave brought a fresh look to the cinema with improvised dialogue, rapid changes of scene, and shots that broke the common 180° axis of camera movement. In many films of the French New Wave, the camera was used not to mesmerize the audience with elaborate narrative and illusory images, but rather to play with audience expectations. Godard was arguably the movement&#x27;s most influential figure; his method of filmmaking, often used to shock and awe audiences out of passivity, was abnormally bold and direct.

Godard&#x27;s stylistic approach can be seen as a desperate struggle against the mainstream cinema of the time, or a degrading attack on the viewer&#x27;s supposed naivety. Either way, the challenging awareness represented by this movement remains in cinema today. Effects that now seem either trite or commonplace, such as a character stepping out of their role in order to address the audience directly, were radically innovative at the time.

Classic French cinema adhered to the principles of strong narrative, creating what Godard described as an oppressive and deterministic aesthetic of plot. In contrast, New Wave filmmakers made no attempts to suspend the viewer&#x27;s disbelief; in fact, they took steps to constantly remind the viewer that a film is just a sequence of moving images, no matter how clever the use of light and shadow. The result is a set of oddly disjointed scenes without an attempt at unity; or an actor whose character changes from one scene to the next; or sets in which onlookers accidentally make their way onto camera along with extras, who in fact were hired to do just the same.

At the heart of New Wave technique is the issue of money and production value. In the context of social and economic troubles of a post-World War II France, filmmakers sought low-budget alternatives to the usual production methods, and were inspired by the generation of Italian Neorealists before them. Half necessity and half vision, New Wave directors used all that they had available to channel their artistic visions directly to the theatre.

Finally, the French New Wave, as the European modern Cinema, is focused on the technique as style itself. A French New Wave film-maker is first of all an author who shows in its film their own eye on the world. On the other hand, the film as the object of knowledge challenges the usual transitivity on which all the other cinema was based, &quot;undoing its cornerstones: space and time continuity, narrative and grammatical logics, the self-evidence of the represented worlds.&quot; In this way the film-maker passes &quot;the essay attitude, thinking – in a novelist way – on his own way to do essays.&quot;

== Left Bank ==

The corresponding &quot;right bank&quot; group is constituted of the more famous and financially successful New Wave directors associated with (Claude Chabrol, François Truffaut, and Jean-Luc Godard). Unlike the &quot;Cahiers&quot; group, Left Bank directors were older and less movie-crazed. They tended to see cinema akin to other arts, such as literature. However, they were similar to the New Wave directors in that they practiced cinematic modernism. Their emergence also came in the 1950s and they also benefited from the youthful audience. The two groups, however, were not in opposition; advocated for Left Bank cinema.

Left Bank directors include Chris Marker, Alain Resnais, and Agnès Varda (Varda&#x27;s husband, Jacques Demy, is sometimes grouped with the Left Bank filmmakers). Roud described a distinctive &quot;fondness for a kind of Bohemian life and an impatience with the conformity of the Right Bank, a high degree of involvement in literature and the plastic arts, and a consequent interest in experimental filmmaking&quot;, as well as an identification with the political left. The filmmakers tended to collaborate with one another. Jean-Pierre Melville, Alain Robbe-Grillet, and Marguerite Duras are also associated with the group. The nouveau roman movement in literature was also a strong element of the Left Bank style, with authors contributing to many of the films.

Left Bank films include &quot;La Pointe Courte&quot;, &quot;Hiroshima mon amour&quot;, &quot;La jetée&quot;, &quot;Last Year at Marienbad&quot;, and &quot;Trans-Europ-Express&quot;.

<doc id="450528" wikidata="Q5189910" url="?curid=450528" title="Cruelty-free">
<text>In the animal rights movement, cruelty-free is a label for products or activities that do not harm or kill animals anywhere in the world. Products tested on animals or made from animals are not considered cruelty-free, since these tests are often painful and cause the suffering and death of millions of animals every year.

== History ==

The term cruelty-free was first used in this way by Lady Dowding who persuaded manufacturers of fake furs to use the label &quot;Beauty Without Cruelty&quot; and went on to found the charity Beauty Without Cruelty in 1959. The term was popularised in the US in the 1970s by Marcia Pearson who founded the group Fashion With Compassion. Then, in 1998, the United Kingdom started a trend by banning all testing on animals. Many other countries followed their lead soon after.

== Campaigns ==
In 1957 Charles Hume and W. M. S. Russell introduced the concept of the three R&#x27;s in their book &quot;Principles of Humane Experimental Technique&quot;. These techniques to reduce animals used in tests and their suffering include: replacement (eliminate an animal test altogether), reduction (fewer animals used in test by using statistical analysis) and refinement (making tests less painful).

In 1991 the European Center for the Validation of Alternative Methods (ECVAM) was established &quot;to promote the scientific and regulatory acceptance of alternative methods which are important to the biosciences and which reduce, refine or replace the use of laboratory animals.&quot; Once the ECVAM&#x27;s Scientific Advisory Committee approves a test it must be used under the Animal Protection Act, which does not allow the use of animals when an alternative exists.

In 2012, British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection joined forces with New England Anti-Vivisection Society and the European Coalition to End Animal Experiments to create an international organization to campaign against animal testing. BUAV supporter Ricky Gervais announced the campaign—now considered a deciding factor in the European decision to ban animal testing for personal-care products. Although companies can still use animal testing in countries outside Europe, such as China, which requires animal testing on all imported cosmetics - Note that China now has new legislation in place under CSAR which details methods to enter the Chinese cosmetic market without the need for animal testing. The Leaping Bunny applies to a company&#x27;s global market, and does not certify product that use animal testing anywhere in the world.

== Tests ==

Animals such as rabbits, rats, mice, and guinea pigs are sometimes forced to eat or inhale substances, or have a cosmetic ingredient rubbed onto their shaved skin, eyes or ears every day for 28 or 90 days to see if they have an allergic reaction. Then they are killed and cut open to examine the effects the ingredient has on internal organs. These tests are also done with pregnant animals who, after much suffering, are killed along with the fetus. In more prolonged carcinogen tests, rats are force-fed a cosmetic ingredient over two years, monitored for cancer, and then killed.
Primates, dogs, such as the Beagle, and cats are used for invasive experimentation as well. Many laboratories use these species to test drugs, chemicals, and diseases, whether old or new.

== Alternatives ==
As technology developed, outdated animal testing is being replaced with quicker, cheaper and more accurate methods. Critics point out that humane alternatives can be slow to implement, costly, and test only one compound at a time. Alternatives have shown positive results. For example, &quot;reconstructed human epidermis&quot;—which uses human skin donated from cosmetic surgery to replace the rabbit Draize skin test—is more relevant to human reactions. Other methods replace the Draize eye test by using in vitro (test-tube) human tissue. Computer-based systems allow for isolation of a select tissue or organ to conduct tests in an extremely controlled environment. These tests not only reduce animal testing, but are more precise and accurate at protecting humans from toxic substances. Another cruelty-free option is using ingredients that have already been established as safe, such as the 20,000 ingredients in the European Union database.

== Products ==
Companies now offer a wide range of cruelty-free products such as cosmetics, personal-care products, household cleaners, clothing, shoes, condoms (which are sometimes processed with casein), and candles (which usually use paraffin or beeswax). Organizations such as PETA, Choose Cruelty Free, Coalition for Consumer Information on Cosmetics, British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection, and its offshoot organization Cruelty Free International have released lists of cruelty-free products and cruel products to boycott. Since the 1990s the Leaping Bunny has been the only international third-party cruelty-free certification program.

It is important to distinguish between cruelty free and vegan products because while it is common for people to use these two terms interchangeably, there are several key differences. Products that are vegan may not necessarily be cruelty free and vice versa. The cruelty free label only guarantees that the final product and ingredients are not tested on animals, but the product can still contain animal derived ingredients. Similarly, the vegan label only guarantees that the product does not contain animal ingredients but may still have been tested on animals.

==Events==
&quot;National Cruelty-Free Week&quot; is an event in the United Kingdom every year arranged by the BUAV. The 2006 event was from 17 to 23 July. Other, similar, events include: &quot;National Vegetarian Week&quot;, &quot;UK Vegan Week&quot; and &quot;World Vegan Day&quot;, which takes place each year on November 1.

== Criticisms ==

While some manufacturers have begun to label their products as &quot;not tested on animals&quot;, &quot;we do not conduct animal testing&quot;, &quot;never tested on animals&quot;, &quot;against animal testing&quot; or &quot;cruelty-free&quot;, these labels are confusing and potentially misleading, since there is no clear legal definition as to what they mean. Two organizations, Cruelty Free International and People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, use rabbit icons to verify products as &quot;cruelty-free&quot;, resulting in some manufacturers using rabbit icons to intentionally deceive customers into believing that their products do not use animal testing. The symbol of a rabbit is commonly understood by consumers as verifying a product as &quot;cruelty-free&quot;, but most consumers cannot easily distinguish the CFI and PETA rabbit logos from other rabbit icons.

<text>Helsinki Committees for Human Rights exist in many European countries (and in the wider OSCE region) as volunteer, non-profit organizations devoted to the protection of human rights. It was presumably named after the Helsinki Accords. It was formerly organized into the International Helsinki Federation for Human Rights (IHF), based in Vienna.

==History==
The Helsinki Committees began as Helsinki Watch groups. The first one was founded in Moscow in May 1976, the second in Kyiv in November 1976, the third in November 1976 in Lithuania, then in 1977 in Czechoslovakia, Georgia and Armenia, the last in 1979 in Poland.
In 1982, representatives of several of these committees held an International Citizens Helsinki Watch Conference and founded the IHF.

In 1992, a British Helsinki Human Rights Group was established in the UK, but this group was always completely independent of the International Helsinki Federation for Human Rights. The UK&#x27;s official representative in the IHF is the British Helsinki Subcommittee of the Parliamentary Human Rights Group, established in 1976.

<text>The House of Kinsky (formerly Vchynští, sg. &quot;Vchynský&quot; in Czech; later (in modern Czech) Kinští, sg. &quot;Kinský&quot;; ) is a prominent Bohemian noble family originating in the Kingdom of Bohemia. During the Thirty Years&#x27; War, the Kinsky family rose from minor nobles to comital rank (1628) and later princely status (1747) under the rule of the Habsburgs. The family, recorded in the &quot;Almanach de Gotha&quot;, is considered to have been one of the most illustrious of Austria-Hungary.

==History==
According to romantic medieval legend, the Kinsky story began in Bohemia over 1,000 years ago, when a king&#x27;s beautiful daughter went out hunting in the forest and was attacked by a pack of wolves. Her attendants all fled the terrible scene except for one young man, who saved the princess by killing some wolves and driving the rest away. In gratitude, the girl&#x27;s father ennobled the young man, granting him a coat of arms featuring three wolves&#x27; teeth as an emblem of his bravery.

===Rise===
The first factual mention of an ancestor of this clan dates back to 1237, during the reign of the Přemyslid king Wenceslaus I of Bohemia. Over the next three centuries they were only minor nobles with estates in northwestern Bohemia, around the village of Vchynice () near Litoměřice. Holding of Vchynice manor was confirmed by the Habsburg emperor Rudolf II in 1596 and in 1611 one of the family&#x27;s members, Radslav Vchynský of Vchynice the Elder, ennobled as lord (), became a member of the Diet of Bohemia (&quot;zemský sněm&quot;).

The rise of the family to prominence began in the turbulent era of religious conflicts between Catholics and Protestants which finally led to the cataclysm for Bohemia in the Thirty Years&#x27; War: Radslav&#x27;s nephew, the royal official Vilém Kinský, took part in the Protestant revolt against Emperor Ferdinand II, which culminated in the 1618 Defenestration of Prague. Vilém was among the nobles who, without success, offered the Bohemian crown to the Wettin elector John George I of Saxony. After the loss of Czech independence in 1620 (Battle of White Mountain), when the majority of local Protestant aristocracy was banished and their possessions expropriated in favour of nobility faithful to the Catholic House of Habsburg, he retained his possessions and was even elevated to the rank of a Count (&quot;Graf&quot;) in 1628. Through his marriage with Alžběta (Elisabeth) Trčka of Lípa, he was a brother-in-law of the Imperial generalissimo Albrecht von Wallenstein, with whom he was assassinated at Cheb in 1634.

A branch of the family was elevated to Princes of the Holy Roman Empire by Empress Maria Theresa in 1747. Many members of the family served in high diplomatic or military positions in the Habsburg monarchy and subsequently in the Austrian Empire.

===Confiscation and restoration===
After World War II, estates of the princely (Choceň) branch of the family were confiscated under the Decree of the President of Republic, as the late Prince Ulrich (1893–1938) was reproached for his declared German nationality and active collaboration with the Sudeten German Party. Estates of the other branches, Kostelec and Chlumec, which had been confiscated by the Nazis during the German occupation, were returned after 1945 but confiscated again, this time by the ruling Communist Party in 1948. After the Velvet Revolution and the fall of Communism, several possessions – for example, Karlova Koruna Chateau and Kost Castle – were returned to the family.

From 2003, the senior member of the princely branch, Prince Ulrich&#x27;s son Franz Ulrich, sued the Czech Republic for return of the properties confiscated in 1945 only because, he maintained, the confiscation implicitly labeled his family as historical traitors against Czechoslovakia and as willful collaborators during the Nazi occupation. The Kinsky family has denied such charges, arguing that Prince Franz Ulrich was just two years old at the time of his father&#x27;s death and that he and his mother, Princess Kinsky (&quot;née&quot; Baroness Mathilde von dem Bussche-Haddenhausen — whose family reputedly plotted against Hitler), had left the occupied country and went into exile in Argentina shortly afterwards.

According to a 2005 judgement by the Constitutional Court of the Czech Republic, at least the expropriations enacted before the Communist coup d&#x27;état (1948) are valid. Prince Franz Ulrich died in 2009 in Buenos Aires after a brief illness and was survived by his widow, &quot;née&quot; Countess Lena Hutten-Czapska. He left as heir to his title, properties and pending claims against the Czech state, his son Karl (&quot;Charlie&quot;) and three grandchildren.

==Residences==
Like many of the aristocratic families of the Habsburg monarchy, the Kinskys were great landowners and patrons of the arts. They employed (between 1713 and 1716) the celebrated architect Johann Lukas von Hildebrandt to build their residence Palais Kinsky in Vienna, which remained in the family&#x27;s ownership until 1987. In addition to this home, from the 18th century the family also owned the vast baroque Kinsky Palace in Old Town Square, Prague. Another family home was Choceň Chateau, a medieval Bohemian fortress rebuilt in the neo-Gothic style in the 19th century. All of these homes were filled with priceless treasures and artifacts. The family lost most of its property in 1945 by confiscation in Czechoslovakia, but after 1990, Karlova Koruna Chateau and Kost Castle were restituted to the family. The Kinskys also own Burg Heidenreichstein in Lower Austria, which they inherited.
==Support of Beethoven==
As a patron of the arts, along with Archduke Rudolf and Prince Joseph Lobkowitz, Ferdinand Kinsky contributed 1800 fl. to a yearly salary of 4000 florin for Ludwig van Beethoven. Ferdinand arranged his share to be paid on as a pension until Beethoven died in March 1827.

==Stud farms==
In 1723, Emperor Charles VI ordered the Kinsky family to develop their stud farms and breed horses of such quality as to provide superior mounts for the officers of the elite cavalry regiments of the empire. In 1776, the quality of the Kinsky horses was further improved by bloodstock from England.

In 1838, Count Oktavian Kinsky expanded still further the Kinsky studs, famous throughout Europe for their high equine quality, known as the Kinsky horse.

<text>In cryptography, a Schnorr signature is a digital signature produced by the Schnorr signature algorithm that was described by Claus Schnorr. It is a digital signature scheme known for its simplicity, among the first whose security is based on the intractability of certain discrete logarithm problems. It is efficient and generates short signatures. It was covered by which expired in February 2010.

==Algorithm==

===Choosing parameters===
*All users of the signature scheme agree on a group formula_1 of prime order formula_2 with generator formula_3 in which the discrete log problem is assumed to be hard. Typically a Schnorr group is used.
*All users agree on a cryptographic hash function formula_4.

===Notation===
In the following,
*Exponentiation stands for repeated application of the group operation
*Juxtaposition stands for multiplication on the set of congruence classes or application of the group operation (as applicable)
*Subtraction stands for subtraction on the set of congruence classes
*formula_5, the set of finite bit strings
*formula_6, the set of congruence classes modulo formula_2
*formula_8.

===Key generation===
*Choose a private signing key formula_9 from the allowed set.
*The public verification key is formula_10.

===Signing===
To sign a message formula_11:
*Choose a random formula_12 from the allowed set.
*Let formula_13.
*Let formula_14, where formula_15 denotes concatenation and formula_16 is represented as a bit string.
*Let formula_17.

The signature is the pair, formula_18.

Note that formula_19; if formula_20, then the signature representation can fit into 64 bytes.

===Verifying===
*Let formula_21
*Let formula_22

If formula_23 then the signature is verified.

===Proof of correctness===
It is relatively easy to see that formula_23 if the signed message equals the verified message:

formula_25, and hence formula_26.

Public elements: formula_1, formula_3, formula_2, formula_30, formula_31, formula_32, formula_16. Private elements: formula_12, formula_9.

This shows only that a correctly signed message will verify correctly; many other properties are required for a secure signature algorithm.

===Key leakage from nonce reuse===

Just as with the closely related signature algorithms DSA, ECDSA, and ElGamal, reusing the secret nonce value formula_12 on two Schnorr signatures of different messages will allow observers to recover the private key. In the case of Schnorr signatures, this simply requires subtracting formula_31 values:

: formula_38.

If formula_39 but formula_40 then formula_9 can be simply isolated. In fact, even slight biases in the value formula_12 or partial leakage of formula_12 can reveal the private key, after collecting sufficiently many signatures and solving the hidden number problem.

===Security argument===
The signature scheme was constructed by applying the Fiat–Shamir transformation to Schnorr&#x27;s identification protocol. Therefore, (as per Fiat and Shamir&#x27;s arguments), it is secure if formula_44 is modeled as a random oracle.

Its security can also be argued in the generic group model, under the assumption that formula_44 is &quot;random-prefix preimage resistant&quot; and &quot;random-prefix second-preimage resistant&quot;. In particular, formula_44 does &quot;not&quot; need to be collision resistant.

In 2012, Seurin provided an exact proof of the Schnorr signature scheme. In particular, Seurin shows that the security proof using the forking lemma is the best possible result for any signature schemes based on one-way group homomorphisms including Schnorr-type signatures and the Guillou–Quisquater signature schemes. Namely, under the ROMDL assumption, any algebraic reduction must lose a factor formula_47 in its time-to-success ratio, where formula_48 is a function that remains close to 1 as long as &quot;formula_49 is noticeably smaller than 1&quot;, where formula_49 is the probability of forging an error making at most formula_51 queries to the random oracle.

==Short Schnorr signatures==

The aforementioned process achieves a &quot;t&quot;-bit security level with 4&quot;t&quot;-bit signatures. For example, a 128-bit security level would require 512-bit (64-byte) signatures. The security is limited by discrete logarithm attacks on the group, which have a complexity of the &quot;square-root&quot; of the group size.

In Schnorr&#x27;s original 1991 paper, it was suggested that since collision resistance in the hash is not required, shorter hash functions may be just as secure, and indeed recent developments suggest that a &quot;t&quot;-bit security level can be achieved with 3&quot;t&quot;-bit signatures. Then, a 128-bit security level would require only 384-bit (48-byte) signatures, and this could be achieved by truncating the size of &quot;e&quot; until it is half the length of the &quot;s&quot; bitfield.

== Implementations ==
Schnorr signature is used by numerous products. A notable usage is the deterministic Schnorr&#x27;s signature using the secp256k1 elliptic curve for Bitcoin transaction signature after the Taproot update.

<text>Michael Corris is an artist, art historian and writer on art. He is professor emeritus of art, Division of Art, Meadows School of the Arts, Southern Methodist University, Dallas, Texas, United States. Previously, Corris held the post of Professor of Fine Art at the Art and Design Research Center, Sheffield Hallam University (Sheffield, United Kingdom). From 2005-6, he was a Visiting Professor of Art Theory at the Bergen Art Academy (Bergen, Norway).

==Life and career==
Corris received his baccalaureate and master&#x27;s degrees in the United States, studying studio art and art history at Brooklyn College under Harry Holtzman, Jimmy Ernst, Walter Rosenblum, Sylvia Stone, Philip Pearlstein and Carl Holty; and later, painting and art theory at the Hoffberger School of Painting, Maryland Institute College of Art under Grace Hartigan and the poet, Emmanuel Navaretta. In 1970, Corris was awarded a scholarship to attend the prestigious summer program in art at the Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture, where he had contact with Kenneth Noland, Jacob Lawrence, Brice Marden and David Diao. For his research on the work of Ad Reinhardt, Corris was awarded a PhD in the history of art in 1996 by University College London.

Corris began working in late-1971 with the Conceptual art group, Art &amp; Language, in New York; his work was published in 1973 in the group’s journal, Art-Language. With Mel Ramsden, Ian Burn, Joseph Kosuth, Sarah Charlesworth and others, Corris was a founding editor of &quot;The Fox;&quot; an artists-run journal that addressed the political and social dimensions of contemporary artistic practice.

Following the dissolution of Art &amp; Language in New York in late 1976, Corris continued to pursue his artistic practice, dividing his energies between the production of artist&#x27;s books inspired by typographic design and lecturing and writing on contemporary art and art theory. As a member of Art &amp; Language and as an individual artist, Corris&#x27;s work has been widely exhibited internationally and is part of the permanent collection of, among others, the Museum of Modern Art (New York City), the Whitney Museum of American Art (New York City), the Victoria and Albert Museum(London), Le Consortium (Dijon) and the J. P. Getty Museum (Los Angeles).

Corris lectures and publishes on the subject of late-modern and contemporary art . Corris’s art criticism has been widely published in journals and magazines devoted to modern and contemporary art, such as Art Monthly, Artforum, FlashArt, Art History, art+text and Mute. In addition, his critical writings have been included in several collections, most notably Alex Alberro and Blake Stimson (eds), Conceptual Art: A Critical Anthology (MIT Press) and John Roberts (ed), Art Has No History! (Verso Press).

Corris&#x27;s most recent publications include: Conceptual Art: Theory, Myth and Practice (Cambridge University Press, 2004), monographs on David Diao (TimeZone8 Books, Beijing, 2005) and Ad Reinhardt (Reaktion Books, London, 2008), Non-Relational Aesthetics (Artwords Press, 2008)(with Dr Charlie Gere), and Art, Word and Image: 2,000 Years of Visual/Textual Interaction (Reaktion Books, London, 2010)(with John Dixon Hunt and David Lomas).

In an October 2008 interview with Joan Waltemath published in &quot;The Brooklyn Rail&quot;, Corris discusses his book, &quot;Ad Reinhardt&quot;, which was an extension of his doctoral work, investigating the artist&#x27;s relationship to the American Communist movement and focusing &quot;on the period 1935-1950 in Reinhardt’s life, detailing his relationship to the politics of the left and providing the first comprehensive survey of his political illustrations and cartoons for publications like &quot;New Masses&quot; and &quot;Soviet Russia Today&quot;.&quot;

In April, 2010, Corris founded the Free Museum of Dallas; a project and exhibition space that occupied the Chairperson&#x27;s office at SMU (2010-2014) . Corris was Reviews Editor for the College Art Association publication, Art Journal (2013-2016) and is presently series editor for &quot;Art since the &#x27;80s&quot;, Reaktion Books, London. A selection of his writings on art is published by Les Presses du Réel (Dijon), 2016. &lt;https://www.lespressesdureel.com/EN/ouvrage.php?id=4893&amp;menu=1&gt;

<text>Count Wilhelm Kinsky von Wchinitz (; ; 1574 – 25 February 1634) was a Czech landowner and a statesman. By birth, he was member of the House of Kinsky, which belonged to the highest circle of Bohemian aristocracy.

==Early life ==
Wilhelm was born as the younger son of Johann Kinsky von Wchinitz, Burggraf of Karlštejn (1540-1590) and his wife, Anna Pauzar von Michnic (d. 1598), daughter of Johann Pauzar von Michnic.

==Biography==
In 1628, Wilhelm Kinsky was elevated to the rank of Count in the Bohemian nobility when Wallenstein was elevated to Duchy of Friedland. As a rich landowner in Bohemia, Kinsky lived in exile at Dresden after the Battle of White Mountain, because he was a Protestant and, unlike the members of the Trčka family, had refused to convert to the Catholic faith but was allowed to regularly visit his Bohemian estates. Subsequently, together with his brother-in-law Adam Erdmann Trčka, he attempted to pull Wallenstein over to the Protestant and Swedish side.

Kinsky was assassinated during the Thirty Years&#x27; War, on 25 February 1634 at Cheb, together with Trčka and other officers loyal to the general and the Field Marshal himself, during the so-called Eger Bloodbath, a plot to purge the Imperial Army from Albrecht von Wallenstein&#x27;s supporters. Kinsky&#x27;s estates, among them Teplice, were confiscated by Emperor Ferdinand II.

== Personal life ==
Wilhelm Kinsky married Countess Elisabeth Magdalena Trčka von Lípa, whose brother Adam Erdmann Trčka von Lípa was married with Countess Maximiliane von Harrach, a sister of Albrecht von Wallenstein&#x27;s second wife. They had:
* Count Adolf Ernst Kinsky von Wchinitz (d. after 1648); married Elisabeth Killgrew. They had:
** Count Wilhelm Leopold Kinsky von Wchinitz (d. 1709); married Franziska Rosalie Berka of Dubá. They had no issue
* Count Ulrich Kinsky von Wchinitz (d. after 1648)
* Count Philipp Moritz Kinsky von Wchinitz (d. after 1648)

<text>In cryptography, a zero-knowledge proof is a protocol in which one party (the prover) can convince another party (the verifier) that some given statement is true, without conveying to the verifier any information &quot;beyond&quot; the mere fact of that statement&#x27;s truth. The intuition underlying zero-knowledge proofs is that it is trivial to prove possession of the relevant information simply by revealing it; the hard part is to prove this possession without revealing this information (or any aspect of it whatsoever).

In light of the fact that one should be able to generate a proof of some statement &quot;only&quot; when in possession of certain secret information connected to the statement, the verifier, even after having become convinced of the statement&#x27;s truth, should nonetheless remain unable to prove the statement to further third parties.

Zero-knowledge proofs can be interactive, meaning that the prover and verifier exchange messages according to some protocol, or noninteractive, meaning that the verifier is convinced by a single prover message and no other communication is needed. In the standard model, interaction is required, except for trivial proofs of BPP problems. In the common random string and random oracle models, non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs exist. The Fiat–Shamir heuristic can be used to transform certain interactive zero-knowledge proofs into noninteractive ones.

== Abstract examples ==
=== The Ali Baba cave ===
There is a well-known story presenting the fundamental ideas of zero-knowledge proofs, first published in 1990 by Jean-Jacques Quisquater and others in their paper &quot;How to Explain Zero-Knowledge Protocols to Your Children&quot;. The two parties in the zero-knowledge proof story are Peggy as the prover of the statement, and Victor, the verifier of the statement.

In this story, Peggy has uncovered the secret word used to open a magic door in a cave. The cave is shaped like a ring, with the entrance on one side and the magic door blocking the opposite side. Victor wants to know whether Peggy knows the secret word; but Peggy, being a very private person, does not want to reveal her knowledge (the secret word) to Victor or to reveal the fact of her knowledge to the world in general.

They label the left and right paths from the entrance A and B. First, Victor waits outside the cave as Peggy goes in. Peggy takes either path A or B; Victor is not allowed to see which path she takes. Then, Victor enters the cave and shouts the name of the path he wants her to use to return, either A or B, chosen at random. Providing she really does know the magic word, this is easy: she opens the door, if necessary, and returns along the desired path.

However, suppose she did not know the word. Then, she would only be able to return by the named path if Victor were to give the name of the same path by which she had entered. Since Victor would choose A or B at random, she would have a 50% chance of guessing correctly. If they were to repeat this trick many times, say 20 times in a row, her chance of successfully anticipating all of Victor&#x27;s requests would be reduced to 1 in 220, or 9.5410−7.

Thus, if Peggy repeatedly appears at the exit Victor names, then he can conclude that it is extremely probable that Peggy does, in fact, know the secret word.

One side note with respect to third-party observers: even if Victor is wearing a hidden camera that records the whole transaction, the only thing the camera will record is in one case Victor shouting &quot;A!&quot; and Peggy appearing at A or in the other case Victor shouting &quot;B!&quot; and Peggy appearing at B. A recording of this type would be trivial for any two people to fake (requiring only that Peggy and Victor agree beforehand on the sequence of As and Bs that Victor will shout). Such a recording will certainly never be convincing to anyone but the original participants. In fact, even a person who was present as an observer at the original experiment should be unconvinced, since Victor and Peggy could have orchestrated the whole &quot;experiment&quot; from start to finish.

Further, if Victor chooses his As and Bs by flipping a coin on-camera, this protocol loses its zero-knowledge property; the on-camera coin flip would probably be convincing to any person watching the recording later. Thus, although this does not reveal the secret word to Victor, it does make it possible for Victor to convince the world in general that Peggy has that knowledge—counter to Peggy&#x27;s stated wishes. However, digital cryptography generally &quot;flips coins&quot; by relying on a pseudo-random number generator, which is akin to a coin with a fixed pattern of heads and tails known only to the coin&#x27;s owner. If Victor&#x27;s coin behaved this way, then again it would be possible for Victor and Peggy to have faked the experiment, so using a pseudo-random number generator would not reveal Peggy&#x27;s knowledge to the world in the same way that using a flipped coin would.

Peggy could prove to Victor that she knows the magic word, without revealing it to him, in a single trial. If both Victor and Peggy go together to the mouth of the cave, Victor can watch Peggy go in through A and come out through B. This would prove with certainty that Peggy knows the magic word, without revealing the magic word to Victor. However, such a proof could be observed by a third party, or recorded by Victor and such a proof would be convincing to anybody. In other words, Peggy could not refute such proof by claiming she colluded with Victor, and she is therefore no longer in control of who is aware of her knowledge.

=== Two balls and the colour-blind friend ===

Imagine your friend &quot;Victor&quot; is red-green colour-blind (while you are not) and you have two balls: one red and one green, but otherwise identical. To Victor, the balls seem completely identical. Victor is skeptical that the balls are actually distinguishable. You want to &quot;prove to Victor that the balls are in fact differently coloured&quot;, but nothing else. In particular, you do not want to reveal which ball is the red one and which is the green.

Here is the proof system. You give the two balls to Victor and he puts them behind his back. Next, he takes one of the balls and brings it out from behind his back and displays it. He then places it behind his back again and then chooses to reveal just one of the two balls, picking one of the two at random with equal probability. He will ask you, &quot;Did I switch the ball?&quot; This whole procedure is then repeated as often as necessary.

By looking at the balls&#x27; colours, you can, of course, say with certainty whether or not he switched them. On the other hand, if the balls were the same colour and hence indistinguishable, your ability to determine whether a switch occurred would be no better than random guessing. Since the probability that you would have randomly succeeded at identifying each switch/non-switch is 50%, the probability of having randomly succeeded at &quot;all&quot; switch/non-switches approaches zero (&quot;soundness&quot;).

Over multiple trials, the success rate would statistically converge to 50%, and you could not achieve a performance significantly better than chance. If you and your friend repeat this &quot;proof&quot; multiple times (e.g. 20 times), your friend should become convinced (&quot;completeness&quot;) that the balls are indeed differently coloured.

The above proof is &quot;zero-knowledge&quot; because your friend never learns which ball is green and which is red; indeed, he gains no knowledge about how to distinguish the balls.

=== Where&#x27;s Waldo ===

One well-known example of a zero-knowledge proof is the &quot;Where&#x27;s Waldo&quot; example. In this example, the prover wants to prove to the verifier that they know where Waldo is on a page in a &quot;Where&#x27;s Waldo?&quot; book, without revealing his location to the verifier.

The prover starts by taking a large black board with a small hole in it, the size of Waldo. The board is twice the size of the book in both directions, so the verifier cannot see where on the page the prover is placing it. The prover then places the board over the page so that Waldo is in the hole.

The verifier can now look through the hole and see Waldo, but cannot see any other part of the page. Therefore, the prover has proven to the verifier that they know where Waldo is, without revealing any other information about his location.

This example is not a perfect zero-knowledge proof, because the prover does reveal some information about Waldo&#x27;s location, such as his body position. However, it is a decent illustration of the basic concept of a zero-knowledge proof.

== Definition ==

A zero-knowledge proof of some statement must satisfy three properties:

# Completeness: if the statement is true, then an honest verifier (that is, one following the protocol properly) will be convinced of this fact by an honest prover.
# Soundness: if the statement is false, then no cheating prover can convince an honest verifier that it is true, except with some small probability.
# Zero-knowledge: if the statement is true, then no verifier learns anything other than the fact that the statement is true. In other words, just knowing the statement (not the secret) is sufficient to imagine a scenario showing that the prover knows the secret. This is formalized by showing that every verifier has some &quot;simulator&quot; that, given only the statement to be proved (and no access to the prover), can produce a transcript that &quot;looks like&quot; an interaction between an honest prover and the verifier in question.

The first two of these are properties of more general interactive proof systems. The third is what makes the proof zero-knowledge.

Zero-knowledge proofs are not proofs in the mathematical sense of the term because there is some small probability, the &quot;soundness error&quot;, that a cheating prover will be able to convince the verifier of a false statement. In other words, zero-knowledge proofs are probabilistic &quot;proofs&quot; rather than deterministic proofs. However, there are techniques to decrease the soundness error to negligibly small values (for example, guessing correctly on a hundred or thousand binary decisions has a 1/2100 or 1/21000 soundness error, respectively. As the number of bits increases, the soundness error decreases toward zero).

A formal definition of zero-knowledge must use some computational model, the most common one being that of a Turing machine. Let , , and be Turing machines. An interactive proof system with for a language is zero-knowledge if for any probabilistic polynomial time (PPT) verifier formula_1 there exists a PPT simulator such that:

: formula_2

where is a record of the interactions between and . The prover is modeled as having unlimited computation power (in practice, usually is a probabilistic Turing machine). Intuitively, the definition states that an interactive proof system is zero-knowledge if for any verifier formula_1 there exists an efficient simulator (depending on formula_1) that can reproduce the conversation between and formula_1 on any given input. The auxiliary string in the definition plays the role of &quot;prior knowledge&quot; (including the random coins of formula_1). The definition implies that formula_1 cannot use any prior knowledge string to mine information out of its conversation with , because if is also given this prior knowledge then it can reproduce the conversation between formula_1 and just as before. 

The definition given is that of perfect zero-knowledge. Computational zero-knowledge is obtained by requiring that the views of the verifier formula_1 and the simulator are only computationally indistinguishable, given the auxiliary string. 

== Practical examples ==

=== Discrete log of a given value ===

These ideas can be applied to a more realistic cryptography application. Peggy wants to prove to Victor that she knows the discrete logarithm of a given value in a given group.

For example, given a value , a large prime , and a generator formula_10, she wants to prove that she knows a value such that , without revealing . Indeed, knowledge of could be used as a proof of identity, in that Peggy could have such knowledge because she chose a random value that she did not reveal to anyone, computed , and distributed the value of to all potential verifiers, such that at a later time, proving knowledge of is equivalent to proving identity as Peggy.

The protocol proceeds as follows: in each round, Peggy generates a random number , computes and discloses this to Victor. After receiving , Victor randomly issues one of the following two requests: he either requests that Peggy discloses the value of , or the value of .

Victor can verify either answer; if he requested , he can then compute and verify that it matches . If he requested , then he can verify that is consistent with this, by computing and verifying that it matches . If Peggy indeed knows the value of , then she can respond to either one of Victor&#x27;s possible challenges.

If Peggy knew or could guess which challenge Victor is going to issue, then she could easily cheat and convince Victor that she knows when she does not: if she knows that Victor is going to request , then she proceeds normally: she picks , computes , and discloses to Victor; she will be able to respond to Victor&#x27;s challenge. On the other hand, if she knows that Victor will request , then she picks a random value , computes , and discloses to Victor as the value of that he is expecting. When Victor challenges her to reveal , she reveals , for which Victor will verify consistency, since he will in turn compute , which matches , since Peggy multiplied by the modular multiplicative inverse of .

However, if in either one of the above scenarios Victor issues a challenge other than the one she was expecting and for which she manufactured the result, then she will be unable to respond to the challenge under the assumption of infeasibility of solving the discrete log for this group. If she picked and disclosed , then she will be unable to produce a valid that would pass Victor&#x27;s verification, given that she does not know . And if she picked a value that poses as , then she would have to respond with the discrete log of the value that she disclosed but Peggy does not know this discrete log, since the value she disclosed was obtained through arithmetic with known values, and not by computing a power with a known exponent.

Thus, a cheating prover has a 0.5 probability of successfully cheating in one round. By executing a large-enough number of rounds, the probability of a cheating prover succeeding can be made arbitrarily low.

To show that the above interactive proof gives zero knowledge other than the fact that Peggy knows , one can use similar arguments as used in the above proof of completeness and soundness. Specifically, a simulator, say Simon, who does not know , can simulate the exchange between Peggy and Victor by the following procedure. Firstly, Simon randomly flips a fair coin. If the result is &quot;heads&quot;, then he picks a random value , computes , and discloses as if it is a message from Peggy to Victor. Then Simon also outputs a message &quot;request the value of &quot; as if it is sent from Victor to Peggy, and immediately outputs the value of as if it is sent from Peggy to Victor. A single round is complete. On the other hand, if the coin flipping result is &quot;tails&quot;, then Simon picks a random number , computes , and discloses as if it is a message from Peggy to Victor. Then Simon outputs &quot;request the value of &quot; as if it is a message from Victor to Peggy. Finally, Simon outputs the value of as if it is the response from Peggy back to Victor. A single round is complete. By the previous arguments when proving the completeness and soundness, the interactive communication simulated by Simon is indistinguishable from the true correspondence between Peggy and Victor. The zero-knowledge property is thus guaranteed.

==== Short summary ====

Peggy proves to know the value of (for example her password).

#Peggy and Victor agree on a prime and a generator formula_10 of the multiplicative group of the field .
#Peggy calculates the value and transfers the value to Victor.
#The following two steps are repeated a (large) number of times.
##Peggy repeatedly picks a random value and calculates . She transfers the value to Victor.
##Victor asks Peggy to calculate and transfer either the value or the value . In the first case Victor verifies . In the second case he verifies .

The value can be seen as the encrypted value of . If is truly random, uniformly distributed between zero and , then this does not leak any information about (see one-time pad).

=== Hamiltonian cycle for a large graph ===
The following scheme is due to Manuel Blum.

In this scenario, Peggy knows a Hamiltonian cycle for a large graph . Victor knows but not the cycle (e.g., Peggy has generated and revealed it to him.) Finding a Hamiltonian cycle given a large graph is believed to be computationally infeasible, since its corresponding decision version is known to be NP-complete. Peggy will prove that she knows the cycle without simply revealing it (perhaps Victor is interested in buying it but wants verification first, or maybe Peggy is the only one who knows this information and is proving her identity to Victor).

To show that Peggy knows this Hamiltonian cycle, she and Victor play several rounds of a game:

* At the beginning of each round, Peggy creates , a graph which is isomorphic to (that is, is just like except that all the vertices have different names). Since it is trivial to translate a Hamiltonian cycle between isomorphic graphs with known isomorphism, if Peggy knows a Hamiltonian cycle for then she also must know one for .
* Peggy commits to . She could do so by using a cryptographic commitment scheme. Alternatively, she could number the vertices of . Next, for each edge of , on a small piece of paper, she writes down the two vertices that the edge joins. Then she puts all these pieces of paper face down on a table. The purpose of this commitment is that Peggy is not able to change while, at the same time, Victor has no information about .
* Victor then randomly chooses one of two questions to ask Peggy. He can either ask her to show the isomorphism between and (see graph isomorphism problem), or he can ask her to show a Hamiltonian cycle in .
* If Peggy is asked to show that the two graphs are isomorphic, then she first uncovers all of (e.g. by turning over all pieces of papers that she put on the table) and then provides the vertex translations that map to . Victor can verify that they are indeed isomorphic.
* If Peggy is asked to prove that she knows a Hamiltonian cycle in , then she translates her Hamiltonian cycle in onto and only uncovers the edges on the Hamiltonian cycle. That is, Peggy only turns over exactly of the pieces of paper that correspond to the edges of the Hamiltonian cycle, while leaving the rest still face-down. This is enough for Victor to check that does indeed contain a Hamiltonian cycle.

It is important that the commitment to the graph be such that Victor can verify, in the second case, that the cycle is really made of edges from . This can be done by, for example, committing to every edge (or lack thereof) separately.

==== Completeness ====
If Peggy does know a Hamiltonian cycle in , then she can easily satisfy Victor&#x27;s demand for either the graph isomorphism producing from (which she had committed to in the first step) or a Hamiltonian cycle in (which she can construct by applying the isomorphism to the cycle in ).

==== Zero-knowledge ====
Peggy&#x27;s answers do not reveal the original Hamiltonian cycle in . In each round, Victor will learn only &#x27;s isomorphism to or a Hamiltonian cycle in . He would need both answers for a single to discover the cycle in , so the information remains unknown as long as Peggy can generate a distinct every round. If Peggy does not know of a Hamiltonian cycle in , but somehow knew in advance what Victor would ask to see each round, then she could cheat. For example, if Peggy knew ahead of time that Victor would ask to see the Hamiltonian cycle in , then she could generate a Hamiltonian cycle for an unrelated graph. Similarly, if Peggy knew in advance that Victor would ask to see the isomorphism then she could simply generate an isomorphic graph (in which she also does not know a Hamiltonian cycle). Victor could simulate the protocol by himself (without Peggy) because he knows what he will ask to see. Therefore, Victor gains no information about the Hamiltonian cycle in from the information revealed in each round.

==== Soundness ====
If Peggy does not know the information, then she can guess which question Victor will ask and generate either a graph isomorphic to or a Hamiltonian cycle for an unrelated graph, but since she does not know a Hamiltonian cycle for , she cannot do both. With this guesswork, her chance of fooling Victor is , where is the number of rounds. For all realistic purposes, it is infeasibly difficult to defeat a zero-knowledge proof with a reasonable number of rounds in this way.

== Variants of zero-knowledge ==
Different variants of zero-knowledge can be defined by formalizing the intuitive concept of what is meant by the output of the simulator &quot;looking like&quot; the execution of the real proof protocol in the following ways:

* We speak of &quot;perfect zero-knowledge&quot; if the distributions produced by the simulator and the proof protocol are distributed exactly the same. This is for instance the case in the first example above.
* &quot;Statistical zero-knowledge&quot; means that the distributions are not necessarily exactly the same, but they are statistically close, meaning that their statistical difference is a negligible function.
* We speak of &quot;computational zero-knowledge&quot; if no efficient algorithm can distinguish the two distributions.

==Zero knowledge types==
There are various types of zero-knowledge proofs:
* Proof of knowledge: the knowledge is hidden in the exponent like in the example shown above.
* Witness-indistinguishable proof: verifiers cannot know which witness is used for producing the proof.

Zero-knowledge proof schemes can be constructed from various cryptographic primitives, such as hash-based cryptography, pairing-based cryptography, multi-party computation, or lattice-based cryptography.

== Applications ==

=== Authentication systems ===
Research in zero-knowledge proofs has been motivated by authentication systems where one party wants to prove its identity to a second party via some secret information (such as a password) but does not want the second party to learn anything about this secret. This is called a &quot;zero-knowledge proof of knowledge&quot;. However, a password is typically too small or insufficiently random to be used in many schemes for zero-knowledge proofs of knowledge. A zero-knowledge password proof is a special kind of zero-knowledge proof of knowledge that addresses the limited size of passwords.

In April 2015, the one-out-of-many proofs protocol (a Sigma protocol) was introduced. In August 2021, Cloudflare, an American web infrastructure and security company, decided to use the one-out-of-many proofs mechanism for private web verification using vendor hardware.

=== Ethical behavior ===
One of the uses of zero-knowledge proofs within cryptographic protocols is to enforce honest behavior while maintaining privacy. Roughly, the idea is to force a user to prove, using a zero-knowledge proof, that its behavior is correct according to the protocol. Because of soundness, we know that the user must really act honestly in order to be able to provide a valid proof. Because of zero knowledge, we know that the user does not compromise the privacy of its secrets in the process of providing the proof.

=== Nuclear disarmament ===
In 2016, the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory and Princeton University demonstrated a technique that may have applicability to future nuclear disarmament talks. It would allow inspectors to confirm whether or not an object is indeed a nuclear weapon without recording, sharing, or revealing the internal workings, which might be secret.

=== Blockchains ===
Zero-knowledge proofs were applied in the Zerocoin and Zerocash protocols, which culminated in the birth of Zcoin (later rebranded as Firo in 2020) and Zcash cryptocurrencies in 2016. Zerocoin has a built-in mixing model that does not trust any peers or centralised mixing providers to ensure anonymity. Users can transact in a base currency and can cycle the currency into and out of Zerocoins. The Zerocash protocol uses a similar model (a variant known as a non-interactive zero-knowledge proof) except that it can obscure the transaction amount, while Zerocoin cannot. Given significant restrictions of transaction data on the Zerocash network, Zerocash is less prone to privacy timing attacks when compared to Zerocoin. However, this additional layer of privacy can cause potentially undetected hyperinflation of Zerocash supply because fraudulent coins cannot be tracked.

In 2018, Bulletproofs were introduced. Bulletproofs are an improvement from non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs where a trusted setup is not needed. It was later implemented into the Mimblewimble protocol (which the Grin and Beam cryptocurrencies are based upon) and Monero cryptocurrency. In 2019, Firo implemented the Sigma protocol, which is an improvement on the Zerocoin protocol without trusted setup. In the same year, Firo introduced the Lelantus protocol, an improvement on the Sigma protocol, where the former hides the origin and amount of a transaction.

=== Decentralized Identifiers ===
Zero-knowledge proofs by their nature can enhance privacy in identity-sharing systems, which are vulnerable to data breaches and identity theft. When integrated to a decentralized identifier system, ZKPs add an extra layer of encryption on DID documents.

== History ==
Zero-knowledge proofs were first conceived in 1985 by Shafi Goldwasser, Silvio Micali, and Charles Rackoff in their paper &quot;The Knowledge Complexity of Interactive Proof-Systems&quot;. This paper introduced the IP hierarchy of interactive proof systems (&quot;see interactive proof system&quot;) and conceived the concept of &quot;knowledge complexity&quot;, a measurement of the amount of knowledge about the proof transferred from the prover to the verifier. They also gave the first zero-knowledge proof for a concrete problem, that of deciding quadratic nonresidues mod . Together with a paper by László Babai and Shlomo Moran, this landmark paper invented interactive proof systems, for which all five authors won the first Gödel Prize in 1993.

In their own words, Goldwasser, Micali, and Rackoff say:
Of particular interest is the case where this additional knowledge is essentially 0 and we show that [it] is possible to interactively prove that a number is quadratic non residue mod &quot;m&quot; releasing 0 additional knowledge. This is surprising as no efficient algorithm for deciding quadratic residuosity mod &quot;m&quot; is known when &quot;m&quot;’s factorization is not given. Moreover, all known &quot;NP&quot; proofs for this problem exhibit the prime factorization of &quot;m&quot;. This indicates that adding interaction to the proving process, may decrease the amount of knowledge that must be communicated in order to prove a theorem.
The quadratic nonresidue problem has both an NP and a co-NP algorithm, and so lies in the intersection of NP and co-NP. This was also true of several other problems for which zero-knowledge proofs were subsequently discovered, such as an unpublished proof system by Oded Goldreich verifying that a two-prime modulus is not a Blum integer.

Oded Goldreich, Silvio Micali, and Avi Wigderson took this one step further, showing that, assuming the existence of unbreakable encryption, one can create a zero-knowledge proof system for the NP-complete graph coloring problem with three colors. Since every problem in NP can be efficiently reduced to this problem, this means that, under this assumption, all problems in NP have zero-knowledge proofs. The reason for the assumption is that, as in the above example, their protocols require encryption. A commonly cited sufficient condition for the existence of unbreakable encryption is the existence of one-way functions, but it is conceivable that some physical means might also achieve it.

On top of this, they also showed that the graph nonisomorphism problem, the complement of the graph isomorphism problem, has a zero-knowledge proof. This problem is in co-NP, but is not currently known to be in either NP or any practical class. More generally, Russell Impagliazzo and Moti Yung as well as Ben-Or et al. would go on to show that, also assuming one-way functions or unbreakable encryption, there are zero-knowledge proofs for &quot;all&quot; problems in IP = PSPACE, or in other words, anything that can be proved by an interactive proof system can be proved with zero knowledge.

Not liking to make unnecessary assumptions, many theorists sought a way to eliminate the necessity of one way functions. One way this was done was with &quot;multi-prover interactive proof systems&quot; (see interactive proof system), which have multiple independent provers instead of only one, allowing the verifier to &quot;cross-examine&quot; the provers in isolation to avoid being misled. It can be shown that, without any intractability assumptions, all languages in NP have zero-knowledge proofs in such a system.

It turns out that, in an Internet-like setting, where multiple protocols may be executed concurrently, building zero-knowledge proofs is more challenging. The line of research investigating concurrent zero-knowledge proofs was initiated by the work of Dwork, Naor, and Sahai. One particular development along these lines has been the development of witness-indistinguishable proof protocols. The property of witness-indistinguishability is related to that of zero-knowledge, yet witness-indistinguishable protocols do not suffer from the same problems of concurrent execution.

Another variant of zero-knowledge proofs are non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs. Blum, Feldman, and Micali showed that a common random string shared between the prover and the verifier is enough to achieve computational zero-knowledge without requiring interaction.

== Zero-Knowledge Proof protocols ==
The most popular interactive or non-interactive zero-knowledge proof (e.g., zk-SNARK) protocols can be broadly categorized in the following four categories: Succinct Non-Interactive ARguments of Knowledge (SNARK), Scalable Transparent ARgument of Knowledge (STARK), Verifiable Polynomial Delegation (VPD), and Succinct Non-interactive ARGuments (SNARG). A list of zero-knowledge proof protocols and libraries is provided below along with comparisons based on transparency, universality, plausible post-quantum security, and programming paradigm. A transparent protocol is one that does not require any trusted setup and uses public randomness. A universal protocol is one that does not require a separate trusted setup for each circuit. Finally, a plausibly post-quantum protocol is one that is not susceptible to known attacks involving quantum algorithms.

<text>Femtochemistry is the area of physical chemistry that studies chemical reactions on extremely short timescales (approximately 10−15 seconds or one femtosecond, hence the name) in order to study the very act of atoms within molecules (reactants) rearranging themselves to form new molecules (products). In a 1988 issue of the journal &quot;Science&quot;, Ahmed Hassan Zewail published an article using this term for the first time, stating &quot;Real-time femtochemistry, that is, chemistry on the femtosecond timescale...&quot;. Later in 1999, Zewail received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his pioneering work in this field showing that it is possible to see how atoms in a molecule move during a chemical reaction with flashes of laser light.

Application of femtochemistry in biological studies has also helped to elucidate the conformational dynamics of stem-loop RNA structures.

Many publications have discussed the possibility of controlling chemical reactions by this method, but this remains controversial. The steps in some reactions occur in the femtosecond timescale and sometimes in attosecond timescales, and will sometimes form intermediate products. These reaction intermediates cannot always be deduced from observing the start and end products.

== Pump–probe spectroscopy ==
The simplest approach and still one of the most common techniques is known as pump–probe spectroscopy. In this method, two or more optical pulses with variable time delay between them are used to investigate the processes happening during a chemical reaction. The first pulse (pump) initiates the reaction, by breaking a bond or exciting one of the reactants. The second pulse (probe) is then used to interrogate the progress of the reaction a certain period of time after initiation. As the reaction progresses, the response of the reacting system to the probe pulse will change. By continually scanning the time delay between pump and probe pulses and observing the response, workers can reconstruct the progress of the reaction as a function of time.

== Examples ==

=== Bromine dissociation ===
Femtochemistry has been used to show the time-resolved electronic stages of bromine dissociation. When dissociated by a 400 nm laser pulse, electrons completely localize onto individual atoms after 140 fs, with Br atoms separated by 6.0 Å after 160 fs.

<doc id="450547" wikidata="Q465762" url="?curid=450547" title="Laocoön and His Sons">
<text>The statue of Laocoön and His Sons, also called the Laocoön Group (), has been one of the most famous ancient sculptures since it was excavated in Rome in 1506 and put on public display in the Vatican Museums, where it remains today. The statue is very likely the same one that was praised in the highest terms by Pliny the Elder, the main Roman writer on art, who attributed it to Greek sculptors but did not say when it was created. The figures in the statue are nearly life-sized, with the entire group measuring just over in height. The sculpture depicts the Trojan priest Laocoön and his sons Antiphantes and Thymbraeus being attacked by sea serpents.

The Laocoön Group has been called &quot;the prototypical icon of human agony&quot; in Western art. Unlike the agony often portrayed in Christian art depicting the Passion of Jesus and martyrs, the suffering shown in this statue offers no redemptive power or reward. The agony is conveyed through the contorted expressions on the faces, particularly Laocoön&#x27;s bulging eyebrows, which were noted by Guillaume Duchenne de Boulogne as physiologically impossible. These expressions are mirrored in the struggling bodies, especially Laocoön&#x27;s, with every part of his body shown straining.

Pliny attributed the work, then in the palace of Emperor Titus, to three Greek sculptors from the island of Rhodes: Agesander, Athenodoros, and Polydorus, but he did not mention the date or patron. In style it is considered &quot;one of the finest examples of the Hellenistic baroque&quot; and certainly in the Greek tradition. However, its origin is uncertain, as it is not known if it is an original work or a copy of an earlier bronze sculpture. Some believe it to be a copy of a work from the early Imperial period, while others think it to be an original work from the later period, continuing the Pergamene style of some two centuries earlier. Regardless, it was probably commissioned for a wealthy Roman&#x27;s home, possibly from the Imperial family. The dates suggested for the statue range from 200 BC to the 70s AD, with a Julio-Claudian date (27 BC to 68 AD) now being the preferred option.

Despite being in mostly excellent condition for an excavated sculpture, the group is missing several parts and underwent several ancient modifications, as well as restorations since its excavation. The statue is currently on display in the Museo Pio-Clementino, which is part of the Vatican Museums.

==Subject==

The story of Laocoön, a Trojan priest, came from the Greek Epic Cycle on the Trojan Wars, though it is not mentioned by Homer. It had been the subject of a tragedy, now lost, by Sophocles and was mentioned by other Greek writers, though the events around the attack by the serpents vary considerably. The most famous account of these is now in Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Aeneid&quot; (see the &quot;Aeneid&quot; quotation at the entry Laocoön), but this dates from between 29 and 19 BC, which is possibly later than the sculpture. However, some scholars see the group as a depiction of the scene as described by Virgil.

In Virgil, Laocoön was a priest of Poseidon who was killed with both his sons after attempting to expose the ruse of the Trojan Horse by striking it with a spear. In Sophocles, on the other hand, he was a priest of Apollo, who should have been celibate but had married. The serpents killed only the two sons, leaving Laocoön himself alive to suffer. In other versions he was killed for having had sex with his wife in the temple of Poseidon, or simply making a sacrifice in the temple with his wife present. In this second group of versions, the snakes were sent by Poseidon and in the first by Poseidon and Athena, or Apollo, and the deaths were interpreted by the Trojans as proof that the horse was a sacred object. The two versions have rather different morals: Laocoön was either punished for doing wrong, or for being right.

The snakes are depicted as both biting and constricting, and are probably intended as venomous, as in Virgil. Pietro Aretino thought so, praising the group in 1537:
...the two serpents, in attacking the three figures, produce the most striking semblances of fear, suffering and death. The youth embraced in the coils is fearful; the old man struck by the fangs is in torment; the child who has received the poison, dies.

In at least one Greek telling of the story the older son is able to escape, and the composition seems to allow for that possibility.

==History==

===Ancient times===
The style of the work is agreed to be that of the Hellenistic &quot;Pergamene baroque&quot; which arose in Greek Asia Minor around 200 BC, and whose best known undoubtedly original work is the Pergamon Altar, dated –160 BC, and now in Berlin.
The figure of Alcyoneus is shown in a pose and situation (including serpents) which is very similar to those of Laocoön, though the style is &quot;looser and wilder in its principles&quot; than the altar.

The execution of the Laocoön is extremely fine throughout, and the composition very carefully calculated, even though it appears that the group underwent adjustments in ancient times. The two sons are rather small in scale compared to their father, but this adds to the impact of the central figure. The fine white marble used is often thought to be Greek, but has not been identified by analysis.

====Pliny====
In Pliny&#x27;s survey of Greek and Roman stone sculpture in his encyclopedic &quot;Natural History&quot; (XXXVI, 37), he says:
...in the case of several works of very great excellence, the number of artists that have been engaged upon them has proved a considerable obstacle to the fame of each, no individual being able to engross the whole of the credit, and it being impossible to award it in due proportion to the names of the several artists combined. Such is the case with the Laocoön, for example, in the palace of the Emperor Titus, a work that may be looked upon as preferable to any other production of the art of painting or of [bronze] statuary. It is sculptured from a single block, both the main figure as well as the children, and the serpents with their marvellous folds. This group was made in concert by three most eminent artists, Agesander, Polydorus, and Athenodorus, natives of Rhodes.

It is generally accepted that this is the same work as is now in the Vatican. It is now very often thought that the three Rhodians were copyists, perhaps of a bronze sculpture from Pergamon, created around 200 BC. It is noteworthy that Pliny does not address this issue explicitly, in a way that suggests &quot;he regards it as an original&quot;. Pliny states that it was located in the palace of the emperor Titus, and it is possible that it remained in the same place until 1506 (see &quot;Findspot&quot; section below). He also asserts that it was carved from a single piece of marble, though the Vatican work comprises at least seven interlocking pieces. The phrase translated above as &quot;in concert&quot; (&quot;de consilii sententia&quot;) is regarded by some as referring to their commission rather than the artists&#x27; method of working, giving in Nigel Spivey&#x27;s translation: &quot;[the artists] at the behest of council designed a group...&quot;, which Spivey takes to mean that the commission was by Titus, possibly even advised by Pliny among other &quot;savants&quot;.

The same three artists&#x27; names, though in a different order (Athenodoros, Agesander, and Polydorus), with the names of their fathers, are inscribed on one of the sculptures at Tiberius&#x27;s villa at Sperlonga (though they may predate his ownership), but it seems likely that not all the three masters were the same individuals. Though broadly similar in style, many aspects of the execution of the two groups are drastically different, with the Laocoon group of much higher quality and finish.

Some scholars used to think that honorific inscriptions found at Lindos in Rhodes dated Agesander and Athenodoros, recorded as priests, to a period after 42 BC, making the years 42 to 20 BC the most likely date for the Laocoön group&#x27;s creation. However the Sperlonga inscription, which also gives the fathers of the artists, makes it clear that at least Agesander is a different individual from the priest of the same name recorded at Lindos, though very possibly related. The names may have recurred across generations, a Rhodian habit, within the context of a family workshop (which might well have included the adoption of promising young sculptors). Altogether eight &quot;signatures&quot; (or labels) of an Athenodoros are found on sculptures or bases for them, five of these from Italy. Some, including that from Sperlonga, record his father as Agesander. The whole question remains the subject of academic debate.

===Renaissance===

The group was unearthed in February 1506 in the vineyard of Felice De Fredis; informed of the fact, Pope Julius II, an enthusiastic classicist, sent for his court artists. Michelangelo was called to the site of the unearthing of the statue immediately after its discovery, along with the Florentine architect Giuliano da Sangallo and his eleven-year-old son Francesco da Sangallo, later a sculptor, who wrote an account over sixty years later:

The first time I was in Rome when I was very young, the pope was told about the discovery of some very beautiful statues in a vineyard near Santa Maria Maggiore. The pope ordered one of his officers to run and tell Giuliano da Sangallo to go and see them. So he set off immediately. Since Michelangelo Buonarroti was always to be found at our house, my father having summoned him and having assigned him the commission of the pope&#x27;s tomb, my father wanted him to come along, too. I joined up with my father and off we went. I climbed down to where the statues were when immediately my father said, &quot;That is the Laocoön, which Pliny mentions&quot;. Then they dug the hole wider so that they could pull the statue out. As soon as it was visible everyone started to draw (or &quot;started to have lunch&quot;), all the while discoursing on ancient things, chatting as well about the ones in Florence.

Julius acquired the group on March 23, giving De Fredis a job as a scribe as well as the customs revenues from one of the gates of Rome. By August the group was placed for public viewing in a niche in the wall of the brand new Belvedere Garden at the Vatican, now part of the Vatican Museums, which regard this as the start of their history. As yet it had no base, which was not added until 1511, and from various prints and drawings from the time the older son appears to have been completely detached from the rest of the group.

In July 1798 the statue was taken to France in the wake of the French conquest of Italy, though the replacement parts were left in Rome. It was on display when the new Musée Central des Arts, later the Musée Napoléon, opened at the Louvre in November 1800. A competition was announced for new parts to complete the composition, but there were no entries. Some plaster sections by François Girardon, over 150 years old, were used instead. After Napoleon&#x27;s final defeat at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815 most (but certainly not all) of the artworks plundered by the French were returned, and the Laocoön reached Rome in January 1816.

===Restorations===

When the statue was discovered, Laocoön&#x27;s right arm was missing, along with part of the hand of one son and the right arm of the other, and various sections of the snake. The older son, on the right, was detached from the other two figures. The age of the altar used as a seat by Laocoön remains uncertain. Artists and connoisseurs debated how the missing parts should be interpreted. Michelangelo suggested that the missing right arms were originally bent back over the shoulder. Others, however, believed it was more appropriate to show the right arms extended outwards in a heroic gesture.

According to Vasari, in about 1510 Bramante, the Pope&#x27;s architect, held an informal contest among sculptors to make replacement right arms, which was judged by Raphael, and won by Jacopo Sansovino. The winner, in the outstretched position, was used in copies but not attached to the original group, which remained as it was until 1532, when Giovanni Antonio Montorsoli, a pupil of Michelangelo, added his even more straight version of Laocoön&#x27;s outstretched arm, which remained in place until modern times. In 1725–1727 Agostino Cornacchini added a section to the younger son&#x27;s arm, and after 1816 Antonio Canova tidied up the group after their return from Paris, without being convinced by the correctness of the additions but wishing to avoid a controversy.
In 1906 Ludwig Pollak, archaeologist, art dealer and director of the Museo Barracco, discovered a fragment of a marble arm in a builder&#x27;s yard in Rome, close to where the group was found. Noting a stylistic similarity to the Laocoön group he presented it to the Vatican Museums: it remained in their storerooms for half a century. In 1957 the museum decided that this armbent, as Michelangelo had suggestedhad originally belonged to this Laocoön, and replaced it. According to Paolo Liverani: &quot;Remarkably, despite the lack of a critical section, the join between the torso and the arm was guaranteed by a drill hole on one piece which aligned perfectly with a corresponding hole on the other.&quot;

In the 1980s the statue was dismantled and reassembled, again with the Pollak arm incorporated. The restored portions of the sons&#x27; arms and hands were removed. In the course of disassembly, it was possible to observe breaks, cuttings, metal tenons, and dowel holes which suggested that in antiquity, a more compact, three-dimensional pyramidal grouping of the three figures had been used or at least contemplated. According to Seymour Howard, both the Vatican group and the Sperlonga sculptures &quot;show a similar taste for open and flexible pictorial organization that called for pyrotechnic piercing and lent itself to changes at the site, and in new situations&quot;.

The more open, planographic composition along a plane, used in the restoration of the Laocoön group, has been interpreted as &quot;apparently the result of serial reworkings by Roman Imperial as well as Renaissance and modern craftsmen&quot;. A different reconstruction was proposed by Seymour Howard, to give &quot;a more cohesive, baroque-looking and diagonally-set pyramidal composition&quot;, by turning the older son as much as 90°, with his back to the side of the altar, and looking towards the frontal viewer rather than at his father. The findings Seymour Howard documented do not change his belief about the organization of the original. But dating the reworked coil ends by measuring the depth of the surface crust and comparing the metal dowels in the original and reworked portions allows one to determine the provenance of the parts and the sequence of the repairs. Other suggestions have been made.

==Influence==
The discovery of the &quot;Laocoön&quot; made a great impression on Italian artists and continued to influence Italian art into the Baroque period. Michelangelo is known to have been particularly impressed by the massive scale of the work and its sensuous Hellenistic aesthetic, particularly its depiction of the male figures. The influence of the &quot;Laocoön&quot;, as well as the Belvedere Torso, is evidenced in many of Michelangelo&#x27;s later sculptures, such as the &quot;Rebellious Slave&quot; and the &quot;Dying Slave&quot;, created for the tomb of Pope Julius II. Several of the &quot;ignudi&quot; and the figure of Haman in the Sistine Chapel ceiling draw on the figures. Raphael used the face of Laocoön for his Homer in his &quot;Parnassus&quot; in the Raphael Rooms, expressing blindness rather than pain.

The Florentine sculptor Baccio Bandinelli was commissioned to make a copy by the Medici Pope Leo X. Bandinelli&#x27;s version, which was often copied and distributed in small bronzes, is in the Uffizi Gallery, Florence, the Pope having decided it was too good to send to François I of France as originally intended. A bronze casting, made for François I at Fontainebleau from a mold taken from the original under the supervision of Primaticcio, is at the Musée du Louvre. There are many copies of the statue, including a well-known one in the Grand Palace of the Knights of St. John in Rhodes. Many still show the arm in the outstretched position, but the copy in Rhodes has been corrected.

The group was rapidly depicted in prints as well as small models, and became known all over Europe. Titian appears to have had access to a good cast or reproduction from about 1520, and echoes of the figures begin to appear in his works, two of them in the &quot;Averoldi Altarpiece&quot; of 1520–1522. A woodcut, probably after a drawing by Titian, parodied the sculpture by portraying three apes instead of humans. It has often been interpreted as a satire on the clumsiness of Bandinelli&#x27;s copy, or as a commentary on debates of the time around the similarities between human and ape anatomy. It has also been suggested that this woodcut was one of a number of Renaissance images that were made to reflect contemporary doubts as to the authenticity of the &quot;Laocoön Group&quot;, the &#x27;aping&#x27; of the statue referring to the incorrect pose of the Trojan priest who was depicted in ancient art in the traditional sacrificial pose, with his leg raised to subdue the bull. Over 15 drawings of the group made by Rubens in Rome have survived, and the influence of the figures can be seen in many of his major works, including his &quot;Descent from the Cross&quot; in Antwerp Cathedral.

The original was seized and taken to Paris by Napoleon Bonaparte after his conquest of Italy in 1799, and installed in a place of honour in the Musée Napoléon at the Louvre. Following the fall of Napoleon, it was returned by the Allies to the Vatican in 1816.

===&quot;Laocoön&quot; as an ideal of art===
Pliny&#x27;s description of &quot;Laocoön&quot; as &quot;a work to be preferred to all that the arts of painting and sculpture have produced&quot; has led to a tradition which debates this claim that the sculpture is the greatest of all artworks. Johann Joachim Winckelmann (1717–1768) wrote about the paradox of admiring beauty while seeing a scene of death and failure. The most influential contribution to the debate, Gotthold Ephraim Lessing&#x27;s essay &quot;Laocoon: An Essay on the Limits of Painting and Poetry&quot;, examines the differences between visual and literary art by comparing the sculpture with Virgil&#x27;s verse. He argues that the artists could not realistically depict the physical suffering of the victims, as this would be too painful. Instead, they had to express suffering while retaining beauty.

Johann Goethe said the following in his essay, &quot;Upon the Laocoon&quot; &quot;A true work of art, like a work of nature, never ceases to open boundlessly before the mind. We examine,we are impressed with it,it produces its effect; but it can never be all comprehended, still less can its essence, its value, be expressed in words.

The most unusual intervention in the debate, William Blake&#x27;s annotated print &quot;Laocoön&quot;, surrounds the image with graffiti-like commentary in several languages, written in multiple directions. Blake presents the sculpture as a mediocre copy of a lost Israelite original, describing it as &quot;Jehovah &amp; his two Sons Satan &amp; Adam as they were copied from the Cherubim Of Solomons Temple by three Rhodians &amp; applied to Natural Fact or History of Ilium&quot;. This reflects Blake&#x27;s theory that the imitation of ancient Greek and Roman art was destructive to the creative imagination, and that Classical sculpture represented a banal naturalism in contrast to Judeo-Christian spiritual art.

The central figure of &quot;Laocoön&quot; served as loose inspiration for the Indian in Horatio Greenough&#x27;s &quot;The Rescue&quot; (1837–1850), which stood before the east façade of the United States Capitol for over 100 years.

Near the end of Charles Dickens&#x27; 1843 novella, &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;, Ebenezer Scrooge self-describes &quot;making a perfect Laocoön of himself with his stockings&quot; in his hurry to dress on Christmas morning.

John Ruskin disliked the sculpture and compared its &quot;disgusting convulsions&quot; unfavourably with work by Michelangelo, whose fresco of &quot;The Brazen Serpent,&quot; on a corner pendentive of the Sistine Chapel, also involves figures struggling with snakesthe fiery serpents of the Book of Numbers. He invited contrast between the &quot;meagre lines and contemptible tortures of the Laocoon&quot; and the &quot;awfulness and quietness&quot; of Michelangelo, saying &quot;the slaughter of the Dardan priest&quot; was &quot;entirely wanting&quot; in sublimity. Furthermore, he attacked the composition on naturalistic grounds, contrasting the carefully studied human anatomy of the restored figures with the unconvincing portrayal of the snakes:

In 1910 the critic Irving Babbitt used the title &quot;The New Laokoon: An Essay on the Confusion of the Arts&quot; for an essay on contemporary culture at the beginning of the 20th century. In 1940 Clement Greenberg adapted the concept for his own essay entitled &quot;Towards a Newer Laocoön&quot; in which he argued that abstract art now provided an ideal for artists to measure their work against. A 2007 exhibition at the Henry Moore Institute in turn copied this title while exhibiting work by modern artists influenced by the sculpture.

==Findspot==

The location where the buried statue was found in 1506 was always known to be &quot;in the vineyard of Felice De Fredis&quot; on the Oppian Hill (the southern spur of the Esquiline Hill), as noted in the document recording the sale of the group to the Pope. Over time, knowledge of the site&#x27;s precise location was lost, beyond &quot;vague&quot; statements such as Sangallo&#x27;s &quot;near Santa Maria Maggiore&quot; (see above) or it being &quot;near the site of the Domus Aurea&quot; (the palace of the Emperor Nero); in modern terms near the Colosseum. An inscribed plaque of 1529 in the church of Santa Maria in Aracoeli records the burial of De Fredis and his son there, covering his finding of the group but giving no occupation. Research published in 2010 has recovered two documents in the municipal archives (badly indexed, and so missed by earlier researchers), which have established a much more precise location for the find: slightly to the east of the southern end of the Sette Sale, the ruined cistern for the successive imperial baths at the base of the hill by the Colosseum.

The first document records De Fredis&#x27; purchase of a vineyard of about 1.5 hectares from a convent for 135 ducats on 14 November 1504, exactly 14 months before the finding of the statue. The second document, from 1527, makes it clear that there is now a house on the property, and clarifies the location; by then De Fredis was dead and his widow rented out the house. The house appears on a map of 1748, and still survives as a substantial building of three storeys, in the courtyard of a convent. The area remained mainly agricultural until the 19th century, but is now entirely built up. It is speculated that De Fredis began building the house soon after his purchase, and as the group was reported to have been found some four metres below ground, at a depth unlikely to be reached by normal vineyard-digging operations, it seems likely that it was discovered when digging the foundations for the house, or possibly a well for it.

The findspot was inside and very close to the Servian Wall, which was still maintained in the 1st century AD (possibly converted to an aqueduct), though no longer the city boundary, as building had spread well beyond it. The spot was within the Gardens of Maecenas, founded by Gaius Maecenas the ally of Augustus and patron of the arts. He bequeathed the gardens to Augustus in 8 BC, and Tiberius lived there after he returned to Rome as heir to Augustus in 2 AD. Pliny said the &quot;Laocoön&quot; was in his time at the palace of Titus (&quot;qui est in Titi imperatoris domo&quot;), then heir to his father Vespasian, but the location of Titus&#x27;s residence remains unknown; the imperial estate of the Gardens of Maecenas may be a plausible candidate. If the &quot;Laocoön&quot; group was already in the location of the later findspot by the time Pliny saw it, it might have arrived there under Maecenas or any of the emperors. The extent of the grounds of Nero&#x27;s Domus Aurea is now unclear, but they do not appear to have extended so far north or east, though the newly rediscovered findspot-location is not very far beyond them.

<doc id="450548" wikidata="Q460806" url="?curid=450548" title="Hadano, Kanagawa">
<text>is a city in Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan. , the city had an estimated population of 163,787 and a population density of 1600 persons per km². The total area of the city is .

==Geography==
Hadano is located in the foothills of the Tanzawa Mountains in west-central Kanagawa Prefecture and is approximately 12.8 kilometers north-to-south by 13.6 kilometers east-to west. About half of the city area is within the borders of the Tanzawa-Ōyama Quasi-National Park.

===Surrounding municipalities===

*Atsugi
*Hiratsuka
*Kiyokawa
*Isehara
*Nakai 
*Ōi 
* Yamakita

===Climate===
Hadano has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen &quot;Cfa&quot;) characterized by warm summers and cool winters with light to no snowfall. The average annual temperature in Hadano is 13.4 °C. The average annual rainfall is 1906 mm with September as the wettest month. The temperatures are highest on average in August, at around 24.2 °C, and lowest in January, at around 2.9 °C.

==Demographics==
Per Japanese census data, the population of Hadano grew rapidly during the late 20th century and has plateaued in the 21st.

==History==
The name &quot;Hadano&quot; appears as a geographic term in the Heian period &quot;Wamyō Ruijushō&quot;, as &quot;Hatano&quot;, and there has been scholarly speculation as to possible connections with the Nara period Hata clan. From the late Heian period until the Kamakura period, the area was divided into &quot;shōen&quot; controlled by descendants of Fujiwara no Hidesato, including the Sengoku-period &quot;daimyō&quot;, the Hatano clan. During the Edo period, it was nominally part of Odawara Domain, although large portions were &quot;tenryō&quot; territory controlled by the &quot;shōgun&quot; in Edo through various &quot;hatamoto&quot;.

After the Meiji Restoration and with the establishment of the district system in 1878, the area came under the control of and became Hadano town on 1 April 1889 with the creation of the modern municipalities system. On 26 March 1896, Ōsumi District and Yurugi District were merged to form Naka District. The town began to experience rapid growth after the opening of the Odakyu Electric Railway in 1927. Hadano became a city on 1 January 1955, through the merger of former towns of Hadano and Minamihadano with the villages of Kitahadano and Higashihadano. The new city annexed neighboring the village of One, and the village of Kamihatano (from Ashigarakami District) later the same year, and annexed the town of Nishihadano in 1964.

==Government==
Hadano has a mayor-council form of government with a directly elected mayor and a unicameral city council of 24 members. Hadano contributes two members to the Kanagawa Prefectural Assembly. In terms of national politics, the city is part of Kanagawa 17th district of the lower house of the Diet of Japan.

==Economy==
Hadano was a regional commercial center during the Edo period following the introduction of tobacco cultivation to the area. The curtains closed on the industry&#x27;s 300-year history in 1984, and the local farmers have largely converted to production of green tea and ornamental flowers. A former tobacco-trading center and processing plant belonging to Japan Tobacco and Salt Public Corporation (now Japan Tobacco) has been replaced by a large shopping mall.

==Education==
Hadano has 13 public elementary schools and nine public middle schools operated by the city government. The city has three public high schools operated by the Kanagawa Prefectural Board of Education, and the prefecture also operates one special education school for the handicapped. A private junior college, the Sophia Junior College is located within Hadano.

<doc id="450552" wikidata="Q480310" url="?curid=450552" title="Window tax">
<text>Window tax was a property tax based on the number of windows in a house. It was a significant social, cultural, and architectural force in England, Scotland, France and Ireland during the 18th and 19th centuries. To avoid the tax, some houses from the period can be seen to have bricked-up window-spaces (which can be (re)glazed later). In England and Wales it was introduced in 1696 and in Scotland from 1748. It was repealed in both cases in 1851. In France it was established in 1798 and was repealed in 1926.

==History==
The tax was introduced in England and Wales in 1696 under King William III and was designed to impose tax relative to the prosperity of the taxpayer, but without the controversy that then surrounded the idea of income tax.

At that time, many people in Britain opposed income tax, on principle, because the disclosure of personal income was perceived by them to represent an unacceptable governmental intrusion into private matters, and a potential threat to personal liberty. The first permanent British income tax was not introduced until 1842, and the tax remained controversial into the 20th century.

When the window tax was introduced, it consisted of two parts: a flat-rate house tax of two shillings per house (equivalent to £ in ), and a variable tax for the number of windows above ten in the house. Properties with between ten and twenty windows paid an extra four shillings (equivalent to £ in ), and those above twenty windows paid an extra eight shillings (equivalent to £ in ).

In 1709, with the union of England and Scotland, taxes were harmonised and a new top rate of 20s total was introduced for houses with 30 or more windows. In 1747 the 2s flat rate was detached from the window tax as a tax in its own right and the way the window tax was calculated was altered. 6d was charged for each window in a house with 10–14, 9d for each window in a house with 15–19, 1s for every window in a house with 20 or more. In 1758 the flat rate charge was increased to 3s. The number of windows that incurred tax was changed to seven in 1766 and eight in 1825.

The flat-rate tax was changed to a variable rate, dependent on the property value, in 1778. People who were exempt from paying church or poor rates, for reasons of poverty, were exempt from the window tax. Window tax was relatively unintrusive and easy to assess. Manchester Royal Infirmary had to pay a tax of 1/9d per window on the windows of the rooms occupied by staff of the infirmary in 1841—a total of £1 9/9d. Certain rooms, particularly dairies, cheese rooms and milkhouses, were exempt providing they were clearly labelled, and it is not uncommon to find the name of such rooms carved on the lintel. The bigger the house, the more windows it was likely to have, and the more tax the occupants would pay. Nevertheless, the tax was unpopular, because it was seen by some as a tax on &quot;light and air&quot;.

In &quot;The Wealth of Nations&quot;, Adam Smith briefly discussed the window tax as one case among various forms of taxation. Smith observed that the tax was relatively inoffensive because its assessment did not require the assessor to enter the residence—a building&#x27;s windows could be counted from the outside. On the other hand, Smith reported that others objected to the tax on the grounds of its inequality, since it was thought to have a disproportionate impact on the poor. Smith himself observed that the tax&#x27;s effect was to lower rent.

In Scotland, a window tax was imposed after 1748. A house had to have at least seven windows or a rent of at least £5 to be taxed. Windows that have been filled with masonry may have no connection to taxation, but reflect the location of staircases, fireplaces or for purposes of maintaining the symmetry of a building facade.

In Ireland, the tax was introduced in 1799 and was not repealed until 1851. Similarly, a glass tax was introduced in 1825 and remained in place until 1845.

A similar tax also existed in France from 1798 to 1926.

There was a strong agitation in England in favour of the abolition of the tax during the winter of 1850–51, and it was accordingly repealed on 24 July 1851, and a tax on inhabited houses substituted. The Scottish and Irish window taxes were abolished at the same time.

The saying &quot;daylight robbery&quot; is popularly believed to originate with the window tax, but there appears to be no scholarly support for this. Another associated idea is that the tax inspired Europeans to begin using bricked-up windows, although this is most likely untrue, as blind windows were used for aesthetic purposes since at least the medieval period, such as on the Church of Saint John the Baptist, Kerch, Crimea, built in 757 AD. Windows &quot;were&quot; also bricked up in Europe from the 1600s to avoid taxes.

<doc id="450555" wikidata="Q1999258" url="?curid=450555" title="Field norm">
<text>In mathematics, the (field) norm is a particular mapping defined in field theory, which maps elements of a larger field into a subfield.

==Formal definition==
Let &quot;K&quot; be a field and &quot;L&quot; a finite extension (and hence an algebraic extension) of &quot;K&quot;.

The field &quot;L&quot; is then a finite-dimensional vector space over &quot;K&quot;.

Multiplication by &quot;α&quot;, an element of &quot;L&quot;,
:formula_1
:formula_2,
is a &quot;K&quot;-linear transformation of this vector space into itself.

The norm, N&quot;L&quot;/&quot;K&quot;(&quot;α&quot;), is defined as the determinant of this linear transformation.

If &quot;L&quot;/&quot;K&quot; is a Galois extension, one may compute the norm of &quot;α&quot; ∈ &quot;L&quot; as the product of all the Galois conjugates of &quot;α&quot;:

:formula_3

where Gal(&quot;L&quot;/&quot;K&quot;) denotes the Galois group of &quot;L&quot;/&quot;K&quot;. (Note that there may be a repetition in the terms of the product.)

For a general field extension &quot;L&quot;/&quot;K&quot;, and nonzero &quot;α&quot; in &quot;L&quot;, let &quot;σ&quot;(&quot;α&quot;), ..., σ(&quot;α&quot;) be the roots of the minimal polynomial of &quot;α&quot; over &quot;K&quot; (roots listed with multiplicity and lying in some extension field of &quot;L&quot;); then
:formula_4.

If &quot;L&quot;/&quot;K&quot; is separable, then each root appears only once in the product (though the exponent, the degree [&quot;L&quot;:&quot;K&quot;(&quot;α&quot;)], may still be greater than 1).

==Examples==

=== Quadratic field extensions ===
One of the basic examples of norms comes from quadratic field extensions formula_5 where formula_6 is a square-free integer.

Then, the multiplication map by formula_7 on an element formula_8 is
:formula_9
The element formula_8 can be represented by the vector
:formula_11
since there is a direct sum decomposition formula_12 as a formula_13-vector space.

The matrix of formula_14 is then
:formula_15
and the norm is formula_16, since it is the determinant of this matrix.

==== Norm of Q(√2) ====

Consider the number field formula_17.

The Galois group of formula_18 over formula_13 has order formula_20 and is generated by the element which sends formula_21 to formula_22. So the norm of formula_23 is:

:formula_24

The field norm can also be obtained without the Galois group.

Fix a formula_13-basis of formula_26, say:
:formula_27.

Then multiplication by the number formula_23 sends
:1 to formula_23 and
:formula_21 to formula_31.

So the determinant of &quot;multiplying by formula_23&quot; is the determinant of the matrix which sends the vector
:formula_33 (corresponding to the first basis element, i.e., 1) to formula_34,
:formula_35 (corresponding to the second basis element, i.e., formula_21) to formula_37,
viz.:

:formula_38

The determinant of this matrix is −1.

=== &quot;p&quot;-th root field extensions ===
Another easy class of examples comes from field extensions of the form formula_39 where the prime factorization of formula_40 contains no formula_41-th powers, for formula_41 a fixed odd prime.

The multiplication map by formula_43 of an element isformula_44giving the matrixformula_45The determinant gives the norm
:formula_46

=== Complex numbers over the reals ===
The field norm from the complex numbers to the real numbers sends

to

because the Galois group of formula_47 over formula_48 has two elements,
* the identity element and
* complex conjugation,
and taking the product yields .

=== Finite fields ===
Let &quot;L&quot; = GF(&quot;q&quot;&quot;n&quot;) be a finite extension of a finite field &quot;K&quot; = GF(&quot;q&quot;).

Since &quot;L&quot;/&quot;K&quot; is a Galois extension, if &quot;α&quot; is in &quot;L&quot;, then the norm of &quot;α&quot; is the product of all the Galois conjugates of &quot;α&quot;, i.e.

: formula_49

In this setting we have the additional properties,

*formula_50
*formula_51

==Properties of the norm==
Several properties of the norm function hold for any finite extension.

=== Group homomorphism ===
The norm N : &quot;L&quot;* → &quot;K&quot;* is a group homomorphism from the multiplicative group of &quot;L&quot; to the multiplicative group of &quot;K&quot;, that is
:formula_52
Furthermore, if &quot;a&quot; in &quot;K&quot;:
:formula_53

If &quot;a&quot; ∈ &quot;K&quot; then formula_54

=== Composition with field extensions ===
Additionally, the norm behaves well in towers of fields:

if &quot;M&quot; is a finite extension of &quot;L&quot;, then the norm from &quot;M&quot; to &quot;K&quot; is just the composition of the norm from &quot;M&quot; to &quot;L&quot; with the norm from &quot;L&quot; to &quot;K&quot;, i.e.
:formula_55

=== Reduction of the norm ===
The norm of an element in an arbitrary field extension can be reduced to an easier computation if the degree of the field extension is already known. This isformula_56For example, for formula_57 in the field extension formula_58, the norm of formula_59 isformula_60since the degree of the field extension formula_61 is formula_62.

=== Detection of units ===
For formula_63 the ring of integers of an algebraic number field formula_18, an element formula_65 is a unit if and only if formula_66.

For instance
:formula_67
where
:formula_68.

Thus, any number field formula_18 whose ring of integers formula_63 contains formula_71 has it as a unit.

==Further properties==
The norm of an algebraic integer is again an integer, because it is equal (up to sign) to the constant term of the characteristic polynomial.

In algebraic number theory one defines also norms for ideals. This is done in such a way that if &quot;I&quot; is a nonzero ideal of &quot;O&quot;&quot;K&quot;, the ring of integers of the number field &quot;K&quot;, N(&quot;I&quot;) is the number of residue classes in formula_72 – i.e. the cardinality of this finite ring. Hence this ideal norm is always a positive integer.

When &quot;I&quot; is a principal ideal &quot;αOK&quot; then N(&quot;I&quot;) is equal to the absolute value of the norm to &quot;Q&quot; of &quot;α&quot;, for &quot;α&quot; an algebraic integer.

<doc id="450559" wikidata="Q1140617" url="?curid=450559" title="Minato Mirai 21">
<text>, often known as simply Minato Mirai and abbreviated as MM, is the central business district of Yokohama, Japan. Initially developed in the 1980s, Minato Mirai 21 was designed as a large master-planned development and new urban center planned to connect Yokohama&#x27;s traditionally important areas and commercial centers of Kannai and the Yokohama Station area.


Today, Minato Mirai is a major center for business, shopping, and tourism, attracting visitors and businesspersons throughout the Greater Tokyo Area. The business district is host to several major hotels, office towers including the Yokohama Landmark Tower, the Pacifico Yokohama convention center, art museums, and numerous cafés and shops in shopping centers and along its central pedestrian mall. The area continues to be developed as originally envisioned in the 1980s.

==Overview==
Minato Mirai 21 was originally proposed as one of Yokohama&#x27;s six major development plans by the mayor of Yokohama, Ichio Asukata, in 1965. After several assessments and review sessions, actual construction started in 1983. The area where it is located was once known as Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Yokohama shipyard and the Japanese National Railways classification yard, Takashima wharf and Shinko wharf of Port of Yokohama. Conducted as an urban renewal and reclaimed land project, the port and industrial areas once divided the two city centers of Kannai and the Yokohama Station area. With the development of Minato Mirai 21, the two city centers were linked and now form part of the business and central &#x27;core&#x27; of Yokohama. The name &quot;Minato Mirai 21&quot; was selected by a public opinion poll. Translated literally as &quot;Port Future 21&quot;, it means &quot;Port of the Future in the 21st century&quot;.

The area is now flourishing as one of the newest urban business districts in the Greater Tokyo Metropolitan area, symbolized by Landmark Tower, Japan&#x27;s third tallest skyscraper, the three Queens Square Towers, which contain a large shopping mall, the Pacifico Yokohama convention center, the Intercontinental Hotel, the Cosmo Clock 21 Ferris wheel, and more. Next to Landmark Tower is the Yokohama Museum of Art.

The area is an important business center, with Nissan Motors, JGC Corporation, Chiyoda Corporation and other major corporations locating their headquarters and branches in the Minato Mirai area. Today, about 79,000 people work in Minato Mirai 21.

Minato Mirai 21 also attracts numerous tourists along with the nearby Yokohama Chinatown. In 2010, it received approximately 58 million visitors. Due to the beautiful view, bay proximity, cruise ships docked at Ōsanbashi Pier, skyscrapers, and the graceful Yokohama Bay Bridge, Minato Mirai 21 has become a symbol of Yokohama and its skyline, and is frequently featured in images of the city.

==Attractions==
Major attractions in the area include:

<doc id="450573" wikidata="Q7844662" url="?curid=450573" title="Trivial representation">
<text>In the mathematical field of representation theory, a trivial representation is a representation of a group &quot;G&quot; on which all elements of &quot;G&quot; act as the identity mapping of &quot;V&quot;. A trivial representation of an associative or Lie algebra is a (Lie) algebra representation for which all elements of the algebra act as the zero linear map (endomorphism) which sends every element of &quot;V&quot; to the zero vector.

For any group or Lie algebra, an irreducible trivial representation always exists over any field, and is one-dimensional, hence unique up to isomorphism. The same is true for associative algebras unless one restricts attention to unital algebras and unital representations.

Although the trivial representation is constructed in such a way as to make its properties seem tautologous, it is a fundamental object of the theory. A subrepresentation is equivalent to a trivial representation, for example, if it consists of invariant vectors; so that searching for such subrepresentations is the whole topic of invariant theory.

The trivial character is the character that takes the value of one for all group elements.

<text>KINY (800 AM) is a radio station licensed to Juneau, Alaska, serving southeast Alaska. Owned by Local First Media Group, it broadcasts a classic hits format.

==History==
KINY began broadcasting on May 31, 1935, at 7:30p.m. It was located in the Goldstein Building until 1939, when the building was destroyed by fire on February 8, 1939. The Decker Building in downtown Juneau then served as KINY&#x27;s headquarters for decades. The station moved into the building on October 28, 1940. The Decker Building burned down in June 1984.

KINY and its sister station KSUP were bought by Alaska Broadcast Communications in June 2008.

In October 2022, KINY, sister stations KSUP and KXXJ, and eight translators were sold to Bryan Woodruff , Ted Ellis and Cliff Dumas of Local First Media Group for $1.3 million. After the sale, the station began to back away from its previous full service positioning in 2024, with Dumas stating that he wanted the station to have a &quot;stronger musical identity&quot;. This resulted in the cancellation of its long-running call-in show &quot;Problem Corner&quot; (which was converted to a podcast), and the layoffs of its two full-time news reporters in May 2024. Most of the station&#x27;s online news content now consisted primarily of wire stories, press releases, and articles created with generative AI.

==Programming==
*&quot;News of the North&quot; - news about Alaska.
*&quot;Capital Chat&quot;, a local-events show for the Juneau, Alaska area hosted by Steve Holloway.
*&quot;Problem Corner&quot;, a tradio program hosted by Wade Bryson. Until its cancellation in February 2024 after a roughly 70-year run, it was Alaska&#x27;s longest-running radio show.

Notable regular syndicated broadcasts include:
*&quot;The Mike Harvey Show&quot;, a syndicated requested oldies show hosted by Mike Harvey.
*&quot;Super Gold&quot;, hosted by Mike Harvey.
*&quot;American Top 40 with Casey Kasem&quot;.

KINY carries news from ABC News Radio and live sports from the Seattle Mariners and the Seattle Seahawks.

==Translators==
In addition to the main station, KINY has an additional five translators to widen its broadcast area.

<text>The Minatomirai 21 Line (みなとみらい21線 &quot;Minato-mirai-21-sen&quot;), commonly known as the Minatomirai Line (みなとみらい線 &quot;Minatomirai-sen&quot;), is a subway line in Yokohama, Japan that runs from Yokohama Station to Motomachi-Chūkagai Station through the Minatomirai 21 business district. The line opened in 2004 and is operated by the Yokohama Minatomirai Railway Company.

Maps and station numbering use navy blue and the route symbol MM to identify the line. The entire line is underground and goes under the Minato Mirai and Kannai districts, as well as numerous islands made of soft reclaimed land and channels, requiring stations to be constructed deep underground. The original above-ground section of the Tōkyū Tōyoko Line between Yokohama and Sakuragichō stations was abandoned and replaced with a new underground connector line to allow through services onto the newly completed Minatomirai Line.

== Operations ==
All trains run from Yokohama Station to Motomachi-Chūkagai Station and vice versa, with no trains stopping and changing direction at any station in between.

===Staffing/Operational management===
Operations are managed by Tokyu Railways, with no changing of staff at Yokohama Station; Tokyu staff (train drivers and conductors) continue to support the train over the Minatomirai portion of the line as well.
Station-side staffing is provided by Minatomirai employees with the exception of Yokohama Station, which is managed by Tokyu Railways. Many Minatomirai employees are former employees of Tokyu Railways.
Train management is controlled by Yokohama Minatomirai Railway Company at an operational command center. Railway facilities are maintained by Yokohama Minatomirai Railway, but the actual maintenance work is contracted to Tokyu Railways employees.
Because Yokohama Minatomirai Railway does not own its own rail yard, trains are parked overnight at Tokyu Railways&#x27; Motosumiyoshi Rail Yard and at Motomachi-Chūkagai Station. There are plans to construct a portion of track for parking additional trains underneath Harbor View Park starting in 2020.

=== Through services with the Tōkyū Tōyoko Line ===
The Minatomirai Line is essentially an extension of the Tōkyū Tōyoko Line. The two lines operate as one, with no crew change at Yokohama station where trains cross between the two lines, in contrast to standard procedure with other line operators in Japan.

=== Through services with Tokyo Metro Fukutoshin Line ===
With the completion of the underground link line to the Tokyo Metro Fukutoshin Line on March 16, 2013, Minatomirai Line trains run onto the Fukutoshin Line via the Tōkyū Tōyoko Line and beyond to the Tōbu Tōjō Line, Seibu Yūrakuchō Line, and Seibu Ikebukuro Line.
Along with the link to the Fukutoshin Line being established, Tōkyū Tōyoko and Minatomirai express trains (limited express/commuter limited express/express) were expanded from eight-car to ten-car configuration (with the exception of a portion of regular express trains). Platforms were extended at Minatomirai stations receiving express trains in order to be able to accommodate the extended ten-car configuration. Regular trains stopping at each station on the line continue to operate in the eight-car configuration.

===Train services===

All regular trains on the Minatomirai Line use the same services as the Tōyoko Line.

==== S-train ====

The S-train is the first service on the Minatomirai Line with fully reserved seating. On weekends and holidays it makes two and a half round trips (to Motomachi-Chūkagai Station twice and from the same station three times). All trains continue to the Seibu Ikebukuro Line, and one round trip begins and ends at the Seibu Chichibu Line&#x27;s Seibu-Chichibu Station.
Within the Minatomirai Line, these trains stop at Minatomirai Station and Motomachi-Chūkagai Station, but tickets are not sold for final destinations at these stations.
S-train services use the Seibu 40000 series train exclusively.

==== Limited express ====
 trains run during daylight hours during the week and at all times excepting early morning and late night on weekends and holidays. The trains use 10 cars. Limited express trains stop at Yokohama Station, Minatomirai Station, and Motomachi-Chūkagai Station within the Minatomirai Line.

==== Commuter Limited Express ====
 operate during the morning rush hour and in the evening on weekdays. The trains use 10 cars and stop at all stations on the Minatomirai Line with the exception of Shin-Takashima Station. Many trains continue to the Fukutoshin Line via the Tōyoko Line as Commuter Express services.

==== Express ====
 operate all day long. The trains stop at all stations on the Minatomirai Line with the exception of Shin-Takashima Station. Daytime trains use 8 cars, but 10 cars may be used during peak hours in the morning and evening.

==== Local ====
 trains stop at all stations. Eight cars are used to align with the Tōkyū, Yokohama, and Tokyo Metro lines.

== Female-only car ==

In conjunction with the Tokyu Tōyoko Line, the Tokyo Metro Fukutoshin Line, the Seibu Ikebukuro Line, and the Tōbu Tōjō Line, the first car is a female-only car during certain times of the day to prevent sexual harassment.

<text>The Hellschreiber, Feldhellschreiber or Typenbildfeldfernschreiber (also Hell-Schreiber named after its inventor Rudolf Hell) is a facsimile-based teleprinter invented by Rudolf Hell. Compared to contemporary teleprinters that were based on typewriter systems and were mechanically complex and expensive, the Hellschreiber was much simpler and more robust, with far fewer moving parts. It has the added advantage of being capable of providing intelligible communication even over very poor quality radio or cable links, where voice or other teledata would be unintelligible.

The device was first developed in the late 1920s, and saw use starting in the 1930s, chiefly being used for landline press services. During World War II it was sometimes used by the German military in conjunction with the Enigma encryption system. In the post-war era, it became increasingly common among newswire services, and was used in this role well into the 1980s. Today, the Hellschreiber is used as a means of communication by amateur radio operators using computers and sound cards; the resulting mode is referred to as Hellschreiber, Feld-Hell, or simply Hell.

==Operation==

Hellschreiber sends a line of text as a series of vertical columns. Each column is broken down vertically into a series of pixels, normally using a 7 by 7 pixel grid to represent characters. The data for a line is then sent as a series of on-off signals to the receiver, using a variety of formats depending on the medium, but normally at a rate of 112.5 baud.

At the receiver end, a paper tape is fed at a constant speed over a roller. Located above the roller is a spinning cylinder with small bumps in a helical pattern on the surface. The received signal is amplified and sent to a magnetic actuator that pulls the cylinder down onto the roller, hammering out a dot into the surface of the paper. A Hellschreiber will print each received column twice, one below the other. This is to compensate for slight timing errors that are often present in the equipment, and causes the text to slant. The received text can look like two identical texts coming out one below the other, or a line of text coming out in the middle, with chopped-off lines above and below. In either case, at least one whole letter can be read at all times.

The original Hellschreiber machine was a mechanical device, so therefore it was possible to send &quot;half-pixels&quot;. The right ends of the loops in B, for instance, could be shifted a little, so as to improve the readability. Any on-signal could in any case last no shorter than 8 ms, however, both because of having to restrict the occupied bandwidth on the radio, but also for reasons having to do with the mechanical makeup of the receiving machinery.

Improvements that came as a result of software implementation:

* Depicting the received signal as shades of gray instead of monochrome, thereby making it much easier to read weak signals.
* Changing to a different font. Here is one mode that is truly international and independent of character sets: any thing that can be depicted as markings within a 7 pixels high grid, can be transmitted over the air.

==Variants==

Hellschreiber has also spawned a number of variants over the years, many of them due to radio amateur efforts in the 1990s. Examples of them are:

* PSK Hell encodes a pixel&#x27;s brightness in the carrier phase instead of the amplitude. Strictly speaking, it&#x27;s encoded in the &quot;change&quot; of the phase (differential phase shift keying): an unchanged phase in the beginning of a pixel means white, and a reversed phase means black. It operates at 105 or 245 baud.
* FM Hell (or FSK Hell) uses frequency modulation with a careful control of phase, essentially minimum-shift keying. The most common variant is FSK Hell-105.
* Duplo Hell is a dual tone mode which sends two columns at a time at different frequencies (980 Hz and 1225/1470 Hz).
* C/MT Hell or concurrent multitone Hell sends all rows at the same time using tones at different frequencies. The transmission can be read using an FFT display or a waterfall plot. It allows for high resolutions.
* S/MT Hell or sequential multitone Hell is like C/MT but it sends only one tone (for one row) at a time. As a result, characters received have a bit of slant, they look like an oblique font.

===Slowfeld===
Slowfeld is an experimental narrow band communication program that makes use of the Hellschreiber principle requiring that the transmitter and receiver both use the same column-scan speed. Data is sent at a very slow rate and received via a Fast Fourier Transform routine giving a bandwidth of several Hz. As long as tuning is within several signal bandwidths, the result will appear. The transmission rate is around 3, 1.5 and 0.75 characters per second. Slowfeld, along with similar modes such as very slow QRSS Morse code, may be used when all other communication methods fail.

<doc id="450589" wikidata="Q470850" url="?curid=450589" title="Goatfish">
<text>The goatfishes are ray-finned fish of the family Mullidae, the only family in the suborder Mulloidei of the order Syngnathiformes. The family is also sometimes referred to as the red mullets, which also refers more narrowly to the genus &quot;Mullus&quot;.

The family name and the English common name mullet derived from Latin &quot;mullus&quot;, the red mullet; other than the red mullet and the striped red mullet or surmullet, the English word &quot;mullet&quot; generally refers to a different family of fish, the Mugilidae or gray mullets.

==Description==
Goatfish are characterized by two chin barbels (or goatee), which contain chemosensory organs and are used to probe the sand or holes in the reef for food. Their bodies are deep and elongated, with forked tails and widely separated dorsal fins. The first dorsal fin has six to eight spines; the second dorsal has one spine and 8–9 soft rays, shorter than anal fin. There are one or two spines in the anal fin with five to eight soft rays. They have 24 vertebrae.

Many goatfish are brightly colored. The largest species, the dash-and-dot goatfish (&quot;Parupeneus barberinus&quot;), grows to in length; most species are less than half this size. 
Within the family are six genera and about 86 species.

==Genera==
These genera are classified as belonging to the Mullidae:

* &quot;Mulloidichthys&quot; Whitley, 1929
* &quot;Mullus&quot; Linnaeus, 1758
* &quot;Parupeneus&quot; Bleeker, 1863
* &quot;Pseudupeneus&quot; Bleeker, 1862
* &quot;Upeneichthys&quot; Bleeker, 1853
* &quot;Upeneus&quot; Cuvier, 1829

==Distribution and habitat==
Goatfish are distributed worldwide in tropical, subtropical, and temperate waters, in a range of habitats. Most species are associated with the bottom of the littoral, but some species of &quot;Upeneus&quot; can be deep; for example, the goatfish &quot;Upeneus davidaromi&quot; can be found at depths of . Tropical goatfish live in association with coral reefs. Some species, such as the freckled goatfish (&quot;Upeneus tragula&quot;), enter estuaries and rivers, although not to any great extent.

==Ecology==
Goatfish are benthic feeders, using a pair of long chemosensory barbels (whiskers) protruding from their chins to feel through the sediments in search of prey. They feed on worms, crustaceans, molluscs and other small invertebrates. Other fish shadow the active goatfish, waiting patiently for any overlooked prey. For example, in Indonesia large schools of the goldsaddle goatfish (&quot;Parupeneus cyclostomus&quot;) and moray eels hunt together. This behavior is known as shadow feeding or cooperative hunting.
By day, many goatfish will form large schools of inactive (nonfeeding) fish; these aggregates may contain both conspecifics and heterospecifics. For example, the yellowfin goatfish (&quot;Mulloidichthys vanicolensis&quot;) is often seen congregating with bluestripe snappers (&quot;Lutjanus kasmira&quot;). 
All goatfish have the ability to change their coloration depending on their current activity. One notable example, the diurnal goldsaddle goatfish (&quot;Parupeneus cyclostomus&quot;) can change from a lemon-yellow to a pale cream whilst feeding.

==Mimicry==
Goatfish have the ability to rapidly change color, and many species adopt a pale coloration when resting on the sand to blend with the background and become less visible to predators. These changes in color are reversible phenotypic changes and happen within seconds, many times during the lifespan of an individual.

Two species, the mimic goatfish (&quot;Mulloidichthys mimicus&quot;) and Ayliffe&#x27;s goatfish (&quot;Mulloidichthys ayliffe&quot;) have evolved to mimic the blue-striped snapper (&quot;Lutjanus kasmira&quot;), with which they often form schools. These are slow, genetic changes that have occurred during their evolution over many generations.

==Reproduction and life cycle==
Goatfish are pelagic spawners; they release many buoyant eggs into the water, which become part of the plankton. The eggs float freely with the currents until hatching.
The larvae drift in oceanic waters or in the outer shelf for a period of 4–8 weeks until they metamorphose and develop barbels. Soon thereafter, most species take on a bottom-feeding lifestyle, although other species remain in the open water as juveniles or feed on plankton.
Juvenile goatfish often prefer soft bottoms, in seagrass beds to mangroves. They change habitat preference as they develop, coinciding with changes in feeding habits, social behavior, and the formation of association with other species. Most species reach reproductive maturity after 1–2 years.

==Economic importance==
Goatfish species are an important fishery in many areas of the world and some species are economically important. 
In ancient Rome until the end of the second century BCE, two species of goatfish (&quot;Mullus barbatus&quot; and &quot;Mullus surmuletus&quot;) were highly sought-after and expensive, not as a delicacy, but for aesthetic pleasure, since the fish assume a variety of colors and shades also during death. Therefore, it was paramount to serve the fish live and let them die before the eyes of the guests.

<doc id="450590" wikidata="Q117693" url="?curid=450590" title="Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima">
<text>is an iconic photograph of six United States Marines raising the U.S. flag atop Mount Suribachi during the Battle of Iwo Jima in the final stages of the Pacific War. Taken by Joe Rosenthal of the Associated Press on February 23, 1945, the photograph was published in Sunday newspapers two days later and reprinted in thousands of publications. It won the 1945 Pulitzer Prize for Photography and has come to be regarded in the United States as one of the most recognizable images of World War II. 

The flag raising occurred in the early afternoon, after the mountaintop was captured and a smaller flag was raised on top that morning. Three of the six Marines in the photograph—Sergeant Michael Strank, Corporal Harlon Block, and Private First Class Franklin Sousley—would be killed in action during the battle; Block was identified as Sergeant Hank Hansen until January 1947 and Sousley was identified as PhM2c. John Bradley, USN, until June 2016. The other three Marines in the photograph were Corporals (then Privates First Class) Ira Hayes, Harold Schultz, and Harold Keller; Schultz was identified as Sousley until June 2016 and Keller was identified as Rene Gagnon until October 2019. All of the men served in the 5th Marine Division on Iwo Jima.

The photograph was the model for the Marine Corps War Memorial, dedicated in 1954 to honor all U.S. Marines who died in service since 1775. The memorial, sculpted by Felix de Weldon, is located in Arlington Ridge Park, near the Ord-Weitzel Gate to Arlington National Cemetery and the Netherlands Carillon.

== Background ==
On February 19, 1945, the United States invaded Iwo Jima as part of its island-hopping strategy to defeat Japan. Iwo Jima originally was not a target, but the relatively quick liberation of the Philippines left the Americans with a longer-than-expected lull prior to the planned invasion of Okinawa. Iwo Jima is located halfway between Japan and the Mariana Islands, where American long-range bombers were based, and was used by the Japanese as an early warning station, radioing warnings of incoming American bombers to the Japanese homeland. The Americans, after capturing the island, weakened the Japanese early warning system, and used it as an emergency landing strip for damaged bombers.

Iwo Jima is a volcanic island, shaped like a trapezoid. From the air, it looks like a &quot;lopsided, black porkchop&quot;. The island was heavily fortified, and the invading Marines suffered high casualties. Politically, the island is part of the prefecture of Tokyo. It would be the first Japanese homeland soil to be captured by the Americans, and it was a matter of honor for the Japanese to prevent its capture.

The island is dominated by Mount Suribachi, a dormant volcanic cone at the southern tip of the island. Tactically, the top of Suribachi was one of the most important locations on the island. From that vantage point, the Japanese defenders were able to spot artillery accurately onto the Americans—particularly the landing beaches. The Japanese fought most of the battle from underground bunkers and pillboxes. It was common for Marines to disable a pillbox using grenades or flamethrowers, only to come under renewed fire from it a few minutes later, after replacement Japanese infantry arrived into the pillbox through a tunnel. The American effort concentrated on isolating and capturing Suribachi first, a goal that was achieved on February 23, four days after the battle began. Despite capturing Suribachi, the battle continued to rage for many days, and the island would not be declared &quot;secure&quot; until 31 days later, on March 26, 1945.

== Two flag-raisings ==
There were two American flags raised on top of Mount Suribachi, on February 23, 1945. The photograph Rosenthal took was actually of the second flag-raising, in which a larger replacement flag was raised by different Marines than those who raised the first flag.

=== Raising the first flag ===
A U.S. flag was first raised atop Mount Suribachi soon after the mountaintop was captured at around 10:30 a.m. on February 23, 1945.

Lieutenant Colonel Chandler W. Johnson, commander of the 2nd Battalion, 28th Marine Regiment, 5th Marine Division, ordered Marine Captain Dave Severance, commander of Easy Company, 2nd Battalion, 28th Marines, to send a platoon to seize and occupy the crest of Mount Suribachi. First Lieutenant Harold G. Schrier, executive officer of Easy Company, who had replaced the wounded Third Platoon commander, John Keith Wells, volunteered to lead a 40-man combat patrol up the mountain. Lieutenant Colonel Johnson (or 1st Lieutenant George G. Wells, the battalion adjutant, whose job it was to carry the flag) had taken the flag from the battalion&#x27;s transport ship, , and handed the flag to Schrier. Johnson said to Schrier, &quot;If you get to the top, put it up.&quot; Schrier assembled the patrol at 8 a.m. to begin the climb up the mountain.

Despite the large numbers of Japanese troops in the vicinity, Schrier&#x27;s patrol made it to the rim of the crater at about 10:15 a.m., having come under little or no enemy fire, as the Japanese were being bombarded at the time. The flag was attached by Schrier and two Marines to a Japanese iron water pipe found on top, and the flagstaff was raised and planted by Schrier, assisted by Platoon Sergeant Ernest Thomas and Sergeant Oliver Hansen (the platoon guide) at about 10:30 a.m. (On February 25, during a CBS press interview aboard the flagship about the flag-raising, Thomas stated that he, Schrier, and Hansen had actually raised the flag.) The raising of the national colors immediately caused a loud cheering reaction from the Marines, sailors, and coast guardsmen on the beach below and from the men on the ships near the beach. The loud noise made by the servicemen and blasts of the ship horns alerted the Japanese, who up to this point had stayed in their cave bunkers. Schrier and his men near the flagstaff then came under fire from Japanese troops, but the Marines quickly eliminated the threat. Schrier was later awarded the Navy Cross for volunteering to take the patrol up Mount Suribachi and raising the American flag, and a Silver Star Medal for a heroic action in March while in command of D Company, 2/28 Marines on Iwo Jima.

Photographs of the first flag flown on Mount Suribachi were taken by Staff Sergeant Louis R. Lowery of &quot;Leatherneck&quot; magazine, who accompanied the patrol up the mountain, and other photographers afterwards. Others involved with the first flag-raising include Corporal Charles W. Lindberg (who also helped raise the flag), Privates First Class James Michels, Harold Schultz, Raymond Jacobs (F Company radioman), Private Phil Ward, and Navy corpsman John Bradley. This flag was too small, however, to be easily seen from the northern side of Mount Suribachi, where heavy fighting would go on for several more days.


=== Raising the second flag ===
The photograph taken by Rosenthal was the second flag-raising on top of Mount Suribachi, on February 23, 1945.
On orders from Colonel Chandler Johnson—passed on by Easy Company&#x27;s commander, Captain Dave Severance—Sergeant Michael Strank, one of Second Platoon&#x27;s squad leaders, was to take three members of his rifle squad (Corporal Harlon H. Block and Privates First Class Franklin R. Sousley and Ira H. Hayes) and climb up Mount Suribachi to raise a replacement flag on top; the three took supplies or laid telephone wire on the way to the top. Severance also dispatched Private First Class Rene A. Gagnon, the battalion runner (messenger) for Easy Company, to the command post for fresh SCR-300 walkie-talkie batteries to be taken to the top.

Meanwhile, Lieutenant Albert Theodore Tuttle under Johnson&#x27;s orders, had found a large (96-by-56–inch) flag in nearby Tank Landing Ship USS &quot;LST-779&quot;. He made his way back to the command post and gave it to Johnson. Johnson, in turn, gave it to Rene Gagnon, with orders to take it up to Schrier on Mount Suribachi and raise it. The official Marine Corps history of the event is that Tuttle received the flag from Navy Ensign Alan Wood of USS &quot;LST-779&quot;, who in turn had received the flag from a supply depot in Pearl Harbor. Severance had confirmed that the second larger flag was in fact provided by Alan Wood even though Wood could not recognize any of the pictures of the second flag&#x27;s raisers as Gagnon. The flag was sewn by Mabel Sauvageau, a worker at the &quot;flag loft&quot; of the Mare Island Naval Shipyard.
First Lieutenant Greeley Wells, who had been the Second Battalion, 28th Marines adjutant officially in charge of the two American flags flown on Mount Suribachi, stated in &quot;The New York Times&quot; in 1991 that Lieutenant Colonel Johnson ordered Wells to get the second flag, and that Wells sent Rene Gagnon, his battalion runner, to the ships on shore for the flag. Wells said that Gagnon returned with a flag and gave it to him, and that Gagnon took this flag up Mt. Suribachi with a message for Schrier to raise it and send the other flag down with Gagnon. Wells stated that he received the first flag back from Gagnon and secured it at the Marine headquarters command post. Wells also stated that he had handed the first flag to Lieutenant Schrier to take up Mount Suribachi.

The Coast Guard Historian&#x27;s Office recognizes the claims made by former U.S. Coast Guardsman Quartermaster Robert Resnick, who served aboard the at Iwo Jima. &quot;Before he died in November 2004, Resnick said Gagnon came aboard LST-758 the morning of February 23 looking for a flag. Resnick said he grabbed a flag from a bunting box and asked permission from his ship&#x27;s commanding officer Lt. Felix Molenda to donate it. Resnick kept quiet about his participation until 2001.&quot;

====Rosenthal&#x27;s photograph====

Gagnon, Strank, and Strank&#x27;s three Marines reached the top of the mountain around noon without being fired upon. Rosenthal, along with Marine photographers Sergeant Bill Genaust (who was killed in action after the flag-raising) and Private First Class Bob Campbell were climbing Suribachi at this time. On the way up, the trio met Lowery, who had photographed the first flag-raising, coming down. They considered turning around, but Lowery told them that the summit was an excellent vantage point from which to take photographs. The three photographers reached the summit as the Marines were attaching the flag to an old Japanese water pipe.

Rosenthal put his Speed Graphic camera on the ground (set to 1/400 sec shutter speed, with the f-stop between 8 and 11 and Agfa film) so he could pile rocks to stand on for a better vantage point. In doing so, he nearly missed the shot. The Marines began raising the flag. Realizing he was about to miss the action, Rosenthal quickly swung his camera up and snapped the photograph without using the viewfinder. Ten years after the flag-raising, Rosenthal wrote:

Sergeant Genaust, who was standing almost shoulder-to-shoulder with Rosenthal about three feet away, was shooting motion-picture film during the second flag-raising. His film captures the second event at an almost-identical angle to Rosenthal&#x27;s shot. Of the six flag-raisers in the picture—Ira Hayes, Harold Schultz (identified in June 2016), Michael Strank, Franklin Sousley, Harold Keller (identified in 2019), and Harlon Block—only Hayes, Keller (Marine corporal Rene Gagnon was incorrectly identified in the Rosenthal flag-raising photo), and Schultz (Navy corpsman John Bradley was incorrectly identified) survived the battle. Strank and Block were killed on March 1, six days after the flag-raising, Strank by a shell, possibly fired from an offshore American destroyer and Block a few hours later by a mortar round. Sousley was shot and killed by a Japanese sniper on March 21, a few days before the island was declared secure.

== Publication and staging confusion ==
Following the flag-raising, Rosenthal sent his film to Guam to be developed and printed. George Tjaden of Hendricks, Minnesota, was likely the technician who printed it. Upon seeing it, Associated Press (AP) photograph editor John Bodkin exclaimed &quot;Here&#x27;s one for all time!&quot; and immediately transmitted the image to the AP headquarters in New York City at 7:00 am, Eastern War Time. The photograph was quickly picked up off the wire by hundreds of newspapers. It &quot;was distributed by Associated Press within seventeen and one-half hours after Rosenthal shot it—an astonishingly fast turnaround time in those days.&quot;

However, the photograph was not without controversy. Following the second flag-raising, Rosenthal had the Marines of Easy Company pose for a group shot, the &quot;gung-ho&quot; shot. A few days after the photograph was taken, Rosenthal—back on Guam—was asked if he had posed the photograph. Thinking the questioner was referring to the &#x27;gung-ho&#x27; photograph, he replied &quot;Sure.&quot; After that, Robert Sherrod, a &quot;Time-Life&quot; correspondent, told his editors in New York that Rosenthal had staged the flag-raising photograph. &quot;Time&quot;&#x27;s radio show, &quot;Time Views the News&quot;, broadcast a report, stating that &quot;Rosenthal climbed Suribachi after the flag had already been planted. ... Like most photographers [he] could not resist reposing his characters in historic fashion.&quot; As a result of this report, Rosenthal was repeatedly accused of staging the photograph or covering up the first flag-raising. One &quot;New York Times&quot; book reviewer even went so far as to suggest revoking his Pulitzer Prize. In the following decades, Rosenthal repeatedly and vociferously denied claims that the flag-raising was staged. &quot;I don&#x27;t think it is in me to do much more of this sort of thing ... I don&#x27;t know how to get across to anybody what 50 years of constant repetition means,&quot; he said in 1995. In spite of movie camera film shot by Sergeant Bill Genaust simultaneously with Rosenthal snapping his still camera, showing the live action, unstaged, flag raising, the controversy continued.

== Incorrect identifications ==

President Franklin D. Roosevelt, upon seeing Rosenthal&#x27;s flag-raising photograph, saw its potential to use for the upcoming Seventh War Loan Drive to help fund the war effort. He then ordered the flag-raisers to be identified and sent to Washington, D.C. after the fighting on the island ended (March 26, 1945).

Rosenthal did not take the names of those in the photograph. On April 7, Rene Gagnon was the first of the second &quot;flag-raisers&quot; to arrive in Washington, D.C. Using an enlargement of the photograph that did not show the faces of the flag-raisers, he named himself, Henry Hansen, Franklin Sousley, John Bradley and Michael Strank, as being in the photograph. He initially refused to name Ira Hayes, as Hayes did not want the publicity and threatened him with physical harm. However, upon being summoned to Marine headquarters and told that refusal to name the last flag-raiser was a serious crime, he identified the sixth flag-raiser as Hayes.

President Roosevelt died on April 12, 1945. On April 19, Bradley (then on crutches) and Hayes arrived in Washington, D.C. On April 20, the three surviving second flag-raisers, identified then as Gagnon, Bradley, and Hayes, met President Truman in the White House. On May 9, during a ceremony at the nation&#x27;s capitol, the three men raised the original second flag to initiate the bond tour which began on May 11 in New York City. On May 24, Hayes was taken off the tour due to problems caused by drinking alcohol and ordered back to his company and regiment which had returned to Hawaii. Gagnon and Bradley completed the tour which ended on July 4 in Washington, D.C. The bond drive was a success, raising $26.3 billion, twice the tour&#x27;s goal.

===Harlon Block and Henry Hansen===
Gagnon misidentified Corporal Harlon Block as Sergeant Henry O. &quot;Hank&quot; Hansen in Rosenthal&#x27;s photo (both were killed in action on March 1). Initially, Bradley concurred with all of Gagnon&#x27;s identifications. On April 8, 1945, the Marine Corps released the identification of five of the six flag raisers, including Hansen rather than Block (Sousley&#x27;s identity was temporarily withheld pending notification of his family of his death during the battle). Block&#x27;s mother, Belle Block, refused to accept the official identification, noting that she had &quot;changed so many diapers on that boy&#x27;s butt, I know it&#x27;s my boy.&quot; When Hayes was interviewed about the identities of the flag raisers and shown a photo of the flag raising by a Marine public relations officer on April 19, he told the officer that it was definitely Harlon Block and not Hansen at the base of the flagpole. The lieutenant colonel then told Hayes that the identifications had already been officially released, and ordered Hayes to keep silent about it (during the investigation, the colonel denied Hayes told him about Block). Block, Sousley, and Hayes were close friends in the same squad of Second Platoon, E Company, while Hansen, who helped raise the first flag, was a member of Third Platoon, E Company.

In 1946, Hayes hitchhiked to Texas and informed Block&#x27;s parents that their son had, in fact, been one of the six flag raisers. Block&#x27;s mother, Belle, immediately sent the letter that Hayes had given her to her congressional representative Milton West. West, in turn, forwarded the letter to Marine Corps Commandant Alexander Vandegrift, who ordered an investigation. John Bradley (formerly in Third Platoon with Hansen), upon being shown the evidence (Hansen, a former Paramarine, wore his large parachutist boots in an exposed manner on Iwo Jima), agreed that it was probably Block and not Hansen. In January 1947, the Marine Corps officially announced it was Block in the photograph and not Hansen at the base of the flagpole. Hayes also was named as being in the far left position of the flag raisers replacing the position Sousley was determined to have had up until then; Sousley was now in back of and to the right of Strank (in 2016, Harold Schultz was named in this position and Sousley was named in the position where Bradley was named).

=== Harold H. Schultz and John Bradley ===
On June 23, 2016, the Marine Corps publicly announced that Marine Corporal (then Private First Class) Harold Schultz was one of the flag-raisers and Navy corpsman John Bradley was not one of the flag-raisers in Rosenthal&#x27;s second flag-raising photograph. Harold Schultz was identified as being in Franklin Sousley&#x27;s position to the right and in front of Ira Hayes, and Sousley was identified as being in Bradley&#x27;s position to the right and behind Rene Gagnon (identified as Harold Keller in 2019) behind Harlon Block at the base of the flagpole. Bradley and Schultz had been present when both flags were actually raised, while Sousley was only on Mount Suribachi when he helped raise the second flag. Schultz was also part of the group of Marines and corpsmen who posed for Rosenthal&#x27;s second &quot;gung ho&quot; photo.

Bradley, who died in 1994, seldom did an interview about the famous second flag-raising, occasionally deflecting questions by claiming he had forgotten. He changed his story numerous times, saying that he raised or pitched in to raise the flag, and also that he was on, and not on, Mount Suribachi when the first flag was raised. Within his family, it was considered a taboo subject, and when they received calls or invitations to speak on certain holidays, they were told to say he was away fishing at his cottage. At the time of Bradley&#x27;s death, his son James said that he knew almost nothing about his father&#x27;s wartime experiences. James Bradley spent four years interviewing and researching the topic and published a nonfiction book entitled &quot;Flags of Our Fathers&quot; (2000) about the flag-raising and its participants. The book, which was a bestseller, was later adapted into a 2006 film of the same name, directed by Clint Eastwood.

After being honorably discharged, Schultz moved to California and made his career with the United States Postal Service. He died in 1995.

The possibility that any flag-raiser had been misidentified was publicly raised for the first time in November 2014 by Eric Krelle, an amateur historian and collector of World War II-era Marine Corps memorabilia, and an Irish citizen and amateur historian named Stephen Foley. Studying other photographs taken that day and video footage, Krelle and Foley argued that Franklin Sousley was in the fourth position (left to right) instead of Bradley and Harold Schultz of Los Angeles (originally from Detroit) was in the second position, previously identified as Sousley. Initially, Marine Corps historians and officials did not accept those findings, but began their own investigation. On June 23, 2016, they confirmed Krelle&#x27;s and Foley&#x27;s findings, stating that Schultz was in Sousley&#x27;s place, Sousley was standing next to Block, and that Bradley was not in the photo at all. James Bradley has also changed his mind, stating that he no longer believes his father is depicted in the famous photograph.

=== Harold Keller and Rene Gagnon ===
On October 16, 2019, the Marine Corps announced that Marine Corporal Harold Keller was the flag-raiser previously identified as Rene Gagnon in Rosenthal&#x27;s photograph. Stephen Foley, filmmaker Dustin Spence, and Brent Westemeyer were key to this revised identification. Photos and video footage showed that the man thought to have been Gagnon had a wedding ring, which matched Keller, who had married in 1944 (Gagnon was not married at the time). The man also did not have a facial mole, as Gagnon did. Finally, a photo which captured the lowering of the first flag verified what Gagnon had looked like that day, which did not match the second man in the Rosenthal photo. After the battle, Keller returned to his hometown of Brooklyn, Iowa, where he died in 1979.

== Legacy ==

Rosenthal&#x27;s photograph was used as the basis for C. C. Beall&#x27;s poster &quot;Now... All Together&quot; for the Seventh War Loan Drive (14 May - 30 June 1945).

Rosenthal&#x27;s photograph won the 1945 Pulitzer Prize for Photography, the only photograph to win the prize in the same year it was taken.

Upon seeing the finished model, the Marine Corps commandant had de Weldon assigned to the Marine Corps until de Weldon was discharged from the Navy after the war was over.

Starting in 1951, de Weldon was commissioned to design a memorial to the Marine Corps. It took de Weldon and hundreds of his assistants three years to finish it. Hayes, Gagnon, and Bradley posed for de Weldon, who used their faces as a model. The three Marine flag raisers who did not survive the battle were sculpted from photographs.

The flag-raising Rosenthal (and Genaust) photographed was the replacement flag/flagstaff for the first flag/flagstaff that was raised on Mount Suribachi on February 23, 1945. There was some resentment from Marines of the original 40-man patrol that went up Mount Suribachi, including those involved with the first flag-raising, that they did not receive their deserved recognition. These included Staff Sgt. Lou Lowery, who took the first photos of the first flag flying over Mt. Suribachi; Charles W. Lindberg, who helped tie the first American flag to the first flagpole on Mount Suribachi (and who was, until his death in June 2007, one of the last living persons depicted in either flag-flying scene), who complained for several years that he helped to raise the flag and &quot;was called a liar and everything else. It was terrible&quot; (because of all the recognition and publicity directed to the replacement flag-raisers and that flag-raising); and Raymond Jacobs, photographed with the patrol commander around the base of the first flag flying over Mt. Suribachi, who complained until he died in 2008 that he was still not recognized by the Marine Corps by name as being the radioman in the photo.

The original Rosenthal photograph is in the possession of Roy H. Williams, who bought it from the estate of John Faber, the official historian for the National Press Photographers Association, who had received it from Rosenthal. Both flags (from the first and second flag-raisings) are located in the National Museum of the Marine Corps in Quantico, Virginia.

Ira Hayes, following the war, was plagued with depression brought on by survivor guilt and became an alcoholic. His tragic life, and death in 1955 at the age of 32, were memorialized in the 1961 motion picture &quot;The Outsider&quot;, starring Tony Curtis as Hayes, and the folk song &quot;The Ballad of Ira Hayes&quot;, written by Peter LaFarge and recorded by Johnny Cash in 1964. Bob Dylan later covered the song, as did Kinky Friedman. According to the song, after the war:

Rene Gagnon, his wife, and his son visited Tokyo and Mount Suribachi on Iwo Jima during the 20th anniversary of the battle of Iwo Jima in 1965. After the war, he worked at Delta Air Lines as a ticket agent, opened his own travel agency, and was a maintenance director of an apartment complex in Manchester, New Hampshire. He died while at work in 1979, age 54.

Rosenthal&#x27;s photograph has been reproduced in a number of other formats. It appeared on 3.5 million posters for the seventh war bond drive. It has also been reproduced with many unconventional media such as Lego bricks, butter, ice, Etch A Sketch and corn mazes.

The Iwo Jima flag-raising has been depicted in other films, including 1949&#x27;s &quot;Sands of Iwo Jima&quot; (in which the three surviving flag raisers make a cameo appearance at the end of the film) and 1961&#x27;s &quot;The Outsider&quot;, a biography of Ira Hayes starring Tony Curtis.

In July 1945, the United States Postal Service released a postage stamp bearing the image. The U.S. issued another stamp in 1995 showing the flag-raising as part of its 10-stamp series marking the 50th anniversary of World War II. In 2005, the United States Mint released a commemorative silver dollar bearing the image.

A similar photograph was taken by Thomas E. Franklin of the &quot;Bergen Record&quot; in the immediate aftermath of the September 11 attacks. Officially known as &quot;Ground Zero Spirit&quot;, the photograph is perhaps better known as &quot;Raising the Flag at Ground Zero&quot;, and shows three firefighters raising a U.S. flag in the ruins of the World Trade Center shortly after 5 pm. Painter Jamie Wyeth also painted a related image entitled &quot;September 11th&quot; based on this scene. It illustrates rescue workers raising a flag at Ground Zero. Other iconic photographs frequently compared include &quot;V-J Day in Times Square&quot;, &quot;Into the Jaws of Death&quot;, &quot;Raising a Flag over the Reichstag&quot;, and the &quot;Raising of the Ink Flag&quot;.

The highly recognizable image is one of the most parodied photographs in history. Anti-war activists in the 1960s altered the flag to bear a peace symbol, as well as several anti-establishment artworks. Edward Kienholz&#x27;s &quot;Portable War Memorial&quot; in 1968 depicted faceless Marines raising the flag on an outdoor picnic table in a typical American consumerist environment of the 1960s. It was parodied again during the Iran hostage crisis of 1979 to depict the flag being planted into Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini&#x27;s behind. In the early 2000s, to represent gay pride, photographer Ed Freeman shot a photograph for the cover of an issue of &quot;Frontiers&quot; magazine, reenacting the scene with a rainbow flag instead of an American flag. &quot;Time&quot; magazine came under fire in 2008 after altering the image for use on its cover, replacing the American flag with a tree for an issue focused on global warming. The British Airlines Stewards and Stewardesses Association likewise came under criticism in 2010 for a poster depicting employees raising a flag marked &quot;BASSA&quot; at the edge of a runway.

Among the smaller scale replicas of the Marine Corps War Memorial based on the flag raising is one also sculpted by Felix de Weldon at Marine Corps Recruit Depot Parris Island on the Peatross Parade Deck. For the finale of The Crucible, the Marines&#x27; 54-hour final training test, Marine recruits at Parris Island hike 9 miles to the statue as the sun rises and the flag is raised. They then are addressed on the flag raising and its meaning and are then awarded their Eagle, Globe and Anchor emblems by their drill instructors signifying them as full-fledged Marines.

The logo of the currently ruling National Council for the Safeguard of the Homeland military junta in Niger features a silhouetted version of the photograph, however replacing the American flag with a Nigerien flag.

In 2021 the Taliban posted a series of photos after the announcement that the Americans were withdrawing from Afghanistan. One of the photos posted shows Taliban soldiers raising a flag which has a notable similarity to Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima, although it is uncertain if this was their intent or merely a coincidental similarity.

All Limited Express trains are through service to the Minatomirai Line. Trains that continuously and completely operate as express services through Tobu/Seibu, Tokyo Metro, Tokyu, and Yokohama Minatomirai railways are dubbed as &quot;F-Liner&quot; services.

== Through operation ==
=== Tokyo Metro Fukutoshin Line ===
On 16 March 2013, the section of the Tōyoko line between Shibuya and Daikanyama Station was put underground, and connected to the Tokyo Metro Fukutoshin Line platforms at Shibuya. Through an engineering project culminating in a dramatic single overnight maneuver, the existing surface rail line was disconnected, sunken, and reconnected with the new underground line in time for the normal morning train schedule to run. 

The re-routing allowed for through operation between the Tōyoko and Fukutoshin lines. Since opening of the Fukutoshin Line in 2008, trains would through operate between the Seibu Ikebukuro line (via Seibu Yurakucho line) and the Tobu Tojo line at the northern end of the Fukutoshin Line. The new connection allows trains from Tobu Railway, Seibu Railway, Tokyo Metro, Tokyu Corporation and Yokohama Minatomirai Railway to operate trains in a common corridor. As a result of the new connection, the original elevated Shibuya terminal for Tokyu trains was abandoned and demolished.

=== Minatomirai Line ===
On 1 February 2004, Tōyoko line was realigned underground between Tammachi and Yokohama stations to enable through services with the Minatomirai Line. The original alignment to Yokohama Station was demolished and turned into a rail trail.

=== Tokyo Metro Hibiya Line (discontinued)===
Through operation with the Tokyo Metro Hibiya Line started on 29 August 1964, with trains starting at Hiyoshi station will travel into Kita-Senju Station via a connection to the Hibiya Line at Naka-Meguro Station. In 1988, this service was extended to Kikuna Station temporarily during the realignment of Hiyoshi station to an underground corridor, but was retained as official service due to its popularity.

On 15 March 2013, with the start of through service with Fukutoshin Line, services to and from the Hibiya Line were discontinued. Passengers must transfer between lines at Naka-Meguro Station.

=== Sōtetsu–Tōkyū Link Line ===

Through operation of the Tōkyū Shin-Yokohama Line and the Sōtetsu Shin-Yokohama Line started on 18 March 2023, with trains starting at Wakoshi station on the Fukutoshin Line travelling into Shin-yokohama and Shonandai via a connection to the Tōkyū Shin-yokohama Line at Hiyoshi Station.

In May 2006, both the Tokyu and Sagami Railway (Sōtetsu) announced a plan to build a long connection to allow through services between the Sōtetsu Main Line and Tōyoko Line. The connection starts at Hiyoshi Station and head to Sōtetsu Main Line&#x27;s Nishiya Station. New stations are set up at Tsunashima Station, Shin-Yokohama Station and Hazawa Yokohama Kokudai Station. However, when a concrete plan was specified in November 2008 for Tsunashima station, the plan was changed to the establishment of a &quot; Station&quot; to be constructed near Tsunashima station.

==History==

The first section of the line from Tamagawa to Kanagawa (separate from the present Kanagawa of Keikyu) opened on 14 February 1926. The line was extended incrementally until the entire length from Shibuya to in Yokohama was opened on 31 March 1932. On 29 August 1964, through service to the Tokyo Metro Hibiya Line via Naka-Meguro Station was started.
On 31 January 2004, the section of to Sakuragichō was abandoned. From 1 February, Tokyu Toyoko Line trains started through service from Yokohama to the Minatomirai Line.

On 16 March 2013, the section between Shibuya to Daikan-yama was replaced with an underground connection to the Tokyo Metro Fukutoshin Line. The original ground-level terminal platforms were closed after the last service at 1 am that morning. Just four hours later, at 5 am, trains began calling at a new set of underground platforms adjacent to those previously served only by the Fukutoshin Line. During this time, 1,200 workers shifted the track alignment at Daikan-yama Station along a pre-built incline.
Since that day, Tokyu and Yokohama Minatomirai Railway trains commenced through running onto the Fukutoshin Line and beyond. Tokyo Metro, Tobu, and Seibu also started operating their trains through to the Tōyoko and Minatomirai Lines. At the same time, through service on Hibiya Line ended.

In 2022, Tokyu announced the commencement of &quot;Q-Seat&quot; service on the Tōyoko Line for fiscal 2023. The Tōyoko Line will be the second Tokyu line to feature reserved seating services, the first being the Oimachi Line. Therefore, 5050 series 8-car set 5166 was reformed as 10-car set 4112 with two newly built “Q-Seat” cars. They feature the same livery used for the Oimachi Line, however were painted in red instead of orange. Set 4112 is currently undergoing testing and is being stored at Nagatsuta Depot. The cars started service on 24 October 2022 with &quot;Q-Seat&quot; services originally scheduled for February 2023. However as of August 2023, &quot;Q-Seat&quot; services are scheduled to begin service within the beginning of the month on 10 August.

Platform screen doors were scheduled to be installed at all station on the line by 2020. This work was finished on time before April 2020.

==Incidents and accidents==
On 15 February 2014, two trains collided and derailed at Motosumiyoshi station resulting in nineteen injuries. Operations continuing at normal speed during heavy snow were seen as likely cause.

==Future developments==
*On 13 May 2022, Tokyu Corporation announced its decision to implement driver-only operation on the Tōyoko Line by fiscal 2023, at the earliest. The Tōyoko Line fleet is due to be modified accordingly.

<text>Arpajon () is a commune in the Essonne department in the Île-de-France region of northern France.

The commune has been awarded three flowers by the &quot;National Council of Towns and Villages in Bloom&quot; in the &quot;Competition of cities and villages in Bloom&quot;.

==Geography==

===Location===
Arpajon is the capital of a canton located in the Paris urban area in the heart of the department of Essonne and the natural region of Hurepoix some 31 km south of Paris (Notre-Dame - point zero for distances from Paris), 15 kilometres west of Évry, 14 km south of Palaiseau, 6 km south of Montlhéry, 14 km north-west of La Ferté-Alais, 19 km east of Dourdan, 17 km west of Corbeil-Essonnes, 18 km north of Étampes, and 26 km north-west of Milly-la-Forêt.

The commune is also 410 km north of its homonym Arpajon-sur-Cère in Cantal department., the original stronghold of the lords of the town.

The commune consists of only 240 hectares but it is the capital of Arpajonnais Country which extends from Breuillet in the east to Brétigny-sur-Orge in the west and from Leuville-sur-Orge in the north to Cheptainville in the south. The relatively small size of the commune does not preclude a significant height differential from 89 to 47 metres altitude which causes a relatively large concentration of buildings on nearly 80% of the territory. Agricultural areas, which represent only 10% of the territory, are located in the extreme north-east of the commune along Route nationale 20.

===Hydrography===
Arpajon lies at the confluence of the &quot;Rémarde&quot; and the Orge rivers which join then separate in the centre of the town to permanently join at the border with Saint-Germain-lès-Arpajon. On the communal area the two rivers flow in parallel, the Rémarde coming from the west from Ollainville and, further south, the Orge comes from Égly with both streams flowing towards the north-east.

===Relief and geology===
The city centre is in the Orge valley at an altitude of approximately 47 metres but the territory extending north and south rises rapidly to the Avrainville plateau in the south, La Norville in the east, and the start of the Linas hill to the north which means it is necessary to climb to exit the commune. The highest point in the commune at 89 metres is located north of the Butte-aux-Grès area near the Linas forest. Due to the low height of the town relative to the surroundings there are many television receiving antennae which are sometimes ten metres above the roofs.

The territory lies on the boundary of the limestone geological area of the Paris basin and the sand of the Beauce with, in the extreme north, the remains of sandstone quarries.

===Climate===
Arpajon is located in Île-de-France and enjoys an attenuated oceanic climate characterized by cold winters, warm summers, and rainfall evenly distributed over the year. The average temperatures recorded at the departmental station at Brétigny-sur-Orge (5 km north-east of Arpajon) came to 10.8 °C with average maximum and minimum of 15.2 °C and 6.4 °C. The actual maximum and minimum temperatures recorded are 24.5 °C in July and 0.7 °C in January with record temperatures of 38.2 °C on 1 July 1952 and -19.6 °C on 17 January 1985. The situation in the large suburbs of the commune leads to a lower urban density than Paris with a negative difference of one to two degrees Celsius compared to Paris. Located near the Paris city centre and without the presence of large areas of culture, however, sunshine hours for the commune amounted to 1,798 annually as it is throughout the north of the department. With 598.3 millimeters of rainfall over the year and an approximate distribution of 50 mm per month, the town receives rainfall in the same proportion as other regions north of the Loire.

===Communication and transport===
The main transport route for the commune is Route nationale 20 which has avoided the centre of town by a deviation west since 1956 and crosses Arpajon from north to south. The commune is also the point of convergence of three important departmental roads: the D116D that leads to Dourdan in the west, the D449 that leads to La Ferté-Alais in the south, and the D152 that leads to Brétigny-sur-Orge in the east and to Limours in the west which is duplicated by the D97 which also goes to Limours. In addition there are the D192 which is a fast route through the Arpajon-Égly-Breuillet urban area and the D193 which connects to the D19. The commune is located four kilometres south of the Francilienne, a major regional axis that allows quick access to the A10 autoroute and A6 autoroute.

The Bretigny-Tours railway passes across the commune from west to east with Arpajon C4 RER station in the south of the commune served by two trains per hour.

The town is also served by:
*Albatrans bus network:
**Route 91.04 to Évry
*Daniel Meyer bus network:
**Route DM151 to Paris-Porte d&#x27;Orléans 19
**Route DM153 to Massy-Palaiseau 
**Route DM19 to Brétigny-sur-Orge 20
**Route DM20 to Arpajonnais Country between Égly and Norville 21 .
*Ormont bus network:
**Route 68.01 to Bruyeres-le-Chatel
**Route 68.05 to Boissy-sous-Saint-Yon 22, 23 .
*Savac bus network:
**Route 39.18 to Limours-en-Hurepoix 24 .
*CEAT bus network:
**Route 10.20 from Paris to Angerville
**Route 10.21 from Paris to Méréville

There are also some shuttle buses providing free transport in the commune with some dedicated to the elderly.

Orly Airport is located 18 kilometres away and accessible by Route nationale 20. Charles de Gaulle Airport is located 51 km away. For general aviation the Étampes - Mondésir Aerodrome (ICAO: LFOX) is 27 kilometres away.

===Localities, places, and areas===
The commune is not extensive so it does not any division into districts. Nevertheless, it is possible to distinguish the city centre, the railway station area, and the Cerpied Mill. In the north, nearby, is a place called &quot;La Montagne&quot; in reference to the slope to get there from the city centre and, in the extreme north, there is the former Folies quarter which has now become the business district of Butte-aux-Grès. A second business area, Les Belles-Vues, is reminiscent of the once agricultural character of the commune.

==Toponymy==
The Gallo-Romans placed a castrum to monitor the passage of along the Orge between &quot;Lutèce&quot; and Cenabum. The castrum became &quot;Chastres&quot; around the year 250 then &quot;Châtres&quot; (sometimes &quot;Châtres-sous-Montlhery&quot;) in the 17th century with the reform of spelling and the appearance of the circumflex in place of the silent &quot;s&quot;. &quot;Chastres&quot; could also mean &quot;land of rivers&quot; in &quot;the barbarian language&quot;.

In 1720 Louis de Severac, who was from the Arpajon family of Rouergue bought the marquisate of Châtres. He obtained the privilege of giving his name to the city from the regent Philippe d&#x27;Orléans and he called it &quot;Arpajon&quot;, spreading the use of the name by beating the peasants who had the misfortune to answer &quot;Châtres&quot; to the question &quot;where do you reside?&quot;. In 1794 Philippe de Noailles and his wife Anne d&#x27;Arpajon, first lady of honour to Marie-Antoinette, were guillotined. In 1793 the commune took the name of &quot;Franc-val&quot; or &quot;Franeval&quot; but returned to Arpajon in 1801.

Similar to Avignon and Arles the preposition &quot;in&quot; is not used. &quot;A residence at Arpajon&quot; is correct while &quot;a residence in Arpajonnais&quot; is also correct usage.

==History==

===Origins===
At the time of Roman Gaul there was a castrum was installed at the intersection of the road from &quot;Lutèce&quot; to Cenabum and the river Orge in the valley that was the territory of the Parisii tribe. The discovery in 1960 of the remains, which included a Gallo-Roman cemetery, certify this ancient occupation. The evolution of the name to &quot;Chastres&quot; is sometimes dated to the year 250. Two megalithic monuments remain: one in the Library Park and the other near the Rémarde river an inscription in Gallic was found in 1947 and is kept in the Municipal Museum of Saint-Germain-en-Laye.

===From Chastres to Arpajon===
In the 10th century the first church was built in the village but it was quickly ruined. In 1006 the rebuilding of the church and steeple was entrusted to the Benedictine monks of the Abbey of Saint-Maur by Renaud de Vendôme, bishop of Paris and it was consecrated to Pope Clement I. They added a cloister, a priory, and a tithe barn.

A document dated 1265 attests to the presence of a Hotel-Dieu at Arpajon for the accommodation of travelers and the poor. There were also several mills on the Orge and the Rémarde. The town was fortified and had five entrances.

In 1317 Pierre de Chastres was buried in the parish church. In 1360, during the Hundred Years War, the city was besieged by King Edward III of England and the church where there were eight hundred refugees was burned leaving no survivors.

In 1470 the lordship of Chastres belonged to the lord of Marcoussis. In July 1470 King Louis XI authorised two fair days at Chastres for his counselor and chamberlain Jean du Graville by letters patent. Louis Malet de Graville built a market hall at the crossroads of the Paris to Étampes and Dourdan to Corbeil roads.

In 1510 the monks, through the generosity of the Graville and Montagu families undertook major renovations of the church and in 1542 a sub-delegation of Chastres was attached to the &quot;Generality of Paris&quot;. In 1545 the lordship of Chastres became independent.

In 1643 the bell named &quot;Antoinette&quot; was cast. On 28 April 1652 Turenne stationed his troops at Châtres to protect the court at Saint-Germain before he marched on Étampes on 3 May.

In 1717 the Hotel-Dieu was completely rebuilt. In 1720 Louis de Severac, Marquis of Arpajon from the great medieval family of Arpajon, bought and obtained from Philippe d&#x27;Orléans the privilege of giving his name to the commune. However, the adoption of the new name took a long time and peasants who refused to abandon the name of Châtres were beaten up. He also promised to reduce local taxes for two years. The Canting arms of the city come from this family. In 1733 he knocked down the old city gate in the north which was too narrow for many carts and instead erected two Pilasters which are the current &quot;Porte de Paris&quot;. He died on 21 August 1736 and was buried in the choir of the parish church.

===The French Revolution and growth===
In 1782 Benjamin Franklin installed a lightning rod on the spire of the Church of Saint Clement. At the Revolution the town chose to adopt the name of &quot;Francval&quot;. There was a custom to give the name of the place of baptism as a second or third name: thus a boy was named Francval in year II.

Philippe de Noailles was lord of Arpajon and he was long in great favour at court with his wife being first lady of honour to Marie Antoinette, nicknamed by her Madame Etiquette. This Court favour brought down punishment in the days of the Revolution and the old marshal and his wife were guillotined on 27 June 1794.

The castle was sold in 1802 and demolished. In 1800 the Canton of Arpajon was created then attached to the Arrondissement of Corbeil in the department of Seine-et-Oise. In 1806 Napoleon I and Empress Josephine visited the town and made offering at the high altar of the church. In 1833 a large Post and Telegraph office was opened.

;Modernisation of Arpajon in the 19th century

In 1851 the Martin brothers, originating from Limoges, set up a shoe factory which, in 1900, employed 450 adults and about 50 children. It was bought by &quot;André shoes&quot; in 1920 and closed its doors forever in 1956. In 1868 the commune built a City Hall for use instead of the feudal castle. Then, in 1889, it bought the Pagoda that was presented by Tonkin during the Universal Exhibition of Paris.

In the same year the &quot;Compagnie de chemin de fer sur route de Paris à Arpajon&quot; (Railway Company for the Paris to Arpajon route) which in 1893 opened the Porte d&#x27;Orléans-Antony and Antony-Longjumeau-Montlhery sections then the Montlhery-Arpajon section in 1894 for passengers. In the surrounding villages of Marcoussis, Linas, and Montlhéry, market gardening was very important and from 1911 to 1936 led to expansion of the railway to transport tomatoes, strawberries, and beans grown in the fields to the Paris markets.

In the second half of the 19th century the &quot;Boulevard de la Gare&quot; was opened with the inauguration of the railway station in 1865 and the construction of holiday villas.

===Modern History===
In 1922 the first &quot;Bean Fair&quot; was inaugurated which was classified as a national fair in 1970. On 6 July 1924 on the long, straight Route nationale 20 between Arpajon and Torfou, René Thomas set a land speed record of in a Delage called &quot;La Torpille&quot; (The Torpedo) followed, on 12 July 1924, by Ernest A.D. Eldridge who increased the record to in a Fiat Special called &quot;Mephistopheles II&quot;. In 1934 the Hôtel-Dieu became a hospice as a result of the construction of the first hospital outside the town. On 22 August 1944 the commune was liberated by the Leclerc division. In 1948 Abel Cornaton, mayor of the commune, endowed the &quot;municipal showers&quot; which became the district court in 1985.

On 23 April 1977 Arpajon was on the path of the &quot;Tour cycliste de l&#x27;Essonne&quot;. On 1 January 1968, after the breakup of Seine-et-Oise department, Arpajon was integrated into the new French department of Essonne and abandoned its former postal code - 78021. Arpajon was also the last stage town of the Tour de France in 1999 before a journey of 143 kilometres to Paris .

===Political tendencies===
Politics in Arpajon in recent years have been characterized by ambivalent results which frequently follow national trends. The commune, which has sometimes been rightist, swung to a narrow lead in 2001 for the left with the election of Pascal Fournier (Socialist) who was elected in the first round in 2008 with 77.29% of the vote. In fact, local elections (cantonal or regional) have always been won by the left except for the partial cantonal elections in 2004 resulting in only 50.87% for Philippe Le Fol (DVD). Conversely, and always in accordance with the national results, the elections of 2002 and 2007, as with the presidential elections in 2002 and 2007, were largely won by the parliamentary right. In 2002 the result for Jean-Marie Le Pen (18.20%) was higher in Arpajon as compared to the national (17.79%) and the departmental (15.04%) figures. Similarly, Arpajon voters followed the national movement during the European elections in 2004 where the left was ahead of the right but at the referendum on the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe the &quot;no&quot; won.

===Education===
Arpajon schools are attached to the &quot;Academy of Versailles&quot;. The commune has the &quot;Édouard-Herriot&quot; primary school, the &quot;Anatole France&quot; and &quot;La Rémarde&quot; kindergartens, and the &quot;Victor Hugo&quot; elementary school. In addition there is the private Catholic Sainte-Jeanne d&#x27;Arc school in the Diocese. Strangely the town does not have a college and students attend the Jean Moulin and Albert Camus colleges in the neighbouring commune of La Norville or the Roland Garros college in Saint-Germain-lès-Arpajon.

Because of its status as capital of the canton, however, there are three higher schools, the Edmond Michelet general and technological school which provides training in BTS IRIS., the René-Cassin general and technological which had an 88% pass-rate for the baccalauréat in 2007, and the Paul Belmondo professional school. The premises of the hospital centre is also a training centre for caregivers.

An information and referral center is present in the commune. Recreation centres cater for children outside school hours and two crèches welcome young children. The CIPF is present in the town.

===Health===
The commune has a hospital with a capacity of 302 beds, offering services such as: Surgery, Obstetrics, Pediatrics, Gastroenterology, Diabetology, Cardiology, Pneumology, and Radiography. An ambulance service supplemented by a mobile emergency and resuscitation service is active for 42 neighbouring communes. The centre is spread over four sites: the central hospital, the rehabilitation centre in the neighbouring commune of Égly, and the &quot;Village du Pays&quot; retirement homes at Châtres and Guinchard, the latter hosting Alzheimer day patients. A family planning centre and a maternal and child healthcare centre are located in the commune.

The private hospital of Paris-Essonne, formerly the Charmilles Clinic, completes the offering with 60 beds, a surgery, and a specialization in pathologies of the face: ophthalmology, oto-rhino-laryngology, and dentistry.

In the town there are 47 doctors and 12 dentists are in private practice. There also 4 pharmacies.

===Public services===
Security in the commune is ensured by the presence of a police commisariat as well as a fire and rescue centre.

Public service bodies are relatively numerous in Arpajon which has a postal agency an Employment office and ASSEDICs, a Treasury and Tax centre a family allowance office a primary health insurance office, and a subdivision of the DDE.

Two notarial offices, a bailiff&#x27;s office, and two lawyers attached to the bar of Évry is located in the town.

From 1985 to 2009 a Registry of the District Court was installed in the town. Before the reform of the justice system the commune had a District Court but now depends on the one at Longjumeau, as with the Labour Court, the High Court, and the Commerce Court at Évry which are all attached to the Court of Appeal of Paris.

Arpajon has twinning associations with:
* Freising (Germany) since 1990.

==Demography==
The inhabitants of the commune are known as &quot;Arpajonnais&quot; or &quot;Arpajonnaises&quot; in French. Arpajon has seen demographic evolution of a town now part of the Paris Urban Area. From 1,988 inhabitants in Arpajon counted in the first census of 1793, the population grew slowly until the first demographic accident in 1846 when the population dropped to 2,017 and a second more important one in 1856 when it dropped to 1,890. Thereafter the demography increased up to 2,822 in 1872 to relatively stabilize before a new sustained growth after of World War I with 3,221 in 1921. The population increased again after the Second World War despite the 139 civilian and military casualties from both conflicts. After the construction of large housing estates the population reached 4,550 people in 1954, 8,105 in 1975 and 9,668 in the 2006 census. In 1999 10.8% of Arpajon people were foreigners and 14% of households consisted of single-parent families or 2 percent more for each category compared to the departmental figures. Among the foreign population, 3.4% were from Portugal, 1.6% from Morocco and Turkey, 1.3% from Algeria, 0.3% from Tunisia, and 0.2% for Spain and Italy. In 2017 the commune had 10,378 inhabitants.

==Economy==
As the capital of Arpajonnais and a historic land of market gardening, the commune has long been a place of trade and known for its fair since the 13th century. It has now lost the agricultural role (only three farms remain) and commerce favours other communes in the Canton. It remains, however, with a town centre with plenty of shops gathered around a merchants association. More than six hundred businesses are located in the commune with nearly a third of these shops. In 2004 52 new businesses were created in the commune. Two industrial areas include most of the other businesses: the Belles-Vues and the Butte-aux-Grès, both located in the north of the commune along Route nationale 20.

Arpajon is grouped into the labour pool (&quot;zone d&#x27;emploi&quot;) of Saclay by INSEE. In 2017 the Arpajon workforce was 5,365 people divided into 28.2% of employees, 27.0% of middle management, and 21.3% of workers. There were three people employed in agriculture. On the same date 10.3% of the active population was unemployed and only 18.7% worked in the commune. With 800 employees, the hospital is the largest employer, followed distantly by the family allowance office (300 staff), the René-Cassin School, and the municipality itself with 200 employees each.

A market is held in the covered market every Friday morning.

===Employment, income and standard of living===
In 2017 the median income in the town stood at 20,700 euros, but 41% of the population was not liable for the income tax. 57.9% of main residences in Arpajon were rented, including 19.6% in HLM type dwellings.

===Environmental heritage===
Although 80% of the communal area is urban there are still some parks and public gardens. The oldest, at 4 rue Henri Barbusse, was created in the 19th century. Five other parks adorn the city: Chevrier Park, Freising Park, 100 Grande Rue Park, Théophile Guesdon Park, and Rémarde Park. The banks of the Rémarde and the Orge are still mostly natural. This environmental heritage has allowed Arpajon to be rewarded by three flowers in the competition of cities and villages in Bloom since 2008.

The north-west of the commune still has cultural areas recalling the agricultural character of the town that specialised in market gardening.

==Daily life in Arpajon==
===Culture===
For cultural events the commune has the Francval Exhibition Hall. The cinema is popular and has five theatres which sometimes show Arthouse films.

There is a school of music and dance and a library in the old chateau stables.

There are many associations working for the promotion and dissemination of culture.

===Sports===
The relatively small size of the commune does not allow it to have any important sports infrastructure. Two stadia are nearby: Gaston-Cornu at Saint-Germain-lès-Arpajon and Louis Babin at La Norville. La Norville also has a swimming pool. There are 19 associations in the commune.

Arpajon town was traversed by the &quot;Tour cycliste de l&#x27;Essonne&quot; in 1977 and was a stage city for the 1999 Tour de France. As well as the Bean Fair the commune also organises a hiking rally and a bicycle race.

===Festivities===
There are two main events each year at Arpajon:
*The Carnival of Bineau, in which a representation of the steward is burned in Châtres Square, takes place every year on the first Sunday of March.
*The Foire aux haricots (The Bean Festival) started in 1922 and was recognised as a national fair in 1970. It is a trade and crafts event which is held every third weekend in September over 4 days in memory of the market gardening that there was in the commune in the past. The bean celebrated here is the &quot;chevrier&quot;.

There are other national events such as the Fête de la Musique (Festival of Music) which are celebrated in the commune.

===Places of Worship===
Arpajon Catholic parish is part of the Diocese of Évry-Corbeil-Essonnes and the deanery of Trois-Vallées-Arpajon. The church is dedicated to Pope Clement I.

There is a Protestant evangelical church in the commune. Other denominations do not have a place of worship in the commune.

===Media===
The &quot;Cœur Essonne&quot; (Heart of Essonne) edition of the weekly &quot;Le Républicain&quot; contains local information on Arpajon. Despite its enclosed location geographically, the commune lies in the transmission area of France 3 Paris Île-de-France Centre, IDF1, and Télévision Île-de-France (Télif).

===Arpajon in arts and culture===
The proximity of Paris and the nearby presence of film studios at Saint-Germain-lès-Arpajon has meant that Arpajon has appeared in various films:
*In 1960 the covered market and the Porte de Paris appeared in &quot;Le Président&quot; by Henri Verneuil 
*In 1962 the Thirion shop appeared in &quot;La Vie à la française&quot; (French Life)
*In 1966 the commune appeared in &quot;Paris brûle-t-il ?&quot; (Is Paris burning?) by René Clément

The action of the film &quot;3 zéros&quot; (Shooting Stars) by Fabien Onteniente released in 2002 137 takes place in Arpajon, but only one scene is set there: Ticky Holgado toured the market place by bicycle.

There is a legend that the name &quot;Bineau&quot; of a carnivalesque character recalls a steward who was granted a &quot;Droit du seigneur&quot; on the ladies of the village and was burned alive as punishment.

Honoré de Balzac located part of his novel &quot;Un début dans la vie&quot; (A start in life) in Arpajon: &quot;As for Mr. Serisy, he did not emigrate during the Revolution, he went to his Serizy land at Arpajon, where the respect that he had from his father saved him from all evil&quot;

The character of a &quot;Countess of Arpajon&quot; appears in the work &quot;À la recherche du temps perdu&quot; (In Search of Lost Time) by Marcel Proust in the volumes &quot;Sodome et Gomorrhe&quot; (Sodom and Gomorrah) and &quot;Le Temps retrouvé&quot; (Time Regained).

The &quot;Chevrier&quot; bean is also called the bean of Arpajon.

<text>Christopher Hülsbeck (born 2 March 1968), known internationally as Chris Huelsbeck, is a German video game music composer. He gained popularity for his work on game soundtracks for &quot;The Great Giana Sisters&quot; and the &quot;Turrican&quot; series.

== Career ==

Huelsbeck&#x27;s music career started at age 17, when he entered a music competition in the German &quot;64&#x27;er&quot; magazine, taking first prize with his composition &quot;Shades&quot;. He took a job in music production with the company Rainbow Arts.

In 1986, Huelsbeck released the &quot;SoundMonitor&quot; program for the Commodore 64 computer. The program was released as a type-in listing in the German computer magazine &quot;64&#x27;er&quot;. This program, featuring the idea of notation data rolling from down to up, is assumed to have a significant influence on Karsten Obarski&#x27;s Ultimate Soundtracker (1987) which was a starting point for the still continuing tradition of tracker music programs.

Huelsbeck has written soundtracks for more than 70 titles, the latest being &quot;Giana Sisters: Twisted Dreams&quot;. Many of his scores for the Commodore 64 are regarded as classics among enthusiasts today, most notably &quot;The Great Giana Sisters&quot;. He is best known for the soundtracks to the &quot;Turrican&quot; series of games.

He also created a music replay routine for the Amiga called TFMX — &quot;The Final Musicsystem eXtended&quot;, which features more musically-oriented features than rival Soundtracker, such as logarithmic pitch-bends, sound macros and individual tempos for each track.

=== Orchestra performances ===
His music from &quot;Apidya&quot;, &quot;Turrican II&quot;, &quot;Turrican 3&quot; and &quot;The Great Giana Sisters&quot; was performed live at the &quot;Symphonic Game Music Concert&quot; series in Leipzig, Germany between 2003 and 2007, conducted by Andy Brick. Huelsbeck&#x27;s music from &quot;Apidya&quot; was thus part of the first game concert outside Japan in 2003.

On 23 August 2008, his music was performed at &quot;Symphonic Shades&quot;, a concert devoted exclusively to his work. For the first time ever in Europe, an orchestral concert was dedicated to a game composer and broadcast live on the radio. The WDR Radio Orchestra and a choir performed classics such as &quot;The Great Giana Sisters&quot;, &quot;Turrican&quot;, &quot;R-Type&quot; and others in Cologne, Germany under the direction of Arnie Roth. On 19 March 2009, the concert &quot;Sinfonia Drammatica&quot; at the Konserthuset in Stockholm, Sweden was announced, with Arnie Roth conducting the Royal Stockholm Philharmonic Orchestra. The event took place on 4 August 2009 and combined performances of Huelsbeck&#x27;s &quot;Symphonic Shades&quot; with excerpts from &quot;Drammatica&quot; by Yoko Shimomura.

Additionally, the London Video Game Orchestra (initially founded in 2019) performed an arrangement of &quot;The Wall&quot; from the Turrican 2 score. This was during their &quot;Remastered&quot; concert performed on 11 June 2022.

<text>James Wright (8 May 1716 – 20 November 1785) was an English jurist and colonial administrator who served as the last Royal governor of Georgia from 1760 till July 1782, with a brief exception in 1777 when the state was under rebel control. 

== Biography ==
James Wright was born in London to Robert Wright Jr, son of Sir Robert Wright, Lord Chief Justice of England.

In 1730 Robert Wright, James Wright&#x27;s father, accompanied Robert Johnson to the Province of South Carolina and served as its Chief Justice until 1739. James followed soon after and began the practice of law in Charleston. On 14 August 1741 he entered Gray&#x27;s Inn in London. In 1747 James was named colonial attorney-general. He also began amassing plantation lands.

Wright returned to London as an agent for the South Carolina colony in 1757. On one of his England visits, or on all of them, he stayed with his cousin William Rugge, the ancestor of the Rugge-Price baronets, on Conduit Street. Then, in May 1760, he was named as Lieutenant Governor to Henry Ellis in Georgia. He returned to America and took up residence in Savannah, Province of Georgia. When Ellis resigned he was appointed Governor in November 1760. He was the third, and arguably most popular, Royal Governor of the colony. He sold many of his holdings in South Carolina, acquired land in Georgia, and moved his financial operations as well. With peace temporarily established with the French and Spanish, he successfully negotiated with the Indians and the Crown to open new lands to development. In his early administration, the new lands and economic improvement fostered the development of the Georgia colony.

His first troubles came with the Stamp Act of 1765. But, in spite of efforts by the Sons of Liberty to block its implementation, Georgia was the only colony to import and actually use the revenue stamps. In 1768, Wright established the 12,000-acre settlement known as Wrightsboro, Georgia. Wrightsboro was set aside for displaced Quakers from North Carolina and became home to William Few when his family fled North Carolina after their farm had been burned and James Few, William&#x27;s brother had been hanged without a trial. As the American Revolution gathered momentum, Georgia remained the most loyal colony—due in part to its recent settlement, with many residents having direct ties through kinship in Great Britain, and, in part as well, to Wright&#x27;s able administration. Georgia did not send delegates to the First Continental Congress in 1774. That same year saw the death of his wife, Sarah.

By 1775, the revolutionary spirit had reached Georgia through the &quot;Committees of correspondence&quot; and he dismissed the assembly. But a revolutionary congress met that summer in Savannah and elected delegates to the Second Continental Congress. Then, in early 1776, following the arrival of a small British fleet, rebel forces entered his home and briefly took him prisoner. Wright escaped on 11 February 1776, via Bonaventure Plantation and with the assistance of two compatriots, colonel John Mullryne and Josiah Tattnall (father of future Governor of Georgia, Josiah Tattnall Jr.), to the safety of HMS &quot;Scarborough&quot;, and sent a letter to his council. The congress and the council adjourned without answering him.

For a time, Wright continued negotiations. He was even able to trade with the rebels to keep his offshore troops and ships supplied. But the differences continued to escalate. When his attempt to retake Savannah with naval forces failed, he returned to England.

By 1778, Governor Wright convinced the government to lend him enough troops to once again attempt to take Savannah. After some short but sharp fights, he regained control of Savannah on 29 December 1778. While never fully in control of the state, he did restore large areas within Georgia to colonial rule, making this the only colony that was regained by the British once they had been expelled. He led a successful defense against several American and French attempts to capture the city. When the war in the North American theatre was lost, he withdrew on 11 July 1782 and retired to England.

Wright&#x27;s extensive properties were seized by the revolutionary governments in South Carolina and Georgia. He died in London, and is interred at Westminster Abbey.

== Wright&#x27;s offspring ==
James F. Cook in his book &quot;The Governors of Georgia 1754-2004&quot; states that Sir James Wright (1716-1785) and Sarah Maidman (died 1763) had nine children. They were:

* Sir James Wright (1747–1816), the 2nd Baronet. He married Sarah Williamson Smith, daughter of Captain John Smith and Elizabeth Williamson (other sources such as &quot;Burke&#x27;s Peerage&quot; of 1833 incorrectly call her Mary Smith, daughter of John Smith, a former governor of South Carolina) and died without issue.
* Sarah (born 1744), who went with her father Sir James Wright and her brothers James, Alexander, and Charles to Jamaica with other family members, where they were granted land, and later to England to join her father, where she married William Bartram of Norfolk, a Jacobite.
* Alexander (born 1751), who was a Loyalist and lost his American estates. He moved to Jamaica and married Elizabeth Izard, daughter of John Izard and niece of Congressman Ralph Izard. He was the father of Sir James Alexander Wright, the 3rd Baronet and of John Izard Wright, the father of Sir John Wright, the 4th Baronet.
* Charles
* Ann (born 1749), who married British Admiral James Wallace
* Elizabeth
* Charlotte
* Mary (1742–1763)
* Isabella, who married General Thomas Barrow in 1757

==Legacy==
Wright Square in Savannah, Georgia, is named in his honour. Wrightsboro, Georgia is also named after him.

<text>Snefru is a cryptographic hash function invented by Ralph Merkle
in 1990 while working at Xerox PARC.
The function supports 128-bit and 256-bit output. It was named after the Egyptian Pharaoh Sneferu, continuing the tradition of the Khufu and Khafre block ciphers.

The original design of Snefru was shown to be insecure by Eli Biham and Adi Shamir who were able to use differential cryptanalysis to find hash collisions. The design was then modified by increasing the number of iterations of the main pass of the algorithm from two to eight. Although differential cryptanalysis can break the revised version with less complexity than brute force search (a certificational weakness), the attack requires formula_1 operations and is thus not currently feasible in practice.

<doc id="450616" wikidata="Q8057921" url="?curid=450616" title="Young Americans for Freedom">
<text>Young Americans for Freedom (YAF) is a conservative youth activism organization that was founded in 1960 as a coalition between traditional conservatives and libertarians on American college campuses. It is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization and the chapter affiliate of Young America&#x27;s Foundation. The purposes of YAF are to advocate public policies consistent with the Sharon Statement, which was adopted by young conservatives at a meeting at the home of William F. Buckley in Sharon, Connecticut, on September 11, 1960.

While the 1960s were its most successful years in terms of numbers and influence, YAF has experienced a resurgence in recent years, becoming active as a national organization with chapters on college and high school campuses throughout the United States. YAF&#x27;s official publication is &quot;The New Guard&quot;.

==History==

===Volatile early years===
Historians have documented the volatility inside YAF during its early years as a coalition of conservatives and libertarians. Kenneth Heineman writes, &quot;YAF itself suffered internal strife. In 1969 the organization split into competing, irreconcilable factions.&quot; Gregory L. Schneider states, &quot;In the mid-1970s YAF suffered from weak leadership based on factions and personalities rather than ability&quot;. Jerome Tuccile writes, &quot;The second faction of rebels consisted of radical libertarians or anarchists, most of them belonging to Karl Hess IV&#x27;s Anarcho-libertarian Alliance. This contingent was more interested in splitting off from YAF entirely.&quot; Rebecca E. Klatch writes, &quot;When one young libertarian burned his draft card on the convention floor, the crowd turned into an angry mob and, ultimately, purged all libertarians from YAF. One libertarian faction stormed out of the meeting.&quot; Lauren Lassabe Shepherd details how YAF coalitions of traditionalists, libertarians, and evangelicals were fragile and could only be united under the banner of anti-liberalism.

===National conservative activism, 1960–65===
In September 1960, about 90 young people met at the childhood home of William F. Buckley Jr. in Sharon, Connecticut. They gathered to lay the groundwork for a new national conservative youth organization. It is here that Young Americans for Freedom was born and their statement of principles, the Sharon Statement, was drafted. &quot;The New Guard&quot; magazine made its debut as the official magazine of YAF in 1961. In the first four years of its existence, YAF grew rapidly on college campuses.

Ronald Reagan joined the YAF National Advisory Board in 1962 and for 42 years served as the Honorary Chairman.

In the 1960s, the Republican Party was divided between its conservative wing, led by Barry Goldwater, and its more liberal wing, led by Nelson Rockefeller. YAF members fell squarely on Goldwater&#x27;s side and spearheaded the campaign of Barry Goldwater for president. 

On March 7, 1962, a YAF-sponsored conservative rally filled Madison Square Garden in New York City, drawing 18,000 people. In attendance was Barry Goldwater. The event has been described as &quot;the birthday of the conservative movement.&quot;

The second national YAF convention was held in 1963 at the Gault Hotel in Florida. With over 450 voting delegates in attendance. Hotel management at the Gault Hotel refused accommodations to Don Parker, an African-American delegate from Brooklyn. As word of this spread around the YAFers in attendance, a number of delegates and numerous others began gathering in the lobby of the hotel demanding that either the Gault Hotel allow all the black YAFers to stay and the hotel change its segregation policy or YAF would move the convention to another site. From that day on any person was allowed into the Gault Hotel. However, Black membership has always been exceptional in YAF and many of the organization&#x27;s national board members have been outspoken segregationists, including Strom Thurmond, William Colmer, and L. Mendel Rivers.

By 1964, YAF was a major force in the campaign to nominate Goldwater, and then after his nomination, to elect him president. Goldwater&#x27;s run for the White House catalyzed YAF more than any other event in its history. Lee Edwards, former &quot;New Guard&quot; editor, said &quot;Barry Goldwater made YAF, but YAF also made Barry Goldwater.&quot; Goldwater&#x27;s massive defeat in the presidential election of 1964 demoralized many YAF members.

In YAF&#x27;s campaign to &quot;STOP RED TRADE&quot;, IBM, Mack Truck, and Firestone Tire and Rubber were targeted for engaging in high visibility trade with the Soviet Bloc. As part of a wave of America First boycotts, YAF claimed that it stopped Firestone&#x27;s attempt to build a synthetic rubber plant in communist Romania through letter-writing campaigns, boycotts, and demonstrations. YAF also claimed their plan to distribute 500,000 flyers at the Indianapolis 500 was key to the decision by Firestone executives to cancel their Romanian plans in April 1965.

In September 1965, the YAF announced plans to hold a memorial honoring three Russian Nazi collaborators from the Russian Liberation Army, who&#x27;d committed suicide on June 29, 1945, to avoid repatriation to the Soviet Union. The memorial was cancelled after protests by Ralph Plofsky, the commander of the Jewish War Veterans of the United States of America.

YAF faced opposition from groups like the American Nazi Party because of the presence of Jews in the organization and its close relationship with Marvin Liebman. However, YAF did honor Senator from South Carolina Strom Thurmond, a segregationist, with its Freedom Award in 1962. Several YAF members campaigned for segregationist George Wallace for president in 1968, forming an auxiliary Youth for Wallace movement, which later became the National Youth Alliance and the American Nazi Party. An unsubstantiated claim has been made that a YAF member was involved with the &#x27;Welcome Mr. Kennedy to Dallas&#x27; ad placed in the &quot;Dallas Morning News&quot; (coincidentally on the morning of JFK&#x27;s assassination), which accused him of ignoring the Constitution.

===Reaction to radical activism, 1965–71===
Liberalism and radicalism dominated campuses from the mid-1960s until the early 1970s, primarily as a result of the civil rights movement and the Vietnam War. Though outnumbered, YAF went on the offensive against radical left-wing organizations by challenging and rebutting civil rights groups like the Afro-American Society and W.E.B. DuBois clubs, as well as antiwar groups like Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) and New MOBE in support of a U.S. victory in Vietnam.

YAF members tended to hold similar opinions to their older compatriots within the conservative movement, including members of their advisory board such as Strom Thurmond, John Tower, L. Mendel Rivers, and William Colmer. YAF began and continued a number of projects to support Vietnam veterans and their causes. &quot;Project Appreciation&quot; gave YAFers the opportunity to write, visit, and provide needed supplies to hospitalized veterans. YAF worked on various POW/MIA issues. In a protest in Santa Monica in 1979, the YAF focused protests and a personal attack on Jane Fonda by hanging an effigy of her outside her house due to her opposition to the Vietnam War. YAF often made protests appearances at Fonda events, getting in physical altercations with her security guards and mocking her peace activism and acting career by holding up banners that read, &quot;&quot;Barbarella&quot; bombed, why can&#x27;t Nixon?&quot; and &quot;Shoot Fonda, not film!&quot;

A faction of YAF philosophically extended the group&#x27;s traditional support of limited government in economic issues to social issues and a foreign policy of non-interventionism. This group came to be known as libertarians. A more serious and lasting challenge for YAF came from this group, those who believed in limited or even no government – radical libertarians and anarchists. YAF&#x27;s Libertarian and Anarchist Caucuses were purged at the YAF&#x27;s 1969 national convention in St. Louis, and members of this faction were among the founding members of the Libertarian Party in 1971.

===Advocacy politics, 1971–85===
In the 1970s, YAF became much older, demographically speaking. Rather than merely staging campus demonstrations, they focused on influencing national politics by lobbying and occasionally staging and publicizing small demonstrations.

YAF went on the offensive when President Nixon enacted wage controls, price controls, abandoned the gold standard, and opened relations with the communist People&#x27;s Republic of China, ceasing relations with Taiwan. YAF felt he was abandoning conservative principles so YAF publicly denounced the administration for these moves, becoming the first conservative organization to do so.

A number of YAF projects were started as ad hoc committees and affiliated groups to address specific issues. These groups include Youth for the Voluntary Prayer Amendment, Student&#x27;s Committee for the Right to Keep and Bear Arms, Young America&#x27;s Foundation, Free Campus News Service, STOP-NSA Committee, and the National Student Committee for Victory in Vietnam.

In 1974, YAF, along with the American Conservative Union, sponsored a modest and ambitious gathering called the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC). CPAC has become the largest annual gathering of conservatives and is still held annually in the DC area.

On college campuses, YAF was more conservative and less partisan than the College Republicans. Members were willing to oppose liberal candidates and support conservative candidates regardless of party affiliation. During many local and national races throughout this era, YAF members were divided about whether to support a moderately conservative electable candidate or to support a staunchly conservative long-shot candidate.

YAF supported Reagan&#x27;s almost-successful bid to win the Republican presidential nomination in 1976 and his victorious race for the presidency in 1980.

The YAF targeted the Carter Administration, and YAF was active in opposing the Panama Canal and SALT treaties. The Iran Hostage Crisis focused public criticism on the Carter Administration and provided YAF a rallying point in 1979. YAF held a campaign to generate thousands of letters of encouragement to the hostages and pressed the Administration to take action.

In 1980, Young Conservatives of Texas was formed by a group of YAF members in Texas that broke off to found their own organization. Since that time, YAF itself has never had a major presence in the state. That same year, YAF&#x27;s long-time friend and advisor Ronald Reagan became the 40th President of the United States. The election of Reagan ushered in the conservative decade. YAFers around the nation mobilized in support of Reagan&#x27;s agenda.

Many YAFers received appointments to the Reagan Administration. Reagan Administration officials and prospective appointees who were targeted by the radical left were strongly defended by YAF. YAFers rallied to the support of Labor Secretary Raymond Donovan, Interior Secretary James Watt, Circuit Court Judge Dan Manion, Supreme Court nominee Robert Bork, and NSC staff member Lt. Colonel Oliver North.

By the mid-1980s, many of YAF&#x27;s leaders were in their thirties and long out of college. Some of them held positions in government while continuing to run the organization as a lobbying and fund-raising group for conservative causes. At the same time, internal problems paralyzed the YAF hierarchy. The national board was controlled by lawyers and lobbyists who focused on fundraising. This era ended with financial problems which led to YAF losing most of its assets.

===Campus activism, 1985–90===
After a financial collapse, most of the older members went on to other things, while younger members dominated YAF. During this era, a new generation of liberal and radical activism was growing on college campuses, and members began focusing on opposing these movements. This growth was strongest in California, where members staged protests in favor of aid to the Nicaraguan Contras, in favor of Reagan&#x27;s anti-communist policies and in opposition to the United Nations.

The emphasis on campus activism gradually spread to all the states where YAF was still active. In 1989, an alliance of Californian and New York activists took over a majority of the seats on the national board.

===Rebuilding years, 1991–99===
Though the presence of National YAF was lax during the 1990s as they were focusing on revitalizing and rebuilding the organization, there remained very active pockets of YAF activity throughout the country, campus charters and statewide units that organized and operated on their own. California YAF continued as a strong conservative force on campuses and in that state&#x27;s political arena. Many states like Florida, Massachusetts, Michigan, Pennsylvania, New York, Virginia and others still had very active individual campus chapters.

By 1991, the national board of YAF contained a majority of Californians – the first time a single state had had a majority in the governing council. However, this new régime found itself unable to effectively run YAF as a financial and organizational entity. The strength of its activism was shattered by the Gulf War that began in January 1991. Most members considered President George H. W. Bush to be insufficiently conservative, and his rhetoric justifying the war – &quot;a new world order&quot; – to be dangerously utopian. While conservative-oriented students on campuses around the country were showing support for the American effort against Saddam Hussein&#x27;s invasion of Kuwait, many YAF leaders of the time were expressing opposition to the war effort. Thus, an opportunity to expand the organization&#x27;s membership was lost.

In August 1991, YAF held its 16th National Convention in Washington D.C. YAF members from around the country gathered to reaffirm its commitment to conservative principles and heard such speakers as William F. Buckley, Jr., Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney, and G. Gordon Liddy. The following year, YAF National Chairman Jeff Wright met with Vice President Dan Quayle and delivered over 40,000 petitions in support of his renomination as Vice President. YAF launched an Anita Hill Truth Squad and YAFers confronted Anita Hill on college campuses across America. YAF pushed the 1992 Republican National Convention to continue strong support for conservative issues.

At the 1995 Conservative Political Action Conference, YAF held a &quot;Colloquium on Revolution.&quot; Young Americans for Freedom members rallied around speakers such as YAF founding elder Howard Phillips, Congressman Robert Dornan, Joseph Sobran, and other speakers motivating the young crowds to continue YAF&#x27;s conservative charge to preserve freedom and individual liberty. In 1996, National chairman Jon Pastore led a delegation of YAFers to bring national attention to a group called the North American Man/Boy Love Association (NAMBLA). NAMBLA members got quite a surprise at one of their events in Washington DC in 1996 when YAFers held banners warning the effects of &#x27;deviant and un-natural sexual practices.&#x27;

In 1997, Brian Park, National Director and state Chairman of California YAF, organized support for the rights of American Indians when their tribal sovereignty was being encroached upon by Governor Pete Wilson.
Full page newspaper ads centered on YAF&#x27;s resolution to support tribal sovereignty were placed in every major newspaper across the state of California to pressure the Governor. The negotiations failed and the historic Proposition 5 was placed on the ballot in 1998. YAF made over 1 million voter contacts with direct-mail pieces to educate the public on American Indian Sovereignty issues and the measure passed overwhelmingly with bi-partisan support of 62.4% to 32.6%. Proposition 5 was eventually challenged in the courts and YAF filed a &quot;Friends of the Court&quot; brief (case number S074850) with the State Supreme court in 1999. Though YAF lost, its leg work assisted in a passage of Proposition 1A in year 2000 with no real opposition to fix the legal problems with Proposition 5.

In 1998 Cigar-Man was launched against President Bill Clinton. A YAFer dressed in a Cigar-Costume followed President Clinton to various fundraising functions to highlight Clinton&#x27;s presidential achievements.

At the 1999 Academy Awards in Los Angeles, YAFers rallied in support of the Academy of Motion Pictures decision to award famous director Elia Kazan with the lifetime achievement award. Confronted by over 600 union activists and other leftists YAFers continued with their peaceful pro-Kazan rally. When the rally turned ugly YAFers defended themselves and assisted the police to apprehend the violent leftist perpetrators. 

Later in the 1990s, YAF returned to national advocacy politics. The national office organized petition drives and staged a variety of events to promote the conservative viewpoint on a variety of public issues. Some of these events would have an attention-grabbing theme such as &quot;Pardon Oliver North&quot; and &quot;Impeach Janet Reno&quot;.

===Resurgence, 2000–10===
In 2007, the YAF chapter at Michigan State University organized protests against legislation enacting anti-discrimination protection for transgender individuals. Ten years later, Grant Strobl, YAF&#x27;s national chairman, said the Michigan State chapter was not chartered and had associated itself with YAF without authorization.

Beginning in 2009, Young Americans for Freedom has organized a number of new college chapters to supplement the long-standing units on campuses such as Penn State. On college campuses, YAF chapters have been involved in activities including sponsoring conservative speakers, rallies supporting the armed forces, advocacy of strict control of illegal immigration, demonstrations against affirmative action and protesting liberal campus speakers.

In 2009, YAF, a coalition of Tea Party groups, retired police and firefighter association, and Keep America Safe hosted the &quot;9/11 Never Forget&quot; Rally in New York City. The Coalition united to fight the decision of U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder to try the 9/11 co-conspirators in New York City&#x27;s federal court. The coalition claimed Holder&#x27;s decision gave alleged war criminals the same rights as American citizens; it also said trying the defendants in New York City would endanger the citizenry. The rally brought nationwide attention to Holder&#x27;s decision and eventually led the Department of Justice and the Obama administration to move the trial from New York City.

===Modern history, 2010–present===
On March 16, 2011, Young Americans for Freedom passed National Board Resolution #001, unifying the Young America&#x27;s Foundation with Young Americans for Freedom on April 1, 2011. Young America&#x27;s Foundation provides students with speakers, activism programs, conferences and opportunities to learn about Ronald Reagan&#x27;s accomplishments by visiting his beloved ranch, Rancho del Cielo, in Santa Barbara, California. Young America&#x27;s Foundation has brought speakers like Ben Shapiro and David Horowitz to College Republican groups across the United States, as well as to broader university venues.

As of May 16, 2011 Young Americans for Freedom officially became a project of Young America&#x27;s Foundation. The existing board members of Young Americans for Freedom, at the time of the unification, became part of a newly formed [board of governors]. Existing YAF chapters were brought under the auspices of the Foundation.

Today, the unification has concluded. Current chapters receive a wide variety of materials, training, support, and encouragement based on YAF&#x27;s decades of activism experience.

==Influence==
From its beginning as an outgrowth of the efforts to obtain the Republican vice-presidential nomination for a conservative in 1960 to its determined campaign to ensure that a conservative vice-president (Dan Quayle) was renominated in 1992, YAF was a major player in late 20th century American politics.

Karl Zinsmeister wrote the following about YAF:

Although YAF members and chapters were engaged in many projects to influence public policy and elect conservative candidates to office, the leadership of the organization was well aware that their goals and objectives were more long-term. YAF was recruiting, training and preparing young people to assume even more important roles later in life. YAF spawned many of the organizational elements of the 21st-century conservative movement and provided the leadership and manpower to build those publications, organizations, and foundations into the significant elements of American society that they are today.

==Creating a conservative movement==
YAF played a critical role in the development of many of the new conservative organizations that were established in the 1960s, 1970s, and beyond. Many college students and young adults active in YAF went on to form new groups or serve as important personnel in conservative organizations founded by others.

==Philosophy==

Since its founding, YAF continuously identified itself as &quot;conservative&quot;. However, the term &quot;conservative&quot; has changed in meaning over several generations. Before World War II, most American conservatives were non-interventionist. But as the Cold War began to dominate American foreign policy, the old conservatism disintegrated. After Robert A. Taft was defeated for the Republican nomination in 1952, non-interventionist conservatism mostly vanished. In the 1950s, a new kind of conservatism arose. This new ideology was formulated in large part by the newspaper &quot;Human Events&quot;, the magazine &quot;National Review&quot;, and its editor William F. Buckley Jr. This new conservatism combined free-market economics, respect for traditional values, orderly society and anti-communism.

In the late 1960s, the term libertarianism began to be used for a political philosophy. Many of those who popularized this term were initially part of the conservative movement, but came to separate themselves from the conservatives on certain issues. Libertarians within YAF believed, for example, the military draft was a violation of the individual freedom the organization claimed to embrace. To oppose it they were willing to reject existing laws against burning draft cards and supported those who fled to Canada or went underground when drafted for military service. The conservatives (or traditionalists as they were sometimes called) also opposed the draft directed their efforts towards changing the law. In the end, the goals of both groups were achieved, and YAF was &quot;in the forefront of the drive to end the draft and create a volunteer military.&quot;

After 1969, the relationship between conservatives and libertarians in YAF was often rocky. A majority of members identified themselves simply as conservative, but some identified as both conservative and libertarian, and still others identified themselves simply as libertarian. From time to time, power struggles broke out; when this happened, the libertarians almost always ended up losing. In later years, new viewpoints would be amalgamated by the conservative movement, including neoconservatism in the early 1970s, the New Right in the late 1970s and the Religious Right in the 1980s. Some YAF members identified with some of these philosophies, others opposed them and still others were content to simply identify themselves as conservative without further specificity.

<text>Peter William Ham (27 April 1947 – 24 April 1975) was a Welsh singer, songwriter and guitarist best known as a lead vocalist of and composer for the 1970s rock band Badfinger, whose hit songs include &quot;No Matter What&quot;, &quot;Day After Day&quot; and &quot;Baby Blue&quot;. He also co-wrote the ballad &quot;Without You&quot;, a worldwide number-one hit for Harry Nilsson that has become a standard covered by hundreds of artists. Ham was granted two Ivor Novello Awards related to the song in 1973.

Ham died by suicide in 1975 at the age of 27, after Badfinger was financially ruined by their fraudulent manager Stan Polley. Tom Evans, co-lead singer and songwriter for Badfinger, also died by suicide, in 1983. 

== Early life ==

Peter William Ham was born in Swansea, Wales. The youngest child of William and Catherine (maiden name Tanner) Ham, he had three siblings, John (1937-2015), Irene (1943-1991), and William (born 1935), who died during infancy. William was born in 1908 and worked as a ship painter at the Swansea docks; he died in 1985. Catherine was born in 1912 and worked as a plate opener in the tinplate works; she died in 1976, a year after Peter.

Ham grew up in Gwent Gardens, at the foot of the Townhill estate. He attended Gors Junior School, and showed early signs of musical talent. He frequently played harmonica on the school playground. His older brother John was a jazz trumpeter, and encouraged young Ham to enter the Swansea music scene. One of Pete&#x27;s first jobs was as an apprentice television and radio engineer.

== Career ==
He formed a local rock group called The Panthers circa 1961. This group would undergo several name and line-up changes before it became The Iveys in 1965. In 1968, The Iveys came to the attention of Mal Evans (The Beatles&#x27; personal assistant) and were eventually signed to the Beatles&#x27; Apple Records label after approval from all four Beatles, who were reportedly impressed by the band&#x27;s songwriting abilities.

The Iveys changed their name to Badfinger with the single release of &quot;Come and Get It&quot;, a composition written by Paul McCartney that became a worldwide top-ten hit. 

Ham had initially protested against using a non-original to promote the band, as he had gained confidence in the group&#x27;s compositions, but he was quickly convinced of the springboard effect of having a likely hit single. His own creative perseverance paid off eventually, as his &quot;No Matter What&quot; became another top-ten worldwide hit in late 1970. He followed up with two more worldwide hits in &quot;Day After Day&quot; and &quot;Baby Blue&quot;.

Ham&#x27;s greatest songwriting success came with his co-written composition with bandmate Tom Evans called &quot;Without You&quot; – a worldwide number-one when it was later covered by Harry Nilsson and released in 1971. The song has since become a standard and has been covered by hundreds of singers, most notably Mariah Carey who made it a worldwide hit again in 1994. An Ivor Novello award for Song of the Year was issued in 1973 along with Grammy nominations. 
George Harrison used Ham&#x27;s talents for a number of album sessions, including on the &quot;All Things Must Pass&quot; album and for other Apple Records artist&#x27;s recordings. This friendship culminated with Ham&#x27;s acoustic guitar duet on &quot;Here Comes the Sun&quot; with Harrison at The Concert for Bangladesh in 1971, documented in the theatrical film of the concert. In 1972, Badfinger was picked up by Warner Bros. Records, as the Apple Records label was crumbling and it seemed the band was primed for major recognition.Warner Bros. Records sued Badfinger&#x27;s business manager, Stan Polley, after an advance vanished. With their current album suddenly withdrawn and their follow-up rejected, Badfinger spent the early months of 1975 trying to figure out how to proceed under the unclear legal situation. Their March 1975 salary cheques did not clear, and the April cheques never arrived. Panic set in, especially for Ham, who had recently bought a £30,000 house in Woking, Surrey, and whose girlfriend was expecting a child. According to 1974–1975 bandmate Bob Jackson, the band tried to continue without Polley&#x27;s involvement by contacting booking agents and prospective managers throughout London, but they were routinely declined because of their restrictive contracts with Polley and impending legal actions. Ham reportedly tried on many occasions to contact Polley by telephone during the early months of 1975, but he was never able to reach him.

== Personal life ==
Ham was in a relationship with Anne Ferguson, who was eight months pregnant at the time of his suicide. They both lived in Surrey. Ham&#x27;s only child, a daughter called Petera, was born after his death. She lives in Glasgow, Scotland, as of 2013. In 2000, Anne and Tom Evans&#x27; widow, with Gibbins and Collins, went to court to pursue unpaid royalties.

== Death ==
On the night of 23 April 1975, Ham received a phone call from the United States, telling him that all his money had disappeared. Later that night, he met Tom Evans and they went to The White Hart Pub in Surrey together, where Ham drank ten whiskies. Evans drove him home at three o&#x27;clock on the morning of 24 April 1975. 

Ham hanged himself in his garage studio in Woking later that morning, just three days shy of his 28th birthday. His suicide note — addressed to his girlfriend, Anne Herriot; and her son, Blair — blamed Polley for much of his despair and inability to cope with his disappointments in life. The note read: 
Ham had shown growing signs of mental illness over the preceding months, with Gibbins remembering Ham burning his hands and arms with cigarettes. Ham was cremated at the Morriston Crematorium, Swansea; his ashes were spread in the memorial gardens. Ham&#x27;s daughter, Petera, was born one month after his death. In May, Warner Bros terminated its contract with Badfinger, and Badfinger dissolved. Around that time, Apple also deleted all of Badfinger&#x27;s albums from its catalogue.

== Legacy ==
Ham is often credited as being one of the earliest purveyors of the power pop genre. His most widespread effect in popular music was with the ballad &quot;Without You&quot;, which he wrote with Badfinger bandmate Tom Evans. Collections of Ham&#x27;s home demo recordings have been released posthumously: 1997&#x27;s &quot;7 Park Avenue&quot;, 1999&#x27;s &quot;Golders Green&quot;, and 2013&#x27;s &quot;The Keyhole Street Demos 1966–67&quot;. In 2022 Ham&#x27;s &quot;Demos Variety Pack&quot; was released.

=== Blue Plaque ===
On 27 April 2013 (what would have been Ham&#x27;s 66th birthday), an official blue plaque was unveiled by Swansea City Council to honour him in his hometown. The unveiling was attended by two former members of the original Badfinger band, The Iveys: Ron Griffiths and David Jenkins, plus former Badfinger member Bob Jackson. The plaque honoured Ham and all the Iveys and Badfinger members of his lifetime. The ceremony was followed by a concert featuring former Badfinger members Bob Jackson and Al Wodtke.

The plaque was attached to the exterior of High Street Train Station because of its proximity to the adjacent Ivey Place where the band would meet to practice.

This plaque, written in English with selected word(s) translated into Welsh reads:

<text>James Homer Wright (April 8, 1869 – January 3, 1928) was an early and influential American pathologist, who was chief of pathology at Massachusetts General Hospital from 1896 to 1926. Wright was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

In 1915, he joined with Richard C. Cabot to begin publication of the &quot;Case Records of the Massachusetts General Hospital&quot;. These began regular publication as the &quot;Boston Medical and Surgical Journal&quot; which later became the &quot;New England Journal of Medicine&quot;.

In 1924, Wright, along with Frank B. Mallory, published &quot;Pathological Technique: A Practical Manual for the Pathological Laboratory&quot;. The book saw eight editions and for many years was the standard textbook in the field.

<text>Rib Mountain, also known as Rib Hill, is a glacially-eroded monadnock in central Wisconsin, located in the Town of Rib Mountain in Marathon County. Composed of quartzite covered with a softer syenite sheath, it was intruded about 1.5 billion years ago.

Rib Mountain is near Wausau on the west side of the Wisconsin River, just west of Interstate 39 and just south of Highway 29. The nearby Wausau Downtown Airport at an elevation of , is located just to the east.

Rib Mountain is almost long and peaks at above sea level and above the local terrain. The Rib River and Little Rib River are nearby.

Rib Mountain is home to the Rib Mountain State Park and the Granite Peak Ski Area. The peak is also the site of transmitters for radio and TV stations in the Wausau area, and is the namesake for Wisconsin Public Television&#x27;s WHRM-TV (Channel 20) and WHRM-FM (90.9), Wisconsin Public Radio&#x27;s news and classical network station for the area.

It also makes room for the transmitter at the top for WDEZ.

Local legend states that the &quot;ribs&quot; in Rib Mountain denote that it is the burial site of Paul Bunyan. The nearby Mosinee Hill is said to be the grave of Babe the Blue Ox.

When the ski area opened on the slopes of Rib Mountain in 1937, it was one of the first ski areas in North America. Stowe Mountain Resort in Vermont had opened a few years earlier in 1934. Sun Valley in Idaho had become the nation&#x27;s first ski area in the western states in 1936.

<doc id="450634" wikidata="Q729794" url="?curid=450634" title="Pleasantville (film)">
<text>Pleasantville is a 1998 American teen fantasy comedy-drama film written, co-produced, and directed by Gary Ross (in his directorial debut). It stars Tobey Maguire, Jeff Daniels, Joan Allen, William H. Macy, J. T. Walsh, and Reese Witherspoon, with Don Knotts, Paul Walker, Marley Shelton, and Jane Kaczmarek in supporting roles. The story centers on two siblings who wind up trapped in a 1950s TV show, set in a small Midwest town, where residents are seemingly perfect.

The film was one of J. T. Walsh&#x27;s final performances and was dedicated to his memory. It was also the final on-screen film appearance of Don Knotts, who would subsequently take on voice acting roles until his death.

==Plot==
In 1998, while their mother is away, high school-aged twin siblings David and Jennifer fight over the television, breaking the remote control. A mysterious TV repairman suddenly arrives and, impressed by David&#x27;s knowledge and love of &quot;Pleasantville&quot;, a black-and-white 1950s sitcom about the idyllic Parker family, gives him an unusual remote control before departing. When they use it, David and Jennifer are transported into the Parkers&#x27; house, in &quot;Pleasantville&quot;&#x27;s black-and-white world. George and Betty Parker believe them to be their children, Bud and Mary Sue. Communicating through the Parkers&#x27; television, David tries to reason with the repairman, who is offended that they want to come home, thinking they should be lucky to live in Pleasantville.

There, fire is impossible to start (firefighters merely rescue cats from trees), and everyone is unaware that anything exists outside of Pleasantville, as all roads circle back into it. David tells Jennifer they must play the show&#x27;s characters and not disrupt Pleasantville, but she rebelliously goes on a date with Mary Sue&#x27;s boyfriend, Skip Martin, the most popular boy in school. She has sex with Skip, who is shocked by the experience, which leads to the first bursts of color appearing in town.

Bill Johnson, owner of the malt shop where Bud works, experiences an existential crisis after realizing the repetitive nature of his life. David tries to help him break out of his routine and notices an attraction between Bill and Betty.

As Jennifer influences other teenagers, parts of Pleasantville become colorized, including some of the residents. Books in the library, previously blank, begin to fill with words after David and Jennifer summarize the plot to their classmates. When Jennifer gives a curious Betty an explanation about sex and tells her how to masturbate, Betty has an orgasm that results in her colorization and a fire in a tree outside.

Other foreign concepts, such as rain, begin to appear. David shows Bill a book of modern art, which inspires him to begin painting and to pursue a romance with Betty. Jennifer loses interest in sex and partying and becomes colorized after finding passion in literature. David pursues a romance with Margaret but is confused and disappointed to find he is still black and white.

Betty leaves George to be with Bill, bewildering him. The town leaders, including the mayor, Big Bob, and others who remain black and white are suspicious of all of these changes and begin to discriminate against the &quot;colored&quot; people, considering them a threat to Pleasantville&#x27;s values.

A riot is ignited by Bill&#x27;s nude painting of Betty on the window of his malt shop. The shop is destroyed, books are burned and colored people are harassed in the street. David defends Betty from a gang of teenage boys. Punching one of them, David scares the rest away, demonstrating newfound courage that turns him colored.

The town council establishes a code of conduct that, among other things, bans colored citizens from public venues, closes Lover&#x27;s Lane, and outlaws reading, rock music and using colorful paint. In protest, David and Bill paint a colorful mural outside the soda fountain depicting the beauty of love, sex, rain, music and literature. They are arrested and brought to trial in front of the entire town. David confronts George about losing Betty, persuading him to tearfully admit he does not just miss the cooking and the cleaning. George becomes colorized along with the rest of the town, except for Big Bob, who refuses to change his ways. After David drives him into a rage by suggesting that one day women may end up going to work while men stay home to cook and clean, Big Bob finally turns colorful before fleeing in shame.

The town celebrates their victory, and color televisions start being sold. They broadcast new programs and footage of other countries. The town&#x27;s roads also start leading to other cities. With Pleasantville changed, Jennifer chooses to continue her new life in the TV world. Bidding farewell to her, Margaret and Betty, David uses the remote control to return to the real world, where only an hour has passed since his disappearance. He comforts his mother, who had left to meet a man only to get cold feet, and assures her that nothing has to be perfect. In Pleasantville, citizens enjoy their lives, and Jennifer attends college.

==Cast==
==Production==
This was the first time that a new feature film was created by scanning and digitizing recorded film footage for the purpose of removing or manipulating colors. The black-and-white-meets-color world portrayed in the movie was filmed entirely in color; in all, approximately 163,000 frames of 35 mm footage were scanned, in order to selectively desaturate and adjust contrast digitally. The scanning was done in Los Angeles by Cinesite, utilizing a Spirit DataCine for scanning at 2K resolution and a MegaDef Colour Correction System from Pandora International. Principal photography took place from March 1 to July 2, 1997.

The death of camera operator Brent Hershman, who fell asleep driving home after a 19-hour workday on the set of the film, resulted in a wrongful death suit, claiming that New Line Cinema, New Line Productions and Juno Pix Inc. were responsible for the death as a result of the lengthy work hours imposed on the set. In response to Hershman&#x27;s death, crew members launched a petition for &#x27;Brent’s Rule&#x27;, which would limit workdays to a maximum of 14 hours; the petition was ultimately unsuccessful.

The film is dedicated to Hershman, as well as to director Ross&#x27;s mother, Gail, and actor J. T. Walsh, who also died before the film&#x27;s release.

Shortly before and during the film&#x27;s release, an online contest was held to visit the real Pleasantville, Iowa. Over 30,000 people entered. The winner, who remained anonymous, declined the trip and opted to receive the $10,000 cash prize instead.

==Themes==
Director Gary Ross stated, &quot;This movie is about the fact that personal repression gives rise to larger political oppression...That when we&#x27;re afraid of certain things in ourselves or we&#x27;re afraid of change, we project those fears on to other things, and a lot of very ugly social situations can develop.&quot;

Robert Beuka says in his book &quot;SuburbiaNation&quot;, &quot;&quot;Pleasantville&quot; is a morality tale concerning the values of contemporary suburban America by holding that social landscape up against both the Utopian and the dystopian visions of suburbia that emerged in the 1950s.&quot;

Robert McDaniel of &quot;Film &amp; History&quot; described the town as the perfect place, &quot;It never rains, the highs and lows rest at 72 degrees, the fire department exists only to rescue treed cats, and the basketball team never misses the hoop.&quot; However, McDaniel says, &quot;Pleasantville is a false hope. David&#x27;s journey tells him only that there is no &#x27;right&#x27; life, no model for how things are &#x27;supposed to be&#x27;.&quot;

Warren Epstein of &quot;The Gazette&quot; wrote, &quot;This use of color as a metaphor in black-and-white films certainly has a rich tradition, from the over-the-rainbow land in &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; to the girl in the red dress who made the Holocaust real for Oskar Schindler in &quot;Schindler&#x27;s List&quot;. In &quot;Pleasantville&quot;, color represents the transformation from repression to enlightenment. People—and their surroundings—change from black-and-white to color when they connect with the essence of who they really are.&quot;

== Reception ==

===Box office===
&quot;Pleasantville&quot; earned $8.9 million during its opening weekend. It would ultimately earn a total of $40.8 million against a $60 million budget making it a box office flop, despite the critical success.

===Critical reception===
&quot;Pleasantville&quot; received positive reviews from critics. Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes gave the film an 86% rating from 97 reviews, an average rating of 7.7/10, with the critical consensus: &quot;Filled with lighthearted humor, timely social commentary, and dazzling visuals, &quot;Pleasantville&quot; is an artful blend of subversive satire and well-executed Hollywood formula.&quot; Metacritic assigned a score of 71 based on 32 reviews. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Roger Ebert gave the film four out of four, calling it &quot;one of the best and most original films of the year&quot;. Janet Maslin wrote that its &quot;ingenious fantasy&quot; has &quot;seriously belabored its once-gentle metaphor and light comic spirit&quot;. Peter M. Nichols, judging the film for its child-viewing worthiness, jokingly wrote in &quot;The New York Times&quot; that the town of Pleasantville &quot;makes &quot;Father Knows Best&quot; look like &quot;Dallas&quot;&quot;. Joe Leydon of &quot;Variety&quot; called it &quot;a provocative, complex and surprisingly anti-nostalgic parable wrapped in the beguiling guise of a commercial high-concept comedy&quot;. He commented that some storytelling problems emerge late in the film, but wrote that &quot;Ross is to be commended for refusing to take the easy way out&quot;.

&quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; wrote a mixed review: &quot;&quot;Pleasantville&quot; is ultramodern and beautiful. But technical elegance and fine performances mask the shallowness of a story as simpleminded as the &#x27;50s TV to which it condescends; certainly it&#x27;s got none of the depth, poignance, and brilliance of &quot;The Truman Show&quot;, the recent TV-is-stifling drama that immediately comes to mind.&quot; Dave Rettig of &quot;Christian Answers&quot; said: &quot;On a surface level, the message of the film appears to be &#x27;morality is black and white and pleasant, but sin is color and better,&#x27; because often through the film the Pleasantvillians become color after sin (adultery, premarital sex, physical assault, etc...). In one scene in particular, a young woman shows a brightly colored apple to young (and not yet colored) David, encouraging him to take and eat it. Very reminiscent of the Genesis&#x27;s account of the fall of man.&quot;

&quot;Time Out New York&quot; reviewer Andrew Johnston observed, &quot;&quot;Pleasantville&quot; doesn&#x27;t have the consistent internal logic that great fantasies require, and Ross just can&#x27;t resist spelling everything out for the dim bulbs in the audience. That&#x27;s a real drag, because the film&#x27;s fundamental premise—crossing America&#x27;s nostalgia fixation with Pirandello and the Oz/Narnia/Wonderland archetype—is so damn cool, the film really should have been a masterpiece.&quot;

Jesse Walker, writing a retrospective in the January 2010 issue of &quot;Reason&quot;, argued that the film was misunderstood as a tale of kids from the 1990s bringing life into the conformist world of the 1950s. Walker points out that the supposedly outside influences changing the town of Pleasantville—the civil rights movement, J. D. Salinger, modern art, premarital sex, cool jazz and rockabilly—were all present in the 1950s. &quot;Pleasantville&quot; &quot;contrasts the faux &#x27;50s of our TV-fueled nostalgia with the social ferment that was actually taking place while those sanitized shows first aired&quot;.

Filmmaker Jon M. Chu cited the film, alongside &quot;The Truman Show&quot; (also released in 1998), as an influence on how the Land of Oz is thematically portrayed in the two-part film adaptation of the musical &quot;Wicked&quot; (2024-2025), saying &quot;It helps create this idea of the rebelliousness that this new younger generation are discovering ... How far will that take everybody in Oz throughout the course of the whole story of both movies? It&#x27;s an awakening of a generation. You start to see the truth about things that maybe you were taught differently.&quot;

===Accolades===
== Soundtrack ==
The soundtrack features music from the 1950s and 1960s such as &quot;Be-Bop-A-Lula&quot; by Gene Vincent, &quot;Take Five&quot; by The Dave Brubeck Quartet, &quot;So What&quot; by Miles Davis and &quot;At Last&quot; by Etta James. The main score was composed by Randy Newman; he received an Oscar nomination in the original music category. A score release is also in distribution, although the suite track is only available on the standard soundtrack. Among the &quot;Pleasantville&quot; DVD &quot;Special Features&quot; is a music-only feature with commentary by Randy Newman.

The music video for Fiona Apple&#x27;s version of &quot;Across the Universe&quot;, directed by Paul Thomas Anderson, uses the set of the diner from the film. AllMusic rated the album two-and-a-half stars out of five.

<doc id="450636" wikidata="Q237883" url="?curid=450636" title="Quartzite">
<text>Quartzite is a hard, non-foliated metamorphic rock which was originally pure quartz sandstone. Sandstone is converted into quartzite through heating and pressure usually related to tectonic compression within orogenic belts. Pure quartzite is usually white to grey, though quartzites often occur in various shades of pink and red due to varying amounts of hematite. Other colors, such as yellow, green, blue and orange, are due to other minerals.

The term &quot;quartzite&quot; is also sometimes used for very hard but unmetamorphosed sandstones that are composed of quartz grains thoroughly cemented with additional quartz. Such sedimentary rock has come to be described as orthoquartzite to distinguish it from metamorphic quartzite, which is sometimes called metaquartzite to emphasize its metamorphic origins.

Quartzite is very resistant to chemical weathering and often forms ridges and resistant hilltops. The nearly pure silica content of the rock provides little material for soil; therefore, the quartzite ridges are often bare or covered only with a very thin layer of soil and little (if any) vegetation. Some quartzites contain just enough weather-susceptible nutrient-bearing minerals such as carbonates and chlorite to form a loamy, fairly fertile though shallow and stony soil.

Quartzite has been used since prehistoric times for stone tools. It is presently used for decorative dimension stone, as crushed stone in highway construction, and as a source of silica for production of silicon and silicon compounds.

==Characteristics and origin==
Quartzite is a very hard rock composed predominantly of an interlocking mosaic of quartz crystals. The grainy, sandpaper-like surface is glassy in appearance. Minor amounts of former cementing materials, iron oxide, silica, carbonate and clay, often migrate during recrystallization, causing streaks and lenses to form within the quartzite. To be classified as a quartzite by the British Geological Survey, a metamorphic rock must contain at least 80% quartz by volume.

Quartzite is commonly regarded as metamorphic in origin. When sandstone is subjected to the great heat and pressure associated with regional metamorphism, the individual quartz grains recrystallize along with the former cementing material. Most or all of the original texture and sedimentary structures of the sandstone are erased by the metamorphism. The recrystallized quartz grains are roughly equal in size, forming what is called a granoblastic texture, and they also show signs of metamorphic annealing, in which the grains become coarser and acquire a more polygonal texture. The grains are so tightly interlocked that when the rock is broken, it fractures through the grains to form an irregular or conchoidal fracture.

Geologists had recognized by 1941 that some rocks show the macroscopic characteristics of quartzite, even though they have not undergone metamorphism at high pressure and temperature. These rocks have been subject only to the much lower temperatures and pressures associated with diagenesis of sedimentary rock, but diagenesis has cemented the rock so thoroughly that microscopic examination is necessary to distinguish it from metamorphic quartize. The term &quot;orthoquartzite&quot; is used to distinguish such sedimentary rock from &quot;metaquartzite&quot; produced by metamorphism. By extension, the term &quot;orthoquartzite&quot; has occasionally been more generally applied to any quartz-cemented quartz arenite. Orthoquartzite (in the narrow sense) is often 99% SiO2 with only very minor amounts of iron oxide and trace resistant minerals such as zircon, rutile and magnetite. Although few fossils are normally present, the original texture and sedimentary structures are preserved.

The typical distinction between a true orthoquartzite and an ordinary quartz sandstone is that an orthoquartzite is so highly cemented that it will fracture across grains, not around them. This is a distinction that can be recognized in the field. In turn, the distinction between an orthoquartzite and a metaquartzite is the onset of recrystallization of existing grains. The dividing line may be placed at the point where strained quartz grains begin to be replaced by new, unstrained, small quartz grains, producing a &quot;mortar texture&quot; that can be identified in thin sections under a polarizing microscope. With increasing grade of metamorphism, further recrystallization produces &quot;foam texture&quot;, characterized by polygonal grains meeting at triple junctions, and then &quot;porphyroblastic texture&quot;, characterized by coarse, irregular grains, including some larger grains (porphyroblasts).

==Occurrence==

In the United States, formations of quartzite can be found in some parts of Pennsylvania, the Washington DC area, eastern South Dakota, Central Texas, southwest Minnesota, Devil&#x27;s Lake State Park in the Baraboo Range in Wisconsin, the Wasatch Range in Utah, near Salt Lake City, Utah and as resistant ridges in the Appalachians and other mountain regions. Quartzite is also found in the Morenci Copper Mine in Arizona. The town of Quartzsite in western Arizona derives its name from the quartzites in the nearby mountains in both Arizona and Southeastern California. A glassy &quot;vitreous quartzite&quot; has been described from the Belt Supergroup in the Coeur d’Alene district of northern Idaho.

In Canada, the La Cloche Mountains in Ontario are composed primarily of white quartzite. Vast areas of Nova Scotia are underlain by quartzite.

Paleoproterozoic quartzite-rhyolite successions are common in the Precambrian basement rock of western North America. The quartzites in these successions are interpreted as sedimentary beds deposited atop older greenstone belts. The quartzite-rhyolite successions may record the formation of back-arc basins along the margin of Laurentia, the ancient core of North America, between episodes of mountain building during the assembly of the continent. The quartzites are often nearly pure quartz, which is puzzling for sediments which must have eroded from igneous rock. Their purity may reflect unusual conditions of chemical weathering, at a time when the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere was beginning to be oxygenated.

In Ireland areas of quartzite are found across the west and northwest, with Errigal in County Donegal as the most prominent outcrop. A good example of a quartzite area is on the Corraun Peninsula in County Mayo, which has a very thin layer of Irish Atlantic Bog covering it.

In the United Kingdom, a craggy ridge of quartzite called the Stiperstones (early Ordovician – Arenig Epoch, 500 Ma) runs parallel with the Pontesford-Linley fault, 6 km north-west of the Long Mynd in south Shropshire. Also to be found in England are the Cambrian &quot;Wrekin quartzite&quot; (in Shropshire), and the Cambrian &quot;Hartshill quartzite&quot; (Nuneaton area). In Wales, Holyhead Mountain and most of Holy island off Anglesey sport excellent Precambrian quartzite crags and cliffs. In the Scottish Highlands, several mountains (e.g. Foinaven, Arkle) composed of Cambrian quartzite can be found in the far north-west Moine Thrust Belt running in a narrow band from Loch Eriboll in a south-westerly direction to Skye.

In continental Europe, various regionally isolated quartzite deposits exist at surface level in a belt from the Rhenish Massif and the German Central Highlands into the Western Czech Republic, for example in the Taunus and Harz mountains. In Poland, quartzite deposits at surface level exists in Świętokrzyskie Mountains. In Norway, deposits are quarried near Austertana, which is one of the largest quarries in the world at annually, and Mårnes near Sandhornøya with an output of annually. Deposits are also quarried in Kragerø Municipality, and several other deposits are known but not actively quarried.

The highest mountain in Mozambique, Monte Binga (2436 m), as well as the rest of the surrounding Chimanimani Plateau are composed of very hard, pale grey, Precambrian quartzite. Quartzite is also mined in Brazil for use in kitchen countertops.

==Uses==
Quartzite is a decorative stone and may be used to cover walls, as roofing tiles, as flooring, and stairsteps. Its use for countertops in kitchens is expanding rapidly. It is harder and more resistant to stains than granite. Crushed quartzite is sometimes used in road construction. High purity quartzite is used to produce ferrosilicon, industrial silica sand, silicon and silicon carbide.
During the Paleolithic, quartzite was used, along with flint, quartz, and other lithic raw materials, for making stone tools. Prehistoric humans in the southeastern United States often made mortars out of quartzite stones.

==Safety==
As quartzite is a form of silica, it is a possible cause for concern in various workplaces. Cutting, grinding, chipping, sanding, drilling, and polishing natural and manufactured stone products can release hazardous levels of very small, crystalline silica dust particles into the air that workers breathe. Crystalline silica of respirable size is a recognized human carcinogen and may lead to other diseases of the lungs such as silicosis and pulmonary fibrosis.

==Etymology==
The term &quot;quartzite&quot; is derived from .

<doc id="450637" wikidata="Q2106260" url="?curid=450637" title="Ringback number">
<text>A ringback number is a telephone number for a telephone line that automatically calls the line that the call was placed from, after the caller has hung up. The typical use of this facility is by telephone company technicians for testing a new installation or for trouble-shooting.

==Operation==
Ringback testing is an acceptance testing procedure conducted by telephone installers to verify the quality of customer premises wiring to prevent network damage from faulty equipment or installation. The test consists of calling a &quot;reverting calling&quot; telephone number (&quot;ringback number&quot;) or a vertical service code with a standard telephone. Upon answering the call, the exchange plays a unique signal tone as a signal for the installer to hangup the telephone. The exchange then places a reverting call to the originating line, causing the telephone to ring. When answered, the exchange plays a verification tone. The verification tone is issued so that telephone subscribers cannot easily use the ringback system as an intercom between multiple stations in a residence on the same line by taking the stations off-hook.

Ringback numbers are typically not listed or communicated to subscribers.

==Coin telephones==
Narcotics trafficking and other criminal activity can use payphones to conduct crimes anonymously, so many payphones are not equipped with a ringer at all, or a quiet &quot;chirper&quot; solid state speaker and designated &quot;No Incoming Calls&quot;. All payphones in the United States must be assigned a telephone number in order to make calls, some can ring or chirp if that number is called. Many customer-owned coin-operated telephones (COCOT) answer the phone at first ring with a built in modem which can be accessed by technicians to report conditions and program function parameters, one programmable function is the number of rings until the modem answers, another is whether to impose an additional charge for incoming calls or even accept no incoming calls at all. Where a payphone does not have any number listed on the unit, the number can be discovered from that phone by calling an automatic number announcement circuit (ANAC) service or a telephone with caller ID. TelCo owned payphones are generally on dedicated payphone lines which respond to special tones and Custom Local Area Signaling Services codes such as *5055 for ringback.

== Examples ==
Some ringback numbers are local or regional in scope, while others are larger in scope. Every telephone company determines its own ringback numbers for each individual central office. Under the North American Numbering Plan, most North American area codes reserve telephone numbers beginning with &quot;958&quot; and &quot;959&quot; for internal testing. Some companies also reserve &quot;999&quot; for test exchanges. Numbers within these test exchange block ranges are used for various types of local and long-distance testing; generally, this block includes a ringback number (to test the ringer when installing telephone sets) and a loop around (which connects a call to another inbound call to the same or another test number). Ringback numbers may appear in the &quot;958&quot; exchange, but there is no requirement that they reside there.

Some large telephone companies have toll-free numbers set up for ringback. In most cases, these numbers remain undisclosed to prevent abuse. Some companies change their ringback number every month to maintain secrecy. Some carriers (such as Bell Canada) have been known to disable all payphone calls to 958 or 959 test lines.

4101 was formerly valid on some mechanical switching systems to allow a call to the other party on a two-party line. Like 4104 (repair, long replaced by 611 in most cities), it was once a standard number in many areas but has disappeared as this equipment (and the party line service itself) has been decommissioned.

In the 1970s and early 1980s, 1199011 was a number that when called would result in another dial tone. Afterwards, if the phone was hung up and then quickly picked up again in less than approximately 1/2 second (ie: a hook flash), a steady tone would then be heard (different from a regular dial tone). Hanging up the phone after this would result in a ring back. When the ring back was answered, the ring back process could be repeated by hanging up and lifting up the phone quickly again, and then hanging up.

Most other numbers listed for ringback are specific to one exchange or one telco; available lists tend to be outdated and unreliable. Many former test numbers (such as 320 and 999 in Bell Canada territory) have been reclaimed for use as standard landline or mobile exchange prefixes, with the test codes moved (usually) to the 958 exchange.

<doc id="450640" wikidata="Q1392475" url="?curid=450640" title="Simple past">
<text>The simple past, past simple, or past indefinite, in English equivalent to the preterite, is the basic form of the past tense in Modern English. It is used principally to describe events in the past, although it also has some other uses. Regular English verbs form the simple past in &quot;-ed&quot;; however, there are a few hundred irregular verbs with different forms.

The term &quot;simple&quot; is used to distinguish the syntactical construction whose basic form uses the plain past tense alone, from other past tense constructions which use auxiliaries in combination with participles, such as the present perfect, past perfect, and past progressive.

==Formation==
Regular verbs form the simple past end&quot;-ed&quot;; however there are a few hundred irregular verbs with different forms. The spelling rules for forming the past simple of regular verbs are as follows: verbs ending in -e add only –d to the end (e.g. live – lived, not *liveed), verbs ending in -y change to -ied (e.g. study – studied) and verbs ending in a group of a consonant + a vowel + a consonant double the final consonant (e.g. stop – stopped). For details see .

Most verbs have a single form of the simple past, independent of the person or number of the subject (there is no addition of &quot;-s&quot; for the third person singular as in the simple present). However, the copula verb &quot;be&quot; has two past tense forms: &quot;was&quot; for the first and third persons singular, and &quot;were&quot; in other instances. The form &quot;were&quot; can also be used in place of &quot;was&quot; in conditional clauses and the like; for information on this, see English subjunctive. This is the only case in modern English where a distinction in form is made between inversion, negations with &quot;not&quot;, and emphatic forms of the simple past use the auxiliary &quot;did&quot;. For details of this mechanism, see &quot;do&quot;-support. A full list of forms is given below, using the (regular) verb &quot;help&quot; as an example:
*Basic simple past:
**I/you/he/she/it/we/they helped
*Expanded (emphatic) simple past:
**I/you/he/she/it/we/they did help
*Question form:
**Did I/you/he/she/it/we/they help?
*Negative:
**I/you/he/she/it/we/they did not (didn&#x27;t) help
*Negative question:
**Did I/you/he/she/it/we/they not help? / Didn&#x27;t I/you/he/she/it/we/they help?

Base form

Affirmative (+)
S + verb(ed) + c

Negative (-)
S + did not ( didn&#x27;t) + verb + C

==Usage==
The simple past is used for a single event (or sequence of such events) in the past, and also for past habitual actions:
::He took the money and ran.
::I visited them every day for a year.

It can also refer to a past state:
::I knew how to fight even as a child.
For actions that were ongoing at the time referred to, the past progressive is generally used instead (e.g. &quot;I was cooking&quot;). The same can apply to states, if temporary (e.g. &quot;the ball was lying on the sidewalk&quot;), but some stative verbs do not generally use the progressive aspect at all, typically verbs of mental states (know, believe, need), of emotional states (love, dislike, prefer), of possession (have, own), of senses (hear) and some others (consist, exist, promise) – see – and in these cases the simple past is used even for a temporary state:
::The dog was in its kennel.
::I felt cold.
However, with verbs of sensing, it is common in such circumstances to use &quot;could see&quot; in place of &quot;saw&quot;, &quot;could hear&quot; in place of &quot;heard&quot;, etc. For more on this, see &quot;can see&quot;.

If one action interrupts another, then it is usual for the interrupted (ongoing) action to be expressed with the past progressive, and the action that interrupted it to be in the simple past:
::Your mother called while you &quot;were cooking&quot;.

The simple past is often close in meaning to the present perfect. The simple past is used when the event happened at a particular time in the past, or during a period which ended in the past (i.e. a period that does not last up until the present time). This time frame may be explicitly stated, or implicit in the context (for example the past tense is often used when describing a sequence of past events).
::I was born in 1980.
::We turned the oven off two minutes ago.
::I came home at 6 o&#x27;clock.
::When did they get married?
::We wrote two letters this morning.
::She placed the letter on the table, sighed, and left the house.

These examples can be contrasted with those given at . Also, for past actions that occurred &quot;before&quot; the relevant past time frame, the past perfect is used.

Various compound constructions exist for denoting past habitual action. The sentence &quot;When I was young, I played football every Saturday&quot; might alternatively be phrased using &quot;used to&quot; (&quot;... I used to play ...&quot;) or using &quot;would&quot; (&quot;... I would play...&quot;).

The simple past form also has some uses in which it does not refer to a past time. These are generally in condition clauses and some other dependent clauses referring to hypothetical circumstances, as well as certain expressions of wish:
:: If he walked faster, he would get home earlier. 
:: I wish I knew what his name was.
:: I would rather she wore a longer dress.
For more details see the sections on conditionals, dependent clauses and expressions of wish in the article on uses of English verb forms.

For use of the simple past (and other past tense forms) in indirect speech, see . An example:
::He said he wanted to go on the slide.

==Pronunciation of -ed==
The regular verbs ending with -ed are pronounced as follows:

* Regular verb endings with voiced consonants+/d/, e.g. &quot;hugged&quot; /hʌɡd/.

* Regular verb endings with unvoiced consonants+/t/, e.g. &quot;stopped&quot; /stɒpt/.

* Regular verb endings with /t/ or /d/ + /ɪd/, e.g. &quot;needed&quot; /niːdɪd/.

<text>Wojciech Fibak (; popularly Wojtek Fibak ; born 30 August 1952) is a Polish former professional tennis player, entrepreneur, and art collector. Fibak is best known for his doubles success with Dutch pro Tom Okker and Australian Kim Warwick, although he also reached the Top 10 in singles.

Throughout his career, he won 15 ATP career singles titles as well as 52 ATP doubles titles including one Grand Slam title, the 1978 Australian Open. He was also the runner-up at the 1976 ATP Finals.

==Biography and personal life==
Born in Poznań, Poland, he won his first tournament in 1976, and between then and 1982 won 15 singles titles and 52 doubles titles. His best year was arguably 1980, when he reached the quarter-finals at the French Open, the US Open and Wimbledon Championships. Fibak&#x27;s career singles win–loss record was 520–310, and he reached his career-high singles ranking of World No. 10 on 25 July 1977. His highest doubles ranking was World No. 2, which he reached in February 1979. He was consistently ranked in the top 20 in singles, and earned $2,725,403 in career prize money.

The highlight of his career was winning the Australian Open men&#x27;s doubles in 1978 with Kim Warwick. They beat Paul Kronk and Cliff Letcher 7–6, 7–5 to take the title.

In 1983 he was banned from his local Poznań tennis club and faced reduced involvement from the Polish Tennis Federation and Davis Cup national team for his opposition to the communist PZPR government.

In 1985, Fibak founded the Polish Tennis Club (Polish Tennis Association of Southern California); in the 1990s he was head of the Polish Tennis Federation and widely credited with popularising the sport in his native country. After the fall of communism in the early 1990s his company Fibak Press acquired the regional former PZPR mouthpiece &quot;Gazeta Poznańska&quot;, until it was acquired by rivals &quot;Głos Wielkopolski&quot; in 2006, and published several other newspapers and magazines as well as being involved in books related to tennis.

He is also a businessman and an avid art collector, and used his tennis fortune to open the art gallery Galeria Fibak in 2001.

Fibak divides his time between Warsaw and Monaco, where he was Poland&#x27;s honorary consul. He is a self-declared local patriot and was close to fellow local billionaire Jan Kulczyk.

He has three daughters: Agnieszka, Paulina, and Nina.

<text>The past tense is a grammatical tense whose function is to place an action or situation in the past. Examples of verbs in the past tense include the English verbs &quot;sang&quot;, &quot;went&quot; and &quot;washed&quot;. Most languages have a past tense, with some having several types in order to indicate how far back the action took place. Some languages have a compound past tense which uses auxiliary verbs as well as an imperfect tense which expresses continuous or repetitive events or actions. Some languages inflect the verb, which changes the ending to indicate the past tense, while non-inflected languages may use other words meaning, for example, &quot;yesterday&quot; or &quot;last week&quot; to indicate that something took place in the past.

== Introduction ==

In some languages, the grammatical expression of past tense is combined with the expression of other categories such as grammatical aspect (see tense–aspect). Thus a language may have several types of past tense form, their use depending on what aspectual or other additional information is to be encoded. French, for example, has a compound past &quot;(passé composé)&quot; for expressing completed events, and imperfect for continuous or repetitive events.

Some languages that grammaticalise for past tense do so by inflecting the verb, while others do so periphrastically using auxiliary verbs, also known as &quot;verbal operators&quot; (and some do both, as in the example of French given above). Not all languages grammaticalise verbs for past tense – Mandarin Chinese, for example, mainly uses lexical means (words like &quot;yesterday&quot; or &quot;last week&quot;) to indicate that something took place in the past, although use can also be made of the tense/aspect markers &quot;le&quot; and &quot;guo&quot;.

The &quot;past time&quot; to which the past tense refers generally means the past relative to the moment of speaking, although in contexts where relative tense is employed (as in some instances of indirect speech) it may mean the past relative to some other time being under discussion. A language&#x27;s past tense may also have other uses besides referring to past time; for example, in English and certain other languages, the past tense is sometimes used in referring to hypothetical situations, such as in condition clauses like &quot;If you loved me ...&quot;, where the past tense &quot;loved&quot; is used even though there may be no connection with past time.

Some languages grammatically distinguish the recent past from remote past with separate tenses. There may be more than two distinctions.

In some languages, certain past tenses can carry an implication that the result of the action in question no longer holds. For example, in the Bantu language Chichewa, use of the remote past tense &quot;ánáamwalíra&quot; &quot;he died&quot; would be surprising since it would imply that the person was no longer dead. This kind of past tense is known as discontinuous past. Similarly certain imperfective past tenses (such as the English &quot;used to&quot;) can carry an implication that the action referred to no longer takes place.

A general past tense can be indicated with the glossing abbreviation .

==Indo-European languages==
The European continent is heavily dominated by Indo-European languages, all of which have a past tense. In some cases the tense is formed inflectionally as in English &quot;see/saw&quot; or &quot;walks/walked&quot; and as in the French imperfect form, and sometimes it is formed periphrastically, as in the French &quot;passé composé&quot; form. Further, all of the non-Indo-European languages in Europe, such as Basque, Hungarian, and Finnish, also have a past tense.

===Germanic languages===

====English====
In English, the past tense (or preterite) is one of the inflected forms of a verb. The past tense of regular verbs is made by adding &quot;-d&quot; or &quot;-ed&quot; to the base form of the verb, while those of irregular verbs are formed in various ways (such as &quot;see→saw&quot;, &quot;go→went&quot;, &quot;be→was/were&quot;). With regular and some irregular verbs, the past tense form also serves as a past participle. For full details of past tense formation, see English verbs.

Past events are often referred to using the present perfect construction, as in &quot;I have finished&quot; (also known as &quot;present in past&quot;). However this is not regarded as an instance of the past tense; instead it is viewed as a combination of present tense with perfect aspect, specifying a present state that results from past action. (It can be made into a past tense form by replacing the auxiliary &quot;have&quot; with &quot;had&quot;; see below.)

Various multi-word constructions exist for combining past tense with progressive (continuous) aspect, which denotes ongoing action; with perfect aspect; and with progressive and perfect aspects together. These and other common past tense constructions are listed below.

*The simple past consists of just the past tense (preterite) form of the verb (&quot;he walked&quot;, &quot;they flew&quot;, etc.), although when it is negated, emphasized or inverted it is sometimes necessary to unfuse the verb, using a periphrastic construction with &quot;did&quot; (as in &quot;did he walk?&quot; etc.) – see &quot;do&quot;-support. The simple past is used for describing single occurrences or habitual occurrences in the past, and sometimes for states existing in the past with no connection to the present (or where such connection is irrelevant), and sometimes for states and sensual perceptions existing in the past.
*The past progressive (past continuous) is formed using the simple past of &quot;be&quot; (&quot;was&quot; or &quot;were&quot;) with present participle (sometimes referred to as the -ing form) of the main verb: &quot;He was going&quot;. This form indicates that an action was ongoing at the past time under consideration, often interrupted by another past action (as in I was having a shower when you called).
*The past perfect combines &quot;had&quot; (the simple past of &quot;have&quot;) with the past participle of the main verb: &quot;We had shouted&quot;. This denotes that an action occurred before a specified time in the past, and therefore has similar function to the pluperfect found in some languages.
*The past perfect progressive (sometimes referred to as the past perfect continuous) combines &quot;had&quot; (the simple past of &quot;have&quot;) with &quot;been&quot; (the past participle of &quot;be&quot;) and the present participle of the main verb: &quot;You had been waiting&quot;. It is used to refer to an ongoing action that continued up to the past time of reference.
*The expression &quot;used to&quot; (with the infinitive of the main verb) denotes a past habitual situation (&quot;I used to play football when I was young&quot;), although with a stative verb it can just indicate that a state was continuously in effect (&quot;I used to belong to that club&quot;). It is often used to emphasize that something happened a long time ago and is no longer the case. Another way of referring to past habitual action is to use &quot;would&quot;, as in &quot;As a child I would play the piano every day&quot;, although this auxiliary has other uses as well. For further details see English modal verbs.

For details of the usage of the various constructions used to refer to the past, see Uses of English verb forms. The past tense is also used in referring to some hypothetical situations, not necessarily connected with past time, as in &quot;if I tried&quot; or &quot;I wish I knew&quot;. (For the possible use of &quot;were&quot; in place of &quot;was&quot; in such instances, see English subjunctive.)

====German====
German uses three forms for the past tense.
*The preterite (&quot;Präteritum&quot;) (called the &quot;imperfect&quot; in older grammar books, but this, a borrowing from Latin terminology, ill describes it.)
*The perfect (&quot;Perfekt&quot;)
*The past perfect (&quot;Plusquamperfekt&quot;)
In southern Germany, Austria and Switzerland, the preterite is mostly used solely in writing, for example in stories. Use in speech is regarded as snobbish and thus very uncommon. South German dialects, such as the Bavarian dialect, as well as Yiddish and Swiss German, have no preterite (with the exception of &quot;sein&quot; and &quot;wollen&quot;), but only perfect constructs.
In certain regions, a few specific verbs are used in the preterite, for instance the modal verbs and the verbs &quot;haben&quot; (have) and &quot;sein&quot; (be).
* Es gab einmal ein kleines Mädchen, das Rotkäppchen hieß. (There &quot;was&quot; once a small girl who &quot;was called&quot; Little Red Riding Hood.)
In speech and informal writing, the &quot;Perfekt&quot; is used (e.g., Ich &quot;habe&quot; dies und das &quot;gesagt&quot;. (I said this and that)).
However, in the oral mode of North Germany, there is still a very important difference between the preterite and the perfect, and both tenses are consequently very common. The preterite is used for past actions when the focus is on the action, whilst the present perfect is used for past actions when the focus is on the present state of the subject as a result of a previous action. This is somewhat similar to the English usage of the preterite and the present perfect.
* Preterite: &quot;Heute früh &quot;kam&quot; mein Freund.&quot; (my friend came early in the morning, and he is being talked about strictly in the past)
* Perfect: &quot;Heute früh &quot;ist&quot; mein Freund &quot;gekommen&quot;.&quot; (my friend came early in the morning, but he is being talked about in the present)
The past perfect is used in every German speaking country and it is used to place an action in the past before another action in the past. It is formed with an auxiliary (haben/sein) and a past participle that is placed at the end of the clause.

==== Dutch ====
Dutch mainly uses these two past tenses:
* &quot;onvoltooid verleden tijd&quot;, which matches the English simple past and the German preterite, for example: &quot;Gisteren was ik daar&quot; (&quot;I was there yesterday&quot;).
* &quot;voltooid tegenwoordige tijd&quot;, a present tense with the meaning of perfect. This form is made by combining a form of &quot;zijn&quot; (&quot;to be&quot;) or &quot;hebben&quot; (&quot;to have&quot;) with the notional verb, for example: &quot;Gisteren ben ik daar geweest&quot;. This also means &quot;I was there yesterday&quot;, but just as it is the case for English constructions with the present perfect simple, this kind of formulation puts more emphasis on the &quot;being finished&quot;-aspect.

Less common is the &quot;voltooid verleden tijd&quot;, which corresponds to the English past perfect. It is formed by combining an &quot;onvoltooid verleden&quot; form of &quot;zijn&quot; (&quot;to be&quot;) or &quot;hebben&quot; (&quot;to have&quot;) with the notional verb, for example: &quot;Ik was daar voor gisteren al geweest.&quot; This means &quot;I had been there before yesterday.&quot; This tense is used to indicate that one action in the past occurred before another past action, and that the action was fully finished before the second action took place.

===Other groups===
In non-Germanic Indo-European languages, past marking is typically combined with a distinction between perfective and imperfective aspect, with the former reserved for single completed actions in the past. French for instance, has an imperfect tense form similar to that of German but used only for past habitual or past progressive contexts like &quot;I used to...&quot; or &quot;I was doing...&quot;. Similar patterns extend across most languages of the Indo-European family right through to the Indic languages.

Unlike other Indo-European languages, in Slavic languages tense is independent of aspect, with imperfective and perfective aspects being indicated instead by means of prefixes, stem changes, or suppletion. In many West Slavic and East Slavic languages, the early Slavic past tenses have largely merged into a single past tense. In both West and East Slavic, verbs in the past tense are conjugated for gender (masculine, feminine, neuter) and number (singular, plural).

====Romance====

=====French=====

French has numerous forms of the past tense including but not limited to:
*Past perfective (&quot;passé composé&quot;) e.g. &quot;J&#x27;ai mangé&quot; (&quot;I ate&quot; or &quot;I have eaten&quot;, using the form but usually not the meaning of &quot;I have eaten&quot;)
*Past imperfective (&quot;imparfait&quot;) e.g. &quot;Je mangeais&quot; (&quot;I was eating&quot;)
*Past historic or Simple past (&quot;passé simple&quot;) e.g. &quot;Je mangeai&quot; (&quot;I ate&quot;) (literary only)
*Pluperfect (&quot;Plus que parfait&quot;) e.g. &quot;J&#x27;avais mangé&quot; (&quot;I had eaten&quot; [before another event in the past])
*Recent past (&quot;passé recent&quot;) e.g. &quot;Je viens de manger&quot; (&quot;I just ate&quot; or &quot;I have just eaten&quot;)

=====Spanish and Portuguese=====
Spanish and Portuguese have several forms of the past tense, which include but are not limited to:
*Preterite tense (&quot;préterito, pretérito&quot;) e.g. &quot;Yo comí&quot; and &quot;Eu comi&quot; (&quot;I ate&quot; or &quot;I have eaten&quot;)
*Past imperfective (&quot;imperfecto, imperfeito&quot;) e.g. &quot;Yo comía&quot; and &quot;Eu comia&quot; (&quot;I was eating&quot;)
*Pluperfect (&quot;pluperfecto, mais-que-perfeito&quot;) e.g. &quot;Yo había comido&quot; or &quot;Yo hube comido&quot; and &quot;Eu comera&quot; or &quot;Eu tinha comido&quot; (&quot;I had eaten&quot; [before another event in the past])

A difference in the pluperfect occurs between Spanish and Portuguese; in the latter, a synthetic pluperfect exists which follows the imperfect conjugations, but -ra replaces the -va seen in the verb endings.

==African languages==
While in Semitic languages tripartite non-past/past imperfective/past perfective systems similar to those of most Indo-European languages are found, in the rest of Africa past tenses have very different forms from those found in European languages. Berber languages have only the perfective/imperfective distinction and lack a past imperfect.

Many non-Bantu Niger–Congo languages of West Africa do not mark past tense at all 
but instead have a form of perfect derived from a word meaning &quot;to finish&quot;. Others, such as Ewe, distinguish only between future and non-future.

In complete contrast, Bantu languages such as Zulu have not only a past tense, but also a less remote &quot;proximal tense&quot; which is used for very recent past events and is never interchangeable with the ordinary past form. These languages also differ substantially from European languages in coding tense with prefixes instead of such suffixes as English &quot;-ed&quot;.

Other, smaller language families of Africa follow quite regional patterns. Thus the Sudanic languages of East Africa and adjacent Afro-Asiatic families are part of the same area with inflectional past-marking that extends into Europe, whereas more westerly Nilo-Saharan languages often do not have past tense.

==Asian languages==
Past tenses are found in a variety of Asian languages. These include the Indo-European languages Russian in North Asia and Persian, Urdu, Nepali and Hindi in Southwest and South Asia; the Turkic languages Turkish, Turkmen, Kazakh, and Uyghur of Southwest and Central Asia; Arabic and Hebrew in Southwest Asia; Japanese; the Dravidian languages of India; the Uralic languages of Russia; Mongolic; and Korean. Languages in East Asia and Southeast Asia typically do not distinguish tense; in Mandarin Chinese, for example, the particle 了&quot;le&quot; when used immediately after a verb instead indicates perfective aspect.

In parts of islands in Southeast Asia, even less distinction is made, for instance in Indonesian and some other Austronesian languages. Past tenses, do, however, exist in most Oceanic languages.

==The Americas==
Among Native American languages there is a split between complete absence of past marking (especially common in Mesoamerica and the Pacific Northwest) and very complex tense marking with numerous specialised remoteness distinctions, as found for instance in Athabaskan languages and a few languages of the Amazon Basin. Some of these tenses can have specialised mythological significance and uses.

A number of Native American languages like Northern Paiute stand in contrast to European notions of tense because they always use relative tense, which means time relative to a reference point that may not coincide with the time an utterance is made.

==New Guinea==
Papuan languages of New Guinea almost always have remoteness distinctions in the past tense (though none are as elaborate as some Native American languages), whilst indigenous Australian languages usually have a single past tense without remoteness distinctions.

==Creole languages==
Creole languages tend to make tense marking optional, and when tense is marked invariant pre-verbal markers are used.

===Belizean Creole===
In Belizean Creole, past tense marking is optional and is rarely used if a semantic temporal marker such as &quot;yestudeh&quot; &quot;yesterday&quot; is present.

===Singaporean English Creole===
Singaporean English Creole (Singlish) optionally marks the past tense, most often in irregular verbs (e.g., &quot;go&quot; → &quot;went&quot;) and regular verbs like &quot;accept&quot; which require an extra syllable for the past tense suffix -&quot;ed&quot;.

===Hawaiian Creole English===
Hawaiian Creole English optionally marks the past tense with the invariant pre-verbal marker &quot;wen&quot; or &quot;bin&quot; (especially older speakers) or (especially on the island Kauai). ( &quot;I saw him&quot;; &quot;I cleaned up my place for the holiday&quot;; &quot;They played BYU last week&quot;). The past habitual marker is ( &quot;Your mother used to think so&quot;).

===Haitian Creole===
Haitian Creole can indicate past tense with the pre-verbal marker &quot;te&quot; (&quot;Li te vini&quot; &quot;He (past) come&quot;, &quot;He came&quot;).

<doc id="450657" wikidata="Q7380031" url="?curid=450657" title="Running key cipher">
<text>In classical cryptography, the running key cipher is a type of polyalphabetic substitution cipher in which a text, typically from a book, is used to provide a very long keystream. The earliest description of such a cipher was given in 1892 by French mathematician Arthur Joseph Hermann (better known for founding Éditions Hermann). Usually, the book to be used would be agreed ahead of time, while the passage to be used would be chosen randomly for each message and secretly indicated somewhere in the message.

== Example ==

The key text used is a portion of &quot;The C Programming Language&quot; (1978 edition), and the &quot;tabula recta&quot; is the tableau. The plaintext here is &quot;Flee at once&quot;.

Page 63, line 1 is selected as the running key:

errors can occur in several places. A label has...

The running key is then written under the plaintext:

The message is then sent as &quot;JCVSR LQNPS&quot;. However, unlike a Vigenère cipher, if the message is extended, the key is not repeated; the key text itself (the text from the &quot;The C Programming Language&quot;) is used as the key and can be extended for any arbitrary length. If the message is extended, such as, &quot;Flee at once. We are discovered&quot;, then the running key continues as before:

To determine where to find the running key, a fake block of five ciphertext characters is subsequently added, with three denoting the page number, and two the line number, using A=0, B=1 etc. to encode digits. Such a block is called an indicator block. The indicator block will be inserted as the second last of each message. (Many other schemes are possible for hiding indicator blocks.) Thus page 63, line 1 encodes as &quot;AGDAB&quot; (06301).

This yields a final message of &quot;JCVSR LQNPS YGUIM QAWXS AGDAB MECTO&quot;.

== Variants ==

Modern variants of the running key cipher often replace the traditional &quot;tabula recta&quot; with bitwise exclusive or, operate on whole bytes rather than alphabetic letters, and derive their running keys from large files. Apart from possibly greater entropy density of the files, and the ease of automation, there is little practical difference between such variants and traditional methods.

=== Permutation generated running keys ===

A more compact running key can be used if one combinatorially generates text using several start pointers (or combination rules). For example, rather than start at one place (a single pointer), one could use several start pointers and xor together the streams to form a new running key, similarly skip rules can be used. What is exchanged then is a series of pointers to the running key book and/or a series of rules for generating the new permuted running key from the initial key text. (These may be exchanged via public key encryption or in person. They may also be changed frequently without changing the running key book.)

=== Ciphertext appearing to be plaintext ===

Traditional ciphertext appears to be quite different from plaintext. To address this problem, one variant outputs &quot;plaintext&quot; words instead of &quot;plaintext&quot; letters as the ciphertext output. This is done by creating an &quot;alphabet&quot; of words (in practice multiple words can correspond to each ciphertext output character). The result is a ciphertext output which looks like a long sequence of plaintext words (the process can be nested). Theoretically, this is no different from using standard ciphertext characters as output. However, plaintext-looking ciphertext may result in a &quot;human in the loop&quot; to try to mistakenly interpret it as decoded plaintext.

An example would be BDA (Berkhoff deflater algorithm), each ciphertext output character has at least one noun, verb, adjective and adverb associated with it. (E.g. (at least) one of each for every ASCII character). Grammatically plausible sentences are generated as ciphertext output. Decryption requires mapping the words back to ASCII, and then decrypting the characters to the real plaintext using the running key. Nested-BDA will run the output through the reencryption process several times, producing several layers of &quot;plaintext-looking&quot; ciphertext - each one potentially requiring &quot;human-in-the-loop&quot; to try to interpret its non-existent semantic meaning.

=== Gromark cipher ===

The &quot;Gromark cipher&quot; (&quot;Gronsfeld cipher with mixed alphabet and running key&quot;) uses a running numerical key formed by adding successive pairs of digits.
The VIC cipher uses a similar lagged Fibonacci generator.

== Security and cryptanalysis ==

If the running key is truly random, never reused, and kept secret, the result is a one-time pad, a method that provides perfect secrecy (reveals no information about the plaintext). However, if (as usual) the running key is a block of text in a natural language, security actually becomes fairly poor, since that text will have non-random characteristics which can be used to aid cryptanalysis: for example, William F. Friedman suggested a ciphertext-only attack during WWI against most frequent letters encoded by other most frequent letters. As a result, the entropy per character of both plaintext and running key is low, and the combining operation is easily inverted.

To attack the cipher, a cryptanalyst may run guessed probable plaintexts along the ciphertext, subtracting them out from each possible position. When the result is a chunk of something intelligible, there is a high probability that the guessed plain text is correct for that position (as either actual plaintext, or part of the running key). The &#x27;chunk of something intelligible&#x27; can then often be extended at either end, thus providing even more probable plaintext, which can in turn be extended, and so on (for more detailed explanation refer to Autokey cipher). Eventually it is likely that the source of the running key will be identified, and the jig is up.

There are several ways to improve the security. The first and most obvious is to use a secret mixed alphabet tableau instead of a &quot;tabula recta&quot;. This does indeed greatly complicate matters but it is not a complete solution. As exploited in Friedman&#x27;s method, pairs of plaintext and running key characters are far more likely to be high frequency pairs such as &#x27;EE&#x27; rather than, say, &#x27;QQ&#x27;. The skew this causes to the output frequency distribution is smeared by the fact that it is quite possible that &#x27;EE&#x27; and &#x27;QQ&#x27; map to the same ciphertext character, but nevertheless the distribution is not flat. This may enable the cryptanalyst to deduce part of the tableau, then proceed as before (but with gaps where there are sections missing from the reconstructed tableau).

Another possibility is to use a key text that has more entropy per character than typical English. For this purpose, the KGB advised agents to use documents like almanacs and trade reports, which often contain long lists of random-looking numbers.

Another problem is that the keyspace is surprisingly small. Suppose that there are 100 million key texts that might plausibly be used, and that on average each has 11 thousand possible starting positions. To an opponent with a massive collection of possible key texts, this leaves possible a brute force search of the order of formula_1, which by computer cryptography standards is a relatively easy target. (See permutation generated running keys above for an approach to this problem).

== Confusion ==

Because both ciphers classically employed novels as part of their key material, many sources confuse the book cipher and the running key cipher. They are really only very distantly related. The running key cipher is a polyalphabetic substitution, the book cipher is a homophonic substitution. Perhaps the distinction is most clearly made by the fact that a running cipher would work best of all with a book of random numbers, whereas such a book (containing no text) would be useless for a book cipher.

<text>A is a local administrative unit in Japan.

It is a local public body along with , , and . Geographically, a village&#x27;s extent is contained within a prefecture. Villages are larger than a local settlement; each is a subdivision of rural , which are subdivided into towns and villages with no overlap and no uncovered area. As a result of mergers and elevation to higher statuses, the number of villages in Japan is decreasing.

As of 2006, 13 prefectures no longer have any villages: Tochigi (since March 20, 2006), Fukui (since March 3, 2006), Ishikawa (since March 1, 2005), Shizuoka (since July 1, 2005), Hyōgo (since April 1, 1999), Mie (since November 1, 2005), Shiga (since January 1, 2005), Hiroshima (since November 5, 2004), Yamaguchi (since March 20, 2006), Ehime (since January 16, 2005), Kagawa (since April 1, 1999), Nagasaki (since October 1, 2005), and Saga (since March 20, 2006).
