<text>The Gender Recognition Act 2004 is an act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom that allows adults in the United Kingdom who have gender dysphoria to change their legal gender. It came into effect on 4 April 2005.

==Operation of the law==
The Gender Recognition Act 2004 enables  people to apply to receive a Gender Recognition Certificate (GRC). A Gender Recognition Certificate is the document issued that shows that a person has satisfied the criteria for legal recognition in the acquired gender. The act gives people with gender dysphoria legal recognition as members of the sex appropriate to their gender identity allowing them to acquire a Gender Recognition Certificate. People whose birth was registered in the United Kingdom or abroad with the British authorities are able to obtain a birth certificate showing their recognised legal sex. People granted a full GRC are from the date of issue, considered in the eyes of the law to be of their &quot;acquired gender&quot; in most situations. Two main exceptions to trans people&#x27;s legal recognition are that the descent of peerages will remain unchanged (important only for primogeniture inheritance) and a right of conscience for Church of England clergy (who are normally obliged to marry any two eligible people by law).

The ECHR has stated that people with a GRC can be excluded from single sex space so far as it is for a &quot;proportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim&quot;, which could be for &quot;reasons of privacy, decency, to prevent trauma or to ensure health and safety&quot;.

The Gender Recognition Act 2004 aimed to safeguard the privacy of transgender people by defining information in relation to the gender recognition process as protected information. Anyone who acquires that information in an official capacity may be breaking the law if they disclosed it without the subject&#x27;s consent. However, in the first seven years of operation, birth certificates drawn from the Gender Recognition Register were immediately distinguishable from a natal birth certificate, since they had only nine columns of information, omitting the item &quot;Signature, description and residence of informant&quot; that appears on birth certificates. These Gender Recognition Certificates also replaced the rubric &quot;Certified to be a true copy of an entry in the certified copy of a Register of Births in the District above mentioned&quot;, which appears on birth certificates, with the rubric &quot;Certified to be a true copy of a record in the custody of the Registrar General&quot;. These issues were corrected by the Gender Recognition Register (Amendment) Regulations 2011.

A Gender Recognition Panel, including medical and legal experts, considers evidence submitted to it to assess whether the criteria for issuing a Gender Recognition Certificate have been met. The evidence must show a documented mental health diagnosis of gender dysphoria. If the person involved is in a legally recognised marriage, they require spousal consent for the certificate to be issued, after which a new marriage certificate can be issued; if the spouse does not consent, the person will be issued an Interim Gender Recognition Certificate, which for a limited period can then be used as grounds for annulment of the marriage, but otherwise has no status.

Section 16 provides that acquiring a new gender under the act does not affect the descent of peerages or estates that devolve with them. The Act does not allow children to change their legal gender.

==Background==

The act was drafted in response to court rulings from the European Court of Human Rights.

The previous precedent dated back to 1970, when Arthur Cameron Corbett, 3rd Baron Rowallan had his marriage annulled on the basis that his wife, April Ashley, being transgender, was legally male. This argument was accepted by the judge, and the legal test for sex in the UK had been since been based on the judgment in &quot;Corbett v Corbett&quot;.

The European Court of Human Rights ruled on 11 July 2002, in &quot;Goodwin &amp; I v United Kingdom&quot; [2002] 2 FCR 577, that a trans person&#x27;s inability to change the sex on their birth certificate was a breach of their rights under Article 8 and Article 12 of the European Convention on Human Rights. Following this judgment, the UK Government had to introduce new legislation to comply.

==Legislative progress==
The bill was introduced in the House of Lords in late 2003. It was passed by the House of Lords on 10 February 2004, with 155 votes in favour and 57 against, and by the House of Commons on 25 May with 355 votes in favour and 46 against. It received royal assent on 1 July 2004.

The bill faced criticism in the House of Lords, including a wrecking amendment from Lord Tebbit (who has described sex reassignment surgery as &quot;mutilation&quot;), and from Baroness O&#x27;Cathain, who introduced an amendment to allow religious groups to exclude transgender people. However, this amendment was narrowly defeated after opposition from Peter Selby, Bishop of Worcester, and Michael Scott-Joynt, Bishop of Winchester.

Support for the bill in the House of Commons was split broadly down party lines. At both the second and third readings (i.e. before and after amendments), all Labour Party, Liberal Democrat, Plaid Cymru and Scottish National Party votes were in favour of the bill; all Ulster Unionist and Democratic Unionist Party votes were against. Conservative Party MPs were split on the issue, and the party leadership did not issue a whip mandating MPs to take a particular stance on the bill, instead allowing its MPs a free vote. Twenty-five Conservative MPs voted in favour and 22 against the bill at its second reading, and 20 voted in favour and 39 voted against the bill at its third reading. Less than half of the Conservative Party&#x27;s 166 MPs participated in either vote. Among those who voted against the bill were Ann Widdecombe (who opposed it on religious grounds), Dominic Grieve, Peter Lilley and Andrew Robathan. Among Conservative MPs who supported the bill were Kenneth Clarke, Constitutional Affairs spokesman Tim Boswell, and future speaker John Bercow.

===Updates===
In 2016, the Women and Equalities Committee published a root-and-branch review of the Gender Recognition Act, noting its deficiencies and making recommendations for its review. At the same time, it noted similar deficiencies in the Equality Act 2010 as it affected the protected characteristic of gender reassignment.

In November 2017, the Scottish government published its review of the GRA with intentions to reform it &quot;so that it is in line with international best practice.&quot; The &quot;Ministerial Foreword&quot; to the review acknowledges that the 2004 GRA is &quot;out of date&quot; and places &quot;intrusive and onerous&quot; requirements on the person applying for the gender change. The government recommends keeping the existing requirements for applicants to declare that &quot;they fully understand the implications of their application and intend to live in their acquired gender for the rest of their lives&quot; but proposes eliminating the requirement &quot;to provide medical evidence and to have lived in their acquired gender for two years before applying.&quot;

In 2017, Minister for Equalities Justine Greening considered reforms to the Gender Recognition Act to de-medicalise the process, with the principle of self-identification. One of Greening&#x27;s successors, Penny Mordaunt, affirmed that the consultation on the Gender Recognition Act would come from the starting place that &quot;transgender women are women&quot;.

In a June 2020 report, the European Commission classified the legal procedures for gender recognition of 28 European countries into 5 categories based on the barriers to access. This placed the Gender Recognition Act 2004 in the second from bottom category with &quot;intrusive medical requirements&quot; that lags behind international human rights standards.

In September 2020, the UK government published the results of the public consultation which showed wide support for all aspects of reform, including 64% in favour of removing the requirement for a diagnosis of gender dysphoria and 80% in favour of removing the requirement for a medical report. However, the UK government decided not to change the current law, which was described as &quot;a missed opportunity&quot; by the Equality and Human Rights Commission.

==Concerns regarding marriages and civil partnerships==

Concerns about the act were raised by supporters of transgender rights, particularly regarding marriages and civil partnerships. Due to marriage being restricted in UK law to opposite-sex couples and the lack of availability of civil partnerships to opposite-sex couples, the act required people who are married to divorce or annul their marriage in order for them to be issued with a Gender Recognition Certificate. This requirement was abolished in December 2014, nine months after the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Act 2013 permitted same-sex marriages. In England, Scotland, and Wales, such an application from a married person requires written consent from the spouse – the so-called spousal veto. Applicants in Scotland benefit from a workaround, where it is possible for applicants in Scotland to apply to the sheriff court to have their interim GRC replaced with a full GRC, bypassing the &quot;spousal veto&quot;. Some parliamentarians, such as Evan Harris, viewed the original requirement as inhumane and destructive of the family. MP Hugh Bayley said in the Commons debate &quot;I can think of no other circumstance in which the state tells a couple who are married and who wish to remain married that they must get divorced&quot;. Despite this opposition, the government chose to retain this requirement of the Bill. Parliamentary Under-Secretary for Constitutional Affairs, David Lammy, speaking for the Government, said &quot;it is the Government&#x27;s firm view that we cannot allow a small category of same-sex marriages&quot;. It was suggested in the debates that the number of transgender people who have undertaken gender reassignment and who are currently living in a marriage was no more than 200.

Although the Civil Partnership Act 2004 allows the creation of civil partnerships between same sex couples, before 2013, a married couple that included a transgender partner could not simply re-register their new status. They had to have their marriage dissolved, gain legal recognition of the new gender and then register for a civil partnership. This is like any divorce with the associated paperwork and costs. Once the annulment was declared final and the GRC issued, the couple could then make arrangements with the local registrar to have the civil partnership ceremony. The marriage was ended and a completely new arrangement brought into being which did not in all circumstances (such as wills) necessarily follow on seamlessly. This is also true for civil partnerships that included a transgender partner: the existing civil partnership needed to be dissolved and the couple could then enter into a marriage afterward. For a couple in a marriage or civil partnership where both partners are transgender, they could have their gender recognition applications considered at the same time; however, they were required to dissolve their existing marriage/civil partnership and then re-register their marriage/civil partnership with their new genders.

Tamara Wilding of the Beaumont Society pressure group said that it was &quot;not fair that people in this situation should have to annul their marriage and then enter a civil partnership. The law needs tidying up. It would be easy to put an amendment in the civil partnership law to allow people who have gone through gender-reassignment, and want that to be recognised, to have the status of their relationship continued.&quot; The emotional stress caused is immeasurable as in the case of a Scottish couple.

The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) appreciated the challenges to married transgender people and their partners presented by schedule 2 of the act and in a recent submission to government they recommend: &quot;The government amends the Gender Recognition Act to allow for the automatic conversion of a marriage into a civil partnership upon one member of the couple obtaining a gender recognition certificate.&quot;

=== Post-2013 ===
These concerns were ameliorated somewhat by the passage of the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Act 2013, since marriage is now available to both opposite-sex and same-sex couples alike. Under the current law, when a married couple includes a transgender person, the transgender person’s spouse must either give their approval for the change in legal gender, or else divorce. This has been described, and opposed, by transgender activists as a &quot;spousal veto&quot; on their legal transition. In 2019 and again in 2024, the Liberal Democrats included the removal of the &quot;spousal veto&quot; as part of their manifesto. Baroness Barker introduced a private member&#x27;s bill to amend the law in 2019. By contrast, some wives of trans women with Gender Recognition Certificates have called the provision a &quot;spousal exit clause&quot;, describing it as a &quot;well-designed piece of law which protects heterosexual Trans Widows from the possibility of being trapped in legally same sex marriages that they did not sign up to&quot;.

==Reform bill in Scotland==
In March 2022, the Gender Recognition Reform (Scotland) Bill was formally introduced in the Scottish Parliament. If enacted, this bill would have amended the Gender Recognition Act and changed the process of applying for a GRC. Under the changes, applicants would no longer have needed to prove having lived for two years in their acquired gender and would no longer have had to obtain a gender dysphoria diagnosis. Instead, they would have been required to make a statutory declaration that they intend to remain permanently in their acquired gender. In addition, applications would have been handled by the Registrar General for Scotland instead of a UK-wide gender recognition panel. The UK Government has ruled out implementing similar changes in England and Wales. The bill passed by a vote of 86–39 within the Scottish Parliament on stage three in December 2022. On 17 January 2023, the UK Government used Section 35 of the Scotland Act 1998 to prevent the bill from being proposed for royal assent, the first such time Section 35 has been used.

<doc id="457554" wikidata="Q7458672" url="?curid=457554" title="Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act 2000">
<text>The Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act 2000 (c.44) is an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. It set the age of consent for male homosexual sexual activities and for heterosexual anal sex at 16 (17 in Northern Ireland), which had long been the age of consent for all other types of sexual activities, such as vaginal sex or lesbian sex. As such, it made the age of consent for all types of sexual acts equal, without discrimimating on the basis of the type of act or of the sexes of those involved in the act. It also introduced the new offence of &#x27;having sexual intercourse or engaging in any other sexual activity with a person under 18 if in a position of trust in relation to that person&#x27;.

== Background ==
An attempt to equalize the age of consent for heterosexual and homosexual sex was made in 1994, when Conservative MP Edwina Currie, who proposed an amendment to that effect to the Criminal Justice and Public Order Bill. Even though over forty Tory MPs joined Currie, the measure was lost by twenty-seven votes. Immediately afterwards, an amendment to reduce the age of consent for homosexual sexual activities from twenty-one to eighteen was agreed to by a vote 427 to 162. The election of a Labour Government in 1997 afforded Parliament a further opportunity to examine the issue.

In 1996, the European Court of Human Rights heard &quot;Morris v. The United Kingdom&quot; and &quot; Sutherland v. the United Kingdom&quot;, cases brought by Chris Morris and Euan Sutherland challenging the inequality inherent in divided ages of consent. The government stated its intention to legislate to negate the court cases, which were put on hold.

On 22 June 1998, during consideration of the Crime and Disorder Bill by the House of Commons, Labour MP Ann Keen proposed an amendment adding a new clause equalizing the age of consent: Keen&#x27;s motion passed by a vote of 336 to 129 (a majority of 207). On 22 July, following a concerted campaign by Conservative peer Baroness Young, the House of Lords voted 290–122 (a majority of 168) to disagree with the amendment. Not wishing to lose the whole bill, the government allowed the issue to be dropped.

== Passage ==
On 16 December 1998, the government introduced the bill which would have eventually become this Act. MPs from all major parties were permitted a conscience vote. On 25 January 1999, the Bill passed its third reading in the House of Commons by a vote of 282 to 81, but the House of Lords rejected it once again, this time by a vote of 222 to 146 (a majority of 76).

On 19 January 2000, the newly established Scottish Parliament passed by a vote of 90 to 16 a non-binding motion &quot;that the Parliament endorses the principles of equalising the age of consent for homosexual and heterosexual activity and creating a new criminal offence of breach of trust as set out in the Sexual Offences (Amendment) Bill considered by the UK Parliament in the 1998-99 parliamentary session and agrees that the UK Parliament should consider any Bill introduced in the same terms in the current session&quot;.

On 28 January 2000, the government reintroduced the bill: on 28 February, the Commons voted 317–117 to grant it a third reading. Since the Commons had passed it in two successive sessions of Parliament, the Parliament Acts 1911 and 1949 could have been used to enact the bill had the House of Lords not passed it before the end of the session (regardless of whether the Bill had been outright rejected or simply not put up to a vote). The Lords passed the bill at second reading, but during committee stage, by a vote of 205 to 144 (a majority of 61), they agreed to an amendment which would have maintained the age of consent for anal sex (whether with a male or with a female) at 18. The Government (which is in charge of parliamentary business in both Houses and opposed this change) did not allow the Lords a third reading vote on the amended bill. At the end of the session, on 30 November 2000, then-Speaker of the House of Commons Michael Martin certified that the procedure set out in the Parliament Acts had been complied with. The bill received royal assent a few hours later, and was enacted as the Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act 2000; its provisions came into force throughout the UK on 8 January 2001.

== Aftermath ==
The Sexual Offences Act 2003 and the Sexual Offences (Scotland) Act 2009, which consolidated most previous sexual offences legislation, kept in place the equal age of consent achieved by the Act. 

=== Legal challenge to the validity of the Parliament Act 1949 ===
The fact the bill had been enacted without the Lords&#x27; consent became significant in the wake of passage of the Hunting Act 2004, which had also been passed using the Parliament Acts. The passage of that Act was challenged in the case of &quot;R (Jackson) v Attorney General&quot; on the basis that the Parliament Act 1949 itself had been unlawfully passed. If the latter point were true, then the Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act 2000 would also be invalid, though this would have only had an effect in Scotland, since in England and Wales and in Northern Ireland the provisions had been consolidated in legislation not passed under the Parliament Acts. The challenge to the Hunting Act was ultimately unsuccessful.

<text>Wilbert Colin Thatcher (born August 25, 1938) is a Canadian politician who was convicted for the murder of his ex-wife, JoAnn Wilson.

==Early life==
Colin Thatcher was born in Toronto, Ontario, on August 25, 1938. His father, Saskatchewan-born Ross Thatcher, was working for Canada Packers, a predecessor of Maple Leaf Foods, at the time of his birth. He moved to Saskatchewan when his father returned home to run the family business. His father subsequently entered politics and became Premier of Saskatchewan from 1964 to 1971.

Thatcher began studying agriculture at the University of Saskatchewan. After one year, he transferred to Iowa State University. He graduated from Iowa State with B.S. and M.S. degrees in agriculture, and returned to Saskatchewan to work on his father&#x27;s ranch in Moose Jaw.

==Political career==
After his father&#x27;s death in 1971, Thatcher cultivated his own interest in politics. In 1975, he won the provincial riding of Thunder Creek as a Liberal, but he defected to the Progressive Conservatives two years later. Thatcher served from 1982 to 1983 as the Minister of Energy in the government of Premier Grant Devine. On January 17, 1983, Thatcher resigned his portfolio, citing family and financial reasons.

==Personal life==
===Marriage and separation===
Thatcher met his future wife JoAnn Geiger at the University of Iowa. They married on August 12, 1962, and had three children, Greg, Regan and Stephanie. Thatcher admitted to infidelity during the course of the marriage and the couple separated in August 1979. They ended up fighting a long, hotly contested series of custody, access and matrimonial property battles. In 1980, they were divorced and Geiger was awarded custody of two of their three children, as well as $820,000 for her share of the marital property. In January 1981, she married a local businessman, Tony Wilson, and became known as JoAnn Wilson.

On May 17, 1981, Wilson was shot and wounded while in the kitchen of her home. A bullet fired from a high-powered rifle passed through a triple-glazed glass window and struck her in the shoulder. As a result of the shooting, Wilson was hospitalized for about three weeks. No one was ever charged with the 1981 shooting.

===Murder of ex-wife===
On January 21, 1983, four days after Thatcher&#x27;s resignation as Minister of Energy, Wilson was found bludgeoned and shot to death in the garage of her Regina home. Thatcher was formally charged on May 7, 1984, after a lengthy police investigation.

Thatcher was tried in Saskatoon for the murder of his ex-wife in the autumn of 1984. In addition to the evidence presented, he insisted on testifying so that he could try and explain the recorded conversation between Gary Anderson and him where they discussed hiring a hitman. He was found guilty under the prosecution of Crown Prosecutor Serge Kujawa and was given a sentence of life imprisonment, with no eligibility for parole for 25 years.

In late April 1985, two weeks before his appeal, a package postmarked Winnipeg arrived at the &quot;Regina Leader-Post&quot;. The package contained an anonymous confession to the murder of Wilson, a homemade hatchet the writer claimed was the murder weapon, and two photographs of a nude woman whom the letter claimed was Wilson. The newspaper turned the package over to the Regina Police. After numerous requests for disclosure of the photos and hatchet, the Crown eventually admitted to Thatcher&#x27;s lawyer that they had been lost.

On November 30, 2006, Thatcher was granted full parole. He subsequently remarried in 2010.

Thatcher wrote a 440-page book about his case, &quot;Final Appeal: Anatomy of a Frame&quot;. It was released by ECW Press on September 1, 2009. In reaction to the book’s publication, the Government of Saskatchewan introduced the &quot;Profits of Criminal Notoriety Act&quot; and a judge ordered the surrender of any proceeds to the Ministry of Justice. In 2011, funds from the sale of the book in the amount of $13,866.44 were turned over to the Ministry of Justice. The province subsequently donated the funds to two groups assisting victims of domestic violence and survivors of homicide.

====In popular culture====
In 1985, author Maggie Siggins wrote the book &quot;A Canadian Tragedy: JoAnn and Colin Thatcher: A Story of Love and Hate&quot;. A two-part television mini-series based on the book called &quot;Love and Hate: The Story of Colin and JoAnn Thatcher&quot; was produced by CBC Television in 1989, starring Kenneth Welsh as Colin Thatcher and Kate Nelligan as JoAnn Thatcher Wilson.

<doc id="457561" wikidata="Q51520" url="?curid=457561" title="The Passion of Joan of Arc">
<text>The Passion of Joan of Arc () is a 1928 French silent historical film based on the actual record of the trial of Joan of Arc. The film was directed by Carl Theodor Dreyer and stars Renée Jeanne Falconetti as Joan. It is widely regarded as a landmark of cinema, especially for its production, Dreyer&#x27;s direction and Falconetti&#x27;s performance, which is often listed as one of the finest in cinema history. The film summarizes the time that Joan of Arc was a captive of England, depicting her trial and execution.

Danish director Dreyer was invited to make a film in France by the Société Générale des Films and chose to make a film about Joan of Arc due to her renewed popularity in France. Dreyer spent over a year researching Joan of Arc and the transcripts of her trial before writing the script. Dreyer cast stage actress Falconetti as Joan in her only major film role. Falconetti&#x27;s performance and devotion to the role during filming have become legendary among film scholars.

The film was shot on one huge concrete set modeled on medieval architecture in order to realistically portray the Rouen prison. The film is known for its cinematography and use of close-ups. Dreyer did not allow the actors to wear make-up and used lighting designs that made the actors look more grotesque. Prior to its release, the film was controversial due to French nationalists&#x27; skepticism about whether a Dane could direct a film about one of France&#x27;s most revered historical icons. Dreyer&#x27;s final version of the film was cut down due to pressure from the Archbishop of Paris and government censors. For several decades, it was released and viewed in various re-edited versions that attempted to restore Dreyer&#x27;s final cut. In 1981, a print of Dreyer&#x27;s final cut was discovered in Dikemark Hospital, a mental institution just outside Oslo, Norway, and re-released.

Despite the objections and cutting of the film by clerical and government authorities, it was a major critical success when first released and has consistently been considered one of the greatest films ever made. It has been praised and referenced by many film directors and musicians. In 1958, the film was voted number 4 on the prestigious Brussels 12 list at the 1958 World Expo.

As a work published in 1928, the film entered the public domain in the United States in 2024.

==Plot==

After having led the French in numerous battles against the English during the Hundred Years&#x27; War, Joan of Arc is captured near Compiegne and eventually brought to Rouen to stand trial for heresy by French clergymen loyal to the English.

On 30 May 1431, Joan is interrogated by the French clerical court. Her judges, who are on the side of the Burgundian-English coalition and against the King of France, try to make her say something that will discredit her claim or shake her belief that she has been given a mission by God to drive the English from France, but she remains steadfast. One or two of them, believing that she is indeed a saint, support her.

The authorities then resort to deception. A priest reads a false letter in the prison to the illiterate Joan, supposedly from King Charles VII of France, telling her to trust in the bearer. When that too fails, Joan is taken to view the torture chamber, but the sight, though it causes her to faint, does not intimidate her.

When she is threatened with burning at the stake, Joan finally breaks and allows a priest to guide her hand in signing a confession. However, the judge then condemns her to life imprisonment. After the jailer shaves her head, she realises that she has been unfaithful to God. She demands that the judges return and she recants her confession.

As more and more around her begin to recognise her true faith and calling, she is permitted a final communion mass. She is then dressed in sackcloth and taken to the place of execution. She helps the executioner tie her bonds. The crowds gather and the fire is lit.

As the flames rise, the women weep and a man cries out, &quot;vous avez brûlé une sainte&quot; (&quot;you have burned a saint&quot;). The troops prepare for a riot. As the flames consume Joan, the troops and crowd clash and people are killed. A subtitle states that the flames protect her soul as it rises to Heaven.

==Production==
===Background===
After the success of &quot;Master of the House&quot; in Denmark, Dreyer was invited to make a film in France by the Société Gėnėrale des Films, and proposed a film about Marie Antoinette, Catherine de Medici or Joan of Arc. He claimed that the final decision on the film&#x27;s subject was determined by drawing matches. Joan of Arc was in the news after World War I, having been canonized as a saint by the Roman Catholic Church in 1920 and named one of the patron saints of France. 

Dreyer spent over a year and a half researching her; the script was based on the original transcripts of her trial, condensing 29 interrogations over the course of 18 months into one day. In an essay for the Danish Film Institute, Dreyer stated what he had sought to achieve: &quot;I wanted to interpret a hymn to the triumph of the soul over life.&quot;

The rights to Joseph Delteil&#x27;s 1925 anti-conformist book on Joan were bought for the production. Nothing from Delteil&#x27;s book was used in the film, but he was credited as a source. 

===Casting===
Joan of Arc was Renée Jeanne Falconetti&#x27;s second and last film role. Although she always preferred the theater to cinema and said she never understood the positive reaction to her acting, Falconetti&#x27;s performance achieved iconic status almost immediately. 

Dreyer had gone to see Falconetti backstage at a performance of Victor Margueritte&#x27;s &quot;La Garçonne&quot;, a comedic play in which she was appearing. He was initially unimpressed, but upon seeing her a second time the day after, Dreyer said he &quot;felt there was something in her which could be brought out; something she could give, something, therefore, I could take. For behind the make-up, behind the pose and that ravishing modern appearance, there was something. There was a soul behind that facade.&quot; Dreyer asked her to do some screen tests the next day, but without any make-up. During the tests, he &quot;found in her face exactly what I wanted for Joan: a country girl, very sincere, but also a woman of suffering.&quot; Dreyer then told Falconetti about the film and her role in great detail. She agreed to star in the film, secretly hoping that she would not have to cut her hair or forgo make-up.

Jean Renoir praised her performance and said &quot;That shaven head was and remains the abstraction of the whole epic of Joan of Arc.&quot; She was famously treated harshly by Dreyer, who had a reputation for being a tyrannical director. Dreyer would always clear the set whenever Falconetti needed to act in a particularly emotional or important scene, allowing her to focus without any distractions. Dreyer often had difficulties explaining himself to Falconetti and was known to turn bright red and begin stammering when passionately directing her. Dreyer had stated that a director &quot;must be careful never to force his own interpretation on an actor, because an actor cannot create truth and pure emotions on command. One cannot push feelings out. They have to arise from themselves, and it is the director&#x27;s and actor&#x27;s work in unison to bring them to that point.&quot; Later in post-production, Falconetti was the only cast member to watch the rushes and the film&#x27;s editing. According to critic Roger Ebert:

For Falconetti, the performance was an ordeal. Legends from the set tell of Dreyer forcing her to kneel painfully on stone and then wipe all expression from her face—so that the viewer would read suppressed or inner pain. He filmed the same shots again and again, hoping that in the editing room he could find exactly the right nuance in her facial expression.

Among the other cast members was French playwright Antonin Artaud as the monk Massieu. Artaud later stated that the film was meant to &quot;reveal Joan as the victim of one of the most terrible of all perversions: the perversion of a divine principle in its passage through the minds of men, whether they be Church, Government or what you will.&quot;

===Cinematography===

The camerawork of &quot;The Passion of Joan of Arc&quot; was highly unconventional in its radical emphasis on the actors&#x27; facial features. Dreyer shot much of the film in close-up, stating &quot;There were questions, there were answers- very short, very crisp...Each question, each answer, quite naturally called for a close-up...In addition, the result of the close-ups was that the spectator was as shocked as Joan was, receiving the questions, tortured by them.&quot; Dreyer also did not allow his actors to wear makeup, the better to tell the story through their expressions—this choice was made possible through use of the recently developed panchromatic film, which recorded skin tones in a naturalistic manner.

Dreyer often shot the priests and Joan&#x27;s other interrogators in high contrast lighting, but then shot Joan in soft, even lighting. Rudolph Maté&#x27;s high-contrast cinematography also allowed unappealing details in people&#x27;s faces, such as warts and lumps, to be fully visible. In addition, Dreyer employed many low-angle shots of Joan&#x27;s persecutors so that they would appear more monstrous and intimidating; in the effort to do this, several holes were dug on the set for the camera to film from the appropriate angle, causing the crew to nickname him &quot;Carl Gruyére&quot;. Dreyer also shot the film &quot;from the first to the last scene...in the right order.&quot;

===Art direction===
The film had one of the most expensive sets ever built for a European film up to that time. Upon being given a budget of seven million francs, Dreyer constructed an enormous octagonal concrete set to depict Rouen Castle. Production designers Hermann Warm and Jean Hugo were inspired by medieval miniatures for their designs, adding unnatural angles and perspectives to add to Joan&#x27;s emotional state of mind. They also relied on medieval manuscripts with accurate architectural drawings, such as John Mandeville&#x27;s &quot;Livre de Merveilles&quot;. The huge set was built as one complete, interconnecting structure instead of in separate locations. The castle had towers in all four corners with concrete walls running along the sides. Each wall was 10 centimeters thick so that they could support the weight of actors, technicians and equipment. A functional drawbridge was also built into one of the walls. Inside the walls were small houses, the courtyard where the burning took place and a cathedral. The entire set was painted pink so that it would appear grey in the black and white film and contrast against the white sky above it.

Regardless of the detail put into the set, only segments of it are ever visible in the film, which later angered the film&#x27;s producers since so much money was spent on the set. Dreyer later expressed, however, that the scope of the set heightened the abilities of the actors and actresses to give convincing performances. Hermann Warm&#x27;s original models for the film&#x27;s set are currently stored at the Danish Film Institute Archives.

===Music===
Different scores were used for the two premieres of the &quot;Passion of Joan of Arc&quot; in Copenhagen and Paris. The music of the Paris version, for orchestra and singers, has survived and has been revived. It was composed by Leo Pouget and Victor Alix, who as well as being film composers, both wrote operettas; Pouget was coming to the end of his career, whereas Alix was regarded by &quot;Le Ménestrel&quot; as becoming an established composer. Their score for the &quot;Passion of Joan of Arc&quot; has been seen in recent years as having some limitations. In the 1920s, film music was normally played live in the theatre. However, some of the Pouget/Alix score was recorded. In 1929, selections were released in 78 format in a performance by &quot;l&#x27;orchestre symphonique du Lutetia Wagram&quot; (the &quot;Lutetia Wagram&quot; being a large Parisian cinema of the time, since demolished).

Like most directors of that era, Dreyer had no control over the music. He stated he did not fully approve of any score he had heard, and disliked the soundtrack of Joseph-Marie Lo Duca&#x27;s version for the film which came out in the 1950s, which featured Bach, Albinoni and Vivaldi.

Since Dreyer&#x27;s death and the rediscovery of the original print, numerous composers have provided music for the film.
* In 1983, the Danish composer and conductor Ole Schmidt composed a score, which was premiered in Los Angeles in 1983 and released on CD by Dacapo Music in 1999. 
* In 1994, composer Richard Einhorn wrote an oratorio based on the film titled &quot;Voices of Light&quot;. This piece is available as an optional accompaniment on the Criterion Collection&#x27;s DVD release.
* In 1999, American singer/songwriter Cat Power provided musical accompaniment at several screenings of the film in the U.S.
* In 2009, the Estonian composer Tõnu Kõrvits wrote a score for small orchestra (for L´Ensemble De Basse-Normandie 2009/10 concert season) for this film.
* In 2009, the Lithuanian composer Bronius Kutavičius wrote a score for chamber orchestra (for St. Christopher Chamber Orchestra), performed during the Scanorama European Film Forum in Vilnius.
* In 2013 Roger Eno provided a live accompaniment in Oxford.
* In 2015, Donald Greig of the Orlando Consort, a British early music group of unaccompanied singers, designed a score consisting of music from the time of Joan of Arc. The Orlando Consort made a tour with the film. The music selected was mainly by French composers and little known to modern audiences outside the world of early music, an exception being the Agincourt Carol. The lyrics had relevance to the film and included Christine de Pizan&#x27;s &quot;Ditié de Jehanne d&#x27;Arc&quot;, an elegiac poem written during Joan&#x27;s lifetime.
* On 7 October 2023, GRAMMY Award-winning professional chorus Pacific Chorale of Orange County, California opened its 2023-2024 season at the Segerstrom Center for the Arts in Costa Mesa by presenting Einhorn&#x27;s &quot;Voices of Light&quot; and Dreyer&#x27;s film with Artistic Director Robert Istad conducting the Pacific Symphony.

==Release and different versions==

&quot;The Passion of Joan of Arc&quot; debuted on 21 April 1928 at the Palads Teatret cinema in Copenhagen. After a few private screenings, it finally premiered in Paris on 25 October 1928 at the Cinema Marivaux. The film&#x27;s release was delayed due to the persistent efforts of many French nationalists – who objected to the fact that Dreyer was neither Catholic nor French, and to the then-rumored casting of Lillian Gish as Joan. As early as January 1927, Jean-Jose Frappa said that &quot;whatever the talent of the director (and he has it)...he cannot give us a Joan of Arc in the true French tradition. And the American &#x27;star&#x27;...cannot be our Joan, wholesome, lively, shining with purity, faith, courage and patriotism. To let this be made in France would be a scandalous abdication of responsibility.&quot; Before its French premiere, several cuts were made by order of the Archbishop of Paris and by government censors. Dreyer was angered by these cuts, as he had no control over them. Later that year on 6 December, a fire at UFA studios in Berlin destroyed the film&#x27;s original negative; only a few copies of Dreyer&#x27;s original cut of the film existed. Dreyer was able to patch together a new version of the original cut using alternate and initially unused takes. Over the next four decades, it became difficult to find copies of Dreyer&#x27;s second version, and copies of the original were thought to be even scarcer.

It was re-released in 1933 in a 61-minute cut which included a new narration by radio star David Ross, but no intertitles. In 1952, Joseph-Marie Lo Duca found a copy of the negative of Dreyer&#x27;s second version in the Gaumont Studios vaults. Lo Duca then made several significant changes, including the addition of a Baroque score and the replacing of many intertitles with subtitles. For many years, Lo Duca&#x27;s version was the only one available. Dreyer himself objected to this cut, however.

The next version of the film was produced by Arnie Krogh of the Danish Film Institute. Krogh cut together scenes and sequences from several different available prints to attempt to create a cut that was as true to Dreyer&#x27;s original vision as possible.

===Rediscovery of the original version===
The original version was believed to be lost for decades after a fire at UFA in Berlin destroyed the master negative, and only variations of Dreyer&#x27;s second version were available. 

In 1981, a janitor found three film cannisters in a closet he was cleaning out at the Dikemark Hospital mental institution in Asker. The canisters were sent to the Norwegian Film Institute, where they were stored for three years before finally being examined. It was then discovered that they were Dreyer&#x27;s original cut prior to government or church censorship.

The print had been shipped from Copenhagen (where the film had premiered) to Asker. It was still in its 1928 packaging, which was addressed to Harald Arnesen, the director of the hospital.

==Reception==
===Contemporary reviews===
On its initial release, the film was a critical success and immediately called a masterpiece. However, it was a financial flop and caused the Société Générale to cancel its contract with Dreyer after the failure of this film and of Abel Gance&#x27;s &quot;Napoléon&quot;. Dreyer angrily accused the Société Générale of mutilating the film so as to avoid offending Catholic viewers and sued them for breach of contract. The lawsuit went on until the fall of 1931, during which time Dreyer was unable to make another film. It was banned in Britain for its portrayal of crude English soldiers who mock and torment Joan in scenes that mirror biblical accounts of Christ&#x27;s mocking at the hands of Roman soldiers. The Archbishop of Paris was also critical, demanding changes be made.

&quot;The New York Times&quot;″s film reviewer Mordaunt Hall raved:

as a film work of art this takes precedence over anything that has so far been produced. It makes worthy pictures of the past look like tinsel shams. It fills one with such intense admiration that other pictures appear but trivial in comparison.

Of the star, he wrote &quot;it is the gifted performance of Maria Falconetti as the Maid of Orleans that rises above everything in this artistic achievement.&quot;

However &quot;Variety&quot; gave the film a negative review on its initial release, calling it &quot;a deadly tiresome picture&quot;. In 1929, The National Board of Review named the film one of the best foreign films of the year.

===Later evaluations===
The film and Falconetti&#x27;s performance have continued to be praised by critics. Pauline Kael wrote that Falconetti&#x27;s portrayal &quot;may be the finest performance ever recorded on film.&quot; Roger Ebert praised the film and said that &quot;You cannot know the history of silent film unless you know the face of Renée Maria Falconetti.&quot; Jean Sémolué called it &quot;a film of confrontation&quot; and Paul Schrader has praised &quot;the architecture of Joan&#x27;s world, which literally conspires against her; like the faces of her inquisitors, the halls, doorways, furniture are on the offensive, striking, swooping at her with oblique angles, attacking her with hard-edged chunks of black and white&quot;. Jonathan Rosenbaum wrote that &quot;Dreyer&#x27;s radical approach to constructing space and the slow intensity of his mobile style make[s] this &quot;difficult&quot; in the sense that, like all the greatest films, it reinvents the world from the ground up.&quot;

Some critics have found faults in the film, and Paul Rotha called it &quot;one of the most remarkable productions ever realized in the history and development of cinema, &quot;but it was not a full exposition of real filmic properties&quot;&quot;. Tom Milne stated that &quot;somehow the style Dreyer found for the film seems irremediably false. Instead of flowing naturally from his chosen materials...it seems imposed upon them...Throughout the film there is a constant stylistic uncertainty, an impurity, which jars heavily today&quot;, but added that &quot;&quot;Jeanne d&#x27;Arc&quot; has a majestic power which steamrollers its way through all its faults and excesses.&quot; On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a rating of 98% based on 59 reviews, with an average rating of 9.10/10. The website&#x27;s consensus reads, &quot;&quot;The Passion of Joan of Arc&quot; is must-see cinema for Renée Maria Falconetti&#x27;s incredible performance alone -- and an all-time classic for innumerable other reasons.&quot;

The &quot;Village Voice&quot; ranked it the eighth greatest film of the 20th century in a 2000 poll of critics. In January 2002, the film was ranked 69th on the list of the Top 100 Essential Films of All Time by the National Society of Film Critics. The film was ranked 64th on the list of &quot;100 Greatest Films&quot; by the prominent French magazine &quot;Cahiers du cinéma&quot; in 2008. &quot;The Passion of Joan of Arc&quot; has appeared on &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; magazine&#x27;s top ten films poll five times: as number seven in 1952 and 1972, as number ten (Critic&#x27;s List) and six (Director&#x27;s List) in 1992 and as number nine in 2012 (Critic&#x27;s List). It ranked thirty-seventh on the Director&#x27;s List in 2012 and was listed by such filmmakers as Manoel de Oliveira, Atom Egoyan, Tsai Ming-Liang, Walter Salles, Béla Tarr, Michael Mann, who called it &quot;Human experience conveyed purely from the visualisation of the human face: no one else has composed and realised human beings quite like Dreyer in &quot;The Passion of Joan of Arc&quot;&quot;, and Kutlug Ataman, who said the film &quot;taught me film could be just poetry and timeless&quot;. In 2010, &quot;The Guardian&quot; ranked the film 22nd in its list of 25 greatest arthouse films. In 2010, the Toronto International Film Festival released its &quot;Essential 100&quot; list of films, which merged one list of the 100 greatest films of all time as determined by an expert panel of TIFF curators with another list determined by TIFF stakeholders. &quot;The Passion of Joan of Arc&quot; was ranked as the most influential film of all time. Her performance was ranked 26th in &quot;Premiere Magazine&quot;&#x27;s &quot;100 Greatest Performances of All Time&quot;, the highest of any silent performance on the list. In 2018 the film ranked 23rd on the BBC&#x27;s list of the 100 greatest foreign-language films, as voted on by 209 film critics from 43 countries.

The film was included by the Vatican in a list of important films compiled in 1995, under the category of &quot;Religion&quot;.

==References in other films==
Scenes from the film appear in Jean-Luc Godard&#x27;s &quot;Vivre sa Vie&quot; (1962), in which the protagonist Nana sees the film at a cinema and identifies with Joan. In &quot;Henry &amp; June&quot;, Henry Miller is shown watching the last scenes of the film and in voice-over narrates a letter to Anaïs Nin comparing her to Joan and himself to the &quot;mad monk&quot; character played by Antonin Artaud.

<text>This is a list of aircraft of the [[Fleet Air Arm|Fleet Air Arm (FAA)]].

On 1 April 1918 the Royal Naval Air Service (RNAS) was merged with the Royal Flying Corps (RFC) to form the Royal Air Force (RAF) which directly operated and controlled all naval aircraft. On 1 April 1924 the Fleet Air Arm of the Royal Air Force was created as a distinct component of the RAF, which existed until 24 May 1939 when command of the Fleet Air Arm was transferred back to Royal Navy control. 
Coastal Command patrol aircraft, including most large seaplanes, remained with the RAF despite their operations in a naval environment. Prototypes were largely under the control of the Air Ministry and not the Fleet Air Arm until their introduction into service.

<doc id="457564" wikidata="Q797846" url="?curid=457564" title="Girton College, Cambridge">
<text>Girton College is one of the 31 constituent colleges of the University of Cambridge. The college was established in 1869 by Emily Davies and Barbara Bodichon as the first women&#x27;s college in Cambridge. In 1948, it was granted full college status by the university, marking the official admittance of women to the university. In 1976, it was the first Cambridge women&#x27;s college to become coeducational.

The main college site, situated on the outskirts of the village of Girton, about northwest of the university town, comprises of land. In a typical Victorian red-brick design, most was built by architect Alfred Waterhouse between 1872 and 1887.

Among Girton&#x27;s notable alumni are Queen Margrethe II, former UK Supreme Court President Lady Hale, &quot;HuffPost&quot; co-founder Arianna Huffington, the comedian/author Sandi Toksvig, the comedian/broadcaster/GP Phil Hammond, the economist Joan Robinson, and the anthropologist Marilyn Strathern, who also held the position of Mistress from 1998 to 2009.

Its sister college is Somerville College, one of the two Oxford colleges to first admit women.

==History==
===1869 to 1976: Pioneering for women&#x27;s education===
The early feminist movement began to argue for the improvement of women&#x27;s education in the 1860s: Emily Davies and Barbara Bodichon met through their activism at the Society for the Employment of Women and &quot;The Englishwoman&#x27;s Review&quot;. They shared the aim of securing women&#x27;s admission to university. 

In particular, they wanted to determine whether girls could be admitted at Oxford or Cambridge to sit the Senior and Junior Local Examinations. Davies and Bodichon set up a committee to that effect in 1862. In 1865, with the help of Henry Tomkinson, Trinity College alumnus and the owner of an insurance company with good contacts within the University, 91 female students entered the Cambridge Local Examination. 

This first concession to women&#x27;s educational rights met relatively little resistance, as admission to the examination did not imply residence of women at the university site.
At that time, students had the option of doing a Pass degree, which consisted of &quot;a disorderly collection of fragmented learning&quot;, or an Honours degree, which at that time meant the Mathematics Tripos, classics, and natural or moral sciences. 

An Honours degree was considered more challenging than the Pass degree. In 1869, Henry Sidgwick helped institute the Examinations for Women, which was designed to be of intermediate difficulty. This idea was heavily opposed by Emily Davies, as she demanded admittance to the Tripos examinations.

The college was established on 16 October 1869 under the name of the College for Women at Benslow House in Hitchin, Hertfordshire, which was considered to be a convenient distance from Cambridge and London. It was thought to be less &quot;risky&quot; and less controversial to locate the college away from Cambridge in the beginning. 

The college was one of England&#x27;s first residential colleges for women. Whitelands College, now part of the University of Roehampton, was established as a college of higher education for women earlier, in 1841. They worked with Fanny Metcalfe to develop the curricula.

In July and October 1869, entrance examinations were held in London, to which 21 candidates came; 16 passed. The first term started on 16 October 1869, when five students began their studies: Emily Gibson, Anna Lloyd, Louisa Lumsden, Isabella Townshend and Sarah Woodhead. Adelaide Manning was also registered as a student, although with the intention of staying for a single term, and her step-mother Charlotte Manning was the first Mistress. 

The first three students to unofficially sit the Tripos exams in Lent term 1873, Rachel Cook and Lumsden, who both took the Classical Tripos, as well as Woodhead, who took the Mathematical Tripos, were known as &quot;The Pioneers&quot;.

Through fundraising, £7,000 was collected, which allowed for the purchase of land either at Hitchin or near Cambridge in 1871. 

By 1872, sixteen acres of land at the present site were acquired near the village of Girton. 

The college was then renamed Girton College, and opened at the new location in October 1873. 

The buildings had cost £12,000 to erect, and consisted of a single block which comprised the east half of Old Wing. At the time, thirteen students were admitted.

In 1876, Old Wing was completed, and Taylor&#x27;s Knob, the college laboratory and half of the Hospital Wing was built. 

In the following year, Caroline Croom Robertson joined the management team as secretary to reduce the load on Emily Davies. 

In 1884, Hospital Wing was completed, and Orchard Wing, Stanley Library and the Old Kitchens added. At that time, Girton had 80 students. 

By 1902, Tower Wing, Chapel Wing and Woodlands Wing as well as the Chapel and the Hall were finished, which allowed the college to accommodate 180 students.

In 1921, a committee was appointed to draft a charter for the college. By summer 1923 the committee had completed the task, and on 21 August 1924 the King granted the charter to &quot;the Mistress and Governors of Girton College&quot; as a Body Corporate. 

Girton was not officially a college yet, nor were its members part of the University. Girton and Newnham were classed as &quot;recognised institutions for the higher education for women&quot;, not colleges of the university. 

On 27 April 1948, women were admitted to full membership of the University of Cambridge, and Girton College received the status of a college of the university.

===1976 to present: Pioneering for sexual equality===
Social and cultural changes in the post-war period led to an increasing number of British universities to become co-educational. 

In Cambridge, Churchill College, King&#x27;s College and Clare College were the first men&#x27;s colleges to admit women in 1972. Girton had already amended its statutes in 1971 in such a way as to allow the admission of men, should the Governing Body vote in favour at an unspecified date in the future. 

The decision to become mixed came in November 1976, when the Governing Body voted to act upon the statute, which made Girton the first women&#x27;s college to admit men. 

In January 1977, the first two male Fellows, Frank Wilkinson and John Marks, arrived, followed by male graduate students in 1978, and, finally, undergraduates in October 1979. 

One reason for the change was that the first mixed colleges in Cambridge immediately shot to the top of the Tripos league tables, as they seemed to attract bright students, who preferred to stay in co-educational colleges.

Girton became co-residential as well, which meant that male and female students shared the same facilities. Only one all-female corridor in which rooms were reserved exclusively for women remained. 

Upon the arrival of male undergraduates, JCR and MCR social facilities had to be enlarged. The college bar was opened in 1979 as well as rugby, cricket and soccer pitches provided from 1982 onwards.

In the 22-year period from 1997 to 2019, the Tompkins Table annual ranking of Cambridge colleges by undergraduate academic performance ranked Girton College an average of 20 out of the 29 colleges researched. In 2019, it came 20th, with 22 per cent of all undergraduate students gaining a first-class degree.

===Mistresses===

The mistress is the formal head of the college. Her main task is to exercise general superintendence over the college&#x27;s affairs. She presides over the college council and several college committees. The mistress is elected by the council, and has to reside at the college precincts for at least two-thirds of each term, or 210 days of each academic year. Ever since the establishment of Girton College, the position has been held by a female, even though male candidates have had equal rights for running for the office since 1976 and would, if elected, be called by the female term &quot;mistress&quot;.

The current mistress is Elisabeth Kendall, who in 2022 succeeded Susan J. Smith; she had held the position since 2009.

==Accommodation and fees==
As with many Cambridge colleges, rooms are available to external guests on a Bed and Breakfast basis. As of 2024, accommodation fees vary depending on the room type. Single standard bedrooms start at £55.80 a night, while single en-suite bedrooms are priced from £81.80. Double standard bedrooms begin at £101 a night, and double/twin en-suite bedrooms start at £140.50. These rates provide a range of options to suit different preferences and budgets. 

===Undergraduates===

It is customary for Cambridge colleges to provide accommodation for the first three-year undergraduate students.

Rooms in the main site are arranged along corridors, which makes it possible to walk from one location in the building to another without going outside. 

Some of the rooms were originally designed as sets by Alfred Waterhouse. The rooms range in several quality grades but are all charged at the same weekly rate. 

Every year, a ballot is organised by the JCR to determine room distribution. To first years, rooms are allocated randomly, with students allocated low grade rooms having first pick of rooms the following year. The college consults regularly with the JCR and MCR on its policy of charging equal rents for all non-en suite rooms. 

In 2022, the college introduced a Residence Bursary scheme, whereby any student in receipt of a Cambridge Bursary receives a rent discount of £20 per week for all weeks of their tenancy; for these students the median rent is amongst the lowest of the Cambridge colleges.

Most undergraduate students live on the main site, and second years have the option of living at Swirles Court.

Girton, along with Newnham College, are the only colleges to charge the same fee for all undergraduate accommodation on their premises. The main site offers 348 rooms, rented for the entire year (38 or 39 weeks, depending on the term dates).

===Graduates and fellows===
Since 2017, graduate students live in Swirles Court. It is part of the Eddington development in West Cambridge. One house on Huntingdon Road is used to accommodate research fellows. The Graduate Union specifically identified Girton as providing an insufficient amount of housing to married postgraduates, with no rooms available at Swirles Court for married students. 

====Swirles Court====
Swirles Court, part of the Eddington neighbourhood of the North West Cambridge development, opened in 2017. This accommodation annexe provides up to 325 ensuite single rooms for graduates and for second-year undergraduates and above.

It is named after Bertha Swirles (Lady Jeffreys), a Girton alumna. Swirles is open year-round to student living. It also has a college porter on staff 24/7, separate laundry facilities and a separate mailing address from the main college. Girton College leases the buildings from the University on a five-year renewable contract.

====Wolfson Court====
In 2017, Girton College moved the graduate accommodation from Wolfson Court (near the city centre) to Swirles Court. Wolfson Court was an annexe to Girton College built on a site. It was funded by the 1969 Centenary Appeal, and designed in 1971 by Cambridge architects David Wyn Roberts and Geoffrey Clarke. It had its own catering and accommodation facilities (106 single student rooms). Queen Elizabeth Court, which was linked to the main building and comprised two blocks of three linked houses (36 large single student rooms), was built for the purpose of graduate accommodation in 1992. It was frequently used as a location for conferences. The site also contained a nursery, operated by Bright Horizons.

==Main site==

===Architecture===
The initial and defining parts of the college were designed by Alfred Waterhouse: The architect built the main site with the Old Wing, the Hospital Wing, the Orchard Wing, the Stanley library and Old Kitchens between 1873 and 1886, as well as the parapetted gatehouse tower in 1886 and 1887. The red-brick design (English bond) is typical of Victorian architecture, and is enhanced by black mortar courses and terracotta details to the eaves, windows and doorways. The roofs are steeply pitched with crested tiles. In 1913, the site consisted of 33 acres.

===Library===

Girton&#x27;s first library, the Stanley library, was established in 1884 with a donation from Lady Stanley of Alderley. It was considered to be luxurious and comfortable, as it contained stained-glass windows, leather furniture and a large chimney. Books were acquired mostly through donations. By 1932 the collection had become so large that a new library was opened. Designed by Michael Waterhouse, descendant of the architects Paul Waterhouse and Alfred Waterhouse, the new library consisted of an upper reading room, crafted in oak, and a ground floor, in which the book collections are held. An annexe containing archives was added in 1967. The Duke building, a modern library extension offering IT facilities and a reading room, was opened in 2005. Named after Alison Duke, a fellow and major donor, the building was designed by Allies and Morrison. It won a RIBA National Award in 2006, a SCONUL Library Design Award in 2007, and a Civic Trust Award in 2007.

===Chapel===

Emily Davies first mooted plans for a chapel in Girton College in 1890; however, building only started in 1899, four years after the death of Henrietta Stanley, Baroness Stanley of Alderley, who had opposed the idea and instead favoured improving staff salaries and equipment. The chapel, which was designed by Alfred and Paul Waterhouse, was completed in 1901, and inaugurated on 23 May 1902. It seats about 200 people and the interior is held very simply with the exception of oak carvings at the Chancel end and on two long desks in front of the choir seats, which were crafted by the mathematician Margaret Meyer, along with students and friends of the college. In 1910 came a fine Harrison &amp; Harrison organ, the purchase of which was made possible through donations from students and friends of the college. The organ was rebuilt in 1974 and can still be found in the college chapel. A second organ was acquired in 2002.

In 1952, the year of the Golden jubilee of the inauguration, a stained-glass window was erected. In the Girton Review, the college&#x27;s official termly newsletter, from Michaelmas term 1955, a description of the glass window can be found:
 The centre light depicts Our Lord in Majesty, as it were the culmination of the Tree of Jesse and in the form described in the book of Revelation. The Lamb who may alone open the book sealed with seven seals is shown at the foot of the light, while the descent of the Holy Spirit in the form of a dove is shown at its apex. The flowers and fruit in the centre light represent the Tree of Jesse. The two lights flanking that in the centre depict scenes from the Passion of Our Lord. On the left are the entry into Jerusalem, the Betrayal of Judas and the Ecce Homo: on the right, the Scourging, Christ bearing His Cross, the Crucifixion. The scenes are linked with a pattern of leaves. Palm is used for the Entry into Jerusalem, and among other plants represented are the Star of Bethlehem, the Passion Flower and the Thorn. The lowest medallion on the right, portraying the crucifixion, is darker than the others, suggesting the darkness that was over the land. The uppermost tracery light depicts the Pelican in her Piety, and the remaining tracery lights contain the symbols of the Passion; the betrayal money, Peter’s lantern, pillar and scourges, dice, ladder and nails, hammer and pincers, crown of thorns and chalice.
In the original statement of aims and scope for the &quot;Proposed College for Women&quot; in 1867, it was announced that religious services and instruction would be in accordance with the principles of the Church of England, but where conscientious objections were entertained, attendance would not be necessary. A modified version of this statement appears in the modern college statutes, where it reads that &quot;services in the Chapel shall normally be held in accordance with the practice of the Church of England, but other religious services may also be held there.&quot; At the outset, Chapel was used for morning prayers, usually said by the Mistress, and for Sunday services, taken by clergy of various denominations. Today, at least two services are held on a weekly basis: Evensong on Sunday at 5:30pm, and Compline on Tuesday at 9:10pm. They are organised by the college&#x27;s part-time chaplain, who is assisted by student chapel wardens. The Mistress holds general responsibility in regard to services in the chapel, which she partly delegates to the Chapel Committee. The current Chaplain is the Rev. Dr Tim Boniface, who is also a bye-fellow at Girton, and a jazz musician.

===Gardens===

When the land was bought, trees were planted on bare land. Today, the gardens of Girton are large compared to those of other Cambridge colleges. They became a preoccupation for the college in 1875 when Miss Davies handed over the responsibility for developing the gardens to Miss Bernard. A pond, which originated from excavations for the construction of the Stanley library and the Orchard Wing, dates from 1884. A 1983 report of the college ornithologists&#x27; society found sixty species of birds, and a moth report from 1986 recorded over 100 species. The Fellows&#x27; garden was redesigned in 1992 and hosts a green theatre. A rare breed of black squirrels can sometimes be seen in Girton.

===Lawrence Room===

In 1934, the Lawrence Room on the college main site was dedicated to be the college museum. Named after Girton natural scientist Amy Lawrence, it houses an Anglo-Saxon, an Egyptian and a Mediterranean collection. Before the establishment of the Lawrence room in 1934, antiquities had been stored in and around the college library. Donations allowed for refurbishments in 1946, 1961, 1991 and 2008. In 2010/11, Lawrence room is opened once a week to visitors. The exhibitions are free of charge.

The Anglo-Saxon collection stems from excavations on the college main site made during construction work in 1881 and 1886, when an Anglo-Saxon cemetery, presumably from the fifth and sixth century AD, was discovered. Most findings, such as domestic utensils and personal items, were long held in the Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology in Cambridge. Some were only returned to the college as late as in 2008.

The highlight of the Egyptian collection consists of a portrait mummy bearing the inscription &quot;Hermionê Grammatikê&quot; (translation: &quot;Hermione the literary lady&quot; or &quot;Hermione the language teacher&quot;). It is one of the most widely reproduced and famous portrait mummies. Dating from the first century AD, it was discovered in the Roman cemetery of Hawara by the archeologist Flinders Petrie in 1911. &quot;Hermione&quot; is thought to be an 18- to 25-year-old girl from a wealthy background. Petrie and his wife Hilda wanted the mummy to go to a women&#x27;s college due to its inscription. Funds were gathered, and in 1911 &quot;Hermione&quot; moved to Girton College, where she has remained since then. The Egyptian collection also holds four mummified baby crocodiles, which were thought to bring favour of Sobek, the ancient god of fertility and water. They were presented to the college by Alfred Waterhouse senior, the father of architect Alfred Waterhouse.

The Mediterranean collection offers both Classical and pre-Classical material. A collection of Greek Tanagra figurines, which date to the fourth and third century BC, form the most remarkable pieces of this collection.

===People&#x27;s Portraits===
Since 2002, Girton has held the millennial exhibition of the Royal Society of Portrait Painters, entitled &quot;People&#x27;s Portraits&quot;. The exhibition is open to the public. 

The exhibition, aimed at showing and representing &quot;ordinary&quot; British people at the verge of the 21st century, toured Britain in 2000. Girton then won the bid to house the collection, to which new works are added annually. All pictures were created by, usually newly elected, members of the Royal Society of Portrait Painters. The collection currently comprises 60 paintings, by artists including Anthony Morris, Daphne Todd, June Mendoza and Alastair Adams, the current president of the Society. The choice of Girton, one of the largest and thus most diverse colleges in Cambridge, to hold the collection is believed to reflect the college ethos of community and interest in art.

A reception was held on 11 May 2023 to celebrate the collection, with Dame Marina Warner invitied as guest speaker to give a speech at the reception.

===Social spaces===
Girton&#x27;s Social Hub, nicknamed &quot;Schlub&quot; by the students, acts as both a café for students during the day and a bar in the evenings. Handmade paninis and pizzas are available during the day and pints as cheap as £2.70 are available during the day. Girton&#x27;s cellar bar, nicknamed &quot;Deep Schlub&quot; by students, contains a pool table, booths and a social space for students to socialise in the evenings to take a break from their demanding work schedule. The &quot;Deep Schlub&quot; also hosts college &quot;bops&quot; organised by the JCR committee (college student council). The &quot;Deep Schlub&quot; was reopened in 2023 after renovation, and is now a fully stocked bar with its own pool table.

===Proposed new buildings on main site===
Following an initial masterplan submission in 2016 and resubmission in 2022, an outline planning application to construct new residential accommodation, ancillary meeting space, an auditorium and relocated sports facilities was approved by South Cambridgeshire District Council in June 2023. New buildings would provide 405 rooms for student accommodation mostly to allow for relocation from Swirles Court along with long-term planned growth of postgraduates.&lt;ref name=&quot;Planning_22/00887/OUT&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Student life==

=== Formal halls ===
Among all Cambridge colleges, Girton and King&#x27;s have the fewest formal halls, at only once per week. Formal halls typically accommodate around 160 students and guests, with tickets costing £14 and £19 respectively, as of 2024.

=== Sport teams ===
Girton College has a variety of student-run sports teams and it provides its own sports pitches for cricket, football, hockey, netball and volleyball. The Girton College &quot;Cloud Leopards&quot; (founded in 2011) are the college lacrosse division one team, hosting meetings against Girton&#x27;s sister college in Oxford. An extensive refurbishment of the pitches was completed in 2009. There are men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s teams for badminton, football, hockey, rowing (Girton College Boat Club) and rugby. Hockey has a mixed team as well. Cricket, cross country, lacrosse, netball, squash, swimming, table tennis, tennis, volleyball and waterpolo teams are open to both male and female participants. The college has outdoor tennis and indoor squash courts, and a gym. The indoor-heated swimming pool has been in use since 1900. A one-mile running path leads around the college.

In 1995 the men&#x27;s football team won Cuppers for the first time and in 1997–98 they followed this up by winning their first League Championship. in 2003–04, Girton won the League Championship for a second time.

=== Music ===
The college has a strong history of music, which is supported by the university&#x27;s Chairman of the Faculty Board of Music, also Director of Studies in Music at Girton. In the last decade, the college has consistently been within the top three colleges for music in the university. In 2005, the highest ever first-class honours in the music Tripos was attained by a Girtonian. The student-run and fellow-led Girton College Music Society hosts weekly concerts in term time, as well as termly orchestral concerts. The college provides four practice grand pianos (including a Steinway Model B), a double-manual harpsichord and two organs. Moreover, all undergraduate music students are provided with a practice piano in their room for the duration of their course. The chapel&#x27;s organ is a four-manual, crafted by the Swiss firm St. Martin and acquired in 2002.

The chapel choir has 28 members and sings Choral Evensong (Sunday) and Compline (Tuesday) in the college chapel every week. The choir has released eight CDs. Girton grants two undergraduate organ scholarships for £300 per annum, choral scholarships for £100 per annum each, and choral exhibitions.

=== Societies ===
Admitting undergraduate students studying all subjects except for the History of Art and Education Triposes, the college hosts a variety of student-run societies which cater for a wide range of interests. Many subjects have their own societies including Biology, History, Economics (Joan Robinson society), Geography, Music, Medicine, MML and Law. There is furthermore the Art society, the Film society and the Girton Amateur Dramatic Society (GADS) which produces around two plays per term. Finally, Girton Amnesty and the Orchestra on the Hill serve students with specific interest in human rights and music, respectively.

=== Spring Ball ===

Girton Spring Ball is understood to have evolved from a traditional dance, the earliest record of which dates to 1883; it was only in the mid-1900s that the Ball began to resemble its contemporary form, notably in 1969 when the College celebrated its centenary anniversary. Currently, the Ball is usually held annually on the Friday after the end of Lent term, contrasting with most other Cambridge Colleges who host May Balls. It is organised by a committee of around 20 current Girton students.

==Notable alumni and fellows==
The mistress is the head of house and the position was previously held by a human geographer, Susan Smith. The position is currently held by Elisabeth Kendall. The college is home to an interdisciplinary group of critical social scientists. It also has a tradition in heterodox economics, spearheaded by Joan Robinson.

==Symbolism==

===Arms===

The college applied for a coat-of-arms derived from the arms of its founders and benefactors: H. R. Tomkinson, Madame Bodichon (née Leigh Smith), Henrietta Stanley, Baroness Stanley of Alderley (daughter of the 13th Viscount Dillon), and Emily Davies who did not have arms and was instead represented by the Welsh colours, vert and argent. Edward Earle Dorling submitted a variety of designs to the council, however the task was not easy. &quot;A patch-work of elaborate charges and many colours was to be avoided. Mr Tomkinson&#x27;s fascinating martlets and Lady Stanley&#x27;s lion had to be abandoned with regret, as was also a design of green and silver chequers which would have given more prominence to Miss Davies.&quot;

Finally, in 1928 the design was accepted by all and the college was granted the following:

We … grant and assign unto The Mistress and Governors of Girton College the Arms following that is to say: Quarterly Vert and Argent a cross flory countercharged a Roundel Ermine and in the second and third quarters a Crescent Gules, … to be borne and used for ever, hereafter by the Mistress and Governors of Girton College and by their Successors upon Seals Shields or otherwise according to the Laws of Arms.

===Gown===

The college gown has the standard pattern of an undergraduate gown at the University of Cambridge, with the sleeves sewn up for a length of eight inches from the shoulder. The proper dress of the gown and cap was observed at the first honorary degree to a woman, given to the Queen, an LL.D. on 21 October 1948. As academic dress, gowns were adopted with little changes (the sleeves had to be closed so that even in the summer, when women wear short-sleeved dresses their bare shoulders do not show), and square caps were chosen as head-dress. However, to remember the time when women were not allowed to obtain degrees of the University of Cambridge, no gowns are worn during the college feast, when students in their final year are celebrated.

===Grace===
Girton College has a traditional two-word grace and a more recent full grace, both in Latin. On regular formal occasions, such as formal halls, the two-word graces are spoken, &quot;Benedictus benedicat&quot; (May the blessed one give blessing) at the start of the meal, and &quot;Benedictus benedicatur&quot; (May praise be given to the blessed one) at the end of the meal. There is evidence that the two-word grace was used in 1926, and it is thought the two-word grace was used from the foundation of the college onwards.

The words and the music of the full grace were composed in 1950 by Alison Duke and Jill Vlasto respectively. The grace came after the admission of women to full membership of the university so as to bring Girton in line with the other colleges. It is used on the most formal occasions, such as the Foundation Dinner, and it is sung once a year at the College Feast, which all final year students attend.

Full grace (in Latin):
=== Songs ===

The oldest college song, &quot;The Girton Pioneers&quot;, was composed by several students in Hitchin in 1873. Its purpose was to celebrate the first three students who sat the Tripos examinations in 1871. It is sung with the tune of &quot;The British Grenadiers&quot;. This is the first stanza:

&lt;poem&gt;Some talk of Senior Wranglers,
And some of Double Firsts,
And truly of their species
These are not the worst;
But of all the Cambridge heroes
There’s none that can compare
With Woodhead, Cook and Lumsden,
The Girton Pioneers.&lt;/poem&gt;

More recently, Girtonians have become known for their chant of &quot;We are Girton – super Girton! No one likes us, but we don&#x27;t care!&quot;, in imitation of Millwall Football Club fans&#x27; famous chant: &quot;No one likes us, we don&#x27;t care&quot;. The reference to &quot;no one likes us&quot; is supposedly due to the relative distance of Girton in comparison to many of the other colleges. In 2016 the Casual Choir performed &quot;Long Way to Girton College&quot;, an adaptation of &quot;It&#x27;s a Long Way to Tipperary&quot;, written and arranged by two choir members.

The college song &quot;I love to go a-bicycling&quot;, sung with the tune of &quot;I love to go a-wandering&quot; also alludes to Girton&#x27;s 2.5 miles distance from the town centre. It has been sung since the 1960s. For example, the second stanza reads:
&lt;poem&gt;But when I climb up Castle Hill
In the wind and squall
A strong desire does then me fill
To be-e at New Hall.

&quot;Chorus:&quot;
Fol-de-re, Fol-de-ra,
Fol-de-re, Fol-de-ra-a-a-a-
... To be-e at New Hall.&lt;/poem&gt;

Another song, composed in 1972 by JCR president Anna Cocconi, is called &quot;Song to Wolfson Court&quot;. The annexe of the college was opened in that year. Students often found fault with the modern architecture of the building, which was less spacious and elegant than the main site. The first two stanzas go as follows:
&lt;poem&gt; In a wheat field, west of Cambridge,
Off a lane called Clarkson Road,
Wolfson Court is standing proudly;
Let its story now be told

Hundred rooms with running water,
Could you ever ask for more?
Not unless you choose a boy-friend,
Meas’ring over five foot four!&lt;/poem&gt;

<doc id="457567" wikidata="Q853342" url="?curid=457567" title="House of Braganza">
<text>The Most Serene House of Braganza (), also known as the Brigantine dynasty (&quot;dinastia Brigantina&quot;), is a dynasty of emperors, kings, princes, and dukes of Portuguese origin which reigned in Europe and the Americas.

The house was founded by Afonso I, 1st Duke of Braganza, illegitimate son of King John I of Portugal of the House of Aviz, and would eventually grow into one of the wealthiest and most powerful noble houses of Iberia during the Renaissance period. The Braganzas came to rule the Kingdom of Portugal and the Algarves after successfully deposing the Philippine Dynasty in the Restoration War, resulting in the Duke of Braganza becoming King John IV of Portugal, in 1640. The Braganzas ruled Portugal and the Portuguese Empire from 1640 and with the creation of the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves, in 1815, and the subsequent independence of the Empire of Brazil, in 1822, the Braganzas came to rule as the monarchs of Brazil.

The House of Braganza produced 15 Portuguese monarchs and all four Brazilian monarchs, numerous consorts to various European kingdoms, such as Catherine of Braganza (wife of Charles II of England who introduced tea to Britain) and Maria Isabel of Braganza (wife of Ferdinand VII of Spain who founded the El Prado Museum), as well as sometime candidates for the thrones of Poland and Greece, Infante Manuel, Count of Ourém and Pedro, Duke of Braganza, respectively, and numerous other notable figures in the histories of Europe and the Americas. The Braganzas were deposed from their thrones in Europe and the Americas at the turn of the 19th–20th centuries, when Emperor Pedro II was deposed in Brazil, in 1889, and when King Manuel II was deposed in Portugal, in 1910.

== Feudal establishment ==
The House of Braganza originated with Afonso I, an illegitimate son of King John I of Portugal, founder of the House of Aviz, and Inês Pires. Though Afonso was illegitimate, his father valued and cared for him a great deal, demonstrated by his arrangement of Afonso&#x27;s marriage to Beatriz Pereira de Alvim, daughter of Nuno Álvares Pereira, Portugal&#x27;s most important general and a personal friend of King John I. As well as increasing his social status by his marriage into a well-established house, Afonso was also ceded the title of Count of Barcelos.

With his newly consolidated place in the nobility of Portugal, Afonso commenced what would be a highly successful political and social career. In 1415 he took part in the Conquest of Ceuta, alongside his father, his brothers, and the leading members of the nobility and military. By the time of his father&#x27;s death in 1433, Afonso had won favour with his brother, King Duarte I and the rest of high Portuguese society. With his brother&#x27;s premature death in 1438, a regency was established for Afonso&#x27;s nephew, the 6 year old King Afonso V, under the leadership of the king&#x27;s mother, Leonor of Aragon, and later Afonso&#x27;s brother, Infante Pedro, Duke of Coimbra. The Duke of Coimbra&#x27;s regency, however, soon proved unpopular and Afonso quickly became the King&#x27;s preferred advisor. On 30 December 1442, the Duke of Coimbra, still the King&#x27;s regent and thus acting in his name, created Afonso as the Duke of Braganza, as a gesture of good will and reconciliation between the two brothers. Afonso&#x27;s elevation to the dukedom, the highest level of nobility, marked the foundation of the House of Braganza, which was to become a key family in Portuguese history.

As a result of the hard work and success of Afonso I, his children all secured successful positions and lived privileged lives. Afonso I&#x27;s first son, Afonso of Braganza, was a prominent member of the nobility, having been ceded, by his grandfather, Nuno Álvares Pereira, the lucrative and powerful title of Count of Ourém, in 1422. He was an accomplished diplomat, and served as the king&#x27;s representative at the Council of Basel in 1436, and the Council of Florence in 1439. In 1451, the Count of Ourém was made Marquis of Valença and escorted Infanta Leonor of Portugal to her husband Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor. Later, in 1458, he participated in the capture and conquest of Alcácer-Ceguer. The Marquis of Valença, however, died in 1460, one year before his father and therefore did not succeed him. Afonso I&#x27;s first daughter, Isabel of Braganza, married Infante João, Lord of Reguengos de Monsaraz, thus relinking the House of Braganza to the Royal House of Portugal. Isabel&#x27;s strategic marriage proved successful, and produced four children, whose descendants would be some of the most important in Iberian history. Afonso I&#x27;s last child and successor, Fernando I, Duke of Braganza, continued his legacy of prominence in the military and society.

When Fernando I was born, in 1403, his grandfather, Nuno Álvares Pereira, ceded him the title of Count of Arraiolos. Fernando became an accomplished military man, participating in various Portuguese imperial campaigns. Though Fernando I was a popular and powerful member of the nobility, he did not always find himself in the favour of the king, most notably exemplified when Fernando I openly declaimed King Duarte I, at the Portuguese Cortes, on the topic of the rescue and recovery of the King&#x27;s brother, Infante Fernando, Lord of Salvaterra de Magos from the Moors. However, Fernando I became a favourite of both the royal and imperial government and of King Afonso V, earning him the position of Governor of Ceuta and the titles of Marquis of Vila Viçosa and Count of Neiva.

Fernando I&#x27;s children, by his wife, Joana de Castro, Lady of Cadaval, continued to enlarge the influence of the House of Braganza. Of his nine children, all six who survived to adulthood established themselves either through positions or marriages, though the actions of King João II would seek to weaken their influence. Fernando I&#x27;s first son and successor, Fernando II, was initially a bright and popular nobleman, but his conflict with King João II would see his and the House&#x27;s downfall. His second son, João of Braganza, 1st Marquis of Montemor-o-Novo, was an accomplished military man and was made Constable of Portugal. Fernando&#x27;s third son, Afonso of Braganza, became a popular nobleman of society and was made 1st Count of Faro. The Duke&#x27;s fourth son, Álvaro of Braganza, inherited the fiefs of his mother, becoming the 5th Lord of Ferreira, 4th Lord of Cadaval, and 1st Lord of Tentúgal. Fernando&#x27;s eldest surviving daughter, Beatriz of Braganza, married Pedro de Meneses, 1st Marquis of Vila Real. Fernando&#x27;s last surviving child, Guiomar of Braganza, married Henrique de Meneses, 4th Count of Viana do Alentejo. Ultimately, however, Fernando I&#x27;s children and grandchildren would suffer great difficulty under the reign of King João II.

By the tenure of the third duke, Fernando II, the House of Braganza was undoubtedly one of the greatest noble houses of Portugal and Iberia as a whole. Fernando II continued the House&#x27;s legacy of acquisition and gained the title of Duke of Guimarães. To the Duke and the House&#x27;s downfall, however, King João II&#x27;s reign concerned itself with the royal consolidation of power and the diminishment of the nobility. Fernando II, having been a prominent and powerful nobleman, was accused of treason and executed by King João II in 1483; the House&#x27;s titles and properties were merged into the crown and its members exiled to Castile.

Due to their father&#x27;s misfortunes, Fernando II&#x27;s children, from his marriage to Isabel of Viseu, daughter of Infante Fernando, Duke of Viseu and Beja, initially had a tumultuous childhood; but King João II&#x27;s successor, King Manuel I, who had previously himself been the Duke of Beja, chose to forgive the House and re-grant them all their properties in exchange for their loyalty. Fernando II&#x27;s oldest surviving son and successor, Jaime I, returned to Portugal and reestablished himself at Vila Viçosa, the former seat of the Dukes. Fernando II&#x27;s only other surviving son, Dinis of Braganza, married Beatriz de Castro Osório, Countess of Lemos, and had four children with her.

== Portuguese Renaissance ==
Jaime I&#x27;s tenure as Duke of Braganza was one of restoration and grandness. Upon his return to Portugal from exile, Jaime took possession of the House&#x27;s formerly confiscated properties. In order to establish a new image for the House, he ordered the construction of a new seat for the House, which would become one of the largest palaces in Iberia, the Ducal Palace of Vila Viçosa. Jaime I&#x27;s restoration also continued with the House&#x27;s relations with the King, Jaime I having becoming a favourite of King Manuel I and even once his temporary heir. The Duke also had his share of scandal, having funded the conquest of the city of Azamor, for the royal crown as, as punishment for his ordering the murder of his first wife, Leonor Pérez de Guzman, daughter of Juan Alfonso Pérez de Guzmán, 3rd Duke of Medina Sidonia.

The children of Jaime I, both the two first children by his first wife, Leonor of Pérez de Guzman, and the later eight children by his second wife, Joana of Mendoça, all saw successful lives under the restored House of Braganza. Jaime I&#x27;s first daughter, Isabel of Braganza, married Infante Duarte, Duke of Guimarães, and had three children, while his first son and successor, Teodósio I, was a successful prince of the Portuguese Renaissance. Five of Jaime I&#x27;s children, Jaime, Maria, Fulgêncio, Teotónio, and Vicência, all entered into religious orders. The Duke&#x27;s second daughter, Joana of Braganza, married Bernardino de Cardenas, 3rd Marquis of Elche, and his third daughter, Eugénia of Braganza, married Francisco de Melo, 2nd Marquis of Ferreira. Jaime I&#x27;s only other son, other than Teodósio I, to not enter into the church, Constantino of Braganza, married Maria de Melo, daughter of D. Rodrigo de Melo, 1st Marquis of Ferreira, but had no children. Constantino was famed as a great officer of the Portuguese Empire, having served as the Viceroy of Portuguese India and Captain of Ribeira Grande, among other positions.
The fifth Duke, Teodósio I, is remembered for being the personification of the Portuguese Renaissance. A patron of the arts and scholarly noble, Teodósio I maintained the prestige of the House of Braganza, although not leaving a significant mark on the House&#x27;s history. The Duke notably ceded the Dukedom of Guimarães to Infante Duarte of Portugal as the dowry of his sister, Isabel of Braganza.

Teodósio I&#x27;s second son, Jaime of Braganza, died fighting alongside King Sebastião I at the Battle of Alcácer Quibir. The Duke&#x27;s only daughter, Isabel of Braganza, married Miguel Luis de Meneses, 1st Duke of Caminha, though their union had no issue. Teodósio I&#x27;s first child and successor, João I, lived a very different life from Teodósio I&#x27;s calm and relatively peaceful tenure, having been involved in the controversies of the Portuguese succession crisis of 1580 and the subsequent War of the Portuguese Succession.

João I&#x27;s tenure as Duke was one intertwined with controversy and intrigue. Having been married to Infanta Catarina, daughter of Infante Duarte, Duke of Guimarães, and thus a grandchild of King Manuel I, during the succession crisis of 1580, the couple pressed their claims to the Portuguese throne. Though Infanta Catarina was a popular claimant, her Habsburg cousin was eventually crowned Philip I of Portugal and the Iberian Union was established. In an attempt at reconciliation with the Brigantine House, King Philip I renewed the title of Constable of Portugal, which João I had held previously, to the Duke&#x27;s first son, Teodósio II, alongside other title and land grants to the Duke and the House.

João I&#x27;s daughters, Maria, Serefina, Querubina, and Angélica, were some of the most eligible ladies of Portugal and all Iberia, though the only one to marry was Serefina of Braganza, who married Castilian Juan Fernandez Pacheco, 5th Duke of Escalona. The Duke&#x27;s oldest son and successor, Teodósio II, famously fought in the Battle of Alcácer Quibir at the age of ten and later became an accomplished general. João I&#x27;s second son, Duarte of Braganza, was made 1st Marquis of Frechilla, and the Duke&#x27;s third son, Alexandre of Braganza, became Archbishop of Évora, both receiving their titles and many concessions from King Philip I when the monarch was making amends with the House of Braganza. Unlike his other sons, João I&#x27;s last son, Filipe of Braganza, died without marriage, children, or titles.

The seventh Duke, Teodósio II, became famous at a young age, having been made page to King Sebastião I and having marched into the Battle of Alcácer Quibir, alongside the King and his uncle, Jaime of Braganza, at the age of ten. Teodósio II later pledged his allegiance and became a faithful countryman to the Philippine Dynasty, having even defended Lisbon against King Philip I&#x27;s rival claimant to the throne, António, Prior of Crato, who had been acclaimed, by his supporters, as King António I of Portugal. In recognition for his military prowess, Teodósio II was made Constable of Portugal. The Duke&#x27;s support and service to the Philippine Dynasty, earned the Braganzas more lands and titles and, by 1640, the House had amassed around 80,000 vassals, alongside numerous churches, orders, and institutions under its patronage.

In 1603, Teodósio II married Ana de Velasco y Girón, daughter of Castilian Juan Fernández de Velasco, 5th Duke of Frías, and had four children with her. The Duke&#x27;s first son and successor, João II, raise the House of Braganza to new heights of power, having launched the Portuguese Restoration War and been acclaimed King João IV of Portugal, thus installing the House as the ruling dynasty of Portugal. Teodósio II&#x27;s second son, Duarte of Braganza, was made Lord of Vila do Conde and became a diplomat, serving at the court of Ferdinand III, Holy Roman Emperor, but later died a prisoner as a cost of the Restoration War. Teodósio II&#x27;s two other children, Alexandre and Catarina, both died without children, titles, or marriage.

== Throne of Portugal ==

By 1640 the wise policies of D. Philip I in respect of Portugal were long past. The country was overtaxed, Portuguese colonies were left unprotected, and the King Philip III of Portugal no longer had the trust or support of most Portuguese nobility. He was especially loathed by the powerful Portuguese guild of merchants. Portugal, like the rest of Philip&#x27;s kingdoms, was on the verge of rebellion.

The eighth Duke of Braganza, D. João II of Braganza, had inherited the claim of his grandmother, Infanta Catarina of Portugal, and the remoter claim through of his grandfather João I of Braganza. Because of his claims, the discontent Portuguese nobility asked João II to lead their restoration as their king.

According to court historians, D. João II was a modest man without particular ambitions to the crown. Legend says that his wife, Dona Luisa de Guzmán, daughter of the duke of Medina-Sidonia, urged him to accept the offer, saying &quot;I&#x27;d rather be queen for one day than duchess for a lifetime.&quot; He accepted the leadership of the rebellion, which was successful, and was acclaimed João IV of Portugal on 1 December 1640.

After the accession of the Braganzas to the throne, the duchy was linked to the Crown. &quot;Duke of Braganza&quot; became the traditional title of the heir to the throne, together with Prince of Brazil and, later, Prince Royal of Portugal.

João&#x27;s accession resulted in the Portuguese Restoration War with Spain. The sovereignty of Portugal&#x27;s new dynasty would not be recognized until 1668 during the reign of João&#x27;s son, Afonso VI.

The zenith of the Braganza dynasty came with the long reign of D. João V (1706–1750), who ruled with grandeur and piety. The reign of D. José I, son of D. João V, was marked by the great earthquake, which struck Lisbon in 1755. The political genius of his reign was the 1st Marquis of Pombal. The end of the 18th century was characterized by stability, under the rule of Dona Maria I (1777–1816), who discharged Pombal at her accession. Because Maria&#x27;s recurrent mental illness rendered her incapable of governing, her son João assumed the role of head of government in 1792.

== Realm in Brazil ==

In 1807, faced with impending Napoleonic invasion, the Braganzas transferred their royal court to the State of Brazil, Portugal&#x27;s largest colony. Some time after they had crossed the Atlantic, a royal decree changed the status of Brazil from a Portuguese colony into kingdom alongside Portugal, and the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves was formed. In 1821, D. João VI, who succeeded in 1816, returned to Portugal.

D. Pedro, Prince Royal of Portugal, Brazil, and the Algarves, the eldest son of D. João VI and also regent in Brazil, sided with the Brazilian rebels in January 1822. He was acclaimed Emperor D. Pedro I of an independent Brazil in 1822, founding the Empire of Brazil. D. Pedro I ruled Brazil until 1831, when he abdicated in favor of his young son D. Pedro II, and returned to Portugal to aid his daughter D. Maria II (see below).

D. Pedro II, being only 6 years old at the time of his coronation, had a regency established. The regency would rule until 1840, when the Emperor turned 14 years old. His reign would last until 1889, when the Brazilian monarchy was abolished. His reign would see the abolition of slavery in Brazil, economic growth, and very long periods of tranquility and development in his empire.

== Warring branches ==

In Portugal, D. Pedro I of Brazil became King as D. Pedro IV (1826), but no one wanted to re-establish the union of Portugal and Brazil. Pedro abdicated the Portuguese throne in favor of his daughter Princess Maria da Glória, then seven years old. D. Pedro&#x27;s brother D. Miguel was to act as Regent, and to marry Maria when she came of age. In 1828, Miguel instead proclaimed himself King of Portugal and repudiated the liberal constitution granted by D. João VI, trying to establish an absolute monarchy.

In 1828, Maria II was forced into exile by her uncle, the new King Miguel I. Her father D. Pedro IV of Portugal returned from Brazil, launched a successful military campaign, from the Azores, against Miguel I. He finally defeated and exiled Miguel I in 1834. Though exiled, Miguel would not give up his claim to the throne and would establish the Miguelist branch of the House of Braganza. The strategic marriages of his children to the various royal houses of Europe would earn him the nickname the &quot;Grandfather of Europe&quot; (&quot;see Descendants of Miguel I of Portugal&quot;).

== First Reign of Brazil ==

On 7 September 1822, Dom Pedro of Braganza, Prince Royal of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves, member of the House of Braganza, heir apparent to the Portuguese throne and Regent of the Kingdom of Brazil, declared the country&#x27;s independence from the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves and was acclaimed Emperor of Brazil. On 12 October, the prince was acclaimed Pedro I, first Emperor of the newly created Empire of Brazil, a constitutional monarchy. In 1825, signing the treaty of Rio de Janeiro of this date, his father, King Dom João VI, recognized the independence of the new state, the former Portuguese dominion, now Empire of Brazil.

Pedro I encountered a number of crises during his reign. A secessionist rebellion in the Cisplatine Province in early 1825 and the subsequent attempt by the United Provinces of the Río de la Plata (later Argentina) to annex Cisplatina led the Empire into the failed Cisplatine War. In March 1826, João VI died and Pedro I inherited the Portuguese crown, briefly becoming King Pedro IV of Portugal before abdicating in favor of his eldest daughter, Maria II. The situation worsened in 1828 when the war in the south ended with Brazil&#x27;s loss of Cisplatina, which would become the independent republic of Uruguay. During the same year in Lisbon, Maria II&#x27;s throne was usurped by Prince Miguel, Pedro I&#x27;s younger brother.

Other difficulties arose when the Empire&#x27;s parliament opened in 1826. Pedro I, along with a significant percentage of the legislature, argued for an independent judiciary, a popularly elected legislature and a government which would be led by the emperor who held broad executive powers and prerogatives. Others in parliament argued for a similar structure, only with a less influential role for the monarch and the legislative branch being dominant in policy and governance.

The struggle over whether the government would be dominated by the emperor or by the parliament was carried over into debates from 1826 to 1831 on the establishment of the governmental and political structure. Unable to deal with the problems in both Brazil and Portugal simultaneously, the Emperor abdicated on behalf of his son, Pedro II, on 7 April 1831 and immediately sailed for Europe to restore his daughter to her throne.

== Second Reign of Brazil ==
Pedro I&#x27;s successor in Brazil was his five-year-old son, Pedro II. As the latter was still a minor, a weak regency was created. The power vacuum resulting from the absence of a ruling monarch as the ultimate arbiter in political disputes led to regional civil wars between local factions. Having inherited an empire on the verge of disintegration, Pedro II, once he was declared of age in 1840, at 14 years old, managed to bring peace and stability to the country, which eventually became an emerging international power. Brazil was victorious in three international conflicts (the Platine War, the Uruguayan War and the Paraguayan War) under Pedro II&#x27;s rule, and the Empire prevailed in several other international disputes and outbreaks of domestic strife. With prosperity and economic development came an influx of European immigration, including Protestants and Jews, although Brazil remained mostly Catholic. Slavery, which had initially been widespread, was restricted by successive legislation until its final abolition in 1888 by Princess Isabel.

Even though the last four decades of Pedro II&#x27;s reign were marked by continuous internal peace and economic prosperity, he had no desire to see the monarchy survive beyond his lifetime and made no effort to maintain support for the institution. The next in line to the throne was his daughter Isabel, but neither Pedro II nor the ruling classes considered a female monarch acceptable. Lacking any viable heir, the Empire&#x27;s political leaders saw no reason to defend the monarchy. Although there was no desire among the majority of Brazilians to change the country&#x27;s form of government, republicans began pressuring army officers to overthrow the monarchy. After a 58-year reign, on 15 November 1889 the Emperor was overthrown in a sudden coup d&#x27;état led by a clique of military leaders whose goal was the formation of a republic headed by a dictator, forming the First Brazilian Republic. Throughout the coup Pedro II dismissed all suggestions put forward by politicians and military leaders for quelling the rebellion. The Emperor and his family were exiled to the Portuguese kingdom and France. Although there was significant monarchist reaction after the fall of the Empire, this was thoroughly suppressed, and neither Pedro II nor his daughter and heiress supported a forced restoration.

== Constitutional Kings ==

In 1836, Queen Maria II of Portugal married Prince Ferdinand of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, later King Ferdinand II of Portugal. Despite the tradition of following the custom of patrilineal descent of royal houses, common throughout Europe, Article 5 of the Portuguese constitution of 1826 stated that &quot;The Reigning Dynasty of the Most Serene House of Braganza Shall Continue in the Person of Lady Princess Maria da Glória, by the Abdication and Cession of Her August Father Lord Pedro I, Emperor of Brazil, Legitimate Heir and Successor of Lord João VI.&quot;.

Maria II was succeeded in 1853 by her son D. Pedro V, a hard-working reformer who died prematurely in 1861 due to typhoid fever. D. Pedro V was succeeded by his brother D. Luís, as D. Pedro V had no children.

D. Luís I was succeeded in 1889 by his son D. Carlos I. Carlos I&#x27;s popularity dramatically declined after the British Ultimatum of 1890, whereby the Portuguese Empire ceded its claim to territories (known as the &quot;Pink Map&quot;) between Portuguese West Africa and Portuguese East Africa to the British. The unpopularity of the Ultimatum combined with the deposition of the Emperor Pedro II of Brazil resulted in a rise of Republican sentiment in Portugal.

King Carlos I was assassinated in 1908 together with his eldest son, D. Luís Filipe, Prince Royal of Portugal and Duke of Braganza, by republicans. His younger son, D. Manuel, Duke of Beja, survived the attack on his father and elder brother and became king as Manuel II, but was toppled two years later in the 1910 republican revolution. After the revolution, Manuel sought refuge in Great Britain and showed little inclination towards pursuing a restoration.

== Modern Braganzas ==
=== Portuguese Braganzas ===

After the revolution of 1910, King Manuel II settled in England until his death in 1932. He was childless, and descendants of Miguel of Braganza (the usurper of 1826) claimed the throne. In 1922, the two (of the now four) branches of the House of Braganza allegedly negotiated an pact under which Manuel II named as his heir Duarte Nuno of Braganza, grandson of Miguel. In 1942, Duarte Nuno, now Duke of Braganza, married a great-granddaughter of Emperor Pedro II of Brazil, uniting the two lines of the House. He remained the Braganza pretender until his death in 1976.

In 1950 Portugal repealed the law of exile against the Braganzas, and D. Duarte Nuno moved to the country in 1952.

Duarte Nuno was succeeded as pretender by his son, Duarte Pio of Braganza (born 1945). Duarte Pio served in the Portuguese Armed Forces and took the customary oath of allegiance to the Republic, but Portuguese monarchists recognize him as the pretender to the Portuguese throne. In 1995 he married Isabel de Herédia, a Portuguese businesswoman and descendant of Francisco Correia de Herédia, 1st Viscount of Ribeira Brava (a &quot;Vitalício&quot; title, meaning Life peerage). He worked actively in support of the independence of East Timor from Indonesia.

Duarte Pio and Isabel have three children. Duarte Pio&#x27;s oldest son is Afonso de Santa Maria, who bears the traditional titles of Prince of Beira (as heir apparent to the Portuguese pretender) and Duke of Barcelos (as heir apparent to the Duke of Braganza). He has a brother Dinis, Duke of Porto, and a sister, Infanta Maria Francisca.

Maria Pia of Saxe-Coburg and Braganza, who claimed she was an illegitimate daughter of King Carlos I of Portugal, began asserting that she was the heir to the throne from 1957. Allegedly, she adopted the Italian Rosario Poidimani, transferring her claimed rights to the Portuguese throne to him.

=== Brazilian Braganzas ===
After the military coup of 1889, Emperor Dom Pedro II settled in France until his death in 1891. His eldest daughter and family went to live in the Chateau d&#x27;Eu in French Normandy. She was recognized by Brazilian monarchists as Empress-in-Exile as Dona Isabel I of Brazil until her death in 1921.

She was succeeded by her grandson, Prince Pedro Henrique of Orléans-Braganza, as Head of the Imperial House of Brazil, and he by his son and current Head, Prince Luiz of Orléans-Braganza.

With the end of the banishment of the Imperial Family in 1920, some princes returned to live in Brazil, while another remained in Europe. After the end of World War II, Prince Pedro Henrique, then Head of the Imperial House and married to Princess Maria Elisabeth of Bavaria, returned to Brazil with his family.

The Imperial House of Brazil divided into rival branches because of the renunciation of Pedro de Alcântara, Prince of Grão-Pará in 1908 and the subsequent repudiation of that act by his descendants.

While some members of the two branches of the family subsequently lived in the Grão-Pará Palace, some married royalty or nobles and have lived in Europe, and others elsewhere in Brazil. A 1993 referendum on restoration of the monarchy was defeated, garnering 13.2 percent of the vote against 66 percent for the republic. Members of both the so-called Petropolis branch of Braganzas (Princes Pedro Gastão and his nephew, Joazinho of Orléans-Braganza) and the more broadly recognised Vassouras line of the Imperial Family led by Prince Luiz Gastão of Orléans-Braganza, participated in the restoration effort, and the Head of the Vassouras branch continues to lead a movement to restore the monarchy.

== Symbols ==
=== Wyvern ===

The traditional symbol and crest of the House of Braganza is a green wyvern, commonly taken to be a dragon, representing Saint George, patron saint of Portugal.

This symbol can be found in many different monuments in Portugal and Brazil, such as the Monument to the Independence of Brazil in São Paulo and in the palaces of the Imperial family in Rio de Janeiro and Petrópolis. It is famously found atop the Portuguese Crown Sceptre, the Sceptre of the Dragon and the Sceptre of the Emperor of Brazil.

The wyvern is also sometimes used as a supporter in the coat of arms of both the Brazilian and Portuguese branches of the family.

Because of its use in heraldry by the Braganza as the ruling house, and given Pedro IV&#x27;s link with Porto, a dragon was added to the old coat of arms of the municipality of Porto and is still a part of FC Porto&#x27;s coat of arms, who are nicknamed &quot;The Dragons&quot;.

=== Curse of the Braganzas ===
Since the 17th century, the House of Braganza has allegedly suffered from the Curse of the Braganzas (Portuguese: &quot;Maldição dos Braganças&quot;). For supposedly mistreating a Franciscan friar, a curse was purportedly placed on King João IV of Portugal, stating that never again would a first-born male of the Braganza Dynasty live long enough to succeed to the throne. Since the reign of King João IV, only three have reign as monarch in Portugal or Brazil.

<text>Independent Community &amp; Health Concern (formerly Independent Kidderminster Hospital and Health Concern), ICHC, was a political party based in Kidderminster, United Kingdom. The party was founded in 2000, having grown out of the campaign to restore the casualty unit at Kidderminster Hospital. Since 2015 it has successfully contested local elections within the Wyre Forest local government area, which includes Kidderminster. The party was deregistered on 9 November 2023.

== History ==

===Richard Taylor===

The party had one MP in the House of Commons, Richard Taylor, who won a surprise landslide victory in the 2001 general election standing for the Wyre Forest constituency, which includes Kidderminster. He was the only person not from a major party elected as an MP from an English constituency in the 2001 Parliament. Health Concern benefited from a decision by the Liberal Democrats not to put up a candidate of their own.

Taylor was re-elected as member for Wyre Forest in the 2005 election, albeit with a considerably reduced majority. The party lost its only seat in the 2010 election to the Conservative candidate, Mark Garnier, by a margin of 2,643 votes; the Liberal Democrats did field a candidate in 2010 having not done so in 2001 and 2005, which may have contributed to Taylor&#x27;s defeat.

Taylor was awarded an MBE in the Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours List in 2014, for services to Worcestershire, particularly Kidderminster Hospital.
===Deregistration===
It was deregistered on 9th November 2023

==Local government==
ICHC is also active in local government. It is currently the major party in the Progressive Alliance coalition which is currently in control of Wyre Forest District Council after getting 8 seats in the 2019 election. Before the 2004 local elections it held 16 seats on Wyre Forest District Council, making it the largest party, but in those elections it lost half of these seats to the Conservative Party. The 2005 local elections to Worcestershire County Council, held on the same day as the general election, also saw Health Concern perform poorly, losing five of its six seats. However, in the 2006 local elections for the district council, it held its own, making one net gain to take its representation from eight to nine. In the 2007 local elections its representation again increased, from nine to 10 members. The party then gradually lost seats on Wyre Forest District Council, with just 7 seats after the 2014 elections.

After the May 2014 local elections, Health Concern lost two district seats, reducing the overall number to seven, but managed to gain control of Bewdley Town Council, taking seven of the 13 available seats, a gain of three.

The party previously stood candidates for Shropshire Council, and had won seats, however it did not stand any candidates in the 2021 election.

Six former party members stood in the 2023 Wyre Forest District Council election, of which two were elected, Peter Young and Nicola Martin

==Organisation==
According to the Electoral Commission&#x27;s register of parties, its leader is Taylor, Peter Young is the nominating officer, Keith Robertson is treasurer, and Gerald Wheeler is campaigns officer. The party does have a formal membership. It had expenditure of about £12,000 and income of about £9,000 in the 2005 calendar year.

<text>Pandora&#x27;s Box () is a 1929 German silent drama film directed by Georg Wilhelm Pabst, and starring Louise Brooks, Fritz Kortner, and Francis Lederer. The film follows Lulu, a seductive young woman whose uninhibited nature brings ruin to herself and those who love her. It is based on Frank Wedekind&#x27;s plays &quot;Erdgeist&quot; (&quot;Earth Spirit&quot;, 1895) and &quot;Die Büchse der Pandora&quot; (&quot;Pandora&#x27;s Box&quot;, 1904).

Dismissed by critics on its initial release, &quot;Pandora&#x27;s Box&quot; was later rediscovered by film scholars as a classic of Weimar German cinema.

==Plot==

Lulu is the mistress of a respected, middle-aged newspaper publisher, Dr. Ludwig Schön. One day, she is delighted when an old man, her &quot;first patron&quot;, Schigolch, shows up at the door to her highly contemporary apartment. However, when Schön also arrives, she makes Schigolch hide on the balcony. Schön breaks the news to Lulu that he is going to marry Charlotte von Zarnikow, the daughter of the Minister of the Interior. Lulu tries to get him to change his mind, but when he discovers the disreputable-looking Schigolch, he leaves. Schigolch then introduces Lulu to Rodrigo Quast. Quast wants her to join his new variety act.

The next day, Lulu goes to see her best friend Alwa, who happens to be Schön&#x27;s son. Schön is greatly displeased to see her, but comes up with the idea to have her star in his son&#x27;s musical production to get her off his hands. However, Schön makes the mistake of bringing Charlotte to see the revue. When Lulu refuses to perform in front of her rival, Schön takes her into a storage room to try to persuade her otherwise, but she seduces him instead. Charlotte finds them embracing.

A defeated Schön resigns himself to marrying Lulu. While the wedding reception is underway, he is disgusted to find Lulu playfully cavorting with Schigolch and Quast in the bedchamber. He gets his pistol and threatens to shoot the interlopers, but Lulu cries out not to, that Schigolch is her father. Schigolch and Quast thus escape. Once they are alone, Schön insists his new wife take the gun and shoot herself. When Lulu refuses, the gun goes off in the ensuing struggle, and Schön is killed.

At her murder trial, Lulu is sentenced to five years for manslaughter. However, Schigolch and Quast trigger a fire alarm and spirit her away in the confusion. When Alwa finds her back in the Schön home, he confesses his feelings for her and they decide to flee the country. Countess Augusta Geschwitz, herself infatuated with Lulu, lets the fugitive use her passport. On the train, Lulu is recognized by another passenger, Marquis Casti-Piani. He offers to keep silent in return for money. He also suggests a hiding place, a ship used as an illegal gambling den.

Casti-Piani sells Lulu to an Egyptian for his brothel. Lulu, Geschwitz, Alwa, Schigolch, and Quast are now passengers on the gambling ship. Quast blackmails Lulu for financing for his new act. Desperate for money to pay the Egyptian off, Alwa cheats at cards and is caught. Having turned to Geschwitz for help, Lulu now asks Schigolch. He persuades a reluctant Geschwitz to lure Quast to a stateroom, where she kills him. Lulu, Schigolch, and Alwa flee in a rowboat as the police swarm the ship.

They end up in squalor, in a drafty London garret. On Christmas Eve, driven to prostitution, Lulu has the misfortune of picking a remorseful Jack the Ripper. Though he protests he has no money, she likes him and invites him to her lodging anyway. Jack is touched and secretly throws away his knife. Schigolch drags Alwa away before they are seen. Although he genuinely likes her, Jack spots a knife on a table as they embrace and cannot resist his urge to kill. Unaware of Lulu&#x27;s fate, Schigolch celebrates with a group of revelers and fulfills his lifelong wish to eat Christmas pudding while a broken Alwa (who sees Jack leave) follows a passing Salvation Army parade.

==Themes==
The title is a reference to Pandora of Greek mythology, who upon opening a box given to her by the Olympian gods released all evils into the world, leaving only hope behind. In the film this connection is made explicitly by the prosecutor in the trial scene.

The film is notable for its lesbian subplot in the attraction of Countess Augusta Geschwitz (in some prints Anna) to Lulu. The character of Geschwitz is defined by her masculine look, as she wears a tuxedo. Roberts resisted the idea of playing a lesbian.

==Production==
===Development===
&quot;Pandora&#x27;s Box&quot; had previously been adapted for the screen by Arzén von Cserépy in 1921 in Germany under the same title, with Asta Nielsen in the role of Lulu. As there was a musical, plays and other cinema adaptations at the time, the story of &quot;Pandora&#x27;s Box&quot; was well known. This allowed writer-director G. W. Pabst to take liberties with the story.

===Casting===
Pabst searched for months for an actress to play the lead character of Lulu. After seeing American actress Louise Brooks portray a circus performer in the 1928 Howard Hawks&#x27; film &quot;A Girl in Every Port&quot;, Pabst tried to get her on loan from Paramount Pictures. His offer was not made known to Brooks by the studio until she left Paramount over a salary dispute. Pabst&#x27;s second choice was Marlene Dietrich; Dietrich was actually in Pabst&#x27;s office, waiting to sign a contract to do the film, when Pabst got word of Brooks&#x27; availability. In an interview many years later, Brooks stated that Pabst was reluctant to hire Dietrich, as he felt she was too old at 27, and not a good fit for the character. Pabst himself later wrote that Dietrich was too knowing, while Brooks had both innocence and the ability to project sexuality, without coyness or premeditation.

===Filming===
The film was made in Berlin at the Nero-Film Studio between October 17 and November 23, 1928.
In shooting the film, Pabst drew on Brooks&#x27; background as a dancer with the pioneering modern dance ensemble Denishawn, &quot;choreographing&quot; the movement in each scene and limiting her to a single emotion per shot. Pabst was deft in manipulating his actors: he hired tango musicians to inspire Brooks between takes, coached a reluctant Alice Roberts through the lesbian sequences, and appeased Fritz Kortner, who did not hide his dislike for Brooks. During the first week or two of filming, Brooks went out partying every night with her current lover, George Preston Marshall, much to Pabst&#x27;s displeasure. When Marshall left, a relieved Pabst imposed a stricter lifestyle on his star.

Tensions rose between the performers as well, with Fritz Kortner refusing to speak to Brooks on the set. Per Brooks&#x27; own recollection, &quot;Kortner, like everybody else on the production, thought I had cast some blinding spell over Pabst that allowed me to walk through my part...  Kortner hated me. After each scene with me, he would pound off the set to his dressing room.&quot; Despite these tensions, Brooks reflected that Pabst used the actors&#x27; personal animosities and dispositions toward one another to the benefit of the film&#x27;s character dynamics, subtly urging them to sublimate their frustrations, and recalled his direction as masterful.

==Release==
===Reception and censorship===
The film debuted on February 9, 1929 at the Gloria–Palast in Berlin. It was released in Germany as a nine reel (10,676 feet) production with a reported running time of 131 minutes.

Upon the film&#x27;s release in Germany, Pabst was accused of making a &quot;scandalous version&quot; of Wedekind&#x27;s plays, in which the Lulu character is presented as &quot;a man-eater devouring her sexual victims.&quot; Critics in Berlin particularly dismissed the film as a &quot;travesty&quot; of its source material. The film&#x27;s presentation of the Countess as a lesbian was also controversial, and Brooks was castigated as a &quot;non-actress.&quot; According to film historians Derek Malcolm and J. Hoberman, the ire Brooks received for her performance was largely rooted in her being an American.

The film underwent significant censorship in various countries: In France, the film was significantly re-edited from its original cut, making Alwa&#x27;s secretary and the countess become Lulu&#x27;s childhood friends, eliminating the lesbian subplot between the countess and Lulu; furthermore, in the French cut, Lulu is found not guilty at her trial, and there is no Jack the Ripper character, as the film ends with Lulu joining the Salvation Army. This cut was also released in the United Kingdom. Significantly truncated cuts of the film were screened in the United States, ranging various lengths, and concluding the same as the French and British cuts, with Lulu escaping to join the Salvation Army.

As well as being censored, the film was banned in Finland (1929), Norway (1929), and Sweden (c. 1929). Despite the film also being banned in The Netherlands in 1930, it was shown in Amsterdam at the De Uitkijk theatre on October 18, 1935. With the rise of the Nazi party, the film was banned in Germany from 1933 to 1945. It was also banned in Portugal (1936–1945).

====U.S. reviews====
In the United States, the film screened in New York City beginning 1 December 1929, also in a truncated version. Film critic Irene Thirer of the &quot;New York Daily News&quot; noted that the film suffered greatly from the edits made to what &quot;must have been ultra-sophisticated silent cinema in its original form.&quot; On 8 December 1929, the widely read New York-based trade paper &quot;The Film Daily&quot; also published a review; that assessment, written by Jack Harrower, was based too on his viewing a heavily censored version of the film, a version identified to have a running time of only 66 minutes. Harrower describes what he saw as a &quot;&quot; that offers &quot;little entertainment&quot; due to the film being &quot;hacked to pieces by the censors&quot;:
&quot;Variety&quot;, the American entertainment industry&#x27;s leading publication in 1929, characterizes &quot;Pandora&#x27;s Box&quot; as incoherent or &quot;rambling&quot; in its 11 December review. That review, attributed to &quot;Waly&quot;, was based on the film&#x27;s presentation at the 55th Street Playhouse in Manhattan, which apparently screened a longer version of the motion picture than the one seen by Harrower. &quot;Variety&quot;&#x27;s critic estimated the duration of the film he saw at 85 minutes; nevertheless, he also recognized the ruinous effects of extensive cuts to the film. &quot;Management at this house [theater]&quot;, notes Waly, &quot;blames the N.Y. censor with ending everything with Pandora and boy friends joining the Salvation Army.&quot;

&quot;The New York Times&quot; reviewed the film as well in December 1929. The newspaper&#x27;s influential critic Mordaunt Hall also saw the picture at Manhattan&#x27;s 55th Street Playhouse. Hall in his review judges it to be &quot;a disconnected melodramatic effusion&quot; that is &quot;seldom interesting&quot;. He notes that Brooks is &quot;attractive&quot; and &quot;moves her head and eyes at the proper moment&quot;, but he adds that he finds her facial expressions in portraying various emotions on screen &quot;often difficult to decide&quot;. Hall then concludes his remarks by indirectly complimenting the film&#x27;s cinematography, asserting that the German production was &quot;filmed far better than the story deserves&quot;.

Despite mixed reviews, the film drew an audience to its American debut. The &quot;New York Sun&quot; reported &quot;Pandora’s Box&quot; “ . . . has smashed the Fifty-fifth Street Playhouse’s box office records. It will therefore be held for another week”. Following New York, &quot;Pandora&#x27;s Box&quot; was shown at the Little Theater in Baltimore (January 1930), Acme Theater in New York City (May 1930), Little theater in Newark, New Jersey (May 1931), and 5th Ave. Theater in New York City (December 1933). The film&#x27;s last known public showing in the United States prior to its later revival was at the Sunday playhouse at Taliesin, the Wisconsin estate of Frank Lloyd Wright, in May, 1934.

===Rediscovery and restoration===
Though it was largely dismissed by critics upon initial release, &quot;Pandora&#x27;s Box&quot; was rediscovered by film scholars in the 1950s, and began to accrue acclaim, eventually earning the reputation of being an unsung classic. It is now considered one of the classics of Weimar Germany&#x27;s cinema, along with &quot;The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari&quot;, &quot;Metropolis&quot;, &quot;The Last Laugh&quot;, and &quot;The Blue Angel&quot;. Brooks&#x27; talent as an actress, which had been criticized upon the film&#x27;s initial release (specifically by German critics), was also subject to international reappraisal and acclaim from the likes of European critics such as Lotte H. Eisner, Henri Langlois, and David Thomson.

Film critic Roger Ebert reviewed the film in 1998 with great praise, and remarked of Brooks&#x27; presence that &quot;she regards us from the screen as if the screen were not there; she casts away the artifice of film and invites us to play with her.&quot; He included the film on his list of The Great Movies. , the film has a 93% approval rating on internet review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, based on 36 reviews, with a weighted average of 8.82/10.

When a new 35mm print was shown at Film Forum in New York City in 2006, &quot;Pandora’s Box&quot; was reported to be the second highest grossing independent film in the United States.

In 2009, Hugh Hefner funded a restoration of the film. This restoration was screened at the 2012 San Francisco Silent Film Festival. In their program, the festival noted: &quot;As a heavily censored film that deals with the psychological effects of sexual repression, &quot;Pandora’s Box&quot; meets two of Hefner’s charitable objectives: artistic expression and a pristine new film, both finally unfurled after decades of frustration.&quot; In 2023, the Hefner funded restoration was released on Blu-ray by Eureka, a UK label.

Quentin Tarantino listed the movie among his 10 greatest films of all time.

===Home media===
In the United Kingdom, &quot;Pandora&#x27;s Box&quot; was released on DVD on 24 June 2002, by Second Sight Films.

In North America, &quot;Pandora&#x27;s Box&quot; was released on a two-disc DVD set on 28 November 2006, by The Criterion Collection. Four soundtracks were commissioned for the film&#x27;s DVD release: an approximation of the score cinema audiences might have heard with a live orchestra, a Weimar Republic-era cabaret score, a modern orchestral interpretation, and an improvisational piano score. On October 15, 2024, many years after this DVD edition went out of print, Criterion re-released the film in the Blu-ray format, using a new 2K scan and restoration of the film.

<text>Solid modeling (or solid modelling) is a consistent set of principles for mathematical and computer modeling of three-dimensional shapes &quot;(solids)&quot;. Solid modeling is distinguished within the broader related areas of geometric modeling and computer graphics, such as &quot;3D modeling&quot;, by its emphasis on physical fidelity. Together, the principles of geometric and solid modeling form the foundation of 3D-computer-aided design, and in general, support the creation, exchange, visualization, animation, interrogation, and annotation of digital models of physical objects.

== Overview ==

The use of solid modeling techniques allows for the automation process of several difficult engineering calculations that are carried out as a part of the design process. Simulation, planning, and verification of processes such as machining and assembly were one of the main catalysts for the development of solid modeling. More recently, the range of supported manufacturing applications has been greatly expanded to include sheet metal manufacturing, injection molding, welding, pipe routing, etc. Beyond traditional manufacturing, solid modeling techniques serve as the foundation for rapid prototyping, digital data archival and reverse engineering by reconstructing solids from sampled points on physical objects, mechanical analysis using finite elements, motion planning and NC path verification, kinematic and dynamic analysis of mechanisms, and so on. A central problem in all these applications is the ability to effectively represent and manipulate three-dimensional geometry in a fashion that is consistent with the physical behavior of real artifacts. Solid modeling research and development has effectively addressed many of these issues, and continues to be a central focus of computer-aided engineering.

== Mathematical foundations ==
The notion of solid modeling as practised today relies on the specific need for informational completeness in mechanical geometric modeling systems, in the sense that any computer model should support all geometric queries that may be asked of its corresponding physical object. The requirement implicitly recognizes the possibility of several computer representations of the same physical object as long as any two such representations are consistent. It is impossible to computationally verify informational completeness of a representation unless the notion of a physical object is defined in terms of computable mathematical properties and independent of any particular representation. Such reasoning led to the development of the modeling paradigm that has shaped the field of solid modeling as we know it today.

All manufactured components have finite size and well behaved boundaries, so initially the focus was on mathematically modeling rigid parts made of homogeneous isotropic material that could be added or removed. These postulated properties can be translated into properties of &quot;regions&quot;, subsets of three-dimensional Euclidean space. The two common approaches to define &quot;solidity&quot; rely on &quot;point-set topology&quot; and &quot;algebraic topology&quot; respectively. Both models specify how solids can be built from simple pieces or cells.

According to the continuum point-set model of solidity, all the points of any &quot;X&quot; ⊂ ℝ3 can be classified according to their &quot;neighborhoods&quot; with respect to &quot;X&quot; as &quot;interior&quot;, &quot;exterior&quot;, or &quot;boundary&quot; points. Assuming ℝ3 is endowed with the typical Euclidean metric, a neighborhood of a point &quot;p&quot; ∈&quot;X&quot; takes the form of an open ball. For &quot;X&quot; to be considered solid, every neighborhood of any &quot;p&quot; ∈&quot;X&quot; must be consistently three dimensional; points with lower-dimensional neighborhoods indicate a lack of solidity. Dimensional homogeneity of neighborhoods is guaranteed for the class of closed regular sets, defined as sets equal to the &quot;closure&quot; of their interior. Any &quot;X&quot; ⊂ ℝ3 can be turned into a closed regular set or &quot;regularized&quot; by taking the closure of its interior, and thus the modeling space of solids is mathematically defined to be the space of closed regular subsets of ℝ3 (by the Heine-Borel theorem it is implied that all solids are compact sets). In addition, solids are required to be closed under the Boolean operations of set union, intersection, and difference (to guarantee solidity after material addition and removal). Applying the standard Boolean operations to closed regular sets may not produce a closed regular set, but this problem can be solved by regularizing the result of applying the standard Boolean operations. The regularized set operations are denoted ∪∗, ∩∗, and −∗.

The combinatorial characterization of a set &quot;X&quot; ⊂ ℝ3 as a solid involves representing &quot;X&quot; as an orientable cell complex so that the cells provide finite spatial addresses for points in an otherwise innumerable continuum. The class of semi-analytic bounded subsets of Euclidean space is closed under Boolean operations (standard and regularized) and exhibits the additional property that every semi-analytic set can be stratified into a collection of disjoint cells of dimensions 0,1,2,3. A triangulation of a semi-analytic set into a collection of points, line segments, triangular faces, and tetrahedral elements is an example of a stratification that is commonly used. The combinatorial model of solidity is then summarized by saying that in addition to being semi-analytic bounded subsets, solids are three-dimensional topological polyhedra, specifically three-dimensional orientable manifolds with boundary. In particular this implies the Euler characteristic of the combinatorial boundary of the polyhedron is 2. The combinatorial manifold model of solidity also guarantees the boundary of a solid separates space into exactly two components as a consequence of the Jordan-Brouwer theorem, thus eliminating sets with non-manifold neighborhoods that are deemed impossible to manufacture.

The point-set and combinatorial models of solids are entirely consistent with each other, can be used interchangeably, relying on continuum or combinatorial properties as needed, and can be extended to &quot;n&quot; dimensions. The key property that facilitates this consistency is that the class of closed regular subsets of ℝ&quot;n&quot; coincides precisely with homogeneously &quot;n&quot;-dimensional topological polyhedra. Therefore, every &quot;n&quot;-dimensional solid may be unambiguously represented by its boundary and the boundary has the combinatorial structure of an &quot;n−1&quot;-dimensional polyhedron having homogeneously &quot;n−1&quot;-dimensional neighborhoods.

==Solid representation schemes==
Based on assumed mathematical properties, any scheme of representing solids is a method for capturing information about the class of semi-analytic subsets of Euclidean space. This means all representations are different ways of organizing the same geometric and topological data in the form of a data structure. All representation schemes are organized in terms of a finite number of operations on a set of primitives. Therefore, the modeling space of any particular representation is finite, and any single representation scheme may not completely suffice to represent all types of solids. For example, solids defined via combinations of regularized Boolean operations cannot necessarily be represented as the sweep of a primitive moving according to a space trajectory, except in very simple cases. This forces modern geometric modeling systems to maintain several representation schemes of solids and also facilitate efficient conversion between representation schemes.

Below is a list of techniques used to create or represent solid models. Modern modeling software may use a combination of these schemes to represent a solid.

=== Primitive instancing===
This scheme is based on notion of families of object, each member of a family distinguishable from the other by a few parameters. Each object family is called a &quot;generic primitive&quot;, and individual objects within a family are called &quot;primitive instances&quot;. For example, a family of bolts is a generic primitive, and a single bolt specified by a particular set of parameters is a primitive instance. The distinguishing characteristic of pure parameterized instancing schemes is the lack of means for combining instances to create new structures which represent new and more complex objects. The other main drawback of this scheme is the difficulty of writing algorithms for computing properties of represented solids. A considerable amount of family-specific information must be built into the algorithms and therefore each generic primitive must be treated as a special case, allowing no uniform overall treatment.

===Spatial occupancy enumeration===
This scheme is essentially a list of spatial &quot;cells&quot; occupied by the solid. The cells, also called voxels are cubes of a fixed size and are arranged in a fixed spatial grid (other polyhedral arrangements are also possible but cubes are the simplest). Each cell may be represented by the coordinates of a single point, such as the cell&#x27;s centroid. Usually a specific scanning order is imposed and the corresponding ordered set of coordinates is called a &quot;spatial array&quot;. Spatial arrays are unambiguous and unique solid representations but are too verbose for use as &#x27;master&#x27; or definitional representations. They can, however, represent coarse approximations of parts and can be used to improve the performance of geometric algorithms, especially when used in conjunction with other representations such as constructive solid geometry.

===Cell decomposition===
This scheme follows from the combinatoric (algebraic topological) descriptions of solids detailed above. A solid can be represented by its decomposition into several cells. Spatial occupancy enumeration schemes are a particular case of cell decompositions where all the cells are cubical and lie in a regular grid. Cell decompositions provide convenient ways for computing certain topological properties of solids such as its connectedness (number of pieces) and genus (number of holes). Cell decompositions in the form of triangulations are the representations used in 3D finite elements for the numerical solution of partial differential equations. Other cell decompositions such as a Whitney regular stratification or Morse decompositions may be used for applications in robot motion planning.

===Surface mesh modeling===
Similar to boundary representation, the surface of the object is represented. However, rather than complex data structures and NURBS, a simple surface mesh of vertices and edges is used. Surface meshes can be structured (as in triangular meshes in STL files or quad meshes with horizontal and vertical rings of quadrilaterals), or unstructured meshes with randomly grouped triangles and higher level polygons.

===Constructive solid geometry===

Constructive solid geometry (CSG) is a family of schemes for representing rigid solids as Boolean constructions or combinations of primitives via the regularized set operations discussed above. CSG and boundary representations are currently the most important representation schemes for solids. CSG representations take the form of ordered binary trees where non-terminal nodes represent either rigid transformations (orientation preserving isometries) or regularized set operations. Terminal nodes are primitive leaves that represent closed regular sets. The semantics of CSG representations is clear. Each subtree represents a set resulting from applying the indicated transformations/regularized set operations on the set represented by the primitive leaves of the subtree. CSG representations are particularly useful for capturing design intent in the form of features corresponding to material addition or removal (bosses, holes, pockets etc.). The attractive properties of CSG include conciseness, guaranteed validity of solids, computationally convenient Boolean algebraic properties, and natural control of a solid&#x27;s shape in terms of high level parameters defining the solid&#x27;s primitives and their positions and orientations. The relatively simple data structure and elegant recursive algorithms have further contributed to the popularity of CSG.

===Sweeping===
The basic notion embodied in sweeping schemes is simple. A set moving through space may trace or &quot;sweep&quot; out volume (a solid) that may be represented by the moving set and its trajectory. Such a representation is important in the context of applications such as detecting the material removed from a cutter as it moves along a specified trajectory, computing dynamic interference of two solids undergoing relative motion, motion planning, and even in computer graphics applications such as tracing the motions of a brush moved on a canvas. Most commercial CAD systems provide (limited) functionality for constructing swept solids mostly in the form of a two dimensional cross section moving on a space trajectory transversal to the section. However, current research has shown several approximations of three dimensional shapes moving across one parameter, and even multi-parameter motions.

===Implicit representation===

A very general method of defining a set of points &quot;X&quot; is to specify a predicate that can be evaluated at any point in space. In other words, &quot;X&quot; is defined &quot;implicitly&quot; to consist of all the points that satisfy the condition specified by the predicate. The simplest form of a predicate is the condition on the sign of a real valued function resulting in the familiar representation of sets by equalities and inequalities. For example, if formula_1 the conditions formula_2, formula_3, and formula_4 represent, respectively, a plane and two open linear halfspaces. More complex functional primitives may be defined by Boolean combinations of simpler predicates. Furthermore, the theory of R-functions allow conversions of such representations into a single function inequality for any closed semi analytic set. Such a representation can be converted to a boundary representation using polygonization algorithms, for example, the marching cubes algorithm.

===Parametric and feature-based modeling===
Features are defined to be parametric shapes associated with &quot;attributes&quot; such as intrinsic geometric parameters (length, width, depth etc.), position and orientation, geometric tolerances, material properties, and references to other features. Features also provide access to related production processes and resource models. Thus, features have a semantically higher level than primitive closed regular sets. Features are generally expected to form a basis for linking CAD with downstream manufacturing applications, and also for organizing databases for design data reuse. Parametric feature based modeling is frequently combined with constructive binary solid geometry (CSG) to fully describe systems of complex objects in engineering.

== History of solid modelers ==
The historical development of solid modelers has to be seen in context of the whole history of CAD, the key milestones being the development of the research system BUILD followed by its commercial spin-off Romulus which went on to influence the development of Parasolid, ACIS and Solid Modeling Solutions. One of the first CAD developers in the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), ASCON began internal development of its own solid modeler in the 1990s. In November 2012, the mathematical division of ASCON became a separate company, and was named C3D Labs. It was assigned the task of developing the C3D geometric modeling kernel as a standalone product – the only commercial 3D modeling kernel from Russia. Other contributions came from Mäntylä, with his GWB and from the GPM project which contributed, among other things, hybrid modeling techniques at the beginning of the 1980s. This is also when the Programming Language of Solid Modeling PLaSM was conceived at the University of Rome.

== Computer-aided design ==
The modeling of solids is only the minimum requirement of a CAD system&#x27;s capabilities. Solid modelers have become commonplace in engineering departments in the last ten years due to faster computers and competitive software pricing. Solid modeling software creates a virtual 3D representation of components for machine design and analysis. A typical graphical user interface includes programmable macros, keyboard shortcuts and dynamic model manipulation. The ability to dynamically re-orient the model, in real-time shaded 3-D, is emphasized and helps the designer maintain a mental 3-D image.

A solid part model generally consists of a group of features, added one at a time, until the model is complete. Engineering solid models are built mostly with sketcher-based features; 2-D sketches that are swept along a path to become 3-D. These may be cuts, or extrusions for example. Design work on components is usually done within the context of the whole product using assembly modeling methods. An assembly model incorporates references to individual part models that comprise the product.

Another type of modeling technique is &#x27;surfacing&#x27; (Freeform surface modeling). Here, surfaces are defined, trimmed and merged, and filled to make solid. The surfaces are usually defined with datum curves in space and a variety of complex commands. Surfacing is more difficult, but better applicable to some manufacturing techniques, like injection molding. Solid models for injection molded parts usually have both surfacing and sketcher based features.

Engineering drawings can be created semi-automatically and reference the solid models.

===Parametric modeling===
Parametric modeling uses parameters to define a model (dimensions, for example). Examples of parameters are: dimensions used to create model features, material density, formulas to describe swept features, imported data (that describe a reference surface, for example). The parameter may be modified later, and the model will update to reflect the modification. Typically, there is a relationship between parts, assemblies, and drawings. A part consists of multiple features, and an assembly consists of multiple parts. Drawings can be made from either parts or assemblies.

Example: A shaft is created by extruding a circle 100 mm. A hub is assembled to the end of the shaft. Later, the shaft is modified to be 200 mm long (click on the shaft, select the length dimension, modify to 200). When the model is updated the shaft will be 200 mm long, the hub will relocate to the end of the shaft to which it was assembled, and the engineering drawings and mass properties will reflect all changes automatically.

Related to parameters, but slightly different, are constraints. Constraints are relationships between entities that make up a particular shape. For a window, the sides might be defined as being parallel, and of the same length. Parametric modeling is obvious and intuitive. But for the first three decades of CAD this was not the case. Modification meant re-draw, or add a new cut or protrusion on top of old ones. Dimensions on engineering drawings were &quot;created&quot;, instead of &quot;shown&quot;. Parametric modeling is very powerful, but requires more skill in model creation. A complicated model for an injection molded part may have a thousand features, and modifying an early feature may cause later features to fail. Skillfully created parametric models are easier to maintain and modify. Parametric modeling also lends itself to data re-use. A whole family of capscrews can be contained in one model, for example.

=== Medical solid modeling ===

Modern computed axial tomography and magnetic resonance imaging scanners can be used to create solid models of internal body features called voxel-based models, with images generated using volume rendering. Optical 3D scanners can be used to create point clouds or polygon mesh models of external body features.

Uses of medical solid modeling;
* Visualization
* Visualization of specific body tissues (just blood vessels and tumor, for example)
* Designing prosthetics, orthotics, and other medical and dental devices (this is sometimes called mass customization)
* Creating polygon mesh models for rapid prototyping (to aid surgeons preparing for difficult surgeries, for example)
* Combining polygon mesh models with CAD solid modeling (design of hip replacement parts, for example)
* Computational analysis of complex biological processes, e.g. air flow, blood flow
* Computational simulation of new medical devices and implants &quot;in vivo&quot;

If the use goes beyond visualization of the scan data, processes like image segmentation and image-based meshing will be necessary to generate an accurate and realistic geometrical description of the scan data.

===Engineering===

Because CAD programs running on computers &quot;understand&quot; the true geometry comprising complex shapes, many attributes of/for a 3D solid, such as its center of gravity, volume, and mass, can be quickly calculated. For instance, the cube with rounded edges shown at the top of this article measures 8.4 mm from flat to flat. Despite its many radii and the shallow pyramid on each of its six faces, its properties are readily calculated for the designer, as shown in the screenshot at right.

<text>The Phi Phi Islands (, , ) are an island group in Thailand between the large island of Phuket and the Straits of Malacca coast of Thailand. The islands are administratively part of Krabi Province. Ko Phi Phi Don (, ) (&quot;ko&quot; &#x27;island&#x27;) is the largest and most populated island of the group, although the beaches of the second largest island, Ko Phi Phi Le (, ) are visited by many people as well. The rest of the islands in the group, including Bida Nok, Bida Nai, and Ko Mai Phai, are not much more than large limestone rocks jutting out of the sea. The islands are reachable by ferries, speedboats or long-tail boats, most often from Krabi town or from ports in Phuket Province.

Phi Phi Don was initially populated by Thai Malay fishermen during the late-1940s, and later became a coconut plantation. The resident Thai population of Phi Phi Don remains more than 80 percent Muslim. The current population however—if counting transient workers—is more Buddhist than Muslim. The resident population is between 2,000 and 3,000 people (2018).

The islands came to worldwide prominence when Ko Phi Phi Le was used as a location for the 2000 British-American film &quot;The Beach&quot;. This attracted criticism, with claims that the film company had damaged the island&#x27;s environment—the producers supposedly bulldozed beach areas and planted palm trees to make it better resemble descriptions in the book, an accusation the filmmakers contest. An increase in tourism was attributed to the film&#x27;s release, which resulted in increased environmental degradation. Phi Phi Le is home to the &quot;Viking Cave&quot;, where there is a thriving industry harvesting edible bird&#x27;s nests.

Ko Phi Phi was devastated by the Indian Ocean tsunami of December 2004, when nearly all of the island&#x27;s infrastructure was destroyed.

== History ==

The name &quot;Phi Phi&quot; (pronounced &quot;phi-phi&quot;) originates from Malay. The original name for the islands was &quot;Pulau Api-Api&quot; (&#x27;the fiery isle&#x27;). The name refers to the &quot;Pokok Api-Api&quot;, or &quot;fiery tree&quot; (grey mangrove) which is found on the islands.

== Geography ==
There are six islands in the group known as Phi Phi. They lie southeast of Phuket and are part of Hat Noppharat Thara–Mu Ko Phi Phi National Park. The national park covers an area of . which is home to an abundance of corals and marine life. There are limestone mountains with cliffs, caves, and long white sandy beaches.

Phi Phi Don and Phi Phi Le are the largest and best-known islands. Phi Phi Don is : in length and wide. Phi Phi Le is . In total, the islands occupy .

== Administration ==

There are two administrative villages on Ko Phi Phi under the administration of the Ao Nang sub-district, Mueang Krabi District, Krabi Province. There are nine settlements under these two villages.

The villages are:
*Laem Thong (บ้านแหลมตง, Mu 8, between 300 and 500 people)
:* Ban Ko Mai Phai 
:* Ban Laem Tong
:* Ao Loh Bakhao
:* Ao Lana

*Ko Phi Phi (บ้านเกาะพีพี, Mu 7, between 1,500 - 2,000 people)
:* Ao Maya (about 10 people, mostly in the ranger station)
:* Ton Sai, the capital and largest settlement
:* Hat Yao
:* Ao Lodalum
:* Laem Pho

== Climate ==
Hat Noppharat Thara–Mu Ko Phi Phi National Park is influenced by tropical monsoon winds. There are two seasons: the rainy season from May till December and the hot season from January till April. Average temperature ranges between . Average rainfall per year is about , with wettest month being July and the driest February.

== Transportation and communication ==
===Roads===
Since the re-building of Ko Phi Phi after the 2004 tsunami, paved roads now cover the vast majority of Ton Sai Bay and Loh Dalum Bay. All roads are for pedestrian use only with push carts used to transport goods and bags. The only permitted motor vehicles are reserved for emergency services. Bicycling is the most popular form of transport in Ton Sai.

===Air===
The nearest airport is Krabi which is in the same province as the Phi Phi Islands. Phuket and Trang airports are also nearby. Phuket has a direct connection by road and boat. There is a road and boat connection from Trang to Phi Phi via Koh Lanta but services only operate between November and March.
===Ferry===
There are frequent ferry boats to Ko Phi Phi from Phuket, Ko Lanta, and Krabi town starting at 08:30. Last boats from Krabi and Phuket depart at 14:30. In the &quot;green season&quot; (Jun-Oct), travel to and from Ko Lanta is via Krabi town only.

There is a large modern deep water government pier on Tonsai Bay, Phi Phi Don Village, completed in late-2009. It takes in the main ferry boats from Phuket, Krabi, and Ko Lanta. Visitors to Phi Phi Island must pay 20 baht on arrival at the pier. Dive boats, longtail boats, and supply boats have their own drop off points along the piers, making the pier highly efficient in the peak season.

== Tourism ==

The islands feature beaches and clear water, and the natural environment is protected by national park status. At the beginning of the year 1992, the government began imposing a 5 baht fee on each visitor to the islands, in order to pay the laborers who collect and burn refuse and who also help &quot;to provide waterway transportation and security for tourists&quot;. Since the release of the movie &quot;The Beach&quot; in 2000, which was partly filmed on Ko Phi Phi Le, tourism to the islands has exploded.

Phi Phi Le&#x27;s Maya Bay was closed to tourists from June 2018 until the ecosystem recovers, but at least a year.

=== Attraction sites ===
Some of the top attraction sites in Phi Phi Island include:

* Monkey Beach 
* Maya Bay 
* Mosquito Island
* Koh Phi Phi Leh
* Viking Cave
* Laem Tong Beach

== Medical ==
There is a small government hospital on Phi Phi Island, for emergencies. Its primary purpose is to stabilize emergencies and evacuate to a Krabi hospital by sea. It is between the Phi Phi Cabana Hotel and the Ton Sai Towers, about a 5–7 minute walk from the main pier. There are two Private Hospitals, The World Med Center is on Tonsai Bay, and a second smaller branch is near Loh Dalum Beach.

==2004 tsunami==
On 26 December 2004, much of the inhabited part of Phi Phi Don was devastated by the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami. The island&#x27;s main village, Ton Sai (Banyan Tree, ), is built on a sandy isthmus between the island&#x27;s two long, tall limestone ridges. On both sides of Ton Sai are semicircular bays lined with beaches. The isthmus rises less than above sea level.

Shortly after 10:00 on 26 December, the water from both bays receded. When the tsunami hit, at 10:37, it did so from both bays, and met in the middle of the isthmus. The wave that came into Ton Sai Bay was high. The wave that came into Loh Dalum Bay was high. The force of the larger wave from Loh Dalum Bay pushed the tsunami and also breached low-lying areas in the limestone karsts, passing from Laa Naa Bay to Bakhao Bay, and at Laem Thong (Sea Gypsy Village), where 11 people died. Apart from these breaches, the east side of the island experienced only flooding and strong currents. A tsunami memorial was built to honor the deceased but has since been removed for the building of a new hotel in 2015.

At the time of the tsunami, the island had an estimated 10,000 occupants, including tourists.

==Post-tsunami reconstruction==

After the tsunami, approximately 70% of the buildings on the island had been destroyed. By the end of July 2005, an estimated 850 bodies had been recovered, and an estimated 1,200 people were still missing. The total number of fatalities is unlikely to be known. Local tour guides cite the figure 4,000. Of Phi Phi Don residents, 104 surviving children had lost one or both parents.

In the immediate aftermath of the disaster, the permanent residents were housed in a refugee camp at Nong Kok in Krabi Province.

On 6 January 2005, a former Dutch resident of Phi Phi, Emiel Kok, set up a voluntary organization, &quot;Help International Phi Phi&quot; (&quot;HI Phi Phi&quot;). HI Phi Phi recruited 68 Thai staff from the refugee camp, as well as transient backpacker volunteers (of whom more than 3,500 offered their assistance), and returned to the island to undertake clearing and rebuilding work. On 18 February 2005, a second organization, Phi Phi Dive Camp, was set up to remove the debris from the bays and coral reef, most of which was in Ton Sai Bay.

By the end of July 2005, 23,000 tonnes of debris had been removed from the island, of which 7,000 tonnes had been cleared by hand. &quot;We try and do as much as possible by hand,&quot; said Kok, &quot;that way we can search for passports and identification.&quot; The majority of buildings that were deemed fit for repair by government surveyors had been repaired, and 300 businesses had been restored. HI Phi Phi was nominated for a &quot;Time Magazine&quot; Heroes of Asia award.

As of 6 December 2005, nearly 1,500 hotel rooms were open, and a tsunami early-warning alarm system had been installed by the Thai government with the help of volunteers.

==Impact of mass tourism==

Since the tsunami, Phi Phi has come under greater threat from mass tourism. Dr Thon Thamrongnawasawat, an environmental activist and member of Thailand&#x27;s National Reform Council, is campaigning to have Phi Phi tourist numbers capped before its natural beauty is completely destroyed. With southern Thailand attracting thousands more tourists every day, Dr Thon makes the point that the ecosystem is under threat and is fast disappearing. &quot;Economically, a few people may be enriched, but their selfishness will come at great cost to Thailand&quot;, says Dr Thon, a marine biology lecturer at Kasetsart University and an established environmental writer.

More than one thousand tourists arrive on Phi Phi daily. This figure does not include those who arrive by chartered speedboat or yacht. Phi Phi produces about of solid waste a day, rising to during the high season and most of this waste leaves Phi Phi island into the ocean - untreated; in fact, Phi Phi Island releases 83% wastewater untreated. All tourists arriving on the island pay a 20-baht fee at Ton Sai Pier to assist in &quot;keeping Ko Phi Phi clean&quot;. &quot;We collect up to 20,000 baht a day from tourists at the pier. The money is then used to pay a private company to haul the rubbish from the island to the mainland in Krabi to be disposed of&quot;, Mr Pankum Kittithonkun, Ao Nang Administration Organization (&quot;OrBorTor&quot;) President, said. The boat takes about 25 tonnes of trash from the island daily, weather permitting. &quot;Ao Nang OrBorTor&quot; pays 600,000 baht per month for the service. During high season, an Ao Nang &quot;OrBorTor&quot; boat is used to help transport the overflow of rubbish. Further aggravating Phi Phi&#x27;s waste issues is sewage. &quot;We have no wastewater management plant there. Our only hope is that hotels, restaurants and other businesses act responsibly – but I have no faith in them,&quot; Mr Pankum said. &quot;They of course have to treat their own wastewater before releasing it into the sea, but they very well could just be turning the devices on before officers arrive to check them.&quot; The fundamental issue is that the budget allocated for Ao Nang and Phi Phi is based on its registered population, not on the number of people it hosts every year, Mr Pankum said.

In June 2018, Maya Beach, made famous by Leonardo DiCaprio&#x27;s 2000 film &quot;The Beach&quot;, was closed indefinitely to allow it to recover. The beach used to receive up to 5,000 tourists and 200 boats a day. It reopened January 1, 2022.

<text>Kameradschaft (, known in France as La Tragédie de la mine) is a 1931 dramatic film directed by Austrian director G. W. Pabst. The French-German co-production drama is noted for combining expressionism and realism.

The film concerns a mine disaster where German miners rescue French miners from an underground fire and explosion. The story takes place in the Lorraine–Saar regions, along the border between France and Germany. It is based on one of the worst industrial accidents in history, the Courrières mine disaster in 1906 in Courrières, France, where rescue efforts after a coal dust explosion were hampered by the lack of trained mine rescuers. Expert teams from Paris and miners from the Westphalia region of Germany came to the assistance of the French miners. There were 1,099 fatalities, including children.

&quot;Kameradschaft&quot; in German means a bond between soldiers or those who have similar opinions and are in friendship. The word is similar to , or .

==Plot==
Two boys, one French and the other German, are playing marbles near the border. When the game is over, both boys claim to have won, and complain that the other is trying to steal their marbles. Their fathers, border guards, come and separate the boys.

In 1919, at the end of World War I the border changes, and an underground mine is divided, with a gate dividing the two sections. An economic downturn and rising unemployment adds to tension, as German workers seek employment in France but are turned away, since there are hardly enough jobs for French workers. In the French part of the mine fires break out, which they try to contain by building brick walls, with the bricklayers wearing breathing apparatus. The Germans continue to work in their section, but start to feel the heat from the French fires.

Three German miners visit a French dance hall and one almost provokes a fight when Francoise, a young French woman, refuses to dance with him. The rejected miner thinks it is because he&#x27;s German, but it is actually because she is tired. She and her boyfriend, Emile, a miner, leave, and she expresses her distress over the stories about fires and explosions in the mine. The next morning, he stops in to say goodbye to her before she leaves for Paris, then he and her brother, Jean, another miner, leave for work.

The fire gets out of control, igniting gas and causing roof collapses that traps many French miners. In response, the German miner, Wittkopp, appeals successfully to his bosses to send a rescue team. As the German rescue team leave in two lorries, its leader explains to his wife that the French are men with women and children and he would hope that they would come to his aid in similar circumstances. In the mine itself, a trio of German miners breaks through the grille on the border between the two countries. On the French side, an old retired miner sneaks into the shaft hoping to rescue his young grandson. The Germans rescue the French miners, not without difficulties. After all the survivors are rescued, there is a big party with speeches about friendship between the French and Germans. French and German officials then reinstall the underground border grille and things return to the way they were before.

Although the scenes which take place inside the mine look extremely real, they were, in fact, sets designed by Erno Metzner and Karl Vollbrecht, who were meticulous about their authenticity and detail.

As with his previous film, &quot;Westfront 1918&quot;, his first talkie, Pabst did not utilize the soundproof booths which Hollywood studios used to mask the sound of the camera from the microphone, instead employing a sound proof case called a &quot;blimp&quot;, which gave the freedom to move the camera around.

==Critical response==
Film critic Daniel Curran calls the film &quot;A heartfelt plea for peace and internationalism.&quot; While calling the narrative over-sentimental, Curran wrote, &quot;Pabst&#x27;s plea for a peaceful future is both noble and honest, his direction of the heartbreak and devastation [is] enhanced by the brilliant cinematography by Fritz Arno Wagner and Robert Baberske, and the frighteningly real set design by Erno Metzner and Karl Vollbrecht.&quot;

When the film was released in the United States in 1932, Mordaunt Hall, film critic for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, praised the realism and the screenplay, writing &quot;[&quot;Kameradschaft&quot; is] one of the finest examples of realism that has come to the screen ... [the] scenes in the mine are so real that one never thinks of them as being staged ... [and] [t]hroughout the length of this tale of horror one feels as though one were permitted through some uncanny force to look into all parts of the mine ...All the noises and sounds are wonderfully natural.&quot;

&quot;Variety&quot; also gave the film a positive review, praising the direction, story, and cinematography, writing that &quot;Pabst has made [the film] a powerful recounting and accentuates more the happenings than the men ... Photography and architecture are excellent and the sound is clear. Picture is sometimes abrupt and there are some superfluous scenes but this is an outstanding film.&quot;

In a retrospective review, American film critic Pauline Kael commented, &quot;In the early 30s it was still possible for large audiences to believe in the symbolic revolutionary meaning of smashing through artificial frontiers for the sake of natural brotherhood. This movie belongs to a genre that has disappeared.&quot;

==Accolades==
&quot;Kameradschaft&quot; was named by the National Board of Review as the Best Foreign Film of 1932.

<doc id="457601" wikidata="Q2264864" url="?curid=457601" title="Salmonella enterica">
<text>Salmonella enterica (formerly Salmonella choleraesuis) is a rod-shaped, flagellate, facultative anaerobic, Gram-negative bacterium and a species of the genus &quot;Salmonella&quot;. It is divided into six subspecies, arizonae (IIIa), diarizonae (IIIb), houtenae (IV), salamae (II), indica (VI), and enterica (I). A number of its serovars are serious human pathogens; many of them are (more specifically) serovars of &quot;Salmonella enterica&quot; subsp. &quot;enterica&quot;.

== Epidemiology ==
Most cases of salmonellosis are caused by food infected with &quot;S. enterica&quot;, which often infects cattle and poultry, though other animals such as domestic cats and hamsters have also been shown to be sources of infection in humans. It primarily resides in the intestinal tract of animals and humans and can be found in feedstuff, soil, bedding, litter, and fecal matter.

The primary reservoir for the pathogen is poultry and 70% of human cases are attributed to the consumption of contaminated eggs, chicken, or turkey. Raw chicken eggs and goose eggs can harbor &quot;S. enterica&quot;, initially in the egg whites, although most eggs are not infected. As the egg ages at room temperature, the yolk membrane begins to break down and &quot;S. enterica&quot; can spread into the yolk. Refrigeration and freezing do not kill all the bacteria, but substantially slow or halt their growth. Pasteurizing and food irradiation are used to kill &quot;Salmonella&quot; for commercially produced foodstuffs containing raw eggs such as ice cream. Foods prepared in the home from raw eggs, such as mayonnaise, cakes, and cookies, can spread salmonellae if not properly cooked before consumption. Salmonella is the leading foodborne pathogen in the United States, causing the most deaths and having the highest cost burden. It is a resilient microorganism capable of surviving long periods of time in hot and dry environments, increasing its effectiveness as a pathogen and making it able to survive the harsh environments of the gastrointestinal tract and farms. 

&quot;S. enterica&quot; genomes have been reconstructed from up to 6,500 year old human remains across Western Eurasia, which provides evidence for geographic widespread infections with systemic &quot;S. enterica&quot; during prehistory, and a possible role of the Neolithization process in the evolution of host adaptation. Additional reconstructed genomes from colonial Mexico suggest &quot;S. enterica&quot; as the cause of &quot;cocoliztli&quot;, an epidemic in 16th-century New Spain. In 1545, this outbreak of &quot;S. enterica&quot; spread explosively across what is now Mexico. Over the next century, the disease killed up to 90% of the Indigenous population.

Children under the age of five years, the elderly, and immunosuppressed adults are at an increased risk of systemic dissemination of the disease and need specialized treatment to combat the disease. Drinking extra fluids and antibiotics such as fluoroquinolones are typical treatments. Complications of the disease often appear as anemia or septicaemia, and the mortality rate is 15% once these symptoms arise.

The serogroup &quot;S.&quot; Typhi is the cause of typhoid fever.

== Nomenclature ==
&quot;S. enterica&quot; has six subspecies, and each subspecies has associated serovars that differ by antigenic specificity. &quot;S. enterica&quot; has over 2500 serovars. &quot;Salmonella bongori&quot; was previously considered a subspecies of &quot;S. enterica&quot;, but it is now the other species in the genus &quot;Salmonella&quot;. Most of the human pathogenic &quot;Salmonella&quot; serovars belong to the &quot;enterica&quot; subspecies. These serogroups include &quot;S.&quot; Typhi, &quot;S.&quot; Enteritidis, &quot;S.&quot; Paratyphi, &quot;S.&quot; Typhimurium, and &quot;S.&quot; Choleraesuis. The serovars can be designated as written in the previous sentence (capitalized and nonitalicized following the genus), or as follows: &quot;&quot;S. enterica&quot; subsp. &quot;enterica&quot;, serovar Typhi&quot;.

Subspecies &quot;S. e.&quot; &quot;arizonae&quot;, named after the state of Arizona, is most commonly found in cold-blooded animals (especially snakes), but can also infect turkey, sheep, and humans. It is endemic in southwestern United States. The similar &quot;S. e.&quot; subsp. &quot;diarizonae&quot; also infects snakes and occasionally humans.

== Pathogenesis ==
Secreted proteins are of major importance for the pathogenesis of infectious diseases caused by &quot;S. enterica&quot;. A remarkably large number of fimbrial and nonfimbrial adhesins are present in &quot;Salmonella&quot;, and mediate biofilm formation and contact to host cells. Secreted proteins are also involved in host-cell invasion and intracellular proliferation, two hallmarks of &quot;Salmonella&quot; pathogenesis.

==DNA repair capability==

Exposure of &quot;S. enterica&quot; to bile salts, such as sodium deoxycholate, induces the SOS DNA damage response indicating that in this organism bile salts cause DNA damage. Bile salt exposure is found to increase GC to AT transition mutations and also to induce genes of the OxyR and SoxRS regulons suggesting further that bile salts specifically cause oxidative DNA damage. Mutants of &quot;S. enterica&quot; that are defective in enzymes required for the process of base excision repair are sensitive to bile salts. This indicates that wild-type &quot;S. enterica&quot; uses base excision repair to remove DNA damages caused by the bile salts. The RecBCD enzyme which functions in recombinational repair of DNA is also required for bile salt resistance.

== Small noncoding RNA ==
Small nonprotein-coding RNAs (sRNA) are able to perform specific functions without being translated into proteins; 97 bacterial sRNAs from &quot;Salmonella&quot; Typhi were discovered.

AsdA (antisense RNA of dnaA) is a &quot;cis-&quot;encoded antisense RNA of &quot;dnaA&quot; described in &quot;S. enterica&quot; serovar Typhi. It was discovered by deep sequencing and its transcription was confirmed by Northern blot and RACE analysis. AsdA is estimated to be about 540 nucleotides long, and represents the complementary strand to that encoding DnaA, a protein that plays a central role in the initiation of DNA replication and hence cellular division. In rich media, it is highly expressed only after reaching the stationary growth phase, but under limiting iron or osmotic stress, it is already expressed during exponential growth. Overexpression of AsdA stabilizes dnaA mRNA, increasing its levels and thereby enhancing its rate of translation. This suggests that AsdA is a regulator of DNA replication.

<doc id="457602" wikidata="Q6067745" url="?curid=457602" title="Iraq Intelligence Commission">
<text>The Commission on the Intelligence Capabilities of the United States Regarding Weapons of Mass Destruction is a panel created by , signed by U.S. President George W. Bush in February 2004. 

The impetus for the Commission lay with a public controversy occasioned by statements, including those of Chief of the Iraq Survey Group, David Kay, that the Intelligence Community had grossly erred in judging that Iraq had been developing weapons of mass destruction (WMD) before the March 2003 start of Operation Iraqi Freedom. President Bush therefore formed the Commission, but gave it a broad mandate not only to look into any errors behind the Iraq intelligence, but also to look into intelligence on WMD programs in Afghanistan and Libya, as well as to examine the capabilities of the Intelligence Community to address the problem of WMD proliferation and &quot;related threats.&quot; However, the commission was not directed to examine the extent to which the Bush administration may have manipulated the intelligence.
Following intense study of the American Intelligence Community, the Commission delivered its report to the President on March 31, 2005, the so-called Robb-Silberman Report.

==Findings==
Regarding Iraq, the Commission concluded that the United States Intelligence Community was wrong in almost all of its pre-war judgments about Iraq&#x27;s alleged weapons of mass destruction and that this constituted a major intelligence failure.

The Commission&#x27;s report also described systemic analytical, collection, and dissemination flaws that led the intelligence community to erroneous assessments about Iraq&#x27;s alleged WMD programs. Chief among these flaws were &quot;an analytical process that was driven by assumptions and inferences rather than data&quot;, failures by certain agencies to gather all relevant information and analyze fully information on purported centrifuge tubes, insufficient vetting of key sources, particularly the source &quot;Curveball,&quot; and somewhat overheated presentation of data to policymakers.

The 601-page document detailed many U.S. intelligence failures and identified intelligence breakdowns in dozens of cases. Some of the conclusions reached by the report were:

*the report notes in several places that the commission&#x27;s mandate did not allow it &quot;to investigate how policymakers used the intelligence they received from the Intelligence Community on Iraq&#x27;s weapons programs,&quot;
*One of the main and crucial intelligence sources for the case in Iraq was an informant named Curveball. Curveball had never been interviewed by American intelligence until after the war and was instead handled exclusively by German intelligence agents, who regarded his statements as unconvincing. An October 2002 National Intelligence Estimate that concluded Iraq &quot;has&quot; biological weapons was &quot;based almost exclusively on information obtained&quot; from Curveball, according to the report.
*Information about aluminum tubes to be used as centrifuges in a nuclear weapons program were found by the commission to be used for conventional rockets.
*The Niger Yellowcake scandal was due to American intelligence believing &quot;transparently forged documents&quot; purporting to show a contract between the countries. There were &quot;flaws in the letterhead, forged signatures, misspelled words, incorrect titles for individuals and government entities&quot;.
*While there were many reports that Curveball was actually the cousin of one of Ahmed Chalabi&#x27;s top aides, the Commission, while discovering that at least two INC defectors were fabricators, said it was &quot;unable to uncover any evidence that the INC [Iraqi National Congress] or any other organization was directing Curveball.&quot;

== Recommendations ==
The report also looked forward, recommending a large number of organizational and structural reforms. Of the 74 recommendations to the President, he fully accepted 69 in a public statement released on June 29, 2005.

The Commission&#x27;s mission is, in part, &quot;to ensure the most effective counter-proliferation capabilities of the United States and response to the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks and the ongoing threat of terrorist activity.&quot; With regard to Iraq, the commission was meant to &quot;specifically examine the Intelligence Community&#x27;s intelligence prior to the initiation of Operation Iraqi Freedom and compare it with the findings of the Iraq Survey Group and other relevant agencies or organizations concerning the capabilities, intentions, and activities of Iraq relating to the design, development, manufacture, acquisition, possession, proliferation, transfer, testing, potential or threatened use, or use of Weapons of Mass Destruction and related means of delivery.&quot;

==Commission members==

Commission members are:

* Laurence Silberman, Republican, retired U.S. Court of Appeals judge, Deputy Attorney General under Presidents Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford, Ambassador to Yugoslavia, et al., co-Chairman
* Charles Robb, Democrat, former U.S. Senator from and Governor of Virginia, co-Chairman
* John McCain, Republican, U.S. Senator from Arizona
* Lloyd Cutler, Democrat, former White House counsel to Presidents Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton. Cutler changed status to &quot;Of Counsel&quot; shortly after the Commission formed.
* Patricia Wald, Democrat, retired judge of the DC Court of Appeals.
* Rick Levin, then-President of Yale University.
* Retired Admiral Bill Studeman, former Deputy Director of the CIA and Director of the NSA.
* Charles M. Vest, former President of MIT
* Henry S. Rowen, former Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs, Chairman of the National Intelligence Council, and President of RAND.

The first seven members of the panel were appointed on February 6, 2004, the date of the executive order which created it. The final two members, Vest and Rowen, were appointed on February 13. Vice Admiral John Scott Redd served as the Executive Director for the Commission on the Intelligence Capabilities of the United States Regarding Weapons of Mass Destruction sometimes called the Iraq Intelligence Commission. He also served as the first Director of the National Counterterrorism Center under President George W. Bush and founded and served as the first Commander of the United States Navy Fifth Fleet (COMFIFTHFLT).

Days before the American commission was announced, the government of the United Kingdom, the U.S.&#x27;s primary ally during the Iraq War, announced a similar commission to investigate British intelligence, known as the Butler Inquiry or the Butler Review.

The commission was independent and separate from the 9-11 Commission.

<doc id="457608" wikidata="Q4775956" url="?curid=457608" title="Anton Piller order">
<text>In English and English-derived legal systems, an Anton Piller order (frequently misspelled &quot;Anton Pillar order&quot;) is a court order that provides the right to search premises and seize evidence without prior warning. This is intended to prevent the destruction of relevant evidence, particularly in cases of alleged trademark, copyright or patent infringements.

==Overview==
The order is named after the 1975 English case of &quot;Anton Piller KG v Manufacturing Processes Limited&quot;, dealing with the theft of trade secrets, although the first reported such order was granted by Templeman J earlier that year. They are now formally known as search orders in England and Wales, New Zealand, Australia, and India.

In &quot;Anton Piller&quot;, Lord Denning described the nature of the relief:
Because such an order does not give the accused party the ability to defend themselves, Anton Piller orders are only issued exceptionally and according to the three-step test set out by Ormrod LJ in &quot;Anton Piller&quot;:
# There is an extremely strong &quot;prima facie&quot; case against the respondent.
# The damage, potential or actual, must be very serious for the applicant.
# There must be clear evidence that the respondents have in their possession relevant documents or things and that there is a real possibility that they may destroy such material before an &quot;inter partes&quot; application can be made.

In England, it has been reported that approximately 500 Anton Piller orders were granted per year between 1975 and 1980. During the 1990s, this rate had dropped tenfold. Although the name persists in normal usage, the common law application of this order has been largely superseded by a statutory search order under the Civil Procedure Act 1997. A search order under this act &quot;does not affect any right of a person to refuse to do anything on the ground that to do so might tend to expose him or his spouse to proceedings for an offence or for the recovery of a penalty&quot;.

Hugh Laddie is generally credited with the &quot;invention&quot; of the Anton Piller order. An obituary in &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; stated that he later described the Anton Piller order &quot;as a Frankenstein&#x27;s monster that went far beyond his original design brief&quot;.

In some jurisdictions (for example, Hong Kong and South Africa) where there is no statutory search order, the Anton Piller order is still often used. In South Africa, for example, in &quot;Mathias International Ltd v Baillache&quot;, the applicants instituted motion proceedings in which they claimed (i) an Anton Piller order and (ii) interdictory relief directed at prohibiting unlawful competition by the first and second respondents using the applicants&#x27; &quot;confidential information&quot;.

In &quot;Lock International plc v Beswick&quot;, Anton Piller orders were described as &quot;intrusive&quot;.

== Outside England ==
Anton Piller orders also constitute a common &quot;ex parte&quot; procedure in intellectual property related cases in some other countries, such as Canada, France, and Italy.

===France and Belgium===
Anton Piller orders are known in France and Belgium as &quot;saisie-contrefaçon&quot; (literally, &quot;infringement seizure&quot;) ordersin Belgium also as &quot;saisie-description&quot; (literally, &quot;descriptive seizure&quot;) orders. The court order may only allow the description of the alleged counterfeited goods and processes, with the aim of obtaining evidence of infringement, or may additionally allow real seizure to take place in addition to the description measures. Such a seizure is enforced by a bailiff, usually accompanied by at least one expert. It can take place on the premises of the alleged infringer, but also at a trade fair for instance. Art. L. 615-5. of the French Intellectual Property Code reads as follows (excerpt only):


===European Union===
Similar provisions are now required in the rest of Europe, under Article 7 of the European Union Directive on the enforcement of intellectual property rights, approved in April 2004.

===Australia===
Anton Piller orders are also used in Australia and are available on grounds similar to that of England. Each superior court jurisdiction provides rules and forms for the manner in which Anton Piller orders are available.

In technical modern terminology, Anton Piller orders are referred to as &quot;search orders&quot;, but &quot;Anton Piller order&quot; remains dominant in everyday use, including in universities.

Of great importance is the onus upon an applicant to establish proper grounds for obtaining such an order. This is due to the largely &quot;ex parte&quot; nature of the application. As such, an applicant must demonstrate not only that it has reasonable grounds for success in its case but must put the likely counter arguments of a respondent if that respondent were present to oppose the order being granted. This is a heavy burden faced by an applicant: its avoidance is not taken lightly by the courts and can result in penalties for its breach (see &quot;Columbia Picture Industries v Robinson&quot; [1987] Ch 38).

Also of great importance is the likely effect of a search upon occupants of the premises, given in particular that the intrusion would otherwise be a trespass: &quot;Adani Mining Pty Ltd v Pennings&quot; (2020).

===Canada===

====Common-law jurisdictions====
The Supreme Court of Canada, in &quot;Celanese Canada Inc. v. Murray Demolition Corp.&quot; established guidelines for Anton Piller orders. The orders are meant to protect evidence from being destroyed, not to gain litigious advantage, and should only be issued if: 
* The plaintiff has demonstrated a strong &quot;prima facie&quot; case.
* The damage to the plaintiff of the respondent&#x27;s alleged misconduct, potential or actual, must be very serious. 
* There must be convincing evidence that the defendant has in its possession incriminating documents or things.
* It must be shown that there is a real possibility that the defendant may destroy such material before the discovery process can do its work.

The Court laid out basic protection for the rights of parties involved. The protections in place are meant to protect solicitor-client privilege by preventing privileged documents from being disclosed. The search must be conducted according to the following guidelines:
* During normal business hours.
* Defendant or responsible employee of the defendant should be present.
* The persons who may conduct the search should be specified and limited in number.
* A copy of the claim should be served on the defendant.
* The defendants have a right to contact their lawyer within a reasonable amount of time.
* A detailed list of evidence should be made.
* Where possible, documents seized should be placed in custody of the supervising lawyer and defence should have the opportunity to review them. 
* Contested evidence should be kept in the supervising lawyer&#x27;s custody.

The supervising lawyer, referred to as an independent supervising solicitor (ISS), should:
# act as a neutral officer of the court,
# explain the court&#x27;s order to the defendant,
# supervise the search for and seizure of evidence from the defendant,
# objectively report to the Court,
# aid the Court and counsel for all parties in technical matters.

In addition, following the search:
* The order should make clear the responsibilities of the supervising solicitor continue beyond the search itself.
* The supervising solicitor should file a report of the search within a time limit describing the execution including who was present and what was seized.
* The plaintiff may be required to file and serve a motion for review within a set time in case the defendant does not request such a review.

If counsel gains access to privileged documents as a result of an Anton Piller order, the court must ensure precautionary steps are taken to prevent any potential prejudice – including removal of counsel if no alternative is available.

====Quebec (civil law jurisdiction)====
The Quebec Court of Appeal has recognized Anton Piller orders as being valid in that province under its civil law.

=== Ireland ===
Anton Piller orders have been granted by the High Court in &quot;William A. Grogan (copyright owner of RAMDIS) v. Monaghan Electrical Ltd &amp; Michael Traynor&quot; (1998) related to an unlicensed copy of the RAMDIS software system, &quot;Joblin-Purser v. Jackman&quot; and &quot;Microsoft v. Brightpoint&quot;, but the issue has not come before the Supreme Court and, owing to the civil nature of the order and the strong protection given to the family home in the constitution, it currently exists in something of a grey area.

=== New Zealand ===
The Anton Piller case is the basis for rule 33.3 of the High Court rules.

This rule requires that:

===Impoundment orders in the United States===
Orders comparable to Anton Piller orders have long been available in the United States under section 503(a) of the Copyright Act (17 USC, § 503(a)), which provides for the impounding of allegedly infringing copies of works and equipment for making them.

In recent years, questions have been raised about the abusive use of these orders, and the doubtful constitutionality of the procedures used. More recent decisions in the field have tended to require that impoundment must be necessary, reasonable, and comport with the requirements of due process.

== Combination with Mareva injunction ==

An Anton Piller order is often combined with a Mareva injunction, enabling an applicant to have the respondent&#x27;s assets frozen so they cannot be dissipated to frustrate the judgment. This can, however, be disastrous for a defendant as the cumulative effect of these orders can be to destroy the whole of a business&#x27; custom, by freezing most of its assets and revealing important information to its competitors.

<text>Jotham or Yotam (; , &quot;Yahweh is perfect&quot; or &quot;Yahweh is complete&quot;; ; ) was the youngest of Gideon&#x27;s seventy sons. He escaped when the rest were put to death by the order of his half-brother Abimelech (Judges 9:5).

When &quot;the citizens of Shechem and the whole house of Millo&quot; were gathered together &quot;by the plain of the pillar&quot; (i.e., the stone set up by Joshua, 24:26; compare Genesis 35:4) &quot;that was in Shechem, to make Abimelech king&quot;, from one of the heights of Mount Gerizim he protested against their doing so in the earliest parable in the Bible, that of the bramble-king. This parable is often repeated at Tu BiShvat and is famous in Israel. His words then spoken were prophetic. There came a recoil in the feelings of the people toward Abimelech, and then a terrible revenge, in which many were slain and the city of Shechem was destroyed by Abimelech (Judges 9:45). Having delivered his warning, Jotham fled to Beer from the vengeance of Abimelech (Judges 9:7–21).

<text>Charles Spittal Robb (born June 26, 1939) is an American former U.S. Marine Corps officer and politician who served as the 64th governor of Virginia from 1982 to 1986 and a United States senator representing Virginia from 1989 until 2001. A member of the Democratic Party, Robb sought a third term in the U.S. Senate in 2000, but was defeated by Republican George Allen, another former governor.

He is a son-in-law of Lyndon B. Johnson, the 36th President of the United States, through his marriage to his daughter, Lynda Bird Johnson. Their marriage in 1967 was the first in the White House since 1942.

Robb co-chaired the Iraq Intelligence Commission with former U.S. Attorney Laurence Silberman from February 2004 to December 2005. In 2006 he was appointed to serve on the President&#x27;s Intelligence Advisory Board. Since 2001, Robb has been a member of the board of trustees of the MITRE Corporation.

==Early life and education==

Charles Robb was born in Phoenix, Arizona, the son of Frances Howard (née Woolley) and James Spittal Robb. He grew up in the Mount Vernon area of Fairfax County, Virginia and graduated from Mount Vernon High School. He attended Cornell University before earning a Bachelor of Arts from the University of Wisconsin–Madison in 1961, where he was a member of Chi Phi fraternity.

A United States Marine Corps veteran and honor graduate of Quantico, Robb became a White House social aide. It was there that he met and eventually married Lynda Johnson, the daughter of then-U.S. President Lyndon B. Johnson in a service celebrated by the Right Reverend Gerald Nicholas McAllister. Robb went on to serve a tour of duty in Vietnam, where he commanded Company I of 3rd Battalion, 7th Marines in combat, and was awarded the Bronze Star and Vietnam Gallantry Cross with Star. Following his promotion to the rank of major, he was attached to the Logistics section (G-4), 1st Marine Division.

Robb earned a Juris Doctor from the University of Virginia Law School in 1973, and clerked for John D. Butzner, Jr., a judge on the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals. Afterwards he resided in McLean, Virginia and entered private practice with Williams &amp; Connolly. Robb became active in Virginia politics as a Democrat, and was a member of the Fairfax County Democratic Committee and the Virginia Democratic State Central Committee.

==Career==
===Lieutenant Governor===

In 1977 Robb won the election for lieutenant governor of Virginia, the only one of three Democrats running for statewide office to win that year, leaving him as the &quot;de facto&quot; head of a political party that had not won a governor&#x27;s race in a dozen years. He served from 1978 to 1982.

==Governor==
Robb led the statewide Democratic ticket as its candidate for governor in 1981. The three Democrats running for governor, lieutenant governor and attorney general won by appealing to conservatives who were disenchanted with Robb&#x27;s Republican opponent, J. Marshall Coleman. Virginia Democrats again won all three statewide offices in 1985, which was viewed as an endorsement of Robb&#x27;s leadership while in office. As a campaigner, Robb was capable but reserved. During a time when political communication styles were beginning to favor sound bites, Robb was known for speaking in paragraphs about complex policy issues. He was also noteworthy among his contemporaries for raising substantial sums of campaign funds. During his term as governor, Robb founded the Democratic Governors Association in 1983.

Politically, Robb was a moderate and known generally as being fiscally conservative, pro-national security, and progressive on social issues. As governor, he balanced the state budget without raising taxes and dedicated an additional $1 billion for education. He appointed a record number of women and minorities to state positions, including the first African American to the state Supreme Court. He was the first Virginia governor in 25 years to use the death penalty. Robb was instrumental in creating the Super Tuesday primary that brought political power to the Southern states. He was also a co-founder in creating the Democratic Leadership Council. He was a strong vote-getter in Virginia in the 1980s and helped mold a more progressive Virginia Democratic Party than the one that had ruled the state for decades. For a time he was considered a presidential or vice-presidential prospect.

===U.S. Senate===
Robb later served as a Democratic member of the United States Senate from 1989 until 2001. Robb was elected in 1988, defeating Maurice Dawkins with 71% of the vote. Robb ranked annually as one of the most ideologically centrist senators and often acted as a bridge between Democratic and Republican members, as he preferred background deal-making to legislative limelight. His fellow Democrats removed him from the Budget Committee for advocating deeper cuts in federal spending.

In 1991, he was one of a handful of Democratic senators to support authorizing the use of force to expel Iraqi forces from Kuwait. The same year, he was one of eight Southern Democrats who voted to confirm the nomination of Clarence Thomas to the U.S. Supreme Court in a 52 to 48 vote, the narrowest margin of approval in more than a century. In 1992, he was chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, and during his term, the DSCC raised record amounts of funding to elect seven new Democrats to the Senate. The Democratic victory included the election of four new female senators and the re-election of a fifth in what was called The Year of the Woman.

Robb was more liberal on social issues. He voted for the Federal Assault Weapons Ban and against the execution of minors. He was opposed to a constitutional amendment to ban flag burning. In 1993, he supported Bill Clinton&#x27;s proposal to adopt the don&#x27;t ask, don&#x27;t tell policy on homosexuals in the armed forces. Three years later, Robb was the only senator from a Southern state to oppose the Defense of Marriage Act. In stating his opposition to the bill, which his friends and supporters urged him to support, he said the following, &quot;I feel very strongly that this legislation is wrong. Despite its name, the Defense of Marriage Act does not defend marriage against some imminent, crippling effect. Although we have made huge strides in the struggle against discrimination based on gender, race, and religion, it is more difficult to see beyond our differences regarding sexual orientation. The fact that our hearts don&#x27;t speak in the same way is not cause or justification to discriminate.&quot; Some have speculated that his position on gay rights, along with his positions on other hot-button issues like abortion, alienated the generally conservative voters of Virginia and contributed to his eventual defeat.

Despite being outspent 4-1, Robb narrowly defeated former Iran-Contra figure Oliver North in 1994, a poor year nationally for Democrats. Senator John Warner refused to support North and instead backed third-party candidate and former Virginia Attorney General Marshall Coleman, whom Robb had defeated in the 1981 gubernatorial contest. The 1994 Senate campaign was documented in the 1996 film &quot;A Perfect Candidate&quot; and Brett Morgen&#x27;s &quot;Ollie&#x27;s Army&quot; (where Robb is seen being heckled on the campus of James Madison University). During the campaign, Robb won the endorsement of Reagan&#x27;s Naval Secretary (and future Democratic senator) Jim Webb, and high-profile Republicans such as Elliot Richardson, William Ruckelshaus, and William Colby.

Following his re-election in 1994, Robb continued to promote fiscal responsibility and a strong national defense; he was the only Senate Democrat to vote for all items in the Republican Party&#x27;s &quot;Contract with America&quot; when they reached the floor, including a Balanced Budget Amendment and a line item veto. He became the only senator to serve on all three national security committees: Armed Services, Foreign Relations, and Intelligence. After two terms in the Senate and 25 years in statewide politics, he was defeated in a close race in 2000 by Republican former governor, and former congressman George Allen, Robb was the only Democratic incumbent senator to be defeated in that election.

===Scandals===

In 1991, former Miss Virginia USA Tai Collins claimed to have had an affair with Robb seven years earlier, although her allegations were never corroborated and she offered no proof of the affair to reporters. Robb denied having an affair with her, merely admitting to sharing a bottle of champagne and receiving a massage from her in his hotel room on one occasion. Soon after making the allegations, Collins earned an undisclosed amount for posing nude for &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine.

There were also rumors that during the time he was governor, Robb was present at parties in Virginia Beach where cocaine was used. These rumors were never proven, despite intense investigation by reporters and political operatives. He strongly denied this when the issue was raised during his 1988 campaign for the U.S. Senate. Robb so vehemently denied the cocaine allegation that he claimed to have never seen cocaine.

In 1991, three of Robb&#x27;s aides resigned after pleading guilty to misdemeanors related to an illegally recorded cell phone conversation of Virginia Governor (and possible 1994 Senate primary opponent) Doug Wilder. The scandal of the phone conversation morphed into a federal grand jury investigation when it was alleged that Robb&#x27;s staff and Robb himself conspired to distribute the contents of a mobile phone call taped by an &quot;electronics buff.&quot; Robb and his staff claimed to be unaware of the fact that conversations on cell phones are protected by the same laws governing landlines. The grand jury concluded its eighteen-month investigation with a vote not to indict Robb. Relations between the Senator and Governor were described in the press as a &quot;feud&quot;.

In 1994 Robb released a five-and-a-half-page letter admitting to some behavior &quot;not appropriate for a married man&quot;. The letter did not go into details saying they &quot;are purely private&quot; between him and his wife and &quot;not really anybody else&#x27;s business.&quot; Robb denied using or witnessing the use of drugs. Robb also expressed regret for not acting quickly enough to end a conflict between his staff and Wilder&#x27;s, and for not insisting that the tape of Wilder&#x27;s conversation be destroyed immediately.
Republican State Senator Mark L. Earley told reporters he thought Robb&#x27;s letter was released to get ahead of a Washington Post story about allegations and memos from former Robb staffers. Bert Rohrer, a Robb spokesman, declared the charge as &quot;nonsense&quot; holding the process of crafting the letter had been months long and that he wanted to settle the issue before launching his re-election campaign.

=== Later career ===
Following his two terms in the Senate, Robb served on the board of visitors at the United States Naval Academy, and began teaching at George Mason University School of Law. On February 6, 2004, Robb was appointed co-chair of the Iraq Intelligence Commission, an independent panel tasked with investigating U.S. intelligence surrounding the United States&#x27; 2003 invasion of Iraq and Iraq&#x27;s weapons of mass destruction. In 2006 he was appointed to serve on the U.S. President&#x27;s Intelligence Advisory Board. He also served on the Iraq Study Group with former Secretary of State James A. Baker III. A &quot;New York Times&quot; article on October 9, 2006, credited Robb with being the only member of the group to venture outside the American controlled &quot;Green Zone&quot; on a recent trip to Baghdad. Robb has served since 2001 as a member of the board of trustees of the MITRE Corporation. Robb serves as a co-leader of the National Security Project (NSP) at the Bipartisan Policy Center. He is also a former member of the Trilateral Commission and is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations, for which he served on the Independent Task Force on Pakistan and Afghanistan. In addition, he currently serves on the board of directors of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. In April, 2021, the University of Virginia Press published his autobiography, titled &quot;In the Arena: A Memoir of Love, War, and Politics&quot;.

==Personal life==
Robb married Lynda Bird Johnson Robb, daughter of then President Lyndon Baines and Lady Bird Johnson, in 1967. They have three daughters (Jennifer, Catherine and Lucinda) and five grandchildren and reside in McLean, Virginia.

On the evening of December 21, 2021, their home was consumed in flames and Senator and Mrs. Robb were hospitalized. Robb was downstairs when the fire broke out and attempted to climb the stairs to get to his wife and was confronted by a wall of flame. He was signaled to leave the building when his wife, who had been alerted to the fire by a smoke detector, incurred injuries when she took the car out of the garage and shined its headlights on the downstairs exit door. Robb was taken to a local hospital and treated for burns then released, his wife was hospitalized for smoke inhalation and second-degree burn injuries on her hand and elbow that were non-life-threatening. The blaze (which could be seen across the Potomac River into Washington D.C.) destroyed their books, photos, artwork, and historic memorabilia along with the home they had purchased in 1973 which had been valued at $3 million in 2020.

<text>Joseph Black (16 April 1728 – 6 December 1799) was a British physicist and chemist, known for his discoveries of magnesium, latent heat, specific heat, and carbon dioxide. He was Professor of Anatomy and Chemistry at the University of Glasgow for 10 years from 1756, and then Professor of Medicine and Chemistry at the University of Edinburgh from 1766, teaching and lecturing there for more than 30 years.

The chemistry buildings at both the University of Edinburgh and the University of Glasgow are named after Black.

==Early life and education==
Black was born &quot;on the banks of the river Garonne&quot; in Bordeaux, France, the sixth of the 12 children of Margaret Gordon (&quot;d&quot;. 1747) and John Black. His mother was from an Aberdeenshire family that had connections with the wine business and his father was from Belfast, Ireland, and worked as a factor in the wine trade. He was educated at home until the age of 12, after which he attended grammar school in Belfast. In 1746, at the age of 18, he entered the University of Glasgow, studying there for four years before spending another four at the University of Edinburgh, furthering his medical studies. During his studies he wrote a doctorate thesis on the treatment of kidney stones with the salt magnesium carbonate.

==Scientific Studies==

=== Chemistry ===

==== Chemical principles ====
Like most 18th-century experimentalists, Black&#x27;s conceptualisation of chemistry was based on five principles of matter: Water, Salt, Earth, Fire and Metal. He added the principle of &quot;Air&quot; when his experiments showed the presence of carbon dioxide, which he called &quot;fixed air&quot;, thus contributing to pneumatic chemistry.

Black&#x27;s research was guided by questions relating to how the principles combined with each other in various different forms and mixtures. He used the term &quot;affinity&quot; to describe the force that held such combinations together. Throughout his career he used a variety of diagrams and formulas to teach his University of Edinburgh students how to manipulate affinity through different kinds of experimentation.

==== Analytical balance ====

In about 1750, while still a student, Black developed the analytical balance based on a light-weight beam balanced on a wedge-shaped fulcrum. Each arm carried a pan on which the sample or standard weights was placed. It far exceeded the accuracy of any other balance of the time and became an important scientific instrument in most chemistry laboratories.

==== Carbon dioxide ====
Black also explored the properties of a gas produced in various reactions. He found that limestone (calcium carbonate) could be heated or treated with acids to yield a gas he called &quot;fixed air.&quot; He observed that the fixed air was denser than air and did not support either flame or animal life. Black also found that when bubbled through an aqueous solution of lime (calcium hydroxide), it would precipitate calcium carbonate. He used this phenomenon to illustrate that carbon dioxide is produced by animal respiration and microbial fermentation.

=== Heat ===
In 1757, Black was appointed Regius Professor of the Practice of Medicine at the University of Glasgow. In 1756 or soon thereafter, he began an extensive study of heat. 

==== Specific heat ====
In 1760 Black realized that when two different substances of equal mass but different temperatures are mixed, the changes in number of degrees in the two substances differ, though the heat gained by the cooler substance and lost by the hotter is the same. Black related an experiment conducted by Daniel Gabriel Fahrenheit on behalf of Dutch physician Herman Boerhaave. For clarity, he then described a hypothetical, but realistic variant of the experiment: If equal masses of 100 °F water and 150 °F mercury are mixed, the water temperature increases by 20 ° and the mercury temperature decreases by 30 ° (to 120 °F), though the heat gained by the water and lost by the mercury is the same. This clarified the distinction between heat and temperature. It also introduced the concept of specific heat capacity, being different for different substances. Black wrote: “Quicksilver [mercury] ... has less capacity for the matter of heat than water.”

==== Latent heat ====
In 1761, Black deduced that the application of heat to ice at its melting point does not cause a rise in temperature of the ice/water mixture, but rather an increase in the amount of water in the mixture. Additionally, Black observed that the application of heat to boiling water does not result in a rise in temperature of a water/steam mixture, but rather an increase in the amount of steam. From these observations, he concluded that the heat applied must have combined with the ice particles and boiling water and become latent.

The theory of latent heat marks the beginning of thermodynamics. Black&#x27;s theory of latent heat was one of his more-important scientific contributions, and one on which his scientific fame chiefly rests. He also showed that different substances have different specific heats.

The theory ultimately proved important not only in the development of abstract science but in the development of the steam engine. Black and James Watt became friends after meeting around 1757 while both were at Glasgow. Black provided significant financing and other support for Watt&#x27;s early research in steam power. Black&#x27;s discovery of the latent heat of water would have been interesting to Watt, informing his attempts to improve the efficiency of the steam engine invented by Thomas Newcomen and develop the science of thermodynamics.

==Professorship==
In 1766, treading in the footsteps of his friend and former teacher at the University of Glasgow, Black succeeded William Cullen as Professor of Medicine and Chemistry at the University of Edinburgh (Cullen had moved to Edinburgh in 1755). His position at Glasgow University was filled by Alexander Stevenson.

At this point he gave up research and devoted himself exclusively to teaching. In this he was successful with audience attendance at his lectures increasing from year to year for more than thirty years. His lectures had a powerful effect in popularising chemistry and attendance at them even came to be a fashionable amusement.

Black was widely recognised as one of the most popular lecturers at the University. His chemistry course regularly attracted an exceptionally high number of students, with many attending two or three times. In addition to regularly introducing cutting-edge topics and meticulously selecting visually impressive experiments, Black employed a wide array of successful teaching tools that made chemistry accessible to his students (many of whom were as young as 14 years old). His students came from across the United Kingdom, its colonies and Europe, and hundreds of them preserved his lectures in their notebooks and disseminated his ideas after they left university.

On 17 November 1783 he became one of the founders of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. From 1788 to 1790 he was President of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh. He was a member of the revision committee for the editions of the college&#x27;s Pharmacopoeia Edinburgensis of 1774, 1783, and 1794. Black was appointed principal physician to King George III in Scotland.

Black&#x27;s research and teaching were reduced as a result of poor health. From 1793 his health declined further and he gradually withdrew from his teaching duties. In 1795, Charles Hope was appointed his coadjutor in his professorship, and in 1797, he lectured for the last time.

== Personal life ==

Black was a member of The Poker Club. He was 1st cousin, great friend and colleague to Adam Ferguson FRSE who married his niece Katherine Burnett in 1767, and associated with David Hume, Adam Smith, and the literati of the Scottish Enlightenment. He was also close to pioneering geologist James Hutton.

In 1773 he is listed as living on College Wynd on the south side of the Old Town. In the 1790s, he used Sylvan House in Sciennes as a summer retreat. A plaque, unveiled in 1991, commemorates his occupancy of the house.

Black never married. He died peacefully at his home 12 Nicolson Street in south Edinburgh in 1799 at the age of 71 and is buried in Greyfriars Kirkyard. The large monument lies in the sealed section to the south-west known as the Covenanter&#x27;s Prison.

In 2011, scientific equipment believed to belong to Black was discovered during an archaeological dig at the University of Edinburgh.

<doc id="457618" wikidata="Q1900567" url="?curid=457618" title="Mark-to-market accounting">
<text>Mark-to-market (MTM or M2M) or fair value accounting is accounting for the &quot;fair value&quot; of an asset or liability based on the current market price, or the price for similar assets and liabilities, or based on another objectively assessed &quot;fair&quot; value. Fair value accounting has been a part of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) in the United States since the early 1990s. Failure to use it is viewed as the cause of the Orange County Bankruptcy, even though its use is considered to be one of the reasons for the Enron scandal and the eventual bankruptcy of the company, as well as the closure of the accounting firm Arthur Andersen.

Mark-to-market accounting can change values on the balance sheet as market conditions change. In contrast, historical cost accounting, based on the past transactions, is simpler, more stable, and easier to perform, but does not represent current market value. It summarizes past transactions instead. Mark-to-market accounting can become volatile if market prices fluctuate greatly or change unpredictably. Buyers and sellers may claim a number of specific instances when this is the case, including inability to value the future income and expenses both accurately and collectively, often due to unreliable information, or over-optimistic or over-pessimistic expectations of cash flow and earnings.

==History and development==
In the 1800s in the U.S., marking to market was the usual practice of bookkeepers. This has been blamed for contributing to the frequent recessions up to the Great Depression and for the collapse of banks. The Securities and Exchange Commission told President Franklin Roosevelt that he should get rid of it, which he did in 1938. But in the 1980s the practice spread to major banks and corporations, and beginning in the 1990s mark-to-market accounting began to result in scandals.

To understand the original practice, consider that a futures trader, when beginning an account (or &quot;position&quot;), deposits money, termed a &quot;margin&quot;, with the exchange. This is intended to protect the exchange against loss. At the end of every trading day, the contract is marked to its present market value. If the trader is on the winning side of a deal, his contract has increased in value that day, and the exchange pays this profit into his account. In contrast, if the market price of his contract has decreased, the exchange charges his account that holds the deposited margin. If the balance of this account becomes less than the deposit required to maintain the account, the trader must immediately pay additional margin into the account in order to maintain the account (a &quot;margin call&quot;). (The Chicago Mercantile Exchange, doing even more, marks positions to market &quot;twice&quot; a day, at 10:00 am and 2:00 pm.)

Over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives, in contrast, are formula-based financial contracts between buyers and sellers, and are not traded on exchanges, so their market prices are not established by any active, regulated market trading. Market values are, therefore, not objectively determined or available readily (purchasers of derivative contracts are typically furnished with computer programs which compute market values based upon data input from the active markets and the provided formulas). During their early development, OTC derivatives such as interest rate swaps were not marked to market frequently. Deals were monitored on a quarterly or annual basis, when gains or losses would be acknowledged or payments exchanged.

As the practice of marking to market became more used by corporations and banks, some of them seem to have discovered that this was a tempting way to commit accounting fraud, especially when the market price could not be determined objectively (because there was no real day-to-day market available or the asset value was derived from other traded commodities, such as crude oil futures), so assets were being &quot;marked to model&quot; in a hypothetical or synthetic manner using estimated valuations derived from financial modeling, and sometimes marked in a manipulative manner to achieve spurious valuations. The most infamous use of mark-to-market in this way was the Enron scandal.

After the Enron scandal, changes were made to the mark to market method by the Sarbanes–Oxley Act in the US during 2002. The Act affected mark to market by forcing companies to implement stricter accounting standards. The stricter standards included more explicit financial reporting, stronger internal controls to prevent and identify fraud, and auditor independence. In addition, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) was created by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for the purpose of overseeing audits. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act also implemented harsher penalties for fraud, such as enhanced prison sentences and fines for committing fraud. Although the law was created to restore investor confidence, the cost of implementing the regulations caused many companies to avoid registering on stock exchanges in the United States.

Internal Revenue Code Section 475 contains the mark to market accounting method rule for taxation. Section 475 provides that qualified securities dealers who elect mark to market treatment shall recognize gain or loss as if the property were sold for its fair market value on the last business day of the year, and any gain or loss shall be taken into account for that year. The section also provides that dealers in commodities can elect mark to market treatment for any commodity (or their derivatives) which is actively traded (i.e., for which there is an established financial market that provides a reasonable basis to determine fair market value by disseminating price quotes from broker/dealers or actual prices from recent transactions).

==FAS 115==
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 115, &quot;Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities&quot;, commonly known as &quot;FAS 115&quot;, is an accounting standard issued during May 1993 by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), which became effective for entities with fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1993.

FAS 115 addresses the accounting and reporting for investments in equity securities that have readily determinable fair values and for all investments in debt securities. Those investments are to be classified in three categories and accounted for as follows:

*Debt securities that the enterprise has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as &quot;held-to-maturity&quot; securities and reported at amortized cost less impairment. (Amortization refers to spreading payments over multiple periods.)
*Debt and equity securities that are bought and held principally for the purpose of selling them in the near term are classified as &quot;trading&quot; securities and reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses included in earnings.
*Debt and equity securities not classified as either held-to-maturity securities or trading securities are classified as &quot;available-for-sale&quot; securities and reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings and reported in a separate component of shareholders&#x27; equity (Other Comprehensive Income).

==FAS 124==
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 124, &quot;Accounting for Certain Investments Held by Not-for-Profit Organizations&quot;, commonly known as &quot;FAS 124&quot;, is an accounting standard issued during November 1995 by FASB, which became effective for entities with fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1995.

FAS 124 requires that, for investments in equity securities with readily determinable fair values and for all investments in debt securities, a not-for-profit organization must report them at fair value, with gains and losses included in a Statement of Activities. A narrow exception is made to allow limited held-to-maturity accounting for a not-for-profit organization if comparable business entities are engaged in the same industry.

==FAS 157 / ASC 820==
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157, &quot;Fair Value Measurements&quot;, commonly known as &quot;FAS 157&quot;, was an accounting standard issued during September 2006 by FASB, which became effective for entities with fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. Under Accounting Standards Codification, FASB&#x27;s fair value accounting guidance has been recodified as ASC Topic 820.

FAS Statement 157 includes the following:

*Clarity of the definition of fair value;
*A fair value hierarchy used to classify the source of information used in fair value measurements (i.e., market-based or non-market based);
*Expanded disclosure requirements for assets and liabilities measured at fair value; and
*A modification of the long-standing accounting presumption that a measurement-date-specific &quot;transaction price&quot; of an asset or liability equals its same measurement-date-specific &quot;fair value&quot;.
*Clarification that changes in credit risk (both that of the counterparty and the company&#x27;s own credit rating) must be included in the valuation.

FAS 157 defines &quot;fair value&quot; as:
&quot;The price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date&quot;.

FAS 157 only applies when another accounting rule requires or permits a fair value measure for that item. While FAS 157 does not introduce any new requirements mandating the use of fair value, the definition as outlined does introduce certain important differences.

First, it is based on the exit price (for an asset, the price at which it would be sold (bid price)) rather than an entry price (for an asset, the price at which it would be bought (ask price)), regardless of whether the entity plans to hold the asset for investment or resell it later.

Second, FAS 157 emphasizes that fair value is market-based rather than entity-specific. Thus, the optimism that often characterizes an asset acquirer must be replaced with the skepticism that typically characterizes a dispassionate, risk-averse buyer.

FAS 157&#x27;s fair value hierarchy underpins the concepts of the standard. The hierarchy ranks the quality and reliability of information used to determine fair values, with level 1 inputs being the most reliable and level 3 inputs being the least reliable. Information based on direct observations of transactions (e.g., quoted prices) involving the same assets and liabilities, not assumptions, offers superior reliability; whereas, inputs based on unobservable data or a reporting entity&#x27;s own assumptions about the assumptions market participants would use are the least reliable. A typical example of the latter is shares of a privately owned company the value of which is based on projected cash flows.

Problems can occur when the market-based measurement does not accurately represent the underlying asset&#x27;s true value. This can occur when a company is forced to calculate the selling price of these assets or liabilities during unfavorable or volatile times, such as a financial crisis. For example, if the liquidity is low or investors are fearful, the current selling price of a bank&#x27;s assets could be much less than the value under normal liquidity conditions. The result would be a lowered shareholders&#x27; equity. This case occurred during the financial crisis of 2008/09 where many securities held on banks&#x27; balance sheets could not be valued efficiently as the markets had disappeared from them. During April 2009, however, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) voted on and approved new guidelines that would allow for the valuation to be based on a price that would be received in an orderly market rather than a forced liquidation, starting during the first quarter of 2009.

Although FAS 157 does not require fair value to be used on any new classes of assets, it does apply to assets and liabilities that are recorded at fair value in accordance with other applicable rules. The accounting rules for which assets and liabilities are held at fair value are complex. Mutual funds and securities companies have recorded assets and some liabilities at fair value for decades in accordance with securities regulations and other accounting guidance. For commercial banks and other types of financial services companies, some asset classes are required to be recorded at fair value, such as derivatives and marketable equity securities. For other types of assets, such as loan receivables and debt securities, it depends on whether the assets are held for trading (active buying and selling) or for investment. All trading assets are recorded at fair value. Loans and debt securities that are held for investment or to maturity are recorded at amortized cost, unless they are deemed to be impaired (in which case, a loss is recognized). However, if they are available for sale or held for sale, they are required to be recorded at fair value or the lower of cost or fair value, respectively. (FAS 65 and FAS 114 cover the accounting for loans, and FAS 115 covers the accounting for securities.) Notwithstanding the above, companies are permitted to account for almost any financial instrument at fair value, which they might elect to do in lieu of historical cost accounting (see FAS 159, &quot;The Fair Value Option&quot;).

Thus, FAS 157 applies in the cases above where a company is required or elects to record an asset or liability at fair value.

The rule requires a mark to &quot;market&quot;, rather than to some theoretical price calculated by a computer — a system often criticized as &quot;mark to make-believe&quot;. (Occasionally, for certain types of assets, the rule allows for using a model.)

Sometimes, there is a weak market for assets which trade relatively infrequently - often during an economic crisis. During these periods, there are few, if any buyers for such products. This complicates the marking process. In the absence of market information, an entity is allowed to use its own assumptions, but the objective is still the same: what would be the current value of a sale to a willing buyer. In developing its own assumptions, the entity can not ignore any available market data, such as interest rates, default rates, prepayment speeds, etc.

FAS 157 does not distinguish between non cash-generating assets, i.e., broken equipment, which can theoretically have zero value if nobody will buy them in the market – and cash-generating assets, like securities, which are still worth something for as long as they earn some income from their underlying assets. The latter cannot be marked down indefinitely, or at some point, can create incentives for company insiders to buy them from the company at the under-valued prices. Insiders are in the best position to determine the creditworthiness of such securities going forward. In theory, this price pressure should balance market prices to accurately represent the &quot;fair value&quot; of a particular asset. Purchasers of distressed assets should buy undervalued securities, thus increasing prices, allowing other Companies to consequently mark up their similar holdings.

Also new in FAS 157 is the idea of nonperformance risk. FAS 157 requires that in valuing a liability, an entity should consider the nonperformance risk. If FAS 157 simply required that fair value be recorded as an exit price, then nonperformance risk would be extinguished upon exit. However, FAS 157 defines fair value as the price at which you would transfer a liability. In other words, the nonperformance that must be valued should incorporate the correct discount rate for an ongoing contract. An example would be to apply higher discount rate to the future cash flows to account for the credit risk above the stated interest rate. The Basis for Conclusions section has an extensive explanation of what was intended by the original statement with regards to nonperformance risk (paragraphs C40-C49).

In response to the rapid developments of the financial crisis of 2007–2008, the FASB is fast-tracking the issuance of the proposed FAS 157-d, Determining the Fair Value of a Financial Asset in a Market That Is Not Active.

==IFRS 13==
IFRS 13, &quot;Fair Value Measurement&quot;, was adopted by the International Accounting Standards Board on May 12, 2011. IFRS 13 provides guidance for how to perform fair value measurement under International Financial Reporting Standards and took effect on January 1, 2013. It does not provide guidance as to when fair value should be used. The guidance is similar to the US GAAP guidance.

==Marking-to-market a derivatives position==
In marking-to-market a derivatives account, at pre-determined periodic intervals, each counterparty exchanges the change in the market value of their account in cash. For Over-The-Counter (OTC) derivatives, when one counterparty defaults, the sequence of events that follows is governed by an ISDA contract. When using models to compute the ongoing exposure, FAS 157 requires that the entity consider the default risk (&quot;nonperformance risk&quot;) of the counterparty and make a necessary adjustment to its computations.

For exchange traded derivatives, if one of the counterparties defaults in this periodic exchange, that counterparty&#x27;s account is immediately closed by the exchange and the clearing house is substituted for that counterparty&#x27;s account.
Marking-to-market virtually eliminates credit risk, but it requires the use of monitoring systems that usually only large institutions can afford.

==Use by brokers==
Stock brokers allow their clients to access credit via margin accounts. These accounts allow clients to borrow funds to buy securities. Therefore, the amount of funds available is more than the value of cash (or equivalents). The credit is provided by charging a rate of interest and requiring a certain amount of collateral, in a similar way that banks provide loans. Even though the value of securities (stocks or other financial instruments such as options) fluctuates in the market, the value of accounts is not computed in real time. Marking-to-market is performed typically at the end of the trading day, and if the account value decreases below a given threshold (typically a ratio predefined by the broker), the broker issues a margin call that requires the client to deposit more funds or liquidate the account.

== Mark-to-market accounting use by Enron ==

In Enron&#x27;s natural gas business, the accounting had been fairly straightforward: in each time period, the company listed actual costs of supplying the gas and actual revenues received from selling it. However, when Skilling joined the company, he demanded that the trading business adopt mark-to-market accounting, claiming that it would represent &quot;true economic value&quot;. Enron became the first nonfinancial company to use the method to account for its complex long-term contracts. Mark-to-market accounting requires that once a long-term contract has been signed, income is estimated as the present value of net future cash flow. Often, the viability of these contracts and their related costs were difficult to estimate. Owing to the large discrepancies between reported profits and cash, investors were typically given false or misleading reports. Under this method, income from projects that would be collected across the lifetime of the project, could all be recorded &quot;now&quot;, with this income increasing current financial earnings on the books immediately. However, because in future years these booked revenues could no longer be booked again, new and additional revenues had to be derived from more projects to develop additional growth to appease investors. As one Enron competitor stated, &quot;If you accelerate your income, then you have to keep doing more and more deals to show the same or rising income.&quot; Despite potential pitfalls, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved the accounting method for Enron in its trading of natural gas futures contracts on January 30, 1992. However, Enron later expanded its use to other areas in the company to help it meet Wall Street projections.

For one contract, in July 2000, Enron and Blockbuster Video signed a 20-year agreement to introduce on-demand entertainment to various U.S. cities by year&#x27;s end. After several pilot projects, Enron claimed estimated profits of more than $110 million from the deal, even though analysts questioned the technical viability and market demand of the service. When the network failed to work, Blockbuster withdrew from the contract. Enron continued to claim future profits, even though the deal resulted in a loss.

==Effect on subprime crisis and Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008==

Former Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Chair William Isaac placed much of the blame for the subprime mortgage crisis on the Securities and Exchange Commission and its fair-value accounting rules, especially the requirement for banks to mark their assets to market, particularly mortgage-backed securities (MBS). A review found little evidence that fair-value accounting had caused or exacerbated the crisis.

The debate occurs because this accounting rule requires companies to adjust the value of marketable securities (such as the MBS) to their market value. The intent of the standard is to help investors understand the value of these assets at a specific time, rather than just their historical purchase price. Because the market for these assets is distressed, it is difficult to sell many MBS at other than prices which may (or may not) be representative of market stresses, which may be less than the value that the mortgage cash flow related to the MBS would merit. As initially interpreted by companies and their auditors, the typically lesser sale value was used as the market value rather than the cash flow value. Many large financial institutions recognized significant losses during 2007 and 2008 as a result of marking-down MBS asset prices to market value.

For some institutions, this also triggered a margin call, such that lenders that had provided the funds using the MBS as collateral had contractual rights to get their money back. This resulted in further forced sales of MBS and emergency efforts to obtain cash (liquidity) to pay off the margin call. Markdowns may also reduce the value of bank regulatory capital, requiring additional capital raising and creating uncertainty regarding the health of the bank.

It is the combination of the extensive use of financial leverage (i.e., borrowing to invest, leaving limited funds in the event of recession), margin calls and large reported losses that may have exacerbated the crisis. If cash flow-derived value — which excludes market judgment as to default risk but may also more accurately represent &quot;actual&quot; value if the market is sufficiently distressed — is used (rather than sale value), the size of market-value adjustments required by the accounting standard would be typically reduced.

On September 30, 2008, the SEC and the FASB issued a joint clarification regarding the implementation of fair value accounting in cases where a market is disorderly or inactive. This guidance clarified that forced liquidations are not indicative of fair value, as this is not an &quot;orderly&quot; transaction. Further, it clarifies that estimates of fair value can be made using the expected cash flows from such instruments, provided that the estimates represent adjustments that a willing buyer would make, such as adjustments for default and liquidity risks.

Section 132 of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, which passed on October 3, 2008, restated the SEC&#x27;s authority to suspend the application of FAS 157, and Section 133 required a report by the SEC which was delivered December 30, 2008.

On October 10, 2008, the FASB issued further guidance to provide an example of how to estimate fair value in cases where the market for that asset is not active at a reporting date.

On December 30, 2008, the SEC issued its report under Sec. 133 and decided not to suspend mark-to-market accounting.

On March 16, 2009, FASB proposed allowing companies to use more leeway in valuing their assets under &quot;mark-to-market&quot; accounting. On April 2, 2009, after a 15-day public comment period and a contentious testimony before the U.S. House Financial Services subcommittee, FASB eased the mark-to-market rules through the release of three FASB Staff Positions (FSPs). Financial institutions are still required by the rules to mark transactions to market prices but more so in a steady market and less so when the market is inactive. To proponents of the rules, this eliminates the unnecessary &quot;positive feedback loop&quot; that can result in a weakened economy.

On April 9, 2009, FASB issued an official update to FAS 157 that eases the mark-to-market rules when the market is unsteady or inactive. Early adopters were allowed to apply the ruling as of March 15, 2009, and the rest as of June 15, 2009.
It was anticipated that these changes could significantly increase banks&#x27; statements of earnings and allow them to defer reporting losses. The changes, however, affected accounting standards applicable to a broad range of derivatives, not just banks holding mortgage-backed securities.

During January 2010, Adair Turner, Chairman of the UK&#x27;s Financial Services Authority, said that marking to market had been a cause of exaggerated bankers&#x27; bonuses. This is because it produces a self-reinforcing cycle during an increasing market that feeds into banks&#x27; profit estimates. Other academics, such as S.P. Kothari and Karthik Ramanna, have made similar arguments.

<doc id="457620" wikidata="Q426449" url="?curid=457620" title="Interventional radiology">
<text>Interventional radiology (IR) is a medical specialty that performs various minimally-invasive procedures using medical imaging guidance, such as x-ray fluoroscopy, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, or ultrasound. IR performs both diagnostic and therapeutic procedures through very small incisions or body orifices. Diagnostic IR procedures are those intended to help make a diagnosis or guide further medical treatment, and include image-guided biopsy of a tumor or injection of an imaging contrast agent into a hollow structure, such as a blood vessel or a duct. By contrast, therapeutic IR procedures provide direct treatment—they include catheter-based medicine delivery, medical device placement (e.g., stents), and angioplasty of narrowed structures.

The main benefits of IR techniques are that they can reach the deep structures of the body through a body orifice or tiny incision using small needles and wires. This decreases risks, pain, and recovery compared to open procedures. Real-time visualization also allows precision guidance to the abnormality, making the procedure or diagnosis more accurate. These benefits are weighed against the additional risks of lack of immediate access to internal structures (should bleeding or a perforation occur), and the risks of radiation exposure such as cataracts and cancer.

== Types ==
===Common elements===
Interventional radiology is a set of techniques that allows access to the internal structures of the body through body orifices or very small incisions and guidance with medical imaging. Regardless of the reason for the intervention, the procedure will likely use common elements such as a puncture needle (to pass through the skin), guidewires (to guide through structures such as blood vessels or the biliary or urinary systems), a sheath (which slides over the guidewire and holds the path open without injuring it), and catheters (that allow fluids to be pushed through them).

Also common to all intervention radiology procedures are the medical imaging machines that allow the healthcare provider to see what is occurring within the body. Some use X-rays (such as CT and fluoroscopy) and some do not (such as ultrasound and MRI). In each case, the images created may be modified by computer to better visualize the structures as is in the case with digital subtraction angiography, CT and MRI, or the display of the images improved with virtual reality or augmented reality presentation.

===Diagnostic interventional radiology===
* Angiography: Imaging the blood vessels to look for abnormalities with the use of various contrast media, including iodinated contrast, gadolinium based agents, and gas.
* Cholangiography: Imaging the bile ducts within the liver to look for areas of blockage.
* Biopsy: Taking of a tissue sample from the area of interest for pathological examination from a percutaneous or transvenous approach.
* Fine-needle aspiration: obtaining cells from a tissue or organ under ultrasound guidance.

===Therapeutic interventional radiology===
&quot;Vascular&quot;
* Balloon angioplasty/stent: Opening of narrow or blocked blood vessels using a balloon, with or without placement of metallic stents to aid in keep vessel patent.
* Endovascular aneurysm repair: Placement of endovascular stent-graft across an aneurysm to prevent expansion or progression of the defective vessel.
* Embolization: Placement of a metallic coil or embolic substance (gel-foam, poly-vinyl alcohol) to block blood through to a blood vessel, either to stop bleeding or decrease blood flow to a target organ or tissue.
** Uterine artery embolization (UAE) or uterine fibroid embolization (UFE)
** Prostate artery embolization (PAE)
** Pulmonary arteriovenous malformation (PAVM) embolization
** Hemorrhoidal artery embolization (HAE)
* Thrombolysis: Catheter-directed technique for dissolving blood clots, such as pulmonary embolism and deep venous thrombosis, with either pharmaceutical (TPA) or mechanical means.
* IVC filters: Metallic filters placed in the vena cava to prevent propagation of deep venous thrombus.
* Dialysis-related interventions: Placement of tunneled hemodialysis catheters, peritoneal dialysis catheters, and revision/thrombolysis of poorly functioning surgically placed AV fistulas and grafts.
* TIPS: Placement of a transjugular intrahepatic porto-systemic shunt (TIPS) for select indications in patients with critical end-stage liver disease and portal hypertension.
* Endovenous laser treatment of varicose veins: Placement of thin laser fiber in varicose veins for non-surgical treatment of venous insufficiency.
* Chemoembolization: Combined injection of chemotherapy and embolic agents into the arterial blood supply of a tumor, with the goal of both local administration of chemotherapy, slowing &quot;washout&quot; of the chemotherapy drug, and also decreasing tumor arterial supply
* Radioembolization: Combined injection of radioactive glass or plastic beads and embolic agents into the arterial blood supply of a tumor, with the goal of both local administration of radiotherapy, slowing &quot;washout&quot; of the radioactive substance, and also decreasing tumor arterial supply
&quot;Biliary intervention&quot;
* Placement of catheters in the biliary system to bypass biliary obstructions and decompress the biliary system.
* Placement of permanent indwelling biliary stents.
* Cholecystostomy: Placement of a tube into the gallbladder to remove infected bile in patients with cholecystitis, an inflammation of the gallbladder, who are too frail or too sick to undergo surgery.

&quot;Catheter placement&quot;
* Central venous catheter placement: Vascular access and management of intravenous devices (IVs), including both tunneled and non-tunneled catheters (e.g., PIC, Hickman, port catheters, hemodialysis catheters, translumbar and transhepatic venous lines).
* Drainage catheter placement: Placement of tubes to drain pathologic fluid collections (e.g., abscess, pleural effusion). This may be achieved by percutaneous, trans-rectal, or trans-vaginal approach. Exchange or repositioning of indwelling catheters is achieved over a guidewire under image guidance.
* Radiologically inserted gastrostomy or jejunostomy: Placement of a feeding tube percutaneously into the stomach and/or jejunum.

&quot;Ablative&quot;
* Radiofrequency ablation (RF/RFA): Local treatment in which a special catheter destroys tissue with heat generated by medium frequency alternating currents
* Cryoablation: Local treatment with a special catheter that destroys tissue with cold temperature generated by rapid expansion of compressed argon gas—used mostly to treat small renal cancers and for the palliation of painful bone lesions
* Microwave ablation: Local treatment with a special catheter that destroys tissue with heat generated by microwaves

&quot;Genitourinary&quot;
* Percutaneous nephrostomy or nephroureteral stent placement: Placement of a catheter through the skin, directly into the kidney to drain from the collecting system. This is typically done to treat a downstream obstruction of urine.
* Ureteral stent exchange: indwelling double-J type ureteral stents, typically placed by urologist using cystoscopy, may be exchanged in retrograde fashion through the female urethra. The IR uses a thin wire snare under fluoroscopy to capture the distal portion of the stent. After partially extracting the distalmost stent, exchange for a new stent can be accomplished over a guidewire.

==Techniques for specific disorders==
=== Gastrointestinal intervention ===

==== Gastrointestinal hemorrhage ====
The treatment of gastrointestinal hemorrhage can range anywhere from monitoring an asymptomatic bleed to supporting and maintaining the hemodynamic function of the patient. The role for the interventional radiologist is to offer patients an image-guided, minimally invasive procedure to alleviate a condition that could be otherwise be potentially life-threatening.

The avenue for the interventional radiologist to dictate the clinical course of a GI bleed is largely influenced by location of bleed, overall patient health and other conditions the patient may have, most notably heart and liver functions. For most cases, collaboration between the gastroenterologist and interventional radiologist optimizes patient outcome but again, is largely dictated by anatomical location of the GI bleed. If a patient is evaluated and determined to be a candidate for an interventional procedure, then the bleed is often treated by embolization. Embolization is a process in which the interventional radiologist accesses the culprit bleeding vessel via a small catheter and interrupts blood flow to the site of bleeding via various mechanisms. Side effects of this procedure are minimal but there is a risk of bleeding and infection—though much less than the equivalent surgical procedure. When successful, the procedure often eliminates the bleed and patients can walk after a few hours of rest.

=== Hepatobiliary intervention ===

==== Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt ====
A transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) is a procedure an interventional radiologist performs to create a shunt (essentially, a new conduit allowing for blood flow) between the hepatic inferior vena cava and the portal vein, a vessel that returns blood from the intestines to the liver. The portal vein is the site where hypertension (high blood pressure) can produce a myriad of deleterious effects throughout the liver and small or large intestine.

Primarily, a TIPS functions to alleviate two different conditions: an emergent/life-threatening GI bleed or ascites (excessive abdominal fluid) caused by too high of blood pressure in the portal vein that is otherwise uncontrolled by diet and medications.

The workup for the procedure is straightforward and the interventional radiologist performing the procedure often orders several tests to assess how well the patient will tolerate the procedure. These are often simple blood tests, and an ultrasound of the heart and liver. The procedure is often well tolerated and can result in a permanent reduction or elimination of symptoms. The procedure can take anywhere between 15 minutes to an hour and has lower risks of bleeding or infection compared to an equivalent surgical procedure.

A TIPS may cause temporary confusion or worsening of liver/heart function. The degree of these two side effects largely depends on the health of the patient&#x27;s heart and liver prior to the procedure and the risk-benefits of the procedure must be thoroughly discussed with their interventional radiologist before beginning. If the post-procedural consequences are more troublesome to the patient than their initial symptoms the artificial conduit created by the procedure can be reversed if the post-procedural side effects outweigh those caused by the prior conditions.

==== Biliary intervention ====
In addition to normal liver tissue, the liver has three main vessels traversing it: arteries, veins and bile ducts. While bile is made in the liver and stored in the gallbladder, the bile eventually passes into the GI tract through the hepatic, cystic and common bile ducts. Any condition that prevents the normal flow of bile from the liver, through these bile vessels and into the GI tract can cause a condition called jaundice.

While jaundice can be caused by a few viruses that the human body can naturally clear, jaundice in the setting of an obstruction is usually caused by a cancer and can result in intolerable itching and a worsening of liver function that can be life-threatening. Depending on a patient&#x27;s condition, this type of obstructive jaundice can be alleviated with surgery or chemotherapy but if these measures fail to restore proper flow of bile, an interventional radiologist can perform a procedure called a percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography (PTC).

A PTC is an outpatient procedure lasting anywhere from 15 minutes to an hour where an interventional radiologist accesses the patient&#x27;s bile duct system with a needle through the skin and liver under imaging guidance. Using fluoroscopy (essentially an X-ray camera) to guide a wire (followed by a catheter over the wire) through the bile duct system and into the GI tract, essentially restoring the normal flow of bile. If the patient&#x27;s GI tract cannot be accessed due to the obstruction, the catheter can be placed to drain the bile duct system into a bag that the patient can wear during daily activities. Risks of this procedure include bleeding and infection but these are much lower than an equivalent surgical procedure.

=== Genitourinary intervention ===

==== Benign prostatic hyperplasia ====
Benign prostatic hyperplasia, or BPH, is a noncancerous condition that commonly affects men over the age of 50. The prostate gland enlarges and compresses the adjacent urethra, making it difficult for men to control frequency and/or urgency of urination. First-line therapy involves medication, though long-term treatment for symptoms that are persistent despite medical optimization typically involves transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) as the &quot;gold standard&quot; of care. However, TURP can lead to urinary incontinence or permanent male infertility and may not be the ideal procedure for a certain subset of patients. For those reasons, a physician may recommend undergoing a treatment known as prostate artery embolization (PAE).

Patients typically go home the same day as the procedure and can expect to feel some symptom relief in a matter of days. Though rare, risks of PAE include unintentional embolization of nearby blood vessels, which can result in loss of blood flow to surrounding areas of the bladder or rectum.

Data suggests that TURP may have higher rates of symptom resolution at one and six months, but PAE appears to provide lower risks of complications more commonly associated with surgery, such as infection.

==== Kidney stone disease ====
Kidney stones can be present along any part of the course of the urinary tract from the kidneys to the urethra. The most common symptoms, whether in men or women, are sudden onset, intense flank pain accompanied by blood in the urine. Most kidney stones pass spontaneously, but larger ones (greater than 5 mm) are less likely to, and can cause severe pain or infection.

The interventional radiologist plays a large clinical role in the treatment of kidney stones that are unlikely to pass on their own. The gold standard of treatment for these types of stones is surgical removal. However, some patients have an infected stone and are simply too ill for an operative surgical removal. In these instances, the mainstay of IR treatment is a percutaneous nephrostomy tube. This is a procedure where a small caliber catheter is placed through the skin and into the urinary collecting system upstream of the stone. This procedure not only drains any infection, often bringing about a precipitous improvement in the patient&#x27;s symptoms but also diverts urine—thus giving the patient more time to recover before definitive surgical treatment.

==== Varicocele ====
A varicocele is defined as an enlargement of the veins within the scrotum, most commonly occurring on the left side due to anatomical reasons. When this happens, blood can stagnate within these dilated veins and cause temperature fluctuations within the testicle itself. The exact cause to this condition remains unknown and an ill-favored sequela can be male infertility.

The mainstay of treatment for this condition within the field of interventional radiology is varicocele embolization. An embolization, within the context of this procedure, results in the interruption of venous blood flow. The interruption of blood flow abates venous dilation of blood that can lead to impaired testicular temperature regulation and theoretically improve infertility. The physician accesses the dilated scrotal veins with a small catheter via a vein in the groin and embolizes the varicocele. Patients often tolerate this procedure well and are able to return home the same day.

=== Neurological intervention ===

==== Acute ischemic stroke ====
About 87% of all strokes are ischemic strokes, in which blood flow to the brain is blocked. A clot-busting medication such as tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) can be used in a controlled hospital setting to dissolve the clot and help restore blood flow to the damaged area of the brain. Certain patients with an acute ischemic stroke may be candidates for endovascular therapy. Endovascular therapy is a procedure performed by neurointerventionalists to remove or dissolve the thrombus (clot) and restore blood flow to parts of the brain. Using a catheter that is directed through the blood vessels in the arm or leg up to the brain, the interventionalist can remove the thrombus or deliver drugs to dissolve the thrombus. These procedures are referred to as mechanical thrombectomy or thrombolysis, and several factors are considered before the procedure is completed.

People who may be eligible for endovascular treatment have a large vessel occlusion, which means the thrombus is in an artery that is large enough to reach and there are no contraindications such as a hemorrhagic stroke (bleeding in the brain), elapsed time of greater than six hours since onset of symptoms, or greater than 24 hours in special cases. Hospitals with comprehensive stroke centers are equipped to treat patients with endovascular care.

Long-term care after an ischemic stroke is focused on rehabilitation and preventing future blood clots using anticoagulant therapy. Patients work with specialists from fields such as physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech therapy to complete recovery.

==== Intracranial aneurysm ====
Although there are no clearly defined recommendations on treatment of asymptomatic aneurysms, all symptomatic unruptured brain aneurysms should be treated. Endovascular therapy is an effective treatment for select cases. During this treatment, an interventional radiologist inserts a catheter into the patient&#x27;s leg and uses it to guide a coil through blood vessels to the site of the aneurysm. The coil induces clotting within the aneurysm, which reduces the risk of rupture. Multiple coils may be used depending on the size. Imaging studies (DSA, CTA, or MRA) help characterize the aneurysm to decide the best course of treatment, whether endovascular coiling or surgical clipping. Endovascular coiling is associated with a reduction in procedural morbidity and mortality over surgical. For cases of ruptured aneurysms, emergent treatment is based on the type of aneurysm, and may use a combination of techniques. Conservative therapy focuses on minimizing modifiable risk factors with blood pressure control and smoking cessation.

==== Cerebral arteriovenous malformation ====
Arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are abnormal blood vessel structures in which an artery connects to a vein via an abnormal channel. This creates a high flow system that puts the vessel at risk of rupture. Ruptured AVMs require emergency management of the patient; unruptured AVMs require expert consultation to discuss the risks and benefits of treatment. Current treatment options include conservative management, surgical resection, stereotactic radiosurgery, endovascular embolization, or combinations of these treatments. Endovascular embolization is a technique used by neurointerventionalists in which particles, glue, or coils are lodged inside the AVM to prevent blood flow through the abnormal channel. During this treatment, an interventional radiologist guides a catheter through a blood vessel accessed from the patient&#x27;s leg to the site of the AVM. The particles, glue, or coils induce clotting within the malformation, which reduces the risk of rupture.

=== Pain management ===
==== Joint and local injections ====
Utilizing image guidance, local anesthetics and/or long-acting steroid medications can be directly delivered to localized sites of pain. The use of image guidance helps to confirm appropriate needle placement. This includes common imaging modalities used in joint injections: ultrasound, fluoroscopy and computerized tomography (CT).

===== Facet joints =====
* Facet joints, also known as zygapophyseal joints, refer to small bony structures located between the vertebrae of the spine that promote spinal stability.
* Degeneration or damage to the facet joints can often lead to facet joint syndrome, which can be both diagnosed and treated by image-guided injection of anesthetics.
* Facet joint block is a minimally invasive procedure in which a physician uses fluoroscopy or CT imaging to guide the placement of an injection of medication into a facet joint to provide pain relief.

===== Sacroiliac joints =====
* The sacroiliac joint is a structure that is located at the bottom of the spine, and connects the spine to hips. The purpose of this joint is to help the spine bear the weight of the upper region of the body. The sacroiliac joint also decreases the incidence of injuries by improving overall stability and restricting the torso&#x27;s range of movement.
* A sacroiliac joint injection is typically performed to decrease persistent back pain that developed due to an injured or inflamed sacroiliac joint.

===== Epidural space =====
* In the spine, the epidural space is an anatomic space that is the outermost part of the spinal canal. It is the space within the canal (formed by the surrounding vertebrae) lying outside the dura mater (which encloses the arachnoid mater, subarachnoid space, the cerebrospinal fluid, and the spinal cord).
* Injection of local anesthetics is often performed to treat local pain or radiculopathy, particularly due to disc herniation or central/foraminal stenosis.
* Usually performed under fluoroscopic guidance.

===== Selective nerve root injection =====
* A spinal nerve root is the initial or proximal segment of one of the thirty-one pairs of spinal nerves leaving the central nervous system from the spinal cord.
* Damage to nerve roots can cause paresis and paralysis of the muscle innervated by the affected spinal nerve. It can also cause pain and numbness in the corresponding dermatome. A common cause of damage to the nerve roots are lesions in the spine, such as prolapse of the nucleus pulposus, spinal tuberculosis, cancer, inflammation and spinal tabes. Root pain syndromes, known colloquially as radiculitis (i.e., sciatica) are one of the most common symptoms caused by damage to the nerve root.
* Used to treat patients with radicular symptoms in the cervical, thoracic, lumbar or sacral region.
* Helps to alleviate pain by dealing with inflammation of the nerve root.

==== Chronic pelvic pain ====
* Veins have one-way valves that help blood flow toward the heart. If the valves are weak or damaged, blood can pool in veins, making them swell. When this happens near the pelvis, it is called pelvic congestion syndrome, which can lead to chronic pain beneath the level of the belly button.
* Pelvic congestion syndrome usually affects women who have previously been pregnant, because the ovarian veins and pelvic veins had widened to accommodate the increased blood flow from the uterus during pregnancy. After the pregnancy, some of these veins remain enlarged and fail to return to their previous size, causing them to weaken and allowing blood to pool.
* An interventional radiologist can offer a minimally invasive treatment option for pelvic congestion syndrome: ovarian vein embolization
* Ovarian vein embolization is a same-day treatment which takes place in an interventional radiology suite. The interventional radiologist gains access through a large vein in the groin, called the femoral vein, by using a small catheter, which is a flexible tube like a strand of spaghetti. The catheter is moved through the vein to the enlarged pelvic veins, allowing the introduction of embolic agents, which are medications that cause the vein to seal off and relieve the painful pressure.
** This treatment can be less expensive than surgery and is much less invasive.
* A number of diagnostic tests can be performed through minimally invasive methods, to determine whether a patient&#x27;s chronic pelvic pain is a result of pelvic varicose veins. These tests include:
** Pelvic and transvaginal ultrasound
** Pelvic venogram
** Computed tomography (CT)
** Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)

==== Palliative care ====
* Palliative care is an interdisciplinary approach to specialized medical and nursing care for people with life-limiting illnesses. It focuses on providing relief from the symptoms, pain, physical stress, and mental stress at any stage of illness. The goal is to improve quality of life for both the person and their family.
* The interventional radiologist may be uniquely skilled as hospice and palliative medicine providers. As an imager, the radiologist is the expert in obtaining maximum imaging value; furthermore, the radiologist has extensive experience in diagnostic image interpretation and disease prognostication. In addition, the interventional radiologist has an array of both therapeutic and palliative interventions to offer the patient coping with a life-threatening illness.

==== Nerve block/ablations ====
* Injection of medication or anesthetic to decrease inflammation or &quot;turn off&quot; a pain signal along a specific distribution of nerve.
* &quot;Block&quot; vs. ablation: Although these terms are often used interchangeably, they differ in terms of duration of action.
** Nerve block: &quot;temporary disruption of the disruption of pain transmission via the celiac plexus and is accomplished by injecting corticosteroids or long-acting local anesthetics&quot;.
** Neurolysis: &quot;permanent destruction of the celiac plexus with ethanol or phenol&quot;.
* Types of blocks/neurolyses:
** Celiac plexus block/neurolysis: A procedure performed to manage refractory cancer-related abdominal pain by modulating the celiac plexus, which is a network of nerve fibers located in the retroperitoneum along the anterolateral wall of the aorta.
*** Often used in the management of incurable pancreatic cancer.
*** Often utilizes multidetector CT for image guidance.
** Superior hypogastric plexus block/neurolysis: A procedure performed to manage refractory abdominal/pelvis pain by modulating the superior hypogastric plexus, which is a network of nerve fibers located in the retroperitoneum that modulate pain from the bladder, vulva, vagina, uterus, urethra, penis, perineum, prostate, testes, rectum, and colon.
** Lumbar sympathetic block: A procedure performed to manage pain originating from the lower back, buttocks or legs.
*** Common indications: complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS)/regional sympathetic dystrophy (RDS), post-herpetic neuralgia, neuropathy.
** Pudendal nerve block: A procedure performed to manage chronic pelvic pain.
*** Common indications: pudendal neuralgia (i.e., repetitive use from cycling), cancer-related pain
** Sphenopalatine ganglion block
*** A procedure performed to manage head and neck pain/headaches related to the trigeminal nerve, usually in the treatment of migraine headaches.

==== Palliative bone/musculoskeletal ====
* The standard of care for local treatment of extraspinal osseous metastases is external-beam radiation therapy. Fifty percent of patients who undergo this therapy achieve complete response or resolution of symptoms. Of the remaining patients, half fail therapy (20–30% of the total), 10% require retreatment, and 1–3% experience debilitating complications such as fracture of the treated bone.
* Due to the need for multiple treatments requiring multiple transports to and from the hospital and potential disruption to treatment/therapy, minimally invasive options in the treatment of extraspinal osseous metastases have emerged as attractive options in management of symptomatic metastases. These typically take the form of three types of ablative therapy: microwave thermal ablation, radiofrequency ablation (&quot;coblation&quot;) and cryoablation.
** Microwave thermal ablation
*** Microwave ablation is a treatment that uses heat to treat tumors. An interventional radiologist makes a tiny incision in the skin to insert a special needle into the body. Using a live computed tomography (CT) scan or an ultrasound, the doctor guides the needle to the tumor. The interventional radiologist generates electromagnetic microwaves that can destroy the tumor.
*** The advantages of microwave ablation (removal of tissue) compared to radiofrequency ablation include a generation of higher temperatures and the ability to use multiple needles to better destroy larger tumors.
*** After the treatment, patients follow up with their physician for several months. The treatment team also orders additional imaging scans to evaluate whether the microwave ablation successfully destroyed the tumor.
** Plasma-mediated radiofrequency ablation (&quot;coblation&quot;)
*** Radiofrequency ablation is a treatment that uses heat to destroy multiple small tumors. An interventional radiologist makes a tiny incision and uses either a computed tomography (CT) scan or ultrasound to guide a special needle to the site of the tumors. Next, radiofrequency (RF) electrodes are placed into the tumor. The electrodes generate an electric current (RF energy), which produces heat that destroys the tumor. This technique can be repeated at multiple sites, as necessary, before the interventional radiologist removes the RF electrode.
*** After the treatment, patients follow up with their physician for several months. The treatment team orders additional imaging scans to evaluate whether the radiofrequency ablation successfully destroyed the tumor.
** Cryoablation
*** Cryoablation is a treatment option that destroys cancer cells by applying extremely cold temperatures at the location of the tumor. A small cut is made in the skin and a tiny needle called a cryoprobe is inserted. Using image-guidance—either by a computed tomography (CT) scan or by ultrasound—the interventional radiologist maneuvers the cryoprobe toward the location of the tumor.
*** Next, the cryoprobes are inserted into the tumor to begin freezing it with a gas called argon, creating an &quot;ice ball&quot; over the entire tumor to freeze it for about ten minutes. Nitrogen gas is then used to thaw the tumor for five minutes. This cycle is repeated two or three times depending on the tumor type and size.

==== Vertebral augmentation ====
Vertebral augmentation, which includes vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty, are similar spinal procedures in which bone cement is injected through a small hole in the skin into a fractured vertebra to try to relieve back pain caused by a vertebral compression fractures. It was found ineffective in treating osteoporosis-related compression fractures of the spine. The people in both the experimental and placebo groups reported improvement in their pain, suggesting that the benefit is related to the placebo effect. , routine use is thus not recommended.

==== Sacroplasty ====
* Sacral insufficiency fractures are an infrequent but often disabling cause of severe low back pain. At times, the pain can be so severe that it may cause the patients to become bedridden, placing them at risk for complications of immobility such as deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary emboli, muscle atrophy, decubitus ulcers, and bone demineralization. Until the development of the sacroplasty technique, there was no definitive treatment other than bed rest.
* Sacral insufficiency fractures result from an axial loading mechanism on abnormal bone, such as osteoporosis or underlying neoplasm.
* Analogous to vertebroplasty, the purpose of sacroplasty is to provide stabilization to prevent painful micromotion at the fracture site. A needle is placed through the skin and into the bone under CT guidance and a polymethylmethacrylate mixture is injected into the sacrum under real-time fluoroscopy.
* Sacroplasty is a safe and effective procedure in the treatment of sacral insufficiency fractures that can provide substantial pain relief and lead to a better quality of life.

=== Interventional oncology ===

==== Procedures performed ====
* Image-guided ablation: Uses different types of energy to burn (radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and microwave ablation (MWA)), deliver electrical fields/electroporate (irreversible electroporation (IRE)) or freeze (cryoablation) solid tumors resulting in tumor cell death. Ablation techniques can be performed throughout the body such as in the lung, liver, kidney, prostate, breast, bone, and other organs using image guidance to place a needle/probe through the skin into the target tissue.
* High intensity focused ultrasound: Uses a machine that emits high frequency sound waves to kill cancer cells and provide relief for tumor-related pain, such as in the bone.
* Transarterial embolization (TAE)/bland embolization: Injection of embolic material (microparticles, alcohol, glue) through a catheter into the arteries feeding a tumor to completely occlude the tumor&#x27;s blood supply and cause cell death. The most common indication is for treatment of unresectable liver cancer (hepatocellular carcinoma).
* Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE): Injection of a chemotherapy agent often with microparticles through a catheter into arteries feeding a tumor that both delivers chemotherapy and blocks the blood supply to the tumor to cause cell death
* Can be performed in different ways:
** Conventional transarterial chemoembolization (cTACE): Injection of lipiodol with high dose chemotherapy with or without microparticles directly into the tumor-feeding arteries.
** Drug eluting bead transarterial chemoembolization (DEB-TACE): delivery of microparticles that are themselves loaded with the chemotherapy agent—typically doxorubicin or irinotecan.
* Selective internal radiation therapy (also known as SIRT or Y-90 radioembolization): Injection of small beads loaded with a radioactive isotope, yittrium-90 (Y-90), into blood vessels feeding a tumor to deliver a lethal dose of radiation to cause cell death. Can be performed in a segmental (radiation segmentectomy) or a lobar (radiation lobectomy) fashion. Radiation lobectomy is commonly performed with the goal of inducing growth of the non-diseased lobe in order to have adequate liver function necessary to undergo surgical resection.
* Portal vein embolization (PVE): delivery of embolic material into the portal vein feeding the lobe of liver containing the tumor(s) of interest to induce growth of the non-diseased lobe to maintain adequate liver function necessary to undergo surgical resection of lobe containing the tumor(s).

==== Diseases treated ====
Interventional oncology (IO) procedures are commonly applied to treat primary or metastatic cancer. IO treatments may be also offered in combination with surgery, systemic chemotherapy/immunotherapy, and radiation therapy to augment the therapeutic outcome. A variety of interventional oncological treatments for tumors arise:
* Liver cancer: primary liver tumors such as hepatocellular carcinoma or cholangiocarcinoma and liver metastases are often treated by procedures such as transarterial chemoembolization (TACE), Selective internal radiation therapy (SIRT/Y-90 radioembolization), portal vein embolization, transarterial/bland embolization, or image guided ablation (RFA, MWA, IRE, cryoablation)
* Lung cancer: lung metastases or inoperable primary lung cancer can be treated by interventional radiology procedures such as image guided ablation (cryoablation, microwave ablation and radiofrequency ablation).
* Kidney cancer: kidney tumors such as renal cell carcinoma can be treated with image-guided ablation (RFA, MWA, cryotherapy) with similar results to partial nephrectomy. Generally, surgery via an either partial or total nephrectomy (removal of kidney) is most often curative but for patients with a smaller lesion or who are not ideal surgical candidates, radiofrequency or cryoablation ablation can be a curative option. Advantages of cryoablation include the ability to visualize the ice ball as well as use more than one probe simultaneously to create the desired ice ball shape. Benign kidney tumors such as angiomyolipomas can be treated with transarterial embolization to shrink the tumor size and reduce the risk of rupture/bleeding. Other embolizations are also performed for symptom relief or prior to surgery to reduce bleeding.
* Bone cancer: bone metastases located in the spine, pelvis and long bones can be treated with image-guided ablative techniques (RFA, MWA, cryoablation, electrocorporation) with or without injection of cement (cementoplasty) to stabilize the bone. These treatments may be palliatively for bone metastases pain, or for some cases such as osteoid osteoma, can curatively treat tumors. Embolizations are also performed for prior to surgery to reduce bleeding.
* Breast cancer: for small, solitary breast cancer, image-guided ablative techniques are used to treat tumors; however, their efficacy versus surgical resection has not yet been studied.
* Prostate cancer: inoperable tumors can be treated with image-guided ablative techniques, and more recently, irreversible electroporation.
* Pancreatic cancer: inoperable, or borderline resectable, locally advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma can be treated with irreversible electroporation.

===Vascular disease===
Vascular disease refers to disorders of the vasculature or circulatory system, most commonly involving the arteries, veins and lymphatics. The symptoms related to vascular disease can range from asymptomatic, bothersome symptoms or limb- and/or life-threatening conditions.

Vascular and interventional radiologists are at the forefront of treating a wide variety of vascular diseases.

====Basics of vascular intervention====
Since its development by Charles Dotter when he did a percutaneous peripheral vascular revascularization procedure for the first time on January 16, 1964, on Laura Shaw, vascular and interventional radiology (commonly interventional radiology or IR) distinguished itself from earlier approaches to vascular disease by the use of medical imaging to guide endovascular therapies (fixing this from inside the vessel). The Seldinger technique is the basic principle that underlies endovascular procedures. Briefly, this involves using a needle to puncture a target vessel, then using a series of small medical guidewires and catheters to pass various tools inside for treatment. When these minimally-invasive techniques can be used, patients avoid the need for larger surgical exposure to treat diseased vessels. Though numerous factors can affect patient&#x27;s post-operative course, in general an endovascular approach is associated with a more rapid recovery time compared to a traditional open vascular surgery.

Many endovascular procedures have since been developed and refined. Numerous tools are at the disposal of modern vascular and interventional radiologists to perform these procedures, and developing new tools is a burgeoning focus of international research.

While some interventional radiology endovascular procedures are highly specialized, a few standard techniques apply to most:

# Angiography: Sometimes referred to as traditional angiography, catheter angiography or digital subtraction angiography (DSA). A small needle is inserted into a blood vessel, then exchanged for a catheter over a wire. The catheter is directed at the vessel to be studied, and contrast is directly injected to evaluate the lumen under video X-ray. This is an older technique than modern CT angiography or MR angiography, but provides unique advantages. With a catheter in place, provocative maneuvers can be performed such as breath holds or instillation of vasodilators, to evaluate a patient&#x27;s blood flow dynamically. This can reproduce symptoms and identify functional abnormalities in a vessel that a static CT or MR imaging cannot. Angiography provides the basis for all endovascular therapy.
# Balloon angiography: The foundational IR procedure. Small balloons can be inflated inside a narrowed vessel to open it. These can then be safely deflated and removed. Some balloons have a specialized surface material, such as fine razor blades (&quot;cutting balloons&quot;) to crack the plaque or instill a coating of medicine (&quot;drug-coated balloon&quot;) that keeps the vessel open longer.
# Stents and stent-grafts: Stents are used to provide a scaffold along a segment of diseased vessel. These are available in a variety of sizes to accommodate placement in vessels throughout the body from head to toe. Endografts are stents with fabric covering that are used for the treatment of bleeding or aneurysms. These devices typically come folded up very small on a scaffold, or delivery device, such as a balloon. Stents then expand into pipe-like cylinders to support a vessel wall and keep the pathway for blood flow as large as possible. Some stents are bare-metal, allowing blood to leak through the walls of the stent, while others have a thin covering that keeps flow moving through only from one open end to the other. These can be used for a variety of applications depending on the vessel and the nature of the disease. Sometimes multiple stents are deployed end-to-end or side by side to maintain laminar flow. Like balloons, some stents come coated with medicine to help prevent the treated vessel from closing again.
# Embolization: The goal of embolization is to decrease or stop flow only in a target vessel, while avoiding cutting off the flow to nearby non-target vessels. This can be performed to stop active bleeding (as in trauma) to limit anticipated blood loss (such as in a complex surgery), or to cut off blood supply to either an abnormal vessel (e.g. aneurysm) or abnormal structure (e.g. tumor). There are many embolic agents available, from metallic plugs and coils to various biologically compatible particles and glues. Depending on the clinical situation, embolization can be temporary or permanent.
# Thrombolysis and thrombectomy: The body forms blood clots as a natural protective mechanism against bleeding. However, when arising outside this context, blood clots can wreak havoc in the human body, including disabling strokes. Thrombolysis is the process of breaking down blood clots, by injecting them with powerful medications. Thrombectomy involves using a device to remove the clot directly.

The goal of endovascular therapy is to revascularize an affected or diseased vessel.

====Arterial disease====

Arteries are the component of the circulatory system that carry oxygenated blood away from the heart to the vital organs and extremities. Arteries have relatively thick, muscular walls, composed of multiple layers, because they transport freshly oxygenated blood through the body at relatively high pressures. Arterial diseases can affect one or multiple layers of the artery wall.

The aorta is the largest artery in the body, and the major aortic branches continue to divide multiple times, giving way to smaller arteries, muscular arterioles and thin-walled capillaries. In contrast to arteries, capillaries have thin single-layered walls, so oxygen and nutrients can be exchanged with tissues in capillary beds before the de-oxygenated blood is carried away by the venous system.

&quot;Perfusion&quot; refers to the flow of oxygen and nutrient rich blood into the capillary beds of the muscles and organs, this is critical for their function. The lack of adequate perfusion is referred to as ischemia and is typically the cause of symptoms related to vascular disease. The goal of revascularization therapies, whether endovascular or surgical, is to re-establish or optimize perfusion and stop ischemia.

&quot;Atherosclerosis&quot; refers to a progressive narrowing of the arteries due to atheroma, derived from the Greek word for &#x27;gruel, porridge&#x27;. Atheromatous plaque is a mixture of fat and inflammatory debris that sticks to the inner walls of an artery. Plaque can be soft or become firm as it accrues layers of calcium, a byproduct of chronic inflammation. Atherosclerosis has no single cause but many recognized risk factors. Some risk factors are modifiable, and others are not. Age and genetic predispositions are examples of non-modifiable risk factors. Medical management of atherosclerosis aims to address the many other known modifiable risk factors, such as smoking, diet, and exercise, as well as blood sugar levels in patients with diabetes. Using medications to control blood pressure and cholesterol have also been shown beneficial.

Atherosclerosis is described, evaluated, and treated differently depending on the affected artery, as described below. However, multiple studies have shown strong correlations between the different types of atherosclerosis. In particular, patients with peripheral arterial disease have an increased risk of coronary artery disease, and severe peripheral artery disease symptoms can be a predictor of cardiac-related mortality. The majority of patients begin to develop symptoms from ischemia around middle age, even though vessel narrowing can develop silently and slowly over decades. Unfortunately, sudden cardiac death or stroke can be a patient&#x27;s first sign of vascular disease. Therefore, controlling risk factors is crucial in those with known atherosclerosis to prevent progression of disease, and screening is recommended by some vascular disease specialists for those at increased risk, such as those with diabetes, smoking or a strong family history of cardiovascular disease.

Screening tests typically use the non-invasive evaluation called the ankle–brachial index, which compares the blood pressure between the arm and the ankle. This can help detect narrowing in the major vessels of the chest, abdomen, pelvis, and legs. CT scans of the heart with evaluations of coronary artery calcium are also used in some instances to stratify risk of coronary artery disease.

Historically, open vascular surgical approaches were required for all critically advanced atherosclerotic disease. An endarterectomy is a large operation, where blood flow is temporarily stopped using clamps, the vessel is cut open, the plaque removed and then the vessel resealed. If an occlusion is too dense or complex, a bypass could also be performed, where two segments of vessel are bridged by an additional vein or synthetic graft.
Modern endovascular approaches to treating atherosclerosis can include combinations of angioplasty, stenting, and atherectomy (removal of plaque).

# Peripheral artery disease (PAD; sometimes peripheral vascular disease, PVD) is most often a result of atherosclerosis and affects the arteries of the lower extremities, those below the aortic bifurcation. A hallmark symptom is claudication, or progressive pain in a limb associated with activity, due to ischemia. As the perfusion to a limb diminishes, further pain in the foot can occur even at rest and in fact the tissues of the foot can even die.

There are several systems for staging PAD, but an often used scale is the revised Rutherford classification. Plaque and blood flow can be evaluated using ultrasound, CT angiography, MR angiography, and catheter-based angiography to establish anatomic segments of disease. The severity of ischemia can be evaluated by correlating symptoms and non-invasive physiologic vascular studies including toe pressures, TCPO2, and skin perfusion studies.

Certain monitored exercises, such as walking regimens, have been shown to significantly improve walking distance especially when used consistently for at least six months. When medical management fails, vascular interventional radiologists can attempt to restore blood flow to extremities using angioplasty and stenting. Sometimes repeat interventions are required. The goal of therapy is to maintain perfusion, avoid amputation and preserve the limb structure and function.

# Critical limb ischemia (CLI) is a severe variant of PAD (Rutherford 4 and above) characterized by rest pain or tissue loss. Each year this affects just under 1% of the population, but develops in approximately 11% of PAD patients. Symptoms develop due to chronic ischemia from vessel plaque burden, which builds up over time. Rest pain is a continuous burning pain in the limb that is aggravated by elevating it and improved by dangling over the bed as the perfusion is so poor that it becomes gravity-dependent. Tissue loss refers to arterial insufficiency ulcers, which can progress to frank gangrene. Arterial ulcers are classically painful and located on the distal aspect of the extremities. A diagnosis of CLI incurs a higher risk of amputation (up to 25% within one year) and death (up to 25% within one year). This is a serious condition that requires multi-modality treatment. The goal of vascular interventional radiology and others who work in limb salvage is to minimize tissue loss by preserving direct blood flow to the affected limb by treating vessel blockages, controlling any infection and optimizing wound care. Increasingly, this can be accomplished with primary endovascular therapies before open surgery is considered.
# Acute limb ischaemia (ALI) occurs when blood flow to an extremity is abruptly cut off. It occurs most commonly in those with a history of atrial fibrillation or underlying PAD/PVD. Unlike chronic ischemia, which the body can partially adapt to, ALI is an emergency that can result in an amputation or even death if not treated in hours. It is typically due to an embolus from the heart or a thrombus that develops in a pre-existing area of narrowed artery. Once diagnosed clinically, CT or MR angiography may be used to evaluate the cause and extent of disease. Vascular interventional radiologists may use thrombectomy devices or clot dissolving medications to remove or dissolve the clot. Surgical options include open thrombectomy and even vascular bypass.
# Carotid atherosclerosis involves the major branch arteries that provide blood to the brain. Carotid artery disease incurs an increased risk of stroke by two different mechanisms, either from limiting overall blood flow or more often by showering pieces of plaque or clot deep into the small vessels in the brain. Either can result in degrees of cerebral ischemia. Carotid artery disease can be typically addressed with open surgical techniques (carotid endarterectomy) or though endovascular stenting.
# Chronic mesenteric ischemia can produce severe pain with eating and result in food fear and weight loss. These vascular disorders can be repaired by endovascular approaches using angioplasty and stenting.
# Renal arterial ischemia can contribute to hypertension, which can be severe and refractory to medical therapy.
# Coronary artery disease involves the arteries supplying blood to heart muscle. Coronary ischemia results in myocardial infarction, also known as a heart attack. The coronary arteries were one of the earliest widely accepted applications of angioplasty and stenting developed by cardiology and interventional radiology.
# Aortoiliac occlusive disease (Leriche syndrome) is a constellation of symptoms due to significant occlusion of the distal aorta and common iliac arteries, most commonly by atherosclerotic disease The classic symptoms include buttock claudication and erectile dysfunction, with decreased femoral pulses. Additional symptoms of critical limb ischemia can be present. Both surgical and endovascular approaches to revascularization can be considered.

&quot;Aneurysm&quot; refers to pathologic dilation of an artery to greater than 1.5 times its normal size. True vascular aneurysms are due to degenerative processes in the wall of the artery. Aneurysms can be solitary or multiple and are sometimes found in association with various clinical syndromes, including forms of vasculitis or connective tissue diseases. Aneurysms are typically classified by major shapes, either fusiform (tubular) or saccular (eccentric). &quot;Ectasia&quot; is another broad term for an enlarged vessel, but is not necessarily pathological. Rupture is a dreaded complication of aneurysms that can lead to extensive, difficult to control bleeding. Aneurysms can also clot, or thrombose, and rapidly occlude the involved vessel, leading to acute distal ischemia.

# Aortic aneurysms include thoracic, abdominal and thoracoabdominal aneurysms. Treatment strategies are customized depending on the location, size, rate of growth and extent of the aneurysm as well as the medical comorbidities of the patient. For example, an intact, small but slowly growing aneurysm may be safely monitored with serial imaging for months or years before elective repair is considered. Elective endovascular aortic grafting is now routinely attempted when possible. Endovascular aortic repair (EVAR) refers to treatment of an abdominal aortic aneurysm, while thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) is performed on the thoracic aorta. A ruptured aneurysm may be taken emergently for open, endovascular or combination repair.

A variety of endovascular grafts are available, and each has advantages and disadvantages depending on the characteristics of the aneurysm and patient.
# Aneurysms refers to aneurysms in the arms and legs. These can typically be evaluated and monitored with vascular ultrasound, CT angiography and MR angiography. Popliteal aneurysms are associated with distal embolization and are also associated with concurrent contralateral popliteal artery aneurysms and abdominal aortic aneurysms. When amenable, endovascular treatments for popliteal aneurysms can include endovascular stenting or surgical bypass.
# Visceral aneurysms affect the vessels that supply the solid organs. Similar to other aneurysms, treatment depends on several factors including size, location, shape and growth. Endovascular treatments for visceral aneurysms can usually be performed with less morbidity when compared to open surgical techniques.
# Intracranial aneurysms arise in the arterial supply of the brain. Endovascular approaches to treatment include stenting and coiling and are preferable in most cases since clipping and resection require a surgical craniotomy. Rupture of intracranial aneurysms can have devastating clinical effects. For further discussion, refer to the neuro-interventional radiology section.
# Pseudoaneurysm is when there is not all three layers surrounding the artery. These structures can technically be considered a type of contained bleed. They are most often due to focal damage to a blood vessel, which could be the result of trauma, infection or inflammation. Splenic artery pseudoaneurysms, for example, may develop as a result of pancreatitis. In some cases, pseudoaneurysms of the femoral and radial arterials can be a complication of arterial access for endovascular procedures. Depending on the size and location of the pseudoaneurysm, it may be treatable with minimally-invasive interventional radiology methods, though some, particularly the infected ones, may require open surgery.

Dissection refers to a tear in the inner layer of the arterial wall. Blood pumps into this defect and dissects its way between the layers in the wall of an artery, creating a false channel separate from the true arterial lumen. Dissections can develop due to trauma, spontaneously due to high blood pressure and native vascular disease, or in some cases as a complication of prior surgical or endovascular treatment.

When an arterial dissection expands, it can restrict normal flow through the affected artery or potentially block the origin of a branch vessel—this can compromise distal perfusion in either case. When acute and symptomatic, this is an emergency that requires prompt treatment.

However, as medical imaging has improved, chronic, asymptomatic dissections have also been discovered, and in some cases these may be safely managed with blood pressure control, follow-up imaging and proper counseling for the warning signs of potential ischemia.

Dissections can occur in any artery and are named for their vessel of origin. Aortic dissections can be further classified and treated depending on whether they involve the thoracic aorta, the abdominal aorta or both. Classic pain related to acute aortic dissections is described as &quot;tearing&quot; or &quot;ripping&quot; and possibly radiating to a patient&#x27;s back. Acute aortic dissection can be difficult to diagnose but is more common than aortic aneurysm rupture.

Thoracic aortic dissections are further characterized with the Stanford classification. Type A dissections involve the root and ascending aorta. These require prompt treatment, which currently is mostly surgical in nature. Type B dissections begin in the distal aortic arch beyond the left subclavian artery origin, and may often be addressed with pain medication and blood pressure control. If the type B aortic dissection results in poor circulation to the intestines, kidneys or legs it often requires urgent endovascular repair with endografts and/or fenestrations. If a type B aortic dissection has ruptured, or has features that indicate impending rupture, they are urgently repaired too.

Dissections can also arise in virtually any other artery. Carotid artery dissection, for example, places patients at increased risk for stroke and may extend further into the blood vessels within the brain. Vertebral artery dissection are less common but also dangerous for similar reasons. Mesenteric artery dissection may limit the blood supply to the intestines. Renal artery dissections can decrease blood flow to the kidneys and contribute to hypertension. Peripheral arterial dissections can be found elsewhere in the arms and legs. These dissections can occur primarily due to focal traumas, underlying vascular disease, or as an extension of a larger, complex aortic dissection that tears further into these smaller branches.

Treatment of dissections depends on several factors, including the location, extent, how long it has been developing (acute or chronic) and whether it is limiting perfusion. Surgical approaches to dissections can include reconstructing the aorta, surgical bypass and surgical fenestration. Like other arterial disorders, endovascular approaches to dissection such as stent-grafting and percutaneous fenestration can be utilized, either primarily or in combination with surgery depending on the complexity of the dissection.

Penetrating aortic ulcer (PAU) is an advanced focal form of atherosclerosis, most often encountered in the aorta. It starts as a small plaque in the inner-most layer of the aorta called the intima, but the inflammatory process ulcerates and penetrates through this layer into the media. While PAU is considered a distinct entity, many think this is a precursor lesion to dissection or aneurysm. Along with intramural hematoma, aneurysm and dissection, PAU is recognized as one of several acute aortic syndromes—a spectrum of related conditions correlated to potential aortic rupture. They thus have a high potential morbidity and mortality, and should at least be followed closely.

Acute or active bleeding can occur throughout the human body due to a variety of causes. Interventional radiologists can address bleeding with embolization, usually with small plastic particles, glues or coils. Traumatic rupture of a blood vessel, for example, may be addressed this way if a patient is at risk of fatal bleeding. This has revolutionized medicine and interventional radiologists commonly treat refractory nose bleeds, excessive coughing of blood, intestinal bleeding, post-pregnancy bleeding, spontaneous intra-abdominal on intra-thoracic bleeding, bleeding related to trauma and post-surgical bleeding. In some instances where severe bleeding is anticipated, such as in complex surgery or the excision of a highly vascular tumor, interventional radiologists may embolize certain target blood vessels prior to the operation to prevent major blood loss.

Transplant organs rely on healthy blood supply to survive. In some instances, the arteries that feed a transplant may narrow, typically where the donor vessel is sewn to the recipient. Interventional radiologists evaluate the blood supply of these patient&#x27;s and may use balloons or stents to open narrowed vessels and keep the transplant organ functional.

====Venous disease====

The veins of the human body are responsible for returning de-oxygenated blood back to the heart. Like a rock rolling down a hill, blood flows from the highest pressure (the blood in the aorta) to the lower venous pressure (the blood in the vena cava as it empties back to the heart.) Unlike arteries, veins are thin walled and distensible, allowing them to accommodate large volumes of blood without significant changes in pressure. In fact, the venous system is so low pressure that veins have valves to keep blood from flowing backward. The motion of the human body helps pump blood through the veins—squeezing leg muscles while walking, for instance, helps push venous blood back up to the heart against the pull of gravity. Unfortunately, without this extra push some blood can sit stagnant in veins, leading to a multitude of clinical problems. The largest vein in the body is the vena cava. The superior vena cava (SVC) drains blood from the top half of the body while the inferior vena cava (IVC) drains blood from below the diaphragm. Elsewhere in the body, veins can be categorized into superficial, primarily associated with the skin and soft tissues, or deep veins, which drain muscles and organs.

====Venous access====

Chronic kidney disease (CKD or chronic renal disease) is a condition in which there is a progressive loss of kidney function. It has numerous recognized causes and risk factors. CKD affects approximately 14% of the world population, and over 600,000 people in the United States alone. There are five recognized stages of CKD; the fifth stage is also called end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and invariably requires some form of renal replacement therapy.

Around the turn of the 20th century, breakthroughs in understanding of renal physiology led many to believe that dialysis using artificial kidneys was a potential cure for renal disease. Over 100 years later, the only available curative, renal replacement therapy for CKD is kidney transplantation. However, many patients can live for decades utilizing dialysis.

Dialyzer technology initially outpaced the ability of clinicians to apply it to patients. In the 1920s, the first dialysis catheter was created using thin fragile glass tubes. Early methods required surgical incision to reach large vessels, which carried a large risk of major bleeding. The first somewhat permanent, reliable dialysis access, the Scribner Teflon shunt, was invented nearly 40 years later and allowed a patient with kidney failure to survive 11 more years. As medicine and surgery have grown more sophisticated, more patients now live with chronic renal disease than ever before. The most common type of dialysis in the United States is hemodialysis, which can be performed through several types of vascular access. The arteriovenous fistula (AVF) is the preferred method. Arteriovenous fistula are created surgically by directly connecting an artery and a vein, most commonly in the arm. An arteriovenous graft (AVG) relies on the same principle but bridges the gap between the artery and vein with a medical-grade prosthetic shunt. Over time, altered flow mechanics can result in changes within the involved vessels. Vascular narrowing, thrombosis, aneurysms and pseudoaneurysms are commonly encountered complications over the life of an AVF or AVG. Interventional radiologists can use angiography to evaluate these structures (commonly called a istulogram) and treat dysfunctional access with angioplasty, stenting, and thrombectomy. Most patients require regular evaluation and treatment to keep their access working. When possible, AVFs are preferred to AVGs due to their relatively lower complication rate and longer patency. The Fistula First initiative works to promote physician and patient awareness about the benefits of first attempting hemodialysis through a fistula. There are a few devices (endo AVF) that are being utilized by interventional radiologists to percutaneously create fistulas in a minimally invasive fashion.

Dialysis catheters include temporary and tunneled large-bore central venous access lines placed for administering hemodialysis. When possible, these catheters are placed in the right internal jugular vein, but the left internal jugular and femoral veins may also be utilized. Temporary dialysis lines may be placed when patients are hospitalized and either too sick or at a high risk of bleeding. Permanent hemodialysis catheters are longer overall but a segment is tunneled through the skin of the chest, which lets the catheter lie flat and lowers the risk of infection.

Central venous access refers to a variety of intravenous catheters placed in patients requiring certain long-term medications. These are much smaller in diameter than dialysis lines, but are larger and longer than a standard intravenous line (IV.) Examples include Hickman catheters, peripherally inserted central cathethers (or PICCs), tunneled small bore central venous catheters, and mediports. These lines differ in where they are inserted but are all placed under imaging guidance and adjusted so the end of the catheter sits in the vena cava adjacent to the heart. These catheters are designed to deliver strong medications, such as chemotherapy or prolonged courses of antibiotics, which are either dosed too frequently to keep placing new IVs or are too irritating to small veins be injected through a standard IV.

<text>Bollocks () is a word of Middle English origin meaning &quot;testicles&quot;. The word is often used in British English and Irish English in a multitude of negative ways; it most commonly appears as a noun meaning &quot;rubbish&quot; or &quot;nonsense&quot;, an expletive following a minor accident or misfortune, or an adjective to describe something that is of poor quality or useless. It is also used in common phrases like &quot;bollocks to this&quot;, which is said when quitting a task or job that is too difficult or negative, and &quot;that&#x27;s a load of old bollocks&quot;, which generally indicates contempt for a certain subject or opinion. Conversely, the word also appears in positive phrases such as &quot;the dog&#x27;s bollocks&quot; or more simply &quot;the bollocks&quot;, which will refer to something which is admired or well-respected.

==Etymology==
The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; (OED) gives examples of its usage dating back to the 13th century. One of the early references is Wycliffe&#x27;s Bible (1382), Leviticus xxii, 24: &quot;Al beeste, that ... kitt and taken awey the &quot;ballokes&quot; is, ye shulen not offre to the Lord ...&quot; (any beast that is cut and taken away the &quot;bollocks&quot;, you shall not offer to the Lord, i.e. castrated animals are not suitable as sacrifices).

The &quot;OED&quot; states (with abbreviations expanded): &quot;Probably a derivative of Teutonic &quot;ball-&quot;, of which the Old English representative would be inferred as &quot;beall-u&quot;, &quot;-a&quot;, or &quot;-e&quot;&quot;. The Teutonic &quot;ball-&quot; in turn probably derives from the Proto-Indo-European base &quot;*bhel-&quot;, to inflate or swell. This base also forms the root of many other words, including &quot;phallus&quot;.

===Meaning &quot;nonsense&quot;===
From the 17th to the 19th century, &quot;bollocks&quot; or &quot;ballocks&quot; was allegedly used as a slang term for a clergyman, although this meaning is not mentioned by the &quot;OED&quot;″s 1989 edition. For example, in 1684, the Commanding Officer of the Straits Fleet regularly referred to his chaplain as &quot;Ballocks&quot;. It has been suggested that &quot;bollocks&quot; came to have its modern meaning of &quot;nonsense&quot; because some clergymen were notorious for talking nonsense during their sermons.

==Severity==
Originally, the word &quot;bollocks&quot; was the everyday vernacular word for testicles—as noted above, it was used in this sense in the first English-language Bible, in the 14th century. By the mid-17th century, at least, it had begun to acquire coarse figurative meanings (see ), for example in a translation of works by Rabelais.

It did not appear in Samuel Johnson&#x27;s 1755 dictionary of the English language. It was also omitted from the 1933 &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; and its 1941 reprint, finally appearing in the 1972 supplement. The first modern English dictionary to include an entry for &quot;bollocks&quot; was G. N. Garmonsway&#x27;s Penguin English Dictionary of 1965.

The relative severity of the various profanities, as perceived by the British public, was studied on behalf of the Broadcasting Standards Commission, Independent Television Commission, BBC and Advertising Standards Authority. The results of this jointly commissioned research were published in December 2000 in a paper called &quot;Delete Expletives?&quot;. This placed &quot;bollocks&quot; in eighth position in terms of its perceived severity, between &quot;prick&quot; (seventh place) and &quot;arsehole&quot; (ninth place). By comparison, the word &quot;balls&quot; (which has some similar meanings) was down in 22nd place. Of the people surveyed, 25% thought that &quot;bollocks&quot; should not be broadcast at all, and only 11% thought that it could acceptably be broadcast at times before the national 9 pm &quot;watershed&quot; on television (radio does not have a watershed). 25% of the people regarded &quot;bollocks&quot; as &quot;very severe&quot;, 32% &quot;quite severe&quot;, 34% &quot;mild&quot; and 8% considered it &quot;not swearing&quot;.

A survey of the language of London teenagers (published in 2002) examined, amongst other things, the incidence of various swearwords in their speech. It noted that the top ten swearwords make up 81% of the total swearwords. &quot;Bollocks&quot; was the seventh most frequent swearword, after &quot;fucking&quot;, &quot;shit&quot;, &quot;fuck&quot;, &quot;bloody&quot;, &quot;hell&quot; and &quot;fuck off&quot;. Below &quot;bollocks&quot; were &quot;bastard&quot;, &quot;bitch&quot; and &quot;damn&quot;, in eighth, ninth and tenth places. This research regarded these words as swearwords in the context of their usage but observed that some might be inoffensive in other contexts.

Some campaigners, particularly the Liberal Democrats, hoping to stop the UK&#x27;s departure from the European Union adopted the slogan, &quot;Bollocks to Brexit&quot;. When queried about the propriety of the use of this term in Parliament in January 2019, the Speaker of the House, John Bercow ruled that the use of the word in Parliamentary speech was &quot;not disorderly&quot;.

==Negative uses==
===&quot;Talking bollocks&quot; and &quot;bollockspeak&quot;===
&quot;Talking &quot;bollocks&quot;&quot; generally means talking nonsense or &quot;bullshit&quot;, for example: &quot;Don&#x27;t listen to him, he&#x27;s talking &quot;bollocks&quot;&quot;, or &quot;talking absolute &quot;bollocks&quot;&quot;. Another example is &quot;I told Maurice that he was talking bollocks, that he was full of shit and that his opinions were a pile of piss. (Rhetoric was always my indulgence.)&quot; &quot;Talking &quot;bollocks&quot;&quot; in a corporate context is referred to as &quot;bollockspeak&quot;. &quot;Bollockspeak&quot; tends to be buzzword-laden and largely content-free, like gobbledygook: &quot;Rupert, we&#x27;ll have to leverage our synergies to facilitate a paradigm shift by Q4&quot; is an example of management &quot;bollockspeak&quot;. There is a whole parodic book entitled &quot;The Little Book of Management Bollocks&quot;. When a great deal of bollocks is being spoken, it may be said that the &#x27;bollocks quotient&#x27; is high.

===A &quot;bollocks&quot; (singular noun)===
Comparable to &quot;cock-up&quot;, &quot;screw-up&quot;, &quot;balls-up&quot;, &quot;fuck-up&quot; etc. Used with the indefinite article, it means a disaster, a mess or a failure. It is often used pejoratively, as in to have &quot;made a &quot;bollocks&quot; out of it&quot;, and it is generally used throughout Britain and Ireland.

===Bollocks up (transitive verb)===
&quot;To bollocks something up&quot; means &quot;to mess something up&quot;. It refers to a botched job: &quot;Well, you &quot;bollocksed&quot; it up that time, Your Majesty!&quot; or &quot;&quot;Bollocksed&quot; up at work again, I fear. Millions down the drain&quot;.

===To &quot;drop a bollock&quot;===
&quot;To &quot;drop a bollock&quot;&quot; describes the malfunction of an operation, or messing something up, as in many sports, and in more polite business parlance, &quot;dropping the ball&quot; brings play to an unscheduled halt.

===Bollocking===
====Noun====
A &quot;bollocking&quot; usually denotes a robust verbal chastisement for something which one has done (or not done, as the case may be), for instance: &quot;I didn&#x27;t do my homework and got a right &quot;bollocking&quot; off Mr Smith&quot;, or &quot;A nurse was assisting at an appendix operation when she shouldn&#x27;t have been ... and the surgeon got a &quot;bollocking&quot;&quot;. Actively, one &quot;gives&quot; or &quot;delivers&quot; a bollocking to someone; in the building trade one can &#x27;throw a right bollocking into&#x27; someone.

The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; gives the earliest meaning as &quot;to slander or defame&quot; and suggests that it entered the English language from the 1653 translation of one of Rabelais&#x27; works, which includes the Middle French expression &quot;en couilletant&quot;, translated as &quot;ballocking&quot;. The earliest printed use in the sense of a severe reprimand is, according to the OED, from 1946.

====Adjective====
&quot;Bollocking&quot; can also be used as a reinforcing adjective: &quot;He hasn&#x27;t a &quot;bollocking&quot; clue!&quot; or &quot;Where&#x27;s me &quot;bollocking&quot; car?&quot;

===&quot;A kick in the bollocks&quot;===
&quot;A kick in the bollocks&quot; is used to describe a significant setback or disappointment, e.g. &quot;I was diagnosed with having skin cancer. Ye Gods! What a kick in the bollocks&quot;.

===&quot;Freeze (or work) one&#x27;s bollocks off&quot;===
To freeze one&#x27;s bollocks off means to be very cold. To &quot;work one&#x27;s bollocks off&quot; is to work very hard. This phrase is also sometimes used by or about women: Boy George referred to his mother &quot;working her bollocks off&quot; at home.

===&quot;Bollock naked&quot;===
&quot;Bollock naked&quot; is used in the singular form to emphasise being completely nude: &quot;he was completely pissed and stark &quot;bollock naked&quot;&quot;.

===Bollocks (singular noun)===
In Ireland, &quot;bollocks&quot;, &quot;ballocks&quot; or &quot;bollox&quot; can be used as a singular noun to mean a despicable or notorious person, for instance: &quot;Who&#x27;s the old &quot;ballocks&quot; you were talking to?&quot;

===&quot;Bollocksed&quot;===
Multiple meanings, also spelled &quot;&quot;bolloxed&quot; or &quot;bollixed&quot;&quot;:
# Exhausted: &quot;I couldn&#x27;t sleep at all last night, I&#x27;m completely &quot;bollocksed&quot;!&quot;
# Broken: &quot;My foot pump is &quot;bollocksed&quot;.&quot;
# An extreme state of inebriation or drug-induced stupor: &quot;Last night I got completely &quot;bollocksed&quot;&quot;.
# Hungover (or equivalent): &quot;I drank two bottles of gin last night, I&#x27;m completely &quot;bollocksed&quot;.&quot;
# Made a mistake: &quot;I tried to draw that landscape, but I &quot;bollocksed&quot; it up.&quot;

The phrase &quot;bollocksed up&quot; means to be in a botched, bungled, confused or disarrayed state; e.g. &quot;He managed to bollix up the whole project.&quot; In the printing and newspaper industries, dropping a California Job type case of moveable type spilling the contents was a classic example of &quot;bollocksing up the works&quot;. The box was called &quot;pied&quot;. &quot;Bollocksed&quot; in that sense meant &quot;beyond all repair&quot;.

==Positive uses==
===&quot;Dog&#x27;s bollocks&quot;===
A usage with a positive (albeit still vulgar) sense is &quot;the dog&#x27;s bollocks&quot; or simplified &quot;The Bollocks&quot;. An example of this usage is: &quot;Before Tony Blair&#x27;s speech, a chap near me growled: &#x27;He thinks he&#x27;s the &#x27;dog&#x27;s bollocks&#x27;. Well, he&#x27;s entitled to. It was a commanding speech: a real &#x27;dog&#x27;s bollocks&#x27; of an oration.&quot;

Although this is a recent term (the &quot;Online Etymology Dictionary&quot; dates it to 1989,) its origins are obscure. Etymologist Eric Partridge and the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; believe the term comes from the now obsolete typographical sequence of a colon and a dash :-. This typography, using a dash following a colon -:, was used to introduce a list. Thus, it is a very early example of an emoticon.

The Oxford English Dictionary says the following mark (&quot;:— &quot;) is entitled &quot;the dog’s bollocks&quot;, defined as: &quot;typogr. a colon followed by a dash, regarded as forming a shape resembling the male sexual organs.&quot; The usage is cited to the year 1949.

This phrase has found its way into popular culture in a number of ways. There is a beer brewed in England by the Wychwood Brewery called the Dog&#x27;s Bollocks, as well as a lager cocktail.

The Dutch city Groningen has a pub-style café named &quot;The dog&#x27;s bollocks&quot;.

===&quot;Chuffed to one&#x27;s bollocks&quot;===
The phrase &quot;chuffed to one&#x27;s bollocks&quot; describes someone who is very pleased with themselves. Nobel laureate Harold Pinter used this in &quot;The Homecoming&quot;. The phrase provided a serious challenge to translators of his work. Pinter used a similar phrase in an open letter, published in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, and addressed to Prime Minister Tony Blair, attacking his co-operation with American foreign policy. The letter ends by saying &quot;Oh, by the way, meant to mention, forgot to tell you, we were all &quot;chuffed to the bollocks&quot; when Labour won the election.&quot;

==Other uses==
* &quot;Bollock-head&quot; is a vulgar British term for a shaven head. It can also refer to someone who is stupid, as can &quot;bollock-brain&quot;. &quot;The Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue&quot; (1811) cites the expression &quot;His brains are in his &quot;ballocks&quot;&quot;, to designate a fool.

===Bollards===
The 2007 &quot;Concise new Partridge dictionary of slang and unconventional English&quot; quotes &quot;bollards&quot; as meaning &quot;testicles&quot; and that it is a play on the word bollocks.

==Literature==
The play &quot;Sodom, or the Quintessence of Debauchery&quot;, published in 1684 and ascribed to John Wilmot, 2nd Earl of Rochester, includes a character named Bolloxinion, King of Sodom (along with other characters with names such as General Buggeranthos and the maid of honour, Fuckadilla). The word &quot;bollox&quot; appears several times in the text, such as:

In 1690, the publisher Benjamin Crayle was fined 20 pounds and sent to prison for his part in publishing the play.

In one of the tales in Burton&#x27;s 1885 translation of &quot;The Book of the Thousand Nights and a Night&quot;, Kafur, the eunuch, says:
==Obscenity court ruling==
Perhaps the best-known use of the term is in the title of the 1977 punk rock album &quot;Never Mind the Bollocks, Here&#x27;s the Sex Pistols&quot;. Testimony in a resulting prosecution over the term demonstrated that in Old English, the word referred to a priest, and could also be used to mean &quot;nonsense&quot;. Defence barrister John Mortimer QC and Virgin Records won the case: the court ruled that the word was not obscene. It just means &quot;put aside all of that other rubbish and pay attention to this&quot;. In a summary for the defence, Mortimer asked,

Tony Wright, a Leicestershire trader, was given an £80 fixed penalty fine by police for selling T-shirts bearing the slogan &quot;Bollocks to Blair&quot;. This took place on 29 June 2006 at the Royal Norfolk Show; the police issued the penalty notice, quoting Section 5 of the Public Order Act 1986 which refers to language &quot;deemed to cause harassment, alarm or distress&quot;.

<text>Jean Paul Gustave Ricœur (; ; 27 February 1913 – 20 May 2005) was a French philosopher best known for combining phenomenological description with hermeneutics. As such, his thought is within the same tradition as other major hermeneutic phenomenologists, Martin Heidegger, Hans-Georg Gadamer, and Gabriel Marcel. In 2000, he was awarded the Kyoto Prize in Arts and Philosophy for having &quot;revolutionized the methods of hermeneutic phenomenology, expanding the study of textual interpretation to include the broad yet concrete domains of mythology, biblical exegesis, psychoanalysis, theory of metaphor, and narrative theory.&quot;

==Life==
===1913–1945: Birth to war years===
Paul Ricœur was born in 1913 in Valence, Drôme, France, to Léon &quot;Jules&quot; Ricœur (23 December 1881 – 26 September 1915) and Florentine Favre (17 September 1878 – 3 October 1913), who were married on 30 December 1910 in Lyon. He came from a family of devout Huguenots (French Reformed Protestants), a religious minority in France.
Paul&#x27;s father Jules, who served as a sergeant in the 75th Infantry Regiment of the French army during World War I, went missing in Perthes-lès-Hurlus near the beginning of the Second Battle of Champagne (25 September – 6 November 1915). On 26 September 1915, French military authorities declared that Jules had probably been killed in the battle. His body was not found until 1932, when a field was being ploughed, and the body was identified by its tags. Some writers have stated that before World War I began, Paul&#x27;s father (Léon &quot;Jules&quot; Ricœur) was a professor of English at the Lycée Emile Loubet in Valence. However, it was a different person (Jules Paul Ricœur (1887–1918)) who held that position. Paul&#x27;s father&#x27;s death occurred when Paul was only two years old. Subsequently, Paul was raised in Rennes, France by his paternal grandparents Louis Ricœur (1856–1932) and his wife Marie Sarradet (1856–1928), and by his father&#x27;s sister Juliette &quot;Adèle&quot; Ricœur (20 December 1892 – 1968), with a small stipend afforded to Paul as a war orphan.

Paul, whose penchant for study was fueled by his family&#x27;s Protestant emphasis on Bible study, was bookish and intellectually precocious. He discovered philosophy while attending the Lycée de Rennes (now ), where he studied under Roland Dalbiez (1893–1976), who was professor of philosophy at the lycée. Ricœur received his bachelor&#x27;s degree in 1932 from the University of Rennes and began studying philosophy, and especially phenomenology, at the Sorbonne in 1933–34, where he was influenced by Gabriel Marcel. When Ricoeur was in Paris, he attended the Friday gatherings held by this philosopher who introduced him to Edmund Husserl. During those &quot;meetings&quot; students, professors, intellectuals would gather for several hours of lively discussion. Among them there were: Merleau-Ponty, Emmanuel Levinas, Luigi Pareyson, Nikolai Berdyaev, Paul-Louis Landsberg, and Sartre. Ricoeur also joined the &quot;Esprit&quot; magazine, which had been founded in 1932 by Emmanuel Mounier.

In 1934 he completed a DES thesis (&quot;&quot;, roughly equivalent to an M.A. thesis) titled &quot;Problème de Dieu chez Lachelier et Lagneau&quot; (&quot;The Problem of God in Lachelier and Lagneau&quot;), concerning some of the theological views of French philosophers Jules Lachelier (1832–1918) and Jules Lagneau (1851–1894). In 1935, Paul was awarded the second-highest agrégation mark in the nation for philosophy, presaging a bright future.

On 14 August 1935, in Rennes, Paul married Simone Lejas (23 October 1911 – 7 January 1998), with whom he had five children: Jean-Paul (born 15 January 1937), Marc (born 22 February 1938), Noëlle (born 30 November 1940), Olivier (10 July 1947 – 22 March 1986), and Étienne (born 1953). In 1936–37, he fulfilled his military service.

World War II interrupted Ricœur&#x27;s career, and he was drafted to serve in the French army in 1939. His unit was captured during the German invasion of France in 1940 and he spent the next five years as a prisoner of war in Oflag II-D. His detention camp was filled with other intellectuals such as Mikel Dufrenne, who organized readings and classes sufficiently rigorous that the camp was accredited as a degree-granting institution by the Vichy government. During that time he read Karl Jaspers, who was to have a great influence on him. He also began a translation of Edmund Husserl&#x27;s &quot;Ideas I&quot;.

===1946–2005: Strasbourg University to death===
Ricœur taught at the University of Strasbourg between 1948 and 1956, the only French university with a Protestant faculty of theology. In 1950, he received his State doctorate, submitting (as is customary in France) two theses: a &quot;minor&quot; thesis translating Husserl&#x27;s &quot;Ideas I&quot; into French for the first time, with commentary, and a &quot;major&quot; thesis that he published the same year as &quot;Philosophie de la Volonté I: Le Volontaire et l&#x27;Involontaire&quot; (&quot;Philosophy of the Will I: The Voluntary and the Involuntary&quot;). Ricœur soon acquired a reputation as an expert on phenomenology, then the ascendent philosophy in France.

In 1956, Ricœur took up a position at the Sorbonne as the Chair of General Philosophy. This appointment signaled Ricœur&#x27;s emergence as one of France&#x27;s most prominent philosophers. While at the Sorbonne, he wrote three works that cemented his reputation: &quot;Fallible Man&quot; and &quot;The Symbolism of Evil&quot; published in 1960, and &quot;Freud and Philosophy: An Essay on Interpretation&quot; published in 1965. Jacques Derrida was an assistant to Ricœur during that time (early 1960s).

From 1965 to 1970, Ricœur was an administrator at the newly founded University of Nanterre in suburban Paris. Nanterre was intended as an experiment in progressive education, and Ricœur hoped that he could create a university in accordance with his vision, free of the stifling atmosphere of the tradition-bound Sorbonne and its overcrowded classes. Nevertheless, Nanterre became a hotbed of protest during the student uprisings of May 1968 in France. Ricœur was derided as an &quot;old clown&quot; (&quot;vieux clown&quot;) and tool of the French government.

Disenchanted with French academic life, Ricœur taught briefly at the Université catholique de Louvain in Belgium, before taking a position at the Divinity School of the University of Chicago, where he taught from 1970 to 1985. He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1971. His study culminated in &quot;The Rule of Metaphor: Multi-Disciplinary Studies of the Creation of Meaning in Language&quot; published in 1975 and the three-volume &quot;Time and Narrative&quot; published in 1983, 1984, 1985 Ricœur gave the Gifford Lectures in 1985/86, published in 1990 as &quot;Oneself as Another&quot;. This work built on his discussion of narrative identity and his continuing interest in the self.

&quot;Time and Narrative&quot; secured Ricœur&#x27;s return to France in 1985 as a notable intellectual. His late work was characterised by a continuing cross-cutting of national intellectual traditions; for example, some of his latest writing engaged the thought of the American political philosopher John Rawls. In 1995 he received an honorary doctorate from the National University of Kyiv-Mohyla Academy.

In 1999, he was awarded the Balzan Prize for Philosophy, the citation being &quot;[f]or his capacity in bringing together all the most important themes and indications of 20th-century philosophy, and re-elaborating them into an original synthesis which turns language – in particular, that which is poetic and metaphoric – into a chosen place revealing a reality that we cannot manipulate, but interpret in diverse ways, and yet all coherent. Through the use of metaphor, language draws upon that truth which makes of us that what we are, deep in the profundity of our own essence&quot;. That same year, he and his co-author André LaCocque (professor emeritus of Hebrew Bible at Chicago Theological Seminary) were awarded the Gordon J. Laing Award by the University of Chicago&#x27;s Board of University Publications for their book &quot;Thinking Biblically: Exegetical and Hermeneutical Studies&quot;.

On 29 November 2004, he was awarded with the second John W. Kluge Prize for Lifetime Achievement in the Human Sciences (shared with Jaroslav Pelikan).

Ricœur died on 20 May 2005, aged 92, at his home in Châtenay-Malabry, France, of natural causes. French Prime Minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin declared that &quot;the humanist European tradition is in mourning for one of its most talented exponents&quot;. Paul Ricœur was buried in the Châtenay-Malabry New Cemetery, Châtenay-Malabry, Department des Hauts-de-Seine, Île-de-France, France.

==Thought==

===Hermeneutic phenomenology===
One of Ricœur&#x27;s major contributions to the field of hermeneutics was the entwining of hermeneutical processes with phenomenology. In this union, Ricœur applies the hermeneutical task to more than just textual analysis, but also to how each self relates to anything that is outside of the self. For Ricœur, hermeneutics is understanding the link between the self and the symbol—neither things in themselves, but the dialectical engagement between the two. Moreover, Ricœur, on the goal of hermeneutics, puts emphasis upon self-understanding as the outcome of the hermeneutical process: &quot;In proposing to relate symbolic language to self-understanding, I think I fulfill the deepest wish of hermeneutics. The purpose of all interpretation is to conquer a remoteness, a distance between the past cultural epoch to which the text belongs and the interpreter himself. By overcoming this distance, by making himself contemporary with the text, the exegete can appropriate its meaning to himself: foreign, he makes it familiar, that is, he makes it his own. It is thus the growth of his own understanding of himself that he pursues through his understanding of others. Every hermeneutics is thus, explicitly or implicitly, self-understanding by means of understanding others.&quot;Ricoeur maintains that the hermeneutical task is a coming together of the self and an other, in a meaningful way. This explication of self-meaning and other-meaning is principally bound up and manifested in existence itself. Thus, Ricoeur depicts philosophy as a hermeneutical activity seeking to uncover the meaning of existence through the interpretation of phenomena (which can only emerge as) embedded in the world of culture: &quot;This is why philosophy remains a hermeneutics, that is, a reading of the hidden meaning inside the text of the apparent meaning. It is the task of this hermeneutics to show that existence arrives at expression, at meaning, and at reflection only through the continual exegesis of all the significations that come to light in the world of culture. Existence becomes a self – human and adult – only by appropriating this meaning, which first resides &quot;outside,&quot; in works, institutions, and cultural movements in which the life of the spirit is justified.&quot;Furthermore, the process of hermeneutics, and extracting meaning, is a reflective task. The emphasis is not on the external meaning, but the meaning or insight of the self which is gained through encountering the external text—or other. The self-knowledge gained through the hermeneutical process is, thus, indirectly attained. This is in opposition to the Cartesian cogito, &quot;which grasps itself directly in the experience of doubt,&quot; and is &quot;a truth as vain as it is invincible.&quot; In point of fact, the difference Ricœur aims to distinguish is the means by which the self is discovered, which for him is only by means of interpreting the signified.

According to Ricœur, the aim of hermeneutics is to recover and to restore the meaning. The French philosopher chooses the model of the phenomenology of religion, in relation to psychoanalysis, stressing that it is characterized by a concern on the object. This object is the sacred, which is seen in relation to the profane.

Ricœur&#x27;s hermeneutical work &quot;Freud and Philosophy&quot; contains the famous assertion that Karl Marx, Friedrich Nietzsche and Sigmund Freud are masters of the school of suspicion (&quot;maîtres du soupçon&quot;/&quot;école du soupçon&quot;). Ricœur&#x27;s theory has been particularly influential to postcritique, a scholarly movement in literary criticism and cultural studies that seeks for new forms of reading and interpretation that go beyond the methods of critique, critical theory, and ideological criticism. The literary critic Rita Felski, for instance, argues that he is a crucial figure in the history of this tradition. She claims that his influential analysis of the &quot;hermeneutics of suspicion&quot; &quot;invites us to think about how we read and to what end.&quot;

===Philosophy of language===
In &quot;The Rule of Metaphor&quot; and in &quot;Time and Narrative&quot;, vol. 1, Ricœur argues that there exists a linguistic productive imagination that generates/regenerates meaning through the power of metaphoricity by way of stating things in novel ways and, as a consequence, he sees language as containing within itself resources that allow it to be used creatively.

<doc id="457625" wikidata="Q109920" url="?curid=457625" title="Jotham">
<text>Jotham or Yotam (; ; ) was the eleventh king of Judah, and son of Uzziah and Jerusha, daughter of Zadok. Jotham was 25 years old when he began his reign, and he reigned for 16 years. Edwin R. Thiele concluded that his reign commenced as a coregency with his father, which lasted for 11 years. Because his father Uzziah was afflicted with tzaraath after he went into the Temple to burn incense, Jotham became governor of the palace and the land at that time, i.e. coregent, while his father lived in a separate house as a leper.

William F. Albright dated his reign to 742–735 BCE. Thiele dated his coregency with Uzziah starting in 751/750 BCE and his sole reign from 740/39 to 736/735 BCE, at which time he was deposed by the pro-Assyrian faction in favor of his son Ahaz. Thiele places his death in 732/731 BCE.

The Gospel of Matthew lists Jotham of Judah in the genealogy of Jesus. The archeologist Nelson Glueck found an imprint of king Jotham near Eilat. Also near Eilat there is a wadi called &quot;Yatam wadi&quot;.

==Reign==
Jotham inherited a strong government, well-officered and administered. He is recorded as having built the High or Upper Gate of the Temple in Jerusalem, identified by Matthew Poole as the New Gate mentioned in Jeremiah 36:10. &quot;He built cities in the mountains of Judah, and in the forests he built castles and towers.&quot;

2 Kings 15 mentions that Jotham fought wars against Rezin, king of the Arameans, and Pekah, king of Northern Israel (). He also defeated Ammon, which paid him an immense annual tribute. However, the corruption of Northern Israel began to permeate Judah.

Jotham was a contemporary with the prophets Isaiah, Hosea, Amos, and Micah, from whose advice he benefited. He inherited a strong government, well officered and administered. He himself is said to have built the upper gate of the house of Yhwh and to have avoided the rashnesswhich allowed his father to enter the Temple (II Chron. xxvii. 2). &quot;He built cities in the mountains of Judah, and in the forests he built castles and towers.&quot; He also defeated the Ammonites, who paid him an immense annual tribute. His might is attributed by the Chronicler (ib. xxvii. 6) to his having &quot;ordered his ways before Yhwh, his God.&quot;But the increasing corruption of the Northern Kingdom began to permeate Judah, as is seen in the words of Isaiah and Micah. Hosea&#x27;s references to Judah indicate also a lack of purity of life and worship under Jotham&#x27;s reign.

==Chronological issues==

Biblical chronologies for the two Israelite kingdoms in the 8th century BC are both profuse and perplexing. Some of the reign lengths or synchronisms are given from the start of a sole reign, while others are given from the start of a coregency, or, in the case of Pekah, from the start of a rival reign. Thiele maintained that the key to understanding these records lies in a proper appreciation of the growing threat from Assyria that both kingdoms faced. In 754 BC, Ashur-nirari V led the Assyrians against Arpad in northern Aram. His successor Tiglath-Pileser III warred against Arpad in the years 743 to 740 BC, capturing the city after three years. In face of this threat, Rezin of Damascus made an alliance with Pekah of Israel, and the two were therefore enemies of the pro-Assyrian king of Judah, Ahaz (). Meanwhile, Menahem, ruling in Samaria, sent tribute to Tiglath-Pileser (Biblical Pul) to &quot;strengthen his hold on the kingdom,&quot; (2 Kings 15:19), apparently against his anti-Assyrian rival Pekah. According to Thiele, it is the existence of strong pro-Assyrian and anti-Assyrian factions in both Israel and Judah that explains the way the chronological data for the time were recorded:

In Judah, the growing Assyrian pressure strengthened the hand of those who sought accommodation to the enemy from the north, resulting in a change of leadership:

Thiele therefore explained the reason for the complexity of the chronological data for this time by taking into account the historical background. He then found that the regnal years for Judah and Israel that can be constructed from the Biblical texts fit into the known movements of the Assyrian kings during this time.

==Further chronological notes==
The calendars for reckoning the years of kings in Judah and Israel were offset by six months, that of Judah starting in Tishri (in the fall) and that of Israel in Nisan (in the spring). Cross-synchronizations between the two kingdoms therefore often allow narrowing of the beginning and/or ending dates of a king to within a six-month range. For Jotham, the Scriptural data allow the narrowing of the beginning of his coregency with Uzziah as occurring some time in the six-month interval on or following Nisan 1, 750 BCE. In terms of Judean reckoning, this would be in the year that started in Tishri of 751 BCE. His sole reign began in the year that started on Tishri 1, 740 BCE, and its end was in the six-month interval that started on Nisan 1, 735 BCE. His death occurred in the year that started in Tishri, 732 BCE.


==Archeological findings==

In the mid-1990s, an inscribed bulla seal belonging to Jotham&#x27;s son, Ahaz, showed up on the antiquities market. The inscription read, “Belonging to Ahaz (son of) &quot;Yehotam&quot;, King of Judah”. As the seal was unprovenanced, its authenticity is not universally agreed upon, though given the process which make and preserve bullae, it is generally agreed that faking a seal, while not impossible, is difficult. If genuine, it is perhaps the sole archaeological attestation of Jotham found to date.

<text>Lloyd Norton Cutler (November 10, 1917 – May 8, 2005) was an American attorney who served as White House Counsel during the Democratic administrations of Presidents Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton.

==Early life and education==
Cutler was born in New York City. His father was a trial lawyer. He graduated from Yale University in 1936 at age 18, with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in history and economics. In college, he was a member of Elihu. Three years later, he graduated &quot;magna cum laude&quot; from Yale Law School, where he was editor-in-chief of the &quot;Yale Law Journal&quot;.

==Career==
Following his graduation, he clerked for Judge Charles Edward Clark for a year before entering private practice at Cravath, Swaine &amp; Moore.

During World War II, he worked briefly for the Lend-Lease Administration, later enlisting in the U.S. Army and becoming an intelligence analyst. In 1946, he co-founded the Washington, D.C., based law firm Wilmer Cutler &amp; Pickering, specializing in international law and public policy. He also co-chaired the Lawyers&#x27; Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, formed at the request of President John F. Kennedy.

==White House==
Cutler served as the White House Counsel to President Jimmy Carter, whom he had met first while both were serving on the Trilateral Commission. Cutler served as a special counsel and consultant to the president on the ratification of SALT II and other international matters.

In 1994, President Bill Clinton was looking for a new lawyer, as Bernard Nussbaum had resigned, so Clinton decided to hire Cutler under unusual terms. Cutler was able to remain as counsel at his firm and to counsel private clients as long as their interests did not conflict with those of the government—a first for a White House Counsel. Thus, he also served as counsel in Clinton&#x27;s administration.

Cutler came into national news as a result of the Whitewater investigations and Lewinsky scandal. He went on PBS&#x27;s News Hour on February 6, 1998, and defended President Clinton as the Lewinsky investigation started by denying that Lewinsky had visited 37 times.

On his work in Washington, Cutler said, &quot;This is an excitement to us, a feeling of being in on it, and whichever part of the Washington milieu we come from, we want to play a part. That&#x27;s why we&#x27;re here.&quot;

==Intelligence Commission==
On February 6, 2004, Cutler was appointed to the Iraq Intelligence Commission, an independent panel tasked with investigating U.S. intelligence surrounding the 2003 invasion of Iraq and the allegations that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction.

==Death and personal life==
Cutler was married to Louise M. Howe until her death in 1989. Cutler married Polly Kraft in 1990, widow of Joseph Kraft, who was a columnist.

On May 8, 2005, he died at his home in Washington, D.C., due to complications of a broken hip. He was survived by his wife, Polly Kraft, and four children. Two of his children are practicing lawyers and one, Beverly Cutler, is a retired Alaska state superior court judge. He lived in Chevy Chase, Maryland.

<text>Patricia Ann McGowan Wald (; September 16, 1928 – January 12, 2019) was an American lawyer and jurist who served as the chief judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit from 1986 until 1991. She was the Court&#x27;s first female chief judge and its first woman to be elevated, having been appointed by President Jimmy Carter in 1979. From 1999 to 2001, Wald was a Justice of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia.

Wald was born in Torrington, Connecticut, to a working-class family. After graduating from Connecticut College with distinction, a scholarship enabled her to study at Yale Law School, where she became one of two female editors of the &quot;Yale Law Journal&quot;. Wald sought a position at a white-shoe firm upon graduation but was turned down for being a woman. She began her legal career as a law clerk to Judge Jerome Frank instead, later entering the law firm of Arnold, Fortas &amp; Porter as an associate attorney. After spending a year at the U.S. Department of Justice, Wald&#x27;s tenure as a practicing lawyer included appointments on various presidential commissions and committees.

In 1977, President Jimmy Carter appointed Wald as a U.S. Assistant Attorney General for the Office of Legislative Affairs. In 1979, Carter elevated her to the D.C. Circuit, where she received her commission as its first female member. During her time on the Court, Wald would pen more than 800 judicial opinions.

==Early life==
Wald was born on September 16, 1928, in Torrington, Connecticut. She was the only child of Joseph F. McGowan, an alcoholic, and Margaret O&#x27;Keefe. Her father left the family when she was two years old, leaving Wald to be raised by her mother with the company and support of extended relatives, most of whom were factory workers in Torrington and active union members. Wald had a Roman Catholic upbringing, and worked in brass mills as a teenager during the summers. Due to her involvement in the labor movement and union work, she was determined to go to law school to help protect underprivileged, working-class people.

=== Education ===
Wald attended Torrington&#x27;s St. Francis School and graduated in 1940. She then went on to graduate from Torrington High School in 1944 as the class valedictorian. She graduated first in her class and joined the Phi Beta Kappa society at Connecticut College in 1948. She was able to attend the college because of a scholarship that she received from an elderly affluent woman from her hometown. She then received a national fellowship from the Pepsi-Cola Company that allowed her to earn her law degree from Yale Law School in 1951. She graduated with only 11 other women that year out of a class of 200. Along with the national fellowship, Wald also paid for law school by working as a waitress and taking research jobs with professors. At Yale, she was an editor on the &quot;Yale Law Journal&quot;, one of the two women in her class to be one.

After her graduation, she clerked for Judge Jerome Frank of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit for a year. That year, Frank ruled on the appeal of the espionage convictions of Ethel and Julius Rosenberg. She briefly entered private practice at the law firm of Arnold, Fortas &amp; Porter for a year before she left to raise her five children.

==Professional career==
It would be six years before she would take on part-time consulting and researching positions. She was a research and editorial assistant for Frederick M. Rowe, Esq. for three years from 1959 to 1962. She took a year off and then in 1963 spent a year as a member of the National Conference on Bail and Criminal Justice. Wald then worked as a consultant for the National Conference on Law &amp; Poverty in its Office of Economic Opportunity. In 1964, she co-authored the book &quot;Bail in the United States&quot;, which helped reform the nation&#x27;s bail system. She then was appointed to the President&#x27;s Commission on Crime in the District of Columbia from 1965 to 1966 by President Lyndon B. Johnson. She continued her consulting work for the President&#x27;s Commission on Law Enforcement &amp; Administration of Criminal Justice for a year.

Wald then joined the United States Department of Justice in 1967 and spent a year as an attorney in the Office of Criminal Justice. From 1968 to 1970, she was an attorney at Neighborhood Legal Services in Washington, D.C. During her tenure at Neighborhood Legal Services Program she was also a consultant for both the National Advisory Committee on Civil Disorder and the National Commission on the Causes and Prevention of Violence. She also co-directed the Ford Foundation&#x27;s Drug Abuse Research Project during 1970. She then became an attorney at the Center for Law and Social Policy from 1971 to 1972 and from there switched to work as an attorney at the Mental Health Law Project for five years. During that time, she was also the director of the Office of Policy and Issues in the vice presidential campaign of Sargent Shriver. Wald then went back to the Department of Justice from 1977 to 1979. She became a founding member of the National Association of Women Judges in 1979. A Democrat, she served as Assistant Attorney General for Legislative Affairs during much of the Carter administration before being nominated by Carter to the DC Circuit.

==D.C. Circuit==
Wald was nominated by President Jimmy Carter on April 30, 1979, to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, to a new seat created by 92 Stat. 1629. The Carter administration created a set of guidelines to be used by the United States Circuit Judge Nominating Commission that was geared to be friendlier towards women in an effort to increase the number of female federal judges. She was confirmed by the United States Senate on July 24, 1979, and received her commission on July 26, 1979. She served as Chief Judge from 1986 to 1991. She was the first woman to be appointed to the District of Columbia Circuit and was also the first woman to serve as its chief judge.

In 1994, Wald became involved with American Bar Association&#x27;s (ABA) Central European and Eurasian Law Initiative, where she attempted to aid new Eastern European democracies rebuild their legal systems after the fall of the Soviet Union.

==Post judicial service==

After retiring from the federal judiciary, Wald was the United States&#x27;s representative to the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia from 1999 to 2002. She presided over numerous cases of people accused of genocide. Some of the accused included those involved in the Srebrenica massacre. On February 6, 2004, Wald was appointed by President Bush to the President&#x27;s Commission on Intelligence Capabilities of the U.S. Regarding Weapons of Mass Destruction, an independent panel tasked with investigating U.S. intelligence surrounding the United States&#x27; 2003 invasion of Iraq and Iraq&#x27;s weapons of mass destruction. The commission was co-chaired by Laurence Silberman, a fellow judge who worked with Wald on the bench of the District of Columbia Circuit Court. Silberman had a great deal of respect for Wald despite their ideological differences and did not hesitate to recommend her appointment to the bi-partisan commission. Wald agreed to serve on the Constitution Project&#x27;s Guantanamo Task Force in December 2010.

In August 2012, Wald was confirmed by the Senate as a member of the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board after being nominated by President Barack Obama. On December 12, 2013, the Senate invoked cloture on her nomination by a 57–41 vote, thus cutting off a filibuster that had been led by Republican senators. Later that same day, Wald was confirmed by a 57–41 vote. Wald left the Board in January 2017.

She served as chair of the board of directors of the Open Society Justice Initiative and was a member of the board of directors for Mental Disability Rights International. She also continued to serve on the board of the American Bar Association&#x27;s International Criminal Court Project. Wald was a member of the global council of the California International Law Center at the University of California, Davis School of Law. She was also a member of the American Law Institute, the American Philosophical Society, and the Whitney R. Harris World Law Institute&#x27;s International Council.

==Personal life==
Patricia Wald was married to Robert Lewis Wald, who was also a Yale Law School graduate. They were married in 1951, when Patricia was 23; they had met in Europe as they were both traveling the continent. Together they had three daughters and two sons within the span of seven years: Sarah, Doug, Johanna, Frederica, and Thomas. Robert Wald died on September 7, 2010. Wald died in Washington, D.C., on January 12, 2019, from pancreatic cancer, aged 90.

==Honors and awards==
Wald was awarded more than 20 honorary degrees; in 2001, she was awarded an honorary Doctor of Laws by her alma mater, Yale University. In 2002, she was honored for her lifelong commitment to human rights by the International Human Rights Law Group. She was the recipient of the Margaret Brent Award of the American Bar Association for achieving professional excellence in her field and influencing other women to pursue legal careers. Wald received the American Lawyer Hall of Fame Lifetime Achievement Award in 2004 and then four years later in 2008, she was awarded the American Bar Association Medal, the highest honor awarded by the ABA. She also was recognized by the Constitution Project as the 2011 Constitutional Champion. On November 20, 2013, Wald was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation&#x27;s highest civilian honor.

<doc id="457646" wikidata="Q2916304" url="?curid=457646" title="Rick Levin">
<text>Richard Charles Levin (born April 7, 1947) is an American economist and academic administrator. From 1993 to 2013, he was the 22nd President of Yale University. From March 2014 to June 2017, he was Chief Executive Officer of Coursera.

==Early life and education==
Born in San Francisco, California, to Jewish-American parents, Levin graduated from Lowell High School in San Francisco in 1964. At Lowell, he was a member of the Lowell Forensic Society and debated in high school debate tournaments regionally. He graduated from Stanford University in 1968 with a B.A. in history. He then received a Bachelor of Letters in politics and philosophy from Merton College, Oxford. He earned his Ph.D. in economics from Yale in 1974. His academic specialties include industrial research and development, intellectual property, and productivity in manufacturing.

== Career ==
Levin became an Assistant Professor of Economics at Yale in 1974 and was elevated to Associate Professor in 1979. In 1982, he was promoted to Professor of Economics and Management at the Yale School of Management. In 1992, he was appointed Frederick William Beinecke Professor of Economics. Before becoming president, he served as chairman of the Economics Department and dean of Yale&#x27;s Graduate School of Arts and Sciences.

On February 6, 2004, Levin was appointed to the Iraq Intelligence Commission, an independent panel convened to investigate U.S. intelligence surrounding the United States&#x27; 2003 invasion of Iraq and Iraq&#x27;s weapons of mass destruction. He had previously served on a government panel reviewing the U.S. Postal Service and an independent panel appointed by Major League Baseball to examine the sport&#x27;s economics. Levin is a director of the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation, American Express, and Satmetrix.

Although described in Who&#x27;s Who as a Democrat, Levin was one of the first guests of President George W. Bush in the White House during his first term and the president stayed at Levin&#x27;s house when he received an honorary degree from Yale in 2001.

Levin had been rumored as a possible replacement for Larry Summers as Director of the White House National Economic Council until Gene Sperling was selected instead.

Levin stepped down as president of Yale on June 30, 2013. Shortly before his retirement as President of Yale University, he published a book, &quot;The Worth of the University&quot;, a sequel to his previous work, &quot;The Work of the University&quot;. He was succeeded by Peter Salovey.

As president of Yale, Levin studied and helped to some extent to guide what he called &quot;the rise of Asia&#x27;s universities&quot;. Yale&#x27;s role in Asia is briefly set out below. In 2013, Levin agreed to serve on the Advisory Board for the newly created Schwarzman Scholars - fellowships that will take students from many countries for post-graduate study together at Tsinghua University in Beijing, with the aim of promoting international understanding.

In March 2014, Levin became chief executive officer of Coursera. In June 2017, Coursera announced that Levin was being replaced by Jeff Maggioncalda.

Levin and his wife Jane, also a professor at Yale, reside in New Haven, Connecticut. They have four children and seven grandchildren. Their son, Jonathan, was appointed as the 13th president of Stanford University, effective August 1, 2024.

===Yale under Levin===
During Levin&#x27;s tenure, Yale&#x27;s endowment grew from $3.2 billion to over $20 billion. Yale&#x27;s admissions standards and academic prestige also recovered from a significant lull in the early 1990s since Levin&#x27;s appointment. Applications to Yale College rose from fewer than 11,000 for the class entering in 1993 to 28,975 for the class entering in 2012, with the most recent classes reporting the highest range of standardized test scores for any college in America. Under Levin, Yale aggressively expanded its efforts to recruit international students and students from previously underrepresented regions of the United States.

Levin helped established a program for undergraduates in Beijing and increase participation in international work/study programs. Levin has made a special effort to expand Yale&#x27;s engagement with China and was elected to the board of the National Committee on United States-China Relations.

Levin was president during the largest building and renovation program since the 1930s, including all of the university&#x27;s residential colleges. About 70 percent of the space on campus was partially or comprehensively renovated between 1993 and 2013. Levin approved the creation of Yale&#x27;s first two new residential colleges since the 1960s with the purpose of increasing the undergraduate population from around 5,400 to over 6,000. The project was delayed due to the financial crisis, but construction was begun in 2013, shortly after Levin stepped down.

Levin vastly expanded the Yale campus with the creation of Yale&#x27;s West Campus. The campus was created by the purchase of the 136-acre, 17-building Bayer Pharmaceutical campus in Orange, Connecticut, seven miles from Yale&#x27;s main campus. The purchase was completed for $107 million in 2007 and was described at the time as a &quot;ready-made, state-of-the-art research facility&quot;.

Levin&#x27;s administration worked to improve Yale University&#x27;s relationship with its local workers. In 2003, Levin negotiated eight-year contracts with the university&#x27;s unionized workers that provided health care, extensive paid leave, and cumulative raises ranging from 32% to 43%, although he has also fought strongly against new unionization drives by hospital workers, graduate employees, and security guards.

Levin spearheaded the creation of the first liberal arts college in Asia, Yale-NUS College, a joint venture between Yale University and the National University of Singapore. Yale initially faced strong criticism that Singapore&#x27;s various restrictions on press freedom and public protests, as well as its anti-homosexuality policies, would undermine Yale-NUS&#x27;s liberal arts mission.

==Honors==
In 1998, as President of Yale, Levin was awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of Oxford in a ceremony in which the President of Harvard University, Neil Rudenstine, was also honored. He was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 2013.

<doc id="457649" wikidata="Q1138882" url="?curid=457649" title="Douglas A-3 Skywarrior">
<text>The Douglas A-3 Skywarrior is a jet-powered strategic bomber that was developed and produced by the Douglas Aircraft Company. It was designed by Douglas on behalf of the United States Navy, which sought a carrier-capable strategic bomber. In July 1949, Douglas was awarded the contract to produce its design, having bested eight other aircraft companies&#x27; submissions. Unlike rival designs, which had aimed for a maximum take-off weight, the Skywarrior was developed for a take-off weight, facilitating its use from the navy&#x27;s existing s. Large portions of the aircraft were produced by the Westinghouse Electric Corporation, including its early Westinghouse J40 turbojet engines, which failed to meet promises and were replaced by the rival Pratt &amp; Whitney J57 engine by mid-1953. On 28 October 1952, the prototype &quot;XA3D-1&quot; performed the type&#x27;s maiden flight.

On 31 March 1956, the Skywarrior entered squadron service with the Navy. Initially used in the nuclear-armed strategic bomber role, the emergence of effective ballistic missiles led to this mission being deprioritized by the early 1960s. Throughout the majority of its later service life, the Skywarrior was tasked with various secondary missions which included use as an electronic warfare platform, tactical reconnaissance aircraft, and high-capacity aerial refueling tanker. It was among the longest serving carrier-based aircraft in history, having entered service during the mid-1950s and withdrawn from use in 1991. Throughout its service, the Skywarrior was the heaviest operational aircraft to operate from an aircraft carrier, which contributed to its nickname of &quot;Whale&quot;.

The Skywarrior is one of only three U.S. Navy attack aircraft to enter service in the strategic bomber role. The first was its predecessor, the North American AJ Savage. Its successor, the supersonic North American A-5 Vigilante initially supplanted the A-3 in the strategic bomber role (1961-1963) but was then converted to the tactical strike reconnaissance role.

A modified derivative of the Skywarrior, the B-66 Destroyer, served in the United States Air Force, where it was operated as a tactical bomber, electronic warfare aircraft, and aerial reconnaissance platform up until its withdrawal during the 1970s.

==Development==
===Background===
During World War II, the United States Navy (USN) began to explore the concept of operating jet-powered aircraft from its aircraft carriers. Success encouraged further development of the concept; early in the post-war years, officials within the USN began to investigate the use of jet power as a potential means of operating larger carrier-based aircraft that would be capable of performing the strategic bombing mission. The USN had a growing awareness that it could operate in a broader role than had been previously possible, and that the strategic bomber fleet operated by the United States Air Force (USAF) was unable to reach large parts of the world, a lesser limitation to forward deployed USN aircraft carrier groups and their air wings.

In January 1948, the Chief of Naval Operations issued a requirement to develop a long-range, carrier-based attack plane that could deliver either a bomb load or a nuclear weapon. The envisioned aircraft was intended to be operated from the planned &quot;United States&quot;-class &quot;supercarriers,&quot; which were significantly larger than the USN&#x27;s existing carriers, thus the specification set a target loaded weight of . Additionally, the USN sought for this bomber to possess greater speed and range than its existing North American AJ Savage fleet. A total of eight aircraft manufacturers produced responses to the specification, but all except Douglas Aircraft Company and Curtiss-Wright would drop out, declaring that there was no means that the requirements could be met within the 100,000 lb weight limitation. Uncertainty over the performance and requirements of both engines and bombs were major contributing factors towards this climate of negativity.

Ed Heinemann, Douglas&#x27; chief designer, later to win fame for the A-4 Skyhawk, fearing that the &quot;United States&quot; class was vulnerable to cancellation, proposed a significantly smaller aircraft of loaded weight, capable of operating from the USN&#x27;s existing carriers. Heinemann had reasoned (correctly) that as technology developed, the size and weight of nuclear weapons would substantially decrease, which increased the rationale for designing a more compact bomber. However, figures such as USAF general Hoyt Vandenberg ridiculed Heinemann&#x27;s proposal as &quot;making irresponsible claims&quot;. During this period, the USN and USAF were vigorous rivals, each seeking to maintain funding for its projects at the expense of the other in a time marked by drastically declining defense budgets; specifically, USAF officials frequently voiced their open opposition to the construction of the &quot;United States&quot;-class carriers.

===Selection===
In late 1948, both Douglas and Curtiss-Wright were awarded preliminary design contracts to further develop and refine their proposals. While Douglas managed to maintain the take-off weight at 68,000 lb, Curtiss were unable to meet the more generous 100,000 lb target during this phase, and thus were eliminated from consideration. During April 1949, the USN&#x27;s critics succeeded in getting the &quot;United States&quot;-class carriers cancelled; this outcome validated Heinemann&#x27;s decision to focus on a design that could operate from the navy&#x27;s smaller s. During July 1949, the USN, recognizing the suitability of Douglas&#x27; design, awarded a contract for the production of two flight-capable prototypes and a single static airframe to the company.

Douglas sourced significant portions of the aircraft, including responsibility for the turbojet engines, radar, tail-mounted turret, electrical generators and various other secondary systems, from the Westinghouse Electric Corporation; this heavy reliance on Westinghouse allegedly caused some discomfort to Douglas. In particular, development of the Westinghouse J40 engine proved to be incapable of meeting development schedules or performance promises; Heinemann later commented that &quot;the first thing we learned was that the J40 was not powerful enough&quot;. Even prior to the first flight being conducted, Douglas was considering switching to rival manufacturer Pratt &amp; Whitney&#x27;s J57 engine, which was heavier, but allowed the overall aircraft to be lighter as it used less fuel.

On 28 October 1952, the prototype &quot;XA3D-1&quot; performed the type&#x27;s maiden flight; flown by George Jansen, this initial test flight was carried out with a high degree of secrecy. Early on, the aircraft was found to handle particularly well in flight, in part due to the attention Heinemann and the design team had paid to the hydraulically-boosted control surfaces. On 16 October 1953, the first &quot;YA3D-1&quot;, powered by the rival J57 engine, made its first flight.

Considerable development problems, largely associated with the original J40 engines, had delayed the introduction of the Skywarrior until 31 March 1956. The A-3 was, by far, the largest and heaviest aircraft ever designed for routine use on an aircraft carrier, though ironically it was the smallest proposal among other proposals that could only be deployed on even larger carriers not yet in service. As had been predicted by Heinemann early on, the Skywarrior had been designed to carry larger and bulkier bombs than it ever would in service due to the rapid improvements made in weapons technology. Despite this, at the Navy&#x27;s insistence, the aircraft was qualified for an &#x27;overload&#x27; payload capacity of , the testing of which would establish a weight-related record for carrier operations. Because of its cumbersome size, and less-than-slender profile, it was nicknamed &quot;The Whale&quot;.

By the end of the 1950s, it was becoming clear that the nuclear mission of the Skywarrior would be passed onto ballistic missiles; however, its high weight clearance and size meant that the aircraft would be useful in various other capacities. Accordingly, large numbers of Skywarriors were retrofitted as aerial refuelling tankers or as electronic warfare platforms; notably, the &quot;EKA-3B&quot; model could readily swing between performing strike, refuelling, and electronic warfare duties as required. Numerous other models of the type were developed, leading to the type being used for aerial reconnaissance and as a trainer aircraft as well. Production of the type ceased in 1961.

==Design==
The Skywarrior had a 36° degree swept wing and two Pratt &amp; Whitney J57 turbojet engines. Early prototypes had used the intended Westinghouse J40, a powerplant that proved to be disastrous and was subsequently canceled. The turbojets could be supplemented by a provision for twelve thrust JATO bottles. The aircraft had a largely conventional semi-monocoque fuselage, with the engines in underwing nacelles. Flight controls were hydraulic, and for storage below deck, the A-3&#x27;s wings folded outboard of the engines, lying almost flat, and its vertical stabilizer was hinged to starboard. Capacious internal fuel tanks provided long range.

The early A-3 variants had a crew of three: pilot, bombardier/navigator (BN) and crewman/navigator (aka: third crewman). An unusual cockpit configuration was incorporated with the three crew sitting under a framed canopy. In the raised compartment, the pilot and bombardier/navigator sat in a side-by-side arrangement with the pilot&#x27;s station on the port side having full flight controls. On initial variants, a third crew member, who also acted as a gunner for the twin tail-mounted 20mm cannon that briefly equipped the original bomber version of the A3D/A-3A (removed and replaced by ECM equipment), sat behind the pilot in an aft-facing seat. The third crewman station had the sextant for celestial navigation and the defensive electronic counter measures equipment. Later electronic reconnaissance variants could accommodate a crew of seven with the flight crew consisting of a pilot, co-pilot and navigator plus four electronic systems operators occupying stations in the former bomb bay in the spacious fuselage.

Efforts to reduce weight to make the aircraft suitable for carrier operations had led to the deletion of ejection seats during the design process for the Skywarrior, based on the assumption that most flights would be at high altitude. A similar arrangement with an escape tunnel had been used on the F3D Skyknight. Aircrews began joking morbidly that &quot;A3D&quot; stood for &quot;All Three Dead&quot;. (In 1973, the widow of a Skywarrior crewman killed over Vietnam sued the McDonnell Douglas Aircraft Company for not providing ejection seats in the A-3.) In contrast, the US Air Force&#x27;s B-66 Destroyer, not subject to the weight requirements for carrier operations, was equipped with ejection seats throughout its service life.

The documented history of mechanical failures in the A3D/A-3 showed a rate well above average. Originally, the Skywarrior bombers were assigned to all attack carriers, which included the World War II-era and the immediate-postwar &quot;Midway&quot; class.

The Skywarrior could carry up to of weaponry in the fuselage bomb bay, which in later versions was used for sensor and camera equipment or additional fuel tanks. An AN/ASB-1A bomb-director system was initially installed, later replaced by a revised AN/ASB-7 with a slightly reshaped nose. Defensive armament was two 20mm cannons in a radar-operated tail turret designed by Westinghouse, soon removed in favor of electronic countermeasure equipment. Although some bombing missions would be carried out early in the Vietnam War, most bombing would be carried out by more manoeuvrable aircraft, and the Skywarrior would serve mostly as a tanker and electronic warfare support aircraft.

==Operational history==

===Nuclear bomber===
Prior to the initial operational capability of the U.S. Navy&#x27;s Polaris-armed Fleet Ballistic Missile submarines, the A-3 was the Navy&#x27;s critical element in the U.S. nuclear deterrent. Squadrons were established in two Heavy Attack Wings (HATWINGs), with one wing initially established at Naval Air Station North Island, California before relocating to Naval Air Station Whidbey Island, Washington in December 1957 while the other wing was initially established at Naval Air Station Jacksonville, Florida before relocating to Naval Air Station Sanford, Florida. The wing at NAS Whidbey Island would disestablish in 1959 but the squadrons which had made up the wing would later transition to the EKA-3B variant, eventually forming the nucleus for the Navy&#x27;s Grumman EA-6B Prowler community, while the wing at NAS Sanford would convert to the A3J Vigilante (later A-5A) in the nuclear heavy attack mission, followed by conversion to the RA-5C and transition to the reconnaissance attack mission. The Vigilante wing would also continue to retain a small number of TA-3B aircraft for training Naval Flight Officers in the Vigilante&#x27;s radar and navigation systems. The Skywarrior&#x27;s strategic bombing role faded after 1964, briefly being complemented by the A3J Vigilante. Soon afterward, the Navy abandoned the concept of carrier-based strategic nuclear weaponry for the successful Polaris missile-equipped Fleet Ballistic Missile submarine program and all A-5As were converted to the RA-5C Vigilante reconnaissance variant. Many A-3Bs were converted to a combination tanker-electronic warfare aircraft.

===Vietnam War era===

Skywarriors saw some use in the conventional bombing and mine-laying role (A-3B) during the Vietnam War from 1964 through 1967, often to deliver Mk84 bombs. The A-3 found subsequent service in the tanker (KA-3B), photographic reconnaissance (RA-3B), electronic reconnaissance (EA-3B), and electronic warfare (ERA-3B, EKA-3B) roles.

For most of the Vietnam War, EA-3Bs of Fleet Air Reconnaissance Squadron 1 (VQ-1) flew from Da Nang Air Base in South Vietnam, providing continuous electronic reconnaissance capability over the area, including the Ho Chi Minh Trail and all the way north to Haiphong harbor. This was known as VQ-1 Det.B. The aircrew and ground support personnel were temporarily assigned from their home base at Naval Air Station Atsugi, Japan and after 1970, Naval Air Station Agana, Guam. After Det B was disestablished, VQ-1 provided detachments of two EA-3B aircraft that deployed with Western Pacific and Indian Ocean (WESTPAC/IO) bound aircraft carrier battle groups up until the late 1980s when it was replaced by the Lockheed ES-3A Shadow.

In addition, a version of the A-3B was modified into the RA-3B and used in Vietnam as a photo reconnaissance aircraft. Heavy Photographic Squadron 61 (VAP-61) at Naval Air Station Agana, Guam and sister squadron VAP-62 at Naval Air Station Jacksonville, Florida furnished crews and flew out of Da Nang AB performing mapping and intelligence gathering flight over the Southeast Asia area. With 12 camera stations the RA-3B was well equipped to perform cartographic mapping of areas where no detail maps existed. With IR gear installed, the RA-3B was used at night to monitor the movement of troops down roads and trails in Laos. Other locations included Det Tango at Don Muang Royal Thai Air Force Base in Bangkok, Thailand, Det Southpaw at RAAF Base Townsville, Australia, as well as work out of Osan Air Base, South Korea.

====Tanker====

During the Vietnam War, the A-3 attack aircraft were modified to KA-3B tankers while some were modified into a multi-mission tanker variant, the EKA-3B, which was a real workhorse for the carrier air wing. Electronic jamming equipment was added without removing tanker capability so the EKA-3B could jam enemy radar while waiting to refuel tactical aircraft. Eventually, the EKA-3B was replaced by the smaller dedicated Grumman KA-6D Intruder tanker, which although it had less capacity and endurance, was deployed in greater numbers within the carrier&#x27;s air wing. Two additional Naval Reserve units were established in the early 1970s as air refueling squadrons, VAQ-208 and VAQ-308, at Naval Air Station Alameda, California. Both units operated aircraft with electronic warfare equipment removed and were redesignated as KA-3Bs. VAK-208 and VAK-308 were decommissioned in the early 1990s.

===Cold War===
The EA-3 variant was used in critical electronic intelligence (ELINT) roles operating from aircraft carrier decks and ashore supplementing the larger Lockheed EP-3. Its last service was as an ELINT platform during Desert Storm.

===Reconnaissance===
The EA-3B variant was modified for electronic intelligence against the Warsaw Pact. Missions were flown around the globe beginning in 1956, with the U.S. Air Force EB-47 Stratojet flying a similar mission. The EA-3B carried a crew of seven, with flight crew of three in the cockpit and an Electronic Warfare Officer and three electronic systems operators/evaluators in the converted weapons bay. It offered unique electronic reconnaissance capabilities in numerous Cold War-era conflicts and the Vietnam War.

===Retirement===

A handful of EA-3Bs remained in service long enough to participate in the first Gulf War in 1991. The Skywarrior was withdrawn from USN service during September 1991, the last examples of the type being retired on 27 September 1991. U.S. Navy RDT&amp;E units, notably Naval Air Systems Command (NAVAIR) activities at Naval Air Station Point Mugu and NAWS China Lake, attempted to retain their A-3 testbeds. These ambitions were ultimately unsuccessful when Vice Admiral Richard Dunleavy, as Deputy Chief of Naval Operations for Air Warfare and a former A-3 bombardier/navigator himself, made the final decision to retire the type.

===Losses===

* February 9th, 1957, Mayport, Florida, USA. Aircraft lost after ground collision as a result of fuel starvation. LCDR Lewis Pollock was killed and AD2 Pasquale Del Villaggio as well as ENS Henry Demers were moderately injured.
* May 14th, 1957, West of the coast of California, USA (36.30N, 122.35W). Ramp was struck following high attitude after a wave off signal. Fuselage broke at the empennage and main fuel cell was ruptured, leading to fire spreading as the aircraft fell off of the angle deck. CDR Thomas Boulton, LT JG Ralph Gordon, and ADC Joseph Hosking all died as a result.
* June 19th, 1957, 2 nm east of Mayport, Florida, USA. Failure to lower port landing gear after carrier launch. The aircraft&#x27;s crew were able to successfully bail out and be rescued. AQ1 Pascal Mazuc, CDR Clarence Frossard, and ENS Henry Demers were all moderately injured, with CDR Clarence Frossard being more injured than the other two crew members.
* July 6th, 1967, 1 nm south of NAS Sanford, Florida, USA. Aircraft was lost after a ground collision, killing LT Henry White, AQ1 Joseph Monaco, AT2 Eugene Seaman, and CDR Charles Carman. No incident report description was written officially. A newspaper article sent by AT2 Seaman&#x27;s daughter on March 1st, 2012 stated that the aircraft was participating in night training landings, and was practicing mirror landings on aircraft carriers around the time of the incident.
* July 22nd, 1957, The Mediterranean Sea. ADJ 1 Samuel Hollander was crushed and killed by closing bomb bay doors on the flight deck.
* August 12th, 1957, west of the coast of California, USA (37.27N, 122.49W). Arresting gear and hook encountered a point failure, and the aircraft struck the water and was lost at sea. CPO E. Buscaglia and CDR Joseph Garrett were both rescued by a helo plane guard, and sustained minor injuries.
* August 19th, 1957, near Port Lyautey. Aircraft overshot barricade and was lost at sea. AD1 Frank Morey and LT JG John Quinn were both killed, while AQ1 James Babba and LCDR Thomas McLenaghan were both moderately injured.
* September 26, 1957, Norwegian Sea (66.44N, 05.16E). Aircraft encountered ramp strike, with main mounts on the A-3 breaking on impact. LTJG Joseph Juricic, CDR Paul Wilson JR, and ADC Percy Schafer were all killed.
* January 6, 1958, South China Sea (14.15N 114.3E). Aircraft failed to take off successfully after carrier launch. AMC Darrell Weekley, LT JG Clyde Romerson, and LCDR Jack Loper were all killed.
* January 28, 1958, Edwards AFB. Aircraft collided with the ground 10 miles west of Barstow, California, USA, with the cause remaining unknown. Aircraft was entirely lost. Dale Benethum and Thomas Kilgariff, both civilians, were killed in the accident.
* February 7th, 1958, North Atlantic Ocean (31.10N. 40.27W.). Aircraft collided with the water and was lost at sea, with fuel contamination being the likely cause. ENS Robert Martin, LT James Chaffee, and AD3 Richard Fraveau were all killed.
* June 2nd, 1958, Seville, Florida, USA. - After an inflight fire caused mechanical issues, which sent the aircraft into a steep high speed dive from 42,000 feet (12,801 meters), LCDR Robert Ramey ordered crew to leave the aircraft through the overhead escape hatch. One crewmember was experiencing difficulty in leaving the aircraft through the escape chute, leading to Ramey aiding the man and as a result remaining himself in the aircraft, losing his life in the subsequent in-air explosion and crash after maneuvering the aircraft towards an open area. AO1 Raymond Hite and AT1 Daniel Gerbis were mildly injured, and LCDR Robert Ramey died.
* August 2, 1958, Western Pacific Ocean. The aircraft overran the flight deck. The arresting gear was set up for an A-10. The aircraft hit the water inverted, with the aircraft being recovered and struck at DM AFB. The canopy shattered, with the possibility of the pilot and BN seats being carried away at impact. LCDR Alfred McMillian and LT Gordon Gilmore were both killed in the accident, with AQ1 experiencing somewhat severe injuries.
* October 1, 1958, NAS Leeward Point, Guantanamo, Cuba. Landing gear was retracted during landing, with the aircraft managing to stop safely on the flight deck. The aircraft was repairable, and LT Horace Graham as well as AD3 Samuel Craw suffered minor to moderate injuries.
* December 4th, 1958. Departed from NAS Sanford for FDR - Aircraft was lost over the Caribbean. The pilot was waved off on the first pass, and boltered on the second pass. The third pass led to the left wing striking the flight deck, and the cross deck pendant parting (Arresting wire breaking). All 3 crew members were rescued by helos. AD1 Clyde Savage, LCDR Richard Andrus, and AD2 Eugene Kronjaeger all faced moderate injuries.
* August 26th, 1959. A compressor stall in a thunderstorm led to the aircraft crashing 1nm ESE of E. Monobo, North Carolina, USA. AE2 Mitchell, PH1 D.E. Wilson both faced moderate injuries with LCDR John Sandster losing his life. VAH 1 CO recommended that ejection seats be installed in A3s.
* June 7, 1960. An A-3 veered off the runway during takeoff at NAS Whidbey Island/Ault Field and crashed in feet of water. One man killed was LTJG Richard North, the first husband of Helen Beardsley of &quot;Yours, Mine, and Ours&quot; fame.
* January 25, 1987, Mediterranean Sea. An EA-3B low on fuel during a night landing impacted the top of the barricade of the USS Nimitz and went into the water. Killed were LT Stephen H. Batchelder (Intelligence Evaluator), LCDR Ronald R. Callander (Navigator), AT2 Richard A. Herzing, LT Alan A. Levine (Pilot), CTI3 Patrick R. Price, LT James D. Richards (Junior Evaluator), and CTI3 Craig H. Rudolf.
* June 26, 1987, NAS Miramar, California. An EA-3B crashed while conducting carrier landing practice. All three onboard perished.
* January 13, 1988, at Pyramid Lake northeast of Reno, Nevada. A KA-3B impacted the lake while flying in the late afternoon on a low-level mission. All three crew onboard were killed.

Being the heaviest aircraft to take off from a carrier, the Skywarrior was prone to accidents. &quot;Ultimately, of 283 Skywarriors of various models built, around 120 (42%) were destroyed or crippled in accidents and combat. In 67% of accidents, at least one crew member died.&quot; Of these losses, 7 were in Vietnam, of which 2 were the result of combat.

===Post-retirement career===

The A-3 had been used as a civilian operated testbed for many years before the type&#x27;s retirement from US Navy, with Hughes Aircraft Company using the type as a testbed for developing the weapons system for the General Dynamics–Grumman F-111B and Grumman F-14 Tomcat, with Westinghouse and Raytheon also using the A-3 as a testbed. On the retirement of the type from US Navy service in 1991, the US Navy decided to end logistic support for the civilian operated testbeds. Rather than abandon the A-3, Hughes, Westinghouse and Raytheon agreed to acquire the remaining A-3s and spares from the Navy, allowing their test fleets to continue to operate and saving the US Navy the cost of storage and disposal. As the plan matured, two other contractors, Thunderbird Aviation and CTAS also elected to participate in similar agreements, with eleven A-3s spread between the five operators. The fleet spares from ASO (Aviation Supply Office) were distributed between the contractors evenly, and warehouses were emptied all over the US. Due to misunderstandings and reorganizations within the US Navy, the worldwide ASO assets were scrapped, not getting to the contractors. In early 1993, CTAS decided that they no longer had use for their aircraft, and Hughes had several programs needing additional assets.

In early 1994, a US Air Force program decided to modify an A-3 for F-15 radar tests, and the only available airframe was stored at Naval Air Station Alameda since the fleet shutdown. Hughes added that aircraft to the bailment, and ferried the aircraft to Van Nuys for modifications. An entire nose section was removed from a stricken F-15B at AMARC at Davis-Monthan AFB, Arizona and grafted onto the front of the aircraft. Racks and equipment were installed in the cabin, and the aircraft was used by Hughes and the USAF for F-15 software development.

In 1994, Westinghouse decided to terminate their agreement with the Navy, and Thunderbird added their aircraft to the Thunderbird bailment. In 1996, Thunderbird Aviation went into receivership, and Hughes, through mutual cost savings to the government, added the Thunderbird assets to the contract, prepping them for ferry at Deer Valley airport, and relocating them to Mojave, California and Tucson, Arizona for long-term storage.

In December 1996, Raytheon bought the aerospace units of Hughes Aircraft Company. Hughes Aeronautical Operations, now a part of Raytheon Systems, continued to operate the A-3s from their base at Van Nuys Airport, California. These aircraft have participated in several military air shows, telling visitors that the plane continued to be valuable for its load capacity compared to corporate jets, and its performance compared to small airliners.

On 30 June 2011, the last flyable EA-3B, BuNo 144865 / FAA registration N875RS, a Raytheon aircraft, arrived at Naval Air Station Pensacola, Florida for retirement and display at the National Naval Aviation Museum.

==Variants==
&quot;Note: under the original Navy designation scheme, the Skywarrior was designated &quot;A3D&quot; (third Attack aircraft from Douglas Aircraft). In September 1962, the new Tri-Services designation system was implemented and the aircraft was redesignated &quot;A-3&quot;. Where applicable, pre-1962 designations are listed first, post-1962 designations in parentheses.&quot;
* XA3D-1: Two prototypes with Westinghouse J40 turbojets, no cannon in tail turret.
* YA3D-1 (YA-3A): One pre-production prototype with Pratt &amp; Whitney J57 engines. Later used for tests at the Pacific Missile Test Center.
* A3D-1 (A-3A): 49 initial production versions, serving largely in developmental role in carrier service.
* A3D-1P (RA-3A): One A3D-1 converted as a prototype for the A3D-2P with camera pack in the weapon bay.
* A3D-1Q (EA-3A): Five A3D-1s converted for the electronic reconnaissance (ELINT) role, with ECM equipment and four operators in weapons bay.
* A3D-2 (A-3B): Definitive production bomber version, with stronger airframe, more powerful engines, slightly larger wing area (812 ft2/75 m2 versus 779 ft2/72 m2), provision for in-flight refueling reel for tanker role. Final 21 built had new AN/ASB-7 bombing system, reshaped nose; deleted tail turret in favor of electronic warfare installation.
* A3D-2P (RA-3B): 30 photo-reconnaissance aircraft with weapons bay package for up to 12 cameras plus photoflash bombs. Increased pressurization allowed camera operator to enter the bay to check the cameras. Some retained tail guns, but most were later converted to ECM tail of late A-3Bs.
* A3D-2Q (EA-3B): 24 electronic warfare versions with pressurized compartment in former weapon bay for one Electronic Warfare Officer and three ESM operators, various sensors. Some early models had tail guns, but these were replaced with the ECM tail. It was assigned to fleet reconnaissance squadrons VQ-1 (Japan and later Guam) and VQ-2 (Rota. Spain) where they flew alongside the Lockheed EC-121 Warning Star and the EP-3B and EP-3E. It served for almost 40 years, being the longest serving variant, and was replaced by the ES-3A Shadow flown by two Fleet Air Reconnaissance (VQ) squadrons: VQ-5 at Naval Air Station North Island, California and VQ-6 at Naval Air Station Cecil Field, Florida. They were decommissioned due to budget constraints less than 10 years after commissioning.
* A3D-2T (TA-3B): 12 bomber-trainer versions. Five later converted as VIP transports (two redesignated UTA-3B).
* KA-3B: 85 A-3B bombers refitted in 1967 for the tanker role with probe-and-drogue system in place of bombing equipment.
* EKA-3B: 34 KA-3B tankers refitted for dual Electronic countermeasures (ECM)/tanker role, with electronic warfare equipment and tail fairing in place of rear turret. Most were converted back to KA-3B configuration (with no ECM gear) after 1975.
* ERA-3B: Eight RA-3Bs converted as electronic aggressor aircraft (primarily for war-at sea exercises) with ECM gear in an extended tail cone and fairings, along with two detachable ram-air turbine powered ALQ-76 countermeasures pods (one under each wing), chaff dispensers (on the tail cone and aft fuselage) and four ram-air turbines (two per side) to power equipment located in the former bomb bay. Crew increased to four: pilot, navigator, crew chief, and Electronic Countermeasures Officer (ECMO) with one mostly unused &quot;jumpseat&quot; in the aft crew compartment (the former weapon bay) which lacked an equipment position for a second Electronic Countermeasures Officer or enlisted crewman. The &quot;jump seat&quot; was used by instructor ECMOs training new ECMOs, as well as by guest observers and passengers during operational flights. While the ERA-3B could withstand a cable-arrested landing, the ALT-40 and ALR-75 equipment was not stressed to withstand catapult launches, thus it was never deployed aboard carriers. The ERA-3B served with VAQ-33 and later with VAQ-34.
* NRA-3B: Six RA-3Bs converted for various non-combat test purposes.

* VA-3B: Two EA-3B converted as VIP transports. Both aircraft were assigned to the Chief of Naval Operations flying from Andrews AFB in Washington, DC. 
* NTA-3B: One aircraft converted by Hughes/Raytheon used to test radar for the F-14D Tomcat.

===B-66 Destroyer===
The U.S. Air Force ordered 294 examples of the derivative B-66 Destroyer, most of which were used in the reconnaissance and electronic warfare roles. The Destroyer was fitted with ejection seats.

<text>Nicolas Desmarest (; 16 September 1725 – 20 September 1815) was a French geologist and contributor to the &quot;Encyclopédie ou Dictionnaire raisonné des sciences, des arts et des métiers&quot;, in particular, the multi-volume &quot;Géographie-physique&quot;.

Desmarest was born in Soulaines, in the department of Aube. Of humble parentage, he was educated at the College of the Oratorians of Troyes and Paris. Taking full advantage of the instruction he received, he was able to support himself by teaching, and to continue his studies independently. Buffon&#x27;s &quot;Theory of the Earth&quot; interested him, and in 1753 he successfully competed for a prize by writing an essay on the ancient connection between England and France. This attracted much attention, and ultimately led to his being employed in studying and reporting on manufactures in different countries, and in 1788 to his appointment as inspector-general of the manufactures of France.

He utilized his journeys, travelling on foot, so as to add to his knowledge of the Earth&#x27;s structure. In 1763 he made observations in Auvergne, recognizing that the prismatic basalts were old lava streams, comparing them with the columns of the Giant&#x27;s Causeway in Ireland, and referring them to the operations of extinct volcanoes. It was not, however, until 1774, that he published an essay on the subject, accompanied by a geological map, having meanwhile on several occasions revisited the district. He then pointed out the succession of volcanic outbursts and the changes the rocks had undergone through weathering and erosion. As remarked by Sir Archibald Geikie, the doctrine of the origin of valleys by the erosive action of the streams which flow through them was first clearly taught by Desmarest.

An enlarged and improved edition of his map of the volcanic region of Auvergne was published after his death, in 1823, by his son Anselme Gaëtan Desmarest (1784-1838), who was distinguished as a zoologist, and author of memoirs on recent and fossil crustaceans. He died in Paris.

<text>William Oliver Studeman (born January 16, 1940) is a retired admiral of the United States Navy and former deputy director of the Central Intelligence Agency, with two extended periods as acting Director of Central Intelligence. As deputy director of Central Intelligence, he served in the administrations of George H. W. Bush and Bill Clinton under three directors of Central Intelligence, Robert Gates, R. James Woolsey Jr., and John M. Deutch. Studeman retired from the navy in 1995 after almost 35 years of service. Between 1988 and 1992 he was director of the National Security Agency; he was the Director of Naval Intelligence, from September 1985 to July 1988.

On 6 February 2004, Studeman was appointed to the Iraq Intelligence Commission, an independent panel tasked with investigating U.S. intelligence surrounding the United States&#x27; 2003 invasion of Iraq and Iraq&#x27;s weapons of mass destruction (WMD).

Studeman retired in 2005 from Northrop Grumman Corporation as vice president and deputy general manager of mission systems. In this position, he focused on strategies, programs, business development, and marketing related to intelligence and information warfare, as well as corporate cross-sector integration, and on managing technology partnerships and concepts related to NetCentricity ISR, IO/IW and advanced command environments. He served in this position for approximately 9 years.

Studeman has served on corporate boards, and government, university and corporate advisory boards. He was recently a commissioner on the Presidential Commission on WMD, and is currently serving on National Advisory Board on Bio-Security and the Public Interest Declassification Board. He is also a member of the Defense Science Board as well as the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency Advisory Board, Defense Intelligence Agency Joint Military Intelligence College, National Reconnaissance Office, national labs and other advisory boards. He is chairman of the board of the Naval Intelligence Foundations, and is a member of the board of the National Cryptologic Museum Foundation.

In June 1962, he received a B.A. degree in history from the University of the South in Sewanee, Tennessee. Studeman later earned an M.A. degree in public and international affairs from George Washington University&#x27;s Elliott School of International Affairs in June 1973. While in the Navy, he also was a distinguished graduate of the Naval War College and National War College, as well as the recipient of an honorary doctorate in strategic intelligence from the Defense Intelligence College. He will receive a second honorary doctorate degree this fall from the University of the South.

Studeman is the recipient of numerous service commendations and citations, including the Navy Distinguished Service Medal, the Legion of Merit with two Gold Stars. In 2007 Studeman was awarded the William Oliver Baker Award by the Intelligence and National Security Alliance. He also has received service medals from the Governments of France, Brazil, and South Korea.

His son, Michael, is a career Navy two-star admiral.

<text>Donkervoort Automobielen BV is a manufacturer of hand-built and ultra light weight sports cars based in Lelystad, Netherlands. The car brand was founded in 1978 by Joop Donkervoort.
In 1996, Donkervoort&#x27;s Ford engines were replaced by Audi engines. Donkervoort&#x27;s motto – &quot;No Compromise&quot; – means driving without any electronic aids such as ABS (anti-lock braking system), electronic stability program (ESP) or power steering.

==Corporate history==
Donkervoort is a privately-held company controlled by founder Joop Donkervoort until he retired in 2019 and his son Denis succeeded him as Managing Director in 2021. Marianne Donkervoort, who is married to Joop, and Amber, their daughter, also have played key roles in developing the business and branding of the company. Amber was an equestrian who joined the company as the marketing manager following an internship in China. The Donkervoort S8A was named for Amber, while the D8 was named for Denis&#x27;.

Joop started the company as a kit car importer in 1978, but upon learning he needed to make significant modifications to make the assembled kit cars street legal, began building the first S7 automobiles using a design derived from the Lotus Seven in a Tienhoven shed. In 1983, Donkervoort moved to a larger production facility in Loosdrecht, followed by another move in 2000 to its present headquarters and factory in Lelystad. Chassis production, which previously had been contracted to an external supplier, was brought in-house to Lelystad in 2003.

===Future plans===

Donkervoort announced on their website that is expanding its worldwide locations and services, most recently being available as a car brand in the US.

===Current models===
;Donkervoort F22 (2022)

Donkervoort announced in October 2022 on their website that has ended the production of D8 series and is planning to produce a new model, Donkervoort F22. It will be less than 800 kg and will have similar features to the previous models. Further details were provided in a November press release announcing the F22 will be launched on December 10, 2022. Donkervoort stated the F22 would be faster, larger, more rigid, and more efficient than the D8 GTO. Initial reports, which stated the F22 would weigh less than and boldly advertised &quot;it will be worth the weight&quot;, caused speculation the F22 would be considerably heavier than the D8 GTO; Donkervoort later clarified the target weight was &quot;considerably less than&quot; .

As announced in December 2022, the F22 was a limited-production model with just 75 examples produced; of these, 50 were sold already. The vehicle is long and the chassis uses steel tubes and the company&#x27;s &quot;Ex-Core&quot; carbon fibre sandwich technology, bringing the total weight of the vehicle to . The drivetrain uses a five-cylinder engine from Audi that develops / and drives the rear wheels through a five-speed manual transmission. Donkervoort tout it as having improved &quot;practicality, comfort, and ease of use&quot;, featuring the car&#x27;s trunk. It is named for Filippa, the daughter of managing director Denis Donkervoort, born in 2022.

===Previous models===
====Donkervoort S7/S8====

;Donkervoort S7
The first Donkervoort – the S7 – was introduced in 1978. It is an ultra-light weight sports car manufactured in Tienhoven between 1978 and 1982. It was replaced by the Donkervoort S8 in late 1983. These cars have a Ford Crossflow 1.6 liter OHV engine with and a four-speed manual transmission, or a 2.0 liter Ford OHC engine with . Mechanically, the car used a Triumph front axle and an Escort rear axle. Top speed was .

;Donkervoort S8/S8A
Introduced in late 1983, the S8 and later S8A were the first Donkervoorts of notice, with the &quot;Eight&quot; implying an improvement over the Lotus Seven. Of exactly the same dimensions as the Donkervoort Super Seven, these cars originally used a two-liter inline-four engine from Ford of Europe. In 1985, the S8 was upgraded with a five-speed gearbox, a Donkervoort front axle, and a rear axle from the Ford Capri. The S8A also was introduced that year with a wider front track and an independent rear suspension, distinguished by refreshed styling and new adhesive-based manufacturing. Production of the S8 ended in 1989, and the S8A was discontinued in 1993.

;Donkervoort S8AT 
Responding to the need for more power, a turbocharged version of the S8A was introduced in 1986; this car is identifiable by a profusion of various vents and openings to cool the engine. Power output rose to . The S8AT was improved in 1988, receiving the chassis and larger engine from the D10 until it was discontinued in 1994.
====Donkervoort D8====

;Donkervoort D8 Zetec (1993-1998)
From 1993 the new D8 was built, marking the continuing departure from being merely a Super Seven copy. The first D8s were the last Donkervoorts to receive Ford engines; 1.8 and 2.0-liter versions from the Zetec family. Donkervoort offered a &quot;Sport&quot; version that changed to cycle-style front fenders and reduced weight through the use of carbon fibre body parts.

;Donkervoort D8 Cosworth (1995-1998)
The D8 also was fitted with the 2.0-liter turbocharged Cosworth &quot;YB&quot; engine starting in 1995.
;Donkervoort D8 Audi (1999–2008)
During 1999, Donkervoort switched from Ford to Audi&#x27;s 20-valve turbocharged 1.8-liter &quot;R4&quot; engine, available in a variety of outputs ranging from .

;Donkervoort D8 Audi (E-gas) Wide Track (2003–2012)
Since 2003, the Donkervoort is equipped with the Audi 1.8T 20V E-gas (electronic throttle) turbocharged engine. In the D8, the engine is available with 150 bhp, 180 bhp, 210 bhp and 270 bhp. Thanks to its total weight of , this results in an acceleration time from between 3.8 and 5.2 seconds depending on the type. The Wide Track models can be distinguished from earlier Audi-powered models by the front light arrangement.

;Donkervoort D8 270 (2008–2012)
The Donkervoort D8 270 is available since the summer of 2008. This version of the D8 series became the successor of the D8 270 RS, the limited edition that was introduced in 2005 and restricted to 25 numbered units. The D8 270 has a restyled nose and grill that refer directly to the D8 GT and accelerates from 0–100 km/h in 3.6 seconds.

This car was the seventh fastest production car on Nürburgring&#x27;s famous Nordschleife of 2011, at 7m 14.9s.

;Donkervoort D8 GT (2007–2012)
The Donkervoort D8 GT - introduced in 2007 - is the first closed Donkervoort. Compared to the open version of the D8, the D8 GT has entirely new front and rear suspension, increased track width by 8 centimeters, larger brakes for increased stopping power and 17-inch aluminum wheels. With a total weight of , the D8GT is the lightest GT in the world. This is largely due to the extensive use of carbon fiber: the entire roof, the entire rear and the doors and fenders of the car are made of this material.
====Donkervoort D8 GTO====
;Donkervoort D8 GTO (2013–2022)
The Donkervoort D8 GTO is a completely new creation. The engine, a 2.5L TFSI 5-cylinder turbocharged Audi engine, has a power output of 250-280 kW (340-380PS/335-375 bhp) and 450Nm of torque at 1600rpm, and the whole car weighs less than 700 kg. This low weight is due to composite materials such as the full carbon fibre body of the D8 GTO. With a power-to-weight ratio of just 1.8 kg/PS the car accelerates from 0–100 km/h in 2.8s and from 0–200 km/h in just 8.6s.

The very first GTOs were produced in a limited series of 25 Premium D8 GTOs in 2013. The production of the regular D8 GTO, available in a Touring or a Performance version, started in 2014.

;Donkervoort D8 GTO RS (2016–2022)
Donkervoort introduced the D8 GTO RS in October 2016 as the successor to their D8 270 RS. Donkervoort states that they have reduced the D8 GTO&#x27;s drag coefficient by 20 percent. The GTO RS offers a new suspension system as an additional option, and also offers a dual-clutch automatic transmission setup. It is not street legal.

;Donkervoort D8 GTO Individual series (2021)
In July 2021 Donkervoort announced on their website that they were launching a newer vehicle and their moto was &quot;Any company can sell their cars. Only Donkervoort can create your car - The choice is yours&quot;. The model D8 GTO Individual series was launched on 9 September 2021 and was the first Donkervoort model available in purple color.
===Limited editions and prototypes===
;Donkervoort D10 (1988)
This sleek, minimalist version was built in a very limited series of ten to celebrate Donkervoort&#x27;s tenth anniversary in 1988. The cars lacked a spare wheel as well as a windshield, but benefitted from an enlarged (2,160 cc) version of the Ford engine with a bigger Garrett T3 turbocharger, producing . The last car was only built in 1994, with some of the later examples receiving Cosworth engines with up to .

;Donkervoort D20 (1998)
Intended as the 20th anniversary special, the D20 was developed in conjunction with Audi under the sponsorship of CEO Dr. Franz-Josef Paefgen. Until the D20, all Donkervoorts had the engine and gearbox in the front, but the D20 had the engine in the front and the gearbox in the rear as a transaxle. The D20 was the first Donkervoort with a V6 engine, which was actually intended for larger, more comfortable Audi cars. The engine was modified to produce . The D20 was built as a prototype, but never went into production as it was unable to meet emissions standards with the larger engine.

;Donkervoort J25 (2003)
Intended as the 25th anniversary special, the J25 used the nose and doors from the D20 with modernized styling and was the first Donkervoort to develop . A prototype was built but it never entered regular production.

;Donkervoort D8 270 RS (2005)

The D8 270 RS was built in a limited edition of 25 examples to celebrate the prototype RS that was used to set the production car lap record at the Nurburgring Nordschleife.

;Donkervoort D8 GTO Premium (2013)
The Premium D8 GTO&#x27;s were the first GTO&#x27;s to be produced. After a sneak preview event introducing the D8 GTO in December 2012, existing customer were able to obtain one of these &quot;full option&quot; GTO&#x27;s. The Premium D8 GTO were built as a limited series of 25 cars and had a little more power (380+ BHP) than e.g. the D8 GTO Performance.
;Donkervoort D8 GTO Bilster Berg Edition (2014–2015)
In September 2014, the Donkervoort D8 GTO broke the lap record at the German Bilster Berg Drive Resort. The 380 hp Performance version set the new record for street-legal production cars at 1 minute 46.12 seconds. To celebrate this milestone – along with the opening of a Donkervoort subsidiary at that same location that year, Donkervoort introduced the Bilster Berg Edition, which was based on the record-breaking test car and built in a limited series of just 14 cars, a number that represented the successful year 2014. Technical developments included the further development and fine-tuning in the areas of chassis and road-handling. Furthermore, this edition is easily recognisable by its dark nose section, made entirely of carbon fibre.
;Donkervoort D8 GTO-40 (2018)

For the firm&#x27;s 40th anniversary, the GTO-40 was released as a limited edition of 40. Weight has been reduced by compared to the conventional GTO through the use of carbon fibre sandwich panels (branded and patented by Donkervoort as EX-CORE) and an optimized steel tubular chassis.

;Donkervoort D8 GTO JD-70 (2019)
For the founder&#x27;s 70th birthday, Joop Donkervoort a special edition called Donkervoort D8 GTO JD-70 was produced, again making use of Donkervoort&#x27;s EX-CORE technology. In total, there were 70 produced, including the Bare Naked Carbon Edition and JD70 R sub-variants. The Bare Naked Carbon Edition highlighted the extensive use of carbon fibre body panels by changing the painted finish to a clear coat, and was offered in four levels corresponding to the degree of paint reduction, ranging from &quot;Exposed Carbon&quot; (matte or gloss clear coats over the side panels, engine-bay wings, bonnet scoop, triangular cover scoops, and interior) to &quot;Full-Exposed Coloured Carbon&quot; (tinted clear coat finish over all carbon fibre parts). The JD70 R is a track-tuned edition with racing-specific improvements, and Donkervoort includes driver coaching and data analysis services with the purchase of the car.

<doc id="457669" wikidata="Q71033" url="?curid=457669" title="Samuel Hartlib">
<text>Samuel Hartlib or Hartlieb (c. 1600 – 10 March 1662) was a Polish born, English educational and agricultural reformer of German-Polish origin who settled, married and died in England. He was a son of George Hartlib, a Pole, and Elizabeth Langthon, a daughter of a rich English merchant. Hartlib was a noted promoter and writer in fields that included science, medicine, agriculture, politics and education. He was a contemporary of Robert Boyle, whom he knew well, and a neighbour of Samuel Pepys in Axe Yard, London, in the early 1660s. He studied briefly at the University of Cambridge upon arriving in England.

==&quot;Intelligencer&quot;==
Hartlib is often described as an &quot;&quot;, and indeed has been called &quot;the Great Intelligencer of Europe&quot;. His main aim in life was to further knowledge. He kept in touch with an array of contacts from high philosophers to gentleman farmers. He maintained a voluminous correspondence, lost in 1667, but much recovered since 1945; it is housed in a special Hartlib collection at the University of Sheffield, England.

Hartlib became one of the best-connected intellectual figures of the Commonwealth era. He was responsible for patents, spreading information and fostering learning. He circulated designs for calculators, double-writing instruments, seed machines and siege engines. His letters in German, Latin, English and other languages have been subjected to close modern scholarship.

Hartlib set out with a universalist goal: &quot;to record all human knowledge and to make it universally available for the education of all mankind&quot;. His work has been compared to modern internet search engines.

==Life==
Hartlib was born in Elbląg (Elbing), Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. His mother was the daughter of a rich English merchant in Gdańsk (Danzig). His father was a Polish refugee merchant. He studied at the Gymnasium in Brzeg and at the Albertina. He went on to Herborn Academy, where he studied under Johannes Heinrich Alsted and Johannes Bisterfeld. Although briefly at the University of Cambridge, supported by John Preston, he does not seem to have formally studied there.

Hartlib met the Scottish preacher John Dury in 1628. In the same year, Hartlib relocated to England, faced with the prospect of being caught in a war zone, as Imperial armies moved into the western parts of Poland and the chance of intervention by Sweden grew. He first unsuccessfully set up a school in Chichester, in line with his theories of education, and in 1630 moved permanently to London, living in Duke&#x27;s Place, Holborn. An early patron was John Williams, the Bishop of Lincoln, who was leading the clerical opposition to Archbishop William Laud. Another supporter was John Pym; Pym would use Hartlib later, as a go-between with Dutch Calvinists in London, in an effort to dig up evidence against Laud. Hugh Trevor-Roper argues in his essay &quot;Three Foreigners&quot; (referring to Hartlib, Dury and the absent Comenius) that Hartlib and the others were the &quot;philosophers&quot; of the &quot;country party&quot; or anti-court grouping of the 1630s and early 1640s, united in their support for these outside voices if agreeing on little else.

During the Civil War, Hartlib occupied himself with the peaceful study of agriculture, publishing various works of his own and printing at his own expense several treatises by others on the subject. He planned a school for the sons of gentlemen, to be conducted on new principles, and this probably was the occasion of his friend John Milton&#x27;s &quot;Tractate on Education&quot;, addressed to him in 1644, and of William Petty&#x27;s &quot;Two Letters&quot; on the same subject, in 1647 and 1648. Another associate in that period was Walter Blith, a noted writer on husbandry.

For his various labours, Hartlib received a pension of £100 from Oliver Cromwell, afterwards increased to £300, as he had spent all his fortune on his experiments. But Hartlib died in poverty: Samuel Pepys in 1660 noted that Hartlib&#x27;s daughter Nan was penniless. His association with Oliver Cromwell and the Commonwealth resulted in him being sidelined after Charles II&#x27;s Restoration. He lost his pension, which had already fallen into arrears. Some of his correspondents went so far as to ask for their letters from his archive, fearing they could be compromised by them.

==Family==
In 1629 Hartlib married Mary Burmingham, daughter of Philip Burmingham; she died about 1660. They had at least six children. His family life is rather poorly documented: one useful source is the Diary of Samuel Pepys, as Pepys was a close neighbour of the Hartlib family in Axe Yard in the early 1660s and a friend of Hartlib&#x27;s son Samuel Jr, a clerk in government service. Hartlib&#x27;s daughter Mary married the physician and chemist Frederick Clod, or Clodius, referred to as &quot;Doctor Clodius&quot; in the Diary. Another daughter Anna (Nan) married the merchant, writer and preacher Johannes Roder of Utrecht in 1660, despite her lack of a dowry. Samuel Pepys, a guest at the wedding, described it as an occasion of &quot;very great state, cost and noble company&quot;. Always the realist, Pepys thought it an excellent match for Nan: &quot;a great fortune for her to light on, she having nothing in the world&quot;. Hartlib, having heard a good deal of this kind of gossip, indignantly denied that he had married off his daughter to gain a share of the Roder fortune, but the marriage was certainly advantageous since Roder&#x27;s father was a rich man, and because Roder, as a prophet/preacher in the Cromwell years, had foretold the &quot;coming of a king&quot;. This worked to his advantage after the return of Charles II.

==Baconian==
Hartlib was indebted to Francis Bacon for a general theory of education that formed common ground for him and Jan Comenius. Hartlib published two studies of Comenius&#x27;s work: &quot;Conatuum Comenianorum praeludia&quot; (1637) and &quot;Comenii pansophiae prodromus et didactica dissertatio&quot; (1639). He also put effort into getting Comenius, of the Protestant Moravian Brethren, to visit England. John Dury and Comenius were Hartlib&#x27;s two closest correspondents. The latter had the concept of a &quot;tree of knowledge&quot;, continually branching out and growing. He also put his own spin on Bacon&#x27;s ideas. In 1640 he addressed the English Parliament with his Utopian plans involving a new commonwealth and the advancement of learning. Shortly before the English Civil War broke out, John Gauden preached in 1640 to Parliament, recommending that Dury and Comenius be invited to England and naming Hartlib as a likely contact.

Men like Hartlib and Comenius wanted to make the spread of knowledge easier at a time when most knowledge was not categorised or standardised by any widespread conventions or academic disciplines and libraries were mostly private. They wanted to enlighten, educate and improve society, as religious people who saw this as the work of God. Comenius arrived in England in 1641 – bad timing considering that war was imminent. His presence failed to transform the position in education, though substantial literature grew up, particularly on university reform, where Oliver Cromwell set up a new institution. Comenius left in 1642; under Cromwell elementary schooling was expanded from 1646, and Durham College was founded, with staff from Hartlib&#x27;s associates.

Bacon had formulated a project for a research institute entitled &quot;Salomon&#x27;s House&quot; in his &quot;New Atlantis&quot; of 1624. This theoretical scheme was important for Hartlib, who angled during the 1640s for public funding for it. He failed except for a small pension for himself but gathered like-minded others: Dury, John Milton, Kenelm Digby, William Petty, and his son-in-law Frederick Clod (Clodius).

Milton dedicated his 1644 &quot;Of Education&quot; to Hartlib, whom he had come to know the year before and who had pressed him to publish his educational ideas. But he gave the Comenian agenda short shrift in the work. Barbara Lewalski considers his dismissive attitude as disingenuous, as he had probably used texts by Comenius in his own teaching. Hezekiah Woodward, linked in the minds of Presbyterians and officialdom with Milton as a dangerous writer, was also significant as an educational follower of Comenius and Bacon and a friend of Hartlib.

==Hartlib Circle – Royal Society==

The &quot;Hartlib circle&quot; of contacts and correspondents, built up from about 1630, was one of the foundations of the Royal Society of London established a generation later. The relationship, however, is not transparent, as Hartlib and his close supporters, with the exception of William Petty, were excluded from the Royal Society when it was set up in 1660.

==Economics, agriculture, politics==
The utopian &quot;Description of the Famous Kingdome of Macaria&quot; appeared under Hartlib&#x27;s name, but is now thought to be by Gabriel Plattes (1600–1655), a friend of his. A practical project was to establish a workhouse, as part of the Corporation of the Poor of London. This initiative is thought to have been a major influence on the later philanthropic schemes of John Bellers.

In 1641, Hartlib wrote &quot;Relation of that which hath been lately attempted to procure Ecclesiastical Peace among Protestants&quot;. After Comenius left England, and in particular from 1646 onwards, the Hartlib group agitated for religious reform and toleration, against the Presbyterian dominance in the Long Parliament. They also proposed economic, technical and agricultural improvements, notably through Sir Cheney Culpeper and Henry Robinson. Benjamin Worsley, Secretary to the Council of Trade from 1650, was a Hartlibian.

Hartlib valued knowledge: anything to raise crop yields or cure disease. Agriculture was a great interest. He worked to spread Dutch farming practices in England, such as the use of nitrogenous crops like cabbage to replenish the nitrogen in the soil and raise the next season&#x27;s yield. In 1652 he issued a second edition of Richard Weston&#x27;s &quot;Discourse of Flanders Husbandry&quot; (1645). Hartlib corresponded with many landowners and academics in his quest for knowledge.

From 1650 Hartlib had an interest in and influence on fruit husbandry. A letter on the subject by Sir Richard Child was published in one of his books: &quot;Samuel Hartlib, his Legacy, or an Enlargement of the Discourse of Husbandry used in Brabant and Flanders&quot;. Hartlib introduced John Beale, another author on orchards, to John Evelyn, who would eventually write an important work in the field, &quot;Sylva&quot; (1664). In 1655 Hartlib wrote &quot;The Reformed Commonwealth of Bees&quot;, featuring a transparent glass beehive to a design by Christopher Wren. Evelyn showed him the manuscript of his &quot;Elysium Britannicum&quot;, at the end of the 1650s.

==Science and medicine==
The work of Paracelsus, a 16th-century physician and alchemist who made bold claims for his science, was also one of the inspirations to Hartlib and early chemistry. Hartlib was open-minded, and often tested the ideas and theories of his correspondents. For his own trouble with kidney stones, Hartlib took to drinking diluted sulphuric acid – an intended cure that may have contributed to his death.

Hartlib was interested in theories and practices that modern science would deem irrational, or superstitious – for example, sympathetic medicine, based on the idea that things in nature that bore a resemblance to an ailment could be used to treat it. Hence a plant that looked like a snake might be used to treat snake bites, or a yellow herb to treat jaundice.

<text>The , or DFS , was formed in 1933 to centralise all gliding activity in Germany, under the directorship of Professor Walter Georgii. It was formed by the nationalisation of the Rhön-Rossitten Gesellschaft (RRG) at Darmstadt.

The DFS was involved in producing training sailplanes for the Hitler Youth and Luftwaffe, as well as conducting research into advanced technologies such as flying wings and rocket propulsion. Notable DFS-produced aircraft include the DFS 230 transport glider (1600+ produced), the German counterpart to the British Airspeed Horsa glider, and the DFS 194, similar to the famous Messerschmitt Me 163 rocket fighter.

In 1938, following a fatal accident at the Wasserkuppe, DFS held a competition to design a more effective speed brake for gliders. The final design, produced by Wolfgang and Ulrich Hütter of Schempp-Hirth, is used to this day and generally referred to as &quot;Schempp-Hirth airbrakes&quot;.

<doc id="457673" wikidata="Q594446" url="?curid=457673" title="Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator">
<text>An implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) or automated implantable cardioverter defibrillator (AICD) is a device implantable inside the body, able to perform defibrillation, and depending on the type, cardioversion and pacing of the heart. The ICD is the first-line treatment and prophylactic therapy for patients at risk for sudden cardiac death due to ventricular fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia.

&quot;AICD&quot; was trademarked by the Boston Scientific corporation, so the more generic &quot;ICD&quot; is preferred terminology.

On average ICD batteries last about six to ten years. Advances in technology, such as batteries with more capacity or rechargeable batteries, may allow batteries to last over ten years. The leads (electrical cable wires connecting the device to the heart) have much longer average longevity, but can malfunction in various ways, specifically insulation failure or fracture of the conductor; thus, ICDs and leads generally require replacement after every 5 to 10 years.

The process of implantation of an ICD system is similar to implantation of an artificial pacemaker. In fact, ICDs are composed of an ICD generator and of wires. The first component or generator contains a computer chip or circuitry with RAM (memory), programmable software, a capacitor and a battery; this is implanted typically under the skin in the left upper chest. The second part of the system is an electrode wire or wires that, similar to pacemakers, are connected to the generator and passed through a vein to the right chambers of the heart. The lead usually lodges in the apex or septum of the right ventricle.

Just like pacemakers, ICDs can have a single wire or lead in the heart (in the right ventricle, single chamber ICD), two leads (in the right atrium and right ventricle, dual chamber ICD) or three leads (biventricular ICD, one in the right atrium, one in the right ventricle and one on the outer wall of the left ventricle). The difference between pacemakers and ICDs is that pacemakers are also available as temporary units and are generally designed to correct slow heart rates, i.e. bradycardia, while ICDs are often permanent safeguards against sudden life-threatening arrhythmias.

Recent developments include the subcutaneous ICD (S-ICD) which is placed entirely under the skin, leaving the vessels and heart untouched.  Implantation with an S-ICD is regarded as a procedure with even less risks, it is currently suggested for patients with previous history of infection or increased risk of infection. It is also recommended for very active patients, younger patients with will likely outlive their transvenous ICD (TV-ICD) leads and those with complicated anatomy/arterial access. S-ICDs are not able to be used in patients with ventricular tachycardia or bradycardia. 

==Living with an ICD==

People who have an implanted cardioverter-defibrillator can live full lives. Patients overall have either a sustained or improved quality of life after ICD implantation when compared to before ICD implantation. It may provide a strong degree of reassurance. As with a pacemaker, however, living with an ICD does impose some restrictions on the person&#x27;s lifestyle. 

===Physical activities===
Almost all forms of physical activities can be performed by patients with an ICD with moderation. All forms of sports that do not pose a risk of damaging the ICD or because of the underlying cardiomyopathy can be undertaken by the patient. Special care should be taken not to put excessive strain on the shoulder, arm and torso area where the ICD is implanted. Doing so may damage the ICD or the leads going from the ICD generator to the patient&#x27;s heart. Particularly to be avoided are exercises that cause the clavicle to be pulled down towards the ribs, such as lifting weights with the arm, on the ICD site, while standing.

=== Driving ===
ICD patients in the United States are prohibited from professional or commercial driving per the Cardiovascular Advisory Panel Guidelines for the Medical Examination of Commercial Motor Vehicle Drivers. A driving abstinence for private drivers is recommended following ICD implantation, but the timeframe is variable depending on the country (between 3 and 6 months for secondary prevention and 1–4 weeks for primary prevention). Following an appropriate ICD-therapy, a driving ban is recommended for 3–6 months depending on the country. After inappropriate ICD-therapy delivered for non-ventricular arrhythmias or due to the device malfunction, driving restrictions usually apply until the cause of the inappropriate therapy has been eliminated.

===Electro-magnetic equipment===
Equipment using magnets or generating magnetic fields, or any similar environment, must be avoided by patients with an ICD. As with other metallic objects, an ICD is normally a contraindication to the use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). However, several ICD manufacturers have recently introduced MR-Conditional ICDs, which allow the use of MRI under specified safe operating conditions.

===Quality of life===
Implantable cardioverter defibrillators have demonstrated clear life-saving benefits, while concerns about patient acceptance and psychological adjustment to the ICD have been the focus of much research. Researchers, including those from the field of cardiac psychology, have concluded that the quality of life (QoL) of ICD patients is at least equal to, or better than, that of those taking anti-arrhythmic medications. The largest study of examined 2,521 patients with stable heart failure in the SCD-HeFT trial. Results indicated that there were no differences between ICD-treated and medication-treated groups at 30 months in patient-reported QoL. Psychological adjustment following ICD implantation has also been well studied. In rare cases, the ICD can become infected and is usually bacterial in origin but other organisms such as certain fungi have occasionally been implicated. This is more likely to occur in people with diabetes, heart failure, kidney failure, or a suppressed immune system.

Anxiety is a common psychological side effect, with approximately 13–38% of ICD patients reporting clinically significant anxiety. The primary etiological factors contributing to anxiety in ICD patients have not been determined, however. Depressive symptoms are also common, but the incidence of these problems has been shown to be similar to those observed in other cardiac patient groups, with approximately 24–41% of patients with ICDs experiencing depressive symptoms. Problems in psychosocial adjustment to ICDs, including the experience of anxiety, among spouses or other romantic partners are also prevalent. This phenomenon may be related, at least in part, to shared shock anxiety and avoidance of physical and sexual contact.

=== Follow Up ===
Patients are generally required to follow up with their electrophysiologist cardiologist at regular intervals, mostly 3 to 6 months. At this time, many device manufactures have some form of home monitoring to allow for device data to be sent in electronically to the physician. Recent advances include app integration for home interrogation and remote care has been correlated with some mortality benefit.

Implantation of ICD is meant to prevent sudden cardiac death and is indicated under various conditions. Two broad but distinct categories are primary and secondary prevention. Primary prevention refers to patients who have not suffered a life-threatening arrhythmia episode. Secondary prevention has the strongest evidence for benefit and it refers to survivors of cardiac arrest secondary to ventricular fibrillation (VF) or hemodynamically unstable sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) after reversible causes are excluded.

Similarly, ICD use in primary prevention is to prevent cardiac death in patients who are at risk for sustained ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation. This population accounts for the bulk of all ICD implants. There are a multitude of guideline indications for ICD use in primary preventions with varying degree of supporting evidence. Periodically, both the American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) and European Society of Cardiology provide an update to this guideline. Some of the Class I indications are as follows:

* With Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF) ≤ 35% due to prior Myocardial Infarction (MI) who are at least 40 days post-MI and are in NYHA Functional Class II or III
* With Left Ventricular (LV) dysfunction due to prior MI who are at least 40 days post-MI, have an LVEF ≤ 30%, and are in NYHA Functional Class I
* With nonischemic Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) who have an LVEF ≤ 35% and who are in NYHA Functional Class II or III
* With nonsustained VT due to prior MI, LVEF &lt; 40%, and inducible VF or sustained VT at electrophysiological study
* With structural heart disease and spontaneous sustained VT, whether hemodynamically stable or unstable
* With syncope of undetermined origin with clinically relevant, hemodynamically significant sustained VT or VF induced at electrophysiological study

==Clinical trials==
A number of clinical trials have demonstrated the superiority of the ICD over AAD (antiarrhythmic drugs) in the prevention of death from malignant arrhythmias.
The SCD-HeFT trial (published in 2005) showed a significant all-cause mortality benefit for patients with ICD. Congestive heart failure patients that were implanted with an ICD had an all-cause death risk 23% lower than placebo and an absolute decrease in mortality of 7.2 percentage points after five years in the overall population.1
Reporting in 1999, the &quot;Antiarrhythmics Versus Implantable Defibrillators&quot; (AVID) trial consisted of 1,016 patients, and deaths in those treated with AAD were more frequent (&quot;n&quot; = 122) compared with deaths in the ICD groups (&quot;n&quot; = 80, &quot;p&quot; &lt; 0.001). In 2002 the MADITII trial showed benefit of ICD treatment in patients after myocardial infarction with reduced left ventricular function (EF&lt;30).

Initially ICDs were implanted via thoracotomy with defibrillator patches applied to the epicardium or pericardium. The device was attached via subcutaneous and transvenous leads to the device contained in a subcutaneous abdominal wall pocket. The device itself acts as an electrode. Most ICDs nowadays are implanted transvenously with the devices placed in the left pectoral region similar to pacemakers. Intravascular spring or coil electrodes are used to defibrillate. The devices have become smaller and less invasive as the technology advances. Current ICDs weigh only 70 grams and are about 12.9 mm thick.

A recent study by Birnie and colleagues at the University of Ottawa Heart Institute has demonstrated that ICDs are underused in both the United States and Canada. An accompanying editorial by Simpson of Queen&#x27;s University explores some of the economic, geographic, social and political reasons for this.

==History==
The development of the ICD was pioneered at Sinai Hospital in Baltimore by a team including Michel Mirowski, Morton Mower, Alois Langer, William Staewen, and Joseph &quot;Jack&quot; Lattuca. Mirowski teamed up with Mower and Staewen and together they commenced their research in 1969 but it was 11 years before they treated their first patient.

The work was commenced against much skepticism even by leading experts in the field of arrhythmias and sudden death. There was doubt that their ideas would ever become a clinical reality. In 1972 Bernard Lown, the inventor of the external defibrillator, and Paul Axelrod stated in the journal &quot;Circulation&quot; – &quot;The very rare patient who has frequent bouts of ventricular fibrillation is best treated in a coronary care unit and is better served by an effective anti-arrhythmic program or surgical correction of inadequate coronary blood flow or ventricular malfunction. In fact, the implanted defibrillator system represents an imperfect solution in search of a plausible and practical application.&quot;

The problems to be overcome were the design of a system which would allow detection of ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia. Despite the lack of financial backing and grants, they persisted and the first device was implanted in February 1980 at Johns Hopkins Hospital by Dr. Levi Watkins Jr.

The first devices required the chest to be cut open and a mesh electrode sewn onto the heart; the pulse generator was placed in the abdomen.

==Working mechanism==
ICDs constantly monitor the rate and rhythm of the heart and can deliver therapies, by way of an electrical shock, when the heart rate exceeds a preset number. More modern devices have software designed to attempt a discrimination between ventricular fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia (VT), and may try to pace the heart faster than its intrinsic rate in the case of VT, to try to break the tachycardia before it progresses to ventricular fibrillation. This is known as overdrive pacing, or anti-tachycardia pacing (ATP). ATP is only effective if the underlying rhythm is ventricular tachycardia, and is never effective if the rhythm is ventricular fibrillation.

Many modern ICDs use a combination of various methods to determine if a fast rhythm is normal, supraventricular tachycardia, ventricular tachycardia, or ventricular fibrillation.

&quot;Rate discrimination&quot; evaluates the rate of the lower chambers of the heart (the ventricles) and compares it to the rate in the upper chambers of the heart (the atria). If the rate in the atria is faster than or equal to the rate in the ventricles, then the rhythm is most likely not ventricular in origin, and is usually more benign. If this is the case, the ICD does not provide any therapy, or withholds it for a programmable length of time.

&quot;Rhythm discrimination&quot; will see how regular a ventricular tachycardia is. Generally, ventricular tachycardia is regular. If the rhythm is irregular, it is usually due to conduction of an irregular rhythm that originates in the atria, such as atrial fibrillation. In the picture, an example of torsades de pointes can be seen; this represents a form of irregular ventricular tachycardia. In this case, the ICD will rely on rate, not regularity, to make the correct diagnosis.

&quot;Morphology discrimination&quot; checks the morphology of every ventricular beat and compares it to what the ICD knows is the morphology of normally conducted ventricular impulse for the patient. This normal ventricular impulse is often an average of a multiple of normal beats of the patient acquired in the recent past and known as a template.

The integration of these various parameters is very complex, and clinically, the occurrence of inappropriate therapy is still occasionally seen and a challenge for future software advancements.

<text>In mathematics, a spline is a function defined piecewise by polynomials.
In interpolating problems, spline interpolation is often preferred to polynomial interpolation because it yields similar results, even when using low degree polynomials, while avoiding Runge&#x27;s phenomenon for higher degrees. 

In the computer science subfields of computer-aided design and computer graphics, the term &quot;spline&quot; more frequently refers to a piecewise polynomial (parametric) curve. Splines are popular curves in these subfields because of the simplicity of their construction, their ease and accuracy of evaluation, and their capacity to approximate complex shapes through curve fitting and interactive curve design.

The term spline comes from the flexible spline devices used by shipbuilders and draftsmen to draw smooth shapes.

==Introduction==

The term &quot;spline&quot; is used to refer to a wide class of functions that are used in applications requiring data interpolation and/or smoothing. The data may be either one-dimensional or multi-dimensional. Spline functions for interpolation are normally determined as the minimizers of suitable measures of roughness (for example integral squared curvature) subject to the interpolation constraints. Smoothing splines may be viewed as generalizations of interpolation splines where the functions are determined to minimize a weighted combination of the average squared approximation error over observed data and the roughness measure. For a number of meaningful definitions of the roughness measure, the spline functions are found to be finite dimensional in nature, which is the primary reason for their utility in computations and representation. For the rest of this section, we focus entirely on one-dimensional, polynomial splines and use the term &quot;spline&quot; in this restricted sense.

==History==

According to Gerald Farin, B-splines were explored as early as the nineteenth century by Nikolai Lobachevsky at Kazan University in Russia.

Before computers were used, numerical calculations were done by hand. Although piecewise-defined functions like the sign function or step function were used, polynomials were generally preferred because they were easier to work with. Through the advent of computers, splines have gained importance. They were first used as a replacement for polynomials in interpolation, then as a tool to construct smooth and flexible shapes in computer graphics.

It is commonly accepted that the first mathematical reference to splines is the 1946 paper by Schoenberg, which is probably the first place that the word &quot;spline&quot; is used in connection with smooth, piecewise polynomial approximation. However, the ideas have their roots in the aircraft and shipbuilding industries. In the foreword to (Bartels et al., 1987), Robin Forrest describes &quot;lofting&quot;, a technique used in the British aircraft industry during World War II to construct templates for airplanes by passing thin wooden strips (called &quot;splines&quot;) through points laid out on the floor of a large design loft, a technique borrowed from ship-hull design. For years the practice of ship design had employed models to design in the small. The successful design was then plotted on graph paper and the key points of the plot were re-plotted on larger graph paper to full size. The thin wooden strips provided an interpolation of the key points into smooth curves. The strips would be held in place at discrete points (called &quot;ducks&quot; by Forrest; Schoenberg used &quot;dogs&quot; or &quot;rats&quot;) and between these points would assume shapes of minimum strain energy. According to Forrest, one possible impetus for a mathematical model for this process was the potential loss of the critical design components for an entire aircraft should the loft be hit by an enemy bomb. This gave rise to &quot;conic lofting&quot;, which used conic sections to model the position of the curve between the ducks. Conic lofting was replaced by what we would call splines in the early 1960s based on work by J. C. Ferguson at Boeing and (somewhat later) by M.A. Sabin at British Aircraft Corporation.

The word &quot;spline&quot; was originally an East Anglian dialect word.

The use of splines for modeling automobile bodies seems to have several independent beginnings. Credit is claimed on behalf of de Casteljau at Citroën, Pierre Bézier at Renault, and Birkhoff, Garabedian, and de Boor at General Motors (see Birkhoff and de Boor, 1965), all for work occurring in the very early 1960s or late 1950s. At least one of de Casteljau&#x27;s papers was published, but not widely, in 1959. De Boor&#x27;s work at General Motors resulted in a number of papers being published in the early 1960s, including some of the fundamental work on B-splines.

Work was also being done at Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft, where two of the authors of (Ahlberg et al., 1967) — the first book-length treatment of splines — were employed, and the David Taylor Model Basin, by Feodor Theilheimer. The work at General Motors is detailed nicely in (Birkhoff, 1990) and (Young, 1997). Davis (1997) summarizes some of this material.

== Definition ==

We begin by limiting our discussion to polynomials in one variable. In this case, a spline is a piecewise polynomial function.
This function, call it , takes values from an interval and maps them to formula_1 the set of real numbers,
formula_2
We want to be piecewise defined. To accomplish this, let the interval be covered by ordered, disjoint subintervals,

formula_3

On each of these &quot;pieces&quot; of , we want to define a polynomial, call it .
formula_4
On the th subinterval of , is defined by ,

formula_5

The given points are called knots. The vector is called a knot vector for the spline.
If the knots are equidistantly distributed in the interval we say the spline is uniform, otherwise we say it is non-uniform.

If the polynomial pieces each have degree at most , then the spline is said to be of degree (or of order ).

If formula_6 in a neighborhood of , then the spline is said to be of smoothness (at least) formula_7 at . That is, at the two polynomial pieces and share common derivative values from the derivative of order 0 (the function value) up through the derivative of order (in other words, the two adjacent polynomial pieces connect with loss of smoothness of at most )

formula_8

A vector such that the spline has smoothness formula_7 at for is called a smoothness vector for the spline.

Given a knot vector , a degree , and a smoothness vector for , one can consider the set of all splines of degree having knot vector and smoothness vector . Equipped with the operation of adding two functions (pointwise addition) and taking real multiples of functions, this set becomes a real vector space. This spline space is commonly denoted by formula_10

In the mathematical study of polynomial splines the question of what happens when two knots, say and , are taken to approach one another and become coincident has an easy answer. The polynomial piece disappears, and the pieces and join with the sum of the smoothness losses for and .
That is,
formula_11 where .
This leads to a more general understanding of a knot vector. The continuity loss at any point can be considered to be the result of multiple knots located at that point, and a spline type can be completely characterized by its degree and its extended knot vector

formula_12

where is repeated times
for .

A parametric curve on the interval 
formula_13
is a spline curve if both and are spline functions of the same degree with the same extended knot vectors on that interval.

==Examples==
Suppose the interval is and the subintervals are . Suppose the polynomial pieces are to be of degree 2, and the pieces on and must join in value and first derivative (at ) while the pieces on and join simply in value (at ). This would define a type of spline for which

formula_14

would be a member of that type, and also

formula_15

would be a member of that type.
(Note: while the polynomial piece is not quadratic, the result is still called a quadratic spline. This demonstrates that the degree of a spline is the maximum degree of its polynomial parts.)
The extended knot vector for this type of spline would be .

The simplest spline has degree 0. It is also called a step function.
The next most simple spline has degree 1. It is also called a linear spline. A closed linear spline (i.e, the first knot and the last are the same) in the plane is just a polygon.

A common spline is the natural cubic spline. A cubic spline has degree 3 with continuity , i.e. the values and first and second derivatives are continuous. Natural means that the second derivatives of the spline polynomials are zero at the endpoints of the interval of interpolation.

formula_16

Thus, the graph of the spline is a straight line outside of the interval, but still smooth.

==Notes==
It might be asked what meaning more than multiple knots in a knot vector have, since this would lead to continuities like
formula_17
at the location of this high multiplicity. By convention, any such situation indicates a simple discontinuity between the two adjacent polynomial pieces. This means that if a knot appears more than times in an extended knot vector, all instances of it in excess of the th can be removed without changing the character of the spline, since all multiplicities , , , etc. have the same meaning. It is commonly assumed that any knot vector defining any type of spline has been culled in this fashion.

The classical spline type of degree used in numerical analysis has continuity
formula_18
which means that every two adjacent polynomial pieces meet in their value and first derivatives at each knot. The mathematical spline that most closely models the flat spline is a cubic (), twice continuously differentiable (), natural spline, which is a spline of this classical type with additional conditions imposed at endpoints and .

Another type of spline that is much used in graphics, for example in drawing programs such as Adobe Illustrator from Adobe Systems, has pieces that are cubic but has continuity only at most
formula_19
This spline type is also used in PostScript as well as in the definition of some computer typographic fonts.

Many computer-aided design systems that are designed for high-end graphics and animation use extended knot vectors,
for example Autodesk Maya.
Computer-aided design systems often use an extended concept of a spline known as a Nonuniform rational B-spline (NURBS).

If sampled data from a function or a physical object is available, spline interpolation is an approach to creating a spline that approximates that data.

==General expression for a &quot;C&quot;2 interpolating cubic spline==
The general expression for the th interpolating cubic spline at a point &quot;x&quot; with the natural condition can be found using the formula

formula_20

where
* formula_21 are the values of the second derivative at the th knot.
* formula_22
* formula_23 are the values of the function at the th knot.

==Representations and names ==
For a given interval and a given extended knot vector on that interval, the splines of degree form a vector space. Briefly this means that adding any two splines of a given type produces spline of that given type, and multiplying a spline of a given type by any constant produces a spline of that given type. The dimension of
the space containing all splines of a certain type can be counted from the extended knot vector:

formula_24
The dimension is equal to the sum of the degree plus the multiplicities
:formula_25
If a type of spline has additional linear conditions imposed upon it, then the resulting spline will lie in a subspace. The space of all natural cubic splines, for instance, is a subspace of the space of all cubic &quot;C&quot;2 splines.

The literature of splines is replete with names for special types of splines.
These names have been associated with:
* The choices made for representing the spline, for example:
** using basis functions for the entire spline (giving us the name B-splines)
** using Bernstein polynomials as employed by Pierre Bézier to represent each polynomial piece (giving us the name Bézier splines)
* The choices made in forming the extended knot vector, for example:
** using single knots for continuity and spacing these knots evenly on (giving us uniform splines)
** using knots with no restriction on spacing (giving us nonuniform splines)
* Any special conditions imposed on the spline, for example:
** enforcing zero second derivatives at and (giving us natural splines)
** requiring that given data values be on the spline (giving us interpolating splines)
Often a special name was chosen for a type of spline satisfying two or more of the main items above. For example, the Hermite spline is a spline that is expressed using Hermite polynomials to represent each of the individual polynomial pieces. These are most often used with ; that is, as Cubic Hermite splines. In this degree they may additionally be chosen to be only tangent-continuous (); which implies that all interior knots are double. Several methods have been invented to fit such splines to given data points; that is, to make them into interpolating splines, and to do so by estimating plausible tangent values where each two polynomial pieces meet (giving us Cardinal splines, Catmull-Rom splines, and Kochanek-Bartels splines, depending on the method used).

For each of the representations, some means of evaluation must be found so that values of the spline can be produced on demand. For those representations that express each individual polynomial piece in terms of
some basis for the degree polynomials, this is conceptually straightforward:
* For a given value of the argument , find the interval in which it lies formula_26
* Look up the polynomial basis chosen for that interval formula_27
* Find the value of each basis polynomial at : formula_28
* Look up the coefficients of the linear combination of those basis polynomials that give the spline on that interval 
* Add up that linear combination of basis polynomial values to get the value of the spline at :
formula_29
However, the evaluation and summation steps are often combined in clever ways. For example, Bernstein polynomials are a basis for polynomials that can be evaluated in linear combinations efficiently using special recurrence relations. This is the essence of De Casteljau&#x27;s algorithm, which features in Bézier curves and Bézier splines).

For a representation that defines a spline as a linear combination of basis splines, however, something more sophisticated is needed. The de Boor algorithm is an efficient method for evaluating B-splines.

<doc id="457681" wikidata="Q3773198" url="?curid=457681" title="Liberal People's Party (Norway, 1972)">
<text>The Liberal People&#x27;s Party (, DLF) was a social liberal political party in Norway, established by a split in the Liberal Party over the issue of Norway&#x27;s accession to the European Economic Community in 1972. The party was originally called the New People&#x27;s Party until changing its name in 1980.

==History==
The new party, formed by the pro-EEC minority of the Liberal Party, originally wanted to call itself the &quot;Popular Party - New Liberals&quot; (&quot;Folkepartiet Nye Venstre&quot;), but was denied the use of this name, as it was deemed too similar to the Liberal Party, which in Norway is called &quot;Venstre&quot; (literally &quot;Left&quot;). Instead, the party called itself the New People&#x27;s Party (&quot;Det Nye Folkepartiet&quot;). The name was in 1980 changed to the Liberal People&#x27;s Party.

At the time of the split, eight of the thirteen Liberal Party MPs joined the new party. At the 1973 parliamentary election, the Liberal People&#x27;s Party however won merely one seat, from Hordaland (the Liberal Party won two seats). At the next election, in 1977, the Liberal People&#x27;s Party lost this seat, and was never represented in Parliament again. The party&#x27;s popularity declined throughout the 1980s. In the local elections in 1987 the two parties ran on common lists in several counties and municipalities. In 1988, it was decided to officially merge back together with the Liberal Party.

In 1992, some of the old members decided to recreate DLF, reviving the Liberal People&#x27;s Party name. However, the new party was later taken over by a group of free-market libertarians and former members of the Progress Party. The party was closed in 2017.

<text>Peter Pilz (born 22 January 1954) is an Austrian politician (JETZT). From 1986 to 2017, he was a member of the Austrian Green Party.

==Political career==
Born in Kapfenberg, Styria, Pilz has been a member of the Austrian Parliament (&quot;Nationalrat&quot;) between 1986 and 1991 and since 1999. From 1992 to 1994 he also was federal spokesperson of the Greens. His main area of interest is legal matters and political corruption. Commonly known wearing a black jacket and a red, grey or green T-shirt, he was the first Austrian politician to keep a blog on the Internet.

In January 2005, Pilz made international news when he called for Arnold Schwarzenegger to be stripped of his Austrian citizenship. As Governor of California, Schwarzenegger had refused to intercede in the execution of a convicted murderer, Donald Beardslee. Pilz pointed to an Austrian law which prohibits any Austrian from taking part in, or ordering, an execution.

A few months later, Pilz claimed that a person whom he called &quot;Zeuge D&quot; (German: &quot;witness D&quot;) has information that Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad had participated in the murder of 3 Kurds in Vienna in 1989. According to him the Austrian police had already contacted the witness, who supposedly lived in France, but this was denied by the Austrian Ministry of Justice.

On 25 July 2017, with the disappointment of Green leadership and lack of responses in refugee and migrant crisis, he announced his independent campaign for the elections to the Austrian parliament in the autumn. He headed the &quot;Peter Pilz List&quot;, a group of intellectuals, artists and entrepreneurs, critical toward the establishment. His new party cleared the 4 percent threshold for entering parliament in the election and handed a major defeat to the Greens, whose support fell to 3.9 percent from more than 12 percent in 2013.

On 4 November 2017, after sexual harassment allegations came to light, Pilz announced that he would not take his seat in the National Council, and the seat was assumed by Martha Bissmann. On 22 May 2018, Pilz and his party announced that he would return to parliament before summer, as the trial against him had ended.

<text>Douglas Gordon Lilburn (2 November 19156 June 2001) was a New Zealand composer.

==Early life==
Lilburn was born in Whanganui and spent his early years on the family sheep farm in the upper Turakina River valley at Drysdale. He attended Waitaki Boys&#x27; High School from 1930 to 1933, before moving to Christchurch to study journalism and music over the next three years at Canterbury University College, then part of the University of New Zealand. In 1936 his career in music was set when his tone poem &quot;Forest&quot; won visiting composer Percy Grainger&#x27;s national composition competition. In 1937 he began studying at the Royal College of Music in London, tutored in composition by Ralph Vaughan Williams until 1939. The two men remained close: in later years Lilburn sent Vaughan Williams gifts of New Zealand honey, knowing that the older man was fond of it. Letters of thanks from Vaughan Williams in 1947 and 1948 confirm this.

Lilburn&#x27;s early works display the influence of Jean Sibelius; the symphonic poem &quot;Forest&quot; (1936), in which Lilburn depicts the autumn scenery of Mount Peel in South Canterbury, finds its composer, according to Robert Hoskins, &quot;tracking Sibelius through the shadowy woods, keeping his own distance, but measuring his own hesitancy until he takes his own road.&quot; Furthermore, the &quot;Phantasy Quartet&quot; (1939) contains &quot;Sibelian pizzicatos&quot;.

==Career==
Lilburn returned to New Zealand in 1940 and served as guest conductor in Wellington for three months with the NBS String Orchestra. He shifted to Christchurch in 1941 and worked as a freelance composer and teacher until 1947. Between 1946 and 1949 and again in 1951, he was Composer-in-Residence at the Cambridge Summer Music Schools.

During these years he was heavily involved in New Zealand arts activity, and became friends with other artists such as Allen Curnow, Denis Glover, Rita Angus, and Alistair Campbell.

In 1947, Lilburn moved to Wellington to take up a position at Victoria University as part-time lecturer in music. He became a full-time lecturer in 1949, senior lecturer in 1955, was appointed Associate Professor of Music in 1963 and Professor with a personal chair in music in 1970. Following visits to studios in Europe and Canada in 1963, Lilburn founded the electronic music studio at the university in 1966 — the first in Australasia — and was its director until 1979, a year before his retirement.

==Later years==
Lilburn was awarded an Honorary Doctorate from the University of Otago in 1969 and in 1978 was presented with the Citation for Services to New Zealand Music by the Composers Association of New Zealand. On 6 February 1988, Lilburn became the eighth appointee to The Order of New Zealand.

Prizes and Scholarships included:
*the Percy Grainger Competition, 1936, for his tone poem &quot;Forest&quot;
*the Cobbett Prize, Royal College of Music, 1939 for &quot;Phantasy for String Quartet&quot;
*the Foli Scholarship and Hubert Parry Prize, Royal College of Music, 1939
*three out of four of the prizes in the New Zealand National Centennial Music Celebrations Competitions, 1940
*the Philip Neill Memorial Prize 1944.

Lilburn was founder of Wai-te-ata Music Press in 1967 and the Lilburn Trust of the Alexander Turnbull Library, Wellington, 1984. His writings include &quot;A Search for Tradition&quot;, a talk given at the first Cambridge Summer School of Music in January 1946 (Alexander Turnbull Library, Wellington 1984) and &quot;A Search for Language&quot;, a University of Otago Open Lecture, March 1969 (Alexander Turnbull Library, 1985).

==Legacy==

Lilburn&#x27;s former house, at 22 Ascot Street, was purchased by the Lilburn Residence Trust, a charitable trust based in Wellington, on 5 August 2005. The trust is currently offering use of the residence to the Creative New Zealand/Jack C. Richards Composer-in-Residence at the New Zealand School of Music.

The Lilburn Trust funds the Student Composition and Performance Awards at five universities around New Zealand. The trust is administered under the Alexander Turnbull Library Endowment Trust.

The New Zealand Symphony Orchestra has recorded most of Lilburn&#x27;s major works, including the three symphonies composed from 1949 to 1961 and many of the other symphonic works. His &quot;A Song of Islands&quot; was given its American premiere on 17 November 2012, by the Fort Wayne Philharmonic Orchestra, conducted by James Judd, the former music director of the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra.

The Douglas Lilburn Auditorium forms part of the wider Christchurch Town Hall complex.

==Personal life==
Although he had an affair with the painter Rita Angus, who became pregnant but miscarried, his later life was characterised by intimate relationships with men.

<doc id="457686" wikidata="Q6152188" url="?curid=457686" title="Jane Elliott">
<text>Jane Elliott (&#x27;Jennison; born November 30, 1933) is an American diversity educator. As a schoolteacher, she became known for her &quot;Blue eyes/Brown eyes&quot; exercise, which she first conducted with her third-grade class on April 5, 1968, the day after the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. The publication of compositions which the children had written about the experience in the local newspaper led to much broader media interest in it.

The classroom exercise was filmed in 1970, becoming the documentary &quot;The Eye of the Storm&quot;. PBS series &quot;Frontline&quot; featured a reunion of the 1970 class, as well as Elliott&#x27;s work with adults, in its 1985 episode &quot;A Class Divided&quot;. Invitations to speak and to conduct her exercise eventually led Elliott to give up school teaching and to become a full-time public speaker against discrimination. She has directed the exercise and lectured on its effects in many places throughout the world. She also has conducted the exercise with college students, as seen in the 2001 documentary &quot;The Angry Eye&quot;.

==Early life and career==
Elliott was born in 1933 to Lloyd and Margaret (Benson) Jennison on her family&#x27;s farm in or near Riceville, Iowa. She was the fourth of several children.

In 1952, after graduating from high school, Elliott attended the Iowa State Teachers College (now the University of Northern Iowa), where she attained an emergency elementary teaching certificate in five quarters. In 1953, she began teaching in a one-room school in Randall.

==Motivation to teach about racism&#x27;s effects==
On the evening of April 4, 1968, Elliott turned on her television and learned of the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. She says she vividly remembers a scene in which a white reporter pointed his microphone toward a local black leader and asked things like &quot;When &quot;our&quot; leader [John F. Kennedy] was killed several years ago, his widow held us together. Who&#x27;s going to control &quot;your&quot; people?&quot;

Elliott then decided to combine a lesson she had planned about Native Americans with a lesson she had planned about Martin Luther King Jr. for February&#x27;s Hero of the Month project. At the moment she was watching the news of King&#x27;s death, Elliott says she was ironing a teepee for use in a lesson unit about Native Americans. To tie the two lessons together, she used the Sioux prayer &quot;Oh great spirit, keep me from ever judging a man until I have walked in his moccasins.&quot;
She wanted to give her small-town, all-white students the experience of walking in a &quot;colored child&#x27;s moccasins for a day&quot;.

==First exercise involving eye color==
Steven Armstrong was the first child to arrive in Elliott&#x27;s classroom. Referring to Martin Luther King Jr., he asked, &quot;Why&#x27;d they shoot that King?&quot; After the rest of the class arrived, Elliott asked them how they think it feels to be a black boy or girl. She suggested to the class it would be hard for them to understand discrimination without experiencing it themselves and then asked the children if they would like to find out. The children agreed with a chorus of &quot;yeah&quot;. She decided to base the exercise on eye color rather than skin color to show the children what racial segregation would be like.

At first, there was resistance among the students in the minority group to the idea that brown-eyed children were better than blue-eyed children. To counter this, Elliott lied to the children by stating melanin was linked to their higher intelligence and learning ability. Shortly thereafter, this initial resistance fell away. Those who were deemed &quot;superior&quot; became arrogant, bossy, and otherwise unpleasant to their &quot;inferior&quot; classmates. Their grades on simple tests were better, and they completed mathematical and reading tasks that had seemed outside their ability before. The &quot;inferior&quot; classmates also transformed – into timid and subservient children who scored more poorly on tests, and even during recess isolated themselves, including those who had previously been dominant in the class. These children&#x27;s academic performance suffered, even with tasks that had been simple before.

The next Monday, Elliott reversed the exercise, making the blue-eyed children superior. While the blue-eyed children did taunt the brown-eyed children in ways similar to what had occurred the previous day, Elliott reports it was much less intense. To reflect on the experience, she asked the children to write down what they had learned.

==Reactions and public attention==
The compositions the children wrote about the experience were printed in the &quot;Riceville Recorder&quot; on page 4 on April 18, 1968, under the headline &quot;How Discrimination Feels&quot;, and the story was picked up by the Associated Press. As a result of the Associated Press article, Elliott was invited to appear on &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot;. After she spoke about her exercise in a short interview segment, the audience reaction was instant as hundreds of calls came into the show&#x27;s telephone switchboard, much of it negative. An often-quoted letter stated, &quot;How dare you try this cruel experiment out on white children? Black children grow up accustomed to such behavior, but white children, there&#x27;s no way they could possibly understand it. It&#x27;s cruel to white children and will cause them great psychological damage.&quot;

The publicity Elliott was getting did not make her popular in Riceville. When she walked into the teachers&#x27; lounge the day after her &quot;Tonight Show&quot; appearance, several other teachers walked out. When she went downtown to do errands, she heard whispers. When her oldest daughter went to the girls&#x27; bathroom in junior high, she came out of a stall to see a hateful message scrawled in red lipstick for her on the mirror. In a 2003 interview, Elliot said that about 20% of the Riceville community was still furious with her over what she did that day in 1968 and that some of those still called her &quot;n-word lover&quot;, but that she was grateful for the other 80%.

As news of her exercise spread, Elliott appeared on more television shows and started to repeat the exercise in professional training days for adults. On December 15, 1970, Elliott staged the experience to adult educators at a White House Conference on Children and Youth.

In 1970, ABC produced a documentary about Elliott called &quot;The Eye of the Storm&quot;, which made her even more nationally known. Subsequently, William Peters wrote two books—&quot;A Class Divided&quot; and &quot;A Class Divided: Then and Now&quot;—about her and the exercise. &quot;A Class Divided&quot; was turned into a PBS &quot;Frontline&quot; documentary in 1985 and included a reunion of the schoolchildren featured in &quot;The Eye of the Storm&quot;, for which Elliott received The Hillman Prize. A televised edition of the exercise was shown on Channel 4 on October 29, 2009, entitled &quot;The Event: How Racist Are You?&quot; This documentary was intended, according to the producers in their agreement with Jane Elliott, to create an awareness of the effects of racist behavior. After the exercise, Elliott said the result &quot;wasn&#x27;t as successful as I am accustomed to being&quot;, leaving journalist Andrew Anthony with the &quot;nagging suspicion that she&#x27;s more excited by white fear than she is by black success.&quot;

Elliott was featured by Peter Jennings on ABC as &quot;Person of the Week&quot; on April 24, 1992. She is listed on the timeline of 30 notable educators by textbook editor McGraw-Hill along with Confucius, Plato, Booker T. Washington, and Maria Montessori. She has been invited to speak at 350 colleges and universities and has appeared on &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot; five times.

In November 2016, Elliott&#x27;s name was added to the BBC&#x27;s annual list of &quot;100 Women&quot;.

==Origin of workplace diversity training==
Elliott is considered to be the forerunner of diversity training, with the &quot;Blue Eyes/Brown Eyes&quot; exercise as the basis of much of what is now called diversity training. She has done such training for corporations such as General Electric, Exxon, AT&amp;T, and IBM, as well as lectured to the FBI, IRS, US Navy, US Department of Education, and US Postal Service.

The Riceville school system granted Elliott unpaid leave to conduct workshops and training that were based on her exercise to organizations outside of her school system. However, the increasing demands to be away from the classroom eventually caused problems with her public school teaching career. Elliott left teaching in the mid-1980s to devote herself full-time to diversity training, redeveloping her classroom exercise for the corporate world. This was promoted positively as a way to promote teamwork, profits, and a &quot;winning together&quot; atmosphere. For this corporate exercise, Elliott divides a multiracial group based on the color of their eyes and then subjects the blue-eyed individuals to a withering regime of humiliation and contempt. In only a few hours, Elliott&#x27;s treatment makes the blue-eyed workers become distracted and despondent, stumbling over the simplest commands.

Companies found the idea of offering such training attractive, not only because in the 1970s and 1980s there were increasing numbers of people of color in their organizations, but also because of U.S. court rulings and federal policies to promote multiculturalism brought about by pressure from civil rights groups during the same two decades.

Many companies at that time came to see diversity training as a way to ward off negative legal action and publicity. Elliott said, &quot;If you can&#x27;t think of any other reason for getting rid of racism, think of it as a real money saver.&quot; Elliott-inspired diversity training has been used outside the United States. When the &quot;Race Relations Amendment Act 2000&quot; passed in the United Kingdom, it listed 100 diversity training firms in the Diversity Directory. According to a survey by the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development, 70% of those firms have diversity policies in which diversity training plays a major role. Many of these courses follow Elliott&#x27;s model in regards to understanding the issues presented.

==Legacy of the original exercise==
Dean Weaver, who was superintendent of Riceville schools from 1972 to 1979, thought Elliott was an outstanding teacher who did things differently and made other teachers envious of her success. Ex-principal Steve Harnack commented she was excellent at teaching academics and suggested she would have had fewer problems with the community if she had involved parents. Elliott&#x27;s former colleague Ruth Setka said: &quot;I think third grade was too young for what she did. Junior high, maybe. Little children don&#x27;t like uproar in the classroom. And what she did caused an uproar. Everyone&#x27;s tired of her. I&#x27;m tired of hearing about her and her experiment and how everyone here is a racist. That&#x27;s not true. Let&#x27;s just move on.&quot;

===Academic research===
Academic research into Elliott&#x27;s exercise shows moderate results in reducing long-term prejudice but is inconclusive on the question of whether the possible psychological harm outweighs the potential benefits. Two professors of education in England, Ivor Goodson and Pat Sikes, argue that what Elliott did was unethical, calling the exercise psychologically and emotionally damaging. They also stated ethical concerns pertaining to the fact that the children were not told of the purpose of the exercise beforehand.

Measured results of the diversity training for adults are moderate. The outcomes of a 1990 research study by the Utah State University were that virtually all the subjects reported the experience was meaningful for them. However, the statistical evidence supporting the effectiveness of the activity for prejudice reduction was moderate; and virtually all the participants, as well as the simulation facilitator, reported stress from the simulation.

Another program evaluation in 2003, conducted by Tracie Stewart at the University of Georgia, showed white college students had significantly more positive attitudes toward Asian-American and Latino individuals, but only marginally more positive attitudes toward African-American individuals. In some courses, participants can feel frustrated about &quot;their inability to change&quot; and instead begin to feel anger against the very groups to which they are supposed to be more sensitive. It can also lead to anxiety because people become hyper-sensitive about being offensive or being offended. There appears to be a lack of very good measures for determining the long-term outcomes of these training initiatives.

In a 2003 study, Murdoch University included the &quot;Blue Eyes/Brown Eyes&quot; exercise in their list of &quot;both successful and unsuccessful&quot; strategies to reduce racism, as opposed to, among others, more successful strategies like dialogues about race, and the debunking of myths.

==Personal life==
Elliott was married to Darald Elliott (1934–2013) from 1955 until his death, and she has four children. They maintained residences in Osage, Iowa and Sun City, California. On May 24, 2019, Jane Elliott was awarded the honorary degree &quot;Doctor of Humane Letters&quot; by CSU Bakersfield.

Ding Junhui was born on 1 April 1987, in Yixing, Jiangsu. At eight years old, Ding accompanied his father, a pool enthusiast, who wanted to practice with a local pool expert. When his father went for a toilet break, Ding took the cue and played with the professional. Ding won the game before his father returned. Since then, Ding&#x27;s parents supported him in cue sports training, particularly snooker. At age nine, he was taken by his father to the training centre of the Chinese national snooker team near Shanghai and persuaded his mother to sell their home and grocery business so Ding could continue playing snooker as a career. The family moved to Dongguan, Guangdong, and Ding left formal education at age 11 to practice snooker for eight hours each day.

==Career==
===Early career===
Ding rose to international prominence in 2002 at age 15, when he won the Asian Under-21 Championship, the Asian Championship, and became the youngest ever winner of the IBSF World Under-21 Championship. He was unable to progress much in 2003 when both Asian tournaments were canceled because of the 2002–03 SARS virus outbreak, but he reached the semi-finals of the IBSF World Under-21 Championship, and the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association (WPBSA) awarded him a concession to play on the main snooker tour, which enabled him to turn professional in September 2003. In the same year, Ding became the number-one-ranked player in China.

===First UK Championship and reaching the top-16 (2004–2007)===
In February 2004, Ding was awarded a wildcard entry to the Masters held in London. In the wildcard round, he beat the world number 16 player Joe Perry. In the first round, he lost 5–6 to Stephen Lee after leading 5–2. In April 2005, Ding celebrated his 18th birthday by reaching the final of the China Open in Beijing, defeating world top 16 ranked players Peter Ebdon, Marco Fu, and Ken Doherty. In the final, Ding beat the world number three Stephen Hendry by 9–5 to win his first ranking tournament. The match was watched by 110 million people on China&#x27;s national sports channel CCTV-5; it was the largest television audience recorded for a snooker match. In December 2005, Ding beat Jimmy White, Paul Hunter, and Joe Perry to reach the final of the UK Championship. In the final, he beat Steve Davis by 10–6 to become the first player from outside the UK to win the tournament. Ding&#x27;s provisional world ranking rose from 62 at the start of the 2005–06 season to 27 at the end of the season.

At the 2006 China Open, Ding lost 2–6 in the semi-finals to eventual winner Mark Williams. During the Northern Ireland Trophy event, he beat Stephen Lee 6–1 in the semi-finals. In the final, Ding defeated Ronnie O&#x27;Sullivan 9–6 to win his third ranking tournament, becoming the third person under 20 to do so after O&#x27;Sullivan and John Higgins. In December 2006, Ding won three gold medals at the 2006 Asian Games, winning the single, double, and team snooker competitions. The following week, he reached the quarter-finals of the 2006 UK Championship as the defending champion, but lost 5–9 to his practice partner and eventual winner Peter Ebdon. Ding ended the 2006–07 season ranked world number nine, which was his first top-ten placement.

===Youngest maximum break and wildcard Masters finalist (2007–2009)===

In January 2007, Ding defeated Cao Xinlong 5–4 to reach the final of the Chinese National Championship in his home town of Yixing, Jiangsu. He defeated Xiao Guodong in the final by 6–2 to become the national champion again. On 14 January, Ding made a 147 break in his first-round match against Anthony Hamilton at the Masters, which was Ding&#x27;s first maximum break and the first maximum break made at the competition since Kirk Stevens&#x27; in 1984. The break made Ding the youngest player to make a televised 147—a record previously held by Ronnie O&#x27;Sullivan—and the first Chinese player to make a televised maximum. Ding played O&#x27;Sullivan in the final, becoming the second-youngest player and the first Asian player to reach a Masters&#x27; final.

After Ding won the first two frames, O&#x27;Sullivan went on to dominate the match. This, along with the boisterous and hostile nature of the London crowd, led Ding to leave the table in tears during the twelfth frame when he was trailing 3–8 in the best-of-19-frames contest. Ding appeared resigned to defeat, taking little time to consider his shot selection, and shook hands with O&#x27;Sullivan after the frame. O&#x27;Sullivan consoled Ding and they walked arm-in-arm to the backstage area. Because it was the last frame before the mid-session interval, it was uncertain whether Ding had conceded the match. O&#x27;Sullivan won the match in the first frame after the interval; Ding later said he thought the match was a &quot;best of 17&quot;.

Ding was defeated in the first round of the next two consecutive tournaments, losing 2–5 to Stephen Maguire in the 2007 Malta Cup and 1–5 to Jamie Cope in the Welsh Open. In March 2007, Ding qualified for the televised stages of the World Championship for the first time after beating Mark Davis in the final qualifying round. His losing streak in ranking tournaments continued, with a 3–5 loss to Barry Hawkins in the first round of the China Open and a 2–10 loss against O&#x27;Sullivan at the World Championship. Despite this, Ding ended the 2006–07 season ranked world number 11.

The following season, Ding was consistent, reaching the last 16 of all-but-one ranking event. However, he failed to reach a single semi-final, causing him to drop to number 13 in the world rankings. At the 2008 World Snooker Championship, Ding reached the second round for the first time, beating Marco Fu 10–9 before losing 7–13 to Stephen Hendry. During the 2007 Premier League Snooker, Ding recorded 495 unanswered points (most points without reply) against Stephen Hendry, setting a record for the most unanswered points in any professional snooker tournament. The record was surpassed in 2014 when Ronnie O&#x27;Sullivan recorded 556 unanswered points against Ricky Walden.

Ding started the 2008–09 season on a high, winning the Jiangsu Classic after beating Ryan Day 4–0 in the semi-final and Mark Selby 6–5 in the final. In October, he participated in the third event of the World Series of Snooker. Ding won the event after defeating Ken Doherty 6–4 in the final. In the fourth event in November, Ding defeated Mark Selby 4–2 in the semi-final, before losing 0–5 to John Higgins in the final. On 16 December, in his second-round match against John Higgins at the 2008 UK Championship, Ding scored a maximum 147 break in the third frame.

===Second UK Championship (2009/2010)===
Ding began the 2009/2010 season by reaching the quarter-finals of the Shanghai Masters. He reached the final of the Grand Prix by defeating Matthew Stevens 5–4 in the first round, Stephen Maguire 5–1 in the second round, Peter Ebdon 5–2 in the quarter-finals, and Mark Williams 6–1 in the semi-finals, losing 4–9 to Neil Robertson in the final. At the 2009 UK Championship, Ding reached the final after defeating Mike Dunn 9–5, Shaun Murphy 9–3, Ali Carter 9–8, and Stephen Maguire 9–5.

He lost 6–10 to Mark Williams despite leading 5–4 at the end of the first session. At the World Championship, Ding defeated Stuart Pettman 10–1 in the first round. He lost 10–13 against Shaun Murphy in the second round. Ding ended the season ranked world number five, an increase of eight places from the previous season.

===Masters winner (2010/2011)===
At the 2010 Wuxi Classic, Ding lost 8–9 in the final despite leading 8–2. Ding reached the second round of the Shanghai Masters and the quarter-finals of the World Open, where he lost 1–5 to Jamie Cope and 2–3 to Mark Williams. Ding failed to defend his 2010 UK Championship title, losing 8–9 against Mark Allen. In January 2011, Ding reached his second Masters final, beating Jamie Cope 6–3 in the semi-final. Ding won the Masters for the first time, beating Marco Fu 10–4 in the first-ever all-Chinese Masters final.

Ding had a career-best run at the 2011 World Snooker Championship. He beat Jamie Burnett 10–2 in the first round, advancing to the last 16 of the World Championship for the fourth consecutive year. He played Stuart Bingham in the second round; he was losing 9–12 with his opponent needing one frame for victory but Ding made a comeback, winning four consecutive frames to win 13–12 and reach the quarter-finals of the world championship for the first time in his career. In his quarter-final with Mark Selby, Ding led 10–6 after the first two sessions of the match. Selby built strong momentum by winning the first four frames of the last session to level at 10–10. Ding won the match 13–10 to set up a semi-final against Judd Trump. In their semi-final, Ding and Trump were level at 12–12 after the third session. In the last session, Trump built momentum and led 14–12 but Ding won the next three frames with a 138 break to tie Mark King for highest tournament break and a 119 break. Ding lost the next three frames and lost the match 15–17. He ended the season with a career-high ranking of world number four.

===Fifth ranking event win (2011/2012)===
At the 2011 Wuxi Classic, Ding lost 5–6 to Mark Selby in the semi-finals, failing to reach the tournament&#x27;s final for the first time. At the World Cup, Ding and Liang Wenbo partnered to represent China. They won the final, 4–2, against Northern Ireland. Ding lost 2–5 against Stuart Bingham in the first round of the Australian Goldfields Open.

He won the 2012 Championship League tournament and a place in the 2012 Premier League. Ding reached the semi-finals of the China Open but was eliminated after losing 3–6 to eventual winner Peter Ebdon. Ding ended the season with a defeat in the first round of the World Championship, losing 9–10 to Ryan Day having had a 9–6 lead. After the match, Ding criticised the condition of the tables at the event and the attitude of the audience, saying both were &quot;rubbish&quot;. He finished the year ranked world number 11, having dropped seven places during the season.

===Players Tour Championship (2012/2013)===
Ding did not progress past the second round of the first six ranking events of the 2012–13 season and found himself ranked world number 11 in December.&lt;ref name=&quot;2012/13&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; He won the minor-ranking Scottish Open, defeating Anthony McGill in the final. Ding&#x27;s form then improved; at the Welsh Open, he beat Mark King, Mark Allen, and Robert Milkins to reach the semi-finals, where he was beaten 5–6 by Stuart Bingham. At the World Open, he was defeated 0–5 by John Higgins in the quarter-finals. His title at the Scottish Open formed part of the Players Tour Championship events. Ding finished sixth on the order of merit to qualify for the finals.

At the finals, Ding made the fifth 147 of his career in the first frame of his quarter-final against Allen and made two more century breaks in a 4–3 win. He beat Kurt Maflin 4–0 in the semi-finals; in the final, he recovered from 0–3 against Neil Robertson to take his sixth ranking title with a 4–3 win. Ding made eight century breaks in the 20 frames he won during the tournament; no other player scored more than one. His poor form in tournaments played in China continued; he was beaten 3–5 by Barry Hawkins in the first round of the China Open. Ding beat veteran Alan McManus 10–5 in the first round of the World Championship and recovered from 2–6 after the first session against Mark King in the second round to lead 9–7 after the next session and won 13–9. Ding faced Barry Hawkins in the quarter-finals and played inconsistently throughout the match, losing 7–13. His end-of-season world ranking was 10.

===Three consecutive ranking wins (2013/2014)===
In the second round of the 2013 Wuxi Classic, Ding lost 1–5 to Joe Perry. At the minor-ranking Bluebell Wood Open, he made a rare 146 break while beating Jimmy Robertson in the quarter-finals before losing 3–4 to Marco Fu in the semi-finals.&lt;ref name=&quot;2013/14&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2013, Ding won his seventh ranking event title at the Shanghai Masters. The final against Xiao Guodong was the first all-Chinese final of a ranking event in the history of snooker. Ding made a century break and seven more breaks above 50 to win 10–6. He then played at the Ruhr Open, a minor-ranking event, losing 1–4 to Mark Allen in the final.

Following that, Ding played in the first Indian Open, defeating Aditya Mehta 5–0 in the final to become the first player to win back-to-back major-ranking event titles in the same season since Ronnie O&#x27;Sullivan in 2003. Ding continued dominating the game in the following major ranking event, the International Championship, where he beat Graeme Dott 9–7 in the semi-finals with a 63-point clearance in the last frame. In the final—the second all-Chinese ranking event final in three ranking events—Ding and Marco Fu compiled seven century breaks; Ding five and Fu two. Ding rallied from 8–9 down to win the final two frames and became the first player to win three consecutive major-ranking events since Stephen Hendry won five consecutively in 1990.

After his hat-trick, Ding reached world number three in the rankings for the first time in his career, before reaching number two just behind Neil Robertson. Ding won two more ranking titles; the German Masters, beating Judd Trump 9–5 in the final, and the China Open by beating Robertson 10–5 in the final to equal Hendry&#x27;s season record of five wins. He was also the runner-up in the Welsh Open to Ronnie O&#x27;Sullivan. At the World Championship, however, Ding was defeated by world number 75 Michael Wasley 10–9 in the first round, which Ding had led 6–3 and 9–8. Ding finished the season ranked world number two—a career high—and was held off the number-one spot by Mark Selby, who won the World Championship. Ding was fined £5,000 and referred to the WPBSA Disciplinary Committee by the WSL for failing to attend their awards dinner.

===2014/2015===
At the start of the 2014–15 season, Ding failed to qualify for the televised stages of the 2014 Wuxi Classic, losing 0–5 to Oliver Brown in the qualifiers. Ding, however, then won the Yixing Open with a 4–2 victory over Michael Holt in the final. At the Shanghai Masters, he was defeated 6–4 by Stuart Bingham in the semi-finals after losing the last four frames of the match. Ronnie O&#x27;Sullivan eliminated Ding 6–4 in the semi-finals of the Champion of Champions.
In the third round of the 2014 UK Championship, Ding fought from 1–5 down to send his match against James Cahill to a deciding frame. Ding recovered from needing three snookers in the tenth frame when world 100-ranked Cahill left a free ball. In the final frame, however, Ding missed a red when on a break of 32, which allowed Cahill a chance to knock him out, which he did. Despite the loss, Ding became the 11th world number one and first from Asia thanks to early eliminations of Mark Selby and Neil Robertson.

Ding held the top spot for a week before Robertson reclaimed it. Ding&#x27;s poor form continued into 2015 as he was eliminated in the first round in six successive events: 3–6 to Joe Perry at the Masters; 4–5 to Ryan Day at the German Masters; 1–4 to world number 115 Lee Walker at the Welsh Open; 3–4 to Thepchaiya Un-Nooh at the Indian Open; 1–4 to Ricky Walden at the World Grand Prix; and 1–4 to Joe Perry at the 2015 Players Championship Grand Final. His form improved at the China Open as he defeated Marcus Campbell and Mark Davis—both 5–1—and Mark Williams 5–2 to reach the quarter-finals, where he beat John Higgins 5–4 on the colours. In Ding&#x27;s second ranking-event semi-final of the season, he tied the scores at 5–5 after being 3–5 down to world number 56 Gary Wilson but lost the deciding frame.

In the opening rounds of the World Championship, Ding came back from 0–4 down against Mark Davis to win 10–7 and from 1–5 down against John Higgins to win 13–9.

After losing to Duffy, Ding&#x27;s press conference, during which he swore and criticised the conditions at the event, lasted less than one minute. He also failed to qualify for the German Masters and was knocked out in the first round of the Masters by Stuart Bingham.&lt;ref name=&quot;2015/16&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

He did so by winning three matches, conceding seven frames. He compiled his 400th century break of his career during this run. Ding beat Martin Gould by 10–8 and Judd Trump by 13–10 in the first and second rounds, respectively. He defeated Mark Williams 13–3 in the quarter-finals and Alan McManus 17–11 in the semi-final, during which he set a new record of seven century breaks, the most scored by a single player in a World Championship match at the Crucible Theatre. With this victory, Ding became the first Asian player to reach the final of the World Championship. He made 15 century breaks during the championship, one short of the record of 16 set by Stephen Hendry in the 2002 Championship. Ding lost the final 14–18 to Mark Selby.

He won two frames from 16 to 13 down but missed a blue in the next frame and lost 15–17.

After two very tight sessions, the players were tied at 4–4 and then 8–8 going into the third and final session. O&#x27;Sullivan proved too strong in the third session and Ding eventually lost the match 10–13.

=== Fall from the top 16 and return (2021–present) ===
Ding&#x27;s best performances during the 2020–21 season were reaching the quarter-finals of four ranking tournaments as well as the quarter-finals of the Champion of Champions. His season ended with a 9–10 loss to Stuart Bingham in the first round of the 2021 World Snooker Championship. By late 2021, he had won just one ranking event in the previous four years, had missed many tournaments through choice or circumstance, and had struggled to practice while spending long stretches of time in China during the COVID-19 pandemic. After he lost 3–6 to world number 55 Sam Craigie in the last 64 of the 2021 UK Championship, he fell out of the top 16 in the world rankings, meaning that he did not qualify for the Masters for the first time since he was 18 years old in 2006. Speaking on BBC Two after Ding&#x27;s loss to Craigie, seven-time world champion Stephen Hendry expressed concern about Ding&#x27;s future in the sport: &quot;I don&#x27;t know what has happened to Ding. I don&#x27;t know whether we have seen the best of him. He looks like he doesn&#x27;t really care that much anymore... Any pressure balls he does not look like getting anymore. I don&#x27;t know where Ding goes from here.&quot; After Ding lost 3–4 to world number 65 Zhang Anda in the qualifying round of the Scottish Open, pundit Alan McManus echoed Hendry&#x27;s concerns, stating that Ding had &quot;big problems to fix.&quot; In January 2022, Ding was ranked 30th in the world, was 68th on the one-year ranking list, and had fallen to become China&#x27;s fourth-ranked player, behind Zhao Xintong, Yan Bingtao, and Zhou Yuelong.

Ding beat compatriot Tian Pengfei 6–4 and David Lilley 10–7 in the third and final qualifying rounds of the 2022 World Championship but lost 8–10 to Kyren Wilson in the first round, showing signs of frustration during the match. It was Ding&#x27;s 16th consecutive year at the Crucible.

Before the 2022 UK Championship, Ding had fallen to 38th in the world rankings and had to win two qualifying matches to reach the tournament&#x27;s main stage. However, Ding reached his first ranking final in three years with wins, including a 6–0 whitewash of world number one O&#x27;Sullivan in the quarter-finals. Ding lost 7–10 to Mark Allen in the final, despite having led 6–1. As runner-up, he advanced from 38th to 19th place in the world rankings. A return to form at the 2023 UK Championship saw Ding secure a 6–5 victory over Mark Williams in the quarter-final, which marked his return to the top 16 in the rankings and a spot at the 2024 Masters. Ding reached the final of that UK Championship, where he lost 7–10 to Ronnie O&#x27;Sullivan. One month later he faced O&#x27;Sullivan again in the first round of the Masters. He made a 147 break in the seventh frame of the match, accounting for two of the only four maximum during the 50-year history of the Masters. Ding, however, was ultimately beaten 3–6. Ding&#x27;s 10–7 victory over Chris Wakelin in the final of the 2024 International Championship in China was his first ranking title win since 2019, and his fifteenth overall. At the 2025 Masters, Ding defeated Mark Wlliams 65 in the first round but was then beaten 36 by Judd Trump in the quarter-final.

==Achievements==
Ding won three consecutive ranking tournaments in 2013. In Triple Crown events, he has reached the World Championship finals once, becoming the first Asian player to reach the final of the World Championship in 2016 before losing 14–18 to Mark Selby. He has reached the finals of the UK Championship five times, winning in 2005, 2009, 2019 and losing in 2022 and 2023. He has made two appearances in the Masters&#x27; final, losing in 2007 and winning in 2011.

During his professional playing career, Ding has compiled more than 600 competitive century breaks and seven 147 maximum breaks in professional competition. His first maximum break came at the 2007 Masters at the age of 19 years and seven months, making Ding the youngest player to have made a televised 147. Ding&#x27;s second maximum break came at the 2008 UK Championship. His third came in the first round of the FFB Snooker Open in 2011.

<doc id="457691" wikidata="Q7551767" url="?curid=457691" title="Socialist Studies (1989)">
<text>Socialist Studies is the name of a quarterly socialist periodical and of the group which publishes it. The group was founded in 1991 by sixteen expelled members of the Socialist Party of Great Britain (SPGB) who claim that their expulsions were the result of an anti-socialist conspiracy. Though small, the group has remained an active and vocal critic of the SPGB since its inception.

== The publication ==

&quot;Socialist Studies&quot; was first published in 1989 by the Camden and North West London branches of the Socialist Party of Great Britain (SPGB), though since issue No. 3 (1991) it has been published by an independent organisation. The early issues consisted primarily of material reprinted from the works of Karl Marx and the &quot;Socialist Standard&quot;, though the paper now consists of original material. The format has remained the same for the past fifteen years, namely three to twelve A4 sheets of single-column word-processed text, photocopied and folded to produce an A5 booklet. The publication is text-only, with no graphics or photographs, none of the articles have a byline and until the No. 35 (Spring 2000) none of the issues were dated.

== The group ==

The history of the group now known as Socialist Studies dates to 1991, when the Camden and North West London branches were expelled from the SPGB in a party-wide referendum. Some of these ex members, comprising sixteen individuals, refused to recognise the expulsions and attempted to continue operating as the SPGB, which they claimed to have &quot;reconstituted&quot;. Among them were Edgar Hardcastle and Cyril May, who became their central organiser. As the original SPGB had never been dissolved and indeed continued to operate following the expulsions, it successfully mounted various legal challenges against Socialist Studies&#x27;s use of the SPGB name. Because of this and to differentiate itself from the original SPGB, the group has variously referred to itself in its publicity material as the Reconstituted Socialist Party of Great Britain, the New Socialist Party of Great Britain and Socialist Studies. Third parties refer to them as the Socialist Studies group.

The group&#x27;s activity consists primarily of publishing &quot;Socialist Studies&quot; and various pamphlets and holding occasional propaganda meetings. Socialist Studies was not a registered political party until December 2006, when they registered with the Electoral Commission as Socialist Studies Party (1904). As of 2015, they have never contested a local, national, or European Union election.

=== Differences with the Socialist Party of Great Britain ===
Socialist Studies adopted the object and principles of the SPGB and thus claims to hold that party&#x27;s general ideology and stance on most social, economic and political issues. However, there are several ideological and practical differences between Socialist Studies and the SPGB, most of which arise from the former&#x27;s narrower interpretation of the object and principles and its views on how strictly these interpretations must be adhered to. For the matters discussed in this section, Socialist Studies generally adopts the position that anyone who does not hold their interpretation cannot be regarded as a true socialist. On the other hand, the SPGB holds that at least some of the following issues are ones upon which genuine socialists may disagree with each other; disagreement with the majority position does not automatically disqualify one from being a socialist or from membership in the party. Socialist Studies&#x27;s less accommodating stance has been labelled &quot;doctrinaire&quot;, a characterisation which they categorically reject.

==== Political franchise ====
The principal ideological disagreement Socialist Studies has with the SPGB is its attitude towards attempts by workers living under political dictatorships to establish elementary democratic and trade union rights, especially in Eastern Europe in the 1980s and early 1990s. The stance of the SPGB since 1939 is summarised by the following 1990 party conference resolution:This Conference re-affirms the stand taken in the September [actually October] 1939 &quot;Socialist Standard&quot; and repeated in the September 1989 &quot;Socialist Standard&quot;, that the Socialist Party of Great Britain wholeheartedly supports the efforts of workers everywhere to secure democratic rights against the powers of suppression. Whilst we avoid any association with parties or political groups seeking to administer capitalism, we emphasise that freedom of movement and expression, the freedom to organise in trade unions, to organise politically, and to participate in elections, are of great importance to all workers and are vital to the success of the socialist movement.

On the other hand, Socialist Studies regards the struggle by workers living under a dictatorship to establish some measure of political democracy as a reformist struggle which socialists should oppose. They believe that the difference between democratic capitalist governments and dictatorial capitalist governments is of no significance to workers, that political democracy is not essential for the propagation of socialist ideas and that workers in dictatorships should not directly confront the forces of suppression. Instead, Socialist Studies believes that they must be &quot;hostile to such movements for democracy and to call on workers to form instead a socialist political party based on [their] principles&quot;.

The SPGB does not consider Socialist Studies&#x27;s position to be incompatible with socialism, but rather simply a different (albeit illogical) interpretation of its principles: Indifference to moves by workers to try to establish a minimum of political democracy has, once again, been a minority position within the SPGB though not a matter for expulsion. If [a companion party] were to adopt this position, we could live with it and would not consider it a matter for its exclusion from the World Socialist Movement (though we would reserve the right to criticise it as illogical).

==== Cooperation with capitalist law ====
Despite calling for the establishment of socialist political parties, Socialist Studies believes that such parties should not engage in political action which requires use of or active cooperation with what they call &quot;capitalist law&quot; or &quot;bourgeois legislation&quot;. This arises from their interpretation of Clause 8 of their Declaration of Principles. That clause states that &quot;Socialist Studies [...] enters the field of political action&quot;. The group interprets this as specifically excluding &quot;legal or moral action&quot; and as &quot;overrid[ing] any other consideration&quot;. In light of this, they accuse the SPGB of being capitalist collaborators for having registered with the Electoral Commission, which is a legal requirement to contest elections in the United Kingdom. Nonetheless, members of the group had previously registered as candidates for parliamentary and council elections when they were members of the SPGB and the group itself eventually registered with the Electoral Commission. The group as a whole has also occasionally appealed to the state&#x27;s legal institutions, such as their 1994 lawsuit against the Britannia Building Society. They have also accused others of &quot;criminal libel&quot; and have repeatedly indicated that they are prepared to sue, if necessary.

==== Party name ====
The SPGB had been using the short form of its name, the Socialist Party, for publicity purposes as far back as 1910. In 1988, the party passed a resolution at its annual conference indicating when to use the full-form and short-form names: the full-form name was to be retained as the official name for use on legal documents and publication credits and the short form was to be used for most other purposes, including election ballots and propaganda. This is analogous to how the Conservative and Unionist Party publicises itself as the Conservative Party. The resolution was made partly to codify an existing practice and partly to avoid what some members considered the nationalistic connotation of Great Britain.

Socialist Studies interprets the 1988 resolution as having completely changed the party&#x27;s name and proscribing the use of the full form. They see this resolution as conflicting with the party&#x27;s Declaration of Principles, one clause of which mentions the party&#x27;s full name explicitly. It is largely on this basis that they justified their continued operation as the Socialist Party of Great Britain, claiming that they were expelled from the Socialist Party, not the Socialist Party of Great Britain. They also claim that they are entitled to use the name because the original Socialist Party of Great Britain no longer exists: The Socialist Party of Great Britain of 52 Clapham High Street, London SW4 7UN, is defunct and no longer exists as a political party. It does not produce political literature, hold propaganda meetings or contest elections. It cannot exist merely as a name without a body. [...] We are the only political organisation in this country bearing the title &#x27;The Socialist Party of Great Britain&#x27;.

More recently, the 1988 resolution was reversed at a conference in 2008.

==== Reformism ====

The SPGB has a longstanding position that it is &quot;opposed to a reform programme and to reformist organisations, but not opposed to reforms as such&quot;. Hence, the party does not campaign for reforms itself since its sole object is the establishment of socialism, but it is not opposed to reforms passed by the government when they are clearly in the interests of the working class. The Socialist Studies group disagrees with this position, explicitly stating that socialist Members of Parliament should vote against reform measures even when they are in the interests of the working class.

The SPGB considers Socialist Studies&#x27;s position on how socialist Members of Parliament should vote to be &quot;a legitimate position for a socialist to hold, even though it is not the one that, as a matter of historical fact, has been adopted by the SPGB&quot; and &quot;do[es] not regard it as a matter for serious dispute&quot;.

==== Abolition of the state ====
Socialist Studies accuses the SPGB of coming under the influence of anarchist ideas and not sufficiently emphasising the parliamentary aspect of the socialist revolution. Socialist Studies claims that the SPGB&#x27;s position is that the state would be abolished immediately upon the overthrow of class society whereas Socialist Studies&#x27;s position is that the state would &quot;gradually wither away&quot; instead. Referring to the SPGB&#x27;s 1984 conference resolution (since rescinded) that &quot;Socialism will entail the immediate abolition of and not the gradual decline of the State&quot;, Socialist Studies writes: If you are in favour of the immediate abolition of the State when Socialism is established then you are in favour of its immediate abolition here and now, which is of course the anarchist position. [...] Unless Socialists use the power of the machinery of government to dispossess the capitalist class they will be unable to establish Socialism. We find it inconceivable that intelligent Socialists of a future generation would even consider such an act of monumental stupidity.

=== Relations with the Socialist Party of Great Britain ===
Much of the material published by &quot;Socialist Studies&quot; is highly critical and often outright contemptuous of the SPGB, which it refers to as the &quot;Clapham-based Socialist Party&quot; or the &quot;Socialist Party of Clapham&quot;. The group variously claims that the SPGB is anarchist, reformist, capitalist, fascist, Stalinist, Trotskyist, undemocratic and democracy fetishist. According to Socialist Studies, the SPGB colludes with the Electoral Commission to &quot;prevent Socialists [from] carrying out political propaganda on the web&quot; and does this because its own propaganda is not being read as widely as that of Socialist Studies. Socialist Studies also claims that the SPGB has a secret &quot;de facto&quot; leadership of &quot;godfathers&quot;, who conspire to suppress socialist ideas and to destroy Socialist Studies.

Socialist Studies has repeatedly called on the SPGB to respond to some of these accusations and to engage in debates on their ideological differences. However, as these calls were made at the time Socialist Studies was still claiming to be the Socialist Party of Great Britain, the SPGB refused to recognise their legitimacy. The only official published comment the SPGB has made on the Socialist Studies group has been in an article devoted to the history of breakaway groups in the centenary issue of the &quot;Socialist Standard&quot;, which described them as &quot;a small group of rather disgruntled ex-members&quot;.

<text>Martin Galway (born 3 January 1966, Belfast, Northern Ireland) is one of the best known composers of chiptune video game music for the Commodore 64 and the ZX Spectrum. His works include &quot;Rambo: First Blood Part II&quot;, &quot;Comic Bakery&quot; and &quot;Wizball&quot;″s scores, as well as the music used in the loader for the C64 version of &quot;Arkanoid&quot;.

== Career ==
Galway was the first musician to get published with sampled sounds on the Commodore, with the theme for the &quot;Arkanoid&quot; conversion. When asked about how he did it, he answered:

I figured out how samples were played by hacking into someone else&#x27;s code... OK, I admit it... It was a drum synthesizer package called Digidrums, actually, so you could still say I was the first to include samples in a piece of music. ... Never would I claim to have invented that technique, I just got it published first. In fact, I couldn&#x27;t really figure out where they got the sample data, just that they were wiggling the volume register, so I tried to make up my own drum sample sounds in realtime – which is the flatulence stuff that shipped in &quot;Arkanoid&quot;. ... After the project was in the shops I gained access to some real drum samples, and I slid those into my own custom version of the tune. The one that&#x27;s in the shops is kind of a collage of farts &amp; burps, don&#x27;t you think?... Later I was able to acquire some proper drum samples and by &quot;Game Over&quot; it got quite sophisticated.

Galway was appointed as Audio Director at Origin Systems in 1990. He worked at Digital Anvil from 1996.

Galway&#x27;s most recent post was working as Audio Director for Cloud Imperium Games on their upcoming PC game &quot;Star Citizen&quot;, created by Chris Roberts of &quot;Wing Commander&quot;. &quot;Star Citizen&quot; was expected to release Q1 2015. Galway has since left this post.

<doc id="457704" wikidata="Q924957" url="?curid=457704" title="Threadfin">
<text>Threadfins are silvery grey perciform fish of the family Polynemidae. Found in tropical to subtropical waters throughout the world, the threadfin family contains eight genera and about 40 species. An unrelated species sometimes known by the name threadfin, &quot;Alectis indicus&quot;, is properly the Indian threadfish (family Carangidae).

Ranging in length from in the dwarf threadfin (&quot;Parapolynemus verekeri&quot;) to in fourfinger threadfin (&quot;Eleutheronema tetradactylum&quot;) and giant African threadfin (&quot;Polydactylus quadrifilis&quot;), threadfins are both important to commercial fisheries as a food fish, and popular among anglers. Their habit of forming large schools makes the threadfins a reliable and economic catch.

==Description==
Their bodies are elongated and fusiform, with spinous and soft dorsal fins widely separated. Their tail fins are large and deeply forked, indicating speed and agility. The mouth is large and inferior; a blunt snout projects far ahead. The jaws and palate possess bands of villiform (fibrous) teeth. Their most distinguishing feature is their pectoral fins: they are composed of two distinct sections, the lower of which consists of three to seven long, thread-like independent rays. &quot;Polynemus&quot; species may have up to 15 of these modified rays.

In some species, such as the royal threadfin (&quot;Pentanemus quinquarius&quot;), the thread-like rays may extend well past the tail fin. This feature explains both the common name threadfin and the family name Polynemidae, from the Greek &quot;poly&quot; meaning &quot;many&quot; and &quot;nema&quot; meaning &quot;filament.&quot; Similar species, such as the mullets (family Mugilidae) and milkfish (family Chanidae), can be easily distinguished from threadfins by their lack of filamentous pectoral rays.

==Distribution and habitat==
Threadfins frequent open, shallow water in areas with muddy, sandy, or silty bottoms; they are rarely seen at reefs. Their pectoral rays are thought to serve as tactile structures, helping to find prey within the sediments. Noted for being euryhaline, threadfins can tolerate a wide range of salinity levels. This attribute allows threadfins to enter estuaries and even rivers. They feed primarily on crustaceans and smaller fish.

==Reproduction==
Presumed to be pelagic spawners, threadfins probably release many tiny, buoyant eggs into the water column, which then become part of the plankton. The eggs float freely with the currents until hatching.

==Cuisine==

Threadfin has been used to create crab stick.

==Mariculture==
In Hawaii, sixfinger threadfins are the subject of commercial open-ocean cage mariculture.

==Genera and species==

<text>John Stanley Body (7 October 1944 – 10 May 2015) was a New Zealand composer, ethnomusicologist, photographer, teacher, and arts producer. As a composer, his work comprised concert music, music theatre, electronic music, music for film and dance, and audio-visual gallery installations. A deep and long-standing interest in the music of non-Western cultures – particularly South-East Asian – influenced much of his composing work, particularly his technique of transcribing field recordings. As an organiser of musical events and projects, Body had a significant impact on the promotion of Asian music in New Zealand, as well as the promotion of New Zealand music within the country and abroad.

In 2015 he was named a New Zealand Arts Icon, the highest award given by the New Zealand Arts Foundation and the first composer to be so honoured. In November 2020, Body&#x27;s status as an Arts Icon was suspended by the Arts Foundation following allegations that Body had sexually abused male students at Victoria University. In January 2022, following a formal apology by the university to these students, the Arts Foundation confirmed that his award was no longer recognised by the organisation.

==Biography==
Jack Body was born 7 October 1944 in Te Aroha, a town in the North Island farming district of the Waikato. Both parents came from farming families; his father, Stan, was an earthmoving contractor. Seeing his older sisters take piano lessons, Body convinced his parents to let him follow suit, and began piano lessons from William Cranna, a graduate of the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and employee of the local power board. Body&#x27;s first composing efforts as a child were re-composing his prescribed Royal Schools exercises and performing them at end-of-year piano recitals in the local church hall.

Body attended secondary school as a boarder at King&#x27;s College, Auckland. There, his interest in both music and painting was kindled amidst the school&#x27;s dynamic musical life under the leadership of music teacher L C M Saunders, with whom Body took piano and organ lessons. On completing secondary school, he applied for the Elam School of Fine Arts but instead chose to study music at the University of Auckland, beginning a Bachelor of Music in 1963. At that time composition was not offered as a course of study at an undergraduate level; nevertheless, Body composed prolifically during his undergraduate years. While studying at the University of Auckland, Body also took organ lessons with Peter Godfrey and sang in the choir of St. Mary&#x27;s Anglican Cathedral, Parnell. In 1965 he was appointed organist and choirmaster of St. Aidan&#x27;s Anglican Church in Remuera.

After graduating his BMus with first class Honours, Body began his Masters of Music in 1966, studying composition with Ron Tremain in his first year and Robin Maconie in his second. He completed his MMus, along with an additional teaching degree, in 1967. As a postgraduate student, Body began corralling artists and musicians for events and projects. A considerable crowd of avant-garde Auckland artists gravitated around his Birdwood Crescent flat in Parnell. In 1967, while president of the New Zealand Chapter of ISCM (International Society for Contemporary Music), Body organised a festival called Aucklanders and the Arts in the University of Auckland Student Union Building.

An Arts Council Grant in 1969 enabled Body to travel to Cologne to study at Mauricio Kagel&#x27;s Ferienkurse für Neue Musik. With an extension of the Arts Council Grant, Body was able to study at the Institute of Sonology in Utrecht, the Netherlands, from 1969 to 1970. Returning home in 1970 via travels through Greece, North India, and Jakarta sparked Body&#x27;s lifelong fascination with non-Western musical traditions.

On his return to New Zealand, Body took up a teaching position at Tawa College in Wellington, but resigned after one year to focus on freelance composition projects. Body travelled to Bali and Java for four months in 1974, after which the Akademi Musik Indonesia in Yogyakarta (now in the Indonesian Arts Institute), invited him to return in 1976 as a guest lecturer. Body&#x27;s return trip to Yogyakarta was supported by the New Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Although Body was teaching Western music practice at the Akademi, his experience living in Yogyakarta enabled him to learn about the region&#x27;s traditional music, as well as make numerous field recordings of local music and environmental sounds.

After a year in Yogyakarta, Body met linguist Yono Soekarno (or Sukarno) in an Indonesian post office and who was to be his partner for his remaining 40 years. Body was gay; fellow composer Ross Harris said that Body &quot;was a gay artist... that was a basic position from which he did his work&quot;.

At the end of 1977, Body and Soekarno returned to Wellington, where Body worked as a freelance composer while tutoring at Victoria University and running workshops in secondary schools. 1980 saw the retirement of Douglas Lilburn as composition professor at Victoria University (now the New Zealand School of Music); Body applied for and was offered the position. Body remained on the composition faculty of Victoria University until his retirement in 2009.

Body lived out the rest of his life in Wellington, amidst countless travels overseas. His first trip to China was in 1985, whereupon he began formulating ideas for what would become his opera Alley, based on the life of Rewi Alley, a New Zealand political activist in China.

Celebratory concerts in honour of Body&#x27;s 70th birthday were held at both the University of Auckland and Victoria University Wellington in April 2014. After a long battle with cancer, Body died 10 May 2015 in Mary Potter Hospice, Wellington, the day after his meditation on mortality &quot;Cries: A Border Town&quot; (originally entitled &quot;Cries from the Border&quot;) received its Australian premiere at the 2015 Canberra International Music Festival. A memorial concert honouring his life was held at St. Andrews-on-the-Terrace, Wellington, on 24 May 2015.

==Music and work==
Body&#x27;s earliest works, such as choral pieces &quot;Ave Maria Gratia Plena&quot; (1965), &quot;People Look East&quot; (1965), and &quot;Carol to St. Stephen&quot; (1975) reflect Body&#x27;s early training as a church musician. His travel to South-East Asia in the early 1970s, where he encountered local musical traditions, significantly re-formed his compositional language. Many of Body&#x27;s works are scored for both Western and non-Western instruments such as gamelan, sheng, and gangsa. &quot;Resonance Music&quot; (1974), for electric guitar and 6 percussionists, features gamelan; its premiere by the New Zealand Broadcasting Corporation Symphony Orchestra made first use of the set of gamelan gifted to the orchestra in May 1974 by the Indonesian ambassador to New Zealand.

Field recordings made by Body in South-East Asia formed the source material for many of his electronic and electro-acoustic pieces, such as &quot;Musik Dari Jalan&quot; (1975), &quot;Musik Anak-Anak&quot; (1978), &quot;Fanfares&quot; (1981), and &quot;Interior&quot; (1987). &quot;Intimate Histories no. 1&quot; (2005) features a personal oral history of Yono Soekarno, Jack&#x27;s partner, coloured by field recordings which Body made in Soekarno&#x27;s Indonesian hometown in 1977 and 1988.

As well as creating tape pieces from these field recordings, Body also developed a process of &#x27;double-transcription&#x27;, which he described as transcribing the essence of the musical source in the recording in such a way that would be playable by Western musicians. Whenever possible, Body used field recordings he himself had made, and used the original music in its entirety. Works employing these transcription techniques include &quot;Melodies for Orchestra&quot; (1983), commissioned by the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra to mark the 100th anniversary of the University of Auckland, &quot;Three Transcriptions&quot; (1988), commissioned by the Kronos Quartet, and the orchestral work &quot;Pulse&quot; (1995), which combines transcribed material from the Baining people of East New Britain, Papua New Guinea, with fragments from symphonic works by Beethoven, Berlioz, and Stravinsky.

Several of Body&#x27;s works stake out a decidedly political stance. &quot;Little Elegies&quot; (1985) was commissioned by the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra to celebrate the 25th anniversary of television broadcasting in New Zealand. Rather than marking the occasion with a celebration of televised communication, Body intended for the work, which featured a video reel, to critique television&#x27;s sanitization of global events, trauma, and suffering.

A major work in Body&#x27;s career is his opera &quot;Alley&quot;, premiered at the 1998 New Zealand International Festival of the Arts. &quot;Alley&quot; is based on the life of Rewi Alley, a New Zealand-born writer, political activist, and member of the Chinese Communist Party who lived and taught in China from the late 1920s until his death in 1987. With a libretto co-written with Geoff Chapple, Alley&#x27;s biographer, the opera featured Gansu folk singers Ji Zheng-Zhu and Li Gui-Zhou, Beijing&#x27;s Huaxia Chamber Ensemble, and a small orchestra of New Zealand musicians. A last-minute funding cut left the opera in perilous straits, but an eleventh-hour fundraising effort by Body and Chapple secured its performance.

One recurring theme in Body&#x27;s work is the music of non-Western cultures; another is non-normative sexual identity. Body&#x27;s music-theatre piece Songs &amp; Dances of Desire (2013), written while Auckland Philharmonia Composer-in-Residence, is based on the life of Carmen Rupe, an anti-discrimination and AIDS activist as well as the first Māori drag performer. The work features three vocalists: a counter-tenor performing Carmen&#x27;s arias from Bizet&#x27;s eponymous opera, a female vocalist singing in Māori, and an operatic mezzo-soprano singing in Spanish. The poems sung by the two female vocalists are by female poets from around the world which have been translated from their original language into English, and then re-translated into either Māori or Spanish.

In addition to concert music, Body composed prolifically for screen. He wrote the theme music for television drama &quot;The Longest Winter&quot; (1974), New Zealand&#x27;s first Māori language TV drama &quot;Uenuku&quot; (1974), and New Zealand&#x27;s first soap opera, &quot;Close to Home&quot; (1975). Body&#x27;s first feature film soundtrack was for Vincent Ward&#x27;s &quot; Vigil&quot; (1984). Body co-wrote with John Gibson the soundtrack to another Ward film, &quot;Rain of the Children&quot; (2008).

Body was also an active art photographer, though untrained, whose unconventional work was shown in several New Zealand galleries. The &quot;Male Nude Series&quot; (1983) featured male nudes in vibrant colours, created through manipulations of the film negatives. Using a scalpel, nail-file, felt-tip pen and even ball-point pen, Body worked the images by scratching and re-colouring to evoke a painterly quality. The audio-visual installation &quot;Runes&quot; (1984), commissioned by the Wellington Art Gallery, juxtaposed re-coloured photographs of graffiti in public toilets with recordings made in toilets of running water.

==Legacy==
Besides his work as a composer, Body&#x27;s activities as an ambitious organiser and curator of musical events made an enormous mark both on New Zealand&#x27;s composing community as well as on the cultural life of the country. Some of Body&#x27;s earlier projects were the Sonic Circuses, the first of which took place in Wellington in March 1974, commissioned by the New Zealand Broadcasting Corporation and the New Zealand Students&#x27; Arts Council. Loosely inspired by John Cage&#x27;s Musicircus, the 6-hour-plus event featured New Zealand music performed across eight different venues within the Victoria University Student Union building. A second Sonic Circus followed in 1975.

As an ethnomusicologist, Body published a number of CDs of traditional Asian music. Indonesian music is documented in &quot;Music for Sale: Street Musicians of Yogyakarta&quot; (OMCD 006, and TC HLS-91), &quot;Music of Madura&quot; (CD ODE 1381) and &quot;Jemblung: Sung Narrative Traditions&quot; (PAN 2048CD). &quot;South of the Clouds&quot;, a 4-CD set released on Ode Records, documented rare field recordings of Chinese ethnomusicologist Zhang Xingrong.

Body&#x27;s facilitation of international exchanges played a significant role in promoting Asian music and musicians in New Zealand. In late 1974 Body assisted ethnomusicologist Allan Thomas in bringing from Cirebon, West Java to New Zealand the country&#x27;s first set of gamelan. Body later managed the Victoria University Gamelan Padhang Moncar (gamelan orchestra) for many years, during which time he commissioned several new works for the gamelan orchestra. Also while on the composition faculty at Victoria University, Body established a residency inviting musicians from regions in South-East Asia (among others, West Java, Bali, Kalinga, and Minangkabau) to work closely with the university&#x27;s performers and composers. The year 2000 saw the 25th anniversary of Gamelan in New Zealand; to mark the occasion, Body co-organised BEAT, an international gamelan festival with over 100 international participants.

Body was an advocate for New Zealand music and composers. In 1975, Body released a three-LP set of New Zealand electroacoustic music, &quot;New Zealand Electronic Music&quot; (Kiwi-Pacific LP, SLD 44–46), realised in the electronic music studios of Victoria University. In subsequent years he would edit over twenty CDs of New Zealand music. In 1981, at Douglas Lilburn&#x27;s behest, Body re-activated the then-dormant Wai-te-ata Music Press, a publisher of New Zealand musical scores which Lilburn had founded. Body was editor of Wai-te-ata Music Press from 1981 to 2013, during which time the press became the largest publisher of New Zealand music. Body founded the Nelson Composers&#x27; Workshop in 1982, an ongoing annual gathering of young, emerging and established New Zealand composers where new works are performed and critiqued. He promoted New Zealand music in the international sphere, serving for many years on the executive committee of the Asian Composers&#x27; League (ACL). He was artistic director of Asia-Pacific Festivals &amp; Conferences in 1984, 1992, and 2007: ten-day events juxtaposing traditional and contemporary music of New Zealand and the Asia-Pacific region. In 2002 he curated a series of five concerts of New Zealand music at the Ijsbreker in Amsterdam.

In 2011, Body embarked on a project to commission new works from New Zealand and Chinese composers for the traditional Chinese instruments of the Forbidden City Orchestra, working jointly with the New Zealand String Quartet. These works were premiered in Beijing in December 2013 with subsequent performances in Auckland and Wellington in March 2014.

==Allegations of sexual assault==
In October 2020, a number of former students at the New Zealand School of Music reported being sexually assaulted by Body, after being asked by Victoria University to consider donating to a memorial fund in his name. Victoria University said in response that, although no direct allegations had been made to the university, it would temporarily remove mentions of the memorial fund from its website &quot;in recognition of the serious nature of these allegations&quot; and investigate further.

In November 2020, the university said that it had been approached by former students who had given &quot;very credible accounts&quot; of abuse. The university said that it planned to work with survivors to design a restorative justice process, which could involve formal apologies, compensation and policy changes. The Arts Foundation&#x27;s chairperson Garth Gallaway also advised that it had suspended its endorsement of Body as an Arts Icon while it &quot;awaited further information&quot;.

In January 2022, the university issued a formal apology to Body&#x27;s former students, stating:

At the same time, Gallaway confirmed that Body had been removed from the list of Arts Icons and that his award was no longer recognised by the Arts Foundation.

<doc id="457742" wikidata="Q369400" url="?curid=457742" title="Coat of arms of Bermuda">
<text>The coat of arms of [[Bermuda]] depicts a red lion with a shield that has a depiction of a wrecked ship upon it. The red lion is a symbol of Great Britain and alludes to Bermuda&#x27;s relationship with that country. The Latin motto under the coat of arms, &quot;Quo Fata Ferunt&quot;, means &quot;Whither the Fates Carry [Us]&quot;. The wrecked ship is the &quot;Sea Venture&quot;. The arms were formally granted by Royal Warrant on 4 October 1910, but had been in use since at least 1624. The coat of arms first appears on the cover of the 1624 edition of &quot;The Generall Historie of Virginia, New-England, and the Summer Isles&quot;. The &quot;Somers Isles&quot; is another name for Bermuda, named after Sir George Somers, the colony&#x27;s founder. 

== Blazon ==
The heraldic blazon is: &quot;Argent, on a mount vert a lion sejant affronté gules supporting between the fore-paws an antique shield azure thereon a representation of the wreck of the ship&quot; Sea Venture &quot;proper.&quot;

==&quot;Sea Venture&quot; shipwreck==
On 2 June 1609, &quot;Sea Venture&quot; set sail from Plymouth, England as the flagship of a seven-ship fleet (towing two additional pinnaces) destined for Jamestown, Virginia. On 24 July, the fleet ran into a tropical storm, likely a hurricane, and the ships were separated. &quot;Sea Venture&quot; fought the storm for three days. Admiral Sir George Somers, piloting the leaking ship, wedged the &quot;Sea Venture&quot; onto the reefs of eastern Bermuda. This allowed 150 people, and one dog, to be landed safely ashore. 

The survivors, including several company officials (Lieutenant-General Sir Thomas Gates, Captain Christopher Newport, George Yeardley, Silvester Jourdain, Stephen Hopkins, and William Strachey, among others), were stranded on Bermuda for approximately nine months. The castaways would build two ships and arrive in Jamestown, Virginia, in May, 1610. Newport and Gates sailed back to England, and arrived in September to report the events to the Virginia Company of London and the public.

;Previous shipwreck design

In 2009, a paper and documentary were published with evidence that the shipwreck on the original crest (as seen on the 1622 Richard Norwood map) was actually a Dutch vessel. In 1593, an unnamed Dutch ship, with a French crew, wrecked on North Rock, miles north of the main archipelago. That shipwreck marooned the first Englishman on Bermuda--Henry May. This would help explain the &quot;cliffs&quot; visible on the crest, as the sea level was much lower in the 1500s. Henry May and the survivors would leave Bermuda in May, 1594, making the archipelago infamous to English culture, more than 15 years before the tale of the &quot;Sea Venture&quot; was known in Europe.


== Flag of Bermuda ==
On 4 October 1910, the coat of arms (without the banner holding the motto) was added to the Red ensign to create the current Flag of Bermuda. The coat of arms replaced a badge which had been in use on the Bermuda red ensign before October 1910. The badge was based on a sketch, made in 1869, of the 1817 seal, which depicted a wet dock of the time showing with some boats in the background. It is assumed that the scene alludes to the fact that the islands were a stopover base for the sailing ships when the badge was approved by the Admiralty.

<text>The Emblem of Bhutan (རྒྱལ་ཡོངས་ལས་རྟགས་) maintains several elements of the flag of Bhutan, with slightly different artistry, and contains Buddhist symbolism.

The emblem was designed by a Mongolian artist and it was commissioned by Ashi Tashi Dorji, the sister of the Queen Grandmother. The &quot;dorji&quot; was a weapon used by Guru Rinpoche (Padmasambhāva) to quell evil spirits.

The official description of the emblem is as follows:

<doc id="457748" wikidata="Q4646099" url="?curid=457748" title="96 Tears">
<text>&quot;96 Tears&quot; is a song recorded by the American garage rock band ? and the Mysterians in 1966 (&quot;see&quot; 1966 in music). In October of that year, it was #1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in the U.S. and on the &quot;RPM&quot; 100 in Canada. &quot;Billboard&quot; ranked the record as the #5 song for 1966. It was ranked #213 on the &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time in 2010. On November 11, 1966, the single was certified as gold by the RIAA.

==Background==
The song was written by Question Mark (Rudy Martinez) in 1962 in his manager&#x27;s living room, and was recorded in Bay City, Michigan. Initially, Question Mark had to insist that &quot;96 Tears&quot; be the A-side over &quot;Midnight Hour&quot;. Once the issue was settled, the band recorded the single for the small Pa-Go-Go label, owned by Lilly Gonzalez. She backed the band financially, and allowed access to her personal studio in her basement. When it began doing well locally, the band took a recording to Bob Dell, the radio director in Flint, Michigan. The song became the most requested, and wider radio play spread into Canada, where it was picked up by Cameo Records for national distribution.

Various reports have suggested that Question Mark first wrote the song under the title &quot;Too Many Teardrops&quot; and then &quot;69 Tears&quot;, but then changed the title, fearing that radio stations would not play the song. However, Question Mark denied this in an interview, stating that the number 96 has a deep philosophical meaning for him.

Known for its signature organ riffs and bare-bones lyrics, &quot;96 Tears&quot; is recognized as one of the first garage band hits, and has even been given credit for starting the punk rock movement. In Vice Media, Legs McNeil said &quot;96 Tears&quot; is &quot;a safe candidate for first punk rock song ever.&quot;

The song appeared on the band&#x27;s album &quot;96 Tears&quot;. The follow-up song, &quot;I Need Somebody&quot;, peaked at #22 later that year, but no other U.S. Top 40 singles followed.
