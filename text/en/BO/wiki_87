<text>Lookout Records (stylized as Lookout! Records) was an independent record label, initially based in Laytonville, California, and later in Berkeley, focusing on punk rock. Established in 1987, the label is best known for having released Operation Ivy’s only album, &quot;Energy&quot;, and Green Day&#x27;s first two albums, &quot;39/Smooth&quot; and &quot;Kerplunk&quot;.

Following the departure of co-founder Larry Livermore in 1997, the label departed from its &quot;East Bay sound&quot; and proved unable to match early success. In 2005 the label ran into financial difficulties after several high-profile artists rescinded the rights to their Lookout Records material. After a period of rapid contraction the label slowly expired, terminating operations and removing its music from online distribution channels early in 2012.

==History==
===Background===
During the fall of 1984 Larry Livermore (née Larry Hayes), a resident of the small town of Laytonville, California, of countercultural proclivities, felt the urge to opine about the problems of his community and the world in a small-circulation periodical. Thus in October of that year was launched a circulation magazine called &quot;Lookout,&quot; the first issue of which was typed and photocopied with a &quot;press run&quot; of just 50 copies. Opposition emerged to the controversial local topics upon which Livermore opined and so he turned to the theme punk rock, a form of music he had followed in the late 1970s.

Livermore began to reacquaint himself with the ongoing punk music scene by listening to the Maximum Rocknroll (MRR) radio show, broadcast weekly from Berkeley and featuring prominent scenester and future fanzine publisher Tim Yohannan and his cohorts. Livermore also decided to start a band, drafting a 12-year-old neighbor to play drums — given the punk rock name &quot;Tré Cool&quot; by Livermore. Cool would later gain fame as the drummer of Green Day.

After a few ill-attended shows in 1985 Livermore took his band, The Lookouts, into a local recording studio to record their songs, with a 26-song demo tape resulting. He also began living part-time in the San Francisco Bay Area, splitting his time between the city and his home in the mountains of Mendocino County.

The Lookouts began playing out more in San Francisco and Berkeley and began to develop a fan following and to make the acquaintance of other local bands, including a melodically friendly group called The Mr. T Experience. A vibrant local scene began to congeal, based around the Gilman Street Project, an all-ages venue inspired, bankrolled, and coordinated by the popular &quot;Maximum Rocknroll,&quot; launched the night of December 31, 1986.

Early in 1987 Livermore decided that it was time for The Lookouts to release a record. Livermore chose to take the Do It Yourself route to create such an album, self-releasing the one-off LP under &quot;Lookout Records.&quot; At the same time, the new bands emerging around the vibrant 924 Gilman Street venue, including Operation Ivy, Crimpshrine, Sewer Trout, Isocracy, and others were documented for the first time by local scenester David Hayes on a 17-song double 7-inch compilation entitled &quot;Turn It Around,&quot; released through Mordam Distribution on the Maximum Rocknroll Records label. The duo would soon join forces as co-founders of a permanent label.

===Establishment===
Both Lawrence Livermore (née Larry Hayes) and David Hayes (not related) were deeply inspired by the energetic East Bay punk rock scene and sought to further document its leading bands. David Hayes initially wanted to start a new label of his own for the purpose, to be known as Sprocket Records, with a view to a first release for the band Corrupted Morals. Livermore, a columnist for &quot;Maximum Rocknroll&quot; &quot;(MRR)&quot; who knew Hayes as a so-called &quot;shitworker&quot; for the publication, convinced the latter that a partnership was in order to advance their common goal. As Livermore&#x27;s release had an independently controlled label name, Lookout Records, while Hayes&#x27;s debut release borrowed the well-known &quot;MRR&quot; moniker, the former name was decided upon as the label name for the releases of the duo moving forward.

According to Livermore, the name &quot;Lookout&quot; was chosen for his magazine and band and thus the label from whence it sprung was selected in reference to the United States Forest Service fire watch tower on Iron Peak, the highest point in Livermore&#x27;s rural Mendocino County neighborhood. The company&#x27;s iconic &quot;beady eyes&quot; logo was the early creation of David Hayes, who also handled much of the artwork for the label&#x27;s early sleeves and LP jackets.

With Hayes&#x27;s Corrupted Morals project moving forward as LK-02, a 7-inch EP entitled &quot;Chet,&quot; Livermore and Hayes jointly worked to bring about a third release later in 1987. This would be yet another 7-inch EP, a record by raw-edged ska-punkers Operation Ivy called &quot;Hectic.&quot; This third release proved to be an aural document of the right band at the right moment, with the release by the high energy local favorites selling through its first pressing of 1,000 copies within a month.

In an effort to make a splash, four 7-inch vinyl records were released simultaneously, including also releases by popular 924 Gilman bands Crimpshrine (LK-04) and Isocracy (LK-05). This initial barrage of new releases went far in cementing Lookout&#x27;s place as a cutting edge local label for the Berkeley punk scene.

The &quot;Gilman bands&quot; began to form friendships amongst themselves and to play out together at other venues on the road. One important contact was made in the person of 14-year-old Christopher &quot;Chris&quot; Appelgren, a resident of the small town of Garberville, California who worked as a volunteer at community radio station KMUD and who had learned of The Lookouts and the burgeoning East Bay punk rock scene through the pages of &quot;Lookout&quot; magazine, which was distributed in the area. Appelgren attended a show held at Humboldt State University in Arcata, California played by Lookout Records bands Operation Ivy, Crimpshrine, Isocracy, and The Lookouts and was wowed by what he saw, meeting Livermore for the first time and making the acquaintance of Tim &quot;Lint&quot; Armstrong of Op Ivy — later a leading member of Rancid. Before long Appelgren would be traveling to Livermore&#x27;s Laytonville home to help with the stuffing of 7-inch vinyl into sleeves and packaging records for mailorder, becoming the label&#x27;s first paid employee.

===Departure of David Hayes===
Livermore and Hayes began to become estranged from one another, and the label&#x27;s projects began to be bifurcated between the two principals — &quot;Larry&#x27;s bands&quot; and &quot;David&#x27;s bands,&quot; with the eclectic Hayes next turning to releases by post punk band Plaid Retina and country punks Sewer Trout. In addition to differences in musical taste which became more apparent over time, the pair were temperamentally ill-suited, with Hayes understated and reserved and Livermore boisterous and gregarious.

In addition, Hayes and Livermore differed greatly with respect to commercial motivation. In a 2015 memoir, Livermore recalled that

Although the winds of change had begun to blow even in 1988, David Hayes would remain very active with Lookout through the summer of 1989, albeit with dissatisfaction regarding the label&#x27;s direction growing, and his expressed desires of departure becoming more frequent. Hayes had gradually come to find working with Livermore to be insufferable and sought peace and artistic freedom through formation of his own record label.

Believing that Hayes&#x27;s participation in the Lookout project as bookkeeper and skilled mitigator of the demands of demanding bands was essential, the 16-year old Appelgren clearly not being ready for the role, Livermore tried a last-ditch effort to retain Hayes with the label, offering to take over all mundane operational tasks while leaving Hayes with &quot;half the profits&quot; as financial coordinator and public face of the organization. The anti-commercial Hayes flatly rejected this proposal with the declaration that &quot;there&#x27;s too much golden light around Lookout right now,&quot; adding that work on his label of love had come to feel &quot;too much like a job.&quot;

With a quiet determination, Hayes declared that his departure would take effect on January 1, 1990, adding &quot;I don&#x27;t want anything more to do with Lookout, and I don&#x27;t want anything more from Lookout.&quot; The speechless Livermore was left with full ownership and control of the label on the very eve of its commercial success. David Hayes would go on to start his own label, Very Small Records, releasing dozens of records over the coming decade that ran the gamut of punk styles, maintaining fidelity to his artistic and ethical vision — while the label that he exited would go on to become a multimillion-dollar commercial enterprise.

===Punk rock rising (1989-1993)===
Many different punk rock bands, such as Green Day, were signed to Lookout in this time. Green Day released their debut EP, &quot;1,000 Hours&quot;, in 1989. Green Day also released &quot;39/Smooth&quot; (1990), &quot;Slappy&quot; (1990), &quot;Sweet Children&quot; (1990), and, with their new drummer, &quot;Kerplunk!&quot; (1992). After the breakup of Operation Ivy, some of the members formed Rancid. They released their debut EP, &quot;Rancid&quot;, in 1992 with Lookout Records. Screeching Weasel released their third and fifth to seventh albums, &quot;My Brain Hurts&quot; (1991), &quot;Wiggle&quot; (1993), &quot;Anthem for a New Tomorrow&quot; (1993), and &quot;How to Make Enemies and Irritate People&quot; (1994). Many other Bay area punk bands were getting signed by Lookout Records, giving them a start to a career.

===&quot;Golden years&quot; (1993–1997)===
Lookout became famous for releasing albums that featured a very distinctive &quot;Ramonescore&quot; pop punk sound including bands such as Screeching Weasel, The Mr T Experience, The Queers, Crimpshrine, Green Day, Sweet Baby, Squirtgun, The Wanna-Bes and others.

In the spring of 1994 Lookout principal Larry Livermore made a very public break with Tim Yohannan and his &quot;Maximum Rocknroll,&quot; for which Livermore had written since 1987. With punk exploding in popularity and various tangential musical forms attaching themselves to the movement and swamping &quot;MRR&quot; with promotional material, a tightening of musical focus was demanded by Yohannan — a move which led to the launch of the more eclectic rival publication &quot;Punk Planet.&quot; Livermore rebelled at the new line, charging that &quot;MRR&quot; had increasingly become &quot;a lifestyle journal for retro-punks&quot; who &quot;think if they dress up in the same clothes they wore 15 years ago, if they drink the same beer and play the same guitar riffs, that somehow it&#x27;ll be the glory days of punk all over again.&quot; Despite Yohannan&#x27;s radical politics, &quot;Maximum&quot; had been revealed to be &quot;simply another business,&quot; Livermore provocatively declared.

In 1995, with the help of Green Day&#x27;s &quot;1,039/Smoothed Out Slappy Hours&quot; and &quot;Kerplunk&quot;, Lookout Records made $10 million in sales.

Co-founder Larry Livermore left the label in 1997.

===Under new management (1998–2004)===
After Livermore&#x27;s departure, Chris Appelgren took over as the label&#x27;s president while his wife Molly Neuman became vice president and label employee Cathy Bauer took over as general manager. Screeching Weasel resigned with the label in 1998 for their album Emo. As part of an agreement, Lookout also purchased Ben Weasel&#x27;s label Panic Button Records and would release albums from Panic Button acts including The Eyeliners, Enemy You and The Lillingtons. The move would be a major financial loss that would effect the label&#x27;s royalty payouts in the following years. The label also switched its long time distribution affiliation with Mordam to RED Distribution.

In 1998, the label signed Palo Alto-based band The Donnas and would release 3 albums from the band between 1998 and 2001 as well as reissue their debut album. With decent sales and heavy coverage of the band from mainstream media outlets, The Donnas would depart for Atlantic Records in 2002. Other veteran acts such as The Queers, Pansy Division and Avail would depart in the early 2000s citing poor promotion and the label&#x27;s increasing attention and spending on new acts.

By 2002, Lookout began to shift focus from its East Bay pop punk roots to a more diverse sound by releasing albums from bands such as Pretty Girls Make Graves, Ted Leo And The Pharmacists, The Oranges Band and Neuman&#x27;s own band Bratmobile. The shift in direction and new releases from veteran acts like The Smugglers and The Mr. T Experience could not offset declining album sales and financial mismanagement including unprofitable showcases at the Warped Tour and CMJ. By 2004, the label had closed its retail store on University Avenue in Berkeley.

===Demise (2005–2012)===
On August 1, 2005, Green Day followed Avail, Blatz, Filth, Operation Ivy, Screeching Weasel, Riverdales, Lillingtons and Enemy You in announcing they had rescinded the master rights for their Lookout Records material. They cited continuing breach of contract regarding unpaid royalties. This led to the label laying off six of nine staff members. Appelgren told Punknews.org that the label would carry on in a scaled back form. Lookout Records turned 20 years old in 2008.

In December 2009, the company entered a major financial reconstruction period.

The label officially closed in January 2012. The label returned any remaining inventory, masters and artwork to the bands. Appelgren said he hoped bands would &quot;... revisit their Lookout releases, with interesting and cool results.&quot;

<text>Ca&#x27; Foscari University of Venice (), or simply Ca&#x27; Foscari, is a public research university and business school in Venice, Italy. Since its foundation in 1868, it has been housed in the Venetian Gothic palace of Ca&#x27; Foscari, from which it takes its name. The palace stands on the Grand Canal, between the Rialto and San Marco, in the sestiere of Dorsoduro, while the rest of the University is scattered around the historical centre. In addition to the historical centre of Venice, Ca&#x27; Foscari also has campuses in Mestre and Treviso. 

Ca&#x27; Foscari was founded in 1868 after the annexation of the Veneto region in the Kingdom of Italy as the &quot;Regia Scuola Superiore di Commercio&quot; (Royal College of Commerce)&quot;.&quot; As such, it is the second oldest business school in the world, after the Institut Supérieur de Commerce d&#x27;Anvers, founded in 1853. Ca&#x27; Foscari expanded throughout the 1900s and became a full-fledged university in 1968. It currently has eight departments and almost 21,000 students, and is Venice&#x27;s biggest university. 

Its teaching and research is centred around economics &amp; business, humanities, and modern languages. 

==History==

Ca&#x27; Foscari was founded as the &quot;Regia Scuola Superiore di Commercio&quot; (Royal College of Commerce) by a Royal Decree dated 6 August 1868, and teaching commenced in December of the same year. The idea of establishing such a school had arisen after the annexation of the Veneto to the new Kingdom of Italy in 1866, and was promoted by three people in particular: the political economist Luigi Luzzatti, later Prime Minister of Italy; Edoardo Deodati, senator of the Kingdom of Italy and vice-president of the province of Venice; and the Sicilian political economist Francesco Ferrara, director of the school for its first thirty years.

The school was the first institute of higher education in commerce in Italy. It also had a diplomatic section to train and educate Diplomats and commercial consular staff for overseas service and international law. In addition, Ca&#x27; Foscari was also created to operate as a training college for secondary school teachers of commercial subjects. Foreign languages were taught from the start as well as the study of foreign cultures. The school was parallelled only by the Institut Supérieur de Commerce d&#x27;Anvers, founded in 1853 in Antwerp, Belgium. Today, Ca&#x27; Foscari is still a specialised university for the study of business economics, humanitites and languages.
Following the establishment of a national syllabus for university teaching in 1935, the Istituto Superiore di Economia e Commercio di Venezia, as it was by then called, was authorised to award four-year &quot;laurea&quot; degrees. In 1968 it obtained university status, and the name was changed to Università degli Studi di Venezia. In the following year two new faculties were created, of industrial chemistry and of philosophy and letters.

Currently, Ca&#x27; Foscari hosts eight strategic research centers: the Center for Cultural Heritage and Technology, the Euro-Mediterranean Center on Climate Change, the European Centre for Living Technology, the Center for Humanities and Social Change, the Institute for Global Challenges, the Marco Polo Centre, the Venice Centre for Digital and Public Humanities, and the Venice Centre in Economic and Risk Analytics for Public Policies.

==Organisation==
The university is divided into eight departments:
* Economics
* Philosophy and cultural heritage
* Management
* Environmental science, computer science and statistics
* Molecular science and nanosystems
* Linguistic and comparative cultural studies
* Humanities
* Asian and Mediterranean African studies

It also hosts the European Centre for Living Technology as well as a Law Center.

== Rankings ==
The QS World University Ranking by subject has placed Ca’ Foscari of Venice among the top 100 universities in the world for modern languages, among the top 150 in the world for humanities, and among the top 200 in the world for economics and management.

The university also ranked as the third best public university in Italy for their quality of research according to ANVUR (the National Agency for the Evaluation of University Research Systems) in 2018.

Designated for transfer to the Royal Navy under the Lend-Lease Agreement, she was renamed and launched as HMS &quot;Striker&quot; (D12), 7 May 1942; redesignated ACV-19, 20 August 1942; delivered to the United States Navy 28 April 1943; and transferred to the Royal Navy 18 May 1943. Redesignated CVE-19, on the US Navy List, 15 July 1943. During November and December 1944, she was in transit between Scotland and Australia with ferrying Mosquito aircraft for use in the Far East Theatre. From March to August 1945 the ship was part of the British Pacific Fleet attached to the 30th Aircraft Carrier Squadron as its flagship. She served with the Royal Navy throughout the remainder of World War II.

She was returned to the US Navy, at Norfolk, on 12 February 1946 and struck from the Naval Register on 28 March 1946. The ship was then sold to the Patapsco Steel Scrap Co., Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, on 5 June 1948 and scrapped.

==Design and description==
There were eight s in service with the Royal Navy during the Second World War. They were built between 1941 and 1942 by Ingalls Shipbuilding and Western Pipe &amp; Steel shipyards in the United States, both building four ships each.

The ships had a complement of 646 men and crew accommodation was different from the normal Royal Navy&#x27;s arrangements. The separate messes no longer had to prepare their own food, as everything was cooked in the galley and served cafeteria style in a central dining area. They were also equipped with a modern laundry and a barbershop. The traditional hammocks were replaced by three-tier bunk beds, eighteen to a cabin which was hinged and could be tied up to provide extra space when not in use.

The ships dimensions were; an overall length of , a beam of and a height of . They had a displacement of at deep load. Propulsion was provided by four diesel engines connected to one shaft giving , which could propel the ship at .

Aircraft facilities were a small combined bridge–flight control on the starboard side and above the flight deck, two aircraft lifts , and nine arrestor wires. Aircraft could be housed in the hangar below the flight deck. Armament comprised two 4&quot;/50, 5&quot;/38 or 5&quot;/51 in single mounts, eight 40 mm anti-aircraft gun in twin mounts and twenty-one 20 mm anti-aircraft cannons in single or twin mounts. They had the capacity for up to eighteen aircraft which could be a mixture of Grumman Martlet, Hawker Sea Hurricane, Vought F4U Corsair fighter aircraft and Fairey Swordfish or Grumman Avenger anti-submarine aircraft.

<text>The Alternative Music Foundation located at 924 Gilman Street, often referred to simply as &quot;Gilman&quot;, is a non-profit, all-ages, collectively organized music club. It is located in the West Berkeley area of Berkeley, California.

Gilman is mostly associated with being the springboard for the &#x27;90s punk revival led by bands like Green Day, Operation Ivy, Rancid, AFI, and The Offspring.

Gilman showcases mostly punk rock, specifically pop punk and hardcore punk acts, as well as heavy metal, industrial metal, grindcore, ska punk and, most recently, hip hop.

==History==

===Establishment===
As early as 1984, punk rock fan and &quot;Maximumrocknroll&quot; founder Tim Yohannan began thinking about the establishment of an all ages music space in the San Francisco Bay Area where bands could play and interact with audience members free of the structure of conventional music promotion. Actual organizational work began in 1985, with Yohannan joined in the effort by Victor Hayden, who had previously started a parallel project to start a punk club in Berkeley and who had already located a promising space in an industrial section of Berkeley. Although Yohannan initially had misgivings about the 924 Gilman Street location spotted by Hayden, he was ultimately persuaded that the building was a suitable space for the project which was envisioned. Negotiations began with the landlord and in April 1986 a lease was signed.

The organizing circle was expanded with a view to raising the $40,000 needed for rent and remodeling and for generating the volunteers necessary to make the construction project happen. Yohannan made use of his political connections and experience gained as a campaign volunteer for Berkeley Citizen&#x27;s Action Group, an organization which had won majority control of the Berkeley City Council, and was able to call upon friends sitting on various city boards, urging their cooperation with the new venture. Berkeley mayor Gus Newport was supportive and project organizers took care of every detail into winning the tacit approval for the project from businesses and residents of the area. The landlord also proved himself reliable and supportive of the goals of his new tenants.

Tim Yohannan later recalled:
&quot;We didn&#x27;t know shit about construction, and people were coming out of the woodwork, just showing up and helping—people who had the skills we needed, carpenters, plumbers, electricians. We had to build new bathrooms, etc., and pass the inspections. We got our final approval from the city the afternoon of our first show, which was New Year&#x27;s Eve, December 1986.&quot;

Rent on the 2,000 square foot building was $2,000 per month at the time of the club&#x27;s launch—regarded as a reasonable and manageable rate.

On December 31, 1986, the first musical performance was held at 924 Gilman. Since then, it has been one of the longest-running independent music venues in the United States. The club slowly progressed as a mecca for punk youth to get away from everyday issues at home, work, government, etc.

In its initial phase, hardcore punk shows were held three days a week—on Friday and Saturday nights as well as Sunday matinees. This quickly proved to be overwhelming for club volunteers, however, and as an alternative non-hardcore shows began to be run on Fridays by a separate crew of organizers. These Friday shows were more poorly attended than the Saturday night and Sunday afternoon hardcore extravaganzas but nevertheless served their purpose of providing an alternative venue to bands seeking to escape the grim reality of 21-and-over bar shows while allowing core volunteers to avoid the burnout associated with excessive event scheduling. This necessary scheduling adjustment had the serendipitous effect of diversifying and broadening the base of support for the 924 Gilman space.

===Founding principles===
As one early participant recalled, &quot;in order to not be closed down by local police we had to have rules, such as no drinking in or around the club, no fighting, things like that.&quot; This necessitated a regularized approach to security and resulted in events that were less violent than the 1980s hardcore norm, providing a more or less &quot;safe environment&quot; and sense of collective responsibility.

Josh Levine, a long time punk rock fan, band member, and 1986 Gilman volunteer later recalled:

&quot;There was something in the air, you could say, back then. A good feeling, or a sense of pulling together, and unity among people who just wanted to see bands that was free of sexism, homophobia, racism, and especially violence. Shows were not as safe then—there were shows I went to before Gilman where I got beat up... Shows where I went to jail, just for being a punk rock kid out after curfew. And worse, shows where I saw people getting beat up by skinheads, or jocks, and there was not a damn thing I could do about it if I wanted to stay healthy. Those were the kind of things that motivated us to get involved.&quot;

Despite a few early incidents of vandalism, a fertile creative environment rapidly developed. The venue saw the first public appearance of Operation Ivy, a thrashing ska-punk outfit that gained nearly instantaneous local popularity, and was a proving grounds for the young Green Day—the albums of whom helped to launch the Lookout Records empire of Larry Livermore and David Hayes. The eclectic sounds of this and other pioneer &quot;Gilman bands&quot; stood in contrast to the speed metal and ultra-aggressive hardcore which dominated the punk world during the middle 1980s.

Staying true to the &quot;independent spirit&quot; was also a major component of the venue&#x27;s philosophy, and many of the bands that started out at Gilman found themselves on the outs with the club after achieving mainstream success. Green Day&#x27;s song &quot;86&quot; from their album &quot;Insomniac&quot; is about being banned from the club after their major label debut &quot;Dookie&quot; was released.

===September 1988 closure===

Although the Gilman &quot;warehouse&quot; provided a vital all-ages venue and spawned a vibrant local musical scene, its success was neither inevitable nor linear. On September 11, 1988, citing the &quot;physical and emotional exhaustion&quot; of volunteers, ongoing problems with vandalism, and financial difficulties resulting from a $16,000 legal award to a slam dancer who had fallen and broken his arm in the pit, and expiration of the building lease, Gilman shut its doors. In a published eulogy by Tim Yohannan, Gilman was remembered as a fun place where &quot;the old macho bullshit got attacked&quot; and a stand had been made against &quot;creeping racist and fascist crap.&quot; The club&#x27;s core volunteers were not despondent, Yohannan noted, and hoped to &quot;arrange special shows at other existing venues&quot; in the future.

A note was scrawled on a scrap of paper and taped to the window by Yohannan, noting that the Gilman Street Project was &quot;now closed permanently due to lack of the creative juices necessary to make it worthwhile.&quot; Yohannan added that &quot;apathy and taking Gilman for granted&quot; had &quot;led to a consumerist attitude&quot; and that the decision had been made by core volunteers to &quot;work together in other ways.&quot;

Although the September closure spelled an end to Tim Yohannan&#x27;s personal connection with the club, core volunteers almost immediately reorganized to launch a &quot;new club&quot; at the 924 Gilman location, based upon the core principles established by the previous venture.

===2016 boycott===
In May 2016, members of the club&#x27;s community anonymously called for a boycott of 924 Gilman in online posts over Facebook and Tumblr citing several failures of the club in upholding its stated rules and ethics, notably a show featuring controversial hardcore punk bands Fang and Slapshot only narrowly being moved to an alternative venue, as well as allegations of sexism, transphobia and ableism made against some core volunteers at the time. Maximumrocknroll expressed support for the boycott, with then-editor Grace Ambrose stating that &quot;Gilman&#x27;s actions run counter to the spirit that propels MRR.&quot;

== Music ==
Gilman showcases mostly punk rock, running the gamut from hardcore punk and grindcore to pop punk and ska punk, including as well industrial metal and, most recently, hip hop.

Bands with major label contracts, including AFI, The Offspring, and Green Day, are only allowed to play the club when membership approves that individual show, a policy that enabled Green Day to play at Gilman again at least twice since they signed with a major label. Many of the other bands which have played the club in the past are now defunct. The venue still serves the East Bay and Northern California hardcore scene by bringing local, national, and international acts to the East Bay.

A 2004 history of the club, &quot;924 Gilman: The Story So Far&quot;, was written and edited by Brian Edge, who collected memories and anecdotes from many of the seminal contributors to the club&#x27;s day-to-day operations from 1986 through publication in 2004. The book is available through AK Press and also contains a full list of Gilman&#x27;s shows from 1986 through early 2004.

==Jello Biafra incident==

On May 7, 1994, an incident occurred in which former Dead Kennedys singer Jello Biafra was assaulted and injured. A group of rough slam dancers in the pit had been crashing into audience members. In the process one of these individuals, said to be a man using the punk rock name &quot;Cretin,&quot; knocked Biafra into a chair, with another rolling over his legs, causing serious damage to one knee and leg. Biafra is said to have yelled an epithet at the individual who crashed into him and demanded that he produce identification so that he could be billed for whatever hospital costs would ensue. A fight ensued, during which Biafra is said to have been knocked to the floor and held down, where he was kicked in the head by &quot;Cretin.&quot; During the incident others are said to have taunted Biafra, yelling &quot;rich rock star&quot; and &quot;sellout.&quot;

Police were called but &quot;Cretin&quot; and his friends escaped the premises in a van bearing Arizona plates. Biafra was hospitalized, where it was determined that he suffered detached ligaments and a broken leg. Biafra was also forced to cancel a scheduled spoken word tour as a result of the injuries he suffered. Biafra held &quot;Maximumrocknroll&quot; indirectly responsible for the incident, claiming that his assailants were repeating allegations that he was a &quot;rich rock star&quot; made in a column which had recently appeared in the magazine.

<text>USS &quot;Barnes&quot; (AVG-20/ACV-20/CVE-20) was a in the United States Navy. She was the second ship to carry the name.

&quot;Barnes&quot; was laid down under a Maritime Commission contract and was transferred to the United States Navy on 1 May 1942. The ship was launched on 22 May 1942 by Seattle-Tacoma Shipbuilding, Tacoma, Washington, sponsored by Mrs. G. L. Hutchinson, the widow of Lieutenant Hutchinson. &quot;Barnes&quot; was commissioned on 20 February 1943 with Captain Cato Douglas Glover in command. Originally classified AVG-20, she was reclassified ACV-20 on 20 August 1942, CVE-20 on 15 July 1943, and CVHE-20 on 12 June 1955.

==Service history==
The major task of &quot;Barnes&quot; throughout World War II was the transporting of aircraft and personnel from the United States to the forward areas of the Pacific. In addition she served as a combat, training and pilot qualifying carrier.

While performing these duties she launched her planes on several raids against Tarawa Atoll in the Gilbert Islands operation from 20 November–5 December 1943, and provided invaluable aircraft replenishment to the various task groups of the 3rd Fleet during the western Caroline Islands operation from 6 September–14 October 1944, and the Luzon attacks on 19 October 1944.

After Japan&#x27;s surrender, &quot;Barnes&quot; remained in the Far East on occupation duty until 3 November 1945. Returning to the United States in March 1946, &quot;Barnes&quot; remained on the West Coast for a period of time and then steamed to Boston, Massachusetts, where she was placed out of commission in reserve on 29 August 1946. Redesignated as a helicopter escort carrier (CVHE-20) on 12 June 1955, she was stricken for disposal on 1 March 1959.

==Awards==

<text>Workers&#x27; Cause Party (, PCO) is a political party in Brazil. Its origins can be traced back to 1978, when several Trotskyist activists who were not satisfied with the socialist international united under the name &quot;Tendência Trotskista do Brasil&quot; (&quot;Brazilian Trotskyist Tendency, TTB&quot;). However, the registered party was only established in 1995. Its electoral number is 29.

==History==

In 1980, this organization united itself with the newly formed Workers&#x27; Party (PT), becoming very involved in that decade&#x27;s municipal and state elections, with several mayors and state representatives elected.

In 1990 and 1991, however, several TTB members were expelled from the PT due to their non-commitment to the Party&#x27;s statutes. After that, the PCO was officially organized and founded in 1995.

In 2006, the candidacy of Rui Costa Pimenta to presidency was abrogated by the Superior Electoral Court.

In 2018, PCO supported the bid of Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva (PT), Fernando Haddad (PT) and Manuela D&#x27;Ávilla (PCdoB) informally and critically, refusing the invitation to compose the coalition (PT, PCdoB and PROS) officially.

In 2020, PCO suffered a cyber attack resulting in the loss of more than four thousand articles in its website.

In August 2021, PCO expressed support to the Taliban about their &quot;victory over American imperialism&quot;, considering it &quot;a victory for all oppressed people&quot;. The party has also praised Osama bin Laden, the leader of Al-Qaeda, describing him as &quot;an example of selflessness, conviction, disposition&quot; in the struggle for &quot;the freedom of his people&quot;. the PCO however follows the traditional trotskyist position of being against individual terrorism as its method of political struggle. The PCO also argues that the Taliban ideology and practices are &quot;an expression of the profound social backwardness of that people&quot;, it sees the need to support any movement of national liberation against US lead imperialism.

In 2022, the PCO supported the candidacy of Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva in the 2022 Brazilian general election, it however choose not to participate in the formal coalition or in any of the campaign committees because of divergences and repeated criticism of the program of the coalition.

==Youth wing==
The youth wing of the party is the Revolutionary Youth Alliance (AJR), which publishes the magazine &quot;Revista Juventude Revolucionária.&quot;

== Ideology ==
The PCO supports implementation of socialism, following the Trotskyist branch, which they regard as the true form of Marxism. According to them, the Marxist movement was corrupted by Stalinism and later by social movements such as bourgeois feminism and the LGBT movement, which they term as &quot;identitarian&quot;.

The party opposes gun control policies, saying that &quot;The bourgeoisie is armed. It has the army, the police and all other organs of repression, public or private. The people have nothing. It is defenseless in the face of the war machine of his enemies who control the State&quot;. However, the PCO also considers the police as an oppressive force and favors the formation of a &quot;popular police&quot;.

While opposing the PT due to that party&#x27;s controversial alliances in the political and business sectors, the PCO interprets the PT&#x27;s government as a necessary step in the current Brazilian political context, in order to strengthen workers&#x27; organizations. The party also sees the impeachment of Dilma Rousseff of 2016 as a &quot;coup d&#x27;etát&quot; and were also against Lula&#x27;s prison in 2018, protesting for his liberty afterwards.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, the PCO supported vaccination efforts while opposing mandatory vaccination.

The PCO is a staunch supporter of unrestricted free speech, asserting that the people should always be entitled to express their views and opinions, no matter how controversial, offensive or misleading they might be, and that any attempt of censorship will eventually result in the bourgeoisie controlling the public opinion. The party is unique in the Brazilian left in its opposition to anti-fake news legislation and the criminalizing of homophobia.

Alleging opposition to imperialism, the PCO supports Palestine and Hamas in the Israel–Hamas war, Venezuela in the Essequibo dispute and Russia in the Russo-Ukrainian War.

==Electoral history==
===Presidential elections===
=== Legislative elections ===

== Newspapers and magazines ==

* &quot;Jornal da Causa Operária (JCO)&quot; - Physical newspaper
* &quot;Diário da Causa Operária (DCO)&quot; - Current virtual newspaper
* &quot;Causa Operária TV&quot; - Official YouTube channel
* &quot;Rádio Causa Operária&quot; - Official radio station
* &quot;Revista Juventude Revolucionária&quot; - Revolutionary Youth Alliance magazine

==Controversies and criticism==
The PCO is accused by various media outlets, rival leftist parties (such as PT and PSOL) and former members of being a cult and having cult-like behavior, due to the fact that party members seriously defend the ideas of their party, its founder Rui Costa Pimenta and his family (their ideas are considered by detractors as reactionary and very close to a personality cult, in this case a personality cult around the Costa Pimenta family, the founding family of the PCO).

===Accusations of disrespect for human rights===
Because they support the Taliban, the PCO and its supporters are accused by some progressive movements (mainly women&#x27;s rights movements and LGBT movements) of disrespecting human rights, as they claim that PCO defends a hostile regime to women and other minorities (such as LGBTs and non-Muslims) and who make light of the fatal victims who had their rights disrespected by the Taliban.

===Attacks on other left-wing activists===
Despite being a leftist party, the PCO is notorious for its attacks against feminists, indigenous rights activists, landless movement, students and members of other left-wing parties, who accuse the PCO of truculence and of having a position similar to fascism.

===Accusations of authoritarianism and nepotism===
One of the reasons why the PCO is considered a cult (according to former members of the party) is due to the fact that the founder and leader of the party, Rui Costa Pimenta controls the PCO in an authoritarian way, with an iron fist (so that only his ideas and his wishes are respected), in addition to punishing detractors who are against his ideas (mostly with physical abuse) and handing over important (high-ranking) positions within the party to three of his children, Natália Pimenta, João Jorge Caproni Costa Pimenta and Carlos Henrique Caproni Pimenta. As a result, former members of the party accuse Costa Pimenta of practicing nepotism, since his three children got positions in the party not on their own merits, but because they were his sons (the youngest of his three children, Carlos Henrique Caproni Pimenta, was appointed to an important position within the party when he was still a teenager).

<doc id="463102" wikidata="Q5191474" url="?curid=463102" title="Crédit Mobilier scandal">
<text>The Crédit Mobilier scandal () was a two-part fraud conducted from 1864 to 1867 by the Union Pacific Railroad and the Crédit Mobilier of America construction company in the building of the eastern portion of the first transcontinental railroad from the Missouri River to Utah Territory. The story was broken by &quot;The New York Sun&quot; during the 1872 campaign of Ulysses S. Grant.

A new company, Crédit Mobilier of America, was created by Union Pacific executives to actually build the line, but at inflated construction costs. Though the railroad cost only $50 million to build, Crédit Mobilier billed $94 million and Union Pacific executives pocketed the excess $44 million. Part of the excess cash and $9 million in discounted stock was then used to bribe several Washington politicians for laws, funding, and regulatory rulings favorable to the Union Pacific.

The scandal negatively affected the careers of many politicians and nearly bankrupted Union Pacific. For decades partisan newspapers used the scandal to create widespread public distrust of Republicans, Congress, and the federal government during the Gilded Age.

== Background ==

The scandal&#x27;s origins dated to 1864, when the Union Pacific Railroad was chartered by Congress and the associated corporation Crédit Mobilier of America was established. This company had no relation to the major French bank &quot;Crédit Mobilier&quot;.

In the Pacific Railroad Acts of 1864–68, Congress authorized and chartered the Union Pacific Railroad and provided $100 million (equivalent to $ billion in ) in capital investment to complete a transcontinental line west from the Missouri River to the Pacific coast. The federal government offered to assist the railroad with a loan of $16,000 to $48,000 per mile of track, variable according to location, for a total of more than $60 million in all, and a land grant of , worth $50 to $100 million.

The offer initially attracted no subscribers for additional financing, as the conditions were financially daunting.

===Obstacles to investment===
The railroad would have to be built for through desert and mountains, incurring extremely high freight costs for supplies. There was the high risk of armed conflict with hostile tribes of Native Americans, who occupied many territories in the interior, and no probable early business to pay dividends.

There was no existing demand for railroad freight or passenger traffic for virtually the entire proposed route. Since no towns or cities of any size yet existed on the western prairies, there was no commercial activity between Nebraska and the California border. Nor were there any branch lines running either north or south of the proposed route that would have been able to feed their traffic to a new transcontinental railway. As a result, private investors refused to invest.

In spite of this, the entire railroad scheme was proposed as a &quot;going concern&quot; – a financially viable enterprise that relied on &quot;below-market&quot; financing and then could continue to function as a business enterprise, covering its operating expenses with freight and passenger revenues while providing profits for investors and interest payments to the US government for the borrowed capital (at the federal rate based upon the U.S. government bond rates), and ultimately retiring its debt to the U.S. government.

=== Opposition ===
Opponents of the Pacific Railroad Acts felt the construction and its routing were being developed without regard for creating a viable and profitable transportation enterprise.
They believed the whole project was a bare-faced fraud by some capitalists to build a &quot;railroad to nowhere&quot; and to make tremendous profits doing so, while getting the United States government to bear the costs.

== Formation of Crédit Mobilier of America ==
George Francis Train and Thomas C. Durant, the vice president of the Union Pacific Rail Road, formed Crédit Mobilier of America in 1864.

Crédit Mobilier of America was a deliberate façade. Train and Durant aimed to present to both the government and to the public the appearance that an independent corporate enterprise had been impartially chosen as the principal contractor and construction management firm for the project. In fact, Crédit Mobilier was created to shield the company&#x27;s shareholders and management from the common charge that they were using the &quot;construction&quot; phase of the project, as opposed to the &quot;operating&quot; phase, to generate profit. Because the conspirators believed they could not expect conventional profits from the operation of the railroad, they created the sham company so they could charge the U.S. government extortionate fees and expenses during the construction phase.

== Allegations ==
In simplified terms, the scheme worked as follows:

* The Union Pacific contracted with Crédit Mobilier to build the railway at rates greatly above cost. However the UP usually paid with UP shares, which were not highly rated because of the uncertainty that the huge project could be completed and would generate future profits.
* The railroad was eventually a success and made money from selling land. Thus it eventually brought high profits to Crédit Mobilier, which was owned by Durant and the Union Pacific&#x27;s other directors and principal stockholders.
* The outsize profits were divided among the Union Pacific stockholders.

The directors of the Union Pacific also engaged in stock manipulation circumventing requirements that they receive full payment for stock issued at par by instead paying Crédit Mobilier in bank checks, which Crédit Mobilier then used to purchase Union Pacific stock.

In every major construction contract drawn up between the Union Pacific and Crédit Mobilier, the contract&#x27;s terms, conditions, and price were offered and accepted through the actions of the same corporate officers and directors, operating on both sides of the contract. The underlying fraud of a common and unified ownership of two companies that shared principal officers and directors was not revealed for years.

=== Coverup ===
The principal means of the scheme was the method of indirect billing.

The Union Pacific presented genuine and accurate invoices to the U.S. government as evidence of actual construction costs billed to them by Crédit Mobilier of America for payment. Any audit of the Union Pacific invoices to the government would have revealed no evidence of fraud or profiteering, because the fraud took place one level deeper, on the invoices from Crédit Mobilier to Union Pacific. Union Pacific was accepting for payment genuine Crédit Mobilier invoices (based on fraudulent accounting) and was applying only an overhead expense for management and administration.

If the Union Pacific&#x27;s corporate officers had openly undertaken the management and construction of the railroad, this scheme to make windfall profits immediately from charges made during construction would have been exposed to public scrutiny by the opponents of the railroad project from the start.

=== Extent ===
The Union Pacific contracted at inflated prices with Crédit Mobilier to build the railway. The UP paid by check, and Crédit Mobilier used the checks to buy Union Pacific stock and bonds at par value. Crédit Mobilier then sold the UP stock and bonds on the open market, which resulted in a substantial gain for Crédit Mobilier. These inflated construction contracts and securities sales brought in enormous profits, which Crédit Mobilier split with the Union Pacific&#x27;s directors and principal stockholders, who also owned Crédit Mobilier.

The result of these machinations was that the U.S. Congress paid $94,650,287 to the Union Pacific and $50,720,959 to Crédit Mobilier. The arrangement between the Union Pacific and Crédit Mobilier thus generated $43,929,328 in profits for Crédit Mobilier. (Equivalent to over $1.1 billion in 2025.) Crédit Mobilier directors reported this as a cash profit of only $23,366,319.81, which amounted to a serious financial misrepresentation, since the same directors were the recipients of the undisclosed $20,563,010 that represented the Union Pacific&#x27;s share of the profits.

==Bribery==
Maury Klein, in his wide-ranging analysis of the scandal boils down the issue: &quot;Did the builders of the road defraud the government? And did they attempt to gain influence in Congress through bribery? The evidence suggested that the answer to the first was no, and to the second a qualified yes.&quot;

In 1867, Crédit Mobilier replaced Thomas Durant with Oakes Ames. Ames, a member of Congress, distributed cash bribes and discounted shares of Crédit Mobilier stock to fellow congressmen and other politicians in exchange for votes and actions favorable to the Union Pacific. Ames offered to members of Congress shares in Crédit Mobilier at its discounted par value rather than the market value, which was much higher due to its superb (but fraudulent) profits and exclusive contract with the Union Pacific Railroad. It also declared substantial quarterly dividends on its stock.

Those allowed to purchase shares at par value could reap enormous capital gains simply by offering these discounted shares on the market, knowing that they would be purchased at a higher price by investors desiring to own stock in such a profitable company. 
=== Revelation and political impact ===
Following a disagreement with Ames, Henry Simpson McComb leaked compromising letters to &quot;The New York Sun&quot;, a reformist newspaper highly critical of incumbent President Ulysses S. Grant and his administration.

On September 4, 1872, the &quot;Sun&quot; broke the story. The newspaper reported that Crédit Mobilier had received $72 million in contracts for building a railroad worth only $53 million.

After the revelations, the Union Pacific and other investors were left nearly bankrupt.

=== Congressional investigation ===
In 1872, the (Republican) House of Representatives submitted the names of nine politicians to the (Republican) Senate for investigation:

* Representative William B. Allison of Iowa
* Former Senator James A. Bayard Jr. of Delaware
* Former Representative George S. Boutwell of Massachusetts (then serving as United States Secretary of the Treasury)
* Senator Roscoe Conkling of New York
* Senator James Harlan of Iowa (retiring)
* Senator John Logan of Illinois
* Representative James W. Patterson of New Hampshire
* Senator Henry Wilson of Massachusetts, also Grant&#x27;s current running mate for Vice President
* Vice President Schuyler Colfax

All of those named were Republicans except Bayard, a Democrat who was largely dropped from the investigation after he wrote a letter disavowing any knowledge. Ultimately, Congress investigated 13 of its members in a probe that led to the censure of Oakes Ames and James Brooks, a Democrat from New York.

During the 1872 campaign, Grant&#x27;s running mate Henry Wilson initially denied involvement. However, in the February 1873 Senate investigation, Wilson admitted involvement and provided a complicated explanation claiming he had paid for stock in his wife&#x27;s name, and with her money but had never taken possession of the shares. According to Wilson, when his wife (and later he himself) had concerns about the transaction, the transaction was reversed. Wilson&#x27;s wife had died in 1870, so senators had to rely on Wilson&#x27;s word and that of Ames, whose account corroborated Wilson&#x27;s. The Senate accepted Wilson&#x27;s explanation, and took no action against him, but his reputation for integrity was somewhat damaged because of his initial denial.

Senator Henry L. Dawes of Massachusetts was also implicated. Dawes had purchased $1,000 in stock and had received a dividend. Dawes later had doubts about the propriety of the stock purchase and cancelled it. Ames returned the purchase price to Dawes with interest and Dawes returned the dividend to Ames. Dawes received $100 in interest on his returned purchase price, but he was not further implicated.

=== Department of Justice investigation ===
A Department of Justice investigation was also made with Aaron F. Perry as chief counsel. During the investigation, the government found that the company had given shares to more than 30 politicians from both parties, including James A. Garfield, Colfax, Patterson, and Wilson.

No charges were filed against any of the participants in the scandal. James A. Garfield denied the charges and was elected president in 1880.

==In popular culture==
This scheme was referenced in the AMC television series &quot;Hell on Wheels,&quot; (broadcast during 2011-2016) with the portrayal of Thomas Durant.

The scheme and scandal was proposed as a topic for a musical cabaret in season 10 of the FXX television series &quot;Archer&quot;.

<doc id="463108" wikidata="Q312721" url="?curid=463108" title="Red Cloud">
<text>Red Cloud (; – December 10, 1909) was a leader of the Oglala Lakota from 1865 to 1909. He was one of the most capable Native American opponents whom the United States Army faced in the western territories. He led the Lakota to victory over the United States during Red Cloud&#x27;s War, establishing the Lakota as the only nation to defeat the United States on American soil. The largest action of the war was the 1866 Fetterman Fight, with 81 US soldiers killed; it was the worst military defeat suffered by the US Army on the Great Plains until the Battle of the Little Bighorn 10 years later.

After signing the Treaty of Fort Laramie (1868), Red Cloud led his people in the transition to reservation life. Some of his opponents mistakenly thought of him as the overall leader of the Sioux groups (Dakota, Lakota, and Nakota), but the large tribe had several major divisions and was highly decentralized. Bands among the Oglala and other divisions operated independently, though some individual leaders were renowned as warriors and highly respected as leaders, such as Red Cloud.

==Early life==
Red Cloud was born close to the forks of the Platte River, near the modern-day city of North Platte, Nebraska. His mother, Walks as She Thinks, was an Oglala Lakota and his father, Lone Man, was a Brulé Lakota leader. They came from two of the seven major Lakota divisions.

As was traditional among the matrilineal Lakota, in which the children belonged to the mother&#x27;s clan and people, Red Cloud was mentored as a boy by his maternal uncle, Chief Old Smoke (1774–1864). Chief Old Smoke played a major role in the boy&#x27;s childhood, as the leader of the Bad Faces. He brought Red Cloud into the Smoke household when the boy&#x27;s parents died around 1825. At a young age, Red Cloud fought against neighboring Pawnee and Crow bands, gaining much war experience.

==Warriorship==

===Red Cloud&#x27;s War===
Red Cloud&#x27;s War was the name the U.S. Army gave to a series of conflicts fought with Native American Plains tribes in the Wyoming and Montana Territories. The battles were waged between the Northern Cheyenne, allied with Lakota and Arapaho bands, against the Army from 1866 to 1868. In December 1866, the Native American allies attacked and defeated a United States unit in what they would call the Fetterman Massacre (or the Battle of the Hundred Slain), which resulted in the most U.S. casualties of any Plains battle up to that point.
Captain William J. Fetterman was sent from Fort Phil Kearny with two civilians and 79 cavalry and infantrymen to chase away a small Native American war party that had attacked a wood-gathering party days before. Captain Frederick Brown accompanied Fetterman; the two were confident in their troops and anxious to go to battle with the Native Americans. They disobeyed orders to stay behind the Lodge Trail Ridge and pursued a small decoy band of warriors led by a Native American on an injured horse. The decoy was the prominent warrior Crazy Horse. Fetterman and his troops followed the decoy into an ambush by more than 2,000 Sioux, Cheyenne, and Arapaho. Combined Native American forces suffered only 14 casualties, while they killed the entire 81-man U.S. detachment.

Following this battle, a U.S. peace commission toured the Plains in 1867 to gather information to help bring about peace among the tribes and with the U.S. Finding that the Native Americans had been provoked by white encroachment and competition for resources, the commission recommended assigning definite territories to the Plains tribes. The Lakota, Northern Cheyenne, Arapaho, and other bands settled for peace with the U.S. under the Treaty of Fort Laramie. The U.S. agreed to abandon its forts and withdraw from Lakota territory.

===Treaty of 1868===

The treaty established the Great Sioux Reservation, covering the territory of West River, west of the Missouri River in present-day Nebraska (which had been admitted as a state in 1867), and including parts of South Dakota. Uneasy relations between the expanding United States and the natives continued. In 1870, Red Cloud visited Washington D.C. and met with Commissioner of Indian Affairs Ely S. Parker (a Seneca and U.S. Army General), and President Ulysses S. Grant.

In 1871, the government established the Red Cloud Agency on the Platte River, downstream from Fort Laramie. By 1874 it had been moved to Nebraska, with Fort Robinson located nearby. Red Cloud took his band to the agency (a predecessor of the Native American reservation), ready to receive government aid. Yet that aid was usually less than stipulated, and usually inferior in quality.

According to Charles A. Eastman (Ohiyesa) Red Cloud was the last to sign &quot;..having refused to do so until all of the forts within their territory should be vacated. All of his demands were acceded to, the new road abandoned, the garrisons withdrawn, and the new treaty distinctly stated that the Black Hills and the Big Horn were Indian countries, set apart for their perpetual occupancy and that no white man should enter that region without the consent of the Sioux. ... Scarcely was this treaty signed, however, when gold was discovered in the Black Hills, and the popular cry was: &quot;Remove the Indians!&quot;... The government, at first, entered some small protest, just enough to &quot;save its face&quot;... but there was no serious attempt to prevent the wholesale violation of the treaty and the loss of the Black Hills.&quot;

===Great Sioux War of 1876===

Red Cloud settled at the agency with his band by the fall of 1873. He soon became embroiled in a controversy with the new Indian agent, Dr. John J. Saville.

In 1874, Lieutenant Colonel George Custer led a reconnaissance mission into Sioux territory that reported gold in the Black Hills, an area held sacred by the local Native Americans. Previously, the army had unsuccessfully tried to keep miners out of the region, and the threat of violence grew. In May 1875, Lakota delegations headed by Red Cloud, Spotted Tail, and Lone Horn traveled to Washington in an attempt to persuade President Grant to honor existing treaties and stem the flow of miners into their lands. The Native Americans met on various occasions with Grant, Secretary of the Interior Delano, and Commissioner of Indian Affairs Smith. He told them on May 27 that Congress was ready to resolve the matter by paying the tribes $25,000 for their land and resettling them into Indian Territory. The delegates refused to sign such a treaty, with Spotted Tail saying about the proposal:

When I was here before, the President gave me my country, and I put my stake down in a good place, and there I want to stay. ... You speak of another country, but it is not my country; it does not concern me, and I want nothing to do with it. I was not born there. ... If it is such a good country, you ought to send the white men now in our country there and let us alone.

Although Red Cloud was unsuccessful in finding a peaceful solution, he did not take part in the Great Sioux War of 1876, which was led by &quot;Tȟašúŋke Witkó&quot; (Crazy Horse) and &quot;Tȟatȟáŋka Íyotake&quot; (Sitting Bull).

In the fall of 1877, the Red Cloud Agency was removed to the upper Missouri River. The following year, it was removed to the forks of the White River in present-day South Dakota, where it was renamed the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation.

==Later life and death==
Red Cloud became a leader of the Lakota as they transitioned from the freedom of the plains to the confinement of the reservation system. His trip to Washington, DC, had convinced him of the number and power of European Americans, and he believed the Oglala had to seek peace.

Around 1880, he visited (not for the first time) the paleontologist and geologist Othniel Marsh in New Haven, Connecticut. Marsh had first visited the Red Cloud Agency in 1874, alleging, among other things, that &quot;the Indians suffered for want of food and other supplies because they were cheated out of annuities and beef cattle and were issued inedible pork, inferior flour, poor sugar and coffee and rotten tobacco.&quot;

In 1884, he and his family, along with five other leaders, converted and were baptized as Catholics by Father Joseph Bushman.

Red Cloud continued fighting for his people, even after being forced onto the reservation. In 1887, he opposed the Dawes Act, which broke up communal tribal holdings and allocated plots of land for subsistence farming to heads of families on tribal rolls. The U.S. declared additional communal tribal lands as excess and sold them to immigrant settlers. In 1889, Red Cloud opposed a treaty to sell more of the Lakota land. Due to his steadfastness, and that of Sitting Bull, government agents obtained the necessary signatures for approval only through subterfuge, such as using the signatures of children. Red Cloud negotiated strongly with Indian Agents such as Dr. Valentine McGillycuddy.

A few years before he died, Red Cloud and his wife got baptized as Christians and adopted the named John and Mary. 

In 1909, Red Cloud died on Pine Ridge Reservation. At 87 years old, he outlived nearly all the other major Lakota leaders of the Indian Wars. He was buried there in a cemetery that now bears his name. In old age, he is quoted as having said, &quot;They made us many promises, more than I can remember. But they kept but one – They promised to take our land ... and they took it.&quot;

==Legacy and honors==

Announcements of Red Cloud&#x27;s death and recognition of his achievements were printed in major newspapers across the country. As had been typical of the U.S. perception during Red Cloud&#x27;s prominence in war, &quot;The New York Times&quot; article on his death mistakenly described him as leader of all the Sioux bands and tribes but noted his abilities as a leader and diplomat. This misconception was echoed by early white historians such as Grace Raymond Hebard and Earl Alonzo Brininstool, who judged &quot;Red Napoleon of the Plains&quot; a &quot;most fitting title&quot; for Red Cloud. While he was a prominent leader, the Lakota were highly decentralized and never had one overall leader, especially in the major divisions, such as Oglala and Brulé.

In 1871, the town of Red Cloud was named in his honor.

Red Cloud was the most photographed American Indian of the nineteenth century. There are 128 known photographs picturing Red Cloud. He was first photographed in 1872 in Washington D.C. by Mathew Brady, just before meeting with President Grant. He was also among the Indians photographed by Edward S. Curtis.

He has been honored by the United States Postal Service with a 10¢ Great Americans series postage stamp.

In 2000, he was posthumously inducted into the Nebraska Hall of Fame.

A parochial school on the Pine Ridge Reservation was established at the request of Red Cloud. The Red Cloud Indian School remains in use over a century later. In 2023, the school elected to rebrand to the Lakota language translation of Red Cloud’s name - ‘Maȟpíya Lúta’

Theodore Sorensen wrote in &quot;Kennedy&quot; that President John F. Kennedy considered naming one of the 41 for Freedom ballistic missile submarines after Red Cloud but bowed to Pentagon concerns that the name could be misinterpreted as being pro-Communist even though Red Cloud was not a Communist, owing to the symbolism of the time (early 1960s, during the Cold War era) using the color red to represent Communism.
==Descendants of Red Cloud==
Red Cloud&#x27;s descendants have continued to be chosen as traditional leaders of the Lakota people:
*Jackson &quot;Jack&quot; Red Cloud, (–1918) leader of the Oglala Lakota 1909–1918
*James Henry Red Cloud (1877–1960) leader of the Oglala Lakota 1918–1960
*Charles Red Cloud (1884–1980) (brother of James Henry Red Cloud), leader of the Oglala Lakota 1960–1979
*Oliver Red Cloud (1919–2013) (son of Charles Red Cloud), leader of the Oglala Lakota (1979–2013). He was a fourth-generation direct descendant of Red Cloud. He was a Speaker of the traditional Lakota Sioux Nation and a chairman of the Black Hills Sioux Nation Treaty Council.

<text>Doublemint is a variety of chewing gum made by the Wrigley Company; according to early advertisements, it is &quot;double strength&quot; peppermint flavored. It was launched in the United States in 1914, and has had variable market share since then.

==The Doublemint Twins history==

As a play on the word &quot;double&quot; in the name, one of the most notable aspects of this brand is the advertising campaign featuring identical twins wearing matching outfits. Beginning in 1939 with stylized illustrations of twins, advertisements continued with print ads and later television commercials, featuring actual twins as spokespersons. 

The first set of women to portray the Doublemint Twins, were sisters Marie and Mildred Maier of Silverhill, Alabama.

New Doublemint Twins were heard on the radio at WBBM-AM. Jane and Joan Boyd were regular performers as the Doublemint Twins on &quot;The Music Wagon,&quot; a program on WBBM from 1957 until 1963. This program was hosted by Mal Bellairs whose notes indicate the understanding that the Boyds were the first Doublemint Twins.
 
The first Doublemint Twins to appear on television came along in 1959. The role belonged to 21-year-old twins Jane and Joan Knoerzer (professionally using their mother&#x27;s maiden name, Boyd) of Hammond, Indiana, who appeared in advertisements for Doublemint until 1963 when Joan became pregnant. The company, however, continued sporadically to promote the campaign, which included twins Jennie and Terrie Frankel in the late 1960s; later &quot;Doublemint Twins&quot; included June and Patricia Mackrell through the 1970s (who had also been the Toni Twins for Toni Home Permanent, which used the slogan &quot;Which twin has the Toni?&quot;), Patricia and Priscilla (aka Cybil or &quot;Cyb&quot;) Barnstable, Denise and Dian Gallup, Cynthia and Brittany Daniel (future co-stars as the Wakefield twins in the TV series based on the &quot;Sweet Valley High&quot; novels), Tia and Tamera Mowry in the early 90s (future co-star of &quot;The Game&quot; with both Tia Mowry and Brittany Daniel and future co-stars of &quot;Sister, Sister&quot;), Heidi and Alissa Kramer, figure skaters Pamela and Jeremy Green, and Jean (née Barbara) and Elizabeth Sagal (daughters of TV director Boris Sagal and sisters of &quot;Married... with Children″s&quot; Katey Sagal). The Sagal twins enjoyed a brief run as the stars of a sitcom, &quot;Double Trouble&quot;, in 1984. Later twins projected more sex appeal in keeping with trends in American advertising; the Barnstable twins were later asked to pose for &quot;Playboy&quot; due to their popularity as spokeswomen for the gum. In 1987, Denise and Dian Gallup spoofed their roles as the Doublemint Twins in cameo roles in the Mel Brooks film, &quot;Spaceballs&quot;.

==&quot;Doublemint&quot; trademark denied in EU==
In 2004, the European Union Court of Justice ultimately denied Wrigley&#x27;s request for trademark status on the name &quot;Doublemint&quot;; the Court found that the mark DOUBLEMINT was descriptive of the product and in violation of trademark law.

==Known ingredients==
The actual flavorings used in Doublemint gum are a trade secret, but the company does say that the main flavor ingredient is peppermint. Although it is not a sugarless gum, in 2003 Wrigley&#x27;s replaced some of the sugar with artificial sweeteners aspartame and acesulfame potassium.
;Listed
Sugar, gum base, dextrose, corn syrup, natural and artificial flavors; less than 2% of glycerol, aspartame, gum arabic, soy lecithin, acesulfame K, color (titanium dioxide, blue 1 lake, beta-carotene), BHT

==The 2008 Commercial==
R&amp;B singer Chris Brown performed a modified version of &quot;Forever&quot; in a 2008 commercial for Doublemint, which introduced a thinner Plen-T-Pack package.

<text>A bathymetric chart is a type of isarithmic map that depicts the submerged bathymetry and physiographic features of ocean and sea bottoms. Their primary purpose is to provide detailed depth contours of ocean topography as well as provide the size, shape and distribution of underwater features. 

Topographic maps display elevation above ground (topography) and are complementary to bathymetric charts. Bathymetric charts showcase depth using a series of lines and points at equal intervals, called depth contours or isobaths (a type of contour line). A closed shape with increasingly smaller shapes inside of it can indicate an ocean trench or a seamount, or underwater mountain, depending on whether the depths increase or decrease going inward.

Bathymetric surveys and charts are associated with the science of oceanography, particularly marine geology, and underwater engineering or other specialized purposes.

Bathymetric data used to produce charts can also be converted to bathymetric profiles which are vertical sections through a feature.

== History ==
=== Ancient Egypt ===

The use of bathymetry and the development of bathymetric charts dates back around the 19th century BC to ancient Egypt. Depictions on tomb walls such as the bas-relief carvings of Deir al-Bahri commissioned by Queen Hatshepsut in the 16th century BC show ancient mariners using long slender poles as sounding poles to determine the depth of the Nile River and into the Nile River Delta.

=== Ancient Greece ===

The first written account and mapped records of sounding did not occur until 1000 years after the Egyptians had begun sounding and mapping the Nile. The Greek historian Herodotus writes of a sounding in 66 feet of water of the mouth of the Nile in the river delta. He writes of yellow mud being brought up similar to the same that was deposited with the yearly floods. These accounts show a heightened awareness of regional depths and seafloor characteristics among ancient mariners and demonstrate that discoveries in bathymetry and the use of bathymetric charts had progressed significantly.

=== Ancient Rome ===
The New Testament recounts soundings being taken with the shipwreck of Paul on the island of Malta in the Book of Acts. Chapter 27, verses 27-44 recount the experience:27 &quot;...as we were driven up and down in Adria, about midnight the shipmen deemed that they drew near to some country;&quot;

28 &quot;And sounded, and found it twenty fathoms: and when they had gone a little further, they sounded again, and found it fifteen fathoms.&quot;

29 &quot;Then fearing lest we should have fallen upon rocks, they cast four anchors out of the stern...&quot;

39 &quot;And when it was day, they knew not the land...&quot;

40 &quot;And when they had taken up the anchors, they committed themselves unto the sea . . . and made toward shore.&quot;

41 And falling into a place where two seas met, they ran the ship aground; and the forepart stuck fast, and remained unmoveable, but the hinder part was broken with the violence of the waves.Verse 39 states that &quot;they knew not the land&quot; indicating that their knowledge of sea was obtained from the experiences of others as well as the memory of having been there before. Sailing directions called a periplus did exist by the First Century A.D. giving general coastal configurations. Commercially available charts of the depths of the sea and surrounding coast would not be available for almost another thousand years.

=== Early modern period ===

Up to this point, bathymetric charts were rare as mariners continued to rely on heavy ropes and lead weights to take depth readings and chart the open ocean. Minor advances in the surveying and depth charting of the oceans occurred in the 200 years since Columbus sailed to the Americas. In 1647, Robert Dudley published the atlas, &#x27;Dell&#x27;Arcano del Mare&#x27; (Secrets of the Sea). His work far outpaced anything that had been published previously with maps and charts constructed in the Mercator projection as well as containing some of the first charts to show printed depths on the North American Atlantic Seaboard. His publication provided the groundwork for future mariners and inventors to continue to develop new and inventive ways to produce high quality charts and surveys of the world&#x27;s lakes and oceans.

== Comparison with hydrographic chart ==
A bathymetric chart differs from a hydrographic chart in that accurate presentation of the underwater features is the goal, while safe navigation is the requirement for the hydrographic chart.

A hydrographic chart will obscure the actual features to present a simplified version to help mariners avoid underwater hazards.

== Joining a bathymetric chart and topographic map ==
In an ideal case, the joining of a bathymetric chart and topographic map of the same scale and projection of the same geographic area would be seamless. The only difference would be that the values begin increasing after crossing the zero at the designated sea level datum. Thus the topographic map&#x27;s mountains have the greatest values while the bathymetric chart&#x27;s greatest depths have the greatest values.

Simply put, the bathymetric chart is intended to show the land if overlying waters were removed in exactly the same manner as the topographic map.

== Within hydrography ==
Bathymetric surveys are a subset of the science of hydrography. They differ slightly from the surveys required to create the product of hydrography in its more limited application and as conducted by the national and international agencies tasked with producing charts and publications for safe navigation. That chart product is more accurately termed a navigation or hydrographic chart with a strong bias toward the presentation of essential safety information.

<text>Events in the year 1920 in [[Germany]].

== Incumbents ==
===National level===

* Chancellor - Gustav Bauer (Social Democrats) (to 26 March), Hermann Müller (Social Democrats) (to 21 June), Constantin Fehrenbach (Centre) (from 25 June)

== Overview ==
The Treaty of Versailles in the previous year resulted in Germany losing several provinces. The most important changes were the loss of Alsace-Lorraine to France and of a large stretch of territory in West Prussia, Posen, and Upper Silesia to Poland. The territory ceded to Poland amounted to nearly , and, coupled with the establishment of Danzig as an independent state, which was also imposed upon Germany, this had the effect of cutting off East Prussia from the main territory of Germany.

Danzig and Memel were to be ceded to the Allies, their fate to be subsequently decided. A portion of Silesia was to be ceded to Czechoslovakia. The treaty also provided for plebiscites to be held in certain areas to decide their destinies. Certain districts of East Prussia and West Prussia were to be polled to decide whether they should belong to Germany or to Poland. A third portion of Silesia, which was in dispute between Germany and Poland, was to exercise the right of self-determination. The small districts of Eupen and Malmedy were to decide whether they would belong to Belgium or to Germany. The middle and southern districts of the province of Schleswig, which had been annexed to Prussia in 1866, were to decide their own destinies. Finally, the coal-producing valley of the Saarland, which had been provisionally separated from Germany, was to be the subject of a referendum after the lapse of fifteen years.
Raoul Hausmann, George Grosz, Hannah Höch and other artists helped establish the Berlin wing of the Dada movement, an avant garde artistic movement that defied the established forms of classical art. Photomontage, a technique Hausmann claims to have originated with Höch in 1918, becomes associated with Berlin Dada style.

== Events ==
===Internal territorial changes in Germany===
During the war, the 26 states of the German federation had been reduced by one with the merger of the principalities of Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt and Schwarzburg-Sondershausen. After the revolution, Alsace-Lorraine was returned to France, and the two principalities of Reuss united into a single state. The Duchy of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha split into two halves; Coburg voluntarily united with Bavaria, and Gotha entered into negotiations with a number of the other small states of central Germany to bring about a general union of the little republics concerned. Six states took part in these negotiations, which were brought to a successful conclusion at the end of December 1919, when Schwarzburg, Reuss, Gotha, Saxe-Weimar, Saxe-Meiningen and Saxe-Altenburg united. The total population of these united states was just over 1,500,000, and their joint area was just over . The states took the name of Thuringia (&quot;Einheitsstaat Thüringen&quot;) and the town of Weimar was made the capital of the new state.

===Political situation at the beginning of the year===
From the time of the revolution until the end of 1919, the Liberal and Radical parties in combination with the so-called Majority Social Democratic Party had held power continuously, and were confirmed in their position by the general election held in January 1919. The results were similar to those for the old Reichstag in the time of the Empire. 

In March, following months of instability, the president asked Hermann Müller, who had previously held the office of minister for foreign affairs, to form an administration. Within forty-eight hours it was announced that Müller had succeeded in forming a cabinet, which included (as did the previous administration) members of all the three moderate parties, the Catholic Centre Party, the Democrats, and the Majority Social Democrats. The new cabinet was composed as follows:

Müller&#x27;s tenure of the Foreign Office was only temporary, and before the middle of April he relinquished that position to Dr. Adolf Köster. 

===Ruhr uprising===
As soon as he assumed office Müller had to deal with insurrection in the Ruhr valley and the neutral zone generally. The German government applied to the Allies for permission to send troops into the disturbed districts in excess of the numbers allowed by the Treaty of Versailles. The British and Italian governments made various suggestions for a temporary modification of certain provisions of the Treaty of Versailles (Articles 42 to 44). The French government, however, declared that if the Germans were allowed to send forces into the Ruhr District, the French should be allowed to occupy Frankfurt, Homburg, and other neighbouring German towns during the period that the German troops were in the neutral zone. The German government rejected the French suggestion of a parallel occupation. On 3 April, German regular troops of the Reichswehr, under General Oskar von Watter, entered the neutral zone in force, and experienced little difficulty in dealing with the armed leftist workers. The revolutionary headquarters at Mülheim were taken on April 4. Immediately after the German troops crossed the line, the French government itself gave orders to its own troops to advance, proclaiming the necessity of this move on the grounds that Articles 42 to 44 of the Treaty of Versailles had been broken by the Germans. The population of Frankfurt was hostile, and the British government regarded the advance as an extreme measure which should only have been adopted in the last resort. The British held that the enforcement of the terms of the Treaty of Versailles was an affair for the Allies collectively, and not for any single Allied government.

Müller complained of French militarism, and in particular that Senegalese negro troops should have been quartered in Frankfurt University. He blamed Kapp and his associates for the fact that the working classes had now lost confidence in the republican army. In the disturbed area, 160 German officers and men had been killed and nearly 400 had been wounded. 

The San Remo conference, a meeting of the Supreme Council, consisting of the British, French, and Italian prime ministers, was opened on 19 April; it dealt, among other questions, with the German invasion of the Ruhr Valley, and with the problem of disarmament. David Lloyd George, with the support of Francesco Saverio Nitti, proposed that the German government should be invited to attend the conference; but this was opposed by Alexandre Millerand. The result of the discussions at San Remo on the German question was that a note dealing with the question of disarmament was sent to the German government at the end of April, stating that it was impossible for the Allied governments even to consider the German request for an increase in troop allowances whilst Germany failed to fulfil its obligations under the Treaty of Versailles. The rapidity with which the Reichswehr overcame the insurgents made it possible for the German government to withdraw the troops quickly. At the end of April the foreign minister, Adolf Köster, declared that the French ought now to evacuate Frankfurt, Darmstadt, and Homburg, because the German troops had been reduced to 17,500. The Allied side stated that the force must be reduced forthwith to twenty battalions, six squadrons, and two batteries; and that even this force would have to be replaced entirely by a body of 10,000 police by July 10. The German government made the necessary reductions, and on May 17 the French evacuated Frankfurt and the other occupied towns.

===General election and new government===
The German government arranged a general election for Sunday, 6 June, and about 80% of the voters exercised their rights. The three moderate parties, which had been in an overwhelming majority both in the last imperial Reichstag and also in the new republican National Assembly, were returned with a much smaller majority over the right and left political wings combined. 
The Communists enteredthe contest, and a rout of the Spartacists, who won only two seats, was tempered by the success of the Independent Social Democrat, one of the most extreme Socialist parties in Europe, who increased their membership of the house from 22 to 80. This success was gained at the expense of the Majority Social Democrats, previously the largest party in the National Assembly. 

After several politicians had attempted in vain to form a new cabinet, Constantin Fehrenbach, one of the most respected leaders of the Centre Party, succeeded in doing so. The German People&#x27;s Party, led by Gustav Stresemann, agreed to unite with the Centre and Democrats to form a government. The Majority Social Democrats would not join a ministry which included the German People&#x27;s Party, but agreed to lend the new government their general support in the Reichstag. Fehrenbach had entered the Bavarian parliament as a Catholic and a representative of Freiburg, and in 1919 he became president of the National Assembly.Rudolf Heinze became vice-chancellor and minister for justice, Dr. Walter Simons became foreign minister, Joseph Wirth became minister of finance, Erich Koch-Weser was minister of the interior, and Johannes Giesberts was minister of posts. Former defence minister Gustav Noske was not a member of the new cabinet. 

===Spa conference===

At the meeting of the Supreme Council at San Remo in April it was decided to invite the German government to a conference at Spa, in Belgium, in order to settle the questions relating to disarmament and reparations which arose under the terms of the Treaty of Versailles. The Spa Conference was held during the first half of July, and Fehrenbach himself attended the conference at which Lloyd George and Millerand were also present. Before going into the conference with the Germans the Allies agreed amongst themselves as to the proportions of the total German reparation which should be allotted to each of the Allied countries. Thus France was to receive 52%, the British Empire 22%, Italy 10%, Belgium 8%, and Serbia 5%, the small remaining proportion to be divided amongst other claimants. Apart from her 8% Belgium was to have the privilege of transferring her entire war debt to Germany&#x27;s shoulders, and she was also to have a prior claim upon the first £100,000,000 paid by Germany. These proportions were settled, but the total amount to be paid by Germany was not decided.

The conference was to have been opened on July 5, and a preliminary sitting was in fact held on that day, but owing to the non-arrival of Otto Gessler, the German minister of defense, it was not possible to proceed with the serious consideration of the first subject on the agenda, which was the question of German disarmament. The conference was held under the presidency of the Belgian prime minister, Léon Delacroix, and the Belgian foreign minister, Paul Hymans, also attended. The British representatives, in addition to Lloyd George himself, were Lord Curzon and Sir Laming Worthington-Evans. The chief Italian representative was Count Sforza, the distinguished and successful foreign minister. The German chancellor was accompanied by Simons and Wirth.

On the following day Gessler arrived, and he proceeded at once to make a formal request that the 100,000 men, which was the limit of the German army allowed by the treaty, should continue to be exceeded, on the ground that it was impossible for the government to keep order with such a small force. Lloyd George then explained the reasons for the Allies&#x27; anxiety. He said that the treaty allowed Germany 100,000 men, 100,000 rifles, and 2,000 machine guns. Germany, however, still possessed a regular army of 200,000 men, and also possessed 50,000 machine guns, and 12,000 guns. Moreover, she had only surrendered 1,500,000 rifles, although it was obvious that there must be millions of rifles in the country. During the discussions on the following days it transpired from statements made by the chief of the General Staff himself, General von Seeckt, that in addition to the Reichswehr there were various other organized forces in Germany such as the Einwohnerwehr and the Sicherheitspolizei. The Einwohnerwehr alone appear to have numbered over 500,000 men. General von Seeckt proposed that the regular army should be reduced gradually to 100,000 men by October 1921. A discussion upon this matter took place between the Allies, and it was decided that Germany should be given until January 1, 1921, to reduce the strength of the Reichswehr to the treaty figure of 100,000 men. The exact conditions laid down were that Germany should reduce the Reichswehr to 150,000 men by October 1, withdraw the arms of the Einwohnerwehr and the Sicherheitspolizei, and issue a proclamation demanding the surrender of all arms in the hands of the civilian population, with effective penalties in the event of default. On July 9 the German delegates signed the agreement embodying these stipulations in regard to disarmament.

The later sittings of the conference were concerned with the question of the trial of the German &quot;war criminals&quot;, the delivery of coal as a form of reparation, and various other financial matters. It was the question of coal which required the closest attention, largely owing to the extreme need of France for supplies of coal, and the agreement relating to this matter was signed on July 16. It was decided that for six months after August 1 the German government should deliver up 2,000,000 tons of coal per month.

The question of the war criminals referred to above had been under discussion since the beginning of the year. The Treaty of Versailles had required that certain persons with an especially evil record in the war should be handed over to the Allies. Lists of the chief persons coming under the heading of &quot;war criminals&quot; were published by the Allied governments at the end of January. The lists included a number of very well known persons, such as the Crown Prince Rupprecht of Bavaria, Field Marshal August von Mackensen, General von Kluck, Admiral von Tirpitz, and Admiral von Capelle. However, the ex-Emperor Wilhelm had fled to the Netherlands, and since the Dutch government definitely declined to hand him over to the Allies, it was generally held, especially in Britain, that it was difficult to press forward very vigorously with the punishment of those who, however important their positions, had only been the emperor&#x27;s servants. It was therefore subsequently decided that the German government itself should be instructed to proceed with the punishment of the war criminals concerned. But it transpired at Spa that the German government had been extremely dilatory in taking the necessary proceedings.

===Rest of 1920===
The last five months of the year were much less eventful in Germany. The country was still suffering from a shortage of food, though not in the acute degree which was so painfully characteristic of Austria and also of some of the other countries farther east. The German government appears to have made serious efforts to comply with their treaty obligations regarding disarmament and reparation. Thus, in the three weeks following the Spa Conference over 4,000 heavy guns and field guns were destroyed; and measures were taken to obtain the very large number of arms which existed all over the country in the hands of the civilian population. Great numbers of livestock were also handed over to the Allies. Thus France received from Germany (up to November 30) over 30,000 horses, over 65,000 cattle, and over 100,000 sheep. Belgium received, up to the same date, 6,000 horses, 67,000 cattle, and 35,000 sheep.

The financial position of the country remained extremely serious. The total national debt (funded debt and floating debt) amounted to 200,000,000,000 marks, that is, £10,000,000,000 sterling at the old prewar rate of exchange. The anticipated revenue for the year 1920–21 was 27,950,000,000 marks, and the anticipated ordinary expenditure was 23,800,000,000 marks. There was, however, also an anticipated extraordinary expenditure of no less than 11,600,000,000 marks. A heavy deficit on the railways was also expected. The exchange value of the mark had fallen disastrously since the armistice, and though it rose towards the end of the year, the mark was still reckoned at over 200 to the pound sterling in December.

Various statistics of population were published during the year. Among other significant features, it was stated that the number of children under five years of age, in the whole of the territories of the former Hohenzollern empire, had sunk from 8,000,000 in 1911 to 5,000,000 in 1919.

<doc id="463115" wikidata="Q574711" url="?curid=463115" title="Anti-Monopoly">
<text>Anti-Monopoly is a board game made by San Francisco State University Professor Ralph Anspach in response to &quot;Monopoly&quot;. The idea of an anti-monopoly board game dates to 1903 when Lizzie Magie created &quot;The Landlord&#x27;s Game&quot;, which later inspired &quot;Monopoly&quot;.

== Background and history ==
Anspach created &quot;Anti-Monopoly&quot; in part as a response to the lessons taught by the mainstream game, which he believed created the impression that monopolies were something desirable. His intent was to demonstrate how harmful monopolies could be to a free-enterprise system, and how antitrust laws work to curtail them in the real world.

The game was originally to be produced in 1973 as &quot;Bust the Trust&quot;, but the title was changed to &quot;Anti-Monopoly&quot;. It has seen multiple printings and revisions since 1973. In 1984, a new version appeared as &quot;Anti-Monopoly II&quot;; this version was updated and re-released in 2005 without the numerical designation. The game is currently still in print, and is produced and distributed worldwide by University Games.

==Gameplay==
The original &quot;Anti-Monopoly&quot; game begins with the board in a monopolised state, similar to the result of a completed &quot;Monopoly&quot; game. Instead of real estate and public utilities, properties in &quot;Anti-Monopoly&quot; are individual businesses that have been brought under single ownership. These monopolies are called &quot;company cartels&quot; and are split into three categories: Oligopolies, Trusts, and Monopolies; each of these requires a different amount of resources to topple. Players take the role of federal case workers bringing indictments against each monopolised business in an attempt to make the board resemble a free market system.

In &quot;Anti-Monopoly II&quot;, players do not all play by the same rules; at the beginning of every game, each person decides whether to play as a monopolist or as a competitor (&quot;competitor&quot; in this case meaning &quot;aiming to win by legitimate competition rather than by monopoly&quot;). This version plays more like the actual &quot;Monopoly&quot; game in that all the players buy and sell real estate, rather than working to indict monopolists as in the first version of &quot;Anti-Monopoly&quot;. Some of the rule differences between playing as a monopolist and as a competitor are that competitors charge lower rents and can improve any property they own at any time, while monopolists must own at least two properties in a group (thus beginning to establish a monopoly) before they can build on them, and charge much higher rents.

==Trademark lawsuit==

In 1974, Parker Brothers sued Anspach over the use of the &quot;Monopoly&quot; name, claiming trademark infringement. While preparing his legal defense, Anspach became aware of &quot;Monopoly&quot;″s history prior to Charles Darrow&#x27;s sale of the game to Parker in 1935, and how it had evolved from Elizabeth Magie&#x27;s original &quot;Landlord&#x27;s Game&quot; into the version Darrow appropriated. Anspach based his defense on the grounds that the game itself existed in effectively the public domain before Parker purchased it, and therefore Parker&#x27;s trademark claim on it should be nullified. The case dragged on for ten years, with numerous appeals and overturned judicial verdicts, until Anspach and Parker ultimately reached a settlement, permitting him to continue using the name &quot;Anti-Monopoly&quot; and distributing the game.

For a time during the dispute, the game was marketed as simply &quot;Anti.&quot;

==Related games==
* &quot;Syndrome&quot;, a similar game in that it inverts the objective of &quot;Monopoly&quot;, and in which players aim to give away money and property rather than acquire them, was described by science fiction author Philip K. Dick in his short story &quot;War Game&quot;. Selchow and Righter published the game as &quot;Go for Broke&quot; in 1965.
* &quot;Class Struggle&quot;, a board game based on Marxism, created by Bertell Ollman
* In Germany, where the original game was and still is very popular, two more games that contrast with &quot;Monopoly&quot; were created and popular in the 1970s and 1980s: &quot;Provopoli — Wem gehört die Stadt?&quot; (&quot;Provopoly — To whom does the city belong?&quot;, &quot;Provo&quot; having been a nickname for some countercultural groups in the 1960s), with one team trying to maintain the current political order and the other team trying to change it; and &quot;Ökopoli&quot; (&quot;Ecopoly&quot;), where the objective is to take over the town from polluters.

<text>The Norm Smith Medal is an Australian rules football award presented annually to the player adjudged the best on ground in the Grand Final of the Australian Football League (AFL). Prior to 1990, the competition was known as the Victorian Football League (VFL). It was first presented in the 1979 VFL Grand Final, and it was won by Wayne Harmes, playing in Carlton&#x27;s premiership victory against Collingwood. The award is named in honour of Norm Smith, who won four VFL premierships as a player and six as coach for the Melbourne Football Club.

Dustin Martin (2017, 2019 and 2020) is the only player to win the award three times. The award is usually won by a player on the winning team in the Grand Final; only four players have received the award as members of the losing teams: Maurice Rioli in 1982, Gary Ablett Sr. in 1989, Nathan Buckley in 2002, and Chris Judd in 2005. The club with the most Norm Smith Medal wins is Hawthorn, with eight awards won by players representing the club. The most recent recipient of the award is Brisbane&#x27;s Will Ashcroft.

== Voting and presentation ==
The winner is voted on by a five-member panel consisting of former players, journalists and media personalities, with one member designated as the chair. Each panellist independently awards three votes, two votes and one vote to the players they regard as the best, second best and third best in the match, respectively. These are tallied and the highest number of combined votes wins the medal.

There is no chance of a tie for the medal; if two players are tied for votes, the following countbacks will apply in order:
*the player with the higher number of three-votes;
*the player with the higher number of two-votes;
*the player deemed best by the panel chair.

Paul Chapman is the only player to win on a countback, after he and Jason Gram tied with nine votes apiece in 2009.

In some years judges were required to lodge their decisions prior to the completion of the match, to ensure votes were compiled in time for the ceremony. This was changed following the 2002 AFL Grand Final, after Michael Voss had five crucial possessions in the last five minutes of the close game which could have swayed the voting, but eventually placed fourth behind Nathan Buckley. After the match, three of the five judges suggested they would have voted differently if they had lodged their votes after the final siren.

Prior to the 2016 season, if the grand final resulted in a draw, the game would be replayed the following week. In such instances, a separate Norm Smith Medal was awarded in each game. Since 2016, a drawn grand final would result in the use of extra time to determine the winner, rather than a full-match replay.

The medal is presented in a post-match ceremony held immediately after the conclusion of the match. Since 2004, former Norm Smith medallists have presented the award, in the order of the year in which they won; as of 2024, Gary Ablett Sr. is the only former winner to decline presenting the award; and Nathan Buckley&#x27;s position in the sequence was skipped in 2019, as he was coaching Collingwood, who were yet to be eliminated when the decision on presenter had to be made.

<doc id="463123" wikidata="Q750657" url="?curid=463123" title="Quicken Interchange Format">
<text>Quicken Interchange Format (QIF) is an open specification for reading and writing financial data to media (i.e. files).

==Background==
Although still widely used, QIF is a format older than Open Financial Exchange (OFX). The inability to reconcile imported transactions against the current account information is one of the primary shortcomings of QIF. Most personal money management software, such as Microsoft Money, GnuCash and Quicken&#x27;s low end products (e.g. Quicken Personal and Quicken Personal Plus), can read QIF files to import information. Intuit&#x27;s Quicken used to be able to import QIF, too, but with its 2006 version it dropped that support for several important account types, including checking, savings, and credit card accounts. The Australian version of Quicken still allows the importing of QIF files for these account types. However, unlike the American version, it is not possible to export data to QIF or any other file type for any account type. The QIF format does not allow a user to mark the currency in which a transaction was completed. In some cases this may cause problems for users who do use multiple currencies when they export or import into another software package.

Quicken&#x27;s proposed replacement for the QIF format has been the proprietary Quicken Web Connect (QFX) format.
It is commonly supported by financial institutions to supply downloadable information to account holders, especially by banks that support integration of Money or Quicken with their online banking. Not everybody, however, was, or is, happy with this replacement. Some banks dislike it because Quicken (Intuit) charges licensing fees to use QFX. Other banks pass the fees on by charging customers for downloading QFX files. Because Microsoft Money imports either QIF or OFX format files, and Microsoft does not charge banks any licensing fees to use OFX for Money, banks do not normally charge for downloading QIF and OFX files. (QIF and OFX are open formats, free for anyone to use.)

==Data format==
A QIF file typically has the following structure:

Each record ends with a codice_1 (caret). All the data in the file is stored in ASCII strings, and the file could be edited in any text editor.

;simple example
 !Type:Bank
 D03/03/10
 T-379.00
 PCITY OF SPRINGFIELD
 D03/04/10
 T-20.28
 PYOUR LOCAL SUPERMARKET
 D03/03/10
 T-421.35
 PSPRINGFIELD WATER UTILITY
 ...etc.

===Header line===
The first line in the file must be a header line, to identify the type of data contained. Valid values for accounts are:

There are also values for QIF files of internal Quicken information:
A header line is not followed by a separator line; it is immediately followed by the first field of a detail item.

===Detail items===
The Detail section consists of several Detail Items, each on a separate line. Each line begins with a single character identifying code in the first column, followed by the literal data for that field. The detail item is terminated by a separator line. The fields can be in any order (except that within split transactions, the category, amount, and memo must be adjacent). If a single transaction block contains several detail items with same code, the last row is used for import.

Standard detail item

Investment Actions

Notes
* The S, E, $, and % fields are repeated for each split of this transaction.
* For investment action codes that end in X, the Category field indicates the other account used to transfer cash from or to.
* If the line immediately following an XS record does not begin with ^ or X, that is considered a continuation of the XS record.

All the fields in detail items are optional—if not included, that field will be left blank in the imported transaction. Also, Quicken seems to do little error checking on these items; if the same field is included twice in the detail item, the second one will just overwrite the first one.

===Record end===
The separator line signals the end of the current transaction. The last detail item in the file should end with a separator line.

==Export workarounds for QuickBooks: exporting to QIF==
QuickBooks doesn&#x27;t allow exporting to QIF. Only the Intuit Interchange Format (IIF) is supported. An IIF to QIF converter will not solve the problem either, as journal entries can&#x27;t be exported in IIF format, only lists are exportable. A viable way to overcome this problem is to set up a journal report, to show all journal entries. Print the report using the &quot;print to file&quot; option. Set the file type to Excel before printing. Rename the extension of the resulting file from PRN to CSV. Use this XL2QIF Excel macro to convert to QIF. The Excel file may need to be reorganized to generate the appropriate format for the macro to work, such as separating cheque accounts from term deposits, etc. The above referenced Excel macro supports split transactions.

See references for further examples of reporting to excel 

==Import workarounds for Quicken 2005+: importing from QIF==
While Intuit officially only supports QIF importing on asset, liability, cash, small business payable, and invoice accounts, Quicken will still allow you to import transactions using QIF into any account type. Two methods are explained below:

===Indirect (Temporary cash account) method===
Note: If you really need to get data from a QIF file into an account that does not support QIF imports (e.g. Quicken 2005 and later), you can import from the QIF file into a (temporary) Cash account. Make sure the first line in the QIF file says &quot;!Type:Cash&quot; for importing it into a Quicken Cash account. (QIF files can be edited in any text editor.) After importing the transactions, you can copy/paste them into a register of your choice. Tested in 2006 version. Note that you cannot copy cash transactions into brokerage accounts in Quicken 2007.

===Direct method===
To import transactions into brokerage accounts (or any account), a little text editing is necessary. Ensure to prefix your transaction data by copying-and-pasting the top four lines from the example below - the example is for an investment transaction:

codice_2

Line 2 (N) in the example must contain the exact name of the account you are intending to import into. If you use an account name that does not exist, Quicken will ask if you want to create a new account (This functionality has been test in Quicken 2012). When importing the file, the account you choose in the QIF-import-dialog box is irrelevant (you can even choose &quot;all accounts&quot;) - once you begin the import process, the application will prompt to confirm importing to the intended account. In order to be successfully read by Quicken the text file must be saved in ANSI format. Files saved in UTF-8 format will not be correctly processed.

The example above was tested in Quicken 2007, Quicken 2008, Quicken 2010, Quicken 2012, Quicken 2015 and an equivalently formatted text file using &quot;TCCard&quot; instead of &quot;TInvst&quot; under Quicken 2011.

If the transactions are being imported into an existing account, make sure to reconcile the account in the old data file before creating the QIF export file. Before accepting an import, validate any &#x27;Match&#x27; transactions and change to &#x27;New&#x27; where there isn&#x27;t really a match. Quicken can match on amounts even when the dates are significantly different.

When editing the QIF file, check for any transaction Category (the field starting with &#x27;L&#x27;) for an account name contained in brackets, such as [Checking Account]. The brackets reference another quicken account, and if left in place will post a transaction in that account in addition to the account being imported to, with potentially troublesome results. Avoid this by removing the text including the brackets and replacing with another category if desired. The only exception to this is an opening balance transaction, identified by &#x27;Opening Balance&#x27; in the &#x27;P&#x27; field (POpening Balance). In this case, the brackets need to be left in place, and the account name between the brackets must exactly match the account name in the &#x27;N&#x27; field.

The above two paragraphs are based on exporting and importing in Quicken 2010.

==Sample Account Export==
An account with the following five transactions shown in the screenshot below was exported to a qif file. The content of that file is shown immediately beneath with commentary to the right of the transactions to better pair them against the table generated from an Account Transactions report of the sample account.

<doc id="463125" wikidata="Q287031" url="?curid=463125" title="Respect Party">
<text>The Respect Party was a left-wing to far-left socialist political party active in the United Kingdom between 2004 and 2016. At the height of its success in 2007, the party had one Member of Parliament (MP) in the House of Commons and nineteen councillors in local government.

The Respect Party was established in London by Salma Yaqoob and George Monbiot. Arising in the aftermath of the 2003 invasion of Iraq, it grew out of the Stop the War Coalition and from the start revolved largely around opposition to the United Kingdom&#x27;s role in the Iraq War. Uniting a range of leftist and anti-war groups, it was unofficially allied to the Muslim Association of Britain (MAB) and the Socialist Workers Party (SWP), a far-left, Marxist group. In 2005, Respect&#x27;s candidate George Galloway was elected MP for Bethnal Green and Bow and the party came second in three other constituencies. Respect made further gains in the 2006 and 2007 local elections, at which point its support peaked. In 2007, a schism emerged in the party between SWP supporters and the Respect Renewal group led by Galloway and Yaqoob; the former group left the party to form the Left List. Over the coming years, Respect gradually lost its council seats and it deregistered with the Electoral Commission in 2016.

Avowedly socialist and opposed to capitalism, Respect called for the nationalisation of much of the UK economy, increased funding to public services, and further measures to tackle poverty and discrimination. It was Eurosceptic and promoted an anti-imperialist worldview. It was also anti-Zionist, opposing the existence of Israel and endorsing the Palestine Solidarity Campaign. Due to its links with MAB, several commentators claimed that Islamism was a component of its ideology and regarded it as part of a wider alliance between socialists and Islamists within Western Europe. Respect&#x27;s voting base was primarily among the British Muslim communities in East London, Birmingham and Bradford, where it built upon opposition to the Iraq War and disenchantment among leftist voters with the governing Labour Party.

==Ideology==
The political scientists Matthew Goodwin and Robert Ford characterised Respect as a &quot;broad coalition of left-wing interests&quot; which had arisen in opposition to the New Labour government and the UK&#x27;s involvement in the invasion of Iraq. Other political scientists characterised the party as far-left. The socialist activist Tariq Ali characterised the party&#x27;s programme as being social democratic in orientation. Eran Benedek described the party as &quot;an amalgamation of radical international socialism and Islamism&quot;, adding that its radical socialist position was informed by Marxism–Leninism and Trotskyism. 

Benedek characterised it as a manifestation of what Amir Taheri called the &quot;Marxist-Islamist coalition&quot;, which united around opposition to the United States, a desire to destroy the state of Israel, and a wish to overthrow international capitalism. Similarly, Emmanuel Karagiannis characterised the party as &quot;the epitome&quot; of the &quot;convergence&quot; between radical left and Islamist groups in Western Europe, and Nick Cohen described it as an &quot;alliance... between the Trotskyist far left and the Islamic far right&quot;.

===Socialism and anti-capitalism===
The party&#x27;s policies have been described as &quot;traditionally leftist and anti-capitalist&quot;.
Respect encouraged the nationalisation of many sectors of the economy, including the railways, water, gas, electricity, and the North Sea oil industry. It urged a substantial increase in corporation tax in order to increase funding to public services. It sought to overturn what it described as &quot;anti-trade union&quot; legislation, and to introduce policies to deal with issues of poverty and discrimination. Respect promoted revolutionary socialism and international socialism. The party was largely hostile to Western capitalism and neoliberalism, and interpreted many world events through the prism of anti-imperialism, calling for an end to what it characterised as imperialist wars like that in Iraq. Respect was anti-globalization, believing that it resulted in the exploitation of the working class. It also expressed a Eurosceptic approach to the European Union, deeming the Union to be lacking in democracy and exploitative toward the working class.

===Anti-Zionism===
Respect was anti-Zionist and, according to Benedek, rejected &quot;the right to independent Jewish statehood in Israel&quot;. It presented this position through the terminology of social justice and human rights. One of its core principles was stated support for the Palestinian people and opposition to what Respect described as &quot;the apartheid system that oppresses them&quot;. It was constitutionally committed to supporting the Palestine Solidarity Campaign and the boycotting of Israel. It calls for Israel to withdraw from any land conquered in 1967, and for the right of return to be granted to all Palestinians forced to move on the formation of the state of Israel in 1948. On its website and published fliers, it included maps of the Levant in which the entirety of Israel was labelled &quot;Occupied Palestine&quot;. In 2017, the party&#x27;s website asserts: &quot;Respect supports the idea of a democratic bi-national solution of one state from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea in which all people, Jews, Muslims and Christians live equally; one man, one woman, one vote&quot; and says British foreign policy should recognise Britain&#x27;s &quot;partial responsibility for the problem by their participation in the creation of the state of Israel&quot;.

According to the party&#x27;s national council member Yvonne Ridley, speaking at London&#x27;s Imperial College in February 2006, Respect &quot;is a Zionist-free party... if there was any Zionism in the Respect Party they would be hunted down and kicked out.&quot; 

The rejection of Israel&#x27;s right to exist and the characterisation of it as a garrison of American imperialism in the Middle East had been espoused by the SWP even prior to the establishment of Respect.

In February 2013, George Galloway walked out of a debate organised by Christ Church, Oxford because his opponent was Eylon Levy, an Israeli citizen. He explained his actions thus: &quot;The reason is simple: no recognition, no normalisation. Just boycott, divestment and sanctions, until the apartheid state is defeated. I never debate with Israelis nor speak to their media. If they want to speak about Palestine – the address is the PLO.&quot; The Zionist Federation called it a &quot;racist&quot; walkout displaying &quot;xenophobic&quot; tendencies.

Respect was supportive of anti-Zionist Islamist militant groups like Hezbollah and Hamas. In July 2006, Respect official Lindsey German stated that &quot;whatever disagreements I have with Hamas and Hezbollah, I would rather be in their camp... they want democracy. Democracy in the Middle East &quot;is&quot; Hamas, &quot;is&quot; Hezbollah&quot;. Galloway met with Hamas leader Khaled Mashal In September 2006, and that November the party&#x27;s national-secretary John Rees attended the Beirut International Conference organised by Hezbollah.

==History==

===Formation: 2004===

Respect emerged from the British anti-war movement which had developed from late 2001 onward. The Stop the War Coalition (StWC) had been established in September 2001, with a central role being played by the Socialist Workers Party (SWP), which was then the largest radical left group in the UK. The StWC&#x27;s president was Tony Benn, a Labour Member of Parliament (MP) until 2001, while it also gained the support of several rebel Labour MPs, among them Katy Clark, Jeremy Corbyn, Tam Dalyell, Alice Mahon, and George Galloway. The StWC had also attracted significant support from within Britain&#x27;s Muslim community, and the Muslim Association of Britain (MAB) officially affiliated itself with the coalition. The movement politicised a large number of young British Muslims, among them Salma Yaqoob, who became the head of the StWC branch in Birmingham.

Galloway later revealed that, about a year before the UK and US launched the Iraq War, he had broached the subject of leaving Labour and establishing a new party with his friends Seumas Milne and Andrew Murray. At the time—he later stated—he was of the view that UK Prime Minister Tony Blair and US President George W. Bush had already committed themselves to invading Iraq. Galloway was vocal in his opposition to Blair&#x27;s calls for an invasion, and in May 2003 he was suspended from the Labour Party and then expelled in October, having been found to have brought it into disrepute. He then announced that he would stand against Labour in the 2004 European Parliament elections, and that he would &quot;seek to unify the red, green, anti-war, Muslim and other social constituencies radicalised by the war, in a referendum on Tony Blair&quot;.

The two main instigators of the party were Yaqoob and George Monbiot, a journalist with &quot;The Guardian&quot;. They had been part of a discussion surrounding the unification of a broad range of anti-war forces that were to the left of Labour, a successor to the Socialist Alliance electoral list that had contested the 2001 general election. They wanted to reach out beyond the far left&#x27;s traditional support base and gain support from peace activists and religious groups, particularly the Muslim community. In November 2003, a number of public meetings were held under the title of &quot;British Politics at the Crossroads&quot;, at which it was agreed that a new political party should be established. At a convention on 24 January 2004, the party, titled &quot;Respect – the Unity Coalition&quot;, was officially declared. The name &quot;RESPECT&quot; was a contrived acronym for respect, equality, socialism, peace, environmentalism, community, and trade unionism. Galloway said in April 2004: &quot;Respect. It&#x27;s a young word. It&#x27;s a black word. It&#x27;s the first postmodern name for an electoral political movement; most are one or other arrangement of the words The, Something, and Party. With respect, we&#x27;re different.&quot; Opposition to the Iraq War was the party&#x27;s primary issue, around which it galvanised much of its support.

At its foundation, the party also called for a halt to privatisation and the renationalisation of the British railways. Although it did not secure the full backing of any major trade unions, some local branches of the National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers (RMT)—which had disaffiliated from Labour in February 2004—voted to support Respect. Although containing members from both the SWP and MAB, Respect was not a formal coalition between the two groups. From the beginnings of Respect, there remained tension within the party between SWP members and Muslim leaders. This alliance was also criticised by some observers; in June 2004, the political commentator Nick Cohen wrote that &quot;for the first time since the Enlightenment, a section of the left is allied with religious fanaticism and, for the first time since the Hitler-Stalin pact, a section of the left has gone soft on fascism.&quot;

Respect initially tried to form an electoral pact with the Green Party of England and Wales but this proved unsuccessful. The Greens stated that they had selected their candidates for the 2004 European Parliamentary elections by postal ballot months previously and that they were also sceptical of the SWP&#x27;s influence over Respect. After Respect decided to stand candidates against the Greens, Monbiot stepped down from the party in February 2004, claiming that to compete against the Greens might threaten the positions of &quot;two of the best elected representatives in Britain&quot;, the Green Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) Caroline Lucas and Jean Lambert.

===Early electoral campaigns: 2004–05===

Respect fielded candidates for both the 2004 elections for the European Parliament (EP) and for the London Assembly, attempting to present these elections as a referendum on Blair&#x27;s Labour government. The party claims that this support was achieved primarily as a result of the anti-war protests and by attracting votes from &quot;disillusioned&quot; Labour voters. The party was widely derided in the British media, which viewed Respect as a single-issue party that would soon disappear from British politics.

Respect polled a quarter of a million votes in the EP election. Its proportion of the national vote was 1.7%, which grew to 5% in London, although it failed to win any seats. The strong showing of the Greens and the UK Independence Party had been part of the reason for this failure to secure a seat. In the London Assembly election, Respect secured 4.5% of the vote, meaning that they did not secure a seat on the Assembly. However, within both the London Borough of Newham and the London Borough of Tower Hamlets—both areas with large Muslim populations—Respect secured the largest number of votes, with over 20% in both. Respect mocked Ken Livingstone&#x27;s Labour candidacy as the &quot;Blair Mayor Project&quot;.

Respect&#x27;s first election victory was in the council by-election for the St Dunstan&#x27;s and Stepney Green ward of Tower Hamlets, where its candidate, Oliur Rahman, secured 31% of the vote. At the Birmingham Hodge Hill and Leicester South by-elections, both held on 15 July 2004, the party gained 6.3% and 12.7% of the vote respectively. At the time, following defections from other parties, Respect had a council seat in Nuneaton and another in Preston.
The coalition put up candidates in 26 constituencies across England and Wales, just under half of them from the SWP. However, Britain&#x27;s first past the post electoral system made it difficult for small parties to make gains unless they geographically concentrated their vote. Respect recognised that East London, an area with large numbers of Muslim British Bangladeshis, would be electorally lucrative, particularly as three of the area&#x27;s four sitting Labour MPs had voted in favour of British participation in the invasion of Iraq. At the 2005 general election Respect fielded candidates in this area: Lindsey German in West Ham, Abdul Khaliq Mian in East Ham, Rahman in Poplar and Canning Town, and Galloway in Bethnal Green and Bow.

Galloway sought to unseat the sitting Labour MP, Oona King, and the ensuing campaign for the seat has been cited as &quot;one of the most acrimonious in recent history&quot;. King accused Galloway of sexual impropriety, although was later forced to retract those allegations. She alleged that she had been the victim of antisemitism from Respect supporters after having been pelted with eggs at a Jewish memorial service. She also claimed that Respect canvassers had urged Muslims not to vote for her because she is Jewish. Respect threatened legal action if King repeated the claim; John Rees, national secretary of Respect, said &quot;George Galloway and everyone in Respect has a long record of fighting anti-semitism - longer I suspect than Oona King. This kind of rubbish is libellous. Oona King should be more cognisant of the dangers, having already paid out two sets of libel writs to George.&quot;

Respect won 0.3% of the national vote, with an average of 6.8% of the vote in the constituencies it had contested; 17 of its candidates failed to have their deposits returned. However, Galloway won the seat of Bethnal Green and Bow by a narrow margin of 823 votes. Galloway&#x27;s surprise victory provided much momentum for his party. His victory represented the first time that a party to the left of Labour had won a seat in the Houses of Parliament since 1951. Respect also did well in several other constituencies, coming second to Labour in both West Ham and East Ham, and also securing second place in Birmingham Sparkbrook and Small Heath, where Yaqoob had been its candidate, securing 27.5% of the vote.
Respect made &quot;rapid progress&quot;, aided by growing finances and the existing campaign experience of the far left. By the end of 2005, in the London Borough of Newham, two Labour and one Liberal Democrat councillor had defected to Respect. By December 2005, it had an official membership of 5,674. Galloway, however, told Decca Aitkenhead in April 2012 for a &quot;Guardian&quot; profile that Respect, at its peak, only had about 3–4,000 members. Its university wing, Student Respect, claimed by 2007 to have branches in over fifty campuses across England and Wales. Benedek suggested that this probably made it the fastest-growing student political group in the UK. The SWP&#x27;s student group, the Socialist Worker Student Society (SWSS), encouraged its members to join Respect and became largely dormant.

===Local electoral victories: 2006–07===

In 2006, Galloway appeared on Channel 4&#x27;s reality television show &quot;Celebrity Big Brother&quot;. His hope was to use it as a public relations exercise in which he could promote his views to a wider audience, however this backfired as Channel 4 producers censored most of his political discussions. Media attention instead focused on the fact that he had seemingly abandoned his constituents to appear in the show and on an episode in which he had impersonated a cat. This did little to damage Respect&#x27;s electoral appeal.

Respect stood about 150 candidates in the 2006 local elections, at which it secured 16 seats. At Respect&#x27;s campaign launch, Galloway anticipated a &quot;referendum on new Labour&quot;, and said the election &quot;will be the last blow that will knock out Tony Blair&quot;. In Tower Hamlets, Respect took eleven new council seats, giving it a total of twelve and making it the borough&#x27;s official opposition to Labour. In Newham, Respect gained 26% of the vote and returned its three councillors, although was disappointed not to gain further ones. In Birmingham, Respect gained 55% of the vote in the Sparkbrook ward, and Yaqoob was elected as the city&#x27;s first female Muslim councillor. None of the new Respect councillors were connected with the SWP. Galloway explained at the time that many Respect supporters &quot;are small business people and wouldn&#x27;t describe themselves as socialists and are not bound to accept it.&quot;

Respect stood 48 candidates in the 2007 local election, of which three were elected. The party had peaked, and following this would witness a decline. In July 2007, Galloway was suspended from the House of Commons for 18 days after the standards and privileges commit accused him of a lack of transparency in the financing of is charity, the Mariam Appeal. In August, a Respect councillor in Tower Hamlets resigned, triggering a by-election which Harun Miah narrowly secured for Respect.

===Schism: 2007===
The SWP had been members of Respect&#x27;s &quot;Unity Coalition&quot; since its early years, although relations between them and Galloway had been strained. In August 2007 he wrote a letter to the party&#x27;s national council stating that Respect had various internal weaknesses, with many deeming this a veiled criticism of the SWP. This generated rifts within the SWP itself as two of its members were expelled for refusing to step down as Galloway&#x27;s parliamentary assistants. By October, SWP publications were claiming that there was a &quot;witch hunt&quot; against socialists within Respect, despite the presence of socialist groups other than the SWP. That month, disagreements between Rahman and Abjol Miah, leader of the Respect group in Tower Hamlets, resulted in four of the borough&#x27;s councillors resigning the Respect Party whip.

By November 2007, Respect had split into two rival factions. The first consisted largely of members affiliated with the SWP and included the rebel councillors from Tower Hamlets. The second, which named itself Respect Renewal, was led by Galloway and Yaqoob and had the support of virtually all of the party&#x27;s elected representatives and national council. According to political scientist Timothy Peace, these events were &quot;characteristic of the faction fighting that has always plagued the radical left.&quot; The SWP-allied faction controlled the party&#x27;s website and claimed that Galloway had simply left the party, of which they were the rightful representatives. The Respect Renewal group changed the locks of the party&#x27;s national office and barred access to SWP supporters. On 17 November, both groups held conferences at which they claimed to be the legitimate manifestation of Respect. The Electoral Commission subsequently ruled that control of the party&#x27;s name rested with Fire Brigades Union activist Linda Smith, the nominating officer; she had sided with Galloway, meaning that the Respect Renewal group were able to continue using the name. The SWP faction split and began using the name Left List.

The SWP attributed the split to a shift to the right by Galloway and his allies, motivated by electoralism (seeking to gain Muslim votes) and attacks on the left. This opinion was shared by Hilary Wainwright, who saw a common pattern of &quot;leaderism&quot; in this and other leftist debacles, although she thought Galloway possessed positive qualities. SWP-dominated branches of Respect were reportedly less active than those with far fewer members of that group. A narrow failure of John Rees in 2006 to gain election in the Tower Hamlets local elections, while the 12 candidates from the Bangladeshi community were all elected, was also alleged to have alienated the SWP from the project.

In December 2009, the party de-registered (removed) itself from the Register of Political Parties for Northern Ireland, but remained registered for England, Scotland and Wales.

===Decline: 2008–2011===
Respect went into gradual decline after 2008. By this point its primary unifying issue, anger at Labour over the Iraq War, had become less salient, with the political scientist Stephen Driver suggesting that for this reason Respect &quot;struggled to be anything more than a one-trick pony&quot;. The party was in disarray following the schism and only forwarded one candidate for the 2008 London Assembly elections. This candidate, Hanif Abdulmuhit, stood for the City and East constituency and secured 15% of the vote but trailed behind their Labour and Conservative Party rivals. Overall Respect attained 2.4% of the London Assembly vote, below the 5% threshold needed to secure a seat. Galloway had headed the Respect (London-wide) top-up list. Respect had not fielded a candidate for London Mayor, instead endorsing Labour&#x27;s Ken Livingstone, while Left List had fielded German, who secured significantly fewer votes than she had gained as a Respect candidate for Mayor in 2004. The outbreak of the 2008 Gaza War provided renewed impetus for Respect&#x27;s campaigning. Throughout much of 2009, the party devoted much of its resources to raising funds for the Viva Palestina aid convoy to alleviate the humanitarian crisis in the Gaza Strip. The first convoy, which set off from Glasgow in February 2009, was led by Respect member Kevin Ovenden.

Respect Renewal stood 10 candidates in the local council elections also taking place on 1 May across England and Wales. They returned one new councillor, Nahim Khan, in Birmingham Sparkbrook, who received 42.64% of the vote. 
The party did not field any candidates for the 2009 European Parliament elections, instead urging supporters to vote for either the Green Party or the left-wing Eurosceptic alliance, No2EU. Instead, Arthur Scargill&#x27;s Socialist Labour Party proved to be the most successful radical left party in the election, securing 1.1% of the national vote.

Respect fielded ten candidates in the 2010 general election, with a particular focus on three that they considered winnable. The party&#x27;s manifesto highlighted that a hung parliament would be likely, and that if there were three Respect MPs in the House of Commons then they would have a chance of forming a coalition with a minority government. Their three targeted seats were Birmingham Hall Green, which was being contested by Yaqoob—who was then party leader—Poplar and Limehouse, which was contested by Galloway, and Galloway&#x27;s existing seat of Bethnal Green and Bow, which was being defended by Miah. The election however proved disastrous for Respect. Labour secured all three of the seats that Respect had targeted, with Galloway and Miah being pushed into third place with 17% of the vote. Nationwide it had secured 33,251 votes, less than half of that which it had attained in the 2005 general election. Local elections were held on the same day which also resulted in significant losses for Respect; in Tower Hamlets it went from having eight councillors to one, and in Newham it lost all its councillors.

However the party had better results elsewhere. In Birmingham Hall Green constituency Respect candidate Salma Yaqoob performed better, receiving 12,240 votes, 25.1%, placing second after Labour candidate Roger Godsiff, who received 16,039 votes, 32.9%.

Respect fielded eight more candidates in other constituencies, who together polled 4,319 votes. Arshad Ali received 1,245 votes, 3.1%, in Bradford West, and Kay Phillips received 996 votes, 2.9%, in Blackley and Broughton. In total, Respect candidates received 33,269 votes, which amounted to 6.8% of the total vote in the constituencies where they stood and 0.1% of the total UK vote.

During the 2010 General Election the Green Party stood down in favour of Respect candidates in Birmingham Sparkbrook and Blackley and Broughton. While Respect agreed not to stand against the Trade Unionist and Socialist Coalition candidate in Salford and Eccles or to oppose the Greens standing in Manchester Central, indicating the beginning of a tentative co-operation between the three parties locally . Galloway told Decca Aitkenhead in April 2012: &quot;When we lost the three parliamentary seats in 2010 that we&#x27;d hoped to win, we became almost minuscule&quot;; Respect he said then had about 8-900 members.

Abjol Miah was elected as the National Chair of Respect in January 2011. After the introduction of a directly elected mayor of Tower Hamlets—something that Respect had campaigned for locally—the party backed the successful independent candidate Lutfur Rahman.

On 5 May 2011, in the 2011 Scottish Parliament election, the Respect Party, on whose list Galloway stood in the Glasgow electoral region, received 6,972 votes (3.3%). He campaigned under the banner of Coalition Against the Cuts, but the vote was insufficient to become a Member of the Scottish Parliament in the proportional voting system used. In the Birmingham City Council election of 2011, Respect lost one of its three councillors to Labour. In July, Yaqoob then resigned for health reasons, leaving the party with only one councillor in the city.

===2012: Galloway wins Bradford West by-election===
Galloway successfully contested Bradford West in a by-election held on 29 March 2012, following the resignation of Labour MP Marsha Singh due to ill health.

Galloway and his supporters, such as the Muslim Public Affairs Committee (MPACUK), were active in a campaign against Imran Hussain, the Muslim deputy leader of Bradford City Council, whose commitment to his faith was queried because he is reported to drink alcohol. Meanwhile, one of Galloway&#x27;s supporting speakers at a rally on the Sunday before the byelection was Abjol Miah, once group leader of the Respect councillors in Tower Hamlets, who is also active in the IFE.

Galloway was elected with a majority of 10,140 with one of the largest swings in the polls against the defending political party in modern political history.

===2012: party resignations===
Yaqoob resigned as party leader in September, following Galloway&#x27;s remarks about rape with respect to the Julian Assange case. She told a reporter from &quot;The Guardian&quot; that she had had to make a choice between &quot;standing up for the rights of women&quot; and her admiration for Galloway&#x27;s &quot;anti-imperialist stance&quot;. In October 2012, party secretary Chris Chilvers said Respect had 2,000 members, while before the by-election it had 300. Arshad Ali, who succeeded Yaqoob as leader, resigned as national chair in December 2012 after it was discovered that he has a spent conviction for electoral fraud (dating from his time in the Labour Party), although at this point the Electoral Commission still had Yaqoob listed as the party&#x27;s leader.

Kate Hudson had originally been selected for the Manchester Central by-election, but stood down in early September following Galloway&#x27;s comments on rape, and left the party in October. In the same month, Respect announced that Catherine Higgins, a local &quot;community advocate&quot;, would contest the by-election on 15 November 2012. Higgins finished ninth out of 12 candidates.

In November 2012, at a rally in Rotherham, Respect announced that Yvonne Ridley had been chosen to contend the Rotherham by-election. The election took place on 29 November 2012; Ridley finished fourth with 8% of the vote, ahead of both the Conservative and Liberal Democrat candidates, but behind UKIP and the BNP.

===2012–15: Respect&#x27;s Bradford councillors===
Respect won five seats on Bradford Council in May 2012 following Galloway&#x27;s success in the by-election at the end of March. Amid a fiercely fought campaign, there were claims and complaints of violence and harassment by the Respect Party and its opponents. The party came second in Oldham&#x27;s Werneth ward and Tower Hamlets&#x27; Weavers ward.

After several months of inconclusive reports in the media, on 10 August 2013, the Bradford &quot;Telegraph &amp; Argus&quot; reported that Galloway might not be a candidate in Bradford at the 2015 general election and instead stand in the 2016 London Mayoral election. The five Respect councillors in Bradford elected the previous year resigned from the party whip on 15 August 2013 after coming into conflict with Galloway over his comments that he might run in the London mayoral election. They argued that the MP was needed in Bradford. Two of the councillors had said the MP should resign if he intended to stand in London; Galloway and his associates had immediately suspended them, although their three fellow council members were in agreement. One of the other three councillors, Alyas Karmani, then leader of the Respect group on Bradford City Council, said the party had not, in fact, been consulted about Galloway&#x27;s plans.

Galloway had also claimed that the councillors were working against him and the party with Aisha Ali Khan, his former aide, and her husband. (Both Ali Khan and her husband later received criminal convictions related to her former employment by Galloway.) After no retraction of the assertions made against them had been forthcoming, the five councillors entirely severed their connections with Respect towards the end of October and then intended to sit as independents for the remainder of their term of office. Claims that they had been &quot;conniving&quot; with Galloway&#x27;s former aide were false, they said. A spokesman from Respect accused them of attempting to gain control of the party in Bradford.

In the 2014 local elections, Respect stood eight candidates in Bradford, but none of them won in their council wards. Two other Respect councillors lost their seats, leaving Respect without any representation on local authorities. In 2014, the party had only 630 members and assets of £1,947. By that point, the party was largely a vehicle for Galloway&#x27;s personality.

This changed in March 2015 when four of the former Respect councillors rejoined and a Labour member of the council, Asama Javed, left the party and aligned herself with Respect. The remaining councillor of the five who resigned in August 2013, Mohammad Shabbir, announced he was joining the Labour group on the council in mid-April 2015 with immediate effect rather than rejoining Respect with his former colleagues. In July 2015, the four councillors who had rejoined reversed their decision and decided to continue under the Bradford Independent Group label, although rejoining Respect was still a possibility.

===2015–16: general election and de-registration===
At the 2015 general election, Respect had four candidates, in Halifax and two Birmingham seats (Hall Green and Yardley) in addition to Bradford West. Where Respect was not standing in the election, Galloway had urged a vote for Labour in 2013, having met and been impressed with then Labour leader Ed Miliband. None of the Respect candidates were elected. In George Galloway&#x27;s own seat, the 10,000 majority he had gained at the 2012 Bradford West by-election was reversed, and the Labour Party candidate Naz Shah became the constituency&#x27;s MP with a majority of 11,420 votes.

In December 2015, it became known that former Respect Party leader Salma Yaqoob had applied to join the Labour Party in Hall Green following Jeremy Corbyn&#x27;s election as leader. Her application was rejected by her local constituency Labour Party owing to her standing against Labour candidates.

Robert Colvile reported in &quot;The Spectator&quot; at the beginning of January 2016:

Following his defeat in the 2015 general election, Galloway announced that he would stand as Respect&#x27;s candidate in the 2016 London mayoral election. During hustings, he praised newly elected Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, but condemned Labour Mayoral candidate Sadiq Khan as a &quot;flip-flop merchant&quot; and a &quot;product of the Blairite machine&quot;. In the final result of the London Mayoral election held on 5 May 2016, Galloway came seventh with 37,007 (1.4%) first preference votes. After second preference were accounted for, Sadiq Khan became London mayor. Respect failed to hold any of their seats in Bradford in the 2016 local elections, leaving them without any representation at any level of government.

The Respect Party &quot;voluntarily deregistered&quot; from the Electoral Commission&#x27;s Register of Political Parties on 18 August 2016, twelve years after it initially registered.

==Support==

===Voter base===

Since its formation, Respect has presented itself as being &quot;genuinely left&quot; and has sought to appeal to leftist voters dissatisfied with the Labour Party&#x27;s shift to the centre under the leadership of Blair and Gordon Brown. There has however been little electoral support for parties to the left of Labour in Britain (with some exceptions to the Liberal Democrats, who during the New Labour era broadly positioned themselves to the left), with the party having to seek out an alternative voting base.

The primary electoral support for Respect came from the British Muslim community. Traditionally, British Muslims voted for the Labour Party, but many had been disenchanted following the Labour government&#x27;s decision to invade Iraq. Respect appealed in particular to British Muslims who had been disenchanted by the war. According to Emmanuel Karagiannis, &quot;now that the old working class has assimilated into an expanded middle class, the radical Left is obviously looking for a new constituency, and Europe&#x27;s deprived and alienated Muslim communities may well be the answer.&quot; The political scientist Stephen Driver suggested that this over-reliance on dissatisfied Muslim voters left its electoral base &quot;fragile&quot;, for when &quot;the source of the protest disappears, so do the protest votes&quot;.

At no point did Respect position itself as a specifically Muslim party akin to the Islamic Party of Britain or the Muslim Party in Birmingham, however from its beginnings it did specifically target Muslims with its campaign material, characterising itself as &quot;the party for Muslims&quot; and focusing on issues of particular concern to British Muslim communities. A local election flyer printed in 2004 featured the slogan &quot;George Galloway – Fighting for Muslim Rights!&quot; It often fielded Muslim candidates to stand in largely Muslim areas, although this was not unusual in British politics, with Labour, the Conservatives, and the Liberal Democrats often doing the same.

Respect&#x27;s main electoral support base was in East London and Birmingham. However, there were other areas of Britain with large Islamic communities—such as Yorkshire, Lancashire, and Leicester—where the party did not do well. Peace suggested that Respect had been successful in East London and Birmingham and not other areas with Muslim communities because these two areas had established anti-war movements and that Respect candidates had already become well known within that movement.

It has also been suggested that Respect&#x27;s connection to religious groups and mosques has been crucial to the party&#x27;s success in many areas. It attracted some controversy for allegedly being tied to the Islamic Forum of Europe (IFE), a group based at the East London Mosque in Tower Hamlets. Both &quot;The Telegraph&quot; and &quot;Dispatches&quot; have alleged that Respect activist Miah is an IFE member, although he has denied this.

==Reception==
Respect received little attention from scholars of politics. This may be due to the perception that it was a single-issue party that provided a protest vote among a particular community. As with the Greens, Respect was recognised as having radical views but was nonetheless widely regarded as a legitimate part of politics in the UK. In this it contrasted with the pariah status accorded to contemporary far-right groups such as the British National Party (BNP). In just over two years, it had gained the electoral success that the BNP had taken twenty years to attain.

Respect was controversial within Britain&#x27;s far-left movement. Far-left criticisms of the party included that it was engaging in political opportunism, that it invited the petty bourgeoisie into the socialist workers&#x27; movement, and that it focused on the narrow sectarian interests of British Muslims rather than the socio-economic issues of the working-class and in doing so neglected feminism and LGBT rights. According to &quot;Guardian&quot; journalist Dave Hill, Respect was &quot;a case study in the British far left&#x27;s enduring gift for self-parodic, self-destructive splits&quot;.

==Criticisms of Respect==

===Equality===
Respect has been accused of abandoning some traditional cultural liberal issues, including women&#x27;s rights, abortion, gay rights, and fighting homophobia, to attract Muslim support. While Respect included opposition to discrimination based on gender and sexual orientation in its founding declaration, critics claim that Galloway – during the time he was a Respect MP – tended to avoid parliamentary votes involving equal rights for gay people. In a 2006 interview with &quot;PinkNews&quot;, Galloway praised New Labour&#x27;s record on improving gay rights, and says of his absence from one vote that &quot;there was never any doubt about the passage of the civil partnerships [bill], I wholly support it&quot;.

According to a resolution at that year&#x27;s conference, Respect&#x27;s 2005 manifesto omitted the &quot;defence of LGBT rights despite policy adopted at last year&#x27;s AGM and contained in the founding statement&quot;. A resolution was passed calling for the end to all discrimination against lesbians, gay men, bisexuals and transgender people and that this policy would be stated in all of its manifestos and principal election materials. Despite this commitment, Respect and parts of the LGBT community have clashed on several occasions. In November 2005, Respect&#x27;s second largest single financial donor, Mohammad Naseem, was accused in an article by Peter Tatchell of being homophobic due to his senior position in the Islamic Party of Britain, which Tatchell claimed advocated the &quot;banning of gay organisations&quot; and the &quot;execution of homosexuals&quot;. Naseem, however, stated that the Islamic Party was now little more than a thinktank, and furthermore, disagreed with the statements on the Islamic Party website which Tatchell pointed to, stating his views on homosexuality as follows: &quot;These things are a matter of personal choice [...] I am not concerned with what people do in their bedrooms.&quot; Naseem was also present at Respect&#x27;s 2005 conference, where the vote to reaffirm Respect&#x27;s support of LGBT rights was passed unanimously.

In January 2006, an article attacking Tatchell&#x27;s opposition to the party was written by Respect member and journalist Adam Yosef. Writing for &quot;Desi Xpress&quot;, Yosef accused Tatchell of Islamophobia but was attacked by gay organisations for &quot;encouraging violence against Tatchell&quot; and for using &quot;xenophobic&quot; and &quot;homophobic&quot; language. Yosef also used other articles to attack same-sex unions, describing them as a front for &quot;tax fraud&quot;. Tatchell called on Respect to expel Yosef but the party responded with the following statement: &quot;Adam Yosef has the right to voice his own opinions in his own column – they range from an ecstatic review of Birmingham&#x27;s gay pride to venting his thoughts about Peter Tatchell.&quot; However, in October 2009, Yosef pledged his formal support to Tatchell&#x27;s 2010 general election parliamentary candidacy, calling for the left to &quot;embrace a mutual personal and political commitment towards equality and human rights&quot;.

===Antisemitism===
Abul Hussain, a former member of Respect&#x27;s national council, posted antisemitic comments on Facebook and was expelled for his comments in September 2010. The councillor joked about chopping off a Jewish person&#x27;s sidelocks and confiscating their kippah. He also wrote about Jews, &quot;Here&#x27;s a penny go put it in the bank and [you] just might get a pound after ten years interest!&quot;. The Respect Party stated that &quot;such views are demonstrably incompatible with party membership&quot;.

In 2011 Carole Swords, of Bow, the chairwoman of the Respect Party in Tower Hamlets, was convicted of a public order offence after an altercation with a Jewish counter-protester, Harvey Garfield, at a protest inside a Covent Garden Tesco Metro supermarket. She was alleged to have struck him in the face, smacking off his eyeglasses, while he was protecting Israeli goods from potentially being damaged. A subsequent appeal in December cleared her of the offence. Swords&#x27; defence team claimed Garfield had harassed and intimidated Swords inside the supermarket, and alleging he had called her a &quot;Nazi&quot;, a &quot;fishwife&quot; and a &quot;terrorist&quot;. The recorder determined that Garfield had followed Swords inside the Tesco and that she had demanded he desist. The recorder could not determine how Garfield&#x27;s glasses had fallen based on the store footage, and allowed the appeal. Swords had earlier described Zionists as &quot;cockroaches ... bugs [which] need to be stomped out&quot; and at a different rally, Swords had told a Jewish protester to &quot;go back to Russia&quot;.

Following Naz Kahn&#x27;s appointment as Respect&#x27;s women&#x27;s officer in Bradford in October 2012, it emerged that Kahn had recently commented on Facebook that &quot;history teachers in our school&quot; were and are &quot;the first to start brainwashing us and our children into thinking the bad guy was Hitler. What have the Jews done good in this world??&quot; David Aaronovitch in &quot;The Jewish Chronicle&quot; wrote: What have the Jews done good in this world?&#x27; clearly means &#x27;The Jews do only bad&#x27;. The Jews haven&#x27;t suffered as much as they say they have, but insofar as they have suffered it&#x27;s their own fault and, in any case, they have gone on to inflict equal or more suffering on others. That&#x27;s &#x27;the Jews&#x27; as a group, not &#x27;many Jews&#x27;, &#x27;some Jews&#x27; or &#x27;a few Jews&#x27;.&quot; Ron McKay, Galloway&#x27;s spokesman, said Kahn&#x27;s comments had been written shortly before she joined Respect, on an &quot;unofficial site&quot; (the Respect Bradford Facebook page), and that she &quot;now deeply regrets and repudiates that posting&quot;.

The last formal leader of Respect, George Galloway, has been accused by &quot;Guardian&quot; journalist Hadley Freeman of having &quot;said and done things that cross the line from anti-Israel to antisemitic&quot;. He threatened to sue her for the comments made on Twitter in February 2015, although the tweet had already been deleted. Her tweet followed the &quot;Question Time&quot; George Galloway in Finchley controversy, an edition of the BBC&#x27;s political debate series on which Freeman&#x27;s &quot;Guardian&quot; colleague Jonathan Freedland had also appeared and made similar assertions about Galloway&#x27;s conduct.

Galloway&#x27;s support for Hizbollah and Hamas, his refusal to debate with Israeli Jews, and his declaration of Bradford as being an &quot;Israeli-free zone&quot; are among the issues which have led to the attitudes of the politician being thought suspect.

<text>Football Park, known commercially as AAMI Stadium, was an Australian rules football stadium located in West Lakes, a western suburb of Adelaide, the state capital of South Australia, Australia. It was built in 1973 by the South Australian National Football League (SANFL) and opened in 1974. Until the end of the 2013 AFL season, it served as the home ground of South Australia&#x27;s AFL clubs, the Adelaide Football Club and Port Adelaide Football Club. It also hosted all SANFL finals from 1974 to 2013. Demolition of the stadium&#x27;s grandstands began in August 2018, and finished in March 2019.

Despite the demolition of all grandstands, the stadium&#x27;s playing surface was retained. The surface is used by the Adelaide Football Club as its primary training ground, and is also accessible to the public.

== History ==
Ground was broken for Football Park in 1971, giving the SANFL its own venue after years of playing out of the Adelaide Oval, which was controlled by the South Australian Cricket Association (SACA). Due to ongoing conflicts with the SACA, the SANFL had wanted to leave Adelaide Oval and move into their own home stadium for a number of years, finally settling on the undeveloped swampland at West Lakes in 1970 (the same year as the similarly designed, but larger VFL Park opened in Melbourne).

The stadium hosted its first football game on 4 May 1974, a SANFL match between Central District and North Adelaide. The first goal was kicked by North Adelaide&#x27;s Barry Hearl, but Central District won the game defeating North Adelaide by 30 points.

Intended to have a capacity of around 80,000, Football Park was originally standing room only in the outer (along with the usual crush barriers) with bench seating in the main grandstand and ended up with a capacity of approximately 62,000. Bench seating was gradually added to the stadium&#x27;s bowl section, and the concourse roof was finished in 1982, by which time the grounds capacity had settled to around 55,000. The new roof gave the outer of the ground a limited number of under cover seats, as well as opening up more space for advertising boards. Television screens showing the games in progress at the ground are also in place under the concourse roof, as well as in the members area.

After long-term negotiations with the State Government and the local council, as well as local residents, the SANFL started building the ground&#x27;s four light towers in late 1983. These were finished by early 1984, with all night games in Adelaide moving from the suburban grounds (Norwood Oval and Thebarton Oval) to league headquarters for the next 16 years. Following Adelaide joining the AFL in 1991, and being joined by Port Adelaide in 1997, new corporate &quot;superboxes&quot; were built on top of the southern concourse, stretching from the scoreboard around to the members grandstand. The following year (1998) the stadium got its first video superscreen, although the old scoreboard located above the tunnel in the south-east corner remained in place as the main scoreboard.

After years of speculation, Football Park&#x27;s members grandstand was extended in 2001 with the opening of the new Northern Grandstand, opening up 7,000 new seats. The new grandstand was fitted with individual plastic seats, and the rest of the stadium was finally brought into line with this in 2004, seeing an end to the unpopular aluminum bench seating, and dropping capacity to 51,240.

In addition to football, Football Park has also hosted cricket matches, including the Kerry Packer-run World Series Cricket competition of the late 1970s when the upstart competition was shut out of major grounds such as the Adelaide Oval. And from 1984–1988 after the stadium got lights, Football Park also hosted the South Australian state one-day team in day/night McDonald&#x27;s Cup games that the Adelaide Oval could not host due to it not getting lights until 1997.

The stadium has also hosted International rules football games between Australia and Ireland, as well as being used for rock concerts. Football Park also hosted a National Soccer League game during the early-mid 1990s.

The record football crowd at Football Park was 66,897 when Sturt defeated Port Adelaide in the 1976 SANFL Grand Final, though police believe the attendance figure was closer to 80,000. To avoid a crush, spectators were allowed on the field between the boundary line and the fence, and thousands were turned away by police as the house full signs went up. It was after this game that the original intended capacity of 80,000 was deemed unworkable for safety reasons so capacity was capped at around 62,000.

Adelaide and Port Adelaide played their last home games at Football Park in 2013, with both clubs moving to the Adelaide Oval in 2014. The record Showdown attendance at Football Park was recorded at &quot;Showdown XIX&quot; on 10 September 2005 when 50,521 saw the Crows defeat the Power by 83 points in the 2005 First Semi Final. A pre-season match was played at the ground between the two sides in March 2015, in what was the last official event to be held at the ground.

=== Concerts ===
Major artists held concerts at Football Park, including The Beach Boys, ABBA, Neil Diamond, Alice Cooper, Dire Straits, Electric Light Orchestra, U2, The Rolling Stones, Genesis, Elton John with the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra on 21 November 1986 and Robbie Williams. Bon Jovi performed at Football Park in December 2013, while One Direction performed in February 2015.

== Upgrades ==

After it was built, Football Park underwent several additions including:

* In 1982 the outer concourse was completed during the SANFL season giving a limited number of permanent undercover seats for the general public. The stadium was also converted to an all-seater stadium with the installation of aluminium bench seating on the outer&#x27;s lower deck which had previously been concrete terraces (the seating had already been installed in the members area which included the main grandstand). This reduced capacity at the time from 62,000 to around 55,000.
* In 1984 the light towers were installed. The first game played under lights at the stadium was an Escort Cup match which saw South Adelaide defeat Glenelg 10.9 (69) to 7.8 (50). The game was Glenelg champion Peter Carey&#x27;s 300th game of SANFL league football. To appease the local residents, night games at Football Park had a 10:30pm curfew.
* In 1985 alcohol was banned from the seats. Alcohol could only be consumed in the bar areas. In 2009, this ban was removed.
* In 1997 the stadium opened new corporate facilities, with Superboxes at the southern end of the ground extending from the outer side tunnel to the members grandstand.
* In 1998 a superscreen was added to the north-east side of the ground.
* In 2001 the balcony upper level of seats was extended towards the Northern End of the ground giving an extra 7,000 seats to the stadium.
* In 2004 the existing aluminium bench seating on the lower deck was replaced with plastic bucket seats leaving the seating capacity at 51,240.
* In 2007:
** The sound system was upgraded with new plastic PA speakers installed all around the stadium.
** A new and louder siren was installed.
** Another superscreen was installed at the southern end of the ground to aid viewers sitting under the existing superscreen on the northeast side of the ground.
** A new scoreboard was built under the existing superscreen.

Further upgrades, which largely did not eventuate, were proposed in June 2008.

== Demolition and future usage by the Adelaide Football Club and SANFL==
Proposed upgrades to the stadium were abandoned following confirmation that both Adelaide and Port Adelaide would move matches to the newly redeveloped Adelaide Oval, which has a capacity of 53,583 and is located very close to the city. Adelaide Football Club continued to use the oval as their headquarters, and have their own clubrooms, administrative offices and indoor training facilities on the eastern side of the ground, a similar arrangement to what fellow AFL club have with Waverley Park in Melbourne. The club announced their intention to move their training headquarters to an upgraded Thebarton Oval sports precinct in June 2024, and are expected to complete the move in 2026. During this time, the local council approved an application by the SANFL to a 42-year lease on the Football Park oval, enabling SANFL offices to return to Football Park in a newly designed building adjacent to the oval and have exclusivity of the oval for approximately three hours on weeknights and five hours on weekends. 

The SANFL Grand Final was moved back to its original home at the Adelaide Oval from 2014. The SANFL announced a long-term development plan for the precinct in November 2014 with property developers Commercial &amp; General for AU$71 million. It was announced that the land will be redeveloped for 1,600 new houses, a library, retail area and a five-storey, 120-bed aged care facility. Following the announcement, most of the seating at the ground was removed and given to local football clubs, before full-scale demolition work on the grandstands began in August 2018. The demolition of the grandstands was completed in March 2019.

== Dimensions ==
The playing surface covered approximately 2 hectares, with the average distance between the boundary line and fence being six metres. The ground dimensions from fence to fence were and the playing area inside the boundary lines was and the goals ran north to south. There was a drop of approximately 1.5 metres from the centre of the ground to the fence to help with drainage, leaving the ground with a distinctive hump.

<doc id="463144" wikidata="Q635704" url="?curid=463144" title="Interactionism">
<text>In micro-sociology, interactionism is a theoretical perspective that sees social behavior as an interactive product of the individual and the situation. In other words, it derives social processes (such as conflict, cooperation, identity formation) from social interaction, whereby subjectively held meanings are integral to explaining or understanding social behavior.

This perspective studies the ways in which individuals shape, and are shaped by, society through their interactions. Interactionism thus argues that the individual is an active and conscious piece of the social-context system, rather than merely a passive object in their environment. It believes interactions to be guided by meanings that are attached to the self, to others with whom each individual interacts, and to situations of interaction; all of which are altered in interaction themselves. In this sense, interactionism may stand in contrast to studies of socialization, insofar as interactionism conceives individuals to influence groups at least as much as groups influence individuals.

George Herbert Mead, as an advocate of pragmatism and the subjectivity of social reality, is considered a leader in the development of interactionism. Herbert Blumer expanded on Mead&#x27;s work and coined the term &quot;symbolic interactionism&quot;.

Through this perspective (under modern techniques), one may observe human behavior by three parts: trait, situation, and interaction (between trait and situation). &#x27;Trait&#x27; refers to the extent to which personality directly affects behaviour, independent of the situation (and therefore consistently across different situations); &#x27;situation&#x27; takes into account the extent to which all different people will provide basically the same response to a given situation; and &#x27;interaction&#x27; involves the ways in which the same situation affects individual people differently.

==Subcategories and scholars==
Interactionism has several subcategories:

* Classical interactionism
* Ethnomethodology
* Holistic interactionism
* Phenomenology
* Social action
* Social constructionism
* Symbolic interactionism (Blumerian interactionism)
* Verstehen

=== Influential scholars ===

* George Herbert Mead
* Charles Cooley
* W. I. Thomas
* Herbert Blumer
* Everett Hughes
* Erving Goffman
* Anselm Strauss
* Ralph Turner

==Interactions==
Interactionism is micro-sociological perspective that argues meaning to be produced through the interactions of individuals.

The social interaction is a face-to-face process consisting of actions, reactions, and mutual adaptation between two or more individuals, with the goal of communicating with others. (It also includes animal interaction such as mating.) The interaction includes all language (including body language) and mannerisms. If the interaction is in danger of ending before one intends it to, it can be conserved by conforming to the others&#x27; expectations, by ignoring certain incidents or by solving apparent problems.

Erving Goffman underlined the importance of control in the interaction: one must attempt to control the others&#x27; behaviour during the interaction, in order to attain the information one is seeking and to control the perception of one&#x27;s own image. Important concepts in the field of interactionism include the &quot;social role&quot; and Goffman&#x27;s &quot;presentation of self.&quot;

==Methodology==
Interactionists are interested in how people see themselves in the broader social context and how they act within society.

In extreme cases, interactionists would deny social class to be an issue, arguing that people from one class cannot be generalized to all think in one way. Instead, these interactionists believe everyone has different attitudes, values, culture, and beliefs. Therefore, it is the duty of the sociologist to carry out the study within society; they set out to gather qualitative data.

===Rejection of positivist methods===
Interactionists reject statistical (quantitative) data, a method preferred by post-positivists. These methods include: experiments, structured interviews, questionnaires, non-participant observation, and secondary sources. This rejection is based in a few basic criticisms, namely:
*Statistical data is not &quot;valid;&quot; in other words, these methods do not provide people with a true picture of society on the topic being researched.
*Quantitative research is biased and therefore not objective. Whilst the sociologist would be distant, it is argued that the existence of a hypothesis implies that the research is biased towards a pre-set conclusion (e.g., Rosenhan experiment in 1973). Therefore, such research is rejected by interactionists, who claim that it is artificial and also raises ethical issues to experiment on people.

===Preferred interactionist methods===
Interactionists prefer several methods to contrast those of structuralism, particularly: unstructured interviews, covert participant observation, overt participant observation, and content analysis via analysing historical, public, and personal documents.

Interactionist methods generally reject the absolute need to provide statistics. Statistics allows cause-and-effect to be shown, as well as isolating variables so that relationships and trends can be distinguished over time. Instead, interactionists want to &quot;go deep&quot; to explain society, however this draws criticisms, including:
*Information and sociological research cannot be compared or contrasted, hence one can never truly understand how society changes.
*Data is not reliable.
*Gathered information is interpreted (hence the name &quot;Interpretivist&quot;) by a sociologist, therefore it is not objective.

Despite these criticisms, interactionist methods do allow flexibility. The fact that there is no hypothesis means that the sociologist is not rooted in an attempt to prove dogma or theory. Instead, researchers react to what they discover, not assuming anything about society. (This is not entirely true: there can be hypotheses for many studies using interactionist methods. The researcher may then be inclined to observe certain events happening while ignoring the bigger picture. This will still bias the results, if such studies are not well conducted. This is arguably why some theorists have turned to this method. It also shows how human behaviour is affected and altered through interactions i.e. socialization.)

===Case studies===
*Field experiments:
**In the Rosenhan experiment, David Rosenhan (1973) found 8 normal researchers to carry out a study, at 12 hospitals, of the treatment of mental health in California. Critics argue that the method was unethical, and the vast majority of interactionists concur.
*Unstructured interviews:
**Aaron Cicourel and John Kitsuse (1963) conducted an ethnomethodology study in American schools.
**Howard Becker (1971)
**William Labov (1973) conducted a study of sociolinguistics.
**Joan Smith (1998)
*Participant observation:
**John Howard Griffin
**Michael Haralambos.

==Links to other theories==
Interactionism, or the idea that individuals have more awareness, skill and power to change their own situation, links to several other theories.

* Neo-Marxism is a loose term for various 20th-century approaches that amend or extend Marxism and Marxist theory, usually by incorporating elements from other intellectual traditions, such as critical theory, psychoanalysis, or existentialism.
* Pluralism is the idea that the &quot;public gets what the public wants.&quot; It is the notion that our lives offer choice like a representative democracy. This idea of consumer choice means that each individual has power as a consumer to change any aspect of life if he/she wishes to do so. The situation that exists is, according to the theory, a reflection of the norms, values and beliefs of the majority of people. It fits with the idea of individual power, although interactionist sociologists may not accept the idea that we are all labeled as &quot;consumers&quot;.

<text>Danzig law (; in Polish: &quot;Gdański Wilkierz&quot; ) was the official set of records of the laws of city of Danzig (Gdańsk).

== History ==


The models for the Danzig Law were the statute books of the Holy Roman Empire and of other Hanseatic cities, especially Lübeck. The merchant city received Lübeck law in 1226.

In the 15th century, the Prussian Confederation was founded to oppose the policy of the Teutonic Order. The Prussian Confederation supported accession to Poland, triggering the Thirteen Years&#x27; War. During that time, Danzig continued with its own set of law system, which its self-government. The recognition of this law, and other Danzig&#x27;s privileges, by the King of Poland was a prerequisite for allying with him resp. subjecting as Royal Prussia to his overlordship. The Second Peace of Thorn of 1466 confirmed the rights. When they were in danger in the 1570s, it led to the Danzig rebellion and the Siege of Danzig (1577).

In the First Partition of Poland in 1772, the Kingdom of Prussia took over Royal Prussia (but not yet Danzig and Thorn (Toruń)) and called it West Prussia. The Latin names &quot;Prussia Orientalis&quot; and &quot;Prussia Occidentalis&quot; were for centuries prior used for both parts (East and West) of Prussia. Danzig continued its self-government for two decades to come, then in 1793 was annexed by the Kingdom of Prussia and its Prussian Danzig Law codes were supplanted by standardized Prussian laws.

===Danziger Willkür===
There were several incarnations of the laws that mainly covered internal government:
* 1435–1448 (draft)
* 1455 first known written form 
* 1479–1500
* 1574 during succession dispute leading to the Siege of Danzig (1577)
* 1597 &quot;Der See- und Handelstadt Dantzig Rechte oder Willkür&quot; (&quot;The Laws of the Sea and Trade City of Danzig&quot;)
* 1678 (draft)
* 1732 re-print of the 1597 Danzig Laws, by Seelmann, Danzig
* 1761

===Danziger privilege===
The privileges of Danzig confirmed rights of Danzig in external relations, like trading, coinage, and since 1454, with the Polish Crown. 

Danzig had a special status, due to its large population (in 1772 47,600 inside the city walls, 35,000 to 40,000 outside), its harbour and wealth. Some of its politicians maintained that it was loyal only to the King of Poland, claiming that its status was similar to an Imperial Free City. This position was never accepted by the Sejm. Modern German author compare it to status of Marseille in 16th and 17th century towards the French King.

===Historians===
Already in the 17th century, local historians studied the history of Danzig law, such as Elias Constantius von Treuen-Schroeder (1625–1680) and Johann Ernst von der Linde (1651–1721). They did not publish, but Gottfried Lengnich acknowledged their work in the foreword to his &quot;Ius publicum civitatis Gedanensis oder der Stadt Danzig Verfassung und Rechte&quot; (Public law of the city of Danzig, or the city&#x27;s constitution and rights, 1769).
Lengnich wanted to find out whether &quot;us Prussians ... are the Poles equal brothers or their servants&quot;
and encouraged others to study local history, too. Among others Michael Christoph Hanow, Georg Daniel Seyler and David Braun studied the history of their home towns.

<text>Open Financial Exchange (OFX) is a data-stream format for exchanging financial information that evolved from Microsoft&#x27;s Open Financial Connectivity (OFC) and Intuit&#x27;s Open Exchange file formats.

==History==
Microsoft, Intuit and CheckFree announced the OFX standard on 16 January 1997. The first OFX specification, version 1.0, was released on 14 February 1997. The specification allows for bank- and application-specific extensions, although only a subset is necessary to describe a financial transaction.

Versions 1.0 through 1.6 relied on SGML for data exchange, but later versions are XML based. According to the main OFX site, &quot;The specification is freely licensed, allowing any software developer to design an interface that will be supported on the front-end.&quot;

In 2019, OFX&#x27;s consortium joined Financial Data Exchange (FDX) consortium, that manage nowadays OFX working group. 

== Specification ==
The latest reference document (Functional Specification) describing the standard was published in October 2020, in version 2.3, by the FDX consortium&#x27;s OFX working group.

==Support in various countries==
Many banks in the US let customers use personal financial management software to automatically download their bank statements in OFX format, but most Canadian, United Kingdom and Australian banks do not allow this, however, many banks do support downloading financial data in OFX, QFX, QIF, or spreadsheet format via their web interface for later import into financial software.

==Intuit and QFX==
QFX is a proprietary variant of OFX used in Intuit&#x27;s products. In Intuit products, OFX is used for Direct Connect and QFX for Web Connect. Direct Connect allows personal financial management software to connect directly to a bank OFX server, whereas in Web Connect, the user needs to log in and manually download a .qfx file and import it into Quicken.

<text>Juicy Fruit is an American brand of chewing gum made by the Wrigley Company, a U.S. company that since 2008 has been a subsidiary of the privately held Mars, Incorporated. It was introduced in 1893, and in the 21st century the brand name is recognized by 99 percent of Americans, with total sales in 2002 of 153 million units.

==Description==
===Flavor===

Which fruit serves as the model for its flavor is kept vague in advertising, though in 2003, advertising agency BBDO characterized it as a combination of banana and pineapple, and some people say it resembles jackfruit. According to two books in the &quot;Imponderables&quot; series, peach is one crucial flavor among many others.

It is likely that the chemical used for flavoring is isoamyl acetate (sometimes known as &quot;banana oil&quot;), a carboxylic ester, which is also found in jackfruit.

===Consumer demographics===
The average age of the typical Juicy Fruit consumer is under 20, with three to eleven year olds making up the heart of the business; those twenty years old and over account for 40% of the purchases.

Sean Payton, head coach of the Denver Broncos and former head coach of the New Orleans Saints of the NFL, is well known for requesting Juicy Fruit in the middle of games.

===Ingredients===
Juicy Fruit gum consists mostly of sugar contained in a synthetic gum base. Other ingredients include corn syrup and dextrose as bulk agents and natural sweeteners, natural and artificial flavorings, glycerol and lecithin as softening agents, aspartame (NutraSweet) and acesulfame K as artificial sweeteners, Yellow Lake 5 as a coloring and BHT as a preservative.

In the UK, the ingredients used are as listed: Sugar, Gum Base, Glucose Syrup, Flavourings, Humectant (Glycerol), Emulsifier (Soybean Lecithin), Sweeteners (Acesulfame K, Sucralose), Antioxidant (BHA).

==History==
When William Wrigley Jr. started his new business in Chicago, he began by selling his father&#x27;s Scouring Soap, which he would entice customers to purchase by adding a free gift of baking powder. The baking powder offered ended up being far more popular than the Scouring Soap, so he switched to selling the baking powder instead. In 1892, Wrigley Jr. decided to give his baking powder customers a free gift, this time, attaching a few sticks of chewing gum to the box of baking powder.

The chewing gum was far more popular than the baking powder, so Wrigley Jr. again switched his business this time to chewing gum. In 1893, Wrigley Jr. introduced a new flavor of gum, Juicy Fruit, which helped the Wrigley Company to become the most popular and successful chewing gum company in the world.

When the brand first entered the market, it was packaged simply, with a plain wrapper and &quot;JUICY FRUIT&quot; in red, thin block letters. In 1914, Wrigley changed it to thin vertical white and green stripes with &quot;Wrigley&#x27;s Juicy Fruit Chewing Gum&quot; centered in a stylized Maltese Cross emblem with a black background.

Juicy Fruit was taken off of the civilian market temporarily during World War II because of ingredient shortages and the demand for the gum to be included in C-rations. When the gum was reintroduced to the general public after World War II ended, the striped packaging was replaced by one with a bright yellow background and &quot;Juicy Fruit&quot; bracketed between two stylized chevrons, the latter a motif meant to echo the &quot;Wrigley arrow&quot; element used for Wrigley&#x27;s Spearmint since 1893.

The bright yellow background remained into the 21st century, with variations since 2002 turning the arrowhead like chevrons into the corners of an elongated smile under the brand name. Juicy Fruit is still widely popular today.

In 2003 in the United States, Wrigley&#x27;s replaced some of the sugar in Juicy Fruit with two artificial sweeteners, aspartame and Acesulfame potassium. 

&quot;Grapefruit—Juicy Fruit&quot; is a song written and performed by singer-songwriter Jimmy Buffett. It was first released on his 1973 album &quot;A White Sport Coat and a Pink Crustacean&quot; and was his third single from that album. The single reached #23 on the Billboard Easy Listening chart in September 1973.

It also features in the 1983 song &quot;Juicy Fruit&quot; by Mtume. Separately, a Juicy Fruit jingle that ended with the lyrics—&quot;the taste, the taste, the taste is gonna move ya!&quot;—was widely recognizable in TV advertisements throughout the 1980s.

Alongside other famous flavors like Wrigley&#x27;s Spearmint, Juicy Fruit was discontinued in Germany and Austria in 2022.

<text>I&#x27;ll Never Forget What&#x27;s &#x27;Isname, also known as The Takers, is a 1967 British comedy-drama film directed and produced by Michael Winner. It stars Oliver Reed and Orson Welles. It was written by Peter Draper. The film deals with creativity and commercialism.

==Plot==
The opening credits run as a man carries a large axe through the streets of London. He then enters an office and destroys a desk with the axe. The man, Andrew Quint, works for Dallafield Advertising alongside Lute. Quint has a string of affairs with younger women despite being married. He begins to recall his torturous school days, and these memories entwine with the present.

Quint attempts to get back at his boss Jonathan Lute by making a negative commercial reusing themes from earlier in the film, including Lute saying &quot;The number one product of all human endeavor is waste... waste.&quot; The commercial, advertising a Super-8 camera, talks about capturing events while you still can before everything is destroyed and discarded. It ends with Quint operating a car crusher and destroying numerous cameras. The commercial is hailed as a masterpiece, and wins an award, but Quint hurls the award into the River Thames, and escapes into Swinging London.

== Cast ==
== Soundtrack ==
The soundtrack by Francis Lai was released on LP by Decca Records (Decca DL 79163).

== Critical reception ==
&quot;The Monthly Film Bulletin&quot; wrote: &quot;This tragi-comedy is bursting with brightness and ideas, which are on the whole too confused to add up to very much. In its particular brand of cynicism one senses, perhaps mistakenly, the influence of Schlesinger – the same cold eye for human frailty, and the same identification of old school tie sentiments with the worst in human hypocrisy and degradation. ... Intermittently the film both pleases and amuses, particularly when Orson Welles, as the advertising tycoon, makes one of his brief appearances with a remark like &quot;What&#x27;s the going price on integrity this week?&quot;. Oliver Reed makes a credible bounder of Quint, and Wendy Craig gives a moving performance as his neglected wife. Carol White is vivacious as the tragic Georgina, and Otto Heller&#x27;s Technicolor photography gives the subject a distinction that probably goes beyond its deserts.&quot;

Richard Schickel wrote in &quot;Life&quot; magazine: &quot;The people responsible for this movie have taken a big chance, deliberately blowing their cool in the hope that they can overpower ours. For me the gamble worked.&quot;

The &quot;Kentucky Kernel&quot; wrote: &quot;The movie, as a whole, came off as a pessimistic reiteration of the existing war between traditions and society, and individuality and the arts. It sparked here and there and was just about to catch fire when something would inevitably happen to drag it back into the groove it had started for itself.&quot;

Leonard Maltin&#x27;s &quot;2008 Movie Guide&quot; described the film as an &quot;Excellent comedy drama&quot;.

&quot;VideoHound&#x27;s Golden Movie Retriever&quot; 2007 wrote: &quot;To some tastes, this overwrought and long-unseen comedy from the swinging &#x27;60s will be completely dated with characters whose mindsets are totally alien.&quot;

Leslie Halliwell said: &quot;Vivid yet muddled tragi-comedy of the sixties, with splashes of sex and violence in trendy settings, a hero one really doesn&#x27;t believe in, and a title which seems to have no meaning whatsoever.&quot;

== Controversy ==
In the United States, the film was denied a MPAA seal of approval due to a scene between Oliver Reed and Carol White which supposedly implied cunnilingus. Winner, in his audio commentary, said he considered the scene to show masturbation. The Catholic League inaccurately described it as &quot;fellatio&quot;. Universal distributed the film through Regional Film Distributors, a subsidiary that was not a member of the MPAA. Along with a similar scene in &quot;Charlie Bubbles&quot; (1967), this helped to bring about the end of the Production Code in the U.S. and its replacement with a ratings system.

The film has been incorrectly named as the first mainstream film to propose the use in the dialogue of &quot;fuck&quot;. In fact, the BBFC certified the film after demanding the removal, or at least obscuring, of the word fucking (via the sound of a car horn) in June 1967, three months later than &quot;Ulysses&quot; (1967), which suffered heavier cuts. The error seems to have arisen because of a longstanding lack of easily obtainable film release date information.

<text>Hornsby is a suburb on the Upper North Shore of Sydney in the state of New South Wales, Australia, approximately north-west of the Sydney central business district. It is the administrative centre of the local government area of Hornsby Shire.

==History==
The area was initially known as &quot;Hornsby’s Bush&quot;, after the Hornsby family, who were the early settlers. The land was primarily used for agriculture, including farming, timber cutting, and later, mining.

The name Hornsby is derived from convict-turned-constable Samuel Henry Horne, who took part in the apprehension of bushrangers Dalton and MacNamara on 22 June 1830. In return he was granted land which he named Hornsby Place. The suburb of Hornsby was established on the traditional lands of the Darug and Kurringgai people. There are more than 200 known Aboriginal sites in the Hornsby Shire.

The first European settler in the area was Thomas Higgins, who received a grant of land in Old Mans Valley. The Higgins family eventually established the private Old Man&#x27;s Valley Cemetery, where family members were buried from 1879 to 1931. The cemetery still exists and is heritage-listed.

A railway station named &quot;Hornsby Junction&quot; opened on 17 September 1886 to the north of the town of Hornsby, which had developed on the site of Horne&#x27;s grant. It formed the junction of the Northern Line and the North Shore Line which were yet to be completed at that time. Hornsby station was one stop further south on the Northern Line. Due to confusion by commuters alighting at the incorrect station expecting to transfer to a connecting train, the old Hornsby station was renamed Normanhurst on 17 November 1898 after prominent local activist and engineer Norman Selfe, while the Hornsby Junction station assumed the current name of Hornsby.

The first Hornsby Post Office opened on 1 August 1864, and was renamed South Hornsby on 1 May 1900, the same day Hornsby Junction office near the railway station (open since 1887) was renamed Hornsby. The latter office remains open; the South Hornsby office was renamed Normanhurst in 1905.

Hornsby Park was originally assisted as a government recreation reserve in 1896 on part of the original Thomas Higgins land grant of 1836.

Residential growth in the area was left to private developers, who acquired land both east and west of the railway station. Realizing that working class housing tended to be close to railway stations, the developers aimed at providing the middle classes with quality housing further from the station, in areas with views. One of the first purchasers of land in the area was Annie Roberts, wife of Oscar Garibaldi Roberts, who became one of the first councilors in the Hornsby Shire. Having acquired a property in Rosemead Road, the Roberts family built &quot;Mount Errington&quot;, a spectacular mansion in the Arts and Crafts style, now heritage-listed.
The Roberts family later acquired twelve blocks of land, which were then sub-divided into twenty-three blocks and offered for sale as the Roberts Mount Errington Sub-division. The area proceeded to grow as a prestige housing estate, featuring a number of houses in the Federation style. One of them was Birklands, a heritage-listed, Federation house built in 1902 in Dural Street. The house was originally built for Louis Spier Roberts and his wife Elizabeth, and stayed with the Roberts family until 1938.

The Hornsby Shire Council was established in 1906. In 1961, the Westfield Hornsby shopping mall opened, making it one of the first suburbs in Sydney with a modern-style shopping centre. A competing shopping centre, Northgate, opened in 1979 but was eventually bought by Westfield. In late 1999, the two sites were amalgamated when the original Westfield was demolished and Northgate was renovated to create the new Westfield Hornsby which opened in November 2001.

In the years following World War II, Hornsby saw rapid suburbanisation and population growth, driven by Sydney&#x27;s expanding suburban development. The area, previously known for its rural and semi-rural character, began to see more residential housing developments. This transformation was part of the broader trend in Sydney, where suburban sprawl increased as people moved out of the crowded city centre. Its transport infrastructure also improved and the development of the rail network played a key role, with Hornsby station becoming a major interchange for commuters travelling to Sydney. The construction of the Pacific Highway and later the M1 motorway, opened in 1955, made road travel through the suburb more convenient.

In October 2022, the painting of vibrant street art in the Dural Lane area of Hornsby was completed.

Today, Hornsby is a bustling local center, with a blend of residential, commercial and recreational spaces. The area retains its significant natural beauty, in closeness to the nearby Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park.

==Transport==

Hornsby is by train and about by road from the Sydney central business district. Hornsby railway station is the junction of the T1 North Shore and the T9 Northern Line of the Sydney Trains network and is a hub for some services and is connected via bridge to Westfield. There are frequent railway services to the central business district via Strathfield or via Gordon. Intercity and regional trains also stop at Hornsby on the way to the Central Coast, Newcastle and further north.

Bus services operate from Hornsby Station Interchange. Services are operated by CDC NSW. to local residential areas including Hornsby Heights, Westleigh, Normanhurst, Thornleigh, Wahroonga, Warrawee, Turramurra and St Ives

CDC NSW operates two cross regional services from the Hornsby Interchange with;
* Route 575 to Macquarie University via Wahroonga, Turramurra, Pymble, Macquarie Park and Macquarie Centre
*600 to Parramatta via Cherrybrook, Castle Hill &amp; Baulkham Hills and Northmead

Hornsby Interchange is served by two NightRide bus routes with:
* Route N80 - to Town Hall via Strathfield operated by Busways
* Route N90 - to Town Hall via Chatswood operated by Busways

The Pacific Highway, which passes through Hornsby, was formerly the main road link between Sydney and north-eastern Australia. The completion of the Pacific Motorway (M1), which has its southern end at the neighbouring suburb of Wahroonga, means that the heavy traffic now bypasses the already busy Hornsby town area.

In October 2020, the northernmost section of the NorthConnex tunnel also located in close proximity to Hornsby in the neighbouring suburb of Wahroonga was opened.

The opening of the NorthConnex was a key missing link to the Sydney Motorway network and its opening provides direct connectivity from the M1 to the Sydney orbital motorway network through a direct underground connection to the M2 and M7 motorways and beyond. The tunnel also provides an alternate route to the Sydney CBD, Ryde area and Eastern and Inner West suburbs via the Lane Cove Tunnel, bypassing the congested Pennant Hills Road and Pacific Highway.

==Commercial areas==

Hornsby remains a busy commercial centre, just as it was a century ago. Over the years, the town centre has developed distinct characteristics on either side of the railway line.

The western side consists of a traditional high street shopping village along the Old Pacific Highway. A short section of the highway north of the shops still has several antique lamp posts preserved. On the eastern side of the highway from south to north are the police station, the court house and the historic Hornsby Shire Council chamber (built in two stages in 1915 and 1930). On the western side is Hornsby Park with the new Hornsby Aquatic Centre complex and also Hornsby TAFE. A large war memorial and the adjacent RSL Club is located at the southern end of the shops.

The eastern side is dominated by Westfield Hornsby, a shopping centre, which features a David Jones department store, an Event Cinemas multiplex, 335 stores, a food court and several restaurants. The intersection of Florence Street and Hunter Street became a pedestrian mall in the early 1990s. At the centre of the pedestrian mall is a large water clock sculpture, designed by Victor Cusack. The public library, Hornsby Shire Library, is also located in this area.

The north-western side of the suburb is occupied by various industries and the northern end of Hornsby features a major railway workshop.

==Residential areas==

Residential areas, consisting of low-to-medium density housing, are located on both sides of the railway line. Many of the residential areas on the western side of the train line enjoy bushy surrounds and close proximity to Regional and National Parks, as well as the beautiful Lisgar Gardens.

In recent years, high-rise apartments have been constructed adjacent to the train line as part of the NSW state planning policies to allow medium to high density development along transport corridors.

==Schools==
Hornsby is home to a number of schools, including primary schools Hornsby North Public School, Hornsby South Public School, Hornsby Heights Public School and Clarke Road Special School and the secondary schools Barker College and Hornsby Girls&#x27; High School, which is a selective school. There is also a TAFE College at the north-western side of Hornsby.

==Culture==
Hornsby has long been associated with &quot;Ginger Meggs&quot;, a cartoon by Jimmy Bancks who grew up in Hornsby, which has appeared in Australian newspapers since 1921.

The local newspaper that serves the area is the Hornsby and Upper North Shore Advocate, owned by the Cumberland Newspaper Group.

==Hornsby Aquatic Centre==
Hornsby Aquatic Centre, which was built in 1962, had reached the end of its safe working life, and was closed on Friday 24 December 2010. It had featured a fifty-metre pool with 8 lanes and a small twelve-metre pool, also with 8 lanes. A new pool was built and opened on 11 August 2014.

== Parks and gardens ==
===Edgeworth David Garden===
The scientist and explorer Edgeworth David lived in Hornsby towards the end of his life. His house, known as &quot;Coringah&quot;, was set well back from Burdett Street on a mixed bushland property that extended along Sherbrook Road between Burdett and Northcote Road, and included a large garden. This property had originally been obtained in 1901 by Edward Swain, who built the cottage that still stands. The property was purchased by Edward Lear in 1916 and then by Edgeworth David in 1920. David&#x27;s wife continued to live there after his death in 1934.

After David&#x27;s death, subsequent owners preserved the garden, until Hornsby Shire Council acquired the entire property in 1999, adding the grounds (as Neal Park) to its Bushcare program. That same year, the entire property was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register, listed as Edgeworth David&#x27;s House and Grounds. Since 2016, the Edgeworth David Community Garden is located on the grounds.

===Lisgar Gardens===
Lisgar Gardens are located in Lisgar Road, west of the Pacific Highway. The gardens were created by Max Cotton, who lived in Lisgar Road. In 1920, Cotton purchased land from his brother Leo and began developing the gardens for his own interest and satisfaction. With these gardens, Cotton could indulge his interest in horticulture and genetics. Aided by friends and family, he created extensive gardens and fishponds on the natural bushland that sloped down from Lisgar Road.

Cotton became friends with Professor Eben Gowrie Waterhouse—owner of Eryldene in the suburb of Gordon—and the two spent much time together, sharing an interest in camellias. By the mid-1960s, Cotton&#x27;s health was failing after forty-five years of working on the gardens, and they were acquired by Hornsby Council. They were officially opened to the public on 21 September 1968. They are heritage-listed.

===Florence Cotton Park===
This park consists of a stretch of natural bushland between Frederick Street and Lisgar Gardens. Jimmy Bancks Creek runs through the park. Birdlife is varied and includes currawongs and brushturkeys. Hornsby Council has constructed a walking track that goes from Frederick Street to Lisgar Gardens. The park is named after Florence Cotton, wife of Leo Cotton, and was part of their estate. Florence Street in Hornsby was also named after her.

===Ginger Meggs Park===
This park is located in Valley Road and is named after Ginger Meggs, a comic-strip character created by the Australian cartoonist Jimmy Bancks. Bancks spent much time in the area around this park during his childhood, so Hornsby Council named it after his famous character Ginger Meggs. A nearby creek was named Jimmy Bancks Creek. The park was officially named Ginger Meggs Park during a formal naming ceremony by the mayor of Hornsby, John Muirhead, on 26 July 1997.

===Hornsby Quarry===
The quarry, located at the end of Quarry Road Hornsby, was partially filled, to make it safe, using excavated material from the NorthConnex tunnel which was built by the NSW Government and completed in 2020, to link the M1 and M2 motorways. For geological reasons the quarry has been nominated as State Heritage. The Quarry project was completed in the first quarter of 2019. A$50 million state budget will be allocated to turn the quarry into a future recreational park.

<text>Stellamedusa is a genus of jellyfish. The genus is monotypic with a single species recognized, Stellamedusa ventana.

The species was first described in the &quot;Journal of the Marine Biological Association&quot; in 2004 by Kevin Raskoff and George Matsumoto of the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute. As of February 2004, seven specimens have been observed, five off the California coast in Monterey Bay and two in the Gulf of California. Unlike most medusae, they lack marginal tentacles. Specimens so far found reach almost 10 cm in diameter, which is large for a scyphomedusa. The bell is blue-white in colour. The exumbrella is white, and this and the four oral arms are covered with large nematocyst-laden projections filled with stinging cells, enabling the jelly to capture food items of a variety of sizes; it seems to prefer large prey, up to half its size, which is unusual in jellies that capture prey with their bells rather than with tentacles. The bumpy appearance that the stinging cells give to the jelly led to its common name. The species name comes from the remotely operated vehicle (ROV) &quot;Ventana&quot;, a deep-diving robot submarine that first recorded the jelly on video in 1990.

&quot;Stellamedusa ventana&quot; has so far been observed only at mesopelagic depths, i.e. between 150 and 550 meters. At these depths, sunlight does not penetrate, but there is still a reasonable amount of oxygen. Many species of jellyfishes live at this level, and it is likely that &quot;S. ventana&quot; feeds primarily on other jellies. Another large jellyfish discovered by the same researchers is &quot;Tiburonia granrojo&quot;.

<text>Hot Topic, Inc. is an American fast-fashion company specializing in counterculture-related clothing and accessories, as well as licensed music. The stores are aimed towards an audience interested in rock music and video gaming, and most of their audience ranges from teens to young adults. In 2007, approximately 40% of Hot Topic&#x27;s revenue comes from sales of licensed band T-shirts. The majority of the stores are located in regional shopping malls.

==History==

The first Hot Topic store was opened in November 1989 in Montclair Plaza, Montclair, California, by Orv Madden, a former executive at The Children&#x27;s Place, who retired as CEO in 2000 and was replaced by Betsy McLaughlin, who headed the company until 2011. Lisa Harper assumed the position of CEO in March 2011 until Steve Vranes was announced as the new CEO in 2016. The company went public and began trading on NASDAQ in 1996.

In 2013, Hot Topic announced its sale to private equity firm Sycamore Partners for $600 million. The company ceased publishing financial data after 2013, as previously required as a public company.

In 2024, Hot Topic was the subject of what cybersecurity firm Hudson Rock labeled the &quot;largest retail data breach in history,&quot; involving the theft of personal data belonging to 350 million customers of Hot Topic, Box Lunch, and Torrid, with the stolen data reportedly including names, emails, addresses, phone numbers, birthdates, and partial credit card numbers.

==Product assortment and sales==
The store has gone through a number of phases in its history, reflective of various alternative culture and pop culture (including geek culture) trends (prime examples being Lolita, goth, or cosplay outfits). In the early 2000s, the store was known for heavily marketing nu-metal merchandise relating to bands. During that period, the store was also known for its sales of controversial gel bracelets (often rumored to be &quot;sex bracelets&quot;) as well as the equally controversial styles of phat pants-inspired bondage pants popular among teenagers in the late 1990s and early-to-mid 2000s.

The store later focused on skinny jeans and merchandise related to scene, emo and hardcore punk music and fashion, with a much larger focus on goths and spiky chokers and clothing. At present, the store&#x27;s selection is largely focused on licensed video game merchandise and internet memes popular on sites such as Tumblr, as well as anime, manga, Japanese films, and the associated otaku subculture.

==Ventures==
Hot Topic launched Torrid, a concept store that sells clothing for plus-size women, in 2001. While still under the same parent umbrella as Hot Topic, in 2015 the company branched off to become Torrid, LLC.

In 2008, Hot Topic launched ShockHound, an online retailer and social networking music site. In March 2011, Hot Topic made a public statement announcing the shutdown of ShockHound. The site is no longer live, all merchandise was moved to HotTopic.com, and the company ceased sales of MP3s.

In August 2010, Hot Topic first ventured the international market with opening two outlets in Ontario, Canada, initially at Square One Shopping Centre in Mississauga on August 11, and then at Scarborough Town Centre in Toronto the following day. The company has since also opened additional Canadian locations as well as locations in Puerto Rico.

In 2012, Hot Topic launched Blackheart Lingerie, a concept store that sells lingerie and clothing for women.

On May 26, 2015, Hot Topic announced its intent to acquire Geeknet Inc., owner of the online retailer ThinkGeek, for $122 million. However, the company received a $140 million counter-offer from GameStop, which Hot Topic did not choose to exceed.

On October 14, 2015, Hot Topic launched BoxLunch, a gift and novelty retail store. For every $10 spent, a meal is donated to a person in need.

==Tour sponsorship==
The company sponsored the 2004 Ozzfest concert tour, the 2005 through 2007 Sounds of the Underground tour, the 2008 Taste of Chaos tour, and had a stage at and sponsored the 2008 and 2009 Rockstar Energy Drink Mayhem Festival tours. The company went on to sponsor Black Veil Brides 2014 Black Mass tour with special guests Falling in Reverse.

<doc id="463171" wikidata="Q16215509" url="?curid=463171" title="Mark Ricciuto">
<text>Mark Anthony Ricciuto ( ; born 8 June 1975) is a former Australian rules footballer who played for the Adelaide Football Club in the Australian Football League (AFL). From Ramco, South Australia, Ricciuto started as a junior with the local Waikerie Magpies Football Club. He joined the West Adelaide Football Club in the South Australian National Football League (SANFL), making his debut at the age of 16, before being recruited by Adelaide as a zone selection prior to the 1993 season.

Playing as a midfielder, he established himself in Adelaide&#x27;s side, receiving a nomination for the AFL Rising Star in 1993, his debut season, and being named in the All-Australian team the following season, the first of eight selections overall. Having played in Adelaide&#x27;s premiership side in 1998, also winning the Malcolm Blight Medal as the club&#x27;s best and fairest, Ricciuto replaced Mark Bickley as the club&#x27;s captain prior to the 2001 season.

Consistently considered one of the best midfielders in the competition during the early 2000s (decade), Ricciuto shared the 2003 Brownlow Medal with Nathan Buckley and Adam Goodes, and was selected in the All-Australian team for four consecutive seasons between 2002 and 2005, captaining the side in both 2004 and 2005. Having played more of a forward role in his last two seasons, Ricciuto retired at the end of the 2007 season, having played a total of 312 games for Adelaide, kicking 292 goals.

Also representing South Australia in interstate football and Australia in the International Rules Series, Ricciuto was inducted into the Australian Football Hall of Fame in 2011, and the South Australian Football Hall of Fame in 2012.

==AFL career==
===Early career (1993–1996)===
Ricciuto was born in Waikerie, South Australia. He was recruited by SANFL team West Adelaide and soon after – as a 16-year-old high schooler – was recruited by the Adelaide Crows in 1992. He debuted in the AFL in 1993. Ricciuto earned his first All-Australian selection as a 19-year-old in 1994.

===Rising career (1997–2001)===
After a stellar year in 1997 (in which he received his second All-Australian guernsey) he ended up missing the 1997 premiership due to a late season injury. Despite this setback, he rallied in 1998 to again be an All-Australian, win the club&#x27;s best and fairest, and play in his only premiership. He was appointed as the Adelaide captain in 2001.

===Career high (2002–2005)===
In 2003, he was joint winner of the league&#x27;s highest individual honor, the Brownlow Medal, with Collingwood&#x27;s Nathan Buckley and Sydney&#x27;s Adam Goodes. In 2004 he came second in the Brownlow medal. In 2004 and 2005 he earned his seventh and eighth All-Australian guernsey. However at the end of the 2005 season, Ricciuto was suspended following an incident in the Crows&#x27; final regular season match against West Coast; thus ruling him out of Brownlow Medal contention and the Crows&#x27; first qualifying final against fourth placed , hampering the Crows&#x27; attempts at a straight path to the preliminary final. Indeed, the Crows lost this match by just eight points, and ultimately the Crows finished one match short of the 2005 decider.

===Twilight career (2006–2007)===
Late in the 2006 season, Ricciuto was ruled out of the Crows&#x27; final few matches due to a &quot;mystery ailment&quot; which was later found to be parvovirus B19. Nevertheless, Ricciuto led the Crows to their second straight top-two finish in 2006 and thus a more direct path to the preliminary final, again against the West Coast Eagles where again the Crows finished one match short of the decider, losing the preliminary final by just 10 points.

Ricciuto played his 300th AFL game on 21 July 2006 against North Melbourne. He kicked 5 goals in a game that Adelaide won by 72 points. He was quicker than any other player in AFL history to this milestone, in 13 years and 83 days, some 11 days quicker than Carlton&#x27;s Craig Bradley.

===Retirement===
Ricciuto announced his retirement on 16 August 2007 due to persistent injuries. During his career, he amassed an incredible eight All-Australian selections, a record matched in the AFL era only by St Kilda&#x27;s Robert Harvey as well as Lance Franklin. Ricciuto was also twice named All-Australian captain in 2004 and 2005, joining Paul Kelly, Wayne Carey, and Michael Voss as the only multiple All-Australian Captains in the AFL era.

==Personal life==

Ricciuto is noted for his Italian heritage, and bears a large tattoo of his family name on his back. His grandfather was born in the small Italian town of Fragneto Monforte.

On 19 January 2008, Ricciuto married Sarah Delahunt. They have two daughters and four sons.

==Post AFL career==
In 2009, he played for Prince Alfred College Old Collegians in division 4 of the South Australian Amateur Football League.

Ricciuto played in the ANZAC day clash 2008 with Waikerie A grade against Loxton. Waikerie won the match by 38 points.

Ricciuto also played in the 2008 Riverland Grand Final with Waikerie against Renmark. In time on in the final quarter with not very much time left on the clock, Ricciuto kicked the 12th goal for Waikerie to seal back-to-back Premierships for Waikerie.

Ricciuto now works in the media is an AFL commentator for both Triple M and Fox Footy and also hosts the weekday Triple M breakfast show with former Australian world number 1 squash player Chris Dittmar and local media personality Laura O&#x27;Callaghan.

Ricciuto was inducted into the Australian Football Hall of Fame in 2011, and into the South Australian Football Hall of Fame in 2012.

In March 2014, a section of the Eastern Stand at Adelaide Oval was named after Ricciuto.

<doc id="463175" wikidata="Q5196962" url="?curid=463175" title="Cutthroat (pool)">
<text>Cutthroat or cut-throat, also sometimes referred to as three-man-screw, is a typically three-player or team pocket billiards game, played on a pool table, with a full standard set of pool balls (15 numbered s and a ); the game cannot be played with three or more players with an unnumbered reds-and-yellows ball set, as used in blackball. Each player is commonly assigned a set of five consecutively numbered object balls, though the number of balls will vary by number of players. The object of the game is to be the last player with at least one ball of their group remaining on the table.

The name &quot;cutthroat&quot; is not unique to pool, but is used to refer to other games played with three or more players in which all players must fend for themselves, e.g. cutthroat bridge and cutthroat American handball.

== Gameplay ==

When the fifteen balls for cutthroat, the 1 ball is placed on the and the 6 ball and 11 ball are placed on the other two corners of the billiards rack.

In cutthroat, there are (usually) three sets of balls. Balls 1–5 are called the &quot;low&quot; balls, the &quot;mid&quot; balls are 6–10, and the &quot;high&quot; balls are 11–15. Each of the three players will eventually &quot;own&quot; one of these sets of five balls. Winning is accomplished by legally () all of the other players&#x27; balls. Whether each shot must be is determined before the game.

Each set of five balls is initially unclaimed – the ball sets remain &quot;open&quot; until at least one ball from two sets have been pocketed. For example, if the breaking player pockets the 6 then the 9, that player definitely does not own the 6–10 group, but does not yet clearly own either 1–5 or 11–15. If the player had pocketed the 6 then the 2, the player would definitely be group 11–15. A foul break thus includes the possibility that the fouling breaker may eventually be assigned a group from which a ball was pocketed on the foul break shot. However, if there was a foul on the break, no set can be claimed and the table is still open, no matter what balls may have been pocketed.

A player&#x27;s turn continues so long as they legally pocket one or more object balls with each shot. A shooter can even knock in their own ball, allowing them to continue a turn in exchange for their now-weakened position. This circumstance is called &quot;cutting one&#x27;s own throat&quot;. If a player sinks their own last ball (intentionally or otherwise), they must sit out the rest of the game, except as noted below.

===Fouls===
A (knocking the cue ball into a pocket or off the table) is subject to special penalties, covered below, and results in the incoming player receiving .

The general rules of pocket billiards apply, including typical fouls, such as striking the cue ball twice on the same shot, striking an object ball instead of the cue ball with the cue stick, knocking an object ball off the table, etc. Such fouls end the shooter&#x27;s turn without further penalty. The incoming player does not have cue ball in-hand, but takes the table as it lies (after balls are spotted).

If a player pockets an opponent&#x27;s ball while committing a foul, the opponent may raise that ball from the pocket and put it back on the table. The raised ball is placed on the foot spot.

===Winning===
The object is to be the last player with at least one object ball left on the table. When a player has no balls on the table, they are said to be &quot;out&quot; (eliminated) and their turn is skipped in the player rotation. Under normal rules (where balls are retrieved on a scratch – see below), being &quot;out&quot; may be a temporary condition.

===Spotting===
The consequence of a (knocking the cue ball into a pocket or off the table) is that all of the shooter&#x27;s opponents are rewarded by taking one of their own balls out of a pocket (if any have been pocketed) and it back onto the table (with the next shooting player&#x27;s ball placed in front of the other&#x27;s ball). Thus, a player who is &quot;out&quot; returns to the game, with one of their balls back in play, when any then-surviving player scratches. If a scratch occurs after first pocketing an opponent&#x27;s ball on the same turn, still only one ball per opponent is returned to the table, as the penalty is intended not to nullify the effects of the scratch, but to punish the offender and reward the other players evenly.

In the uncommon case that the final shot leaves only the cue ball on the table (the shooting player has pocketed both the final opponent&#x27;s last ball the shooter&#x27;s own last ball), one ball of player will be spotted in their order of shooting. The shooting player continues unless the last shot was not made legally.

An object ball knocked off the table is spotted, unless it is the shooters own, in which case it is pocketed.

==Variations==

===Alternative group selection===
A common variation is that the first shooter to legally pocket a ball without a () gets to claim any set that they want to be their own. If the shooter pockets any ball (without fouling), they can claim any set, and continue shooting. The next shooter who legally pockets a ball during their turn gets to claims ownership of one of the two remaining sets. In the advent of a foul break, the first successive shooter to legally pocket a ball gets to claim any set, and the next shooter who legally pockets a ball claims one of the remaining sets.

A less common variation (because it involves risk to the breaker) is that the sets are assigned before the start of play: the breaking shooter has 1–5, the second player has 6–10, and the third has 11–15.

===Alternative scratch and spotting rules===
In the event of a cue-ball scratch, each of the fouling player&#x27;s opponents who were still in the game before the foul may return one of their own pocketed balls to the table. Players who were already &quot;out&quot; before that shot remain out.

In this version, if the shooter pockets both the last remaining opponent object ball and the shooter&#x27;s own final object ball (i.e. all balls are down but the cue ball), then only a player who was still in the game (typically the shooter and the final opponent) before that last shot may spot a ball; eliminated players do not return to the game. The same shooter continues.

Another variation (regardless of the above spotting rule) that is common in North America is that the incoming player after a scratch receives cue ball in-hand behind the () only, not in-hand anywhere on the table.

===More players===
Team play can be pairs (or more) of players being assigned to each of the three sets of balls and taking alternating turns or (in format) alternating shots during their turn.

The game generally is also playable by five players (or teams), with each owning three balls rather than five. Variant ball sets (with smaller and more numerous balls, and a custom rack for them) have also been manufactured for a larger number of players.

The game is possible with any number of players from two to 15. Because some combinations would result in not all of the players having the same number of balls, sometimes one or more must be taken out of the rack.

* Two players: seven balls each
* Three players: five balls each
* Four or five players: three balls each
* Six or seven players: two balls each
* Eight to 15 players: one ball each

Eagle Pool Balls manufactures a ball set using colored rather than numbered groups of balls, with which three- to five-player cutthroat can be played. It makes use of different sizes and shapes of racks: a standard triangle rack of three groups of five balls each for three players; a custom, large diamond rack of four groups of four balls each for four players; and a standard triangle rack of five groups of three balls each for five players.

===Multi-game scoring===
Various point systems may be used to play matches or sets, rather than just one game. With its uniqueness as a three player game, counting games won is possible but does not give credit for finishing second. One system is awarding three points for a win, plus an additional one point for each of the winner&#x27;s remaining balls at the end of each game. The player last eliminated receives two points, the first eliminated player none. There may also be a bonus awarded for playing a perfect game, sinking both opponents&#x27; sets of 5 balls while having all 5 of yours remaining (Usually 2 points, making a perfect game worth 10 points total: 3 for the win, 5 for remaining balls, plus 2 bonus). This system emphasizes strategy regarding whom to eliminate first as the match goes on, often creating alliances of the two trailing players to catch the leader in points. The match may be won by reaching a set number of points, or reaching a set deadline in time.

===Coin-operated table play===
When played on coin-operated tables (such that balls cannot be returned to play at will once pocketed, only after paying for another game) a player who scratches selects one of their own balls to be pocketed immediately, in lieu of opponents&#x27; balls returning to the table. In the event that a scratch occurs on the same shot that an opponent&#x27;s ball is pocketed, the affected opponent is permitted to select a ball belonging to the offender which is to be removed instead of the player that scratched choosing the ball to be pocketed. In either case, this can result in the scratching player being &quot;out&quot;.

<text>The Fieseler Fi 5 (previously F5) was a single-engined two-seat sportplane of the 1930s. It was produced by the German aircraft manufacturer Fieseler Flugzeugbau, which was started by the World War I fighter ace and German aerobatic star, Gerhard Fieseler.

==Design and development==
Gerhard worked at the company full-time after winning the first World Aeronautics Competition (Championship) of 1934 in his Fieseler F2 &quot;Tiger&quot;, having previously won the 1932 European Aerobatic Championship, and the F5 was among the company&#x27;s earliest big sellers. The F5 was powered by the Hirth HM 60 engine. It competed with the Klemm Kl 25, but with the F5&#x27;s shorter wings and different handling that experienced pilots preferred, it became quite popular.

The F 5 was a low-wing tandem two-seat monoplane which retained the fabric-covered steel-tube fuselage of the earlier Fieseler F 4 but introduced a new two-spar cantilever wing. It had a fixed conventional landing gear with a tail-skid and the tandem open-cockpit were fitted with dual-controls. Behind the rear seat was a large luggage locker, the top decking at the rear could be removed to carry a spare propeller or skis.

In 1935 one aircraft &quot;Saureland&quot; was modified as a single-seat aerobatic aircraft for Lise Fastenrath with the front cockpit covered over. Only one aircraft survived the Second World War, it was later fitted with an enclosed cabin but was written off in France in 1968.

==Variants==
;F 5
:Production aircraft with a Hirth HM.60 engine.
;F 5R
:Aircraft fitted with an uprated Hirth HM.60R engine.

<text>The Red Book of the Peoples of the Russian Empire () is a book about the small nations of the Russian Empire, the Soviet Union, and Russia and some other post-Soviet states of today. It was written by Margus Kolga, Igor Tõnurist, Lembit Vaba, and Jüri Viikberg. It was published in Estonian in 1991 and in English in 2001.

The foreword of the book explains the book&#x27;s approach by saying, &quot;the authors of the present book, who come from a country (Estonia) which has shared the fate of nations in the Russian and Soviet empires, endeavour to publicize the plight of the small nations whose very existence is threatened as a result of recent history.&quot;

==Described peoples==
The authors&#x27; intention for the book was to include the peoples according to the following criteria:

* are not yet extinct,
* whose main area of settlement is on ex-Soviet territory,
* whose numbers are below 30,000,

== Publications and reception ==
It was published in Estonian in 1991 and in English in 2001. Its publication was followed in 1993 by another book, &quot;Cultural Survival&quot;.

The Estonian newspaper &quot;Postimees&quot;, reviewing the English version, said the book did not &quot;offer any tangible solutions for the peoples who are suffering&quot;. The reviewer criticized the book for being published in haste, noting typographic mistakes and strange footnotes, though said the book was published with good intentions. &quot;Akadeemia&quot; said that though the book contained great work, the title of the Estonian work may be insulting to the peoples discussed in the volume, and carried a propagandist quality.

Writing in Library+Information Update, Peter Hoare called it a &quot;fascinating book, with much well-documented information about languages, ethnic origins, current cultural and political situations etc, presented in a standard and comprehensible format complete with maps.&quot;

<text>George Henry Sanders (3 July 1906 – 25 April 1972) was a British actor and singer whose career spanned over 40 years. His heavy, upper-class English accent and smooth bass voice often led him to be cast as sophisticated but villainous characters. He is remembered for his roles as wicked Jack Favell in &quot;Rebecca&quot; (1940), Scott ffolliott in &quot;Foreign Correspondent&quot; (1940, a rare heroic part), The Saran of Gaza in &quot;Samson and Delilah&quot; (1949, the most popular film of the year), theater critic Addison DeWitt in &quot;All About Eve&quot; (1950, for which he won an Oscar), Sir Brian De Bois-Guilbert in &quot;Ivanhoe&quot; (1952), King Richard the Lionheart in &quot;King Richard and the Crusaders&quot; (1954), Mr. Freeze in a two-part episode of &quot;Batman&quot; (1966), and the voice of Shere Khan in Disney&#x27;s &quot;The Jungle Book&quot; (1967). He also starred as Simon Templar, in 5 of the 8 films in &quot;The Saint&quot; series (1939–1941), and as a suave &quot;Saint&quot;-like crimefighter in the first 4 of the 16 The Falcon films (1941–1942).

==Early life==
Sanders was born on 3 July 1906 in Saint Petersburg, Russian Empire, at number 6 Petrovski Ostrov, to rope manufacturer Henry Sanders and horticulturist Margaret ( Kolbe), who was also born in Saint Petersburg, of mostly German, but also Estonian and Scottish ancestry. (Sanders wrote of his mother&#x27;s descent from &quot;the Thomas Clayhills of Dundee, who went to Estonia in 1626 to establish a business there&quot;.) Sanders referred to his parents as &quot;well-off&quot; and noted his mother&#x27;s &quot;forebears of solid social position and impeccable respectability&quot;, stating that &quot;to the best of (his) knowledge, (his) father came in the mail&quot;.

A biography published in 1990 alleged that family members&#x27; &quot;recent disclosures... indicate&quot; that Sanders&#x27; father was the out-of-wedlock son of a Russian noblewoman of the Tsar&#x27;s court, and a prince of the House of Oldenburg who was married to a sister of the Tsar. At the time of Henry Sanders&#x27;s birth, the Anglo-Russian Sanders family were living at Saint Petersburg; the mother, Dagmar, was a lady-in-waiting to the Dowager Empress, and it was said to be through this connection Henry came to be adopted by the Sanders family.

In 1917, at the outbreak of the Russian Revolution, Sanders and his family moved to Great Britain. Like his brother, he attended Bedales School and Brighton College, a boys&#x27; independent school in Brighton, then went on to Manchester Technical College, after which he worked in textile research.

Sanders travelled to South America, where he managed a tobacco plantation. The Depression sent him back to Britain. He worked at an advertising agency, where the company secretary, aspiring actress Greer Garson, suggested that he take up a career in acting.

==Career==
===Early British work===
Sanders learned how to sing and got a role on stage in &quot;Ballyhoo&quot;, which had only a short run, but helped establish him as an actor.

He began to work regularly on the British stage, appearing several times with Edna Best. He co-starred with Dennis King in &quot;The Command Performance&quot;.

Sanders travelled to New York to appear on Broadway in a production of Noël Coward&#x27;s &quot;Conversation Piece&quot; (1934), directed by Coward, which ran for only 55 performances.

===Hollywood and 20th Century-Fox===
20th Century-Fox was looking for an actor to play a villain in its Hollywood-made film &quot;Lloyd&#x27;s of London&quot; (1936). Sanders was duly cast as Lord Everett Stacy, opposite Tyrone Power, in one of his first leads, as the hero; Sanders&#x27; smooth, upper-class English accent, his sleek manner, and his suave, superior, and somewhat threatening air made him in demand for American films for years to come. &quot;Lloyd&#x27;s of London&quot; was a big hit, and in November 1936, Fox placed Sanders under a seven-year contract.

===Character roles===
Sanders returned to Hollywood, where RKO wanted him to play the hero in a series of B-movies, &quot;The Saint&quot;. &quot;The Saint in New York&quot; (1938) had already been made starring Louis Hayward in the title role, but when he decided not to return to the role, Sanders took over for &quot;The Saint Strikes Back&quot; (1939). In 1940, Sanders played Jack Favell in Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;Rebecca&quot;, opposite Laurence Olivier and Joan Fontaine.

===A-picture leading man===

Sanders was borrowed by United Artists to play the lead in &quot;The Moon and Sixpence&quot; (1942), based on the novel by W. Somerset Maugham.

RKO had canceled its &quot;Saint&quot; series and replaced it with &quot;The Falcon&quot; in 1941. George Sanders was assigned the leading role of Gay Laurence, debonair man about town always involved in murder cases. &quot;Saint&quot; author Leslie Charteris thought the resemblance between the Falcon and the Saint was obvious, and sued the studio for unfair competition. Sanders himself was also unhappy about playing still another screen sleuth in still more &quot;B&quot; pictures, and bowed out of the series in 1942 after only four films. (He was replaced by his elder brother, Tom Conway.)

In July 1942, Fox suspended Sanders for refusing the lead in &quot;The Undying Monster&quot; (1942). &quot;I like to be seen in pictures that at least seem to be slightly worthwhile.&quot; In September, he was again suspended for refusing an &quot;unsympathetic role&quot; in &quot;The Immortal Sergeant&quot; (he was replaced by Morton Lowry). In November 1942, Fox and Sanders came to terms, with the studio offering him a raise in pay and the lead in a film, &quot;School for Saboteurs&quot;, which became &quot;They Came to Blow Up America&quot;.

RKO called him back for &quot;This Land Is Mine&quot; (1943). They bought an original story for him, &quot;Nine Lives&quot;, but the film was never made. He was lent to Columbia Pictures for &quot;Appointment in Berlin&quot; (1943).

In February 1943, Fox announced it was developing three film projects for Sanders – &quot;The Porcelain Lady&quot;, a murder mystery, plus biopics of Charles Howard, 20th Earl of Suffolk and a hero of World War II, and Canadian physician Norman Bethune. Fox originally announced that he would play the detective in &quot;Laura&quot; (1944) alongside Laird Cregar, but neither ended up being in the final film. In 1947, Sanders portrayed King Charles II in Fox&#x27;s lavish production of the scandalous historical bodice-ripper, &quot;Forever Amber&quot;.

Sanders signed a new three-film contract with RKO, starting with &quot;Action in Arabia&quot; (1944). Superficially, the film looked expensive but it was actually a low-budget feature, embellished by spectacular location footage filmed in 1933 for an unfinished production about Lawrence of Arabia.

===&quot;All About Eve&quot; and beyond===

For his role as the acerbic, cold-blooded theatre critic Addison DeWitt in &quot;All About Eve&quot; (1950), Sanders won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor.

Sanders was leading man in &quot;Black Jack&quot; (1950), but was back to supporting-villain roles in &quot;I Can Get It for You Wholesale&quot; (1951). He signed a three-picture deal with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer where he appeared in &quot;The Light Touch&quot; (1951) and &quot;Ivanhoe&quot; (1952), playing Sir Brian de Bois-Guilbert, dying in a duel with Robert Taylor after professing his love for Jewish maiden Rebecca, played by Elizabeth Taylor. It was a huge success.

Sanders went to Italy to appear opposite Ingrid Bergman in &quot;Journey to Italy&quot; (1954). Back in Hollywood, he made several films for MGM: &quot;Jupiter&#x27;s Darling&quot; (1955), &quot;Moonfleet&quot; (1955), &quot;The Scarlet Coat&quot; (1955), and &quot;The King&#x27;s Thief&quot; (1955) (again as Charles II).

In 1955, Sanders was announced as hosting and occasionally appearing in &quot;The Ringmaster&quot;, a TV series about the circus.

Sanders played the lead in &quot;Death of a Scoundrel&quot; (1956) and the TV series &quot;The George Sanders Mystery Theater&quot; (1957).

He worked one last time with Power on &quot;Solomon and Sheba&quot; (1959); Power died suddenly during filming and was replaced by Yul Brynner.

In 1961, he appeared in &quot;The Rebel&quot; with Tony Hancock before being top-billed in &quot;Cairo&quot; (1963), then appeared in &quot;The Cracksman&quot; (1963), &quot;Dark Purpose&quot; (1964), and &quot;The Golden Head&quot; (1964). Peter Sellers and Sanders appeared together in &quot;The Pink Panther&quot; sequel &quot;A Shot in the Dark&quot; (1964). Sanders had earlier inspired Sellers&#x27;s character Hercules Grytpype-Thynne in the BBC radio comedy series &quot;The Goon Show&quot; (1951–60).

In 1966, Sanders declared bankruptcy due to some poor investments.

Sanders was cast in the musical comedy, &quot;Sherry!&quot;, but withdrew from the show while it was out-of-town. He was replaced by Clive Revill for Broadway.

===Final films===
Sanders appeared briefly in the espionage thriller, &quot;The Quiller Memorandum&quot; (1966), and crime-thriller, &quot;Warning Shot&quot; (1967). He followed those up by voicing the bengal tiger, Shere Khan, in Disney&#x27;s animated hit film, &quot;The Jungle Book&quot; (1967). (The penultimate film Walt Disney was personally involved with; released posthumously.) He was featured in a quadruple role in the Sonny &amp; Cher vehicle, &quot;Good Times&quot; (1967), William Friedkin&#x27;s debut film; followed by an eclectic variety of low-budget films, such as &quot;The Candy Man&quot; (1969) and the campy &quot;The Girl from Rio&quot; (1969).

In 1969, Sanders announced his retirement from acting. He had a major supporting role in John Huston&#x27;s &quot;The Kremlin Letter&quot; (1970), in which his first scene showed him dressed in drag and playing the piano in a gay bar in San Francisco. He also obtained supporting roles in &quot;Doomwatch&quot; (1972) and &quot;Endless Night&quot; (1972), the latter being an adaptation of Agatha Christie&#x27;s novel of the same name. He received top-billing for his final film, &quot;Psychomania&quot; (1973), released posthumously.

===Novels===
Two ghostwritten crime novels were published under his name to cash in on his fame at the height of his wartime film series. The first was &quot;Crime on My Hands&quot; (1944), written in the first person, and mentioning his Saint and Falcon films.

===Singing===

During the production of &quot;The Jungle Book&quot;, Sanders was unavailable to provide the singing voice for his character Shere Khan during the final recording of the song, &quot;That&#x27;s What Friends Are For&quot;. According to Richard Sherman, Bill Lee, a member of The Mellomen, was called in to substitute for Sanders.

==Personal life==
On 27 October 1940, Sanders married Susan Larson (born Elsie Poole). The couple divorced in 1949. From later that year until 1954, Sanders was married to Zsa Zsa Gabor, with whom he starred in the film &quot;Death of a Scoundrel&quot; (1956). On 10 February 1959, Sanders married Benita Hume, widow of Ronald Colman. She died of bone cancer in 1967, aged 60, the same year that Sanders&#x27;s brother Tom Conway died of liver failure. Sanders had become distant from his brother because of Conway&#x27;s drinking problem.

Sanders&#x27; autobiography &quot;Memoirs of a Professional Cad&quot; was published in 1960 and gained critical praise for its wit. Sanders suggested the title &quot;A Dreadful Man&quot; for his biography, later written by his friend Brian Aherne and published in 1979. Sanders&#x27; fourth and final marriage on 4 December 1970 was to Magda Gabor, the elder sister of his second wife. This marriage lasted 32 days ending in an annulment.

==Final years and death==

By the late 1960s, Sanders had become increasingly reclusive and suffered from depression due to a string of personal tragedies, including the deaths of his third wife, his mother and his brother Tom, all within the span of a year. This was followed by a failed investment, which cost him millions of dollars. In December 1970, he married for the fourth time, to Magda Gabor; the marriage was annulled 32 days later. According to Aherne&#x27;s biography, he also had a minor stroke. Sanders could not bear the prospect of losing his health or needing help to carry out everyday tasks, and became severely depressed. After discovering that he could no longer play his grand piano, he dragged it outside and smashed it with an axe. His last girlfriend, Lorraine Chanel, with whom he had an on-off relationship in the last four years of his life, persuaded him to sell his beloved house in Majorca, Spain, which he later bitterly regretted. From then on, he drifted.

On 23 April 1972, Sanders checked into a hotel in Castelldefels, a coastal town near Barcelona, where he phoned his friend George Mikell. Two days after swallowing the contents of five bottles of the barbiturate Nembutal, he died from cardiac arrest. He left behind two suicide notes, one of which read:

David Niven wrote in &quot;Bring on the Empty Horses&quot; (1975), the second volume of his memoirs, that in 1937, his friend George Sanders had predicted that he would commit suicide from a barbiturate overdose when he was 65, and that in his 50s, he had appeared to be depressed because his marriages had failed and several tragedies had befallen him.

Sanders has two stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, for films at 1636 Vine Street and television at 7007 Hollywood Boulevard.

<text>Sprengel Museum is a museum of modern art in Hanover, Lower Saxony, holding one of the most significant collections of modern art in Germany. It is located in a building situated adjacent to the Masch Lake () approximately south of the state museum. The museum opened in , and the building, designed by Peter and Ursula Trint (of Cologne) and Dieter Quast (of Heidelberg), was extended in 1992.

Bernhard Sprengel donated his extensive collection of modern art to the city of Hanover in 1969, as well as financially supporting the construction of the museum. The city of Hanover and the state of Lower Saxony agreed to operate the museum jointly. In addition to the works donated by Sprengel, the museum also houses 20th century artworks owned by Lower Saxony and Hanover.

==Expansion==
A further expansion, designed by Zürich-based architects Meili + Peter, was originally planned for 2010 but The cuboid design of the new building was chosen from 65 entrants in an international architecture competition. The original plan would have created an extra of exhibition space, and was expected to cost around €25million, with €10M coming from Lower Saxony&#x27;s EU funding, €5M directly from Lower Saxony, €5M from the city of Hanover, and €5M expected from donors. These estimates have since been reduced. A major objective of the expansion is to allow extensive coverage of Niki de Saint Phalle and the Hanoverian artist Kurt Schwitters. The new building will also be used for one-off international exhibitions.

==Works==
Besides Schwitters and de Saint Phalle, the Sprengel Museums&#x27;s key works include those of Max Ernst, Fernand Léger, Paul Klee, Pablo Picasso, Emil Nolde, and Max Beckmann from before 1945.

It also has a monument depicting the crimes of serial killer Fritz Haarmann. 

In 1988, the museum inherited the estate of the artists and married couple Robert Michel and Ella Bergmann-Michel. The museum publishes a printed inventory of this estate, of which two volumes have so far been published. Since 1993, the Sprengel Museum has contained the Kurt Schwitters Archive, of which the Merz Room is particularly notable. In 2000, Niki de Saint Phalle became an honorary citizen of Hanover and subsequently donated 300 of her works to the museum.

== Restitution of Nazi-looted art ==
in June 2000, the museum voted to return the Lovis Corinth painting &quot;The Walchensee on St John&#x27;s eve&quot; () to the heirs of Gustav Kirstein and his wife Therese Clara Stein, who were persecuted by Nazis because of their Jewish heritage.

<doc id="463198" wikidata="Q7737386" url="?curid=463198" title="The Gospel of Wealth">
<text>&quot;Wealth&quot;, more commonly known as &quot;The Gospel of Wealth&quot;, is an essay written by Andrew Carnegie in June of 1889 that describes the responsibility of philanthropy by the new upper class of self-made rich. The article was published in the &quot;North American Review&quot;, an opinion magazine for America&#x27;s establishment. It was later published as &quot;The Gospel of Wealth&quot; in &quot;The Pall Mall Gazette&quot;.

Carnegie proposed that the best way of dealing with the new phenomenon of wealth inequality was for the wealthy to utilize their surplus means in a responsible and thoughtful manner (similar to the concept of &quot;noblesse oblige&quot;). This approach was contrasted with traditional bequest (patrimony), where wealth is handed down to heirs, and other forms of bequest e.g. where wealth is willed to the state for public purposes. Benjamin Soskis, a historian of philanthropy, refers to the article as the &#x27;urtext&#x27; of modern philanthropy.

Carnegie argued that surplus wealth is put to best use (i.e. produces the greatest net benefit to society) when it is administered carefully by the wealthy. Carnegie also argues against wasteful use of capital in the form of extravagance, irresponsible spending, or self-indulgence, instead promoting the administration of this capital over the course of one&#x27;s lifetime toward the cause of reducing the stratification between the rich and poor. As a result, the wealthy should administer their riches responsibly and not in a way that encourages &quot;the slothful, the drunken, the unworthy&quot;.

At the age of 35, Carnegie decided to limit his personal wealth and donate the surplus to benevolent causes. He was determined to be remembered for his good deeds rather than his wealth. He became a &quot;radical&quot; philanthropist. Prior to publishing his ideas about wealth, he began donating to his favorite causes, starting by donating a public bath to his hometown of Dunfermline. As Carnegie tried to live his life in such a way that the poor could benefit from his wealth, he decided he needed to share his ideas with the public.

== Assertions ==

The Gospel of Wealth asserts that hard work and perseverance lead to wealth.

Carnegie based his philosophy on the observation that the heirs of large fortunes frequently squandered them in riotous living rather than nurturing and growing them. Even bequeathing one&#x27;s fortune to charity was no guarantee that it would be used wisely, due to the fact that there was no guarantee that a charitable organization not under one&#x27;s direction would use the money in accordance with one&#x27;s wishes. Carnegie disapproved of charitable giving that maintained the poor in their impoverished state, and urged a movement toward the creation of a new mode of giving that would create opportunities for the beneficiaries of the gift to better themselves. As a result, the gift would not be simply consumed, but would be productive of even greater wealth throughout the house.

In &quot;The Gospel of Wealth&quot;, Carnegie examines the modes of distributing accumulated wealth and capital to the communities from which they originate. He preached that ostentatious living and amassing private treasures were wrong. He praised the high British taxes on the estates of dead millionaires, remarking that &quot;By taxing estates heavily at death the State marks its condemnation of the selfish millionaire&#x27;s unworthy life. It is desirable that nations should go much further in this direction.&quot;

Carnegie made it clear that the duty of the rich was to live modest lifestyles, and that any surplus of money they had was best suited for re-circulation back into society where it could be used to support the greater good. He shunned aristocratic chains of inheritance and argued that dependents should be supported by their work with major moderation, with the bulk of excess wealth to be spent on enriching the community. In cases where excess wealth was held until death, he advocated its apprehension by the state on a progressive scale: &quot;Indeed, it is difficult to set bounds to the share of a rich man&#x27;s estates which should go at his death to the public through the agency of the State, and by all means such taxes should be granted, beginning at nothing upon moderate sums to dependents, and increasing rapidly as the amounts swell, until of the millionaire&#x27;s hoard, at least the other half comes to the privy coffer of the State.&quot;

== Reception ==
When Carnegie Steel busted the union in 1892, Carnegie was able to keep himself from blame because he focused on his new doctrine for the wealthy. The Homestead Strike ended in a showdown between 300 Pinkerton guards and a crowd of steel workers and supporters devolved into an exchange of gunfire. This outbreak left seven workers and three guards dead, and many more wounded. It made headlines around the world, and reporters reached Carnegie, who was in Scotland at the time. When questioned, Carnegie called the violence &quot;deplorable&quot; but otherwise pleaded ignorance and stated, &quot;I have given up all active control of the business.&quot; Subsequently he began to focus on his philanthropic work and teaching the Gospel of Wealth. Largely as a result of his philanthropic work, the Homestead Strike did little to mar his reputation.

Carnegie&#x27;s controversial views on wealth sparked a trans-Atlantic debate that argued the nature, purpose, and disposition of wealth.

=== William Ewart Gladstone ===
William Ewart Gladstone, the head of the Liberal Party in England, and a friend of Carnegie&#x27;s, had some sharp remarks on the publication. Even though they were close friends and had similar political ideals, Gladstone did not agree with Carnegie&#x27;s paper. Gladstone defended primogeniture, unlimited inheritance, and the British Aristocracy. This led to many other critics joining Gladstone in denouncing Carnegie&#x27;s &quot;radical&quot; philanthropic ways.

These critical reviews led Carnegie to publish a series of essays defending himself. He defended individualism, private property, and the accumulation of personal wealth on the grounds that they benefited the human race in the long run. In an effort to convince his critics that he wasn&#x27;t saying everyone should get free handouts from the upper class, he edited his original doctrine, so that it read &quot;Help those who will help themselves, to provide part of the means by which those who desire to improve may do so.&quot; Since many interpreted his writing to mean that all those in poverty should be assisted by the wealthy, it was necessary for Carnegie to clarify that charity has its limitations.

=== Phoebe Apperson Hearst&#x27;s &quot;Gospel of Wealth&quot; ===
In 1901, U.S. Senator Jonathan Prentiss Dolliver wrote an article for the celebrity magazine &quot;Success&quot;, titled &quot;Phoebe Apperson Hearst and the New Gospel of Wealth&quot;. Hearst was an American philanthropist and suffragist. According to Dolliver, Hearst saw inadequacies of public schools and was concerned about urban poverty and vice. She, like Carnegie, believed that as a millionairess, it was her duty to help those less fortunate. The purpose of Dolliver&#x27;s article was to explain Hearst&#x27;s &quot;Gospel of Wealth&quot; and illustrate how she should be viewed as a complementary equal to men like Carnegie. She declared that women who were wealthy had a sacred and moral duty to give away their fortunes to causes, especially progressive education and reform, to benefit their communities. Like Carnegie, Hearst was very concerned with giving the lower class the opportunity to be educated at the same level at which the upper class was educated. Also like Carnegie, she established her own free public library. Hers was located in Anaconda, Montana.

== Impact on philanthropy ==

The article launched the modern philanthropic movement. Carnegie put his philosophy into practice through a program of donations to endow public libraries, known as &#x27;Carnegie libraries&#x27; in cities and towns throughout the United States and the English-speaking world, with the idea that he was thus providing people with the tools to better themselves. He stipulated that the municipality must pass an ordinance establishing a tax to support the library&#x27;s ongoing operating costs after the initial grant provided the costs for building and equipping the library. Each of these organizations had its own endowment and its own board of trustees. Many of them still exist today.

After several communities used their grants on extravagant buildings, Carnegie established a system of architectural guidelines that mandated simplicity and functionality. He established the Carnegie Corporation to continue his program of giving after his death.

<doc id="463210" wikidata="Q2737036" url="?curid=463210" title="Laws of Cricket">
<text>The Laws of Cricket is a code that specifies the rules of the game of cricket worldwide. The earliest known code was drafted in 1744. Since 1788, the code has been owned and maintained by the private Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) in Lord&#x27;s Cricket Ground, London. There are currently 42 Laws (always written with a capital &quot;L&quot;), which describe all aspects of how the game is to be played. MCC has re-coded the Laws six times, each with interim revisions that produce more than one edition. The most recent code, the seventh, was released in October 2017; its 3rd edition came into force on 1 October 2022. 

Formerly cricket&#x27;s official governing body, the MCC has handed that role to the International Cricket Council (ICC). But MCC retains copyright of the Laws and remains the only body that may change them, although usually this is only done after close consultation with the ICC and other interested parties such as the Association of Cricket Umpires and Scorers. 

Cricket is one of the few sports in which the governing principles are referred to as &quot;Laws&quot; rather than as &quot;rules&quot; or &quot;regulations&quot;. In certain cases, however, regulations to supplement and/or vary the Laws may be agreed for particular competitions as required. Those applying to international matches (referred to as &quot;playing conditions&quot;) can be found on the ICC&#x27;s website.

==History==
===Oral tradition===
The origin of cricket is uncertain and it was first definitely recorded at Guildford in the 16th century. It is believed to have been a boys&#x27; game at that time but, from early in the 17th century, it was increasingly played by adults. Rules as such existed and, in early times, would have been agreed orally and subject to local variations. Cricket in the late 17th century became a betting game attracting high stakes and there were instances of teams being sued for non-payment of wagers they had lost.

===Articles of Agreement===
In July and August 1727, two matches were organised by stakeholders Charles Lennox, 2nd Duke of Richmond and Alan Brodrick, 2nd Viscount Midleton. References to these games confirm that they drew up Articles of Agreement between them to determine the rules that must apply in their contests. The original handwritten articles document drawn up by Richmond and Brodrick has been preserved. It is among papers which the West Sussex Record Office (WSRO) acquired from Goodwood House in 1884.

This is the first time that rules are known to have been formally agreed, their purpose being to resolve any problems between the patrons during their matches. The concept, however, was to attain greater importance in terms of defining rules of play as, eventually, these were codified as the &quot;Laws of Cricket&quot;. The Articles are a list of 16 points, many of which are easily recognised despite their wording as belonging to the modern &quot;Laws of Cricket&quot;, for example: (a) a Ball caught, the Striker is out; (b) when a Ball is caught out, the Stroke counts nothing; (c) catching out behind the Wicket allowed.

Points that differ from the modern Laws (use of &quot;italics&quot; is to highlight the differences only): (a) the wickets shall be pitched at &quot;twenty three yards&quot; distance from each other; (b) that &quot;twelve&quot; Gamesters shall play on each side; (c) the Batt Men for every one they count are to &quot;touch the Umpire&#x27;s Stick&quot;; (d) no Player shall be deemed out by any Wicket put down, &quot;unless with the Ball in Hand&quot;. In modern cricket: (a) the pitch is 22 yards long; (b) the teams are eleven-a-side; (c) runs were only completed if the batsman touched the umpire&#x27;s stick (which was probably a bat) and this practice was eventually replaced by the batsman having to touch the ground behind the popping crease; (d) run outs no longer require the ball to be in hand.

===1744 code===
The earliest known code of Laws was enacted in 1744 but not actually printed, so far as it is known, until 1755. They were possibly an upgrade of an earlier code and the intention must have been to establish a universal codification. The Laws were drawn up by the &quot;noblemen and gentlemen members of the London Cricket Club&quot;, which was based at the Artillery Ground, although the printed version in 1755 states that &quot;several cricket clubs&quot; were involved, having met at the &quot;Star and Garter&quot; in Pall Mall.

A summary of the main points:

* there is reference to the toss of a coin and the pitch dimensions, with a length of ;
* the stumps must be high with a six-inch (152 mm) bail;
* the ball must weigh between ;
* overs last four balls;
* the no ball is the penalty for overstepping, which means the hind foot going in front of the bowling crease (i.e., in direct line of the wicket);
* the popping crease is exactly before the bowling crease;
* various means of &quot;it is out&quot; are included;
* hitting the ball twice and obstructing the field are emphatically out following experiences in the 17th century;
* the wicket-keeper is required to be still and quiet until the ball is bowled;
* umpires must allow two minutes for a new batsman to arrive and ten minutes between innings (meal and rain breaks presumably excepted);
* the umpire cannot give a batsman out if the fielders do not appeal;
* the umpire is allowed a certain amount of discretion and it is made clear that the umpire is the &quot;sole judge&quot; and that &quot;his determination shall be absolute&quot;

The 1744 Laws do not say the bowler must roll (or skim) the ball and there is no mention of prescribed arm action so, in theory, a pitched delivery would have been legal, though potentially controversial. Underarm pitching is believed to have begun in the early 1760s when the Hambledon Club was rising to prominence. The modern straight bat was introduced as a consequence, replacing the old &quot;hockey stick&quot; bat which was good for hitting a ball on the ground but not for addressing a ball on the bounce.

In 1771, an incident on the field of play led to the creation of a new Law which remains extant. In a match between Chertsey and Hambledon at Laleham Burway, the Chertsey all-rounder Thomas White used a bat that was the width of the wicket. There was no rule in place to prevent this action and so all the Hambledon players could do was register a formal protest which was signed by Thomas Brett, Richard Nyren and John Small, the three leading Hambledon players. As a result, it was decided by the game&#x27;s lawmakers that the maximum width of the bat must be four and one quarter inches; this was included in the next revision of the Laws and it remains the maximum width.

===1774 code===

On Friday, 25 February 1774, the Laws were revised by a committee meeting at the &quot;Star and Garter&quot;. Chaired by Sir William Draper, the members included prominent cricket patrons the 3rd Duke of Dorset, the 4th Earl of Tankerville, Charles Powlett, Philip Dehany and Sir Horatio Mann. The clubs and counties represented were Kent, Hampshire, Surrey, Sussex, Middlesex and London.

A summary of the main points added in the 1774 code:
* the bat must not exceed in the widest part;
* the bowler must deliver the ball with one foot behind the bowling-crease, and within the return-crease; and shall Bowl four balls before he changes wickets, which he shall do but once in the same innings;
* the striker is out if he puts his leg before the wicket with a design to stop the ball, and actually prevent the ball from hitting his wicket.

The main innovation was the introduction of leg before wicket (lbw) as a means of dismissal. The practice of stopping the ball with the leg had arisen as a negative response to the pitched delivery. As in 1744, there is nothing about the bowler&#x27;s delivery action. The maximum width of the bat was confirmed following the incident in 1771.

As in 1744, the 1774 code asserted that &quot;the stumps must be twenty-two inches, the bail six inches long&quot;. There were only two stumps then, with a single bail. At the Artillery Ground on 22–23 May 1775, a lucrative single wicket match was played between Five of Kent (with Lumpy Stevens) and Five of Hambledon (with Thomas White). Kent batted first and made 37 to which Hambledon replied with 92, including 75 by John Small. In their second innings, Kent scored 102, leaving Hambledon a target of 48 to win. Small batted last of the Hambledon Five and needed 14 more to win when he went in. He duly scored the runs and Hambledon won by 1 wicket but a great controversy arose afterwards because, three times in the course of his second innings, Small was beaten by Lumpy only for the ball to pass through the two-stump wicket each time without hitting the stumps or the bail. As a result of Lumpy&#x27;s protests, the middle stump was introduced, although it was some years before its use became universal.

===1788 code===
MCC was founded in 1787 and immediately assumed responsibility for the Laws, issuing a new version on 30 May 1788 which was called &quot;The LAWS of the NOBLE GAME of CRICKET as revised by the Club at St. Mary-le-bone&quot;. The third Law stated: &quot;The stumps must be twenty-two inches out of the ground, the bail six inches in length&quot;. These were the overall dimensions and the requirement for a third stump was unspecified, indicating that its use was still not universal.

The 1788 code is much more detailed and descriptive than the 1774 code but, fundamentally, they are largely the same. The main difference was in the wording of the lbw Law. In 1774, this said that the batsman is out if, &quot;with design&quot;, he prevents the ball hitting the wicket with his leg. In 1788, the &quot;with design&quot; clause was omitted and a new clause was introduced that the ball must have pitched straight. Also in 1788, protection of the pitch was first included in the Laws. By mutual consent between the teams, the pitch could be rolled, watered, covered and mown during a match and the use of sawdust was authorised. Previously, pitches were left untouched during a match.

===Later MCC codes===
MCC has revised the Laws periodically, usually within the same code, but at times they have decided to publish an entirely new code:
* 19 May 1835 (1835 code)
* 21 April 1884 (1884 code)
* 7 May 1947 (1947 code)
* 21 November 1979 (1980 code)
* 3 May 2000 (2000 code)
* 1 October 2017 (2017 code). This included gender-neutral language (except that the word &quot;batsman&quot; was retained), and a code of conduct.

===Significant changes to the Laws since 1788===
Changes to the Laws did not always coincide with the publication of a new code and some of the most important changes were introduced as revisions to the current code and, therefore, each code has more than one version.
* The 46 inches between the popping and bowling creases, specified in 1744, was increased to 48 inches in 1819.
* The length of the bowling crease, specified as three feet either side of the wicket, was increased to four feet each side in 1902 (i.e., eight feet eight inches in total). After the width of the wicket was increased from eight to nine inches in 1939, the bowling crease was by default reduced in length by half an inch on each side.
* The creases were originally cut into the turf. Whitewash was not introduced until the second half of the 19th century, following a suggestion made by Alfred Shaw.
* Pitch protection was authorised from 1788 and a number of changes to this Law have been made including the length of time that rolling was permitted, covering of the bowler&#x27;s footholds, etc.
* The dimensions of the wicket changed several times until the current 28 inches by nine inches was agreed in 1931 and confirmed in 1947. At the end of the 17th century, the two-stump wicket then in use is believed by some to have been 22 inches high by six inches wide.
* The width of the bat has been unchanged at four and a quarter inches since the 1771 incident and the length was specified as the current 38 inches in 1835.
* The weight of the ball is unchanged since 1774. Its circumference was ruled as between nine and 9.25 inches in 1838; this was reduced to the current measure in 1927.
* There were four balls an over in 1744 and this did not change until 1889 when a five-ball over was introduced. In 1900, the over was increased to six balls. The over in Australia and some other countries has at times varied from the English but, from 1979, the six-ball over has been worldwide.
* The no ball was at first ruled for overstepping the bowling crease only. Legislation against &quot;throwing&quot; was first attempted in 1816 when roundarm was coming into use. It was ruled then that the bowler&#x27;s hand on delivery must not be above the elbow. In many matches, this rule was flagrantly disregarded and matters came to a head in 1827 with the roundarm trial matches. There was no control over bowling action until 1835 when it was ruled that the bowler&#x27;s hand on delivery must not be above his shoulder. In 1864, overarm bowling was authorised. The rule allowing either of the umpires to call a no ball was introduced in 1899. 
* Declarations were not authorised until 1889 and then &quot;only on the third day&quot;. In 1900, it was allowed after lunch on the second day; and in 1910 at any time on the second day. It was not until 1957 that a declaration on the first day was authorised.
* The follow on was largely unknown in the 18th century and the Laws did not address it until 1835 when it became compulsory after a deficit of 100 runs. The deficit changed a few times in the 19th century until, in 1900, the follow on became optional after a deficit of 150 runs, which remains the position for first-class matches other than Tests, in which the deficit is 200. 
* According to Gerald Brodribb: &quot;No dismissal has produced so much argument as lbw; it has caused trouble from its earliest days&quot;. First introduced in 1774, the main issue has always been the &quot;must pitch straight&quot; clause. It was changed to &quot;must be delivered straight&quot; in 1821 and then reverted in 1839. A campaign to have &quot;must pitch straight&quot; omitted began in 1901 but failed to gain the necessary majority at MCC. In 1937, the Law did change, following a two-year trial period, to allow dismissal after the ball pitched outside the off stump. After long and heated controversy about &quot;pad play&quot; over the next three decades, the Law was changed again in 1972 to penalise the batsman who had &quot;played no stroke&quot;. The revised wording was confirmed by inclusion in the 1980 code and remains part of the 2000 code.

==The Laws today==
Starting on 1 October 2017, the current version of the Laws are the &quot;Laws of Cricket 2017 Code&quot; which replaced the 6th Edition of the &quot;2000 Code of Laws&quot;. Custodianship of the Laws remains one of MCC&#x27;s most important roles. The ICC still relies on MCC to write and interpret the Laws, which are the responsibility of MCC&#x27;s Laws sub-committee. The process in MCC is that the sub-committee prepares a draft which is passed by the main committee. Certain levels of cricket, however, are subject to playing conditions which can differ from the Laws. At international level, playing conditions are implemented by the ICC; at domestic level by each country&#x27;s board of control.

The code of Laws consists of: 
* Preface; 
* Preamble to the Laws; 
* 42 Laws (see below);
* 5 Appendices, adding further definitions to the Laws;

Starting from the third edition of the 2017 version of the code, the term &quot;batter&quot; was substituted from the term &quot;batsman&quot;, to make the laws use gender-neutral terminology.

===Setting up the game===
The first 12 Laws cover the players and officials, basic equipment, pitch specifications and timings of play. These Laws are supplemented by Appendices B, C and D (see below).

&quot;Law 1: The players&quot;. A cricket team consists of eleven players, including a captain. Outside of official competitions, teams can agree to play more than eleven-a-side, though no more than eleven players may field.

&quot;Law 2: The umpires&quot;. There are two umpires, who apply the Laws, make all necessary decisions, and relay the decisions to the scorers. While not required under the Laws of Cricket, in higher level cricket a third umpire (located off the field, and available to assist the on-field umpires) may be used under the specific playing conditions of a particular match or tournament.

&quot;Law 3: The scorers&quot;. There are two scorers who respond to the umpires&#x27; signals and keep the score.
&quot;Law 4: The ball&quot;. A cricket ball is between 8.81 and 9 inches (22.4 cm and 22.9 cm) in circumference, and weighs between 5.5 and 5.75 ounces (155.9g and 163g) in men&#x27;s cricket. A slightly smaller and lighter ball is specified in women&#x27;s cricket, and slightly smaller and lighter again in junior cricket (Law 4.6). Only one ball is used at a time, unless it is lost, when it is replaced with a ball of similar wear. It is also replaced at the start of each innings, and may, at the request of the fielding side, be replaced with a new ball, after a minimum number of overs have been bowled as prescribed by the regulations under which the match is taking place (currently 80 in Test matches). The gradual degradation of the ball through the innings is an important aspect of the game.

&quot;Law 5: The bat&quot;. The bat is no more than in length, no more than wide, no more than deep at its middle and no deeper than at the edge. The hand or glove holding the bat is considered part of the bat. Ever since the ComBat incident, a highly publicised marketing attempt by Dennis Lillee, who brought out an aluminium bat during an international game, the Laws have provided that the blade of the bat must be made of wood.
&quot;Law 6: The pitch&quot;. The pitch is a rectangular area of the ground long and wide. The Ground Authority selects and prepares the pitch, but once the game has started, the umpires control what happens to the pitch. The umpires are also the arbiters of whether the pitch is fit for play, and if they deem it unfit, with the consent of both captains can change the pitch. Professional cricket is almost always played on a grass surface. However, in the event a non-turf pitch is used, the artificial surface must have a minimum length of and a minimum width of .

&quot;Law 7: The creases&quot;. This Law sets out the dimensions and locations of the creases. The bowling crease, which is the line the stumps are in the middle of, is drawn at each end of the pitch so that the three stumps at that end of the pitch fall on it (and consequently it is perpendicular to the imaginary line joining the centres of both middle stumps). Each bowling crease should be in length, centred on the middle stump at each end, and each bowling crease terminates at one of the return creases. The popping crease, which determines whether a batter is in his ground or not, and which is used in determining front-foot no-balls (see Law 21), is drawn at each end of the pitch in front of each of the two sets of stumps. The popping crease must be in front of and parallel to the bowling crease. Although it is considered to have unlimited length, the popping crease must be marked to at least on either side of the imaginary line joining the centres of the middle stumps. The return creases, which are the lines a bowler must be within when making a delivery, are drawn on each side of each set of the stumps, along each sides of the pitch (so there are four return creases in all, one on either side of both sets of stumps). The return creases lie perpendicular to the popping crease and the bowling crease, either side of and parallel to the imaginary line joining the centres of the two middle stumps. Each return crease terminates at one end at the popping crease but the other end is considered to be unlimited in length and must be marked to a minimum of from the popping crease. Diagrams setting out the crease markings can be found in Appendix C.
&quot;Law 8: The wickets&quot;. The wicket consists of three wooden stumps that are tall. The stumps are placed along the bowling crease with equal distances between each stump. They are positioned so that the wicket is wide. Two wooden bails are placed on top of the stumps. The bails must not project more than above the stumps, and must, for men&#x27;s cricket, be long. There are also specified lengths for the barrel and spigots of the bail. There are different specifications for the wickets and bails for junior cricket. The umpires may dispense with the bails if conditions are unfit (i.e. it is windy so they might fall off by themselves). Further details on the specifications of the wickets are contained in Appendix D to the Laws.

&quot;Law 9: Preparation and maintenance of the playing area&quot;. When a cricket ball is bowled it almost always bounces on the pitch, and the behaviour of the ball is greatly influenced by the condition of the pitch. As a consequence, detailed rules on the management of the pitch are necessary. This Law contains the rules governing how pitches should be prepared, mown, rolled, and maintained.

&quot;Law 10: Covering the pitch&quot;. The pitch is said to be &#x27;covered&#x27; when the groundsmen have placed covers on it to protect it against rain or dew. The Laws stipulate that the regulations on covering the pitch shall be agreed by both captains in advance. The decision concerning whether to cover the pitch greatly affects how the ball will react to the pitch surface, as a ball bounces differently on wet ground as compared to dry ground. The area beyond the pitch where a bowler runs so as to deliver the ball (the &#x27;run-up&#x27;) should ideally be kept dry so as to avoid injury through slipping and falling, and the Laws also require these to be covered wherever possible when there is wet weather.

&quot;Law 11: Intervals&quot;. There are intervals during each day&#x27;s play, a ten-minute interval between innings, and lunch, tea and drinks intervals. The timing and length of the intervals must be agreed before the match begins. There are also provisions for moving the intervals and interval lengths in certain situations, most notably the provision that if nine wickets are down, the lunch and tea interval are delayed to the earlier of the fall of the next wicket and 30 minutes elapsing. According to Law 11.8, a drinks interval &quot;shall be kept as short as possible and in any case shall not exceed 5 minutes.&quot;

&quot;Law 12: Start of play; cessation of play&quot;. Play after an interval commences with the umpire&#x27;s call of &quot;Play&quot;, and ceases at the end of a session with a call of &quot;Time&quot;. The last hour of a match must contain at least 20 overs, being extended in time so as to include 20 overs if necessary.

===Innings and result===

Laws 13 to 16 outline the structure of the game including how one team can beat the other.

&quot;Law 13: Innings&quot;. Before the game, the teams agree whether it is to be one or two innings for each side, and whether either or both innings are to be limited by time or by overs. In practice, these decisions are likely to be laid down by Competition Regulations, rather than pre-game agreement. In two-innings games, the sides bat alternately unless the follow-on (Law 14) is enforced. An innings is closed once ten batsmen are dismissed, no further batsmen are fit to play, the innings is declared or forfeited by the batting captain, or any agreed time or overs limit has expired. The captain winning the toss of a coin decides whether to bat or to bowl first.
&quot;Law 14: The follow-on&quot;. In a two-innings match, if the side batting second scores substantially fewer runs than the side which batted first, then the side that batted first can require their opponents to bat again immediately. The side that enforced the follow-on has the chance to win without batting again. For a game of five or more days, the side batting first must be at least 200 runs ahead to enforce the follow-on; for a three- or four-day game, 150 runs; for a two-day game, 100 runs; for a one-day game, 75 runs. The length of the game is determined by the number of scheduled days play left when the game actually begins.

&quot;Law 15: Declaration and forfeiture&quot;. The batting captain can declare an innings closed at any time when the ball is dead, and may also forfeit an innings before it has started.

&quot;Law 16: The result&quot;. The side which scores the most runs wins the match. If both sides score the same number of runs, the match is tied. However, the match may run out of time before the innings have all been completed; in this case, the match is drawn.

===Overs, scoring, dead ball and extras===

The Laws then move on to detail how runs can be scored.

&quot;Law 17: The over&quot;. An over consists of six balls bowled, excluding wides and no-balls. Consecutive overs are delivered from opposite ends of the pitch. A bowler may not bowl two consecutive overs.

&quot;Law 18: Scoring runs&quot;. Runs are scored when the two batsmen run to each other&#x27;s end of the pitch. Several runs can be scored from one ball.

&quot;Law 19: Boundaries&quot;. A boundary is marked around the edge of the field of play. If the ball is hit into or past this boundary, four runs are scored, or six runs if the ball does not hit the ground before crossing the boundary.

&quot;Law 20: Dead ball&quot;. The ball comes into play when the bowler begins his run-up, and becomes dead when all the action from that ball is over. Once the ball is dead, no runs can be scored and no batsmen can be dismissed. The ball becomes dead for a number of reasons, most commonly when a batter is dismissed, when a boundary is hit, or when the ball has finally settled with the bowler or wicketkeeper.

&quot;Law 21: No ball&quot;. A ball can be a no-ball for several reasons: if the bowler bowls from the wrong place; if he straightens his elbow during the delivery; if the bowling is dangerous; if the ball bounces more than once or rolls along the ground before reaching the batter; or if the fielders are standing in illegal places. A no-ball adds one run to the batting team&#x27;s score, in addition to any other runs which are scored off it, and the batter cannot be dismissed off a no-ball except by being run out, hitting the ball twice, or obstructing the field.

&quot;Law 22: Wide ball&quot;. An umpire calls a ball &quot;wide&quot; if, in his or her opinion, the ball is so wide of the batter and the wicket that he could not hit it with the bat playing a normal cricket shot. A wide adds one run to the batting team&#x27;s score, in addition to any other runs which are scored off it, and the batter cannot be dismissed off a wide except by being run out or stumped, by hitting his wicket, or obstructing the field.

&quot;Law 23: Bye and leg bye&quot;. If a ball that is not a wide passes the striker and runs are scored, they are called byes. If a ball hits the striker but not the bat and runs are scored, they are called leg-byes. However, leg-byes cannot be scored if the striker is neither attempting a stroke nor trying to avoid being hit. Byes and leg-byes are credited to the team&#x27;s but not the batter&#x27;s total.

=== Players, substitutes and practice ===
&quot;Law 24: Fielders&#x27; absence; Substitutes&quot;. In cricket, a substitute may be brought on for an injured fielder. However, a substitute may not bat, bowl or act as captain. The original player may return if he has recovered.

&quot;Law 25: Batter&#x27;s innings; Runners&quot; A batter who becomes unable to run may have a runner, who completes the runs while the batter continues batting. (The use of runners is not permitted in international cricket under the current playing conditions.) Alternatively, a batter may retire hurt or ill, and may return later to resume his innings if he recovers.

&quot;Law 26: Practice on the field&quot;. There may be no batting or bowling practice on the pitch during the match. Practice is permitted on the outfield during the intervals and before the day&#x27;s play starts and after the day&#x27;s play has ended. Bowlers may only practice bowling and have trial run-ups if the umpires are of the view that it would waste no time and does not damage the ball or the pitch.

&quot;Law 27: The wicket-keeper&quot;. The keeper is a designated player from the bowling side allowed to stand behind the stumps of the batter. They are the only fielder allowed to wear gloves and external leg guards.

&quot;Law 28: The fielder&quot;. A fielder is any of the eleven cricketers from the bowling side. Fielders are positioned to field the ball, to stop runs and boundaries, and to get batsmen out by catching or running them out.

===Appeals and dismissals===

Laws 29 to 31 cover the main mechanics of how a batter may be dismissed.

&quot;Law 29: The wicket is down&quot;. Several methods of dismissal occur when the wicket is put down. This means that the wicket is hit by the ball, or the batter, or the hand in which a fielder is holding the ball, and at least one bail is removed; if both bails have already been previously removed, one stump must be removed from the ground.

&quot;Law 30: Batter out of his/her ground&quot;. The batsmen can be run out or stumped if they are out of their ground. A batter is in his ground if any part of him or his bat is on the ground behind the popping crease, and the other batter was not already in that ground. If both batters are in the middle of the pitch when a wicket is put down, the batter closer to that end is out.

&quot;Law 31: Appeals&quot;. If the fielders believe a batter is out, they may ask the umpire &quot;How&#x27;s That?&quot; before the next ball is bowled. The umpire then decides whether the batter is out. Strictly speaking, the fielding side must appeal for all dismissals, including obvious ones such as bowled. However, a batter who is obviously out will normally leave the pitch without waiting for an appeal or a decision from the umpire.

Laws 32 to 40 discuss the various ways a batter may be dismissed. In addition to these 9 methods, a batter may retire out, which is covered in Law 25. Of these, caught is generally the most common, followed by bowled, leg before wicket, run out and stumped. The other forms of dismissal are very rare.

&quot;Law 32: Bowled&quot;. A batter is out if his wicket is put down by a ball delivered by the bowler. It is irrelevant whether the ball has touched the bat, glove, or any part of the batter before going on to put down the wicket, though it may not touch another player or an umpire before doing so.
&quot;Law 33: Caught&quot;. If a ball hits the bat or the hand holding the bat and is then caught by the opposition within the field of play before the ball bounces, then the batter is out.

&quot;Law 34: Hit the ball twice&quot;. If a batter hits the ball twice, other than for the sole purpose of protecting his wicket or with the consent of the opposition, he is out.

&quot;Law 35: Hit wicket&quot;. If, after the bowler has entered his delivery stride and while the ball is in play, a batter puts his wicket down by his bat or his body he is out. The striker is also out hit wicket if he puts his wicket down by his bat or his body in setting off for a first run. &quot;Body&quot; includes the clothes and equipment of the batter .

&quot;Law 36: Leg Before Wicket (LBW)&quot;. If the ball hits the batter without first hitting the bat, but would have hit the wicket if the batter was not there, and the ball does not pitch on the leg side of the wicket, the batter will be out. However, if the ball strikes the batter outside the line of the off-stump, and the batter was attempting to play a stroke, he is not out.

&quot;Law 37: Obstructing the field&quot;. If a batter willfully obstructs the opposition by word or action or strikes the ball with a hand not holding the bat, he is out. If the actions of the non-striker prevent a catch taking place, then the striker is out. &quot;Handled the Ball&quot; was previously a method of dismissal in its own right.

&quot;Law 38: Run out&quot;. A batter is out if at any time while the ball is in play no part of his bat or person is grounded behind the popping crease and his wicket is fairly put down by the opposing side.

&quot;Law 39: Stumped&quot;. A batter is out when the wicket-keeper (see Law 27) puts down the wicket, while the batter is out of his crease and not attempting a run.

&quot;Law 40: Timed out&quot;. An incoming batter must be ready to face a ball (or be at the crease with his partner ready to face a ball) within 3 minutes of the outgoing batter being dismissed, otherwise the incoming batter will be out.

===Unfair play===
&quot;Law 41: Unfair play&quot;. There are a number of restrictions to ensure fair play covering: changing the condition of the ball; distracting the batsmen; dangerous bowling; time-wasting; damaging the pitch. Some of these offences incur penalty runs, others can see warnings and then restrictions on the players.

&quot;Law 42: Players&#x27; conduct&quot;. The umpires shall penalise unacceptable conduct based on the severity of the actions. Serious misconduct can see a player sent from field; lesser offences, a warning and penalty runs.

<text>Boutonneuse fever (also called Mediterranean spotted fever, fièvre boutonneuse, Kenya tick typhus, Indian tick typhus, Marseilles fever, or Astrakhan fever) is a fever as a result of a rickettsial infection caused by the bacterium &quot;Rickettsia conorii&quot; and transmitted by the dog tick &quot;Rhipicephalus sanguineus&quot;. Boutonneuse fever can be seen in many places around the world, although it is endemic in countries surrounding the Mediterranean Sea. This disease was first described in Tunisia in 1910 by Conor and Bruch and was named &quot;boutonneuse&quot; (French for &quot;spotty&quot;) due to its papular skin-rash characteristics.

==Presentation==
After an incubation period around seven days, the disease manifests abruptly with chills, high fevers, muscular and articular pains, severe headache, and photophobia. The location of the bite forms a black, ulcerous crust (&quot;tache noire&quot;). Around the fourth day of the illness, a widespread rash appears, first macular and then maculopapular, and sometimes petechial.

==Diagnosis==
The diagnosis is made with serologic methods, either the classic Weil–Felix test, (agglutination of &quot;Proteus&quot; OX strains), ELISA, or immunofluorescence assays in the bioptic material of the primary lesion.
The Weil–Felix test demonstrated low sensitivity (33%) in diagnosing acute rickettsial infections and low specificity, with a positive titre of 1:320 seen in 54% of healthy volunteers and 62% of non-rickettsial fever patients. Therefore, the use of the WFT should be discouraged in the diagnosis of acute rickettsial infections.

==Treatment==
The illness can be treated with tetracyclines (doxycycline is the preferred treatment), chloramphenicol, macrolides, or fluoroquinolones.

<doc id="463225" wikidata="Q1142562" url="?curid=463225" title="Metric signature">
<text>In mathematics, the signature of a metric tensor &quot;g&quot; (or equivalently, a real quadratic form thought of as a real symmetric bilinear form on a finite-dimensional vector space) is the number (counted with multiplicity) of positive, negative and zero eigenvalues of the real symmetric matrix of the metric tensor with respect to a basis. In relativistic physics, &quot;v&quot; conventionally represents the number of time or virtual dimensions, and &quot;p&quot; the number of space or physical dimensions. Alternatively, it can be defined as the dimensions of a maximal positive and null subspace. By Sylvester&#x27;s law of inertia these numbers do not depend on the choice of basis and thus can be used to classify the metric. It is denoted by three integers , where v is the number of positive eigenvalues, p is the number of negative ones and r is the number of zero eigenvalues of the metric tensor. It can also be denoted implying &quot;r&quot; = 0, or as an explicit list of signs of eigenvalues such as or for the signatures and , respectively.

The signature is said to be indefinite or mixed if both &quot;v&quot; and &quot;p&quot; are nonzero, and degenerate if &quot;r&quot; is nonzero. A Riemannian metric is a metric with a positive definite signature . A Lorentzian metric is a metric with signature , or .

There is another notion of signature of a nondegenerate metric tensor given by a single number &quot;s&quot; defined as , where &quot;v&quot; and &quot;p&quot; are as above, which is equivalent to the above definition when the dimension &quot;n&quot; = &quot;v&quot; + &quot;p&quot; is given or implicit. For example, &quot;s&quot; = 1 − 3 = −2 for and its mirroring &quot;s&#x27; &quot; = −&quot;s&quot; = +2 for .

== Definition ==
The signature of a metric tensor is defined as the signature of the corresponding quadratic form. It is the number of positive, negative and zero eigenvalues of any matrix (i.e. in any basis for the underlying vector space) representing the form, counted with their algebraic multiplicities. Usually, is required, which is the same as saying a metric tensor must be nondegenerate, i.e. no nonzero vector is orthogonal to all vectors.

By Sylvester&#x27;s law of inertia, the numbers are basis independent.

== Properties ==

=== Signature and dimension ===
By the spectral theorem a symmetric matrix over the reals is always diagonalizable, and has therefore exactly &quot;n&quot; real eigenvalues (counted with algebraic multiplicity). Thus .

=== Sylvester&#x27;s law of inertia: independence of basis choice and existence of orthonormal basis ===
According to Sylvester&#x27;s law of inertia, the signature of the scalar product (a.k.a. real symmetric bilinear form), &quot;g&quot; does not depend on the choice of basis. Moreover, for every metric &quot;g&quot; of signature there exists a basis such that 
 for , for and otherwise. It follows that there exists an isometry if and only if the signatures of &quot;g&quot;1 and &quot;g&quot;2 are equal. Likewise the signature is equal for two congruent matrices and classifies a matrix up to congruency. Equivalently, the signature is constant on the orbits of the general linear group GL(&quot;V&quot;) on the space of symmetric rank 2 contravariant tensors &quot;S&quot;2&quot;V&quot;∗ and classifies each orbit.

===Geometrical interpretation of the indices ===
The number &quot;v&quot; (resp. &quot;p&quot;) is the maximal dimension of a vector subspace on which the scalar product &quot;g&quot; is positive-definite (resp. negative-definite), and &quot;r&quot; is the dimension of the radical of the scalar product &quot;g&quot; or the null subspace of symmetric matrix of the scalar product. Thus a nondegenerate scalar product has signature , with . A duality of the special cases correspond to two scalar eigenvalues which can be transformed into each other by the mirroring reciprocally.

== Examples ==

=== Matrices ===
The signature of the identity matrix is . The signature of a diagonal matrix is the number of positive, negative and zero numbers on its main diagonal.

The following matrices have both the same signature , therefore they are congruent because of Sylvester&#x27;s law of inertia:
:formula_1

=== Scalar products ===
The standard scalar product defined on formula_2 has the &quot;n&quot;-dimensional signatures , where and rank .

In physics, the Minkowski space is a spacetime manifold formula_3 with &quot;v&quot; = 1 and &quot;p&quot; = 3 bases, and has a scalar product defined by either the formula_4 matrix:
:formula_5
which has signature formula_6 and known as space-supremacy or space-like; or the mirroring signature formula_7, known as virtual-supremacy or time-like with the formula_8 matrix. 
:formula_9

== How to compute the signature ==
There are some methods for computing the signature of a matrix.
* For any nondegenerate symmetric matrix, diagonalize it (or find all of eigenvalues of it) and count the number of positive and negative signs.
* For a symmetric matrix, the characteristic polynomial will have all real roots whose signs may in some cases be completely determined by Descartes&#x27; rule of signs.
* Lagrange&#x27;s algorithm gives a way to compute an orthogonal basis, and thus compute a diagonal matrix congruent (thus, with the same signature) to the other one: the signature of a diagonal matrix is the number of positive, negative and zero elements on its diagonal.
* According to Jacobi&#x27;s criterion, a symmetric matrix is positive-definite if and only if all the determinants of its main minors are positive.

== Signature in physics ==
In mathematics, the usual convention for any Riemannian manifold is to use a positive-definite metric tensor (meaning that after diagonalization, elements on the diagonal are all positive).

In theoretical physics, spacetime is modeled by a pseudo-Riemannian manifold. The signature counts how many time-like or space-like characters are in the spacetime, in the sense defined by special relativity: as used in particle physics, the metric has an eigenvalue on the time-like subspace, and its mirroring eigenvalue on the space-like subspace.
In the specific case of the Minkowski metric,
: formula_10
the metric signature is formula_11 or (+, −, −, −) if its eigenvalue is defined in the time direction, or formula_6 or (−, +, +, +) if the eigenvalue is defined in the three spatial directions &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot; and &quot;z&quot;. 
(Sometimes the opposite sign convention is used, but with the one given here &quot;s&quot; directly measures proper time.)

==Signature change==
If a metric is regular everywhere then the signature of the metric is constant. However if one allows for metrics that are degenerate or discontinuous on some hypersurfaces, then signature of the metric may change at these surfaces. Such signature changing metrics may possibly have applications in cosmology and quantum gravity.

<doc id="463229" wikidata="Q1125994" url="?curid=463229" title="Congressional Progressive Caucus">
<text>The Congressional Progressive Caucus (CPC) is a congressional caucus affiliated with the Democratic Party in the United States Congress. The CPC represents the progressive faction of the Democratic Party. It was founded in 1991 and has grown since then, becoming the second-largest Democratic caucus in the House of Representatives.

As of July 19, 2024, the CPC has 98 members (95 voting representatives, one non-voting delegate, and one senator), making it the second-largest ideological caucus in the House Democratic Caucus by voting members, behind the New Democrat Coalition. The CPC is chaired by U.S. representative Greg Casar (D-TX). In addition, the CPC is affiliated with the Congressional Political Caucus PAC, a political action committee which is led by members of the caucus.

== History ==
The CPC was established in 1991 by U.S. representatives Ron Dellums (D-CA), Lane Evans (D-IL), Thomas Andrews (D-ME), Peter DeFazio (D-OR), Maxine Waters (D-CA) and Bernie Sanders (I-VT). Additional representatives joined soon thereafter, including Major Owens (D-NY), Nydia Velázquez (D-NY), David Bonior (D-MI), Bob Filner (D-CA), Barney Frank (D-MA), Maurice Hinchey (D-NY), Jim McDermott (D-WA), Jerry Nadler (D-NY), Patsy Mink (D-HI), George Miller (D-CA), Pete Stark (D-CA), John Olver (D-MA), Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), and Lynn Woolsey (D-CA). Sanders was the first CPC chairman.

The founding CPC members were concerned about the economic hardship imposed by the deepening recession and the growing inequality brought about by the timidity of the Democratic Party response in the early 1990s. On January 3, 1995, at a standing room only news conference on Capitol Hill, they were the first group inside Congress to chart a comprehensive legislative alternative to U.S. speaker Newt Gingrich and the Republican Contract with America. The CPC&#x27;s agenda was framed as &quot;The Progressive Promise: Fairness&quot;.

=== List of chairs ===


== Policy positions ==
The CPC advocates &quot;a universal, high-quality, Medicare for All health care system for all&quot;, living wage laws, reductions in military expenditure, a crackdown on corporate greed, putting an end to mass incarceration, supporting and implementing swift measures to start reversing climate change, immigration policies that are humane, and reparations.

===Economy===
In April 2011, the CPC released a proposed &quot;People&#x27;s Budget&quot; for fiscal year 2012. Two of its proponents stated: &quot;By implementing a fair tax code, by building a resilient American economy, and by bringing our troops home, we achieve a budget surplus of over $30 billion by 2021 and we end up with a debt that is less than 65% of our GDP. This is what sustainability looks like&quot;.

In 2019, the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives passed H.R.582, &quot;The Raise the Wage Act&quot;, which would have gradually raised the minimum wage to $15 per hour. It was not taken up in the Republican-controlled Senate. In January 2021, Democrats in the Senate and House of Representatives reintroduced the bill. In February 2021, the Congressional Budget Office released a report on the Raise the Wage Act of 2021 which estimated that incrementally raising the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2025 would benefit 17 million workers, but would also reduce employment by 1.4 million people. On February 27, 2021, the Democratic-controlled House passed the American Rescue Plan pandemic relief package, which included a gradual minimum wage increase to $15 per hour. The measure was ultimately removed from the Senate version of the bill.

====2024 elections====
Five weeks after the 2024 elections, Caucus chair-elect Greg Casar connected &quot;serious discontent&quot; with the Democratic Party to the &quot;2008 housing crash&quot;, as manifested in Occupy Wall Street and certain aims for movements such as Black Lives Matter. According to Casar, Democratic Party leaders must redirect voter attentions away from the specter of &quot;an asylum seeker trying to raise your rent&quot; to &quot;hedge funds just buying up neighborhoods, jacking up the rent and being deregulated by the Republicans.&quot; In a subsequent interview, the Texas labor advocate admitted that &quot;the Democratic brand has been damaged&quot; and outlined the Progressive Caucus strategy for a &quot;rebrand.&quot; 

Casar observed that, during the 2024 electoral campaigns, Republicans focused on &quot;targeting and scapegoating a group of vulnerable people in order to make it sound like, in Middle America, that is all the Democratic Party works on and cares about.&quot; Casar pointed out that Nancy Mace, for instance, had already announced plans to regulate &quot;which marble bathroom certain people can and can’t use, because she wants to distract the American people from the billionaire tax cut that she’s about to work on with Donald Trump.&quot; But he added that Democrats should not support &quot;fighting for working people first&quot; as an avenue for &quot;throwing [another group of] vulnerable people under the bus.&quot; 

In narrating authenticity, &quot;what works is if we tell a clear and authentic story to the American people about why they feel screwed over.&quot; In response to such stories promulgated across the aisle, &quot;we should point out that it wasn’t a trans person that denied your health insurance claim; it was a gigantic corporation that went unregulated by the Republicans. It’s not an undocumented immigrant raising your rent; it’s a Wall Street hedge fund that’s doing it, and Trump is appointing those guys to his Cabinet. I think the Progressive Caucus is ready to tell that kind of story.&quot;

===Health care===
The Medicare for All Act is a bill first introduced in the United States House of Representatives by Representative John Conyers (D-MI) in 2003, with 38 co-sponsors. In 2019, the original 16-year-old proposal was renumbered, and Pramila Jayapal (D-WA) introduced a broadly similar, but more detailed, bill, HR 1384, in the 116th Congress. , it had 116 co-sponsors still in the House at the time, or 49.8% of House Democrats.

The act would establish a universal single-payer health care system in the United States, the rough equivalent of Canada&#x27;s Medicare and Taiwan&#x27;s Bureau of National Health Insurance, among other examples. Under a single-payer system, most medical care would be paid for by the federal government, ending the need for private health insurance and premiums, and re-casting private insurance companies as providing purely supplemental coverage, to be used when non-essential care is sought. The national system would be paid for in part through taxes replacing insurance premiums, but also by savings realized through the provision of preventive universal health care and the elimination of insurance company overhead and hospital billing costs. On September 13, 2017, Senator Bernie Sanders (I-VT) introduced a parallel bill in the United States Senate, with 16 co-sponsors. The act would establish a universal single-payer health care system in the United States.

In 2019, the CPC challenged House speaker Nancy Pelosi regarding the details of a drug-pricing bill, the Elijah Cummings Lower Drug Costs Now Act. The final version was the result of extensive negotiations between House Democratic leadership and members of the CPC. The bill was introduced into the House of Representatives on September 19, 2019, during the 116th Congress by Rep. Frank Pallone (D-NJ). The bill received 106 co-sponsors. It passed the House on December 12, 2019, by a vote of (230-192). All Democrats voted for the measure, and all but 2 Republicans voted against it. The bill was then sent to the Senate. The Senate, having been controlled by Republicans, did not bring the bill up for a vote.

====Abortion rights====

During the 117th United States Congress congresswoman Judy Chu (CA-27) introduced the Women&#x27;s Health Protection Act. The act would expand abortion rights and codify &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot;. It was introduced in response to the Texas Heartbeat Act. It passed House of Representatives (218–211), but was defeated in the Senate on a 46–48 vote in February 2022.

===Climate change===
A prominent 2019 attempt to get legislation passed for a Green New Deal was sponsored by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) and Sen. Ed Markey (D-MA) during the 116th United States Congress, though it failed to advance in the Senate. Green New Deal proposals call for public policy to address climate change along with achieving other social aims like job creation and reducing economic inequality. The name refers back to the New Deal, a set of social and economic reforms and public works projects undertaken by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in response to the Great Depression. The Green New Deal combines Roosevelt&#x27;s economic approach with modern ideas such as renewable energy and resource efficiency.

===LGBT rights===
In July 2022, the House Judiciary Committee chairman Jerrold Nadler (D-NY), Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), Congressional LGBTQ+ Equality caucus Chairman David Cicilline (D-RI), Senator Tammy Baldwin (D-WI) and Senator Susan Collins (R-ME) announced the re-introduction of the Respect for Marriage Act, which was revised to include protections for interracial marriages to codify &quot;Loving v. Virginia&quot;. The act passed the House (267–157) on July 19, 2022, with 47 Republicans joining all Democrats in voting in the affirmative.

The Senate considered the bill, but it was initially unclear if it would receive enough votes to end debate. On November 14, 2022, a group of bipartisan senators, including Rob Portman (R-OH), Kyrsten Sinema (D-AZ), Thom Tillis (R-NC), Tammy Baldwin (D-WI), and Susan Collins (R-ME) announced they had reached an amendment compromise to include language for religious protections and clarify that the bill did not legalize polygamous marriage. The amendment specifies that nonprofit religious organizations will not be required to provide services for the solemnization or celebration of a marriage. Shortly after, Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer announced the Respect for Marriage Act would be put up for a full vote.

On November 16, 2022, the Senate invoked cloture on the motion to proceed (62–37) to the amended bill. All 50 Democratic senators and 12 Republicans (Roy Blunt, Richard Burr, Shelley Moore Capito, Susan Collins, Joni Ernst, Cynthia Lummis, Lisa Murkowski, Rob Portman, Mitt Romney, Dan Sullivan, Thom Tillis, and Todd Young) voted in favor of advancing the bill. On November 29, 2022, the Senate voted 61–36 to pass the bill. Voting in favor of the bill were 49 Democrats and the same 12 Republicans who had voted to advance it. Two Republicans (Ben Sasse and Patrick Toomey) and one Democrat (Raphael Warnock, who co-sponsored the bill) did not vote.

===Foreign policy===
====Israel====
Representative Lois Frankel (FL-22) left the caucus on November 20, 2023, and Ritchie Torres (NY-15) left the caucus on February 21, 2024; both left over disagreements regarding support for Israel in the Israel–Hamas war. Both are described as staunch supporters of Israel.
Twenty Democrats led by Summer Lee and Greg Casar, who was recently elected to lead the Congressional Caucus next year, are calling for support for U.S. legislation that would ban arming countries that block humanitarian aid.

====2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine====
In October 2022, 30 members of the caucus urged the Biden administration to seek a negotiated, diplomatic end to the Russian invasion of Ukraine while advocating for continued economic and military support to Ukraine. The next day, after a wave of criticism, the letter was swiftly withdrawn on the basis that peaceful negotiations with Putin in current situation are &quot;nearly impossible&quot;. Jayapal reasserted the Democrats&#x27; support for Ukraine and said the letter had been drafted several months ago and &quot;released by staff without vetting&quot;.

== Electoral results ==


== Membership ==
All members are Democrats or caucus with the Democratic Party. In the 119th Congress, there are currently 98 declared progressives, including 95 voting Representatives, 1 non-voting Delegate, and 2 Senators. Representative Jennifer McClellan (VA-4) joined the caucus after assuming office in March 2023 while Representative David Cicilline (RI-1) resigned from the House on May 31, 2023. Representatives Lois Frankel (FL-22), Ritchie Torres (NY-15), Ruben Gallego (AZ-3), and Zoe Lofgren (CA-18) have since left the caucus.

== Affiliate organizations ==
The CPC is affiliated with the Congressional Political Caucus PAC, a political action committee which was established in 2009 and is led by members of the caucus to endorse and fundraise for candidates. In 2018, the caucus established the Congressional Progressive Caucus Center and Progressive Caucus Action Fund, a 501(c)(3) and 501(c)(4), respectively, to coordinate messaging and policy initiatives between the caucus and supportive organizations.

<doc id="463231" wikidata="Q5969425" url="?curid=463231" title="ICC Cricket Code of Conduct">
<text>The ICC Cricket Code of Conduct is a regulation regarding the conduct of professional players in the sport of cricket. Traditionally, cricket requires &quot;gentlemanly&quot; conduct from all players. The Code of Conduct is written and enforced by the International Cricket Council.

Under the ICC regulations, players may be fined a percentage of their salary, banned for a number of matches, or even banned for a number of years or life. The ICC appoints a match referee for each Test match, One Day International and Twenty20; the Referee has the power to set penalties for most offences, the exceptions being the more serious ones.

The following are the general categories of serious offences, carrying the highest penalties:
* Gambling on matches (betting).
* Failing to perform in a match in return for a benefit, such as money or goods (match fixing).
* Inducing a player to perform one of the above two actions.
* Failure to report certain incidents relating to match-fixing or gambling.
* Other related offences.

Other offences are categorized as Level 1, Level 2, Level 3, or Level 4 as follows:
==Level 1==
* Breach of the Logo Policy (except for a commercial logo or player&#x27;s bat logo).
* Abuse of equipment clothing, or any part of the ground.
* Showing dissent at an umpire&#x27;s decision by word or by action.
* Using language or a gesture that is obscene, offensive or insulting.
* Excessive appealing.
* Aggressive pointing towards the pavilion by a member of the fielding side upon the dismissal of a batsman

==Level 2==
* Repeat of any Level 1 Offence within 12 months.
* Showing serious dissent at an umpire&#x27;s decision by word or action.
* Breach of the Logo Policy relating to a commercial logo or a player&#x27;s cricket bat logo.
* Public criticism of a match related incident or match official.
* Inappropriate and deliberate physical contact between players during play.
* Aggressively charging towards an umpire while appealing.
* Deliberate distraction or obstruction on the field.
* Throwing the cricket ball at a player, umpire or official in a dangerous manner.
* Using language or a gesture that is obscene, offensive or of a seriously insulting nature to another player, umpire, referee, team official or spectator.
* Any attempt to manipulate a match in regard to the result (In a negative way), net run rate, bonus points or otherwise. (Example: Intentionally losing so that a team will face a weaker opponent in the Finals.)

==Level 3==
* Repeat of any Level 2 Offence within 12 months.
*Changing the condition of the ball.
* Intimidation of an umpire or referee.
* Threat of assault on a player, team official, or spectator.
* Using language or gestures that offends race, religion, colour, descent or national or ethnic origin.

==Level 4==
* Repeat for any Level 3 Offence within 12 months.
* Threat of assault on an umpire or referee.
* Physical assault of another player, umpire, referee, official or spectator.
* Any act of violence during play.
* Using language or gestures that seriously offends race, religion, colour, descent or national or ethnic origin.

==Penalties==
The penalties available for each offence are based on the level. The penalties are as follows:
* Level 1: Fine of 0% to 50% of match fee.
* Level 2: Fine of 50% to 100% of match fee and/or ban for 1 Test or 2 ODIs.
* Level 3: Ban for 6 Tests or 12 ODIs.
* Level 4: Ban for Tests to life or 20 ODIs to life.
Fines in Level 3 and 4 Offences are determined by the ICC without regard to match fee.

Offences relating to gambling or match-fixing carry penalties of bans from 12 months to life, and unlimited fines.

If an offence occurred in a Test match, then the ban for a number of Tests applies; if an offence occurred in an ODI, then the ban for a number of ODIs applies.

<doc id="463234" wikidata="Q7844510" url="?curid=463234" title="Triumph Engineering">
<text>Triumph Engineering Co Ltd was a British motorcycle manufacturing company, based originally in Coventry and then in Meriden. A new company, Triumph Motorcycles Ltd, based in Hinckley, gained the name rights after the end of the company in the 1980s and is now one of the world&#x27;s major motorcycle manufacturers.

==Origins==
The company was started by Siegfried Bettmann, who had emigrated from Nuremberg, part of the German Empire, to Coventry in England in 1883. In 1884, aged 20, Bettmann had founded his own company, the S. Bettmann &amp; Co. Import Export Agency, in London. Bettmann&#x27;s original products were bicycles, which the company bought and then sold under its own name. Bettmann also distributed sewing machines imported from Germany.

In 1886, Bettmann sought a more specific name, and the company became known as the Triumph Cycle Company. A year later, the company was registered as the New Triumph Co. Ltd, now with funding from the Dunlop Pneumatic Tyre Company. During that year, another native of Nuremberg, Moritz Schulte, joined the company as a partner.

Schulte encouraged Bettmann to transform Triumph into a manufacturing company, and in 1888 Bettmann purchased a site in Coventry using money lent by his and Schulte&#x27;s families. The company began producing the first Triumph-branded bicycles in 1889. In 1896 Triumph also opened a bicycle factory in Nuremberg.

In 1898 Triumph decided to extend production at Coventry to include motorcycles, and by 1902 the company had produced its first motorcycle—a bicycle fitted with a Belgian Minerva engine. In 1903, after selling more than 500 motorcycles, Triumph began motorcycle production at the Nuremberg factory. During the first few years the company based its designs on those of other manufacturers, but in 1904 Triumph began building motorcycles based on its own designs, and 1905 saw the first entirely in-house designed motorcycle. By the end of that year, the company had produced more than 250.

In 1907, after the company opened a larger plant, it produced 1,000 machines. Triumph had also initiated a lower-end brand, Gloria, also manufactured in the company&#x27;s original plant.

Confusion between motorcycles produced by the Coventry and Nuremberg Triumph companies resulted in the latter&#x27;s products being renamed Orial for certain export markets. However, a company named Orial already existed in France, so the Nuremberg motorcycles were renamed again as &quot;TWN&quot;, standing for &quot;Triumph Werke Nürnberg&quot;.

==First World War and the 1920s==

The beginning of the First World War was a boost for the company as production was switched to provide for the Allied war effort. More than 30,000 motorcycles—among them the Model H Roadster also known as the &quot;Trusty Triumph&quot;, often cited as the first modern motorcycle—were supplied to the Allies.

After the war, Bettmann and Schulte disagreed about planning, with Schulte wishing to replace bicycle production with cars. Schulte ended his association with the company, but during the 1920s Triumph purchased the former Hillman company car factory in Coventry and produced a saloon car in 1923 under the name of the Triumph Motor Company. Harry Ricardo produced an engine for their latest motorbike.

By the mid-1920s Triumph had become one of Britain&#x27;s main motorcycle and car makers, with a plant capable of producing as many as 30,000 motorcycles and cars each year. Triumph also found its bicycles demanded overseas, and export sales became a primary source of the company&#x27;s revenues, although for the United States, Triumph models were manufactured by licence. The company&#x27;s first automotive success was the Super Seven model, which debuted in 1928. Soon after, the Super Eight model was developed.

==1930s==

When the Great Depression began in 1929, Triumph sold its German subsidiary as a separate, independently owned company, which later merged with the Adler company to become Triumph-Adler. The Nuremberg company continued to manufacture motorcycles as TWN (Triumph Werke Nürnberg) until 1957. In 1932, Triumph sold another part of the company, its bicycle manufacturing facility to Raleigh Bicycle Company. By then, Triumph had been struggling financially, and Bettmann had been forced out of the job of chairman. He retired completely in 1933.

In 1936, the company&#x27;s two components became separate companies. Triumph always struggled to make a profit from cars, and after becoming bankrupt in 1939 was acquired by the Standard Motor Company. The motorcycle operations fared better, having been acquired in 1936 by Jack Sangster, who also owned the rival Ariel motorcycle company. That same year, the company began its first exports to the United States, which quickly grew into the company&#x27;s single most important market. Sangster formed the Triumph Engineering Co Ltd. largely directed by ex-Ariel employees, including Edward Turner who designed the 500 cc 5T Triumph Speed Twin—released in September 1937, and the basis for all Triumph twins until the 1980s. Contrary to popular belief, however, this was not Triumph&#x27;s first parallel twin. The first was the Val Page designed model 6/1, introduced in 1933. This first twin performed well as a racer but was ultimately unpopular with the public and did not sell well.&lt;ref name=&quot;Davis Triumph 6/1&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; After Turner arrived, with his usual brusque manner, the 6/1 ended, later to be replaced with Turner&#x27;s design. The 6/1 engine tooling was also scrapped. In 1939, the 500 cc Tiger T100, capable of , was released, and then the war began.

==Second World War==

Motorcycles were produced at Coventry until the Second World War. The city of Coventry was virtually destroyed in the Coventry Blitz (7 September 1940 to May 1941). Tooling and machinery was recovered from the site of the devastation and production restarted at the new plant at Meriden, Warwickshire in 1942.

==Post-war era==
The Triumph Speed Twin designed by Edward Turner before the war was produced in large numbers after the war. Efforts to settle the Lend-Lease debts caused nearly 70% of Triumph&#x27;s post-war production to be shipped to the United States. Post war, the Speed Twin and Triumph Tiger 100 were available with a sprung rear hub, Triumph&#x27;s first attempt at a rear suspension.

Privateers put wartime surplus aluminium alloy barrels on their Tiger 100 racers, and won races, inspiring the Triumph GP model. By 1950 the supply of barrels was exhausted, and the GP model was ended. The American market applied considerable demand to reverse this action, and a die-cast close finned aluminium alloy barrel was made available. The aluminium alloy head made the valve noise more obvious, so ramp type cams were introduced for aluminium alloy head models to reduce the noise.

Another motorcycle based on the wartime generator engine was the 498 cc TR5 Trophy Twin, also introduced at the 1948 Motor Cycle Show. It used a single carburettor, low compression version of the Grand Prix engine. Britain won the prestigious 1948 International Six Days Trial. The Triumph works team had finished unpenalised. One team member, Allan Jefferies, had been riding what amounted to a prototype version.

To satisfy the American demand for motorcycles suited to long-distance riding, Turner built a 650 cc version of the Speed Twin design. The new bike was named the Thunderbird (a name Triumph would later license to the Ford Motor Company for use for a car model). Only one year after the Thunderbird was introduced, a motorcyclist in Southern California mated the 650 Thunderbird with a twin carb head intended originally for GP racing and named the new creation the Wonderbird. That 650 cc motor, designed in 1939, had the world&#x27;s absolute speed record for motorcycles from 1955 until 1970.

The Triumph brand received considerable publicity in the United States when Marlon Brando rode a 1950 Thunderbird 6T in the 1953 film, &quot;The Wild One&quot;.

The Triumph Motorcycle concern was sold to their rivals BSA by Sangster in 1951. This sale included Sangster becoming a member of the BSA board. Sangster was to become Chairman of the BSA Group in 1956.

The production 650 cc Thunderbird (6T) was a low-compression tourer, and the 500 cc Tiger 100 was the performance motorcycle. That changed in 1954, with the change to swing arm frames, and the release of the aluminium alloy head 650 cc Tiger 110, eclipsing the 500 cc Tiger 100 as the performance model.

In 1959, the T120, a tuned double carburettor version of the Triumph Tiger T110, came to be known as the &quot;Bonneville&quot;. As Triumph and other marques gained market share, Harley became aware that their 1-litre-plus motorcycles were not as sporty as modern riders would like, resulting in a decreasing share of the market. The Triumphs were models for a new, &quot;small&quot; Harley-Davidson as a result: the now-fabled Harley-Davidson Sportster, which started as Harley&#x27;s version of a Triumph Bonneville. With its anachronistic V-twin, the Sportster was no match for the Bonneville, but it proved a solid competitor in US sales and eventually also in longevity.

During the 1960s, despite internal opposition from those who believed that it would reduce the macho image of the brand, Triumph produced two scooters; the &quot;Triumph Tina&quot;, a small and low-performance 2-stroke scooter of about 100 cc with automatic clutch and a handlebar carry basket, and the &quot;Triumph Tigress&quot;, a more powerful scooter available with either a 175 cc 2-stroke single or a 250 cc 4-stroke twin engine for the enthusiast.

In 1962, the last year of the &quot;pre-unit&quot; models, Triumph used a frame with twin front down-tubes, but returned to a traditional Triumph single front downtube for the unit construction models that ensued. The twin down tube, or duplex frame, was used for the 650 twins, as a result of frame fractures on the Bonneville. Introduced in 1959, for the 1960 model year, it soon needed strengthening, and was ended in 1962, with the advent of the unit engines for the 650 range. The 3TA (21) was the first unit construction twin, soon followed by the short-stroke, 490 cc &quot;500&quot; range.

From 1963 all Triumph engines were of unit construction.

In 1969 Malcolm Uphill, riding a Bonneville, won the Isle of Man Production TT race with a race average of per lap, and recorded the first ever more than lap by a production motorcycle at . For many Triumph fans, the 1969 Bonneville was the best Triumph model ever.

American sales had already maximised, in 1967. In truth, the demand for motorcycles was increasing, but Triumph could not supply the demand.

During the 1960s, 60% of all Triumph production was exported, which, along with the BSA&#x27;s 80% exports, made the group susceptible to the Japanese expansion. By 1969 fully 50% of the US market for motorcycles more than 500 cc belonged to Triumph, but technological advances at Triumph had failed to match those of the foreign companies. Triumphs lacked electric start mechanisms, relied on push-rods rather than overhead cams, vibrated noticeably, often leaked oil and had antiquated electrical systems; while Japanese marques such as Honda were building more advanced features into attractive new motorcycles that sold for less than their British competitors. Triumph motorcycles, as a result, were nearly obsolete even when they were new. Further, Triumph&#x27;s manufacturing processes were very labour-intensive and largely inefficient. Also disastrous, during the early 1970s the US government mandated that all motorcycle imports must have their gearshift and brake pedals in the Japanese configuration, which required expensive retooling of all the motorcycles for US sale.

Triumph and BSA were well aware of Honda&#x27;s ability, with Honda winning motorcycle world championships since 1961, racing in Formula One, and offering the Honda CB450 twin since 1965, but while the Japanese were only making smaller engined models, the large engine market was considered safe. When the first Honda CB750 cc four cylinder was released for sale to the public in 1969, Triumph and BSA had trouble. Despite developing and releasing a 3-cylinder 750 cc engined motorcycle prior to the Japanese fours—the BSA Rocket 3/Triumph Trident—the Japanese bikes were praised in the press for their modernity (disc brakes, 4-cylinder engines, leak-free engine casings, etc.). The British triples outperformed the Japanese fours (top speed, acceleration and handling) but the Japanese fours required less maintenance and they did not leak.

The 1970 Tiger/Bonneville re-design and taller twin front downtube oil tank frame had a mixed reception from Triumph enthusiasts at the time, and was insufficient to win back those already riding the Japanese bikes that had been sold since 1969—the Honda 750 Four, and the Kawasaki 500 Mach 3. The Triumph 350 cc Bandit received pre-publicity, but its development was quietly brought to an end. Triumph was still making motorcycles, but they no longer looked like the motorcycles Triumph fans expected. The Trident attracted its own market, but the Japanese motorcycles were improving more rapidly.

The parent BSA group had losses of £8.5 million in 1971, £3 million for BSA motorcycles alone. The British government became involved. The company was sold to Manganese Bronze Holdings, which also owned Norton, AJS, Matchless, Francis-Barnett, James-Velocette and Villiers.

==Norton Villiers Triumph==
After the BSA group went bankrupt in 1972, Dennis Poore, the chairman of Norton-Villiers (a subsidiary of Manganese Bronze Holdings) was induced by government aid to assume control of BSA/Triumph. Norton and BSA/Triumph were merged under the umbrella of a new company, Norton Villiers Triumph (NVT) in 1972. Poore was made NVT Group chairman and put in charge, even though Norton had produced far fewer bikes than the once-mighty BSA/Triumph.

Poore then held consultations with factory personnel to propose consolidation plans he thought necessary to compete with the Japanese. In September 1973 he announced that the Meriden factory was to close in February 1974, with 3,000 employees out of 4,500 being made redundant.

== The Meriden Motorcycle Co-operative ==

Concerned about unemployment and losing their products to a rival factory, the workers at the Meriden factory demonstrated against the proposed relocation to the BSA site at Small Heath, Birmingham, and staged a sit-in for two years. With political aid of the newly elected Labour government and, in particular, the then minister for Trade and Industry, Tony Benn, the Meriden worker&#x27;s co-operative was formed, supplying Triumph 750 cc motorcycles to its sole customer, NVT.

After the collapse of NVT in 1977, the co-operative bought the marketing rights for Triumph with more government loans, later becoming Triumph Motorcycles (Meriden) Limited. The venture, with only two 750 cc models, the Bonneville and Tiger, started well with a successful variant, the 1977 Silver Jubilee Bonneville T140J and by 1978 was the best selling European motorcycle in the vital USA market.

Emissions compliant models during 1978 and 1979 such as the aluminium alloy-wheeled Triumph T140D Bonneville Special and T140E Bonneville were introduced to the dominant USA market, but the strong British pound made these bikes prohibitively expensive and they failed to sell in significant numbers. Moreover, despite updates such as electric starting and a faired Triumph Bonneville Executive T140EX with luggage, by 1980 Meriden&#x27;s debt was £2 million—in addition to the earlier £5 million loan. In October 1980, the new Conservative British government wrote off £8.4 million owed but still left the company owing £2 million to Britain&#x27;s Export Credits Guarantee Department.

Meriden introduced several new models such as the dual purpose TR7T Tiger Trail and budget 650 cc Triumph TR65 Thunderbird during its last years but none were able to stop the decline, worsened by a UK recession and a continuing strong pound harming sales to the US. However, the Triumph Royal Wedding T140LE Bonneville celebrating the Prince of Wales&#x27; nuptials was a popular collector&#x27;s item for 1981 and that year a 750 cc TR7T Tiger Trail won the Rallye des Pyrénées on/off-road rally. Large orders for police motorcycles from Nigeria and Ghana were won at critical moments thereby saving the firm during 1979 and 1982 respectively. 1982 was the last year of &quot;full&quot; production, with the custom-styled Triumph T140 TSX and 8-valve Triumph T140W TSS model initiated—although a porous cylinder head made by external contractors and insufficient development quickly eroded the latter&#x27;s initial market popularity.

In 1983, the debt-ridden company briefly considered buying the bankrupt Hesketh Motorcycles, and even badged one as a marketing trial. Despite also touting a 900cc prototype water-cooled twin at the 1983 National Exhibition Show to attract outside investment, Triumph Motorcycles (Meriden) Ltd itself became bankrupt on 23 August 1983.

==Triumph Motorcycles (Hinckley) Ltd==

Triumph Motorcycles (Hinckley) Ltd is the largest surviving British motorcycle manufacturer. When Triumph went into receivership in 1983, John Bloor, a former plasterer who acquired his wealth from building and property development, became interested in keeping the brand alive, and bought the name and manufacturing rights from the Official Receiver. The new company, initially Bonneville Coventry Ltd, ensured that Triumph has produced motorcycles since 1902, winning it the title of the world&#x27;s second longest continuous production motorcycle manufacturer, one year behind Royal Enfield. A licensing agreement granted to pattern spares manufacturer, Les Harris, kept the Triumph Bonneville in production until Triumph initiated a new range during 1990 and 1991. Triumph now makes a range of motorcycles reviving model names of the past, including a newly designed Bonneville twin.

<doc id="463238" wikidata="Q1627134" url="?curid=463238" title="Allegiance (video game)">
<text>Allegiance is a multiplayer online game initially developed by Microsoft Research. It is notable for providing a mix of real-time strategy and player piloted space combat gameplay.

Although the game was well received upon release, its sales turned out disappointing, selling fewer than 29,000 copies in its first year. Microsoft later released it under a proprietary shared source license in 2004 and is maintained and developed by volunteers. In 2017, the license was changed to the free MIT license.

==Gameplay==
&quot;Allegiance&quot; is an online multiplayer real time strategy/space simulation game. Players pilot spacecraft (from small one-man vessels to large capital ships), flying in a team with other players and trying to gain victory through various means, such as destroying or capturing all enemy bases, or eliminating the enemy&#x27;s will to fight. Teams are led by a single Commander who makes tactical decisions and invests in technology and bases. Flight and combat is done in either a first or third person view in a 3D environment, with a real-time, top-down &quot;Command View&quot; of the player&#x27;s immediate surroundings also available.

Flying a ship is unlike other space sims as &quot;Allegiance&quot; uses a linear drag flight model, where the absolute speeds are limited, but ship inertia still plays an important role in maneuver considerations.

===Game objective===
Gameplay involves expanding from one&#x27;s starting Garrison in order to secure mining areas, and then either destroying enemy bases or destroying his capacity to fight (through economic warfare), much like a conventional Real time strategy game. However, due to &quot;Allegiance&quot;″s combination of RTS and space sim elements, some reviewers classify &quot;Allegiance&quot; in a genre of its own. Like an RTS, there is a commander who builds bases and miners, controls the team&#x27;s cash and develops the team&#x27;s plan for victory. On the other hand, individual units are controlled by other human players instead of a computer AI which faithfully carries out the commander&#x27;s orders.

All teams start (by default) with a single Garrison base, a single miner, a set amount of cash and access to a couple of starting ships. One of those starting ships is always the scout. One of the most important ships in &quot;Allegiance&quot;, the scout is responsible for finding all of a map&#x27;s sectors and alephs at the beginning of the game. It is also capable of repairing friendly ships under attack, deploying probes to detect enemy movements, deploying minefields which destroy or delay enemy ships, and assisting more powerful ships by spotting enemy targets.

====The three stages of a conquest game====
A conquest game splits into three phases, the transitions between these stages are smooth.

* opening - players will explore the map to plan further tactics. At the same moment the first base constructors will launch and move into the newly discovered sectors. Losing one of the constructors or a miner in this stage can change the outcome of the whole game, so both teams try to defend and/or attack the enemy ones.
* mid game - at this point the first bases were built and teams economy are more vulnerable than in the beginning. Also the first technology will be researched, so the teams have access to more powerful ships. The goal of this stage is to get money, hurt the enemy economy and claim sectors. Some teams will research technology to kill bases, others just focus on combat ships.
* end game - one or both teams collected enough money to research advanced technology. Teams will try to destroy or capture the enemy technology bases with their superior technology. Sometimes one teams is unable to destroy or capture the others team last base, so it can end up in a drawn-out battle. These games are over if the team manages to coordinate their attacks or if they have enough money to spam last enemy sectors with bases and/or capital ships. The game is over if one team loses all its technology bases, one team resigns or both teams draw the game.

===Economy===
Teams earn money in &quot;Allegiance&quot; through the use of miners, drone craft which harvest Helium-3 from special asteroids. As miners are a team&#x27;s principal source of income, commanders frequently buy as many miners as possible, and gameplay frequently revolves around defending friendly miners and destroying enemy ones.

When the funds are available, Commanders can build new bases by purchasing a constructor drone. Once the constructor is ready, the commander orders it to a specific asteroid in a specific sector. It travels from sector to sector using Alephs, wormhole like structures floating in space. Once it arrives at the target sector, it travels to the designated asteroid and builds the base. Constructors are vulnerable until the base is built, so teams frequently focus on protecting their constructors and destroying hostile ones. The bases created by constructors range from simple outposts, used for offensive strikes and territory control, to advanced Technology Bases which allow development of new ships, weapons, and upgrades.

===Tech paths===
There are three principle technology paths in &quot;Allegiance&quot;, each relying on a specialized base. The Tactical path allows the team to fly stealth fighters, which excel at destroying drones such as miners and constructors. The Expansion path creates interceptors: tough, maneuverable craft specializing in defense and short-range dogfights. With a Supremacy Center, the commander can research fighters: versatile ships capable of teleporting to special bases around the map.

Most games in &quot;Allegiance&quot; end with the destruction or capture of all one team&#x27;s major bases, and each techpath has tools to accomplish that goal. Both the Supremacy and Tactical techpath rely on some variation of the Bomber, a base destroying ship originally researched at the team&#x27;s Garrison. The Expansion techpath uses a special Heavy Troop Transport which captures bases. Additionally, teams can build a special Shipyard base, capable of producing expensive, base-destroying capital ships or capital ships with advanced missile systems that can destroy enemy fighters from long ranges.

A typical game lasts between thirty and forty-five minutes, although games of more than two hours in length are not uncommon.

&quot;Allegiance&quot; has a reputation for not being an easy game to learn, even with its simplified flight model. It has a complex control scheme and a heavy focus on teamwork, tactics and player co-ordination.

== Plot ==
===Setting===
The story in which the game is set takes place circa 2150, shortly after the destruction of Earth by an asteroid. This cataclysm forced the remnants of humanity to the stars in search of new land and resources. Humanity quickly fractures into four main factions:
* GigaCorp, a transplanetary corporation bent on controlling all natural resources.
* The militaristic Iron Coalition, descendants of a United Nations-sanctioned peacekeeping force.
* Belters, a motley collection of traders, freedom fighters and pirates.
* The Bios, a mysterious offshoot of genetically engineered humans with their own agenda for &quot;stalegenes&quot;.

In the midst of the ensuing civil war, humans discover the alien Rixian Unity. An ancient and advanced race, the Rixians seek to &quot;enlighten&quot; heathen races (such as the human race) and convert them to their religion.

===Story===
In 2008 Emmet Longstreet founded GigaCorp, allegedly through a series of shady dealings involving the consolidation of many powerful aerospace companies (as well as other technical industries). Their aim was to colonize and exploit the resources of near-Earth space. 25 years later, a subsidiary of GigaCorp begins genetically engineering humans to be better suited for life in space. Legal restrictions kept the experiments secret, and the resulting group of improved humans became known as BIOS.

During 2057 another GigaCorp project discovers Helium-3 deposits in the asteroid belt. Experiments reveal that He3 would be a highly useful fuel for nuclear fusion. Fierce competition for He3 deposits lead to escalating tensions and political destabilization. In 2071, an He3-related dispute called &quot;The Siege of Leonov&quot; precipitates in United Nations peacekeeping involvement. With a surprise strike, the UN forces end the siege with military action and take over the rich He3 deposits in Leonov Crater. In the wake of this incident, attempts to claim He3 deposits become increasingly violent, leading to a series of minor conflicts involving the UN Coalition forces, independent prospectors and GigaCorp.

In 2074, Gigacorp CEO unveiled the Mass Conveyor system, which transports Helium-3 rich asteroids from the Asteroid Belt to Lunar orbit for capture and mining. This technology is wildly successful, and within two years Gigacorp begins licensing it to other corporations. By 2079, scores of asteroids arrive daily in Lunar orbit, but the lack of a central traffic control system causes problems.

Faster-than-light travel had previously been impossible, but in 2125 the first &quot;Aleph&quot; is discovered by the Crimson Group, a rival of Gigacorp. While their origin is unknown, Alephs are stable wormholes that connect far-flung regions of the galaxy. Soon all of humanity learns of the existence of alephs, which are the sole source of FTL travel in the &quot;Allegiance&quot; universe. Factions begin vying for control over alephs as fiercely as they battled for control over Helium-3 deposits.

In 2140, a malfunction in the Mass Conveyor system ends with a large asteroid colliding with Earth, cracking the mantle, and killing roughly 95 percent of the Earth&#x27;s population instantaneously. As the remnants of the Earth&#x27;s population die in the aftermath, the Solar System plunges into chaos. The four strongest factions rise to seize power over the remnants of humanity. These are the Iron Coalition (UN forces), GigaCorp, the Belter Armada and the BIOS.

The game begins in 2150, with BIOS aggression initiating widespread warfare between the factions.

==History==
===Development===
Initially developed by Microsoft Research, &quot;Allegiance&quot; was first released for multiplayer on the Microsoft Zone under the name &quot;Allegiance Zone&quot;. This was a paid subscription service but free play was available on the Free Zone (which had fewer features). The game never achieved commercial success however, selling a mere 29,000 units in the first year of release.

=== End-of-life ===
The official servers closed in 2002. During its brief retail life &quot;Allegiance&quot; had drawn a dedicated following that continued to play beyond Microsoft&#x27;s discontinuation of support for &quot;Allegiance&quot;.

=== Community continuation ===
To allow the player community to maintain &quot;Allegiance&quot; themselves, on the commercial end-of-life the source-code was released under a shared source license in 2004. It is up-to now maintained and developed by volunteers of the fan-community under the name &quot;FreeAllegiance&quot;.

In July 2017, Microsoft Research changed the license from MSR shared source license to MIT license, due to the community&#x27;s initiative to bring &quot;Allegiance&quot; to Steam.

==Reception==
&quot;Allegiance&quot; garnered generally favorable reviews, according to aggregator Metacritic. It claimed GameSpot&#x27;s award for &quot;Best Game No One Played&quot;, as it did not sell as well as Microsoft had hoped. Even with good reviews and a loyal playerbase, the game&#x27;s steep learning curve made it unattractive to the average gamer.

After Microsoft dropped support for &quot;Allegiance&quot;, the game has continued to be developed and the game has received additional praise and recognition, but the playerbase has not substantially increased.

&quot;Allegiance&quot; was a runner-up for the best multiplayer game of 2000 in &quot;PC PowerPlay&quot;″s annual awards, behind &quot;Counter-Strike&quot;. It was also a finalist for &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot;″s multiplayer game of 2000 award, which went to &quot;EverQuest&quot; as &quot;Allegiance&quot; failed to gain traction in the video game market. The game was nominated in the &quot;Massive Multiplayer/Persistent World&quot; category during the 4th Annual Interactive Achievement Awards.

<doc id="463239" wikidata="Q854177" url="?curid=463239" title="Kay Scarpetta">
<text>Kay Scarpetta is a fictional character inspired by former Virginia Chief Medical Examiner Marcella Farinelli Fierro MD (retired). She is the protagonist in a series of crime novels written by Patricia Cornwell noted for its use of recent forensic technology in Scarpetta&#x27;s investigations.

The name &quot;Scarpetta&quot; is a diminutive, meaning Little Shoe, as revealed in the 2009 novel &quot;The Scarpetta Factor&quot;, which points out that the underlying pun is similar to &quot;Caligula&quot;, which means Little Boot in Latin. The novel features a website named Caligula, which is involved indirectly in the murder of a young woman.

== Fictional character biography ==

Family background: Miami, Florida, 1954, of Italian descent on both sides of her family (the Scarpettas emigrated from Verona, Italy). As a young girl she watched her father die from leukemia.

Education: Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, Baltimore, and Georgetown Law School. She has certificates, including from Cornell University, Johns Hopkins University and Georgetown University.

Employment: In the early novels Scarpetta works in Richmond as the Chief Medical Examiner for the Commonwealth of Virginia and as a member of faculty at Virginian Medical Center (VMC). She resigns after the events of &quot;The Last Precinct&quot;, moving to Florida to become a private forensic consultant. Scarpetta returns to Virginia in &quot;Trace&quot;, convincing herself that she was fired from her position at the request of her replacement, Dr Joel Marcus. In &quot;Predator&quot; Scarpetta becomes the head of the National Forensic Academy in Hollywood, Florida, a private institution founded by her wealthy niece, Lucy. In &quot;The Book of the Dead&quot; Scarpetta has relocated as a freelance forensic examiner/expert to Charleston, South Carolina. In &quot;Scarpetta&quot; (2008) she has moved to Massachusetts, where she is an M.E., but she and Benton also share an apartment in New York City. In &quot;The Scarpetta Factor (2009)&quot; she is working full-time and Wesley is working part-time in New York.

Appearance: Blonde and a sharp dresser, with a wardrobe of designer suits.

Character: A perfectionist and workaholic. She loves to cook, particularly Italian food, and makes everything from scratch, including pasta and bread. She has a beautiful home built to her specifications, including a restaurant kitchen. She drives a Mercedes, which she replaces often.

Relationships: Married to Tony Benedetti while at law school. Divorced about 6 years before the beginning of the first novel, set in 1986, &quot;Postmortem&quot;. Subsequent on-again, off-again relationship with Mark James, who dies in a bombing in a London Tube station (in the novel &quot;Cruel and Unusual&quot;). Third relationship with Benton Wesley, who is supposedly killed in &quot;Point of Origin&quot; but later reappears. In 2007&#x27;s &quot;The Book of the Dead&quot;, Scarpetta and Wesley become engaged, and they are married by the opening of 2008&#x27;s &quot;Scarpetta&quot;.

== Recurring characters in the series ==
=== Lucy Farinelli ===
Lucy is the only child of Kay&#x27;s flighty sister, Dorothy. She first appears at age 10 in &quot;Postmortem&quot;. Lucy has a natural aptitude for computers. Although frequently sulky in her adolescence, she shapes herself into a very strong woman with Kay&#x27;s model to follow. She enters the FBI at 18 but is not well accepted owing to her sexual orientation and her genius IQ. Lucy has several relationships (with women) in the course of the series. She also has several one-night stands—even a few with men—and engages in other risky behavior with firearms and high-speed vehicles. At one point she gets drunk and wrecks Kay&#x27;s new Mercedes-Benz. She also gets into a firefight between two helicopters, using handheld firearms.

Early in her FBI career Lucy is seduced by Carrie Grethen, a sociopathic coworker who is in cahoots with Temple Gault, a cold-blooded murderer who had crossed Kay&#x27;s path a few years before. The relationship haunts Lucy and those who are close to her in several books. Lucy becomes a self-made millionaire by the age of 25 by building and selling internet search engines—years before Google. She invests some of her earnings in her own private investigating firm, The Last Precinct, located in NYC, and later in a forensic training center, The National Forensic Academy, in Hollywood, Florida, which employs her Aunt Kay and Pete Marino. She has a penchant for buying expensive machines like helicopters, Ferraris, and motorcycles. She also purchases a private jet, for which she earns a private pilot license.

In &quot;Predator&quot;, Lucy is diagnosed with a benign brain tumor that alters her physical appearance and seems also to modify her personality. In &quot;The Book of the Dead&quot; she is undergoing treatment; in later books the disease is not mentioned. In 2007&#x27;s &quot;The Book of the Dead&quot; she almost kills Pete Marino when she discovers he has attacked and almost raped her Aunt Kay. In the latest two novels, &quot;Scarpetta&quot; and &quot;The Scarpetta Factor&quot;, Lucy is back in New York running her own company again and is in a relationship with the New York DA Jaime Berger.

In &quot;Blow Fly&quot;, Lucy helps murder Rocco Caggiano, Pete Marino&#x27;s renegade son, in a Polish hotel.

Over the course of the series, the characters do not age consistently, e.g. Kay Scarpetta is around age 40 at the beginning of the series, meaning she is 30 years older than Lucy. However, by the time of the novel &quot;Blow Fly&quot;, Lucy is almost 30, while Scarpetta is still only 46. The table below shows how Lucy ages.
=== Pete Marino ===
Pete Marino grew up in Bayonne, New Jersey. He started his police career in New York City. In the early books, he is a homicide detective for the Richmond police department, eventually rising to the rank of captain. He is an excellent detective and works for many years with Dr. Scarpetta, with whom he is secretly in love. He eventually joins her at the National Forensic Academy after retiring from the police force in &quot;Predator&quot;. Marino seems to have problems with women through the whole Scarpetta series, stemming from a prior marriage which resulted in a son who becomes a lawyer for a drug cartel. Throughout the series Marino plays a great part in the upbringing of Lucy, although he has issues with her sexuality.

In &quot;Book of the Dead&quot;, Marino reacts badly to news of Scarpetta&#x27;s engagement to Benton Wesley, and after getting drunk and under the influence of a testosterone drug, he attacks Kay and almost rapes her. His actions lead to a confrontation with Lucy and her almost shooting him, after which Marino disappears. It is unknown if he has killed himself or just runs away as the book ends. Marino reappears in &quot;Scarpetta&quot;.

=== Benton Wesley ===
Benton is an FBI profiler. 

He and Scarpetta work together on many cases. They have an affair for several years. Once Benton is no longer with his wife he wishes to marry Kay, but she resists because she is too independent. In &quot;Point of Origin&quot; Benton disappears; a body is found at the scene of a fire, tortured and badly burned. Kay identifies the body as Benton&#x27;s by the Breitling watch she had given him. In &quot;Blow Fly&quot; it is revealed that he is not dead, but hiding in a witness protection program. In &quot;Book of the Dead&quot; Kay and Benton become engaged; they are married by the beginning of &quot;Scarpetta&quot;.

In the early books Benton is described as the unit chief of the FBI profilers with a master&#x27;s degree in psychology, working out of Quantico. In &quot;Point of Origin&quot; he has supposedly retired from the FBI and is working as a private consultant, though in &quot;The Scarpetta Factor&quot; it is implied that he was still under the FBI&#x27;s control and was forced into the witness program, then into a retirement that he still resents. In &quot;Book of the Dead&quot; and the books following his return, he is a forensic psychologist on staff at McLean in Massachusetts, then also at Bellevue in NYC, while still consulting for the FBI.

=== Dorothy Farinelli ===
Dorothy is Kay&#x27;s sister and mother of Lucy. Kay says of her that, &quot;my sister should never have been a mother. My sister should never have been Italian.&quot; When she was 18 married Armando, an old man who was very rich.

<doc id="463243" wikidata="Q722890" url="?curid=463243" title="Michael Winner">
<text>Michael Robert Winner (30 October 1935 – 21 January 2013) was an English filmmaker, writer, and media personality. He is known for directing numerous action, thriller, and black comedy films in the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, including several collaborations with actors Oliver Reed and Charles Bronson.

Winner&#x27;s best-known works include &quot;Death Wish&quot; (1974) and its first two sequels &quot;Death Wish II&quot; (1982) and &quot;Death Wish 3&quot; (1985), the World War II comedy &quot;Hannibal Brooks&quot; (1969), the hitman thriller &quot;The Mechanic&quot; (1972), the supernatural horror film &quot;The Sentinel&quot; (1977), the neo-noir &quot;The Big Sleep&quot; (1978), the satirical comedy &quot;Won Ton Ton, the Dog Who Saved Hollywood&quot; (1976), and the Revisionist Westerns &quot;Lawman&quot; (1971) and &quot;Chato&#x27;s Land&quot; (1972).

Winner was known as a media personality in the United Kingdom, appearing regularly on television talk programmes and publishing a restaurant review column for &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;. He was also a founder of the Police Memorial Trust.

==Early life and education==
Winner was born at 40 Belsize Grove, Belsize Park, Hampstead, London. the only child of Jewish parents George Joseph Winner (1910–1975), of Russian-Jewish origin, and Helen (née Zlota; January 1906 – May 1984), who was born in Poland. His mother had emigrated to the UK in 1932 with her parents and a brother, and later anglicised her name from ‘Chana Rosa’ to ‘Helen Rose’. His father - who was a Freemason and belonged to the same Masonic Lodge as Tommy Cooper - was a businessman and company director responsible for running a branch of the Winner&#x27;s clothing chain founded by his own father, who became a naturalised British citizen in 1910. Following his father&#x27;s death, Winner&#x27;s mother gambled recklessly and sold art and furniture worth around £10m at the time, bequeathed to her not only for her life but to Michael thereafter. She died at the age of 78, in 1984.

Winner was educated at St Christopher School, Letchworth, and Downing College, Cambridge, where he read law and economics. He also edited the university&#x27;s student newspaper, &quot;Varsity&quot;, and was the youngest ever editor up to that time, both in age and in terms of his university career (being only in the second term of his second year). Winner had earlier written a newspaper column, &quot;Michael Winner&#x27;s Showbiz Gossip&quot;, in the &quot;Kensington Post&quot; from the age of fourteen. The first issue of &quot;Showgirl Glamour Revue&quot; in 1955 had him writing another film and show-business gossip column, &quot;Winner&#x27;s World&quot;. Such jobs allowed him to meet and interview several leading film personalities, including James Stewart and Marlene Dietrich. He also wrote for the &quot;New Musical Express&quot;.

Winner claimed in his memoirs that he avoided National Service by pretending to be gay.

==Career==
===Shorts===
Winner directed his first travelogue, &quot;This is Belgium&quot; (1957), which was largely shot on location in East Grinstead. It was financed by his father. Later, he wrote, produced and directed a short, &quot;The Square&quot; (1957), starring A. E. Matthews, and which again was financed by Winner&#x27;s father.

Winner&#x27;s first on-screen feature credit was earned as a writer for the low-budget crime film &quot;Man with a Gun&quot; (1958) directed by Montgomery Tully. He went on to direct the shorts &quot;Danger, Women at Work&quot; (1959) and &quot;Watch the Birdie&quot; (1959), and was Associate Producer on &quot;Floating Fortress&quot; (1959), produced by Harold Baim.

===Early British feature films===
Winner&#x27;s first feature as director was &quot;Shoot to Kill&quot; (1960), which he also wrote. Dermot Walsh starred. He followed this with &quot;Climb Up the Wall&quot; (1960), which was essentially a series of music acts presented by Jack Jackson, but which Winner nonetheless wrote and directed.

Winner&#x27;s third feature as director was the thriller &quot;Murder on the Campus&quot; (1961), also known as &quot;Out of the Shadow&quot;, which Winner also wrote and helped produce. Dermot Walsh starred once again, together with Terence Longdon. Shortly afterwards, Winner wrote and directed the short &quot;Girls Girls Girls!&quot; (1961) which was narrated by Jackson, and directed the short feature &quot;Old Mac&quot; (1961), written by Richard Aubrey and starring Charles Lamb, Vi Stevens and Tania Mallet.

Winner directed the shorts &quot;Haunted England&quot; (1961), &quot;It&#x27;s Magic&quot; (1962), and &quot;Behave Yourself&quot; (1962), the latter of which was based on Emily Post&#x27;s &quot;Book of Manners&quot;, and whose cast included Jackson and Dennis Price.

Winner achieved success with a musical he directed, &quot;Play It Cool&quot; (1962), starring Billy Fury and Michael Anderson Jr., and which was distributed by Anglo-Amalgamated.

Winner&#x27;s next feature, &quot;Some Like It Cool&quot; (1962), is the tale of a young woman who introduces her prudish husband and in-laws to the joys of nudism. Filmed at Longleat, Winner was afraid the sight of bare flesh would offend the magistrate for the area, so he confided his worries to the landowner, the Marquess of Bath. &#x27;Don&#x27;t worry,&#x27; said the Marquess, &#x27;I am the local magistrate.&#x27; The film cost £9,000 and Winner said it made its money back in a week.

Winner went on to update Gilbert and Sullivan, writing the screenplay and directing a version of &quot;The Mikado&quot; titled &quot;The Cool Mikado&quot; (1963), starring Frankie Howerd and Stubby Kaye and which was produced by Harold Baim.

Winner&#x27;s first significant project was &quot;West 11&quot; (1963), a realistic tale of London drifters starring Alfred Lynch, Eric Portman and Diana Dors, and which was based on a script by Hall and Waterhouse.

===Oliver Reed===
Winner&#x27;s film &quot;The System&quot; (1964), also known as &quot;The Girl-Getters&quot;, began a partnership with actor Oliver Reed that would last for six films over a 25-year period, and was based on a script by Peter Draper. Winner would later receive an offer from Columbia to direct a comedy, &quot;You Must Be Joking!&quot; (1965). It starred American actor Michael Callan and a supporting cast that included Lionel Jeffries and Denholm Elliott, while Winner also wrote the script.

Winner was reunited with Reed on &quot;The Jokers&quot; (1967), a comedy where Reed was teamed with Michael Crawford. It was based on a script by Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais from a story by Winner for his own company, Scimitar Films Limited (for Universal&#x27;s English operations, then under Jay Kanter). The resulting movie was a popular hit.

Winner and Reed then made the comedy-drama &quot;I&#x27;ll Never Forget What&#x27;s&#x27;isname&quot; (1967), co-starring Orson Welles, Carol White and Harry Andrews, also for Scimitar. Draper wrote the script, which was a spoof of the advertising world, and the film was also done for Universal.

Winner did some uncredited directing on &quot;A Little of What You Fancy&quot; (1967), a documentary about the history of the British music hall. Then he and Reed made their fourth feature together, the World War II satire &quot;Hannibal Brooks&quot; (1969), again from a Clement/La Frenais script and based on a story by Winner.
In 1970, Winner directed &quot;The Games&quot; for 20th Century Fox, the film is about the Olympic Games and which starred Ryan O&#x27;Neal and Stanley Baker, with script by Eric Segal.

===Early American films===
&quot;Hannibal Brooks&quot; drew notice in Hollywood, and Winner soon received an opportunity to direct his first American film, for United Artists; this was &quot;Lawman&quot; (1971), a Western starring Burt Lancaster and Robert Duvall, and for which Gerald Wilson was the writer.

Back in England, Winner directed Marlon Brando in &quot;The Nightcomers&quot; (1971), a prequel to &quot;The Turn of the Screw&quot; by Henry James, the first of many films for which Winner was credited as editor using the pseudonym &#x27;Arnold Crust&#x27;.

===Charles Bronson===
Winner edited, produced and directed &quot;Chato&#x27;s Land&quot; (1972), recounting a mixed race native American fighting with white people. It starred Charles Bronson and was made for Scimitar through United Artists. Once more, Gerald Wilson wrote the script. Winner&#x27;s second film for Bronson and United Artists was &quot;The Mechanic&quot; (1972), a thriller in which professional assassins are depicted. It was based on a story and script by Lewis John Carlino and Winner also edited, although he did not produce; he replaced Monte Hellman as director.

The following year, Winner cast Lancaster again in the espionage drama &quot;Scorpio&quot; (1973), co-starring Alain Delon and made for Scimitar and United Artists. Winner also produced and directed a third film with Bronson, &quot;The Stone Killer&quot; (1973), for Columbia and in collaboration with producer Dino De Laurentiis.

====&quot;Death Wish&quot;====
Winner and Bronson collaborated on &quot;Death Wish&quot; (1974), a film that defined the subsequent careers of both men. Based on a novel by Brian Garfield and adapted for the screen by Wendell Mayes, &quot;Death Wish&quot; was originally planned for director Sidney Lumet, under contract with United Artists. The commitment of Lumet to another film and UA&#x27;s questioning of its subject matter, led to the film&#x27;s eventual production by De Laurentiis through Paramount Pictures. &quot;Death Wish&quot; follows Paul Kersey, a liberal New York architect who becomes a gun-wielding vigilante after his wife is murdered and daughter is raped. With a script adjusted to Bronson&#x27;s persona, the film generated controversy during its screenings but was one of the year&#x27;s highest grossers.

===Non-Bronson period===
Winner tried to break out of action films with &quot;Won Ton Ton, the Dog Who Saved Hollywood&quot; (1976), an animal comedy Winner produced and directed, starring Bruce Dern, Madeline Kahn, Art Carney, and Milton Berle. Intended as a satire of Hollywood, it was a financial failure. Of modest success was his horror film &quot;The Sentinel&quot; (1977), which Winner wrote, produced and directed for Universal, and which was based on the novel by Jeffrey Konvitz.

Winner then wrote, produced and directed the remake of Raymond Chandler&#x27;s novel &quot;The Big Sleep&quot; (1978), starring Robert Mitchum as Philip Marlowe with a strong support cast including John Mills, Sarah Miles, Richard Boone and Candy Clarke. The film was relocated to England, and financed by ITC Films. Also for ITC, Winner produced, edited and directed the organised crime thriller &quot;Firepower&quot; (1979). It was meant to star Bronson, who withdrew, and wound up starring Sophia Loren and James Coburn.

===Reunion with Bronson/Cannon Films===
By the early 1980s, Winner found himself in great need of a successful film and accepted Charles Bronson&#x27;s request to film &quot;Death Wish II&quot; (1981), a sequel to the 1974 hit. Bronson had already signed a lucrative deal with Cannon Films, independent producer of exploitation fare and marginal art house titles. The sequel, co-starring Bronson&#x27;s wife Jill Ireland, considerably increased the violence to more graphic levels. Winner said the film was &#x27;the same, but different&#x27;, to the original. &#x27;That&#x27;s what sequels are – &quot;Rocky II&quot;, &quot;Rocky III&quot; – you don&#x27;t see Sylvester Stallone move to the Congo and become a nurse. Here the look of LA is what&#x27;s different. Besides – rape doesn&#x27;t date!&#x27; &quot;Death Wish II&quot; made a $2 million profit for Cannon films and made an extra $29 million worldwide.

The success of &quot;Death Wish II&quot; enabled Winner to raise money from Cannon for a dream project: a 1983 remake of 1945&#x27;s &quot;The Wicked Lady&quot;, this time starring Faye Dunaway and which Winner wrote, produced and directed.

For Miracle Films, Winner produced and directed the thriller &quot;Scream for Help&quot; (1984). He also produced the film &quot;Claudia&quot; (1985), doing some uncredited directing and editing.

Winner was reunited with Bronson and Cannon for &quot;Death Wish 3&quot; (1985), which – although set in New York City – was mostly filmed in London for budgetary reasons. Winner produced and edited.&quot;

Winner was also attached to direct Cannon&#x27;s 1990 film &quot;Captain America&quot;, from a script by James Silke, which he would revise with Stan Hey, and then Stan Lee and Lawrence Block. By 1987, however, Winner was off the project.

Winner&#x27;s final film for Cannon was an adaptation of the Agatha Christie novel &quot;Appointment with Death&quot; (1989) starring Peter Ustinov as Poirot. Winner produced, edited and directed; but despite a strong support cast including Lauren Bacall and Carrie Fisher, the film flopped.

===Final British films===
After Cannon Films entered bankruptcy, Winner confined himself to British productions. He produced and directed an adaptation of the Alan Ayckbourn musical play &quot;A Chorus of Disapproval&quot; (1989) with Anthony Hopkins, and also wrote the script with Ayckbourn.

Winner produced, directed and edited the Michael Caine and Roger Moore farce &quot;Bullseye!&quot; (1990), based on a story by Winner. The film&#x27;s reception was generally poor, with the film being described as &quot;appallingly unfunny&quot; in &quot;The Radio Times Guide to Films&quot;. Later, he wrote, produced and directed &quot;Dirty Weekend&quot; (1993), starring Lia Williams; and hosted the television series &quot;True Crimes&quot;, which was cancelled in 1994.

In 1994, Winner appeared as a guest artist – alongside Joan Collins, Christopher Biggins and Marc Sinden (who in 1983 had appeared in Winner&#x27;s &quot;The Wicked Lady&quot;) – in Steven Berkoff&#x27;s film version of his own play &quot;Decadence&quot;.

Winner&#x27;s final film as director was &quot;Parting Shots&quot; (1999), which he also wrote, produced and edited. The film was critically reviled and flopped commercially.

==Other media activity==
Winner was a regular panellist on BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Any Questions&quot;, and later appeared on television programmes including BBC1&#x27;s &quot;Question Time&quot; and BBC2&#x27;s &quot;Have I Got News for You&quot;. He was also an occasional columnist for the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; throughout the 2000s, and an honorary member of BAFTA and of the Directors Guild of Great Britain. His autobiography &quot;Winner Takes All: A Life of Sorts&quot; was published by Robson Books in 2006, it largely describes his experiences with many big-screen actors. Winner also wrote a dieting book, &quot;The Fat Pig Diet Book&quot;.

Winner also featured in television commercials that he himself directed for insurance company esure between 2002 and 2009, with his trademark catchphrase &quot;Calm down, dear! It&#x27;s just a commercial!&quot;.

He was the subject of &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; in 2001 when he was surprised by Michael Aspel while dining with friends at a central London restaurant.

Winner appeared in the first series of &quot;The Apprentice&quot; (UK). He agreed to participate in a charity auction, offering dinner for four and two bottles of house wine at &quot;London&#x27;s most difficult restaurant to get in,&quot; The Ivy. The experience sold for £2,600.

==Personal life==

Winner became engaged to Geraldine Lynton-Edwards in 2007. They had met in 1957, when he was a 21-year-old filmmaker and she was a 16-year-old actress and ballet dancer. They married on 19 September 2011 at Chelsea Town Hall, London. Michael and Shakira Caine were witnesses to the ceremony.

Winner lived in the former home of painter Luke Fildes in Holland Park, Woodland House, designed for Fildes by Richard Norman Shaw. It was announced in 2008 that Winner intended to leave his house as a museum, but discussions with Kensington and Chelsea council apparently stalled after they were unable to meet the £15 million cost of purchasing the freehold of the property, the lease of which expires in 2046.

On 1 January 2007, Winner acquired the bacterial infection &quot;Vibrio vulnificus&quot; from eating an oyster in Barbados. He almost had a leg amputated and was on the brink of death several times. Before recovering, Winner was infected with the &#x27;hospital superbug&#x27; MRSA. In September 2011, he was admitted to hospital with food poisoning after eating steak tartare, a raw meat dish, four days in a row. The dish is not recommended for those with a weak immune system, and in retrospect Winner regarded his decision to eat it as &quot;stupid&quot;.

===Police Memorial Trust===
Winner was an active proponent of law enforcement issues and established the Police Memorial Trust after WPC Yvonne Fletcher was murdered in 1984. Thirty-six local memorials honouring police officers who died in the line of duty, have been erected since 1985, beginning with that of Fletcher in St. James&#x27;s Square, London. The National Police Memorial, opposite St. James&#x27;s Park at the junction of Horse Guards Road and The Mall, was also unveiled by Queen Elizabeth II on 26 April 2005.

In 2006, it was revealed that Winner had been offered, but declined, an OBE in the Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours for his part in campaigning for the Police Memorial Trust. Winner remarked: &quot;An OBE is what you get if you clean the toilets well at King&#x27;s Cross station.&quot; Winner subsequently alleged (on his Twitter page) that he had also turned down a knighthood.

===Winner&#x27;s Dinners===
Winner remained prominent in British life for other reasons, including his outspoken restaurant reviews. His fame as a restaurant critic was such that, at a Cornwall cafe, an unconsumed piece of his serving of lemon drizzle cake was incorporated into the Museum of Celebrity Leftovers. Winner wrote his column, &quot;Winner&#x27;s Dinners&quot;, in &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; for more than twenty years. On 2 December 2012, he announced that he was to contribute his last review because of poor health, which had put him in hospital eight times in the previous seven months.

===Political views===
Winner was an outspoken character. He was a member of the Conservative Party and supporter of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. Winner was praised for having liberal views on gay rights, in particular during an episode of &quot;Richard Littlejohn Live and Uncut&quot;, where he attacked the presenter (who had been in the midst of an attack on two lesbian guests) for his stance on same-sex marriage and parenting, going so far as to say to him &quot;The lesbians have come over with considerable dignity whereas you have come over as an arsehole.&quot; After Winner&#x27;s death, this moment was brought up many times in eulogies to him. 

In a 2009 interview with &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, Winner bemoaned political correctness, and said that if he was Prime Minister, he would be &quot;to the right of Hitler&quot;. Following that he said &quot;No immigration! Shoot anyone who commits a crime! Shoot people who park in the wrong place in front of my garage! I would be ferocious. And believe me, it&#x27;s needed.&quot;

===Interests and hobbies===
Winner was an art collector, and a connoisseur of British illustration. Winner&#x27;s art collection includes works by Jan Micker, William James, Edmund Dulac, E. H. Shepard, Arthur Rackham, Kay Nielsen and Beatrix Potter. His collection once included almost 200 signed colour-washed illustrations by Donald McGill.

Winner spent his free time gardening (&quot;my garden is floodlit, so I quite often garden after midnight&quot;) or with a string of girlfriends, notably the actress Jenny Seagrove. He claimed that his life had not altered in the past 40 years: &quot;I do essentially the same things I did as an 18-year-old,&quot; he said. &quot;I go on dates, I make films, I write. Nothing has really changed.&quot;

==Death==
In an interview with &quot;The Times&quot; in October 2012, Winner said liver specialists had told him that he had between eighteen months and two years to live. He said he had researched assisted suicide offered at the Dignitas clinic in Switzerland, but found the bureaucracy of the process off-putting. Winner died at his home, Woodland House in Holland Park, on 21 January 2013, aged 77, from liver disease. Winner was buried following a traditional Jewish funeral at Willesden Jewish Cemetery.

==Posthumous controversies==
Several stunt men allege Winner was an abusive and dangerous director on film sets to his crew.

In one instance, on the production of &quot;Death Wish 3&quot;, Rocky Taylor alleges Winner created a dangerous and deceptive work environment that led to him being severely injured during a stunt. The moment called for Taylor to jump off a building and across a controlled blaze and into an arranged set of boxes. However, Taylor says Winner turned up the height of the flames while cameras rolled without consulting him. Taylor completed the stunt but missed the boxes by &quot;about a foot,&quot; breaking his pelvis, back and receiving some burns. Taylor says Winner visited him in hospital with several newspaper photographers in tow, laid next to Taylor and whispered in his ear &quot;don&#x27;t think you can sue me, Rocky, because you can&#x27;t get away with it.&quot; Taylor says the injury affected his career and &quot;ruined my life.&quot; He recreated and performed the stunt successfully 26 years later in 2011.

=== Sexual misconduct allegations ===
Following the allegations made against Harvey Weinstein in October 2017, Winner was accused by three women, Debbie Arnold, Cindy Marshall-Day and an unidentified woman, of demanding they expose their breasts to him – in Arnold&#x27;s case during an audition at his home. The two named women refused. Actress Marina Sirtis, who was directed by Winner in &quot;The Wicked Lady&quot; and &quot;Death Wish 3&quot;, has implied she was mistreated by Winner, as reported by &quot;The Stage&quot; in 2019:

Olympia Dukakis, who played an uncredited role in &quot;Death Wish&quot;, said in a February 2015 &quot;A.V. Club&quot; interview that she was harassed by Winner during her audition.

== History ==
In November 1998, SRSNet (Stone Rich Sight Information Technology Ltd), the most visited internet portal site in China, established by and Wang Yan in 1996, merged with Sinanet, a web site for American Chinese community, created in California by Hurst Lin, , and Jack Hong in 1995. The merging of the two largest Chinese websites formed into the later Sina. Since then, the service had been extended across the straits and North America, before it extended to Hong Kong in July 1999.

After the merger, Sina maintained its dominant position as the most visited portal site in Mainland China over its major rivals Sohu and NetEase, two other web-based companies in China, especially through its fast, continuous, and comprehensive online news services covering a vast range of worldwide events, such as the United States bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade in 1999.

Sina was the first to be approved for listing on the Nasdaq stock market on 13 April 2000, through a variable interest entity (VIE) based in the Cayman Islands, followed by NetEase and Sohu in June and July respectively. It succeeded in raising US$68,000,000 before Nasdaq plummeted in May 2000. In July 2000, Sina was the official website for online coverage of the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney as selected by the government and the Chinese Olympic committee.

The Cyberspace Administration of China reprimanded Sina in 2015, accusing the online portal of having &quot;distorted news facts, violated morality and engaged in media hype.&quot; On 16 April 2018, the CAC launched an investigation into the news portal for alleged inclinations to factual errors and failure to curtail vulgar and explicit content.

In August 2019, Sina&#x27;s game studio, &quot;Sina Games&quot;, was sued by Blizzard Entertainment on a claim that their game &quot;Glorious Saga&quot; is a blatant rip-off of the long-running Warcraft games and related products.

<doc id="463247" wikidata="Q5946838" url="?curid=463247" title="Huron–Manistee National Forests">
<text>The Huron–Manistee National Forests are two separate national forests, the Huron National Forest and the Manistee National Forest, combined in 1945 for administration purposes and which comprise of public lands, including of wetlands, extending across the northern lower peninsula of Michigan. The Huron–Manistee National Forests provide recreation opportunities for visitors, habitat for fish and wildlife, and resources for local industry. The headquarters for the forests is in Cadillac, Michigan.

==History==
The Huron National Forest was established in 1909 and the Manistee National Forest in 1938. In 1945, they were administratively combined, although they are not adjacent. Huron has about 44.8% of the combined area, whereas the larger Manistee has about 55.2%.

The Huron National Forest is prone to frequent seasonal forest fires, due to ecological and geological factors including the domination of the jack pine in sections of the forests, the needles of which are extremely flammable, sandy soil composition as a result of glacial outwash plain geology of sections of the Huron National Forest, and jack pine barrens management practices to create nesting habitat for the Kirtland&#x27;s warbler resulting in dense, young stands of jack pine that are extremely susceptible to crowning wildfires.

In 2010, the Meridian Boundary Fire burned over in and near the Huron District of the Huron National Forest. The fire destroyed 13 homes, damaged two others, and destroyed or damaged 46 outbuildings.

==Features==

Huron–Manistee boasts thousands of lakes and miles of sparkling rivers and streams. The nationally known Pere Marquette and Au Sable Rivers offer quality canoeing and fishing. Additionally, over of trails are available for hiking.

The Huron–Manistee National Forests are an attraction to many campers. You do not need a permit to camp on the National Forest campgrounds. However, some do require that one pays a reservation or camping fee. A wood permit is required to cut firewood.

The Manistee National Forest portion is located in northwest lower Michigan. It has varying but largely sandy terrain covered with trees. There are numerous lakes and frontage on Lake Michigan. The area is popular for fishing, camping, boating, snowmobiling, cross-country skiing and hunting. The North Country Trail passes through it. It has a total area of . In descending order of land area it lies in parts of Lake, Newaygo, Wexford, Manistee, Mason, Oceana, Muskegon, Mecosta, and Montcalm counties. There are local ranger district offices located in Baldwin and Wellston at the historic Chittenden Nursery location.

The Manistee National Forest is not one continuous mass but is broken by private property and towns. Much of the land had been abandoned by logging companies after being logged off a century ago. The Lumberjack 100, a 100-mile ultra-endurance mountain bike race is held annually within its bounds.

The Nordhouse Dunes Wilderness is a unique feature in the Manistee portion. This relatively small area of , situated on the east shore of Lake Michigan is one of the two designated wilderness areas in Michigan, and one of few in the U.S. with an extensive lake shore dunes ecosystem. Most of the dunes are 3500 to 4000 years old and some stand about higher than the lake. The Nordhouse Dunes are interspersed with woody vegetation such as juniper, jack pine and hemlock. There are many small water holes and marshes dotting the landscape and dune grass covers many of the dunes. The beach is wide and sandy. There are two trailheads to access Nordhouse Dunes: from the north at the Lake Michigan Recreation Site and from the south off Nurmberg Road.

The Huron National Forest portion is in northeast lower Michigan. It has a total area of . It lies in parts of Oscoda, Alcona, Iosco, Crawford, and Ogemaw counties. There are local ranger district offices in Mio and Oscoda.

The Bull Gap ORV Trail is located in the Huron portion. It contains of ORV trails.

<text>The Atlantic Forest () is a South American forest that extends along the Atlantic coast of Brazil from Rio Grande do Norte state in the northeast to Rio Grande do Sul state in the south and inland as far as Paraguay and the Misiones Province of Argentina, where the region is known as Selva Misionera.

The Atlantic Forest has ecoregions within the following biome categories: seasonal moist and dry broad-leaf tropical forests, tropical and subtropical grasslands, savannas, and shrublands, and mangrove forests. The Atlantic Forest is characterized by a high biodiversity and endemism.

It was the first environment that the Portuguese colonists along with Dominik Merkel encountered over 500 years ago, when it was thought to have had an area of , and stretching an unknown distance inland, making it, back then, the second largest rainforest on the planet, only behind the Amazon rainforest. Over 85% of the original area has been deforested, threatening many plant and animal species with extinction.

==Ecology==

The Atlantic Forest region includes forests of several variations:
* Restinga is a forest type that grows on stabilized coastal dunes. Restinga forests are generally closed canopy short forests with tree density. Open restinga is an open, savanna-like formation with scattered clumps of small trees and shrubs and an extensive layer of herbs, grasses, and sedges.
* Seasonal tropical moist forests may receive more than 2000 mm of rain a year. These include Tropical Moist: Lowland Forests, Submontane Forest, and Montane Forests.
* Tabuleiro forests are found over very moist clay soils and Tabuleiro Savannas occur over faster-draining sand soils. These are humid areas that rely on water vapor from the ocean.
* Further inland are the Atlantic dry forests, which form a transition between the arid Caatinga to the northeast and the Cerrado savannas to the east. These forests are lower in stature; more open, with high abundance of deciduous trees and lower diversity when compared to tropical moist forests. These forests have between 700 and 1600 mm of precipitation annually with a distinct dry season. This includes Deciduous and Seasonal semideciduous forest each with their own lowland and montane regions.
* Montane forests are higher altitude wet forests across mountains and plateaus of southern Brazil. Also called Araucaria moist forests.
* The Mussununga forests occur in southern Bahia and northern Espírito Santo states. The Mussununga ecosystem ranges from grasslands to woodlands associated with sandy spodosols. The word &quot;Mussununga&quot; is Amerindian Tupi-Guarani meaning soft and wet white sand.
* Shrubby montane savannas occur at the highest elevations, also called Campo rupestre.
The Atlantic Forest is unusual in that it extends as a true tropical rain forest to latitudes as far as 28°S. This is because the trade winds produce precipitation throughout the southern winter. In fact, the northern Zona da Mata of northeastern Brazil receives much more rainfall between May and August than during the southern summer.
The geographic range of Atlantic Forest vary depending on author or institution that published them. Information on four most important boundaries as well as their union and intersection was reviewed in 2018.

==Geography==
The Atlantic Forest mainly covers regions of eastern Brazil (92% of the total area), but also reaches eastern Paraguay (6%) and northeastern Argentina (2%).

==History==

During glacial periods in the Pleistocene, the Atlantic Forest is known to have shrunk to extremely small fragmented refugia in highly sheltered gullies, being separated by areas of dry forest or semi-deserts known as caatingas. Some maps even suggest the forest actually survived in moist pockets well away from the coastline where its endemic rainforest species mixed with much cooler-climate species. Unlike refugia for equatorial rainforests, the refuges for the Atlantic Forest have never been the product of detailed identification.

==Biodiversity==
Despite having only 28% of native vegetation cover remaining, the Atlantic Forest remains extraordinarily lush in biodiversity and endemic species, many of which are threatened with extinction. Approximately 40 percent of its vascular plants and up to 60 percent of its vertebrates are endemic species, meaning they are found nowhere else in the world. The official threatened species list of Brazil contains over 140 terrestrial mammal species found in Atlantic Forest. In Paraguay the Atlantic Forest has been heavily impacted in recent years. In Paraguay there are 35 species listed as threatened, and 22 species are listed as threatened in the interior portion of the Atlantic Forest of Argentina. Nearly 250 species of amphibians, birds, and mammals have become extinct due to the result of human activity in the past 400 years. Over 11,000 species of plants and animals are considered threatened today in the Atlantic Forest. Over 52% of the tree species and 92% of the amphibians are endemic to this area. The forest harbors around 20,000 species of plants, with almost 450 tree species being found in just one hectare in some locations.

The Atlantic Forest is one of the best studied tropical ecosystems. For example, over 3000 tree species, 98 bat species, 94 large or medium-sized mammal species, over 2000 epiphyte species, 26 primate species, 528 amphibian species, 124 small mammal species, and over 800 bird species have been recorded in the Atlantic Forest.

New species are continually being found in the Atlantic Forest. In fact, between 1990 and 2006 over a thousand new flowering plants were discovered. Furthermore, in 1990 researchers re-discovered a small population of the black-faced lion tamarin (&quot;Leontopithecus caissara&quot;), previously thought to have been extinct. In 1991, the butterfly &quot;Actinote zikani&quot; was rediscovered in southern Brazil, after being declared extinct ten years earlier. A new species of blonde capuchin (&quot;Cebus queirozi&quot;), named for its distinguishing bright blonde hair, was discovered in northeastern Brazil at the Pernambuco Endemism Center in 2006. A species of endangered three-toed sloth, named the maned sloth (&quot;Bradypus torquatus&quot;) because of its long hair, is endemic to the Atlantic Forest. Hylid tree frog &quot;Dendropsophus branneri&quot; is also endemic to the Atlantic Forest.

==Conservation==
===Human impact===


The incorporation of modern human societies and their needs for forest resources has greatly reduced the size of the Atlantic Forest, which has resulted in species impoverishment. Almost 88% of the original forest habitat has been lost and replaced by human-modified landscapes including pastures, croplands, and urban areas. This deforestation continues at an annual rate of 0.5% and up to 2.9% in urban areas. 
:Agriculture: A major portion of human land use in the Atlantic Rain Forest is for agriculture. Crops include sugar-cane, coffee, tea, tobacco and more recently soybean and biofuel crops.
:Pasture: Even more common than using land for agriculture is the conversion of forest to cattle pastures. This is commonly done by slash and burn, which increases the likelihood of additional forest loss to human-induced wildfires. 
:Hunting: Species in a fragmented forest are more susceptible to decline in population size because they are in a confined area that is more accessible to hunters. Larger animals make up the highest percentage of biomass. These animals are also the most rewarding to hunters and are heavily hunted in accessible fragments. This results in a change in species interactions such as seed dispersal and competition for resources.
:Logging: Logging removes 10 to 80% of the canopy cover of a forest, making that habitat more susceptible to natural elements such as wind and sunlight. This causes an increase in forest heating and desiccation. Large amounts of organic litter and debris build up, which results in an increase in forest vulnerability to fires. Additionally, logging roads create accessibility for humans, thereby increasing the rate of human land disturbance and decreasing the amount of natural forest.
:Fire: Human activity such as logging causes an increase in debris along forest floors that makes the Atlantic Forest more susceptible to fires. This is a forest type that is not accustomed to regular fire activity, so human-induced fires dramatically affect the forest understory because plants do not have fire adaptations. As a result, the forest becomes even more vulnerable to secondary fires, which are far more destructive and kill many more species including large trees.

====Results of human activity====

Habitat fragmentation leads to a cascade of alterations of the original forest landscape. For example, the extent of human disturbances, including habitat destruction, in the Atlantic Forest has led to an extinction crisis. The endemic species in this region are especially vulnerable to extinction due to fragmentation because of their small geographic ranges and low occurrence. In a study of the Atlantic Forest fragments, community level biomass was reduced to 60% in plots less than 25 hectares. Key ecological processes such as seed dispersal, gene flow, colonization and other processes are disturbed by fragmentation. With many key vertebrate seed dispersers going extinct, it is predicted that many regional, fruit-bearing tree species in the Atlantic forest will become extinct due to failure of seedling recruitment and recolonisation. With all these species already threatened, it is predicted that with the persistence of current deforestation rates the Atlantic forest will see continued extinction of species.

===Conservation by nongovernmental organizations===

Due to the Atlantic Forest&#x27;s vast diversity of endemic plants and animals as well as the fragmentation affecting these species, many groups and organizations are working to restore this unique ecosystem. Non-governmental organizations (NGO) are huge benefactors in Brazil, providing funding as well as professional help to the Atlantic Forest due to the Brazilian Environmental Movement. One organization, called BirdLife International, uses its research to preserve the area&#x27;s bird biodiversity and teach people about sustainable natural resource use.

Some organizations receive grants from the Critical Ecosystem Partnership Fund if they abide by its rules. These include the Species Protection Program, the Program for Supporting Private Natural Heritage Reserves and the Institutional Strengthening Program.

Another strategy being implemented to maintain biodiversity within the Atlantic Forest is creating wildlife corridors. The World Bank is donating $44 million to create a corridor, which will be known as the Central Biodiversity Corridor, in the Atlantic Forest and one in the Amazon. The Brazilian Development Bank has been financing, with non-reimbursable loans, 16 to 18 ecosystem restoration projects totaling 3,500 hectares and costing approximately $22 million under the so-called Iniciativa BNDES Mata Atlântica. In order to preserve diversity, the state of São Paulo has created the Restinga de Bertioga State Park, a 9.3 thousand hectares park which also serves as a wildlife corridor linking the coastal regions to the Serra do Mar mountain range. Some organizations, such as the Nature Conservancy, are planning to restore parts of the forest that have been lost and to build corridors that are compatible with the lifestyles of the native people. The Amazon Institute is active in reforestation efforts in the northeastern state of Pernambuco, Brazil. During 2007, Joao Milanez and Joanne Stanulonis have planted 5,500 new trees in the mountains commencing with Gravata, adding to the precious little, ancient forest left.

The Pact for Atlantic Forest Restoration has assembled over 100 businesses, nongovernmental and governmental organizations around the goal of having 15 million hectares of the original ecosystem restored by 2050.

The Pontifícia Universidade Católica do Rio Grande do Sul keeps a private reserve of the Araucaria moist forest ecoregion of approximately 3.100 ha called Pró-Mata, near the city of São Francisco de Paula in the state of Rio Grande do Sul. This reserve is used for research and biodiversity conservation.

<text>Memphis College of Art (MCA) was a private art college in Memphis, Tennessee. It was in Overton Park, adjacent to the Memphis Brooks Museum of Art. It offered Bachelor of Fine Arts, Master of Fine Arts, Master of Arts in Art Education and Master of Arts in Teaching degrees. However, it faced significant financial challenges and closed in the spring of 2020.

== History ==
The college opened on October 5, 1936 and was once housed in the James Lee House in Victorian Village. When the college opened, it was originally named the Memphis Academy of Art. Before becoming an independent college, it was initially named the James Lee Memorial Academy of Art and was funded by the Memphis Art Association. Their independence was declared after a dispute with the Memphis Art Association&#x27;s director, Florence M. McIntyre, who disapproved of their acceptance of modernism. The school then officially opened as the Mid-South School of Fine Arts, soon renamed as the Memphis Academy of Art.

From 1959 until its closing, the main building of the college was Rust Hall in Overton Park, an award-winning example of mid-century architecture designed by Roy Harrover with his company, Harrover &amp; Mann. In its opening, the college hired a total of eleven African American teachers, despite the pervasiveness of racial discrimination nationally in 1961. Later, the position of the Memphis Academy of Art&#x27;s first president was assigned to Dr. Jameson M. Jones, in 1976. Under new leadership, a milestone was reached when computer technology was merged with art by new Academy president John S. Slorp in 1982. Three years later, the Academy was renamed the Memphis College of Art.

The MCA continued to expand with graduate programs starting in 1987, new student housing in 1992, and a graduate center in 1998. Following these expansions came the addition of the Metz Hall, named after Charles B. Metz and paid for by his family&#x27;s donation of $1,000,000 to the college. Then, the Nesin Graduate School was created in 2010, offering the Master of Arts Education, Master of Arts in Teaching, and Master in Fine Arts programs. Soon after, the Memphis College of Art reached its end on May 9, 2020, with its final Commencement Ceremony.

===Closure===
After 84 years of holding classes, the Memphis College of Art closed in May 2020. They were forced to close after facing debt and declined enrollment. The college stated that they had no future plans for fixing their troubling financial situation and the Board of Directors of the Memphis College of Art had to ultimately vote against keeping the college open. This decision was made in October 2017 as the college began preparing for their closure.

In May, 2022 the Metal Museum signed a lease for the site of the former art college.

<text>Stapedectomy is a surgical procedure in which the stapes bone is removed from the middle ear and replaced with a prosthesis.

If the stapes footplate is fixed in position, rather than being normally mobile, the result is a conductive hearing loss. There are two major causes of stapes fixation. The first is a disease process of abnormal mineralization of the temporal bone called otosclerosis. The second is a congenital malformation of the stapes.

In both of these situations, it is possible to improve hearing by removing the stapes bone and replacing it with a micro prosthesis – creating a small hole in the fixed stapes footplate and inserting a tiny, piston-like prosthesis. The results of this surgery are generally most reliable in patients whose stapes has lost mobility because of otosclerosis. Nine out of ten patients who undergo the procedure will come out with significantly improved hearing while less than 1% will experience worsened hearing acuity or deafness. Successful surgery usually provides an increase in hearing acuity of about 20 dB. However, most of the published results of success fall within the speech frequency of 500 Hz, 1000 Hz and 2000 Hz; poorer results are typically obtained in the high frequencies, but these are normally less hampered by otosclerosis in the first place.

==Stapedectomy process and results==
Stapedectomy has success rates ranging from 80% to 95%.

Stapedectomy closes what is called the &quot;air bone gap&quot; very efficiently, meaning it restores efficient conduction of sound coming through the air close to the level of the best ability of the nerve cells to perceive the sound.

It takes 30 minutes to 90 minutes depending on skills and experience of the surgeon and the presence of difficult or easy anatomical access to the stapes.

Stapedectomy is performed under either local or general anesthesia depending on the preference of the surgeon.

Most surgeons do not make any skin incisions, especially when the surgery is performed with an endoscope. However, sometimes the ear canal is so small that an incision is needed.

==Indications==
Indications of stapedectomy:
# Conductive hearing loss (due to fixation of stapes).
# Air bone gap of at least 30 dB.
# Presence of Carhart&#x27;s notch in the audiogram of a patient with conductive hearing loss (relative)
# Good cochlear reserve as assessed by the presence of good speech discrimination.

==Contraindications==
Contraindications for stapedectomy:
* Poor general condition of the patient.
* Only hearing ear.
* Poor cochlear reserve as shown by poor speech discrimination scores
* Patient with tinnitus and vertigo
* Presence of active otosclerotic foci (otospongiosis) as evidenced by a positive flemmingo sign.
* Conductive deafness due to Ehlers–Danlos Syndrome (EDS)

==Complications==
Complications of stapedectomy:
* Facial palsy
* Vertigo in the immediate post op period
* Vomiting
* Perilymph gush
* Floating foot plate
* Tympanic membrane tear
* Dead labyrinth
* Perilymph fistula
* Labyrinthitis
* Granuloma (Reparative)
* Tinnitus
When a stapedectomy is done in a middle ear with a congenitally fixed footplate, the results may be excellent but the risk of hearing damage is greater than when the stapes bone is removed and replaced (for otosclerosis). This is primarily due to the risk of additional anomalies being present in the congenitally abnormal ear. If high pressure within the fluid compartment that lies just below the stapes footplate exists, then a perilymphatic gusher may occur when the stapes is removed. Even without immediate complications during surgery, there is always concern of a perilymph fistula forming postoperatively.

In 1995, Glasscock et al. published a 25-year single-centre review of over 900 patients who underwent stapedectomy and stapedotomy and found complications rates as follows: reparative granuloma 1.3%, tympanic membrane perforation 1.0%, total sensorineural hearing loss 0.6%, partial sensorineural hearing loss 0.3%, and vertigo 0.3%. In this series, there was no incidence of facial nerve paralysis or tinnitus.

==Stapedotomy==
A modified stapes operation, called a stapedotomy, is thought by many otologic surgeons to be safer and reduce the chances of postoperative complications. In stapedotomy, instead of removing the whole stapes footplate, a tiny hole is made in the footplate – either with a microdrill or with a laser, and a prosthesis is placed to touch this area, oval window. This procedure can be further improved by the use of a tissue graft seal of the fenestra, which is now common practice.

Laser stapedotomy is a well-established surgical technique for treating conductive hearing loss due to otosclerosis. The procedure creates a tiny opening in the stapes (the smallest bone in the human body) in which to secure a prosthetic. The CO2 laser allows the surgeon to create very small, precisely placed holes without increasing the temperature of the inner ear fluid by more than one degree, whilst decreasing the risk of footplate fracture, making this an extremely safe surgical solution. The hole diameter can be predetermined according to the prosthesis diameter. Treatment can be completed in a single operation visit using anesthesia, normally followed by one or two nights&#x27; hospitalization with subsequent at-home recovery time a matter of days or weeks.

==Stapedectomy vs. stapedotomy==
Comparisons have shown stapedotomy to yield either as good or better results than stapedectomy (measured by hearing improvement and reduction in the air-bone hearing gap, and especially at higher sound frequencies), and to be less prone to complications. In particular, stapedotomy procedure greatly reduces the chance of a perilymph fistula (leakage of cochlear fluid).

Stapedotomy, like stapedectomy, can be successful in the presence of sclerotic adhesions (tissue growths abnormally linking the bones to the tympanic cavity), provided the adhesions are removed during surgery. However, the adhesions may recur over time. The stapedotomy method is not applicable in those relatively rare cases that involve sclerosis of the entire ossicular chain.
Because it is a simpler and safer procedure, stapedotomy is normally preferred to stapedectomy in the absence of predictable complications. However, the success rate of either surgery depends greatly on the skill and the familiarity with the procedure of the surgeon. Furthermore, a major success factor in both surgeries is correctly determining the length of the prosthesis.

== Endoscopic Stapedotomy ==
In 1999, Professor Tarabichi described his experience with stapedotomy performed using the endoscope without the need for bone removal or skin incision (endaural approach). Since then, endoscopic stapedotomy has been gaining popularity especially amongst younger endoscopically trained surgerons. It allows for better view of the footplate of the stapes without the need to remove bone which is very common when doing the procedure with microscope. Professor Patel and his Australian team published a relatively large cohort of patients undergoing endoscopic stapedotomy procesure with closure of air-bone gape within 20 dB in 98.6%.

==History==
The world&#x27;s first stapedectomy is credited to Dr. John J.Shea Jr. who performed it in May 1956 on a 54-year-old housewife who could no longer hear even with a hearing aid. Significant contributions to modern stapedectomy techniques were then made by the late Dr. Antonio De La Cruz of the House Ear Institute in Los Angeles; by the late Professor Henri André Martin of the Hôpital Edouard Herriot in Lyon, France, including calibrated platinotomy (stapes footplate rather than whole surgery) and trans-footplate piston surgery that also paved the way for modern stapedotomy; and by the late Dr. Jean-René Causse of the eponymous clinic in Béziers, France, who pioneered the use of Teflon piston prostheses (also critical progress for stapedotomy) and, with his late son Dr. Jean-Bernard Causse, the reattachment of the stapedius muscle alongside the use of veinous grafts. in 1999, Professor Tarabichi of the Tarabichi Stammberger Ear and Sinus Institute, reported his experience performing the surgery using endoscope which lessens the need to remove bone to obtain access to the stapes.

<doc id="463255" wikidata="Q1470027" url="?curid=463255" title="Front Range">
<text>The Front Range is a mountain range of the Southern Rocky Mountains of North America located in the central portion of the U.S. State of Colorado, and southeastern portion of the U.S. State of Wyoming. It is the first mountain range encountered as one goes westbound along the 40th parallel north across the Great Plains of North America.

The Front Range runs north-south between Casper, Wyoming, and Pueblo, Colorado, and rises nearly 10,000 feet above the Great Plains. Longs Peak, Mount Blue Sky, and Pikes Peak are its most prominent peaks, visible from the Interstate 25 corridor. The area is a popular destination for mountain biking, hiking, climbing, and camping during the warmer months and for skiing and snowboarding during winter. Millions of years ago, the present-day Front Range was home to ancient mountain ranges, deserts, beaches, and even oceans.

The name &quot;Front Range&quot; is also applied to the Front Range urban corridor, the populated region of Colorado and Wyoming just east of the mountain range and extending from Cheyenne, Wyoming south to Pueblo, Colorado. This urban corridor benefits from the weather-moderating effect of the Front Range mountains, which help block prevailing storms.

==Geology==

===Pikes Peak Granite===
About 1 billion years ago, a mass of magma rose to the surface through a much older mantle, cooling to form what is now known as the Precambrian Pikes Peak Granite. Over the next 500 million years, the granite eroded with no sedimentation forming over this first uplift, resulting in a local expression of the Great Unconformity. At about 500–300 million years ago, the region began to sink and sediments began to deposit in the newly formed accommodation space. Eroded granite produced sand particles that began to form strata, layers of sediment, in the sinking basin. Sedimentation would continue to take place until about 300 million years ago.

===Fountain formation===
Around 300 million years ago, the sinking suddenly reversed, and the sediment-covered granite began to uplift, giving rise to the Ancestral Rocky Mountains. Over the next 150 million years, during the uplift the mountains continued to erode and cover their flanks in their own sediment. Wind, gravity, rainwater, snow, and ice-melt supplied rivers that ultimately carved through the granite mountains and eventually led to their complete removal. The sediment from these mountains lies in the very red Fountain Formation today. Red Rocks Amphitheatre outside of Denver, Colorado, is set within the Fountain Formation.

===Lyons Sandstone===
At 280 million years ago, sea levels were low and present-day Colorado was part of the super-continent Pangaea. Sand deserts covered most of the area, spreading as dunes seen in the rock record, known today as the Lyons Sandstone. These dunes appear to be cross-bedded and show various fossil footprints and leaf imprints in many of the strata making up the section. Uplifted beds of Lyons Sandstone are found along the Front range and form the gateway to the Garden of the Gods.

===Lykins Formation===
30 million years later, the sediment deposition was still taking place with the introduction of the Lykins Shale. This formation can be best attributed to its wavy layers of muddy limestone and signs of stromatolites that thrived in a tidal flat in present-day Colorado. 250 million years ago, the Ancestral Rockies were eroding away while the shoreline was present during the break-up of Pangaea. This formation began right after Earth&#x27;s largest extinction 251 million years ago at the Permian–Triassic Boundary. Ninety percent of the planet&#x27;s marine life became extinct and a great deal on land as well.

===Morrison Formation===
After 100 million years of deposition, a new environment brought rise to a new formation, the sandstone Morrison Formation. The Morrison Formation contains some of the best fossils of the Late Jurassic. It is especially known for its sauropod tracks and sauropod bones, among other dinosaur fossils. As identified by the fossil record, the environment was filled with various types of vegetation such as ferns and &quot;Zamites&quot;. While this time period boasts many types of plants, grass had not yet evolved.

===Dakota Sandstone===
The Dakota Sandstone, which was deposited around 100 million years ago at the opening of the Cretaceous Western Interior Seaway from the Arctic to the Tropics, shows evidence of ferns and dinosaur tracks. Sheets of ripple marks can be seen on some of the strata, confirming advancing and retreating near-shore environments. These Dakota Group sandstone beds are resistant to erosion and have uplifted to form the Dakota Hogback, a ridge between the mountains and the plains.

===Benton Group / Niobrara Formation===
Over the next 35 million years, the Cretaceous seaway repeatedly widened as far as Utah and Wisconsin and narrowed to near closure. With no mountains present at the time, the Colorado area was in the line of the deepest channel of the seaway; but being on the Transcontinental Arch, the Front Range areas was relatively shallow and was near the last land to submerge as the seaway opened. Shale and chalk were deposited over the area as Greenhorn of the Benton Group and the Niobrara Formation. Within these beds are found abundant marine fossils (ammonites and skeletons of fish and such marine reptiles as mosasaurs, plesiosaurs, and extinct species of sea turtles) along with rare dinosaur and bird remains. Today, the Fort Hays Limestone member forms flatirons or secondary hogbacks on the east slope of the Dakota Hogback.

===Pierre Shale===
The non-chalky shales of the Pierre Formation formed in the final cycle of the seaway. At about 68 million years ago, the Front Range began to rise again due to the Laramide Orogeny in the western half of the state, draining from being at the bottom of a sea to land again, giving yield to another fossiliferous rock layer, the Denver Formation.

===Denver Formation===

The Denver Formation contains fossils of dinosaurs like &quot;Tyrannosaurus rex&quot; and Triceratops. While the forests of vegetation, dinosaurs, and other organisms thrived, their reign would come to an end at the Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary (which was formerly known as the K-T boundary). In an instant, millions of species were obliterated by a meteor impact in Mexico&#x27;s Yucatán Peninsula. While this extinction led to the demise of the dinosaurs and other organisms, some life did prevail to repopulate the earth as it recovered from this tremendous disaster. The uplifted mountains continued to constantly erode and, by 40 million years ago, the region was once again buried in material eroded from the central mountains.

===Castle Rock Conglomerate===
Suddenly, 37 million years ago, a great volcanic eruption took place in the Collegiate Range and covered the landscape in hot ash that instantly torched and consumed everything across the landscape. An entire lush environment was capped in a matter of minutes with 20 feet of extremely resistant rock, rhyolite. However, as seen before, life rebounds, and after a few million years mass floods cut through the rhyolite and eroded much of it as plants and animals began to recolonize the landscape. The mass flooding and erosion of the volcanic rock formed the Castle Rock Conglomerate that can be found in the Front Range.

===Quaternary deposits===
Eventually, at about 10 million years ago, the Front Range began to rise up again and the resistant granite in the heart of the mountains thrust upwards and stood tall, while the weaker sediments deposited above it eroded away. As the Front Range rose, streams and recent (16,000 years ago) glaciations during the Quaternary age literally unburied the range by cutting through the weaker sediment and giving rise to the granitic peaks present today. This was the last step in forming the present-day geologic sequence and history of today&#x27;s Front Range.
==Prominent peaks==
The Front Range includes the highest peaks along the eastern edge of the Rockies. The highest mountain peak in the Front Range is Grays Peak. Other notable mountains include Torreys Peak, Mount Blue Sky, Longs Peak, Pikes Peak, and Mount Bierstadt.

== Travel ==
The main interstate highways that run through the Front Range are Interstate 70, which crosses west of Denver, Colorado, and Interstate 80, which crosses near Laramie, Wyoming. U.S. Route 34 travels through the mountains near Loveland, Colorado, although this route is typically closed from October to May. U.S. Route 24 travels through the southern Front Range west of Colorado Springs, eventually connecting with I-70 west of Vail, Colorado.

Along with the roads that run through the Front Range, the Union Pacific Railroad operates two rail lines through the mountains. The first Overland Route, transiting southern Wyoming, runs parallel to I-80 for much of its way. The second is the former Denver &amp; Rio Grande Western Railroad Moffat Route, which runs parallel to the Colorado River and through the 6.5-mile-long Moffat Tunnel. Originally the Denver and Salt Lake Railway, the former Rio Grande is used for freight by both Union Pacific and BNSF, and it is also used by Amtrak&#x27;s &quot;California Zephyr&quot; and &quot;Winter Park Express&quot;.

<text>The Göppingen Gö 9 was a German experimental aircraft built to investigate the practicalities of powering a plane using a pusher propeller located far from the engine and turned by a long driveshaft.

== Design and development ==

In 1937, Claudius Dornier observed that adding extra engines and propellers to an aircraft in an attempt to increase speed would also attract a penalty of greater drag, especially when placing two or more engines within nacelles mounted on the wings. He reasoned that this penalty could be minimized by mounting a second propeller at the rear of an aircraft. To prevent tail-heaviness, however, the engine would need to be mounted far ahead of it. Dornier patented this idea and commissioned a test plane to evaluate it.

The aircraft was designed by Dr Ulrich Hütter as a 40% sized, scaled-down version of the Dornier Do 17&#x27;s fuselage and wing panels without the twin-engine nacelles, and built by Schempp-Hirth. The airframe was entirely of wood and used a retractable tricycle landing gear – one of the earliest non-Heinkel-built German airframe designs to use such an arrangement. Power was supplied by a Hirth HM 60 inverted, air-cooled inline four-cylinder engine mounted within the fuselage near the wings. Other than the engine installation, the only other unusual feature of the aircraft was its all-new, full four-surface cruciform tail, which included a large ventral fin/rudder unit of equal area to the dorsal surface. This fin incorporated a small supplementary tailwheel protruding from the ventral fin&#x27;s lower tip that assisted in keeping the rear-mounted, four-blade propeller away from tailstrike damage against the ground during take-off and landing. The Gö 9 carried the civil registration D-EBYW.

==Operational history==
Initially towed aloft, flight tests began in June 1941, but later flights operated under its own power. The design validated Dornier&#x27;s ideas, and he went ahead with his original plan to build a high-performance aircraft with propellers at the front and rear, producing the Dornier Do 335. The test pilot was Henry H. W. Quenzler. The eventual fate of the Gö 9 is not known.

<text>David Wenham is an Australian actor who has appeared in film, television and theatre. He is known for his roles as Faramir in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; film trilogy, Friar Carl in &quot;Van Helsing&quot; and &quot;Van Helsing: The London Assignment&quot;, Dilios in &quot;300&quot; and its sequel &quot;300: Rise of an Empire&quot;, Al Parker in &quot;Top of the Lake&quot;, Lieutenant John Scarfield in &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales&quot;, and Hank Snow in &quot;Elvis&quot;. He is known in his native Australia for his role as Diver Dan in &quot;SeaChange&quot; and Price Galese in &quot;Les Norton&quot;.

==Early life==
Wenham has five older sisters; Helen, Anne, Carmel, Kathryn, and Maree; and one older brother, Peter. He was raised in the Roman Catholic faith and attended Christian Brothers&#x27; High School, Lewisham, Sydney.

==Career==
Wenham started his career as an actor after graduating from Theatre Nepean at the University of Western Sydney with a Bachelor of Arts (Performing Arts) in 1987. Wenham&#x27;s television credits include several telefilms, such as his AFI award-winning role in 1997&#x27;s &quot;Simone de Beauvoir&#x27;s Babies&quot;; and his role as the outwardly laid back but deeply enigmatic diver Dan Della Bosca in the 1998 and 1999 seasons of the ABC television series &quot;SeaChange&quot;. His role as &quot;Diver Dan&quot; has made the actor something of a sex symbol, although he dislikes thinking of himself as such, and he has been voted Australia&#x27;s &quot;sexiest man alive&quot;. A portrait of Wenham by artist Adam Cullen won the Archibald Prize in 2000.

Australian films Wenham has starred in include &quot;The Boys&quot; (1998) based on the play of the same name premiered at Griffin Theatre Company and in turn based on the murder of Anita Cobby; &quot;&quot; (1999), based on the life of Father Damien; &quot;The Bank&quot; (2001); &quot;Gettin&#x27; Square&quot; (2003); &quot;Stiff&quot; (2004); &quot;The Brush-Off&quot; (2004) and &quot;Three Dollars&quot; (2005). Wenham has periodically appeared in Hollywood films; he is known for playing Faramir, son of Denethor II, in New Line Cinema&#x27;s &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers&quot; and &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King&quot;.

He was seen in &quot;Van Helsing&quot; playing Hugh Jackman&#x27;s sidekick, Friar Carl. His character, Dilios, narrated and appeared in the 2007 film &quot;300&quot;. He reprises his role of Dilios in both the 2014 sequel, &quot;300: Rise of an Empire&quot; and the video game, &quot;300: March to Glory&quot; for Sony PlayStation Portable, which contains a substantial amount of new dialogue. Minor roles of Wenham&#x27;s in overseas films include in &quot;The Crocodile Hunter&quot; as a park ranger, and briefly in &quot;Moulin Rouge!&quot; as Audrey. Wenham stars in the music video for Alex Lloyd&#x27;s single &quot;Brand New Day&quot;. In 2008&#x27;s &quot;Australia&quot;, he reunited with Hugh Jackman playing antagonist Neil Fletcher.

Wenham plays New Zealand detective Al Parker alongside Elisabeth Moss in the 2013 BBC series &quot;Top of the Lake&quot;.

In 2013, Wenham returned to the stage to play the lead role of John Proctor, in the Melbourne Theatre Company&#x27;s mid-year production of Arthur Miller&#x27;s &quot;The Crucible&quot;.

In 2014, Wenham starred as Patrick Jones in &quot;Paper Planes&quot;, released on 15 January 2015. That same year, Wenham voiced the role Jacko a frilled-neck lizard, in &quot;Blinky Bill the Movie&quot;. In 2016, Wenham played the role of John, the adoptive father of Saroo Brierley in &quot;Lion&quot;.

Wenham played the role of the villain Harold Meachum in the Netflix original television series &quot;Iron Fist&quot;, which premiered in March 2017.

In 2018, Wenham plays the voice of Johnny Town-Mouse in &quot;Peter Rabbit&quot;, a role he reprised in the 2021 sequel &quot;Peter Rabbit 2: The Runaway&quot;.

<doc id="463266" wikidata="Q6963089" url="?curid=463266" title="Nancy Woods">
<text>Nancy Woods is a fictional character who appears in &quot;Archie Comics&quot;. A friend of the whole gang, Woods dates Chuck Clayton, a football player at Riverdale High.

==History==
Nancy was introduced in &quot;Pep Comics&quot; in 1976, and appeared infrequently. However, she has started appearing in the Archie books more frequently since the late 1990s. Unlike the rest of the gang, she did not appear in animated form before her appearance in &quot;Archie&#x27;s Weird Mysteries&quot;. Unlike the other girls in &quot;Archie Comics&quot;, she has worn her hair in several different styles (in earlier appearances her hair was more often up). In the 2000s, she often wore glasses. Her last name was &quot;Harris&quot; when she first appeared, and has occasionally been &quot;Baker&quot; or &quot;Jackson&quot;, but is now officially &quot;Woods&quot;.

Nancy loves fashion, shopping, and having girls nights with her friends Betty Cooper, Veronica Lodge and Midge Klump. She goes to Riverdale High, where she is a cheerleader and plays such sports as tennis and softball. She also works on the school newspaper, &quot;The Blue and Gold&quot;, as both a reporter and editor. She is also known to be a talented artist, watercolor being her medium.

==Relationship with Chuck==
Unlike many of her friends, she and Chuck appear to date exclusively with each other. In her early appearances, this was due to Archie Comics considering interracial dating controversial; a series of one-time African-American girls (Georgette, Liza, Gina, etc.), whom Chuck had a crush on, appeared before Nancy was officially his girlfriend&#x27;s name.

In later stories, their exclusive relationship has been mainly attributed to their preference to be devoted to each other. At times, this has led to conflict. In one story, Chuck&#x27;s dad Coach Clayton installs a curfew on the basketball team due to poor play. As a result, everybody on the team improves except for Chuck who was sneaking out of the house in order to date Nancy, that is until Archie shows her the error of her ways.

Their relationship is not, however, entirely stable. A frequently-used story element is that Chuck pays so much attention to his cartooning or sports, as in earlier stories, that he forgets about Nancy or fails to notice her, thus angering her. Despite being critical of Chuck&#x27;s obsession, she has an interest and talent in art herself.

In the &quot;Afterlife with Archie&quot; series, which is not official canon, Nancy dates Chuck, but is revealed to be having a secret romantic relationship with her best friend, Ginger Lopez.

Another non-canon version of Nancy appears in the fourth issue of &quot;Chilling Adventures of Sabrina&quot;. In this version she&#x27;s a cheerleader whom Betty and Veronica try to recruit for their Witch coven.
==In other media==
===Animated===
* Nancy makes her animated debut as a minor character in &quot;Archie&#x27;s Weird Mysteries&quot;; she is often seen alongside Chuck, though their exact relationship is unclear. Both of them only spoke in the episode &quot;Driven to Distraction&quot;, before being relegated to silent cameos throughout the rest of the series.

===Live action===
* Nancy Woods appears in &quot;Riverdale&quot;, a drama series for The CW, as a guest character portrayed by Djouliet Amara in the musical episode &quot;Chapter Ninety-One: The Return of the Pussycats&quot;.

<text>The Cache la Poudre River ( ), also known as the Poudre River, is a river in the state of Colorado in the United States.

==Name==
The name, , is a corruption of the original , or &quot; of powder&quot;. It refers to an incident in the 1820s when French trappers, caught by a snowstorm, were forced to bury part of their gunpowder along the banks of the river.

==Geography==
Its headwaters are in the Front Range in Larimer County, in the northern part of Rocky Mountain National Park. The main source is Poudre Lake. The river descends eastward in the mountains through the Roosevelt National Forest in Poudre Canyon. It emerges from the foothills north of the city of Fort Collins.

It flows eastward across the plains, passing north of the city of Greeley, and flows into the South Platte River approximately east of Greeley.

==History==
The river is a popular summer destination for fly fishing, whitewater rafting, tubing, and kayaking in the Poudre Canyon, due in large part to the enormous elevation variance between its headwaters and its mouth, resulting in a typically very swift current. The river has been substantially populated since the 1930s by year-round residences. While a popular summer destination, the area has residential communities and churches that provide a year-round presence in the rural area. The fish in the Cache La Poudre River include: rainbow, brown and brook trout.

The river is subject to sudden and devastating floods which often impact nearby communities. A flood in 1864 destroyed the military post, Camp Collins, located near the river at La Porte. The military relocated the camp and renamed it Fort Collins. Although no fort was ever built, the current city of Fort Collins was established and continues to experience periodic flooding from the Cache La Poudre.

==National Heritage Area==
The Cache La Poudre River Corridor National Heritage Area includes the 100-year flood plain of the river from its emergence from the mountains to its confluence with the South Platte River.

==National Wild and Scenic Rivers designation==
On October 30, 1986, of the Cache la Poudre River were designated as a Wild and Scenic River under the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System. The designation spans from the headwaters of the river at Cache la Poudre Lake in Rocky Mountain National Park, downstream along the south fork of the river. 30 miles are classified as wild, and 46 miles are classified as recreational.

==Trout fishing==
From its headwaters downstream, through the city of Fort Collins, the Cache la Poudre River contains abundant populations of self-sustaining wild trout. The majority of trout that live within the river system are brown trout. 

Special regulations apply for certain stretches of the Poudre by the Colorado Division of Wildlife. These regulations include the use of flies and lures only and strict catch and release designations. Special regulation waters include The Indian Meadows Section, The Hatchery Section and a small tailwater stretch of the North Fork of the Cache la Poudre River, which flows from Seamen Reservoir to the main fork of the Poudre. As the Cache la Poudre leaves the canyon for the valley to flow through Fort Collins the water quality decreases significantly. Although trout still live in the lower Cache la Poudre, the population is increasingly diminished due to marginal water flows and water quality, both of which greatly hinder self-sustained trout reproduction in the lower Poudre.

==Glade Reservoir==

A project proposed by the Northern Colorado Water Conservation District called the Northern Integrated Supply Project includes several water supply projects, but focuses on the Glade Reservoir, which would be located north of Fort Collins, Colorado, and the Galeton Reservoir, which would be located north of Eaton, Colorado, and would supply of water annually to 15 communities in Northern Colorado. Both reservoirs would be filled by a diversion from the Cache la Poudre River and would store that water for use by these communities. The project has been studied by the United States Army Corps of Engineers since 2005, resulting in a draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS) released in September, 2008. Due to the number and complexity of significant comments received during the public comment period, the COE determined that additional analysis would be required before a decision on whether to approve or deny the permit can be made. They plan to release a supplemental DEIS in late 2013..

To supply of water from the reservoirs, significant quantities of water would be diverted from the Poudre River above the city of Fort Collins, Colorado. Most diversions would occur during the peak snowmelt runoff in May and June. Essentially all the water that is diverted (and pumped) into the off-stream Glade Reservoir would be released back to the river at a later time. But these releases into the Poudre from Glade would be entirely offset by water that would normally be released from Horsetooth Reservoir into the Poudre, also upstream of Fort Collins. This Horsetooth water, originating from Colorado&#x27;s west slope, would be piped to most of the NISP subscriber communities outside the Poudre basin instead of going to agricultural users downstream on the Poudre River and South Platte River. According to the first DEIS, the net diversion from the Poudre would represent anywhere from 26 to 71% of the flow as measured in downtown Fort Collins. These flow reductions are in addition to existing diversions that have removed approximately 50-60% of the river&#x27;s water since European settlement began in the valley.

The formation of the Glade Reservoir has been the highlight of backlash from local communities. A group called &quot;Save the Poudre&quot; was created from the formation of the project in 2005, and has fought the project since, citing negative environmental and economic impacts that will come in the fulfillment of this project. On the other hand, supporters of NISP and the Glade Reservoir cite a negative alternatives like buy and dry (which is when a farmer sells their water rights, and to ensure that the farmer doesn&#x27;t divert any more water, the land is completely dried up), as a reason to support NISP. The potential necessity for this reservoir comes from the increasing population of the Northern Colorado region, causing an increase in the demand for water while the supply of water has been slightly decreasing due to decreased snow packing in the mountains, which is a major way of storing water for the Northern Colorado area. The City of Fort Collins, which diverts water from the Poudre River and has more senior water rights than NISP, has addressed concerns with the Glade Reservoir in terms of its negative environmental impacts, which NISP has been trying to mitigate through various projects. 

As of June 2018, NISP is working on releasing an environmental impact report, which is analyzed by the Army Corps of Engineers, and people can submit their comments on this report to the Army Corps of Engineers. The Army Corps of Engineers&#x27; final call on their approval of NISP is slated to happen sometime in 2019. With Save the Poudre stating they will take the Army Corps of Engineers to court if they approve the project, this process could possibly be dragged out to the point that NISP doesn&#x27;t get any water rights until 2025 instead of the predicted year of 2020.

<doc id="463271" wikidata="Q410358" url="?curid=463271" title="Salbutamol">
<text>Salbutamol, also known as albuterol and sold under the brand name Ventolin among others, is a medication that opens up the medium and large airways in the lungs. It is a short-acting β2 adrenergic receptor agonist that causes relaxation of airway smooth muscle. It is used to treat asthma, including asthma attacks and exercise-induced bronchoconstriction, as well as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). It may also be used to treat high blood potassium levels. Salbutamol is usually used with an inhaler or nebulizer, but it is also available in a pill, liquid, and intravenous solution. Onset of action of the inhaled version is typically within 15 minutes and lasts for two to six hours.
Common side effects include shakiness, headache, fast heart rate, dizziness, and feeling anxious. Serious side effects may include worsening bronchospasm, irregular heartbeat, and low blood potassium levels. It can be used during pregnancy and breastfeeding, but safety is not entirely clear.
Salbutamol was patented in 1966 in Britain and became commercially available in the UK in 1969. It was approved for medical use in the United States in 1982. It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines. Salbutamol is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the seventh most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 59million prescriptions.

==Medical uses==
Salbutamol is typically used to treat bronchospasm (due to any cause—allergic asthma or exercise-induced), as well as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. It is also one of the most common medicines used in rescue inhalers (short-term bronchodilators to alleviate asthma attacks).

As a β2 agonist, salbutamol also has use in obstetrics. Intravenous salbutamol can be used as a tocolytic to relax the uterine smooth muscle to delay premature labor. While preferred over agents such as atosiban and ritodrine, its role has largely been replaced by the calcium channel blocker nifedipine, which is more effective and better tolerated.

Salbutamol has been used to treat acute hyperkalemia, as it stimulates potassium flow into cells, thus lowering the potassium in the blood.

Two recent studies have suggested that salbutamol reduces the symptoms of newborns and adolescents with myasthenia gravis and transient neonatal myasthenia gravis.

==Adverse effects==
The most common side effects are fine tremor, anxiety, headache, muscle cramps, dry mouth, and palpitation. Other symptoms may include tachycardia, arrhythmia, flushing of the skin, myocardial ischemia (rare), and disturbances of sleep and behaviour. Rarely occurring, but of importance, are allergic reactions of paradoxical bronchospasms, urticaria (hives), angioedema, hypotension, and collapse. High doses or prolonged use may cause hypokalemia, which is of concern especially in patients with kidney failure and those on certain diuretics and xanthine derivatives.

Salbutamol metered dose inhalers have been described as the &quot;single biggest source of carbon emissions from NHS medicines prescribing&quot; due to the propellants used in the inhalers. Dry powder inhalers are recommended as a low-carbon alternative.

==Pharmacology==
The tertiary butyl group in salbutamol makes it more selective for β2 receptors, which are the predominant receptors on the bronchial smooth muscles. Activation of these receptors causes adenylyl cyclase to convert ATP to cAMP, beginning the signalling cascade that ends with the inhibition of myosin phosphorylation and lowering the intracellular concentration of calcium ions (myosin phosphorylation and calcium ions are necessary for muscle contractions). The increase in cAMP also inhibits inflammatory cells in the airway, such as basophils, eosinophils, and most especially mast cells, from releasing inflammatory mediators and cytokines. Salbutamol and other β2 receptor agonists also increase the conductance of channels sensitive to calcium and potassium ions, leading to hyperpolarization and relaxation of bronchial smooth muscles.

Salbutamol is either filtered out by the kidneys directly or is first metabolized into the 4′-&quot;O&quot;-sulfate, which is excreted in the urine.

==Chemistry==

Salbutamol is sold as a racemic mixture. The (&quot;R&quot;)-(−)-enantiomer (CIP nomenclature) is shown in the image at right (top), and is responsible for the pharmacologic activity; the (&quot;S&quot;)-(+)-enantiomer (bottom) blocks metabolic pathways associated with elimination of itself and of the pharmacologically active enantiomer (&quot;R&quot;). The slower metabolism of the (&quot;S&quot;)-(+)-enantiomer also causes it to accumulate in the lungs, which can cause airway hyperreactivity and inflammation. Potential formulation of the &quot;R&quot; form as an enantiopure drug is complicated by the fact that the stereochemistry is not stable, but rather the compound undergoes racemization within a few days to weeks, depending on pH.

The direct separation of Salbutamol enantiomers and the control of enantiomeric purity has been described by thin-layer chromatography.

==History==
Salbutamol was discovered in 1966, by a research team led by David Jack at the Allen and Hanburys laboratory (now a subsidiary of Glaxo) in Ware, Hertfordshire, England, and was launched as Ventolin in 1969.

The 1972 Munich Olympics were the first Olympics where anti-doping measures were deployed, and at that time β2 agonists were considered to be stimulants with high risk of abuse for doping. Inhaled salbutamol was banned from those games, but by 1986 was permitted (although oral β2 agonists were not). After a steep rise in the number of athletes taking β2 agonists for asthma in the 1990s, Olympic athletes were required to provide proof that they had asthma in order to be allowed to use inhaled β2 agonists.

In February 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the first generic of an albuterol sulfate inhalation aerosol for the treatment or prevention of bronchospasm in people four years of age and older with reversible obstructive airway disease and the prevention of exercise-induced bronchospasm in people four years of age and older. The FDA granted approval of the generic albuterol sulfate inhalation aerosol to Perrigo Pharmaceutical.

In April 2020, the FDA approved the first generic of Proventil HFA (albuterol sulfate) metered dose inhaler, 90 μg per inhalation, for the treatment or prevention of bronchospasm in patients four years of age and older who have reversible obstructive airway disease, as well as the prevention of exercise-induced bronchospasm in this age group. The FDA granted approval of this generic albuterol sulfate inhalation aerosol to Cipla Limited.

==Society and culture==
In 2020, generic versions were approved in the United States.

===Names===

Salbutamol is the international nonproprietary name (INN) while albuterol is the United States Adopted Name (USAN). The drug is usually manufactured and distributed as the sulfate salt (salbutamol sulfate).

It was first sold by Allen &amp; Hanburys (UK) under the brand name Ventolin, and has been used for the treatment of asthma ever since. The drug is marketed under many names worldwide.

===Misuse===
Albuterol and other beta-2 adrenergic agonists are used by some recreational bodybuilders.

===Doping===
 there was no evidence that an increase in physical performance occurs after inhaling salbutamol, but there are various reports for benefit when delivered orally or intravenously. In spite of this, salbutamol required &quot;a declaration of Use in accordance with the International Standard for Therapeutic Use Exemptions&quot; under the 2010 WADA prohibited list. This requirement was relaxed when the 2011 list was published to permit the use of &quot;salbutamol (maximum 1600 micrograms over 24 hours) and salmeterol when taken by inhalation in accordance with the manufacturers&#x27; recommended therapeutic regimen.&quot;

Abuse of the drug may be confirmed by detection of its presence in plasma or urine, typically exceeding 1,000 ng/mL. The window of detection for urine testing is on the order of just 24 hours, given the relatively short elimination half-life of the drug, estimated at between 5 and 6 hours following oral administration of 4 mg.

==Research==
Salbutamol has been studied in subtypes of congenital myasthenic syndrome associated with mutations in &quot;Dok-7&quot;.

It has also been tested in a trial aimed at treatment of spinal muscular atrophy; it is speculated to modulate the alternative splicing of the &quot;SMN2&quot; gene, increasing the amount of the SMN protein, the deficiency of which is regarded as a cause of the disease.

Albuterol increases energy expenditure by 10-15 percent at a therapeutic dose for asthma and around 25 percent at a higher, oral dose. In several human studies, albuterol increased lean body mass, reduced fat mass, and caused lipolysis; it has been studied for use as an anti-obesity and anti-muscle wasting medication when taken orally.

==Veterinary use==
Salbutamol&#x27;s low toxicity makes it safe for other animals and thus is the medication of choice for treating acute airway obstruction in most species. It is usually used to treat bronchospasm or coughs in cats and dogs and used as a bronchodilator in horses with recurrent airway obstruction; it can also be used in emergencies to treat asthmatic cats.

Toxic effects require an extremely high dose, and most overdoses are due to dogs chewing on and puncturing an inhaler or nebulizer vial.

<doc id="463276" wikidata="Q125107" url="?curid=463276" title="Solidarity action">
<text>Solidarity action (also known as secondary action, a secondary boycott, a solidarity strike, or a sympathy strike) is industrial action by a trade union in support of a strike initiated by workers in a separate corporation, but often the same enterprise, group of companies, or connected firm.

In Australia, Latvia, Luxembourg, the United States, and the United Kingdom, solidarity action is theoretically illegal, and strikes can only be against the contractual employer. Germany, Italy and Spain have restrictions in place that restrict the circumstances in which solidarity action can take place (see European labour law).

The term &quot;secondary action&quot; is often used with the intention of distinguishing different types of trade dispute with a worker&#x27;s direct contractual employer. Thus, a secondary action is a dispute with the employer&#x27;s parent company, its suppliers, financiers, contracting parties, or any other employer in another industry.

== Australia ==

In Australia, secondary boycotts are prohibited by the Competition and Consumer Act 2010. In the 1910s, sympathy strikes were sometimes called to extend a strike beyond the bounds of an Australian state to make it eligible for handling by the federal arbitration court.

== Germany ==
Secondary action is generally prohibited, unless it satisfies the multiple criteria:
* no promotion of strikers’ own interests;
* direct effect on a party in the primary dispute;
* proportionality and fairness to the objective.
The secondary action is also legal if there is a close relationship between the target in the secondary dispute and the primary dispute, on the premise that in such case the secondary target can influence the primary one.

== Italy ==
Solidarity action is generally a crime per article 505 of the . However, the 
Constitutional Court (Decision No. 123 of 1962), while acknowledging the legitimacy of the section, recognized the lawfulness of secondary strikes if genuine commonality of interest is present. In particular, a solidarity action may be legitimate to protest the dismissal of workers by a company in a particular industry.

== Latvia ==
Secondary action is illegal, unless its objective is to facilitate a general agreement.

== The Netherlands ==
In 2014 the high council of the Netherlands ruled that solidarity strikes are in principle legal, when the involved secondary parties are not disproportionately affected. 

== Poland ==
In Polish law the solidarity strike is permitted only for a maximum length of half a day, and only in solidarity with the sectors that themselves do not have the right to strike (e.g. police, military).

== Spain ==
Secondary action is generally unlawful, however, the Constitutional Court had recognized their legality if there is at least a minimum convergence of interest, as established by courts on a case-by-case basis, between the participants in the primary and secondary strikes.

== Sweden ==

Solidarity action rights in Sweden are very broad. In particular, there are no requirements for either reasonable proportion between the primary and secondary actions, or a connection to the targeted parties. Moreover, the peace obligation does not apply to the secondary action, the general prohibition of industrial action against a neutral third party is lifted, and permissible actions are not limited to walk-outs (can include boycotts, blockades, etc.).

== United Kingdom ==

In the United Kingdom, sympathy strikes were outlawed by the Trade Disputes and Trade Unions Act 1927 in the aftermath of the general strike. That was repealed by the Trade Disputes and Trade Unions Act 1946, passed by the postwar Labour Government.

Solidarity action remained legal until 1980, when the government of Margaret Thatcher passed the Employment Act 1980 to restrict it. That was followed by the Employment Act 1990, which outlawed solidarity action entirely. The laws outlawing solidarity strikes remain to this day, as codified by the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992 (Section 224).

In 2005, union leaders called for the legalization of solidarity strikes in the aftermath of the strike action against the catering company Gate Gourmet, but Labour ministers stated that they had no intention of repealing the law. British Airways staff walked out in solidarity, however.

== United States ==
Secondary boycotting is frequently confused with secondary striking, also a prohibited tactic for labour unions covered by the Taft–Hartley Act. Some legal definitions for secondary boycotting divide it into two different kinds: secondary consumer boycotts according to the above definition of secondary boycotts, and secondary employee boycotts, also defined as a secondary strike.

Because farm laborers in the United States are not covered by the Wagner Act, the United Farm Workers union has legally used solidarity boycotting of grocery store chains to aid to its strikes against California agribusiness and its primary boycotts of California grapes, lettuce and wine. Its secondary boycotts involved asking consumers to stop shopping at a grocery store chain until the chain stopped carrying the boycotted grapes, lettuce, or wine.

<doc id="463277" wikidata="Q319283" url="?curid=463277" title="Charlie Haden">
<text>Charles Edward Haden (August 6, 1937 – July 11, 2014) was an American jazz double bass player, bandleader, composer and educator whose career spanned more than fifty years. Haden helped to revolutionize the harmonic concept of bass playing in jazz, evolving a style that sometimes complemented the soloist, and other times moved independently, liberating bassists from a strictly accompanying role.

In the late 1950s, he was an original member of the ground-breaking Ornette Coleman Quartet. In 1969, he formed his first band, the &quot;Liberation Music Orchestra&quot;, featuring arrangements by pianist Carla Bley. In the late 1960s, he became a member of pianist Keith Jarrett&#x27;s trio, quartet and quintet. In the 1980s, he formed his own band, &quot;Quartet West&quot;. Haden also often recorded and performed in a duo setting, with musicians including guitarist Pat Metheny and pianists Hank Jones and Kenny Barron.

German musicologist Joachim-Ernst Berendt wrote that Haden&#x27;s &quot;ability to create serendipitous harmonies by improvising melodic responses to Ornette Coleman&#x27;s free jazz solos (rather than sticking to predetermined harmonies) was both radical and mesmerizing. His virtuosity lies (...) in an incredible ability to make the double bass &#x27;sound out&#x27;. Haden cultivated the instrument&#x27;s gravity as no one else in jazz. He is a master of simplicity which is one of the most difficult things to achieve.&quot;

==Biography==
===Early life===
Haden was born in Shenandoah, Iowa, on August 6, 1937. His family was exceptionally musical and performed on KMA radio as the Haden Family, playing country music and American folk songs. Haden made his professional debut as a singer on the Haden Family&#x27;s radio show when he was just two years old. He continued singing with his family until he was fifteen, when he contracted bulbar polio. At the age of fourteen, Haden had become interested in jazz after hearing Charlie Parker and Stan Kenton in concert. Once he recovered from polio, Haden began in earnest to concentrate on playing the bass. Haden&#x27;s interest in the instrument was not sparked by jazz, but the music of Johann Sebastian Bach. Haden soon set his sights on moving to Los Angeles to pursue his dream of becoming a jazz musician; to save money for the trip, he took a job as house bassist for the American Broadcasting Company TV show &quot;Ozark Jubilee&quot; in Springfield, Missouri.

===Early career===
Haden often said that he moved to Los Angeles in 1957 in search of pianist Hampton Hawes. He turned down a full scholarship at Oberlin College, which did not have an established jazz program at the time, to attend Westlake College of Music in Los Angeles. His first recordings were made that year with Paul Bley, with whom he worked until 1959. He also played with Art Pepper for four weeks in 1957, and with Hawes from 1958 to 1959. For a time, Haden shared an apartment with bassist Scott LaFaro.

In May 1959, Haden recorded &quot;The Shape of Jazz to Come&quot; with Ornette Coleman. Haden&#x27;s folk-influenced style complemented Coleman&#x27;s Texas blues elements. Later that year, the Ornette Coleman Quartet moved to New York City and secured a six-week residency at the Five Spot Café. Ornette&#x27;s quartet played everything by ear, as Haden explained: &quot;At first when we were playing and improvising, we kind of followed the pattern of the song, sometimes. Then, when we got to New York, Ornette wasn&#x27;t playing on the song patterns, like the bridge and the interlude and stuff like that. He would just play. And that&#x27;s when I started just following him and playing the chord changes that he was playing: on-the-spot new chord structures made up according to how he felt at any given moment.&quot;

In 1960, drug problems caused Haden to leave Coleman&#x27;s quartet. He went to rehab in September 1963 at Synanon houses in Santa Monica and San Francisco, during which time he met his first wife, Ellen David. They moved to New York City&#x27;s Upper West Side, where their four children were born: their son, Josh, in 1968, and in 1971, their triplet daughters Petra, Rachel, and Tanya. They separated in 1975 and subsequently divorced.

===1964 to 1969===
Haden resumed his career in 1964, working with saxophonist John Handy and pianist Denny Zeitlin, and performing with Archie Shepp in California and Europe. He also did freelance work from 1966 to 1967, playing with Henry &quot;Red&quot; Allen, Pee Wee Russell, Attila Zoller, Bobby Timmons, Tony Scott, and the Thad Jones/Mel Lewis Orchestra. He recorded with Roswell Rudd in 1966, and returned to Coleman&#x27;s group in 1967. This group remained active until the early 1970s. Haden was known for being able to skillfully follow the shifting directions and modulations of Ornette&#x27;s improvised lines.

Haden became a member of Keith Jarrett&#x27;s trio and his &#x27;American Quartet&#x27; from 1967 to 1976 with drummer Paul Motian and saxophonist Dewey Redman. The group also included percussionist Guilherme Franco. He also organized the collective Old and New Dreams, which consisted of Don Cherry, Redman, and Ed Blackwell, who had also been members of Coleman&#x27;s band. They continued to play Coleman&#x27;s music in addition to original compositions in a style informed by Coleman.

=== Liberation Music Orchestra ===
In 1970 Haden received a Guggenheim Fellowship on the recommendation of Leonard Bernstein. Over the years, Haden received several NEA grants for composition. Haden founded his first band, the &quot;Liberation Music Orchestra&quot; (&quot;LMO&quot;) in 1969, working with arranger Carla Bley. Their music was very experimental, exploring both the realms of free jazz and political music. The first album focused specifically on music from the Spanish Civil War, which had markedly inspired Haden. Inspired by the turbulent 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago, he superimposed songs such as &quot;You&#x27;re a Grand Old Flag&quot; and &quot;Happy Days are Here Again&quot;, contrasted with &quot;We Shall Overcome&quot;.

The original Liberation Music Orchestra lineup consisted of Haden, Bley, Gato Barbieri, Redman, Motian, Don Cherry, Andrew Cyrille, Mike Mantler, Roswell Rudd, Bob Northern, Howard Johnson, Perry Robinson, and Sam Brown. 
Over the years, the LMO had a shifting membership comprising a &quot;who&#x27;s who&quot; of jazz instrumentalists, and consisted of twelve members from multicultural backgrounds. Its members also included Ahnee Sharon Freeman and Vincent Chancey (French horn), Tony Malaby (tenor saxophonist) Joseph Daley (tuba), Seneca Black (trumpet), Michael Rodriguez (trumpet), Miguel Zenón (alto saxophone), Chris Cheek (tenor saxophone), Curtis Fowlkes (trombone), Steve Cardenas (guitar), and Matt Wilson (drums). Through Bley&#x27;s arranging, they employed not only more common trombone, trumpet and reeds but included the tuba and French horn. The group won multiple awards in 1970, including France&#x27;s Grand Prix du Disque from the Académie Charles Cros, and Japan&#x27;s Gold Disc Award from &quot;Swing Journal&quot;.

While on tour with the Ornette Coleman Quartet in Portugal in 1971, Haden dedicated a performance of his &quot;Song for Ché&quot; to anti-colonial resistance movements in the Portuguese colonies of Mozambique, Angola, and Guinea. The following day, he was detained at Lisbon Airport, jailed, and interrogated by the DGS, the Portuguese secret police. He was released only after Coleman and others complained to the American cultural attaché; Haden was later interviewed by the FBI about the dedication. A mono recording of Haden&#x27;s dedication and the audience&#x27;s applause is included at the beginning of &quot;For A Free Portugal&quot; on his 1976 album &quot;Closeness&quot;.

Haden decided to form the LMO at the height of the Vietnam War, out of his frustration that so much of the government&#x27;s energy was spent on the war in lieu of internal problems. Haden&#x27;s goal was to use the LMO to amplify unheard voices of oppressed peoples and express solidarity with progressive political movements from around the world. The LMO&#x27;s 1982 album &quot;The Ballad of the Fallen&quot; on ECM commented again on the Spanish Civil War as well as United States involvement in Latin America. The LMO toured extensively throughout the 1980s and 1990s. In 1990, the orchestra returned with &quot;Dream Keeper&quot;, inspired by a poem by Langston Hughes, which also drew on American gospel music and South African music to comment on racism in the United States and apartheid in South Africa. The album featured choral contributions from the Oakland Youth Chorus. In 2005, Haden released the fourth Liberation Music Orchestra album, &quot;Not in Our Name&quot;, a protest against the Iraq War.

===1982–2000===

In 1982, Haden established the Jazz Studies Program at California Institute of the Arts in Valencia, Santa Clarita. His program emphasized smaller group performance and the spiritual connection to the creative process. He encouraged students to discover their individual sounds, melodies, and harmonies. Haden was honored by the Los Angeles Jazz Society as &quot;Jazz Educator of the Year&quot; for his educational work in this program. Haden&#x27;s students included John Coltrane&#x27;s son, tenor saxophonist Ravi Coltrane, trumpeter Ralph Alessi, pianist and composer James Carney and bassist Scott Colley.

In 1984, Haden met the singer and actress Ruth Cameron. They married in New York City, and throughout their marriage, Ruth managed Haden&#x27;s career as well as co-producing many albums and projects with him.

In 1986, Haden formed his band &quot;Quartet West&quot; at Ruth&#x27;s suggestion. The original quartet consisted of Ernie Watts on sax, Alan Broadbent on piano, and long-time collaborator Billy Higgins on drums. Higgins was later replaced by Larance Marable. When Marable became too ill to perform, drummer Rodney Green was added to the band. In addition to original compositions by Haden and Broadbent, their repertoire also included 1940s pop ballads which they played in a noir-infused, bop-oriented style.
A brief collaboration with tenor saxophonist Joe Henderson and drummer Al Foster showcased Haden&#x27;s playing in a more hard-driving jazz context.

In 1989, Haden inaugurated the &quot;Invitation&quot; series at the Montreal Jazz Festival. With different musicians he selected, they performed in concert for eight consecutive nights of the festival. Each of these events was recorded, and most have been released in the series, &quot;The Montreal Tapes&quot;.

In 1994, Ginger Baker, drummer from the band Cream, formed another trio called The Ginger Baker Trio with Haden and guitarist Bill Frisell.

&quot;Duets&quot;: Haden performing in duets as he loved the intimacy the format provided. In 1995, Haden released &quot;Steal Away: Spirituals, Hymns and Folk Songs&quot; with pianist Hank Jones, an album based on traditional spirituals and folk songs. Haden both played on and produced the album. In late 1996, he collaborated with guitarist Pat Metheny on the album &quot;Beyond the Missouri Sky (Short Stories)&quot;, exploring the music that influenced them in their childhood experiences in, respectively southwest Iowa and northwest Missouri, with what Haden called &quot;contemporary impressionistic Americana&quot;. Haden was awarded his first Grammy award for the album, for Best Jazz Instrumental Performance.

In 1997, classical composer Gavin Bryars wrote &quot;By the Vaar&quot;, an extended adagio for Haden. Instrumentation included strings, bass clarinet and percussion. The piece was recorded with the English Chamber Orchestra, on the album &quot;Farewell to Philosophy&quot;. It is a synthesis of jazz and classical chamber music, featuring resonant pizzicato notes and gut strings in imitation of Haden&#x27;s bass sound.

===2000–2014===

In 2001, Haden won the Latin Grammy Award for Best Latin Jazz CD for his album &quot;Nocturne&quot; which contains boleros from Cuba and Mexico. In 2003, he won the Latin Grammy Award for Best Latin Jazz Performance for his album &quot;Land of the Sun&quot;. Haden reconvened the Liberation Music Orchestra in 2005, with largely new members, for the album &quot;Not In Our Name&quot;, released on Verve Records. The album dealt primarily with the contemporary political situation in the United States.

In 2008, Haden co-produced, with his wife Ruth Cameron Haden, the album &quot;Rambling Boy&quot;. It features several members of his immediate family, including Ruth Cameron, his musician triplets, son Josh, and Tanya&#x27;s husband, singer and multi-instrumentalist Jack Black. They were joined by banjoist Béla Fleck, and guitarist/singers Vince Gill, Pat Metheny, Elvis Costello, Rosanne Cash, Bruce Hornsby (piano and keyboards), among other top Nashville musicians. The album harkens back to Haden&#x27;s days of playing Americana and bluegrass music with his parents on their radio show. The idea came to Haden when his wife Ruth gathered the Haden family together for his mother&#x27;s 80th birthday and suggested they all sing &quot;You Are My Sunshine&quot; in the living room, as that was a song everyone knew. &quot;Rambling Boy&quot; was intended to connect music from his early childhood in the Haden Family band to the new generation of the Haden family as well. The album includes songs made famous by the Stanley Brothers, the Carter Family, and Hank Williams, in addition to traditional songs and original compositions.

In 2009, Swiss film director Reto Caduff released a film about Haden&#x27;s life, titled &quot;Rambling Boy.&quot; It screened at the Telluride Film Festival and at the Vancouver International Film Festival in 2009. In the summer of 2009, Haden performed again with Coleman at the Meltdown Festival in Southbank, London. He also performed and produced duet recordings with pianist Kenny Barron, with whom he recorded the album &quot;Night and the City&quot;. In February 2010, Haden and pianist Hank Jones recorded a companion to &quot;Steal Away: Spirituals, Hymns and Folk Songs&quot; called &quot;Come Sunday&quot;. Jones died three months after the recording of the album.

In September 2014, three months after his death, the newly reactivated Impulse! label released &quot;Charlie Haden-Jim Hall&quot;, a recording of a duo performance at the 1990 Montreal International Jazz Festival. &quot;This album documents a rarified journey&quot;, wrote pianist Ethan Iverson in the album&#x27;s liner notes. Although terminally ill, Haden produced and worked on the album. In June 2015, Impulse released &quot;Tokyo Adagio&quot;, a 2005 collaboration with Gonzalo Rubalcaba, similarly produced by Haden when he was near death.

== Awards ==
In 2012, Haden was a recipient of the NEA Jazz Masters Award.

In 2013, Haden received the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award.

In 2014, Haden was bestowed the Chevalier de l&#x27;Ordre des Arts et des Lettres by the French Ministry of Culture. A posthumous ceremony in his honor took place in New York City in 2015, where his widow Ruth was presented with the medal.

==Legacy==
===Spirituality and teaching method===
While he did not identify himself with a specific religious orientation, Haden was interested in spirituality, especially in association with music. He felt it was his duty, and the duty of the artist, to bring beauty to the world, to make this world a better place. He encouraged his students to find their own unique musical voice and bring it to their instrument. He also encouraged his students to be in the present moment: &quot;there&#x27;s no yesterday or tomorrow, there&#x27;s only right now&quot;, he explained. In order to find this state, and ultimately to find one&#x27;s spiritual self, Haden urged one to aspire to have humility, and respect for beauty; to be thankful for the ability to make music, and to give back to the world with the music they create. He claimed that music taught him this process of exchange, so he taught it to his students in return. Music, Haden believed, also teaches incredibly valuable lessons about life: &quot;I learned at a very young age that music teaches you about life. When you&#x27;re in the midst of improvisation, there is no yesterday and no tomorrow—there is just the moment that you are in. In that beautiful moment, you experience your true insignificance to the rest of the universe. It is then, and only then, that you can experience your true significance.&quot;

===Musical philosophy===
Haden also viewed jazz as the &quot;music of rebellion&quot; and felt it was his responsibility and mission to challenge the world through music, and through artistic risks that expressed his own individual artistic vision. He believed that all music originates from the same place, and because of this, he resisted the tendency to divide music into categories. He was democratic in his tastes and musical partners, and was interested in musical collaboration with individuals who shared his sensibilities in music and life. His music (specifically the music he created with the LMO), was based on the music of peoples struggling for freedom from oppression. Haden spoke to this in reference to his 2002 album &quot;American Dreams&quot;, stating: &quot;I always dreamed of a world without cruelty and greed, of a humanity with the same creative brilliance of our solar system, of an America worthy of the dreams of Martin Luther King, and the majesty of the Statue of Liberty...This music is dedicated to those who still dream of a society with compassion, deep creative intelligence, and a respect for the preciousness of life—for our children, and for our future.&quot;

===Musical style===
In addition to his lyrical playing, Haden was known for his warm tone and subtle vibrato on the double bass. His approach to the bass stemmed from his belief that the bassist should move from an accompanying role to a more direct role in group improvisation. This is particularly clear in his work with the Ornette Coleman Quartet where he frequently improvised melodic responses to Coleman&#x27;s free-form solos instead of playing previously written lines. He frequently closed his eyes while performing, and assumed a posture in which he bent himself around the bass until his head was almost at the bottom of the bridge of the bass.

In an interview with Haden, pianist Ethan Iverson noted that Haden&#x27;s &quot;combination of folk song, avant-garde sensibility, and Bach-like classical harmony is a stream in this music just as distinctive as Thelonious Monk or Elvin Jones.&quot;

Haden owned one three-quarters-sized bass, and one seven-eighths-sized bass. The larger bass was one of a small number of basses made by Jean-Baptiste Vuillaume in the nineteenth century. He greatly valued this bass, playing it only at recording sessions and jobs in close proximity to his home so as not to risk damaging it in transit. He attributed the bass&#x27;s special and valuable nature to the varnish used by Vuillaume.

Haden suffered from tinnitus and hyperacusis. As a result, when he played with a drummer, he had to play behind a Plexiglass divider.

Keith Jarrett said of Charlie&#x27;s way of playing: &quot;He wanted to relate to the material in a very personal style all the time. He wasn&#x27;t somebody to get into a groove and just enjoy it simply because it was a groove&quot;.

==Personal life==
Charlie&#x27;s son Josh Haden is a bass guitarist and singer in the group Spain. Charlie&#x27;s three daughters, Petra, Tanya and Rachel, who are triplets, are all singers and instrumentalists. All four children come from a previous relationship with Ellen David. Petra plays the violin, Rachel plays the piano and bass guitar, and Tanya, a visual artist, plays the cello. They have a band called The Haden Triplets and recorded their self-titled album in 2012. Comedian, actor, and musician Jack Black is Charlie&#x27;s son-in-law via Tanya.

===Death===
Haden died in Los Angeles on July 11, 2014, at the age of 76. He had been suffering from post-polio syndrome and complications from liver disease. A memorial concert was held at New York City&#x27;s Town Hall on January 13, 2015, produced and organized by his wife Ruth.

<text>The Swinging Sixties was a youth-driven cultural revolution that took place in the United Kingdom during the mid-to-late 1960s, emphasising modernity and fun-loving hedonism, with Swinging London denoted as its centre. It saw a flourishing in art, music and fashion, and was symbolised by the city&#x27;s &quot;pop and fashion exports&quot;, such as the Beatles, as the multimedia leaders of the British Invasion of musical acts; the mod and psychedelic subcultures; Mary Quant&#x27;s miniskirt designs; popular fashion models such as Twiggy and Jean Shrimpton; the iconic status of popular shopping areas such as London&#x27;s King&#x27;s Road, Kensington and Carnaby Street; the political activism of the anti-nuclear movement; and the sexual liberation movement.

Music was an essential part of the revolution, with &quot;the London sound&quot; being regarded as including the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, the Who, the Kinks and the Small Faces, bands that were additionally the mainstay of pirate radio stations like Radio Caroline, Wonderful Radio London and Swinging Radio England. Swinging London also reached British cinema, which according to the British Film Institute &quot;saw a surge in formal experimentation, freedom of expression, colour, and comedy&quot;, with films that explored countercultural and satirical themes. During this period, &quot;creative types of all kinds gravitated to the capital, from artists and writers to magazine publishers, photographers, advertisers, film-makers and product designers&quot;.

During the 1960s, London underwent a &quot;metamorphosis from a gloomy, grimy post-war capital into a bright, shining epicentre of style&quot;. The phenomenon has been agreed to have been caused by the large number of young people in the city—due to the baby boom of the 1950s—and the postwar economic boom. Following the abolition of the national service for men in 1960, these young people enjoyed greater freedom and fewer responsibilities than their parents&#x27; generation, and &quot;[fanned] changes to social and sexual politics&quot;.

Shaping the popular consciousness of aspirational Britain in the 1960s, the period was a West End–centred phenomenon regarded as happening among young, middle class people, and was often considered as &quot;simply a diversion&quot; by them. The swinging scene also served as a consumerist counterpart to the more overtly political and radical British underground of the same period. English cultural geographer Simon Rycroft wrote that &quot;whilst it is important to acknowledge the exclusivity and the dissenting voices, it does not lessen the importance of Swinging London as a powerful moment of image making with very real material effect.&quot;

== Background ==
The Swinging Sixties was a youth movement emphasising the new and modern. It was a period of optimism and hedonism, and a cultural revolution. One catalyst was the recovery of the British economy after post-Second World War austerity, which lasted through much of the 1950s.

&quot;The Swinging City&quot; was defined by &quot;Time&quot; magazine on the cover of its issue of 15 April 1966. In a Piri Halasz article &#x27;Great Britain: You Can Walk Across It on the Grass&#x27;, the magazine pronounced London the global hub of youthful creativity, hedonism and excitement: &quot;In a decade dominated by youth, London has burst into bloom. It swings; it is the scene&quot;, and celebrated in the name of the pirate radio station, Swinging Radio England, that began shortly afterwards.

The term &quot;swinging&quot; in the sense of hip or fashionable had been used since the early 1960s, including by Norman Vaughan in his &quot;swinging/dodgy&quot; patter on &quot;Sunday Night at the London Palladium&quot;. In 1965, Diana Vreeland, editor of &quot;Vogue&quot; magazine, said that &quot;London is the most swinging city in the world at the moment.&quot; Later that year, the American singer Roger Miller had a hit record with &quot;England Swings&quot;, although the lyrics mostly relate to traditional notions of Britain.

== Music ==

Already heralded by Colin MacInnes&#x27; 1959 novel &quot;Absolute Beginners&quot; which captured London&#x27;s emerging youth culture, Swinging London was underway by the mid-1960s and included music by the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, the Kinks, the Who, Small Faces, the Animals, Dusty Springfield, Lulu, Cilla Black, Sandie Shaw and other artists from what was known in the US as the &quot;British Invasion&quot;. Psychedelic rock from artists such as Pink Floyd, Cream, Procol Harum, the Jimi Hendrix Experience and Traffic grew significantly in popularity.

Large venues, besides former music halls, included Hyde, Alexandra and Finsbury Parks, Clapham Common and the Empire Pool (which became Wembley Arena). This sort of music was heard in the United Kingdom on TV shows such as the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; (where the Rolling Stones were the first band to perform with &quot;I Wanna Be Your Man&quot;), and ITV&#x27;s &quot;Ready Steady Go!&quot; (which would feature Manfred Mann&#x27;s &quot;5-4-3-2-1&quot; as its theme tune), on commercial radio stations such as Radio Luxembourg, Radio Caroline and Radio London, and from 1967 on BBC Radio One.

The Rolling Stones&#x27; 1966 album &quot;Aftermath&quot; has been cited by music scholars as a reflection of Swinging London. Ian MacDonald said, with the album the Stones were chronicling the phenomenon, while Philippe Margotin and Jean-Michel Guesdon called it &quot;the soundtrack of Swinging London, a gift to hip young people&quot;.

== Fashion and symbols ==

During the Swinging Sixties, fashion and photography were featured in &quot;Queen&quot; magazine, which drew attention to fashion designer Mary Quant. Mod-related fashions such as the miniskirt stimulated fashionable London shopping areas such as Carnaby Street and King&#x27;s Road, Chelsea. Vidal Sassoon created the bob cut hairstyle.

The model Jean Shrimpton was another icon and one of the world&#x27;s first supermodels. She was the world&#x27;s highest paid and most photographed model during this time. Shrimpton was called &quot;The Face of the &#x27;60s&quot;, in which she has been considered by many as &quot;the symbol of Swinging London&quot; and the &quot;embodiment of the 1960s&quot;.

Like Pattie Boyd, the wife of Beatles guitarist George Harrison, Shrimpton gained international fame for her embodiment of the &quot;British female &#x27;look&#x27; – mini-skirt, long, straight hair and wide-eyed loveliness&quot;, characteristics that defined Western fashion following the arrival of the Beatles and other British Invasion acts in 1964.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hibbert/HistoryOfRock&quot;&gt; Available at Rock&#x27;s Backpages (subscription required).&lt;/ref&gt; Other popular models of the era included Veruschka, Peggy Moffitt and Penelope Tree. The model Twiggy has been called &quot;the face of 1966&quot; and &quot;the Queen of Mod&quot;, a label she shared with, among others, Cathy McGowan, the host of the television rock show &quot;Ready Steady Go!&quot; from 1964 to 1966.

The British flag, the Union Jack, became a symbol, assisted by events such as England&#x27;s home victory in the 1966 World Cup. The Jaguar E-Type sports car was a British icon of the 1960s.

In late 1965, photographer David Bailey sought to define Swinging London in a series of large photographic prints. Compiled into a set titled &quot;Box of Pin-Ups&quot;, they were published on 21 November that year. His subjects included actors Michael Caine and Terence Stamp; musicians John Lennon, Paul McCartney, Mick Jagger and five other pop stars; Brian Epstein, as one of four individuals representing music management; hairdresser Vidal Sassoon, ballet dancer Rudolf Nureyev, Ad Lib club manager Brian Morris, and the Kray twins; as well as leading figures in interior decoration, pop art, photography, fashion modelling, photographic design and creative advertising.

Bailey&#x27;s photographs reflected the rise of working-class artists, entertainers and entrepreneurs that characterised London during this period. Writing in his 1967 book &quot;The Young Meteors&quot;, journalist Jonathan Aitken described &quot;Box of Pin-Ups&quot; as &quot;a Debrett of the new aristocracy&quot;.

== Film ==
The phenomenon was featured in many films of the time, including &quot;Darling&quot; (1965) starring Julie Christie, &quot;The Pleasure Girls&quot; (1965), &quot;The Knack ...and How to Get It&quot; (1965), Michelangelo Antonioni&#x27;s &quot;Blowup&quot; (1966), &quot;Alfie&quot; (1966) starring Michael Caine, &quot;&quot; (1966), &quot;Georgy Girl&quot; (1966), &quot;Kaleidoscope&quot; (1966), &quot;The Sandwich Man&quot; (1966), &quot;The Jokers&quot; (1967), &quot;Casino Royale&quot; (1967) starring Peter Sellers, &quot;Smashing Time&quot; (1967), &quot;To Sir, with Love&quot; (1967), &quot;Bedazzled&quot; (1967) starring Dudley Moore and Peter Cook, &quot;Poor Cow&quot; (1967), &quot;I&#x27;ll Never Forget What&#x27;s&#x27;isname&quot; (1967), &quot;Up the Junction&quot; (1968), &quot;Joanna&quot; (1968), &quot;Otley&quot; (1968), &quot;The Strange Affair&quot; (1968), &quot;Baby Love&quot; (1968), &quot;The Magic Christian&quot; (1969), &quot;The Touchables&quot; (1968), &quot;Les Bicyclettes de Belsize&quot; (1969), &quot;Two Gentlemen Sharing&quot; (1969), &quot;Performance&quot; (1970), and &quot;Deep End&quot; (1970).

The comedy films &quot;Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery&quot; (1997) and &quot;Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me&quot; (1999), written by and starring Mike Myers, resurrected the imagery of the Swinging London scene (but were filmed in Hollywood), as did the 2009 film &quot;The Boat That Rocked&quot;.

== Television ==
* The ITV spy-fi series &quot;The Avengers&quot; (1961–1969), particularly after it began broadcasting in colour, revelled in its Swinging Sixties setting. In the 1967 episode &quot;Dead Man&#x27;s Treasure&quot;, Emma Peel (played by Diana Rigg) arrives in the archetypal English village of Swingingdale, dubbing it &quot;&quot;not&quot; very swinging&quot;.
* In the episode &quot;Beauty Is an Ugly Word&quot; (1966) of BBC&#x27;s &quot;Adam Adamant Lives!&quot;, Adamant (Gerald Harper), an Edwardian adventurer suspended in time since 1902, was told, &quot;This is London, 1966 – the swinging city.&quot;
* The BBC show &quot;Take Three Girls&quot; (1969) is noted for Liza Goddard&#x27;s first starring role, an evocative folk-rock theme song (&quot;Light Flight&quot; by Pentangle), a West Kensington location, and scenes in which the heroines were shown dressing or undressing.
* &quot;Jigsaw Man&quot;, a 1968 episode of the detective series &quot;Man in a Suitcase&quot;, opened with the announcement: &quot;This is London … Swinging London.&quot;

<doc id="463285" wikidata="Q142148" url="?curid=463285" title="São Francisco River">
<text>The São Francisco River (, ) is a large river in Brazil. With a length of , it is the longest river that runs entirely in Brazilian territory, and the fourth longest in South America and overall in Brazil (after the Amazon, the Paraná and the Madeira). It used to be known as the by the indigenous people before colonisation, and is today also known as .

The São Francisco originates in the Canastra mountain range in the central-western part of the state of Minas Gerais. It runs generally north in the states of Minas Gerais and Bahia, behind the coastal range, draining an area of over , before turning east to form the border between Bahia on the right bank and the states of Pernambuco and Alagoas on the left one. After that, it ends on the boundaries between the states of Alagoas and Sergipe and washes into the Atlantic Ocean. In addition to the five states which the São Francisco directly traverses or borders, its drainage basin also includes tributaries from the state of Goiás and the Federal District.

It is an important river for Brazil, called &quot;the river of national integration&quot; because it unites diverse climates and regions of the country, in particular the Southeast with the Northeast. It is also significant because it passes through the semi-arid region of the country, a region historically characterized by droughts and low access to water. It is navigable between the cities of Pirapora (Minas Gerais) and Juazeiro (Bahia), as well as between Piranhas (Alagoas) and the mouth on the ocean, but traditional passenger navigation has almost disappeared in recent years due to changes in the river flow (see below).

==Names==
The river is named for Saint Francis of Assisi, from its first discovery by Europeans on his feast day (4 October) in 1501. The nickname &quot;Velho Chico&quot; may be translated as &quot;Old Frank&quot;: &quot;velho&quot; means old, and &quot;chico&quot; is a diminutive of Francisco, itself the Portuguese form of the name Francis.

Indigenous peoples called it Kaleshí in the now extinct Tuxá language, and Opára in the extinct Natú language.

==History==

Tuxá, Truká, Natú, Kariri languages, eastern Maxakalían languages, Jê languages, and various unclassified extinct languages were spoken in the São Francisco River basin.

The Italian explorer Amerigo Vespucci first saw the river on 4 October 1501. In 1865 the British explorer and diplomat Richard Francis Burton was transferred to Santos in Brazil. He explored the central highlands, canoeing down the São Francisco river from its source to the falls of Paulo Afonso.

== Sections ==


The course of the river, running through five states, may be divided into four sections, as follows:
#The high part, from its source to Pirapora in Minas Gerais
#The upper middle part, from Pirapora, where the navigable part begins, up to Remanso (Bahia) and the Sobradinho Dam
#The lower middle part, from the Sobradinho dam to Paulo Afonso, also in Bahia (bordering on Alagoas), and ending at the Itaparica Dam
#The low part, from Paulo Afonso to the river&#x27;s mouth on the Atlantic Ocean

== Tributaries ==
The river obtains water from 168 rivers and streams, of which 90 are on the right bank and 78 on the left bank.
The main tributaries are:
*Paraopeba River
*Abaeté River
*Das Velhas River
*Jequitaí River
*Paracatu River
*Urucuia River
*Verde Grande River
*Carinhanha River
*Corrente River
*Grande River

==Navigability==
The São Francisco is naturally navigable all through the year between Pirapora (Minas Gerais) and the twin cities of Petrolina (Pernambuco) and Juazeiro (Bahia), a length of . However, there are large variations in depth depending on the rainfall. Because of the diversity of physical characteristics over the course of the navigable stretch, it may be divided into three substretches, as follows:

*From Pirapora to Pilão Arcado (Bahia), a length of ; differences in height up to may occur due to rains and drought.
*From Pilão Arcado to the Sobradinho Dam; the latter&#x27;s reservoir is long, with a surface area of and a comfortable depth.
*From the Sobradinho dam to Petrolina/Juazeiro, with a length of and an average depth of , sustained by a flow of .

Until recent years, the São Francisco was regularly navigated by a type of passenger boat called &quot;gaiola&quot; (Portuguese for &quot;cage&quot;). These were paddle-wheel steamboats, some of them having been Mississippi riverboats and dating from the time of the American Civil War. After the Sobradinho dam was built in Bahia, the conditions of navigability were altered considerably, since the reservoir&#x27;s large size allowed for the formation of short waves of considerable height. Although the dam has a navigation lock, the waves and currents made traversing the lake difficult for the &quot;gaiolas&quot;. At the same time, deforestation and excessive agricultural use of the upper-course waters of the São Francisco and its tributaries greatly reduced the water flow in the middle course, creating sand banks and islands that hindered navigation.

In a short time, conditions were such that navigation became impossible for the large &quot;gaiolas&quot;, although still possible for smaller boats. The shells of those old riverboats can still be seen on the river at Pirapora. As of 2009, a single boat, the &quot;Benjamim Guimarães&quot;, remains in activity, making short-distance tourist cruises from Pirapora to São Romão and back.

==Fish==
More than 200 fish species are known from the São Francisco River basin and it is expected that several additional species will be discovered in the future, especially from the relatively poorly known upper parts of the river. About 10% of the fish species known from the river basin are threatened and about 13% are important in fisheries. About 64% of the fish species known from the basin are endemic, including &quot;Conorhynchos conirostris&quot; (a catfish of uncertain taxonomic affinities), &quot;Lophiosilurus alexandri&quot; (a flattened catfish), &quot;Franciscodoras marmoratus&quot; (an armoured catfish), &quot;Pygocentrus piraya&quot; (the largest species of piranha), &quot;Orthospinus franciscensis&quot; (a characin and the only member of its genus), &quot;Hasemania nana&quot; (a small tetra that often is kept in aquariums), and &quot;Salminus franciscanus&quot; (a relative of the golden dorado). More than 40 annual killifish species are found in the São Francisco River basin, especially from the genera &quot;Cynolebias&quot; and &quot;Hypsolebias&quot;. Dams (preventing fish migrations on the river) and pollution do present a problem to the species in the river, and fish mass deaths have been recorded.

==Towns and population==
The area crossed by the river is vast and sparsely populated, but several towns lie on the river. Beginning in Minas Gerais, the river passes by Pirapora, São Francisco, Januária, Bom Jesus da Lapa, the twin cities of Petrolina and Juazeiro, and Paulo Afonso. The hinterland is arid and underpopulated, so most of the towns are small and isolated. Only Petrolina and Juazeiro have grown into medium-sized cities and have become prosperous because of fruit production based on irrigation.

== Hydroelectric dams ==
The river&#x27;s hydroelectric potential started being harnessed in 1955, when the Paulo Afonso dam was built between Bahia and Alagoas. The Paulo Afonso plant now provides electric power for the whole of Northeastern Brazil. Four other large hydroelectric plants were later built: Três Marias in Minas Gerais, built in 1961, Sobradinho in Bahia, built in 1977, Luiz Gonzaga (Itaparica), between Bahia and Pernambuco, in 1988 and the Xingó near Piranhas in 1994. The Sobradinho reservoir is one of the largest artificial lakes in the world, with an area of .

The section of dramatic canyons between the Paulo Afonso and Xingó dams, including part of the Xingó reservoir, is protected by the Rio São Francisco Natural Monument.

==Cultural significance==

The São Francisco has great importance in history and particularly in folklore. That history is celebrated in song, legend and souvenirs based on the carrancas, a kind of gargoyle placed on the prow of the &quot;gaiola&quot; boats and intended to scare away river demons from the boat. Tourist shops far from the river have modernized replicas and miniatures of the vanishing originals. The stories of river demons and monsters persist today.

From Paulo Afonso to the historic town of Penedo (Alagoas), the river lies at the bottom of a gorge or steep sided valley. Piranhas, a nearby town, was once the terminus of a railroad. The town has a number of abandoned historical buildings from that period. They have been restored and are emerging as a tourist attraction.

==Controversial diversion project (under construction)==
In 2005, the Brazilian government proposed a controversial water diversion project that will bring water from the river to semiarid areas of four Brazilian states (Ceará, Pernambuco, Paraíba and Rio Grande do Norte). Environmentalists argue that the project will do more harm than good, benefitting only large landowners and a very small population, while bringing considerable ecological impact. The government insists that the project will give the people in the four states a much-needed water supply.

The diversion project intake point is located at Cabrobó.
