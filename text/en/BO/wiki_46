<text>Manaus () is the capital and largest city of the Brazilian state of Amazonas. It is the seventh-largest city in Brazil, with an estimated 2022 population of 2,063,689 distributed over a land area of about . Located at the east centre of the state, the city is the centre of the Manaus metropolitan area and the largest metropolitan area in the North Region of Brazil by urban landmass. It is situated near the confluence of the Negro and Amazon rivers. It is one of the two cities in the Amazon Rainforest with a population of over 1 million people, alongside Belém.

The city was founded in 1669 as the Fort of São José do Rio Negro. It was elevated to a town in 1832 with the name of &quot;Manaus&quot;, an altered spelling of the indigenous Manaós peoples, and legally transformed into a city on October 24, 1848, with the name of &quot;Cidade da Barra do Rio Negro&quot;, Portuguese for &quot;The City of the Margins of the Black River&quot;. On September 4, 1856, it returned to its original name.

Manaus is located in the center of the Amazon rainforest, and home to the National Institute of Amazonian Research, being the most important center for scientific studies in the Amazon region and for international sustainability issues. It was known at the beginning of the century as &quot;Heart of the Amazon&quot; and &quot;City of the Forest.&quot; Currently, its main economic engine is the Industrial Park of Manaus, a Free Economic Zone. The city has a free port and an international airport. Its manufactures include electronics, chemical products, and soap; there are distilling and ship construction industries. Manaus also exports Brazil nuts, rubber, jute, and rosewood oil. It has a cathedral, opera house, zoological and botanical gardens, an eco-park, and regional and native peoples museums.

The Solimões and Negro rivers meet just east of Manaus and join to form the Amazon River (using the Brazilian definition of the river; elsewhere, Solimões is considered the upper part of the Amazon). Rubber made it the richest city in South America during the late 1800s. Rubber also helped Manaus earn its nickname, &quot;the Paris of the Tropics&quot;. Many wealthy European families settled in Manaus and brought their love for sophisticated European art, architecture, and culture with them. Manaus was one of the twelve Brazilian host cities of the 2014 World Cup, as well as one of the six hosts of football matches at the 2016 Summer Olympics.

== Etymology ==
The name Manaus comes from the native people called &quot;Manaós&quot;, which means &quot;Mother of the Gods&quot;.

== History ==

=== Early settlement of Manaus ===
The history of the European colonization of Manaus began in 1499 with the Spanish arrival at the mouth of the Amazon River. The Spanish then continued to colonize the region north of Brazil. Development continued in 1668–1669 with the building of the Fort of São José da Barra do Rio Negro by the Portuguese in order to ensure its predominance in the region, especially against the Dutch, at that time headquartered in what is today Suriname. The fort was constructed in rock and clay, with four cannons guarding the curtains. It continued to function for more than 100 years. Next to the fort there were many indigenous mestizos, who helped in its construction and began to live in the vicinity.

The population grew so much that, in 1695, the missionaries (Carmelite, Jesuit, Franciscan) built a nearby chapel dedicated to &quot;Nossa Senhora da Conceição &quot;(Our Lady of the Conception), who, in time, became the patron saint of the city. A Royal Charter of March 3, 1755 created the captaincy of São José do Rio Negro, with capital in Mariuá (now Barcelos), but with the governor, Lobo D&#x27;Almada, fearing a Spanish invasion, the seat went back to Lugar de Barra in 1791. Being located at the confluence of the Rio Negro and Amazon Rivers, it was a strategic point. On November 13, 1832, Lugar da Barra was elevated to town status and named Manaus. On October 24, 1848, under Law 145 of the Provincial Assembly of Para, it was renamed the City of Barra do Rio Negro. On September 4, 1856, the governor, Herculano Ferreira Pena, finally gave it the name &quot;Manaus&quot;.

=== Cabanagem ===
The Cabanagem was the revolt in which blacks, Native Americans, and mestizos fought against the white political elite and took power in 1835. The Cabanagem reduced the population of the then state of Grão-Pará from about 100,000 to 60,000. The involvement of rebels from the Upper Amazon (Manaus today) in what was originally a movement based in Belém was crucial for the birth of the current state of the Amazon. During the brief period of revolution, the Cabanos of the Upper Amazon, bands of rebels, roamed throughout the region, occupying Manaus twice, and, in most settlements, their arrival was greeted by the non-white population spontaneously joining their ranks, leading to a greater number of adherents to the movement. With that there was an integration of people in the region thus forming the state.

=== Rubber boom ===
Manaus was at the center of the Amazon region&#x27;s rubber boom during the late 19th century. For a time, it was &quot;one of the gaudiest cities of the world&quot;. Historian Robin Furneaux wrote of this period, &quot;No extravagance, however absurd, deterred&quot; the rubber barons. &quot;If one rubber baron bought a vast yacht, another would install a tame lion in his villa, and a third would water his horse on champagne.&quot; The city built a grand opera house, with vast domes and gilded balconies, and using marble, glass, and crystal, from around Europe. The opera house cost ten million (public-funded) dollars. In one season, half the members of one visiting opera troupe died of yellow fever. The opera house, called the Teatro Amazonas, was effectively closed for most of the 20th Century. However it was used in scenes of the Werner Herzog film &quot;Fitzcarraldo&quot; (1982). After a gap of almost 90 years, it reopened to produce live opera in 1997 and is now attracting performers from all over the world.

When the seeds of the rubber tree were smuggled out of the Amazon region to be cultivated on plantations in Southeast Asia, Brazil and Peru lost their monopoly on the product. The rubber boom ended abruptly, many people left its major cities, and Manaus fell into poverty. The rubber boom had made possible electrification of the city before it was installed in many European cities, but the end of the rubber boom made the generators too expensive to run. The city was not able to generate electricity again for years.

===Free zone===
In the 1960s during the establishment of the military dictatorship in Brazil, the newly installed government concerned about the &quot;demographic gap in Brazil&quot;, began to introduce numerous projects in the interior of the country, especially in the Amazon region, with the introduction of the Manaus free trade zone in 1967, and with the opening of new roads within the region, the city had a wide period of investments in financial and economic capital, both national and international, attracted by the tax incentives granted by the free zone, in this period, Manaus had enormous demographic growth becoming one of the most populous cities in Brazil.

===Recent events===
Manaus was one of the host cities of the 2014 FIFA World Cup and one of the seats of some Olympic football games. It was the only host city in the Amazon rainforest and the most geographically isolated, being further north and west than any of the other host cities. A massive prison riot occurred in January 2017, having begun in Manaus and later spreading to two additional cities in Brazil, thus unleashing security problems within the country.

During the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil, an estimated 76% of the population of Manaus was infected with coronavirus, and the possibility of herd immunity was discussed. However, a second outbreak infected people in Manaus, this time with the Lineage B.1.1.248 variant starting in early January 2021.

== Geography ==

The largest city in northern Brazil, Manaus occupies an area of , with a density of . It is the neighboring city of Presidente Figueiredo, Careiro, Iranduba, Rio Preto da Eva, Itacoatiara, and Novo Airão.

=== Vegetation ===
Manaus is located in the middle of the Amazon Rainforest. The Amazon represents over half of the planet&#x27;s remaining rainforests and comprises the largest and most species-rich tract of tropical rainforest in the world. Wet tropical forests are the most species-rich biome, and tropical forests in the Americas are consistently more species-rich than the wet forests in Africa and Asia. As the largest tract of tropical rainforest in the Americas, the Amazonian rainforests have unparalleled biodiversity. More than one-third of all species in the world live in the Amazon rainforest.

=== Green areas ===
Despite being located in the Amazon, Manaus is densely developed and has few green areas in the city. The largest green areas are:
* Mindu Park, located in the center-south of the city, the district Park 10. The Park of Mindú, established in 1989, is one of the largest and most visited parks in the city.
* Bilhares Park, established in 2005, located in the south-central region of Manaus, in the neighborhood of (&quot;plateau&quot;).
* Area of the green hill of Aleixo, created in the 1980s, located in the east of the city and is one of the largest urban green areas.
* Sumaúma State Park, a state park located in the north of Manaus, in the New Town district. It is the smallest state park of the Brazilian Amazon Basin.
* Castanheiras Pied Tamarin Wildlife Refuge, a refuge created in 1982 to protect a population of endangered pied tamarins. 
* Adolfo Ducke Forest Reserve, a biological reserve established in 1963, and covers an area of 100 square kilometres (10,000 hectares, 39 square miles). The Reserve is managed by INPA (Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas da Amazonia—National Institute for Amazon Research).
* Part of the Anavilhanas National Park, a conservation unit that was originally an ecological station created in 1981.
* About 75% of the Rio Negro Left Bank Environmental Protection Area, a sustainable use conservation area created in 1995.
* The Tupé Sustainable Development Reserve, created in 2005, about west of the city.
* The Rio Negro State Park South Section, created in 1995, about by boat to the northwest of the city.

=== Climate ===
Manaus has a tropical monsoon climate (&quot;Am&quot;) according to the Köppen climate classification system, just dry enough in its driest month to not be a tropical rainforest climate, with the average annual compensated temperature of and high air humidity, with a rainfall index around annually. The seasons are relatively well-defined concerning rain: July to September is relatively dry, and December to May (summer and autumn) is very rainy. Summer and autumn are colder than winter and spring (June to November). Thunderstorms are frequent every day in the summer (December to February), but they can occur at any time of the year. There have been occasional occurrences of hail in the city.

Due to the city&#x27;s proximity to the equator, the heat is constant in the local climate. There are no cold days in winter (June to August), instead winter is hotter than summer. There is rarely very intense polar air masses in the South-Central part of Brazil and in the southwest of the Amazon have some effect on the city, as occurred in August 1955. But although they are rare, they influence the climate, causing the temperature to drop to or below. The proximity to the forest usually avoids extremes of heat and makes the city wet.

According to the National Institute of Meteorology (INMET), the highest temperature registered in the city was , in 2015 and the lowest was in 1989.

On November 26, 2009, a case of acid rain was recorded in Manaus. Air pollution, caused in large part by the accumulation of smoke from burning, associated with the sulfur dioxide emitted by cars, was the cause of this phenomenon. Although the incidence of acid rain is common in some Brazilian capitals where there is a great concentration of cars, in Manaus and other cities of the Amazonas the situation is aggravated by the prolonged period of drought with the smoke from forest fires.

==Hydrology==
The urban area covers all or part of four river basins, all tributaries of the Rio Negro. The São Raimundo and Educandos streams are completely contained in the city. The Tarumã Açu forms the western boundary of the city in its lower reaches, and is fed by several tributaries that originate in the Ducke Reserve and run through the north and west of the city. The Puraquequara forms the east boundary of the urban area in its lower section.

== Demographics ==

According to the IBGE in 2019, there were 2,182,763 people residing in the city, and 2,676,936 people in the Metropolitan Region of Manaus. The population density was .

* Total population: 2,145,444 inhabitants (87% urban, 13% rural, 52.07% women and 47.93% men)
* Population density: 

Manaus is the seventh largest city in Brazil, after São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Salvador, Brasília, Fortaleza and Belo Horizonte.

The city&#x27;s population growth is above the national average, and 10% above the average for the capital (Brasilia). Most of the population is located in the North and East regions of the city, and the New Town (northern area) the neighborhood is the most populous, with more than 260,000 residents.

According to the results of the last census, the city&#x27;s population increased from 343,038 inhabitants in 1960 to 622,733 in 1970. By 1990, the population grew to 1,025,979 inhabitants, increasing its density to .

According to a 2013 genetic study, the ancestry of the inhabitants of Manaus is 45.9% European, 37.8% Native American, and 16.3% African.

=== Religion ===
The city has been influenced by Catholicism since the time of European colonialism, and the majority of Manauenses are Catholic—there are nevertheless dozens of different Protestant denominations in the city. Judaism, Candomblé, Islam, and spiritualism, among others, are also practised. There is a community of Amazonian Jews in Manaus. The city&#x27;s Catedral Metropolitana Nossa Senhora da Conceição is the seat of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Manaus.

The city has a very diverse presence of Protestant or Reformed faiths, such as the Presbyterian Church, Calvary Chapel, For Christ International Church of Grace of God, Pentecostal Church of God in Brazil, Methodist Church, the Anglican Episcopal Church, the Baptist Church, an Assembly of God Church, the Seventh-day Adventist Church, the Universal Church of the Kingdom of God, and the Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses among others. These churches are experiencing considerable growth, mainly in the outskirts of the city. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints also has a large presence, with a LDS temple having been built in the city, the sixth in Brazil.

== Districts and regions ==
=== Metropolitan region ===
The Metropolitan Region of Manaus (RMM) is a metropolitan area that comprises eight cities of the Amazonas state, but without conurbation.

=== Regions ===
Manaus is divided into seven regions: North, Southern, Central-South, East, West, Mid-West, and Rural area. The eastern region of the city is the most populated, with approximately 600,000 inhabitants (2007). The northern region of the city has had the highest rate of population growth in recent years, and has the largest neighborhood of the city, the Nova Cidade neighborhood. The Center-South region has the highest per capita income. The Eastern Zone is known for having a large number of hills.

=== Neighborhoods ===

The first neighborhood (bairro) established in Manaus was Educandos. From there, other areas of the city began to be occupied since the arrival of migrants from other regions of Brazil.

Manaus has the largest neighborhood in Latin America, the neighborhood of Cidade Nova, which has 264,449 inhabitants, but it is estimated that the population exceeds 300,000 inhabitants. Cidade Nova is larger than all the cities inside the rest of Amazonas state. With the permanence and the strengthening of Free Economic Zone of Manaus, the city began to receive investments and constant migration of people from many parts of the state and northern Brazil.

The wealthiest neighborhood in Manaus is Adrianópolis, located in the Central-South Area of the city. Downtown Manaus is located in the Southern area of the city, next to Rio Negro River. After years of development, the historical center has been neglected by the authorities and it has become an area mostly for commerce and poor housing. There is a plan to restore the city centre to its former glory by removing beggars and irregular sellers from sidewalks and by doing that provide more safety for tourists and locals who are trying to walk in the historical areas of the city. All these plans were prompted by the 2014 World Cup.

== Economy ==
Manaus is the sixth-largest economy in Brazil. According to IBGE in 2014, its GDP was R$67,5 billion. The per capita income for the city was R$33,446. Although the main industry of Manaus through much of the 20th century was rubber, its importance has declined. Given its location, fish, wild fruits like Açaí and Cupuaçu, and Brazil nuts initiate important trades, as do petroleum refining, soap manufacturing, and chemical industries. Over the last decades, a system of federal investments and tax incentives has turned the surrounding region into a major industrial center (the Free Economic Zone of Manaus).

The mobile phone companies LG, Nokia, Samsung, Siemens, Sagem, Gradiente, and BenQ-Siemens operate mobile phone manufacturing plants in Manaus. Plastic lens manufacturer Essilor also has a plant here. The Brazilian sport utility vehicle manufacturer Amazon Veiculos is headquartered in Manaus. Two airlines, MAP Linhas Aéreas and Manaus Aerotáxi, have headquarters on the grounds of Eduardo Gomes International Airport in Manaus.

=== Free Trade Zone ===

The initial idea of a Free Trade Port in Manaus came from Deputy Francisco Pereira da Silva and was subsequently formalized by Law No. 3.173 on June 6, 1957. The project was approved by the National Congress on October 23, 1951, under No. 1.310 and regulated by Decree No. 47.757 on February 2, 1960. It was then amended by rapporteur Maurício Jopper, an engineer, who by agreement with the original author, justified the creation of a Free Trade Zone instead of a Free Trade Port.

For the first ten years, the ZFM (Manaus Free Trade Zone) was located in a warehouse rented from Manaus Harbour, in the Port of Manaus, and relied on federal funds. It was perhaps due to this lack of its own resources that there was little credibility in the project. On February 28, 1967, President Castelo Branco signed Decree-Law No. 288, which redefined the Manaus Free Trade Zone in more concrete terms. The new Decree-Law stipulated that the Manaus Free Trade Zone would have a radius of with an industrial center as well as an agricultural center and that these would be given the economic means to allow for regional development in order to lift the Amazon out of the economic isolation that it had fallen into at that time.

On August 28, 1967, the Manaus Free Trade Zone Authority, SUBFRAME, was created. SUBFRAME is an independent body with its own legal status and assets and has financial and administrative autonomy. Tax incentives and the subsequent complementary legislation created comparative advantages in the region with respect to other parts of the country and as a result the Manaus Free Trade Zone attracted new investment to the area. These incentives constituted tax exemptions administered federally by SUBFRAME and SUDAM.

==Government and politics==

There is a prison, Anisio Jobim Penitentiary Complex.

== Education, science and technology ==
Manaus has research centers, technology and public and private universities.

* Federal University of Amazonas—&quot;Universidade Federal do Amazonas&quot;;
* University of the State of Amazonas—&quot;Universidade do Estado do Amazonas&quot;;
* National Institute of Amazonian Research—&quot;Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas da Amazônia&quot;;

== Transportation ==

=== Airports ===

Eduardo Gomes International Airport is the airport serving Manaus. The airport has two passenger terminals, one for scheduled flights and the other for regional aviation. It also has three cargo terminals.

Eduardo Gomes International Airport is Brazil&#x27;s third largest in freight movement, handling the import and export demand from the Manaus Industrial Complex. For this reason, Infraero invested in the construction of the third cargo terminal, opened on December 14, 2004. TAM Airlines also inaugurated its own cargo terminal near the airport in 2008, which claims to be the largest cargo terminal in Brazil. The country&#x27;s major dedicated freight route is between Manaus and Viracopos International Airport, which is operated by wide-body jets. Other freight routes include North America and Europe.

The passenger terminal had been fully refurbished and expanded in time for the 2014 FIFA Football World Cup, which held 4 games in Manaus. The airport currently operates daily international flights to Miami and Orlando, United States, by American Airlines and LATAM Airlines Brasil; to the city of Panama, by Copa Airlines; and to Barcelona, Venezuela, by Avior Airlines. The airport has direct flights to all major airports in Brazil, operated by the three major carriers: Gol Transportes Aéreos, TAM Airlines, and Azul Brazilian Airlines. The airport&#x27;s IATA code is MAO.

Manaus Air Force Base - ALA8, one of the most important bases of the Brazilian Air Force, is located in Manaus at the former Ponta Pelada Airport.

Apart from the Eduardo Gomes International Airport and Ponta Pelada Airport, Manaus is also served by Flores Airport, used by small propeller aircraft and helicopters about north of the city centre, simply known as the &quot;Aeroclube&quot; (). On Sundays, it is used for parachuting and where flying classes can be hired. Due to the fact that it is surrounded by residential areas, and has a recent history of crashes, it is under constant pressure to be moved.

=== Highways ===
There are two federal highways that intersect Manaus. There is a paved road heading North (BR-174) connecting Manaus to Boa Vista, the capital of the State of Roraima and to Venezuela. Strictly speaking, Manaus is connected by road to the rest of Brazil, as it is possible to drive continuously from Manaus into Venezuela, and then reenter Brazil through the BR-364 in Acre and its capital, Rio Branco, therefore passing through the countries of Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru. As such a route is impractical for most motorists, the vast majority of transportation to and from Manaus is by boat or plane, except for journeys to Roraima. &quot;The Independent&quot; noted that &quot;there are still no roads to Manaus&quot; from the rest of the country.

The BR-319 heads South connecting Manaus to Porto Velho, the state capital of Rondônia. However, access to this highway requires a ferry crossing to Careiro, across the Rio Negro and Amazon River, which takes about 40 minutes, and then is only paved for about another to Castanho. After that, the highway is not paved, and cannot be used. Various governments have promised to recover this land-link with the rest of the country, but environmental issues, high costs and complicated logistics have impeded any progress so far.

The two major state highways are the AM-010 and the AM-070. The AM-010 heads east, to Itacoatiara, Amazonas at the banks of the Amazon River, which is the third largest city of the state. The AM-070 heads south, starting on the other side of the new Rio Negro Bridge at Manaus, and reaching Manacapuru, which lies at the banks of the Solimoes River, also known as the upper River Amazon, and which is the fourth largest city of the state. Both roads are paved and operate all year round.

=== Port ===
Ships dock at the main port in Manaus directly downtown on the banks of the Negro River. The terraced city is home to a network of bridged channels that divide it into several compartments. Several mobile phone companies have manufacturing plants in the port area, and other major electronics manufacturers also have plants there. Major exports going through the port include Brazil nuts, chemicals, petroleum, electrical equipment, and forest products. 

=== Taxis ===
Regular Manaus taxis are white and can be stopped anywhere. They are organized into separate cooperatives, each with their own contact phone numbers. All taxis are metered, which does not necessarily mean the meter will be used.

The &#x27;special&#x27; taxi cars are typically black and of a higher quality than the white taxis, and will charge a fixed rate for all journeys or daily hire. Most can only be booked locally; however, the reputable Brazil Airport Transfers has recently started providing airport transfer and general transportation services in Manaus.

=== Bus ===
The bus system in Manaus is quite extensive and there are buses and vans that go to most destinations, including the popular tourist destinations. There is a very simple bus website that permits the planning of routes.
== Events and holidays ==

The annual calendar of festivals in Manaus starts in late February / early March. The Manaus carnival (carnaval) celebrations are a good start to upcoming events and include traditional processions and samba dancing at the Sambódromo in the Centro de Convenções (Convention Centre). May is a popular time to pay a visit to Manaus, since the city hosts both the Ponta Negra Music and the Amazonas de Opera festivals during this month. Staged at the Teatro Amazonas, the Opera Festival lasts around three weeks and usually runs into early June. The Floclorico do Amazonas (Amazonas Folklore Festival) is in June, and this has grown to become a major event, involving a huge array of folk dancing and music, culminating in the Procissao Fluvial de São Pedro (St. Peter River Procession), when hundreds of riverboats sail along the Rio Negro, honouring the patron saint of fishermen.

October 24 was the day in 1848 that Manaus legally became a city. This anniversary is always cause for a party, culminating in fireworks at the end of the day. In November is the week-long Amazonas Film Festival, with films and documentaries often emphasising ecology, ethnology and human relationships.

* February—Amazonas Carnival—samba schools parade at the &quot;sambódromo&quot; in the Convention Center
* May—Ponta Negra&#x27;s Music Festival
* May—Amazonas Opera Festival
* June—Amazonas Folklore Festival
* June 29—São Pedro Fluvial Procession
* July—Amazonas Jazz Festival
* September 5—Elevation of Amazonas to the category of Brazilian Province
* October 24—Anniversary of Manaus
* December 31—Ponta Negra&#x27;s New Year&#x27;s Eve Party

== Sights and attractions ==
Because of Manaus&#x27; location within the Amazon rainforest, it attracts a substantial number of Brazilian and foreign tourists, who come to see wildlife on land and in the rivers. It is also home to one of the most endangered primates in Brazil, the pied tamarin.

Tour boats leave Manaus to see the Meeting of the Waters, where the black waters of the Negro River meet the brown waters of the Solimoes River, flowing side by side without mixing for about . Visitors can also explore river banks and &quot;igarapes&quot;, swim and canoe in placid lakes, simply walk in the lush forest or stay at hotels in the jungle.

About from downtown is Ponta Negra beach, a neighbourhood that has a beachfront and popular nightlife area. A luxurious hotel is located at the west end of Ponta Negra; its zoo and orchid greenhouse as well as preserved woods and beach are open for public visits.

The Mercado Adolpho Lisboa, founded in 1882, is the city&#x27;s oldest marketplace, trading in fruit, vegetables, and especially fish. It is a copy of the Les Halles market of Paris. Other interesting historical sites include the customs building, of mixed styles and medieval inspiration; the Rio Negro Palace cultural center; and the Justice Palace, right next to the Amazonas Opera House.

Manaus has also many large parks with native forest preservation areas, such as the Bosque da Ciência and Parque do Mindú. The largest urban forest in the world is located within the Federal University of Amazonas, which was founded on January 17, 1909, and is the oldest federal university in Brazil.

Manaus also has several Malls such as Manauara Shopping, Amazonas Shopping Center, Millennium Shopping, Shopping Ponta Negra, Studio 5 Festival Mall, Shopping Cidade Nova, Manaus Plaza Shopping, Shopping Sao José, and other small Shopping Areas. Most of these malls include large food courts and movie theaters.

===Culture===
The city&#x27;s cultural calendar throughout the year includes the Opera, Theater, Jazz, and Cinema festivals, as well as Boi Manaus (usually held around Manaus&#x27; anniversary on the 24th of October), which is a great celebration of Northern Brazilian culture through Boi-Bumbá music.
=== Amazonas Opera House ===

The Amazonas Opera House, inaugurated in 1896, has 700 seats and was constructed with bricks brought from Europe, French glass, and Italian marble. Several important opera and theater companies, as well as international orchestras, have already performed there. The theater is home to the Amazonas Philharmonic orchestra which regularly rehearses and performs there along with choirs, jazz bands, dance performances, and more.

=== Parks ===

Ponta Negra Cultural, Sport, and Leisure Park

Ponta Negra beach, located from downtown Manaus, is one of the city&#x27;s most important tourist attractions. It also has an amphitheater with a capacity of 15.000 people.

Adolpho Ducke Botanical Garden

The Adolpho Ducke Botanical Garden, inside a ecological reserve, holds a huge number of plant and animal species.

Mindu Municipal Park

It is located in an urban area, in the November 10 Park district. It was created in 1992 to be an area of ecological interest. It covers an area of of forest remaining from the Township, and is used for scientific, educational, cultural and tourist activities. It is one of the last habitats for the pied tamarin, a species of monkey that only inhabits the Manaus region and is considered to be at high risk of extinction. It is possible to walk through four distinct ecosystems in the park: land covered by secondary growth, firm ground brush, sandbanks and degraded areas that were illegally cleared in 1989. It also has an amphitheater for 600 people, gardens planted with medicinal and aromatic herbs, an orchid nursery, aerial trails, and signs aiming to develop environmental education programs.

=== Public swimming areas ===
The Tarumã, Tarumãzinho, and Cachoeira das Almas bayous (branches of rivers), located near the city, are leisure spots for the population on weekends. Manaus has several public swimming areas that are being remodeled and urbanized lately. There are also many private clubs that can be visited.

=== Meeting of Waters ===
The Meeting of Waters (Portuguese: &quot;Encontro das Àguas&quot;) is a natural phenomenon caused by the confluence of the Rio Negro&#x27;s dark water and the Solimões River&#x27;s muddy brown water that come together to form the Amazonas River. For or more, both rivers&#x27; waters run side by side without mixing. The reason for this is not clear, although it is likely that the main factors are differences in the speed of the current, the volumes of water and the different densities of the two rivers. It is not thought that other differences between the two rivers (temperature and acidity) affect the mixing process significantly. The Negro River flows approximately at , while the Solimões River flows at .

=== CIGS Zoo ===
The zoo is open to the public. It is managed by the Brazilian Army and has approximately 300 species of animals from the Amazon fauna.

=== Beaches and waterfalls ===
For outings to beaches and parks situated near the city, it is often necessary to use boats. The beaches are formed right after the river water level starts dropping, which lasts from August to November. Starting in December, as the river rises, the waters invade the sand and the woods on the banks. The Paricatuba Waterfall, located on the right bank of the Negro River, along a small tributary, is formed by sedimentary rocks, surrounded by abundant vegetation. Access is by boat. The best time to visit is from August to February. Love Cascade located in the Guedes bayou, with cold and crystal clear water, is accessible only by boat and, then, hiking through the forest.

Tupé Beach is approximately from Manaus. This beach is well frequented by bathers on holidays and weekends. It is accessible only by boat. Moon Beach is located on the left bank of the Negro River, from Manaus. It is accessed only by boat. The beach is shaped like a crescent moon and is surrounded by rare vegetation. Lion Waterfall is located on km 34 of the AM-010 highway (Manaus-Itacoatiara).
== Sports ==

====2014 FIFA World Cup ====

Manaus was chosen in 2009 to be a host city for the 2014 FIFA World Cup, after a competition to represent the North Region of Brazil with neighboring Pará state capital, Belém.

Manaus was restructured in order to host such a big event. A new airport was built, streets throughout the city were repaved and new and improved sidewalks were built. The communications infrastructure of the city was improved with 4G networks installed by the biggest mobile phone carriers in Brazil.

The Vivaldão, previously the largest stadium in Manaus, was inaugurated in 1970 by the Brazilian national team in their last game in the country before they headed to their victorious 1970 World Cup in Mexico. It was demolished to be replaced by the 44,000 seater Arena Amazônia for the 2014 World Cup.

The first 2014 World Cup match held in Manaus was England vs Italy on June 14. The second match was Cameroon vs Croatia on June 18, to be followed by USA vs Portugal on June 22. The last was Honduras vs Switzerland on June 25. Manaus, known for its intense heat and humidity, was the site of the World Cup&#x27;s first-ever official water break on June 22 in the match between Portugal and the United States.

=== Brazilian jiu-jitsu ===
Manaus is the origin of several world-champion Brazilian jiu-jitsu black belts, mixed martial artists and submission grapplers. Champions such as Fredson Paixão, Wallid Ismail, Saulo Ribeiro, Cristiane De Souza, Alexandre Ribeiro, Ronaldo Souza, Diogo Reis, Micael Galvão, Fabricio Andrey, and Bibiano Fernandes hail from Manaus. Brazilian jiu-jitsu is a major component of MMA (mixed martial arts). José Aldo (born September 9, 1986) is a black belt in Brazilian jiu-jitsu and a notable UFC fighter. Aldo defeated Mike Brown at WEC 44 to win the title and has since successfully defended his WEC title against Urijah Faber &amp; Manvel Gamburyan.

<text>Giv&#x27;at Halfon Eina Ona (, lit: &quot;Halfon Hill Doesn&#x27;t Answer&quot;), also titled Giv&#x27;at Halfon, is a cult Israeli comedy film produced in 1976. It is a good-hearted satire of the Israel Defense Forces which tells the story of a reserves company, watching the Egyptian border in Sinai. Characters such as the conman Sergio Constanza, the Egyptian-born Mr. Hasson, and the huge cook Yosifoun became classics.

The name of the film is a parody of the name of the Israeli patriotic film &quot;Giv&#x27;a 24 Eina Ona&quot; (&quot;Hill 24 Doesn&#x27;t Answer&quot;).

The film was directed and co-written by Assi Dayan and stars members of HaGashash HaHiver: Shaike Levi, Yisrael Poliakov, and Gavri Banai.

==Plot==
Staff Sgt. Raphael &quot;Gingy&quot; Moked is ordered by his company commander, Captain Shamgar, to retrieve Sergio Constanza, a deserter from reserve service. On his way he meets his girlfriend Yaeli and offers to talk to her father, Victor Hasson, to get a blessing for their relationship. Hasson gives his blessing, believing that Moked came for his older daughter Shifra, but throws him out of the house after finding out this was not so. Yaeli does not wish to part from Moked, and sneaks into a suitcase in his jeep. Meanwhile, Constanza tricks several other gamblers into losing thousands of dollars, which he intends to use to repay a debt to Mr. Hasson. The gamblers find out about the plot however, which leaves Sergio with no choice but to run away to the army with Moked.

Moked and Constanza make it to a military camp in the Sinai, and Mr. Hasson follows them, posing as Constanza at the gate to get admission. When he is not allowed into the base, he steals a front loader to break in. Meanwhile, Moked finds out that Yaeli came with them, and Constanza comes up with a plot to make her an authorized visitor, by claiming that she is a singer/entertainer sent from the Education Corps. Mr. Hasson arrives at the base with the loader, and is caught by the soldiers in a fishing net. Shamgar reports the incident to the brigadier. Shamgar then meets with Yaeli, who calls herself &quot;Bule-Bule&quot;, in private and they start dancing African dances half-nude, as she attempts to persuade him that she&#x27;s an entertainer.

As the brigadier is about to arrive, Moked releases Mr. Hasson, who is forced to temporarily reconcile with Constanza. The brigadier finds Shamgar dancing alone and making noises, deems him insane, and takes him away in his helicopter, leaving Moked temporarily in command of the outpost. It is discovered that Mr. Hasson is an excellent cook. He transforms the military kitchen into a restaurant-like establishment, and then denies Constanza access. In revenge, Constanza tricks Hasson into buying a plot of nearby desert land, which Hasson believes to be an oil field, from him as payment of the debt.

Constanza then tries to help Moked by matching one of the soldiers, Wasserman, with Yaeli&#x27;s older sister, Shifra. But when Shifra arrives at the base, she isn&#x27;t impressed with Wasserman, but falls in love with Constanza instead. Hasson leaves the base to catch fish for the soldiers&#x27; dinners, but accidentally crosses the border into Egypt and is taken captive by an Egyptian patrol. While in captivity, Victor becomes friends with the Egyptian commanding officer, who grew up in the same area as him. In the meantime, the Israeli soldiers plan a rescue mission to return the captured Hasson. Although the mission, dubbed &quot;Operation Waldheim&quot; doesn&#x27;t go as planned, Gingy and Constanza, posing as UN observers, succeed in returning Hasson to the base.

When Hasson returns to the base, he discovers that Sergio had conned him once again, and that the plot of land he bought from him wasn&#x27;t really an oil field at all. Out of nowhere, Capt. Shamgar reappears, still searching for &quot;Bule-Bule&quot;. He falls into a pit dug by Hasson on the plot of land, causing an oil geyser to appear and revealing the presence of oil in the land after all. The film ends with Hasson, Moked and Constanza, now his sons-in-law, selling the oil from the back of a truck in Tel Aviv, early in the morning.

==Cast==
* Staff Sgt. Raphael &quot;Gingy&quot; Moked (Gavri Banai) - an IDF non-commissioned officer, in love with Mr. Hasson&#x27;s younger daughter Yaeli. Sent to retrieve the absentee Sergio Constanza and bring him to do his reserve service.
* Sergio Constanza (Yisrael Poliakov) - a Romanian-born conman, who has repeatedly failed to report for reserve duty. He leaves with Gingy for the Sinai in order to escape a several thousand-dollar debt to Mr. Hasson and other gamblers in Tel Aviv. Sergio is a charming, funny crook, cunning and manipulative.
* Victor Hasson (Shaike Levi) - a wealthy Egyptian Jew, who immigrated to Israel and now lives in Tel Aviv with his two daughters, and is determined to get the older daughter, Shifra, married. He pursues Sergio into the Sinai in order to collect a large debt. The scene where Hasson lifts Sergio&#x27;s field-toilet cabin with a loader-bulldozer became a classic.
* Yaeli Hasson (Nitza Shaul) - Mr Hasson&#x27;s younger daughter and Gingy&#x27;s girlfriend. They want to get married but Mr. Hasson refuses his consent until he can marry off his older daughter, Shifra. Following Hasson&#x27;s refusal, Yaeli sneaks into Gingy&#x27;s jeep and finds herself in the Sinai base.
* Shifra Hasson (Miki Kam) - Mr. Hasson&#x27;s older daughter.
* Yosifoun (Moshe Ish Kasit) - the big, strong, but inept cook in the Sinai base.
* Capt. Shamgar (Tuvia Tzafir) - the horny company commander of the Sinai post.

The film also features Hana Laszlo, Oshik Levi and Reuven Adiv

<text>The sensitivity of an electronic device, such as a communications system receiver, or detection device, such as a PIN diode, is the minimum magnitude of input signal required to produce a specified output signal having a specified signal-to-noise ratio, or other specified criteria. In general, it is the signal level required for a particular quality of received information.

In signal processing, sensitivity also relates to bandwidth and noise floor as is explained in more detail below. 

In the field of electronics different definitions are used for sensitivity. The IEEE dictionary states: &quot;Definitions of sensitivity fall into two contrasting categories.&quot; It also provides multiple definitions relevant to sensors among which 1: &quot;(measuring devices) The ratio of the magnitude of its response to the magnitude of the quantity measured.” and 2: &quot;(radio receiver or similar device) Taken as the minimum input signal required to produce a specified output signal having a specified signal-to-noise ratio.”. The first of these definitions is similar to the definition of responsivity and as a consequence sensitivity is sometimes considered to be improperly used as a synonym for &quot;responsivity&quot;, and it is argued that the second definition, which is closely related to the detection limit, is a better indicator of the performance of a measuring system.

To summarize, two contrasting definitions of sensitivity are used in the field of electronics

* Sensitivity first definition: the ratio between output and input signal, or the slope of the output versus input response curve of a transducer, microphone or sensor. An example is given in the section below on electroacoustics.
* Sensitivity second definition: the minimum magnitude of input signal required to produce an output signal with a specified signal-to-noise ratio of an instrument or sensor. Examples of the use of this definition are given in the sections below on receivers and electronic sensors.

== Electroacoustics ==
The sensitivity of a microphone is usually expressed as the sound field strength in decibels (dB) relative to 1 V/Pa (Pa = N/m2) or as the transfer factor in millivolts per pascal (mV/Pa) into an open circuit or into a 1 kiloohm load. The sensitivity of a hydrophone is usually expressed as dB relative to 1 V/μPa.

The sensitivity of a loudspeaker is usually expressed as dB / 2.83 VRMS at 1 metre. This is not the same as the electrical efficiency; see Efficiency vs sensitivity. 
This is an example where sensitivity is defined as the ratio of the sensor&#x27;s response to the quantity measured. One should realize that when using this definition to compare sensors, the sensitivity of the sensor might depend on components like output voltage amplifiers, that can increase the sensor response such that the sensitivity is not a pure figure of merit of the sensor alone, but of the combination of all components in the signal path from input to response.

== Receivers ==
Sensitivity in a receiver, such a radio receiver, indicates its capability to extract information from a weak signal, quantified as the lowest signal level that can be useful. It is mathematically defined as the minimum input signal formula_1 required to produce a specified signal-to-noise S/N ratio at the output port of the receiver and is defined as the mean noise power at the input port of the receiver times the minimum required signal-to-noise ratio at the output of the receiver:

:formula_2

where 
:formula_1 = sensitivity [W]
:formula_4 = Boltzmann constant
:formula_5 = equivalent noise temperature in [K] of the source (e.g. antenna) at the input of the receiver
:formula_6 = equivalent noise temperature in [K] of the receiver referred to the input of the receiver
:formula_7 = bandwidth [Hz]
:formula_8 = Required SNR at output [-]

The same formula can also be expressed in terms of noise factor of the receiver as 

:formula_9

where 
:formula_10 = noise factor 
:formula_11 = input noise power
:formula_12 = required SNR at output.

Because receiver sensitivity indicates how faint an input signal can be to be successfully received by the receiver, the lower power level, the better. Lower input signal power for a given S/N ratio means better sensitivity since the receiver&#x27;s contribution to the noise is smaller. When the power is expressed in dBm the larger the absolute value of the negative number, the better the receive sensitivity. For example, a receiver sensitivity of −98 dBm is better than a receive sensitivity of −95 dBm by 3 dB, or a factor of two. In other words, at a specified data rate, a receiver with a −98 dBm sensitivity can hear (or extract useable audio, video or data from) signals that are half the power of those heard by a receiver with a −95 dBm receiver sensitivity.. 
== Electronic Sensors ==
For electronic sensors the input signal formula_13 can be of many types, like position, force, acceleration, pressure, or magnetic field. The output signal for an electronic analog sensor is usually a voltage or a current signal formula_14. The responsivity of an ideal linear sensor in the absence of noise is defined as formula_15, whereas for nonlinear sensors it is defined as the local slope formula_16. In the absence of noise and signals at the input, the sensor is assumed to generate a constant intrinsic output noise formula_17. To reach a specified signal to noise ratio at the output formula_18, one combines these equations and obtains the following idealized equation for its sensitivity formula_19, which is equal to the value of the input signal formula_20 that results in the specified signal-to-noise ratio formula_12 at the output:

formula_22

This equation shows that sensor sensitivity can be decreased (=improved) by either reducing the intrinsic noise of the sensor formula_17 or by increasing its responsivity formula_24. This is an example of a case where sensivity is defined as the minimum input signal required to produce a specified output signal having a specified signal-to-noise ratio. This definition has the advantage that the sensitivity is closely related to the detection limit of a sensor if the minimum detectable &quot;SNRo&quot; is specified (SNR). The choice for the &quot;SNRo&quot; used in the definition of sensitivity depends on the required confidence level for a signal to be reliably detected (confidence (statistics)), and lies typically between 1-10. The sensitivity depends on parameters like bandwidth &quot;BW&quot; or integration time &quot;τ=1/(2BW)&quot; (as explained here: NEP), because noise level can be reduced by signal averaging, usually resulting in a reduction of the noise amplitude as formula_25 where formula_26 is the integration time over which the signal is averaged. A measure of sensitivity independent of bandwidth can be provided by using the amplitude or power spectral density of the noise and or signals (formula_27) in the definition, with units like m/Hz1/2, N/Hz1/2, W/Hz or V/Hz1/2. For a white noise signal over the sensor bandwidth, its power spectral density can be determined from the total noise power formula_28 (over the full bandwidth) using the equation formula_29. Its amplitude spectral density is the square-root of this value formula_30. Note that in signal processing the words energy and power are also used for quantities that do not have the unit Watt (Energy (signal processing)).

In some instruments, like spectrum analyzers, a &quot;SNRo&quot; of 1 at a specified bandwidth of 1 Hz is assumed by default when defining their sensitivity. For instruments that measure power, which also includes photodetectors, this results in the sensitivity becoming equal to the noise-equivalent power and for other instruments it becomes equal to the noise-equivalent-input formula_31. A lower value of the sensitivity corresponds to better performance (smaller signals can be detected), which seems contrary to the common use of the word sensitivity where higher sensitivity corresponds to better performance. It has therefore been argued that it is preferable to use detectivity, which is the reciprocal of the noise-equivalent input, as a metric for the performance of detectors formula_32.

As an example, consider a piezoresistive force sensor through which a constant current runs, such that it has a responsivity formula_33. The Johnson noise of the resistor generates a noise amplitude spectral density of formula_34. For a specified &quot;SNRo&quot; of 1, this results in a sensitivity and noise-equivalent input of formula_35 and a detectivity of formula_36, such that an input signal of 10 nN generates the same output voltage as the noise does over a bandwidth of 1 Hz.

<text>We Sold Our Soul for Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll is a compilation album by British heavy metal band Black Sabbath, originally released in January 1976 in the UK and 3 February 1976 in the US.

==Album information==
When Black Sabbath signed with NEMS, the label which would release their 1975 album &quot;Sabotage&quot; in the UK, NEMS acquired the band&#x27;s back catalogue and wasted little time compiling this release. Authorized without the band&#x27;s awareness by their previous manager, Patrick Meehan, the band would make no money whatsoever from the release. Although the band had six studio albums to its name at this point, this compilation drew heavily on the first four albums: this would also be a feature of most of the Osbourne-era compilations later released.

The original UK gatefold album, with a matte finish, featured a woman in a coffin holding what looks like a tin foil cross. Additionally, the original record retained Geezer Butler&#x27;s bass solo before &quot;N.I.B.&quot;, but this would be edited from later issues. Some US copies of the LP do not actually include &quot;Wicked World&quot; on the label or on the record itself, though it does appear on the cover. In the UK, &quot;Wicked World&quot; had been only a B-side and was relatively obscure.

Despite the album being an official release, Iommi has been quoted as saying that the first time the band knew of it was when asked to autograph copies which fans presented after concerts.

==Reception==

It was certified Silver in the UK by the BPI on 1 October 1976. In the US the RIAA certified the album as Gold on 7 February 1980, Platinum on 13 May 1986 and 2x Multi-Platinum (generally known as &#x27;Double Platinum&#x27; outside the offices of the RIAA) on 16 March 2000.

<text>Jean Astruc (19 March 1684, in Sauve, France – 5 May 1766, in Paris) was a professor of medicine in France at Montpellier and Paris, who wrote the first great treatise on syphilis and venereal diseases, and also, with a small anonymously published book, played a fundamental part in the origins of critical textual analysis of works of the Bible. Astruc was the first to propose and hypothesize, by using the techniques of textual analysis that were commonplace in studying the secular classics, the theory that Genesis was composed based on several sources or manuscript traditions, an approach now called the &quot;documentary hypothesis.&quot;

==Life and career==
The son of a Protestant minister who had converted to Catholicism, but who returned to Protestantism before his death. Astruc was educated at Montpellier, one of the great schools of medicine in early modern Europe. His dissertation and first publication, submitted when he was only 19, is on decomposition, and contains many references to recent research on the lungs by Thomas Willis and Robert Boyle. After teaching medicine at Montpellier he became a member of the medical faculty at the University of Paris. His numerous medical writings, or materials for the history of medical education at Montpellier, are now forgotten, but the work published by him anonymously in 1753 has secured for him a permanent reputation. This book, brought out anonymously in 1753, was entitled &quot;Conjectures sur les memoires originaux dont il paroit que Moyse s&#x27;est servi pour composer le livre de la Genese. Avec des remarques qui appuient ou qui éclaircissent ces conjectures&quot; (&quot;Conjectures on the original documents that Moses appears to have used in composing the Book of Genesis. With remarks that support or throw light upon these conjectures&quot;). The title cautiously gives the place of publication as Brussels, safely beyond the reach of French authorities.

The safeguard was required since Astruc&#x27;s Languedoc homeland was in the frame of the Counter-Reformation, and the Protestant &quot;Camisards&quot; being deported or sent to the galleys was still a very recent memory. In Astruc&#x27;s own times the writers of the &quot;Encyclopédie&quot; were working under great pressure and in secret, the Catholic Church not offering a tolerant atmosphere for biblical criticism.

That was somewhat ironic, for Astruc saw himself as fundamentally a supporter of orthodoxy; his unorthodoxy lay not in denying Mosaic authorship of Genesis but in his defence of it. In the previous century scholars such as Thomas Hobbes, Isaac La Peyrère, and Baruch Spinoza had drawn up long lists of inconsistencies and contradictions and anachronisms in the Torah and used them to argue that Moses could not have been the author of the entire five books. Astruc was outraged by this &quot;sickness of the last century&quot; and was determined to use modern 18th century scholarship to refute that of the 17th century.

Using methods already well established in the study of the Classics for sifting and assessing differing manuscripts, he drew up parallel columns and assigned verses to each of them according to what he had noted as the defining features of the text of Genesis: whether a verse used the term &quot;YHWH&quot; (Yahweh) or the term &quot;Elohim&quot; (God) referring to God and whether it had a doublet (another telling of the same incident, as the two accounts of the creation of man and the two accounts of Sarah being taken by a foreign king). Astruc found four documents in Genesis, which he arranged in four columns, declaring that it was how Moses had originally written his book, in the image of the four Gospels of the New Testament, and a later writer had combined them into a single work, creating the repetitions and inconsistencies which Hobbes, Spinoza and others had noted.

Astruc&#x27;s work was taken up by a succession of German scholars, the intellectual climate in Germany then being more conducive to scholarly freedom. Those hands formed the foundation of modern critical exegesis of the Old and New Testaments.

Astruc was also the author of &quot;Elements of Midwifery ... With ... an answer to a casuistical letter, on the conduct of Adam and Eve, at the birth of their first child ...&quot; (1766).

<doc id="455102" wikidata="Q764242" url="?curid=455102" title="Pantropical spotted dolphin">
<text>The pantropical spotted dolphin (Stenella attenuata) is a species of dolphin found in all the world&#x27;s temperate and tropical oceans. The species was beginning to come under threat due to the killing of millions of individuals in tuna purse seines. In the 1980s, the rise of &quot;dolphin-friendly&quot; tuna capture methods saved millions of the species in the eastern Pacific Ocean and it is now one of the most abundant dolphin species in the world.

==Taxonomy==
The species was first described by John Gray in 1846. Gray&#x27;s initial analysis included the Atlantic spotted dolphin in this species. They are now regarded as separate. Both the genus and specific names come from Latin words meaning thin or thinning.

Two subspecies of the pantropical spotted dolphin are recognized:
:&quot;S. a. attenuata&quot; or offshore pantropical spotted dolphin, found worldwide in tropical waters
:&quot;S. a. graffmani&quot; or coastal pantropical spotted dolphin, found in coastal waters in the eastern tropical Pacific

Another unnamed subspecies, which inhabits inland Hawaiian waters, was recognized in Rice (1998)&#x27;s overview of marine mammal taxonomy.

==Description==
The pantropical spotted dolphin varies significantly in size and coloration throughout its range. The most significant division is between coastal and pelagic varieties. The coastal form is larger and more spotted. (These two forms have been divided into subspecies only in eastern Pacific populations).

Spots are key defining characteristics in adults, though immature individuals are generally uniformly colored and susceptible to confusion with the bottlenose dolphin. Populations around the Gulf of Mexico may be relatively spot-free even in adulthood. In the Atlantic, confusion is possible with the Atlantic spotted dolphin.

The pantropical spotted dolphin is a fairly slender, streamlined animal, with a dark cape and light spots on its body that increase in number and size as it gets older. This species has a long, thin beak and a falcate dorsal fin, which is the thinnest among dolphins. The upper and lower jaws are darkly colored, but are separated by thin, white &quot;lips&quot;. The chin, throat, and belly are white to pale grey with a limited number of spots. The flanks are separated into three distinct bands of color — the lightest at the bottom, followed by a thin, grey strip in the middle of the flank, and a dark-grey back. The tall dorsal fin is similarly colored. The thick tail stock matches the color of the middle band.

The vocal repertoire of the pantropical spotted dolphin has not been clearly documented. There is no published information about the acoustic signals from South Atlantic Ocean populations of the mammal.

The pantropical spotted dolphin is very active and is prone to making large, splashy leaps from the sea. It is a common breacher and will often clear the water for a second or more. Bow-riding and other play with boats is common.

In the eastern Pacific, the dolphin is often found swimming with yellowfin tuna (hence the problem with dolphin deaths caused by tuna fishing). However, they do not feed on that fish. In fact, the two species have similar diets of small epipelagic fish. In other areas, the species may also feed on squid and crustaceans.

Birth length is 80–90 cm. Adults are about 2.5 m long and weigh 110 to 140 kg. Sexual maturity is reached at 10 years in females and 12 years in males. The average lifespan is around 40 years.

==Population and distribution==
The pantropical spotted dolphin, as its name implies, is widely distributed around tropical and marine waters from 40°N and 40°S and is one of the most common dolphin species in the Atlantic and Indian oceans. The total world population is in excess of three million — the second-most abundant cetacean after the bottlenose dolphin — of which two million are found in the eastern Pacific. However, this represents a decrease from at least 7 million since the 1950s.

The pantropical spotted dolphin is the most common cetacean species observed within the Agoa Sanctuary, located in the Lesser Antilles in the eastern Caribbean. Because it is common within the sanctuary it is considered a resident species; however, no research has been carried out to estimate its population status and movement patterns between islands.

Centres of highest population density are the shallow warmest waters (water temperature in excess of 25 °C). They also tend to concentrate where a high temperature gradient is found.

==Human interaction==

The pantropical spotted dolphin&#x27;s propensity for associating with tuna, particularly in the eastern Pacific, has in recent history been a very real danger. In the 1960s and 1970s, fishermen would capture thousands of dolphin and tuna at once using purse seine nets. The dolphins all died. Over a period of about 25 years, 75% of this region&#x27;s population, and over half the world&#x27;s total were wiped out. The issue has received wide public attention. Many major supermarkets have found it economically expedient to use tuna suppliers whose fisherman catch tuna by more discriminatory means, and thus advertise their tuna product as dolphin-friendly. Some such products are approved by the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Trust.

Negative impacts from fishing activities remain, despite broad &quot;dolphin-safe&quot; practices. Instead of reducing numbers through direct mortalities, fishing activities have disrupted the reproductive output of the northeastern pantropical spotted dolphin. The fishing had a negative impact on calf survival rates and/or birth rates. This could be caused when fishing operations separate mothers from their suckling calves, interfere with the conception or gestation of calves, or a combination of the two.

== Major threats ==
The eastern Pacific populations of pantropical spotted dolphins are divided into 3 units – coastal and 2 offshore populations, northeastern and western-southern. Just under 5 million dolphins were killed between 1959 and 1972. 3 million of these were from the northeastern offshore population unit. Since that time, this subpopulation has been the slowest to recover, if it is truly recovering at all. Natural mortalities are occurring as well, but they are difficult to estimate.

The major threat to &quot;Stenella attenuata&quot; is individuals killed as by-catch in fisheries. Tuna fishermen follow pantropical spotted dolphins in order to find and catch fish. The height of incidental killings was in the 1960s and 1970s. Tuna fishermen from the 1950s to the 1980s in the eastern Pacific killed massive numbers of dolphins, most of which were offshore spotted dolphins.

Another threat to this species is gillnet fisheries in Australia, North Pacific (central and northern areas), Peru, Ecuador, Japan, and Philippines. Trawls in West Africa and long-lining in the Central Atlantic likewise pose significant threats to these species. Small directed catches in other parts of the world are not as well documented. There is a large-mesh pelagic driftnet fishery of eastern Taiwan where a large number of dolphin killings are suspected. The exact number of deaths due to this fishery is unknown.

Japan catches pantropical spotted dolphins for human consumption. The average catch between 2010 and 2019, was 71 dolphins per year.
==Conservation actions==
The eastern tropical Pacific and Southeast Asian populations of the pantropical spotted dolphin are listed in Appendix II of the &quot;Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals&quot; (CMS). As the pantropical spotted dolphin can be divided into three subspecies, studies of these distinct populations would be needed to assess conservation efforts.

In addition, the pantropical spotted dolphin is covered by the &quot;Memorandum of Understanding Concerning the Conservation of the Manatee and Small Cetaceans of Western Africa and Macaronesia&quot; (Western African Aquatic Mammals MoU) and the &quot;Memorandum of Understanding for the Conservation of Cetaceans and Their Habitats in the Pacific Islands Region&quot; (Pacific Cetaceans MoU). The U.S. Marine Mammal Protection Act was established in 1972. U.S. Fishing vessels have since reduced dolphin by-catch deaths by 95%. The U.S. Marine Mammal Protection Act lists the northeastern and coastal stocks as “Depleted.”

Dolphin deaths have greatly decreased since the establishment of the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission (IATTC). The Commission set mortality limits on the international fleet. In 2005, only 373 spotted dolphin deaths were observed.

Dolphin populations are able to grow at 4% per year, but the pantropical spotted dolphin populations did not improve or worsen between 1979 and 2000. The population has not recovered, even though 30 years of management has been in effect.

Although the US and international fishing agencies have reduced dolphin bycatch significantly, the northeastern subpopulation is not showing strong signs of recovery. This lack of recovery of the subpopulations of the pantropical spotted dolphins could be due to the following reasons: calf separation, orphaning, fishery stress, under-reported mortality, and ecosystem change. Observed deaths of these dolphins could be under-reported because small vessels do not have observers, observers do not see the net constantly at all times, injured dolphins die after observation, and dead individuals are not always reported.

<doc id="455108" wikidata="Q1071675" url="?curid=455108" title="Road to Avonlea">
<text>Road to Avonlea is a Canadian television series first broadcast in Canada between January 7, 1990, and March 31, 1996, as part of the &quot;CBC Family Hour&quot; anthology series, and in the United States starting on March 5, 1990. It was created by Kevin Sullivan and produced by Sullivan Films (later Sullivan Entertainment) in association with the CBC and the Disney Channel, with additional funding from Telefilm Canada. It follows the adventures of Sara Stanley, a young girl sent to live with her relatives in early 20th-century eastern Canada. It was loosely adapted from novels by Lucy Maud Montgomery, with many characters and episodes inspired by her stories.

Some episodes were turned into independent books by various authors; around 30 titles have been released.

In the United States, its title was shortened to &quot;Avonlea&quot;, and a number of episodes were re-titled and re-ordered. The series was released on VHS and DVD there as &quot;Tales from Avonlea&quot;.

==Background and development==
The series was initially loosely inspired from a cross section of several books by Lucy Maud Montgomery, primarily &quot;The Story Girl&quot; and &quot;The Golden Road&quot;, both of which feature Sara Stanley and the King family. Set in Prince Edward Island, the books&#x27; stories take place in the village of Blair Water, not Avonlea. Many early episodes&#x27; plots are based on stories from Montgomery&#x27;s &quot;Chronicles of Avonlea&quot; and &quot;Further Chronicles of Avonlea&quot;. The characters of Beverly and Felix (cousins of the King family) and Dan King were changed. Beverly is not in the television series and Felix and Daniel are incorporated as brothers of Felicity and Cecily, with Felix as second oldest after Felicity, and Daniel being the youngest King child.

A number of supporting characters were sourced from Montgomery&#x27;s &quot;Anne of Green Gables&quot; series. The show is set within the same continuity as Sullivan&#x27;s 1985 film and its 1987 sequel adapted from the &quot;Anne&quot; novels. Rachel Lynde, Marilla Cuthbert, and Muriel Stacy all originally appeared in Montgomery&#x27;s debut novel &quot;Anne of Green Gables&quot;, with Rachel and Marilla being briefly mentioned in passing in &quot;Chronicles of Avonlea&quot;. Patricia Hamilton, Colleen Dewhurst, and Marilyn Lightstone, who had played the characters in the films, returned for the &quot;Road to Avonlea&quot; series. The characters of Davy and Dora Keith were originally from &quot;Anne of Avonlea&quot;, the first sequel to the &quot;Anne Of Green Gables&quot; book series. The character of Anne Shirley herself never appears, although she was referred to on rare occasions.

In the United States, the title was shortened to simply &quot;Avonlea&quot;, and a number of episodes were re-titled and re-ordered. When the series was released on VHS and DVD in the United States, the title changed from &quot;Road to Avonlea&quot; to &quot;Tales from Avonlea&quot;.

The series is set in the fictional small town of Avonlea, Prince Edward Island, in the early 20th century (1903–1912). Ten-year-old Montreal heiress Sara Stanley (Sarah Polley) is sent by her wealthy father to live with her two maiden aunts, Hetty and Olivia King, to be near her late mother&#x27;s side of the family after an embezzlement scandal results in him being placed under house arrest. The show&#x27;s focus shifted over the years from Sara&#x27;s interactions with locals to stories about the King family. Later seasons of the show focused more on residents of Avonlea who were connected to the King family. Sarah Polley left the show in 1994, returning for a guest appearance in the sixth season as well as the series&#x27; finale episode.

Following the series proper, a reunion TV movie called &quot;An Avonlea Christmas&quot; was produced in 1998.

==Characters==
===King family===
* Sara Stanley (Sarah Polley): An adventurous 10-year-old girl used to fine living in Montreal who must learn to adjust to a simpler life in Avonlea when her father runs into legal trouble. She moves into Rose Cottage with Hetty and Olivia King, the sisters of her late mother, Ruth.
* Henrietta &quot;Hetty&quot; King (Jackie Burroughs): The oldest King sibling who lives at Rose Cottage with her sister, Olivia. She is a strict disciplinarian and the Avonlea schoolteacher. Burroughs had previously portrayed Amelia Evans in &quot;Anne of Green Gables&quot;.

==Episodes==
==Locations==
The &quot;Road to Avonlea&quot; set was constructed in Uxbridge, Ontario—the town where Lucy Maud Montgomery lived and wrote for a decade after moving from Prince Edward Island. The town of Avonlea was adapted from existing buildings. Its roads were painted red in an attempt to match the distinctive color of the island&#x27;s iron-rich soil. Filming also took place regularly at Westfield Heritage Centre in Flamborough, Ontario. Photography and enhanced digital matter work married second-unit scenes of Prince Edward Island with the Leaskdale location where necessary.

==Home media==
Sullivan Entertainment released all seven seasons on DVD in Region 1 for the first time between 2005 and 2006. In 2009, they began re-releasing the series in wide screen format. As of December 2012, all seven seasons and the Christmas special had been released in widescreen format.

In 2016, Sullivan Entertainment announced it would launch their own streaming service called &quot;Gazebo TV&quot; that would feature the &quot;Road to Avonlea&quot; series among other titles produced by the company. The service launched in early 2017.

<text>John Gillies Mark Grahame (born August 31, 1975) is an American former professional ice hockey goaltender who played in the National Hockey League with the Boston Bruins, Tampa Bay Lightning and Carolina Hurricanes. He won the Stanley Cup with the Tampa Bay Lightning in 2004.

==Playing career==
Grahame played in the USHL for the Sioux City Musketeers before he was drafted in the ninth round, 229th overall by the Boston Bruins in the 1994 NHL Entry Draft. He then elected to play three years of collegiate hockey with the Lake Superior State Lakers of the CCHA, and would later become the only Lakers goaltender to play more than 50 games in the NHL or win the Stanley Cup.

John turned professional in the 1997–98 season, and was assigned by the Bruins to start for the Providence Bruins. In his second pro year, Grahame returned to the P-Bruins and took the team to the playoffs, leading them to victory in the Calder Cup.

In the 1999–2000 campaign, Grahame started the season back in Providence, but was called up to the Boston Bruins mid-season to back up Byron Dafoe in the Bruins&#x27; net, where he played credibly and was second in balloting to the league&#x27;s all-rookie team. However, a broken ankle in the 2000 offseason took a long time to heal, and Grahame struggled to recapture his form. He played for the next three seasons in Boston before being traded midseason in 2003 to the Tampa Bay Lightning. The following season, Grahame returned to standard, having the best season of his career as a backup for the Stanley Cup-winning club. Grahame&#x27;s presence allowed starter Nikolai Khabibulin to get extended rest when he needed.

He became Tampa Bay&#x27;s starting goalie in the 2005–06 NHL season, but was criticized publicly by head coach John Tortorella after consecutive poor starts which contributed to the Lightning being eliminated in the first round of the Playoffs.

Grahame signed a two-year, $2.8 million contract with the Carolina Hurricanes on July 1, 2006. He was placed on waivers by the Hurricanes on January 4, 2008. The Hurricanes called up Michael Leighton from the team&#x27;s AHL affiliate, the Albany River Rats, to replace him as the team&#x27;s backup goaltender after Grahame began the season with a 4–6–1 record. The Hurricanes recalled Grahame on January 21.

During this time, Grahame played a single game for the United States Olympic team in the 2006 Winter Olympics, and also was the starter for the United States National Team in the 2007 World Championships.

In May 2008, after the conclusion of the Hurricanes&#x27; season, as a free agent, Grahame signed with Avangard Omsk of the new Kontinental Hockey League.

On December 12, 2009, Grahame signed a professional tryout contract for the 2009–10 season with the Philadelphia Flyers AHL affiliate, the Adirondack Phantoms. After playing in 12 games with the Phantoms, Grahame signed a contract with the Colorado Avalanche and was assigned to the injury-hit Lake Erie Monsters on March 3, 2010. He played in 14 games, recording only 4 wins, with the Monsters to finish the season and was re-signed on a one-year contract by the Avalanche on July 2, 2010.

He was brought up to the Avalanche on February 11, 2011, after Craig Anderson went back to Denver for personal reasons. He sat on the bench serving as Peter Budaj&#x27;s backup for two contests and did not see any playing time. At the end of the 2010–11 season, he retired after the Monsters made it to the playoffs for the first time in their 4-year history.

On March 28, 2012, he briefly came out of retirement and signed a contract with the New York Islanders to serve as a backup for the injury depleted team through the remainder of the 2011–12 season. At the completion of the season he did not manage to feature in a game for the Islanders.

==Coaching career==
On September 15, 2011, it was announced the Grahame would become the goaltending coach for the Sioux City Musketeers of the USHL, a team that he had previously played for in his career.

==Personal==
He is the son of former professional goaltender Ron Grahame. His father was traded for the draft pick used to select John&#x27;s future teammate Ray Bourque. His mother, Charlotte was a member of the front office of the Colorado Avalanche team that won the Stanley Cup. John and Charlotte are the first mother and son to get their names engraved on the Stanley Cup.

<doc id="455112" wikidata="Q82749" url="?curid=455112" title="Family court">
<text>Family courts were originally created to be a Court of Equity convened to decide matters and make orders in relation to family law, including custody of children, and could disregard certain legal requirements as long as the petitioner/plaintiff came into court with &quot;clean hands&quot; and the request was reasonable, &quot;quantum meruit&quot;. Changes in laws and rules have made this distinction superfluous.

Family courts hear all cases that relate to familial and domestic relationships. Each US state and each country has a different system utilized to address family law cases including decisions regarding divorce cases.

== In the United States ==

Family courts were first established in the United States starting in the late 1910s at the behest of probation officers invested in the success of specialized domestic relations courts. Members of the National Probation Association (NPA) advanced the idea that &quot;combining criminal nonsupport, juvenile delinquency, and divorce into a unified &#x27;family court&#x27; would reduce jurisdictional overlap and ensure deep, rehabilitative treatment by probation officers across family-related conflicts.&quot; This idea was minimally successful and led to varied reformation of family courts throughout the 1920s and 1930s.

The original criminal nature of family courts was slowly replaced by an impliedly civil approach, starting in the 1930s with a New York law designed to treat nonsupport cases as a civil matter. The shift to civil nonsupport across the country and the addition of divorce jurisdiction led to family court dockets becoming more civil in nature. Those found in contempt in civil nonsupport cases were still incarcerated as they were in the criminal nonsupport system.

In 1933, New York established a standalone family court, &quot;somewhat confusedly&quot; called the Domestic Relations Court, to further remove family matters from criminal jurisdiction. However, in reality, this new family court and those that followed blended criminal and civil components, removing the constitutional protections offered by criminal procedure while still maintaining criminal-like enforcement mechanisms. In addition, New York passed the Uniform Support of Dependents Law (USDL) in order to provide a mechanism for interstate civil enforcement of family court rulings. 

Later, as probation officer involvement dwindled (partially attributable to the model Family Courts Act produced by the NPA in 1959) and more family courts retained jurisdiction over divorce, the machinery of family courts began to look even more civil. However, some aspects of family court enforcement still retain their criminal roots in heavy state involvement, including incarceration as a consequence of nonpayment of child support, wage garnishment, revocation of driver&#x27;s licenses, and denial of passport applications. Some family courts still use older criminal nonsupport statutes, even though protections afforded by constitutional criminal procedures are oftentimes not present. Most cases are presided over by a single judge without a jury, except in the State of Texas, where parents have a right to trial by jury. These muddy distinctions between criminal and civil proceedings within family courts have led to calls for reformation, arguing that the seemingly civil nature of family courts is a method used to circumvent criminal procedural protections while still maintaining criminal enforcement machinery.

== In England and Wales ==
Cases involving children are primarily dealt with under the Children Act 1989, amongst other statutes. As of April 22, 2014, there are two family courts:

*The Family Division of the High Court
*The Family Court

The Family Court was created by Part 2 of the Crime and Courts Act 2013, merging the family law functions of the county courts and magistrates&#x27; courts into one.

Two scenarios are covered by the Children Act of 1989: private law cases, where the applicant and respondent are usually the child&#x27;s parents; and public law cases, where the applicant is the local authority and the parents are usually the respondents. There is much debate at present over whether the manner in which the law is administered generally leads to outcomes that are beneficial to the families concerned. In this context, see fathers&#x27; rights.

Cases involving domestic violence are primarily dealt with under Part IV of the Family Law Act 1996.

In England, a family court may be called upon to order child maintenance payments, when the child is either under the age of 16, or under the age of 20 receiving a full-time education (but not higher than A-Level or equivalent).

Alleged abusive partners were sometimes allowed to cross examine their victims in ways that could be extremely stressful. Peter Kyle described this process as &quot;abuse and brutalization&quot; of women by the legal system: &quot;Mothers need the protection of the law and they need to know in advance that the system is there to look out and protect their interests. It only takes one woman to be placed in a situation where she can be legally be asked by the man who has violently abused her; &#x27;When did you last have sex?&#x27; That only has to happen once to realize that the system is corrupted and domestic abuse is going on in our system in the courtroom.&quot; Changes to this process are forthcoming. That the accused is allowed to challenge their accuser is a basic principle of justice. To call an accused person &quot;the abuser&quot; is to prejudge the case.

== In India ==

The Family Courts Act, 1984, was enacted by the Parliament of India to establish Family Courts for resolving disputes related to marriage and family affairs in a conciliatory manner. Family Courts are established for areas with a population exceeding one million and may be established for other areas as deemed necessary by the State Government. Family Courts have jurisdiction over various matters, including divorce, restitution of conjugal rights, guardianship, maintenance, and disputes related to property and matrimonial status.

The Act emphasizes the importance of settlement and reconciliation, and Family Courts are encouraged to make efforts to assist parties in arriving at a settlement. The proceedings in Family Courts may be held in camera, and they have the authority to seek the assistance of medical experts, welfare agencies, and other professionals. 
== In Hong Kong ==

The Family Court of Hong Kong mainly deals with divorces and welfare maintenance for children.

==Family courts based on Islamic law==
In jurisdictions where Sharia and Islamic jurisprudence prevail, family courts follow the rules of Islamic marital jurisprudence.

<text>The I ANZAC Corps (First Anzac Corps) was a combined Australian and New Zealand army corps that served during World War I.

It was formed in Egypt in February 1916 as part of the reorganisation and expansion of the Australian Imperial Force and the New Zealand Expeditionary Force (NZEF) following the evacuation of Gallipoli in December 1915. Along with the II ANZAC Corps, it replaced the original Australian and New Zealand Army Corps (ANZAC). The corps initially participated in the defence of the Suez Canal before being transferred to the Western Front in France and Belgium in late March 1916. Later in 1916 the New Zealand Division was removed from I ANZAC&#x27;s order of battle, swapping with II ANZAC&#x27;s Australian 4th Division.

In November 1917, I ANZAC ceased to exist when the Australian infantry divisions in France were grouped together as the Australian Corps and the New Zealand Division, then part of II ANZAC Corps, was allocated to a British corps.

==History==
===Formation===
Following the evacuation of Gallipoli in December 1915, the Australian and New Zealand forces in Egypt underwent a period of reorganisation and expansion. It was decided to expand the AIF from two infantry divisions to four (later five), while the New Zealand elements of the New Zealand and Australian Division would be split and expanded to form a full division known as the New Zealand Division. The five Australian and one New Zealand infantry divisions were then organised into two corps sized units, known as I ANZAC Corps and II ANZAC Corps.

I ANZAC Corps was initially commanded by Lieutenant General Alexander Godley and comprised the three &quot;veteran&quot; ANZAC divisions—the Australian 1st and 2nd Divisions and the newly formed New Zealand Division. The corps&#x27; divisions were initially manning the defences east of the Suez Canal against the anticipated Turkish invasion of Egypt. The large scale losses suffered by the French at Verdun, however, highlighted the need for more Allied troops in France and shortly after the battle it was decided to transfer the Australian and New Zealand infantry divisions to France. On 13 March 1916, under the command of Lieutenant General Sir William Birdwood—the original commander of the ANZAC—the corps began the process of embarking for France.

===Western Front===
In France the I ANZAC Corps was attached to the British Second Army, and initially positioned in a relatively quiet sector south of Ypres in order to gain experience of trench warfare. The corps went into the line south of Armentières, taking over from the British III Corps which was moving to the British Fourth Army in preparation for the Somme Offensive. The Australian 2nd Division was the first to move on to the line, taking up its position in the trenches on 9 April 1916.

On 5 May I ANZAC experienced its first combat on the Western Front when the Germans launched a raid on the 20th Battalion&#x27;s positions following an artillery barrage, resulting in 100 casualties, and some men and equipment being captured. On 30 May, the 11th Battalion&#x27;s position was also heavily shelled. Throughout June, I ANZAC carried out a number of trench raids on the German positions in their sector. In the period between 20–30 June the corps carried out 10 such raids, and suffered 773 casualties.

In mid-July 1916, with the Somme Offensive faltering, the British commander-in-chief, General Douglas Haig, required fresh divisions to continue the advance. The corps was moved to General Hubert Gough&#x27;s Fifth Army and directed to capture Pozières. By this time the II ANZAC Corps had started to arrive in France from Egypt under the command of General Godley. As Godley was also the commander of the New Zealand Expeditionary Force, it was decided that the New Zealand Division would be more appropriately located under his command so it swapped with the Australian 4th Division in time for the move to the Somme.

Pozières had been attacked unsuccessfully four times prior, however on 23 July 1916 the 1st Division managed to capture the village after making an advance of 1,000 yards. Following this success the Germans began a heavy artillery bombardment of the Australian positions and having suffered 5,286 casualties, the 1st Division was relieved by the 2nd Division two days later. As the area surrounding the village was still in German hands, plans were made for further attacks. 1st Division&#x27;s assault had been successful largely because of good staff work and preparation, however, the divisional commander, Major General Harold Walker, had also refused to be pressured by Gough into attacking before he was ready. The 2nd Division&#x27;s commander, Major General James Gordon Legge, however, did not and in the end he ordered an attack on 29 July without having carried out adequate planning. As a result, the attack failed with a loss of 3,500 casualties and 2nd Division were forced to try again on 4–5 August. This subsequent attack proved more successful, however, over the course of the two attacks the division suffered 6,800 casualties.

Following the fighting around Pozières, all three divisions of I ANZAC took part in the Battle of Mouquet Farm, which took place between 10 August and 3 September 1916. Due to the formation of a salient in the Allied lines, the area surrounding the farm, across which the Australians had to advance, was under the observation of German artillery spotters and as a result of heavy barrages I ANZAC suffered heavily during the battle, with 6,300 casualties, 4,649 of which were suffered by the 4th Division alone. As a result of these losses, the corps was withdrawn to a quiet sector during September and October 1916, before returning to the Somme in November. A bitter winter set in shortly after, however, effectively ending major operations on the Western Front for 1916.

Throughout the end of 1916 and the beginning of 1917, I ANZAC was confined to defensive duties, however, in the spring they began a series of patrols along the front, during which it was discovered that the Germans were withdrawing to the Hindenburg Line. On 17 March, the 2nd Division was involved in the advance towards Bapaume. Following this, elements of the corps took part in the fighting around Bullecourt during April and May and Messines in June in support of II ANZAC before the corps as a whole was committed to the fighting around Ypres as part of the Fifth Army in September 1917.

On 16 September 1917, six weeks after the fighting at Ypres had begun, the 1st and 2nd Divisions took up position at Glencorse Wood under the cover of darkness. Four days later the Australian divisions were part of a renewed Allied offensive. Advancing side-by-side, they formed the centre of the attack in what has since become known as the Battle of Menin Road. The battle proved a success, albeit a costly one as the Australians suffered approximately 5,000 casualties. On 26 September the 4th and 5th Divisions, which had been attached to I ANZAC for the fighting around Polygon Wood carried out a successful attack in which they managed to capture both Polygon Wood and parts of Zonnebeke.

Later, on 4 October both I ANZAC and II ANZAC were involved in an attack on the Broodseinde ridge, with the four ANZAC divisions—1st, 2nd in I ANZAC and 3rd and New Zealand in II ANZAC—serving in the line alongside each other for the first time. After suffering from a heavy German artillery attack, I ANZAC launched an attack to capture pillboxes that dominated the ridge. As the Australian divisions left their trenches they were confronted by a force of Germans in no man&#x27;s land who were carrying out an attack of their own. The two sides clashed with each other on open ground before the Germans were forced to retreat to the ridgeline. Further fighting ensued and afterwards I ANZAC managed to capture most of the German pillboxes on the crest of the ridgeline, but were stopped short of their secondary objective by defensive fire from German positions nearby. In all I ANZAC suffered approximately 4,500 casualties.

As a result of these successes the Allied high command felt that a breakthrough might finally be possible. Heavy rain, however, turned the ground to mud and further offensive actions resulted in heavy casualties for limited gains. By early November I ANZAC Corps was withdrawn from the line around Ypres.

===Disbandment===
In November 1917, the five Australian infantry divisions in France were grouped together as part of the Australian Corps and I and II ANZAC Corps ceased to exist.

==Order of battle==
While the composition of I ANZAC Corps changed a number of times with divisions being attached and detached as required for involvement in a particular campaign, the following order of battle is included for illustrative purposes. It is correct per the corps&#x27; arrival in France in 1916. Also at divisional level there were various support units including artillery field batteries and trench mortars, pioneer battalions and engineer field companies, machine gun companies and field ambulances.

<text>The II ANZAC Corps (Second Anzac Corps) was an Australian and New Zealand First World War army corps. Formed in early 1916 in Egypt in the wake of the failed Gallipoli campaign, it initially consisted of two Australian divisions, and was sent to the Western Front in mid-1916. It then took part in the fighting in France and Belgium throughout 1916 and 1917, during which time it consisted of New Zealand, Australian and British divisions. In November 1917, the corps was subsumed in to the Australian Corps, which concentrated all five Australian infantry divisions. After this, the corps was reformed as the British XXII Corps.

==History==
The corps was formed in Egypt in February 1916 as part of the reorganization of the Australian Imperial Force following the evacuation of Gallipoli in December 1915, under the command of William Birdwood. This corps, along with the I ANZAC Corps, replaced the original Australian and New Zealand Army Corps (ANZAC), following the expansion of the Australian and New Zealand forces in preparation for their deployment to the Western Front.

General Alexander Godley, commander of the New Zealand Expeditionary Force, assumed command of the corps after the I Anzac Corps embarked for France in late March 1916. The corps initially comprised the two &quot;new&quot; Australian divisions—the Australian 4th and 5th Divisions—that had been spawned from the &quot;veteran&quot; 1st and 2nd Divisions. Support troops included the II ANZAC (XXII Corps) Mounted Regiment.

In July 1916, following the arrival of II Anzac in France, the Australian 4th Division was swapped for the New Zealand Division from I Anzac, and II Anzac took over a sector of front-line near Armentières. In mid-July, II Anzac lent the 5th Division to the British XI Corps for a diversionary operation that became known as the Battle of Fromelles.

In June 1917, the corps took part in the Battle of Messines, which was a prelude to the Third Battle of Ypres. During the action, II Anzac was the southernmost of three British corps to attack the Messines Ridge. At this time II Anzac contained the New Zealand Division, the Australian 3rd Division and the British 25th Division. The Australian 4th Division was also attached to the corps as reinforcements and was to mount a follow-up attack after the assault by the other three divisions.

Upon the formation of the Australian Corps in December 1917, which contained all five Australian divisions, II Anzac was reformed as the British XXII Corps. The only Australian troops that remained with the corps were the mounted troops.

<doc id="455124" wikidata="Q6134859" url="?curid=455124" title="James Grant (Iowa politician)">
<text>James Grant (December 12, 1812 – March 14, 1891) was an American lawyer, statesman, and business leader in Davenport, Iowa.

James was born on his family&#x27;s plantation near Enfield in Halifax County, North Carolina, on December 12, 1812. He attended the &quot;University at Chapel Hill&quot; (now known as University of North Carolina) and graduated in 1831, before his eighteenth (18) birthday. While at UNC, he was a member of the Dialectic and Philanthropic Societies. He read law and moved west.

Settling first in Chicago, Grant served as a state&#x27;s attorney for Illinois from 1834 to 1837. Then, in 1840, he moved to the Iowa Territory and opened his law practice. A lifelong Democrat, he served in the Territorial Assembly as a representative for Scott County in 1842 and 1843. As statehood approached and was granted, he attended the Iowa Constitutional Conventions in 1844 and 1846.

His legal practice was very successful, and he made a small fortune representing the railroads. After statehood, he served for several years as judge in the Iowa District Court, but resigned when this created a conflict of interest with his representation of railway lines. In 1851, he invested in and became the first president of the Chicago and Rock Island Railroad.

The definition and rules for a conflict of interest differed in the nineteenth century. His role in the rail industry didn&#x27;t prevent him from running for the State House of Representatives. He served one term there, from 1852 to 1853, was elected Speaker of the House, and was able to secure valuable franchises and right-of-way concessions for the railroad. He also served for a while as mayor of Davenport.

Grant left the railroad and returned to his private legal practice for several years. Around 1880 he retired and moved to California for the climate. He died on March 14, 1891, in Oakland, California. His remains were shipped back to Davenport for his funeral, and he is buried in the Oakdale Cemetery there.

<doc id="455127" wikidata="Q2291067" url="?curid=455127" title="Brazilian Expeditionary Force">
<text>The Brazilian Expeditionary Force (, FEB), nicknamed Cobras Fumantes (literally &quot;the Smoking Snakes&quot;), was a military division of the Brazilian Army and Air Force that fought as part of Allied forces in the Mediterranean Theatre of World War II. It numbered around 25,900 men, including a full infantry division, liaison flight, and fighter squadron.

Placed under United States command, Brazilian troops fought primarily in the liberation of Italy from September 1944 to May 1945, while the Brazilian Navy and Air Force took part in the Battle of the Atlantic from mid-1942 until the end of the war. The FEB operated mostly at the platoon level, seeing heavy combat at the arduous Gothic Line and during the 1945 final offensive. By the end of the war, it took 20,573 Axis prisoners, including two generals and close to 900 officers. The division lost 948 men killed in action across all three services.

Vargas era Brazil was the only independent South American country to send combat troops overseas during the Second World War. Known for its tenacity and bravery, the FEB was well-regarded by both allies and adversaries; it served with distinction in several battles, most notably at Collecchio, Camaiore, Monte Prano, and Serchio Valley. Brazil&#x27;s navy and air force played important roles in protecting Allied shipping and crippling Axis maritime power, inflicting disproportionately high losses on enemy munitions, supplies, and infrastructure.

==Overview==
Brazil&#x27;s participation in World War II on the Allied side was not a foregone conclusion. Although it had supported the Triple Entente in World War I—as had now-Axis-aligned Japan and Romania—the country&#x27;s contribution to the war took place in its waning years and was primarily naval, although it also sent a small military mission to the Western Front. In the years leading up to World War II, Brazil was the biggest non-European consumer of German products and ranked ninth among Germany&#x27;s trading partners overall. It also hosted a large and influential German community that engendered closer ties to Germany.

As in 1914, Brazil in 1939 maintained a position of neutrality, initially trading with both Allied and Axis countries. As the war progressed, trade with the Axis became subject to British and U.S. diplomatic and economic pressure. These efforts included the creation of the Joint Brazil-U.S. Defense Commission, chaired by U.S. Army Major General James Garesche Ord, which was broadly aimed at strengthening military ties between the countries; however, its central goal was to reduce the likelihood of Axis attacks on U.S. shipping across the Atlantic and minimize Axis influence in South America.

Although Brazil was officially neutral, it increasingly cooperated with the Allies, particularly the U.S., shortly after the latter entered World War II in December 1941. The Pan American States Conference, which took place in Rio de Janeiro from 15–28 January 1942, was convened in the wake of the U.S. declaration of war against the Axis powers. The meeting centered on U.S. offers of economic assistance to Latin America countries in return for security cooperation and the severing of diplomatic ties with Axis members; Brazil consequently ended diplomatic relations with Germany, Japan, and Italy by the end of January.

Pursuant to the conference, Brazil permitted the U.S. to set up air bases on its territory in return for assistance in developing a domestic steel industry, Companhia Siderúrgica Nacional, which would serve the American war effort and afterwards benefit the Brazilian economy. The bases were located in the north-central states of Bahia, Pernambuco, and Rio Grande do Norte, where the city of Natal hosted part of the U.S. Navy&#x27;s VP-52 bombing squadron, later becoming the largest overseas U.S. airbase. Brazil also hosted U.S. Task Force 3, which included a squadron equipped to attack submarines and merchant vessels attempting to trade with Japan.

Nevertheless, unlike in 1917, the Brazilian government sought to avoid war and instead maintain economically beneficial ties with both sides. Notwithstanding its formal neutrality and reticence to declare war, Brazil&#x27;s cooperation with the U.S. and break in diplomatic relations prompted immediate German reprisals. From the end of January to August 1942, German U-boats sank 18 Brazilian merchant vessels; the spate of attacks was especially severe after June 16, when Hitler personally called for a &quot;submarine blitz&quot; against Brazil, having considered its closer ties with the U.S. to be tantamount to an act of war. By mid-August, the Germans were targeting shipping closer to Brazil&#x27;s coast; alone sank five Brazilian vessels in two days, causing more than 600 deaths:

:* On August 15, the &quot;Baependi,&quot; traveling from Salvador to Recife, was torpedoed at 19:12. Its 215 passengers and 55 crew members were lost.
:* Less than an hour later, &quot;U-507&quot; torpedoed the &quot;Araraquara&quot;, also traveling from Salvador towards the north of the country. Of the 142 people on board, 131 died.
:* Seven hours after the second attack, the &quot;Anníbal Benévolo&quot; was attacked, killing all 83 passengers and all but four of its 71 crew.
:*On August 17, close to the city of Vitória, the &quot;Itagiba&quot; was hit at 10:45, resulting in 36 deaths.
:*Another Brazilian ship, the &quot;Arará&quot;, traveling from Salvador to Santos, was targeted as it stopped to help the crippled &quot;Itagiba&quot;, suffering 20 fatalities.

In all, 21 German and two Italian submarines sank 36 Brazilian merchant ships, resulting in the deaths of nearly 2,000 people. The wave of August attacks proved to be a breaking point, especially since the victims included army soldiers and religious pilgrims. Brazil &quot;erupted in a wave of revulsions&quot; as anti-Axis demonstrations, some of them violent, spread across most major cities, including Rio de Janeiro. Protestors burned the flags of the Axis powers and chanted &quot;We want war!&quot;; in some cases, German communities were harassed. The passive position of the Vargas government proved untenable in the face of public opinion, and on August 22, within a week of the last U-boat attack, the Brazilian cabinet approved a declaration of war against the Axis nations.

Although Brazil continued to provide much needed supplies, war material, and strategic territory for foreign bases, the decision to contribute troops came several months later, at the Potenji River Conference of 28 and 29 January 1943. Held in Natal, Rio Grande do Norte aboard the , the meeting between U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt and Getúlio Vargas resulted in greater political, economic, and military cooperation between the U.S. and Brazil, including invitations for the latter to play a larger role in the postwar global order. Vargas and Foreign Minister Oswaldo Aranha saw the commitment of soldiers as a means of solidifying the strategic partnership with the U.S., and of enhancing Brazilian prestige and influence on the global stage.

==Navy==

The participation of the Brazilian Navy in World War II was not directly connected to the FEB and the Italian Campaign, as it was largely engaged in the Battle of the Atlantic. Axis naval attacks caused nearly 1,600 deaths, which included 500 civilians, 470 merchant seamen, and 570 sailors of the Navy; roughly one in seven Brazilian sailors would perish in the campaign. A total of 36 ships were sunk by the Germans, with an additional three lost (and 350 killed) in accidental sinkings.

The main task of the Brazilian Navy was, together with the Allies, to ensure the safety of ships sailing between the central and south Atlantic to Gibraltar. Alone or in coordination with Allied forces, it escorted 614 convoys that protected 3,164 merchant ships and troop transports. In the battle against German submarines, Brazilian frigates and submarines used mines and depth charges. According to German documents, the Brazilian Navy attacked German submarines a total of 66 times. 

The Brazilian Navy is confirmed to have destroyed twelve German submarines along its coasts: the U-boats &quot;U-128&quot;, &quot;U-161&quot;, &quot;U-164&quot;, &quot;U-199&quot;, &quot;U-507&quot;, &quot;U-513&quot;, &quot;U-590&quot;, &quot;U-591&quot;, &quot;U-598&quot;, &quot;U-604&quot; and &quot;U-662&quot;.

Among the warships lost by the Brazilian Navy were the minelayer BZ &quot;Camaqua&quot;, which capsized during a storm while escorting a convoy in July 1944, and the light cruiser BZ &quot;Bahia&quot; due to a gunnery accident; the majority of the latter&#x27;s crew were lost. Of the three Brazilian military ships lost during the war, only the freighter-troopship &quot;Vital de Oliveira&quot; was due to the action of an enemy submarine, being sunk by the &quot;U-861&quot; on July 20, 1944.

By the end of the war, the entirety of the South Atlantic convoy had been turned over to the Brazilian Navy, thereby relieving American and British vessels for urgently needed service elsewhere.

===Brazilian fleet during World War II===
==Command==

The Brazilian 1st Division of the FEB was subordinate to the Allied 15th Army Group under Field Marshal Harold Alexander (later succeeded by General Mark Clark), via the US Fifth Army of Lieutenant General Mark Clark (later succeeded by Lieutenant General Lucian Truscott) and the US IV Corps of Major General Willis D. Crittenberger. The entry for the Gothic Line order of battle provides the layout for the Allied and German armies in Italy.

FEB headquarters functioned as an administrative headquarters and link to the Brazilian high command under the secretary of war, General Eurico Gaspar Dutra in Rio de Janeiro. General Mascarenhas de Morais (later marshal) was the commander of the FEB, with General Zenóbio da Costa as chief of the 6th Regimental Combat Team (RCT) of Caçapava (the first FEB RCT to land in Italy), and General Cordeiro de Farias as commander of artillery.

Theoretically, the FEB was organized as a standard U.S. infantry division of that time, complete in all aspects, down to its logistical tail (including postal and banking services), although some of these, like its health services, were found to be deficient and had to be complemented, and in many cases controlled or managed by Americans. Its combat units were, besides the aforementioned 6th RCT, the 1st RCT based in Rio de Janeiro, and the 11th from São João del Rei. Each RCT had about 5,000 men (corresponding in size to today brigades), divided in three then called &quot;battalions&quot; consisting of four companies each, including supporting units for combat, and other army branches, like artillery, engineering, and cavalry. The Brazilian Air Force Fighter squadron was itself under the Mediterranean Allied Tactical Air Force.

==Campaign==

===Preparations===

Soon after Brazil declared war on the Axis, it began a popular mobilization for an expeditionary force to fight in Europe. At that time, Brazil was a country with a traditionally isolationist foreign policy. Its population was largely rural and illiterate, its economy focused on exporting commodities, and it lacked infrastructure in industry, health care, and education, which was needed to support the war effort with material and human resources. Further, an action plan to circumvent these limitations (like the Calogeras Plan of the previous World War) was out of the question because many Brazilian military officers believed that a Nazi-Fascist defeat in Europe would increase demands for democracy within Brazil. At the time, Brazil had a military regime. It had been openly authoritarian from 1937 and sympathetic to Nazi-fascist regimes until 1941. Brazil was thus precluded from pursuing a line of autonomous action in the conflict, and found it difficult to take even a modest role in it.

Faced with the government&#x27;s passivity and unwillingness, Assis Chateaubriand, a mass media magnate, negotiated with US officials stationed in Brazil, for the creation of an expeditionary army division, composed of volunteers from all of Latin America. This division would be financed by him, led by a Brazilian general, and trained by American officials. This initiative was curtailed by the Brazilian government in early 1943.

Almost two years later, Brazil officially entered the war and sent troops to the European Theater of Operations. For comparison, the gap between the US&#x27;s entrance and Operation Torch was almost one year. Several reasons contributed to the delay: political distrust between the Brazilian and American authorities, disagreements over the target size of the Brazilian Expeditionary Force, differences between Brazilian aspirations and American preferences for controlling the force, and disagreements on whether it should be fully trained and armed before boarding or get stationed behind the Italian Front and train there.

In the end, the Brazilian government gathered a force of one Army Division of 25,000 men (replacements included), compared with an initial declared goal of a whole Army Corps of 100,000, to join the Allies in the Italian Campaign.

===Arrival in Italy===

On July 2, 1944, the first 5,000 FEB soldiers, the 6th RCT, left Brazil for Europe aboard the USS &quot;General Mann&quot;, reaching Naples, Italy on July 16. Lacking weapons, equipment, and even an arrangement for barracks, they remained on the docks while waiting to join the U.S. Task Force 45. The poor planning and subsequent embarrassment aroused controversy in Brazilian media. In late July, two more transports with Brazilian troops reached Italy, with three more following in September and November 1944, and February 1945. One notable unit deployed was Brazil&#x27;s Mountain Infantry Battalion.

The FEB dedicated its first weeks in Italy to acquiring the proper equipment to fight on Italian terrain, and to training under American command. The preparation in Brazil, despite the two years&#x27; interval since the declaration of war, had proved almost worthless. Among the veterans of that campaign, there was a consensus that only combat could adequately prepare the soldier, regardless of the quality of training received earlier. In August, the troops moved to Tarquinia, 350 km north of Naples, where Clark&#x27;s army was based. In November, the FEB joined General Crittenberger&#x27;s US IV Corps.

In November, the Brazilians joined a multinational hodgepodge of soldiers. American forces included the segregated African-American 92nd Infantry Division and the Japanese-American 442nd Infantry Regiment. British forces drew from across the empire, including Australia, New Zealand, Canada, India, Nepal, Mandatory Palestine, South Africa, Rhodesia, and various African colonies. Also under British command were soldiers from occupied countries such as Poland, Greece, and Czechoslovakia, as well as anti-fascist Italians. Free French forces included Senegalese, Moroccans and Algerians.

The Germans made much of the political aspect of Brazil&#x27;s presence in Italy; propaganda was targeted specifically at Brazilians, in the form of leaflets and a Portuguese-language, hour-long daily radio broadcast from Berlin Radio called &quot;Hora AuriVerde&quot; (GoldenGreen Hour).

===Combat===
The FEB achieved battlefield successes at Massarosa, Camaiore, Mount Prano, Monte Acuto, San Quirico, Gallicano, Barga, Monte Castello, La Serra, Castelnuovo di Vergato, Soprassasso, Montese, Paravento, Zocca, Marano sul Panaro, Collecchio and Fornovo di Taro.

The first missions the Brazilians undertook in close connection with the US 370th Infantry Regiment, were reconnaissance operations to the end of August. Brazilian troops helped to partially fill the gap left by divisions of the US VI Corps and French Expeditionary Corps that left Italy for Operation Dragoon, the invasion of southern France. On September 16, the 6th RCT took Massarosa. Two days later it also took Camaiore and other small towns on the way north. By then, the FEB had already conquered Monte Prano, and taken control of the Serchio valley without any major casualties. After having suffered its first reverses around Barga city, and after the arrival of the 1st RCT at the end of October, the FEB was directed to the base of the northern Apennines, on the border between Tuscany and Emilia-Romagna regions, where it would spend the next months facing the harsh winter and the resistance of the Gothic Line. Allied forces were unable to break through the mountains over the winter and an offensive by German and Italian divisions to the left of the FEB sector, against the US 92nd Infantry Division, required the assistance of the 8th Indian Infantry Division before it was repelled.

Between the end of February and the beginning of March 1945, in preparation for the Spring offensive, the Brazilian Division and the U.S. 10th Mountain Division were able to capture important positions in the northern Apennines (noteworthy in the Brazilian sector, for Monte Castello and Castelnuovo), which deprived the Germans of key artillery positions in the mountains, whose effective fire had since the fall of 1944 blocked the Allied path to Bologna.&quot;Frankly, you Brazilians are either crazy or very brave. I never saw anyone advance against machine-guns and well-defended positions with such disregard for life ... You are devils&quot; — A German captain to a captured FEB lieutenant. In the US Fifth Army&#x27;s sector, the final offensive on the Italian Front began on 14 April, after a bombardment of 2,000 artillery pieces; an attack carried out by the troops of US IV Corps led by the Brazilian Division took Montese. After the first day of the Allied offensive, the Germans, without much effort, had stopped the main attack of IV Corps led by the US 10th Mountain Division, causing significant casualties among the troops of that formation. The Germans were misled into thinking that the FEB&#x27;s raid over Montese, using M8 armoured cars and Sherman Tanks, could be the real main Allied objective in that sector, which led them to shell the Brazilians with 1,800 artillery rounds from the total of 2,800 used against all four Allied divisions in that sector during the days of the battle for Montese, when they tried unsuccessfully to take Montese back from the Brazilians. After that, the breaking of the Germans&#x27; lines to the north by forces of IV Corps became unavoidable. On the right, the Polish Division, from the British 8th Army, and the US 34th Infantry Division, from Fifth Army, entered Bologna on 21 April.

On 25 April the Italian resistance movement started a general partisan insurrection at the same time as Brazilian troops arrived at Parma and the Americans at Modena and Genoa. The British 8th Army advanced towards Venice and Trieste.

At the Battle of Collecchio, Brazilian forces were preparing to face fierce resistance at the Taro river region from the retreating German-Italian forces in the region of Genoa/La Spezia that had been set free by troops of the 92nd US Division. These Axis troops were enveloped near Fornovo and after some fighting surrendered. On April 28, the Brazilians captured more than 13,000 men, including the entire 148th Infantry Division, elements of the 90th Panzergrenadier and the Italian 1st Bersaglieri &quot;Italia&quot; Division.
This took the German Command by surprise as it had planned for these troops to join forces with the German-Italian Army of Liguria to counterattack against the Fifth Army. Fifth Army had advanced, as is inevitable in these situations, in a fast but diffuse and disarranged way uncoordinated with air support, and had left some gaps on its left flank and to the rear. The Axis forces had left many bridges intact along the Po River to facilitate a counter-attack. German Army Command was already negotiating a truce in Caserta, and hoped that a counterattack would improve the conditions for surrender. The events in Fornovo disrupted the German plan, as much by the disarray of their troops as by the delay it caused. This, added to the news of Adolf Hitler&#x27;s death and the taking of Berlin by the Red Army, left the German Command in Italy with no option but to accept the demand for the unconditional surrender of its troops.

In their final advance, the Brazilians reached Turin and then on 2 May they joined up with French troops at the border in Susa. That same day brought the announcement of the end of hostilities in Italy.

==Air force==

===1st Fighter Squadron===

The 1st Fighter Aviation Group (1oGAVCA, 1st Fighter Squadron/1º Grupo de Aviação de Caça) was formed on December 18, 1943. Its commanding Officer was Ten.-Cel.-Av. (Aviation Lieutenant Colonel) Nero Moura. The Squadron had 350 men, including 48 pilots. It was divided into four flights: Red (&quot;A&quot;), Yellow (&quot;B&quot;), Blue (&quot;C&quot;), and Green (&quot;D&quot;). Unlike the FEB&#x27;s Army component, the 1oGAVCA had personnel who were experienced Brazilian Air Force (Portuguese: Força Aérea Brasileira, or FAB) pilots. One of them was Alberto M. Torres, who commanded the PBY-5A Catalina that had sunk (which had been operating off the Brazilian coast).

Among the 48 pilots of the Brazilian Unit who carried out war missions, there was a total of 22 losses; five of the pilots were killed by anti-aircraft fire, eight had their planes shot down and bailed out over enemy territory, six had to give up flying operations on medical orders and three died in flying accidents.

The squadron trained for combat at U.S. bases in Panama, where 2o Ten.-Av. (Aviation Second Lieutenant) Dante Isidoro Gastaldoni was killed in a training accident. On May 11, 1944, the squadron was declared operational and became active in the air defense of the Panama Canal Zone. On June 22, the 1oGAVCA traveled to the US to convert to the Republic P-47D Thunderbolt.
On September 19, 1944 the 1oGAVCA left for Italy, arriving at Livorno on October 6. Since the &quot;Group&quot; arrived at the front with the &quot;Minimum Limit Number&quot; of pilots for an Air Group, and there was no prediction of replacements arrival in a forthcoming future, it was attached as a Squadron at the 350th Fighter Group of the USAAF, which in turn was part of the 62nd Fighter Wing of the 12th Air Force, into the XXII Tactical Air Command.

The Brazilian pilots initially flew from 31 October 1944, as individual elements of flights attached to 350th FG squadrons, at first in affiliation flights and progressively taking part in more dangerous missions. Less than two weeks later, on November 11, the Brazilian &quot;Squadron&quot; started its own operations flying from its base at Tarquinia, using its tactical callsign &quot;Jambock&quot;. Brazilian Air Force stars replaced the white U.S. star in the roundel on the FAB Thunderbolts. The 1oGAVCA started its fighting career as a fighter-bomber unit, its missions being armed reconnaissance and interdiction, in support of the U.S. Fifth Army, to which the FEB was attached. On April 16, 1945, the U.S. Fifth Army started its offensive along the Po Valley. By then, the strength of the &quot;Group&quot; had fallen to the standard size of an air squadron: 23 pilots, since some had been killed, others shot down and captured, while others had been relieved from their duties on medical grounds due to wounds or combat fatigue.

On 22 April 1945, the three remaining flights took off at five-minute intervals, starting at 8:30 AM, to destroy bridges, barges, and motorized vehicles in the San Benedetto region. At 10:00 AM, a flight took off for an armed reconnaissance mission south of Mantua. They destroyed more than 80 German military vehicles, including tanks. By the end of the day, the Brazilian Squadron had flown 44 individual missions and destroyed a high number of vehicles and barges. On this day Brazilians flew the most sorties of the war; consequently, Brazil commemorates April 22 as &#x27;Brazilian Fighter Arm&#x27; Day. The 1st Brazilian Fighter Squadron accomplished 445 missions, with a total of 2,546 flights and 5,465 hours of flight on active service. It destroyed 1,304 motor-vehicles, 13 railway wagons, 8 armoured cars, 25 railway and highway bridges and 31 fuel tanks and munition depots.

In all, the 1oGAVCA flew a total of 445 missions, 2,550 individual sorties, and 5,465 combat flight hours, from November 11, 1944 to May 6, 1945. The XXII Tactical Air Command acknowledged the efficiency of the Brazilian Squadron by noting that although it flew only 5% of the total of missions carried out by all squadrons under its control, it accomplished a much higher percentage of the total destruction wrought:

* 85% of the ammunition depots
* 36% of the fuel depots
* 28% of the bridges (19% damaged)
* 15% of motor vehicles (13% damaged)
* 10% of horse-drawn vehicles (10% damaged)

Total of operations of the First Brazilian Fighter Squadron in the Italy Campaign:

On April 22, 1986, the 1st Fighter &quot;Group&quot; of the Brazilian Air Force was awarded the United States Presidential Unit Citation for its actions in the Po Valley region of Italy in World War II.

===1st Liaison &amp; Observer Flight===
In contrast to the 1st Fight Squadron, which was an Air Force unit that operated in support of the army, the 1st &quot;Liaison &amp; Observer Flight&quot; (Portuguese acronym: &quot;E.L.O.&quot;) was directly under the command of the FEB. Formed in late July 1944, the 1st &quot;E.L.O.&quot; consisted of reservist officers, namely Air Force pilots and Army artillery observers, who flew together aboard Piper L-4H Cubs. This air unit accompanied the Brazilian division throughout its Italian campaign.

==Aftermath==
The FEB participated in the post-war occupation of Piacenza, Lodi, and Alessandria. U.S. leaders wished for Brazilian troops to take part in the Allied occupation of Europe, but in early June 1945, Brazil&#x27;s secretary of war ordered that the unit be subordinate to the commander of the first military region in Rio de Janeiro; it was recalled to Brazil by the end of 1945 and, amid U.S. objections, was dissolved as a distinct military formation. According to historian Frank McCann, Brazil was invited to join the Allied occupation forces in Austria after World War II. However, the Brazilian government was concerned that the FEB might gain political leverage from its contributions to the Allied victory, however modest. Consequently, the government decided to officially demobilize the FEB as soon as the war ended, even while the troops were still stationed in Italy. 

Upon their return to Brazil, former members of the FEB faced various restrictions. Non-military veterans, who were discharged upon their return, were prohibited from wearing their decorations or expeditionary uniforms in public. Professional military veterans were reassigned to frontier regions or areas far from major urban centers.

Hundreds of Brazilians who perished in the final offensive were buried in the FEB cemetery in Pistoia. At the urging of Marshal Mascarenhas de Moraes, a new mausoleum was constructed in Rio de Janeiro for all military deaths in the war; in 1960, the cemetery was closed and the remains were officially interred with other Brazilian war dead in the new National Monument to the Dead of World War II. Shortly afterward, a body was found remaining in the former cemetery, and the Brazilian government inaugurated a new Tomb of the Unknown Soldier on the site in 1967.

Brazil&#x27;s participation in World War II was more extensive than in any foreign conflict outside its region. Its main contribution was to the south Atlantic campaign, which was described by U.S. rear admiral Samuel E. Morison as decisive to Allied victory. However, sending a ground force overseas had more political and social visibility, elevating the country&#x27;s global stature and evoking national pride. The FEB was one of about 30 Allied military formations (20 divisions and 10 brigades) on the Italian Front at that time. Although it played an important part in the sectors where it operated, Brazil&#x27;s role was largely tactical, and it never had a major impact on a strategic level. Furthermore, the Italian Front became secondary for both sides after the Normandy landings in June 1944 and the invasion of southern France that August. Nevertheless, the FEB was viewed by contemporaries as a largely effective fighting force, which &quot;completed all the missions confided to it and compared favorably with the American divisions of the Fourth Corps.&quot;

==Nickname==

Due to the Brazilian regime&#x27;s unwillingness to get more deeply involved in the Allied war effort, by early 1943 a popular saying was: &quot;Mais provável uma cobra fumar um cachimbo, do que a FEB ir para a frente da luta&quot; (literally: &quot;It&#x27;s more likely for a snake to smoke a pipe than for the FEB to go the front and fight&quot;). Before the FEB entered combat, the expression &quot;a cobra vai fumar&quot; (&quot;the snake will smoke&quot;) was often used in Brazil in a context similar to &quot;when pigs fly&quot;; soldiers in the division subsequently called themselves &quot;Cobras Fumantes&quot; (literally, &quot;Smoking Snakes&quot;) and wore a shoulder patch depicting a green snake smoking a pipe. It was also common for Brazilian soldiers to write on their mortars, &quot;A Cobra Está Fumando...&quot; (literally: &quot;The Snake Is Smoking...&quot;). After the war the meaning was reversed, signifying that something will definitively happen in a furious and worse way. With that second meaning the use of the expression &quot;A Cobra Vai Fumar!&quot; (literally: &quot;The Snake Will Smoke!&quot;) has been retained in Brazilian Portuguese until the present.

<text>Rodney &quot;Rod&quot; Milburn Jr. (May 18, 1950 – November 11, 1997) was an American athlete who won gold at the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich in the 110m hurdles.

Milburn attended J. S. Clark High School in Opelousas, Louisiana.

== Career ==

During the early 1970s, Milburn dominated the 110m hurdles, tying or breaking the world record for the 110 m hurdles/120 yards five times.
1971, as a sophomore at Southern University, was when Milburn announced himself on the national and world stage. Amongst his achievements that year was his first world record. In a semi-final of the USA Championships he broke the record for 120 y with 13.0 s. Milburn went on to win the title, in 13.1 s. Milburn was to remain undefeated in 1971, including winning the 110m hurdles event at the 1971 Pan-American Games. He also showed his versatility by winning a bronze as a member of the United States sprint relay team at the Pan-American Games. With these performances, Milburn earned the nickname &quot;Hot Rod&quot;, and was awarded the Track and Field News Athlete of the Year Award. His home state, Louisiana, also recognised him by awarding him the James J. Corbett Award as the outstanding male athlete from the state in 1971. He was to receive the same award a second time in 1973. He was the 1973 NCAA Indoor Champion for 60 yard hurdles.

The overwhelming favourite to qualify for the 1972 Munich Olympics. Milburn in fact struggled but did qualify in 3rd place at the USA Olympic Trials. In the final he hit hurdles due to the pressure of the world-record holder Willie Davenport running alongside him and only managed to hold the vital third and last qualifying place by a foot. In Munich Milburn won the gold medal in the 110m hurdles, tying the world record of 13.2 seconds, finishing ahead of Guy Drut and Thomas Hill. This time, which was recorded as 13.24 to the hundredth of a second, would become the first world record when only automatically recorded times would be ratified as world records.

Milburn&#x27;s triumph was overshadowed by other events. The qualifying rounds for the 110 m hurdles event was delayed by the suspension of the games following the terrorist attack in the Olympic Village. The final itself was then overlooked due to the furor over the behaviour of the American 400 meter runners Vince Matthews and Wayne Collett on the medal rostrum at their medal award ceremony.

In 1973 Milburn continued to demonstrate he was the world&#x27;s pre-eminent high-hurdler by breaking the world record for the 110 m hurdles with a 13.1 s, knocking 0.1 s off a record that had lasted for 14 years, and equalling his own world record for 120 y hurdles of 13.0 s. The record-breaking times in the 110 m hurdles happened on July 6 in Zurich, Switzerland and on July 22 in Sienna, Italy; the record-equalling time in the 120 y hurdles happened on June 20 in Eugene, Oregon.

After this season, with no prospect of playing American football professionally and not able to endorse commercial products as an amateur athlete, Milburn joined the fledgling professional athletics tour run by the International Track Association (ITA). He was to remain unbeaten in their 1974 season. The ITA folded in 1976. By running as a professional, Milburn was ineligible to compete at the Olympics and defend his title.

In 1975, Milburn tried briefly to become an American football player with the fledgling World Football League team the Shreveport Steamer. His try out was unsuccessful.

Milburn returned as a hurdler in 1980 in time for an attempt at an Olympic comeback. However, the boycott of the Olympics denied him that possibility. He did, however, run as an amateur for two seasons with some success against the new generation of high hurdlers.

Sporting commentators note that Milburn was important in the history of hurdling for introducing two innovations: the double-armed lead (to reduce time in the air) and the dime on the hurdle practice technique (knocking off dimes placed on the top of each hurdle without touching the actual hurdle).

== Early life ==

Milburn turned to the hurdles under the tutelage of his high school coach Claude Paxton at J.S. Clark High School in Opelousas, Louisiana.

By his senior year, he was the outstanding high school hurdler in the United States and broke the national age record for the 120 y hurdles at 13.5 s. Acknowledgments of his achievements at high school included being voted on the Louisiana Sports Writers Association All-State track and field team in both his junior and senior years.

Following high school, he went to Southern University in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, with an athletics scholarship.

Here he met Willie Davenport, the 1968 110 m hurdles champion, who recognised his potential as a future Olympic champion and mentored the young athlete. He was coached at college by Dick Hill who had coached amongst others Bob Hayes the 1964 100 m Olympic champion.

== Later life ==
Milburn finally retired from athletics in 1983. Milburn was appointed the head track coach at Southern University in Baton Rouge, Louisiana in 1984 by his old college coach, Dick Hill. When Hill left Southern University in 1987, his replacement did not renew Milburn&#x27;s contract.

Milburn struggled after this and took a job as a utility crewman at a paper and pulp mill of the Georgia-Pacific Corporation in Port Hudson, Louisiana: it was while working at this plant that Milburn died after falling into a tank containing a sodium chlorate solution.

His death came as a huge shock to a track and field community that vividly remembered his achievements on the track. At his funeral, a message of condolence from President Bill Clinton and his wife, Hilary, was read.

For Milburn, it was a great misfortune that his best years came at a time when it was impossible for even an Olympic champion to earn a good living from track: by running professionally, he had made himself ineligible to defend his Olympic title in 1976, and was then denied a chance to run in the 1980 Olympics by the 1980 Olympics boycott even when his eligibility for entry was reinstated. In the end, a court injunction allowing the former professional athletes to run at the Olympic Trials came too late for Milburn to compete.

Milburn was honoured as one of Louisiana&#x27;s top 50 athletes of the 20th Century by Sports Illustrated. and in 1988 was inducted into the Louisiana Sports Hall of Fame.

== Rankings ==
Milburn was ranked among the best in the USA and the world in the 110m hurdles, in two periods separated by his time on the professional athletics circuit, according to the votes of the experts of &quot;Track and Field News&quot;.


==USA Championships==

Milburn was a very successful competitor at 110 m hurdles in the USA National Track and Field Championships during two periods between 1970 and 1981 separated by his time on the professional athletics circuit.:

In addition, Milburn was four times United States champion indoors at 60 m/60 y hurdles – in 1972–73 and 1980–81. He also set world records indoors for 50 y hurdles in 5.8 s, the 55 m hurdles in 6.8 s, and the 60 y hurdles in 6.7 s.

<doc id="455131" wikidata="Q1711138" url="?curid=455131" title="Servia, Greece">
<text>Servia () is one of the main towns in the Kozani regional unit, West Macedonia, Greece. It is one of the most historical places in the region, with a 6th-century Byzantine castle and the Kamvounia mountain dominating the landscape. There are also a number of 10th century Byzantine cave hermitages and small churches located nearby, which add to the Byzantine atmosphere of the area.

Since the local government reform of 2019, it is the seat of the extended municipality of Servia. From 2011 to 2019, the town was the seat of the Municipality of Servia-Velventos. The town itself has a population of 3,174 people (2021 census). The municipal unit Servia has an area of 400.116 km2, the community (the town proper) has an area of 51.603 km2.

== Etymology ==
Its name derives from the Latin verb &quot;servo&quot;, meaning &quot;to watch over&quot; or from the ethnonym &quot;Serb&quot;, replacing what is thought to be the ancient name of the town Phylacae () from the Greek verb () &quot;to watch over&quot;. 
The ancient name of the town of Servia is also mentioned by Roman writer Pliny the Elder as well as on an Ancient Greek inscription found at the city of Veroia which reads: &quot;&quot; (), i.e. &quot;Parmenion son of Glauceas from Phylacae winner at Doliche&quot;.

== History ==

===Prehistoric period===
Servia has given its name to the prehistoric settlement site beside the former bridge across the Haliakmon river to the west and now submerged deep below the surface of Lake Polyphytos. This was first reported by Alan John Bayard Wace and first excavated by the British School at Athens under the direction of Walter Abel Heurtley in 1930. Renewed excavations were jointly conducted by the Greek Archaeological Service and the British School at Athens under the direction of Aikaterina Rhomiopoulou and Cressida Ridley between 1971 and 1973; in advance before the completion of the Polyphytos hydro-electric dam and the flooding of the valley, to create Polyphytos lake.

The site is a low mound created by the debris of successive phases of human occupation, starting in the Middle Neolithic period before 5000 BCE. The square or rectangular buildings, one or two storeys in height, were framed with massive oak posts and the walls were created with wattle and daub. The &#x27;classic&#x27; red on cream ceramic repertoire of this phase is closely related to that of Thessaly at such sites as Sesklo and Achilleion. Typical shapes are fruitstands, shallow bowls and beakers. Bone and stone tools are frequent while ornaments of stone and sea shell (Spondylus gaederopus and Glycimeris) are quite frequent. Occupation continued for a thousand years until the early stages of the Late Neolithic period, characterised by black burnished and grey-on-grey pottery. Occasional fragments of pottery of other styles, together with occasional pieces of obsidian from Melos show that long distance &#x27;trade&#x27; links had been established with coastal Thessaly and Eastern Macedonia. After a long interval, occupation resumed in the Early Bronze Age (3rd millennium BC)when the ceramic repertoire suggests a cultural orientation towards Central Macedonia rather than Thessaly.

Palaeobotanical studies of seeds and other plant remains recovered from all periods at the site and studied by R. Housely and R. Hubbard provide important information about early Greek agricultural practices.

===Ancient period===
During ancient times, Servia served as a fort for the passageway between Macedonia and Thessaly, hence its name. As time passed people settled around the area and the town of Phylacae was created. People that have passed through the then town of Servia, include Alexander the Great, on his way to Thebes in 335 B.C., and Apostle Paul during his journey to Macedonia in the first century A.D.

===Byzantine period===
Servia reached its peak as part of the Eastern Roman Empire when it developed as a strong castle-city (Greek: καστροπολιτεία) guarding the ancient passage from Macedonia to Thessaly. In October 1256, Theodoros II Laskaris, emperor of Nicaea, married his daughter Maria to Nicephorus Angelos, son of the despot of Epirus Michael II Komnenos. As a wedding gift, Theodoros was given the cities of Servia and Dyrrachium. As Servia was a prosperous Byzantine town due to trade, it is mentioned in a large number of medieval texts, by writers such as emperor Constantine VII in the mid 10th century, and by Emperor John VI in the 14th century. Servia is also mentioned in the Chronicle of the Morea.

===Ottoman period===
The Ottoman Turks captured Servia in 1393. In 1519 (Hijri 925) the town had 49 Muslim and 646 Christian households; it was a zeamet of Mevlana Ahmet Çelebi. In 1745 the seat of the Bishop of Servia was moved to the nearby city of Kozani being renamed as the Holy Diocese of Servia and Kozani. At the start of the Greek revolution in 1821, the Ottomans ordered Turkish and Albanian irregular military to plunder the region and prevent the formation of links with Greek revolutionaries of the Olympus and Vermio regions. After the collapse of the Greek revolution in Macedonia, revolutionaries of the region moved to the South, where they joined forces with Greeks in the Peloponnese. A prominent revolutionary from the town was Zisis Sotiriou. In 1864, the town became the seat of the Sanjak of Serfiğe in the Manastir Vilayet, and the town was known as (also written as Serfidze) in Ottoman Turkish.


===20th century===
The Greek army entered Servia on 10 October 1912, during the First Balkan War, after its victory against the Ottoman army in the Battle of Sarantaporo. On the same day, 117 prominent citizens of Servia were gathered and executed by the Ottomans who were leaving the city, 75 to 90 severed human heads were lined up on either side of one of its streets. From then on the main road of the town leading to the Town Hall is called &quot;117 Εθνομαρτύρων&quot; (&quot;117 ethnomartyron&quot;), i.e. &quot;Of the 117 National martyrs&quot;, in remembrance of this dreadful event. Servia was granted to the Kingdom of Greece by the Treaty of Bucharest in 1913.

During the Second World War, on 6 March 1943, Italian troops set the town on fire in response to the defeat and capture of an Italian battalion at the Battle of Fardykambos by the Greek Resistance. After this fire the whole town was left in ruins and most of Greek neoclassical architecture was lost apart from 3 houses which remain until today. One of them was turned into the Folk Museum of Servia.

===Recent history===

Today Servia stands as one of the main towns and agricultural centres of the surrounding region, with the extended Servia municipality having a population of 9,467 people (2021 census). Main road access into Servia is provided by Greek National Road 3, which passes through the town and is part of the European route E65, connecting the cities of Florina and Kozani with Larissa.

A recent historical event that occurred in Servia, was a holy liturgy, celebrated by Metropolitan Paulos of Servia and Kozani at the 7th century Metropolitan Church of St. Demetrius (now in ruins). The event which took place during the summer of 2008 was the first liturgy at the site after 600 years. On Thursday 28 June 2012, the Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew visited Servia taking part in Great Vespers at the Church of Agia Kyriake and afterwards visited the old Basilica of Agios Demetrios and the Byzantine castle-city of Servia. The patron Saint of the town is Agia Kyriake.

==Administration==

The municipality of Servia consists of three municipal units:
*Kamvounia

==Culture and sports==
The Philharmonic band of the town, established in 1928, is run by the &quot;Morphotikos Omilos Servion&quot;, which is the main Cultural Society of the town. It organises a wide range of cultural events and supports teaching classes for children and adults in painting, dance, choir, and chess. Hang gliding is prominent in the area as national championships are held at the cliffs near Kastania. The Servia cycling competition is held annually, with cyclists from all over the country completing one round of the Polyphytos lake; the cycling tour is about 60 km long at 1000 m altitude. Rowing and other water sports at the lake are also established, via the Kozani nautical club. The town&#x27;s football team is &quot;Titan&quot; (Τιτάν), founded in 1927, and the basketball team is &quot;Anagennisi&quot; (Αναγέννηση). The annual trade festival of Servia, locally known as (), peaks at the last weekend of September, attracting people from the wider region of Western Macedonia. It was most probably established during Byzantine times, with the earliest written account being in the year 1556.

<doc id="455137" wikidata="Q454996" url="?curid=455137" title="S scale">
<text>S scale (or S gauge) is a model railroad scale modeled at 1:64 scale, S scale track gauge (space between the rails) is . S gauge trains are manufactured in both DC and AC powered varieties. S gauge is not to be confused with &quot;toy train standard gauge&quot;, a large-scale standard for toy trains in the early part of the 20th century.

==History==
S scale is one of the oldest model railroading scales. The earliest known 1:64 scale train was constructed from card stock in 1896. The first working models appeared in England in the early 20th century. Modeling in S scale increased in the 1930s and 1940s when CD Models marketed -inch model trains.

American Flyer was a manufacturer of standard gauge and O gauge &quot;tinplate&quot; trains, based in Chicago, Illinois. It never produced S scale trains as an independent company. Chicago Flyer was purchased by A.C. Gilbert Co. in the late 1930s. Gilbert began manufacturing S scale trains around 1939 that ran on three rail &quot;O&quot; gauge track. This was known as -inch O gauge. Gilbert stopped producing trains during WWII. When the war ended, Gilbert began producing true S scale S gauge trains in 1946 under the American Flyer mark.

The term &quot;S scale&quot; was adopted by the National Model Railroading Association (NMRA) in 1943 to represent that scale that was half of 1 gauge which was built to 1:32 scale. A.C. Gilbert&#x27;s improvements in 1:64 modeling and promotions of S gauge largely shaped the world of 1:64 modeling today.

As early as 1948, an industrially produced narrow-gauge railway on tracks with a model gauge of 16.5 mm was available from the French company &quot;Allard&quot;. The vehicles in the scale of 1:60 to be assigned to today&#x27;s &quot;Sm gauge&quot; ran with direct current on commercially available H0 gauge centre conductor tracks from the same manufacturer or from competitors, which also has a model gauge of 16.5 mm and centre conductor. The traction units, a steam locomotive and a rail bus (autorail), were also available with a clockwork drive.

S gauge entered what many consider its heyday in the 1950s (although there is more available in S scale today than was available during this period). However, during that period, Lionel outsold American Flyer nearly two-to-one. American Flyer&#x27;s parent company went out of business and the brand was sold to a holding company that also owned Lionel in 1967.

Lionel re-introduced S gauge trains and accessories under the American Flyer name in 1979. Another S manufacturer, American Models, entered the marketplace in 1981 and is now also one of the major S suppliers. S-Helper Service, another major S gauge manufacturer of locomotives, rolling stock, track and other products, began operations in 1989 and delivered their first S products in 1990. In 2013, S-Helper Service was sold to MTH Electric Trains. And while the S scale market has seen a number of brass model manufacturers, today the major brass model supplier in S scale and S gauge is River Raisin Models. Today&#x27;s S gauge and S scale modelers have a greater selection and higher quality products, from a wide range of manufacturers, than at any time in the past. In addition to the basics of locomotives, rolling stock, and track, various manufacturers now offer S scale structures, detail parts, figures, other scenic items, bridges, and more.

==Terminology==
The terms &quot;scale&quot; and &quot;gauge&quot; are often confused. Strictly speaking, &quot;scale&quot; is the ratio of the size of a model to that of its prototype and &quot;gauge&quot; is the distance between the track railheads. In the case of S scale, the proportion is 1:64 or inch modeling 1 foot. Standard S gauge track has a spacing of . Three-foot gauge in S scale (Sn3 gauge) is .

==Narrow gauge==
*Sn3½ or Sn42 gauge - gauge on gauge track (the same as HO gauge)
*Sm – 1 m gauge on 16.5 mm; Continental European.
*Sn3 - gauge on gauge track.
*Sn2 gauge - gauge by the majority on , the same as HOn3 gauge track, or , the same as N gauge track)

==Associations==
The S scale SIG is an NMRA-affiliated special interest group dedicated to promoting and providing information on scale model railroading at 1:64. The National Association of S Gaugers serves as an organization to promote all forms of S gauge model railroading. The S Scale Model Railway Society also works to promote the scale in the UK.

==Notable layouts==
The largest S scale layout in the United States is the Cincinnati in Motion exhibit at the Cincinnati Museum Center at Union Terminal. A large Sn3.5 or Sn42 scale layout of Swan View belongs to the Australian Model Railway Association in Bayswater, Western Australia

<text>Richard Paul Ashcroft (born 11 September 1971) is an English musician, singer, and songwriter. He formed the alternative rock band the Verve in 1989 and served as the lead singer and rhythm guitarist throughout the band&#x27;s lifetime. Ashcroft was the sole songwriter of the group. In 1997, The Verve released the UK number one album &quot;Urban Hymns&quot;, that in present day is the 18th most sold album in the UK. In 1998, Ashcroft was awarded the Ivor Novello award for Songwriter of the Year. Following The Verve&#x27;s disbandment in 1999, Ashcroft embarked on a successful solo career, releasing six UK top-three solo albums, including &quot;Alone with Everybody&quot;, &quot;Keys to the World&quot; and &quot;These People&quot;. 

The Verve reformed in 2007 and released another UK number one album &quot;Forth&quot; and disbanded once again in summer 2009. Ashcroft then released a new album in 2010 under the pseudonym band RPA &amp; The United Nations of Sound. His fourth solo album, &quot;These People&quot;, was released in 2016. Followed by the album &quot;Natural Rebel&quot; in 2018.

In May 2019, Ashcroft received a second Ivor Novello Award for Outstanding Contribution to British Music from the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers, and Authors. He released the compilation of acoustic versions of his best hits, &quot;Acoustic Hymns Vol. 1&quot;, in 2021.

Venerated by his peers, Noel Gallagher of Oasis has described Ashcroft as a &quot;genius&quot;, and Chris Martin of Coldplay has described Ashcroft as &quot;the best singer in the world&quot;.

==Early life==
Ashcroft is the eldest child of office worker Frank and hairdresser Louise Ashcroft (née Baxter); he has two younger sisters. In his childhood, Ashcroft was known to be very shy, getting to the point that he had to be replaced in a school nativity play because of on-stage fright; however, he was also known for wanting to make his classmates laugh.

He was adamant about recording songs from the radio, an alternative to the five album music collection his mother could afford. The first record Ashcroft bought was &quot;Just Like Starting Over&quot;, and following the event of John Lennon&#x27;s death in 1980, he played the song &quot;Imagine&quot; on a loop. 

In 1982, when Ashcroft was 11, his father died suddenly of a brain haemorrhage. To deal with the tragedy, he used music as a refuge; he recalls &quot;questioning&quot; the nature of life while other children occupied themselves with age-appropriate activities, thinking at the time &quot;You&#x27;re not supposed to feel this bad as a kid&quot;. 

Ashcroft attended Up Holland High School in West Lancashire, along with future bandmates Simon Jones, Peter Salisbury and Simon Tong. He then enrolled in Theatre Studies, English Literature, and Philosophy and Religion at Winstanley College, his teacher remembers him as &quot;incredibly intelligent&quot; but being too dedicated to music to care about his grades. It is here that he also met future bandmate Nick McCabe.

Ashcroft was an avid football player, he is listed in the 1998 Playfair Football Who&#x27;s Who as having been on the books of Rotherham United playing junior football for Wigan Athletic. For some time, Ashcroft wanted to be a professional football player, idolising George Best, but as he grew older he lost interest in this, turning to music instead.

==The Verve==

Ashcroft formed the Verve in 1990 with Simon Jones and Pete Salisbury. When attending Winstanley College, he heard Nick McCabe playing guitar. Without knowing his physical appearance, he waited outside the cubicle to ask whoever was behind the sound to join his band. The band went through several name changes such as Raingarden until it finally settled on Verve. Their recording of the first album, &quot;A Storm in Heaven&quot;, consisted mainly of jam sessions with improvised lyrics, upon which Ashcroft then took and edited the usable parts and structured them into songs. Ashcroft has said that the band was under the influence of LSD when they recorded the album.

The band signed to Hut Records during which time Ashcroft gained the sobriquet &quot;Mad Richard&quot;. They also became a part of the Britpop movement. The band split in 1995, and around this time Ashcroft wrote a collection of songs he intended to release as his first solo album. However, by 1997 he had changed his mind and asked McCabe to return (alongside new member Tong), reforming the Verve and releasing the very successful album &quot;Urban Hymns&quot;. Ashcroft was at the forefront of the band&#x27;s popularity, receiving an Ivor Novello Award for his songwriting and being referred to by the press as &quot;the unmistakable face of the Number One rock band in England&quot;. However, the pressures of touring and the tensions within the band led to McCabe&#x27;s departure in mid-1998 and the announcement of the band&#x27;s break-up in April 1999.

In early 2007, Ashcroft made peace with McCabe and Jones and the Verve&#x27;s reunion was announced in June. The band played gigs later that year and continued touring in 2008, headlining at several festivals around the world. A new album, &quot;Forth&quot;, was released in August.

In August 2009, the Verve broke up for the third time, as McCabe&#x27;s drinking problem generated tensions within the group.

==Solo career==
===&quot;Alone with Everybody&quot; and &quot;Human Conditions&quot;: 2000–2004===
Ashcroft&#x27;s first solo single, &quot;A Song for the Lovers&quot;, peaked at No. 3 in the UK chart in April 2000. It was followed by the single &quot;Money to Burn&quot; which reached the UK Top 20 at No. 17. The album, &quot;Alone with Everybody&quot;, was released in June, reaching number 1 and receiving platinum status in the UK. Album reviews were generally positive. In September, a third single was released – &quot;C&#x27;mon People (We&#x27;re Making It Now)&quot; – entering the charts at No. 21. Richard does not publish the lyrics to his songs in the inlay cards of his albums or singles as he feels they are personal to him.

Ashcroft began work on his second album &quot;Human Conditions&quot; in 2002. The lead single, &quot;Check the Meaning&quot;, was released in early October, and peaked at No. 11 on the UK Singles Chart. The album was released later that month and reached No. 3 in the UK Album Chart. Reception to the album was generally positive. Review aggregating website Metacritic reports a normalised score of 61% based on 15 reviews. In response to negative reaction to the album, Coldplay&#x27;s Chris Martin – a fan of both Ashcroft and the Verve – defended the album&#x27;s merits which &quot;made an impression&quot; on Ashcroft. The appreciation shown would later result in a support slot for Ashcroft, serving as the opening act for Coldplay during a European tour. The album&#x27;s second single, &quot;Science of Silence&quot;, was released the following January and charted at No. 14 in the UK. On 26 March, Ashcroft made his first live appearance of 2003 at London&#x27;s Royal Albert Hall as part of the third annual Teenage Cancer Trust charity fundraising event, before &quot;Buy It in Bottles&quot;, the third and final single to be taken from the album, was released on 7 April, charting at No. 26.

Aside from a limited number of appearances in 2003, Ashcroft was absent from the music business for about two years. He later explained this in 2006, stating that &quot;[e]veryone got it into their heads over the last few years that I was in my ivory tower like Lennon, baking bread all day. The fact of the matter was that I was bringing up kids&quot;.

===Live 8 and &quot;Keys to the World&quot;: 2005–2007===
Ashcroft began playing gigs again in mid-2005, and, on 2 July at the Live 8 concert in Hyde Park, Coldplay invited him to perform with them during their set. They performed the Verve&#x27;s hit &quot;Bitter Sweet Symphony&quot;, after having previously rehearsed the song in Crystal Palace. Ashcroft&#x27;s performance of the song was introduced by Chris Martin as &quot;probably the best song ever written, and here&#x27;s the best singer in the world&quot;, helping to create renewed interest in Ashcroft. At Christmas 2005, a documentary entitled &quot;Live 8: A Bitter Sweet Symphony&quot; was aired on the BBC reliving moments of the day featuring a portion of Ashcroft&#x27;s performance as the show&#x27;s opening soundtrack.

After the disintegration of Hut Records in 2004, Ashcroft signed to Parlophone where he released his third solo album, &quot;Keys to the World&quot;, on 23 January 2006. The first single from the album, &quot;Break the Night with Colour&quot;, was released on 9 January 2006, and entered the UK Singles Chart at number 3. Following his performance at Live 8, Ashcroft was booked as a support act for Coldplay&#x27;s Twisted Logic Tour throughout North America and the UK, which started on 14 March in Ottawa, Canada. Ashcroft saw the support slot as &quot;a good chance to play to a significant amount of people and say, &#x27;I’m back. And this is what I do&#x27;&quot;.

The album&#x27;s second single, &quot;Music Is Power&quot;, charted at number 20. On 18 April 2006, he recorded the &quot;Live from London EP&quot;, the ninth in a series of EPs released exclusively as digital downloads from Apple&#x27;s iTunes Store. The EP was released just 6 days later on 24 April. With the release of &quot;Keys to the World&quot;, the general consensus was that Ashcroft was &quot;back at the top of his musical game&quot;, as he announced his largest UK tour for years for May 2006, culminating in three nights at London&#x27;s Brixton Academy. Following the tour, Ashcroft had hoped to perform two &quot;Homecoming&quot; shows at Wigan Athletic&#x27;s 25,000 seater JJB Stadium in June 2006, but was unable to do so as the proposed venue lacked the &quot;appropriate licence&quot;. As a consequence, he chose to play at Lancashire County Cricket Club in Old Trafford, in what was to be his biggest solo show to date. He was supported at the gig by acts such as Razorlight and the Feeling, while DJ Shadow joined Richard on stage during his set to perform &quot;Lonely Soul&quot;, their UNKLE collaboration from 1998&#x27;s &quot;Psyence Fiction&quot; LP. Another UK tour followed five months later, culminating in a show at Manchester&#x27;s M.E.N. Arena on 30 November. Ashcroft did not tour &quot;Keys to the World&quot; outside of Europe.

Ashcroft hinted at the possible release of a new version of his previous single &quot;C&#x27;mon People (We&#x27;re Making It Now)&quot; for the Bobby Moore Cancer Fund, which would coincide with England&#x27;s participation in the 2006 Football World Cup, but the single never materialised. Instead, his next release was &quot;Words Just Get in the Way&quot;, which charted lower than his previous single, peaking at No. 40 in the UK Singles Chart. On 4 December, the double a-side &quot;Why Not Nothing&quot; / &quot;Sweet Brother Malcolm&quot; was released on limited edition 7&quot; vinyl.&lt;ref name=&quot;Why Not Nothing? / Sweet Brother Malcolm&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===RPA &amp; the United Nations of Sound, &quot;These People&quot;, &quot;Natural Rebel&quot;: 2008–present===

Ashcroft played a solo gig on 25 August 2008 as part of the Last Days of Summer Festival in Buckingham. The Verve broke up for a third time sometime between the last rehearsals in late 2008 and the summer of 2009. It was announced in August 2009 by a band&#x27;s friend.

At that time, Ashcroft was contractually obligated to record another album for Parlophone. A b-side compilation was considered a possibility, as Ashcroft&#x27;s team asked the fans through his site about their feelings on such an album, but it&#x27;s now very unlikely. In December 2009, Ashcroft contributed the lead soundtrack song for the documentary &quot;The Journey&quot;. A video of the song was posted at Ashcroft&#x27;s site. Also, through his blog &quot;BRAIN&quot;, he stated that he would release a new album in 2010. Sources revealed he worked on a number of new songs in New York, Los Angeles and London with producer No I.D., who Ashcroft sought after because he liked his work in the Jay-Z song &quot;D.O.A. (Death of Auto-Tune)&quot; and read an interview where he states how many producers destroy records to boost sales.

In 2010, Ashcroft formed a new band called RPA &amp; The United Nations of Sound, who released a promo single, &quot;Are You Ready?&quot;, from their new album. The album &quot;United Nations of Sound&quot; (former working title &quot;Redemption&quot;) was released on Parlophone on 19 July 2010; &quot;Born Again&quot;, the first proper single from the album, was released on the same day. The full album leaked on 15 July and the NME started streaming the album the following day. The new sound seems to emulate many of Richard&#x27;s influences described over the years in interviews and seems to close a circle for his solo career. Strings, beats, rock-guitar-riffs, voice-loops, ballads and heroic-choir-anthems are the core of the album&#x27;s sound with Ashcroft&#x27;s craft for pop tunes and unique melody-making. Also found in the songs are the ever-present spiritual lyrics for Richard, although here in fuller form.

On 15 October 2010, Ashcroft released through his website a second fanclub-only track, &quot;Here We Go Again&quot;. On the same day the song &quot;Are You Ready?&quot; was released as the first official single from the new album in the United States. During the same month Ashcroft had signed with the record company Razor &amp; Tie in the United States. The radio edit of &quot;Are You Ready?&quot; is available for free on the US version of Ashcroft&#x27;s website.

The album &quot;United Nations of Sound&quot; was released across the Atlantic on 22 March 2011 under the name &quot;Richard Ashcroft&quot;. The lead single &quot;Are You Ready?&quot; was featured over the closing credits of the film &quot;The Adjustment Bureau&quot; in March 2011, along with the new song &quot;Future&#x27;s Bright&quot;, written and performed specifically for the film&#x27;s opening by Ashcroft and ten-time Oscar-nominated composer Thomas Newman.

For the US release of &quot;Are You Ready?&quot;, Ashcroft and Big Life Management commissioned Giorgio Testi for the promo – created out of live footage from a show at Shepherd&#x27;s Bush Empire. The video premiered on 7 February on the official website of Pulse Films, the production company.

On 1 March the song &quot;Future&#x27;s Bright&quot; was premiered on Stereogum. On the official website of the movie &quot;The Adjustment Bureau&quot; there is also a video created for the song by director George Nolfi.

After six years&#x27; absence, Ashcroft released his comeback fifth studio album, &quot;These People&quot;, in May 2016. The album received largely positive reviews from music critics. The album was followed by 2016 UK and Europe tour, an abbreviated North American tour, and—for the first time in Ashcroft&#x27;s career—festival dates in Latin America.

In January 2018, it was confirmed that in June 2018, Ashcroft would be supporting Liam Gallagher at his two concerts in Malahide Castle and Gardens in Dublin and Belsonic at Ormeau Park in Belfast. In March 2018, it was announced that Ashcroft would tour with Gallagher in North America in May 2018. On 11 June 2018, it was announced that Ashcroft would support Gallagher at his show at Lancashire County Cricket Club on 18 August 2018.

In August 2018, Ashcroft announced his sixth solo album, &quot;Natural Rebel&quot;, which was released on 19 October, preceded by the single &quot;Surprised By The Joy&quot; in September and subsequent teasers &quot;Born To Be Strangers&quot; and &quot;That&#x27;s When I Feel It.&quot; The LP debuted at No. 4 on the UK Albums Chart, its highest position.

On 19 February 2021, he released a cover of John Lennon&#x27;s &quot;Bring On the Lucie (Freda Peeple)&quot; (track 5 on Lennon&#x27;s 1973 album &quot;Mind Games&quot;). On 29 October that year, he released his sixth album, &quot;Acoustic Hymns Vol. 1&quot;. It features acoustic versions of Ashcroft&#x27;s songs with The Verve and his solo career. The album debuted at No. 2 on the UK Albums Chart, its peak position.

==Personal life==
Ashcroft is married to Kate Radley, a former keyboardist of Spiritualized. They married in 1995 and it was years before it was publicly revealed that the pair had married. Together, they have two sons. The family lives in Taynton in Gloucestershire and Richmond in London. Ashcroft and Radley have collaborated professionally throughout their marriage and toured together with the band Coldplay in 2006.

Ashcroft is a Manchester United fan, and regularly attends matches.

He is good friends with the band Oasis&#x27;s Noel Gallagher, Liam Gallagher and Coldplay&#x27;s Chris Martin. For a long time the Gallagher brothers have expressed great respect for Ashcroft, with Noel Gallagher fondly nicknaming Ashcroft &#x27;Captain Rock&#x27;. The Oasis track &quot;Cast No Shadow&quot;, from the successful 1995 album &quot;(What&#x27;s the Story) Morning Glory?&quot; is dedicated to him, possibly as a response to Ashcroft having dedicated the title track of &quot;A Northern Soul&quot; to Noel Gallagher. Ashcroft also provided backing vocals on the Oasis song &quot;All Around the World&quot; in 1997, for Oasis&#x27; &quot;Be Here Now&quot;.

In a 2006 interview, Ashcroft mentioned taking Prozac to help him with clinical depression, but said that it did not help, referring to the pills as &quot;very, very synthetic.&quot; Ashcroft has said that he&#x27;s always been &quot;a depressive, someone who suffers from depression&quot;, and that music and creativity help him cope with his illness.

In July 2021, Ashcroft pulled out of the headline slot at Sheffield&#x27;s Tramlines Festival after it became part of the UK government&#x27;s pilot events programme.

==Songwriting style and artistic influences==
Ashcroft has a sustained interest for the psychological and affectual influence music holds, stating, &quot;A great pop song is as powerful as the best piece of poetry you have ever read and the melody can take you to another place.&quot;

Ashcroft is well known for using string instrumentation in his songs. He considers it part of his &quot;palette&quot; and draws inspiration from such composers as Ennio Morricone, John Barry, and John Williams.

A major influence on Ashcroft from childhood to adulthood has been The Beatles. Ashcroft recalls two out of the three LPs his family owned when he was a child were the 1966 album &quot;Revolver&quot;, and the Beatles compilation album &quot;1967–1970&quot;. He also recalls in his teens he used to watch an &quot;unauthorised&quot; video of the band on a loop. He has expressed a high regard for George Harrison&#x27;s work within the Beatles and solo work, as well as praise for his moral ideals and distaste for the fake nature of the music industry.

Ashcroft has listed The Smiths as a major influence in his teens, listing the album &quot;Hatful of Hollow&quot; and the song &#x27;How Soon is Now&#x27; as having a profound impact on him.

Ashcroft also holds a deep interest for Cinema, when he was thirteen years of age, he was shown the Jean-Luc Godard film &quot;1+1&quot;, which showed the Rolling Stones creating a song. Ashcroft mentions this event as a turning point in his life view.

In terms of literature, Ashcroft has been vastly influenced by the poet/polymath William Blake. He has also mentioned poet Phillip Larkin and A.E. Housman as some of his favorite poets.

==&quot;Bittersweet Symphony&quot; legal dispute==
A legal dispute was held over Ashcroft&#x27;s song, &quot;Bitter Sweet Symphony&quot;, on which Ashcroft was the sole band member to share a co-writing credit. The song uses a sample of Andrew Oldham Orchestra&#x27;s recording of The Rolling Stones&#x27; 1965 song &quot;The Last Time&quot;. The Verve had negotiated this legally; however, the Rolling Stones&#x27; record company successfully sued and argued that they had used &quot;too much.&quot; The Verve was subsequently forced to give ABKCO 100 percent of the royalties from &quot;Bitter Sweet Symphony&quot;, and Mick Jagger and Keith Richards were given songwriting credits along with Ashcroft. Against Ashcroft&#x27;s wishes, the song was used in a commercial advertisement, from this he received $175,000, but donated it all to charity despite it being the only revenue he had ever received from the song. On 23 May 2019, Ashcroft announced that Jagger and Richards had signed over the rights to him, giving him sole writing credit and all subsequent royalties.

<text>Scarlett Noel Pomers (born November 28, 1988) is an American actress and former singer. Her most recognizable roles are Naomi Wildman on &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot; (1998–2001) and Kyra Hart on the television series &quot;Reba&quot; (2001–2007). Her debut EP, titled &quot;Insane&quot;, was released January 7, 2010.

==Early life==
Scarlett Noel Pomers was a fan of hard rock from an early age. She began taking singing and guitar lessons as a child.

==Career==
===Acting===
Scarlett Pomers made her acting debut at the age of three in Michael Jackson&#x27;s music video, &quot;Heal the World&quot; (1992). She then began doing commercials and has filmed over three dozen to date. She has also starred in a number of television shows, including &quot;Judging Amy&quot;, &quot;That&#x27;s Life&quot;, and &quot;Touched by an Angel&quot;.

Pomers was five years old when she made her debut on the silver screen in &quot;The Baby-Sitters Club&quot;. She also appeared in &quot;Slappy and the Stinkers&quot;, &quot;Happy, Texas&quot;, &quot;Erin Brockovich&quot;, and TV-movie &quot;Geppetto&quot; as well as appearing on the Disney Channel film, &quot;A Ring of Endless Light&quot;.

Pomers&#x27; first major role started in 1998 as Naomi Wildman on the UPN sci-fi program &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot;. She appeared in 17 episodes over three years and won a Young Artist Award for Best Performance in a Drama Series: Supporting Young Actress. Next she joined the cast of the WB series &quot;Reba&quot;, playing Kyra Hart, the middle child of the titular character. Pomers stayed with the show until it ended in 2007.

Pomers has also appeared as a judge for PAX TV&#x27;s 2004–05 series &quot;America&#x27;s Most Talented Kids&quot;.

In 2014 Pomers said that she was &quot;pretty much [done]&quot; with acting except for some voiceover work, and was making a career in photography and jewelry design.

===Music===
In an interview with Modern Guitars Magazine, Pomers talked about how she and her band got together. &quot;I&#x27;ve been singing since I was about six-years-old and I was supposed to finish an album last year when I was on hiatus from &quot;Reba&quot;, but I dislocated my kneecap for the third time and had to have surgery to keep it from happening again. During my four month recovery, I was pretty unhappy that I couldn&#x27;t finish working with the writers and producers I was scheduled to do the album with. So by the fourth month I was getting around in my brace and making progress in my physical therapy and my mom said I could put a band together and rehearse sitting down until the brace came off. By that time &quot;maybe&quot; we could do a show.

What I didn&#x27;t know was how much fun it would be and now it has become the most amazing experience I&#x27;ve ever had! All of my guys love classic rock and they are really talented and fun to work with.&quot;

As a singer, Pomers founded the band SCARLETT, sometimes known as the &quot;Scarlett Pomers Band,&quot; which played at venues including the Knitting Factory, House of Blues, Club One-Seven, The Roxy, and the Whisky a Go Go. Her debut EP, &quot;Insane&quot;, was released on January 7, 2010, through her official website, CDbaby.com, and iTunes. The album consists of five tracks.

Pomers covered an AC/DC classic, &quot;It&#x27;s a Long Way to the Top (If You Wanna Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll)&quot;, in a tribute album to the band titled &quot;Rock &amp; Roll Train: A Millennium Tribute To AC/DC&quot;. It was released December 10, 2010 on iTunes.

In 2014 Pomers indicated that she was still involved in music, &quot;but I do it mostly for myself and not for money, not for a living. There’s no money in it anyway.&quot; Her musical projects at the time included industrial metal and writing songs for the mandolin, which she had learnt to play.

==Personal life==
In late 2005, Pomers checked into an anorexia nervosa treatment facility. The actress&#x27; weight had dropped to and she was exercising as much as six hours per day. Scarlett&#x27;s character, Kyra, was absent from most of the fifth season of &quot;Reba&quot;, having only appeared in two episodes out of twenty two. She was out of the facility by January 2006, became an ambassador for the National Eating Disorders Association, and began an organization called Arch-Angels which raises money for people who suffer from eating disorders, but cannot afford treatment. Her efforts led &quot;Teen People&quot; magazine to name her one of the 20 teens who will change the world.

Pomers returned to the set of &quot;Reba&quot; and appeared in season six until the show ended in 2007. Pomers, who is a vegetarian, began practicing Kundalini yoga in June 2006 after reading a book about Golden Bridge studio director Gurmukh Kaur Khalsa, and earned her teaching certificate in the practice. &quot;Yoga always made me feel really good about myself. It was the final step of letting go of the demon.&quot;

<doc id="455147" wikidata="Q835872" url="?curid=455147" title="Socket 370">
<text>Socket 370, also known as PGA370, is a CPU socket first used by Intel for Pentium III and Celeron processors to first complement and later replace the older Slot 1 CPU interface on personal computers. The &quot;370&quot; refers to the number of pin holes in the socket for CPU pins.

Socket 370 was replaced by Socket 423 in 2000.

==Overview==

Socket 370 started out as a budget-oriented platform for 66 MHz FSB PPGA Mendocino Celeron CPUs in late 1998, as the move to on-die L2 cache eliminated the need for a PCB design as seen on Slot 1.

Socket 370 then became Intel&#x27;s main desktop socket from late 1999 to late 2000 for 100/133 MHz FSB FC-PGA Coppermine Pentium IIIs. In 2001, the FC-PGA2 Tualatin Pentium III processors brought changes to the infrastructure which required dedicated Tualatin-compatible motherboards; some manufacturers would indicate this with a blue (instead of white) socket. These late sockets were typically compatible with Coppermine processors, but not the older Mendocino Celerons.

Some motherboards that used Socket 370 support Intel processors in dual CPU configurations (e. g. ABIT BP6). Other motherboards allowed the use of a Socket 370 or a Slot 1 CPU, but not at the same time.

The VIA Cyrix III, later renamed the VIA C3, also used Socket 370.

Slotkets are available that allows Socket 370 CPUs to be used on Slot 1 based motherboards. These devices are equipped with their own voltage regulator modules, in order to supply the new CPU with a lower core voltage, which the motherboard would not otherwise allow.

==Socket 370 Intel processors mechanical load limits==
The weight of a Socket 370 CPU cooler should not exceed 180 grams (6.3 ounces). Heavier coolers may result in damage to the die when the system is improperly handled.

Most Intel Socket 370 processors (Pentium III and Celeron) had mechanical maximum load limits which were designed not be exceeded during heat sink assembly, shipping conditions, or standard use. They came with a warning that load above those limits would crack the processor die and make it unusable. The limits are included in the table below.
==Socket 370 Intel processors with integrated heat sink mechanical load limits==
All Intel Socket 370 processors with integrated heat sink (Pentium III and Celeron 1.13–1.4 GHz) had mechanical maximum load limits which were designed not be exceeded during heat sink assembly, shipping conditions, or standard use. They came with a warning that load above those limits would crack the processor die and make it unusable. The limits are included in the table below.

<doc id="455149" wikidata="Q1390504" url="?curid=455149" title="Steve Purcell">
<text>Steven Ross Purcell (born July 30, 1961) is an American cartoonist, animator, game designer and voice actor. He is the creator of the media franchise &quot;Sam &amp; Max&quot;, for which Purcell received an Eisner Award in 2007. The series has grown to incorporate an animated television series and several video games.

A graduate of the California College of Arts and Craft, Purcell began his career creating comic strips for the college newsletter. He performed freelance work for Marvel Comics and Fishwrap Productions before publishing his first &quot;Sam &amp; Max&quot; comic in 1987. Purcell was hired by LucasArts as an artist and animator in 1988 and worked on several LucasArts adventure games, including the first two &quot;Monkey Island&quot; games, &quot;Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade&quot; and &quot;Sam &amp; Max Hit the Road.&quot;

Purcell collaborated with Nelvana to create a &quot;Sam &amp; Max&quot; television series in 1997, and briefly worked as an animator for Industrial Light &amp; Magic after leaving LucasArts.

At Pixar, he co-wrote and co-directed the 2012 film &quot;Brave&quot; and developed a miniseries for the &quot;Cars&quot; franchise, &quot;Cars on the Road&quot;.

==Career==

===Early career===
Purcell entered into a career with comic books while an undergraduate at the California College of the Arts in 1980; he produced comic strips for the weekly newsletter. These strips featured Sam and Max, an anthropomorphic dog and rabbit duo who work as vigilantes and private investigators; Purcell drew the first strip the night before the deadline. Following his graduation in 1982, Purcell became involved in freelance illustration, working briefly for Marvel Comics, Chaosium, and on Steven Moncuse&#x27;s &quot;Fish Police&quot; series. Moncuse approached Purcell about the possibility of another comic book series to accompany his well-performing &quot;Fish Police&quot; series in 1987. Purcell agreed, and wrote his first feature-length comic using the characters of Sam and Max. The 32-page comic was published by Fishwrap Productions in 1987. The comic contained two &quot;Sam &amp; Max&quot; stories: &quot;Monkeys Violating the Heavenly Temple&quot;, a name that Purcell found on a firework and thought was appropriate; and &quot;Night of the Gilded Heron-Shark&quot;. Purcell published a further story in a 1987 issue of &quot;Critters&quot; titled &quot;Night of the Cringing Wildebeest&quot;. These three stories established the basics for Purcell&#x27;s future work with the characters.

===LucasArts===
Purcell was hired by LucasArts, then known as Lucasfilm Games, as an animator in 1988, but was subsequently laid off when the project he was working on was canceled. He was rehired to produce art for the graphic adventure game &quot;Zak McKracken and the Alien Mindbenders&quot;. Purcell was later commissioned to create the cover artwork for &quot;Maniac Mansion&quot; and the first two &quot;Monkey Island&quot; games and researched into whips for the adventure game version of &quot;Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade&quot;. He worked with animation in several LucasArts adventure games, published three more &quot;Sam &amp; Max&quot; comic books during this time, and began creating brief comic strips for LucasArts&#x27; quarterly newsletter, &quot;The Adventurer&quot;. The characters eventually became involved as training material for LucasArts programmers working with SCUMM, the core game engine used by LucasArts adventure games; Purcell created versions of Sam and Max in their office for new programmers under Ron Gilbert to practice on. References to the characters were occasionally made in unrelated LucasArts adventure games as a clandestine appearance in backgrounds. Purcell wrote the six-issue comic book series &quot;Defenders of Dynatron City&quot; for Marvel Comics in 1992.

After a positive reaction to the &quot;Sam &amp; Max&quot; strips in &quot;The Adventurer&quot; and wanting to expand into other franchises following &quot;Maniac Mansion&quot; and &quot;Monkey Island&quot;, LucasArts offered to create a graphic adventure game on the characters in 1992. &quot;Sam &amp; Max Hit the Road&quot; was conceived and developed by a small team headed by Purcell, Sean Clark, Michael Stemmle and Collette Michaud. Purcell decided to base the game on one of his earlier &quot;Sam &amp; Max&quot; stories, the 1988 story &quot;On The Road&quot;. In 1995, Purcell combined all published &quot;Sam &amp; Max&quot; printed media into a 154-page paperback compilation titled &quot;Sam &amp; Max: Surfin&#x27; the Highway&quot;. After producing the cover art for &quot;Herc&#x27;s Adventures&quot; and concept art for &quot;The Curse of Monkey Island&quot;, Purcell left LucasArts.

===Later work===
Purcell joined with story editor Dan Smith from Canadian studio Nelvana to create an animated television series of &quot;Sam &amp; Max&quot; in 1996. The result was the 1997 series &quot;The Adventures of Sam &amp; Max: Freelance Police&quot;, broadcast on Fox Kids in the United States, YTV in Canada and Channel 4 in the United Kingdom. Purcell wrote the jokes for each installment of the 24-episode series, and wrote the scripts for four episodes. Despite the violence and profanity common in the &quot;Sam &amp; Max&quot; franchise having been toned down due to the target audience of children, Purcell was content that the characters maintained their moral ambiguity. Some parent groups in the United States attempted to have the series pulled from networks due to content issues; Purcell was pleased that they &quot;had managed to ruffle some feathers along the way&quot;. Two &quot;Sam &amp; Max&quot; comic strips appeared in Fox&#x27;s &quot;Totally Fox Kids Magazine&quot; in 1998 to accompany the series; other &quot;Sam &amp; Max&quot; strips appeared in &quot;Wizard&quot; and &quot;Oni Double Feature&quot;. During the development of the television series in 1997, Purcell co-authored and illustrated the &quot;Hellboy Christmas Special&quot; with Mike Mignola and Gary Gianni. After the conclusion of the &quot;Sam &amp; Max&quot; animated series, Purcell was briefly employed by Industrial Light &amp; Magic to work on digital effects for a film version of &quot;Frankenstein&quot;. Despite his work, the project was canceled; Purcell believes that some of the development work morphed into ILM&#x27;s contributions to &quot;Van Helsing&quot;. While at ILM, Purcell was involved in a project to create an animated film based on &quot;Monkey Island&quot;; while the project did not reach fruition, Purcell began posting concept art he had produced for the film on his personal blog several years after.

===Pixar and Telltale Games===
After the brief stint at ILM, Purcell moved to Pixar. Despite being employed by Pixar, Purcell acted as an advisor in the development of &quot;Sam &amp; Max: Freelance Police&quot;, a sequel to &quot;Sam &amp; Max Hit the Road&quot; that began development in 2002 under LucasArts. Purcell provided Michael Stemmle&#x27;s development team with concept art and assisted in the creation of the game&#x27;s plot. Despite its smoothly proceeding development, LucasArts abruptly canceled the project in March 2004. Purcell was unable to understand why development halted; he described himself as &quot;frustrated and disappointed&quot; at the decision.

In 2005, LucasArts&#x27; license with Purcell that gave them the right to produce games based on the &quot;Sam &amp; Max&quot; franchise expired; this allowed Purcell to take the franchise to Telltale Games, a new company formed by members of Stemmle&#x27;s development team. A new episodic series of &quot;Sam &amp; Max&quot; games, &quot;Sam &amp; Max Save the World&quot;, was announced. Purcell&#x27;s work on the new game series encompassed design and writing, as well as the design of the game&#x27;s cover art; despite his work, Purcell described it as &quot;minimal&quot; due to the effectiveness of the team. At the same time, Purcell began a &quot;Sam &amp; Max&quot; webcomic hosted on the Telltale Games website. The webcomic ran for twelve issues, and it earned Purcell an Eisner Award for &quot;Best Digital Comic&quot; when the comic finished its run in 2007. Purcell assisted with design and writing when &quot;Sam &amp; Max Beyond Time and Space&quot; began development in 2007. Through Telltale Games, he released two sketchbooks of his &quot;Sam &amp; Max&quot; work and a 20th anniversary edition of &quot;Sam &amp; Max: Surfin&#x27; the Highway&quot; in 2008. Purcell later painted the cover art for Telltale&#x27;s &quot;Tales of Monkey Island&quot;.

At Pixar&#x27;s story development department, Purcell contributed screenplay material and voice work for the 2006 film &quot;Cars&quot;, and designed the character of the Screamin&#x27; Banshee in the short &quot;Mater and the Ghostlight&quot;. Providing scripts and voice work for three games based on &quot;Cars&quot;, Purcell became involved with THQ&#x27;s video game adaptations of Pixar films. Purcell was credited for involvement with Pixar&#x27;s 2007 film &quot;Ratatouille&quot;; he provided the voice for the character of Carl in &quot;George &amp; A.J.&quot;—a 2009 short based on the film &quot;Up&quot;. Purcell was key for Pixar&#x27;s 2012 film &quot;Brave&quot;, co-directing the film alongside Brenda Chapman and Mark Andrews in addition to providing work for the screenplay; &quot;Brave&quot; constituted Purcell&#x27;s biggest role in a Pixar project to date.

In 2014, Purcell wrote and directed the Pixar Christmas special &quot;Toy Story That Time Forgot&quot; which aired on ABC on December 2, 2014. Purcell was not considering the possibility of Pixar adapting &quot;Sam &amp; Max&quot; into a film, as the characters&#x27; moral ambiguity is inconsistent with traditional Pixar stories. In 2023, Purcell was among 75 Pixar employees laid off by The Walt Disney Company as part of an ongoing company-wide restructuring.

==Personal life==
Purcell grew up in California, where he still resides. In a 2000 interview, Purcell said that he had been drawing all his life, and that he still possesses drawings from when he was three years old. Noting that his line of creative work depends entirely on things one learns, Purcell describes himself as an &quot;average&quot; student at school, but wishing that he had tried harder at some classes. After studying film-making courses at junior college, Purcell enrolled in the California College of the Arts to read fine art; he now holds a bachelor&#x27;s degree there. Purcell befriended Mike Mignola, and later Art Adams while at the college. Citing the Marx Brothers, Peter Sellers and Monty Python as among his interests, he says that he is inspired by &quot;creative people who have made their seemingly most self-indulgent artistic whims into a career&quot;. During the development of &quot;Sam &amp; Max Hit the Road&quot; in 1993, Purcell married fellow lead designer Collette Michaud; the wedding cake was topped with figurines of Sam and Max as a bride and groom. Purcell has two sons.

The characters of Sam and Max were created in Purcell&#x27;s youth; Purcell&#x27;s younger brother Dave originally came up with several comics around the idea of a dog and rabbit detective duo. Dave would often leave unfinished comics around the house. Deliberately making the characters mix up each other&#x27;s names, shoot at each other and mock the way in which they had been drawn, Steve, in a case of sibling rivalry, would sometimes finish the stories in parodies of their original form. This developed from Steve mocking his brother&#x27;s to the creation of his own stories with the characters. In the late 1970s, Dave Purcell gave Steve the rights to the characters; he signed them over in a contract on Steve&#x27;s birthday and allowed him to develop the characters in his own way. Purcell believes that his younger brother has recovered and forgiven him from their earlier years. Having kept one as a pet in his youth, Purcell has an interest in rats, which are commonly featured in his artistic work.

<doc id="455150" wikidata="Q2910703" url="?curid=455150" title="Causes of the Great Depression">
<text>The causes of the Great Depression in the early 20th century in the United States have been extensively discussed by economists and remain a matter of active debate. They are part of the larger debate about economic crises and recessions. The specific economic events that took place during the Great Depression are well established. 

There was an initial stock market crash that triggered a &quot;panic sell-off&quot; of assets. This was followed by a deflation in asset and commodity prices, dramatic drops in demand and the total quantity of money in the economy, and disruption of trade, ultimately resulting in widespread unemployment (over 13 million people were unemployed by 1932) and impoverishment. However, economists and historians have not reached a consensus on the causal relationships between various events and government economic policies in causing or ameliorating the Depression.

Current mainstream theories may be broadly classified into two main points of view. The first are the demand-driven theories, from Keynesian and institutional economists who argue that the depression was caused by a widespread loss of confidence that led to drastically lower investment and persistent underconsumption. The demand-driven theories argue that the financial crisis following the 1929 crash led to a sudden and persistent reduction in consumption and investment spending, causing the depression that followed. Once panic and deflation set in, many people believed they could avoid further losses by keeping clear of the markets. Holding money therefore became profitable as prices dropped lower and a given amount of money bought ever more goods, exacerbating the drop in demand. 

Second, there are the monetarists, who believe that the Great Depression started as an ordinary recession, but that significant policy mistakes by monetary authorities (especially the Federal Reserve) caused a shrinking of the money supply which greatly exacerbated the economic situation, causing a recession to descend into the Great Depression. Related to this explanation are those who point to debt deflation causing those who borrow to owe ever more in real terms.

There are also several various heterodox theories that reject the explanations of the Keynesians and monetarists. Some new classical macroeconomists have argued that various labor market policies imposed at the start caused the length and severity of the Great Depression.

==Trying to return to the Gold Standard==
:See also: Financial crisis of 1914, World War I reparations, Herbert Hoover gold mining engineer
During World War I many countries suspended their gold standard in varying ways. There was high inflation from WWI, and in the 1920s in the Weimar Republic, Austria, and throughout Europe. In the late 1920s there was a scramble to deflate prices to get the gold standard&#x27;s conversion rates back on track to pre-WWI levels, by causing deflation and high unemployment through tight monetary policy. In 1933 FDR signed Executive Order 6102 and in 1934 signed the Gold Reserve Act.
==General theoretical reasoning==
The two classical competing theories of the Great Depression are the Keynesian (demand-driven) and the monetarist explanation. There are also various heterodox theories that downplay or reject the explanations of the Keynesians and monetarists.

Economists and economic historians are almost evenly split as to whether the traditional monetary explanation that monetary forces were the primary cause of the Great Depression is right, or the traditional Keynesian explanation that a fall in autonomous spending, particularly investment, is the primary explanation for the onset of the Great Depression. Today the controversy is of lesser importance since there is mainstream support for the debt deflation theory and the expectations hypothesis that building on the monetary explanation of Milton Friedman and Anna Schwartz add non-monetary explanations.

There is consensus that the Federal Reserve System should have cut short the process of monetary deflation and banking collapse. If the Federal Reserve System had done that, the economic downturn would have been far less severe and much shorter.

===Mainstream theories===

====Keynesian====

In his book &quot;The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money&quot; (1936), British economist John Maynard Keynes introduced concepts that were intended to help explain the Great Depression. He argued that there are reasons that the self-correcting mechanisms that many economists claimed should work during a downturn might not work.

One argument for a non-interventionist policy during a recession was that if consumption fell due to savings, the savings would cause the rate of interest to fall. According to the classical economists, lower interest rates would lead to increased investment spending and demand would remain constant. However, Keynes argues that there are good reasons that investment does not necessarily increase in response to a fall in the interest rate. Businesses make investments based on expectations of profit. Therefore, if a fall in consumption appears to be long-term, businesses analyzing trends will lower expectations of future sales. Therefore, the last thing they are interested in doing is investing in increasing future production, even if lower interest rates make capital inexpensive. In that case, the economy can be thrown into a general slump due to a decline in consumption. According to Keynes, this self-reinforcing dynamic is what occurred to an extreme degree during the Depression, where bankruptcies were common and investment, which requires a degree of optimism, was very unlikely to occur. This view is often characterized by economists as being in opposition to Say&#x27;s law.

The idea that reduced capital investment was a cause of the depression is a central theme in secular stagnation theory.

Keynes argued that if the national government spent more money to help the economy to recover the money normally spent by consumers and business firms, then unemployment rates would fall. The solution was for the Federal Reserve System to &quot;create new money for the national government to borrow and spend&quot; and to cut taxes rather than raising them, in order for consumers to spend more, and other beneficial factors. Hoover chose to do the opposite of what Keynes thought to be the solution and allowed the federal government to raise taxes exceedingly to reduce the budget shortage brought about by the depression. Keynes proclaimed that more workers could be employed by decreasing interest rates, encouraging firms to borrow more money and make more products. Employment would prevent the government from having to spend any more money by increasing the amount that consumers would spend. Keynes&#x27; theory was then confirmed by the length of the Great Depression within the United States and the constant unemployment rate. Employment rates began to rise in preparation for World War II by increasing government spending. &quot;In light of these developments, the Keynesian explanation of the Great Depression was increasingly accepted by economists, historians, and politicians&quot;.

====Monetarist====
In their 1963 book &quot;A Monetary History of the United States, 1867–1960&quot;, Milton Friedman and Anna Schwartz laid out their case for a different explanation of the Great Depression. Essentially, the Great Depression, in their view, was caused by the fall of the money supply. Friedman and Schwartz write: &quot;From the cyclical peak in August 1929 to a cyclical trough in March 1933, the stock of money fell by over a third.&quot; The result was what Friedman and Schwartz called &quot;The Great Contraction&quot; — a period of falling income, prices, and employment caused by the choking effects of a restricted money supply. Friedman and Schwartz argue that people wanted to hold more money than the Federal Reserve was supplying. As a result, people hoarded money by consuming less. This caused a contraction in employment and production since prices were not flexible enough to immediately fall. The Fed&#x27;s failure was in not realizing what was happening and not taking corrective action. In a speech honoring Friedman and Schwartz, Ben Bernanke stated:

&quot;Let me end my talk by abusing slightly my status as an official representative of the Federal Reserve. I would like to say to Milton and Anna: Regarding the Great Depression, you&#x27;re right. We did it. We&#x27;re very sorry. But thanks to you, we won&#x27;t do it again.&quot;
— Ben S. Bernanke

After the Depression, the primary explanations of it tended to ignore the importance of the money supply. However, in the monetarist view, the Depression was &quot;in fact a tragic testimonial to the importance of monetary forces&quot;. In their view, the failure of the Federal Reserve to deal with the Depression was not a sign that monetary policy was impotent, but that the Federal Reserve implemented the wrong policies. They did not claim the Fed &quot;caused&quot; the depression, only that it failed to use policies that might have stopped a recession from turning into a depression.

Before 
the Great Depression, the U.S. economy had already experienced a number of depressions. These depressions were often set off by banking crises, the most significant occurring in 1873, 1893, 1901, and 1907. Before the 1913 establishment of the Federal Reserve, the banking system had dealt with these crises in the U.S. (such as in the Panic of 1907) by suspending the convertibility of deposits into currency. Starting in 1893, there were growing efforts by financial institutions and business men to intervene during these crises, providing liquidity to banks that were suffering runs. During the banking panic of 1907, an ad hoc coalition assembled by J. P. Morgan successfully intervened in this way, thereby cutting off the panic, which was likely the reason why the depression that would normally have followed a banking panic did not happen this time. A call by some for a government version of this solution resulted in the establishment of the Federal Reserve.

But in 1929–32, the Federal Reserve did not act to provide liquidity to banks suffering bank runs. In fact, its policy contributed to the banking crisis by permitting a sudden contraction of the money supply. During the Roaring Twenties, the central bank had set as its primary goal &quot;price stability&quot;, in part because the governor of the New York Federal Reserve, Benjamin Strong, was a disciple of Irving Fisher, a tremendously popular economist who popularized stable prices as a monetary goal. It had kept the number of dollars at such an amount that prices of goods in society appeared stable. In 1928, Strong died, and with his death this policy ended, to be replaced with a real bills doctrine requiring that all currency or securities have material goods backing them. This policy permitted the U.S. money supply to fall by over a third from 1929 to 1933.

When this money shortage caused runs on banks, the Fed maintained its true bills policy, refusing to lend money to the banks in the way that had cut short the 1907 panic, instead allowing each to suffer a catastrophic run and fail entirely. This policy resulted in a series of bank failures in which one-third of all banks vanished. According to Ben Bernanke, the subsequent credit crunches led to waves of bankruptcies. Friedman said that if a policy similar to 1907 had been followed during the banking panic at the end of 1930, perhaps this would have stopped the vicious circle of the forced liquidation of assets at depressed prices. Consequently, the banking panics of 1931, 1932, and 1933 might not have happened, just as suspension of convertibility in 1893 and 1907 had quickly ended the liquidity crises at the time.&quot;

Monetarist explanations had been rejected in Samuelson&#x27;s work &quot;Economics&quot;, writing: &quot;Today few economists regard Federal Reserve monetary policy as a panacea for controlling the business cycle. Purely monetary factors are considered to be as much symptoms as causes, albeit symptoms with aggravating effects that should not be completely neglected.&quot; According to Keynesian economist Paul Krugman, the work of Friedman and Schwartz became dominant among mainstream economists by the 1980s but should be reconsidered in light of Japan&#x27;s Lost Decade of the 1990s. The role of monetary policy in financial crises is in active debate regarding the financial crisis of 2007–2008; see Causes of the Great Recession.

====Additional modern nonmonetary explanations====
The monetary explanation has two weaknesses. First, it is not able to explain why the demand for money was falling more rapidly than the supply during the initial downturn in 1930–31. Second, it is not able to explain why in March 1933 a recovery took place although short term interest rates remained close to zero and the money supply was still falling. These questions are addressed by modern explanations that build on the monetary explanation of Milton Friedman and Anna Schwartz but add non-monetary explanations.

=====Debt deflation=====

Total debt to GDP levels in the U.S. reached a high of just under 300 per cent by the time of the Depression. This level of debt was not exceeded again until near the end of the 20th century.

Jerome (1934) gives an unattributed quote about finance conditions that allowed the great industrial expansion of the post-W.W.I period:
Probably never before in this country had such a volume of funds been available at such low rates for such a long period.

Furthermore, Jerome says that the volume of new capital issues increased at a 7.7% compounded annual rate from 1922 to 1929 at a time when the Standard Statistics Co.&#x27;s index of 60 high grade bonds yielded from 4.98% in 1923 to 4.47% in 1927.

There was also a real estate and housing bubble in the 1920s, especially in Florida, which burst in 1925. Alvin Hansen stated that housing construction during the 1920s decade exceeded population growth by 25 per cent. See also: Florida land boom of the 1920s: Statistics kept by Cook County, Illinois show over 1 million vacant plots for homes in the Chicago area, despite only 950,000 plots being occupied, the result of Chicago&#x27;s explosive population growth in combination with a real estate bubble.

Irving Fisher argued the predominant factor leading to the Great Depression was over-indebtedness and deflation. Fisher tied loose credit to over-indebtedness, which fueled speculation and asset bubbles. He then outlined nine factors interacting with one another under conditions of debt and deflation to create the mechanics of boom to bust. The chain of events proceeded as follows:
# Debt liquidation and distress selling
# Contraction of the money supply as bank loans are paid off
# A fall in the level of asset prices
# A still greater fall in the net worths of business, precipitating bankruptcies
# A fall in profits
# A reduction in output, in trade and in employment.
# Pessimism and loss of confidence
# Hoarding of money
# A fall in nominal interest rates and a rise in deflation adjusted interest rates.

During the Wall Street crash of 1929 preceding the Great Depression, margin requirements were only 10%. Brokerage firms, in other words, would lend $90 for every $10 an investor had deposited. When the market fell, brokers called in these loans, which could not be paid back. Banks began to fail as debtors defaulted on debt and depositors attempted to withdraw their deposits en masse, triggering multiple bank runs. Government guarantees and Federal Reserve banking regulations to prevent such panics were ineffective or not used. Bank failures led to the loss of billions of dollars in assets.

Outstanding debts became heavier, because prices and incomes fell by 20–50% but the debts remained at the same dollar amount. After the panic of 1929, and during the first 10 months of 1930, 744 U.S. banks failed. (In all, 9,000 banks failed during the 1930s.) By April 1933, around $7 billion in deposits had been frozen in failed banks or those left unlicensed after the March Bank Holiday.

Bank failures snowballed as desperate bankers called in loans, which the borrowers did not have time or money to repay. With future profits looking poor, capital investment and construction slowed or completely ceased. In the face of bad loans and worsening future prospects, the surviving banks became even more conservative in their lending. Banks built up their capital reserves and made fewer loans, which intensified deflationary pressures. A vicious cycle developed and the downward spiral accelerated.

The liquidation of debt could not keep up with the fall of prices it caused. The mass effect of the stampede to liquidate increased the value of each dollar owed, relative to the value of declining asset holdings. The very effort of individuals to lessen their burden of debt effectively increased it. Paradoxically, the more the debtors paid, the more they owed. This self-aggravating process turned a 1930 recession into a 1933 depression.

Fisher&#x27;s debt-deflation theory initially lacked mainstream influence because of the counter-argument that debt-deflation represented no more than a redistribution from one group (debtors) to another (creditors). Pure re-distributions should have no significant macroeconomic effects.

Building on both the monetary hypothesis of Milton Friedman and Anna Schwartz as well as the debt deflation hypothesis of Irving Fisher, Ben Bernanke developed an alternative way in which the financial crisis affected output. He builds on Fisher&#x27;s argument that dramatic declines in the price level and nominal incomes lead to increasing real debt burdens which in turn leads to debtor insolvency and consequently leads to lowered aggregate demand, a further decline in the price level then results in a debt deflationary spiral. According to Bernanke, a small decline in the price level simply reallocates wealth from debtors to creditors without doing damage to the economy. But when the deflation is severe falling asset prices along with debtor bankruptcies lead to a decline in the nominal value of assets on bank balance sheets. Banks will react by tightening their credit conditions, that in turn leads to a credit crunch which does serious harm to the economy. A credit crunch lowers investment and consumption and results in declining aggregate demand which additionally contributes to the deflationary spiral.

Economist Steve Keen revived the debt-reset theory after he accurately predicted the 2008 recession based on his analysis of the Great Depression, and recently advised Congress to engage in debt-forgiveness or direct payments to citizens in order to avoid future financial events. Some people support the debt-reset theory.

===== Expectations hypothesis =====
Expectations have been a central element of macroeconomic models since the economic mainstream accepted the new neoclassical synthesis. While not rejecting that it was inadequate demand that sustained the depression, according to Peter Temin, Barry Wigmore, Gauti B. Eggertsson and Christina Romer the key to recovery and the end of the Great Depression was the successful management of public expectations. This thesis is based on the observation that after years of deflation and a very severe recession, important economic indicators turned positive in March 1933, just as Franklin D. Roosevelt took office. Consumer prices turned from deflation to a mild inflation, industrial production bottomed out in March 1933, investment doubled in 1933 with a turnaround in March 1933. There were no monetary forces to explain that turnaround. Money supply was still falling and short term interest rates remained close to zero. Before March 1933, people expected a further deflation and recession so that even interest rates at zero did not stimulate investment. But when Roosevelt announced major regime changes people began to expect inflation and an economic expansion. With those expectations, interest rates at zero began to stimulate investment as planned. Roosevelt&#x27;s fiscal and monetary policy regime change helped to make his policy objectives credible. The expectation of higher future income and higher future inflation stimulated demand and investments. The analysis suggests that the elimination of the policy dogmas of the gold standard, a balanced budget in times of crises and small government led to a large shift in expectation that accounts for about 70–80 percent of the recovery of output and prices from 1933 to 1937. If the regime change had not happened and the Hoover policy had continued, the economy would have continued its free fall in 1933, and output would have been 30 percent lower in 1937 than in 1933.

The recession of 1937–38, which slowed down economic recovery from the Great Depression, is explained by fears of the population that the moderate tightening of the monetary and fiscal policy in 1937 would be first steps to a restoration of the pre March 1933 policy regime.

===Heterodox theories===

====Austrian School====

Austrian economists argue that the Great Depression was the inevitable outcome of the monetary policies of the Federal Reserve during the 1920s. The central bank&#x27;s policy was an &quot;easy credit policy&quot; which led to an unsustainable credit-driven boom. The inflation of the money supply during this period led to an unsustainable boom in both asset prices (stocks and bonds) and capital goods. By the time the Federal Reserve belatedly tightened monetary policy in 1928, it was too late to avoid a significant economic contraction. Austrians argue that government intervention after the crash of 1929 delayed the market&#x27;s adjustment and made the road to complete recovery more difficult.

Acceptance of the Austrian explanation of what primarily caused the Great Depression is compatible with either acceptance or denial of the monetarist explanation. Austrian economist Murray Rothbard, who wrote &quot;America&#x27;s Great Depression&quot; (1963), rejected the monetarist explanation. He criticized Milton Friedman&#x27;s assertion that the central bank failed to sufficiently increase the supply of money, claiming instead that the Federal Reserve did pursue an inflationary policy when, in 1932, it purchased $1.1 billion of government securities, which raised its total holding to $1.8 billion. Rothbard says that despite the central bank&#x27;s policies, &quot;total bank reserves only rose by $212 million, while the total money supply fell by $3 billion&quot;. The reason for this, he argues, is that the American populace lost faith in the banking system and began hoarding more cash, a factor very much beyond the control of the Central Bank. The potential for a run on the banks caused local bankers to be more conservative in lending out their reserves, which, according to Rothbard&#x27;s argument, was the cause of the Federal Reserve&#x27;s inability to inflate.

Friedrich Hayek had criticised the Federal Reserve and the Bank of England in the 1930s for not taking a more contractionary stance. However, in 1975, Hayek admitted that he made a mistake in the 1930s in not opposing the Central Bank&#x27;s deflationary policy and stated the reason why he had been ambivalent: &quot;At that time I believed that a process of deflation of some short duration might break the rigidity of wages which I thought was incompatible with a functioning economy. In 1978, he made it clear that he agreed with the point of view of the monetarists, saying, &quot;I agree with Milton Friedman that once the Crash had occurred, the Federal Reserve System pursued a silly deflationary policy&quot;, and that he was as opposed to deflation as he was to inflation. Concordantly, economist Lawrence White argues that the business cycle theory of Hayek is inconsistent with a monetary policy which permits a severe contraction of the money supply.

====Marxian ====

Marxists generally argue that the Great Depression was the result of the inherent instability of the capitalist mode of production. According to Forbes, &quot;The idea that capitalism caused the Great Depression was widely held among intellectuals and the general public for many decades.&quot;

==Specific theories of cause==

===Non-debt deflation===
In addition to the debt deflation there was a component of productivity deflation that had been occurring since The Great Deflation of the last quarter of the 19th century. There may have also been a continuation of the correction to the sharp inflation caused by World War I.

Oil prices reached their all-time low in the early 1930s as production began from the East Texas Oil Field, the largest field ever found in the lower 48 states. With the oil market oversupplied prices locally fell to below ten cents per barrel.

===Productivity or technology shock===
In the first three decades of the 20th century productivity and economic output surged due in part to electrification, mass production and the increasing motorization of transportation and farm machinery. Electrification and mass production techniques such as Fordism permanently lowered the demand for labor relative to economic output. By the late 1920s the resultant rapid growth in productivity and investment in manufacturing meant there was a considerable excess production capacity.

Sometime after the peak of the business cycle in 1923, more workers were displaced by productivity improvements than growth in the employment market could meet, causing unemployment to slowly rise after 1925. Also, the work week fell slightly in the decade prior to the depression. Wages did not keep up with productivity growth, which led to the problem of underconsumption.

Henry Ford and Edward A. Filene were among prominent businessmen who were concerned with overproduction and underconsumption. Ford doubled wages of his workers in 1914. The over-production problem was also discussed in Congress, with Senator Reed Smoot proposing an import tariff, which became the Smoot–Hawley Tariff Act. The Smoot–Hawley Tariff was enacted in June 1930. The tariff was misguided because the U.S. had been running a trade account surplus during the 1920s.

Another effect of rapid technological change was that after 1910 the rate of capital investment slowed, primarily due to reduced investment in business structures.

The depression led to additional large numbers of plant closings.

It cannot be emphasized too strongly that the [productivity, output and employment] trends we are describing are long-time trends and were thoroughly evident prior to 1929. These trends are in nowise the result of the present depression, nor are they the result of the World War. On the contrary, the present depression is a collapse resulting from these long-term trends. — M. King Hubbert

In the book &quot;Mechanization in Industry&quot;, whose publication was sponsored by the National Bureau of Economic Research, Jerome (1934) noted that whether mechanization tends to increase output or displace labor depends on the elasticity of demand for the product. In addition, reduced costs of production were not always passed on to consumers. It was further noted that agriculture was adversely affected by the reduced need for animal feed as horses and mules were displaced by inanimate sources of power following World War I. As a related point, Jerome also notes that the term &quot;technological unemployment&quot; was being used to describe the labor situation during the depression.

Some portion of the increased unemployment which characterized the post-War years in the United States may be attributed to the mechanization of industries producing commodities of inelastic demand. — Fredrick C. Wells, 1934

The dramatic rise in productivity of major industries in the U. S. and the effects of productivity on output, wages and the work week are discussed by a Brookings Institution sponsored book.

Corporations decided to lay off workers and reduced the amount of raw materials they purchased to manufacture their products. This decision was made to cut the production of goods because of the amount of products that were not being sold.

Joseph Stiglitz and Bruce Greenwald suggested that it was a productivity-shock in agriculture, through fertilizers, mechanization and improved seed, that caused the drop in agricultural product prices. Farmers were forced off the land, further adding to the excess labor supply.

The prices of agricultural products began to decline after W.W.I and eventually many farmers were forced out of business, causing the failure of hundreds of small rural banks. Agricultural productivity resulting from tractors, fertilizers, and hybrid corn was only part of the problem; the other problem was the change over from horses and mules to internal combustion transportation. The horse and mule population began declining after W.W.I, freeing up enormous quantities of land previously used for animal feed.

The rise of the internal combustion engine and increasing numbers of motorcars and buses also halted the growth of electric street railways.

The years 1929 to 1941 had the highest total factor productivity growth in the history of the U. S., largely due to the productivity increases in public utilities, transportation and trade.

===Disparities in wealth and income===
Economists such as Waddill Catchings, William Trufant Foster, Rexford Tugwell, Adolph Berle (and later John Kenneth Galbraith), popularized a theory that had some influence on Franklin D. Roosevelt. This theory held that the economy produced more goods than consumers could purchase, because the consumers did not have enough income. According to this view, in the 1920s wages had increased at a lower rate than productivity growth, which had been high. Most of the benefit of the increased productivity went into profits, which went into the stock market bubble rather than into consumer purchases. Thus workers did not have enough income to absorb the large amount of capacity that had been added.

According to this view, the root cause of the Great Depression was a global overinvestment while the level of wages and earnings from independent businesses fell short of creating enough purchasing power. It was argued that government should intervene by an increased taxation of the rich to help make income more equal. With the increased revenue the government could create public works to increase employment and &#x27;kick start&#x27; the economy. In the U.S.A. the economic policies had been quite the opposite until 1932. The Revenue Act of 1932 and public works programmes introduced in Hoover&#x27;s last year as president and taken up by Roosevelt, created some redistribution of purchasing power.

The stock market crash made it evident that banking systems Americans were relying on were not dependable. Americans looked towards insubstantial banking units for their own liquidity supply. As the economy began to fail, these banks were no longer able to support those who depended on their assets – they did not hold as much power as the larger banks. During the depression, &quot;three waves of bank failures shook the economy.&quot; The first wave came just when the economy was heading in the direction of recovery at the end of 1930 and the beginning of 1931. The second wave of bank failures occurred &quot;after the Federal Reserve System raised the rediscount rate to stanch an outflow of gold&quot; around the end of 1931. The last wave, which began in the middle of 1932, was the worst and most devastating, continuing &quot;almost to the point of a total breakdown of the banking system in the winter of 1932–1933&quot;. The reserve banks led the United States into an even deeper depression between 1931 and 1933, due to their failure to appreciate and put to use the powers they withheld – capable of creating money – as well as the &quot;inappropriate monetary policies pursued by them during these years&quot;.

===Gold Standard system===

According to the gold standard theory of the Depression, the Depression was largely caused by the decision of most western nations after World War I to return to the gold standard at the pre-war gold price. Monetary policy, according to this view, was thereby put into a deflationary setting that would over the next decade slowly grind away at the health of many European economies.

This post-war policy was preceded by an inflationary policy during World War I, when many European nations abandoned the gold standard, forced by the enormous costs of the war. This resulted in inflation because the supply of new money that was created was spent on war, not on investments in productivity to increase aggregate supply that would have neutralized inflation. The view is that the quantity of new money introduced largely determines the inflation rate, and therefore, the cure to inflation is to reduce the amount of new currency created for purposes that are destructive or wasteful, and do not lead to economic growth.

After the war, when America and the nations of Europe went back on the gold standard, most nations decided to return to the gold standard at the pre-war price. When the United Kingdom, for example, passed the Gold Standard Act of 1925, thereby returning Britain to the gold standard, the critical decision was made to set the new price of the Pound Sterling at parity with the pre-war price even though the pound was then trading on the foreign exchange market at a much lower price. At the time, this action was criticized by John Maynard Keynes and others, who argued that in so doing, they were forcing a revaluation of wages without any tendency to equilibrium. Keynes&#x27; criticism of Chancellor of the Exchequer Winston Churchill&#x27;s form of the return to the gold standard implicitly compared it to the consequences of the Treaty of Versailles.

One of the reasons for setting the currencies at parity with the pre-war price was the prevailing opinion at that time that deflation was not a danger, while inflation, particularly the inflation in the Weimar Republic, was an unbearable danger. Another reason was that those who had loaned in nominal amounts hoped to recover the same value in gold that they had lent. Because of the World War I reparations that Germany had to pay France, Germany began a credit-fueled period of growth in order to export and sell enough goods abroad to gain gold to pay the reparations. The U.S., as the world&#x27;s gold sink, loaned money to Germany to stabilize its currency, which allowed it to access additional credit to spur the growth needed to pay back France, and France to pay back loans to the U.K. and the U.S. The loan and a reparations schedule were codified in the Dawes Plan.

In some cases, deflation can be hard on sectors of the economy such as agriculture, if they are deeply in debt at high interest rates and are unable to refinance, or that are dependent upon loans to finance capital goods when low interest rates are not available. Deflation erodes the price of commodities while increasing the real liability of debt. Deflation is beneficial to those with assets in cash, and to those who wish to invest or purchase assets or loan money.

More recent research, by economists such as Temin, Ben Bernanke, and Barry Eichengreen, has focused on the constraints policy makers were under at the time of the Depression. In this view, the constraints of the inter-war gold standard magnified the initial economic shock and were a significant obstacle to any actions that would ameliorate the growing Depression. According to them, the initial destabilizing shock may have originated with the Wall Street crash of 1929 in the U.S., but it was the gold standard system that transmitted the problem to the rest of the world.

According to their conclusions, during a time of crisis, policy makers may have wanted to loosen monetary and fiscal policy, but such action would threaten the countries&#x27; ability to maintain their obligation to exchange gold at its contractual rate. The gold standard required countries to maintain high interest rates to attract international investors who bought foreign assets with gold. Therefore, governments had their hands tied as the economies collapsed, unless they abandoned their currency&#x27;s link to gold. Fixing the exchange rate of all countries on the gold standard ensured that the market for foreign exchange can only equilibrate through interest rates. As the Depression worsened, many countries started to abandon the gold standard, and those that abandoned it earlier suffered less from deflation and tended to recover more quickly.

Richard Timberlake, economist of the free banking school and protégé of Milton Friedman, specifically addressed this stance in his paper &quot;Gold Standards and the Real Bills Doctrine in U.S. Monetary Policy&quot;, wherein he argued that the Federal Reserve actually had plenty of lee-way under the gold standard, as had been demonstrated by the price stability policy of New York Fed governor Benjamin Strong, between 1923 and 1928. But when Strong died in late 1928, the faction that took over dominance of the Fed advocated a real bills doctrine, where all money had to be represented by physical goods. This policy, forcing a 30% deflation of the dollar that inevitably damaged the U.S. economy, is stated by Timberlake as being arbitrary and avoidable, the existing gold standard having been capable of continuing without it:

:This shift in control was decisive. In accordance with the precedent Strong had set in promoting a stable price level policy without heed to any golden fetters, real bills proponents could proceed equally unconstrained in implementing their policy ideal. System policy in 1928–29 consequently shifted from price level stabilization to passive real bills. &quot;The&quot; gold standard remained where it had been—nothing but formal window dressing waiting for an opportune time to reappear.

===Financial institution structures===
Economic historians (especially Friedman and Schwartz) emphasize the importance of numerous bank failures. The failures were mostly in rural America. Structural weaknesses in the rural economy made local banks highly vulnerable. Farmers, already deeply in debt, saw farm prices plummet in the late 1920s and their implicit real interest rates on loans skyrocket.

Their land was already over-mortgaged (as a result of the 1919 bubble in land prices), and crop prices were too low to allow them to pay off what they owed. Small banks, especially those tied to the agricultural economy, were in constant crisis in the 1920s with their customers defaulting on loans because of the sudden rise in real interest rates; there was a steady stream of failures among these smaller banks throughout the decade.

The city banks also suffered from structural weaknesses that made them vulnerable to a shock. Some of the nation&#x27;s largest banks were failing to maintain adequate reserves and were investing heavily in the stock market or making risky loans. Loans to Germany and Latin America by New York City banks were especially risky. In other words, the banking system was not well prepared to absorb the shock of a major recession.

Economists have argued that a liquidity trap might have contributed to bank failures.

Economists and historians debate how much responsibility to assign the Wall Street Crash of 1929. The timing was right; the magnitude of the shock to expectations of future prosperity was high. Most analysts believe the market in 1928–29 was a &quot;bubble&quot; with prices far higher than justified by fundamentals. Economists agree that somehow it shared some blame, but how much no one has estimated. Milton Friedman concluded, &quot;I don&#x27;t doubt for a moment that the collapse of the stock market in 1929 played a role in the initial recession&quot;.

But the idea of owning government bonds initially became ideal to investors when Liberty Loan drives encouraged this possession in America during World War I. This strive for dominion persisted into the 1920s. After World War I, the United States became the world&#x27;s creditor and was depended upon by many foreign nations. &quot;Governments from around the globe looked to Wall Street for loans&quot;. Investors then started to depend on these loans for further investments. Chief counsel of the Senate Bank Committee, Ferdinand Pecora, disclosed that National City executives were also dependent on loans from a special bank fund as a safety net for their stock losses while American banker Albert H. Wiggin, &quot;made millions selling short his own bank shares&quot;.

Economist David Hume stated that the economy became imbalanced as the recession spread on an international scale. The cost of goods remained too high for too long during a time where there was less international trade. Policies set in selected countries to &quot;maintain the value of their currency&quot; resulted in an outcome of bank failures. Governments that continued to follow the gold standard were led into bank failure, meaning that it was the governments and central bankers that contributed as a stepping stool into the depression.

The debate has three sides: one group says the crash caused the depression by drastically lowering expectations about the future and by removing large sums of investment capital; a second group says the economy was slipping since summer 1929 and the crash ratified it; the third group says that in either scenario the crash could not have caused more than a recession. There was a brief recovery in the market into April 1930, but prices then started falling steadily again from there, not reaching a final bottom until July 1932. This was the largest long-term U.S. market decline by any measure. To move from a recession in 1930 to a deep depression in 1931–32, entirely different factors had to be in play.

===Protectionism===

Protectionism, such as the American Smoot–Hawley Tariff Act, is often indicated as a cause of the Great Depression, with countries enacting protectionist policies yielding a beggar thy neighbor result. The Smoot–Hawley Tariff Act was especially harmful to agriculture because it caused farmers to default on their loans. This event may have worsened or even caused the ensuing bank runs in the Midwest and West that caused the collapse of the banking system. A petition signed by over 1,000 economists was presented to the U.S. government warning that the Smoot–Hawley Tariff Act would bring disastrous economic repercussions; however, this did not stop the act from being signed into law.

Governments around the world took various steps into spending less money on foreign goods such as: &quot;imposing tariffs, import quotas, and exchange controls&quot;. These restrictions formed a lot of tension between trade nations, causing a major deduction during the depression. Not all countries enforced the same measures of protectionism. Some countries raised tariffs drastically and enforced severe restrictions on foreign exchange transactions, while other countries condensed &quot;trade and exchange restrictions only marginally&quot;:
*&quot;Countries that remained on the gold standard, keeping currencies fixed, were more likely to restrict foreign trade.&quot; These countries &quot;resorted to protectionist policies to strengthen the balance of payments and limit gold losses&quot;. They hoped that these restrictions and depletions would hold the economic decline. 
*Countries that abandoned the gold standard, allowed their currencies to depreciate which caused their Balance of payments to strengthen. It also freed up monetary policy so that central banks could lower interest rates and act as lenders of last resort. They possessed the best policy instruments to fight the Depression and did not need protectionism.
*&quot;The length and depth of a country&#x27;s economic downturn and the timing and vigor of its recovery is related to how long it remained on the gold standard. Countries abandoning the gold standard relatively early experienced relatively mild recessions and early recoveries. In contrast, countries remaining on the gold standard experienced prolonged slumps.&quot;

In a 1995 survey of American economic historians, two-thirds agreed that the Smoot-Hawley tariff act at least worsened the Great Depression. However, many economists believe that the Smoot-Hawley tariff act was not a major contributor to the great depression. Economist Paul Krugman holds that, &quot;Where protectionism really mattered was in preventing a recovery in trade when production recovered&quot;. He cites a report by Barry Eichengreen and Douglas Irwin: Figure 1 in that report shows trade and production dropping together from 1929 to 1932, but production increasing faster than trade from 1932 to 1937. The authors argue that adherence to the gold standard forced many countries to resort to tariffs, when instead they should have devalued their currencies. Peter Temin argues that contrary the popular argument, the contractionary effect of the tariff was small. He notes that exports were 7 percent of GNP in 1929, they fell by 1.5 percent of 1929 GNP in the next two years and the fall was offset by the increase in domestic demand from tariff.

===International debt structure===
When the war came to an end in 1918, all European nations that had been allied with the U.S. owed large sums of money to American banks, sums much too large to be repaid out of their shattered treasuries. This is one reason why the Allies had insisted (to the consternation of Woodrow Wilson) on reparation payments from Germany and Austria-Hungary. Reparations, they believed, would provide them with a way to pay off their own debts. However, the German Empire and Austria-Hungary were themselves in deep economic trouble after the war; they were no more able to pay the reparations than the Allies to pay their debts.

The debtor nations put strong pressure on the U.S. in the 1920s to forgive the debts, or at least reduce them. The American government refused. Instead, U.S. banks began making large loans to the nations of Europe. Thus, debts (and reparations) were being paid only by augmenting old debts and piling up new ones. In the late 1920s, and particularly after the American economy began to weaken after 1929, the European nations found it much more difficult to borrow money from the U.S. At the same time, high U.S. tariffs were making it much more difficult for them to sell their goods in U.S. markets. Without any source of revenue from foreign exchange to repay their loans, they began to default.

Beginning late in the 1920s, European demand for U.S. goods began to decline. That was partly because European industry and agriculture were becoming more productive, and partly because some European nations (most notably Weimar Germany) were suffering serious financial crises and could not afford to buy goods overseas. However, the central issue causing the destabilization of the European economy in the late 1920s was the international debt structure that had emerged in the aftermath of World War I.

The high tariff walls such as the Smoot–Hawley Tariff Act critically impeded the payment of war debts. As a result of high U.S. tariffs, only a sort of cycle kept the reparations and war-debt payments going. During the 1920s, the former allies paid the war-debt installments to the U.S. chiefly with funds obtained from German reparations payments, and Germany was able to make those payments only because of large private loans from the U.S. and Britain. Similarly, U.S. investments abroad provided the dollars, which alone made it possible for foreign nations to buy U.S. exports.

The Smoot–Hawley Tariff Act was instituted by Senator Reed Smoot and Representative Willis C. Hawley, and signed into law by President Hoover, to raise taxes on American imports by about 20 percent during June 1930. This tax, which added to already shrinking income and overproduction in the U.S., only benefitted Americans in having to spend less on foreign goods. In contrast, European trading nations frowned upon this tax increase, particularly since the &quot;United States was an international creditor and exports to the U.S. market were already declining&quot;. In response to the Smoot–Hawley Tariff Act, some of America&#x27;s primary producers and largest trading partner, Canada, chose to seek retribution by increasing the financial value of imported goods favoured by the Americans.

In the scramble for liquidity that followed the 1929 stock market crash, funds flowed back from Europe to America, and Europe&#x27;s fragile economies crumbled.

By 1931, the world was reeling from the worst depression of recent memory, and the entire structure of reparations and war debts collapsed.

===Population dynamics===
In 1939, prominent economist Alvin Hansen discussed the decline in population growth in relation to the Depression.
The same idea was discussed in a 1978 journal article by Clarence Barber, an economist at the University of Manitoba. Using &quot;a form of the Harrod model&quot; to analyze the Depression, Barber states:

Barber says, while there is &quot;no clear evidence&quot; of a decline in &quot;the rate of growth of productivity&quot; during the 1920s, there is &quot;clear evidence&quot; the population growth rate began to decline during that same period. He argues the decline in population growth rate may have caused a decline in &quot;the natural rate of growth&quot; which was significant enough to cause a serious depression.

Barber says a decline in the population growth rate is likely to affect the demand for housing, and claims this is apparently what happened during the 1920s. He concludes:

The decline in housing construction that can be attributed to demographics has been estimated to range from 28% in 1933 to 38% in 1940.

Among the causes of the decline in the population growth rate during the 1920s were a declining birth rate after 1910 and reduced immigration. The decline in immigration was largely the result of legislation in the 1920s placing greater restrictions on immigration. In 1921, Congress passed the Emergency Quota Act, followed by the Immigration Act of 1924.

Factors that majorly contributed to the failing of the economy since 1925, was a decrease in both residential and non-residential buildings being constructed. It was the debt as a result of the war, fewer families being formed, and an imbalance of mortgage payments and loans in 1928–29, that mainly contributed to the decline in the number of houses being built. This caused the population growth rate to decelerate. Though non-residential units continued to be built &quot;at a high rate throughout the decade&quot;, the demand for such units was actually very low.

==Role of economic policy==

===Calvin Coolidge (1923–29)===

There is an ongoing debate between historians as to what extent President Calvin Coolidge&#x27;s laissez-faire hands-off attitude contributed to the Great Depression. Despite a growing rate of bank failures, he did not heed voices that predicted the lack of banking regulation as potentially dangerous. He did not listen to members of Congress warning that stock speculation had gone too far and he ignored criticisms that workers did not participate sufficiently in the prosperity of the Roaring Twenties.

===Leave-it-alone liquidationism (1929–33)===
====Overview====

From the point of view of today&#x27;s mainstream schools of economic thought, government should strive to keep some broad nominal aggregate on a stable growth path (for proponents of new classical macroeconomics and monetarism, the measure is the nominal money supply; for Keynesian economists it is the nominal aggregate demand itself). During a depression the central bank should pour liquidity into the banking system and the government should cut taxes and accelerate spending in order to keep the nominal money stock and total nominal demand from collapsing.

The United States government and the Federal Reserve did not do that during the 1929‑32 slide into the Great Depression The existence of &quot;liquidationism&quot; played a key part in motivating public policy decisions not to fight the gathering Great Depression. An increasingly common view among economic historians is that the adherence of some Federal Reserve policymakers to the liquidationist thesis led to disastrous consequences. Regarding the policies of President Hoover, economists Barry Eichengreen and J. Bradford DeLong point out that the Hoover administration&#x27;s fiscal policy was guided by liquidationist economists and policy makers, as Hoover tried to keep the federal budget balanced until 1932, when Hoover lost confidence in his Secretary of the Treasury Andrew Mellon and replaced him. Hoover wrote in his memoirs he did not side with the liquidationists, but took the side of those in his cabinet with &quot;economic responsibility&quot;, his Secretary of Commerce Robert P. Lamont and Secretary of Agriculture Arthur M. Hyde, who advised the President to &quot;use the powers of government to cushion the situation&quot;. But at the same time he kept Andrew Mellon as Secretary of the Treasury until February 1932. It was during 1932 that Hoover began to support more aggressive measures to combat the Depression. In his memoirs, President Hoover wrote bitterly about members of his Cabinet who had advised inaction during the downslide into the Great Depression:

Before the &quot;Keynesian Revolution&quot;, such a liquidationist theory was a common position for economists to take and was held and advanced by economists like Friedrich Hayek, Lionel Robbins, Joseph Schumpeter, Seymour E. Harris and others. According to the liquidationists a depression is good medicine. The function of a depression is to liquidate failed investments and businesses that have been made obsolete by technological development in order to release factors of production (capital and labor) from unproductive uses. These can then be redeployed in other sectors of the technologically dynamic economy. They asserted that deflationary policy minimized the duration of the Depression of 1920–21 by tolerating liquidation which subsequently created economic growth later in the decade. They pushed for deflationary policies (which were already executed in 1921) which – in their opinion – would assist the release of capital and labor from unproductive activities to lay the groundwork for a new economic boom. The liquidationists argued that even if self-adjustment of the economy took mass bankruptcies, then so be it. Postponing the liquidation process would only magnify the social costs. Schumpeter wrote that it

Despite liquidationist expectations, a large proportion of the capital stock was not redeployed and vanished during the first years of the Great Depression. According to a study by Olivier Blanchard and Lawrence Summers, the recession caused a drop of net capital accumulation to pre-1924 levels by 1933.

====Criticism====
Economists such as John Maynard Keynes and Milton Friedman suggested that the do-nothing policy prescription which resulted from the liquidationist theory contributed to deepening the Great Depression. With the rhetoric of ridicule, Keynes tried to discredit the liquidationist view in presenting Hayek, Robbins and Schumpeter as

Milton Friedman stated that at the University of Chicago such &quot;dangerous nonsense&quot; was never taught and that he understood why at Harvard University —where such nonsense was taught— bright young economists rejected their teachers&#x27; macroeconomics, and become Keynesians. He wrote:

Economist Lawrence White, while acknowledging that Hayek and Robbins did not actively oppose the deflationary policy of the early 1930s, nevertheless challenges the argument of Milton Friedman, J. Bradford DeLong et al. that Hayek was a proponent of liquidationism. White argues that the business cycle theory of Hayek and Robbins (which later developed into Austrian business cycle theory in its present-day form) was actually not consistent with a monetary policy which permitted a severe contraction of the money supply. Nevertheless, White says that at the time of the Great Depression Hayek &quot;expressed ambivalence about the shrinking nominal income and sharp deflation in 1929–32&quot;. In a talk in 1975, Hayek admitted the mistake he made over forty years earlier in not opposing the Central Bank&#x27;s deflationary policy and stated the reason why he had been &quot;ambivalent&quot;: &quot;At that time I believed that a process of deflation of some short duration might break the rigidity of wages which I thought was incompatible with a functioning economy.&quot; 1979 Hayek strongly criticized the Fed&#x27;s contractionary monetary policy early in the Depression and its failure to offer banks liquidity:

====Economic policy====
Historians gave Hoover credit for working tirelessly to combat the depression and noted that he left government prematurely aged. But his policies are rated as simply not far-reaching enough to address the Great Depression. He was prepared to do something, but nowhere near enough. Hoover was no exponent of laissez-faire. But his principal philosophies were voluntarism, self-help, and rugged individualism. He refused direct federal intervention. He believed that government should do more than his immediate predecessors (Warren G. Harding, Calvin Coolidge) believed. But he was not willing to go as far as Franklin D. Roosevelt later did. Therefore, he is described as the &quot;first of the new presidents&quot; and &quot;the last of the old&quot;.

Hoover&#x27;s first measures were based on voluntarism by businesses not to reduce their workforce or cut wages. But businesses had little choice and wages were reduced, workers were laid off, and investments postponed. The Hoover administration extended over $100 million in emergency farm loans and some $915 million in public works projects between 1930 and 1932. Hoover urged bankers to set up the National Credit Corporation so that big banks could help failing banks survive. But bankers were reluctant to invest in failing banks, and the National Credit Corporation did almost nothing to address the problem. In 1932 Hoover reluctantly established the Reconstruction Finance Corporation, a Federal agency with the authority to lend up to $2 billion to rescue banks and restore confidence in financial institutions. But $2 billion was not enough to save all the banks, and bank runs and bank failures continued.

====Federal spending====

J. Bradford DeLong explained that Hoover would have been a budget cutter in normal times and continuously wanted to balance the budget. Hoover held the line against powerful political forces that sought to increase government spending after the Depression began for fully two and a half years. During the first two years of the Depression (1929 and 1930) Hoover actually achieved budget surpluses of about 0.8% of gross domestic product (GDP). In 1931, when the recession significantly worsened and GDP declined by 15%, the federal budget had only a small deficit of 0.6% of GDP. It was not until 1932 (when GDP declined by 27% compared to 1929-level) that Hoover pushed for measures (Reconstruction Finance Corporation, Federal Home Loan Bank Act, direct loans to fund state Depression relief programs) that increased spending. But at the same time he pushed for the Revenue Act of 1932 that massively increased taxes in order to balance the budget again.

Uncertainty was a major factor, argued by several economists, that contributed to the worsening and length of the depression. It was also said to be responsible &quot;for the initial decline in consumption that marks the&quot; beginning of the Great Depression by economists Paul R. Flacco and Randall E. Parker. Economist Ludwig Lachmann argues that it was pessimism that prevented the recovery and worsening of the depression President Hoover is said to have been blinded from what was right in front of him.

Economist James Duesenberry argues economic imbalance was not only a result of World War I, but also of the structural changes made during the first quarter of the Twentieth Century. He also states the branches of the nation&#x27;s economy became smaller, there was not much demand for housing, and the stock market crash &quot;had a more direct impact on consumption than any previous financial panic&quot;.

Economist William A. Lewis describes the conflict between America and its primary producers:

The stock market crash was not the first sign of the Great Depression. &quot;Long before the crash, community banks were failing at the rate of one per day&quot;. It was the development of the Federal Reserve System that misled investors in the 1920s into relying on federal banks as a safety net. They were encouraged to continue buying stocks and to overlook any of the fluctuations. Economist Roger Babson tried to warn the investors of the deficiency to come, but was ridiculed even as the economy began to deteriorate during the summer of 1929. While England and Germany struggled under the strain on gold currencies after the war, economists were blinded by an unsustainable &#x27;new economy&#x27; they sought to be considerably stable and successful.

Since the United States decided to no longer comply with the gold standard, &quot;the value of the dollar could change freely from day to day&quot;. Although this imbalance on an international scale led to crisis, the economy within the nation remained stable.

The depression then affected all nations on an international scale. &quot;The German mark collapsed when the chancellor put domestic politics ahead of sensible finance; the bank of England abandoned the gold standard after a subsequent speculative attack; and the U.S. Federal Reserve raised its discount rate dramatically in October 1931 to preserve the value of the dollar&quot;. The Federal Reserve drove the American economy into an even deeper depression.

====Tax policy====
In 1929 the Hoover administration responded to the economic crises by temporarily lowering income tax rates and the corporate tax rate. At the beginning of 1931, tax returns showed a tremendous decline in income due to the economic downturn. Income tax receipts were 40% less than in 1930. At the same time government spending proved to be a lot greater than estimated. As a result, the budget deficit increased tremendously. While Secretary of the Treasury Andrew Mellon urged to increase taxes, Hoover had no desire to do so since 1932 was an election year. In December 1931, hopes that the economic downturn would come to an end vanished since all economic indicators pointed to a continuing downward trend. On January 7, 1932, Andrew Mellon announced that the Hoover administration would end a further increase in public debt by raising taxes. On June 6, 1932, the Revenue Act of 1932 was signed into law.

===Franklin D. Roosevelt (1933–45)===

Roosevelt won the 1932 presidential election promising to promote recovery. He enacted a series of programs, including Social Security, banking reform, and suspension of the gold standard, collectively known as the New Deal.

The majority of historians and economists argue the New Deal was beneficial to recovery. In a survey of economic historians conducted by Robert Whaples, professor of economics at Wake Forest University, anonymous questionnaires were sent to members of the &quot;Economic History Association&quot;. Members were asked to either &quot;disagree&quot;, &quot;agree&quot;, or &quot;agree with provisos&quot; with the statement that read: &quot;Taken as a whole, government policies of the New Deal served to lengthen and deepen the Great Depression.&quot; While only 6% of economic historians who worked in the history department of their universities agreed with the statement, 27% of those that work in the economics department agreed. Almost an identical percent of the two groups (21% and 22%) agreed with the statement &quot;with provisos&quot;, while 74% of those who worked in the history department, and 51% in the economics department, disagreed with the statement outright.

====Arguments for key to recovery====
According to Peter Temin, Barry Wigmore, Gauti B. Eggertsson and Christina Romer the biggest primary impact of the New Deal on the economy and the key to recovery and to end the Great Depression was brought about by a successful management of public expectations. Before the first New Deal measures people expected a contractionary economic situation (recession, deflation) to persist. Roosevelt&#x27;s fiscal and monetary policy regime change helped to make his policy objectives credible. Expectations changed towards an expansionary development (economic growth, inflation). The expectation of higher future income and higher future inflation stimulated demand and investments. The analysis suggests that the elimination of the policy dogmas of the gold standard, balanced budget and small government led to a large shift in expectation that accounts for about 70–80 percent of the recovery of output and prices from 1933 to 1937. If the regime change would not have happened and the Hoover policy would have continued, the economy would have continued its free fall in 1933, and output would have been 30 percent lower in 1937 than in 1933.

====Arguments for prolongation of the Great Depression====
In the new classical macroeconomics view of the Great Depression large negative shocks caused the 1929–33 downturn – including monetary shocks, productivity shocks, and banking shocks – but those developments become positive after 1933 due to monetary and banking reform policies. According to the model Cole-Ohanian impose, the main culprits for the prolonged depression were labor frictions and productivity/efficiency frictions (perhaps, to a lesser extent). Financial frictions are unlikely to have caused the prolonged slump.

In the Cole-Ohanian model there is a slower than normal recovery which they explain by New Deal policies which they evaluated as tending towards monopoly and distribution of wealth. The key economic paper looking at these diagnostic sources in relation to the Great Depression is Cole and Ohanian&#x27;s work. Cole-Ohanian point at two policies of New Deal: the National Industrial Recovery Act and National Labor Relations Act (NLRA), the latter strengthening NIRA&#x27;s labor provision. According to Cole-Ohanian New Deal policies created cartelization, high wages, and high prices in at least manufacturing and some energy and mining industries. Roosevelts policies against the severity of the Depression like the NIRA, a &quot;code of fair competition&quot; for each industry were aimed to reduce cutthroat competition in a period of severe deflation, which was seen as the cause for lowered demand and employment. The NIRA suspended antitrust laws and permitted collusion in some sectors provided that industry raised wages above clearing level and accepted collective bargaining with labor unions. The effects of cartelization can be seen as the basic effect of monopoly. The given corporation produces too little, charges too high of a price, and under-employs labor. Likewise, an increase in the power of unions creates a situation similar to monopoly. Wages are too high for the union members, so the corporation employs fewer people and, produces less output. Cole-Ohanian show that 60% of the difference between the trend and realized output is due to cartelization and unions. Chari, Kehoe, McGrattan also present a nice exposition that&#x27;s in line with Cole-Ohanian.

This type of analysis has numerous counterarguments including the applicability of the equilibrium business cycle to the Great Depression.

<doc id="455152" wikidata="Q1298339" url="?curid=455152" title="Livery">
<text>A livery is an identifying design, such as a uniform, ornament, symbol or insignia that designates ownership or affiliation, often found on an individual or vehicle. Livery often includes elements of the heraldry relating to the individual or corporate body featured in the livery. Alternatively, some kind of a personal emblem or badge, or a distinctive colour, is featured. 

The word itself derives from the French &quot;livrée&quot;, meaning &quot;dispensed, handed over&quot;. Most often it would indicate that the wearer of the livery was a servant, dependant, follower or friend of the owner of the livery, or, in the case of objects, that the object belonged to them.

In the late medieval phenomenon of bastard feudalism, livery badges worn by the &quot;retainers&quot; of great lords, sometimes in effect private armies, became a great political concern in England.

==Etymology ==
&quot;In the &quot;Black Book&quot; of 1483, it was laid down that each person should receive &#x27;... for his Livery at night, half a chet loaf, one quart of wine. one gallon of ale; and for Winter livery...one percher wax, one candle wax...&#x27;&quot;

&quot;Edmund Spenser noted in 1596 that &#x27;... the liverye is sayd to be served up all night, that is theyr nyghtes allowances of drinks...&#x27;&quot;

In the early inventories of households, in the chambers there are a large number of &quot;Livery Cupboards&quot; recorded, presumably used for storing the Livery. 

During the 12th century, specific colours denoting a great person began to be used for both his soldiers and his civilian followers (the two often overlapped considerably), and the modern sense of the term began to form. Usually two different colours were used together (and often with a device or badge sewn on), but the ways in which they were combined varied with rank. Often the colours used were different each year. In addition to embroidered badges, metal ones were sewn on to clothing, or hung on neck-chains or (by far the most prestigious) livery collars. From the 16th century onwards, only the lower-status followers tended to receive clothes in livery colours (whilst the higher status ones received cash) and the term &quot;servant&quot;, previously much wider, also began to be restricted to describing the same people. Municipalities and corporations copied the behaviour of the great households.

The term is also used to describe badges, buttons and grander pieces of jewellery containing the heraldic signs of an individual, which were given by that person to friends, followers and distinguished visitors, as well as (in more modest forms) servants. The grandest of these is the livery collar. William, Lord Hastings the favourite of King Edward IV of England had a &quot;Coller of gold of K. Edward&#x27;s lyverys&quot; valued at the enormous sum of £40 in an inventory of 1489. This would have been similar to the collars worn by Hastings&#x27; sister and her husband Sir John Donne in the &quot;Donne Triptych&quot; by Hans Memling (described in Sir John Donne). Lords gave their servants lead or pewter badges to sew onto their clothes. In the 15th century, European royalty sometimes distributed uniform suits of clothes to courtiers, as the House of Fugger, the leading bankers, did to all employees.

This practice later contracted to the provision of standardized clothing to male servants, often in a colour-scheme distinctive to a particular family. The term most notably referred to the embroidered coats, waistcoats, knee breeches and stockings in 18th-century style, worn by footmen on formal occasions in grand houses. Plainer clothing in dark colours and without braiding was worn by footmen, chauffeurs and other employees for ordinary duties. For financial reasons, the employment of such servants, and their expensive dress, died out after World War I except in royal households.

==At European courts==

Most European royal courts still use their state liveries on formal occasions. These are generally in traditional national colours, and are based on 18th-century clothing with fine gold embroidery. Only male royal servants normally wear livery. Knee breeches are worn, normally with white silk stockings; one exception being the Spanish court which prescribes red.
=== United Kingdom ===
At the British royal court, scarlet state livery is still worn by footmen, coachmen and other attendants on state occasions. The full-dress scarlet coats are handmade, and embroidered in gold braid with the royal cypher of the monarch. Gold buttons and other trimmings are of designs and patterns which date from the 18th century, and the full state dress worn by footmen includes scarlet breeches, stockings and a sword. On other formal occasions, a &#x27;semi-state&#x27; dress is worn: a scarlet tail coat, black trousers and a white stiff shirt and bow tie. Normal day-to-day dress (as worn by footmen on duty in the palace, except on special occasions) consists of a black tail coat and trousers, white shirt and black tie and a scarlet waistcoat with gold trimming. Pages wear similar daily, semi-state and (very occasionally) state liveries, but in dark blue rather than scarlet. The uniform clothing issued to full-time royal staff is tailor-made, but the seldom-worn full-state dress is not bespoke; the usual practice is to select individuals whose height fits the existing ceremonial coats held in storage.

Pages of Honour to the king wear scarlet (or, in Scotland, green) frock coats with blue velvet cuffs, edged all round with gold lace, with white breeches and hose, a short sword and other accoutrements. 

Scarlet is the livery colour of the sovereign and of the royal court. Elizabeth II also had a family livery colour, however, known as &#x27;Edinburgh Green&#x27;, which she and the Duke of Edinburgh chose in 1948. Five years later, at her coronation, while the Queen&#x27;s attendants wore scarlet the page in attendance on the Duke wore a green livery edged in silver. Subsequently, Edinburgh Green became the colour used for their private cars and carriages (whereas the official vehicles are painted in a royal livery colour of maroon (or &#x27;claret&#x27;) and black). The Queen, the Duchess of Cornwall, the Princess Royal, the Queen of Spain and Princess Beatrix of the Netherlands wore outfits with the shades of Edinburgh Green at a thanksgiving service for the duke in 2022.

=== Belgium ===
At the Belgian court liveries in traditional colours are still used at state occasions. The coats are red, and have black cuffs with golden lace. Royal cyphers are embroidered on the shoulders. The breeches are of yellow fabric. The semi-state livery worn for less formal occasions has black breeches.

===The Netherlands===
At the Dutch court the full state livery is blue (&quot;nassaublauw&quot;). The breeches are yellow, and cuffs are red.

==Sue one&#x27;s livery==
The phrase &quot;to sue one&#x27;s livery&quot; refers to the formal recognition of a noble&#x27;s majority, in exchange of payment, for conferring the powers attached to his title, and thereby freeing him from dependence as a ward.

==Modern usage==


From this core meaning, multiple extended or specialist meanings have derived, mostly related to exterior graphic designs on vehicles. Examples include:
*A livery company is the name used for a guild in the City of London; members of the company were allowed to dress their servants in the distinctive uniform of their trade, and the company&#x27;s charters enabled them to prevent others from embarking upon the trades within the company&#x27;s jurisdiction.
* A fleet livery is the common design and paint scheme a business or organization uses on its fleet vehicles, often using specific colors and logo placement. For example, the United Parcel Service has trucks with a well-known brown livery. This may sometimes used alongside wrap advertising. Fleet liveries can be used to promote a brand or for unrelated advertising compared to the goods contained in the vehicle. This can enable companies to become iconic as a result of their livery. An example is the truck fleet of Eddie Stobart Group, which has a deal with Corgi to sell replicas of their trucks with their unique red, green, and white livery.
** Fleet liveries are also used by emergency services to make emergency vehicles visually distinct from civilian traffic, allowing for higher visibility and easy identification. Depending on the policies of the agency and the scope of its jurisdiction, the livery used by an emergency vehicle fleet may be the same or similar across a municipality, region, or entire country; alternatively, they may differ in each municipality or region, under each agency, or even depending on the vehicle&#x27;s assigned purpose. Examples of markings and designs used in emergency vehicle liveries include black and white, Battenburg markings, Sillitoe tartan, &quot;jam sandwich&quot; markings, and reflective decals.
* A racing livery is the specific paint scheme and sticker design used in motorsport, on vehicles, in order to attract sponsorship and to advertise sponsors, as well as to identify vehicles as belonging to a specific racing team.
* Aircraft livery is also the term describing the paint scheme of an aircraft. Most airlines have a standard paint scheme for their aircraft fleet, usually prominently displaying the airline logo or name. From time to time special liveries are introduced, for example prior to big events.
* A &quot;livery vehicle&quot; remains a legal term of art in the U.S. and Canada for a vehicle for hire, such as a taxicab or chauffeured limousine, but excluding a rented vehicle driven by the renter. In some jurisdictions a &quot;livery vehicle&quot; covers vehicles that carry up to fifteen passengers, but not more, thus including a jitney but excluding an omnibus or motorcoach. This usage stems from the hackney cabs or coaches that could be provided by a livery stable. By extension, there are boat livery companies for the hire of watercraft. Canada has many businesses offering canoe livery.
* A livery stable (from 1705, derived from the obsolete sense of &quot;provender for horses&quot; found in the mid-15th century) looks after the care, feeding, stabling, etc., of horses for pay.

==Historical military usage==
The term &quot;livery&quot; is now rarely applied in a military context, so it would be unusual for it to refer to a military uniform or the painting design of a military vehicle. The modern military equivalent for &quot;livery&quot; is the term &quot;standard issue&quot;, which is used when referring to the colors and regulations required in respect of any military clothing or equipment.

Early uniforms were however regarded as a form of livery (&quot;the King&#x27;s coat&quot;) during the late 17th and early 18th centuries in the European monarchies. During this period, officers of the French &quot;Garde du Corps&quot; (the Royal Bodyguard) successfully petitioned to not be required to wear uniforms while on duty within the palace at Versailles, since this livery suggested that they were servants rather than aristocrats.

<text>is a tower and landmark of Osaka, Japan, and advertises the Hitachi company. It is located in the Shinsekai district of Naniwa-ku, Osaka. Its total height is ; the main observation deck is at a height of . It is owned by 

== History ==
The current tower is the second to occupy the site. The original tower, patterned after the Eiffel Tower and the Arc de Triomphe, was built in 1912, and was connected to the adjacent amusement park, Luna Park, by an aerial cable car. At the time of its construction, its height of made it the second tallest structure in Asia. It quickly became one of the most popular locations in the city, drawing visitors from all over the area. The original structure was severely damaged by a fire in 1943, and rather than being repaired, it was disassembled and the steel used for the war effort.

After World War II, citizens lobbied to rebuild the tower. A private company, the Tsūtenkaku Kanko Co. Ltd., was established, and Tachū Naitō, Japan&#x27;s &quot;Father of Towers&quot; was selected to design it. The new, eight-sided structure was opened in 1956.

On the fifth floor observation deck is enshrined Billiken, the God of Happiness or &quot;things as they ought to be&quot;. Billiken, a popular American charm doll that came to Japan in about 1910, was enshrined within Luna Park when it opened. When the park closed in 1923, the wooden statue of Billiken went missing. As a part of an effort to revive the tower, a copy of Billiken was made from an old photograph and placed inside the tower in 1979. The statue of Billiken became closely associated with the tower and is a popular symbol of good luck. Each year, thousands of visitors place a coin in his donation box and rub the soles of his feet to make their wishes come true.

The tower is also known for its neon lights, which change every few years (they were shut off during the oil crisis of 1974–76). The neon lights have now been replaced by LED lighting, showing a different color set for every two months (e.g. pink for cherry blossom in March/April). Hitachi has sponsored the tower since 1957, and the light designs usually spell out Hitachi advertisements, although one side of the tower is usually occupied by a public service announcement. The lights on top of the tower are a weather beacon indicating the next day&#x27;s weather forecast by a combination of different colors.

<doc id="455164" wikidata="Q369690" url="?curid=455164" title="Ibn Kathir">
<text>Abu al-Fida Isma&#x27;il ibn Umar ibn Kathir al-Dimashqi (; ), known simply as Ibn Kathir, was an Arab Islamic exegete, historian and scholar. An expert on (Quranic exegesis), (history) and (Islamic jurisprudence), he is considered a leading authority on Sunni Islam.

Born in Bostra, Mamluk Sultanate, Ibn Kathir&#x27;s teachers include al-Dhahabi and Ibn Taymiyya. He wrote several books, including a fourteen-volume universal history titled ().

His renowned , , is recognized for its critical approach to , especially among Western Muslims and Wahhabi scholars. His methodology largely derives from his teacher Ibn Taymiyya, and differs from that of other earlier renowned exegetes such as Tabari. He adhered to the Athari school of Islamic theology.

==Biography==
His full name was () and had the (epithet) of (, &#x27;pillar of the faith&#x27;).
His family traces its lineage back to the tribe of Quraysh. He was born in Mijdal, a village on the outskirts of the city of Busra, in the east of Damascus, Syria, around about AH 701 (AD 1300/1). He was taught by Ibn Taymiyya and Al-Dhahabi.

Upon completion of his studies he obtained his first official appointment in 1341, when he joined an inquisitorial commission formed to determine certain questions of heresy.

He married the daughter of Al-Mizzi, one of the foremost Syrian scholars of the period, which gave him access to the scholarly elite. In 1345 he was made preacher (&quot;khatib&quot;) at a newly built mosque in Mizza, the hometown of his father-in-law. In 1366, he rose to a professorial position at the Great Mosque of Damascus.

In later life, he became blind. He attributes his blindness to working late at night on the &quot;Musnad&quot; of Ahmad Ibn Hanbal in an attempt to rearrange it topically rather than by narrator.
He died in February 1373 (AH 774) in Damascus. He was buried next to his teacher Ibn Taymiyya.

==Creed==
The records from modern researchers such as Taha Jabir Alalwani, Yazid Abdu al Qadir al-Jawas, and Barbara Stowasser has demonstrated important similarities between Ibn Kathir and his influential master Taqi al-Din Ibn Taymiyyah, such as rejecting logical exegesis of &quot;Qur&#x27;an&quot;, advocating a militant &quot;jihad&quot; and adhering to the renewal of one singular &quot;Islamic ummah&quot;. In contemporary scholarship, Ibn Kathir is widely regarded as an anti-rationalistic, hadith oriented scholar who adhered to the Athari creed, much like his mentor Ibn Taymiyya. According to Jane McAuliffe in regards of Qur&#x27;anic exegesis, Ibn Kathir uses methods contrary to former Sunni scholars, and followed largely the methodology of Ibn Taymiyyah. Barbara Freyer contends that this anti-rationalistic, traditionalistic and hadith oriented approaches held by Ibn Kathir were shared not only by Ibn Taymiyyah, but also by Ibn Hazm, Bukhari independent Madhhab, and also scholars from Jariri, and Zahiri Maddhabs. According to Christian Lange, although he was a Shafi, he was closely aligned with Damascene Hanbalism. David L. Johnston described him as &quot;the traditionist and Ash&#x27;arite Ibn Kathir&quot;.

Taha Jabir Alalwani, Professor and President of Cordoba University in Ashburn, Virginia maintains that these traditionalistic views of Ibn Kathir claimed by Salafists were rooted further to the generation of Sahaba Salaf, where Zubayr ibn al-Awwam, one of The ten to whom Paradise was promised also taught this view. Contemporary researchers notes that these anti rationalistic, anti Ash&#x27;arite methods of Ibn Kathir shared with his teacher Ibn Taimiyyah; were proven in his tafseer regarding the Day of Resurrection and Hypocrisy in Qur&#x27;an.

Ibn Kathir states:
&quot;People have said a great deal on this topic and this is not the place to expound on what they have said. On this matter, we follow the early Muslims (salaf): Malik, Awza&#x27;i, Thawri, Layth ibn Sa&#x27;d, Shafi&#x27;i, Ahmad ibn Hanbal, Ishaq Ibn Rahwayh, and others among the Imams of the Muslims, both ancient and modern that is, to let (the verse in question) pass as it has come, without saying how it is meant (&quot;min ghayr takyif&quot;), without likening it to created things (&quot;wa la tashbih&quot;), and without nullifying it (&quot;wa la ta&#x27;til&quot;): &quot;The literal meaning (&quot;zahir&quot;) that occurs to the minds of anthropomorphists (&quot;al-mushabbihin&quot;) is negated of Allah&quot;, for nothing from His creation resembles Him: &quot;There is nothing whatsoever like unto Him, and He is the All-Hearing, the All-Seeing&quot; Rather this affair is like what the Grand Shaykh of Imam Bukhari Shaykh Naeem ibn Hamaad Khazaa&#x27;i said &quot;Whosoever likens Allah to his Creation has done Kufr (disbelieved) and whosoever negates what Allah describes Himself with has also done Kufr (Disbelieved) There is nothing with what Allah describes Himself with nor his Prophet describes Allah with from likening Allah to his Creation (tashbeeh). Whosoever affirms for Allah what has reached Us from the Truthful Ayahs (verses) and Correct Hadeeth (Prophetic narrations) on the way that is befitting the Majesty of Allah while negating from Allah all defects indeed He has traveled the way of guidance.&quot; (Tafsir Ibn Kathir 7:54)

These words from Ibn Kathir were argued by Athari scholarship as proof of Ibn Kathir not being Ash&#x27;arite. According to Salafi Muslims, since Ibn Kathir does not use logical rationale to reject anthropomorphism, he believed the attributes of God cannot be likened to creatures, while simultaneously affirming the verses and hadith about God&#x27;s Attributes such as residence above His Throne and His Exaltation above all creatures. Salafis rebut Ash&#x27;arite claims as Formal fallacy regarding Ibn Kathir tafsir, and other claims such as four madhhab schools as supporting Ash&#x27;ari and Maturidites are fabrications. For this, they employ the reports from Ahmad ibn Hanbal who rejected the views of those who were allegedly deemed as proto Asharites and Maturidites, the Mutakallim, and deems them as not in Ahl as Sunnah teaching. According to Livnat Holtzman, historically the school of &quot;Ahl al-Hadith&quot; championed by none other than Ibn Kathir&#x27;s master, Ibn Taymiyyah, had successfully crushed the interrogation and accusation from Ash&#x27;arite rational (Kalam) argumentations during the 13th AD century. while modern scholars such as Marzuq at Tarifi, and Sa&#x27;id Musfir al-Qahtani further posited that Abu al-Hasan al-Ashʿari, the eponym of Asharite school, himself was not fond of his &quot;Asharite followers&quot; and pointed out on his book, al-ibāna, that Abu al Hasan was teaching the method similar to Ahmad ibn Hanbal, Ibn Taymiyyah, Ibn Kathir, and rejected the &quot;Ahl al Kalam&quot; and Maturidites such as Al-Razi.

In summary, Jon Hoover outlined that Ibn Kathir stance according to scholars were orthodox traditionists and rejected the view of Mutakallims, just like the view of Salafi Muslims and their predecessor Ahl al-Hadith school.

=== View of some Ash&#x27;arite scholars ===

In the modern times, Ibn Kathir&#x27;s creed have sometimes been raised as a subject of disagreement between the Ash&#x27;arites, successor of &quot;Ahl al-Ra&#x27;y&quot; rationalist school and the Salafis, theorized by Jon Hoover as successor of &quot;Ahl al-Hadith&quot; traditionist school. Some Ash&#x27;arite theologians have claimed Ibn Kathir as an Ash&#x27;ari, pointing out some of his beliefs and sayings reported from his works, and to the fact that:

* He belonged to the Shafi&#x27;i school of Islamic jurisprudence and was a professor of Hadith at the House of Hadith known as &quot;Dar al-Hadith al-Ashrafiyya&quot; which was exclusively established for those aligned to the Ash&#x27;ari school of creed, as mentioned by Taj al-Din al-Subki (d. 771/1370) in his &quot;Tabaqat al-Shafi`iyya al-Kubra&quot; (Comprehensive Biographical dictionary of Shafi&#x27;ites) that a condition to teach at the al-Ashrafiyya was to be Ash&#x27;ari in &#x27;aqida.
* Ibn Hajar al-&#x27;Asqalani (d. 852/1449) reported in his &quot;al-Durar al-Kaminah&quot; (The Hidden Pearls: on the Notables of the Eighth Islamic Century), that a dispute between Ibn Kathir and the son of Ibn al-Qayyim al-Jawziyya broke out over teaching position. It seems Ibn Kathir implied that the dislike for him is due to his Ash&#x27;ari roots, and once Ibn al-Qayyim&#x27;s son confronted him about this and said that even if Ibn Kathir swore to high heavens that he wasn&#x27;t upon the creed of Ibn Taymiyya, people wouldn&#x27;t believe him, because his sheikh (teacher) is Ibn Taymiyya.

==Works==
===Tafsir===

Ibn Kathir wrote a famous commentary on the Qur&#x27;an named &quot;Tafsīr al-Qurʾān al-ʿAẓīm&quot; better known as &quot;Tafsir Ibn Kathir&quot; which linked certain Hadith, or sayings of Muhammad, and sayings of the &quot;sahaba&quot; to verses of the Qur&#x27;an, in explanation and avoided the use of Isra&#x27;iliyyats. Many Sunni Muslims hold his commentary as the best after Tafsir al-Tabari and Tafsir al-Qurtubi and it is highly regarded especially among Salafi school of thought. Although Ibn Kathir claimed to rely on at-Tabari, he introduced new methods and differs in content, in attempt to clear Islam from that he evaluates as Isra&#x27;iliyyat. His suspicion on Isra&#x27;iliyyat possibly derived from Ibn Taimiyya&#x27;s influence, who discounted much of the exegetical tradition since then.

His &quot;Tafsir&quot; has gained widespread popularity in modern times, especially among Western Muslims, probably due to his straightforward approach, but also due to lack of alternative translations of traditional tafsirs. Ibn Kathir&#x27;s &quot;Tafsir&quot; work has played major impact in the contemporary movements of Islamic reform. Salafi reformer Jamal al-Din Qasimi&#x27;s &quot;Qurʾānic&quot; exegsis &quot;Maḥāsin al-taʾwīl&quot; was greatly influenced by Ibn Taymiyya and Ibn Kathīr, which is evident from its emphasis on &quot;ḥadīth&quot;, Scripturalist approaches, the rejection of &quot;Isrāʾīliyyāt&quot;, and a polemical attitudes against the &quot;Ahl al-raʾy&quot;. From the 1920s onwards, Wahhabi scholars also contributed immensely to popularisation of ḥadīth-oriented hermeneutics and exegeses, such as Ibn Kathīr&#x27;s and al-Baghawī’s &quot;Qurʾān&quot; commentaries and Ibn Taymiyya’s &quot;al-Muqaddima fī uṣūl al-tafsīr&quot;, through printing press. The Wahhābī promotion of Ibn Taymiyya’s and Ibn Kathīr’s works through print publishing during the early twentieth century emerged instrumental in making these two scholars popular in the contemporary period and imparted a robust impact on modern exegetical works.

==== In academic discourse ====
&quot;Tafsīr al-Qurʾān al-ʿAẓīm&quot; is controversial in western academic circles. Henri Laoust regards it primary as a philological work and &quot;very elementary&quot;. Norman Calder describes it as narrow-minded, dogmatic, and skeptical against the intellectual achievements of former exegetes. His concern is limited to rate the Quran by the corpus of Hadith and is the first, who flatly rates Jewish sources as unreliable, while simultaneously using them, just as prophetic hadith, selectively to support his prefabricated opinion. Otherwise, Jane Dammen McAuliffe regards this tafsir as &quot;deliberately and carefully selected, whose interpretation is unique to his own judgment to preserve, that he regards as best among his traditions.&quot;

<text>Double Fine Productions, Inc. is an American video game developer based in San Francisco, California. It is a first-party developer of Xbox Game Studios. Founded in July 2000 by Tim Schafer shortly after his departure from LucasArts, Double Fine&#x27;s first two games – &quot;Psychonauts&quot; and &quot;Brütal Legend&quot; – underperformed publishers&#x27; expectations despite critical praise. The future of the company was assured when Schafer turned to several in-house prototypes built during a two-week period known as &quot;Amnesia Fortnight&quot; to expand as smaller titles, all of which were licensed through publishers and met with commercial success. Schafer has since repeated these Amnesia Fortnights, using fan-voting mechanics, to help select and build smaller titles. Double Fine is also credited with driving interest in crowdfunding in video games, having been able to raise more than for the development of &quot;Broken Age&quot;, at the time one of the largest projects funded by Kickstarter, and more than US$3 million for the development of &quot;Psychonauts 2.&quot;

The company continued to build on its independent developer status and has promoted efforts to help other, smaller independent developers through its clout, including becoming a video game publisher for these titles. Double Fine has also been able to acquire rights to remaster some of the earlier LucasArts adventure games, including &quot;Grim Fandango&quot;, &quot;Day of the Tentacle&quot;, and &quot;Full Throttle&quot;. Microsoft purchased the studio in June 2019 after previously taking over &quot;Psychonauts 2&quot;&#x27;s publishing.

== History ==
Double Fine was founded by former LucasArts developer Tim Schafer, together with some colleagues from LucasArts, in July 2000. In the years prior, LucasArts had started to shift development away from adventure games into more action-oriented ones as part of the general trend in the gaming industry. Schafer, who had just finished producing the adventure game &quot;Grim Fandango&quot;, a title met with critical praise but was a commercial disappointment, saw others leaving LucasArts and was unsure of his own position there. He was approached by colleagues suggesting they launch their own studio to develop their own titles. Schafer departed LucasArts in January 2000, co-founding Double Fine later that year.

Schafer started Double Fine with programmers David Dixon and Jonathan Menzies in what was once a clog shop in San Francisco. After several months of working on the demo for what would become &quot;Psychonauts&quot;, a mixture of personnel from the &quot;Grim Fandango&quot; development team and other new employees were slowly added to begin production.

After the implementation of Amnesia Fortnights in 2011 as a means to find new titles to publish, the company is split into a number of teams with about 15 people each. Each team has the capabilities of fully developing a small game on its own, but for their larger titles, like &quot;Psychonauts 2&quot;, the company temporarily merges two or more of these teams, and with the option of unmerging the teams once the project is finished.

The company remains situated in San Francisco. The name &quot;Double Fine&quot; is a play on a sign on the Golden Gate Bridge that used to display &quot;double fine zone&quot; to warn motorists that fines on that stretch of road were double normal rates. Double Fine&#x27;s logo and mascot is called the Two-Headed Baby, frequently abbreviated 2HB, an abbreviation also used for Moai, an integrated development environment. The Double Fine website is also host to seven webcomics, which are created by members of Double Fine&#x27;s art team and are collectively referred to as the Double Fine Comics.

On June 9, 2019, during Microsoft&#x27;s press conference at E3 2019, it was announced that Double Fine had been acquired by the company and was becoming part of Xbox Game Studios. According to Schafer, through the acquisition, Double Fine will be able to retain its independent nature but will not have to struggle with finding publishers for its games, a problem it has had in its past. Schafer spoke to Microsoft&#x27;s Xbox Game Pass, a games subscription service for Microsoft Windows and Xbox users, as one favorable aspect of the acquisition. Schafer felt many of Double Fine&#x27;s games, particularly &quot;Psychonauts&quot; and its sequel, do not have an aesthetic that people would necessarily pay the full price for, but the subscription approach of Game Pass lowers that barrier and will potentially get more people to try the game. Thus, Schafer felt that being acquired by Microsoft would allow the studio to continue to develop experimental games and allow these projects greater exposure. A month ahead of the release of &quot;Psychonauts 2&quot;, in July 2021, Schafer stated he was happy with Microsoft&#x27;s handling of Double Fine; he called the acquisition a &quot;limited integration&quot; with Double Fine retaining all control on the creative elements while leaving the financial issues up to Microsoft to manage, and left the studio able to focus their creative skills on finishing the game without feeling any budgetary crunch. Double Fine and 2 Player Productions released &quot;PsychOdyssey&quot;, a 22 hour documentary on the making of &quot;Psychonauts 2&quot; in February 2023&quot;.&quot;

== Projects ==
Double Fine&#x27;s first completed project was &quot;Psychonauts&quot;, a multi-platform platform game following Raz (named after Double Fine&#x27;s animator Razmig Mavlian), a psychically-gifted boy who breaks into a summer camp for psychic children to try to become part of an elite group of psychic heroes called Psychonauts. Critically praised, it was released for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 2 and Xbox. Despite its acclaim, however, it did not sell well initially.

Double Fine&#x27;s second project was &quot;Brütal Legend&quot;, a hybrid real time strategy, action-adventure game following a heavy metal roadie named Eddie Riggs, whose name is derived from both Eddie the Head, the Iron Maiden mascot, and Derek Riggs, the artist who created the mascot. The story follows Eddie as he is transported to a fantasy world in which demons have enslaved humanity. Tim Schafer has credited the inspiration for the game to the lore, fantasy themes, and epic Norse mythology of heavy metal music found in both its lyrical content and its album art. &quot;Brütal Legend&quot; was published by Electronic Arts and was released in North America on October 13, 2009 for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, and later for Microsoft Windows.

=== Amnesia Fortnight ===
During the development of &quot;Brütal Legend&quot;, a publishing issue arose. Activision, having acquired the rights to the title through its merger with Vivendi Games, decided to drop it and forced Schafer to locate another publisher. During this period, in approximately 2007, Schafer attempted to boost the company&#x27;s morale by engaging the team in an &quot;Amnesia Fortnight&quot;. For a two-week period, the employees were split into four groups, told to forget their current work on &quot;Brütal Legend&quot; (hence the &quot;Amnesia&quot;), and tasked to develop a game prototype for review by the other groups. The four ideas were successfully made into playable prototypes. The four prototypes produced were &quot;Custodians Of The Clock&quot;, &quot;Happy Song&quot;, &quot;Love Puzzle&quot;, and &quot;Tiny Personal Ninja&quot;.

The process was repeated later near the end of &quot;Brütal Legend&quot;, providing an additional two prototypes. The prototypes produced were &quot;Costume Quest&quot; and &quot;Stacking&quot;.

Schafer credits the concept of the Amnesia Fortnights to film director Wong Kar-Wai. During the long, three-year filming of &quot;Ashes of Time&quot;, Wong had taken some of his actors and film crew to Hong Kong to shoot footage for fun, ultimately resulting in the films &quot;Chungking Express&quot; and &quot;Fallen Angels&quot;. Schafer noted these were some of the director&#x27;s more famous films. Schafer eventually signed a publishing deal with Electronic Arts for &quot;Brütal Legend.&quot;

These Amnesia Fortnight periods proved fortuitous, as Schafer considers these to have kept the company viable. Upon completion of &quot;Brütal Legend&quot;, Double Fine started work on its sequel but was told to stop development shortly after as Electronic Arts decided against publishing it. With no other publishing deals lined up at the time, Schafer turned back to the eight game ideas developed from Amnesia Fortnight, believing they could be developed further into short, complete games. Schafer also looked at the success of smaller focused games like &quot;Geometry Wars&quot; on the various download services, realizing the potential market for similar titles. Schafer and his team selected the best four, and began shopping the games to various publishers, and successfully worked publishing details with these. Two of these games, &quot;Costume Quest&quot; and &quot;Stacking&quot;, were picked up by THQ and released digitally on the Xbox Live and PlayStation Network storefronts. Both games were considered successful and THQ expressed interest in helping Double Fine produce similar titles. &quot;Iron Brigade&quot; was prototyped between 2008 and 2009 as &quot;Custodians Of The Clock&quot;, and was originally released as &quot;Trenched&quot; before the title was changed due to trademark issues. It was developed as an Xbox Live Arcade game in association with Microsoft Game Studios, and similarly received positive praise from journalists. A fourth game, &quot;Sesame Street: Once Upon a Monster&quot;, expanded from the &quot;Happy Song&quot; prototype, was published by Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment in association with the Sesame Workshop for the Xbox 360 using the Kinect controller. Though it initially was not a licensed title, Schafer and his team found it to be an ideal fit for their first licensed-property game. The four unused ideas may be used for a game in the future, according to Schafer, but believes some of them may be unsellable to a publisher.

The development groups for these games were headed by the former leads from &quot;Brütal Legend&quot;: lead animator Tasha Harris for &quot;Costume Quest&quot;, lead art director Lee Petty for &quot;Stacking&quot;, lead designer Brad Muir for &quot;Iron Brigade&quot;, and lead programmer Nathan Martz for &quot;Once Upon a Monster&quot;. This was to not only put these teams under people who had been in the industry for a long time, but as a means to help promote these leads. The remaining staff were split among the four teams, with some later swapping to make sure each team has appropriate resources when needed, such as artists and programmers. Double Fine did not have to lay off any of the staff during this time, and instead were able to hire Ron Gilbert, Schafer&#x27;s former collaborator at LucasArts, to work on the new titles, as well as a future title that Gilbert has envisioned. Schafer stated that though they could likely make another large game akin to &quot;Psychonauts&quot; or &quot;Brütal Legend&quot;, they would likely keep the smaller teams to continue to work on these smaller titles, due to the gained experience shared by the company.

In 2011, the prototyping process was repeated in Double Fine&#x27;s last private amnesia fortnight. The prototypes produced during this period were &quot;Middle Manager Of Justice&quot;, a superhero simulation game, &quot;Whispering Rock Psychic Summer Camp&quot;, a camp-building game based on &quot;Psychonauts&quot;, and &quot;Brazen&quot;, a Monster Hunter-style four-player online co-op game.
In November 2012, Double Fine, along with Humble Bundle, announced &quot;Amnesia Fortnight 2012&quot;, a charity drive based on the previous Amnesia Fortnight. During this, those that paid a minimum of had the opportunity to vote on 23 concept ideas. After the completion of the voting period, Double Fine developed the top five voted ideas into game prototypes that were available for those that purchased the bundle. The prototypes were (in order of receiving the most votes): &quot;Hack &#x27;n&#x27; Slash&quot;, a &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot;-inspired action-adventure, where players need to hack to solve puzzles, led by senior programmer Brandon Dillon, &quot;Spacebase DF-9&quot;, a sim game set in space, led by designer-programmer JP LeBreton, &quot;The White Birch&quot;, an ambient platform game (inspired by &quot;Ico&quot; and &quot;Journey&quot;), led by art director Andy Wood, &quot;Autonomous&quot;, a retro-futuristic sandbox robot game, led by art director Lee Petty, and &quot;Black Lake&quot;, a fairytale exploration game led by senior artist Levi Ryken. In addition, the purchaser received the initial prototypes of &quot;Costume Quest&quot;, &quot;Happy Song&quot; (what would become &quot;Once Upon a Monster&quot;), and &quot;Brazen&quot;, a Monster Hunter-style four-player online co-op homage to Ray Harryhausen, which was led by Brad Muir, who was also project lead of &quot;Iron Brigade&quot;. The development of the prototypes was documented by 2 Player Productions.

The Indie Fund announced at the Electronic Entertainment Expo 2013 that they provided funding for two titles from Double Fine. The first game created with Indie Fund backing was revealed on October 15, 2013 to be &quot;Spacebase DF-9&quot;, a fleshed out commercial version of one of the &quot;Amnesia Fortnight 2012&quot; prototypes. The game was released as an alpha version on Steam Early Access, and was developed with user feedback received during the early access release period. Development was canceled at version &quot;Alpha 6e&quot; with the next patch released as the finished game. This release did include source code that was released to the community. Largely due to backlash from the abrupt end of development, &quot;Spacebase DF-9&quot; has more negative user reviews on the Steam store than positive. The other game partially funded with Indie Fund backing was revealed on December 10, 2013 to be &quot;Hack &#x27;n&#x27; Slash&quot;, another full commercial version of an &quot;Amnesia Fortnight 2012&quot; prototype. &quot;Hack &#x27;n&#x27; Slash&quot; was released through Steam Early Access in the first half of 2014.

An additional prototype from the 2012 Amnesia Fortnight, &quot;Autonomous&quot;, was released as an expanded full free release for the Leap Motion controller on November 18, 2013.

In February 2014, Double Fine, and the Humble Bundle group began another charity drive titled &quot;Amnesia Fortnight 2014&quot;. During this drive, those that paid a minimum of had the opportunity to vote on 29 concept ideas. In addition, those that paid more than the average will get to vote on a concept idea for a prototype led by Pendleton Ward, the creator of &quot;Adventure Time&quot;. After the completion of the voting period, Double Fine developed the top voted ideas into game prototypes that were available for those that purchased the bundle. As with &quot;Amnesia Fortnight 2012&quot;, 2 Player Productions filmed the production of the prototype, which was available to people who purchased the bundle, as well as on a Blu-ray, along with the prototypes on a DVD, for those who paid a minimum of . The four pitches that were made into prototypes for &quot;Amnesia Fortnight 2014&quot; were &quot;Dear Leader&quot;, an emergent narrative game led by Anna Kipnis, &quot;Little Pink Best Buds&quot;, a game about little pink creatures who want to be your friend led by Pendleton Ward, &quot;Mnemonic&quot;, a surreal, first-person noir adventure led by Derek Brand, and &quot;Steed&quot;, a game set in a storybook land full of inept heroes led by John Bernhelm. One idea, &quot;Bad Golf 2&quot;, was not selected as a prototype, but a group of Double Fine fans have started working on developing the title themselves, with the blessing of its conceptor, Patrick Hackett and permission of Double Fine.

In April 2017, a third charitable public Amnesia Fortnight was jointly held by Double Fine and Humble Bundle. For &quot;Amnesia Fortnight 2017&quot;, two prototypes were chosen from the 25 prototype videos by means of the top public votes. These were &quot;The Gods Must Be Hungry&quot; and &quot;Darwin&#x27;s Dinner&quot;. A multi-player virtual reality party game prototype, &quot;I Have No Idea What I&#x27;m Doing&quot;, was chosen by Tim Schafer. Another, the four-player competitive game, &quot;Kiln&quot;, was chosen by the Double Fine team members that were working on Amnesia Fortnight. This was done to give the team a bit of control, rather than have all of the choices be as a result of online voting. In addition, three fan pitches for prototypes were included in &quot;Amnesia Fortnight 2017&quot;. All three fan pitches, &quot;Pongball&quot;, &quot;The Lost Dev Team&quot;, and &quot;Amnesia Adventure&quot;, were developed into prototypes. The top pick, &quot;Pongball&quot;, was included in the &quot;Amnesia Fortnight 2017&quot; prototype downloads, and the fans were mentored by Double Fine developers.

=== Dracogen funding ===
Double Fine has received financial investment from Steven Dengler&#x27;s investment company Dracogen. The investment started as a result of a Twitter conversation between Dengler and Schafer in March 2011, where Schafer commented that the cost of bringing Double Fine&#x27;s games to personal computers would be high. Dengler asked Schafer for a monetary value, though at the time Schafer believed Dengler was joking around and offered a value of around . As more formal conversations ensued, however, the company worked with Dengler to set an amount, signing an initial deal to bring &quot;Psychonauts&quot; to the macOS and to bring &quot;Costume Quest&quot; and &quot;Stacking&quot; to Microsoft Windows.

Following this initial agreement, a subsequent deal was made with Dracogen for three iOS mobile games, the first of which is &quot;Middle Manager of Justice&quot;. The game itself is based on another idea from the Amnesia Fortnights, a simulation game with RPG elements that involves managing teams of superheroes and then fighting as those heroes in battles. Dengler&#x27;s children helped to provide some of the drawings of superheroes for the game. &quot;Middle Manager of Justice&quot; was released for iOS in December 2012, and the Android version was released on August 14, 2013.

Dropchord, a motion-based rhythm puzzle game for macOS, Microsoft Windows, iOS and Android, was as well financed by Dracogen. It was a launch title for the Leap Motion Airspace app store when the Leap Motion controller was released on July 22, 2013.

As of 2012, Dengler has invested about one million dollars into Double Fine, which Schafer said has &quot;paid off for both sides&quot;. Schafer has said that Dengler&#x27;s funding has allowed the company to realize the ability of self-publishing, and believes they would be able to self-publish a triple-A title with Dracogen&#x27;s financial assistance.

=== Crowdfunding ===
In February 2012, Double Fine and 2 Player Productions announced a crowdfunding campaign through Kickstarter, initially codenamed &quot;Double Fine Adventure&quot;. It aimed to create a new adventure game featuring art by Double Fine&#x27;s in-house artist Nathan Stapley. The Kickstarter effort was started because the adventure genre has been perceived as niche and commercially risky. The project aimed to collect for the game&#x27;s development and for the filming of the game&#x27;s development by 2 Player to be released alongside the game. The project reached its funding goal in under nine hours of the month-long drive. Within 24 hours, &quot;Double Fine Adventure&quot; had raised more than a million dollars, becoming the most funded and most backed project ever on Kickstarter until it was surpassed by the Pebble watch in April 2012. The game was developed with Moai, and was released in two parts, Act 1 in early 2014 and Act 2 in April 2015. The game was ultimately named &quot;Broken Age&quot;.

On May 30, 2013, Double Fine started their second crowdfunding campaign through Kickstarter. The game, &quot;Massive Chalice&quot;, is a strategy video game for Microsoft Windows, macOS, and Linux, directed by Brad Muir.

=== Additional projects through publishers ===
Although Double Fine has experienced success through crowdfunding, the company has not renounced working with publishers. Their crowdfunding success has, however, granted them enough independence to be more selective about the publishers they work with and the types of publishing deals they are willing to accept. Talking to gaming news site Polygon, Schafer explained: &quot;We&#x27;ve changed our relationship with publishers. They used to be our sole source of income. Now that we&#x27;ve been self-publishing, we can kind of pick and choose who we work with and work with publishers that have similar goals that we have...[who] have the same kind of mission and believe in the same kind of things we believe in.&quot;

In February 2012, the casual video game, &quot;Double Fine Happy Action Theater&quot;, was published for the Xbox 360 Kinect through the Xbox Live Arcade by Microsoft Game Studios. The title is less a game and more an interactive toy, in which the Kinect is used to create augmented video on the players&#x27; screen, putting the players into scenarios such as walking through lava or playing in a giant ball pit. &quot;Happy Action Theater&quot; was the first game to be directed by Tim Schafer since &quot;Brütal Legend&quot; in 2009, and came about during &quot;Once Upon a Monster&quot;, finding that his young daughter had difficulty with the Kinect precision and aimed to make a game that required far less precision but was still enjoyable. Its sequel, &quot;Kinect Party&quot;, featuring even more augmented reality scenarios, was published by Microsoft Game Studios in December 2012.

On February 22, 2012, Double Fine filed a trademark for the name &quot;The Cave&quot;, later confirming that this was not related to the Double Fine Adventure project. In May 2012, it was revealed that &quot;The Cave&quot; was the title of an adventure and platform game developed by Ron Gilbert during his tenure at Double Fine. It was published by Sega in January 2013. Gilbert subsequently left the company on amiable terms to pursue other game development opportunities.

At PAX Prime 2013, it was revealed that Double Fine had a game in development that would be released as free downloadable content for &quot;The Playroom&quot;, the augmented reality mini-game compilation that utilizes the PlayStation Camera on PlayStation 4. Titled &quot;My Alien Buddy&quot;, it built on their experience on augmented reality that they gained while making &quot;Double Fine Happy Action Theater&quot; and &quot;Kinect Party&quot; for Microsoft. The alien buddy is a deformable toy with which the player can interact. &quot;My Alien Buddy&quot; was released on December 24, 2013.

On November 21, 2014, Double Fine announced that due to a publishing deal falling through, that it was forced to cancel an unannounced project and let 12 staff go.

As part of a deal with Nordic Games, who gained the publishing rights to &quot;Costume Quest&quot; and &quot;Stacking&quot; and the distribution rights to &quot;Psychonauts&quot; from the takeover of THQ after their bankruptcy, Double Fine took over all publishing rights, while Nordic Games retained and restarted distributing retail copies of all three titles for Microsoft Windows and macOS in early 2014.

=== Double Fine Presents ===
Double Fine announced in March 2014 that it would begin publishing indie games under the moniker Double Fine Presents. Using that program, Double Fine makes its publishing capabilities and offices available for other independent developers to help them finish their work by funding, publishing, and promoting it. The idea came about during the &quot;Amnesia Fortnight 2014&quot;, where local San Francisco independent developers were working alongside Double Fine in their studios during the two-week period, with the intent to help give them exposure through the production process as it was filmed by 2 Player Productions. The idea of Double Fine providing more long-term assistance to these indies arose during this event, forming the basis for this program. According to Double Fine&#x27;s COO Justin Bailey, the goal of this approach is to &quot;help indies build their own community and empower them with the knowledge and tools they need to succeed on their own&quot;, providing them assistance &quot;customized to what indies need without also creating a certain codependence&quot; that other publishing means require.

The first such game created in this fashion is &quot;Escape Goat 2&quot;, the sequel to &quot;Escape Goat&quot;, by MagicalTimeBean. This included a humorous video introducing both the game and Double Fine&#x27;s program, which was filmed during the week of the 2014 Game Developers Conference in March 2014. For the second title, &quot;Last Life&quot; by Rocket Science Amusements, Double Fine helped to prepare and present a Kickstarter campaign to help funding the final development of the title. The third title announced under this program was &quot;Mountain&quot; by David OReilly, a procedural terrarium that provides an ambient, minimalist, zen-like experience full of secrets and mysteries. In August 2014, Double Fine announced that a fourth game would be released under the program, the multiplayer beat &#x27;em up &quot;Gang Beasts&quot; by Boneloaf, which launched into Steam Early Access on August 29, 2014. The latest addition to the Double Fine Presents program is &quot;GNOG&quot; by , a puzzle-adventure released in 2016.

Following Microsoft&#x27;s acquisition of Double Fine in June 2019, the fate of the Double Fine Presents publishing label was unclear. Schafer stated in September 2019 that the fate of Double Fine Presents is unclear, but that while they will likely end up stop publishing, they will still likely engage with the community through the Day of the Devs events to support other independent developers. &quot;Ooblets&quot; changed to a self-publishing model following Double Fine&#x27;s acquisition, while another, &quot;Knights and Bikes&quot;, remained under the label. &quot;Gang Beasts&quot; also turned to self-publishing by June 2020, as it described that Double Fine&#x27;s publishing was &quot;winding down&quot;.

<doc id="455170" wikidata="Q2364118" url="?curid=455170" title="Confederate Arizona">
<text>The Arizona Territory, colloquially referred to as Confederate Arizona, was an organized incorporated territory of the Confederate States of America that existed from August 1, 1861, to May 26, 1865, when the Confederate States Army Trans-Mississippi Department, commanded by General Edmund Kirby Smith, surrendered at Shreveport, Louisiana. However, after the Battle of Glorieta Pass, the Confederates had to retreat from the territory, and by July 1862, effective Confederate control of the territory had ended.
Delegates to the secession convention had voted in March 1861 to secede from the New Mexico Territory and the Union, and seek to join the Confederacy. It consisted of the portion of the New Mexico Territory south of the 34th parallel, including parts of the modern states of New Mexico and Arizona. The capital was Mesilla, along the southern border. The breakaway region overlapped Arizona Territory, established by the Union government in February 1863.

Arizona was proclaimed a Confederate territory on August 1, 1861, after Colonel John R. Baylor&#x27;s victory at the Battle of Mesilla. His hold on the area was broken after Glorieta Pass (March 26–28, 1862), the defining battle of the New Mexico Campaign. In July 1862, the Confederate territorial government withdrew to El Paso, Texas. With the approach of Union troops, it relocated to San Antonio, where it remained for the duration of the civil war. The territory continued to be represented in the Confederate States Congress, and Confederate troops continued to fight under the Arizona banner until the war ended.

The political geography of the two Arizona Territories differed in that the Confederate Arizona was approximately the southern half of the historic New Mexico Territory, while the Union-defined Arizona Territory was approximately the western half of what had been New Mexico Territory, which became the basis for present-day Arizona.

== Background ==

Before the start of the war, the land of the current states of New Mexico and Arizona was part of the New Mexico Territory and the Gadsden Purchase, which ran parallel to William Walker&#x27;s Republics of &quot;Lower California&quot; and &quot;Sonora&quot;. As early as 1856, the territorial government in Santa Fe had raised concerns about being able to effectively govern the southern part of the territory. It was separated from the rest by the Jornada del Muerto, a difficult stretch of desert.

In February 1858, the New Mexico territorial legislature adopted a resolution in favor of the creation of the Arizona Territory. The border was to be defined along the 32nd meridian west from Washington. The legislature proposed that all the Indians of New Mexico would be removed to northern Arizona.

In April 1860, impatient for Congress to act, the territory called a convention and 31 delegates met in Tucson. In July 1860, the convention drafted a constitution for a &quot;Territory of Arizona&quot; to be organized out of the New Mexico Territory south of 34th parallel north. The convention elected Lewis S. Owings as the Territorial Governor, and elected a delegate to Congress.

Anti-slavery Representatives opposed creating a new territory, as they feared it had the potential to become a slave state. Many people in the area were pro-slavery, with business connections in southern states, from which some had migrated. In addition, all of this new territory lay below the old Missouri Compromise line of demarcation between slave and free states.

Since the proceedings of the Tucson convention were never ratified by the United States Congress, the Provisional Territory was not considered a legal entity. For a time it operated as a &quot;de facto&quot;, if not &quot;de jure&quot;, government for the intended Arizona Territory. Lewis S. Owings, Governor of the Provisional Territory, appointed James Henry Tevis to raise the first Territorial Militia. This comprised three companies of Arizona Rangers for the protection of the Territory from marauding Apaches and bandits. Two companies were raised in the Pinos Altos mining camp, and another at Mesilla.

== Secession ==

After the start of the American Civil War, support for the Confederacy was strong in the southern part of the New Mexico Territory. Some residents felt neglected by the United States government. They worried about the lack of sufficient troops to fight the Apache. These Native Americans were attacking White settlers, killing off ranchers and mining camps all over Traditional Arizona. This became open warfare following the February 3–9, 1861 Bascom Affair, that brought Cochise into the war. Arizona settlers were also disturbed by the closing of the Butterfield Overland Mail route and their stations in March 1861, which had connected the Arizona frontier colonies to the East and California.

In March 1861, the citizens of Mesilla called a secession convention to join the Confederacy. On March 16 the convention adopted a secession ordinance, citing the region&#x27;s common interests and geography with the Confederacy, their political sympathy with the Southern secession movement, their opposition to the &quot;sectional&quot; party, the &quot;Black&quot; Republicans, the need of frontier protection, and the loss of postal service routes under the United States government, as reasons for their separation. The ordinance proposed the question of secession to the western portions of the territory. On March 28 a second convention in present-day Tucson met and ratified the ordinance. The conventions subsequently established a provisional territorial government for the Confederate &quot;Territory of Arizona.&quot; Owings was elected again as provisional governor and Granville Henderson Oury was chosen as a delegate to petition for the territory&#x27;s admission into the Confederacy.

== Confederate units ==
* Arizona Militia (1860–1862)
** Arizona Guards (Pinos Altos mining camp)
** Arizona Rangers (Mesilla)
** Minute Men (Pinos Altos mining camp)
* Herbert&#x27;s Battalion, Arizona Cavalry (1862–1863)
** Capt. Thomas Helm&#x27;s Company (Arizona Guards)
** Capt. G. H. Oury&#x27;s Company (Arizona Rangers)
** Capt. R. L. Swope&#x27;s Company (Arizona Rangers)

== Major campaigns ==

Arizona was thought to be important to the role of the New Mexico Territory in the American Civil War primarily because it offered Confederate access to California. Consequently, it was the scene of several important battles in the war&#x27;s Trans-Mississippi Theater.

In July 1861 a force under Lieutenant-Colonel John R. Baylor arrived in El Paso, Texas across the border from Mesilla. With support from the secessionist residents of Mesilla, Baylor&#x27;s 2nd Texas Mounted Rifles entered the territory and took a position in the town on July 25. Union forces under Major Isaac Lynde at nearby Fort Fillmore prepared to attack Baylor. On July 25 the two armies met outside of town at the Battle of Mesilla in a brief engagement in which the Union troops were defeated.

Major Lynde then abandoned Fort Fillmore and began a march north to join the troops at Fort Craig under Colonel Edward R. S. Canby. However, his retreat came to a halt in severe heat and was overtaken by Baylor. Lynde surrendered his command without a shot fired at San Augustine Springs, in the Organ Mountains.

On August 1, 1861, the victorious Baylor proclaimed the existence of a Confederate Arizona Territory, which comprised the area defined in the Tucson convention the previous year. He appointed himself as permanent governor. Among his cabinet members was the Mesilla attorney Marcus H. MacWillie, who served as the territorial attorney general.

The next month, Baylor&#x27;s cavalrymen under Bethel Coopwood, marched north from Camp Robledo along the Rio Grande and surprised a Union force of New Mexican militia cavalry in a small engagement west of the Rio Grande at the village of Canada Alamosa, ending with another Confederate victory and the capture of 25 men of that unit including its commander. The next day after disarming and paroling the captured New Mexican enlisted men, Coopwood retired southward along the west bank of the river with the two captured Union officers and an NCO to a camp 15 miles to the north of Fort Thorn. There a Union column of Mounted Infantry sent to relieve the New Mexican militia force caught up with Coopwood, and skirmished for a few hours with the Confederates until their ammunition was depleted, forcing the Mounted Infantry to retire northward to their base at Fort Craig.

The proposal to organize the Confederate Territory of Arizona was passed by the Confederate Congress in early 1862 and proclaimed by President Jefferson Davis on February 14, 1862. Coincidentally, Arizona statehood was approved exactly fifty years later on February 14, 1912.
Efforts by the Confederacy to secure control of the region led to the New Mexico Campaign. Baylor sent Company A, Arizona Rangers to Tucson to protect the population from the Apache and delay the advance of Union troops from Fort Yuma.

In 1862 Baylor was ousted as governor of the territory by President Davis, and the Confederate loss at the Battle of Glorieta Pass forced Confederate retreat from the territory. On March 30, Union forces fought a smaller engagement against a detachment of Company A, Arizona Rangers, a Confederate force destroying supply depots along the California Column route of advance on the Gila River, 80 miles east of its base at Fort Yuma. This skirmish, known as the Battle of Stanwix Station, was the westernmost engagement of regular forces in the Civil War, and successfully delayed the advance of the California forces.

The following month a small picket troop of the Rangers north of Tucson fought with an equally small Union cavalry patrol from the California Column in the so-called Battle of Picacho Pass again delaying the advance of the California Column to Tucson.

By July 1862, Union forces of the California Column were approaching the territorial capital of Mesilla from the west but severe flooding of the Rio Grande barred their way and they had to divert north to Fort Thorn and the San Diego Crossing and wait two weeks for the water to fall enough for a crossing. With Canby advancing down the east bank of the Rio Grande and the loss of control of the countryside to New Mexican guerillas after the Second Battle of Mesilla the Confederates abandoned Mesilla and retreated south to Franklin, Texas.

In 1862 the California Column volunteers who fought at Stanwix Station and Picacho Pass fought at the Battle of Apache Pass against 500 Apaches. The battle is considered part of the American Civil War. There were also several engagements between Apaches and Confederates. The Battle of Dragoon Springs marks the only known Confederate combat deaths in the modern confines of Arizona. Other engagements include the Siege of Tubac, the Battle of Cookes Canyon, the Battle of the Florida Mountains, the Battle of Pinos Altos and a number of other smaller skirmishes and massacres.

The territorial government relocated to Franklin, then with Confederate military units retreated to San Antonio abandoning West Texas. For the rest of the war, California Column troops controlled all of Confederate Arizona, Franklin and Fort Quitman in West Texas. The government in exile remained in Texas for the duration of the war, although MacWillie continued to represent the territory in the First and 2nd Confederate States Congresses. Minor resistance in Arizona continued at the partisan level, and Confederate units under the banner of Arizona fought until the end of the war in May 1865.

<text>Pepsi One, corporately styled PEPSI ONE (so named because it contains one calorie per eight-fluid ounce [230 ml] serving), was a sugar-free cola, marketed by PepsiCo in the United States as an alternative to regular Pepsi and Diet Pepsi.

==History==
On June 30, 1998, the artificial sweetener acesulfame potassium (Ace-K) was approved for use by the Food and Drug Administration. PepsiCo responded within one hour, announcing the introduction of Pepsi One (which reached store shelves the following October). The original formulation was sweetened with aspartame and acesulfame potassium. This new variety was based upon an earlier product (sold in other countries) called Pepsi Max, but it featured a formula and flavor profile developed specifically for the U.S. market.

The launch of Pepsi One included an advertising campaign featuring the slogan &quot;just one calorie.&quot; Subsequently, comedian Tom Green appeared as the spokesperson in a series of television advertisements that began airing in April 1999.

Before 2012, Pepsi One was the last Pepsi variant to include the old logo used from 2003 to 2008, while all the other Pepsi variants had been using the current logo used since late 2008; the only other Pepsi product not using the current logo was Pepsi Throwback, which intentionally used retro packaging. However, Pepsi One&#x27;s logo was later modernized with the current logo to be in line with the other flavors.

On March 21, 2005, Pepsi-Cola North America announced that it would begin adding sucralose to a newly reformulated Pepsi ONE in order to create a full-flavor cola taste.

In January 2014, Consumer Reports magazine tested levels of the chemical 4-methylimidazole (4-MeI)a potential carcinogenin various beverages in the United States and found that Pepsi ONE was one of two drinks that contained the chemical in excess of 29 micrograms per can or bottle, with that being California Proposition 65&#x27;s daily allowed amount for foods without a warning label.

In mid-2015, after its sister product Diet Pepsi had changed to using sucralose and Ace-K as sweeteners instead of aspartame, Pepsi One was discontinued. PepsiCo wrote on its website that &quot;Pepsi ONE has been discontinued. We regularly evaluate our product portfolio to find efficiencies, and we have decided to remove Pepsi ONE from the marketplace. Pepsi ONE has very limited distribution and will be out of the marketplace by start of the year 2015, and in some markets product inventory has already been exhausted.&quot;

The caffeine content was 57.1 mg per serving ().

==Similarities==
From its introduction in 1964 and until 1991, Diet Pepsi was also marketed as having one calorie per serving.

==Racing==

On April 7, 2010, Toyota Speedway at Irwindale announced that Pepsi One would be the title sponsor of the track&#x27;s top division super late models. The series was called the NASCAR Pepsi One Super Late Models.

<doc id="455177" wikidata="Q2069959" url="?curid=455177" title="Anabatic wind">
<text>An anabatic wind, from the Greek &quot;&quot;, verbal of &quot;anabainein&quot; meaning &quot;moving upward&quot;, is a warm wind which blows up a steep slope or mountain side, driven by heating of the slope through insolation. It is also known as upslope flow. These winds typically occur during the daytime in calm sunny weather. A hill or mountain top will be radiatively warmed by the Sun which in turn heats the air just above it. Air at a similar altitude over an adjacent valley or plain does not get warmed so much because of the greater distance to the ground below it.

The air over the hill top is now warmer than the air at a similar altitude around it and will rise through convection. This creates a lower pressure region into which the air at the bottom of the slope flows, causing the wind. It is common for the air rising from the tops of large mountains to reach a height where it cools adiabatically to below its dew point and forms cumulus clouds. These can then produce rain or even thunderstorms.

Anabatic winds are particularly useful to soaring glider pilots who can use them to increase the aircraft&#x27;s altitude. Anabatic winds can be detrimental to the maximum downhill speed of cyclists. Conversely, katabatic winds are down-slope winds, frequently produced at night by the opposite effect, the air near to the ground losing heat to it faster than air at a similar altitude over adjacent low-lying land.

<text>Planarians (triclads) are free-living flatworms of the class Turbellaria, order Tricladida, which includes hundreds of species, found in freshwater, marine, and terrestrial habitats. Planarians are characterized by a three-branched intestine, including a single anterior and two posterior branches. Their body is populated by adult stem cells called neoblasts, which planarians use for regenerating missing body parts. Many species are able to regenerate any missing organ, which has made planarians a popular model in research of regeneration and stem cell biology. The genome sequences of several species are available, as are tools for molecular biology analysis.

The order Tricladida is split into three suborders, according to their phylogenetic relationships: Maricola, Cavernicola and Continenticola. Formerly, the Tricladida was split according to their habitat: Maricola (marine planarians); Paludicola (freshwater planarian); and Terricola (land planarians).

Planarians move by beating cilia on the ventral dermis, allowing them to glide along on a film of mucus. Some also can move by undulations of the whole body by the contractions of muscles built into the body membrane.

Triclads play an important role in watercourse ecosystems and are often very important as bio-indicators.

==Anatomy and physiology==
Planarians are bilaterian flatworms that lack a fluid-filled body cavity, and the space between their organ systems is filled with parenchyma. Planarians lack a circulatory system, and absorb oxygen through their body wall. They uptake food to their gut using a muscular pharynx, and nutrients diffuse to internal tissues. A three-branched intestine runs across almost the entire body, and includes a single anterior and two posterior branches. The planarian intestine is a blind sac, having no exit cavity, and therefore planarians uptake food and egest waste through the same orifice, located near the middle of the ventral body surface.

The excretory system is made of many tubes with many flame cells and excretory pores on them. Also, flame cells remove unwanted liquids from the body by passing them through ducts which lead to excretory pores, where waste is released on the dorsal surface of the planarian.

The triclads have an anterior end or head where sense organs, such as eyes and chemoreceptors, are usually found. Some species have auricles that protrude from the margins of the head. The auricles can contain chemical and mechanical sensory receptors.

The number of eyes in the triclads is variable depending on the species. While many species have two eyes (e.g. &quot;Dugesia&quot; or &quot;Microplana&quot;), others have many more distributed along the body (e.g. most Geoplaninae). Sometimes, those species with two eyes may present smaller accessory or supernumerary eyes. The subterranean triclads are often eyeless or blind.

The body of the triclads is covered by a ciliated epidermis that contains rhabdites. Between the epidermis and the gastrodermis there is a parenchymatous tissue or mesenchyme.

===Nervous system===

The planarian nervous systems consists of a bilobed shaped cerebral ganglion that is referred to as the planarian brain. Longitudinal ventral nerve chords extend from the brain to the tail. Transverse nerves, commissure, connect the ventral nerve chords forming ladder-like nerve system. The brain has been shown to exhibit spontaneous electrophysiological oscillations, similar to the electroencephalographic (EEG) activity of other animals.

The planarian has a soft, flat, wedge-shaped body that may be black, brown, blue, gray, or white. The blunt, triangular head has two ocelli (eyespots), pigmented areas that are sensitive to light. There are two auricles (earlike projections) at the base of the head, which are sensitive to touch and the presence of certain chemicals. The mouth is located in the middle of the underside of the body, which is covered with hairlike projections (cilia). There are no circulatory or respiratory systems; oxygen enters and carbon dioxide leaves the planarian&#x27;s body by diffusing through the body wall.

===Reproduction===

Triclads reproduce sexually and asexually, and different species may be able to reproduce by one or both modes. Planarians are hermaphrodites. In sexual reproduction, the mating generally involves mutual insemination.

Thus, one of their gametes will combine with the gamete of another planarian. Each planarian transports its secretion to the other planarian, giving and receiving sperm. Eggs develop inside the body and are shed in capsules. Weeks later, the eggs hatch and grow into adults. In asexual reproduction, the planarian fissions and each fragment regenerates its missing tissues, generating complete anatomy and restoring functions. Asexual reproduction, similar to regeneration following injury, requires neoblasts, adult stem cells, which proliferate and produce differentiated cells. Some researchers claim that the products derived from bisecting a planarian are similar to the products of planarian asexual reproduction; however, debates about the nature of asexual reproduction in planarians and its effect on the population are ongoing. Some species of planarian are exclusively asexual, whereas some can reproduce both sexually and asexually. In most of the cases the sexual reproduction involve two individuals; auto fecundation has been rarely reported (e.g. in &quot;Cura foremanii&quot;).

=== Neoblasts ===

Neoblasts are abundant adult stem cells that are found in the planarian parenchyma across the planarian body. They are small and round cells, 5 to 10 μm, and characterized by a large nucleus, which is surrounded by little cytoplasm. Neoblasts are required for regenerating missing tissues and organs, and they continuously replenish tissues by producing new cells. Neoblasts can self-renew and generate progenitors for different cell types. In contrast to adult vertebrate stem cells (e.g., hematopoietic stem cell), neoblasts are pluripotent (i.e., producing all somatic cell types). Moreover, they give rise to differentiating, post-mitotic, cells directly, and not by producing rapidly-dividing transit amplifying cells. Consequently, neoblasts divide frequently, and apparently lack a large sub-population of dormant or slow-cycling cells.

== As a model system in biological and biomedical research ==
The life history of planarians make them a model system for investigating a number of biological processes, many of which may have implications for human health and disease. Advances in molecular genetic technologies has made the study of gene function possible in these animals and scientists are studying them worldwide. Like other invertebrate model organisms, for example &quot;C. elegans&quot; and &quot;D. melanogaster&quot;, the relative simplicity of planarians facilitates experimental study.

Planarians have a number of cell types, tissues and simple organs that are homologous to our own cells, tissues and organs. However, regeneration has attracted the most attention. Thomas Hunt Morgan was responsible for some of the first systematic studies (that still underpin modern research) before the advent of molecular biology as a discipline.

Planarians are also an emerging model organism for aging research. These animals have an apparently limitless regenerative capacity, and asexual &quot;Schmidtea mediterranea&quot; has been shown to maintain its telomere length through regeneration.

Live planarians are increasingly used in toxicological research due to their regenerative capabilities, simple anatomy, and sensitivity to environmental changes. Their ability to regenerate lost body parts provides a unique model to study the effects of chemical exposures on cellular processes, while their rapid response to toxins makes them an efficient tool for screening potential environmental and pharmaceutical hazards. An example of this application is a fluorescence-based skin irritability assay, where planaria are exposed to various chemicals, and fluorescence dye is used to evaluate their epithelial damage in response to irritation, providing an effective screening method.

== Regeneration ==
Planarian regeneration combines new tissue production with reorganization to the existing anatomy, morphallaxis. The rate of tissue regrowth varies between species, but in frequently used lab species, functional regenerated tissues are available already 7–10 days following tissue amputation. Regeneration starts following an injury that require the growth of a new tissue. Neoblasts localized near the injury site proliferate to generate a structure of differentiating cells called blastema. Neoblasts are required for new cell production, and they therefore provide the cellular basis for planarian regeneration. Cell signaling mechanisms provide positional information that regulates the cell types and tissues that are produced from the neoblasts in regeneration. Many signaling molecules that provide positional information to neoblasts, in regeneration and homeostasis, are expressed in muscle cells. Following injury, muscle cells throughout the body can alter the expression of genes that encode molecules that provide positional information. Therefore, the activities of neoblasts and muscle cells following injuries are essential for successful regeneration.

Historically, planarians have been considered &quot;immortal under the edge of a knife.&quot; Very small pieces of the planarian, estimated to be as little as 1/279th of the organism it is cut from, can regenerate back into a complete organism over the course of a few weeks. New tissues can grow due to pluripotent stem cells that have the ability to create all the various cell types. These adult stem cells are called neoblasts, and comprise 20% or more of the cells in the adult animal. They are the only proliferating cells in the worm, and they differentiate into progeny that replace older cells. In addition, existing tissue is remodeled to restore symmetry and proportion of the new planaria that forms from a piece of a cut up organism.

The organism itself does not have to be completely cut into separate pieces for the regeneration phenomenon to be witnessed. In fact, if the head of a planarian is cut in half down its center, and each side retained on the organism, it is possible for the planarian to regenerate two heads and continue to live. Researchers, including those from Tufts University in the U.S., sought to determine how microgravity and micro-geomagnetic fields would affect the growth and regeneration of planarian flatworms, &quot;Dugesia japonica&quot;. They discovered that one of the amputated fragments sent to space regenerated into a double-headed worm. The majority of such amputated worms (95%) did not do so, however. An amputated worm regenerated into a double-head creature after spending five weeks aboard the International Space Station (ISS) – though regeneration of amputated worms as double-headed heteromorphosis is not a rare phenomenon unique to a microgravity environment. In contrast, two-headed planaria regenerates can be induced by exposing amputated fragments to electrical fields. Such exposure with opposite polarity can induce a planarian with 2 tails. Two-headed planaria regenerates can be induced by treating amputated fragments with pharmacological agents that alter levels of calcium, cyclic AMP, and protein kinase C activity in cells, as well as by genetic expression blocks (interference RNA) to the canonical Wnt/β-Catenin signalling pathway.

==Biochemical memory experiments==

In 1955, Robert Thompson and James V. McConnell conditioned planarian flatworms by pairing a bright light with an electric shock. After repeating this several times they took away the electric shock, and only exposed them to the bright light. The flatworms would react to the bright light as if they had been shocked. Thompson and McConnell found that if they cut the worm in two, and allowed both worms to regenerate each half would develop the light-shock reaction. In 1963, McConnell repeated the experiment, but instead of cutting the trained flatworms in two he ground them into small pieces and fed them to other flatworms. He reported that the flatworms learned to associate the bright light with a shock much faster than flatworms who had not been fed trained worms.

This experiment intended to test whether memory could be transferred chemically. The experiment was repeated with mice, fish, and rats, but it always failed to produce the same results. The perceived explanation was that rather than memory being transferred to the other animals, it was the hormones in the ingested ground animals that changed the behavior. McConnell believed that this was evidence of a chemical basis for memory, which he identified as memory RNA. McConnell&#x27;s results are now attributed to observer bias. No blinded experiment has ever reproduced his results of planarians scrunching when exposed to light. Subsequent explanations of this scrunching behaviour associated with cannibalism of trained planarian worms were that the untrained flatworms were only following tracks left on the dirty glassware rather than absorbing the memory of their fodder.

In 2012, Tal Shomrat and Michael Levin have shown that planarians exhibit evidence of long-term memory retrieval after regenerating a new head.

== Planarian species used for research and education ==
Several planarian species are commonly used for biological research. Popular experimental species are &quot;Schmidtea mediterranea&quot;, &quot;Schmidtea polychroa,&quot; and &quot;Dugesia japonica,&quot; which in addition to excellent regenerative abilities, are easy to culture in the lab. In recent decades, &quot;S. mediterranea&quot; has emerged as the species of choice for modern molecular biology research, due to its diploid chromosomes and the availability of both asexual and sexual strains.

The most frequently used planarian in high school and first-year college laboratories is the brownish &quot;Girardia tigrina&quot;. Other common species used are the blackish &quot;Planaria maculata&quot; and &quot;Girardia dorotocephala&quot;.

<doc id="455190" wikidata="Q266751" url="?curid=455190" title="Bertrada of Laon">
<text>Bertrada of Laon (born between 710 and 727 – 12 July 783), also known as Bertrada the Younger or Bertha Broadfoot (, i.e. the queen with the goose-foot), was a Frankish queen. She was the wife of Pepin the Short and the mother of Charlemagne, Carloman and Gisela, plus five other children.

==Nickname==
Bertrada&#x27;s nickname &quot;Bertha Broadfoot&quot; dates back to the 13th century, when it was used in Adenes Le Roi&#x27;s trouvère &quot;Li rouman de Berte aus grands piés&quot;. The exact reason that Bertrada was given this nickname is unclear. It is possible Bertha suffered from bunions, her feet became misshapen and spread because of them. It is also possible but unlikely that Bertrada was born with a clubfoot, although Adenes does not mention this in his poem.

==Biography==

===Early life and ancestry===
Bertrada was born sometime between 710 and 727 in Laon, in today&#x27;s Aisne, France, to Count Charibert of Laon. Charibert&#x27;s father might have been related to Hugobertides. Charibert&#x27;s mother was Bertrada of Prüm, who founded Prüm Abbey along with Charibert.

===Marriage and children===
Bertrada married Pepin the Short, the son of Charles Martel, the Frankish &quot;Mayor of the Palace&quot;, in around 740 or 741. However, Pepin and Bertrada were too closely related for their marriage to be legal at that time; the union was not canonically sanctioned until 749, after the birth of Charlemagne.

According to French historian Léon Levillain, Bertrada was Pepin&#x27;s first and only wife. Other sources suggest that Pepin had previously married a &quot;Leutberga&quot; or &quot;Leutbergie&quot;, with whom Pepin would have had five children.

Bertrada and Pepin are known to have had eight children: at least three sons and at least four daughters. Of these, Charlemagne (c. 742 – 814), Carloman (751–771) and Gisela (757–811) survived to adulthood. Pepin, born in 756, died young in 762. Bertrada and Pepin also had Berthe, Adelaide, and Rothaide. Gisela became a nun at Chelles Abbey.

===Queen of the Franks===
In 751, Pepin and Bertrada became King and Queen of the Franks, following Pepin&#x27;s successful coup against the Frankish Merovingian monarchs. Pepin was crowned in June 754, and Bertrada, Charlemagne, and Carloman were blessed by Pope Stephen II.

After Pepin&#x27;s death in 768, Bertrada lost her title as Queen of the Franks. Charlemagne and Carloman inherited the two halves of Pepin&#x27;s kingdom. Bertrada stayed at the court and often tried to stop arguments between the two brothers. Some historians credit Bertrada&#x27;s support for her elder son Charlemagne over her younger son Carloman, and her diplomatic skills, for Charlemagne&#x27;s early success. Although her influence over Charlemagne may have diminished in time, she lived at his court, and, according to Einhard, their relationship was excellent. Bertrada recommended that Charlemagne set aside his legal wife, Himiltrude, and marry Desiderata, a daughter of the Lombard king Desiderius, but Charlemagne soon divorced Desiderata. Einhard claims this was the only episode that ever strained relations between mother and son.

===Later life and death===
Bertrada retired from the court after Carloman&#x27;s death in 771 to live in Choisy-au-Bac, where Charlemagne had set aside a royal house for her. Choisy-au-Bac was favorable because of its history of being the home and burial place of several Merovingian kings.

Bertrada died on 12 July 783 in Choisy-au-Bac. Charlemagne buried her in the Basilica of St Denis near Pepin.

==In literature==
Bertrada inspired Adenes Le Roi to write the poem &quot;Li rouman de Berte aus grands piés&quot; in 1270. Adenes referred to her as &quot;Bertha Broadfoot&quot;, the earliest known usage of that nickname.

Bertrada is also referred to as &quot;Bertha Broadfoot&quot; () in François Villon&#x27;s 15th-century poem &quot;Ballade des dames du temps jadis&quot;.

Bertrada was adapted into the character Berthe in Stephen Schwartz&#x27;s stage musical &quot;Pippin&quot;

<doc id="455199" wikidata="Q7995620" url="?curid=455199" title="White guilt">
<text>White guilt is a belief that white people bear a collective responsibility for the harm which has resulted from historical or current racist treatment of people belonging to other ethnic groups, as for example in the context of the Atlantic slave trade, European colonialism, and the genocide of indigenous peoples.

In certain regions of the Western world, it can be called white settler guilt, white colonial guilt, and other variations, which refer to the guilt more pointedly in relation to European settlement and colonization. The concept of white guilt has examples both historically and currently in the United States, Australia and to a lesser extent in Canada, The Netherlands, South Africa, France, and the United Kingdom. The feeling of white guilt has been described by psychologists such as Lisa Spanierman and Mary Heppner as one of the psychosocial consequences of racism for white individuals along with empathy for victims of racism and fear of non-white people.

==History==

===Early usage===
The phrase &quot;white guilt&quot; was first levelled as an accusation, as when James Baldwin wrote that &quot;No curtain under heaven is heavier than that curtain of guilt and lies behind which white Americans hide&quot; in his essay &quot;The White Man&#x27;s Guilt&quot;, first published in 1965. Martin Luther King similarly maintained that racism was a collective national shame, rather than a personal one, saying in 1965 that &quot;Racial injustice is still the Negro&#x27;s burden and America&#x27;s shame.&quot; Or, as he put it in 1968, &quot;Everyone must share in the guilt as individuals and as institutions. The government must certainly share the guilt; individuals must share the guilt; even the church must share the guilt.&quot;

The phrase has come to be used in a psychological sense, to designate feelings of guilt held by white people. Judith Katz, the author of the 1978 publication &quot;White Awareness: Handbook for Anti-Racism Training&quot;, is critical of what she calls self-indulgent white guilt fixations. Her concerns about white guilt led her to move from black-white group encounters to all-white groups in her anti-racism training. She also avoided using non-white people to re-educate white people, she said, because she found this led white people to focus on getting acceptance and forgiveness rather than changing their own actions or beliefs.

A report in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; from 1978 describes the exploitation of white guilt by white con artists making a pretence of representing minority-oriented companies or publications: &quot;Telephone and mail solicitors, trading on &#x27;white guilt&#x27; and on government pressure to advertise in minority-oriented publications, are inducing thousands of businessmen to buy ads in phony publications.&quot; The companies selling the advertising used white actors putting on Black or Mexican accents to sell advertising space in publications that were never circulated to the public.

===Academic research===
In 1999, academic research conducted at the University of Pennsylvania examined the extent of societal feeling of white guilt, possible guilt-based antecedents, and white guilt&#x27;s relationship to attitudes towards affirmative action. The four studies revealed that &quot;Even though mean White guilt tended to be low, with the mean being just below the midpoint of the scale, the range and variability confirms the existence of feelings of White guilt for some&quot;. The findings also showed that white guilt was directly linked to &quot;more negative personal evaluations&quot; of white people generally, and the extent of an individual&#x27;s feelings of white guilt independently predicted attitudes towards white privilege, racial discrimination and affirmative action.

2003 research at the University of California, Santa Cruz, in its first study, replicated the link between white guilt and strength of belief in white privilege. The second study revealed that white guilt &quot;resulted from seeing European Americans as perpetrators of racial discrimination&quot;, and was also predictive of support for compensatory efforts for African Americans.

One academic paper suggests that in France, white guilt may be a common feature of management of race relations – in contrast to other European countries.

A 2019 review of two studies finds that &quot;among social liberals, learning about White privilege reduces sympathy, increases blame, and decreases external attributions for White people struggling with poverty.&quot;

==Regions==

===In the United States===
American civil rights activist Bayard Rustin wrote that reparations for slavery would be an exploitation of white guilt and damage the &quot;integrity of blacks&quot;. In 2006, then-Senator Barack Obama wrote in his book &quot;The Audacity of Hope&quot; that &quot;rightly or wrongly, white guilt has largely exhausted itself in America&quot;. His view on the subject was based on an interaction in the US Senate, where he witnessed a white legislator complain about being made to &quot;feel more white&quot; when a black colleague discussed systemic racism with them.

Shelby Steele, a conservative black political writer, criticized the concept in his 2006 book &quot;White Guilt: How Blacks and Whites Together Destroyed the Promise of the Civil Rights Era.&quot; Steele accused some black people of exploiting white guilt by posing as victims of white racism. Steele called this a disingenuous bid for political power by using white guilt to claim exclusive moral authority.

George F. Will, a conservative American political columnist, wrote: &quot;[White guilt is] a form of self-congratulation, where whites initiate &#x27;compassionate policies&#x27; toward people of color, to showcase their innocence to racism.&quot;

In 2015, when it came to light American civil rights activist Rachel Dolezal had been posing as African American, &quot;Washington Post&quot; journalist Krissah Thompson described her as &quot;an archetype of white guilt played to its end&quot;. Thompson discussed the issue with psychologist Derald Wing Sue, an expert on racial identity, who suggested that Dolezal had become so fascinated by racism and racial justice issues she &quot;over-identified&quot; with black people. In 2016, the school district of Henrico County, Virginia ceased future use of an educational video, &quot;Structural Discrimination: The Unequal Opportunity Race&quot;, which visualized white privilege and structural racism. Parents complained, calling it a white guilt video, which led to a ban by the county&#x27;s superintendent.

Since 2016, white liberals rate non-white groups more positively than they do whites. Every other racial group feels more positive about their own race than they do about other races, according to polling carried out by American National Election Studies in 2018. This has been attributed to a desire to separate themselves from the racist-appearing postures of then-president Donald Trump and some of his followers.

In October 2018, &quot;The Economist&quot; proposed that an increase in Americans claiming Native American ancestry, often incorrectly, may be explained by attempts to &quot;absolve them of collective European guilt for the genocide of indigenous people&quot;. In 2019, it was alleged that liberal white Americans were being influenced by white guilt, changing patterns of political and social behaviour to be more racially inclusive after the election of Donald Trump. This included the methods by which Democratic nominees were being considered for the 2020 presidential election.

In October 2019, students at a middle school in Massachusetts raised money for the Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe, after they learned about the mistreatment of the tribe&#x27;s ancestors by European colonists. The director of the school said it had &quot;left all our students with this sense of European guilt, or something&quot;, and one student remarked &quot;If we don&#x27;t try to repair what our ancestors did, the tribes will die off&quot;.

===In Australia===
Author Sally Morgan 1987&#x27;s book &quot;My Place&quot;, which explores Aboriginal identity, has come under critique for providing European Australians with a narrative of colonization in Australia which, critics argue, considerably minimizes white settler guilt. Marcia Langton has described the book as a kind of an unearned clearance for European guilt: &quot;The book is a catharsis. It gives release and relief, not so much to Aboriginal people oppressed by psychotic racism, as to the whites who wittingly and unwittingly participated in it&quot;.

===In New Zealand===
In New Zealand, the legacy of the colonisation of New Zealand by European settlers has created a localized sense of white guilt in relation to the resulting damage to pre-existing Māori culture and mistreatment of the indigenous Māori people. Then opposition leader Bill English gave a speech in 2002 in which he rejected the &quot;cringing guilt&quot; said to be felt amongst the Pākehā as a result of the colonisation of &quot;Aotearoa&quot; by their ancestors. English&#x27;s speech came in response to the government&#x27;s Race Relations Commissioner, who compared the impact of the colonisation of New Zealand to the destruction of the Bamiyan Buddhas by the Taliban.

Academic Elizabeth Rata has proposed that &quot;without the mirror image of unexpiated guilt, a necessary process in the recognition and validation of a shared reality, Pākehā guilt moved, not onto the next stage of externalised shame, but into an internal and enclosed narcissism&quot;. In her analysis, she suggests that the Waitangi Tribunal has been a missed opportunity to reconcile white guilt in New Zealand.

==Critical opinions==
Commentator Sunny Hundal, writing for &quot;The Guardian&quot;, stated it is &quot;reductionist&quot; to assign political opinions to a collective guilt such as &quot;white guilt&quot; and few people on the left actually hold the views being ascribed to them by the conservative writers who expound on the concept of &quot;white guilt&quot; and its implications. Hundal concludes: &quot;Not much annoys me more than the stereotype that to be liberal is to be full of guilt. To be socially liberal, in my view, is to be more mindful of &quot;compassion&quot; and &quot;empathy&quot; for others…to label that simply as guilt is just...insulting.&quot;

In 2015, Gary Younge explored white guilt&#x27;s impotence in society, writing: &quot;It won&#x27;t close the pay gap, the unemployment gap, the wealth gap or the discrepancy between black and white incarceration. It won&#x27;t bring back Walter Scott, Trayvon Martin or Brandon Moore.&quot; Coleman Hughes has suggested that white guilt causes the misdirection of anti-racist efforts, writing that &quot;where white guilt is endemic, demands to redress racism will be strongest, regardless of how much racism actually exists&quot;.

<text>A spaceplane is a vehicle that can fly and glide as an aircraft in Earth&#x27;s atmosphere and function as a spacecraft in outer space. To do so, spaceplanes must incorporate features of both aircraft and spacecraft. Orbital spaceplanes tend to be more similar to conventional spacecraft, while sub-orbital spaceplanes tend to be more similar to fixed-wing aircraft. All spaceplanes as of 2024 have been rocket-powered for takeoff and climb, but have then landed as unpowered gliders.

Four examples of spaceplanes have successfully launched to orbit, reentered Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, and landed: the U.S. Space Shuttle, Russian Buran, U.S. X-37, and the Chinese Shenlong. Another, Dream Chaser, is under development in the U.S. As of 2024 all past and current orbital spaceplanes launch vertically; some are carried as a payload in a conventional fairing, while the Space Shuttle used its own engines with the assistance of boosters and an external tank. Orbital spaceflight takes place at high velocities, with orbital kinetic energies typically greater than suborbital trajectories. This kinetic energy is shed as heat during re-entry. Many more spaceplanes have been proposed.

At least two suborbital rocket-powered aircraft have been launched horizontally into sub-orbital spaceflight from an airborne carrier aircraft before rocketing beyond the Kármán line: the X-15 and SpaceShipOne.

== Operational principles ==

Spaceplanes must operate in space, like traditional spacecraft, but also must be capable of atmospheric flight, like an aircraft. 

Spaceplanes do not necessarily have to fly by their own propulsion, but instead often glide with their inertia while using aerodynamic surfaces to maneuver in the atmosphere during descent and landing. The U.S. Space Shuttle for instance, could not fly under its own propulsion but used its momentum after de-orbit to glide to the runway destination.

These requirements drive up the complexity, risk, dry mass, and cost of spaceplane designs. The following sections will draw heavily on the US Space Shuttle as the biggest, most complex, most expensive, most flown, and only crewed orbital spaceplane, but other designs have been successfully flown.

=== Launch to space ===
The flight trajectory required to reach orbit results in significant aerodynamic loads, vibrations, and accelerations, all of which have to be withstood by the vehicle structure.

If the launch vehicle suffers a catastrophic malfunction, a conventional capsule spacecraft is propelled to safety by a launch escape system. The Space Shuttle was far too big and heavy for this approach to be viable, resulting in a number of abort modes that may or may not have been survivable. The Challenger disaster demonstrated a lack of survivability on ascent.

=== Space environment ===
Once on-orbit, a spaceplane must be supplied with power by solar panels and batteries or fuel cells, maneuvered in space, kept in thermal equilibrium, oriented, and communicated with. On-orbit thermal and radiological environments impose additional stresses. This is in addition to accomplishing the task the spaceplane was launched to complete, such as satellite deployment or science experiments.

The Space Shuttle used dedicated engines to accomplish orbital maneuvers. These engines used toxic hypergolic propellants that required special handling precautions. Various gases, including helium for pressurization and nitrogen for life support, were stored under high pressure in composite overwrapped pressure vessels.

===Atmospheric reentry===
Orbital spacecraft reentering the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere must shed significant velocity, resulting in extreme heating. For example, the Space Shuttle thermal protection system (TPS) protects the orbiter&#x27;s interior structure from surface temperatures that reach as high as , well above the melting point of steel. Suborbital spaceplanes fly lower energy trajectories that do not put as much stress on the spacecraft thermal protection system.

The Space Shuttle &quot;Columbia&quot; disaster was the direct result of a TPS failure.

=== Aerodynamic flight and horizontal landing ===
Aerodynamic control surfaces must be actuated. Landing gear must be included at the cost of additional mass.

=== Air-breathing orbital spaceplane concept ===
An air-breathing orbital spaceplane would have to fly what is known as a &#x27;depressed trajectory,&#x27; which places the vehicle in the high-altitude hypersonic flight regime of the atmosphere for an extended period of time. This environment induces high dynamic pressure, high temperature, and high heat flow loads particularly upon the leading edge surfaces of the spaceplane, requiring exterior surfaces to be constructed from advanced materials and/or use active cooling. Skylon was a proposed spaceplane that would have used air-breathing engines.

Two piloted suborbital rocket-powered aircraft have reached space: the North American X-15 and SpaceShipOne; a third, SpaceShipTwo, has crossed the US-defined boundary of space but has &quot;not&quot; reached the higher internationally recognised boundary. None of these crafts were capable of entering orbit, and all were first lifted to high altitude by a carrier aircraft.

On 7 December 2009, Scaled Composites and Virgin Galactic unveiled SpaceShipTwo, along with its atmospheric mothership &quot;Eve&quot;. On 13 December 2018, SpaceShipTwo VSS Unity successfully crossed the US-defined boundary of space (although it has not reached space using the internationally recognised definition of this boundary, which lies at a higher altitude than the US boundary). SpaceShipThree is the new spacecraft of Virgin Galactic, launched on 30 March 2021. It is also known as VSS Imagine. On 11 July 2021 VSS Unity completed its first fully crewed mission including Sir Richard Branson.

The Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-105 was an atmospheric prototype of an intended orbital spaceplane, with the suborbital BOR-4 subscale heat shield test vehicle successfully reentering the atmosphere before program cancellation.
HYFLEX was a miniaturized suborbital demonstrator launched in 1996, flying to 110 km altitude, achieving hypersonic flight, and successfully reentering the atmosphere.

== History of unflown concepts ==

Various types of spaceplanes have been suggested since the early twentieth century. Notable early designs include a spaceplane equipped with wings made of combustible alloys that it would burn during its ascent, and the Silbervogel bomber concept. World War II Germany and the postwar US considered winged versions of the V-2 rocket, and in the 1950s and &#x27;60s winged rocket designs inspired science fiction artists, filmmakers, and the general public.

=== United States (1950s–2010s) ===
The U.S. Air Force invested some effort in a paper study of a variety of spaceplane projects under their Aerospaceplane efforts of the late 1950s, but later reduced the scope of the project. The result, the Boeing X-20 Dyna-Soar, was to have been the first orbital spaceplane, but was canceled in the early 1960s in lieu of NASA&#x27;s Project Gemini and the U.S. Air Force&#x27;s crewed spaceflight program.

In 1961, NASA originally planned to have the Gemini spacecraft land on a runway with a Rogallo wing airfoil, rather than an ocean landing under parachutes. The test vehicle became known as the Paraglider Research Vehicle. Development work on both parachutes and the paraglider began in 1963. By December 1963, the parachute was ready to undergo full-scale deployment testing, while the paraglider had run into technical difficulties. Though attempts to revive the paraglider concept persisted within NASA and North American Aviation, in 1964 development was definitively discontinued due to the expense of overcoming the technical hurdles.
The Space Shuttle underwent many variations during its conceptual design phase. Some early concepts are illustrated.
The Rockwell X-30 National Aero-Space Plane (NASP), begun in the 1980s, was an attempt to build a scramjet vehicle capable of operating like an aircraft and achieving orbit like the shuttle. Introduced to the public in 1986, the concept was intended to reach Mach 25, enabling flights between Dulles Airport to Tokyo in two hours, while also being capable of low Earth orbit. Six critical technologies were identified, three relating to the propulsion system, which would consist of a hydrogen-fueled scramjet.

The NASP program became the Hypersonic Systems Technology Program (HySTP) in late 1994. HySTP was designed to transfer the accomplishments made in hypersonic flight into a technology development program. On 27 January 1995 the Air Force terminated participation in (HySTP).

In 1994, a USAF captain proposed an F-16 sized single-stage-to-orbit peroxide/kerosene spaceplane called &quot;Black Horse&quot;. It was to take off almost empty and undergo aerial refueling before rocketing to orbit.

The Lockheed Martin X-33 was a 1/3 scale prototype made as part of an attempt by NASA to build a SSTO hydrogen-fuelled spaceplane VentureStar that failed when the hydrogen tank design could not be constructed as intended.

On 5 March 2006, Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology published a story purporting to be the &quot;outing&quot; of a highly classified U.S. military two-stage-to-orbit spaceplane system with the code name Blackstar.

In 2011, Boeing proposed the X-37C, a 165 to 180 percent scale X-37B built to carry up to six passengers to low Earth orbit. The spaceplane was also intended to carry cargo, with both upmass and downmass capacity.

=== Soviet Union (1960s–1991) ===


The Soviet Union first considered a preliminary design of rocket-launch small spaceplane Lapotok in early 1960s. The Spiral airspace system with small orbital spaceplane and rocket as second stage was developed in the 1960s–1980s. Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-105 was a crewed test vehicle to explore low-speed handling and landing.

=== Russia ===

In the early 2000s the orbital &#x27;cosmoplane&#x27; () was proposed by Russia&#x27;s Institute of Applied Mechanics as a passenger transport. According to researchers, it could take about 20 minutes to fly from Moscow to Paris, using hydrogen and oxygen-fueled engines.

=== United Kingdom ===

The Multi-Unit Space Transport And Recovery Device (MUSTARD) was a concept explored by the British Aircraft Corporation (BAC) around 1968 for launching payloads weighing as much as into orbit. It was never constructed.

In the 1980s, British Aerospace began development of HOTOL, an SSTO spaceplane powered by a revolutionary SABRE air-breathing rocket engine, but the project was canceled due to technical and financial uncertainties. The inventor of SABRE set up Reaction Engines to develop SABRE and proposed a twin-engined SSTO spaceplane called Skylon. One NASA analysis showed possible issues with the hot rocket exhaust plumes causing heating of the tail structure at high Mach numbers. although the CEO of Skylon Enterprises Ltd has claimed that reviews by NASA were &quot;quite positive&quot;.

Bristol Spaceplanes has undertaken design and prototyping of three potential spaceplanes since its founding by David Ashford in 1991. The European Space Agency has endorsed these designs on several occasions.

=== European Space Agency (1985–present) ===
France worked on the Hermes crewed spaceplane launched by Ariane rocket in the late 20th century, and proposed in January 1985 to go through with Hermes development under the auspices of the ESA.

In the 1980s, West Germany funded design work on the MBB Sänger II with the Hypersonic Technology Program. Development continued on MBB/Deutsche Aerospace Sänger II/HORUS until the late 1980s when it was canceled. Germany went on to participate in the Ariane rocket, Columbus space station and Hermes spaceplane of ESA, Spacelab of ESA-NASA and &quot;Deutschland&quot; missions (non-U.S. funded Space Shuttle flights with Spacelab). The Sänger II had predicted cost savings of up to 30 percent over expendable rockets.

Hopper was one of several proposals for a European reusable launch vehicle (RLV) planned to cheaply ferry satellites into orbit by 2015. One of those was &#x27;Phoenix&#x27;, a German project which is a one-seventh scale model of the Hopper concept vehicle. The suborbital Hopper was a Future European Space Transportation Investigations Programme system study design A test project, the Intermediate eXperimental Vehicle (IXV), has demonstrated lifting reentry technologies and will be extended under the PRIDE programme.

=== Japan ===
&quot;HOPE&quot; was a Japanese experimental spaceplane project designed by a partnership between NASDA and NAL (both now part of JAXA), started in the 1980s. It was positioned for most of its lifetime as one of the main Japanese contributions to the International Space Station, the other being the Japanese Experiment Module. The project was eventually cancelled in 2003, by which point test flights of a sub-scale testbed had flown successfully.

=== India ===
AVATAR (Aerobic Vehicle for Hypersonic Aerospace Transportation; ) was a concept study for an uncrewed single-stage reusable spaceplane capable of horizontal takeoff and landing, presented to India&#x27;s Defence Research and Development Organisation. The mission concept was for low cost military and commercial satellite launches.

== Current development programs ==

=== China ===

Shenlong () is a Chinese robotic spaceplane that may be similar to the Boeing X-37. Only a few images have been released since late 2007.

=== European Union ===
A test project, the Intermediate eXperimental Vehicle (IXV), has demonstrated lifting reentry technologies and will be extended under the PRIDE programme.
The FAST20XX Future High-Altitude High Speed Transport 20XX aims to establish sound technological foundations for the introduction of advanced concepts in suborbital high-speed transportation with air-launch-to-orbit ALPHA vehicle.

The Daimler-Chrysler Aerospace RLV is a small reusable spaceplane prototype for the ESA Future Launchers Preparatory Programme/FLTP program. SpaceLiner is the most recent project.

=== India ===
, the Indian Space Research Organisation is developing a launch system named the Reusable Launch Vehicle (RLV). It is India&#x27;s first step towards realizing a two-stage-to-orbit reusable launch system. A space plane serves as the second stage. The plane is expected to have air-breathing scramjet engines as well as rocket engines. Tests with miniature spaceplanes and a working scramjet have been conducted by ISRO in 2016. In April 2023, India successfully conducted an autonomous landing mission of a scaled-down prototype of the spaceplane. The RLV prototype was dropped from a Chinook helicopter at an altitude of 4.5 kms and was made to autonomously glide down to a purpose-built runway at the Chitradurga Aeronautical Test Range, Karnataka.

=== Japan ===
As of 2018, Japan is developing the Winged Reusable Sounding rocket (WIRES), which if successful, may be used as a recoverable first-stage or as a crewed sub-orbital spaceplane.

=== United States ===
=== International ===

The Dawn Mk-II Aurora is a suborbital spaceplane being developed by Dawn Aerospace to demonstrate multiple suborbital flights per day. Dawn is based in the Netherlands and New Zealand, and is working closely with the American CAA. On 9 December 2020, the Civil Aviation Authority of New Zealand, working alongside the New Zealand Space Agency, issued a license allowing the vehicle to fly from a conventional airport. On 25 August 2021, the first test-flight campaign of five successful flights using surrogate jet engines was announced. As of 15 August 2022, 35 test flights have been complete, validating the vehicles aerodynamics, avionics, rapid deployment and various piloting modes. A qualified 2.5 kN.s pump-fed HTP/kerosene engine is being installed for high-performance high-altitude flights. Dawn Aerospace previously demonstrated multiple low-altitude rocket-powered flights per day on their Mk-I vehicle.

<doc id="455202" wikidata="Q2201064" url="?curid=455202" title="Crazy Taxi 2">
<text>is a 2001 racing video game and the second installment of the &quot;Crazy Taxi&quot; series. It was originally released for the Dreamcast, and was later ported to the PSP as part of &quot;Crazy Taxi: Fare Wars&quot; in 2007. It is the last &quot;Crazy Taxi&quot; game to be released for the Dreamcast after the console was discontinued in March 2001.

&quot;Crazy Taxi 2&quot; introduced several new features not found in the original, including two new cities, &quot;Around Apple&quot; and &quot;Small Apple&quot;, both somewhat based on New York City. The new cities share four new drivers as default, bringing the total playable characters to eight.

==Gameplay==
The gameplay is very similar to the original &quot;Crazy Taxi&quot;, and centers around picking people up at destinations which are highlighted with colored rings, and dropping them off at stated destinations.

Unlike its predecessor, &quot;Crazy Taxi 2&quot; allows the player to carry multiple passengers. The game also saw the introduction of the &quot;Crazy Hop&quot; feature, which allows the player to jump over certain surfaces to save time, as they ferry taxi passengers around the locations. By performing moves such as the &quot;Crazy Hop&quot; and the &quot;Crazy Dash&quot;, the driver accumulates tips from their passengers, which increases the total score.

Each customer will have a different color appear above him or her with money sign according to the color. Green means long distance, yellow means mid range and red means short distance. The longer the distance, the more money the player can earn. There is a time limit when driving each customer to the destination. If the time limit expires before reaching the destination, the customer will jump out of the cab. The game has no restriction on players aside from a time limit, allowing players to drive as fast and as recklessly as they wish.

This sequel includes a modified soundtrack with rock bands The Offspring and Methods of Mayhem. The game also has some online modes in the form of a scoreboard, and replay-sharing.
There are some unlockable items and maps for which players need to beat mini games to unlock.

==Reception==
The game received &quot;favorable&quot; reviews according to video game review aggregator Metacritic. Jeff Lundrigan of &quot;NextGen&quot; said, &quot;If you liked the original—and really, who didn&#x27;t?—there&#x27;s just as much to like here.&quot; In Japan, &quot;Famitsu&quot; gave it a score of 35 out of 40. Michael &quot;Major Mike&quot; Weigand of &quot;GamePro&quot; said, &quot;&quot;CT2&quot; had some lofty expectations to meet, but its new innovations and features aren&#x27;t worth the sticker price. The game is hardly a lemon, it just can&#x27;t quite make it off the test-drive rental lot.&quot;

The game was nominated at &quot;The Electric Playground&quot;″s 2001 Blister Awards for the &quot;Dreamcast Game of the Year&quot; award, but lost to both &quot;NFL 2K2&quot; and &quot;NBA 2K2&quot; (tie).

The game received a sequel, &quot;Crazy Taxi 3: High Roller&quot;, in 2002.

<doc id="455212" wikidata="Q632691" url="?curid=455212" title="Qutbism">
<text>Qutbism is an exonym that refers to the Sunni Islamist beliefs and ideology of Sayyid Qutb, a leading Islamist revolutionary of the Muslim Brotherhood who was executed by the Egyptian government of Gamal Abdel Nasser in 1966. Influenced by the doctrines of earlier Islamists like Hasan al-Banna and Maududi, Qutbism advocates Islamic extremist violence in order to establish an Islamic government, in addition to promoting offensive Jihad. Qutbism has been characterized as an Islamofascist and Islamic terrorist ideology.

Sayyid Qutb&#x27;s treatises deeply influenced numerous jihadist ideologues and organizations across the Muslim world. Qutbism has gained prominence due to its influence on notable Jihadist figures of contemporary era such as Abdullah Azzam, Osama bin Laden, Ayman al-Zawahiri, and Saif al-Adel. Its ideas have also been adopted by the Salafi-jihadist terrorist organization Islamic State (ISIL). It was one inspiration that influenced Ruhollah Khomeini in the development of his own ideology, Khomeinism.

Qutbist literature has been a major source of influence on numerous jihadist movements and organizations that have emerged since the 1970s. These include the Egyptian Islamic Jihad, &quot;al-Jama&#x27;ah al-Islamiyya&quot;, &quot;al-Takfir wal-Hijra&quot;, the Armed Islamic Group of Algeria (GIA), the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group (LIFG), al-Qaeda, al-Nusra Front, and the Islamic State (ISIL), and others that have sought to implement their strategy of waging offensive Jihad.

==Terminology==
While adherents of Qutbism are referred to as Qutbists or &quot;Qutbiyyun&quot; (singular: &quot;Qutbi&quot;), they rarely refer to themselves with these names (i.e. the word is not an endonym); the name was first and still is used by the sect&#x27;s opponents (i.e. it is an exonym).

==Tenets==

The main tenet of the Qutbist ideology is that modern Muslims abandoned true Islam centuries ago, having instead reverted to jahiliyyah. Adherents believe that Islam must be re-established by Qutb&#x27;s followers.

Qutb outlined his religious and political ideas in his book &quot;Ma&#x27;alim fi-l-Tariq&quot; (&quot;Milestones&quot;). Important principles of Qutbism include:
* Adherence to Sharia as sacred law accessible to humans, without which Islam cannot exist
* Adherence to Sharia as a complete way of life that will bring not only justice, but peace, personal serenity, scientific discovery, complete freedom from servitude, and other benefits;
* Avoidance of Western and non-Islamic &quot;evil and corruption,&quot; including socialism, nationalism and consumerist capitalism.
* Vigilance against Western and Jewish conspiracies against Islam;
* A two-pronged attack of
**preaching to convert and,
**jihad to forcibly eliminate the &quot;structures&quot; of &quot;Jahiliyya&quot;;
* Offensive Jihad to eliminate &quot;Jahiliyya&quot; not only from the Islamic homeland but from the face of the Earth, seeing it as mutually exclusive with true Islam.

===Takfirism===
Qutb declared Islam &quot;extinct,&quot; which implied that any Muslims who do not follow his teachings are not actually Muslim. This was intended to shock Muslims into religious rearmament. When taken literally, &quot;takfir&quot; refers to ex-communication, thereby declaring all non-Qutbist Muslims to be apostates in violation of Sharia law. Violating this law could potentially be punished by death, according to Islamic law.

Because of these serious consequences, Muslims have traditionally been reluctant to practice &quot;takfir&quot;, that is, to pronounce professed Muslims as unbelievers, even when in violation of Islamic law. This prospect of &quot;fitna&quot;, or internal strife, between Qutbists and &quot;takfir-ed&quot; mainstream Muslims, led Qutb to conclude that the Egyptian government was irredeemably evil. As a result, he helped to plan a thwarted series of assassinations of Egyptian officials, the discovery of which let to Qutb&#x27;s trial and eventual execution. Due in part to this teaching, Qutb&#x27;s ideology remains controversial among Muslims.

It is unclear whether Qutb&#x27;s proclamation of &quot;jahiliyyah&quot; was meant to apply the global Muslim community or to only Muslim governments. 

In the 1980s and 1990s, a series of terrorist attacks in Egypt were committed by Islamic extremists believed to be influenced by Qutb. Victims included Egyptian President Anwar Sadat, head of the counter-terrorism police Major General Raouf Khayrat, parliamentary speaker Rifaat el-Mahgoub, dozens of European tourists and Egyptian bystanders, and over one hundred Egyptian police officers. Qutb&#x27;s &quot;takfir&quot; against the Egyptian government, which he believed to be irredeemably evil, was a primary motivation for the attacks. Other factors included frustration with Egypt&#x27;s economic stagnation and rage over President Sadat&#x27;s policy of reconciliation with Israel.

==History==
===Spread of Qutb&#x27;s ideas===
Qutb&#x27;s message was spread through his writings, his followers and especially through his brother, Muhammad Qutb. Muhammad was implicated in the assassination plots that led to Qutb&#x27;s execution, but he was spared the death penalty. After his release from prison, Muhammad moved to Saudi Arabia along with fellow members of the Muslim Brotherhood. There, he became a professor of Islamic Studies and edited, published and promoted his brother Sayyid&#x27;s works.

One of Qutb&#x27;s key proponents was one of his students, Ayman Al-Zawahiri, who went on to become a member of the Egyptian Islamic Jihad and later a mentor of Osama bin Laden and a leading member of al-Qaeda. He had been first introduced to Sayyad Qutb by his uncle, Mafouz Azzam, who was a close friend to Qutb and taught his nephew that he was an honorable man. Zawahiri paid homage to Qutb in his work &quot;Knights under the Prophet&#x27;s Banner.&quot;

Qutbism was propagated by Abdullah Azzam during the Afghan-Soviet War. As the Muslim jihad volunteers from around the world exchanged religious ideas, Qutbism merged with Salafism and Wahhabism, culminating in the formation of Salafi jihadism. Abdullah Azzam was a mentor of bin Laden as well.

Osama bin Laden reportedly regularly attended weekly public lectures by Muhammad Qutb at King Abdulaziz University, and to have read and been deeply influenced by Sayyid Qutb.

The Yemeni Al-Qaeda leader Anwar al-Awlaki also cited Qutb&#x27;s writings as formative to his ideology.

Many Islamic extremists consider him a father of the movement. Ayman al-Zawahiri, former leader of Al-Qaeda, asserted that Qutb&#x27;s execution lit &quot;the jihadist fire&quot;, and reshaped the direction if the Islamist movement by convincing them that the &quot;takfir&quot; against Muslim governments made them important targets.

===Backlash===
Following Qutb&#x27;s death, his ideas spread throughout Egypt and other parts of the Arab and Muslim world, prompting a backlash by more traditionalist and conservative Muslims, such as the book &quot;Du&#x27;ah, la Qudah&quot; (&quot;Preachers, not Judges&quot;) (1969). The book, written by Muslim Brotherhood Supreme Guide Hassan al-Hudaybi, attacked the idea of Takfir of other Muslims, though it was ostensibly intended as a criticism of Mawdudi.

==Views==
===Science and learning===
On the importance of science and learning, Qutb was ambivalent. 

He wrote that Muslims should learn science and develop their capabilities to fulfill their role as representatives of God. He encouraged Muslims to seek knowledge in abstract sciences and arts, whether from Muslim or non-Muslim teachers, so that Muslim communities will have their own experts.

However, Qutb believed that Muslims were not allowed to study some subjects, including:

the principles of economics and political affairs and the interpretation of historical processes... the origin of the universe, the origin of the life of man... philosophy, comparative religion... sociology (excluding statistics and observations)... Darwinist biology ([which] goes beyond the scope of its observations, without any rhyme or reason and only exists for the sake of expressing an opinion...).

He also believed that the era of scientific discovery in the West was over, and that further scientific discovery must be reached in accordance with Sharia law.

=== On Philosophy and Kalam ===

Qutb also strongly opposed &quot;Falsafa&quot; and Ilm al-Kalam, which he denounced as deviations which undermined the original Islamic creed because they were based on Aristotelian logic. He denounced these disciplines as alien to Islamic traditions and called for their abandonment in favor of a literalist interpretation of Islamic Scriptures.

===Sharia and governance===
Qutbism advocates the belief that in a sharia-based society, wonders of justice, prosperity, peace and harmony—both individually and societally—are &quot;not postponed for the next life [i.e. heaven] but are operative even in this world&quot;.

Qutb believed harmony and perfection brought by Sharia law is such that the use of offensive jihad to spread sharia-Islam throughout the non-Muslim world is not aggression but rather means of introducing &quot;true freedom&quot; to the masses. Because Sharia law is judged by God rather than man, in this view, enforcing Sharia frees people from servitude to each other. 

In other works Qutb describes the ruler of the Islamic state, as a man (never a woman) who &quot;derives his legitimacy from his being elected by the community and from his submission to God. He has no privileges over other Muslims, and is only obeyed as long as he himself adheres to the shari‘a&quot;.

===Conspiracy theories===
Qutbism emphasizes what it sees as the evil designs of Westerners and Jews against Islam, and it also emphasizes the importance of Muslims not trusting or imitating them.

===Non-Muslims===
Qutbisms&#x27;s teachings on non-Muslims gained attention after the September 11 attacks. Qutb&#x27;s writings on non-Muslims, particularly Western non-Muslims, are extremely negative. They teach that Christians and Jews are hostile to his movement &quot;simply for being Muslims&quot; and believing in God. He refers to &quot;people of the book,&quot; who are typically viewed more favorably than other non-Muslims in Islam, as &quot;depraved&quot; for having &quot;falsified&quot; their religious texts.

Qutb believed Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyya&#x27;s teachings that the realm outside of Muslim lands was &quot;Dar al-Harb&quot; (&quot;the Abode of War&quot;), and had to be subjugated by Muslims. Subjugation would actually be &quot;liberation&quot; however, because it &quot;would free men from all authority except that of God.&quot; However, this view also necessitates that non-Muslims not be allowed to make law or choose representatives, lest they disobey Islamic law.

====The West====
In Qutb&#x27;s view, Western Imperialism is not only an economic or racial exploitation means of oppression, but rather an attempt to undermine the faith of Muslims. He believed that historians lied to confuse Muslims and weaken their faith by teaching, for example, that the Crusades an attempt by Christians to reconquer the formerly Christian-ruled holy land. He believed that the ultimate goal of these efforts was to destroy Muslim society.

Qutb spent two years in the U.S. in the late 1940s and he disliked it immensely. Qutb wrote that he experienced &quot;Western malevolence&quot; during his time there, including an attempt by an American agent to seduce him, and the alleged celebration of American hospital employees upon hearing of the assassination of Egyptian Ikhwan Supreme Guide Hassan al-Banna.

Qutb&#x27;s critics, particularly in the West, have cast doubts upon these stories. Having not been a member of any government or political organization at the time of his visit, it is unlikely that American intelligence agents would have sought him out. Additionally, many Americans did not know who Hassan al-Banna or the Muslim Brotherhood were in 1948, making the celebration of hospital employees unlikely.

====Western corruption====

Qutbism emphasizes a claimed Islamic moral superiority over the West, according to Islamist values. One example of the West&#x27;s perceived moral decay was the &quot;animal-like&quot; mixing of the sexes, as well as jazz, which he found lurid and distasteful for its association with Black Americans. Qutb states that while he was in America a young woman told him that ethics and sex are separate issues, pointing out that animals do not have any problems mixing freely.

Critics (such as Maajid Nawaz) protest by arguing that Qutb&#x27;s complaint about both American racism and the &quot;primitive inclinations&quot; of the &quot;Negro&quot; are contradictory and hypocritical. There is also doubt as to whether the sentiment that &quot;sexual relations&quot; have no &quot;ethical element&quot; would have been representative of American public opinion at the height of the sexual revolution 30 years later, let alone at the time of Qutb&#x27;s visit to America in the late 1940s.

The place Qutb spent most of his time in was the small city of Greeley, Colorado, dominated by cattle feedlots and an &quot;unpretentious university&quot;, originally founded as &quot;a sober, godly, cooperative community&quot;.

====Jews====

The other anti-Islamic conspiratorial group, according to Qutb, is &quot;World Jewry,&quot; because that it is engaging in tricks to eliminate &quot;faith and religion&quot;, and trying to divert &quot;the wealth of mankind&quot; into &quot;Jewish financial institutions&quot; by charging interest on loans. Jewish designs are so pernicious, according to Qutb&#x27;s logic, that &quot;anyone who leads this [Islamic] community away from its religion and its Quran can only be [a] Jewish agent.&quot;

==Criticism==
===By Muslims===
While &quot;Ma&#x27;alim fi-l-Tariq&quot; [Arabic: معالم في الطريق] (Milestones) was Qutb&#x27;s manifesto, other elements of Qutbism are found in his works &quot;Al-&#x27;adala al-Ijtima&#x27;iyya fi-l-Islam&quot; [Arabic: العدالة الاجتماعية في الاسلام] (&quot;Social Justice in Islam&quot;), and his Quranic commentary &quot;Fi Zilal al-Qur&#x27;an&quot; [Arabic: في ظلال القرآن] (In the shade of the Qur&#x27;an). Ideas in (or alleged to be in) those works also have been criticized by some traditionalist/conservative Muslims. They include:
* Qutb&#x27;s assertion that slavery was now illegal under Islam, as its lawfulness was only temporary, existing only &quot;until the world devised a new code of practice, other than enslavement.&quot; Many contemporary Islamic scholars, however, do share the view that slavery is not allowed in Islam in modern times. On the other hand, according to Salafi critics such as Saleh Al-Fawzan, &quot;Islam has affirmed slavery ... And it will continue so long as Jihaad in the path of Allah exists.&quot;
* Proposals to redistribute income and property to the needy. Opponents claim they are revisionist and innovations of Islam.
* Describing Moses as having an &quot;excitable nature&quot; – this allegedly being &quot;,&quot; and &quot;mockery of the Prophets is apostasy in its own,&#x27;&quot; according to Shaikh ‘Abdul-Aziz ibn Baz.
* Dismissing fiqh or the schools of Islamic law known as madhhab as separate from &quot;Islamic principles and Islamic understanding.&quot;
* Describing Islamic societies as being sunk in a state of &quot;Jahiliyyah&quot; (pagan ignorance) implying &quot;takfir&quot;. Salafi scholars like (Albani, Ibn Baz, Ibn Jibreen, Ibn Uthaymeen, Saalih al-Fawzan, Muqbil ibn Hadi, etc.) would condemn Qutb as a heretic for &quot;takfiri&quot; views as well as for what they considered to be theological deviancies. They also identified his methodology as a distinct &quot;Qutbi&#x27; manhaj&quot;, thus resulting in the labelling of Salafi-Jihadis as &quot;Qutbists&quot; by many of their quietist Salafi opponents.

Qutb may now be facing criticism representing his idea&#x27;s success or Qutbism&#x27;s logical conclusion as much as his idea&#x27;s failure to persuade some critics. Writing before the Islamic revival was in full bloom, Qutb sought Islamically correct alternatives to European ideas like Marxism and socialism and proposed Islamic means to achieve the ends of social justice and equality, redistribution of private property and political revolution. But according to Olivier Roy, contemporary &quot;neofundamentalists refuse to express their views in modern terms borrowed from the West. They consider indulging in politics, even for a good cause, will by definition lead to &quot;bid&#x27;a&quot; and &quot;shirk&quot; (the giving of priority to worldly considerations over religious values.)&quot;

There are, however, some commentators who display an ambivalence towards him, and Roy notes that &quot;his books are found everywhere and mentioned on most neo-fundamentalist websites, and arguing his &quot;mystical approach&quot;, &quot;radical contempt and hatred for the West&quot;, and &quot;pessimistic views on the modern world&quot; have resonated with these Muslims.

=== Criticism by Americans ===
James Hess, an analyst at the American Military University (AMU), labelled Qutbism as &quot;Islamic-based terrorism&quot;. In his essay criticizing the doctrines of Qutbist ideology, US Army colonel Dale C. Eikmeier described Qutbism as &quot;a fusion of puritanical and intolerant Islamic orientations that include elements from both the Sunni and Shia sects&quot;.

==Relationship with the Muslim Brotherhood==
The controversy over Qutbism is partially caused by two opposing factions which exist within the Islamic revival: the politically quiet Salafi Muslims, and the politically active Muslim groups which are associated with the Muslim Brotherhood. 

Although Sayyid Qutb was never the head of the Muslim Brotherhood, he was the Brotherhood&#x27;s &quot;leading intellectual,&quot; the editor of its weekly periodical, and a member of the highest branch in the Brotherhood, the Working Committee and the Guidance Council.

Hassan al-Hudaybi, the leader of the Muslim Brotherhood, argued against &quot;takfir&quot; and adopted a tolerant attitude. In response, some Qutbists concluded that the Muslim Brotherhood had abandoned their ideology. Ayman al-Zawahiri, a prominent Qutbist, also attacked the Muslim Brotherhood.

After the publication of &quot;Ma&#x27;alim fi-l-Tariq&quot; (&quot;Milestones&quot;), opinion in the Brotherhood split over his ideas, though many in Egypt (including extremists outside the Brotherhood) and most of the Muslim Brotherhood&#x27;s members in other countries are said to have shared his analysis &quot;to one degree or another.&quot; However, the leadership of the Brotherhood, headed by Hassan al-Hudaybi, remained moderate and interested in political negotiation and activism. By the 1970s, the Brotherhood had renounced violence as a means of achieving its goals. In recent years, his ideas have been embraced by Islamic extremist groups, while the Muslim Brotherhood has tended to serve as the official voice of Moderate Islamism.

==Influence on Jihadist movements==
In 2005, the British author and religion academic Karen Armstrong declared, regarding the ideological framework of al-Qaeda, that al-Qaeda and nearly every other Islamic fundamentalist movement was influenced by Qutb. She proposed the term &quot;Qutbian terrorism&quot; to describe violence by his followers.

According to &quot;The Guardian&quot; journalist Robert Manne, &quot;there exists a more or less general consensus that the ideology of the Islamic State was founded upon the principles which were set forth by Qutb&quot;, particularly based on some sections of his treatises &quot;Milestones&quot; and &quot;In the Shade of the Qur&#x27;an&quot;. 

However, the self-declared Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, headed by Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, has been described by various analysts as being more violent than al-Qaeda and closely aligned with Wahhabism, alongside Salafism and Salafi jihadism. In 2014, regarding the ideology of IS, Karen Armstrong remarked that &quot;IS is certainly an Islamic movement [...] because its roots are in Wahhabism, a form of Islam practised in Saudi Arabia that developed only in the 18th century&quot;. 

Nabil Na&#x27;eem, a former associate of Ayman al-Zawahiri and an ex-Islamic Jihad leader, argued that Qutb&#x27;s writings were the main factor that led to the rise of Al-Qaeda, Islamic State and various Jihadist groups.

<text>Jacques-Germain Soufflot (, 22 July 1713 – 29 August 1780) was a French architect in the international circle that introduced neoclassicism. His most famous work is the Panthéon in Paris, built from 1755 onwards, originally as a church dedicated to Saint Genevieve.

== Biography ==
Soufflot was born in Irancy, near Auxerre. In the 1730s he attended the French Academy in Rome, where young French students in the 1750s would later produce the first full-blown generation of Neoclassical designers. Soufflot&#x27;s models were less the picturesque Baroque being built in modern Rome, as much as the picturesque aspects of monuments of antiquity.

After returning to France, Soufflot practiced in Lyon, where he built the &quot;Hôtel-Dieu&quot;, like a chaste riverside street facade, interrupted by the central former chapel, its squared dome with illusionistic diminishing coffers on the interior. With the Temple du Change, he was entrusted with completely recasting a 16th-century market exchange building housing a meeting space housed above a loggia. Soufflot&#x27;s newly made loggia is an unusually severe arcading tightly bound between flat Doric pilasters, with emphatic horizontal lines. He was accepted into the Lyon Academy.

A more creative trip to Italy was made when the mature Soufflot returned in 1750 in the company of the future Marquis de Marigny, the talented young brother of Madame de Pompadour, who was being groomed for his future as director of the King&#x27;s Buildings (&quot;Bâtiments du Roi&quot;). On this trip Soufflot made a special study of theaters. In 1755 Marigny, the new Director General of Royal Buildings, gave Soufflot architectural control of all the royal buildings in Paris. In the same year, he was admitted to the Royal Academy of Architecture. In 1756 his opera house opened in Lyon.
The Panthéon is his most famous work, but the Hôtel Marigny built for his young patron (1768–1771) across from the Élysée Palace, is a better definition of Soufflot&#x27;s personal taste. Soufflot died in Paris in 1780, and is buried in the Panthéon next to Voltaire. 

Like all the architects of his day, Soufflot considered the classical idiom essential. He stood out for his &quot;strictness of line, firmness of form, simplicity of contour, and rigorously architectonic conception of detail&quot; which contrasted sharply with the late Baroque and Rococo architecture of his contemporaries.

<text>Data engineering refers to the building of systems to enable the collection and usage of data. This data is usually used to enable subsequent analysis and data science, which often involves machine learning. Making the data usable usually involves substantial compute and storage, as well as data processing.

== History ==
Around the 1970s/1980s the term information engineering methodology (IEM) was created to describe database design and the use of software for data analysis and processing. These techniques were intended to be used by database administrators (DBAs) and by systems analysts based upon an understanding of the operational processing needs of organizations for the 1980s. In particular, these techniques were meant to help bridge the gap between strategic business planning and information systems. A key early contributor (often called the &quot;father&quot; of information engineering methodology) was the Australian Clive Finkelstein, who wrote several articles about it between 1976 and 1980, and also co-authored an influential Savant Institute report on it with James Martin. Over the next few years, Finkelstein continued work in a more business-driven direction, which was intended to address a rapidly changing business environment; Martin continued work in a more data processing-driven direction. From 1983 to 1987, Charles M. Richter, guided by Clive Finkelstein, played a significant role in revamping IEM as well as helping to design the IEM software product (user data), which helped automate IEM.

In the early 2000s, the data and data tooling was generally held by the information technology (IT) teams in most companies. Other teams then used data for their work (e.g. reporting), and there was usually little overlap in data skillset between these parts of the business.

In the early 2010s, with the rise of the internet, the massive increase in data volumes, velocity, and variety led to the term big data to describe the data itself, and data-driven tech companies like Facebook and Airbnb started using the phrase data engineer. Due to the new scale of the data, major firms like Google, Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, and Netflix started to move away from traditional ETL and storage techniques. They started creating data engineering, a type of software engineering focused on data, and in particular infrastructure, warehousing, data protection, cybersecurity, mining, modelling, processing, and metadata management. This change in approach was particularly focused on cloud computing. Data started to be handled and used by many parts of the business, such as sales and marketing, and not just IT.

== Tools ==

=== Compute ===
High-performance computing is critical for the processing and analysis of data. One particularly widespread approach to computing for data engineering is dataflow programming, in which the computation is represented as a directed graph (dataflow graph); nodes are the operations, and edges represent the flow of data. Popular implementations include Apache Spark, and the deep learning specific TensorFlow. More recent implementations, such as Differential/Timely Dataflow, have used incremental computing for much more efficient data processing.

=== Storage ===
Data is stored in a variety of ways, one of the key deciding factors is in how the data will be used.
Data engineers optimize data storage and processing systems to reduce costs. They use data compression, partitioning, and archiving.

==== Databases ====
If the data is structured and some form of online transaction processing is required, then databases are generally used. Originally mostly relational databases were used, with strong ACID transaction correctness guarantees; most relational databases use SQL for their queries. However, with the growth of data in the 2010s, NoSQL databases have also become popular since they horizontally scaled more easily than relational databases by giving up the ACID transaction guarantees, as well as reducing the object-relational impedance mismatch. More recently, NewSQL databases — which attempt to allow horizontal scaling while retaining ACID guarantees — have become popular.

==== Data warehouses ====

If the data is structured and online analytical processing is required (but not online transaction processing), then data warehouses are a main choice. They enable data analysis, mining, and artificial intelligence on a much larger scale than databases can allow, and indeed data often flow from databases into data warehouses. Business analysts, data engineers, and data scientists can access data warehouses using tools such as SQL or business intelligence software.

==== Data lakes ====

A data lake is a centralized repository for storing, processing, and securing large volumes of data. A data lake can contain structured data from relational databases, semi-structured data, unstructured data, and binary data. A data lake can be created on premises or in a cloud-based environment using the services from public cloud vendors such as Amazon, Microsoft, or Google.

==== Files ====
If the data is less structured, then often they are just stored as files. There are several options:
* File systems represent data hierarchically in nested folders.
* Block storage splits data into regularly sized chunks; this often matches up with (virtual) hard drives or solid state drives.
* Object storage manages data using metadata; often each file is assigned a key such as a UUID.

=== Management ===
The number and variety of different data processes and storage locations can become overwhelming for users. This inspired the usage of a workflow management system (e.g. Airflow) to allow the data tasks to be specified, created, and monitored. The tasks are often specified as a directed acyclic graph (DAG).

== Lifecycle ==
=== Business planning ===
Business objectives that executives set for what&#x27;s to come are characterized in key business plans, with their more noteworthy definition in tactical business plans and implementation in operational business plans. Most businesses today recognize the fundamental need to grow a business plan that follows this strategy. It is often difficult to implement these plans because of the lack of transparency at the tactical and operational degrees of organizations. This kind of planning requires feedback to allow for early correction of problems that are due to miscommunication and misinterpretation of the business plan.

=== Systems design ===
The design of data systems involves several components such as architecting data platforms, and designing data stores.

=== Data modeling ===

This is the process of producing a data model, an abstract model to describe the data and relationships between different parts of the data.

== Roles ==
=== Data engineer ===
A data engineer is a type of software engineer who creates big data ETL pipelines to manage the flow of data through the organization. This makes it possible to take huge amounts of data and translate it into insights. They are focused on the production readiness of data and things like formats, resilience, scaling, and security. Data engineers usually hail from a software engineering background and are proficient in programming languages like Java, Python, Scala, and Rust. They will be more familiar with databases, architecture, cloud computing, and Agile software development.

=== Data scientist ===

Data scientists are more focused on the analysis of the data, they will be more familiar with mathematics, algorithms, statistics, and machine learning.

<text>Thomas Dale Akers (born May 20, 1951) is a former American astronaut in NASA&#x27;s Space Shuttle program.

==Education==
Akers was the valedictorian of his 29-member 1969 senior class from Eminence, Missouri. He worked summers as a park ranger in the 80,000 acre federal wilderness that borders Eminence. He graduated from the University of Missouri-Rolla (now the Missouri University of Science and Technology) with B.S. and M.S. degrees in applied mathematics in 1973 and 1975, respectively. At the age of 24, he returned to Eminence to become its math teacher, and subsequently its high school principal. In 1979, when a United States Air Force recruiter left brochures on his desk for his students, it was Akers who decided to sign up. He was selected for the astronaut program in 1987 and officially became an astronaut in 1988. As part of his training with NASA, Akers taught science classes at Troy State University for a brief period of time.

==NASA career==
Akers is a veteran of four shuttle flights in which he spent over 800 hours in orbit, including more than 29 hours of extra-vehicular activity (EVA) experience. In each of his flights, his role was as a mission specialist.
===STS-41===
His first space flight was in 1990 on STS-41, the 11th flight of Space Shuttle &quot;Discovery&quot;. He was instrumental in deploying the European Space Agency satellite Ulysses, a solar-exploration craft, as well as tending several secondary payloads and experiments.

===STS-49===

His next mission was in 1992 on STS-49, the maiden flight of Shuttle &quot;Endeavour&quot;. A primary goal of that mission was to capture and repair the non-functional Intelsat VI-F3 satellite. The first two attempts failed; Akers joined the third attempt which was successful. This marks the first three-person EVA in human history and was also the longest EVA (8 hours, 29 minutes) ever conducted to that time.

===STS-61===
On Akers&#x27; third mission in 1993 on STS-61, the fifth flight of &quot;Endeavour&quot;, he was one of four mission specialists who repaired and upgraded the Hubble Space Telescope on its first servicing mission. Akers spent just under 13.5 hours outside the &quot;Endeavour&quot; in two EVAs.

On May 18, 1994, Akers appeared on &quot;Home Improvement&quot; as himself along with rest of the STS-61 crew.

===STS-79===
His last mission was in 1996 on STS-79, the 17th flight of shuttle Atlantis. This was the fourth shuttle flight to rendezvous with the Russian space station Mir and the first to exchange U.S. astronauts with Mir, returning Shannon Lucid to earth and leaving John Blaha.

==After NASA==

Akers retired from NASA in 1997 and the Air Force in 1999 at the rank of colonel, taking a position as instructor of Mathematics at the University of Missouri–Rolla, which in 2008 changed its name to the Missouri University of Science and Technology. Akers retired from teaching in 2010.

==Other work==
Akers made a cameo appearance on the TV show &quot;Home Improvement&quot; by Touchstone Television. In Series 3, Episode 24, &quot;Reality Bytes&quot;, Akers and the Hubble crew appeared as guests on Tool Time and showed some of the tools they used in space. They also brought a video showing the first Tim Taylor &#x27;grunt&#x27; used in communications during a space walk.

==Special honors==

High School Valedictorian. Graduated summa cum laude from University of Missouri-Rolla. Named a Distinguished Graduate of U.S. Air Force Officer Training School, Squadron Officer School, and U.S. Air Force Test Pilot School. Recipient of the Defense Superior Service Medal with two oak leaf clusters; Legion of Merit Award; Defense Meritorious Service Medal; Air Force Meritorious Service Medal; Air Force Commendation Medal; Air Force Achievement Medal; NASA Distinguished Service Medal; two NASA Exceptional Service Medals; four NASA Space Flight Medals. Awarded an honorary Doctorate of Engineering from the University of Missouri-Rolla in 1992. Awarded ten Outstanding Teacher awards from UMR/S&amp;T 2000–2010, and the Missouri Governors Teaching Award 2004.

<text>Ladyhawke is a 1985 medieval fantasy film directed and produced by Richard Donner and starring Matthew Broderick, Rutger Hauer and Michelle Pfeiffer. The story is about a young thief who becomes unwillingly involved with a warrior and his lady who are hunted by the Bishop of Aquila. As he learns about the couple&#x27;s past and secret, he chooses to help them overcome the Bishop&#x27;s forces, and to lift an infernal curse.

In the same year, Joan D. Vinge published a novelization of the film, also titled &quot;Ladyhawke&quot;.

==Plot==

In medieval Italy, Gaston, a thief known as &quot;The Mouse&quot;, is captured and sentenced to death, but escapes from the Bishop of Aquila&#x27;s dungeons through the sewers. He is apprehended at an inn by Captain Marquet and the Bishop&#x27;s guards. Former Captain Etienne Navarre arrives on the scene and he and his pet hawk attack the guards and then escape with Phillipe.

Navarre and Phillipe ask for lodging at a farmer&#x27;s barn. At dusk, the farmer ambushes Phillipe with an axe, but is killed by an enormous black wolf. Phillipe runs back to the barn to get Navarre&#x27;s help, but instead finds a beautiful young woman dressed in Navarre&#x27;s cloak, who calmly approaches the wolf and walks into the woods with it.

The next day, Navarre reveals he needs Phillipe as part of a plan to kill the evil Bishop of Aquila. Phillipe refuses, so Navarre ties him to a tree. That night, the young woman reappears, and Phillipe tricks her into cutting his bonds. He flees, but is recaptured by Marquet and the guards, who learn Navarre&#x27;s location from him. Navarre once again fights off Marquet and his men to free Phillipe; in the process, his hawk is shot with an arrow.

Traveling slowly due to injuries of his own, Navarre orders Phillipe to go on ahead of him and take the hawk to the castle of an old monk named Imperius. Phillipe obeys, and Imperius sequesters the hawk in a locked room. Later that evening, Phillipe picks the lock and discovers the young woman, now with an arrow protruding from her chest. After Imperius treats her wounds, he explains to Phillipe that the woman is Isabeau of Anjou, who once refused the Bishop&#x27;s unwelcome advances. After learning from a drunken Imperius that Navarre and Isabeau were married, the Bishop called down a satanic curse upon them, dooming them to be &quot;always together, yet eternally apart&quot;. Navarre therefore takes the shape of a wolf each night, while Isabeau becomes a hawk by day.

The bishop&#x27;s guards attack the castle shortly before daybreak, but the sunrise turns Isabeau back into a hawk, allowing her to fly to safety. Navarre catches up to the castle and dispatches the last of the guards; Imperius tells him that the curse can be broken if the couple both face the Bishop as humans on &quot;a day without a night and a night without a day&quot; within three days&#x27; time. Navarre dismisses Imperius as an old drunk, and continues his way to Aquila, intent on simply killing the Bishop for revenge. Phillipe volunteers to join Navarre and &quot;Ladyhawke&quot;, and bids Imperius to follow them.

After the group survives an encounter with the Bishop&#x27;s hired wolf-trapper Cezar, and several other adventures, Phillipe finally convinces Navarre to try to break the curse before killing the bishop. When the group arrives at Aquila, Navarre, seeing no divine signs in the sky, once again decides to kill the Bishop, and orders Imperius to euthanize the Isabeau-hawk if the church bells ring, as this would signal Navarre&#x27;s failure. 

Phillipe, having snuck back into Aquila through the sewers, infiltrates the cathedral and unlocks its doors. Navarre rides in and duels with Marquet; suddenly noticing a solar eclipse, Navarre realizes Imperius was right, but fails to stop the Bishop&#x27;s men from ringing the bells. Believing that Imperius has slain Isabeau, Navarre continues his fight and eventually kills Marquet.

As Navarre is about to strike down the Bishop, a human Isabeau enters the cathedral and stops him. Together, they face the Bishop, breaking the curse. The maddened Bishop tries to kill Isabeau, only to die by Navarre&#x27;s sword. Isabeau and Navarre thank Phillipe and Imperius, and finally embrace in joy.

==Production==

Richard Donner had attempted to get the film financed for a number of years and came close to making it twice, once in England and once in Czechoslovakia. He eventually got the project up at Warner Bros. and 20th Century Fox, where it was green-lit by Alan Ladd Jr. Originally, Kurt Russell was cast as the male lead alongside Michelle Pfeiffer. The role of the pickpocket was offered to Sean Penn and then Dustin Hoffman, before Donner decided to go with Matthew Broderick. Eventually, Russell pulled out during rehearsals, and Rutger Hauer was chosen to replace him.

Writer Edward Khmara stated &quot;The story of two lovers kept apart by taking human form only at opposite times of day was an inspiration that occurred to me while jogging on the roof of the Hollywood YMCA.
The studio contention that &#x27;Ladyhawke&#x27; is based on an old legend is, in fact, a violation of Writers Guild rules, since it denies me full rights of authorship. The Guild undertook an action against Warner Bros, on this account … and a small amount of money was paid as compensation ... Warner Bros., or its publicity department, continues to circulate material restating the old legend story.
The inspiration for the character of Phillipe the Mouse was Francois Villon. His &#x27;Testament&#x27; recounts his imprisonment and mistreatment by Bishop Thibault d&#x27;Aussigny, in the dungeons of Meung. When the Dauphin, soon to be Louis XI of France, passed through Meung on his way to the coronation, he freed the prisoners, including Villon. This incident was actually used in the original story of &#x27;Ladyhawke.&#x27;&quot;

===Filming locations===

&quot;Ladyhawke&quot; was filmed in Italy; the Apennine meadow of Campo Imperatore in Abruzzo served as a prominent exterior location, while the monk scene was filmed at Rocca Calascio, a ruined fortress on top of a mountain, not far from real-world L&#x27;Aquila. In the region of Emilia-Romagna, the town of Castell&#x27;Arquato in the province of Piacenza and castle of Torrechiara in the province of Parma were also featured. Other Italian locations used include Soncino in the Lombardy region, Belluno in the Veneto region, and the Lazio region around Viterbo.

===Soundtrack===
Andrew Powell composed the score, and it was produced by Alan Parsons. Richard Donner stated that he was listening to The Alan Parsons Project (on which Powell collaborated) while scouting for locations, and became unable to separate his visual ideas from the music. Powell combined traditional orchestral music and Gregorian chant with contemporary progressive rock–infused material. At the time, it was part of a trend among 1980s fantasy films of abandoning the lush orchestral scores of composers such as John Williams, James Horner, and Jerry Goldsmith in favor of a modern pop/rock sound. The soundtrack album was released in 1985 and re-released with additional tracks in 1995. On February 10, 2015, a two-disc set was released by La-La Land Records; it includes previously unreleased music and bonus tracks and was limited to 3,000 units.

The film soundtrack, composed by Andrew Powell, has met some criticism, with some saying the synthesizer laden track is incongruous for a medieval-themed movie, while others were more critical, with one reviewer calling it the &quot;cream of the crop when it comes to atrocious scores&quot; and another saying it sounded like an &quot;exercise video that got played on top of a low budget &#x27;80s sitcom&quot;. It has been placed at the top of a list of worst movie soundscores, and appears on three other lists of bad movie music. Another commentator calls it one of the most &quot;widely mocked soundtracks in the history of film&quot;.

Powell has commented on the poor reception to the soundtrack, explaining that he did not in fact use a lot of rock music in it, and that the criticism was not warranted because even a &quot;classical&quot; soundtrack would still be anachronistic. He has not worked on many film soundtracks since.

==Reception==

===Box office===
The film was a box-office disappointment, grossing around $18.4 million against a $20 million budget and ranking 48th for the year at the North American box office.

===Critical response===
&quot;Ladyhawke&quot; has a rating of 67% on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 30 critics&#x27; reviews. The site&#x27;s consensus states: &quot;There&#x27;s pacing problems, but &quot;Ladyhawke&quot; has an undeniable romantic sweep that&#x27;s stronger than most fantasy epics of its ilk.&quot;

Vincent Canby in &quot;The New York Times&quot; called the film &quot;divided against itself&quot;, and went on to say that &quot;scenes of high adventure or of visual splendor... are spliced between other scenes with dialogue of a banality that recalls the famous Tony Curtis line, &#x27;Yondah lies my faddah&#x27;s castle. &quot;Time Out&quot; called it &quot;all rather facile sword-and-sorcery stuff, of course, but at times very funny... and always beautifully photographed&quot;. &quot;Variety&quot; described the film as a &quot;very likeable, very well-made fairytale... worthwhile for its extremely authentic look alone&quot;. Siskel and Ebert both gave the film positive &quot;thumbs up&quot; reviews on their syndicated television show and thought &quot;Ladyhawke&quot; was beautifully filmed with the potential to achieve lasting success as a classic in its genre. Siskel&#x27;s only major complaint was that Broderick&#x27;s role was almost anachronistic in his 1980s-style jokes, while Ebert felt Broderick&#x27;s comedic elements were fitting.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; singled out Matthew Broderick&#x27;s skill in coming &quot;very close to transforming contemporary wisecracks – particularly, his asides to God – into a more ageless kind of comedy&quot;, and said of Michelle Pfeiffer that her &quot;presence, both ethereal and erotic, is so vivid that even when she&#x27;s represented as a hawk, she still seems to be on the screen&quot;. &quot;Variety&quot; praised the casting of the lead actors, considering Pfeiffer &quot;perfect as the enchanting beauty&quot;. &quot;Time Out&quot; called Rutger Hauer &quot;camp&quot; and Pfeiffer &quot;decorative&quot;.

Colin Greenland reviewed &quot;Ladyhawke&quot; for &quot;Imagine&quot; magazine, and stated that &quot;a singular tale of witchcraft, love and courage, with a fascinating idea that it almost makes the most of&quot;.

===Accolades===

&quot;Ladyhawke&quot; was nominated for two Academy Awards, in the categories of Best Sound (Les Fresholtz, Dick Alexander, Vern Poore and Bud Alper) and Best Sound Effects Editing (Bob Henderson and Alan Murray), winning neither. It won a Saturn Award for Best Fantasy Film, and was nominated in the categories of Best Actress (Michelle Pfeiffer) and Best Music (Andrew Powell).

<doc id="455228" wikidata="Q2422834" url="?curid=455228" title="Masatoshi Nagase">
<text>is a Japanese actor and singer. He is best known in the West for his roles in Friðrik Þór Friðriksson&#x27;s &quot;Cold Fever&quot; and Jim Jarmusch&#x27;s &quot;Mystery Train&quot;.

Nagase was described by Todd Brown of Twitch Film as &quot;one of the great unsung heroes of Japanese film, a hugely reliable character actor with seemingly unerring taste in projects who - despite a huge body of work - remains largely unknown by name.&quot;

==Career==
Nagase co-starred in Jim Jarmusch&#x27;s &quot;Mystery Train&quot; (1989) with Youki Kudoh. He has starred in films such as Sion Sono&#x27;s &quot;Suicide Club&quot; (2001), Shinji Aoyama&#x27;s &quot;Mike Yokohama: A Forest with No Name&quot; (2002), and Yoji Yamada&#x27;s &quot;The Hidden Blade&quot; (2004).

<text>The New Zealand Division was an infantry division of the New Zealand Expeditionary Force raised for service in the First World War. It was formed in Egypt in early 1916 when the New Zealand and Australian Division was renamed after the detachment of its Australian personnel left the New Zealand Infantry Brigade, together with reinforcements from New Zealand, as the basis of the division. It was commanded by Major General Andrew Hamilton Russell for the duration of the war.

The division saw service on the Western Front in France and Belgium, fighting in major battles at the Somme, Messines and Broodseinde Ridge throughout 1916 and 1917. All were notable successes for the New Zealanders but the division suffered a serious defeat at Passchendaele on 12 October 1917, its most costly day of the war.

In early 1918, the division helped blunt the German spring offensive at the Somme, before the Allies went on the offensive in August. During the Hundred Days&#x27; Offensive that followed, it was one of the lead divisions of the Third Army and advanced in 75 days. The division&#x27;s last major engagement of the war was at Le Quesnoy in early November 1918. During the latter stages of the war, the New Zealand Division was one of the strongest divisions of the Dominion serving on the Western Front. After the armistice, it served on occupation duties in Germany before being disbanded in 1919.

==Background==
Following the outbreak of the First World War, the New Zealand government authorised the formation of the New Zealand Expeditionary Force (NZEF), under the command of Major General Alexander Godley, for service abroad. By October 1914, there were sufficient volunteers to form two brigades, the New Zealand Infantry Brigade and the New Zealand Mounted Brigade. These two formations formed the main body of the NZEF and, together with the Australian 4th Infantry Brigade and the 1st Light Horse Brigade, were the basis of the New Zealand and Australian Division, which fought in the Gallipoli campaign against the Turks.

In December 1915, the much depleted New Zealand and Australian Division was evacuated from Gallipoli, and was placed in reserve near the Suez Canal. Although there were concerns that the Turks might attack the canal, it was envisaged that the division would soon be called upon to serve elsewhere. Commanded by Major General Andrew Hamilton Russell, it was replenished with reinforcements from Australia and New Zealand and began a program of intensive training.

Since the deployment of the main body of the NZEF, the numbers of volunteers had steadily increased to the point that they could no longer be integrated into either of the two existing brigades. In January 1916, the commander of the Mediterranean Expeditionary Force in Egypt, Lieutenant General Sir Archibald Murray, proposed the number of available New Zealand personnel warranted the establishment of two new brigades which, together with the existing brigade, would form a New Zealand infantry division for service on the Western Front. The New Zealand government, initially concerned by the prospect of maintaining three infantry brigades, concurred after Murray reassured it that the number of personnel in Egypt were sufficient to keep the new division up to strength in the short term.

==Formation==
The New Zealand Division officially came into being at Moascar, Egypt, on 1 March 1916, when the New Zealand and Australian Division was so renamed. Russell, a well regarded senior officer of the Territorial Force who had performed well during the Gallipoli Campaign, was appointed the commander of the new formation.

The former New Zealand Infantry Brigade was to be the first of three infantry brigades of the division. The 1st Brigade was commanded by Brigadier General Francis Earl Johnston, who had led the original brigade at Gallipoli. The 2nd Brigade was formed from reinforcements currently in Egypt; this was commanded by another Gallipoli veteran, Brigadier General William Garnett Braithwaite. The third infantry brigade, known as the Rifle Brigade, was commanded by Brigadier General Harry Fulton. The division also included the Otago Mounted Rifles Regiment; one squadron was designated as the Divisional Mounted Troops while the remaining two squadrons were integrated into a pioneer battalion alongside Māori personnel. There were also three brigades of field artillery and one of howitzers. In total, the division had some 15,000 men in its ranks.

Along with the Australian 1st and 2nd Divisions, the New Zealand Division was to form part of I ANZAC Corps, under the command of Godley. In early March, the New Zealand Division assumed responsibility for the section of the Suez Canal guarded by the 2nd Division, which began to embark for France. After three weeks of sentry duty, the New Zealand Division returned to its Moascar base before it too was shipped to France in early April.

==Western Front==

The divisions of I ANZAC Corps, now commanded by Lieutenant General William Birdwood with Godley taking over II ANZAC Corps, were initially based in the Armentières sector where they would undergo intensive training in trench warfare on the Western Front. The Armentières front line was regarded by the Allies as a nursery sector where new units could undergo familiarisation without being called upon for intensive offensive operations.

Nevertheless, it was not an easy introduction to the front for the New Zealanders. On arriving in their sector, they found the defensive arrangements to be poor and immediately set about improving the trenches and wire emplacements. Although the bulk of the division&#x27;s personnel manned secondary defences rearward of the front line to avoid the German artillery, the forward areas had to be constantly patrolled as a deterrent to an attack and to give the impression they were fully manned. The static nature of the war meant that the Divisional Mounted Troops, intended to be used as scouts, were redundant and, along with two Light Horse squadrons from the Australian infantry divisions, were soon transferred to a new formation designated 1st ANZAC Light Horse Regiment. In July, the New Zealand Division was transferred to the newly arrived II ANZAC Corps while I ANZAC moved south to the Somme.

The New Zealanders would follow in due course but in the meantime, General Sir Douglas Haig, the commander of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF), called for diversionary actions to attract the attention of the German High Command away from the Allied preparations for the forthcoming offensive on the Somme. To achieve this, the New Zealanders mounted several trench raids. By the time the New Zealand Division was relieved in August, it had incurred 2,500 casualties, including 375 dead.

===Battle of the Somme===

After a period of refit and training, in September 1916 the New Zealand Division was assigned to XV Corps which, at the time, was participating in the Somme Offensive. On 15 September, the 2nd Brigade and the Rifle Brigade, with the 1st Brigade in reserve, participated in the Battle of Flers-Courcelette. The attack, as planned, was to capture a number of German-held trench systems in successive advances by alternating battalions; the first objective was the Switch trench complex, designated as the Green Line, with the next two being the Brown and Blue Lines. The Blue Line included the Flers trench network. The final objective was the Grove Alley trench complex, designated Red Line. The attack was to be preceded by a three-day preparatory bombardment and the division was also to be supported by tanks, which were being used for the first time. Four tanks were assigned to the division&#x27;s sector. The advance of the New Zealanders was to be flanked by corresponding movements of the neighbouring British 41st and 47th Divisions.

At 6:20 am, following the creeping artillery barrage that had been laid down by the divisional guns, the 2nd Brigade&#x27;s Auckland and Otago Battalions advanced on their first objective, the Switch trench complex, and seized it within an hour. Losses were heavy on the left side of the advance; the forward movement of the 47th Division was held up and this exposed the 2nd Otago Battalion to enfilade fire as they continued onto Switch trench.

It was planned for the 4th Battalion of the Rifle Brigade, with the benefit of tank support, to leapfrog the 2nd Brigade and move onto the next objective. However, the tanks suffered mechanical problems and failed to arrive on time. The battalion moved on regardless and secured the Brown Line by 7:50 am. The tanks followed on, and one was knocked out of action by artillery fire. The remaining tanks moved onto the Blue Line. The advance, now led by the 2nd and 3rd Battalions of the Rifle Brigade, was beginning to slow. The preparatory bombardment had failed to clear barbed wire ahead of the Flers trench and the infantry had gone to ground to await the tanks. Arriving at 10:30 am, they crushed the wire and allowed the 3rd Battalion to clear the trenches of its garrison, the 5th Bavarian Regiment; 145 were taken prisoner.

Efforts were made to consolidate the newly captured positions. The 41st Division, on the right flank, had reached its portion of the Blue Line and captured Flers but the 47th Division lagged behind. The New Zealanders remained exposed to enfilade fire along their left flank and German artillery fire also hampered attempts to shore up their positions. The 1st Battalion of the Rifle Brigade began an attack on the final objective, Red Line, at 10:50 am and secured a portion of the Grove Alley trenches by midday despite heavy casualties. However, the 47th Division had still not been able to secure its first objective while the 41st Division had to withdraw from Flers village. This left the New Zealanders in a salient exposed to heavy machine gun fire on both flanks. At 2:00 pm Germans were spotted advancing from the northeast. Captain Lindsay Inglis, the senior surviving officer in this area of Grove Alley, gave orders to strengthen the corresponding section of the line. When a platoon began moving to effect the order, this was misinterpreted as a withdrawal and the remaining elements of the battalion began to pull out to Flers village. Inglis was able to check the withdrawal, but with only 120 men, he opted to dig in where they were rather than try to reoccupy Grove Alley.

Despite several counterattacks during the afternoon, the New Zealanders managed to hold their front line, including the village of Flers, although both flanks remained exposed due to the failure of 41st and 47th Divisions to reach or hold their frontage of the Blue Line. It was a successful day for the division; it had captured the most ground of all the divisions of XV Corps involved in the battle. It had also reached all four of its objectives although it ended the day in possession of three plus Flers itself, which was actually in 41st Division&#x27;s sector.

To strengthen the division&#x27;s positions, the 1st Brigade was brought forward into the front lines overnight. The next day, an attack was launched by the brigade&#x27;s 1st Wellington Battalion. Supported by artillery, which suppressed an attack made by the Germans minutes before the start of the battalion&#x27;s advance from Flers Village, Grove Alley was captured. That evening the weather deteriorated and over the next few days rain filled trenches and shell holes, and turned the ground to thick mud. The New Zealanders were continually harassed by German artillery and localised attacks from the spur overlooking Grove Alley. Despite the conditions, the 1st Brigade carried out operations to strengthen the division&#x27;s exposed left flank, but it remained vulnerable to enfilade fire from the German positions.

An attack had been planned for 18 September but was postponed due to the poor weather. On 25 September, the attack went ahead. It was intended to extend the front to high ground that was known as Factory Corner. The high ground was undefended, and the 1st Brigade easily captured it under the cover of a creeping barrage. Two days later, Factory Corner formed the launchpad for a further attack by the brigade and the neighbouring 55th Division on two more trenchlines, designated Gird Trench and Gird Support. This time, the attack was not as straightforward and it took an extra day before the entire objective was in New Zealand hands. On 1 October, as a preliminary to the Battle of Le Transloy, 2nd Brigade&#x27;s Otago and Canterbury battalions captured strongpoints near Eaucourt L&#x27;Abbaye, which fell to the 47th Division two days later.

By the time of its withdrawal from the front lines on 4 October, the New Zealand Division had suffered 7,000 casualties (killed in action, wounded and missing), 1,500 of them fatal, since 15 September. On the opening day of the battle alone, there were 2,050 casualties from the 6,000 men who joined the fighting.

===Restructuring===
The division, now reattached to II ANZAC Corps, moved north in mid-October and replaced the 5th Australian Division at Sailly. It remained here, patrolling the sector and mounting raids, into February 1917. The men of the division had become fatigued through their service on the Western Front. While the 2nd and Rifle Brigades soon recovered, the 1st Brigade, having many Gallipoli veterans, continued to struggle as did Johnston, its commander. Consequently, Russell sent him on leave and reorganised the brigades.

The 1st Brigade swapped its two South Island battalions (1st Canterbury and 1st Otago) with the two North Island battalions (2nd Auckland and 2nd Wellington) of the 2nd Brigade. This placed all the North Island battalions in the 1st Brigade while all the South Island formations were in the 2nd Brigade. The four artillery brigades were reduced to three by distributing the batteries of the fourth amongst the others, one of which came under the direct control of II ANZAC Corps.

This period also saw the formation of the 4th Brigade in England, in response to a request made by the British War Office to the New Zealand government for another infantry division. Although their numbers were insufficient for a new division, personnel from New Zealand were arriving in the various NZEF depots in Europe at a much higher rate than they were being lost from the division due to casualties and attrition. By early 1917, there was a reserve of around 10,000 men available with which to draw upon for the new brigade without adversely affecting the ability to replace existing troops in the field, in the short term at least. The brigade&#x27;s core units were four infantry battalions designated as the 3rd Battalions of the Auckland, Wellington, Canterbury and Otago Regiments. Newly promoted Brigadier General Herbert Ernest Hart was appointed by Godley as the brigade&#x27;s commander, and after a rigorous training programme, curtailed by orders to report to France, it embarked for the front on 29 May 1917. With four infantry brigades, the New Zealand Division was now the strongest Dominion formation fighting in France with 20,000 personnel. However, Russell did not like his division&#x27;s four-brigade structure (the remainder of the British and Dominion infantry divisions had three brigades) as he continually had to fend off requests to use the extra brigade for labouring work in the corps rear area.

In the meantime, the division had been moved to Flanders in February 1917. Initially based at Steenwerck, the following month it shifted north to the Messines area, which was south of Ypres, to relieve the 36th Division.

===Battle of Messines===

By mid-1917, Haig was planning an offensive in the heavily defended Ypres region of Flanders. His plan involved a series of steps, the first of which was the capture of Messines Ridge by II ANZAC Corps. The New Zealand Division, already in the Messines sector, was given the task of capturing Messines Village and it began intensive training for the forthcoming battle under the close supervision of Russell. Extensive preparatory work was carried out, with transportation infrastructure laid down and ample supplies of shells brought forward for the artillery.

The plan of attack, broken into three phases, called for the 2nd and Rifle Brigades to carry out an initial advance to the trenches on the western slopes of the Messines ridge as well as the village itself. The 1st Brigade was then to take over for the second phase and advance to the eastern slope of the ridge, an objective designated the Black Line. The final phase was also to involve the 1st Brigade, which was to push the front line out via a series of outposts, designated the Dotted Black Line. This outpost line would serve as the starting point for the advance of the 4th Australian Division, which was to continue the attack to what was designated as the Green Line, a mile from the crest of the ridge.

Following a preparatory artillery barrage which began on 3 June, the battle commenced in the early hours of 7 June with the explosion of several mines which had been dug under the German lines. Over a million pounds (about 450 tonnes) of explosive were used, and the tremors were felt as far away as London. The New Zealanders were in the centre of the II ANZAC front, flanked by the British 25th Division and the 3rd Australian Division. This marked the first time the Australians and New Zealanders had fought alongside each other in a major engagement on the Western Front. The 2nd and Rifle Brigades quickly moved forward; the surviving German soldiers encountered initially were still dazed from the detonation of the mines and were quickly subdued and made prisoners of war. They continued to advance into stiffening resistance, but these opponents, soldiers of the 40th (Saxon) and 3rd (Bavarian) Divisions, were soon dealt with and the outskirts of Messines village were within sight. The Rifle Brigade&#x27;s 3rd Battalion was attacking the village when it was slowed by two machine gun posts. Corporal Samuel Frickleton led his section on a successful foray to deal with them for which he was later awarded the VC.

As planned, the 1st Brigade reached the Black Line shortly after 5:00 am and began preparing for the next phase of the advance, the establishment of the Dotted Black Line. By 9:00 am, under the cover of a creeping artillery barrage, platoons from the brigade&#x27;s 2nd Auckland Battalion moved forward and formed a series of outposts, some of which were close to the Green Line. They were well dug in by midday, and handily placed to fend off German counterattacks. At 3:00 pm, the advance was continued by the 4th Australian Division, supported by the New Zealand artillery. The 1st Brigade in the meantime consolidated its positions. That evening, aware that the Germans were likely to lay down a retaliatory artillery barrage, Russell ordered that only a minimum number of troops were to remain in Messines and most personnel moved back to their original positions. The next day, the expected barrage began. The New Zealanders remained in position until 9 June, when they were relieved by the 4th Australian Division.

It was a successful operation for the division; all objectives were achieved on schedule, with over 400 Germans, several field guns, and numerous machine guns and trench mortars being captured. Losses in the division amounted to 3,700 casualties, most of which were actually incurred while holding the captured ground. These casualties were inflicted despite Russell&#x27;s attempts to keep the number of soldiers in the front line defences to a minimum and to rely on artillery and machine guns as his primary means for defending against counterattacks. The day after the battle, Russell was visiting the Le Moulin de l&#x27;Hospice, captured by 1st Brigade, when an artillery barrage opened up. This killed the brigade&#x27;s commander, Brigadier General Charles Brown, the first general officer of the NZEF to be killed in action. On 12 June, the division was back manning the front lines to the southeast of Messines, mounting raids and pushing outposts forward into German territory and generally consolidating their positions. It was finally withdrawn from the sector at the end of the month for rest and recuperation.

The division returned to the area in mid-July, tasked with minor operations intended to keep German attention away from the sector north of Ypres, which was to be the focus of renewed fighting as Haig continued with his planned offensive. Russell had his brigades man the division&#x27;s section in rotation; those not in the trenches spent their time training. During this period, the New Zealanders captured the village of La Basseville but subsequently lost it to a German counterattack. At the end of the month, 2nd Wellington Battalion, 1st Brigade, retook the village with Lance-Corporal Leslie Andrew playing a key role in the action; he was later awarded the VC for his efforts. Over the following few weeks the men of the division worked to consolidate their positions in waterlogged trenches, rain having set in. Casualties were still incurred during this period including Brigadier General Johnston, killed by a sniper on 7 August while inspecting his new command, the Rifle Brigade. His replacement, Brigadier General Robert Young, was severely wounded by another sniper just two days later.

===Ypres Offensive===
In September, II ANZAC Corps was detailed for the ongoing offensive in Ypres, the Battle of Passchendaele (also known as the Third Battle of Ypres). Haig wanted Passchendaele Ridge in British hands by winter through a series of limited actions to be carried out across September and October. The initial role of the New Zealand Division was to launch an attack on Gravenstafel Spur, running off the Passchendaele Ridge, as part of what would become known as the Battle of Broodseinde. The attack was part of an overall strategy to capture the ridges running in front of Passchendaele, prior to an attack on the village itself.

====Battle of Broodseinde====

In the weeks leading up to the battle, the division repeatedly practiced the tactics it would employ in its attack on Gravenstafel Spur. When it moved into the front line, its frontage was approximately . The 4th Brigade moved into the southern portion of the line on 2 October. On its right was the 3rd Australian Division, while on its left flank was the 1st Brigade. The 48th Division (of XVIII Corps) was to the left of the 1st Brigade. Together with the 1st Brigade, the 4th Brigade was tasked with two objectives, the Red Line and the Blue Line. The 1st Auckland and Wellington battalions of 1st Brigade, together with the 3rd Auckland and Canterbury battalions of 4th Brigade, were to advance to and secure the Red Line, running along the crest of the ridge. The other two battalions of the respective brigades would then leapfrog their predecessors through the Red Line to take the Blue Line, at the bottom of the Belluvue Spur.

On 4 October, preceded by an artillery barrage beginning at 6:00 am, the division began its offensive with the infantry advancing behind a creeping barrage, which caught a mass of German troops, preparing for their own attack, out in the open. The German infantry, battered by the artillery fire, were swiftly dealt with by the advancing New Zealanders. Despite the presence of pillboxes, the Red Line was reached on schedule, with some limited mopping up operations conducted forward of the line by parties from the advancing battalions. Having moved up to the Red Line behind the attacking forces, at 8:10 am, the next phase of the advance began as infantry from the remaining battalions of 1st and 4th Brigades moved forward to the Blue Line. Despite some resistance from machine gun nests and pockets of infantry sheltering in shell holes, the Blue Line was reached at 9:30 am. Rain began to fall later that afternoon, and the ground quickly became boggy. For the next two days, under the protection of heavy artillery support, both brigades consolidated their positions and established trench lines. The Germans mounted some small-scale counterattacks but these were easily dealt with. From 5 October, the rain began to set in, making movement of men and equipment to the front line difficult. On 6 October, the New Zealanders were relieved by the 49th Division.

The attack was a success with the brigades taking all their objectives on schedule. The 4th Brigade captured 700 prisoners of war, for the loss of 130 men killed, and over 600 wounded. In the 1st Brigade, 192 were killed along with 700 wounded. From its starting positions, the division made gains of around 1,000 metres. Both Godley and Russell were pleased with the outcome and pushed for further involvement by the New Zealand Division in the ongoing offensive.

Buoyed by the success of 4 October, Haig brought forward the next phase of the offensive, the Battle of Poelcappelle, by a day, to 9 October. The British divisions of Godley&#x27;s II ANZAC Corps were to be involved in the initial attack, which was to be followed by an advance on Passchendaele by the New Zealand Division on 12 October.

====First Battle of Passchendaele====
Godley&#x27;s II ANZAC Corps had limited time to prepare for the Battle of Poelcappelle, which was intended to set a good base for an attack on Passchendaele itself by capturing the Belluvue Spur. Its attack proved to be a failure, with no significant advancement of the front lines made by the two British divisions involved, the 49th and 66th Divisions. Several battalions were unable to reach their starting positions by the scheduled time and, once the attack began, they were held up by the mud and German defensive positions. For the sake of a few hundred metres, there were 5,700 casualties. Despite this, Godley, keen for Passchendaele to fall to his II ANZAC Corps, pushed ahead with the 12 October attack. Haig, misled by erroneous reports from Godley&#x27;s headquarters that the Poelcappelle attack had achieved similar gains to those made on 4 October, concurred. Once Haig discovered the error, Godley reassured him that Passchendaele could still fall to his corps. Needing to restore Haig&#x27;s faith in his leadership, Godley disregarded the warnings of his senior artillery and engineer officers that ground conditions were not favourable; the winter rain had set in following Broodseinde and, together with the time constraints, had been a key factor in the compromised preparations for the Poelcappelle attack. The Passchendaele attack, scheduled for 12 October, would likewise be hampered by limited preparation time and boggy terrain.

The attack was to involve the New Zealand Division&#x27;s 2nd and Rifle Brigades, with 4th Brigade in reserve, attacking along Belluvue Spur and onto Goudberg Spur while the 3rd Australian Division, on the right of the New Zealanders, attempted to take Passchendaele itself. On the division&#x27;s left was the 9th (Scottish) Division. The plan required both New Zealand brigades to advance with a one-battalion frontage, with three battalions of each brigade leapfrogging each other in sequence to capture objectives designated Red, Blue and Green lines, the last of which was Goudberg Spur.

The New Zealanders had a number of preparatory hurdles to overcome before the battle. The men of the Rifle Brigade had, for the previous few weeks, been carrying out engineering work for II ANZAC Corps and were fatigued. The ongoing rainfall affected both the roads by which the division had to move to its starting positions and the placement of the supporting artillery. The muddy ground did not provide a stable platform for the guns and howitzers. Furthermore, the artillery barrage targeting the barbed wire emplacements protecting the strongpoints on the slopes of Belluvue Spur failed to destroy them, a fact determined by scouts on 11 October. Once this information reached the brigade commanders, Braithwaite and A. E. Stewart, the commander of the Rifle Brigade following Young&#x27;s wounding, they pressed Russell for cancellation of the attack; this was refused.

Early in the morning of 12 October, the Germans, already on the alert, bombarded the areas where the New Zealand infantry were assembling prior to commencing their advance. This, along with several rounds of New Zealander artillery that fell short, inflicted numerous casualties until the New Zealanders completed their barrage at 5:25 am and began moving forward. Their advance was slowed by ground conditions and machine gun fire from both their front and flanks. They stalled after reaching the wire, arranged in two belts. The following battalions began to catch up to the leading unit, the 2nd Otago Battalion, filling its depleted ranks, but were also held up by the wire. Some parties, led by subalterns and non-commissioned officers, managed to breach the wire and attack the German pillboxes beyond, but when their leaders were killed, the survivors began to dig in. It was 8:00 am and the front line had been advanced by barely .

By mid-morning, it was apparent that the failure of the New Zealanders to advance their section of the front exposed the left flank of the neighbouring 3rd Australian Division, which had secured its first objective and was pushing on to its second. Likewise, on the New Zealand Division&#x27;s left, the 9th (Scottish) Division had managed to reach its final objective. Godley issued new instructions to the New Zealand Division; abandoning any hope of getting to the Green Line, it was to push on to the Blue Line in an attack timed for 3:00 pm. However, by the early afternoon the flanking Scots had been pushed back while the Australians had failed to make further gains and were withdrawing due to enfilade gunfire on the flanks. Braithwaite, warned by his battalion commanders that capturing the Blue Line was impossible, twice pushed Russell for a cancellation of the attack. Russell&#x27;s initial response was to instruct the Rifle Brigade to continue, but shortly before the attack was to begin, it was abandoned.

The 4th Brigade moved up to the line to relieve the 2nd and Rifle Brigades and remained there until the division was withdrawn to a training area in late October, following the relief of II ANZAC Corps by the Canadian Corps. The division suffered heavy losses on 12 October: about 845 men were killed and a further 1,900 wounded in the worst defeat in New Zealand military history. Although Russell blamed himself for the outcome of the attack and wrote to politicians in New Zealand stating so, in his private correspondence he made it clear that planning and preparation by Godley and his staff at II ANZAC Corps was inadequate and did not take into account the poor ground conditions at Passchendaele.

===Winter 1917–18===

On 1 November 1917, II ANZAC Corps&#x27; 3rd Australian Division was transferred to I ANZAC Corps. As this left the New Zealand Division as the sole representative of the ANZAC divisions in II ANZAC Corps, it was renamed to XXII Corps. The renamed corps returned to the Ypres salient in mid-November 1917, holding a five-mile front along Broodseinde Ridge from the village of Tiber to the Reutelbeek stream. The New Zealand Division took the right sector of this front which was overlooked by a spur topped by the ruined Polderhoek Chateau, occupied by the Germans. On 3 December, the 1st Canterbury and 1st Otago Battalions of the 2nd Brigade mounted an attack against the chateau. The attack, launched at midday in an attempt to surprise the Germans, proved a relative failure; although some ground was taken, the chateau remained in enemy hands. During this action, Private Henry James Nicholas dealt with a machine gun post that was holding up the advance of his company, and won the VC. Having advanced its front by , the brigade consolidated its positions until it was withdrawn two days later and replaced by units from IX Corps.

At this stage of the war, Braithwaite, a popular commander, was temporarily in charge of the division while Russell was on leave. The last of the brigade commanders who had embarked with the NZEF in 1914, he was worn out and in January was evacuated to England for treatment. On recovery, Braithwaite rejoined his original British Army regiment rather than returning to the division. There were rumours amongst the soldiers of the division that this was a punishment for his refusal to carry on with the 12 October attack at Passchendaele.

By February 1918, the losses in the New Zealand Division resulted in the disbandment of the 4th Brigade. When it was originally formed, New Zealand&#x27;s prime minister, William Massey, felt that New Zealand was already contributing more than its fair share to the war effort, and he determined that no additional reinforcements would be sent to maintain the brigade; if needed, it would be broken up to supply divisional replacements. Consequently, the brigade&#x27;s personnel were redistributed amongst the remaining formations to bring them up to strength. The surplus troops formed the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Entrenching Battalions, one for each brigade, and this provided a pool of trained reinforcements for the division. In other organisational changes, a divisional machine gun battalion was formed from the companies belonging to each brigade while the New Zealand Pioneer Battalion divested itself of its squadron of Otago Mounted Rifles to leave a unit with solely Māori personnel, apart from its senior officers. This was designated the New Zealand Māori (Pioneer) Battalion.

===Spring Offensive===

On 21 March, the Germans launched their Spring Offensive which involved 60 divisions advancing across a front of . The Allies were quickly pushed back and a gap formed between the Third and Fifth Armies through which the Germans penetrated. The New Zealand Division was out of the line, recuperating following its tour of duty in the trenches over the winter months, and was deployed to cover a gap which had developed between IV and V Corps at the old Somme battlefield. After moving rapidly to the front, it was positioned at Hamel by 26 March and from there linked up with the 4th Australian Division. For the next several days, the New Zealanders dug in while fending off multiple advances by the Germans. They were initially without artillery support; the infantry had been able to move much more quickly to the front. The artillery began arriving by the evening of 27 March. Supplies took longer to arrive and as rain began to fall on 28 March, many soldiers were without wet weather gear.

The New Zealanders&#x27; defensive positions had been improved despite the weather and the harassment from German artillery, which killed Fulton, the original commander of the Rifle Brigade, when a barrage targeted his headquarters. The division undertook the first offensive action by the British forces during the Spring Offensive when three battalions seized the high ground of La Signy farm on 30 March. This success, although relatively trivial to the New Zealanders, was a morale booster for the rest of the beleaguered Third Army.

The Germans launched a renewed effort to push through to Amiens on 5 April, two armies attacking across the front of the British Third Army. The New Zealanders experienced a heavy bombardment which began at 5:00 am which cut off communications and later that day suffered two separate but disorganised attacks by infantry. The first was fended off but the second recaptured La Signy farm. An attempt to push on to the main trenches of the New Zealanders was rebuffed with heavy losses inflicted by the Wellington Company of the Machine Gun Battalion.

By 9 April, the pressure was decreasing on the New Zealand positions as the Germans shifted their offensive north to the area around Armentières. While the bulk of the New Zealand Division remained on the Somme and consolidated its defences, some of its artillery went to reinforce the British forces bearing the brunt of the renewed German attacks. Casualties for this period of the war were high; nearly 1,000 of the division&#x27;s personnel were killed through March and April and almost 2,700 were wounded.

The New Zealand Division continued to man its trenches along its section of the Somme front and regularly mounted trench raids. To the amusement of the New Zealanders, the German soldiers manning the trenches opposite were warned to avoid being captured because they might be eaten. In June, the division was withdrawn to Authie. The New Zealanders returned to the Somme front in early July, and settled into a sector east of Hébuterne that included Rossignol Wood. As with the division&#x27;s previous stint on the Somme, trench raids were often carried out. During a raid mounted on 23 July, Sergeant Richard Travis performed actions that led to a posthumous award of the VC; he was killed the next day. A prominent soldier and renowned for his scouting skills, his death was mourned across the division.

===Hundred Days&#x27; Offensive===

On 8 August 1918, the last major offensive of the Western Front commenced. It began with an attack by the Canadian and Australian Corps at Amiens, which rolled the German lines back that day. The advance petered out after four days after the Germans began to regroup and shore up their defences. Haig recognised that it was time to put pressure elsewhere on the German front and for this, decided to use General Julian Byng&#x27;s Third Army. The New Zealand Division would continually be at the forefront of the advance of the Third Army for the remainder of the offensive. At this stage of the war, the New Zealand Division was still one of the strongest infantry divisions of the Dominion serving on the Western Front. It numbered 12,243 men and there were 15,000 reinforcements in England. Aided by the fact that New Zealand introduced conscription in August 1916, the continuous supply of reinforcements prevented it from suffering the reduction in the number of battalions that affected the British and Australian divisions as their manpower reserves dried up. As the division advanced, it usually did so along a brigade-sized front, with three battalions forward of a field artillery brigade. This allowed for rapid artillery support as the need arose. The brigades would leapfrog each other as they moved forward.

The New Zealand Division&#x27;s initial involvement in the offensive was on 21 August, when it joined four other divisions of the Third Army in an attack across a front from Puiseux towards the Albert-Arras railway. Its role was relatively minor in this action but a few days afterwards, the division played a significant part in what is now known as the Second Battle of Bapaume. The battle began on 24 August with a nighttime advance by the 1st and 2nd Brigades to clear the approaches to Bapaume, including Loupart Wood and Grévillers. Progress was delayed by heavy machine gun fire and artillery took its toll on supporting tanks. On 29 August, Bapaume itself was captured by the New Zealanders when, after a heavy artillery barrage, they attacked into the town at the same time the Germans were withdrawing. The village of Frémicourt fell the following day.

The New Zealand Division continued to advance, with the 2nd Brigade capturing Haplincourt on 3 September following a failed attempt the previous day. It moved onto the outer defences of the Hindenburg Line, including Trescault Spur, which overlooked the German positions. In conjunction with 37th Division and elements of the 38th Division, the New Zealanders attacked the spur on 12 September. The crest of the spur was captured, although not the trench system on the far side.

After two weeks out of the line, the division attacked the Hindenburg Line itself on 29 September, easily achieving its objectives and capturing 1,000 prisoners. With the New Zealanders on the St. Quentin Canal and the adjacent Scheldt River, a platoon had managed to cross it and reach the village of Crèvecœur. However, it became pinned down until the 1st Auckland and 2nd Wellington Battalions of the 1st Brigade managed to cross the next day and capture the village.

On 8 October, IV Corps attacked Cambrai, to which the Germans had withdrawn after they abandoned their defences along the St. Quentin Canal. The New Zealand Division&#x27;s contribution was from the 2nd and Rifle Brigades, both of which easily achieved their objectives. In advance of their flanking units, they were handily placed to intervene when the Germans mounted a counterattack against the adjacent British 2nd Division. By 12 October, the division had advanced nearly , including a crossing of the Selle River, and had captured 1,400 prisoners and 13 field guns. Its own casualties amounted to 536 men. It withdrew from the front line for a brief rest before returning to the front on 20 October.

By the end of October, the New Zealand Division was positioned to the west of the fortified town of Le Quesnoy. On 4 November, the next phase of the Allied advance began with the Battle of the Sambre. The division was tasked with the capture of Le Quesnoy and extending the front line past the town. The Rifle Brigade encircled and, through the achievement of its 4th Battalion in scaling the ramparts that surrounded the town, pushed into Le Quesnoy by the close of the day while the 1st Brigade had established a line to the east. This was the division&#x27;s most successful day on the Western Front.

The day after the fall of Le Quesnoy, elements of the division moved through the Mormal Forest with the 1st Canterbury and 2nd Otago Battalions of the 2nd Brigade leading the way. As well as covering over , they attacked and captured two houses occupied by German forces. Twenty men were killed in this last contact with the enemy, which marked the last offensive action of the division; it was relieved that night. During the Hundred Days&#x27; Offensive, it had advanced in 75 days. It was moving into reserve at Beauvois-en-Cambrésis, in the rear area of IV Corps, when the Armistice was signed on 11 November.

==Occupation duties and disbandment==

The New Zealand Division was chosen to form part of the Allied occupation force in Germany, to the displeasure of some personnel who had expected to return home. By mid-December it had begun moving through Belgium towards Cologne where it arrived on 20 December. Billeted in the city&#x27;s suburbs, the division remained on active duty when not sightseeing. Educational programs were also implemented. Demobilisation began towards the end of December with the departure of those who had enlisted in 1914 or 1915. The first unit to leave the division was the Pioneer Battalion, and additional men were sent to England on leave. They remained there until transportation to New Zealand could be arranged. Russell had taken ill in late January and departed for the warmer climate of Southern France, leaving the division&#x27;s artillery commander, Brigadier General G. Johnston, in charge of the division. The artillery was demobilised on 18 March 1919, with the division formally disbanded on 25 March 1919. Its occupation duties were taken up by the British 2nd Division.

==Memorials==

After the war, the New Zealand government instituted four national battlefield memorials to honour the New Zealand soldiers who died on the Western Front. The overwhelming majority of these fatalities, around 12,400, were men from the New Zealand Division. The memorials, designed by Samuel Hurst Seager, are located at Passchendaele, Messines, Le Quesnoy and the Somme. Each memorial includes the words &quot;From the Uttermost Ends of the Earth&quot;. In contrast to other Dominions, the names of New Zealand soldiers with no known grave, of which there are about 4,180, are not listed on the Memorials to the Missing at Menin Gate and Thiepval. Instead, it was the policy of the New Zealand government to establish smaller Memorials to the Missing in cemeteries near where the soldiers went missing, one of which is at the Buttes New British Cemetery while another is at the Messines Ridge British Cemetery.

<text>Pia mater ( or ), often referred to as simply the pia, is the delicate innermost layer of the meninges, the membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord. &quot;Pia mater&quot; is medieval Latin meaning &quot;tender mother&quot;. The other two meningeal membranes are the dura mater and the arachnoid mater. Both the pia and arachnoid mater are derivatives of the neural crest while the dura is derived from embryonic mesoderm. The pia mater is a thin fibrous tissue that is permeable to water and small solutes. The pia mater allows blood vessels to pass through and nourish the brain. The perivascular space between blood vessels and pia mater is proposed to be part of a pseudolymphatic system for the brain (glymphatic system). When the pia mater becomes irritated and inflamed the result is meningitis.

==Structure==
Pia mater is the thin, translucent, mesh-like meningeal envelope, spanning nearly the entire surface of the brain. It is absent only at the natural openings between the ventricles, the median aperture, and the lateral aperture. The pia firmly adheres to the surface of the brain and loosely connects to the arachnoid layer. Because of this continuum, the layers are often referred to as the pia arachnoid or leptomeninges. A subarachnoid space exists between the arachnoid layer and the pia, into which the choroid plexus releases and maintains the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The subarachnoid space contains trabeculae, or fibrous filaments, that connect and bring stability to the two layers, allowing for the appropriate protection from and movement of the proteins, electrolytes, ions, and glucose contained within the CSF.

The thin membrane is composed of fibrous connective tissue, which is covered by a sheet of flat cells impermeable to fluid on its outer surface. A network of blood vessels travels to the brain and spinal cord by interlacing through the pia membrane. These capillaries are responsible for nourishing the brain. This vascular membrane is held together by areolar tissue covered by mesothelial cells from the delicate strands of connective tissue called the arachnoid trabeculae. In the perivascular spaces, the pia mater begins as mesothelial lining on the outer surface, but the cells then fade to be replaced by neuroglia elements.

Although the pia mater is primarily structurally similar throughout, it spans both the spinal cord&#x27;s neural tissue and runs down the fissures of the cerebral cortex in the brain. It is often broken down into two categories, the cranial pia mater (pia mater encephali) and the spinal pia mater (pia mater spinalis).

===Cranial pia mater===

The section of the pia mater enveloping the brain is known as the cranial pia mater. It is anchored to the brain by the processes of astrocytes, which are glial cells responsible for many functions, including maintenance of the extracellular space. The cranial pia mater joins with the ependyma, which lines the cerebral ventricles to form choroid plexuses that produce cerebrospinal fluid. Together with the other meningeal layers, the function of the pia mater is to protect the central nervous system by containing the cerebrospinal fluid, which cushions the brain and spine.

The cranial pia mater covers the surface of the brain. This layer goes in between the cerebral gyri and cerebellar laminae, folding inward to create the tela chorioidea of the third ventricle and the choroid plexuses of the lateral and third ventricles. At the level of the cerebellum, the pia mater membrane is more fragile due to the length of blood vessels as well as decreased connection to the cerebral cortex.

===Spinal pia mater===
The spinal pia mater closely follows and encloses the curves of the spinal cord, and is attached to it through a connection to the anterior fissure. The pia mater attaches to the dura mater through 21 pairs of denticulate ligaments that pass through the arachnoid mater and dura mater of the spinal cord. These denticular ligaments help to anchor the spinal cord and prevent side to side movement, providing stability. The membrane in this area is much thicker than the cranial pia mater, due to the two-layer composition of the pia membrane. The outer layer, which is made up of mostly connective tissue, is responsible for this thickness. Between the two layers are spaces which exchange information with the subarachnoid cavity as well as blood vessels. At the point where the pia mater reaches the conus medullaris or medullary cone at the end of the spinal cord, the membrane extends as a thin filament called the filum terminale or terminal filum, contained within the lumbar cistern. This filament eventually blends with the dura mater and extends as far as the coccyx, or tailbone. It then fuses with the periosteum, a membrane found at the surface of all bones, and forms the coccygeal ligament. There it is called the central ligament and assists with movements of the trunk of the body.

==Function==
In conjunction with the other meningeal membranes, pia mater functions to cover and protect the central nervous system (CNS), to protect the blood vessels and enclose the venous sinuses near the CNS, to contain the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and to form partitions with the skull. The CSF, pia mater, and other layers of the meninges work together as a protection device for the brain, with the CSF often referred to as the fourth layer of the meninges.

===CSF production and circulation===
Cerebrospinal fluid is circulated through the ventricles, cisterns, and subarachnoid space within the brain and spinal cord. About 150 mL of CSF is always in circulation, constantly being recycled through the daily production of nearly 500 mL of fluid. The CSF is primarily secreted by the choroid plexus; however, about one-third of the CSF is secreted by pia mater and the other ventricular ependymal surfaces (the thin epithelial membrane lining the brain and central canal) and arachnoidal membranes. The CSF travels from the ventricles and cerebellum through three foramina in the brain, emptying into the cerebrum, and ending its cycle in the venous blood via structures like the arachnoid granulations. The pia spans every surface crevice of the brain other than the foramina to allow the circulation of CSF to continue.

===Perivascular spaces===
Pia mater allows for the formation of perivascular spaces that help serve as the brain&#x27;s lymphatic system. Blood vessels that penetrate the brain first pass across the surface and then go inwards toward the brain. This direction of flow leads to a layer of the pia mater being carried inwards and loosely adhering to the vessels, leading to the production of a space, namely a perivascular space, between the pia mater and each blood vessel. This is critical because the brain lacks a true lymphatic system. In the remainder of the body, small amounts of protein are able to leak from the parenchymal capillaries through the lymphatic system. In the brain, this ends up in the interstitial space. The protein portions are able to leave through the very permeable pia mater and enter the subarachnoid space in order to flow in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), eventually ending up in the cerebral veins. The pia mater serves to create these perivascular spaces to allow passage of certain material, such as fluids, proteins, and even extraneous particulate matter such as dead white blood cells from the blood stream to the CSF, and essentially the brain.

===Permeability===
Due to the pia mater&#x27;s and the ependyma&#x27;s high permeability, water and small molecules in the CSF are able to enter the brain interstitial fluid, so the interstitial brain fluid and the CSF are very similar in terms of composition. However, regulation of this permeability is achieved through the abundant number of astrocyte endfeet processes which are responsible for connecting the capillaries and the pia mater in a way that helps limit the amount of free diffusion going into the CNS.

The function of the pia mater is more simply visualized through these ordinary occurrences. This last property is evident in cases of head injury. When the head comes into contact with another object, the brain is protected from the skull due to the similarity in density between these two fluids so that the brain does not simply smash through into the skull, but rather its movement is slowed and stopped by the viscous ability of this fluid. The contrast in permeability between the pia mater and the blood–brain barrier means that many drugs that enter the blood stream cannot enter the brain, but instead must be administered into the cerebrospinal fluid.

===Spinal cord compression===
The pia mater also functions to deal with the deformation of the spinal cord under compression. Due to the high elastic modulus of the pia mater, it is able to provide a constraint on the surface of the spinal cord. This constraint stops the elongation of the spinal cord, as well as providing a high strain energy. This high strain energy is useful and responsible for the restoration of the spinal cord to its original shape following a period of decompression.

===Sensory===
Ventral root afferents are unmyelinated sensory axons located within the pia mater. These ventral root afferents relay sensory information from the pia mater and allow for the transmission of pain from disc herniation and other spinal injury.

==Evolution==
The significant increase in the size of the cerebral hemisphere through evolution has been made possible in part through the evolution of the vascular pia mater, which allows nutrient blood vessels to penetrate deep into the intertwined cerebral matter, providing the necessary nutrients in this larger neural mass. Throughout the course of life on earth, the nervous system of animals has continued to evolve to a more compact and increased organization of neurons and other nervous system cells. This process is most evident in vertebrates and especially mammals in which the increased size of the brain is generally condensed into a smaller space through the presence of sulci or fissures on the surface of the hemisphere divided into gyri allowing more superficies of the cortical grey matter to exist. The development of the meninges and the existence of a defined pia mater was first noted in the vertebrates, and has been more and more significant membrane in the brains of mammals with larger brains.

==Pathology==
Meningitis is the inflammation of the pia and arachnoid mater. This is often due to bacteria that have entered the subarachnoid space, but can also be caused by viruses, fungi, as well as non-infectious causes such as certain drugs. It is believed that bacterial meningitis is caused by bacteria that enter the central nervous system through the blood stream. The molecular tools these pathogens would require to cross the meningeal layers and the blood–brain barrier are not yet well understood. Inside the subarachnoid, bacteria replicate and cause inflammation from released toxins such as hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) . These toxins have been found to damage the mitochondria and produce a large scale immune response. Headache and meningismus are often signs of inflammation relayed via trigeminal sensory nerve fibers within the pia mater. Disabling neuropsychological effects are seen in up to half of bacterial meningitis survivors. Research into how bacteria invade and enter the meningeal layers is the next step in prevention of the progression of meningitis.

A tumor growing from the meninges is referred to as a meningioma. Most meningiomas grow from the arachnoid mater inward applying pressure on the pia mater and therefore the brain or spinal cord. While meningiomas make up 20% of primary brain tumors and 12% of spinal cord tumors, 90% of these tumors are benign. Meningiomas tend to grow slowly and therefore symptoms may arise years after initial tumor formation. The symptoms often include headaches and seizures due to the force the tumor creates on sensory receptors. The treatments available for these tumors include surgery and radiation.

<doc id="455243" wikidata="Q308950" url="?curid=455243" title="Ash Ketchum">
<text>Ash Ketchum, known as in Japan, is a character in the &quot;Pokémon&quot; franchise owned by Nintendo, Game Freak, and Creatures. He was the protagonist of the &quot;Pokémon&quot; anime for the first 25 seasons, as well as the protagonist of several manga series. In Japanese, the character is voiced by Rica Matsumoto. In the English dub, he was voiced by Veronica Taylor in the first eight seasons and Sarah Natochenny afterwards. Ash is a young man who travels with various companions, aiming to fulfill his dream to become a Pokémon Master; his Pokémon lineup constantly changes over the course of the series, with its sole constant member being Pikachu, Ash&#x27;s first Pokémon. Ash is loosely based on Red, the player character from the Generation I games &quot;Pokémon Red&quot; and &quot;Blue&quot;. Satoshi Tajiri, the creator of &quot;Pokémon&quot;, has stated that Ash represents the &#x27;human aspect&#x27; of the series, and that Ash reflects what he himself was like as a child.

Ash has been criticized for being stuck in a &#x27;floating timeline&#x27;, as well as for his long-lasting inability to win many major Pokémon League competitions in the series. However, his longevity and persistence have also been positively received, and his character has received attention for teaching important and relatable lessons to children. Ash ultimately became Alola League Champion in &quot;Pokémon the Series: Sun &amp; Moon – Ultra Legends&quot;, and World Champion in &quot;Pokémon Ultimate Journeys: The Series&quot;.

Due to the huge popularity, success, and longevity of the &quot;Pokémon&quot; anime series around the world since its debut, Ash has gone on to become one of the most well-known and recognizable fictional characters of all time. He is considered a pop culture icon and a figurehead character of the wave of anime in the late 1990s. He has been used extensively in merchandise for the series.

==Conception and design==
Ash was designed by Atsuko Nishida, and named after creator Satoshi Tajiri. The character was designed to represent how Tajiri was as a child, obsessed with catching bugs. During localization of both for North American audiences, the character&#x27;s name was changed in the anime to &quot;Ash Ketchum&quot;, the first name taken from one of the possible default names players could select for the player character in &quot;Pokémon Red&quot; and &quot;Blue&quot;, and the surname tying into the tagline for the series, &quot;Gotta catch &#x27;em all!&quot;. He is loosely based on Red, the player character of &quot;Pokémon Red and Blue&quot;.

Tajiri noted in an interview that between Japanese and US reactions to the series, Japanese consumers focused on the character Pikachu, while the US purchased more items featuring Ash and Pikachu, his Pokémon, together. He stated that he felt the character represented the human aspect of the franchise, and was thus a necessity. The character was given a rival named Gary Oak (Shigeru Okido in the Japanese version, after Tajiri&#x27;s idol/mentor Shigeru Miyamoto), loosely based on Red&#x27;s rival Blue. In an interview Tajiri noted the contrast between the characters&#x27; relationship in the games and anime; while in the games they were rivals, in the anime, Shigeru represented Satoshi&#x27;s master. When asked if Satoshi would equal or surpass Shigeru, Tajiri replied &quot;No! Never!&quot; Ash&#x27;s character design was initially overseen by Sayuri Ichishi, replaced by Toshiya Yamada during the &quot;Diamond &amp; Pearl&quot; series of the anime. Ash received a redesign in the &quot;Best Wishes!&quot; series, which included larger brown irises. In the &quot;XY&quot; series, he received minor changes, such as a decrease in the size of the thunderbolt shaped &#x27;birthmarks&#x27; on his cheeks. Ash received a major design overhaul for the &quot;Sun&quot; &quot;&amp;&quot; &quot;Moon&quot; anime series.

===Voice actors===

In Japan, Rica Matsumoto has provided the original Japanese voice of Ash since the series&#x27; start. Matsumoto highlighted a past experience in which she recorded a message for a hospitalized child as the character, which she stated caused her to feel &quot;more aware of the work I was putting out there.&quot; This caused her to change her approach to voicing the character. Her role has been considered highly iconic. Matsumoto voiced Ash as a kind character, and stated that she did not stray away from that portrayal in her performance, even under special circumstances. Hana Takeda briefly voiced the role in &quot;Pokémon Journeys: The Series&quot;, portraying Ash when he was a child.

For the English dubbing, Veronica Taylor provided the voice of Ash in the first eight seasons of the &quot;Pokémon&quot; anime, which was dubbed by 4Kids Entertainment. At the time of her audition, Taylor stated that the character was temporarily named Casey. After the script was translated from Japanese, the lines were adapted to fit the movements of the character&#x27;s mouth (called &quot;lip flap&quot;). All the voices were recorded separately, so Taylor was the only one in the booth when she recorded her lines, which took approximately six to eight hours per episode. Taylor was often the first person to record, so she had to &quot;imagine how the previous line will be said&quot;. A director worked with Taylor to help with interpretation of the line, as well as matching with the lip flap and voice consistency. Taylor enjoyed playing Ash because of his &quot;low, husky voice&quot; and &quot;energy and excitement&quot;. Taylor was first introduced to the role via a brief voice clip from the Japanese airing. The job moved quickly, and Taylor&#x27;s past acting experience allowed her to embody the role in the time allotted for recording.

Taylor commented that Ash and the other characters &quot;loosened up&quot; after the first ten episodes of the anime; she believed the writers were more relaxed and no longer felt the pressure of making sure everything was done correctly. Taylor commented: &quot;I enjoy playing Ash now much more than I did in the very beginning because I can have fun with him more, and we kind of know him and can work out how he really would react. We have the classic Ash responses and things like that.&quot; Sarah Natochenny replaced Taylor in season nine when The Pokémon Company International (known at that time as Pokémon USA) took over the licensing, prompting a shift in recording studios. Natochenney has cited Matsumoto&#x27;s performance as inspiration for her performance as Ash.

==Appearances==
===In the anime===
Ash first appears in the anime&#x27;s first episode, &quot;Pokémon, I Choose You!&quot;. The episode takes place on Ash&#x27;s tenth birthday as he wakes up late to receive his first Pokémon, resulting in the Professor, Oak, giving Ash a rebellious Pikachu. Ash and Pikachu bond after Pikachu saves Ash from an angry Spearow flock, and the pair become close friends. Ash acts as the main character of every series of the anime up until &quot;Pokémon Horizons: The Series&quot;.

Ash travels with many traveling companions throughout the series, starting with the characters Brock and Misty in the original series. His companions tend to rotate throughout the series, as do his Pokémon, with Ash tending to leave most of his Pokémon (Barring Pikachu) in Oak&#x27;s care when he visits a new region. Ash also comes into conflict with the criminal organization Team Rocket, primarily in the form of the trio of Jessie, James, and their talking Meowth. While the trio are primarily depicted as comic relief, they often attempt to capture Pikachu in various schemes in order to send it to their boss, Giovanni. Ash also frequently goes up against &quot;rival&quot; characters, such as his former childhood best friend, Gary Oak.

Ash&#x27;s main goal is to become a &quot;Pokémon Master&quot;, and as a result often attempts to defeat the Pokémon Leaguea competition of the strongest Trainers in a given regionin whatever region he is in. Though his attempts are typically unsuccessful, he eventually succeeded in becoming a regional Champion in &quot;Pokémon the Series: Sun &amp; Moon – Ultra Legends&quot;, and later became ranked as the &quot;Monarch&quot;, of the Pokémon World Coronation tournament in &quot;Pokémon Ultimate Journeys: The Series&quot;, dethroning Leon to become recognized as the strongest Pokémon Trainer in the world. He also successfully defeated all of the Battle Frontier&#x27;s Frontier Brains in &quot;Pokémon: Battle Frontier&quot;, and became Honored Trainer of the Orange Islands in &quot;Pokémon: Adventures in the Orange Islands&quot;.

===In the video games and manga===
Ash appeared in &quot;Pokémon Puzzle League&quot;, acting as the game&#x27;s main playable character. In &quot;Pokémon Sun&quot; and &quot;Moon&quot;&#x27;s demo, the player receives a letter from Ash, along with his Greninja, which is capable of assuming its &quot;Ash-Greninja&quot; form through its ability Battle Bond. Ash also makes a cameo in the Abandoned Thrifty Megamart location in the main game, where a blurry photo of him and his Pikachu is plastered on a wall in the back room. Ash later appeared as an unlockable Sync Pair in &quot;Pokémon Masters EX&quot;, where he is paired with Pikachu.

Ash appeared in the manga series &quot;The Electric Tale of Pikachu&quot;, and &quot;Ash &amp; Pikachu,&quot; which follow similar plots to the main anime. Manga author Toshihiro Ono cited Ash as one of his favorite characters to draw for the series, stating, &quot;I want to go on a trip with Misty just like him! (And forget about job, rent, etc.)&quot;.

==Critical reception==

The book &quot;The Japanification of Children&#x27;s Popular Culture&quot; cited Ash as an example of cultural identification, with the character going through similar motions players of the games had to in order to progress through them. It additionally emphasized the character&#x27;s growth and development as the anime series progressed. &quot;The Guinness Book of World Records 2011 Gamer&#x27;s Edition&quot; lists Ash as coming 37th out of 50 in a readers&#x27; poll of their favorite video game characters. Ash has been described as a &quot;truly admirable hero&quot; who develops as the show goes along, with his willingness to delay his own goals in favor of helping others being highlighted.

Ash&#x27;s role in the anime has received a positive response overall. &quot;IGN&quot;, in a retrospective for the series, highlighted how Ash&#x27;s divergence from the games helped the anime come into its own as a series. They described Ash&#x27;s character as &quot;trustworthy and reliable&quot; and his role in the series as &quot;comforting&quot;. His friendship with his Pokémon has also been highlighted as a part of his appeal, being compared to Aristotle&#x27;s virtues of friendship. Pikachu saving Ash from the Spearow flock in the first episode helped to establish &quot;a level of equality&quot; between the two characters, highlighting the idea of how a reciprocal friendship helped ensure further success. Their &quot;symbiotic&quot; relationship was described as a reason for the &quot;personal flourishing&quot; of Ash as a character. His interactions with his friends and companions have also been described as having helped build the dramatic core of the series as a whole. The relationship between Serena and Ash has also created a fan community of people who ship them together, with the ship name being called &quot;AmourShipping,&quot; with speculation being made that Serena and Ash would end up together.

Ash has also garnered praise for serving as a role-model to children by sources such as &quot;Business Insider&quot; Australia and the BBC. Kat Bailey, writing for &quot;VG247&quot;, highlighted this as a part of both Ash and the Pokémon anime&#x27;s success, stating that &quot;Pokémon set out to teach kids the meaning of fair play, good sportsmanship, and perseverance. Whenever Ash got knocked down, he would pick himself up again, dust himself off, and keep doggedly pursuing his goals.&quot; Ash&#x27;s defeat in his first tournament was praised, due to his inability to raise his Charizard resulting in his loss. It was highlighted as both teaching a valuable and relatable lesson to children watching the show, as well as allowing them to become further invested in Ash&#x27;s character in order to see if &quot;he&#x27;d become good enough to win next time.&quot;

Ash&#x27;s role in the series has also been criticized. The character&#x27;s constant losses were highlighted by &quot;IGN&quot;, who stated that, &quot;The Pokemon show has become so successful and been so consistent for so long that it&#x27;s like its hero is never, ever going to be allowed to actually finish what he started. If Ash ever won, it&#x27;d be over. If he ever actually became a League Champion in the series, that would be it. The end. How could the story go on? It couldn&#x27;t. And so every time he gets close, the writers make sure he falls short.&quot; They also criticized the &quot;floating timeline&quot; the character was stuck in. Ash&#x27;s journey never ending was also criticized due to its formula being unable to reach &quot;a proper conclusion&quot;. However, Ash&#x27;s constant setbacks have also been met positively, being highlighted as a way to teach relatable stories and lessons to children. Daniel Dockery, commenting on Ash&#x27;s departure from the series while writing for &quot;Polygon&quot;, highlighted this inability to win as a central part of Ash&#x27;s character, believing it to be a valuable lesson that was &quot;relatable for everything from going to a new, unfamiliar school to experiencing defeat in a sport&quot;. They stated that Ash&#x27;s indefinite style of journeying provided a sense of comfort to returning fans, while also symbolizing the Pokémon series&#x27; core themes. The book &quot;Monster Kids: How Pokémon Taught a Generation to Catch Em All&quot;, highlighted Ash&#x27;s role, citing him as a constant and comforting companion to viewers due to his longevity, and as being a character that &quot;each new generation of Pokémon fans could relate to.&quot;

The character&#x27;s farewell from the series drew a massive response, with the hashtag &quot;#ThankYouAshAndPikachu&quot; trending on Twitter following the announcement of the character&#x27;s departure from the series. &quot;GamesRadar+&quot; highlighted Ash&#x27;s significant impact on the series, stating that &quot;New Pokemon might grace my screen, but Ash and Pikachu would be an unchanging presence, anchoring not only the show, but the entire franchise. It won&#x27;t matter in a big way, but I&#x27;m quietly devastated that now, they won&#x27;t be there anymore.&quot; Kenneth Sheperd, writing for &quot;Kotaku&quot;, wrote about Ash&#x27;s longevity as a character and his influence over many generations of children, highlighting his departure as a sad one. He stated that &quot;For fans, myself included, Ash symbolizes learning about who you are in a world that feels vast and unknowable at a young age, and that the journey to learn about this world is best taken together. I don&#x27;t know many people who watched Ash&#x27;s story unfold in its entirety, but every &quot;Pokémon&quot; fan I know has taken that spirit with them as they&#x27;ve embarked on their own journeys.&quot; It drew minor criticism, with &quot;Polygon&quot; highlighting the retirement of the character as &quot;evolution by forced means of companies seeking a branding revamp rather than the conclusion of a satisfying and coherent emotional arc&quot;. &quot;The Radio Times&quot; cited, however, that the change was a positive one, as despite Ash&#x27;s iconicity, &quot;If Ash can&#x27;t grow, how can the show itself evolve and develop? It&#x27;s admirable how long Pokémon has managed to recycle the same themes and ideas, but even with new generations of cute little pocket monsters to catch, there&#x27;s only so long we could have watched Ash lose his tournaments over and over again.&quot;

<doc id="455250" wikidata="Q1315081" url="?curid=455250" title="HMS Gladiator (1896)">
<text>HMS &quot;Gladiator&quot; was a second class protected cruiser of the Royal Navy, launched on 8 December 1896 at Portsmouth, England. She was of the rated at displacement, with a crew of 250 officers and men. She had three distinctive stacks amidships with a conspicuous bridge well forward.

==Service history==
&quot;Gladiator&quot; was ordered to be commissioned at Portsmouth on 15 February 1900 to take out relief crews for the Australia Station.

She served with the Mediterranean Squadron under the command of Captain Frederick Owen Pike, when she visited Larnaka in June 1902, and Lemnos in August 1902. Captain T. B. S. Adair was appointed in command on 22 September 1902.

==Collision==

During a late snowstorm off the Isle of Wight on 25 April 1908, &quot;Gladiator&quot; was heading into port when she struck the outbound American steamer . Visibility was down to , but the strong tides and gale force winds required both ships to maintain high speeds to maintain steerage.

Lookouts on each vessel saw the approaching danger off Hurst Point. The American ship attempted to pass to the port side, the standard procedure in such a situation. Lacking room for the manoeuvre, Captain William Lumsden choose to turn the opposite direction, ensuring a collision. Both ships attempted to slow but both were exceptionally heavy (&quot;Saint Paul&quot; was built for conversion in wartime to a cruiser). They hit at about . &quot;Saint Paul&quot; struck &quot;Gladiator&quot; just aft of her engine room.

The glancing blow ripped open the sides of both ships. The British warship foundered at once, or beached off Black Rock Buoy, off the Isle of Wight, while the American was able to remain afloat and launch lifeboats. Several men were also saved by Royal Engineers from nearby Fort Victoria. A total of 28 sailors were lost, but only three bodies were recovered.

&quot;Gladiator&quot; settled on her starboard side in shallow water close to Fort Victoria. Salvage work began almost at once, but it took over five months to right the ship, re-float it and tow it back to Portsmouth. The operation cost £64,000 and a further £500 to make the ship seaworthy, but as the ship&#x27;s design was considered obsolete, she was scrapped rather than repaired. &quot;Gladiator&quot; was sold to a Dutch firm for only £15,000.

A court of inquiry reprimanded Captain Lumsden in July 1908, but held &quot;Saint Paul&quot; responsible for the collision. However, when the Admiralty sued the owners of the liner, a high court held &quot;Gladiator&quot; responsible.

==Later fame==
A postcard of the capsized vessel was subsequently used by the artist Tacita Dean as the basis for her artwork &quot;So They Sunk Her&quot;, part of a portfolio of twenty black and white photogravures with etching collectively entitled &quot;The Russian Ending&quot;. The artwork ascribes the cause of the incident to a fictitious mutiny. A copy of the artwork is held by the Tate in London.

<doc id="455264" wikidata="Q653606" url="?curid=455264" title="Hermite (crater)">
<text>Hermite is a lunar impact crater located along the northern lunar limb, close to the north pole of the Moon. Named for Charles Hermite, the crater was formed roughly 3.91 billion years ago.

==Physical features==
Hermite is a worn, eroded crater with a rugged outer rim that is notched and incised from past impacts. A crater overlies the southwestern rim, and the two formations have merged to share a common interior floor. A pair of small craters lies along the southern part of the rim, and a small crater is also attached near the northern end. The interior floor has been resurfaced, so that it forms a wide plain that is pock-marked by numerous tiny craterlets and low hills. There is a small crater on the floor near the northeastern wall.

In 2009, it was discovered by NASA&#x27;s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter that Hermite is the coldest place recorded in the solar system, with temperatures at 26 kelvins (−413 °F, −247 °C). For comparison, Pluto&#x27;s surface only gets down to about 43 kelvins (−382 °F, −229 °C).

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Hermite.

===Hermite A===
====Possible water ice presence====
There may exist a large amount of water ice within Hermite A&#x27;s permanently shadowed region (PSR), where no light from the sun ever reaches; according to a 2016 study published by the IEEE roughly two-thirds of the crater&#x27;s PSR is covered with varying amounts of ice. However, a 2018 study also published by the IEEE countered this claim, arguing that the method used to detect ice in the earlier study was not refined enough to conclusively identify a material as ice, and that more detailed methods were needed to determine if ice exists within Hermite A. A further analysis of the crater in 2022 using data from the Chandrayaan-1 and Chandrayaan-2 lunar orbiters found that ice may exist in clusters on the walls and some parts of the floor of Hermite A.

<doc id="455271" wikidata="Q1618151" url="?curid=455271" title="Hilbert (crater)">
<text>Hilbert is a lunar impact crater that is located on the far side of the Moon, just past the southeast limb. It is named for German mathematician David Hilbert. It lies just beyond the region of the surface that is occasionally brought into view due to libration, and so this feature cannot be observed directly from the Earth.

The crater is attached to the southeast rim of the walled plain Pasteur, a formation nearly half as large again as Hilbert. To the southeast of Hilbert is the smaller crater Alden, while Backlund lies to the west-northwest.

Much of the outer rim of Hilbert remains relatively intact, although it is heavily eroded in places particularly in the south. The interior is relatively flat, but has been deeply gouged by several small craters. There is a short range of central ridges offset to the west of the interior midpoint. Just to the west of the ridges is Hilbert W, a crater with a smaller crater overlying the western rim, giving it a pear-like shape. Hilbert H is a circular, bowl-shaped crater in the east part of the floor. Next to the northern rim is Hilbert Y. There are also many lesser craterlets scattered about the interior.

It is characterised by an extremely high rockfall density by lunar standards.

Hilbert is one of the largest craters of Nectarian age.

<doc id="455274" wikidata="Q4862862" url="?curid=455274" title="Baron Teynham">
<text>Baron Teynham, of Teynham in the County of Kent, is a title in the Peerage of England. It was created in 1616 for Sir John Roper. The family seat is Pylewell Park, near Lymington, Hampshire.

In 1788, the 14th Baron Teynham inherited his distant cousin’s John Barnewall Curzon’s wealth and estate at Water Perry, Northamptonshire. Thus he adopted, by royal licence, the additional surname of Curzon despite not being related by blood to any Curzons. His descendants, such as John Roper-Curzon, the 21st and present Baron still go by their full surname of &#x27;Roper-Curzon&#x27;.

== History ==
The Roper family is an English aristocratic family that can be traced back to 1066 following the Norman Conquest by residing in Derbyshire. Members of the family have held three hereditary titles: Viscount Baltinglass, Baron Dacre, and Baron Teynham.

Upon the accession of James I, John Roper was the first of the gentry in his county to proclaim the new king, for which service he was knighted in 1616 (although according to other sources he may have already been knighted by Queen Elizabeth in 1587) and raised to the peerage as Lord Teynham on the same day. His contribution of £10,000 to the new king&#x27;s coffers may also have played a role in his elevation to the nobility. Ned Wymarke joked that he was &quot;Baron of Ten M&quot;, 10 thousand pound. According to Gardiner, however, Roper&#x27;s ennoblement was not any sort of sign of gratitude from the king; rather, it was granted (after the payment of £10,000) as a way to induce Roper to relinquish an office he held in the King&#x27;s Bench. King James hoped to grant the office to his grasping favourite, George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham, and viewed Roper as an obstacle to the plan.

The first Baron&#x27;s great-great-grandson, the fifth Baron, served as Lord Lieutenant of Kent. The latter&#x27;s third son, the eighth Baron, married, as his second wife, Anne Barrett-Lennard, 16th Baroness Dacre. His eldest son from this marriage, Charles Roper, was the father of Trevor Charles Roper, 18th Baron Dacre, and Gertrude Trevor Roper, 19th Baroness Dacre (see the Baron Dacre for more information). His youngest son from this marriage, Reverend Richard Henry Roper, was the great-great-great-grandfather of the historian Hugh Trevor-Roper, Baron Dacre of Glanton.

The eighth Baron was succeeded by his eldest son from his first marriage to Catherine Smythe, the ninth Baron. He died unmarried and was succeeded by his younger brother, the tenth Baron. The latter&#x27;s grandson, the fourteenth Baron, assumed in 1788 by Royal licence the surname of Curzon in lieu of his patronymic but in 1813 he resumed by Royal licence his original surname of Roper in addition to that of Curzon. His great-great-grandson, the nineteenth Baron, served as Deputy Chairman of Committees in the House of Lords from 1946 to 1959. the title is held by the twenty-first Baron, who succeeded in that year.

<doc id="455295" wikidata="Q832435" url="?curid=455295" title="Sub-orbital spaceflight">
<text>A sub-orbital spaceflight is a spaceflight in which the spacecraft reaches outer space, but its trajectory intersects the surface of the gravitating body from which it was launched. Hence, it will not complete one orbital revolution, will not become an artificial satellite nor will it reach escape velocity.

For example, the path of an object launched from Earth that reaches the Kármán line (about – above sea level), and then falls back to Earth, is considered a sub-orbital spaceflight. Some sub-orbital flights have been undertaken to test spacecraft and launch vehicles later intended for orbital spaceflight. Other vehicles are specifically designed only for sub-orbital flight; examples include crewed vehicles, such as the X-15 and SpaceShipTwo, and uncrewed ones, such as ICBMs and sounding rockets.

Flights which attain sufficient velocity to go into low Earth orbit, and then de-orbit before completing their first full orbit, are not considered sub-orbital. Examples of this include flights of the Fractional Orbital Bombardment System.

A flight that does not reach space is still sometimes called sub-orbital, but cannot officially be classified as a &quot;sub-orbital spaceflight&quot;. Usually a rocket is used, but some experimental sub-orbital spaceflights have also been achieved via the use of space guns.

==Altitude requirement==

By definition, a sub-orbital spaceflight reaches an altitude higher than above sea level. This altitude, known as the Kármán line, was chosen by the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale because it is roughly the point where a vehicle flying fast enough to support itself with aerodynamic lift from the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere would be flying faster than orbital speed. The US military and NASA award astronaut wings to those flying above , although the U.S. State Department does not show a distinct boundary between atmospheric flight and spaceflight.

==Orbit==
During freefall the trajectory is part of an elliptic orbit as given by the orbit equation. The perigee distance is less than the radius of the Earth &quot;R&quot; including atmosphere, hence the ellipse intersects the Earth, and hence the spacecraft will fail to complete an orbit. The major axis is vertical, the semi-major axis &quot;a&quot; is more than &quot;R&quot;/2. The specific orbital energy formula_1 is given by:

formula_2

where formula_3 is the standard gravitational parameter.

Almost always &quot;a&quot; &lt; &quot;R&quot;, corresponding to a lower formula_1 than the minimum for a full orbit, which is formula_5

Thus the net extra specific energy needed compared to just raising the spacecraft into space is between 0 and formula_6.

==Speed, range, and altitude==
To minimize the required delta-v (an astrodynamical measure which strongly determines the required fuel), the high-altitude part of the flight is made with the rockets off (this is technically called free-fall even for the upward part of the trajectory). (Compare with Oberth effect.) The maximum speed in a flight is attained at the lowest altitude of this free-fall trajectory, both at the start and at the end of it.

If one&#x27;s goal is simply to &quot;reach space&quot;, for example in competing for the Ansari X Prize, horizontal motion is not needed. In this case the lowest required delta-v, to reach 100 km altitude, is about 1.4 km/s. Moving slower, with less free-fall, would require more delta-v.

Compare this with orbital spaceflights: a low Earth orbit (LEO), with an altitude of about 300 km, needs a speed around 7.7 km/s, requiring a delta-v of about 9.2 km/s. (If there were no atmospheric drag the theoretical minimum delta-v would be 8.1 km/s to put a craft into a 300-kilometer high orbit starting from a stationary point like the South Pole. The theoretical minimum can be up to 0.46 km/s less if launching eastward from near the equator.)

For sub-orbital spaceflights covering a horizontal distance the maximum speed and required delta-v are in between those of a vertical flight and a LEO. The maximum speed at the lower ends of the trajectory are now composed of a horizontal and a vertical component. The higher the horizontal distance covered, the greater the horizontal speed will be. (The vertical velocity will increase with distance for short distances but will decrease with distance at longer distances.) For the V-2 rocket, just reaching space but with a range of about 330 km, the maximum speed was 1.6 km/s. Scaled Composites SpaceShipTwo which is under development will have a similar free-fall orbit but the announced maximum speed is 1.1 km/s (perhaps because of engine shut-off at a higher altitude).

For larger ranges, due to the elliptic orbit the maximum altitude can be much more than for a LEO. On a 10,000-kilometer intercontinental flight, such as that of an intercontinental ballistic missile or possible future commercial spaceflight, the maximum speed is about 7 km/s, and the maximum altitude may be more than 1300 km.
Any spaceflight that returns to the surface, including sub-orbital ones, will undergo atmospheric reentry. The speed at the start of the reentry is basically the maximum speed of the flight. The aerodynamic heating caused will vary accordingly: it is much less for a flight with a maximum speed of only 1 km/s than for one with a maximum speed of 7 or 8 km/s.

The minimum delta-v and the corresponding maximum altitude for a given range can be calculated, &quot;d&quot;, assuming a spherical Earth of circumference and neglecting the Earth&#x27;s rotation and atmosphere. Let θ be half the angle that the projectile is to go around the Earth, so in degrees it is 45°×&quot;d&quot;/. The minimum-delta-v trajectory corresponds to an ellipse with one focus at the centre of the Earth and the other at the point halfway between the launch point and the destination point (somewhere inside the Earth). (This is the orbit that minimizes the semi-major axis, which is equal to the sum of the distances from a point on the orbit to the two foci. Minimizing the semi-major axis minimizes the specific orbital energy and thus the delta-v, which is the speed of launch.) Geometrical arguments lead then to the following (with &quot;R&quot; being the radius of the Earth, about 6370 km):

formula_7

formula_8

formula_9

formula_10

The altitude of apogee is maximized (at about 1320 km) for a trajectory going one quarter of the way around the Earth (). Longer ranges will have lower apogees in the minimal-delta-v solution.

formula_11

formula_12

(where &quot;g&quot; is the acceleration of gravity at the Earth&#x27;s surface). The Δ&quot;v&quot; increases with range, leveling off at 7.9 km/s as the range approaches (halfway around the world). The minimum-delta-v trajectory for going halfway around the world corresponds to a circular orbit just above the surface (of course in reality it would have to be above the atmosphere). See lower for the time of flight.

An intercontinental ballistic missile is defined as a missile that can hit a target at least 5500 km away, and according to the above formula this requires an initial speed of 6.1 km/s. Increasing the speed to 7.9 km/s to attain any point on Earth requires a considerably larger missile because the amount of fuel needed goes up exponentially with delta-v (see Rocket equation).

The initial direction of a minimum-delta-v trajectory points halfway between straight up and straight toward the destination point (which is below the horizon). Again, this is the case if the Earth&#x27;s rotation is ignored. It is not exactly true for a rotating planet unless the launch takes place at a pole.

==Flight duration==
In a vertical flight of not too high altitudes, the time of the free-fall is both for the upward and for the downward part the maximum speed divided by the acceleration of gravity, so with a maximum speed of 1 km/s together 3 minutes and 20 seconds. The duration of the flight phases before and after the free-fall can vary.

For an intercontinental flight the boost phase takes 3 to 5 minutes, the free-fall (midcourse phase) about 25 minutes. For an ICBM the atmospheric reentry phase takes about 2 minutes; this will be longer for any soft landing, such as for a possible future commercial flight. Test flight 4 of the SpaceX &#x27;Starship&#x27; performed such a flight with a lift off from Texas and a simulated soft touchdown in the Indian Ocean 66 minutes after liftoff.

Sub-orbital flights can last from just seconds to days. Pioneer 1 was NASA&#x27;s first space probe, intended to reach the Moon. A partial failure caused it to instead follow a sub-orbital trajectory, reentering the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere 43 hours after launch.

To calculate the time of flight for a minimum-delta-v trajectory, according to Kepler&#x27;s third law, the period for the entire orbit (if it did not go through the Earth) would be:

formula_13

Using Kepler&#x27;s second law, we multiply this by the portion of the area of the ellipse swept by the line from the centre of the Earth to the projectile:

formula_14

formula_15

This gives about 32 minutes for going a quarter of the way around the Earth, and 42 minutes for going halfway around. For short distances, this expression is asymptotic to formula_16.

From the form involving arccosine, the derivative of the time of flight with respect to &quot;d&quot; (or θ) goes to zero as &quot;d&quot; approaches (halfway around the world). The derivative of Δ&quot;v&quot; also goes to zero here. So if &quot;d&quot; = , the length of the minimum-delta-v trajectory will be about , but it will take only a few seconds less time than the trajectory for &quot;d&quot; = (for which the trajectory is long).

==Flight profiles==

While there are a great many possible sub-orbital flight profiles, it is expected that some will be more common than others.

===Ballistic missiles===
The first sub-orbital vehicles which reached space were ballistic missiles. The first ballistic missile to reach space was the German V-2, the work of the scientists at Peenemünde, on October 3, 1942, which reached an altitude of . Then in the late 1940s the US and USSR concurrently developed missiles all of which were based on the V-2 Rocket, and then much longer range Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles (ICBMs). There are now many countries who possess ICBMs and even more with shorter range Intermediate Range Ballistic Missiles (IRBMs).

===Tourist flights===
Sub-orbital tourist flights will initially focus on attaining the altitude required to qualify as reaching space. The flight path will be either vertical or very steep, with the spacecraft landing back at its take-off site.

The spacecraft will shut off its engines well before reaching maximum altitude, and then coast up to its highest point. During a few minutes, from the point when the engines are shut off to the point where the atmosphere begins to slow down the downward acceleration, the passengers will experience weightlessness.

Megaroc had been planned for sub-orbital spaceflight by the British Interplanetary Society in the 1940s.

In late 1945, a group led by M. Tikhonravov K. and N. G. Chernysheva at the Soviet NII-4 academy (dedicated to rocket artillery science and technology), began work on a stratospheric rocket project, VR-190, aimed at vertical flight by a crew of two pilots, to an altitude of 200 km (65,000 ft) using captured V-2.

In 2004, a number of companies worked on vehicles in this class as entrants to the Ansari X Prize competition. The Scaled Composites SpaceShipOne was officially declared by Rick Searfoss to have won the competition on October 4, 2004, after completing two flights within a two-week period.

In 2005, Sir Richard Branson of the Virgin Group announced the creation of Virgin Galactic and his plans for a 9-seat capacity SpaceShipTwo named VSS &quot;Enterprise&quot;. It has since been completed with eight seats (one pilot, one co-pilot and six passengers) and has taken part in captive-carry tests and with the first mother-ship WhiteKnightTwo, or VMS &quot;Eve&quot;. It has also completed solitary glides, with the movable tail sections in both fixed and &quot;feathered&quot; configurations. The hybrid rocket motor has been fired multiple times in ground-based test stands, and was fired in a powered flight for the second time on 5 September 2013. Four additional SpaceShipTwos have been ordered and will operate from the new Spaceport America. Commercial flights carrying passengers were expected in 2014, but became cancelled due to the disaster during SS2 PF04 flight. Branson stated, &quot;[w]e are going to learn from what went wrong, discover how we can improve safety and performance and then move forwards together.&quot;

===Scientific experiments===
A major use of sub-orbital vehicles today is as scientific sounding rockets. Scientific sub-orbital flights began in the 1920s when Robert H. Goddard launched the first liquid fueled rockets, however they did not reach space altitude. In the late 1940s, captured German V-2 ballistic missiles were converted into V-2 sounding rockets which helped lay the foundation for modern sounding rockets. Today there are dozens of different sounding rockets on the market, from a variety of suppliers in various countries. Typically, researchers wish to conduct experiments in microgravity or above the atmosphere.

===Sub-orbital transportation===
Research, such as that done for the X-20 Dyna-Soar project suggests that a semi-ballistic sub-orbital flight could travel from Europe to North America in less than an hour.

However, the size of rocket, relative to the payload, necessary to achieve this, is similar to an ICBM. ICBMs have delta-v&#x27;s somewhat less than orbital; and therefore would be somewhat cheaper than the costs for reaching orbit, but the difference is not large.

Due to the high cost of spaceflight, suborbital flights are likely to be initially limited to high value, very high urgency cargo deliveries such as courier flights, military fast-response operations or space tourism.

The SpaceLiner is a hypersonic suborbital spaceplane concept that could transport 50 passengers from Australia to Europe in 90 minutes or 100 passengers from Europe to California in 60 minutes. The main challenge lies in increasing the reliability of the different components, particularly the engines, in order to make their use for passenger transportation on a daily basis possible.

SpaceX is potentially considering using their Starship as a sub-orbital point-to-point transportation system.

==Notable uncrewed sub-orbital spaceflights==
* The first sub-orbital space flight was on 20 June 1944, when MW 18014, a V-2 test rocket, launched from Peenemünde in Germany and reached 176 kilometres altitude.
* Bumper 5, a two-stage rocket launched from the White Sands Proving Grounds. On 24 February 1949 the upper stage reached an altitude of and a speed of .
* Albert II, a male rhesus macaque, became the first mammal in space on 14 June 1949 in a sub-orbital flight from Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico to an altitude of 83 miles (134 km) aboard a U.S. V-2 sounding rocket.
* USSR – Energia, 15 May 1987, a Polyus payload which failed to reach orbit
* SpaceX IFT-7, 16 January 2025, a Starship flight test which blew up during ascent, forcing airline flights to alter course to avoid falling debris and setting back Elon Musk&#x27;s flagship rocket program. There were also numerous reports of damage on the ground. It is, to date, the most massive object launched into a sub-orbital trajectory.

==Crewed sub-orbital spaceflights==
Above 100 km (62.14 mi) in altitude.

==Future of crewed sub-orbital spaceflight==
Private companies such as Virgin Galactic, Armadillo Aerospace (reinvented as Exos Aerospace), Airbus, Blue Origin and Masten Space Systems are taking an interest in sub-orbital spaceflight, due in part to ventures like the Ansari X Prize. NASA and others are experimenting with scramjet-based hypersonic aircraft which may well be used with flight profiles that qualify as sub-orbital spaceflight. Non-profit entities like ARCASPACE and Copenhagen Suborbitals also attempt rocket-based launches.

She married guitarist and record producer Yoshiyuki Sahashi on December 28, 2007. Her married name is . She has the name of Natori of the Matsumoto school of Nippon Buyō (Japanese dancing); . She chose the surname &quot;Matsu&quot; to honor the family. In an interview, she said she and her siblings are close to their mother.

== Career ==
Matsu starred in her stage debut &quot;Ninjō-banashi: Bunshichi Mottoi&quot; at Kabuki-za. Her first television role was in the NHK Drama &quot;Hana no Ran&quot; and starred in the NHK drama &quot;Kura&quot;. Because Shirayuri Gakuen, her high school, prohibited working in the industry, she moved to Horikoshi High School. Matsu starred in the drama &quot;Long Vacation&quot; after matriculating to college. She had a supporting role, but established in full-scale her position, because the drama was a major hit. She hosted the 47th NHK &quot;Kōhaku Uta Gassen&quot; and debuted with the single &quot;Ashita, Haru ga Kitara&quot;. She returned to the show as a singer on the last day of the year. In an interview with NHK, Matsu recalled the incident with her musical debut. She sang karaoke which was heard by the director who suggested she gave a song. Although she declined it and was not confident enough with the song, she accepted because she saw it as &quot;[a] chance that not everyone got&quot;.

In the same year, she starred in the drama &quot;Love Generation&quot; in a leading role. She starred in &quot;Hero&quot;. She published a photo essay book, &quot;Matsu no Hitorigoto&quot;, through Asahi Shimbun Publishers. She released &quot;Toki no Fune&quot; in September 2004, which was composed by Akeboshi. It is similar to the song, &quot;A nine days&#x27; wonder&quot;, which was released after the &quot;Toki no Fune&quot; single. The single contained a cover of Akeboshi&#x27;s &quot;White Reply&quot; previously recorded on her sixth album, &quot;Harvest Songs&quot;.

Matsu won the Best Actress of the Year of the 29th Hochi Film Award and the 28th Japan Academy Prize at the same time for &quot;The Hidden Blade&quot;. In July 2006, she and Takuya Kimura starred in a special one-night edition of &quot;Hero&quot;. In October 2006, Matsu and Makoto Fujita starred in a weekly drama &quot;Yakusha Damashii&quot;. Matsu left the third concert tour in May 2007 to commemorate her tenth year as a singer. In her album &quot;Cherish You&quot;, the song &quot;Ashita Haru ga Kitara&quot; was redone to combine her voice on her youth.

On November 27, 2014, Matsu revealed on her official website that she was pregnant with her first child. Her daughter was born on March 30, 2015, and had 3466 grams. On February 9, 2020, Matsu was called to join Idina Menzel, Aurora and eight more of Elsa&#x27;s international dubbers to perform the song “Into the Unknown” at the 92nd Academy Awards. Every international performer sang one line of the song in a different languages, including Maria Lucia Rosenberg, Willemijn Verkaik, Carmen Sarahí, Lisa Stokke, Katarzyna Łaska, Anna Buturlina, Gisela and Wichayanee Pearklin. Matsu worked with the producers. Her third album, &quot;Sakura no Ame, Itsuka&quot; was released at Universal Music.

<doc id="455299" wikidata="Q2926164" url="?curid=455299" title="Brooklyn–Manhattan Transit Corporation">
<text>The Brooklyn–Manhattan Transit Corporation (BMT) was an urban transit holding company, based in Brooklyn, New York City, United States, and incorporated in 1923. The system was sold to the city in 1940. Today, together with the IND subway system, it forms the B Division of the modern New York City Subway.

The original BMT routes form the , , , , , and trains, as well as the Franklin Avenue Shuttle, with the IND and using BMT trackage in Brooklyn. The train enters the IND via the Chrystie Street Connection after crossing the Williamsburg Bridge. The , along with some rush-hour trains enter the IND from the BMT 63rd Street Line. The train enters the IND via the 60th Street Tunnel Connection.

The train supplements the in the peak direction during rush hours only. Prior to city ownership, the BMT services were designed with numbers, and the current letter scheme was developed as a continuation of the IND nomenclature as the IND and BMT systems were integrated.

==History==

===Company years===
The Brooklyn–Manhattan Transit Corporation took over the assets of the Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company on June 15, 1923, following the previous company&#x27;s bankruptcy. Like its predecessor it controlled subsidiaries which operated the great majority of the rapid transit and streetcar lines in Brooklyn with extensions into Queens and Manhattan. One of these, New York Rapid Transit Corporation operated the elevated and subway lines.

In 1923, their president, Gerhard Melvin Dahl, published a document called &quot;Transit Truths&quot; to explain the issues the company faced. In it he complained that the company had &quot;met with the bitter, personal and unfair opposition of Mayor Hylan.&quot; In a separate letter to Hylan he said: &quot;For seven years, you have been misleading and fooling the people in this community… For seven years, you have blocked every effort at transit relief. You, and only you, are to blame for the present…deplorable condition of the whole transit situation. You have used the transit situation as a political escalator&quot;.

In the late 1930s, the BMT was pressed by the City administration of Mayor Fiorello H. La Guardia to sell its operations to the City, which wanted to have all subway and elevated lines municipally owned and operated. The City had two powerful incentives to coerce the sale:
* the BMT was forced by provisions of the Dual Contracts to charge no more than a five-cent fare, an amount set in 1913, before the inflation of World War I.
* the City had the right of “recapture” of those lines that had been built or improved with City participation under those &quot;Dual Contracts&quot;. This meant that, if the City forced the issue, the BMT could have been left with a fragmented system and City competition in many of its market areas.

The BMT sold all of its transit operations to the City on June 1, 1940.

===Afterward===
After World War II the city-built IND subway took over parts of the former BMT, starting in 1954 with the extension of the D train from its terminal at Church Avenue via a new connection with the former BMT Culver line at Ditmas Avenue. From 1954 the three remaining Culver stations between Ninth Avenue and Ditmas Avenue were used by the Culver Shuttle. The service was discontinued in 1975 because of budget cuts and was later demolished.

The 60th Street Tunnel Connection between the IND Queens Boulevard Line and BMT Broadway Line opened in December 1955. This new route was used by the BMT Brighton local, which formerly ran to Astoria, for service to Forest Hills along with the IND GG local. The next year saw the new extension of the IND Fulton Street Line ( train) in Brooklyn connected to the rebuilt section of the former BMT Fulton Street elevated at 80th Street in Queens in April 1956. The portion of the BMT Fulton Street El running west of 80th Street to Rockaway Avenue was demolished afterward.

The late 1950s and early 1960s saw the biggest project of that era with the building of the Chrystie Street Connection, and the IND Sixth Avenue express tracks. This project connected the IND Sixth Avenue services to the BMT services that ran over the Manhattan and Williamsburg Bridges. Express services were directly connected to the Manhattan Bridge, and local services could use either the Williamsburg Bridge or the existing Rutgers Street Tunnel. Both connections opened in November 1967 and created the largest re-routing of train services in the history of the NYCTA. The BMT West End and Brighton Lines became served primarily by IND services as a result. From 1967, some IND Sixth Avenue trains called and later K, used the Chrystie Street Connection to the BMT Jamaica Line over the Williamsburg Bridge. That connection was discontinued due to budget cuts in 1976.

In 1988, the BMT Archer Avenue Line was opened, connecting to what was then the east end of the BMT Jamaica Line. Two stations—Sutphin Boulevard–Archer Avenue–JFK Airport and Jamaica Center–Parsons/Archer—were added.

In 1989, the BMT 63rd Street Line opened as an extension of the express tracks of the BMT Broadway Line, connecting to the IND 63rd Street Line at Lexington Avenue–63rd Street station. A connection from the Broadway/63rd Street Lines to the IND Second Avenue Line opened in 2017.

In June 2010, as a result of more budget cuts, the Chrystie Street Connection was put back into revenue service for use by the train, which was rerouted up the IND Sixth Avenue Line to replace the discontinued train.

==Operation==

The BMT operated rapid transit (subway and elevated lines) through the New York Rapid Transit Corporation and surface transit (streetcars and buses) through the Brooklyn and Queens Transit Corporation.

The BMT was a national leader in the transit industry, and was a proponent of advanced urban railways, participating in development of advanced streetcar designs, including the PCC car, whose design and advanced components influenced railcar design worldwide for decades. The company also sought to extend the art of rapid transit car design with such innovations as &quot;articulated (multi-jointed-body) cars&quot;, lightweight equipment, advanced control systems, and shared components with streetcar fleets.

Unlike the Interborough Rapid Transit Company (IRT), the other private operator of subways in New York City, the BMT remained solvent throughout the Great Depression and showed a profit, albeit small in its last year, until the very end of its transit operations.

==Surviving BMT Equipment==
Several pre-unification BMT equipment have been preserved in various museums. While some of the equipment are operational, others are in need of restoration or are used simply as static displays.
* BU cars 197, 659, 1227, 1273, 1349, 1362, 1365, 1404 and 1407 have been preserved. Cars 197, 659, 1227, 1349 and 1362 are located at the Shore Line Trolley Museum. Car 1365 is on static display at the St. Louis Museum of Transportation. Cars 1273, 1404 and 1407 are operational at the New York Transit Museum.
* BMT Elevated Instruction car 999 is preserved at the Shore Line Trolley Museum.
* Q-type cars 1602A and 1612C have been preserved. Car 1602A survives at the Trolley Museum of New York, while car 1612C survives at the New York Transit Museum.
* AB Standards 2204, 2390, 2391, 2392 and 2775 have been preserved. Car 2204 is located at the New York Transit Museum; cars 2390, 2391 and 2392 are preserved by the Railway Preservation Corp; and car 2775 is preserved at the Shore Line Trolley Museum.
* D-type Triplex sets 6019, 6095, and 6112 have been preserved by the New York Transit Museum.

<text>Nancy Hower is an American actress, director, screenwriter and producer.

==Early life==
Nancy Hower grew up in Wyckoff, New Jersey, and is one of nine children. She appeared onstage for the first time as a senior in high school. Upon graduating from high school, Hower continued her studies at the Juilliard School in New York City where she majored in drama. During her years at Juilliard, she appeared in such productions as &quot;King Lear&quot;, &quot;And A Nightingale Sang&quot;, &quot;Macbeth&quot;, &quot;The Fifth of July&quot;, and &quot;The Would-Be Gentleman&quot;. She also later appeared in two stage productions at the Williamstown Theatre Festival in Massachusetts.

==Career==
Hower began her professional acting career playing the role of Andrea in &quot;The Years&quot; at the Manhattan Theatre Club in 1993. She has also been in several on and off-Broadway stage productions throughout her career. In 1994, she made her film debut with a supporting role in the comedy film &quot;Insomnia&quot;. In 1998, she appeared in the airline disaster film &quot;Blackout Effect&quot;. Other film work includes a role in the short independent film &quot;Tunnel Vision&quot; (1998) and an FBI agent in the sci-fi movie &quot;The Last Man on Planet Earth&quot; (1999). Hower also had a role in &quot;Standing On Fishes&quot; (1999), and although her name appears in the end credits of this movie, her role was cut from the final version. She has had guest-starring roles in the television series &quot;Suddenly Susan&quot; and &quot;The Sentinel&quot;.

===&quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot;===
Hower had a recurring role as Ensign Samantha Wildman on the sci-fi series &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot;. She appeared in eight episodes of the series&#x27; seven-year run. Her character is head of &quot;Voyager&quot;″s xenobiology department and, in the episode &quot;Deadlock&quot; (Season 2), she gives birth to a daughter called Naomi Wildman.

Hower&#x27;s &quot;Voyager&quot; appearances are, in chronological order: &quot;Elogium&quot; (Season 2), &quot;Tattoo&quot; (Season 2), &quot;Dreadnought&quot; (Season 2), &quot;Deadlock&quot; (Season 2), &quot;Basics, Pt. 2&quot; (Season 3), &quot;Mortal Coil&quot; (Season 4), &quot;Once Upon A Time&quot; (Season 5), and &quot;Fury&quot; (Season 6).

Wildman was also mentioned, but not seen, in several other &quot;Voyager&quot; episodes.

===Music===
Hower formerly fronted two alternative rock bands, &quot;WENCH&quot; and &quot;STELLA&quot;. &quot;STELLA&quot; was the opening act on Meat Loaf&#x27;s 2001 UK tour. She sang lead, played rhythm guitar, and wrote all of the band&#x27;s music.

Hower also co-wrote the original music for the play &quot;Momma&quot; in 2001, as well as writing and recording an unreleased rock opera titled &quot;Girl On Mars&quot;. Also in 2001, she played the role of Yitzak in &quot;Hedwig and the Angry Inch&quot; in Los Angeles.

===2003–present===
Hower wrote and directed the short film &quot;The Wizard of Id&quot;, an unreleased film about a musician who discovers that he has the power to change the lives of the people around him through his music. In 2003, Hower directed the stage play &quot;City Limits&quot; at the Keck Theater in Los Angeles.

Hower wrote, directed, produced and edited the independent film &quot;Memron&quot; (2004), a mockumentary on the Enron scandal. In 2004, she also directed the stage play &quot;The Lights Change&quot; at the Keck Theatre.

Following the success of &quot;Memron&quot;, Hower teamed up with fellow &quot;Memron&quot; producers Robert Hickey, John Lehr, and Evie Peck to create a comedy improv series titled &quot;10 Items or Less&quot;. The TBS show stars John Lehr as a less than successful businessman who takes over the family supermarket when his father dies. &quot;10 Items or Less&quot; premiered on TBS on November 27, 2006.

Hower provided vocals for the film &quot;Catch and Release&quot; (2007), in which she also plays a small role.

In 2013, Hower directed and co-wrote the Hulu original series &quot;Quickdraw&quot;, which was renewed for a second season in 2014.
