<doc id="452230" wikidata="Q1505420" url="?curid=452230" title="2004 Russian presidential election">
<text>Presidential elections were held in Russia on 14 March 2004. Incumbent President Vladimir Putin was seeking a second full four-year term. It was a landslide victory for Putin, who was re-elected with 72% of the vote.

==Candidates==
===Registered candidates===
Candidates are listed in the order they appear on the ballot paper (alphabetical order in Russian).
===Withdrawn candidates===
==Opinion polls==
==Conduct==
===General assessments===
Observers representing the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe and the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, cited what they called abuses of government resources, bias in the state media and instances of ballot stuffing on election day. According to the ad hoc Committee by the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, &quot;the elections were generally well administrated and reflected the consistently high public approval rating of the incumbent president but lacked elements of a genuine democratic contest.&quot;

&quot;While on a technical level the election was organized with professionalism, particularly on the part of the Central Election Commission (CEC), the election process overall did not adequately reflect principles necessary for a healthy democratic election process. The election process failed to meet important commitments concerning treatment of candidates by the State-controlled media on a non-discriminatory basis, equal opportunities for all candidates and secrecy of the ballot,&quot; reported observers by Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe. &quot;Localised instances of election-related abuse of official function, whilst met with an appropriately robust response by the electoral authorities in some instances, reflected a lack of democratic culture, accountability and responsibility, particularly in areas distant from the capital.&quot;

Observers representing the Commonwealth of Independent States recognized the election as &quot;free, democratic and fair&quot;. The head of the mission Yury Yarov assured that violations identified during the mission didn&#x27;t affect &quot;free expression of the electors&#x27; will and result of the election&quot;.

===Election campaign===
According to report by an ad hoc Committee by the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, &quot;The Presidential Election Law and the Basic Guarantees of Electoral Rights Law provided the legal framework for the presidential elections, laying down conditions for the transparency in the organisation and conduct of the election.&quot; Criticizing the election campaign, the Committee claimed as &quot;unreasonable hurdle&quot; the requirement to collect 2 million signatures for submission to the CEC in support of persons seeking registration as candidates. Another concern was, &quot;The Russian Constitution stipulates that in a presidential election, if the turnout is less than 50%, a new round has to be held, with candidates registering anew. This clause raised concerns of authorities on voters turnout and a massive campaign encouraging people to participate in elections had been launched by the CEC and local authorities. In some regions, local authorities overused their power to force people to take part in the elections.&quot; The election campaign in general was &quot;low-key and all but invisible, which could be explained by the predictability of the results of the election.&quot; Glazyev&#x27;s manager reported the use of administrative resources by preventing Glazyev from campaigning in the regions; Khakamada claimed that &quot;local authorities were instructed to hamper her meetings with voters&quot;.

PACE reported that despite some irregularities, &quot;credit should be given to the election administration which ensured security and professional conduct of the voting process&quot;. PACE noted the unusually high turnout in five North Caucasus republics (more than 90%), &quot;Mr Putin received 98.2 % of the vote in Ingushetia, 96.5 % in Kabardino-Balkaria, 94,6 % in Dagestan, 92.3% in Chechnya and 91.25% in North Ossetia. Taking into account that the general turnout of the election was only 64.39%, the election results in these regions seem to be unusually high and one-sided.&quot; Considering situation in Chechnya, the Moscow Times quoted election officials in the republic&#x27;s capital, Grozny, as acknowledging that they had filled in several thousand ballots for Putin.

===Media bias===
The report of PACE said that &quot;during the presidential election the International Election Observation Mission concluded that state-controlled media had displayed clear bias in favour of the incumbent in news presentation and coverage of the campaign.&quot;

According to the report by Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (OSCE) of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, 

In the month prior to the election, state-funded Channel One Russia dedicated more than four hours of its news coverage to Putin, with the coverage being overwhelmingly positive. In contrast, the second-most covered candidate on Channel One was Kharitonov, who received a mere 21 minutes of primetime news coverage.

State-funded TV Russia gave Putin nearly two hours of primetime news, with the tone of the coverage being overwhelmingly positive. In contrast, Glazeyev was given only four minutes of coverage, the tone of which ranged from negative to neutral.

TV Centre, a television station that was controlled by the Moscow City administration, provided an hour and 25 minutes of coverage to Putin, with the tone being overwhelmingly positive. In contrast, TV Centre gave Glazeyev a mere seven minutes of coverage, which ranged in tone from negative to neutral.

Private broadcasters were more balanced in their television coverage. REN TV gave 35 minutes of primetime news to Mr. Putin, with 35% of
this coverage being negative. They gave Khakamada 22 minutes of
coverage which ranged from neutral to positive in tone. NTV gave more than 31 minutes of coverage to Mr. Putin, ranging in tone from neutral to positive. In its analytical news programs, such as Svoboda Slova and
Namedni, NTV gave a relatively balanced picture of the main
contestants and the State leadership. NTV, however, did not air election debates due to Putin’s refusal to take part. Additionally, NTV did not air special broadcasts for campaign programming citing to low public interest.

Most local television outlets provided very little coverage of the election. What coverage they did provide generally tended to be favorable of Putin.

Many media outlets ignored key developments in the campaign&#x27;s of Putin&#x27;s challengers. For instance, very few media outlets (both television and print) carried news of Khakamada&#x27;s campaign announcement.

Print media displayed a variety of views, with coverage of various outlets being either strongly pro-Putin or strongly anti-Putin in bias.

===Calls for boycott===
A few groups, notably the Yabloko party and a number of human rights organizations, encouraged voters to boycott the election. Yabloko&#x27;s leader Grigory Yavlinsky specifically called for boycotts to take place in protest of what he considered to be &quot;the slide of the country into authoritarianism&quot;.

<doc id="452231" wikidata="Q1247774" url="?curid=452231" title="Somerton, Somerset">
<text>Somerton ( ) is a town and civil parish in the English county of Somerset. It gave its name to the county and was briefly, around the start of the 14th century, the county town, and around 900 was possibly the capital of Wessex. It has held a weekly market since the Middle Ages, and the main square with its market cross is today popular with visitors. Situated on the River Cary, approximately north-west of Yeovil, Somerton has its own town council serving a population of 4,697 as of 2011.

Residents are often referred to locally as Somertonians. The civil parish includes the hamlets of Etsome, Hurcot, Catsgore, and Catcombe.

Archaeological remains at Somerton are evidence of a Celtic settlement. The discovery of a high status cemetery in 2019, suggests that these local people adopted a more Roman lifestyle. During the Anglo-Saxon era, Somerton was an important political and commercial centre. After the Norman conquest of England the importance of the town declined, despite being the county town of Somerset in the late thirteenth century and early fourteenth century. Having lost county town status, Somerton then became a market town in the Middle Ages, whose economy was supported by transport systems using the River Parrett, and later rail transport via the Great Western Railway, and by light industries including glove making and gypsum mining.

In the centre of Somerton the wide market square, with its octagonal roofed market cross, is surrounded by old houses, while close by is the 13th century Church of St Michael and All Angels. Somerton also had links with Muchelney Abbey in the Middle Ages. The BBC drama &quot;The Monocled Mutineer&quot; was filmed in Somerton from 1985 to 1986.

== History ==
Archaeological evidence uncovered in 2019 indicates the existence of a Celtic settlement which pre-dates any written records of the area. The grave goods found suggest the local population were of a high status and adopted a Roman lifestyle, with the older and newer graves showing marked differences in burial customs.
The earliest written reference to the town is in the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot;, which records that in 733 the King of Wessex, Æthelheard lost control of Somerton to Æthelbald, King of Mercia. Somerton was the site of the 949 meeting of the witan, a form of Anglo-Saxon parliament. The town returned to West Saxon royal control in the ninth century, and it was listed in the &quot;Domesday Book&quot; of 1086 as &quot;Sumertone&quot;. The name may come from Old English for &quot;sea-lake enclosure&quot;, &quot;summer town&quot; or &quot;summer farmstead&quot;. The Somerton name was extended to the people in the area it controlled, and this area became known as Somerset, although Somerton soon ceased to be the most important settlement and never grew into a large town. The parish was the largest in the Hundred of Somerton. It was, briefly, the county town of Somerset from the late thirteenth century into the early fourteenth century. A building referred to as &quot;Somerset castle&quot; is believed to have been built around 1280 as a county gaol, with a visitor in 1579 describing the remaining portion as &quot;an old tower embattled about castle-like&quot;. It was owned by Sir Ralph Cromwell between 1423 and 1433. Details are vague and visible remains have vanished, so its status as a castle and its very existence is in doubt, with one writer, D.J.C. King, feeling that people were confusing it with Somerton Castle in Lincolnshire.

The Abbots of Muchelney Abbey held the rectorship of the parish church of Somerton during the Middle Ages. They built a tithe barn, to house the tithes of crops and produce paid by the parish to the town&#x27;s rector. The abbey was dissolved in 1539 during the English Reformation, and the tithes and the tithe barn passed into the ownership of Bristol Cathedral. In the 20th century the barn was converted into private housing.

Glove making was a major industry in the town in the early 19th century, along with the production of rope and twine. The Somerton Brewery, owned by a local landowner named Thomas Templeman, was first recorded under the Tithe Apportionment Act 1841. The brewery became a large producer in Somerset until its final closure around 1935. Before the National Insurance and the Health Service was introduced, Somerton Men&#x27;s Club acted as a local provident society within the area. Gypsum was extracted by hand at the Hurcott open-cast mine from the Victorian era up until it closed down in 1953. In 1906, a railway station opened on the Castle Cary Cut-Off which was built by the Great Western Railway. Whilst the line still remains in use, the station was closed in 1962. When the Marconi Company built the radio stations known as the Imperial Wireless Chain for the Post Office during 1925–26, they also established their own transmitting station at Dorchester with a receiving station away at Somerton.

Somerton was hit by four Luftwaffe bombs on the morning of 29 September 1942 during the Second World War. The bombs were aimed at the Cow and Gate milk factory and it was largely destroyed. Ten nearby houses were badly damaged. Nine people were killed and thirty seven injured. A memorial at the dairy site commemorates those killed.

Somerton also is home to large properties, like The Lynch Country House, a Grade II listed building, built in 1812 and St Michael&#x27;s and All Angels Church.

== Governance ==
Somerton is an electoral division electing two councillors to Somerset Council. The electoral division is larger than the town, including several neighbouring parishes.

The town also has a town council with responsibility for some local issues. In October 2009, eleven of the town councillors resigned en masse, citing excessive criticism from local residents and in particular criticism from a hostile local weblog. In February 2012 the external auditor appointed by the Audit Commission published a critical &quot;Report in the Public Interest&quot; regarding the activities of Somerton Town Council in the fiscal year 2008 to 2009.

The town was formerly part of South Somerset district from 1974 to 2023, and part of Langport Rural District from 1894 to 1974. 

Somerton is part of Glastonbury and Somerton constituency for elections to the House of Commons.

== Geography ==
Somerton is situated on a plateau, above and to the south of the deep valley of the River Cary. The river flows west and then north through the Somerton Moor and then into King&#x27;s Sedgemoor Drain on the Somerset Levels eventually joining the River Parrett near Bridgwater. The town is from London, south from Bristol and north-west from Yeovil, just off the Dorset border. Somerton&#x27;s hamlets include Etsome, Hurcot, Lower Somerton, Littleton and Midney. Great Breach Wood is a biological Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) and is situated just north-east from Somerton, near the hamlet of Littleton.

Somerton&#x27;s climate is typical of the climate of south-west England which is usually cool winters with warmer summers and precipitation all year round, with more rain experienced in winter.
== Demography ==
The Somerton parish had a population of 5,500 as of 2021. In the 1801 census the population of the town was 1,145 and the first half of the 19th century saw strong growth (reflecting that seen elsewhere in England during this period), with the population rising to 2,140 in 1851. It however then began to drop, starting with a significant drop to 1,917 by the 1861 census. The population steadily fell until 1921, before steadily rising thereafter. It was not until 1961 that the population of Somerton had risen above its former population of 1851. The population has since continued to steadily increase.

== Economy ==
A weekly market has been held in Somerton for much of its history. The cloth industry dominated the town&#x27;s market from the 17th century until the 20th century, when agriculture took over as the leading industry. Some light industries and services, such as garage repair, physiotherapy, water treatment, and builders and decorators, are located in the business park on Bancombe Road.

== Landmarks ==
The main square, Market Place, with its market cross is today an attractive location for visitors. Market crosses have stood in the square since before 1390; the present Butter Cross, a roofed market cross, was rebuilt in 1673, and is Somerton&#x27;s most noted feature. The structure was the property of the Earls of Ilchester who sold it to the town in 1916. It is a Scheduled Ancient Monument. Next to the Butter Cross stands the Old Town Hall. Bordering the square are the church, and the Lady Smith Memorial Hall, also known as the &quot;Parish Rooms&quot;, which was built in 1902, and named after Frances (nee Pinney), the late wife of Sir John Smith, who had died in 1895.
The 17th century Market House is now a restaurant. The Red Lion was opened by the Earl of Ilchester in 1768 as a model coaching inn. It closed in 1995; after a period of neglect it has been redeveloped as town houses.

From the early 1980s onwards projects aiming to improve Somerton for film industry purposes have been undertaken. The market square was heavily revamped, creating a central parking area with easy access to the local amenities. The BBC drama &quot;The Monocled Mutineer&quot; was filmed in Somerton from 1985 to 1986.

==Somerton Court==
Somerton Court was originally known as &quot;Somerton Erleigh&quot;. The house has had various owners including Edward IV&#x27;s brother, the Duke of Clarence, and Henry Percy, 6th Earl of Northumberland, who sold the estate in 1530. It passed through a number of hands until 1597 when it was purchased by James Fisher, whose son later rebuilt it in 1641. The court remained in the Fisher family&#x27;s possession until 1808 when it was sold. Its new owner renamed the house &quot;Somerton Court&quot;, and replaced the gabled dormers with Gothic battlements and turrets. The house was later enlarged by the Hall-Stephenson family. During World War II it was occupied by Royal Navy WRENS. In the 1970s it was purchased by a local businessman Stuart Pattemore. In 1987 Somerton Court and the estate of and 4 cottages including The Dower House was purchased by Roger Byron-Collins when it was subject to extensive upgrading and extensions. It was resold in 2005. The Dower House was built in the early 19th century. The house now stands in grounds.

== Transport ==
The town&#x27;s former, and only, railway station was on the Castle Cary Cut-Off, once part of the Great Western Railway. Although the line still remains in use the station closed to passengers in 1962, and goods in 1964. The nearest station is now at Castle Cary. On the outskirts of the town stands the impressive Somerton Viaduct.

The closest main road from Somerton is the A303 road that runs near the town and stretches all the way into northern Hampshire and finally joins the M3 motorway near Basingstoke. The minor B3165 road runs through the town although the road is less commonly used and does not join to the A303 for another . Two B roads, the B3153 and B3165, run through Somerton; the B3165, mentioned earlier, starts in the town and runs southwards to the A372 Langport road. The A372 itself runs south-east to the junction of the A303 and A37 roads at Podimore services. The B3151 is also nearby, connecting Somerton with Street and Glastonbury to the north, and Ilchester to the south, and thus the A303 and A37 as well. The M5 motorway is around away at junction 23 (Bridgwater).

== Media ==
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC West and ITV West Country. Television signals are received from the Mendip TV transmitter.

Local radio stations are BBC Radio Somerset on 95.5 FM, Heart West on 102.6 FM and Greatest Hits Radio South West (formerly The Breeze) on 105.6 FM.

The town is served by the local newspaper, Somerset County Gazette.

== Religious sites ==
The Church of England parish church, St Michael and All Angels, has origins which date from the 13th century, with a major reshaping in the mid 15th century, and further restoration in 1889. It is built of local lias stone cut and squared, with Hamstone dressing. It has been designated by English Heritage as a Grade I listed building.

The church is notable for a carved roof, with lions and a small cider barrel purportedly carved by the monks of Muchelney Abbey. Sir John Betjeman was also inspired by an inscription on the candelabra. The church is quite plain on the outside but inside is one of the finest wooden carved roofs in the county. It is shallow pitched with massive, richly decorated tie beams and short king posts. The whole area of the roof is divided into square carved panels set in the framework of the structural timbers which are decorated with carved bosses where they intersect. There are 640 panels each carved with the same quatrefoil design. In the triangular spaces above each beam are dragon-like beasts. It is said there are bullet holes in the timbers, caused by soldiers who camped in the church in 1646 before the Battle of Langport. The 17th century pulpit and altar table are Jacobean woodwork.

There are five other churches in the town, including Methodist and Catholic groups.

A grammar school in Somerton was first founded in the 1570s, and later was endowed as the Somerton Free Grammar School. In 1903, it became Somerton Free Church of England School, before merging with Montclefe in 1963. Monteclefe National School was founded in 1851 by the Pinney family of Somerton Erleigh.

Somerton Infants School and Monteclefe CEVA Junior school merged in September 2014 to form King Ina Academy, with Somerton Roundabout Preschool also amalgamating with the school, with the ultimate aim of having one building for the whole academy. Currently the institution is still based on two sites, however applications have been submitted to the Department of Education to be granted permission to build a new, one-building free school for King Ina Academy on one of three possible sites, all of which are situated in the western outskirts of the town.

<doc id="452233" wikidata="Q54961" url="?curid=452233" title="Harrow, London">
<text>Harrow () is a large town in Greater London, England, and serves as the principal settlement of the London Borough of Harrow. Lying about north-west of Charing Cross and south of Watford, the entire town including its localities had a population of 149,246 at the 2011 census, whereas the wider borough (which also contains Pinner and Stanmore) had a population of 250,149.

The original settlement was at Harrow on the Hill, atop the Harrow Hill. The modern town centre of Harrow developed at the foot of the hill, in an area historically called Greenhill, following the opening of Harrow-on-the-Hill station on the Metropolitan Railway in 1880. Harrow became the unofficial &quot;capital&quot; of the Metroland suburbia in the early 20th century. Harrow &amp; Wealdstone station on the West Coast Main Line had opened in 1837, but was more distant from Harrow, lying north of the hill. Workers were drawn to the area by the opening of several factories in Wealdstone; Harrow was the base of the large Kodak factory, used for the manufacture of photographic materials and R&amp;D, which was in operation for more than a century.

Historically in the hundred of Gore in the county of Middlesex, Harrow became part of Greater London in 1965. Today, the historic area is distinguished as Harrow on the Hill and is a conservation area with listed buildings of Georgian architecture and home to Harrow School, one of the seven major boys&#x27; boarding schools in England as defined by the Public Schools Act 1868. The modern-day town meanwhile is an established commercial centre of outer north-west London and houses a campus of the University of Westminster.

== Etymology ==
Harrow&#x27;s name comes from Old English &quot;hearg&quot; = &#x27;(heathen) temple&#x27;, which was probably on the hill of Harrow, where St. Mary&#x27;s Church now stands. The name has been studied in detail by Keith Briggs.

The original Greenhill hamlet derived its name from either an unidentified local green hill, or was imported from a manorial surname. It was not recorded in the Domesday Book but was mentioned as early as 1334 as &quot;Grenehulle&quot;. In addition, one or more families bearing the &quot;Greenhulle&quot; or &quot;Greenhill&quot; surname lived there from at least 1247, and are likely to have taken their name from this location. The name Greenhill survives and the local council has continued the name by using it for Greenhill Way, a road which by-passes the mainly-pedestrianised and modernised shopping area based around College Road and St Anns Road. The name is also still used for the local electoral ward.

It is possible that Greenhill went by an even older name, &quot;Norbury&quot;, c.1300, but the hamlet of Norbury has not been identified with certainty. The name may have been correspondent to Sudbury, being north of what was then Harrow Hill.

==History==
The modern town centre of Harrow was formerly known as Greenhill, and was a small hamlet of farms at the foot of Harrow Hill. For almost a millennium, the centre of Harrow was atop the hill, but this began to change during the 19th century. Circa 1852, the village had 8 houses, 17 cottages, and one inn, with 141 people. This area was part of the hundred of Gore, in the historic county of Middlesex. In 1850 a local board district was established for the central part of the ancient parish of Harrow on the Hill, including the old village and the adjoining hamlets of Greenhill, Roxeth, and Sudbury.

===Urban development===

By 1865, a series of roads had been built in Greenhill, including College, Roxborough, Kymberley, Headstone, Clarendon, Byron and St Anns - but few houses. A parish church, St John&#x27;s Church, was built in 1866 on a farm and Greenhill subsequently became a separate ecclesiastical parish in 1896. The church building has been Grade II listed since 1994. The Metropolitan Railway connection dates from 1880 with the building of Harrow-on-the-Hill station, which led to a housebuilding boom and a population of 4,892 by 1902. Developments westward along the railway in the Headstone and Pinner as well as Roxborough and Wealdstone engulfed Greenhill with new developments, and soon enough there was nothing left of the original village.
In 1899, the junction of Grove Hill and Lowlands Road is said to have been the scene of Britain&#x27;s first fatal car accident. There is a plaque to commemorate this at the top of Grove Hill where it meets the High Street and Peterborough Hill.

In Greenhill, there was a workmen&#x27;s club from the 1860s and a public hall, Victoria Hall, by 1888.

The Local Government Act 1894 converted local board districts such as Harrow on the Hill into urban districts. The new town centre which had grown up around the station became known simply as Harrow to distinguish it from the original hilltop village. The name of the urban district which contained both places remained Harrow on the Hill until 1934 when the district was enlarged and renamed just Harrow. The Harrow Urban District was incorporated to become a municipal borough in 1954, with the same area becoming the London Borough of Harrow on being transferred from Middlesex to Greater London in 1965. One of the oldest surviving buildings in what is today Harrow is the Grade I listed Headstone Manor from the 15th century.

Harrow contributed to the growing photographic industry in the UK; a large industrial premises was built in 1890 by the American Eastman Kodak company in Wealdstone, and by 1965 there were over 100 buildings on a 55-acre site at Kodak Harrow, employing 5,500 people, including a research centre. This facility operated for 125 years. The long chimney has been a landmark in Harrow ever since.
In 1914, a major department store named Sopers opened on Station Road. The site became a Debenhams store; it closed in May 2021 after the collapse of the Debenham&#x27;s chain. Its facade dated from the 1960s.

During the inter-war period Harrow had grown into a suburb. Almost two-thirds of housing stock in the present day Borough of Harrow dates back to the interwar period.

====Railway accidents====
The modern town of Harrow and much of the borough overall has been defined historically by the growth of the railways, as Harrow expanded and saw housing developments as a result of the building of the Metropolitan Railway into what was, in early Victorian times, the rural areas to the north-west of London. The borough now has many railway stations.

Harrow has been the location of several serious train accidents. 
On 7 August 1838, Thomas Port died from injuries received in a train accident near Harrow. His gravestone in the parish churchyard of St Mary&#x27;s, Harrow-on-the-Hill, states: &quot;To the memory of Thomas Port, son of John Port of Burton-upon-Trent in the County of Stafford, Hat Manufacturer, who near this town had both legs severed from his body by the railway train. With great fortitude, he bore a second amputation by the surgeons and died from loss of blood, August 7th 1838, aged 33 years.&quot;
On 26 November 1870, two trains collided at Harrow &amp; Wealdstone station, killing 9 and injuring 44.
On 8 October 1952, three trains collided at Harrow &amp; Wealdstone station, killing 112 people. Of the dead, 64 were railway employees on their way to work. This is the greatest loss of life in any United Kingdom railway accident in peacetime.

===Battle of Britain===
Although The Blitz is generally claimed to have started on 7 September 1940, many sources state that one of the earliest bombing raid from the Luftwaffe occurred in Harrow and Wealdstone on 22 August 1940. It caused damage to cinemas, houses and a bank, but with no fatalities. Although Harrow was then in Middlesex, it was classed as a London area by the civil defence as it came under the jurisdiction of the Metropolitan Police. The very first air raid on the present day London area is believed to be the accidental bombing of Croydon Airport on 15 August 1940, which was then in Surrey.

===Post-war===
The town was part of the Harrow Urban District, a district council within the county of Middlesex, from 1934 until 1965, which also included parts of Edgware, Hendon, Wembley and Pinner. The London Borough of Harrow was formed in 1965 as the only London borough unaffected by boundary changes.

By the 1950s, Harrow was described as the &quot;capital city of Metro-land&quot;. The borough&#x27;s council Civic Centre building complex was built in 1970–1972, opened 6 May 1973, on Station Road in Wealdstone. Six storeys high and designed by architect Eric Broughton, the building is considered &quot;outdated and costly&quot; in 2018 and was expected to be imminently redeveloped. Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, many new office blocks were built in the town, especially in Lyon Road and the western end of College Road.

In 1974, the Kodak Mural designed by Pentagram was completed on the first floor of the recently opened Civic Centre. It contains almost one thousand photographic tiles representing Harrow and designed to commemorate the town and borough&#x27;s links with Kodak.

The town underwent regeneration in the 1980s with the building of a bus station in College Road and the pedestrianisation of St Anns Road. A statue called &quot;Skipping Katie&quot; was unveiled by the local council in May 1987 to celebrate the completion of the pedestrianisation. The landmark was designed by James Butler inspired by watching his daughter skip. A plaque on Katie was unveiled in 2004 by Queen Elizabeth II and the Duke of Edinburgh to mark the 50th anniversary of the London Borough of Harrow.

In the autumn of 1987, Diana, Princess of Wales visited Harrow, where she officially opened the new St Anns shopping centre amid a large crowd of locals. Located opposite the central train station on College Road, the centre was built on demolished buildings including Heathfield School for Girls, which moved away to Pinner in 1982.

Nearby St Anns shopping centre, another indoor retail outlet was built which was opened as St George&#x27;s Shopping and Leisure Centre on St George&#x27;s Day in 1996. The town&#x27;s Woolworths store on Station Road closed and was replaced by a new branch inside St George&#x27;s. Other landmarks built during the decade include the Hygeia building in 1991, which has an erected golden coloured sculpture of Roman goddess Hygeia facing the bus station. Furthermore, in 1991, Lower Mead stadium on Station Road, the home of Wealdstone F.C., was sold to Tesco and demolished. In its place a new large Tesco superstore was built.

===21st century===

The town centre has undergone a new wave of redevelopment. In 2011, the one-way single lane section of Station Road was widened to allow two-way bus traffic. The 11 storey luxury apartments of Bradstowe House were completed in 2016 after long delays. Former office buildings on Lyon Road (including Coal House, once belonging to the National Coal Board) have been regenerated into new mixed use buildings in the 2010s, whereas on Pinner Road behind St George&#x27;s centre a new eight storey development called Trident Point was built which includes a Morrisons supermarket opened in 2013. The former post-office sorting building on College Road, next to the train station, remained vacant for some years until plans for a 19-storey skyscraper were approved by the council in 2015. The development, called Harrow Square, was partly completed with 318 apartments across four buildings in 2018. It includes a bottom floor library still under construction which will replace the current Gayton Library on St John&#x27;s Road. The building next to it, formerly First National House, has been refurbished into luxury apartments called The Hub.

The borough received a £1 million grant from the Mayor of London that will go towards a new public square and a &quot;pop-up test eatery&quot; at the site of the former Cumberland Hotel on Lyon Road, expected to be completed by 2020. The 1930s art deco facade of the Safari Cinema, which has been hidden since the 1960s, is set to be restored from 2020. The council aims to invest over a billion in the town centres of Harrow and Wealdstone and the Station Road corridor in between.

==Geography==

The borough of Harrow has a leafy, suburban character, much of which is a legacy of it being at the centre of the Metroland developments of the early 20th century.

The town centre is about above sea level, almost below the top of Harrow Hill, which is an outlying knoll. The hill is half a mile south of the town centre, and the settlement contains historic architecture and has a village atmosphere. The steep climb towards the hill is clearly visible from Lowlands Road. Other parts of Harrow are not as affluent but are still mostly leafy, particularly the northern part called Harrow Weald. The rural northern slopes of Harrow, around Harrow Weald Common, are part of the Green Belt and contain a conservation area and a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) adjacent to another SSSI called Bentley Priory Nature Reserve which comes under Stanmore. The area also has the highest elevation in Harrow, as high as above sea level.
There is also agricultural land close by the town, on fields at the eastern side of Harrow on the Hill, on Watford Road. This open farmland is only half a mile away from Harrow&#x27;s town centre and is adjacent to Northwick Park Hospital and Northwick Park open space. The farm borders Harrow Park and other open spaces and golf courses that are within Harrow on the Hill; other open spaces include: The Grove open space and Harrow Recreation Ground near the town centre; West Harrow Recreation Ground; Kenton Recreation Ground; Alexandra Park in South Harrow; Newton Park in Rayners Lane; Byron Recreation Ground in Wealdstone; and the grounds of Headstone Manor.

Much of Kenton, and before 1716 all of Pinner, were parts of Harrow. Pinner is now a separate district within the borough of Harrow. Harrow Weald is the district north of Wealdstone, and both of these are historically also part of Harrow. It is the principal settlement of the London Borough of Harrow, which also includes the towns of Pinner and Stanmore.

The Harrow postcode area covers the entire borough and stretches into neighbouring boroughs: west into Ruislip and Northwood, and east to Edgware and Wembley. The postcodes for Harrow town itself are HA1, HA2 and HA3.
Harrow is from Pinner, each from Wembley, Stanmore and Northolt, and from Ruislip.

==Economy==

Central Harrow forms a commercial hub in the north-west of Greater London, with many retail outlets and commercial offices, and increasingly residential apartments in more recent regeneration schemes. Harrow is classified as one of 13 metropolitan centres in the London Plan.

The area has two shopping centres, St Anns and St George&#x27;s, containing chain stores typical of British high streets. There are also parades of shops throughout Station Road and the ascending, traditional College Road, and over of a fully pedestranised shopping/café streets roads (north of St Anns). A large Debenhams department store ( of floorspace) was on Station Road. After Debenhams was liquidated, the site is to become an independent department store called The Landmark due to open on 14 October 2021. There are also large Morrisons and Tesco superstores. As of 2012, Harrow has of total town centre floorspace, the lowest of London&#x27;s metropolitan centres.
The creation of St George&#x27;s in 1996, less than a decade after St Anns, gave Harrow a stronger competitive retail standing. On one index, the town centre&#x27;s league position went from 106th (out of 1,000) to 71st (out of 1,400) from the mid-1980s to mid-1990s. Harrow&#x27;s competing shopping centres were recognised to be Watford, Uxbridge and Brent Cross Shopping Centre. A 2003 council report showed that Harrow was less competitive as a retail centre by comparison.

In 2015, Harrow ranked 99th in the Hot 100 UK retail locations published by CACI; it was 5th in Greater London, behind Croydon, Kingston upon Thames, Bromley and Enfield Town. In 2018, Harrow was ranked 59th in the nationwide &quot;High Street Investment Ranking&quot; carried out by Knight Frank, and 6th in Greater London beaten by Uxbridge and Richmond.

The Wealdstone district has a strong industrial connection, having been the location for the manufactures Winsor &amp; Newton (artists&#x27; materials), Whitefriars Glass, and Kodak.

==Demography==

The town includes its localities within the Harrow post town: Harrow on the Hill, Harrow Weald, Headstone, North Harrow, Kenton, Rayners Lane, South Harrow, Wealdstone and West Harrow. The Borough&#x27;s population was 250,149 in 2011.

Harrow Borough&#x27;s proportion of Jewish, Muslim and Hindu residents is above average. The ethnic minority population includes a large and established Gujarati Indian community, who originally settled in large numbers in the borough after their expulsion from Uganda in 1972.

The highest life expectancy (as of 2009–2013) for females was 89.5 years in Headstone North, and for males was 83.8 years in West Harrow. The lowest expectancies were 82.4 years in Wealdstone and 78.6 years in Greenhill respectively. The median age was highest in Headstone North (40 years) and lowest in Greenhill and Wealdstone (both 33 years). The life expectancies for Harrow are lower than both Pinner and Stanmore in the borough.

According to a 2018 survey by the Office for National Statistics (ONS), the borough of Harrow was the &quot;happiest&quot; in London and scored higher than the English average. Adversely, in another survey by an estate agent in 2019 the borough was found to be the &quot;least friendly&quot; in London.

Average house prices within the borough stood at £479,682 as of 2017.

==Governance==
Harrow Council has been governed by the Labour Party since 2014. The town of Harrow generally is represented by 13 wards, each represented by three councillors.

Harrow is in the Brent and Harrow constituency for the London Assembly which has been represented since May 2021 by Krupesh Hirani (Labour). Prior to this, it was represented by Navin Shah (Labour) between 2008 and 2021.

==Education==
Harrow is best known for Harrow School. An independent boarding school for boys, founded in 1572, Harrow School is considered one of the finest secondary schools in the world. The nearby John Lyon School is another boys&#x27; independent school, while another known school is the North London Collegiate School for girls located further in the borough in Edgware.

Harrow is also home to a large University of Westminster campus, located near Northwick Park and the hospital. It serves as the university&#x27;s base for Media, Arts and Design. The school dates back to 1897 specialising in art, photography and fashion, becoming a college in the 1960s under the name Harrow College of Higher Education. It merged with Polytechnic of Central London (PCL) in 1990, now known as the University of Westminster.

Other educational institutes in or near central Harrow include: Harrow High School, Whitmore High School, St Dominic&#x27;s Sixth Form College, Salvatorian College and Harrow College.

Greenhill School was built in the 1880s, but the building was demolished in 1967 to make way for shops on St Anns Road. The site is now home to a Marks &amp; Spencer.

==Culture==
===Arts===

The borough&#x27;s Harrow Arts Centre is located in Pinner and includes a theatre and several meeting rooms for various arts groups.

The St George&#x27;s centre has a large Vue cinema. Formerly Sheepcote Road was home to Granada Theatre, opened in 1937, which became a 3 screen cinema in 1973. The building, interior designed by Theodore Komisarjevsky, was Grade II listed in 1988. The cinema went through ownership and name changes from 1989 until it was permanently closed in 1996, six months after the other cinema opening at St George&#x27;s. After a few years in a derelict condition, the building became a health club gymnasium operated by Gold&#x27;s Gym. The theatre&#x27;s original Wurlitzer organ is retained in the building, although currently not accessible to the public, although it reported to remain in perfect working condition.

An art-deco cinema called Dominion opened in 1936 adjoining Lower Mead football ground, on much of the site of Greenhill Farm. It was later purchased by ABC Cinemas, and the Dominion&#x27;s original art deco design (by F.E. Bromige) was covered in new metal cladding in 1962. In the 1970s the lower floor was converted to a bingo hall and in the 1990s the cinema became the Safari, showing Bollywood films. This closed in the 20teens and it was not until January 2020 when plans to restore the art deco (and building 78 flats at the site) were approved by Harrow council. This is currently under re-construction.

===Religion===

Some of the major churches in Harrow include the Grade I listed St Mary&#x27;s Church, St John&#x27;s Greenhill, All Saints Harrow Weald, Holy Trinity Wealdstone, Christ Church Roxeth, and Kenton Methodist Church.

Harrow has a Hindu temple dedicated to Sri Lord Ayyappa and is known as Sri Ayyappan Kovil, located in the Wealdstone neighbourhood. In the same area is the large Harrow Central Mosque, and a smaller local mosque, Masjid Imam Muqbil, is located in South Harrow. On Bessborough Road in the town is the Mosaic Reform Synagogue, and there is a United Synagogue in the Kenton part of Harrow. There is a Zoroastrianism centre in Rayners Lane.

The wedding of characters Peggy Mitchell and Frank Butcher of &quot;EastEnders&quot; in 1999 was filmed in Harrow. The classroom in &quot;Harry Potter and the Philosopher&#x27;s Stone&quot; was filmed at the Fourth Form Room of Harrow School. The school was also used to shoot many scenes of the drama &quot;The Crown&quot;. The British Asian soap drama &quot;Cloud 9&quot; was shot in Harrow in 2013. The exterior of Clark&#x27;s house in the 2016 film &quot;Me Before You&quot; was shot in Harrow.

The &quot;Harrow Times&quot; is a local newspaper for the borough, and formerly the historic &quot;Harrow Observer&quot; that dates back to the 19th century. The &quot;Brent &amp; Kilburn Times&quot; and &quot;Watford Observer&quot; also cover Harrow.

Radio Harrow is a local charity radio that broadcasts from Northwick Park Hospital.

== Transport ==
===Rail and London Underground===

Harrow is served by many London Underground and National Rail services:

*Harrow-on-the-Hill (Metropolitan line &amp; Aylesbury Line/Chiltern Railways)
*Harrow &amp; Wealdstone (Bakerloo line, London Overground, London Northwestern Railway and Southern)
*West Harrow (Metropolitan line)
*South Harrow (Piccadilly line)
*Rayners Lane (Metropolitan/Piccadilly lines)
*North Harrow (Metropolitan line)

*Northwick Park (Metropolitan line) [On boundary between Brent &amp; Harrow]
*Sudbury Hill (Piccadilly line)

Harrow-on-the-Hill is the town&#x27;s central station, located on College Road/Lowlands Road. The station provides direct Underground and rail links to the West End, the City, Uxbridge, and through the Chiltern Hills to Aylesbury. The other major station - and both the largest and busiest of Harrow - is Harrow &amp; Wealdstone, a short distance north from the town, which has direct trains to the West End, Croydon, Gatwick Airport, Watford, Hemel Hempstead and beyond towards Brighton and Birmingham respectively. Both stations are in Travelcard zone 5. Trains towards Gerrards Cross are served by the smaller Sudbury Hill Harrow station which also provides an alternative route towards the West Midlands.

Harrow-on-the-Hill is a much busier tube station compared with the town&#x27;s other principal station, Harrow &amp; Wealdstone, recording over 10.3 million London Underground passengers in 2018/2019. However, the latter is served more extensively by National Rail services, as well as the London Overground and because of this it&#x27;s a busier National Rail station.

A short railway line called the Stanmore branch line formerly ran from Harrow &amp; Wealdstone via Belmont to , but this line was closed in 1964.

On 23 December 1991, the IRA exploded a bomb on a train at Harrow-on-the-Hill station; there were no injuries.

===Bus===

Harrow bus station is adjacent to St Anns shopping centre and Harrow on the Hill railway station. All buses are managed by Transport for London and links are provided to Ruislip, Watford, Edgware, Northwood, Golders Green, Wembley, Ealing, Hayes and Heathrow Airport. Many local buses have a H-prefix in the range 9–19.

During the privatisation of London bus services, Harrow was one of the first places with its own London Regional Transport operating unit, called Harrow Buses and operating from November 1987 in red and cream branded livery. The scheme was not successful and the service gained the nickname &quot;Harrowing Buses&quot; from the local press.

Harrow was the place where the first major electronic contactless smart card technology was being tested on buses. In a £2 million trial that started in February 1994, cards were provided by London Transport at the bus station and could be used on 21 bus routes in Harrow, the largest trial of its kind in the world. Within two months, 9,000 smart photocards were issued. The scheme was a success by the time it ended in December 1995, and led to the development of the Oyster card in 2003.

===Road===
There are no trunk roads in the vicinity of Harrow. The A312 road starts in Harrow as Bessborough Road - however the A312&#x27;s section in Harrow is merely an urban road, and the primary trunk road starts over 3 miles away in Northolt.

<doc id="452239" wikidata="Q1000115" url="?curid=452239" title="Faversham">
<text>Faversham () is a market town in Kent, England, from Sittingbourne, from London and from Canterbury, next to the Swale, a strip of sea separating mainland Kent from the Isle of Sheppey in the Thames Estuary. It is close to the A2, which follows an ancient British trackway which was used by the Romans and the Anglo-Saxons, and known as Watling Street. The name is of Old English origin, meaning &quot;the metal-worker&#x27;s village&quot;. 

There has been a settlement at Faversham since pre-Roman times, next to the ancient sea port on Faversham Creek. It was inhabited by the Saxons and mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086 as &quot;Favreshant&quot;. The town was favoured by King Stephen who established Faversham Abbey, which survived until the Dissolution of the Monasteries in 1538. Subsequently, the town became an important seaport and established itself as a centre for brewing, and the Shepherd Neame Brewery, founded in 1698, remains a significant major employer.

The town was also the centre of the explosives industry between the 17th and early 20th century, before a decline following an accident in 1916 which killed over 100 workers. This coincided with a revival of the shipping industry in the town. Faversham has a number of landmarks, with several historic churches including St Mary of Charity, Faversham Parish Church, the Maison Dieu and Faversham Recreation Ground. Faversham Market has been established for over 900 years and is still based in the town centre. There are good road and rail links, including a Southeastern service to the High Speed 1 line at Ebbsfleet International and London.

==Name==
The name &quot;Faversham&quot;, first attested in 811 as &quot;Fefresham&quot;, derives from Old English. The second element is the Old English word &quot;hām&quot; (&#x27;settlement&#x27;), which is common in place-names. The first element, however, is unique. It has been inferred to derive from an otherwise lost Old English word *&quot;fæfere&quot; (&#x27;smith&#x27;), which in turn derived from the Latin &quot;faber&quot; (&#x27;craftsman, smith&#x27;). Thus the name once meant &#x27;smith&#x27;s homestead&#x27;. Given its Latin derivation, however, the name may have referred specifically to Roman smiths.

==History==
===Early history===
Faversham was established as a settlement before the Roman conquest. The Romans established several towns in Kent including Faversham, with traffic through the Saxon Shore ports of Reculver, Richborough, Dover and Lympne converging on Canterbury before heading up Watling Street to London. The town was less than from Canterbury, and consequently Faversham had become established on this road network by 50 AD following the initial conquest by Claudius in 43 AD. Numerous remains of Roman buildings have been discovered in and around Faversham, including under St Mary of Charity Church where coins and urns were discovered during reconstruction of the western tower in 1794. In 2013, the remains of a 2,000-year-old Roman theatre, able to accommodate some 12,000 people, were discovered at a hillside near the town. The cockpit-style outdoor auditorium, the first of its kind found in Britain, was a style the Romans used elsewhere in their empire on the Continent.

There is archaeological evidence to suggest that Faversham was a summer capital for the Saxon kings of Kent. It was held in royal demesne in 811, and is further cited in a charter granted by Coenwulf, the King of Mercia. Coenwulf described the town as &#x27;the King&#x27;s little town of Fefresham&#x27;, while it was recorded in the Domesday Book as &quot;Favreshant&quot;. The town had established itself as a seaport by the Middle Ages, and became part of the Confederation of the Cinque Ports in the 13th century, providing a vessel to Dover. The Gough Map of Britain, printed in 1360, shows the Swale as an important shipping channel for trade.

===Middle Ages===
The manor was recorded as &quot;Terra Regis&quot;, meaning it was part of the ancient royal estates. King Stephen gave it to his chief lieutenant, William of Ypres, but soon made him swap it with Lillechurch (now Higham) so that the manor of Faversham could form part of the endowment of Faversham Abbey. Stephen established the abbey in 1148, and is buried there with his consort Matilda of Boulogne, and his son, Eustace, the Earl of Boulogne. Stephen favoured the town because of the abbey, and so it was historically important during his reign. King John tried to give the church to Simon of Wells in 1201, but it was owned by the monks of St Augustine&#x27;s Abbey at Canterbury, who appealed to Rome and the request was denied. Abbey Street was constructed about this time in order to provide an appropriate approach to the abbey from the town. It still houses timber-framed buildings and has been described as &quot;the finest medieval street in southeast England&quot;.

Thomas Culpeper was granted Faversham Abbey by Henry VIII during the Dissolution of the Monasteries in 1538. Most of the abbey was demolished, and the remains of Stephen were rumoured to have been thrown into Faversham Creek. An excavation of the abbey in 1964 uncovered the empty graves. The entrance gates survived the demolition and lasted until the mid-18th century, but otherwise only a small section of outer wall survived. The abbey&#x27;s masonry was taken to Calais to reinforce defence of the town, then in British possession, against the French army. In 1539, the ground upon which the abbey had stood, along with nearby land, passed to Sir Thomas Cheney, Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports.

Among the few surviving buildings of Faversham Abbey are the two barns at Abbey Farm. Minor Barn was built about 1425; Major Barn, the larger of the two, dates from 1476. Next to the barns is the Abbey Farmhouse, part of which dates from the 14th century. The Abbey Guest house, on the east side of the Abbey&#x27;s Outer Gateway, has survived as Arden&#x27;s House. This house, now a private residence in Abbey Street, was the location of the murder of Thomas Arden in 1551. The Faversham Almshouses were founded and endowed by Thomas Manfield in 1614, with additional houses built by Henry Wright in 1823.

The poor quality of roads in the Middle Ages meant travel by sea was an important transport corridor. Richard Tylman (or Tillman), mayor in 1581, expanded the port at Faversham, building two wharfs. He became a key figure in exporting corn, wheat and malt to London from the town.

Several notable people in the Middle Ages had origins in Faversham. Haymo of Faversham was born in Faversham and later moved to Paris to join the Franciscans, becoming the &quot;Aristotelian of Aristotelians&quot;. Simon of Faversham was born in the town in the middle of the 13th century and later became Chancellor of the University of Oxford in 1304. The notorious pirate Jack Ward is believed to have been born in Faversham about 1553. John Wilson, lutenist and teacher was born in Faversham in 1595 who was the principal composer for the King&#x27;s Men and a professor of music at Oxford. There is now a plaque at the site of the house in Abbey Street where he was born. 

Faversham also had notable visitors during this period. Queen Mary and King Philip visited the town in July 1557 en route to Dover. Queen Elizabeth I visited Faversham in September 1573 during a summer tour of Kent, accompanied by Lord Burleigh, the Lord Treasurer. Charles II passed the town on his way from Dover to London, on his way to be crowned.

===Explosives industry===
A gunpowder plant had been established around 1573 in Faversham. The town had a stream which could be dammed at intervals to provide power for watermills. It became known as the Home Works in the 18th century and was nationalised in 1759. By the 19th century, the site stretched for around a mile along the waterfront. A second explosive works was established at Oare to the northwest of town in the late 17th century, with the Marsh Works following in 1786. Towards the end of the 19th century, two new factories were built alongside the Swale to manage production of TNT and cordite. Faversham developed six explosive factories, and from 1874 to 1919, the town was the centre of the explosives industry in the UK.

The first production of guncotton took place in the Marsh Works in 1847. Due to a lack of experience with production methods, an explosion took place soon after work started, with several fatalities. On Sunday 2 April 1916, an explosion occurred at one of the Swale factories in Uplees after sparks from a chimney ignited the works containing around 150 tonnes of high explosives. The incident killed over 100 people, which led to decline of the explosives industry in the town. Later accounts suggested that had the incident not happened on a Sunday, there would have been many more casualties.

All three gunpowder factories shut in 1934 due to the impending threat of World War II. Production was moved to Ardeer in Ayrshire, Scotland, and the munition industry around Faversham is now extinct. The town is now a harbour and market community; old sail-powered Thames barges are repaired, rebuilt and moored along the creekside.

===Industrial Revolution and beyond===
Kent is the centre of hop-growing in England, being centred on nearby Canterbury and Faversham has been the home of several breweries. The Shepherd Neame Brewery was officially founded in 1698, though brewing activities in Faversham pre-date this. The brewery claims to be the oldest in Britain and continues to be family-owned. The Rigden brewery was founded in the early 18th century by Edward Rigden. It subsequently merged with the Canterbury-based George Beer in 1922 to become George Beer &amp; Rigden before being purchased by the Maidstone based Fremlin&#x27;s. Whitbread bought out Fremlin&#x27;s in 1967, and closed the Faversham brewery in 1990. The site is now a Tesco superstore. Shepherd Neame remains a significant regional brewer despite a decline in consumption of traditional bitter beer, producing around 230,000 barrels a year. It now also makes India Pale Ale under licence. Lieutenant-General Sir Philip Neame, recipient of the Victoria Cross, was born in Faversham and a memorial to him was placed in the town centre in 2014.

A shipyard was established in Faversham by James Pollock &amp; Sons (Shipbuilders) in 1916 at the request of Lord Fisher, the First Lord of The Admiralty, for manufacturing barges for landing craft. Faversham already had a tradition of shipbuilding, and it soon became a major contributor to markets throughout the world, producing vessels such as the Molliette and the Violette, both constructed of concrete. Over 1200 ships were built and launched from Faversham between 1916 and 1969.

Faversham Market is still held in the town centre. It is now the oldest street market in Kent, dating back over 900 years. Monthly markets are also held in Preston Street and Court Street.

Having been an important thoroughfare since the 12th century, Abbey Street went into decline around the start of the 20th. Some buildings on the street adjoining Quay Lane were demolished in 1892 and much of the entire street was intended for demolition as recently as the 1950s, until intervention from the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings. Local people began a determined fight to restore and preserve the area.

=== Archaeology ===
In May 2019, the Kent Archaeological Field School uncovered a Roman building at Abbey Farm. According to Dr Paul Wilkinson, the building contained broken stone walls covering huge amounts of box flue tiles, which were used to direct hot air up the indoor walls, glazed terracotta floors, an untouched underfloor with hypocaust heating, and tons of ceramic roof tiles. Although the plaster painted from these walls was mostly white, plaster walls coloured with green, red and yellow panels were found in the hot sauna room on the north side of the building.

In 2009 Faversham Society Archaeology Research Group (FSARG) uncovered evidence of the town&#x27;s medieval tannery in the back gardens of Tanner Street. Evidence of Anglo-Saxon occupation was discovered during the Hunt the Saxons project between 2005 and 2007 and a high-status rubbish pit excavated in the &quot;Searching for the Kings Manor&quot; project in 2017–2019.

==Government==
A charter was granted to the Mayor of Faversham, Jurats and Freemen of the Town of Faversham in 1546, and regranted 1685; the town council was established under the Municipal Corporations Act 1835. The parliamentary constituency of Faversham was created for the 1885 general election and replaced by the new constituencies of Sittingbourne and Sheppey and Faversham and Mid Kent at the 1997 general election. The town has been represented by a Member of Parliament from the Conservative Party other than between 1945 and 1970. Since 2015, the constituency&#x27;s MP has been Conservative Helen Whately.

Faversham is within the Swale local government district. The town contains the four electoral wards of Abbey, Davington Priory, St Ann&#x27;s and Watling.

Faversham was a large ancient parish, which included rural areas and surrounding villages. It became a civil parish in 1866, but in 1894 was divided into Faversham Within and Faversham Without. In 1935 the civil parish of Faversham was recreated and absorbed the civil parishes of Faversham Within, Davington, Preston Within, North Preston Without and South Preston Without, and parts of the civil parishes of Faversham Without, Luddenham and Ospringe (including the village of Ospringe).

The arms of Faversham Town Council, which holds its meetings at Faversham Guildhall, are based on the Royal Arms of England, alluding to the town&#x27;s regal history.

==Geography==
Faversham is roughly equidistant between Sittingbourne and Canterbury. It lies south east of London, east of Maidstone, and north from Ashford. Nearby villages include Oare across Oare Creek to the north, Luddenham, Mockbeggar and Ospringe.

Geographically, Faversham sits at a boundary between marshland to the north and a mixture of brick earth, gravel and chalk to the south which leads into the North Downs. Faversham Creek connects the town to the Swale that separates mainland Kent from the Isle of Sheppey. The surrounding area is part of the South Swale Nature Reserve, popular with wildfowl and wading birds. The coastline around Faversham is a by-product of the changes to sea level around Britain since the end of the last ice age. During Roman Britain and into the first millennium, the Faversham coast was a large estuary with Oare and Graveney being peninsulas. Land reclamation during the Middle Ages, which closed the River Wantsum and connected the Isle of Thanet to mainland Kent, resulted in less tidal waters reaching Faversham. This led to the gradual silting up of estuaries; Faversham Creek and its tributaries have been reduced from to . To stop the creek silting up completely and making navigation impossible, a number of sluices have been installed since the 16th century.

===Climate===
Faversham formerly held the weather record for the highest ever UK temperature (in 2003) at . This was the first time the recorded temperature had ever exceeded reliably in the UK. This record had stood for nearly 16 years, but was beaten by 0.2 °C (0.4 °F) with a temperature of recorded in the Cambridge University Botanic Garden on 25 July 2019. Faversham still holds the record for the highest maximum temperature in the UK for August with the previous record in 2003.

The absolute minimum temperature of was set in January 1966.

==Demographics==
At the 2011 UK census, Faversham had a population of 19,316, an increase of 1,606 from the 2001 census. The population figures were split into Abbey (6,084), Davington Priory (2,593), St Ann&#x27;s (5,268) and Watling (5,371). 9,770 people were employed within the town, split into retail (1,416), education (1,239), health and social work (1,200), construction (836) and manufacturing (692). 17,868 of the town&#x27;s residents were born in England.

==Culture==

&quot;Arden of Feversham&quot; is a play about the murder of Thomas Arden written around 1590, possibly by William Shakespeare or Canterbury-born Christopher Marlowe. It gives its name to the modern Arden Theatre in the town, Local theatre groups perform in the theatre as part of the Canterbury Festival each autumn.

The Royal Cinema is based near the town square. It opened in 1936 and is now Grade II listed. It is one of only two mock Tudor cinemas to survive in the UK.

The Faversham Society was established in 1962, and is one of the oldest civic societies in the UK. It owns and manages the Fleur de Lis Heritage Centre as its headquarters. The Centre hosts a large museum depicting the town&#x27;s history and culture and hosts the town&#x27;s Visitor Information Centre, including a bookshop.

The Maison Dieu (&#x27;House of God&#x27;), located on the A2 to the southwest of the town centre, is a hospital, monastery, hostel, retirement home and Royal lodge commissioned by Henry III in 1234 and now in the care of English Heritage. It is now managed by the Maison Dieu Trust and closely associated to the Faversham Society as a museum of Roman artefacts from the surrounding area.

Davington Priory lies to the northwest of the town centre and was founded in the mid 12th century. It is currently owned and occupied by musician and activist Bob Geldof.

Brogdale Farm, to the south of the town centre, has hosted the DEFRA National Fruit Collection since 1954. It has over 2,040 varieties of apple, 502 of pear, 350 of plum, 322 of cherry and smaller collections of bush fruits, nuts and grapes, all grown in of orchards. The farm hosts a number of fruit festivals throughout the year, guided tours and activities for schools. It also hosts the 9-inch Faversham miniature railway which runs through the orchards.

In 2011 it was discovered that the town owns an original version of Magna Carta, potentially worth about £20m, rather than a copy worth only £10,000. In 2015, the copy went on display to the public at the town&#x27;s Alexander Centre – the first time it had been on display for 715 years. The Magna Carta and other town charters are now on permanent display in 12 Market Place in Faversham.
The 2021 Tamil Film &quot;Jagame Thandhiram&quot; starring Dhanush was partly filmed in Faversham, including the Iron Wharf.

In August 2023 a copy of a prayer book written by Katharine Parr was found and put on display in the Fleur de Lis Heritage Centre in Faversham. This is the first book printed in English written by a woman.

==Media==
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC South East and ITV1 Meridian. Television signals are received from the Dover and Bluebell Hill transmitters as well as a local relay situated to the south west of the town.

Faversham&#x27;s local radio stations are BBC Radio Kent, Heart South, Gold, KMFM Canterbury and Radio Faversham is a community based radio station. The local newspapers are Faversham Times, The Faversham News, Eye and yourswale.

==Community facilities==

Faversham Recreation Ground (locally known as Faversham Rec, or simply The Rec) is to the east of the town centre. It was established in 1860 by a local solicitor, Henry Wreight, who bequeathed his £70,000 estate, including two almshouses housing 70 people, to the town in order that locals would have an area to enjoy. The rec has been preserved and is now run by the town&#x27;s Municipal Charities. A bandstand was added towards the end of the 19th century, and sporting events began to be held on the rec. A week-long party was held to celebrate the Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in 1953, which drew praise from Princess Andrei of Russia, then living near Faversham. A 50-year extension on the lease, signed in 2010, confirmed its continued use by the public.

The Oare Gunpowder Works, close to the scene of the 1916 explosion at Uplees, is now a country park and nature reserve open to the public free of charge. The Oare Marshes are an important reserve for birds. There is an information centre near the site of the former Harty ferry over the Swale to the Isle of Sheppey. Remains of the process houses and other mill leats have been conserved, and various trails are signposted. An early 20th century electric-powered gunpowder mill which was transferred to Ardeer in 1934 has been repatriated to the country park and is on display. The 18th-century works bell has also been repatriated and is on display at Faversham&#x27;s Fleur de Lis Heritage Centre. Stonebridge Pond, on the site of the original Chart Mills, was donated to Swale Borough Council in the early 1980s. It is now a haven for wading birds.
==Landmarks==
Faversham Stone Chapel (in Norton, Buckland and Stone) is the remains of the Church of Our Lady of Elwarton, an ancient monument managed by The Faversham Society. It was originally used for pagan rituals in pre-Roman Britain, and is the only remaining evidence in Britain of a church incorporating a pagan shrine. The building was converted into a church around AD601 when Pope Gregory I encouraged pagan buildings to be converted rather than destroyed. The church has not seen service since the 16th century and was reported as &quot;being in a state of disrepair&quot; and unused since the Reformation.

Although Faversham Abbey was dissolved by Henry VIII the nearby St Mary of Charity, Faversham Parish Church remains, and has been a Grade I listed building since 1950. The church was established in 1147 by King Stephen and Queen Matilda, with a distinctive spire added around 1794 – 97 that can be easily seen from many places around the town. The interior was restored in the mid-19th century by the architect Sir George Gilbert Scott, who redesigned the nave and transepts and added a stone encasing to the spire. The church reputedly contains the remains of King Stephen, which were recovered from Faversham Creek after the dissolution of the abbey. The church holds an altar dedicated to Saints Crispin and Crispinian, who reportedly fled to Faversham in the 3rd century. 

St Catherine&#x27;s Church dates from the Norman period and was extensively restored in the 1860s. The nearby Ospringe Church, to the southwest of town, dates from Norman Britain, aside from a replacement tower built in 1866. The National Shrine of Saint Jude is a Roman Catholic shrine in the Church of Our Lady of Mount Carmel. It was established in 1955 and regularly attracts Christian pilgrims and various tourists. It is part of a number pilgrimage routes (from London, Aylesford, Ramsgate). 
The Grade II listed St John the Evangelist church on Upper Brents was built in 1881 by Kirk and Son of Sleaford, It was founded by Mrs Hall of Syndale House, Faversham, the widow of a gunpowder manufacturer.

The historic central area, especially the part-pedestrian parts between the station and the creek, attracts visitors, who can learn about the town&#x27;s history and features at the Fleur-de-Lis centre, which provides tourist information and houses a museum. There is still a regular market several days each week in the market square where the Guildhall stands. Nearby streets feature old pubs, almshouses, shops and a growing collection of art galleries and restaurants.

Faversham Cottage Hospital opened in 1887. It was extended in 1922 and included a World War I memorial, which was unveiled by Vice Admiral Hugh Evan-Thomas. The memorial was later adapted to commemorate World War II casualties. In 2014, the memorial became Grade II listed.

Faversham Cemetery opened in 1898. The chapel was designed by Edwin Pover. 73 victims of the 1916 gunpowder explosion are buried in the cemetery, where they are commemorated by the Grade II* listed Faversham Munitions Explosion Memorial. Also interred at the cemetery is the Irish novelist Kate O&#x27;Brien.

==Transport==
Faversham is close to the A2 road, a historically important route from London to Canterbury and the Channel ports. The route began as an ancient trackway which the Romans later paved and marked as &quot;&quot; (Second Route) on the Antonine Itinerary. The Anglo-Saxons named it &quot;Wæcelinga Stræt&quot; (Watling Street) and it was marked as such by Matthew Paris in his &quot;Schema Britannie&quot; in 1250. The road continued to be an important thoroughfare, and is shown next to Faversham on Philip Symonson&#x27;s map of Kent published in 1596.

The A2 road still carries traffic between Sittingbourne and Canterbury, though London bound traffic now takes the M2 motorway. The A299 Thanet Way provides access to the Isle of Thanet and the A251 Ashford Road is a local road to Ashford. The Mall is one of the main roads to the town centre from the A2. It was built in the late 18th century as a dignified approach road, and attracted development of villas along its length. 

Faversham railway station opened in 1858. It was completely rebuilt in 1898 and is listed Grade II. A former goods shed built as part of the original railway works is also Grade II listed. Southeastern services travel to London, terminating at either Victoria or St Pancras. In the other direction, trains travel either to Dover Priory (via Canterbury East) or to Ramsgate (via Margate). Since 2009 services via High Speed 1 services have linked Faversham to Ebbsfleet International, Stratford International and London St Pancras.

The town is served by a number of buses. Arriva Southern Counties runs service 333 to Sittingbourne and Stagecoach in East Kent operates routes 3,3X,3A,3B to Canterbury, and route 666 to Ashford. Regent also runs service 638 to Whitstable and 660 to Stalisfield Green and Graveney. National Cycle Route 1 passes through the town, en route from Whitstable to Sittingbourne. Swale Borough Council have expressed concern over the lack of bus and cycle facilities in the town, when compared to road and rail, and there is a particular lack of public transport to nearby rural areas.

==Education==
There has been a school in Faversham since the twelfth century. Archival evidence has shown this had become a grammar school by 1420. In 1526, John Cole, chaplain to Henry VII and Henry VIII and Warden of All Souls College, Oxford, established a new grammar school on the estate of Ewell Farm. The property fell into disuse after the dissolution of the abbey, and a replacement grammar school was not established until 1587. The Wreights School, a commercial school, was founded in 1856, while a corresponding girls&#x27; school, The Gibbs School was established in 1883. The two boys&#x27; schools were amalgamated in 1920, forming Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s Grammar School. The current school dates from 1967, when the boys and girls schools were merged, forming the first co-educational grammar school in Kent.

The Abbey School is a Business and Enterprise Academy formed in September 1983 by the amalgamation of the Ethelbert Road Boys School and Lady Capel School for Girls. It has over 1000 pupils and is located in the south of the town, beside the A2 London Road.

The Faversham Institute was founded in 1862 in East Street, Faversham. Membership was open to everybody with a small subscription fee. It consisted of meeting rooms, halls and a library. Exams could be studied for and sat at the Institute. The Institute published a monthly journal until December 1919. After a local government reorganisation the Institute was demolished in 1979. 

Faversham Library is part of Kent Libraries and a branch library managed by Kent County Council. The current building is on Newton Road and opened in February 1973.

==Sport==
Faversham Town F.C. were formed in 1884 and compete in Division One South of the Isthmian League. They have a 2000-capacity stadium to the south of the town and are the only team besides the England national football team to wear the 3 lions badge. 
Faversham Ladies Hockey Club currently play in Division 6 of the South East Hockey League, finishing second at the end of the 2023/24 season. Faversham Ladies are the current holders of the Mina-Jones trophy, beating neighbours Sittingbourne 2-0 in April 2024. The small ladies team play their home games in nearby Sittingbourne, due to a lack of Astro in the town. 
The King George V playing fields are all that remain of the Mount Field, which in 1876 hosted a first-class match between Kent and Hampshire County Cricket Club.

<doc id="452242" wikidata="Q1818988" url="?curid=452242" title="Walton-on-the-Naze">
<text>Walton-on-the-Naze is a seaside town on the North Sea coast. It is part of the parish of Frinton and Walton, in the Tendring district in Essex, England. The town is located north of Clacton and south of the port of Harwich; Frinton-on-Sea lies to the south of the town. The town has a population of 12,054, according to the 2011 census; in 1931, the parish had a population of 3,071. The town attracts many visitors; The Naze and the pier are the main attractions.

The parish was earlier known as &quot;Eadolfenaesse&quot; and then as &quot;Walton-le-Soken&quot;. The name &quot;Walton&quot; is a common one meaning a &#x27;farmstead or village of the Britons&#x27;, while &#x27;Soken&#x27; denotes the soke (an area of special jurisdiction) that included Thorpe, Kirby and Walton, which were not under the see of London but under the chapter of St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral.

Walton had a HM Coastguard team and was home to the Thames MRCC (Maritime Rescue Coordination Centre), organising rescues from Southwold to Herne Bay. It closed in June 2015, as part of a Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) modernisation programme, transferring its operations to a national centre in Fareham on the south coast. Walton-on-the-Naze railway station is on a branch of the Sunshine Coast Line. Along the coast there are many fossils to be found, some have been found to be up to 50 million years old. Rocks include red crag and London clay.

==The Naze==

&quot;Naze&quot; derives from Old English &quot;næss&quot; &quot;, promontory, headland&quot;. In 1722 Daniel Defoe mentions the town calling it &quot;Walton, under the Nase&quot;.

The Naze is a peninsula north of the town. It is important for migrating birds and has a small nature reserve. The marshes of Hamford Water behind the town are also of ornithological interest, with wintering ducks and Brent geese. Many bird watchers visit at migration times.

The Hanoverian tower (more commonly known as the Naze Tower) at the start of the open area of the Naze was a sea mark to assist ships on this otherwise fairly featureless coast. It is now privately owned and open to visitors.

During the Second World War the Naze was home to a radar station, with some of its aerials mounted on the tower.
Originally, Walton was a farming village situated miles inland. Over the centuries a large extent of land has been lost to the sea due to coastal erosion. The site of the medieval village of Walton now lies nine miles out to sea; its old church finally succumbed in July 1798. Its last service was held on 22 July 1798. This loss of land to the sea is recorded on a Canon&#x27;s stall in St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral with the inscription Consumpta per Mare.

The Naze continues to erode rapidly (at about 2 metres per year), threatening the tower and wildlife. The Naze Protection Society was formed to campaign for erosion controls. The Naze has become popular for school fieldwork to investigate erosion and ways to protect the coast. Protection includes a sea wall, a riprap, groynes and a permeable groyne as well as drainage. Millions of tons of sand have been added to the beach to replenish it and stop the cliff eroding. However, the cliff near Naze Tower is greatly eroded. It is receding fast, and within 50 years Naze Tower may tumble into the sea like the pill boxes that can be seen on the beach.

The cliffs themselves are a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI), the base of which is London Clay (54 million years old) which is overlaid with a 2-million-year-old sandy deposit of Red Crag. This sandy deposit contains many fossils including bivalve and gastropod shells, sharks&#x27; teeth and whale bones. The clay base is considered one of the best sites for pyritised fossils (mainly wood), and for bird bones (which are very rare); in 1998, David Attenborough estimated that over 600 specimens of bird fossil had been found at the site.

==Climate==
Like the rest of the British Isles, Walton-on-the-Naze has an oceanic climate, with slightly more marine influence than nearby inland areas due to its position on the North Sea coast.

==Walton Pier==

The original 150 ft pier was built in 1830, one of the earliest in the country. It was built for landing goods and passengers on steamers to Walton, and was lengthened to 330 ft in 1848. The pier was badly damaged in a storm in January 1871. A second pier opened in 1880, which also did not last. In 1895, the Walton Pier &amp; Hotel Company Ltd opened a replacement pier 500 ft longer than the original. in 1898, The Coast Development Company extended the pier to 2610 ft, becoming the third longest pier in the country. When the new pier opened in 1895, an electric tramway was installed to take passengers from the steamers to the front of the pier. This was in use until 1935 when it was upgraded to a battery-powered carriage. In 1945 fire damaged the pier, and the carriage was replaced by a diesel locomotive train. This was removed during the 1970s. In February 2021, part of the pier collapsed into the sea during Storm Darcy.

In 1937, the pier was bought by Charles Goss, who formed the New Walton Pier Company. At the time, the pier featured a pavilion at the seaward end, an amusement arcade, a tent that served as a theatre, and the Seaspray Lounge. In October 2011, the pier was put up for sale for £2.5 million, and was taken off the market in February 2012. In July 2016, the pier was bought by Russell Bolesworth for an unspecified amount. In 2022, the pier underwent a major revamp with a large arcade area, and was reopened to the public on 16 July 2022.

The Walton and Frinton lifeboat has been moored afloat near the end of the pier since 1900.

==War memorial==
The unusual war memorial commemorates a Halifax crew who all died when they crashed on the Naze. It also has a tribute to Herbert George Columbine, who was awarded the VC and after whom the local leisure centre is named, and a tribute to those lost from HMS Conquest during World War I.

==Lifeboat house==
The old lifeboat house on East Terrace dates from 1884: it now houses the Walton Maritime Museum. It was designed by C H Cooke and is a grade II listed building.

==Notable residents==
* Frank Paton, artist, moved to Walton-on-the-Naze shortly before his death in 1909.
* Ben Raemers, professional skateboarder, lived in Walton-on-the-Naze and grew up there, where he first started skateboarding at the age of 10.

==Governance==
Although the civil parish is now shown under Frinton and Walton, an electoral ward in the name of Walton still exists. The population of this ward at the 2011 Census was 4,372. On 1 April 1934 the parish was abolished to form &quot;Frinton and Walton&quot;.

==Cultural references==

Hamford Water and the town of Walton-on-the-Naze are the location of Arthur Ransome&#x27;s Swallows and Amazons series book, &quot;Secret Water&quot;.

The town is referred to in the episode &#x27;General Hospital&#x27; of the &quot;Blackadder Goes Forth&quot; series. When Lieutenant George is injured and sent to the military infirmary, Captain Blackadder visits him with the ulterior motive of getting his hands on the food sent to George by his family, whom Blackadder refers to as a &quot;collection of inbred mutants&quot;. When George retorts that his family are not inbred, Blackadder replies, &quot;Come on, somewhere outside Saffron Walden there&#x27;s an uncle who&#x27;s seven feet tall with no chin and an Adam&#x27;s apple that makes him look as though he&#x27;s constantly trying to swallow a ballcock!&quot;, to which George replies, &quot;I have not got any uncles like that! Anyway, he lives in Walton-on-the-Naze&quot;.

Walton features as a turning point in the song &quot;Tracy Jacks&quot; from the album &quot;Parklife&quot; by Blur. The song&#x27;s character, Tracy Jacks, takes &quot;the first train to Walton&quot; and stands &quot;on the seafront&quot;. (Three of the band&#x27;s members grew up in Colchester, from where one can take a train to Walton-on-the-Naze.)

The first iteration of &quot;The Stig&quot;, an anonymous, petrol-guzzling racing car driver, created for and featuring in the &#x27;Top Gear&#x27; television series, was killed off in 2003 when he accidentally drove &quot;The &#x27;Top Gear&#x27; Jag&quot; off the deck of a Royal Navy aircraft carrier. In February 2009, it is revealed he survived the accident when a group of men playing frisbee on Walton-on-the-Naze&#x27;s Central beach witnessed &quot;The Stig&quot;, wearing his iconic black overalls and helmet, emerge from the waves, initially mistake their frisbee for a steering wheel, before turning and running down the beach and disappearing under the Pier.

Walton was the inspiration for the fictional Balford-le-Nez in Elizabeth George&#x27;s detective story &quot;Deception on His Mind&quot;.

The seaside and pier of Walton were referred to briefly in an episode of EastEnders on 3 April 2017. During a scene between Martin and Stacey Fowler, Martin says that his sister Michelle and her friend Rachel took him and his other sister Vicki &quot;down to the seaside, you know. Walton-on-the-Naze.&quot; Martin continues to talk about what they did on their trip to Walton. &quot;Paddling, took us up the pier, bit of ice cream, building the sandcastles. The lot.&quot; Martin also references that they booked a caravan during their Walton trip, though the specific caravan site is not mentioned.

The band Bas Jan have a song named Walton On The Naze, which tells of the protagonist&#x27;s experience in the town, on their 2018 album Yes I Jan.

&quot;Port Walton&quot; is also featured in Assassin&#x27;s Creed Valhalla as a military base in Essexe, garrisoned by West Saxon troops. The protagonist Eivor attacks the base to free a number of Rollo&#x27;s warriors, who had earlier been captured in an ambush on their camp by Saxon soldiers.

<doc id="452246" wikidata="Q1003196" url="?curid=452246" title="Sheerness">
<text>Sheerness () is a port town and civil parish beside the mouth of the River Medway on the north-west corner of the Isle of Sheppey in north Kent, England. With a population of 13,249, it is the second largest town on the island after the nearby town of Minster which has a population of 16,738.

Sheerness began as a fort built in the 16th century to protect the River Medway from naval invasion. In 1665 plans were first laid by the Navy Board for Sheerness Dockyard, a facility where warships might be provisioned and repaired. The site was favoured by Samuel Pepys, then Clerk of the Acts of the navy, for shipbuilding over Chatham inland. After the raid on the Medway in 1667, the older fortification was strengthened; in 1669 a Royal Navy dockyard was established in the town, where warships were stocked and repaired until its closure in 1960.

Beginning with the construction of a pier and a promenade in the 19th century, Sheerness acquired the added attractions of a seaside resort. Industry retains its important place in the town and the Port of Sheerness is one of the United Kingdom&#x27;s leading car and fresh produce importers. The town is the site of one of the UK&#x27;s first co-operative societies and also of the world&#x27;s first multi-storey buildings with a rigid metal frame.

== History ==
The first structure in what is now Sheerness was a fort built by order of Henry VIII to prevent enemy ships from entering the River Medway and attacking the naval dockyard at Chatham. In 1666 work began to replace it with a stronger fort. However, before its completion, this second fort was destroyed in 1667 by the Dutch Naval Fleet in their capture of the town, as part of what would be known as the raid on the Medway.
The Secretary to the Admiralty, Samuel Pepys, subsequently ordered the construction of Sheerness Dockyard as an extension to that at Chatham. There was no established settlement in the vicinity of Sheerness, so most of the workers were initially housed in hulks. By 1738, dockyard construction workers had built the first houses in Sheerness, using materials they were allowed to take from the yard. The grey-blue naval paint they used on the exteriors led to their homes becoming known as the Blue Houses. This was eventually corrupted to Blue Town (which is now the name of the north-west area of Sheerness lying just beyond the current dockyard perimeter). The modern town of Sheerness has its origins in Mile Town, which was established later in the 18th century at a mile&#x27;s distance from the dockyard (Blue Town having by then filled the space available).

In 1797, discontented sailors in the Royal Navy mutinied just off the coast of Sheerness.

By 1801 the population of the Minster-in-Sheppey parish, which included both Sheerness and the neighbouring town of Minster, reached 5,561. In 1816, one of the UK&#x27;s first co-operative societies was started in Sheerness, chiefly to serve the dockyard workers and their families. The Sheerness Economical Society began as a co-operative bakery but expanded to produce and sell a range of goods. By the middle of the 20th century, the society had spread across the Isle of Sheppey and had been renamed the Sheerness and District Cooperative Society.

In the early 1820s a fire destroyed the old Blue Houses. New houses and a major redevelopment of the dockyard followed. A high brick wall and a moat were constructed around the yard to serve as a defence measure and remained in place until the end of the 19th century. As the settlement expanded eastwards, away from the dockyard and the Blue Houses, the wider area became known as Sheerness, taking its new name from the brightness or clearness of the water at the mouth of the River Medway. The rebuilt Dockyard contained many groundbreaking new buildings and structures; for example, completed in 1860 and still standing today, the Sheerness Boat Store was the world&#x27;s first multi-storey building with a rigid metal frame.

In 1904 the RN established a torpedo school in Sheerness, with HMS &quot;Actaeon&quot; used as training hulk. The school closed in 1922.

From the completion of the dockyard until 1960 Sheerness was one of the bases of the Nore Command of the Royal Navy, which was responsible for protecting British waters in the North Sea. The command was named after the Nore sandbank in the Thames Estuary, about east of Sheerness.

In 1863, mains water was installed in the town, and the Isle of Sheppey&#x27;s first railway station opened at the dockyard. Towards the end of the 19th century, Sheerness achieved official town status and formed its own civil parish, separate from Minster-in-Sheppey. The 1901 Census recorded the Sheerness parish as having 18,179 residents and 2,999 houses.

The town&#x27;s low rainfall and ample sunshine made it popular as a seaside resort, with tourists arriving by steamboat and train. The Sheppey Light Railway opened in 1901, connecting the new Sheerness East station with the rest of the island. However, by 1950, lack of demand led to the railway&#x27;s closure. The Sheerness and District Tramways, which opened in 1903, only lasted until 1917.

In 1944 the United States cargo ship ran aground and sank off the coast of Sheerness, with large quantities of explosives on board. Due to the inherent danger and projected expense, the ship and its cargo have never been salvaged; if the wreck were to explode, it would be one of the largest non-nuclear explosions of all time. A 2004 report published in &quot;New Scientist&quot; warned that an explosion could occur if sea water penetrated the bombs.

During the Second World War the Shoeburyness Boom, which ran across the Thames Estuary to protect shipping from submarine attack, ran from Sheerness to Shoeburyness in Essex. A similar structure was built along the same alignment in the early 1950s to protect against Soviet submarines. The Sheerness end of the boom was demolished in the 1960s.

In March 1960 the Royal Navy ceased operating the Sheerness dockyard and the Medway Port Authority took over the site for commercial use. The dockyard closure led to thousands of job losses, and most of the nearby houses and shops in the Bluetown area were eventually abandoned and demolished. By the 1961 census, the population of Sheerness had fallen to 13,691. The dockyard closure also led to the decline of the Sheerness and District Cooperative Society, as many of its members were dockyard workers. At the time, the society was the island&#x27;s main retailer, but it has since been reduced to a few shops and been merged with a larger society.

The German writer Uwe Johnson lived in Sheerness for the last decade of his life, from 1974 to 1984, having left East Germany. A monograph by Patrick Wright, &quot;The Sea View Has Me Again&quot;, was published by Repeater Books in 2020.
In 2003, the Beachfields Park project was organised to publicise Beachfields&#x27; heritage and to preserve it for future generations. Students of Cheyne Middle School and Minster College, with assistance from local organisations, researched the funfair, bandstands, Prisoner of the War hut, boating lake and bowling green. As part of the project, students wrote a book, &quot;Tales of Beachfields Park&quot;, which won the Historical Association Young Historian Primary School Award for Local History.

As of 2007, Bluetown is an industrial area, and Sheerness has become the largest port in the UK for motor imports. Prior to the closure of the Dockyard, twenty-five of its historic buildings were listed in recognition of their &quot;architectural distinction and value&quot;; regardless of this, the majority were subsequently demolished (including Admiralty House and the quadrangular Great Store) and others were left to decay. In the early 21st century a concerted effort was made to save the remaining buildings and several have been restored to residential use. In July 2013 Swale Borough Council announced that a deal had been reached to secure restoration of Rennie and Taylor&#x27;s Royal Dockyard Church (which had been gutted by a fire in 2001), with a view to new uses such as displaying the above-mentioned model of the Dockyard.

== Mills ==

Sheerness has had four windmills. They were the Little Mill, a smock mill that was standing before 1813 and burnt down on 7 February 1862; The Hundred Acre Mill, a small tower mill which was last worked in 1872 and demolished in 1878 leaving a base which remains today; The Great Mill, a smock mill, the building of which was started in 1813 and completed in 1816, which was demolished in 1924 leaving the base, upon which a replica mill body was built to serve as flats. On 23 January 2008 a fire started in the mill tower. The fire was declared not to have been a case of arson; Little is known of the fourth windmill, said to have been a vertical axle windmill designed by Stephen Hooper.

== Governance ==
Sheerness is in the parliamentary constituency of Sittingbourne and Sheppey. Since the constituency&#x27;s creation in 1997 until 2010 the Member of Parliament was Derek Wyatt of the Labour Party. At the 2010 general election, Gordon Henderson of the Conservative Party won the seat. Before 1997, Sheppey and Sittingbourne were part of the constituency of Faversham. Sheerness is in the local government district of Swale. The town is covered by the local government wards of Sheerness, which has three of the forty-seven seats on the Swale Borough Council. At the 2015 local elections, two of those seats were held by the Labour Party and one by UKIP.

Swale Borough Council is responsible for running local services, such as recreation, refuse collection and council housing; Kent County Council is responsible for education, social services and trading standards. Both councils are involved in town planning and road maintenance. From 1894 to 1968, Sheerness formed its own local government district, Sheerness Urban District, and lay within the administrative county of Kent. Over much of the past century, the Labour Party has received the most support in Sheerness, mainly due to the town&#x27;s industrial nature. As early as 1919, the town had four Labour councillors; Faversham elected its first only in 1948.

== Geography ==

Sheerness is in the north-west corner of the Isle of Sheppey in North Kent. To the north, sandy beaches run along the coast of the Thames Estuary. To the west, the outlet of the River Medway flows into the Estuary. An area of wetlands known as The Lappel lies between the river and the south-western part of town. Marshland lies to the south and the east. The main rock type of the Isle of Sheppey is London Clay, which covers most of North Kent. Along with most of the Kent coast, the uninhabited coastal areas of the island have been designated Sites of Special Scientific Interest, due to their wildlife and geological features.

The main commercial and leisure areas of the town dominate the north coast, where there is easy access to the pleasure beach. The industrial areas are in the west, beside the wetlands and the River Medway. The Bluetown industrial area and the Port of Sheerness are in the north-western part of the town. The residential districts of Mile Town and Marine Town are in the central and the eastern areas respectively.

== Economy ==

The Port of Sheerness is a significant feature of the Isle of Sheppey&#x27;s economy. Covering more than 1.5 million square metres, it is one of the largest foreign car importers in the UK, and it handles thousands of tonnes of fruits and meat products from all over the world. Inexpensive land and good infrastructure, including a rail network that branches off the main passenger line, have attracted industries to the port area, including producers of pharmaceuticals, steel, sausages and garden gnomes.

The major employers are HBC Engineering Solutions, Sheerness Steel, Regis Furniture and The Bond Group - although HBC has closed and the Steel plant is currently closed but is currently being changed and upgraded ready for reopening. The steel mill was established in 1972, designed to recycle scrap steel into rods and coils. It survived a number of closure threats and changes of ownership; from 2003 it was operated by Thamesteel. Thamesteel went into administration in January 2012, with the loss of 350 jobs. Six months later, the plant was bought back by the former owners Al-Tuwairqi Group. there were plans to reopen the plant as a rolling mill. PeelPort now own the site and are preparing it for reopening as a steel mill. The port has a seafarers&#x27; centre, which was refurbished in May 2015, and is operated by Apostleship of the Sea, a seafarers&#x27; charity.

The seafront is popular with tourists, and in 2007 Sheerness&#x27; recently refurbished town centre had more than 200 shops.

At the 2001 UK census, 35.8% of residents aged 16–74 were employed full-time, 11.6% part-time, 5.8% self-employed and 6.2% unemployed, while 1.5% were students with jobs, 3.4% students without jobs, 11.9% retired, 10.6% looking after home or family, 8.5% permanently sick or disabled and 4.8% economically inactive for other reasons.

== Education ==

Until September 2009, The Isle of Sheppey was the only area in Kent to still have a middle school system. On the island, primary schools taught pupils from ages 4 to 9, middle schools 9–13 and secondary schools 13–18. Minster College in the neighbouring town of Minster was the only secondary school on the island. Sheerness had one middle school, Isle of sheppey Academy, with 800 pupils, although Danley Middle School and St George&#x27;s Middle School were found in Halfway and Minster, respectively. In 2006, the Cheyne Middle School&#x27;s Key Stage 2 performance ranked 322nd among Kent&#x27;s 386 primary and middle schools. The town&#x27;s primary schools are Richmond First School, Rose Street Primary School, St Edward&#x27;s Roman Catholic Primary School and West Minster Primary School, all of which cover ages 4–11. Sheppey College, in Sheerness, is a branch of Canterbury College that provides a range of further education courses.

On 1 September 2009, Cheyne Middle school and Minster College merged to become The Isle of Sheppey Academy (now Oasis Academy Isle of Sheppey). Danley Middle school closed and St George&#x27;s Middle School changed into a primary school with a £3 million fund, and Richmond First School now houses an extra year of students. This change was to bring the island up to date with the rest of the UK with the two-tier system (primary school, and then secondary school). Respectively, The Isle of Sheppey Academy now ranges from students of year 6 to 11, as well as housing the island&#x27;s sixth form students.

<doc id="452248" wikidata="Q5275933" url="?curid=452248" title="Digital Multiplex System">
<text>Digital Multiplex System (DMS) is the name shared among several different telephony product lines from Nortel Networks for wireline and wireless operators. Among them are the DMS-1 (originally named the DMS-256) Rural/Urban digital loop carrier, the DMS-10 telephone switch, the DMS SuperNode family of telephone switches (DMS-100, DMS-200, DMS-250, DMS-300, DMS-500, DMS-GSP, DMS-MSC, DMS-MTX), and the S/DMS optical transmission system.

Exploratory development on the technology began at Northern Telecom&#x27;s Bell Northern Research Labs in Ottawa, Ontario in 1971. The first Class 5 switch, the DMS-10, began service on 21 October 1977 in Fort White, Florida and the first toll switch (Class 4), the DMS-200, entered service in 1979 in Ottawa. The DMS-10 was the first commercially successful Class 5 digital switch in the North American market and had a profound impact on the industry. Of the numerous digital switching products introduced in the North American telephone market in the late 1970s, only the Nortel DMS family is still in production. GENBAND (now Ribbon Communications) acquired Nortel CVAS assets including the DMS line in 2011 and rolled it into its IP-based GENiUS platform. The GENiUS-750nt is the first product to include adaptive nano-tech compression and resynchronization modules from Ericsson, to replace the digital cross-connect (DCS) in place since the earliest DMS releases.

Previously, new technology had entered the telecommunications industry slowly, with the telephone companies amortizing equipment over periods as long as forty years. AT&amp;T was intending to delay the introduction of digital switching until the 1990s. The DMS, with its introduction of digital technology, changed the industry and became one of the antecedents that encouraged the growth of the Internet.

On October 16, 2006, Nortel received a special recognition award from Canada&#x27;s Telecommunications Hall of Fame for its role in pioneering digital communications with the Digital Multiplex System.

The DMS name arose from a designation for a switching matrix design that was developed in the exploratory phase of the project. The Digital Multiplexed Switch was selected as the basic switching design for the project. The product was intended as a successor for Nortel&#x27;s first electronic switch, the SP1, and was to be called the SP2. However the DMS acronym was mellifluous and was eventually (1975) adopted as the designation for the DMS-10 and DMS-100 family of products, with the &quot;S&quot; standing for &quot;system&quot; rather than &quot;switch&quot;. It was then applied to the entire digital switching family as well as the DMS-1 family of Digital Transmission Concentrators.

DMS is favoured by many European cable operators as the switching platform for their voice networks. The DMS-10 is widely used by rural wireline providers. DMS-100 and 200 switches are widely deployed throughout the U.S. and Canada by Regional Bell Operating Companies, Bell Canada and independent telephone companies as well as the US Military. The DMS-250 is the backbone of a number of carriers&#x27; long-distance networks. The DMS-300 is an international gateway switch, and the DMS-500 is commonly deployed by competitive local exchange carriers because it combines DMS-100 and 250 capabilities.

DMS switches run a proprietary multitasking operating system known as SOS.
The user interface, called MAPCI, consists of a series of multi-level menus and is usually accessed from a connected VT100 compatible dumb terminal or terminal emulator. Each level or overlay performs different functions.

A working DMS 10 can be viewed at the Connections Museum in Seattle.

<doc id="452252" wikidata="Q5460" url="?curid=452252" title="Stellenbosch">
<text>Stellenbosch (; ) is a town in the Western Cape province of South Africa, situated about east of Cape Town, along the banks of the Eerste River at the foot of the Stellenbosch Mountain. The town became known as the City of Oaks or &quot;Eikestad&quot; in Afrikaans and Dutch due to the large number of oak trees that were planted by its founder, Simon van der Stel, to grace the streets and homesteads.

Stellenbosch is a popular tourist destination due to its history as the second oldest town in South Africa (dating back to 1679), its many historic buildings that are typical of Cape Dutch architecture, its location in the centre of many famous wine farms, as well as its variety of cafes, restaurants, boutiques and art galleries. The town is home to Stellenbosch University, one of South Africa&#x27;s oldest universities, whose campus and buildings occupies large swathes of the town centre. Stellenbosch also has a modern science park, Technopark, situated on the southern side of the town, which serves as a base for many large companies and startups, including Capitec Bank (South Africa&#x27;s second largest retail bank).

Stellenbosch has its own municipality (incorporating the neighbouring towns of Pniel and Franschhoek), adjoining the metropolitan area of the City of Cape Town.

== History ==
=== Pre-history ===
In 1899 Louis Péringuey discovered Paleolithic stone tools of the Acheulean type at a site named Bosman&#x27;s Crossing near the Adam Tas Bridge at the western entrance to Stellenbosch. This indicates that human habitation of the area dates as far back as 1 million years. By 10,000 to 20,000 years ago the population, assumed to have been ancestors of the San people, were established in the area.

=== Founding and early history ===
The town was founded in 1679 by the Governor of the Cape Colony, Simon van der Stel, who named it after himself – Stellenbosch means &quot;(van der) Stel&#x27;s Bush&quot;. It is situated on the banks of the Eerste River (&quot;First River&quot;), so named as it was the first new river he reached and followed when he went on an expedition over the Cape Flats to explore the territory towards what is now known as Stellenbosch. The town grew so quickly that it became an independent local authority in 1682 and the seat of a magistrate with jurisdiction over in 1685.

The Dutch were skilled in hydraulic engineering and they devised a system of furrows to direct water from the Eerste River in the vicinity of Thibault Street through the town along van Riebeeck Street to Mill Street where a mill was erected. Early visitors commented on the oak trees and gardens.

During 1690 some Huguenot refugees settled in Stellenbosch, grapes were planted in the fertile valleys around Stellenbosch and soon it became the centre of the South African wine industry.

In 1710 a fire destroyed most of the town, including the first church, all the Company property and twelve houses. Only two or three houses were left standing. When the church was rebuilt in 1723 it was located on what was then the outskirts of the town, to prevent a similar incident from destroying it again. This church has been enlarged a number of times since 1723 and is currently known as the &quot;Moederkerk&quot; (Mother Church).

=== Since the 1800s ===
The first school had been opened in 1683, but education in the town began in earnest in 1859 with the opening of a seminary for the Dutch Reformed Church. Rhenish Girls&#x27; High School, established in 1860, is the oldest school for girls in South Africa. A gymnasium, known as &quot;het Stellenbossche Gymnasium&quot;, was established in 1866. In 1874 some higher classes became Victoria College and then in 1918 University of Stellenbosch.

The first men&#x27;s hostel to be established in Stellenbosch was Wilgenhof, in 1903. In 1905 the first women&#x27;s hostel to be established in Stellenbosch was Harmonie . Harmonie and Wilgenhof were part of the Victoria College. In 1909 an old boy of the school, Paul Roos, captain of the first national rugby team to be called the Springboks, was invited to become the sixth rector of the school. He remained rector until 1940. On his retirement, the school&#x27;s name was changed to Paul Roos Gymnasium.

In the early days of the Second Boer War (1899–1902) Stellenbosch was one of the British military bases, and was used as a &quot;remount&quot; camp; and in consequence of officers who had not distinguished themselves at the front being sent back to it, the expression &quot;to be Stellenbosched&quot; came into use; so much so, that in similar cases officers were spoken of as &quot;Stellenbosched&quot; even if they were sent to some other place.

== Population ==
At the time of the 2011 census, the population of the urban area of Stellenbosch was 77,476, living in 23,730 households, in an area of . Roughly 63.8% of the residents spoke Afrikaans as their home language, 19.6% spoke isiXhosa, and 6.8% spoke English. 28.1% of the population identified themselves as Black African, 52.2% as Coloured (racially mixed), and 18.5% as White.

The Stellenbosch Municipality extends beyond the town of Stellenbosch itself to include rural areas, villages, and the town of Franschhoek. At the time of the 2011 census, the municipal population was 155,728, while by 2016 it was estimated to be 173,197. In 2017, the municipality estimated that the population in 2018 would increase to 176,523.

The 1936 census recorded a total population of 8,782 residents with 3,558 of them recorded as Coloured and 4,995 recorded as White.

==Climate and geography==

Stellenbosch is east of Cape Town via National Route N1. Stellenbosch is in a hilly region of the Cape Winelands, and is sheltered in a valley at an average elevation of , flanked on the west by Papegaaiberg (), which is actually a hill. To the south is Stellenbosch Mountain; to the east and southeast are the Jonkershoek, Drakenstein, and Simonsberg mountains.

==Viticulture and winemaking==

The Stellenbosch, Paarl and Franschhoek valleys form the Cape Winelands, the larger of the two main wine growing regions in South Africa. The South African wine industry produces about 1,000,000,000 litres of wine annually. Stellenbosch is the primary location for viticulture and viticulture research. Professor Perold was the first Professor of Viticulture at Stellenbosch University. The Stellenbosch Wine Route established in 1971 by Frans Malan from Simonsig, Spatz Sperling from Delheim, Neil Joubert from Spier and David van Velden from Overgaauw, known as Stellenbosch American Express® Wine Routes since 2002, is a world-renowned and popular tourist destination. This route provides visitors the opportunity to experience a wide range of cultivars and includes farms such as Warwick and JC Le Roux.

The region has a Mediterranean climate with hot dry summers and cool wet winters. Stellenbosch lies at the foot of the Cape Fold mountain range, which provides soil favourable to viticulture. Grapes grown in this area are mainly used for wine production, as opposed to table grapes. The region possesses a wide range of soils in the area, from light, sandy soils to decomposed granite. Stellenbosch Cabernet Sauvignon is beginning to get a good reputation as a fine wine.

== Stellenbosch University ==



Stellenbosch University is one of South Africa&#x27;s leading universities. This institution has a history dating back to 1863 and has 10 faculties, including Engineering, Commerce, Science and Arts. The Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering is the only university department in the southern hemisphere which has successfully built a communications satellite Sunsat which was launched in 2000 and orbited the Earth for three years.

The University currently has about 29,000 students. White students in 2014, namely 18,636, constitute 63.4% of all students enrolled. Although the official language of the university is Afrikaans, most post-graduate courses are presented in English. The university is in the process of introducing more English centered undergraduate courses following mass protest by the student body. The university council with the concurrence of the senate approved a new language policy on 22 June 2016 for implementation from 1 January 2017. Since the campuses are situated in the Western Cape, the university has committed to introducing multilingualism by using the province’s three official languages, namely Afrikaans, English and isiXhosa.

Stellenbosch has two railway stations including its main railway station, Stellenbosch Railway Station to the east of the CBD along the R310 Adam Tas Road and Du Toit Railway Station to the north of the CBD in Plankenbrug.

=== Roads ===
Stellenbosch is not directly linked to any major freeway or highway, however it is connected to the N1 (to Cape Town and Paarl) via the R44 and R304, the N2 (to Cape Town and George) via the R44 and R310 and the R300 (to Bellville and Mitchells Plain) via the M12.

The R44 (Adam Tas Street; Strand Road) connects Stellenbosch with Klapmuts and Wellington to the north and Somerset West to the south.

==Coats of arms==
The municipality currently uses a badge consisting of a fleur de lis and a cross issuing from a stylised bunch of grapes. In the past, the various local authorities used coats of arms.

* Drostdy – The drostdy (1685–1827) was the local authority for the whole Stellenbosch district, including the city. In 1804, when the Cape Colony was ruled by the Batavian Republic, the government assigned an armorial seal to the drostdy. It depicted the shield of arms of Simon van der Stel superimposed on an anchor representing Hope, on a golden background. In 1814, the British occupation authorities ordered the drostdyen to use the royal coat of arms instead. Van der Stel&#x27;s arms were quartered: 1 two red towers on a golden background; 2 a peacock on a red background; 3 three silver discs or balls stacked 1 over 2 on a red background; 4 a red tower on a golden background. In the centre was a smaller blue shield displaying six silver crescents (or, possibly, ribs) 2, 2, and 2.
* Municipality (1) – The Stellenbosch municipality was formed in 1840, to administer the city, but not the rest of the district. Although it was not the legal successor to the drostdy, it adopted the old drostdy seal of arms. A few changes were made to the arms over the years: quarters 2 and 3 were changed from red to blue; the peacock was turned to a profile position; the three silver discs or balls were changed to golden rings; the central shield was changed from blue to black. Whether any of these changes was intentional, or whether they were the result of artistic errors, is unclear.
* Municipality (2) – The municipal council had a new coat of arms designed by Michael Dawes in 1951. After some improvements, the College of Arms granted them on 26 June 1952. They were registered at the Bureau of Heraldry on 31 August 1979. The new design was a golden shield displaying the three towers from the Van der Stel arms, and a red fess displaying the peacock between golden rings. The crest was an anchor entwined with oak leaves and acorns. The motto &quot;Fortis et superbus&quot; (&quot;Strong and proud&quot;) was chosen.
* Divisional council (1) – The divisional council, established in 1855, administered the rural areas outside the city. At some point, it adopted the plain Van der Stel arms, i.e. a golden shield displaying three red towers.
* Divisional council (2) – The divisional council had its arms re-designed by Cornelis Pama in 1970, and registered them at the Bureau of Heraldry on 30 October 1970. The shield was divided down the centre into gold and red, and the three towers were counterchanged. A red tower was added as a crest.
* &quot;Kaya Mandi&quot; – The local authority for the Black township of Kaya Mandi registered arms at the Bureau on 27 November 1987.

<text>Percival Proctor Baxter (November 22, 1876 – June 12, 1969) was an American politician and philanthropist from Maine. The son of canning magnate and Portland, Maine mayor James Phinney Baxter, he served as the 53rd governor of Maine from 1921 to 1925. A noted philanthropist, he donated several pieces of land to the public domain including Baxter Woods (Portland), Mackworth Island State Park (Falmouth), and Baxter State Park (Piscataquis County).

==Early life==

Baxter was born into a wealthy family in Portland where his father James Phinney Baxter served six terms as mayor and had made his fortune in the canning industry. He graduated from Portland High School in 1894, and graduated from Bowdoin College with honors in 1898. While at Bowdoin, Baxter founded the school&#x27;s literary magazine, &quot;The Quill&quot;. He later earned a law degree from Harvard University in 1901, though he never opened a legal practice. He went into the family real estate business in Portland. He had seven siblings. However, he was to inherit the bulk of the family fortune.

When Baxter was governor he donated to the people of Maine a large parcel of forest land which became Baxter State Park. He said &quot;Man is born to die. His works are short-lived. Buildings crumble, monuments decay, and wealth vanishes, but Katahdin in all its glory forever shall remain the mountain of the people of Maine.&quot;

Baxter was also a fierce opponent of the Ku Klux Klan of Maine, which supported the career of his political nemesis and successor Ralph Owen Brewster.

==Elective history==
*Maine State Senate – 1909–1910
*Maine House of Representatives – 1916–1919
*Maine State Senate – 1919–1921 (President in Pro-Tempe in 1921)
*Governor of Maine – 1921–1924 (succeeded upon death of Governor Frederic Hale Parkhurst and then elected to one term
*Unsuccessful run for U.S. Senate – 1926

==Baxter State Park==
Baxter&#x27;s history is intertwined with Baxter State Park, which bears his name, and with Mount Katahdin, Maine&#x27;s highest point (the highest knob on Katahdin is called Baxter Peak).

In 1903 Baxter went on a fishing trip to the area around Katahdin for the first time. In 1895 the Maine Proprietors Association had urged the state to turn that area of the Maine woods into a state park to attract tourists. In 1911 a bill was introduced to turn the region into a U.S. National Park but none of the plans came to fruition.
In 1916 Baxter began his campaign to make the area a state park. In 1920 he led a group of politicians up Pamola Peak, traversing the Knife Edge to the summit (now known as Baxter Peak).

In a 1921 speech, Baxter said:Maine is famous for its twenty-five hundred miles of seacoast, with its countless islands; for its myriad lakes and ponds; and for its forests and rivers. But Mount Katahdin Park will be the state&#x27;s crowning glory, a worthy memorial to commemorate the end of the first and the beginning of the second century of Maine&#x27;s statehood. This park will prove a blessing to those who follow us, and they will see that we built for them more wisely than our forefathers did for us.

Most of the land around Katahdin was then owned by the Great Northern Paper Company. Following the Crash of 1929, the company agreed to sell around the mountain for $25,000 in 1930 to Baxter personally. Baxter in turn deeded the land to the state with the proviso that it: &quot;shall forever be used for public park and recreational purposes, shall be forever left in the natural wild state, shall forever be kept as a sanctuary for wild beasts and birds, that no road or ways for motor vehicles shall hereafter ever be constructed thereon or therein.&quot;

The park was named in his honor in 1931.

Baxter was to continue to attempt to add property to the park—often running into opposition from those who did not want to sell or making temporary trade offs to allow continued timber operations before the land acquisition was completed. Baxter, saying he did not trust the federal government, resisted efforts to turn the park into a national park. He placed various restrictive covenants on the park so that today it is not actually part of the Department of Conservation, the body that administers the state&#x27;s other parks. Rather it is administered by the Baxter State Park Authority.

In 1962 Baxter, at the age of 87, donated his 28th deed. The park now comprises . Baxter, who died a bachelor, left $7 million to maintain the park.

==Anti-Klan Republican==
Baxter&#x27;s term as Governor coincided with the rise of the Ku Klux Klan as a force in Maine and national politics. Although Baxter was an ardent foe of the Klan, it found a foothold in the Maine Republican Party through the influence of state senators Ralph O. Brewster, Mark Alton Barwise, Hodgdon Buzzell, and others, who sponsored bills in the early 1920s which would have cut aid to parochial schools, thus creating a &#x27;wedge issue&#x27; between Maine&#x27;s Protestant and Catholic communities. Brewster succeeded Baxter as governor in 1925. In 1928, when Brewster ran for the U.S. Senate, Baxter publicly denounced him as a member of the Klan, helping to ensure the victory of incumbent U.S. Senator Frederick Hale.

==Other activities==

In 1896, Baxter joined a number of his Bowdoin classmates and travelled to Bath, Maine, where the Democratic candidate for president, William Jennings Bryan, was scheduled to speak. Baxter and his crew were so raucous that they were arrested. Although Baxter&#x27;s confederates pleaded guilty, the future Governor fought the charges with the help of his father, Portland Mayor James Phinney Baxter, and managed to have his record expunged.

In 1953 Baxter donated Mackworth Island to the state. He also deeded his summer home in Falmouth, Maine to create the Governor Baxter School for the Deaf (founded in 1957 from what was the Maine School for the Deaf), which still operates today.

Baxter was known for his passionate devotion to animals, and for his commitment to the humane treatment of animals. When his dog, Garry, died while Baxter was governor, he ordered the flag at the State House lowered to half staff, which angered some veterans&#x27; groups. Baxter belonged to several humane societies across the country, one of which, the New England Anti-Vivisection Society, called him &quot;America&#x27;s greatest humane governor.&quot;

Following the death of Theodore F. Green of Rhode Island on May 19, 1966, Baxter became the oldest living former US governor.

Baxter died in Portland, and his ashes were scattered in the park.

<text>Dragon Quest Monsters is a spin-off series of the &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; games. Primarily developed by Tose and published by Square Enix (formerly Enix), it sets the player in a medieval/fantasy world filled with magic, monsters and knights. Unlike the original &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; games, the player&#x27;s character does not do any of the fighting in battles; instead the player has to rely on capturing, breeding and raising monsters to do the fighting for them. The concept originated from &quot;Dragon Quest V&quot; (1992). The character and monster designs are by &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; creator, Akira Toriyama. The series spans several handheld gaming systems, and each game has received positive reviews from critics. The series&#x27; gameplay has been compared to Pokémon.

For the first two US releases, the titles used &quot;Warrior&quot; instead of the original Japanese &quot;Quest&quot;. This was due to &quot;Dragon Quest&quot;″s North American name being changed due to a trademark conflict with the role-playing game &quot;DragonQuest&quot;, which was published by Simulation Publications in the 1980s until the company&#x27;s bankruptcy in 1982 and purchase by TSR, Inc., which then published it as an alternate line to &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; until 1987. In 2003, Square Enix registered the &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; trademark in the US, making the &quot;Dragon Warrior&quot; name obsolete.

== Games ==

&quot;Dragon Warrior Monsters&quot;, the first game in the series, was released in 1998 in Japan and in North America and the PAL region the next year for the Game Boy Color. The Japanese version was called &quot;Dragon Quest Monsters&quot;. It was released with Game Boy Color compatibility despite coming to market before the console itself, but the cartridge was backward-compatible with the original Game Boy as well. Its sequel, &quot;Dragon Warrior Monsters 2&quot; was also a cross-system Game Boy Color title. It released in Japan and North America in 2001. There are two versions of the game: &quot;Cobi&#x27;s Journey&quot; and &quot;Tara&#x27;s Adventure&quot;, titled after the playable character of each version. In Japan, these were named &quot;Ruka’s Journey&quot; and &quot;Iru&#x27;s Adventure&quot;, respectively. Each version features slight differences, such as monster appearances. Both games were developed by TOSE and published by Enix. &quot;Dragon Quest Monsters 1+2&quot;, a remake of these two games with updated graphics and an interface, was released in 2002 in Japan, for the PlayStation. The game is compatible with the i-Mode adapter for the PlayStation, allowing players to upload monsters to the i-Mode cellular phone version, &quot;Dragon Quest Monsters i&quot;. The two games were remade on the Japanese Nintendo 3DS on 2012 and 2014, respectively. The first remade game was ported to smartphones in 2018 for Japanese market.

&quot;Dragon Quest Monsters: Caravan Heart&quot; is the third game in the series, released in Japan in 2003 for the Game Boy Advance. Developed by TOSE, the game was the last &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; game Enix published before merging with Square. It features Keifer, a prince from &quot;Dragon Warrior VII&quot;.

&quot;Dragon Quest Monsters: Joker&quot;, for the Nintendo DS, was released in Japan in 2006 and was the first in the series to feature 3D graphics. It was brought to North America the next year, and in 2008, was released in the PAL region, making it the second game in the series to do so. Initially revealed through the publication &quot;Shonen Jump&quot;, the game is set around a tournament referred to as the Joker GP. It also features Wi-Fi multiplayer play through the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection service and full 3D movement and battles. Unlike the other games in the series, this game has no random battles. &quot;Dragon Quest Monsters: Joker 2&quot; was released in Japan on April 28, 2010, and in the United States on September 19, 2011, as revealed at E3 2011. &quot;Dragon Quest Monsters: Joker 3&quot; was only released in Japan on March 24, 2016.

Two cell phone games, &quot;Dragon Quest Monsters: Wanted!&quot; and &quot;Dragon Quest Monsters: Super Light&quot; were released in Japan.

On December 1, 2023, &quot;The Dark Prince&quot; was released for the Nintendo Switch. Tose returned to develop the game.

==Gameplay==
Although each of the games have distinct differences, they all have similar gameplay to the main &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; series. Players control the main character, but, unlike in &quot;Dragon Quest&quot;, the main character does not fight. Caught or bred monsters participate in battles instead of humans, although this changes slightly in &quot;Caravan Heart&quot;. Battles for the first three games are fought in first-person and are turn-based. Monsters are able to gain experience points just like humans in the main series would and can learn spells and skills straight from the &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; games.

===Battle system===

Up until &quot;Joker&quot;, battles were fought against randomly encountered monsters in a first-person view. &quot;Joker&quot; changed this by allowing players to see enemies on the field as well as making battles three-dimensional. The player controls up to three monsters at once, and their HP and MP are displayed onscreen. The player can then choose from several options on what to do. As of &quot;Joker 2&quot;, there are certain monsters who do take up two or three spaces on party, to fit their size.
As of &quot;Terry&#x27;s Wonderland 3D&quot; for Nintendo 3DS, there are four spaces in the party instead of three, allowing the player to control more monsters at a time.

Typically, the player does not directly control the monsters and instead gives them suggestions. Charge tells monsters to use their most direct and powerful attacks. Mixed suggests to monsters to use support abilities, such as shields, stat enhancements, or summons and Cautious tells monsters to use defensive abilities, such as healing and reviving spells and abilities that remove harmful stat effects. During battle, the player can select Plan, which allows the player to change any of the commands. Command gives the player direct control of the party and cannot be used in arena battles. Fight simply makes monsters follow their set commands. The player can also use items during battle, many which are from the &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; games. The party can also attempt to flee random battles.

====Personalities====
A message may appear that says &quot;will attempt&quot; for some of the commands; this is because each monster is given a certain personality depending on the player&#x27;s actions used in combat. Those actions are Charge, Mixed and Cautious, which when used can raise/lower one of three hidden stats, Bravery, Prudence and Caring.

Basically this means a monster high in one of the three stats will be better at using an attack of that type and more likely to obey, for example a monster with the Personality type Reckless (which is high in Bravery but low in Prudence and Caring) will be more likely to use a Charge attack, whereas a monster with the Personality type Careful (a type high in Caring but low in Bravery and Prudence) will be more likely to use a Cautious attack. Personalities change quicker at lower levels than at higher levels, and monsters with a high wildness stat have harder-to-change personalities. A monster can have one of 27 personalities.

====Wildness====
Another reason monsters might not obey commands is their wildness (WLD in the game). A monster with a high wildness is less likely to obey commands. Newly caught monsters and monsters kept in the farm for long periods of time will have high wildness. To lower a monster&#x27;s wildness, the player needs to keep it in the party for a while or feed it meat items.

===Obtaining monsters===

As with other role-playing video games, when the player&#x27;s party defeats the opposing monsters and the battle ends, the party is awarded a certain amount of experience points (EXP) which are used to level up monsters. At the end of the battle, there exists a small chance the opposing monster may join the party. The chance of a monster joining the party is increased by the use of meat items which lowers a monster&#x27;s wildness. The more the player uses, the lower the monster&#x27;s wildness will be and the more likely it is to join. Certain types of meat lower a monster&#x27;s wildness more, thus increasing the chance of catching them. This is true in the first three games.

In &quot;Dragon Quest Monsters: Joker&quot;, the player can actively scout for monsters during battle. Unlike previous games in the series, this is a battle command, and not the result of using items in battle. The player can make any number of scouting attempts during a battle, until the monster decides to join, or takes offense. Success depends on the relative strengths of the monsters making the attempt versus the relative defense of the monster that is being scouted.

===Breeding===
Breeding monsters has been a large part of the series and is often cited as one of the series&#x27; highlights, in part due to being able to create monsters that cannot otherwise be obtained. In the first two games, the player was able to breed two monsters together and create a different monster, usually a combination of its two parents. The parent monsters would disappear after breeding. &quot;Caravan Heart&quot; changed the system, instead using Monster Hearts to create new monsters. &quot;Joker&quot; returned to the first system, although the name was changed to Synthesizing. Instead of breeding a male with a female monster, the player must fuse a &quot;Plus&quot; monster with an &quot;Minus&quot; monster. However, in the original Japanese version of the game, it remains as normal breeding of genders.

==Reception==
Each of the games in the &quot;Dragon Quest Monsters&quot; series has been met with praise by critics. Each game has sold well in Japan. US releases for the first two games brought on comparisons to the Pokémon franchise, another monster-collecting RPG. However, with the release of &quot;Joker&quot; for the Nintendo DS game, these comparisons were not as much of a focus in reviews, but still existed. 1UP.com, when reviewing &quot;Joker&quot;, noted that &quot;the Monsters series has always felt like it belongs in the Dragon Quest universe first and foremost; it&#x27;s more than a bunch of bastardized Pokéclones. The latest installment of the subseries – Joker – is a perfect example.&quot;

Each of the games in the series has sold well, particularly in Japan, where the &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; series has gained immense popularity. In Japan, &quot;Dragon Warrior Monsters&quot; sold 2.35 million copies. The North American version sold 60,000 copies by April 2000.&quot;Dragon Warrior Monsters 2&quot; has sold 1,592,728 copies in Japan. &quot;Dragon Quest Monsters 1+2&quot; was the 38th best-selling game of 2002 with 292,275 copies. &quot;Caravan Heart&quot; was a top-seller during the time of its release, with over 538,000 units sold within three months of its release and 593,000 units sold to date. &quot;Dragon Quest Monsters: Joker&quot; sold 593,994 units in the first four days after release in Japan. To date, it has sold over 1.9 million units worldwide.

<text>The Atlantic Ocean Road or the Atlantic Road () is an long section of County Road 64 that runs through an archipelago in Hustadvika and Averøy municipalities in Møre og Romsdal county, Norway. It passes by Hustadvika, an unsheltered part of the Norwegian Sea, connecting the island of Averøy with the mainland and Romsdalshalvøya peninsula. It runs between the villages of Kårvåg in Averøy and Vevang in Hustadvika. It is built on several small islands and skerries, which are connected by several causeways, viaducts and eight bridges—the most prominent being Storseisundet Bridge.

The route was originally proposed as a railway line in the early 20th century, but this was abandoned. Serious planning of the road started in the 1970s, and construction started on August 1, 1983. During construction the area was hit by 12 European windstorms. The road was opened on 7 July 1989, having cost 122 million Norwegian krone (NOK), of which 25 percent was financed with tolls and the rest from public grants. Collection of tolls was scheduled to run for 15 years, but by June 1999 the road was paid off and the toll removed. The road is preserved as a cultural heritage site and is classified as a National Tourist Route. It is a popular site to film automotive commercials, has been declared the world&#x27;s best road trip, and been awarded the title as &quot;Norwegian Construction of the Century&quot;. In 2009, the Atlantic Ocean Tunnel opened from Averøy to Kristiansund; together they form a second fixed link between Kristiansund and Molde.

==Route description==
The road is a long section of County Road 64 that connects the island and municipality of Averøy with the mainland at Eide. The road runs across an archipelago of partially inhabited islands and skerries. To the north lies Hustadvika, an unsheltered section of the Norwegian Sea, to the south Lauvøyfjorden. The road has a width of and a maximum gradient of eight percent. It consists of eight bridges and four resting places and viewpoints. Several tourist sites, including dining, fishing and scuba diving resorts, have been established on the islands. Along with the section from Vevang to Bud, the road has been designated one of 18 National Tourist Routes.

The road begins at Utheim on Averøy, close to the village of Kårvåg. It runs onto the island of Kuholmen and then across the long Little Lauvøysund Bridge onto the island of Lille Lauvøy. It continues across the long Store Lauvholmen Bridge onto Store Lauvøy. Next it crosses the equally long Geitøysund Bridge to Geitøya, which features a viewpoint and parking. It then runs across Eldhusøya and Lyngholmen, before reaching Ildhusøya, where there are a resting place, parking and a viewpoint. Next is Storseisundet Bridge, a cantilever bridge long. The municipal boundary between Eide and Averøy runs under the bridge. It then runs across Flatskjæret, where there is a viewpoint, before crossing onto Hulvågen via the three Hulvågen Bridges, which combined are long. From there the road runs through Skarvøy and Strømsholmen, both with a resting place. The route reaches the mainland over the long Vevangstraumen Bridge.

==History==

The first proposals to use the route were made in the early 20th century. Planning of the Rauma Line to connect the national railway network to Møre og Romsdal was under way, and several proposals were made to extend it to the coastal towns. In 1921, Møre og Romsdal County Council chose the outer route, which would have followed a path close to that of the road. The Rauma Line was not built beyond Åndalsnes, and in 1935 the Parliament of Norway decided to connect the coastal towns in Møre og Romsdal to Åndalsnes by road instead of rail.

Although the plans were officially shelved, locals continued to work with the idea of a road connecting Averøy with the mainland. The toll company Atlanterhavsveien AS was established in 1970. Arne Rettedal, who was Minister of Local Government and Regional Development in the early 1980s, proposed that job creation funds could be allocated to road projects. The proposal was approved in 1983, after it had been supported by the municipalities of Averøy, Eide and Fræna. Construction started as a municipal road project on 1 August 1983, but progressed slowly. From 1 July 1986, the Norwegian Public Roads Administration took over the project, speeding up construction and allowing it to open on 7 July 1989. During construction, the area was hit by 12 hurricanes. The opening of the road allowed the Tøvik–Ørjavik Ferry to be terminated.
Construction cost NOK 122 million and was financed 25 percent by debt to be recollected through tolls, 25 percent by job creation funds and 50 percent by ordinary state road grants. There was significant local opposition against toll financing, as few people believed it would be possible to pay off the road in the stipulated 15 years. However, by June 1999 the road was paid off and tolls removed. The accelerated amortization was caused both by greater than predicted local traffic and by large amounts of tourist traffic.

In 2009, the road was Norway&#x27;s ninth-most-visited natural tourist attraction, with 258,654 visitors from May through August. The route won the title &quot;Norwegian Construction of the Century&quot;, awarded by the Norwegian construction industry in 2005. In 2006, &quot;The Guardian&quot; declared it the world&#x27;s best road trip. The road has become a popular place for the automotive industry to film advertisements; more than ten manufacturers have made television commercials along the route, often depicting the harsh weather. The Norwegian Directorate for Cultural Heritage preserved the road as a cultural heritage in December 2009. The Atlantic Ocean Tunnel between Averøy and Kristiansund opened on 19 December 2009. In combination with the road it provides a fixed link between Kristiansund and Molde. This is the second fixed link between the two towns, after the 1992 opening of the Kristiansund and Frei Fixed Link.

<text>In art, craft, and engineering, masking is the use of materials to protect areas from change, or to focus change on other areas. This can describe either the techniques and materials used to control the development of a work of art by &quot;protecting&quot; a desired area from change; or a phenomenon that (either intentionally or unintentionally) causes a sensation to be &quot;concealed&quot; from conscious attention.

The term is derived from the word &quot;mask&quot;, in the sense that it hides the face from view.

Masking materials supplement a painter&#x27;s dexterity and choice of applicator to control where paint is laid. Examples include the use of a stencil or masking tape to protect areas which are not to be painted.

===Solid masks===
Most solid masks require an adhesive to hold the mask in place while work is performed. Some, such as masking tape and frisket, come with adhesive pre-applied. Solid masks are readily available in bulk, and are used in large painting jobs.

===Liquid masks===
Liquid masks are preferred where precision is needed; they prevent paint from seeping underneath, resulting in clean edges. Care must be taken to remove them without damaging the work underneath.

*Latex or other polymers
*Molten wax
*Gesso, typically a substrate for painting, but can also be applied to achieve masking effects

==In photography==
Masks used for photography are used to enhance the quality of an image.

Representations of a scene—whether film, video display, or printed—do not have the dynamic contrast range available to the human eye looking directly at the same scene. Adjusting the contrast in an image helps restore some of the perceived qualities of the original scene. These adjustments are typically performed on &quot;blown-out&quot; highlights, and &quot;crushed&quot; or &quot;muddy&quot; shadow areas, where clipping has occurred; or on desaturated colors. Photographic masks are peculiar in that they are produced from the image they will alter, an exercise in recursion.

Masks used to produce other effects are similar to those used in painting.

===Controlling exposure===

====Film====

The basic methods of controlling exposure are &quot;dodging&quot; and &quot;burning&quot;, which respectively lighten (reduce exposure) and darken (increase exposure) areas of an image. The tools a film photographer uses range from shaped pieces of black material (such as studio foil, foam, and paper) to the photographer&#x27;s hands.

To create a photographic mask, a sheet of negative film is contact-exposed to the original film negative or slide positive in a particular way. Both films are then combined to produce a processed positive. The process is similar when applied using digital techniques: the inverse of the working image is reduced to an image mask; filters or other adjustments are then applied, using the mask to selectively block portions of the image.

====Digital====
Image editors offer at the very least a &quot;Select All&quot; command and a rectangular &quot;marquee&quot; selection tool. (The word &quot;marquee&quot; describes the &quot;crawling ants&quot; border used to highlight the active region.) Once a selection is created, further changes to the image will be confined to that area. To continue editing the rest of the image, the selection is either &quot;deselected&quot; or the entire image is selected. Advanced suites offer more ways to select portions of an image, as well as ways to combine these selections through.

Selection masks can be switched between an editable greyscale image and a mask. They allow the user to create a mask using the suite&#x27;s painting tools.

===Contrast masking===

When the contrast range of an image needs to be adjusted, a contrast mask is a simple solution. The processed image resembles what would be achieved when exposing through a neutral density filter, but the effects are focused highly upon the extreme regions of the image. The blocking areas of the mask coincide with the highlights of the image, and the permissive areas with the shadows, resulting in more detail appearing in each.

====Film====
The mask is often made from high-quality black-and-white film, such as Kodak Technical Pan, which allows for a degree of softening on the mask. Its processing time is reduced so as to not completely oppose the original negative. Both negatives are combined and registered, and collectively exposed with additional time to compensate for the presence of the mask.

====Digital====
Contrast masking is made simpler with digital editing. A grayscale version of the image is produced, either by desaturation or by calculating selected ratios of the image&#x27;s color channels, inverted, and blurred. The mask and original image are blended together to produce the final processed image. Some image editors allow for refinement of the effect by changing the strength of the blend.

Contrast masking can be considered to be the opposite of gamma correction, which adjusts the midtones of an image. Effects similar to contrast masking can be achieved by adjusting the &quot;response curves&quot; of an image.

===Unsharp masking===

A derivative of contrast masking is unsharp masking, an unusual term for a process intended to &quot;increase&quot; the &quot;apparent&quot; sharpness (acutance) of an image. Unsharp masking uses a blurred form of the image to increase contrast along regions of moderate contrast difference. Around edges, the blur region causes highlights to overexpose and shadows to underexpose. Taken to an extreme, the edges become overly visible and detract from the quality of the image—this is referred to as &quot;halation&quot;.

Unsharp masking does not increase the &quot;actual&quot; sharpness, as it cannot recover details lost to blurring.

====Film====
Unsharp masking allows the photographer to sharpen areas that have become blurred in the original negative, due to long shutter speed/exposure time, or from using a wide aperture/&quot;fast&quot; lens.

When creating the unsharp mask, extra space or diffusing material is added between the image and the mask to produce the necessary blur.

====Digital====
Unsharp masking has become automated in digital editing, with higher-end suites offering the process as a &quot;tool&quot; or &quot;filter&quot; in their standard sharpening kits—the actual creation of a mask is bypassed in favor of calculations that represent the mask&#x27;s effect. The process depends on three factors: the &quot;radius&quot; of the blur, the &quot;strength&quot; of the effect, and the &quot;threshold&quot; degree of contrast above which the effect will be applied. (Adjusting the threshold allows the editor to apply the effect selectively upon moderately defined edges and ignore image noise.)

Unsharp masking is computationally more complex than other sharpening algorithms, but results in a higher-quality remedy. Deconvolution allows for truer sharpening, but is much more complex than unsharp masking.

<doc id="452274" wikidata="Q6030060" url="?curid=452274" title="Infinity Watch">
<text>The Infinity Watch is the name of three fictional organizations appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The first version of Infinity Watch was gathered in &quot;Warlock and the Infinity Watch&quot; #1, and starred in that series until it ended with issue #42. The six members were the self-appointed guardians of the Infinity Gems, which were each given to a single member in order to safeguard against anyone else assembling them into the Infinity Gauntlet.

==Fictional group history==
===Adam Warlock&#x27;s first version===
When Adam Warlock obtains possession of the all-powerful Infinity Gauntlet (that contained the six Infinity Gems) from Thanos, he is ordered by the Living Tribunal to separate the Gems so that they might never be used in conjunction again. Warlock forms the Infinity Watch, entrusting each member with an Infinity Gem to protect (keeping the identity of the sixth member a secret even from his fellow Infinity Watch-members). Under the Gauntlet&#x27;s influence, Warlock is not in his right mind, and even he wondered if he had made the right choices later on.

Initially, Warlock did not intend for the Watch to become a team; he believes the gems would be safer if they were all kept separately, but Warlock&#x27;s old enemy, the Man-Beast, abducts four Infinity Watch members and manipulated their gems in an attempt to destroy Warlock. After the Man-Beast is defeated, the Infinity Watch chose to stay together as a heroic team, except for Thanos. However, Thanos, having undergone a period of humility after the Infinity Gauntlet affair, did not abuse his gem, but kept it safe.

Warlock negotiates a deal with the Mole Man to use a castle on Monster Island as the Watch&#x27;s base. With help from The Avengers and Warlock, the United Nations recognize the Mole Man&#x27;s sovereignty of Monster Island (after a fatality-free battle with the Watch). The Infinity Watch goes on to deal with many other foes, most of them interested in the power the Gems could confer on their owner. Other opponents had personal interests in the Infinity Watch members.

An amnesic man appears on Monster Island and was taken in by the Watch despite Gamora&#x27;s warnings. Gamora, holding the Time Gem, has visions of this man killing Adam Warlock. The Watch names the man Maxam after a symbol found on his belt and he joins the Watch, despite a violent outburst against Warlock.

The Watch also becomes involved in the events of &quot;The Infinity War&quot; and &quot;The Infinity Crusade&quot;, both stemming from the events of &quot;The Infinity Gauntlet&quot;.

A while later Gamora leaves the team after an argument with Adam Warlock. Maxam became the new Guardian of the Time Gem. This causes his memories to return; he is under the belief that Warlock is a danger to his homeworld. Under Moondragon&#x27;s telepathic influence, Maxam believes that he had broken Warlock&#x27;s neck and returned to his own world.

Meanwhile, the being known as Rune steals all the Infinity Gems and took them to the Ultraverse. With Gamora, Maxam and the gems gone, the Watch disbands. Although the gems are eventually returned to the Marvel Universe, the Watch has not been fully reestablished yet; however, Adam Warlock, Gamora, and Pip were shown attempting to overthrow the Champion of the Universe&#x27;s rule of the planet Skardon in the 2004–2005 &quot;She-Hulk&quot; series, and at one point recruited Drax to aid in their efforts.

===Doctor Strange&#x27;s version===
At the end of the &quot;Infinity Countdown&quot; storyline, Doctor Strange used a magic spell to speak to the holders of the Infinity Gems and requested a parley to reform the Infinity Watch. He states to Adam Warlock, Black Widow&#x27;s clone, Captain Marvel, Star-Lord, and Turk Barrett that they need to safeguard them from such calamities even if one of them is Thanos.

===Loki&#x27;s version===
In order to retrieve her soul piece that was trapped in the Soulworld, Gamora using the alias of Requiem, stole the Infinity Stones from Doctor Strange&#x27;s Infinity Watch, but ended being corrupted by her father&#x27;s influence and the seductive power of the Infinity Stones. She uses the Infinity Stones, and the Soul Stone, in particular, to not only recover her missing soul but also fold the universe into itself, combining every two souls into a single being. This resulted in the creation of “warped” characters with Loki to be the only one who wasn&#x27;t merged with another character since he was beside Requiem, nevertheless, before he was placed into this new reality afterward, he was able to lightly influence her while she was committing the act so he could dupe his own version of the Infinity Watch within the Soul World.

===Adam Warlock&#x27;s second version===
To prevent the Infinity Stones from being stolen, Adam Warlock gave them a free will so they can choose their own Infinity Watch. The Soul Stone created the Mergiverse, a pocket multiverse that is home of the Secret Warps; the Time Stone chose Hector Bautista / Overtime, a Texan inmate convicted for a murder that he didn&#x27;t commit; the Reality Stone chose Ripley Ryan / Star, a former journalist turned supervillainess; the Space Stone chose Quantum, a human test subject used by his boss Assessor; the Power Stone chose Apex/Prince of Power, a Musculan from the planet Muscula; the Soul Stone chose a robot named Ward who became Multitude; the Mind Stone chose a human named Worldmind before he was killed by Thanos and came into the possession of Colleen Wing; and the newly-created Death Stone revived Phil Coulson and chose him as its wielder.

== Team roster ==

==Other versions==
A team called the Infinity Watch exists in the year 3193, first appearing in &quot;Uncanny Avengers&quot; #16. Led by Immortus, it includes Captain Marvel, Silver Surfer, Martinex, Yondu, Starhawk, Adam Warlock, and the Vision with the power of The Phoenix.

==In other media==
In the 2017 video game &quot;Marvel vs. Capcom: Infinite&quot;, in a scheme concocted by Jedah Dohma and Mistress Death to combine both the Marvel Universe and the Capcom multiverse to bring about equilibrium, utilizing the Infinity Stones, they enlist the help of Thanos and Ultron in infiltrating Abel City. However, he is intercepted by Sigma, and they form an alliance, betraying Thanos and utilizing the Space Stone and Reality Stone to fuse into Ultron-Sigma, and succeeds in combining the Marvel and Capcom realities. After defeating Ultron-Sigma by the end of the game, the Reality Stone is cracked, thus rendering the restoration and separation of the combined realities impossible. Now with no choice but live on the unified world, the heroes resolve to individually protect the Stones one by one to prevent them from ever being used again, as to avert a similar disaster from happening ever again, paralleling the Infinity Watch&#x27;s purpose.

<text>A dog sled or dog sleigh is a sled pulled by one or more sled dogs used to travel over ice and through snow, a practice known as mushing. Numerous types of sleds are used, depending on their function. They can be used for dog sled racing. Traditionally in Greenland and the eastern Canadian Arctic the Inuit had the dogs pull in a fan shape in front of the sled, while in other regions, such as Alaska and the western part of Northern Canada the dogs pull side by side in pairs.

==History==

Dog power has been used for hunting and traveling for over a thousand years. As far back as the 10th century CE these dogs have contributed to human culture.

Assembling a dog sled team involves picking lead dogs, point dogs, swing dogs, and wheel dogs. The lead dog is crucial, so mushers take extraordinary care of these dogs. Another important detail is to have powerful wheel dogs to pull the sled out from the snow. Point dogs (optional) are located behind the leader dogs, swing dogs between the point and wheel dogs, and team dogs are all other dogs in between the wheel and swing dogs and are selected for their endurance, strength, and speed as part of the team. In dog sledding, Siberian Huskies or Alaskan Malamutes are the main types of dogs that are used for recreational sledding because of their strength, speed, and endurance as well as their ability to withstand the cold. However, Alaskan Huskies are also a popular dog for sled dog racing, because of their endurance, good eating habits, speed, and dedication to running even when tired.

Sometimes, for sprint races, mushers use short-haired hounds that are faster than the average husky. These hounds are raised from a young age to pull. It is harder to train hounds than it is to train Siberian Huskies and Malamutes to pull a sled because it is not in their nature.

In some situations, some Indigenous peoples&#x27; tribes would eat the dogs they had either because they were not useful, or if the sledder needed food.

<text>Walter G. Bright (born March 10, 1959) is an American computer programmer who created the D programming language, the Zortech C++ compiler, and the &quot;Empire&quot; computer game.

==Early life and education==
Bright is the son of the United States Air Force pilot Charles D. Bright. He taught himself computer programming from the type-in programs in &quot;BASIC Computer Games&quot;.

Bright graduated from Caltech in 1979 with a Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering and a minor in Aeronautical Engineering. While at university he wrote the &quot;Empire&quot; wargame for the PDP-10 mainframe.

==Career==
Bright wrote Mattel Intellivision games while at Caltech, then worked as a mechanical engineer after graduation. After learning C in the early 1980s he ported &quot;Empire&quot; to the IBM PC, stating that C &quot;might as well have been called EIL, for &#x27;Empire Implementation Language.&#x27;&quot; Bright developed the Datalight C compiler, also sold as Zorland C and later Zortech C.

Bright was the main developer of the Zortech C++ compiler (later Symantec C++, now Digital Mars C++), which was the first C++ compiler to translate source code directly to object code without using C as an intermediate. 

===D programming language===
Bright is the creator of the D programming language. He has implemented compilers for several other languages, and is considered an expert in many areas related to compiler technology. Walter regularly writes scientific and magazine articles about compilers and programming and was a blogger for &quot;Dr. Dobb&#x27;s Journal&quot;.

Around 2014, Bright wrote Warp, a fast C/C++ preprocessor written in D, for Facebook.

<doc id="452290" wikidata="Q2907585" url="?curid=452290" title="Pan Am Flight 73">
<text>Pan Am Flight 73 was a Pan American World Airways flight from Bombay, India, to New York City, United States, with scheduled stops in Karachi, Pakistan, and Frankfurt, West Germany.

On September 5, 1986, the Boeing 747-121 serving the flight was hijacked while on the ground at Karachi by four armed Palestinian terrorists of the Abu Nidal Organization. The aircraft, with 360 passengers on board, had just arrived from Bombay. A grand jury later concluded that the militants were planning to use the hijacked airliner to pick up Palestinian prisoners in both Cyprus and Israel.

More than twenty passengers were killed during the hijacking, including nationals from India, the United States, Pakistan, and Mexico. All the hijackers were arrested and sentenced to death in Pakistan. However, the sentences were later commuted to life in prison. Senior Purser Neerja Bhanot was shot dead and posthumously received four awards: India&#x27;s highest peacetime award for bravery, the Ashok Chakra Award, the United States Special Courage award, and two awards from Pakistan, which were Tamgha-e-Pakistan, the fourth highest civil award from Pakistan for her efforts to save passengers&#x27; lives, and the Nishan-e-Pakistan.

==Hijacking at Karachi==
Pan Am Flight 73 originated in Mumbai and stopped at the Karachi airport for a scheduled stopover at 4:30a.m. It was carrying 394 passengers and 9 infants, an American flight crew and 13 Indian flight attendants. A total of 109 passengers disembarked at Karachi. The first busload of fresh passengers from Karachi had barely reached the aircraft standing on the tarmac when the hijacking began to unfold.

The four hijackers were dressed as Karachi airport security guards and were armed with assault rifles, pistols, grenades, and plastic explosive belts. The hijackers drove a van that had been modified to look like an airport security vehicle, fitted with a siren and flashing lights. They went through a security checkpoint up to one of the boarding stairways to Pan Am Flight 73. They rushed up the ramp, firing shots into the air. Another two hijackers joined the first two men, one of them dressed in Pakistani shalwar kameez and carrying a briefcase full of grenades. There was also gunfire outside the aircraft reported around this time, which killed two Kuwait Airlines staff members working on an aircraft nearby. The hijackers fired shots at the feet of a flight attendant forcing him to close the door. Another flight attendant, Neerja Bhanot, was out of sight of the hijackers and relayed the hijack code to the cockpit crew, who subsequently exited the aircraft through the overhead emergency hatch, via the Inertial Reel Escape Device.

After about 40 minutes from the landing of Flight 73, the airliner came under the control of the hijackers. The exit of the pilots immobilised the aircraft.

The four hijackers were later identified as Zayd Hassan Abd al-Latif Safarini (Safarini, alias &quot;Mustafa&quot;), Jamal Saeed Abdul Rahim (alias &quot;Fahad&quot;), Muhammad Abdullah Khalil Hussain ar-Rahayyal (&quot;Khalil&quot;), and Muhammad Ahmed Al-Munawar (alias &quot;Mansoor&quot;). Pakistani authorities also identified another accomplice Wadoud Muhammad Hafiz al-Turki (&quot;Hafiz&quot;) and arrested him a week later.

=== Demand for pilot ===
Within a short time after seizing control of the aircraft, the lead hijacker Safarini realized that the cockpit crew had escaped and therefore he would be forced to negotiate with officials. First and business class passengers were ordered to go towards the back of the plane. At the same time, passengers at the back of the plane were ordered forward. Since the aircraft was nearly full, passengers sat down in the aisles, galleys and door exits.

At approximately 10:00, Safarini went through the plane and arrived at the seat of Rajesh Kumar, a 29-year-old Kenya-born Indian resident of Huntington Beach, California, who had recently been naturalized as an American citizen. Safarini ordered Kumar to come to the front of the aircraft, to kneel at the front doorway of the aircraft, and to face the front of the aircraft with his hands behind his head. Safarini negotiated with officials, in particular Viraf Daroga, the head of Pan Am&#x27;s Pakistan operation, stating that if the crew was not sent on the plane within 30 minutes, then Kumar would be shot.

Shortly thereafter, Safarini became impatient with the officials and grabbed Kumar and shot him in the head in front of witnesses both on and off the aircraft. Safarini heaved Kumar out of the door onto the ramp below. Pakistani personnel on the ramp reported that Kumar was still breathing when he was placed in an ambulance, but he was pronounced dead on the way to the hospital in Karachi.

Safarini joined the hijackers and ordered flight attendants Bhanot, Sunshine Vesuwala, and Madhvi Bahuguna to begin collecting passports. They complied with this request. During the collection of the passports, believing passengers with American passports would be singled out by the hijackers, the flight attendants proceeded to hide some of the American passports under seats, and dumped the rest down a rubbish chute.

After the passports had been collected, Bhanot came onto the intercom and asked for Michael John Thexton, a British citizen, to come to the front of the plane. Thexton was returning home to England after visiting Pakistan for a personal pilgrimage to Broad Peak, where his brother, a keen mountaineer, had died of altitude sickness in 1983, and boarded the flight in Karachi to disembark at the Frankfurt stop and connect to another Pan Am flight for London. He went through the curtain into the front of the plane where he came face to face with Safarini, who was holding Thexton&#x27;s passport. He asked Thexton if he was a soldier and if he had a gun, Thexton replied &quot;No&quot;. He ordered Thexton onto his knees. Safarini told the officials that if anyone came near the plane that he would go on to kill another passenger.

Viraf Daroga told Safarini that there was a crew member on board who was able to use the cockpit radio and asked him to negotiate through radio. Safarini went back to Thexton and asked him whether he would like a drink of water, to which Thexton replied &quot;Yes.&quot; Safarini also asked Thexton if he was married, and claimed he did not like all this violence and killing and said that the Americans and Israelis had taken over his country and left him unable to lead a proper life. One of the hijackers ordered Thexton to return to his seat.

Thexton had the opportunity to ask his hijacker about this experience forty years later, and ask why he had not been shot. The hijacker explained that when Thexton had told him that his brother had died and he didn&#x27;t want to leave his mother childless that the hijacker had sympathy for him and let him go.

The hijack stalemate continued on into the night. During the stalemate, Dick Melhart was positioned by the door and was able to unlock it when the firing started. About 21:00 the auxiliary power unit shut down, all lighting turned off, and emergency lights came on. Passengers at the front were ordered toward the back, while passengers at the back were ordered forward; however, passengers who stood up in preparation of complying with the hijackers&#x27; request saw that the aisles were full of passengers (and thus impassable), and simply sat back down again.

With the plane out of power and sitting in near darkness, a hijacker at the L1 door said a prayer and then aimed to shoot at the explosive belt worn by another hijacker near the door. The intent was to cause an explosion massive enough to kill all passengers and crew on board, as well as themselves, but this failed. Immediately the hijackers began shooting their weapons into the cabin at passengers and threw grenades.

Ultimately it was the bullets that created the most damage since each bullet would bounce off aircraft cabin surfaces and create crippling shrapnel. An air hostess at the L3 door opened the door; although the slide did not deploy, several passengers and crew jumped down the 20feet () to the ramp.

Dick Melhart was able to unlatch the door at R3 which was the exit over the wing; passengers jumped out from this exit. A grounds staff trapped on board during the ordeal was responsible for opening the R4 door, which was the only door armed to deploy the emergency slide. Ultimately this slide allowed for more passengers to evacuate safely and without injuries. Bhanot and the other crew members bravely escorted as many passengers as they could first. The other crew survived, but Bhanot was murdered by the hijackers.

===Rescue assault===

The Pakistani unit responsible for retaking the plane was the Special Service Group (SSG) which was led by Brig. Tariq Mehmood. The SSG Commandos closed in on the aircraft after the power unit went out but did not begin storming the plane until they heard shots fired from within the plane. By the time the commandos reached the plane, many passengers had already begun escaping.

There are some inconsistencies regarding the Pakistani Army&#x27;s reported response to the generator dying. This confusion was later attributed to a rush by officials to take credit for a successful assault on the hijackers followed by a walking-back of statements once the death toll of the tragedy became clear.

==Passengers==
The 365 total passengers plus crew on Pan Am 73 were citizens of 14 different countries. Citizens of India represented roughly 27% of the people on board the flight, and 24% of those killed. Citizens of three India, Italy, and the United together represented the bulk (71%) of those killed.

===Nationalities===

===Cockpit crew===
* Captain William Allen &quot;Bill&quot; Kianka (born June 1, 1934), Age 52, He served in the U.S. Navy from 1952 to 1954 and fought in one tour in the Korean War, and was serving with Pan Am as a Captain since 1954.
* First Officer Conway Tehan Dodge Sr. (born May 30, 1933), Age 53, He served in the U.S. Marine Corps from 1951 to 1955 and fought in two tours in the Korean War, and was serving with Pan Am as a First Officer since 1955.
* Flight Engineer John Joseph Ridgway (born September 25, 1940), Age 45, He was serving with Pan Am as a Flight Engineer since 1962.

==Aftermath==

===Trial and sentencing===
On July 6, 1988, the five Palestinian men were convicted in Pakistan for their roles in the hijacking and murders and sentenced to death: Zayd Hassan Abd al-Latif Safarini, Wadoud Muhammad Hafiz al-Turki, Jamal Saeed Abdul Rahim, Muhammad Abdullah Khalil Hussain ar-Rahayyal, and Muhammad Ahmed al-Munawar. The sentences were later commuted to life in prison.

According to a CNN report, Safarini was handed over to the FBI from a prison in Pakistan in September 2001. He was taken to the United States where on May 13, 2005, he was sentenced to a 160-year prison term. At the plea proceeding, Safarini admitted that he and his fellow hijackers committed the offences as members of the Abu Nidal Organization, also called the ANO, a designated terrorist organization.

The other four prisoners were deported by Pakistani authorities to PA in Israel in 2008.

==Libyan involvement and legal action==
Libya has been accused of sponsoring the hijacking, as well as carrying out the bombings of Pan Am Flight 103 in 1988 and UTA Flight 772 in 1989.

In August 2003, Libya accepted responsibility for &quot;the actions of its officials&quot; for the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103, but was silent on the question of the Pan Am Flight 73 hijacking. Libya offered US$2.7 billion in compensation to the families of the 270 victims of Pan Am Flight 103 and, in January 2004, agreed to pay $170 million to the families of the 170 victims of UTA Flight 772. The seven American UTA victims&#x27; families refused the offer and instead filed a claim for $2.2 billion against Libya. From 2004 to 2006 the US and the UK jointly opened up relations with Libya, leading to the removal of sanctions imposed and of Libya&#x27;s inclusion on the list of countries that sponsor terrorism.

In June 2004, a volunteer group of families and victims from the incident, &quot;Families from Pan Am Flight 73&quot;, was formed to work toward a memorial for those killed in the incident, to seek the truth behind this terrorist attack, and to hold those responsible for it accountable. On April 5, 2006, the law firm of Crowell &amp; Moring LLP, representing the surviving passengers, estates and family members of the hijacking victims, announced it was filing a civil suit in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia seeking $10 billion in compensatory damages, plus unspecified punitive damages, from Libya, Muammar al-Gaddafi and the five convicted hijackers. The lawsuit alleged Libya provided the Abu Nidal Organization with material support and also ordered the attack as part of a Libyan-sponsored terrorist campaign against American, European and Israeli interests.

British media that was critical of normalisation of relations between Gaddafi and the West reported in March 2004 (days after Prime Minister Tony Blair visited Tripoli) that Libya was behind the hijacking.

As of September 2015 about $700 million of funds that Libya gave the US to settle claims related to Libyan sponsored terrorism has not been distributed to families of victims who were Indian passport holders.

==Reward and reported killing of accused==
Zayd Hassan Abd al-Latif Safarini was extradited to the U.S. by the Government of Pakistan. He is serving his 160-year sentence at the United States Penitentiary, Terre Haute in Terre Haute, Indiana.

The other four prisoners were deported by Pakistani authorities to PA in Israel in 2008. On December 3, 2009, the FBI, in coordination with the State Department, announced a $5M reward for information that leads to the capture of each of the four remaining hijackers of Pan Am 73.

One of the four, Jamal Saeed Abdul Rahim, was allegedly killed in a drone strike in Pakistan on January 9, 2010. His death was never confirmed and he remains on the FBI&#x27;s Most Wanted Terrorists list and the State Department&#x27;s Rewards for Justice list.

In hopes of generating new leads for the alleged hijackers the FBI released new age-progressed images on January 11, 2018. The case is still under investigation by the Washington Field Office of the Bureau.

==Aircraft==
The aircraft was a four-engined Boeing 747-121 delivered to Pan Am on June 18, 1971, with registration named &quot;Clipper Live Yankee&quot; by the airline. It was later renamed and at the time of the incident was named &quot;Clipper Empress of the Seas&quot;. After the incident the aircraft was renamed &quot;Clipper New Horizons&quot;. Pan Am sold the aircraft to Evergreen International Airlines in 1988 and then leased it back. The aircraft was returned by Pan Am to Evergreen in April 1991. Evergreen scrapped the aircraft in 2015.

==In popular culture==
The film &quot;Neerja&quot; was released on February 19, 2016, depicting the hijacking and crew&#x27;s efforts from the perspective of senior purser Neerja Bhanot.

A documentary about the hijacking, called &quot;Hijacked: Flight 73&quot;, was released in 2023.

<doc id="452293" wikidata="Q1637108" url="?curid=452293" title="Ulysses 31">
<text>is an anime series (1981) that updates the Greek mythology of Odysseus (known as &quot;Ulixes&quot; or &quot;Ulysses&quot; in Latin) to the 31st century. The show comprises 26 half-hour episodes as a co-production between DIC Audiovisuel and Tokyo Movie Shinsha.

==Premise==
The series follows the struggles of Ulysses and his crew against the divine entities that rule the universe, the ancient gods from Greek mythology. The Gods of Olympus are angered when Ulysses, commander of the giant spaceship &quot;Odyssey&quot;, kills the giant Cyclops to save a group of enslaved children, including his son. Zeus sentences Ulysses to travel the universe with his crew frozen until he finds the Kingdom of Hades, at which point his crew will be revived and he will be able to return to Earth. Along the way they encounter numerous other famous figures from Greek mythology, given a futuristic twist.

==Main characters==
* is the main character and captain of the &quot;Odyssey&quot;. He achieved the solar peace and became the target of the Olympian gods&#x27; revenge. His weapon is a laser pistol that conceals an energy blade, complemented by an energy shield and a belt that allows him to fly. Ulysses is brave, noble, determined, and will stop at nothing to defeat the gods.
* is the son of Ulysses and second in command for most of the voyage. He is Yumi&#x27;s friend and protector. He is a skilled pilot, and his weapon is a high-tech magnetic slingshot.
* is Thémis in the original French dub (after Themis the ancient Titan). A blue-skinned humanoid alien girl from the white planet, Zotra, she is the younger sister of Numinor and possesses telepathic powers. She is saved from being sacrificed to the Cyclops, along with Telemachus and her older brother, by Ulysses. She exhibits telekinesis and is immune to fire. Although physically very frail, she is very intelligent and courageous. Zotrians, aside from blue skin, have snow-white hair, pointed ears, and slanted eyes with cat-like vertical pupils.
* is Noumaïos in the original French dub. A Zotrian teenager and older brother of Yumi, he is saved by Ulysses from being sacrificed to the Cyclops. He is in suspended animation along with the rest of the crew for most of the series. His Japanese name Yumaiosu is the katakana orthography of English pronunciation of Eumaeus, the pig-guardian of Odysseus in Homer&#x27;s poem.
* is the small robotic companion of Telemachus. Fond of eating nuts and nails, he is a trusty friend who was given to Telemachus as a birthday present. He is skilled at machinery repair and possesses tremendous physical strength.
* is the &quot;Odyssey&quot;″s main computer, with a deep female voice.
* is the god of gods, persecutor of Ulysses.
* is the god of the Seas, enraged by Ulysses&#x27;s killing of his creature, the Cyclops. He wields a trident, the symbol of his power, and his servants pilot ships that are shaped like a trident.
* is the ruling god of the Underworld. Ulysses must find his realm to find the way back to Earth.

==Episodes==
===Pilot===
In 1980, TAF, TMS Entertainment, and DiC Audiovisuel produced a pilot for the series, simply titled &quot;Ulysses 31&quot;. Although there was a Japanese VHS release of the series by King Records in 1986, the pilot never saw an official home release and was used for internal use only.

The pilot has long been considered as only been recorded in Japanese, until a French searcher discovered a copy of the French version in July 2015, then a copy of the English-dubbed version in June 2022.

The story is virtually identical to episode one of the finished series; however, the story was the only thing that was kept. Some characters underwent major redesigns from a typical anime design to the finished series, which is a mix of Japanese anime style and European art based on the appearance of classical Greek sculpture. Renowned Japanese illustrators and animators Shingo Araki and Michi Himeno, who have worked in anime adaptations of famous manga (such as Masami Kurumada&#x27;s &quot;Saint Seiya&quot;, &quot;Fūma no Kojirō&quot;, &quot;Ring ni Kakero&quot;, Riyoko Ikeda&#x27;s &quot;Versailles no Bara&quot;, and &quot;UFO Robo Grendizer&quot; OVA) were responsible for the finished series&#x27; character designs, animation routines, and visual style.

==Soundtrack==
Most of the original soundtrack was composed by Denny Crockett and Ike Egan. Six additional themes were composed by Shuki Levy and Haim Saban: &quot;Potpourri&quot;, &quot;Final Glory&quot;, &quot;Space Traffic&quot;, &quot;Ulysse Meets Ulysse&quot;, &quot;Mermaids&quot;, and &quot;Change of Time (Theme of Chronos)&quot;.

The Japanese version has a different soundtrack. The music was composed by Wakakusa Kei, who made the soundtrack in both the series and pilot that was produced in 1980. An official soundtrack was released in 1986 on vinyl and on CD in 1988 by King Records.

<doc id="452298" wikidata="Q83640" url="?curid=452298" title="Dian Lake">
<text>Dian Lake (), also known as Dianchi, Dianchi Lake, Lake Dian and Kunming Lake, is a fault lake located on the Puduhe-Xishan fault in Kunming, Yunnan, China at 24°23′–26°22′ N, 102°10′–103°40′ E. Its nickname is the &quot;Sparkling Pearl Embedded in a Highland&quot; (; pinyin: &quot;Gāoyuánmíngzhū&quot;). It is the model for the Kunming Lake in Beijing&#x27;s Summer Palace. Its name is the source of Yunnan&#x27;s Chinese abbreviation .

Dian Lake is a shallow freshwater fault lake. The Lake is 40 km long, running from north to south, and has an average width of 7 km with the widest point being 12.5 km. The lake is 1886 meters above sea level and has 150 km of coastline. The lake&#x27;s drainage area has a monsoon-affected subtropical highland climate (Köppen &quot;Cwb&quot;), with an average annual temperature of 14.4 °C, a frost-free period of 227 days, and an annual precipitation of 1036 mm. The lake covers . The lake has an average depth of , and is divided into two parts by an artificial dike. The northern end of the lake is called Caohai (; pinyin: &quot;Cáohǎi&quot;) and has a surface area of 7.5 km2 and an average depth of 2.5 meters. The southern end of the lake, comprising the majority of the lake, is called Waihai (; pinyin: &quot;Wàihǎi&quot;) and has a surface area of 292 km2 and an average depth of 4.4 m. The water flows out of the lake to the west via the Pudu River (Chinese: 普渡河; pinyin: &quot;Pǔdù Hé&quot;) which eventually joins the Yangtze River before finally reaching the Pacific Ocean. Dian Lake is the sixth largest lake in China and the largest lake in Yunnan Province.

==Etymology==

The Chinese character for the lake (; pinyin: &quot;Diān&quot;) is a phonosemantic compound of the radical (&quot;water&quot;) and the character (&quot;real&quot;). The character was first found in the &quot;Records of the Grand Historian&quot; as the name of the Dian Kingdom. Modern studies suggest that the character 滇 is derived from the language of the extinct ancient Bo people and means basin. The character 滇 has been used as the name of the lake since at least 109 BC, when the Han dynasty established &quot;Dianchi County&quot; (滇池县) in the area.

==History==
Dian Lake was the site of the capital of the independent kingdom of the Cuan () during the first millennium AD. At that time, it was known as Kunchuan ()..

Between 1958 and 1970, under the CCP&#x27;s agriculture strategy of &quot;Taking grain as the key link&quot;, approximately 54 square kilometers of Dian Lake marshland were reclaimed to expand industry and agriculture in the Kunming basin. On December 28, 1969, a rally for &quot;reclaiming land from the sea&quot; was held in Kunming&#x27;s Dongfeng Square. 100,000 soldiers along with students and factory workers were mobilized to &quot;fight a war of annihilation to take farmland from Dian Lake&quot;. The participants shouted the heroic slogan &quot;March to Dian Lake! Take grain from Dian Lake!&quot;. Reclamation efforts were led by People&#x27;s Liberation Army Lieutenant General Tan Furen. Immediately after taking office, Tan Furen announced that Dian Lake would be a model for the national &quot;reclaiming land from the sea&quot; campaign. The goal was to reclaim 30,000 mu (20 km2) of land from Dian Lake to develop agriculture. Tan Furen personally spearheaded the reclamation project until his death by assassination in 1970.

==Pollution==
Pollution is a major problem for the lake. Yunnan Province has long been primarily agricultural, but the Dianchi basin has witnessed high industrial growth and boasts the highest population density within Kunming City. 

In the late 1990’s to early 2000’s, Dian Lake was identified as one of the 3 top water pollution concerns in China. The pollution peaked in 2009, at which time the water in Dian Lake was classified &quot;worse than Grade 5&quot; (too dangerous for human contact). Ninety percent of the city of Kunming&#x27;s wastewater was dumped untreated into the lake until the first wastewater plant was built in 1990. Some experts estimated that over 55% of the lake&#x27;s fish population has been killed off by this disease-ridden type of pollution. The China Environmental Statistical Yearbook data reported that in 2013, 400 million tons of municipal sewage and 8 million tons of industrial waste water were dumped into Dian Lake of which only 1.5 million tons were treated before dumping. As of 2022, the water in the lake is still rated Grade 5, but is deemed to meet the functional requirements of a water environment.

Historically, Dian Lake played an important role in regulating the microclimate of the surrounding area. It contributed to the productivity of Yunnan Province&#x27;s industry, agriculture, husbandry, and fisheries. Because Dian Lake is a relatively closed lake with a slow water-exchange rate and low self-purification capacity, it is particularly susceptible to harmful algal blooms and heavy metal contamination. From 1966 to 1970, the lake reclamation project caused severe damage to marsh wetlands in the Caohai area, which along with the large amounts of urban sewage and industrial wastewater traditionally discharged into the lake, exceeded its self-purification capacity and caused serious pollution. It has also been badly affected by cyanobacteria outbreaks in recent decades. To control the pollution of Dian Lake, the Chinese government listed it as a national sewage treatment project in the ‘‘Three Rivers and Three Lakes’’ (Liaohe, Huaihe, Haihe, Taihu, Chaohu, and Dianchi) scheme launched in 1995. The extensive land reclamation and urbanization projects have had long-lasting impacts on Dian Lake, necessitating ongoing rehabilitation and pollution control efforts to restore the lake&#x27;s ecological balance. As a result, some wetland parks have been constructed in the lakeside zone to purify the water and create leisure areas for citizens. Wetland parks are mainly in the form of oxidation ponds. They are small water bodies with aquatic plants such as Phragmites australis, Typha orientalis, Acorus calamus, Eichhornia crassipes, Lemna minor, and Pistia stratiotes; outside the ponds, there are trails, trees, and lawns.

==Biodiversity==
Together with other Yunnan lakes (Fuxian, Qilu, Yangzong, Xingyun, and Yilong), Dian Lake is recognized as an ecoregion. Among the three major Yunnan lakes with a high number of endemics, the other two being Fuxian and Erhai, the most drastic loss of biodiversity has been seen in the Dian Lake. Of the 25 native fish species and subspecies in Dian Lake, 10 are endemic to the basin: &quot;Acheilognathus elongatus&quot;, &quot;Anabarilius alburnops&quot;, &quot;Anabarilius polylepis&quot;, &quot;Cyprinus micristius&quot;, &quot;Liobagrus kingi&quot;, &quot;Pseudobagrus medianalis&quot;, &quot;Silurus mento&quot;, &quot;Sinocyclocheilus grahami&quot;, &quot;Sphaerophysa dianchiensis&quot; and &quot;Xenocypris yunnanensis&quot;. Today, the only endemic fish known to survive in the lake itself is &quot;Anabarilius alburnops&quot;, but it is endangered. The remaining have not been recorded there since the 1990s or earlier, and most are presumed extinct. Two other species, &quot;Schizothorax grahami&quot; and &quot;Yunnanilus nigromaculatus&quot;, are endemic to the general region, but have also disappeared from Dian Lake itself. Among the non-endemic natives, only gold fish and Asian swamp eel still live in Dian Lake. In contrast to the status of the natives, the lake is now home to more than 25 introduced fish species.

The Yunnan lake newt (&quot;Cynops wolterstorffi&quot;) was also endemic to the lake, but it has not been seen since 1979 and is considered extinct.

Many native hydrophytes have also disappeared from the lake.

<text>Samurai Jack is an American animated action-adventure science fantasy television series created by Genndy Tartakovsky for Cartoon Network and Adult Swim. The show is produced by Cartoon Network Studios. Tartakovsky conceived &quot;Samurai Jack&quot; after finishing his work on his first Cartoon Network original series, &quot;Dexter&#x27;s Laboratory&quot;, which premiered in 1996. &quot;Samurai Jack&quot; took inspiration from &quot;Kung Fu&quot;, the 1972 televised drama starring David Carradine, as well as Tartakovsky&#x27;s fascination with samurai culture and the Frank Miller comic series &quot;Ronin&quot;.

The titular character is an unnamed Japanese samurai prince who wields a mystic katana capable of cutting through virtually anything. He sets out to free his kingdom after it is taken over by an evil, shapeshifting demon lord known as Aku. The two engage in a fierce battle, but just as the prince is about to deal the final strike, Aku sends him forward in time to a dystopian future ruled by the tyrannical demon. Adopting the name &quot;Jack&quot; after being addressed as such by beings in this time period, he quests to travel back to his own time and defeat Aku before he can take over the world. Jack&#x27;s search for a way back to his own time period transcends Aku&#x27;s control, but Jack&#x27;s efforts are largely in vain due to the way back to his home ending up just out of his reach.

&quot;Samurai Jack&quot;, originally airing for four seasons comprising thirteen episodes each, was broadcast from August 10, 2001, to September 25, 2004, without concluding the overarching story. The show was revived thirteen years later for a darker, more mature fifth season that provides a conclusion to Jack&#x27;s story, with Williams Street assisting in production; it premiered on Cartoon Network&#x27;s Adult Swim as part of its Toonami programming block on March 11, 2017, and concluded with its final episode on May 20, 2017. Episodes were directed by Tartakovsky, often in collaboration with others.

The series has garnered critical acclaim and won eight Primetime Emmy Awards, including Outstanding Animated Program, as well as six Annie Awards and an OIAF Award. It is widely considered to be one of the greatest animated shows of all time.

== Premise ==

&quot;Samurai Jack&quot; tells the story of an unnamed young prince (voiced by Phil LaMarr) from a kingdom set in feudal Japan, whose father, the emperor of Japan (voiced by Sab Shimono as an elder man; Keone Young as a young emperor), was given a magical katana from three gods—Ra, Rama, and Odin—that he could and had used to defeat and imprison the supernatural shapeshifting demon Aku (Mako, and later Greg Baldwin for Season 5). Eight years later Aku escaped, took over the land, and held the Emperor hostage, but not before the prince was sent away by his mother to travel so that he could train and return with the magic sword to defeat Aku. On his return, the prince-turned-samurai faced and almost defeated Aku, but before he could land a finishing blow, Aku placed a time travel curse and sent him into the distant future, anticipating that he would be able to deal with the samurai by that time.

The samurai prince arrives on Earth surrounded in dystopian retrofuturism ruled by Aku. The first people he encounters call him &quot;Jack&quot; as a form of slang, which he adopts as his name. His given name is never revealed. Jack only has his kimono, geta, and sword to his avail in his adventures. Most episodes depict Jack overcoming various obstacles in his quest to travel back to his own time and defeat Aku, and his quest is prolonged occasionally by moments where either he nearly succeeds in returning to his own time, or conversely, Aku nearly succeeds in defeating Jack, only to be undermined by the unexpected.

=== Setting ===
The retro-futuristic world is inhabited by a variety of denizens such as robots, extraterrestrials, talking animals, monsters, magical beings, and deities. Some areas may have advanced technologies like flying cars, while others resemble ancient times or industrial conditions. Moreover, Aku has brought aliens from other planets to inhabit Earth, after destroying the habitability of their home worlds. Criminals and fugitives of all kinds are very common on his Earth. Mythological and supernatural creatures make regular appearances and coexist among the technologically advanced inhabitants.

Despite exponential levels of technological advancement, there are still uninhabited areas of the world. Those include forests, jungles, and mountains, which have remained largely untouched even as Aku began his conquest and reign over every sentient being. A few communities of intelligent creatures, like Shaolin monks, have also remained largely untouched in spite of Aku&#x27;s reign.

== Production ==
&quot;Samurai Jack&quot; was created by Genndy Tartakovsky as a follow-up to his successful series &quot;Dexter&#x27;s Laboratory&quot;. Cartoon Network executive Mike Lazzo recalled Tartakovsky pitching him the series: &quot;He said, &#x27;Hey, remember David Carradine in &quot;Kung Fu&quot;? Wasn&#x27;t that cool?&#x27; and I was like, &#x27;Yeah, that&#x27;s really cool.&#x27; That was literally the pitch.&quot; Tartakovsky said of the pitch, &quot;It could backfire. People could say, &#x27;I don&#x27;t get it. There&#x27;s hardly any dialogue.&#x27; But to me that just makes it more compelling.&quot; Lazzo supported Tartakovsky&#x27;s efforts, calling him &quot;an architect of the success of the Cartoon Network.&quot; According to Betty Cohen, then-president of Cartoon Network Worldwide, &quot;Samurai Jack&quot; was greenlit for 26 episodes before its pilot was produced, a decision Cohen attributed to Tartakovsky&#x27;s success with &quot;Dexter&#x27;s Laboratory&quot;. Cartoon Network billed it as a series &quot;that is cinematic in scope and that incorporates action, humor, and intricate artistry.&quot;

The basic premise of &quot;Samurai Jack&quot; comes from Tartakovsky&#x27;s childhood fascination with samurai culture and the bushido code, as well as a recurring dream where he wandered a post-apocalyptic Earth with a samurai sword and traveled the world fighting mutants with his crush. The show is inspired by 1970s cinematography, as well as classic Hollywood films such as &quot;Ben-Hur&quot;, &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot;, and &quot;Spartacus&quot;. Thematic and visual inspirations come from Frank Miller&#x27;s comic book series &quot;Rōnin&quot;, including the premise of a master-less, nameless samurai warrior thrown into a dystopic future in order to battle a shapeshifting demon. Similarly, the episode &quot;Jack and the Spartans&quot; was specifically inspired by Miller&#x27;s graphic novel &quot;300&quot; that retold the Battle of Thermopylae. The Japanese manga &quot;Lone Wolf and Cub&quot; and films by Akira Kurosawa were also inspirations.

The network announced the series&#x27; launch at a press conference on February 21, 2001. Weeks leading up to the series were accompanied by a sweepstakes giveaway sponsored by AOL in which the grand prize was a trip for four to Japan. AOL subscribers were offered sneak peeks of &quot;Samurai Jack&quot; as well as a look at samurai traditions, future toys, behind-the-scenes model sheets, and exclusive Cartoon Orbit cToons. A CD-ROM containing clips of the premiere movie and a countdown clock until the series&#x27; premiere was distributed as part of AOL 6.0&#x27;s release. &quot;Samurai Jack&quot; debuted on Cartoon Network on August 10, 2001, with the three-part special &quot;The Beginning&quot;. As production of the fourth season was ending, with four seasons of 13 episodes each or 52 episodes of &quot;Samurai Jack&quot; in total, Tartakovsky, and the crew moved on to other projects. The show ended with the airing of the four final episodes as a marathon on September 25, 2004.

In Canada, &quot;Samurai Jack&quot; previously aired on YTV, and currently airs on the Canadian version of Adult Swim.

In United Kingdom, &quot;Samurai Jack&quot; previously aired on Cartoon Network, and currently airs on streaming service All 4.

=== Conclusion ===
The original series was left open-ended after the conclusion of the fourth season. Tartakovsky said, &quot;coming close to [the end of] the fourth season, we&#x27;re like, &#x27;are we gonna finish it?&#x27; And I didn&#x27;t know... The network didn&#x27;t know, they were going through a lot of transitions also. So I decided, you know, I don&#x27;t want to rush and finish the whole story, and so we just left it like there is no conclusion and then [the final episode is] just like another episode&quot;. Art director Scott Wills added, &quot;We didn&#x27;t have time to think about it, because we went right into &quot;Clone Wars&quot;. They even overlapped, I think. There was no time to even think about it.&quot;

=== Cancelled film ===
A film intended to conclude the story of &quot;Samurai Jack&quot; had been in development at different times by four different studios. As early as 2002, Cartoon Network was producing a &quot;Samurai Jack&quot; live-action feature film, in association with New Line Cinema. Brett Ratner was hired as a director. Tartakovsky said in a 2006 interview that the live-action version of &quot;Samurai Jack&quot; was thankfully abandoned, and that &quot;we will finish the story, and there will be an animated film.&quot; Fred Seibert announced in 2007 that the newly formed Frederator Films was developing a &quot;Samurai Jack&quot; movie, which was planned to be in stereoscopic 2D with a budget of 20 million dollars. Seibert said in 2009 the film was being co-produced with J. J. Abrams&#x27; Bad Robot Productions. Sony Pictures expressed its interest to make the film.

Genndy Tartakovsky said of the &quot;Samurai Jack&quot; movie in a 2012 interview with &quot;IGN&quot;:
Tartakovsky said the loss of Mako Iwamatsu (Aku&#x27;s voice actor) would also need to be addressed. The feature film project never materialized, and eventually, the series concluded with a fifth television season.

=== Revival ===

&quot;Samurai Jack&quot; returned to television over twelve years after its fourth season concluded, with the first episode of its fifth season airing on Adult Swim on March 11, 2017. Produced at Cartoon Network Studios and Williams Street with Tartakovsky as executive producer, the fifth and final season features more mature elements and a cohesive narrative that concludes Jack&#x27;s journey. The story takes place fifty years after Jack was cast into the future. In despair from the years of fighting Aku and from Aku&#x27;s destruction of the remaining time portals, Jack—who has not aged as a side effect of the time travel—is haunted by warped visions of himself, his family, and an enigmatic, deathly warrior on horseback. Phil LaMarr reprises his role as Jack; Greg Baldwin provides the voice of Aku. Mako, who voiced Aku in the show&#x27;s first four seasons, died ten years before the revival was produced; however, an archive recording of his voice is used for Aku&#x27;s past self in the series finale.

== Reception ==
=== Critical reception ===
&quot;Samurai Jack&quot; received generally positive reviews from critics following its 2001 Cartoon Network debut. Steven Linan of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; said of the 90-minute premiere movie, &quot;One can quibble with some of the dialogue, which sounds like something you&#x27;d hear in &quot;Karate Kid 2&quot; (&#x27;Let the sword guide you to your fate, but let your mind set free the path to your destiny&#x27;). Nonetheless, there is one highly unconventional aspect of the series which sets it apart from others—its willingness to go for extensive stretches in which there is no dialogue.&quot;

The premiere received high praise and four award nominations, and was released as a standalone VHS and DVD on March 19, 2002.

In 2004, British broadcaster Channel 4 ran a poll of the 100 greatest cartoons, in which &quot;Samurai Jack&quot; achieved the 42nd position. The show was ranked eleventh by &quot;IGN&quot; for its &quot;Top 25 Primetime Animated Series of All Time&quot; list in 2006. In its list ranking, &quot;IGN&quot; compared the series&#x27; writing style to Tartakovsky&#x27;s &quot;Star Wars: Clone Wars&quot;, stating, &quot;episodes have little or no dialogue, relying instead on action and strong visuals to tell the stories. Entertaining for adults, yet not too violent for kids.&quot; The review went on to say that the series&#x27; &quot;unique combination of cinematic and comic book styles appeals to all ages.&quot; &quot;IGN&quot; also ranked the show 43rd in its Top 100 Animated Series list in 2009, saying that its &quot;simple and colorful art style lends itself well to the cinematic scope and frenetic action sequences that fill each episode.&quot; &quot;IGN&quot;&#x27;s review also stated that the series&#x27; &quot;unique style and humor make the most out of the animation format, producing elaborate action sequences and bizarre situations that would be impossible to do in a live action film.&quot;

On review aggregator site Rotten Tomatoes, the series as a whole has received an approval rating of 93%. The first season received an approval rating of 80% while the fourth and fifth seasons received an approval rating of 100%. The fifth season&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;An increasing intensity and maturity are evident in &quot;Samurai Jack&quot;&#x27;s beautifully animated, action-packed, and overall compelling fifth season.&quot;

Matt Zoller Seitz, a film critic for &quot;RogerEbert.com&quot; and television critic for &quot;Vulture&quot;, considers &quot;Samurai Jack&quot;, along with Tartakovsky&#x27;s &quot;Star Wars: Clone Wars&quot;, to be a masterwork and one of the greatest American animated shows on television, mainly for its visual style. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; ranked &quot;Samurai Jack&quot; third in its list of &quot;10 Best Cartoon Network Shows&quot; in 2012.

&quot;Samurai Jack&quot; would later be included in Seitz and Alan Sepinwall&#x27;s 2016 book &quot;TV (The Book)&quot; as an honorable mention following the 100 greatest television series.

=== Accolades ===
== Other media ==
=== Board game ===
A year after the series was concluded, a board game adaptation covering all five seasons was released, titled &quot;Samurai Jack: Back to the Past&quot;. Players work together to complete tasks to help Jack return to the past while competing to earn honor for their actions.

=== Comics ===

In February 2013, IDW Publishing announced a partnership with Cartoon Network to produce comics based on its properties. &quot;Samurai Jack&quot; was one of the titles announced to be published. It was further announced at WonderCon 2013 that the first issue of &quot;Samurai Jack&quot; would debut in October 2013. The first comic in the series was released on October 23, 2013. The final issue came out in May 2015. On October 25, 2016, IDW re-released all of the issues in a compilation entitled &quot;Tales of a Wandering Warrior&quot;. Tartakovsky does not consider the comics part of the story of Jack.

Jack also appeared in multiple issues of DC Comics&#x27; anthology comic series &quot;Cartoon Network Action Pack&quot;, which ran from May 10, 2006, to March 14, 2012.

=== Home media ===
Like other previous Cartoon Network shows, &quot;Samurai Jack&quot; DVDs were released by Warner Home Video between 2002 and 2007. The DVDs include episode numbers in Roman numerals as they appear at the end of each episode but remain untitled. Season 1 was released on Netflix streaming service in 2013. &quot;Samurai Jack: The Complete Series&quot; was released on Blu-ray and Digital HD on October 17, 2017, and contains remastered versions of the first four seasons of the series, courtesy of ACMEworks Digital Film, Inc. The series is also available on HBO Max since May 27, 2020.

=== Video games ===
The &quot;Samurai Jack&quot; world has been seen in the video games &quot;Samurai Jack: The Amulet of Time&quot; for the Game Boy Advance in 2003 and &quot;Samurai Jack: The Shadow of Aku&quot; for the GameCube and PlayStation 2 in 2004. A third game, &quot;Samurai Jack: Battle Through Time&quot;, was released on August 21, 2020, for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, and Apple Arcade.

Elements of the &quot;Samurai Jack&quot; concept were reused in other Cartoon Network video games. The MMORPG &quot;FusionFall&quot; features Jack, the Scotsman, and Demongo as non-playable characters, while Aku is a Nano. The brawler game &quot;Cartoon Network: Punch Time Explosion&quot; for Nintendo 3DS, Wii, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360 features Jack and the Scotsman as playable characters while Aku is an assist character, a boss, and a playable character. The platform fighter &quot;MultiVersus&quot; features Jack as a playable character.

<doc id="452305" wikidata="Q2910881" url="?curid=452305" title="Memory corruption">
<text>Memory corruption occurs in a computer program when the contents of a memory location are modified due to programmatic behavior that exceeds the intention of the original programmer or program/language constructs; this is termed as violation of memory safety. The most likely causes of memory corruption are programming errors (software bugs). When the corrupted memory contents are used later in that program, it leads either to program crash or to strange and bizarre program behavior. Nearly 10% of application crashes on Windows systems are due to heap corruption.

Modern programming languages like C and C++ have powerful features of explicit memory management and pointer arithmetic. These features are designed for developing efficient applications and system software. However, using these features incorrectly may lead to memory corruption errors.

Memory corruption is one of the most intractable class of programming errors, for two reasons: 
#The source of the memory corruption and its manifestation may be far apart, making it hard to correlate the cause and the effect.
#Symptoms appear under unusual conditions, making it hard to consistently reproduce the error.

Memory corruption errors can be broadly classified into four categories:

#Using uninitialized memory: Contents of uninitialized memory are treated as garbage values. Using such values can lead to unpredictable program behavior.
#Using non-owned memory: It is common to use pointers to access and modify memory. If such a pointer is a null pointer, dangling pointer (pointing to memory that has already been freed), or to a memory location outside of current stack or heap bounds, it is referring to memory that is not then possessed by the program. Using such pointers is a serious programming flaw. Accessing such memory usually causes operating system exceptions, that most commonly lead to a program crash (unless suitable memory protection software is being used).
#Using memory beyond the memory that was allocated (buffer overflow): If an array is used in a loop, with incorrect terminating condition, memory beyond the array bounds may be accidentally manipulated. Buffer overflow is one of the most common programming flaws exploited by computer viruses, causing serious computer security issues (e.g. return-to-libc attack, stack-smashing protection) in widely used programs. In some cases programs can also incorrectly access the memory before the start of a buffer.
#Faulty heap memory management: Memory leaks and freeing non-heap or un-allocated memory are the most frequent errors caused by faulty heap memory management.

Many memory debuggers such as Purify, Valgrind, Insure++, Parasoft C/C++test, AddressSanitizer are available to detect memory corruption errors.

<text>DikuMUD is a multiplayer text-based role-playing game, which is a type of multi-user domain (MUD). It was written in 1990 and 1991 by Sebastian Hammer, Tom Madsen, Katja Nyboe, Michael Seifert, and Hans Henrik Stærfeldt at DIKU (&quot;Datalogisk Institut Københavns Universitet&quot;)—the department of computer science at the University of Copenhagen in Copenhagen, Denmark.

Commonly referred to as simply &quot;Diku&quot;, the game was greatly inspired by AberMUD, though Diku became one of the first multi-user games to become popular as a freely-available program for its gameplay and similarity to &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;. The gameplay style of the great preponderance of DikuMUDs is hack and slash, which is seen proudly as emblematic of what DikuMUD stands for.

Diku&#x27;s source code was first released in 1990.

== Development and history ==

DikuMUD was created by the University of Copenhagen&#x27;s Department of Computer Science among a group of student friends: Katja Nyboe, Tom Madsen, Hans Henrik Staerfeldt, Michael Seifert, and Sebastian Hammer. According to Richard Bartle, co-creator of the first MUD, DikuMUD&#x27;s developers sought to create a better version of AberMUD. Unlike TinyMUD and LPMUD, which encouraged live changes to the virtual world, DikuMUD hard-coded its virtual world.

The making of DikuMUD was first announced on Usenet by Hans Henrik Stærfeldt March 27, 1990. At the time Madsen, Hammer, and Stærfeldt were the only developers, joined by Michael Seifert in June 1990. Stærfeldt stated that their intention was to create a MUD that was less messy than AberMUD, less buggy than LPMud, and more like &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;. The first DikuMUD was in working development as early as October 1990 and officially opened publicly running at codice_1 on February 3, 1991.

A second DikuMUD appeared in January 1991, running at codice_2. In March 1991, the first public version of DikuMUD, known as Diku Gamma, became available at codice_3. Afterwards the DikuMUD at codice_4 was shut down and the game and development moved to codice_5.

Other Diku Gamma MUDs appeared in March 1991 running at codice_6, followed by a multiprocessor version running at codice_7. By early April 1991, there were DikuMUDs running at codice_8, codice_9, codice_10, and codice_11.

Diku Alfa was released in July 1991 and the DikuMUD team hereafter continued with the development of DikuII. That version was however never released to the public but continues to run today under the name of Valhalla MUD.

On June 21, 2020, Michael Seifert released DikuMUD III for HTML 5 with Websockets. This is now the last official release of DikuMUD.

== Legacy ==

As a result of its easily operable codebase, several major standalone MUD codebases were spun out using DikuMUD&#x27;s code, namely Circle, Silly, and Merc. In turn, Merc led to ROM (Rivers of MUD) and Envy), which each spawned their own codebases. One such derivative of DikuMUD and Merc was SMAUG (Simulated Medieval Adventure Multi-user Game).

It has been proposed by Raph Koster (lead designer of &quot;Ultima Online&quot; and chief creative officer of &quot;EverQuest II&quot;) that Diku has resulted in the greatest proliferation of gameworlds due to being the easiest to set up and use. He further pointed out that &quot;Diku codebases did eventually popularize many of the major developments in muds&quot;, and that the Diku gameplay provided inspiration for numerous MMORPGs, including &quot;EverQuest&quot;, &quot;World of Warcraft&quot; and &quot;Ultima Online&quot;.

There was a minor controversy in late 1999 and early 2000 regarding whether the commercial MMORPG &quot;EverQuest&quot;, developed by Verant Interactive, had derived its code from DikuMUD. It began at the Re:Game gaming conference in 1999, where the Director of Product Development for EverQuest, Bernard Yee, allegedly stated that &quot;EverQuest&quot; was &quot;based on Dikumud&quot;. He did not specify whether he meant the code itself was derived from DikuMUD, or if it just had a similar feeling. Some attendees had understood it to mean the former, given that the chief designer, Brad McQuaid was an avid player of SojournMUD and TorilMUD that was based on the Sequent DikuMUD derivative, and reported to that effect on Usenet. After the Diku group requested clarification, Verant issued a sworn statement on March 17, 2000 that EverQuest was not based on DikuMUD source code, and was built from the ground up. In response, the DikuMUD team publicly stated that they find no reason whatsoever to believe any of the rumors that &quot;EverQuest&quot; was derived from DikuMUD code.

<text>Varalaru: History Of Godfather, or simply known as Varalaru (), is a 2006 Indian Tamil-language action-drama film written and directed by K. S. Ravikumar, and produced by S. S. Chakravarthy under the banner NIC Arts. The film stars Ajith Kumar in the main triple lead role as a father and his two twin sons. Asin, Kanika, Ramesh Khanna, Suman Setty, Sujatha and M. S. Baskar play supporting roles. The film&#x27;s soundtrack and background score were composed by A. R. Rahman. The film ran for 215 days and became a blockbuster at the box office. Prior to its release, the film was known by the title &quot;Godfather&quot;, but following the Government of Tamil Nadu&#x27;s motion to exempt tax on films titled in Tamil, the title was changed to &quot;Varalaru&quot;.

After two years of production, the film was released on 20 October 2006 on the eve of Diwali, and emerged as the highest grosser of the year. The film has been remade in Kannada, titled &quot;Godfather&quot;, in Burmese as &quot;Nat Khat Mhar Tae Tite Pwal&quot;, and in Odia as &quot;Tu Mo Dehara Chhai&quot;.

==Plot==
Shivashankar, a crippled wheelchair-using multimillionaire, has a son Vishnu who is spoilt. To teach him responsibility, Shivashankar sends Vishnu to Thottapuram to help the poor. Vishnu does not want to go, but a local pizza restaurateur convinces him and his friends that the village is one big brothel. Thottapuram is a sacred village and the restaurateur had purposefully deceived Vishnu and his friends. Divya and her collegemates are also visiting the village for their social activity course to improve the villagers&#x27; health and hygiene. A large building is reserved for him and the girls are asked to stay in the poor families&#x27; houses.

Vishnu and his friends arrive and start to woo the girls, whom they mistake for Thottapuram&#x27;s prostitutes. When Divya discovers their plan, she and her friends decide to teach Vishnu and his friends a lesson.

Vishnu and his friends are wooed by Divya and the other girls. They are led to separate rooms where the girls inject a serum that makes them itch all over. They leave, screaming and scratching. Vishnu tells Divya to leave her profession and offers to save her honour by marrying her in the village temple the next day. Divya does not come, but Vishnu and his friends happen to see her leaving on a bus bearing the name of the girls&#x27; college, revealing that they have been duped. But, Divya is guilt ridden when she sees him holding a mangala sutra and realising he really got ready to marry her.

Depressed and feeling cheated, Vishnu returns home, where Shivashankar discovers that his son has fallen in love. Under his influence, Vishnu and Divya get engaged. Everything goes well until one night, Vishnu goes to Divya&#x27;s house in a drunken state after a party in the nightclub. Her family prevents him from talking to her. This eventually leads to a fight. Vishnu then goes to Divya&#x27;s cousin&#x27;s house to apologise for his behaviour, but suddenly attempts to rape her which horrifies Divya. Vishnu then tries to kill Shivashankar, but is stopped by Ko Thandam, Shivashankar&#x27;s P.A., who got stabbed by Vishnu. Disappointed with Vishnu&#x27;s behaviour, Shivashankar sends him to a psychiatrist.

It is then revealed that Jeeva, Vishnu&#x27;s younger twin, had taken over his identity, took money from the bank, got drunk, went to Divya&#x27;s place and attempted to rape her cousin. Jeeva hates Shivashankar for abandoning him and his mentally-challenged mother Gayathri. Later, Divya manages to sneak into Vishnu&#x27;s room in the hospital and believes that he is innocent. She leaves and shortly afterwards, Jeeva appears, smuggles Vishnu out of the hospital, takes over his identity and goes to kill Shivashankar. The father realises that it is not his son after he gets a call from Vishnu and gets out of his wheelchair to defend himself, much to Jeeva&#x27;s surprise. Vishnu arrives at the scene, surprised that his father is able to walk and demands an explanation. The film goes to a flashback.

Shivashankar was a Bharatanatyam dancer who behaved effeminately due to dancing and the upbringing by his mother, whom he loved dearly. His mother had arranged for Shivashankar to marry Gayathri, who was her friend&#x27;s daughter. He agreed but Gayathri rejected Shivashankar for being too effeminate and insulted him in front of the wedding guests. Unable to bear the embarrassment, Shivashankar&#x27;s mother died on the spot. Enraged, Shivashankar raped Gayathri, who became pregnant. The doctor refused to perform an abortion, leading to Vishnu&#x27;s birth. Shivashankar took Vishnu from Gayathri, saying that the child would be the only hope of his life. But, unknown to Shivashankar, right after he left Gayathri gave birth to the baby&#x27;s twin, Jeeva.

Jeeva now threatens to kill Shivashankar at Vishnu&#x27;s and Divya&#x27;s wedding. Shivashankar fights with Jeeva and attempts to stop him. Jeeva points a gun at Shivashankar and reveals that he is also Shivashankar&#x27;s son and the reason for why he came to kill Shivashankar. Jeeva&#x27;s grandmother also tells Shivashankar that he is also his son and that Gayathri actually became insane when baby Jeeva was about to get hit by a lorry. Jeeva realises his mistake. He wants Shivashankar to shoot him, but a police officer mistakenly thinks that Jeeva is pointing the gun at Shivashankar. He fires at Jeeva, but Shivashankar intervenes, gets shot in the attack and dies. Jeeva accepts Shivashankar&#x27;s apology and is then jailed.

Weeks later, Gayathri does not accept food from anyone, until Vishnu comes and dresses as Jeeva and feeds her. The film ends with Vishnu telling her that Shivashankar is the godfather of the family. During the credits, the film shows what really happened in the first half.

==Production==
As per director R. Sundarrajan, &quot;Varalaru&quot;&#x27;s original base story was scripted by him for Kamal Haasan under the Sivaji Productions banner. This did not happen, however, due to Kamal Haasan&#x27;s unwillingness to work with Sundarrajan as he did not like the script. He felt it would portray him as a womaniser.

In late 1999, K. S. Ravikumar narrated two scripts to Kamal Haasan. One was about a transgender incorporating three roles titled &quot;Madana&quot; and a comedy script &quot;Thenali&quot;. Kamal was impressed with both but turned the former offer down due to his conflicting schedule at the time. Rajinikanth had agreed to do the story titled &quot;Madana&quot; if Kamal opts out. Ravikumar was forced to pull out of a project titled &quot;Jaggubhai&quot; which he had written and begun directing and consequently signed on Ajith Kumar, who had just opted out of A. R. Murugadoss&#x27;s action film, &quot;Mirattal&quot;. Later, the project shifted to the hands of NIC Arts (from Sri Surya Movies) due to a higher budget. The filming of &quot;Godfather&quot; began in November 2004, with Ravikumar initially announcing a release date of April 2005. Asin was added to the film after Jyothika walked out of the project, while A. R. Rahman was signed on as music composer to the film to be produced by S. S. Chakravarthy. Early reports suggested that one of Ajith&#x27;s roles in the film would be an eunuch or a transgender, but his role turned out to be that of an effeminate classical dancer. Shooting progressed from November 2004 till the end of the year.

In January 2005, it was announced that the film was put on hold due to financial problems, initiating a long delay in the production of the film. The film also faced problems, after the government banned scenes involving excessive smoking in films. Furthermore, in mid-2005, Ajith fell out with the producer, who had made several films with him in the past and stated that the pair would never work together again. This had led to Ajith taking a forced sabbatical, with his market being at a low following the failure of his previous film &quot;Ji&quot;. Ravi Kumar tried to get in R. B. Choudary and his banner of Super Good Movies to finish the movie but to no avail.

Chakravarthy avoided trouble by claiming he would finish the film by 15 June 2005 and signed a contract in March with the Tamil Nadu Producers Committee, who wanted to resolve the problem. The film restarted in April 2005, with a 10-day shoot in Ooty including a song, with Ravikumar revealing that further shots would be filmed in Hyderabad, and then in Canada, and that the film would be ready for release by 22 July 2005. P. C. Sreeram opted out of the film after his dates clashed with his work in &quot;Kanda Naal Mudhal&quot; and was replaced by Priyan. Actress Meena, who was supposed to do play Gayatri, also opted out due a conflicting schedule. Devayani was also considered for the role but she refused as she did not want to scold Ajith and after unfruitful discussion with Simran, Kanika was signed. Problems arose in mid-2005, when Asin could not allot dates for the film due to her work in &quot;Ghajini&quot;, &quot;Majaa&quot; and &quot;Sivakasi&quot;. However, by 15 June, thirty five days&#x27; work was still required and Ajith was forced to leave the project to begin work on Bala&#x27;s &quot;Naan Kadavul&quot; as per the signed contract. Chakravarthy later reported Ajith for the delays and before further problems occurred, L. Suresh of Ananda Pictures, a leading Chennai based distributor, intervened and solved the existing problems by providing an interest-free loan. Subsequently, the film became trouble free but took more than a year to finish the remaining portions and only released in October 2006 as Ajith took priority in completing &quot;Paramasivan&quot; and &quot;Thirupathi&quot;, both also released in 2006. Meanwhile, the title &quot;Godfather&quot; was reverted to &quot;Varalaru&quot; (History) after the state government gave an order to grant entertainment tax exemption to movies titled in Tamil.

==Music==
The film&#x27;s soundtrack and background score were composed by A. R. Rahman, marking his fourth collaboration with Ravikumar after &quot;Muthu&quot; (1995), &quot;Padayappa&quot; (1999), &quot;Thenali&quot; (2000) and third with Ajith Kumar after &quot;Pavithra&quot; (1994) and &quot;Kandukondain Kandukondain&quot; (2000). He finished composing all the songs for the film by December 2004. The soundtrack features nine songs, with lyrics written by Vairamuthu. The song &quot;Ilamai&quot; features a remix version, and &quot;Innisai&quot; features a reprise and an extended version of the song which is used in the film. The album was released on 27 September 2006.

==Release==
&quot;Varalaru&quot; released on 20 October 2006, during the Diwali season alongside Silambarasan’s &quot;Vallavan&quot;, S. P. Jananathan’s &quot;E&quot;, Saran’s &quot;Vattaram&quot;, Perarasu’s &quot;Dharmapuri&quot; and Sarath Kumar&#x27;s &quot;Thalaimagan&quot;, and emerged as the biggest hit of the year. &quot;Varalaru&quot; opened in over 300 screens worldwide including 25 screens in Chennai district. It ran for 210 days, becoming the highest grossing Tamil film of 2006 and also went on to become Ajith Kumar&#x27;s biggest grosser and his best film to date until the release of his 2007 film, &quot;Billa&quot;.

The satellite rights of the film were sold to Raj TV.

== Reception ==
The critic from The Hindu gave a verdict that the film &quot;scores in pace and performance&quot; and mentioned that &quot;Ajith&#x27;s skills as a performer have been appreciably honed and efficiently used&quot; and that it is a &quot;milestone in Ajith&#x27;s cinema efforts, the film has the potential to propel its hero into a higher league in stardom&quot;, while describing Asin as &quot;lustrous and sails through her role smoothly&quot;, while Kanika &quot;gets more scope, which she makes good use of&quot;. Rediff.com also gave the film a positive review claiming that &quot;Varalaaru is undoubtedly the only must-watch release this Diwali. Watch it for a display of all the elements of Ajith&#x27;s versatility and range of emotions&quot;. &quot;Sify&quot; wrote &quot;Try and try till you exceed all limits, seems to be director K.S.Ravikumar’s mantra. His Varalaaru has a wafer-thin story and is tackily executed. Though the film offers little in the way of surprise or newness, what makes it watchable is Ajit and his triple role&quot;. Lajjavathi of &quot;Kalki&quot; praised the performance of Ajith in triple roles, Kanika&#x27;s acting and Rahman&#x27;s music but panned the placement of songs and was critical of certain scenes and concluded saying its definitely ascent to Ajith. Ajith subsequently won the Filmfare Award for Best Actor – Tamil for 2006 for his triple role performance.

==Remakes==
The movie was unofficially remade in 2015 in Burmese as &quot;Nat Khat Mhar Tae Tite Pwal&quot; and in Odia as &quot;Tu Mo Dehara Chhai&quot;.

In 2012, cinematographer Sethu Sriram opted to remake the film in Kannada under the original title, &quot;Godfather&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Son of Rev. Thomas Hewitt (died 1964), of Worthing, West Sussex, and Daffodil Anne (died 2007), née Thorne, Hewitt was educated at the independent school St John&#x27;s School in Leatherhead, Surrey and St John&#x27;s College, University of Durham where he reported for a live student programme on BBC Radio Durham entitled &quot;University Termtime&quot;.

His brother is Garth Hewitt, the singer-songwriter, Anglican priest and social justice advocate.

==Career==
Prior to his work at the BBC, Hewitt lived in Toronto and worked as a correspondent for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation.

Hewitt joined the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Panorama&quot; as a presenter in 1984 and was in East Berlin when the Berlin Wall came down. He conducted the first British television interview with Oliver North after the Iran Contra scandal, and later wrote a book about the hostage crisis in the Lebanon. While working at &quot;Panorama&quot;, Hewitt made &quot;The Case Of India One&quot; which led to an investigation into police corruption. He also made the film &quot;Escape From Tiananmen&quot;, which broke the story of Operation Yellow Bird - the underground network used to smuggle student leaders and others out of China.

He has been the BBC&#x27;s Washington Correspondent on several occasions, and has made three films about President Bill Clinton, including &quot;All The President&#x27;s Women&quot;, and &quot;The Shaming Of The President&quot;. In 2003 he was one of three reporters to use David Kelly as a source for the BBC story claiming that the British Government had &quot;sexed up&quot; a dossier describing Iraq&#x27;s weapons of mass destruction. He later gave evidence on the affair to the Hutton Inquiry.

In 2008 Hewitt covered the United States Presidential Election primaries and Democratic Nominee for President Barack Obama&#x27;s visit to the Middle East and Europe in the summer of 2008. Hewitt also covered Barack Obama&#x27;s campaign for President during the autumn of that year, broadcasting from Grant Park when Obama was elected the first African American President of the United States on Tuesday 4 November 2008 working with Senior Producer Ian Sherwood and Picture Correspondent Rob Magee He then also covered Obama&#x27;s Inauguration on 20 January 2009.

During the War in Georgia in August 2008 Hewitt, senior producer Ian Sherwood and picture correspondent Rob Magee came under fire from a Russian fighter plane whilst covering the War on the front line.

==Awards==

==Other work==
In 1997 Hewitt wrote and presented the BBC One tribute to Princess Diana and in 1998 made &quot;Charles: A Life in Waiting - a portrait of Prince Charles at 50&quot; for Panorama and the US Arts and Entertainment channel. He has also worked for the BBC&#x27;s Natural History Unit making two programmes about the &quot;Land Of The Tiger&quot;, and wrote and presented &quot;Another Silent Spring&quot; about the effect of pesticides on wildlife.

In 2004 he presented &quot;Crisis Command - Could you run the country?&quot; - a BBC TV show where three people are given the chance to take ministerial decisions in a real-time dramatisation of a potential national emergency (flooding, terrorist attack etc.). He has written &quot;A Soul on Ice&quot; - a book about his time as a journalist.

<doc id="452321" wikidata="Q7998044" url="?curid=452321" title="Wiarton Willie">
<text>Wiarton Willie is the name given to a Canadian groundhog who lives in the community of Wiarton in Bruce County, Ontario. Every February 2, on Groundhog Day, Willie takes part in the local &quot;Wiarton Willie Festival&quot;. His role is to predict whether there will be an early spring. Although the original Wiarton Willie died in 1999, the Wiarton Groundhog Day celebrations continue each year with a successor of the original Willie (except in 1999 and 2021 where, due to the previous Willies&#x27; deaths, no groundhog was used), and each successor is also referred to as Wiarton Willie.

Groundhog Day, featuring Wiarton Willie, is a popular annual festival in Wiarton and is similar to events in other locations in North America. A midwinter celebration involving an animal with predictive powers was an element of Celtic culture. The link between weather prediction and the day is said to have been inspired by an old Scottish couplet: &quot;If Candlemas Day is bright and clear/ There&#x27;ll be two winters in the year.&quot;

==History==
The story of Wiarton Willie dates back to 1956. A Wiarton resident named Mac McKenzie wanted to showcase his childhood home to his many friends, so he sent out invitations for a &quot;Groundhog Day&quot; gathering. One of these invitations fell into the hands of a &quot;Toronto Star&quot; reporter. The reporter travelled to Wiarton looking for the Groundhog Day event. None of the townspeople knew about a festival, but one suggested he check at the Arlington Hotel, the local watering hole. There the reporter found McKenzie and his friends partying and was invited to join them. The next day, the reporter lamented to McKenzie that he needed some kind of story to take back to justify his expenses. So McKenzie grabbed his wife&#x27;s fur hat, which had a large button on the front, went out to the parking lot, dug a burrow in the snow and pronounced a prognostication (which no one remembers). The picture of Mac and the hat ran in the February 3, 1956 edition of the Toronto Star. A year later, about 50 people arrived for the festival. Half were reporters from various media, including the CBC and Canadian Press. Seizing on the opportunity, McKenzie invented a festival that has been added to over the years.

Wiarton Willie himself is a more recent addition to the festivities. In the early years, prognostication was provided by the &quot;mythical&quot; trio of groundhogs Grundoon, Muldoon and Sand Dune. Willie appeared on the scene in the 1980s. Wiarton Willie&#x27;s predictive powers are attributed (by his followers) to his situation on the 45th parallel, exactly halfway between the Equator and the North Pole. He is claimed locally to be accurate in his prognostications around 90% of the time; scientists have estimated Willie&#x27;s accuracy at 25%.

===Death and successors===
The original Wiarton Willie lived to the advanced age of 22, and was found dead only two days before Groundhog Day in 1999. The organizers were unable to find a replacement, and instead marked Groundhog Day by revealing &quot;Willie&quot; in a coffin. He had been dressed in a tuxedo, had coins over his eyes, and a carrot between his paws. The real Willie had in fact decomposed, and the body in the coffin was that of an older, stuffed groundhog. The Associated Press was obliged to issue a retraction on its wires.

Wiarton Willie&#x27;s keepers groom understudies, nicknamed &quot;Wee Willie&quot; during the elder groundhog&#x27;s lifetime, to eventually replace the reigning Wiarton Willie when they die. Wiarton Willies have typically had lifespans longer than the 4–9 years of a typical groundhog, and thus other groundhogs may have served in the role unreported. Wiarton Willie II was reported as deceased on July 11, 2006, after fighting an infection for the previous month.

On September 15, 2017, Wiarton Willie III died at 13. Two-year-old Wee Willie became Wiarton Willie IV on September 30, 2017, coinciding with a memorial service for the old Willie. Wiarton Willie IV died in 2020, leading to the 2021 prediction being made without the presence of a groundhog. Wiarton Willie IV&#x27;s death was not publicly announced until November 2021. Wiarton Willie V was introduced at the 2022 Groundhog Day celebration; he is the first brown groundhog to assume the position.

===Death of cubs controversy===
In May 2003, two of Wiarton Willie II&#x27;s Wee Willies disappeared; three months later, they were found dead in the burrow where they resided with Willie. Because groundhogs are known to be territorial animals, Willie was suspected of killing the two, an allegation that was never proven. Francesca Dobbyn, who looked after the groundhogs, informed her immediate supervisor who chose not to inform the Wiarton city council of the incident, fearing bad publicity; the council agreed to allow Dobbyn to keep her job despite the scandal.

==Past predictions==
==Groundhog Day show== 
Groundhog Day in Wiarton is a major celebration, with dances, parades, ice hockey tournaments, curling bonspiels, pancake breakfasts, darts and snooker tournaments, sleigh rides, a Monte Carlo Night and a fish fry. Around 10,000 people are said to attend. It has been called &quot;one [of] the most popular events in Ontario&quot; and has twice been named &quot;the World&#x27;s Greatest Event&quot; by Seattle&#x27;s Festivals.com.

<text>Expository preaching, also known as expositional preaching, is a form of preaching that details the meaning of a particular text or passage of Scripture. It explains what the Bible means by what it says. Exegesis is technical and grammatical exposition, a careful drawing out of the exact meaning of a passage in its original context. While the term exposition could be used in connection with any verbal informative teaching on any subject, the term is also used in relation to Bible preaching and teaching. The practice originated from the Jewish tradition of the rabbi giving a &quot;Dvar Torah&quot;, explaining a passage from the Torah, during the prayer services. Expository preaching differs from topical preaching in that the former concentrates on a specific text and discusses topics covered therein; whereas, the latter concentrates on a specific topic and references texts covering the topic.

== General overview and background ==
Expository preaching is a term and technique that refers to the proclamation of the content of the Bible as it appears in the text, as opposed to an emphasis on application to the hearers. There are a number of other techniques for preaching, some of which are covered in this article including textual, topical, topical-expository, and lectionary. According to the proponents of expository preaching the weaknesses of the other forms generally center around their inability to strictly expose the original meaning of the text. There is of course overlap between all types as they share one text. The expository method of preaching is favored among those who believe that the Bible is the very word of God and thus worthy of being presented in its purest essence, rather than modifying the message to match the characteristics of the audience.

== Methods of exposition ==
There are three ways in which texts are selected for exposition:
*use of a lectionary (common in many mainline denominational churches),
*lectio continua (Latin meaning &quot;continuous reading&quot;), where each passage of the Bible is read consecutively on each successive Sunday, or
*letting the preacher or individual church decide which books or passages are examined (common in evangelical churches from both mainline denominations and independent churches).

== The lectionary method ==
A lectionary is a pre-arranged set of passages on which the preacher is to expound. The passages found in the lectionary are usually influenced by the church calendar, and are sometimes set by the particular denomination of the minister and church.
*The primary advantage of using a denominationally based lectionary is that the same themes and passages are expounded at the same time throughout that body of churches. Use of a lectionary also has the advantage of covering large sections of the Bible so that the congregation is exposed to them over a reasonable amount of time.
*One disadvantage of using lectionaries is that the church and preacher are somewhat constrained by the lectionary&#x27;s rules. Another disadvantage is that the set passages in the lectionary may not cover an entire book of the Bible, or may contain too much information for the preacher to cover in one sermon. Also, a lectionary produced by denominations may carry that denomination&#x27;s biases in presentation.
*As a way of steering a middle course, one that sees pedagogical value in retaining the liturgical year and yet promotes a broader exposure to Scripture, is Timothy Slemmons&#x27; proposal, Year D: A Quadrennial Supplement (2012), which urges &quot;greater attention to what we have heard&quot; (Heb 2:1–3) by means of applying what he calls &quot;the principle of canonical comprehensiveness.&quot; In short, lectionary design should be expanded so as to allow every text in the canon at least some representation in the reading cycle of the church, while respecting the preacher&#x27;s freedom of conscience to decide what texts will actually be read in any given service.

== Individual choice method ==
When the passages are determined by the preacher or the individual church, the preacher has the freedom to work out which passages are studied at particular times. In such a situation, the preacher will sometimes preach through an entire book of Scripture, which generally allows a far more detailed look at the text being studied. Under some circumstances, preachers may prefer to preach through whole books of the Bible systematically over a long period of time. For example, suppose a preacher decides to cover the book of I John. On the beginning week of the series, the preacher may explain and apply 1 John 1.1–4, then 1 John 1.5–7 the following week, then 1 John 1.8–10 after that, and would continue until all of 1 John is covered. Then another book of the Bible is examined, or else a specific topic is covered for a time (few if any churches use the expository method exclusively, even where it is predominant topical studies are used as either &quot;breaks&quot; between books or to cover a specific area of concern to the congregation).

*The key advantage of this system is that the preacher is forced to expound passages that may not be examined or applied normally under a topical series.
*The disadvantage of this system is that certain parts of the Bible (especially the Old Testament) may be overlooked. The preacher is also able to ignore those parts of the Bible that might appear to contradict his selected text or his sermon&#x27;s points.

Other preachers may preach from isolated textsfrom Genesis 1:3 one week, and Isaiah 5:12 the next. Expository preaching does not always have to mean preaching series of sermons on a similar theme or book of the Bible.

== Advantages and disadvantages ==
Some advantages of expository preaching are as follows: 1) The presentation of the entire content of an entire Bible passage is attempted regardless of the desires of the congregation. Hot topics and controversial topics may not be avoided; pandering is diminished. 2) The preacher is never lost for a sermon subject. 3) The preacher is not left to guess the needs of his flock and to present appropriate topics, since the preacher believes that God&#x27;s word has God&#x27;s comprehensive diet for his sheep.

Some disadvantages of expository preaching are as follows: 1) The truths in a particular Bible passage may not be those most needed by a particular audience at their point of life. 2) The topic presented may lack the unity afforded by the topical method. 3) By limiting the message to a certain passage, the presentation of topics in their fullness may be neglected. Therefore, in order to properly address the context and content at hand in a given passage, the preacher may become topical by concentrating on the topic at hand, and integrating other supporting passages. 

W. A. Criswell covered the entire Bible over a 17-year period as pastor of the First Baptist Church of Dallas, Texas. John MacArthur (pastor of Grace Community Church in Sun Valley, CA) spent nearly a decade in the book of Luke alone. J. Vernon McGee was a radio preacher that preached through the entire Bible in five year cycles.

== Prominent expository preachers ==
Expository preaching took on new life in the Reformation when Ulrich Zwingli began his continuous exposition of the Gospel of Matthew on January 1, 1519 in Zürich. Other Reformers, like Zwingli&#x27;s friend Johannes Oecolampadius, followed suit. According to Hughes Oliphant Old, Oecolampadius&#x27; translations of the sermons of John Chrysostom, one of many church fathers who also practiced expository preaching, inspired him to return to this classic form, and with his own exposition of 1 John in 1523, the pattern for preaching in Basel, one that would be formalized in 1529, was set. Though both Oecolampadius and Zwingli died in 1531, the expository form of preaching they (and other Swiss Reformers, like Wolfgang Capito and Martin Bucer) established would be the form inherited, and some would say perfected, by John Calvin himself, who began to draft his Institutes of the Christian Religion in Basel in 1535, where every preacher in every pulpit was now devoted to continuous reading and preaching through books of the Bible.

Zwingli was succeeded in Zürich by Heinrich Bullinger, Oecolampadius by Oswald Myconius in Basel, while John Knox would take the form of exposition he learned from Calvin in Geneva back to Scotland. Translations of Calvin&#x27;s expository sermons would inspire generations of Reformed Christians in England and the Netherlands, Puritans on both sides of the Atlantic, and the preachers of the Great Awakening. 

Many famous evangelical preachers in the modern era have likewise used systematic exposition.

J. Vernon McGee of the &quot;Through the Bible&quot; radio program may be the best exemplar of the purely expository method of preaching in modern American times. He preached more than one 5-year cycle through the entire Bible.

Haddon Robinson, teacher on the long-running &quot;Discover the Word&quot; radio program. Among the seven books he authored is &quot;Biblical Preaching: the development and delivery of expository messages&quot;, for the study of expository preaching by seminarians.

Reputed to be a great evangelical preacher of the 20th century, Martyn Lloyd-Jones was the minister of Westminster Chapel in London from 1939 to 1968. His series on Romans took years to complete as he worked through the book almost a verse at a time.

Other famous expository preachers include Charles Spurgeon, John Stott, and Dick Lucas from England, William Still from Scotland, Phillip Jensen and David Cook from Australia, and Stephen F. Olford, and Fred Craddock from the United States.

John MacArthur is probably the best known expository preacher in America, and is a proponent of the expository method of preaching (and an outspoken opponent of the topical method as used almost exclusively by some churches). In addition, the Calvary Chapel group of churches, headed by Chuck Smith, include the regular use of expository preaching as one of their distinctives.

Many such prominent preachers in the second half of the twentieth century have put on record that to a lesser or greater extent they were persuaded of the importance of systematic exposition as a result of reading the works of A.W. Pink.

== Relative importance of expository preaching ==
There has been some discussion among preachers of the importance of expository preaching. Some churches give Scripture the dominant position over all other sources of religious understanding. This is most common in fundamentalist and evangelical denominations that take the position that the Bible is God&#x27;s inerrant word, and contains sufficient information for the Christian to understand their faith and how they should live their lives. In historical theology, these churches may adhere to the Reformation teaching of Sola Scriptura which is present in the statements of faith of a number of mainline denominations (e.g., chapter 1 of The Westminster Confession of Faith).

In practice, many Evangelical and Fundamentalist churches are not regularly exposed to Expository preaching from the pulpit. Despite this, expositions of scripture are more likely to occur in these churches than in non-evangelical ones. The exposition is unlikely to be influenced by material from outside the Bible (though such material may be mentioned in the sermon, for example the writings of a commentator on the passage).

However, in churches that elevate church tradition, individual experience, and/or human reason to a level on par with Scripture, expository preaching (if used) will include reconciliation of the Biblical text to other sources:

*Congregations with a strong view of church tradition or church authority (common in churches with a strong hierarchical structure) will want to know how their denomination has traditionally interpreted the passage.
*Congregations with a strong belief in personal experience (common in the charismatic and Pentecostal circles) will want to understand how the passage relates to their experiences.
*Congregations with a strong belief in human reason (common in churches which reject the view of Biblical inerrancy) will want to know what modern research has to say regarding the authenticity of the passage.

Regardless of these differences of emphasis, however, most preachers and congregations would agree that preaching must be honouring to God rather than to human beings. In practice, this means that the preacher as expositor should be concerned with speaking about what God sees as important. This will be of little use, however, if it does not connect to what the people in the congregation see as important – even if it only does so by seeking to upset their priorities. But the principle must be that when a church is exposed to expository preaching, they are being enabled to hear God speak rather than being told what they think they need to hear.

== Scriptural basis for exposition ==
For those who believe that the dominant source of Christian understanding is the Bible, it may seem obvious that expository preaching should be essential (though this is not the case with the seeker movement). Nonetheless the logic of their position demands that preaching itself should have a scriptural warrant.

The biblical basis for expository preaching can be found in many places in the Bible. 2 Timothy 3:16–17 is perhaps the most important, for it states that Scripture is breathed out by God, which means that the Bible is actually God&#x27;s words. The phrase breathed out is also a link to the Holy Spirit, which shows a link between the work of God&#x27;s Spirit, and the work of God&#x27;s Word. The verse also goes on to explain that Scripture is profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness. This shows that the Bible is not theoretical, but practical in its application. Finally, it states that the man of God may be competent, equipped for every good work. This has been claimed to show the sufficiency of scripture – that it is all that a Christian needs to understand his faith and how to live his life.

Another primary passage of Scripture that expositors point to is 2 Timothy 4:1–2. In this passage, Paul commands the young pastor Timothy to &quot;preach the Word.&quot; These three simple words in their context are a strong argument for the necessity of expository preaching. The word for &quot;preach&quot; is a word meaning to herald. Here the preacher is commanded to be a herald, someone who communicates a message not their own. The content of the heralding that they are to do is &quot;the Word.&quot; The task of the preacher, therefore, is to communicate the Word of God. This passage is a central argument for the biblical mandate for expository preaching.

Another important verse is Ephesians 6:17, which states that the Sword of the Spirit is the Word of God. This indicates again the link between the work of the Holy Spirit and the work of God&#x27;s word. It shows that when the word of God is read, examined and applied, there also works the Holy Spirit.

A third important verse is found in Hebrews 4:12, which says that The word of God is living and active, sharper than any double edged sword, piercing to the division of soul and spirit, of joints and of marrow, and discerning the thoughts and intentions of the heart. This second picture of God&#x27;s word as a deadly sword is deliberate, not because of the violence it implies, but because of the change it can bring to those who listen to God&#x27;s word. Here also the word of God is almost given a personality of its own – which implies, again, the hidden work of the Holy Spirit as it works with the word of God to change people&#x27;s lives.

== Movements that promote expository preaching ==

<text>GuRoo is a humanoid robot developed at the Mobile Robotics Laboratory in the School of Information Technology and Electrical Engineering at the University of Queensland. The design of the GuRoo is based on the human form and it is kept as anthropomorphic as possible. GuRoo is completely autonomous. It is used for research in different areas including dynamic stability, human-robot interaction and machine learning. GuRoo competes in the annual RoboCup. The goal of this competition is to foster the development of robotics through an annual soccer competition. It is the dream of the RoboCup federation to develop a team of fully autonomous humanoid robots, to play against and beat the human team that wins the World Cup in the year 2050.

== Specifications ==
Mechanical

GuRoo was designed with the proportions of a child of approximately six years of age. The robot is able to interface with typical human environments such as bench tops and door handles. The mechanical design began in 2001 as an undergraduate thesis project. SolidEdge a solid modeling package was used to draft all sections of the robot under construction, it took physical form one year later. The majority of the structure is made of 3mm aluminium plate and angle sections. The structure is heavily milled to reduce weight and improve airflow over the motors and power electronics.

Electro Mechanical

In an effort to mimic the human body, the GuRoo has been built with 23 degrees of freedom. The actuators chosen tended towards a high torque/low speed combination to suit the anthropomorphic nature of human locomotion. In addition, no joint is required to move through more than one complete revolution. The GuRoo stands 1.2 m tall and weighs 38 kg with batteries.

The high power necessary for the lower limbs and spine was realised with brushed DC motors, for cost reasons and ease of implementation, all lower joints use the same motor/ gearhead combination. The Maxon RE 32 series motor wound for a nominal 32V in combinations with a ceramic 156:1, 72% efficient, planetary gearhead is used. The maximum continuous output torque available is 10Nm with maximum speed of 5.3 rad/s at 2 amps of current consumption. Maximum intermittently permissible torque available is 22.5Nm at 4a. The length of the motors dictated the width of GuRoo&#x27;s legs. The high-powered motors made up 33% of the total weight of the robot.

Low power, low weight, and ease of controllability were the factors in choosing the actuators for the upper limbs. The RC servo motors used are Hi-Tech HS705-MG, capable of 1.4Nm output torque at speeds of 5.2 rad/s at 5V. Intrinsic metal gear boxes allow a relatively large output torque from a small package. Each servo weights 0.125 kg. Each motor has an internal close loop control systems but does not provide feedback to the main GuRoo controller. Digital servo motors, providing additional extra torque and accuracy, are being implemented in the head and neck.

If the robot is un-powered and lifted off the ground, the legs will naturally swing together as the centre of mass of the leg is outside of the hip joint. Additional torsion springs with a spring constant 1Nm/degree are located in parallel with the hip roll actuators to prevent this from occurring. The springs are set such that when un-powered, the legs of the robot hang straight down. The additional torque from the spring also alleviates the stress on the hip roll motor during the single support phase of a typical walking gait.

As might be expected, GuRoo can only approximate many human movements. One of the obvious is the crudely copied flexible spine. A human spine has 24 vertebrae distributed along the entire length that enables flexible motion, as opposed to the GuRoo, who has only three orthogonal actuators. Ball joints are also present in human hips and shoulders and allow high mobility actuated form a small volume. Due to the nature of the actuators used, ball joints were difficult to implement. Instead, multiple degrees of freedom have been achieved with small sequential links. All degrees of freedom are orthogonal when the robot is in a standing position.

==Name&#x27;s origin==
It is a tradition of all &quot;University of Queensland&quot; robotic soccer team to suffix -roo on their name, over the years there have been RoboRoos, ViperRoos and CrocaRoos. GuRoo stands for &quot;Grossly Underfunded Roo&quot; a reference to the small budget of the project.

<doc id="452328" wikidata="Q8019721" url="?curid=452328" title="William Vesey-FitzGerald, 2nd Baron FitzGerald and Vesey">
<text>William Vesey-FitzGerald, 2nd Baron FitzGerald and Vesey, (24 July 1783 – 11 May 1843) was an Anglo-Irish statesman. A Tory, he served in the governments of Lord Wellington and Robert Peel, but is best known for his defeat in the 1828 Clare by-election, hastening Catholic Emancipation across Britain and Ireland.

==Background and education==
FitzGerald was the elder son of James FitzGerald and Catherine, 1st Baroness FitzGerald and Vesey, daughter of Reverend Henry Vesey. He was educated at Christ Church, Oxford. Through his father he was of both Old English and Gaelic Irish descent.

==Political career==
FitzGerald first entered parliament in 1808 as the member for Ennis (succeeding his father), a seat he held until October 1812, when he was replaced by his father, and again between January 1813 and 1818. He was implicated in the scandal involving the Duke of York and his mistress Mary Anne Clarke, but after bringing valuable evidence of the case to the courts he was rewarded when he was appointed a Lord of the Irish Treasury and sworn of the Irish Privy Council in 1810. In 1812 he was admitted to the British Privy Council and made a Lord of the Treasury in England, Chancellor of the Irish Exchequer and First Lord of the Irish Treasury. He held the Irish offices until they were merged with the English treasury in 1816. In 1820 FitzGerald was returned to Parliament for Clare, which constituency he represented until 1828. In 1820 he was appointed Ambassador to Sweden. He tried to make the Swedish King, Charles XIV John, repay the large sums of money given to him during the Napoleonic Wars, but this was to no avail and he returned to Britain in 1823. He served as Paymaster of the Forces under successively Lord Liverpool, George Canning and Lord Goderich between 1826 and 1828.

In 1828 the Duke of Wellington appointed him President of the Board of Trade and Treasurer of the Navy. This required him to contest the Clare constituency once again, but he was defeated. The election was noteworthy in terms of Irish history because it led directly to Catholic Emancipation spearheaded by his successor, Daniel O&#x27;Connell as a result of his win. However, FitzGerald managed to get elected for Newport in 1829, and served as President of the Board of Trade and Treasurer of the Navy until February 1830, when he resigned. He briefly represented Lostwithiel in 1830 and then Ennis from 1831 until 1835.

FitzGerald succeeded his mother as second Baron FitzGerald and Vesey in 1832. As this was an Irish peerage it did not entitle him to a seat in the House of Lords. However, in 1835 he was created Baron FitzGerald, of Desmond and of Clan Gibbon in the County of Cork, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom, and was able to take a seat in the House of Lords. He again held office as President of the Board of Control under Sir Robert Peel between 1841 and 1843. Apart from his political career FitzGerald was Lord Lieutenant of County Clare from 1831 to 1843, a trustee of the British Museum, President of the Institute of Irish Architects and a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries.

==Personal life==
Lord FitzGerald and Vesey died in May 1843, aged 59. He was unmarried and on his death the barony of 1835 became extinct. He was succeeded in the Irish title by his younger brother, Henry. Lord FitzGerald and Vesey&#x27;s illegitimate son Sir William Vesey-FitzGerald became a successful Conservative politician.

<text>Goat Fell (Scottish Gaelic: &quot;Gaoitbheinn&quot;) is the highest point on the Isle of Arran. At 874 metres (2,867 ft), it is one of four Corbetts on the island. The mountain, along with nearby Brodick Castle, is now owned by the National Trust for Scotland.

==Ascent==
Due to the popularity of &quot;Scotland in miniature&quot; (Arran), Goat Fell is a very popular peak and there are many possible routes of ascent, some of which may be combined with visits to the summits of other nearby peaks. The most commonly used route, a constructed path of just over 3 miles (5 km) in length, starts from near Brodick Castle in Cladach. Initially the path leads up through the forested grounds of the castle, passing many rhododendron bushes. At just under 1,000 ft (300 m) above sea level the path leaves the forestry, and the route continues through bare moorland, reaching the summit by way of the east ridge of the mountain. There is a viewpoint table at the summit: on a clear day Northern Ireland may be seen.

An alternative shorter and steeper route comes up from the village of Corrie. This route joins the main path on the east ridge. Goat Fell may also be climbed from the north, where it is linked by a ridge to the subsidiary top of North Goatfell, a point from which three ridges radiate. In addition to the ridge leading south to the main summit, there is a ridge heading northeast, providing some very easy scrambling as it passes over Cìoch na h-Òighe (the &quot;Young Maiden&#x27;s Breast&quot;). Finally, the western ridge drops down to a bealach known as The Saddle, before climbing again towards the summit of Cìr Mhòr. The right-of-way between Glen Rosa and Glen Sannox passes over The Saddle.

The mountain was the scene of the death of English tourist Edwin Rose who was murdered by John Watson Laurie in 1889 on the mountain. Laurie was sentenced to death, later commuted to a life sentence and spent the rest of his life in prison.

A belief is spreading in conquered China that the government has lost the Mandate of Heaven. Han Tzu meets up with Mazer Rackham, who passes him a blow dart pen, calling it the &quot;Mandate of Heaven&quot;. Han Tzu confronts the emperor, Snow Tiger, who is shot and killed by a guard, allowing Han Tzu to overthrow the Chinese government and install himself as the new emperor. Meanwhile, Peter Wiggin, Hegemon of Earth, along with Petra Arkanian, goes to visit Alai, Caliph of the Muslim League. The two help Alai realize that he is little more than a glorified prisoner, and that others have been ruling Islam in his stead. After uncovering a conspiracy against him, Alai resolves to take firmer control of his nation and guarantee the human rights of his subjugated peoples.

The rest of the book deals with Peter Wiggin working to create a world government free of war through his Free People of Earth (FPE) alliance. Caliph Alai of the Muslim League and Virlomi, now the virtual goddess of India, oppose his efforts. Against this backdrop of world political machinations by the former Battle School children is the extremely personal story of Julian (Bean) Delphiki. Anton&#x27;s Key is making him grow at an astounding rate and he has only a short time before his body will become too large for his heart to support. He searches frantically for his and Petra&#x27;s missing children. Graff assists them in locating the surrogate mothers of their children. While Bean and Petra wait for news, Graff extends invitations to the other members of Ender&#x27;s Jeesh to leave Earth and rule colonies, where they can conquer to their heart&#x27;s content without causing needless wars between themselves, and instructs Bean to support Peter in forming the FPE.

The FPE alliance begins with only twenty-two countries, among them Brazil, Rwanda, and the Netherlands. The first test of the FPE comes when they recognize the sovereignty and nationhood of the Nubian, Quechua, and Aymara peoples, ethnic minorities that are politically part of other nations. Peru and Sudan send troops against these &quot;rebel&quot; strongholds, but Peter defends them using Bean and Suriyawong, leading Rwandan and Thai troops, to show that war against one FPE member is war against all of them. The FPE&#x27;s victories, and especially their militarily brilliant commanders, bolster support for the FPE, and nations begin to freely vote on whether to join it.

Meanwhile, Bean suspects that Peter is embezzling Ender&#x27;s military pension to fund the FPE, so he requests that Ender&#x27;s funds be placed under the control of an autonomous computer. Colonel Graff has the Mind Game reprogrammed to accurately predict financial markets and turns it loose over the ansible network, where it continues to invest Ender&#x27;s pension and, as revealed later in the Enderverse chronology, eventually evolves into the artificial intelligence known as Jane. The Mind Game also speeds the search for Bean&#x27;s missing children, allowing the International Fleet to find eight of them; two of whom have Anton&#x27;s Key turned, as does the baby Petra is carrying. The ninth remains undetected, as Achilles had it implanted into a woman named Randi, brainwashed to think that it is the baby of Achilles, whom she worships as a hero assassinated by foul enemies. To avoid persecution, Randi determines to leave Earth and live in a colony, where she can raise her child (who appears to have Anton&#x27;s Key turned, as the baby is born prematurely) to follow in Achilles&#x27; footsteps. Her story, and that of her child Randall Firth, is concluded in Card&#x27;s later novel &quot;Ender in Exile&quot;.

Virlomi attempts to guarantee India&#x27;s freedom via dynastic marriage, turning down an offer from Han Tzu to instead attempt to seduce Peter Wiggin. When Peter turns her down, she turns to Alai whom she finds easier to outmaneuver. Their new marriage is fraught with tension and Alai discovers that, despite his wife&#x27;s status as an infidel and a woman, the more hotheaded members of his empire actually prefer her aggressive and expansionist policies. Virlomi then declares war on China, setting off all manner of plots: Muslim hardliners attempt to assassinate Alai; Russia invades China and eastern Europe using &quot;contingency&quot; plans drawn up by a horrified Vlad; and Fly Molo of the Philippines is instructed to invade Taiwan, his nation suicidally confident in their Jeesh member. In these different ways, all the Battle School grads are convinced to take up Graff&#x27;s offer to travel the stars, realizing that their presence on Earth guarantees continued and wasteful war. Even Virlomi agrees, after Suri manages to snap her out of her growing .

With the secret help of Mazer Rackham, Bean divorces Petra for her own sake, takes the three found children with Anton&#x27;s Key, and flies away on a starship provided by the Fleet to achieve relativistic speeds and thereby stay alive long enough for medical researchers to find a cure. Bean&#x27;s departure breaks Petra&#x27;s heart, but she becomes Peter&#x27;s military commander, eventually marrying and having five children with him, though she never stops loving Bean. By the end of the novel, all of the world&#x27;s nations, except the United States, have joined the FPE. Peter reconciles with Ender via ansible, giving the &quot;Speaker for the Dead&quot; all he needs to write &quot;The Hegemon&quot;, a deeply felt and truthful biography of his brother. Petra reads his biography at his grave, thinking of him as the man who truly changed her life. Still, Bean remains the one whom she loves and has changed her life the most.

<doc id="452334" wikidata="Q837587" url="?curid=452334" title="Gibson L-5">
<text>The Gibson L-5 is a hollow body guitar first produced in 1923 by the Gibson Guitar Corporation, then of Kalamazoo, Michigan. One of the first guitars to feature F-holes, the L-5 was designed under the direction of acoustical engineer and designer Lloyd Loar, and has been in production ever since. It was considered the premier guitar of the company during the big band era. It was originally offered as an acoustic instrument, with semi-acoustic models not made available until the 1940s.

==Design and construction==
The construction of the L-5 is similar in construction, carving, bracing and tap-tuning, to building a cello. This guitar as well as the cello are similarly designed in order to amplify and project the acoustic vibration of strings throughout carved and tuned woods, using f-holes as the projection points. From 1922 to 1934 the L-5 was produced with a 16&quot; lower bout width. In 1934 the lower bout was increased to 17&quot;; this width is still used today. Also released in 1934 was the larger 18&quot; archtop guitar named the &quot;L5 Super&quot;, which was later renamed the Gibson Super 400. These two highly ornate acoustic guitars are Gibson&#x27;s top-of-the-line carved archtop instruments. Since the 1930s there have been several other 17&quot; archtops designed by Gibson, including variations introduced to be more affordable, less ornate models.

=== The prewar years (1922–1940) ===
From its introduction in 1922–23 to the 1940s, the L-5 came in different configurations (all strictly acoustic):

* Type one 16&quot; - As it first appeared when originally introduced in Gibson&#x27;s price list (April 1923), the L-5 sported a 16&quot; body with a Cremona brown finish, birch or maple sides, a single-bound, 20-fret fingerboard with a pointed end, dot inlays, a slanted &quot;The Gibson&quot; script logo on the headstock, and silver-finish hardware. Most of these type-one L-5s also had a built-in Virzi Tone Producer; this was (essentially) an extra soundboard with an oval shape suspended within the body of the instrument. The primary outward distinguishing characteristic of these early Loar-era Gibsons is the unbound pickguard. 
* Type two 16&quot; - Between 1925 and 1929, the L-5 featured a 16&quot; body, maple back and sides, a triple-bound fingerboard, no Virzi Tone Producer. Towards the end of this period, the headstock logo could either be slanted or horizontal. The hardware was gold-finished and the pickguard bound. 
* Type three 16&quot; - Between 1929 and 1935, the last iteration of the 16&quot; L-5 had block abalone inlays on the fingerboard (which would henceforth become a signature feature of the model), and the headstock logo gradually transitioned to a horizontal &quot;Gibson&quot; script without the article &quot;The.&quot; Several specimens of this period also do away with the point at the end of the fingerboard, which is squared off instead. 
* The 17&quot; L-5 Advanced - Starting in 1935, the L-5 was produced with a 17&quot; body. In the first two years, the tailpiece was a slightly wider version of the previous iteration, adorned with the lettering &quot;L 5.&quot; By 1937, the now-iconic art deco gold-finished tailpiece with the silver central element had become the norm. Also, starting in 1936 the F holes were bound. The 17&quot; L-5 was also the first L-5 model to feature a natural, blonde finish, as well as a Venetian cutaway, as options. This model, more or less unvaried, also appears in the early postwar years (roughly to 1947).

=== The postwar years ===
When regular production resumed at Gibson after the war, the L-5 appeared more or less identical to the 17&quot; acoustic instrument produced at the end of the previous decade. Apart from the switch from the script to the &quot;block&quot; Gibson logo on the headstock, the most significant change in subsequent years was the introduction of an electric L-5. In 1951, the 17&quot; L-5 was outfitted with a pair of P-90 pickups to keep up with the musical requirements of the time. The designation of this version of the instrument was L-5 CES—standing for Cutaway Electric Spanish. This instrument could be had in the standard sunburst finish or with the blonde, natural finish. However, the all-acoustic version of the L-5 was not replaced by this new introduction, and remained available as a parallel option. Starting in 1958, the P-90 pickups were replaced by humbuckers.

=== The late 1950s to today ===
Today the standard model of the L-5 is the L-5 CES, the electric version designed to minimize the feedback that well-carved archtops are prone to when amplified.

Gibson periodically issues variations of the L-5 built in limited editions of varying size. One example is the thin-bodied &quot;L-5 CT&quot; (cutaway thin), which has the same overall specifications, with the exception of the body thickness. The CT model was first constructed for George Gobel, who wanted a less bulky guitar.

Another variation of the L-5 is the Wes Montgomery model, named for the popular 1950s and 1960s jazz guitarist. The Wes Montgomery model has a single &quot;Classic 57&quot; pickup in the neck position, and a parallel bracing supporting the top. Parallel bracing is the standard and more popular bracing is the slightly brighter sounding &quot;parallel bracing&quot;, which is considered to project the sound farther than an X-braced archtop.

The 1955 Gibson Byrdland model is yet another L-5 variation, designed by Billy Byrd and Hank Garland. The Byrdland guitar has a thin L-5-style body and originally came with a narrower neck that featured a relatively short 23 1/2-inch scale length to aid in playing difficult chords.

Several different L-5 hollow-body models have appeared over the years, including the L-5 Signature and the L-5 Studio. The ES-5 was the first three pickup factory guitar model built. The ES-5 was inspired by the L-5, introduced in 1949, later modified as the Gibson ES-5 Switchmaster. Unlike the L-5 which had a solid carved spruce top and solid maple sides and back, the ES-5 body was constructed of pressed laminated wood to prevent feedback, Gibson also felt that the best tonewoods were not necessary in an electric model and pressed laminated wood would produce a more affordable to manufacture model and thus could land in many more players hands than the carved instruments.

The L-5 CES was a direct electric version of the L-5, introduced in 1951. These originally used P-90 pickups, but used humbucker pickups from 1958 on. From 1961 through 1969, most production L-5CES guitars featured a &quot;florentine&quot; (sharp) cutaway, replacing the &quot;venetian&quot; (rounded) cutaway design.

==Notable performers==
The L-5 has for multiple generations been seen in the hands of many performers. Many RCA recordings from the fifties feature the guitar prominently, including Elvis Presley&#x27;s records, which feature the sound of Scotty Moore&#x27;s L-5. Nashville session guitarist Hank Garland, who also recorded acclaimed jazz albums before his near-fatal automobile accident, frequently played an L-5, as did jazz guitarist Wes Montgomery. A little known fact – the L-5 is the guitar that Groucho Marx kept by his side throughout his private life. Though not widely known, Marx played the guitar well. Contemporary guitarists who play and have played an L-5 on notable recordings as well as live include Tuck Andress from Tuck and Patti, Melvin Sparks, Lee Ritenour, George Van Eps, and Howard Roberts (who used his L-5 to record the opening bars of the iconic theme for The Twilight Zone). John Mayer uses one on his 2008 live CD/DVD &quot;Where the Light Is&quot;. Eric Clapton used an L-5 to record &quot;Reptile&quot; (2001) and also used one on his 2002 live CD/DVD &quot;One More Car, One More Rider&quot; during the songs &quot;Reptile&quot;, and &quot;Somewhere Over the Rainbow&quot;.

Early players of the L-5 include Eddie Lang, and Maybelle Carter from The Carter Family, who played her now-famous 1928 model for the majority of her career. Maybelle Carter&#x27;s L-5 is now kept in the Country Music Hall of Fame in Nashville, Tennessee. Django Reinhardt played an L-5 fitted with a DeArmond pickup during his tour with Duke Ellington November 1946. Groucho Marx is seen playing his L-5 in the 1932 Marx Brothers film &quot;Horse Feathers&quot;. Clint Eastwood featured an L-5 in the 1982 movie &quot;Honkytonk Man&quot;. This had a cutaway (introduced in 1939), unlikely in a story set during the Great Depression.

Comedian and singer George Gobel had a special version of the Gibson L-5 archtop guitar custom designed and gifted to him by his friend Milton Berle in 1958, the &quot;L-5CT&quot; (cutaway, thin), featuring diminished dimensions of neck scale (24 3/4&quot;) and body depth (2 3/8&quot;), befitting his own small stature, and a cherry red finish (for optimal appearance on Gobel&#x27;s new color TV show). About 45 L-5CT&#x27;s were produced from 1958 to 1963, making them one of the rarest Gibson models. Most of these were acoustic guitars, although a few were shipped with pickups. The rarest L5 model was a close relative of the L-5CT. It was called the &quot;Crest&quot;*. It was conceived by Gibson employee Andy Nelson (who helped to design the L-5CT) in 1961. It featured the same thinline body of the L-5CT, but the new-for-1961 &quot;florentine&quot; cutaway shape, Super 400-style fretboard inlays, and a unique knight/shield crest design on the headstock. Only six Crests were produced (all in 1961), and no two were identical. Gibson produced another model called a &quot;Crest&quot; in 1969–70, but this was a different type of instrument, similar to an ES-330, but with a rosewood body and floating pickups.

In the 1970s, Gibson produced the L-5S, which was effectively a solid-body version of the L-5 archtop. It was used by Pat Martino, Paul Simon and, from 1973 to 1976, by Mark Farner of Grand Funk Railroad (he is seen with the guitar in cover photographs on the band&#x27;s 1975 live album &quot;Caught in the Act&quot;); and a custom-made single-pickup version was made for Ronnie Wood, who loaned it to Keith Richards for his 1988 tour with the X-Pensive Winos. A double cutaway version of the L-5 has recently been introduced to the market. The body depth has been reduced to 2 3/8&quot;. The upper cutaway is purely cosmetic, since the neck base or heel prevents higher access to the frets.

<text>Kuchipudi ( ) is one of the eight major Indian classical dances. It originates from a village named Kuchipudi in the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh. Kuchipudi is a dance-drama performance, with its roots in the ancient Hindu Sanskrit text of Natya Shastra. It developed as a religious art linked to traveling bards, temples and spiritual beliefs, like all major classical dances of India.

Evidence of Kuchipudi&#x27;s existence in an older version is found in copper inscriptions of the 10th century, and by the 15th century in texts such as the &quot;Machupalli Kaifat&quot;. Kuchipudi tradition holds that Narahari Tirtha – a sanyassin of Dvaita Vedanta persuasion, and his disciple, an orphan named Siddhendra Yogi, founded and systematized the modern version of Kuchipudi in the 17th century. Kuchipudi largely developed as a Krishna-oriented Vaishnavism tradition, and it is known by the name of Bhagavata Mela in Thanjavur.

In the past, an all male troupe performed the traditional Kuchipudi. A dancer in a male role would be in &quot;Agnivastra&quot;, also known as , wear a &quot;dhoti&quot; (a single pleated piece of cloth hanging down from the waist). A dancer in a female role would wear a &quot;Sari&quot; with light makeup. The Kuchipudi performance usually begins with an invocation. Then, each costumed actor is introduced, their role stated, and they perform a short preliminary dance set to music (). Next, the performance presents pure dance (&quot;nritta&quot;). This is followed with by the expressive part of the performance (&quot;nritya&quot;), where rhythmic hand gestures help convey the story. Vocal and instrumental Carnatic music in the Telugu language accompanies the performance. The typical musical instruments in Kuchipudi are mridangam, cymbals, veena, flute and the tambura. The popularity of Kuchipudi has grown within India and it is performed worldwide.

== Nomenclature, orthography and etymology==
Kuchipudi is named after the village in Krishna district of Andhra Pradesh named Kuchipudi – shortened form of the full name Kuchelapuram or Kuchilapuri – where it developed. The name of the village, states Ragini Devi, is itself derived from Sanskrit &quot;Kusilava-puram&quot;, which means &quot;the village of actors&quot;. &quot;Kusilava&quot; is a term found in ancient Sanskrit texts and refers to &quot;traveling bard, dancer, newsmonger&quot;.

== History ==

Like other classical dance forms in India, Kuchipudi traces its roots to the Sanskrit Natya Shastra, a foundational treatise on the performing arts. Its first complete compilation is dated to between 200 BCE and 200 CE, but estimates vary between 500 BCE and 500 CE. The most studied version of the Natya Shastra text consists of about 6000 verses structured into 36 chapters. The text, states Natalia Lidova, describes the theory of Tāṇḍava dance (Shiva), the theory of rasa, of bhāva, expression, gestures, acting techniques, basic steps, standing postures – all of which are part of Indian classical dances. Dance and performance arts, states this ancient text, are a form of expression of spiritual ideas, virtues, and the essence of scriptures.

The dance-drama tradition in Andhra Pradesh is of ancient origins, and the region is mentioned in the &quot;Natya Shastra&quot;. Bharata Muni credits a graceful movement to the Andhra region and discusses it as &quot;Kaishiki vritti&quot;. The pre-2nd century CE text calls one raga &quot;Andhri&quot;, which is from Andhra. The Andhri, is related to &quot;Gandhari&quot; and &quot;Arsabhi&quot;, and is discussed in many other 1st millennium Sanskrit texts. Some, state Bruno Nettle and others, place the origins of Kuchipudi to 3rd-century BCE.

Dance-drama performance arts related to Shaivism, in Telugu-speaking parts of South India, are evidenced in 10th-century copper inscriptions, and these were called or . The medieval era dance-drama performance artists were Brahmins. This art was likely adopted by the musical and dancing Bhakti traditions of Vaishnavism which grew in the 2nd millennium, whose devotees were called in Andhra region and in Tamil region of south India. In Andhra, this performance art evolved into Kuchipudi, while in Tamil Nadu it became known as . According to Saskia Kersenboom, both the Telugu Kuchipudi and Tamil Bhagavata Mela are strongly related to the classical Hindu dance tradition of found in Karnataka, all three involve Carnatic music, but these dance-drama traditions have differences such as in costumes, structure, interpretation and creative innovations.

Kuchipudi traces its origins to its founder Narahari Tirtha, the disciple of Sri Ananda Tirtha a.k.a. Madhvacharya, when he was the high priest at his matha at Srikurmam and Simhachalam.
To implant bhakti among layman he is credited with organizing Bhagavata Melas throughout the nights and adapting many dance forms from the Srimad Bhagavatha Puranas. 
Vaishnavism received a big boost in the Kalinga regions of Andhra and Orissa due to the efforts of Narahari Tirtha, Sri Jagannatha Tirtha and his disciples, the message of Bhakti was percolated through the masses via Kuchpudi and The Bhagavata Melas of Sri Narahari Tirtha and his disciples.
According to Manohar Varadpande, the Kuchipudi dance emerged in the late 13th century, when Ganga rulers from Kalinga were patrons of performance arts based on the 12th-century Sanskrit scholar Jayadeva, particularly the Gita Govinda. This royal sponsorship, states Varadpande, encouraged many poets and dance-drama troupes to adopt Radha-Krishna themes into the then prevailing versions of classical Kuchipudi. These were regionally called Vaishnava &quot;Bhagavatulu&quot;.

The modern version of Kuchipudi is attributed to Tirtha Narayanayati, a 17th-century Telugu sanyasin of Advaita Vedanta persuasion and particularly his disciple, a Telugu Brahmin orphan named Sidhyendra Yogi. Tirtha Narayanayati authored &quot;Sri Krishna Leela Tarangini&quot; and introduced sequences of rhythmic dance syllables at the end of the cantos, he wrote this work as a libretto for a dance-drama. Narayanayati lived for a while in the Tanjore district and presented the dance-drama in the Tanjore temple.

Narayanayati&#x27;s disciple, Sidhyendra Yogi, followed up with another play, the &quot;Parijatapaharana&quot;, more commonly known as the &quot;Bhama Kalapam&quot;. When Sidhyendra Yogi finished the play, he had trouble finding suitable performers. So he went to Kuchelapuram, the village of his wife&#x27;s family and present-day Kuchipudi, where he enlisted a group of young Brahmin boys to perform the play. According to the tradition, Sidhyendra requested and the villagers agreed to perform the play once a year, and this came to be known as Kuchipudi.

=== Late medieval period ===
Kuchipudi enjoyed support from medieval era rulers. Copper inscriptions suggest that the dance-drama was seen by the royalty and was influential by 1502 and through the late 16th century. The court records of the Vijayanagara Empire – known for its patronage of the arts – indicate that drama-dance troupes of &quot;Bhagavatas&quot; from Kuchipudi village performed at the royal court. However, various historical inscriptions often indicate that this dance form can be tracked back to the first century BCE.

The region saw wars and political turmoil with Islamic invasions and the formation of Deccan Sultanates in the 16th century. With the fall of Vijayanagara Empire and the destruction of temples and Deccan cities by the Muslim army around 1565, musicians and dance-drama artists migrated south, and Tanjore kingdom records suggest some 500 such Kuchipudi artist families arrived from Andhra, were welcomed and granted land by the Hindu king Achyutappa Nayak, a settlement that grew to become modern Melattur near Tanjore (also called Thanjavur). Not everyone left the old Andhra village of Kuchipudi, and those remaining became the sole custodians of its tradition in Andhra.

Kuchipudi declined and was a dying art in 17th-century Andhra, but in 1678, the last Shia Muslim Sultan of Golkonda, Abul Hasan Tana Shah, saw a Kuchipudi performance and was so pleased that he granted the dancers lands around the Kuchipudi village, with the stipulation that they continue the dance-drama. The Shia Sultanate was overthrown in 1687 by the Sunni Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb. In order to regulate public and private morals, as well as end un-Islamic practices, Aurangzeb banned public performances of all music and dance arts, along with ordering the confiscation and destruction of musical instruments in Indian subcontinent under control of his Mughal Empire.

=== Colonial rule period ===

After the death of Aurangzeb in 1707, the Mughal Empire collapsed, Hindu rebellion sprouted in many parts of India, including the Deccan region. In the second half of the 18th century, during this period of political turmoil, the colonial Europeans arrived, the Madras Presidency was formed by the East India Company officials and became a part of the British Empire. Andhra was a part of the Madras Presidency. During the colonial era, Hindu arts and traditions such as dance-drama were ridiculed. Christian missionaries and British officials stereotyped and denigrated dancers, calling Indian classical dances as evidence of a tradition of &quot;harlots, debased erotic culture, slavery to idols and priests&quot;. Christian missionaries launched the &quot;anti-dance movement&quot; in 1892, to ban all such dance forms. The anti-dance camp accused the various classical Indian dance forms as a front for prostitution, while revivalists questioned the constructed histories by the colonial writers.

In 1910, the Madras Presidency of the British Empire altogether banned temple dancing. Kuchipudi, which was traditionally staged at night on a stage attached to a Hindu temple, was impacted and like all classical Indian dances declined during the colonial rule period.

After the ban, many Indians protested against the caricature and cultural discrimination, launching their efforts to preserve and reinvigorate their culture. Due to these efforts from 1920s onwards, the classical Indian dances witnessed a period of renaissance. Vedantam Lakshminarayana Sastri (1886–1956) was the influential figure who led the effort to save, reconstruct and revive Kuchipudi performance art. Sastri worked closely with other revivalists, between 1920 and 1950, particularly Balasaraswati and others determined to save and revive Bharatanatyam.

=== Modern period ===
The three influential figures in Kuchipudi, during the first half of twentieth century, were Vedantam Lakshminarayana Sastri, Vempati Venkatanarayana Sastri and Chinta Venkataramayya. Sastri focused on reviving and relaunching Kuchipudi after classical Hindu dances came under sustained ridicule and political degradation in the British Raj, while Venkataramayya was influential in productions for public performances and developing specialized forms of Yakshagana – another classical Indian dance, and Kuchipudi. Sastri is also remembered for encouraging and teaching Indian women to dance Kuchipudi as solo performers and in teams, as well as working with artists of other classical dances such as the Bharatanatyam that enabled the sharing and cross flow of ideas. Vempati Venkatanarayana Sastri was the guru of Sastri, taught him Kuchipudi, and was a key figure in helping preserve Kuchipudi. The historic All India Dance Seminar, organized by the national arts organization Sangeet Natak Akademi in 1958, thrust Kuchipudi to the national stage.

Some Western dancers joined the Indians in preserving dance. The American dancer Esther Sherman, for example, moved to India in 1930, learnt Indian classical dances, changed her name to Ragini Devi, and joined the movement to save and revive classical Indian dances. Her daughter Indrani Bajpai (Indrani Rahman) learnt and became a celebrated Kuchipudi dancer. The public performances of Kuchipudi by Indrani Rahman and Yamini Krishnamurti outside of Andhra region, created wider enthusiasm and more interest through new students and the expansion of Kuchipudi as a creative performance art both within India and internationally. The latter half of the twentieth century was dominated by the Kuchipudi school of Vempati Chinna Satyam, whose efforts to further codify the modern repertoire earned him multiple accolades, including the Padma Bhushan.

Some of the Indian movie actresses such as Hema Malini started their career as a Kuchipudi and Bharatanatyam dancer. Kuchipudi performances have now spread world-wide.

The largest group performance with a total of 6,117 dancers in Vijayawada got into the Guinness World Records

== Repertoire ==

Kuchipudi is a team performance, with roots in Hindu religious festivals. The drama-dance involves extensive stage movements and exacting footwork, wherein the underlying drama is mimed by expressive gestures of hand (mudras), eye and face movements. The expressive style is through a sign language that follows the classical pan-Indian Sanskrit texts such as &quot;Natya Shastra&quot;, &quot;Abhinaya Darpana&quot; and &quot;Nrityararnavali&quot;. The dance is accompanied with Carnatic music, while the recital is in Telugu language. Just like the Carnatic music style, Kuchipudi shares many postures and expressive gestures with Bharatanatyam, such as the &quot;Ardhamandali or Aramadi&quot;(half seating position or a partial squat, legs bent or knees flexed out). However, there are important differences, such as Bharatanatyam as a Hindu temple tradition trending towards geometric perfection and the spiritual, while Kuchipudi as a Hindu festival tradition trending towards more sensual supple and the folksy.

Traditionally the traveling dance troupe consisted entirely of men (often Brahmins), who moved from village to village, and performed on a stage set next to a Hindu temple. The male artists would dress up and act out the female role in a drama performed by these traveling troupes. In modern times, Kuchipudi has diversified, women have joined Kuchipudi dance, outnumber male artists, and are among its most celebrated artists. In some cases now, it is the Kuchipudi girl artists who dress up and act out the role of boys.

The repertoire of Kuchipudi, like all major classical Indian dance forms, follows the three categories of performance in the ancient Hindu text &quot;Natya Shastra&quot;. These are &quot;Nritta&quot;, &quot;Nritya&quot; and &quot;Natya&quot;.
*The &quot;Nritta&quot; performance is abstract, fast and rhythmic aspect of the dance. The viewer is presented with pure movement in Nritta, wherein the emphasis is the beauty in motion, form, speed, range and pattern. This part of the repertoire has no interpretative aspect, no telling of story. It is a technical performance, and aims to engage the senses (prakriti) of the audience.
*The &quot;Nritya&quot; is slower and expressive aspect of the dance that attempts to communicate feelings, storyline particularly with spiritual themes in Hindu dance traditions. In a &quot;nritya&quot;, the dance-acting expands to include silent expression of words through gestures and body motion set to musical notes. The Kuchipudi actor articulates a story (particularly of Krishna) or a spiritual message. This part of a repertoire is more than sensory enjoyment, it aims to engage the emotions and mind of the viewer.
*The &quot;Natyam&quot; is a play, typically a team performance, but can be acted out by a solo performer where the dancer uses certain standardized body movements to indicate a new character in the underlying story. A &quot;Natya&quot; incorporates the elements of a &quot;Nritya&quot;. Kuchipudi, in its history relied on a team of dance-actors, while in modern times Kuchipudi productions include solo or duo performances.

=== Sequence ===
A complete Kuchipudi show sequence always consists of &quot;nritta&quot; and &quot;nritya&quot; in solo or group performance, but when the underlying text is a play, it may include a &quot;natya&quot;. The nritta or pure abstract dance parts of Kuchipudi, states Reginald Massey, may include parts such as &quot;darus&quot;, &quot;jatis&quot;, &quot;jatiswarams&quot;, &quot;tirmanas&quot; and &quot;tillanas&quot;. The nritya or expressive performance in Kuchipudi includes &quot;padams&quot;, &quot;varnams&quot;, &quot;shabdams&quot; and &quot;shlokas&quot;.

A Kuchipudi performance traditionally is a night performance, when rural families return from their farms and are free of their daily work. It has been performed in or next to a Hindu temple, and the stage lit by the yellow lights of castor oil burning torches. The dance-drama begins with an invocation (&quot;melavimpu&quot;, &quot;puvaranga&quot;). This may be an on stage prayer to Ganesha, the Hindu god of good beginnings, or may be an invocation expressing reverence to various Hindu gods, goddesses, earth, or one&#x27;s guru (teacher).

The conductor of the performance enters and plants an &quot;Indra&#x27;s banner&quot; staff, then introduces all the actors and the characters they play, who are revealed behind a curtain, and when each actor arrives, colored resin is thrown into the flame of one or more torches for dramatic color effects and audience&#x27;s attention. Each actor performs a short dance called the &quot;Pravesa Daru&quot; accompanied by a short musical piece, as the vocalist describes his or her role. The conductor is typically present throughout the performance, on the stage, explains the play, talks and humors the audience.

After the actors have been introduced, the nritta part of the Kuchipudi performance starts. The actors present a pure dance (jatis or jatiswarams), performed rhythmically to a musical raga, and these are called &quot;Sollakath&quot; or &quot;Patakshara&quot;. A basic unit of dance in Kuchipudi is called a &quot;adugu&quot; (or &quot;adugulu&quot;), and these correspond to the &quot;karana&quot; in Natya Shastra. Each basic unit combines hand and foot movement into a harmonious &quot;sthana&quot; (posture) and &quot;chari&quot; (gait), that visually appeals to the audience wherever he or may be sitting. Each dance unit, according to the ancient text, is best performed to certain recitation of mnemonic syllables and musical beat. A series of &quot;karana&quot; form a &quot;jati&quot;, formalized originally as an oral tradition through Sanskrit mnemonics, later written, and these form the foundation of what is performed in &quot;nritta&quot; sequence of Kuchipudi.

Thereafter comes the nritya, the expressive part called &quot;abhinaya&quot;, and this is the heart of the play. The actor-dancer uses hand mudras and facial expressions inspired by the sign language in ancient Sanskrit texts, with an exacting footwork, to communicate the underlying story to the audience. A solo play or solo part of the performance is called a &quot;Shabdam&quot;, and this may be set to a poem, a verse or a prose. A &quot;varnam&quot; combines dance with mime in order to draw out and express the &quot;rasa&quot; (emotional taste), and this can be solo or group. Parts set to poetry that are love lyrics or express deeper sentiments are called a &quot;padam&quot;, and this part constitutes expressing the emotional, the allegorical and the spiritual aspects of the play.

Kavutvams are a feature of the performance that is distinctive to Kuchipudi. These are performed either as nritta or nritya, to different &quot;talas&quot;, wherein the dancer adds acrobatics to the complexity of presentation. For example, the dancer may perform the footwork, rhythmically to music, while balancing a series of pots on his or her head, and then add burning Diya (lamp) in both hands, as the show goes on. Some artists dip their foot on a wet ink pad, then dance rhythmically on a blank white piece of paper, thus painting it; alternatively, the troupe places coloured rice powder on floor and on top the white piece of paper, then dances the musical composition on it, their weight and steps causing the pigment to stick. At the end of the performance, the artist shows the audience the nature scenery or bird or flower or Ganesha or something that results. A &quot;Mayura Kavutvam&quot; dance produces a painting of a peacock, a &quot;Vinayaka Kavutvam&quot; of Ganesha, a &quot;Simhanandi Kavutvam&quot; yields the painting of a lion, each set to a certain classical composition and beat, for instance.

=== Costumes ===
The traditional Kuchipudi was performed by all males troupe. A dancer in a male role would be in &quot;Angavastra&quot;, also known as &quot;Bagalbandi&quot;, wear a &quot;dhoti&quot; (a single pleated piece of cloth hanging down from the waist). A dancer in a female role would wear a &quot;Sari&quot; with light makeup.

Modern productions retain the male dress, but are more elaborate and Bharatanatyam-like for the female roles. Women artists wear a brilliantly colourful &quot;Sari&quot; (or a body fitting dress) with a pleated fan stitched in front to help highlight the exacting footwork. The end of the wrapped &quot;Sari&quot; is held fast under a light metallic (golden or brass) belt at waist. A Kuchipudi artist braids her hair somewhat differently than a Bharatanatyam artist, to reflect the regional traditions, yet wearing flowers are common. Both have symbolic elements embedded in their hair and face jewelry, such as the Vedic symbolisms for the sun and the moon, the soul and the nature, and she sometimes sets her hairdo in the &quot;tribhuvana&quot; style which represents the three worlds. Her jewelry may include hair jewelry, ear, nose, armlets, necklaces and often a leather anklet piece with little bells (&quot;gajjelu&quot; or &quot;ghungroo&quot;). The forehead has a round red bindi or a symmetric tillaka, while the eyes are typically ringed with black collyrium to ease the viewing of expressions by the audience.
Some special Kuchipudi plays may include unusual costumes and theatrics, such as round bottom water pot balanced on the head, dancing with gymnastics or stilt athletics. Other plays may include wing props, a transparent head sheet, or peacock feathered crown to identify the actor playing Krishna.

=== Musical instruments ===

Musical instruments used in Kuchipudi are cymbals, mridangam, violin, thambura, flute. The Kuchipudi performance is led by a conductor (chief musician) called the &quot;Sutradhara&quot; or &quot;Nattuvanar&quot;, who typically keeps the beat using cymbals and also recites the musical syllables; the conductor may also sing out the story or spiritual message being enacted, or this may be a role of a separate vocalist or occasionally the dancer-actors themselves. The Kuchipudi orchestra ensemble includes a drummer (&quot;mridangam&quot;), a clarinetist and a violinist. Depending on the legend being danced out, other musicians such as a flutist may be present.

=== Styles ===
Kuchipudi has several regional &quot;banis&quot; (styles), which developed because of the uniqueness and creativity of gurus (teachers). This openness and flexibility has been a historic tradition in Indian dance culture, and is traceable to early times in Kuchipudi as the &quot;Margi&quot; and &quot;Desi&quot; styles in the text &quot;Nrittaratnavali&quot; of Jaya Senapati. According to Senapati, the &quot;Desi&quot; styles referred to one that incorporated innovations to the conservative &quot;Margi&quot; styles. Senapati lists examples of each. For &quot;Margi&quot; styles, he describes Vedayata, Veddangam, Bommalata, Perani, Chindu, Bahurupam, Pagativeshalu and others; while for &quot;Desi&quot; styles, Senapati describes Rasaka, Charchari, Bhandika, Kollata and others. Some of these styles are discernible in Warangal sculptures of the 13th century.

The dance styles are based on the standard treatises, Abhinaya Darpana and Bharatarnava of Nandikeswara, which is sub-divided into Nattuva Mala and Natya Mala. Nattuva Mala is of two types — the Puja dance performed on the Balipitha in the temple and the Kalika dance performed in a Kalyana Mandapam. Natya Mala is of three kinds — ritual dance for gods, Kalika dance for intellectuals and Bhagavatam for common place.

== Major Kuchipudi dramas ==

The most popular dance-drama is &quot;Bhama Kalapam&quot; of Sidhyendra Yogi. Narayana Teertha composed the &quot;Krishna Lila Tarangini&quot;, a story of Krishna&#x27;s life beginning from his birth to his marriage to Rukmini. Ramaiah Sastri, inspired by the &quot;Bhama Kalapam&quot;, wrote the &quot;Golla Kalapam&quot;, which portrays the theme of an ethical satirical conversation between a Gopi and a Brahmin. Other commonly performed plays are the dance-songs (&quot;kritis&quot;) of Thyagaraja, and the 700 surviving &quot;padams&quot; out of 4500 composed by Kshetrayya of Movva.

Traditional compositions that have been internationally performed by Kuchipudi artists, particularly among Telugu diaspora communities, include &quot;Srinivasa Kalyanam&quot;, &quot;Rukmini Kalyanam&quot; (marriage of Krishna and Rukmini), &quot;Sakuntalam Bhamakalpam&quot;, &quot;Hara Vilasam&quot;, &quot;Prahlada Charitram&quot; (Holi festival-related story), &quot;Usha Parinayam&quot;, &quot;Sasirekha Parinayam&quot;, &quot;Rama Natakam&quot; (probably the oldest play), &quot;Mohini Rukmangada&quot;, &quot;Chamundeswari Sabda&quot;, &quot;Ardhanareeswaram Sabda&quot; and &quot;Perini Thandavam&quot;.

== Schools and training centers ==

Kuchipudi training, as with all major classical Indian arts, have traditionally begun at a young age. The training includes physical exercises, theory, demonstration lessons and a lot of practice. The physical exercises range from yoga to special exercises to develop a supple body and flexibility in leg muscles, lower body, core, arms, shoulders and neck. Some examples of special exercises, state Kothari and Pasricha, are &quot;Dandemu&quot;, &quot;Chakradandemu&quot;, &quot;Ekapada&quot;, &quot;Gunjeelu&quot;, &quot;Kailsamu&quot;, &quot;Kappilu&quot; and &quot;Moggalu&quot;. They are educated in Sanskrit and Telugu. They must also learn music, literature and become vocalists. Training has expanded from within traditional families to anyone across the world due to its popularization.

<text>The Dewoitine D.500 was an all-metal, open-cockpit, fixed-undercarriage monoplane fighter aircraft designed and produced by French aircraft manufacturer Dewoitine.

Developed to meet a specification issued by the French Air Ministry in 1930, the D.500 was intended to be a more capable replacement to the Nieuport 62. Ordered by the French Air Force during November 1933 and introduced in its initial model during 1935, the design was developed into several variants, most notably the D.510, which was re-engined with the more powerful Hispano-Suiza 12Ycrs powerplant. It proved to be a relatively popular aircraft during the Interwar period; in France, in addition to the French Air Force&#x27;s units, a specialised variant, the D.501, was also procured by the French Naval Aviation for carrier operations. Beyond its use in France, the D.500 saw several export sales and evaluations by prospective major customers including the Empire of Japan, the Soviet Union, and the United Kingdom.

The D.500/D.501 saw combat with several operators. During the Spanish Civil War, it was surreptitiously supplied to the Spanish Republican Air Force; it was also flown by the Republic of China Air Force against the invading Japanese during the Second Sino-Japanese War. During the late 1930s, the type was largely superseded by a new generation of French fighter aircraft, these typically featured further innovations such as enclosed cockpits and retractable undercarriages, and included the design&#x27;s direct successor, the Dewoitine D.520. Despite being largely obsolete, both D.500s and D.510s were operated by the French Air Force during the initial months of the Second World War, the latter remaining in use up to the end of the Battle of France and signing of the Armistice of 22 June 1940 between France and Nazi Germany.

==Development==
The origin of the D.500 was the issuing of the &quot;C1&quot; specifications by the French Air Ministry during 1930. Several aviation companies investigated a response to C1, including French aircraft manufacturer Dewoitine, headed by Émile Dewoitine. Dewoitine and his team designed a clean-sheet all-metal monoplane interceptor and submitted their proposal, designated &quot;D.500&quot;, to the Air Ministry. On 18 June 1932, the prototype made its maiden flight. During November 1933, an initial quantity of sixty aircraft was ordered from Dewoitine on behalf of the French Air Force, for whom the type was to serve as a replacement for the Nieuport 62. On 29 November 1934, the first production D.500 made its first flight.

In service, those aircraft armed with a pair of twin nose-mounted machine guns were designated as D.500, while those with a single 20 mm cannon which fired through the propeller hub received the designation &quot;D.501&quot;. Perhaps the most significant derivative of the type was the &quot;D.510&quot;, the principle difference of which was the adoption of a more powerful Hispano-Suiza 12Ycrs engine, capable of ; minor refinements included a slightly lengthened nose, an increase in fuel capacity and a refined undercarriage arrangement. The design was further developed into the more capable Dewoitine D.520, which had an enclosed cockpit and a retractable undercarriage, unlike its predecessor.

==Design==
The Dewoitine D.500 was an all-metal low-wing cantilever monoplane. It featured a sharp fuselage, complete with a streamlined nose section that housed the aircraft&#x27;s powerplant, a single Hispano-Suiza 12Xbrs V-12 liquid-cooled piston engine capable of generating up to . Underneath the fuselage was a relatively large-volume radiator, which was designed to present the smallest possible frontal area while still meeting the cooling requirements of the Hispano-Suiza engine. The cockpit of the D.500 was located directly above the trailing edge of the wing. The pilot is provided with a vertically-adjustable chair, which can be raised in-flight to improve visibility for landing. The cockpit was equipped with oxygen apparatus as well as a radio set for communication. The control stick was connected to the aircraft&#x27;s ailerons via a rod transmission to horns present on the upper wing&#x27;s surface. The control surfaces of the D.500 were relatively small as a result of the aircraft&#x27;s high speed performance.

The D.500 had an ovoid section monocoque fuselage, the structure of which comprised five main and eight false bulkheads which were connected together by four longerons and intermediate stringers; these stiffened the metal sheet covering, which was riveted onto the structure. The sternpost was integral with the fuselage, while the engine bearer, comprising an oblique frame, was directly bolted to the attachment brackets of the crankcase. The aircraft&#x27;s adjustable stabiliser was hinged around its front spar while rigid struts connected to either side of the lower fuselage to provide transverse stiffness. The fixed undercarriage had faired axleless wheels, complete with pneumatic brakes, mounted on a pair of V struts attached to the lower fuselage longerons. The undercarriage&#x27;s vertical stresses are absorbed by an oleo-pneumatic strut bolted to the central wing&#x27;s single spar and is integral with the fuselage.

The D.500 had with low-mounted elliptical, all-metal cantilever wing, with an aspect ratio of 8.9. It had a relatively small chord and contained only a single spar, similar to the record-setting Dewoitine D.33. The wing&#x27;s strength came from its box spar, which was formed from a pair of vertical webs of sheet metal that connect with the flanges, which are in turn riveted to the flat sheet rib arcs of the sheet covering. The wing had a thickness of 0.3 m (11,81
in.) at the root, gradually tapering towards its rounded-off tips. Balanced ailerons extended throughout the span, except near
the fuselage, where these were reduced to provide greater downward visibility for the pilot. The lower wing surface sat only 1.5 m (4.92 ft.) above the ground, which generated a beneficial ground effect to significantly reduce landing speeds. The aircraft&#x27;s fuel tanks, which were located in the wing&#x27;s center portion on either side of the axis of symmetry, could be separately isolated using a multi-way stopcock.

==Operational history==

During July 1935, the initial models of the aircraft, the &quot;D.500&quot; and &quot;D.501&quot;, were inducted into the &quot;Armée de l&#x27;Air&quot;. During October 1936, the first examples of the more powerful &quot;D.510&quot; variant were also delivered. The type was operated as the primary fighter aircraft of the &quot;Armée de l&#x27;Air&quot;, despite it soon being considered to be obsolete due to rapid advances in fighter technology being introduced during the late 1930s. The D.510s were retained in the mainline fighter role until their replacement by the more capable Morane-Saulnier M.S.406 during 1939. By September 1939, the month in which the Second World War broke out between the European powers, the early D.500/501 models had been relegated to regional defense and training squadrons.

At the start of the conflict, significant numbers of D.510s were still in operation with three &quot;Groupes de Chasse&quot; (Fighter Groups), two &quot;Escadrilles Régionale de Chasse&quot; (Regional Fighter Squadrons in North Africa), and two &quot;Escadrilles de Aéronautique Navale&quot; (Naval Aviation Squadrons). The type was normally tasked with the air defence of areas behind the front line, such as cities and industrial areas. During November 1939, in Morocco, North Africa, a single &quot;escadrille&quot; of D.510s (ERC571) was activated despite these planes lacking cannon. During May 1940, this &quot;escadrille&quot; merged with ERC 573 to form GC III/4. This groupe was disbanded by the end of August 1940. At Dakar, one groupe designated GC I/6, remained in service until being replaced by Curtiss H-75s at the end of 1941.

Fourteen D.501s (named D.501L), originally sold to Lithuania, and two D.510s ostensibly intended for the Emirate of Hedjaz, saw service with the Republican forces during the Spanish Civil War, arriving some time during mid-1936. When the French government found out about the delivery of the D.510s, they demanded the return of the 12Y engines. As a result of this request, these aircraft were refitted with Klimov M-100s (a Soviet-built copy of the 12Y) from a Tupolev SB bomber. During the conflict, the two D.510s were assigned to the 71st Coastal Defense Group. Neither reportedly engaged any enemy fighters. During 1938, one aircraft was irreparably damaged while landing, while the other was destroyed on a runway during a bombing attack.

In June 1938, the Nationalist Air Force of China established the 41st PS, French Volunteer Squadron at Wujiaba Airbase and Qingyunpu Airbase; French volunteer pilots participating in few combat engagements against the Japanese attacks while flying in both Hawk IIIs and the D.510s which they were demonstrating for Chinese procurement, but suffered only losses, including one pilot &quot;killed-in-action&quot; against the Japanese A5M fighters that proved to be too difficult of an adversary, and led to the disbandment of the 41st PS by October 1938. The 18 D.510 fighters left in China were reassigned to Chinese Nationalist Air Force 17th Fighter Squadron, 5th Fighter Group, where they would be stationed in Sichuan province and engaging the Imperial Japanese in primarily-defensive airwar campaign in the Battle of Chongqing-Chengdu. The French also dispatched two D.510 to Japan for evaluation by the Imperial Japanese Navy, but the Japanese found the A5M to be superior and did not place any orders.

In course of the air battles over Chengdu and Chongqing, which were mostly fought using Soviet-made Polikarpov I-15 and I-16 fighter aircraft, Capt. Cen Zeliu of the Chinese Air Force 17th Fighter Squadron, 5th Fighter Group led seven Dewoitine D.510s fighters on 4 November 1939 in a level head-on attack against an incoming formation of IJANF G3M bombers (Capt. Cen knowing from experience about the unreliability of the Hispano-Suiza HS.404 20mm autocannon under the g-forces of a diving attack, chose the level and direct head-on tactic); Capt. Cen pounding cannon shells into the lead bomber that happened to be occupied by the Imperial Japanese Navy&#x27;s &quot;13th Kōkūtai Commanding Officer&quot; Captain Kikushi Okuda, sending the CO&#x27;s G3M crashing down in flames over Chengdu, along with three other G3M bombers destroyed in the Chengdu raid that day. With the death of Captain Okuda in the air battle over Chengdu under the cannon-fire of Capt. Cen&#x27;s Dewoitine D.510, the IJN &quot;Kaigun-daisa (海軍大佐) Okuda&quot; became the highest-ranking IJN officer to be &quot;killed-in-action&quot; in the War of Resistance-World War II at that time.

<text>The railway track or permanent way is the elements of railway lines: generally the pairs of rails typically laid on the sleepers or ties embedded in ballast, intended to carry the ordinary trains of a railway. It is described as a permanent way because, in the earlier days of railway construction, contractors often laid a temporary track to transport spoil and materials about the site; when this work was substantially completed, the temporary track was taken up and the permanent way installed.

The earliest tracks consisted of wooden rails on transverse wooden sleepers, which helped maintain the spacing of the rails. Various developments followed, with cast iron plates laid on top of the wooden rails and later wrought iron plates or wrought iron angle plates (angle iron as L-shaped plate rails). Rails were also individually fixed to rows of stone blocks, without any cross ties to maintain correct separation. This system also led to problems, as the blocks could individually move. The first version of Isambard Kingdom Brunel&#x27;s broad gauge system used rails laid on longitudinal sleepers whose rail gauge and elevation were pinned down by being tied to piles (conceptually akin to a pile bridge), but this arrangement was expensive and Brunel soon replaced it with what became the classic broad gauge track, in which the piles were forgone and transoms, similar to sleepers, maintained the rail gauge. Today, most rail track uses the standard system of rail and sleepers; ladder track is used in a few applications.

Developments in manufacturing technologies has led to changes to the design, manufacture and installation of rails, sleepers and the means of attachments. Cast iron rails, long, began to be used in the 1790s and by 1820, wrought iron rails were in use. The first steel rails were made in 1857 and standard rail lengths increased over time from . Rails were typically specified by units of weight per linear length and these also increased. Railway sleepers were traditionally made of Creosote-treated hardwoods and this continued through to modern times. Continuous welded rail was introduced into Britain in the mid 1960s and this was followed by the introduction of concrete sleepers.

==Wooden tracked systems==

===Plank ways===

The earliest use of a railway track seems to have been in connection with mining in Germany in the 12th century. Mine passageways were usually wet and muddy, and moving barrows of ore along them was extremely difficult. Improvements were made by laying timber planks so that wheeled containers could be dragged along by manpower. By the 16th century, the difficulty of keeping the wagon running straight had been solved by having a pin going into a gap between the planks. Georg Agricola describes box-shaped carts, called &quot;dogs&quot;, about half as large again as a wheelbarrow, fitted with a blunt vertical pin and wooden rollers running on iron axles. An Elizabethan era example of this has been discovered at Silvergill in Cumbria, England, and they were probably also in use in the nearby Mines Royal of Grasmere, Newlands and Caldbeck. Where space permitted round-section wooden tracks to take trucks with flanged wheels were installed: a painting from 1544 by the Flemish artist Lucas Gassel shows a coppermine with rails of this type emerging from an adit.

===Edged rails===

A different system was developed in England, probably in the late 16th century, near Broseley for conveying coal from mines, sometimes drift mines down the side of the Severn Gorge to the River Severn. This, probably a rope-hauled incline plane, had existed &#x27;long before&#x27; 1605. This probably preceded the Wollaton Wagonway of 1604, which has hitherto been regarded as the first.

In Shropshire, the gauge was usually narrow, to enable the wagons to be taken underground in drift mines. However, by far the greatest number of wagonways were near Newcastle upon Tyne, where a single wagon was hauled by a horse on a wagonway of about the modern standard gauge. These took coal from the pithead down to a staithe, where the coal was loaded into river boats called keels.

Wear of the timber rails was a problem. They could be renewed by turning them over, but had to be regularly replaced. Sometimes, the rail was made in two parts, so that the top portion could easily be replaced when worn out. The rails were held together by wooden sleepers, covered with ballast to provide a surface for the horse to walk on.

==Early iron rails==
Cast iron strips could be laid on top of timber rails, and the use of such materials probably occurred in 1738, but there are claims that this technology went back to 1716. In 1767, Ketley ironworks began producing cast iron plates, which were fixed to the top of wooden rails with nails, to provide a more durable running surface. This construct was known as strap-iron rail (or strap rail) and was widely used on pre-steam railways in the United States. Although relatively cheap and quick to build, they were unsuited to heavy loads and required &#x27;excessive maintenance&#x27;. Train wheels rolling over the spikes loosened them, allowing the rail to break free and curve upwards sufficiently that a car wheel could get beneath it and force the end of the rail up through the floor of the car, writhing and twisting, endangering passengers. These broken rails became known as &quot;snake heads&quot;.
When wrought iron became available, wrought iron plates provided an even more durable surface. The rails had projecting lugs (or ears) with a hole to enable them to be fixed to the underlying wooden rail.

===Iron plateways===

An alternative was developed by John Curr of Sheffield, the manager of the Duke of Norfolk&#x27;s colliery there. This had a L-shaped rail, so that the flange was on the rail rather than on the wheel. This was also used by Benjamin Outram of Butterley Ironworks and William Jessop (who became a partner in them in 1790). These were used to transport goods for relatively short distances down to canals, though Curr&#x27;s ran between the manor colliery and Sheffield town. These rails are referred to as plates, and the railway is sometimes called a plateway. The term &quot;platelayer&quot; also derives from this origin. In theory, the unflanged wheels could have been used on ordinary highways, but in practice this was probably rarely done, because the wagon wheels were so narrow that they would have dug into the road surface.

The system found wide adoption in Britain. Often, the plates were mounted on stone blocks, and sometimes without sleepers, but that was liable to cause the rails to spread apart, increasing the gauge. Railways of this kind were widely used in south Wales, particularly to transport limestone down to the ironworks, and then to take the iron to a canal, sometimes several miles away, which took the products to market. The rails were at first made of cast iron, typically in lengths of , spanning between stone blocks.

The stone blocks had been assumed to be permanent, but experience quickly showed that they settled and gradually moved under traffic, creating chaotic track geometry and causing derailments. Another problem was that the running surface was liable to become obstructed by stones, displaced from the ballast. An alternative was to use an iron tie bar to keep the rails to the proper gauge, incorporating a shoe in which the rail was fixed.

An example of this was the Penydarren or Merthyr tramway. This was used by Richard Trevithick to demonstrate a pioneer locomotive in 1804, using one of his high pressure steam engines, but the engine was so heavy that it broke many of the rails.

===Early edge rails===
Cast iron edge rails were used by Thomas Dadford Jr. when building the Beaufort and Blaenavon lines to the Monmouthshire canal in 1793. These were rectangular, in width with a depth of and in length, and required flanges on the wagon wheels. The same year, Benjamin Outram used edge rails on the Cromford Canal. T-shaped beams were used by William Jessop on the Loughborough-Nanpantan line in 1794, and his sons used I-shaped beams in 1813–15 on a railway from Grantham to Belvoir Castle. Samples of these rails are held in the Science Museum, London.

A short-lived alternative was the &quot;fish-bellied&quot; profile, first used by Thomas Barnes (1765–1801) at Walker Colliery, near Newcastle in 1798, which enabled rails to have a longer span between blocks. These were T-section edge rails, three feet long and laid on transverse stone sleepers. These were still made of cast iron.

=== Butt and lap joints ===
The earliest rails had square butt joints, which were weak and difficult to keep in alignment. George Stephenson introduced lapped joints, which maintained their alignment quite well.

==Modern edge rails==

The breakthrough came when John Birkinshaw of Bedlington Ironworks in Northumberland developed rolled wrought iron rails in 1820 in lengths, as used for the Stockton and Darlington Railway. This was strong enough to bear the weight of a locomotive and of a train of wagons (or carriages) pulled by it. This marks the beginning of the modern rail era. This system was instantly successful, although some false starts took place. Some early rails were made in a T cross section, but the lack of metal at the foot limited the bending strength of the rail, which has to act as a beam between supports.

As metal technologies improved, these wrought iron rails were made progressively somewhat longer, and with a heavier, and therefore stronger, cross-section. By providing more metal in the foot of the rail, a stronger beam was created, achieving much better strength and stiffness, and a section was created similar to the bullhead rail section still visible today. This was expensive, however, and the promoters of early railways struggled with decisions about the appropriate weight (and therefore strength, and cost) of their rails.

At first, the rail section was almost symmetrical top-to-bottom, and was described as a double-headed rail. The intention was to invert the rail after the top surface had become worn, but rails tend to develop chair gall, an attrition of the rail where it is supported in the chairs, and this would have made running on the former bottom surface impossibly noisy and irregular. It was better to provide the extra metal on the top surface and gain extra wear there without the need to invert the rail at its half life.

Many railways preferred a flat bottom rail section, where the rails could be laid directly on the sleepers, representing a marked cost saving. Indenting of the sleeper was the problem; where the traffic was heavy, it became necessary to provide a sole plate under the rails to spread the load on the tie, partly vitiating the cost saving. However, in main line situations, this form found almost universal adoption in North America and Australia, and in much of continental Europe. The United Kingdom persisted with bullhead rail in main line use, with widespread introduction of flat-bottom rail only starting in about 1947.

===Steel rails===
The first rails made from steel were made in 1857, when Robert Forester Mushet remelted scrap steel from an abortive Bessemer trial, in crucibles at Ebbw Vale ironworks, and were laid experimentally at Derby railway station on the Midland Railway in England. The rails proved far more durable than the iron rails they replaced and remained in use until 1873. Henry Bessemer supplied 500 tons of steel blooms to the London and North Western Railway&#x27;s rail mill at Crewe in 1860. Several other companies began producing steel rails in the following years. The transition to steel rails was hastened by the introduction of open hearth steelmaking. William Siemens set up his Landore steelworks partly to supply rail to the Great Western Railway. A boom in rail production followed, but a banking crisis in America slowed the rate at which railways were built there and orders to British rail producers. The British iron and steel industry went into a recession, which particularly affected the wrought iron sector. When demand for rails began to grow again, it was largely for steel rails, which were more durable than those of iron.

==Associated features==

=== Sleepers ===

Timber sleepers, that is transverse beams supporting the two rails that form the track, replaced the individual stone blocks formerly used. This system has the major advantage that maintenance adjustments to the track geometry did not disrupt the all-important track gauge. The alignment of the track could be adjusted by shifting the sleepers bodily, without loss of gauge. Softwood was widely used, but its life was limited if it was not treated with preservative, and some railways set up creosoting plants for the purpose. Creosote-treated hardwood is now widely used in North America and elsewhere.

By that time, relatively long (perhaps ) wrought iron rails supported in chairs on timber cross-sleepers, were in use—a track form recognisable today in older track.

Steel sleepers were tried as an alternative to timber; Acworth writing in 1889 describes the production of steel sleepers on the London &amp; North Western Railway, and there is an illustration showing rolled channel section (shallow upturned &quot;U&quot; shapes) with no shaped ends, and with three-part forged chairs riveted direct. However steel sleepers seem not to have enjoyed widespread adoption until about 1995. Their dominant usage now is for life extension of existing track on secondary routes. They have a significant advantage on weak formations and poor ballast conditions, as the bearing area is at a high level, immediately under the rail seat.

===Rail fastenings===

The early cast iron rails of the 18th century and before used integral fixings for nailing or bolting to the railroad ties. Strap rails introduced in the late 18th century, of cast and later rolled iron were nailed to wooden supports via countersunk holes in the metal. The introduction of rolled rail profiles in the 1820s such as the &quot;single flanged T parallel rail&quot; and later &quot;double flanged T parallel rail&quot; required the use of chairs, keys to hold the rail, and bolts or spikes to fix the chair. The &quot;flat bottomed rail&quot; invented by Robert L. Stevens in 1830 was initially spiked directly to wooden sleepers, later tie plates were used to spread the load and also keep the rail in gauge with inbuilt shoulders in the plate. Outside North America a wide variety of spring based fastening systems were later introduced in combination with baseplates and flat bottomed rail, these are now ubiquitous on main line high speed railways.

===Ballast===

Track was originally laid directly on the ground, but this quickly proved unsatisfactory and some form of ballast was essential to ensure good drainage, spread the load and retain the track in position. The natural ground is rarely strong enough to accept the loading from locomotives without excessive settlement, more so in wet conditions; a layer of ballast under sleepers reduces the bearing pressure on the ground, tends to keep them in place and resist displacement, and keeps the permanent way well-drained.

Ballast in early days was usually locally available mineral product, such as gravel or reject material from coal and iron mining. The Great North of Scotland Railway used rounded river gravel, which does not constrain movement as much as sharp-edged stone. In later years slag, a by-product of steel making, and ash from steam locomotives was used. Modern practice is to employ sharp-edged stone crushed within a narrow size range.

==Gauges==
=== Early track gauges ===

The early railways were almost exclusively local concerns involved with conveying minerals to some waterway; for them the gauge of the track was adopted to suit the wagons intended to be used, and it was typically in the range to , and at first there was no idea of the need for any conformity with the gauge of other lines. When the first public railways developed, George Stephenson&#x27;s skilful innovation meant that his railways were dominant and the gauge he used was therefore the most widespread. As early notions of linking up different railway systems evolved, this gauge secured general adoption. It is more or less an accident of history that this gauge—which suited the wagons already in use at the colliery where George Stephenson had been an engine man—became the British standard gauge: it was exported to most of Europe and North America.

Reference is sometimes made to the &quot;gauge&quot; of ruts in stone roadways at ancient sites such as Pompeii, and these are often asserted to be about the same as Stephenson&#x27;s gauge. Of course the ruts were made by the wheels of carts, and the carts were of a sensible size for horse-drawn carts prior to the industrial era, pretty much the same as the size of the pre-railway carts at the colliery where Stephenson worked: that is the only connection.

===Broad gauge track===

When Isambard Kingdom Brunel conceived the Great Western Railway (GWR), he sought an improved design for his railway track and accepted none of the previous received wisdom without challenge. The gauge had been fine for small mineral trucks on a horse-drawn tramway, but he wanted something more stable for his high speed railway. The large diameter wheels used in stage coaches gave better ride quality over rough ground, and Brunel originally intended to have his passenger carriages carried in the same way—on large diameter wheels placed outside the bodies of the carriages. To achieve this he needed a wider track gauge and he settled on the famous broad gauge. (It was later eased to ). When the time came to build the passenger carriages, they were designed conventionally with smaller wheels under the bodies after all, but with a seven-foot track gauge the bodies could be much wider than on the standard gauge. His original intention to have the wheels outside the width of the bodies was abandoned.

Brunel also looked at novel track forms, and decided to use a continuously supported rail. Using longitudinal timbers under each rail, he achieved a smoother profile while not requiring such a strong rail section, and he used a shallow bridge rail for the purpose. The wider, flat foot also meant that the chair needed by the bullhead section could be dispensed with. The longitudinal timbers needed to be kept at the proper spacing to retain the gauge correctly, and Brunel achieved this by using timber transoms—transverse spacers—and iron tie-bars. The whole assembly was referred to as the baulk road—railwaymen usually call their track a road. Initially, Brunel had the track tied down to timber piles to prevent lateral movement and bounce, but he had overlooked the fact that the made ground, on which his track was supported between piles, would settle. The piles remained stable and the ground between them settled so that his track soon had an unpleasant undulation, and he had to have the piles severed, so that the track could settle more or less uniformly. A variant of the baulk road can still be seen today on many older under-bridges where no ballast was provided. The design varies considerably, but in many cases longitudinal timbers are supported directly on the cross-girders, with transoms and tiebars to retain the gauge, but of course with modern rails and base-plates or chairs. The longitudinal sleepers are somewhat similar to modern-day Ladder track.

The group of railways that had Brunel as their engineer were successful and the broad gauge track spread throughout the west of England, South Wales, and the West Midlands. But, as the British railway network spread, the incompatibility of the two systems became a serious blockage, as a wagon could not be sent from one system to the other without transshipping the goods by hand. A Gauge Commission was appointed to determine national policy. The Broad Gauge was technically superior but conversion of the standard gauge routes to broad would have meant reconstructing every tunnel, bridge and station platform, whereas universal adoption of the standard gauge only required the progressive conversion of the track itself. The broad gauge was doomed, and no further independent broad gauge lines could be built.

The existing broad gauge routes could continue, but as they had no development potential it was only a matter of time before they were eventually converted to standard. In the meantime, an extensive mileage of mixed gauge track was installed, where each line had three rails to accommodate trains of either gauge. There were some instances of &quot;mixed gauge trains&quot; being run, where wagons of each gauge were run in a single train. The legacy of the broad gauge can still be seen where there seems to be an unnecessarily wide space between station platforms.

==Twentieth century and beyond==
=== 1900 to 1945 ===

At the beginning of the twentieth century, the form of British track had converged on the use of wrought iron bullhead rails supported in cast iron chairs on timber sleepers, laid in some form of ballast. In North America, the standard was T-rails and tie plates fastened to timber crossties with cut spikes. Many railways were using very light rails and, as locomotive weights and speeds increased, these became inadequate. Consequently, on main lines, the rails in use were made progressively heavier (and stronger). Metallurgical processes improved and better rails, including some of steel, came into use. From a maintenance point of view, the rail joints were the source of most of the work, and as steel-making techniques improved it became possible to roll steel rails of increased length—reducing the number of joints per mile. The standard length became , then and finally rails became the norm. For main line use, the standard rail section became the 95BH section, weighing . For secondary routes, a lighter 85BH, , section was used.

Flat bottom rails were still seen as undesirable for British main line railway use, despite their successful use in North America, although some lightly operated British railways used them, generally spiked direct to the sleepers. Under heavy usage, they indent the sleepers severely and the incremental cost of a base-plate appeared at this early date, to rule the flat bottom section out.

Timber sleepers were expensive and not durable, and the railways’ engineers had strong—and conflicting—views about the best wood species and the best preservative treatments. The railways moved towards standardisation on a softwood sleeper preserved by pressure injection of creosote, measuring long by by . Chairs were secured to the sleepers by trenails (steel spikes driven through a timber sleeve) or three chair-screws on first class routes. The GWR alone among the main line railways kept to its own standard, the 00 rail at , and with two fangbolts securing each chair to the sleeper, with the head of the bolt under the sleeper and a nut above the chair—more secure but much more difficult to adjust.

Some experiments were made before 1945 with reinforced concrete sleepers, in most cases with bullhead chairs mounted on them. This was in response to the very high price of the best (most durable) timber, but reinforced concrete sleepers were never successful in main line use. Concrete pots were also used in sidings; they are sometimes called twin-block sleepers, and consisted of two concrete blocks each mounted with a chair, and an angle iron connecting them and retaining the gauge.

===Post-war developments===
At the end of the Second World War in 1945, the British railways were worn out, having been patched up following war damage without the availability of much new material. The country was economically in a weak situation also, and for nearly a decade after the war, materials—especially steel and timber—were in very short supply. Labour too was seriously restricted in availability.

The railway companies became persuaded that the traditional bullhead forms of track needed revision, and after some experimentation a new flat bottom rail format was adopted. The British Standard sections were unsuitable and a new profile, a rail, was made the new standard. In lengths, laid on steel baseplates on softwood sleepers, it was to be the universal standard. The fastenings were to be of a resilient steel type, and for secondary routes a 98 lb/yd rail was adopted. Regional variations still persisted, and hardwood sleepers and Mills clip fastenings were favoured on the Eastern Region, for example.

The new designs were successful, but they introduced many challenges, especially as the availability of experienced track maintenance staff became acutely difficult, and poorly maintained flat bottom track seemed more difficult to keep in good order than poorly maintained bullhead track. The greater stiffness of flat-bottom was an advantage, but it tended to straighten out between the joints on curves; and flat bottom’s rigidity led to high vertical impact forces at badly maintained joints and this resulted in high volumes of fatigue fractures at the joints. Moreover, the elastic rail fastenings had little resistance to rail creep—the propensity of the rails to move gradually in the direction of traffic, and the workload of pulling back the rails to regulate the joints was surprisingly high.

===Long welded rails===
Much of the work of maintaining the track was at the joints, especially as the stiff rails became dipped, and the joint sleepers took a hammering. Pre-war experiments with long welded rail lengths were built upon, and in the years from 1960 long rail lengths were installed, at first on hardwood sleepers but soon on concrete sleepers. For example, the first long welded rail (almost ) on the UK&#x27;s East Coast Main Line was laid in 1957, just south of Carlton-on-Trent, resting on rubber pads to resist rail creep. In this pioneering stage, some catastrophic mistakes in detailed design were made, but from about 1968 continuous welded rail became a reliable standard for universal installation on main and secondary routes. The form adopted used pre-stressed concrete sleepers and a 110A rail section—a slight improvement on the 109 rails previously used—the A was to distinguish it from the British Standard rail section, which was unsuitable. Rail fastenings eventually converged onto a proprietary spring clip made by the Pandrol company which was the exclusive form of fastening in Britain for about 30 years.

The welded track was to be laid on of crushed stone ballast, although this was not always achieved, and the bearing capacity of the formation was not always taken into account, leading to some spectacular formation failures.

A further enhancement to the rail profile produced the 113A section, which was the universal standard until about 1998; detail improvements to the sleepers and ballast profile completed the picture and the general form of the track had stabilised. This format is now in place over 99% of the first-class main lines in Britain, although the CEN60 (60 kg/m) rail section was introduced in the UK during the 1990s. This has a wider rail foot and is taller than the 113A section so is incompatible with standard sleepers.

Track renewal trains have now replaced labour-intensive permanent way gangs. Long welded rail was hard to install manually. An early demonstration of mechanised track-laying with two lengths of long welded rail took place on the Fighting Cocks branch in 1958. The two lengths were loaded on ten wagons, attached to the existing track by a steel rope and drawn back at . As the train moved back, the old rails were levered out and the new ones dropped into the chairs. A hoist on the rear wagon dropped the last part of the rail into place.

==Track gauge==

As stated, the general track gauge in Britain was . In the later 1950s, general track maintenance standards deteriorated rapidly due to labour shortages and, on some routes, faster freight train speeds. Freight trains consisted almost entirely of short wheelbase () four-wheeled wagons carried on a very stiff elliptical leaf spring suspension, and these wagons showed a rapid rate of increase in derailments.

In response to the dynamic behaviour (&quot;hunting&quot;) of the wagons, the permitted speed of the wagons was reduced to and, on new installations of continuously welded track on concrete sleepers, to reduce the track gauge by one-eighth of an inch to . In practice this change caused more problems than it cured and it was returned on renewals to 1435 mm with effect from 1996. The gauge is set by the positioning of the cast-in fixings, so it is not a simple task to re-gauge existing track; it also creates problems with spot replacement of sleepers. Many sleepers were made with the reduced track gauge but standard gauge versions have also been manufactured in more recent times.

==Switches and crossings==

Terminology is difficult for &quot;switches and crossings&quot; (S&amp;C) previously &quot;points and crossings&quot;, or &quot;fittings&quot;.

Early S&amp;C allowed only a very slow speed on the subsidiary route (the &quot;turnout&quot;), so geometrical design was not too important. Many older S&amp;C units had a loose joint at the heel so that the switch rail could turn to close to the stock rail or open from it. When the switch rail was closed, a reasonable alignment was secured; when it was open, no wheel could run on it so it did not matter.

As speeds rose, this was no longer feasible and the switch rails were fixed at the heel end, and their flexibility enabled the toe end to open and close. Manufacture of the switch rails was a complex process, and that of the crossings even more so. Speeds on the subsidiary route were rarely higher than except in very special designs, and great ingenuity was employed to give a good ride to vehicles passing through at speed on the main line. A difficulty was the common crossing where continuous support to wheels passing was difficult, and the point rail was planed to protect it from direct impact in the facing direction, so that a designed irregularity in support was introduced.

As faster speeds were required, more configurations of S&amp;C were designed, and a very large number of components, each specific to only one type of S&amp;C, was required. At faster speeds on the turnout road, the divergence from the main route is much more gradual, and therefore a very considerable length of planning of the switch rail is required.

About 1971, this trend was reversed with the so-called vertical S&amp;C, in which the rails were held vertical, rather than at the customary 1 in 20 inclination. With other simplifications, this considerably reduced the stockholding required for a wide range of S&amp;C speeds, although the vertical rail imposes a loss of the steering effect and the ride through new vertical S&amp;C is often irregular.

==Continuous welded rail==

Continuous Welded Rail (CWR) was developed in response to the observation that the bulk of track maintenance work takes place at the joints. As steel production and manufacturing processes improved, the rail lengths installed were progressively increased, and the logical extension of this would be to eliminate the joints altogether.

A major obstacle to doing so is thermal expansion: the rails expand in higher temperatures. Without joints, there is no room for the rails to expand; as the rails get warmer, they will develop an enormous force in &quot;trying&quot; to expand. If prevented from expanding, they develop a force of 1.7 tonnes (17 kN) for every 1 degree Celsius of temperature change in a practical rail section.

If a small cube of metal is compressed between the jaws of a press, it will contract—that is it will be squashed somewhat—and a very large force can be resisted by it without ultimate failure. However, if a long piece of metal of the same cross section is compressed, it will deform sideways into a bow shape; the process is called buckling, and the compressive force it can withstand is very much less.

If the long thin piece of metal could be constrained to prevent it from buckling (e.g. by being contained inside a tube) then it can resist a much higher compressive force. If the rails can be constrained in a similar way, they can be prevented from buckling. The weight of the track resists buckling upwards, so buckling is most likely to take place laterally. This is prevented by:

* providing heavy sleepers, that generate friction on the ballast bed
* ensuring that the sleepers are well supported on consolidated ballast to enable the generation of the friction
* providing consolidated ballast around the sides of the sleepers to provide additional friction
* heating the rails when they are installed and fastened in cool or cold weather, so that the expansion on the hottest days is less than otherwise
* making sure that any rail added if rail breaks during cold weather is removed before warm weather returns.
* making sure that curves do not line themselves inward during cold weather sufficiently to make buckling more likely when warm weather returns
* taking precautions when track maintenance work is performed in hot weather, and making sure ballast is sufficiently consolidated before full-speed operation is resumed.

If the rail is held so that it cannot expand at all, then there is no limit on the length of rail that can be handled. (The expansive force in a one-foot length of rail at a certain temperature is the same as in a mile or 100 mile length of rail.) Early continuous welded rail was installed in limited lengths only because of technological limitations. However at the end of the CWR section where it abutted older, ordinary jointed track, that track would be unable to resist the expansive force and the jointed track might be forced to buckle. To prevent that, special expansion switches, sometimes called breathers, were installed. The expansion switches could accommodate a considerable expansive movement—typically or so—in the end section of the CWR without passing the movement on to the jointed track.

The CWR is installed and fastened down at an optimum temperature, to ensure that the highest possible expansive force is limited. This temperature is called the stress-free temperature, and in the UK it is . It is in the upper range of ordinary outdoor temperatures, and the actual installation work tends to be done at cooler temperatures. Originally the rails were physically heated to the stress-free temperature with propane gas heaters; they were then rattled with hand bars to eliminate any binding, preventing even expansion, and then clipped down. Since about 1963 however hydraulic jacks are used to physically stretch the rails while they are supported on temporary rollers. By stretching the rails to the length they would be if they were at the stress-free temperature, then there is no need to heat them; they can just be clipped down before the jacks are released.

The CWR rails are made by welding ordinary rails together. For many years, rails could only be made in lengths of up to (18.288 m) in Britain, and the factory welding process made them into , , or lengths, depending on the factory. The process used was a flash-butt process in which high electrical currents are used to soften the rail end, and the ends are then forced together by rams. The flash-butt process is very reliable, providing that the factory ensured good geometry of the rail ends.

The long rails could be conveyed to site by a special train, and unloaded on to the ground (by chaining the end in position and pulling the train out from underneath the rails). The long rails had to be welded together (or to adjacent track) using a site welding process; and, after initial experimentation, the proprietary Thermit welding process was used. This was an alumino-thermic process in which a powder &#x27;portion&#x27; was ignited; the aluminium was the fuel and a metallurgically appropriate composition of molten steel descended into the gap between the rail ends, contained in refractory moulds.

The original SmW process was very sensitive to operator skill, and as the welding was usually the final process before returning the track to traffic, time pressure was sometimes applied resulting in unwanted improper welds. The improved SkV process was less sensitive and over the years weld quality improved.

The issue of buckling is not restricted to CWR, and jointed track has suffered buckles in the past. The fish-plates at joints need to be removed and greased annually (the requirement was relaxed to bi-annually in 1993) and where this was omitted or where ballast conditions were especially weak, buckling took place in hot weather. In addition, if rails were allowed to creep, it was always possible that several successive joints might close up, so that the expansion gap was lost, with inevitable results at the onset of hot weather.

<text>Asher Karni (; born 1954) is a South African and Israeli businessman known for his financial involvement and support for both the Pakistani and Israeli nuclear programs.

== Biography ==
Asher Karni was born in Hungary. He moved to Cape Town, South Africa in the mid-1980s to work for Bnei Akiva, a Jewish Zionist youth movement. He remained in Cape Town and began work as a salesman, selling and buying electronic devices for a local electronics company.

==Controversy==
In early 2004, Karni was accused by the United States of being part of a conspiracy to sell stolen nuclear material. He was arrested while on holiday with his family in Denver, Colorado. Chief Judge Thomas F. Hogan ordered Karni released on US$100,000 bail to Silver Spring, Maryland, having agreed to waive diplomatic immunity and wear an electronic surveillance device, but the US Government moved to have that ruling overturned.

Karni was accused of selling 200 triggered spark gaps to Humayun Khan, a Pakistani man believed connected to a larger terrorist group in Jammu and Kashmir. The nuclear black market is believed to be very tightly knit and to have been headed by Abdul Qadeer Khan, a major figurehead of the Pakistani nuclear program, who was accused of illicitly transferring nuclear technology to multiple states such as Iran and North Korea.

On August 4, 2005 Karni was sentenced to three years in prison for the sale of restricted equipment to companies in India and Pakistan. His defense team requested eighteen months. U.S. District Judge Richard M. Urbina told Karni that although he now believes Karni&#x27;s deeds might have been done innocently, the longer sentence was to &quot;send a message&quot;, and Karni&#x27;s cooperation kept it from being longer.

<doc id="452374" wikidata="Q62823" url="?curid=452374" title="Barranquilla">
<text>Barranquilla () is the capital district of the Atlántico department in Colombia. It is located near the Caribbean Sea and is the largest city and third port in the Caribbean coast region; as of 2018, it had a population of 1,206,319 making it Colombia&#x27;s fourth-most populous city after Bogotá, Medellín, and Cali.

Barranquilla lies strategically next to the delta of the Magdalena River, (originally before rapid urban growth) from its mouth at the Caribbean Sea, serving as a port for river and maritime transportation within Colombia. It is also the main economic center of the Atlántico department in Colombia. The city is the core of the Barranquilla metropolitan area, with a population of over 2 million, which also includes the municipalities of Soledad, Galapa, Malambo, and Puerto Colombia.

Barranquilla was legally established as a town on April 7, 1813, although it dates from at least 1629. It grew into an important port, serving as a haven for immigrants from Europe, especially during and immediately following World War I and World War II, when waves of additional immigrants from the Middle East and Asia arrived. Barranquilla became Colombia&#x27;s main port, and with its level of industrialization and modernity, it earned the nickname &quot;Colombia&#x27;s Golden Gate&quot; (Spanish: &quot;La Puerta de Oro de Colombia&quot;). In the 1940s, Barranquilla was the second-largest city in Colombia and one of the most modern cities in the Caribbean and in South America; later local administrations, due to widespread corruption in their ranks, brought about a decline in the standard of living. As government investment increased in other Colombian cities, Barranquilla&#x27;s national position was eclipsed.

Barranquilla has hosted the 2018 Central American and Caribbean Games. The city is home to one of the most important folk and cultural festivals of Colombia, the Carnival of Barranquilla, which was declared a National Cultural Heritage by the Congress of Colombia in 2001 and recognized by UNESCO in 2003.

Ernesto Cortissoz International Airport, built in Barranquilla in 1919, was the first airport in South America. The city is served by domestic and international flights and was Avianca&#x27;s first hub.

==Etymology==
Barranquilla&#x27;s name refers to the canyons that existed in the area adjacent to the Magdalena, where the city arose. During the Spanish colonization of the Americas, the name &quot;barranca&quot; was common in coastal communities (Barrancabermeja, Barranca Nueva, Barranca Vieja, etc.). This name was probably derived from an alteration of Aragon. During Spanish colonization, the area was known as Camacho or Kamash Indian Site, and San Nicolás de la Barranquilla (patron saint of San Nicolás de Tolentino) began to develop the area with the estates of Barrancas de Camacho, Barrancas de San Nicolás, Barranquilla de Camacho, and Barranquilla de San Nicolás, from which the city name is derived.

===Nicknames===
In 1921, President Marco Fidel Suárez called the city the &quot;Puerta de Oro de la República&quot; (Golden Gate of the Republic) in recognition of its economic importance as a port since the late 19th century. In 1946, opening the 5th Central American and Caribbean Games, President Mariano Ospina Pérez reaffirmed the nickname of the city as the &quot;Golden Gate&quot;.

Barranquilla is also known as &quot;La Arenosa&quot; (meaning &quot;The Sandy&quot;), so named by the president of New Granada, Tomás Cipriano de Mosquera, during his stay in Barranquilla in 1849. &quot;Curramba, la Bella&quot; was also used to refer to Barranquilla by journalist Juan Eugenio Cañavera in Bogotá in the mid-twentieth century. The &quot;la Bella&quot; part was assigned by fellow journalist Roger Araújo as a counterweight to the word Curramba, which is seen as derogatory, derived from adjective &quot;currambero&quot;. The thinker Agustín Nieto Caballero called Barranquilla &quot;Ciudad de los Brazos Abiertos&quot; (&quot;City of the Open Arms&quot;) and Enrique Ancízar, president of the Colombian Society of Agriculture, called it &quot;Faro de América&quot; (&quot;Beacon/Lighthouse of America.&quot;).

== Heraldry and symbols ==

;Flag
In 1811, the patriots who obtained the independence of the Cartagenas adopted the current flag. It consists of three rectangles, red being the outermost, then yellow, and green in the center. Red symbolizes the blood of patriots; yellow, the sun of freedom and hope; and green, a proud home. In the centre, there is an eight-pointed silver star, which symbolizes the eight provinces of the confederacy. The flag was carried by Simon Bolívar during the campaign of Lower Magdalena in 1811. In 1814, the Congress of Tunja adopted it as the emblem of the United Provinces of New Granada. In 1910, the Council approved the flag for Barranquilla.
;Coat of arms
The seal of the city was mentioned in the decree that granted Barranquilla the status of a city by Manuel Rodríguez Torices, the then President of the Sovereign State of Cartagena de Indias, as a reward for the determined and courageous patriots who participated in the defense of the independence of Cartagena de Indias against Santa Marta in 1813.

;Anthem
The music and lyrics of Himno de Barranquilla were chosen in competition by the Sociedad de Mejoras Públicas and officially adopted as the anthem of the city by the Municipal Council in a meeting on 19 October 1942. The lyrics were written by the poet Amira de la Rosa (winner of the contest in 1942) and the music is of Panama, by Simón Urbina (1928).

;Other symbols
The flowers Hibiscus rosa-sinensis, and Tabebuia rosea, and the animals Volatinia jacarina and iguana are used as other symbols of the city.

== History ==

=== Origins and colonial era ===
Unlike other cities in Colombia such as Cartagena or Bogotá D.C., Barranquilla was not founded during the Spanish colonial period and it was not founded on a pre-Columbian site. The first mention of the current territory of Barranquilla dates back to 1533 and was written by Gonzalo Fernández de Oviedo y Valdés. He describes the route of Pedro de Heredia, founder of Cartagena, just weeks before he founded that city, and says that this was a point of landing of canoes for the Indians of Santa Marta within the interior. They had two canoes full of dried shrimp as merchandise and went to the Magdalena River to trade with this commodity, salt and other things. However, the Kamash Indians were known to occupy the area and the settlement itself was established in about 1629. For this reason the city does not celebrate its foundation, but rather the date in which it was declared a town on April 7, 1813.

Barranquilla is honored as the origination of the aviation and airport. The first airline in South America was born in Barranquilla with the name of SCADTA which is today Avianca.

The home location of the Kamash indios (hispanized to &quot;Camacho&quot; or &quot;Camach&quot;) is known as the first permanent human settlement of Barranquilla. During the 16th century, an &quot;encomienda&quot; of captain Domingo de Santa Cruz was established, granted by the Spanish crown for his notable military performance. This &quot;encomienda&quot; disappeared in 1559, when it was in the hands of señora Ana Ximénez, widow of Santa Cruz, after the death of her husband. She became the victim of a disregardful violent act by the second &quot;encomendero&quot; of Galapa, Don Pedro de Barros I, when he arbitrarily grabbed all the Camacho population that could offer labour and took them to his &quot;encomienda&quot;.

Between 1627 and 1637, Hacienda San Nicolás de Tolentino was founded by Nicolás de Barros, great-grandson of Don Pedro de Barros I. The farm was established on the banks of the river channel. The original property area was . Pedro Vasquez Buezo expanded the property to . On this estate, Barros allowed his workers to build their homes and support their families, which helped further develop his field operations. After the death of Barros, the estate began to accommodate others, such as people who for reasons of health, age or cronyism with the hacienda owner were allowed to stay. There were also Indians from Malambo and Galapa. By 1681, the ranch was considered a village, known as Barrancas de San Nicolas. Before 1700, Barranquilla was occupied by Aguerra of Tierradentro and in 1772, the township was expanded by the same group, adding a Judge Counsel.

The origin of Barranquilla, promoted in the second half of the 19th century by the historian Domingo Malabet, was not supported by oral tradition nor scientifically validated. Blanco Barros&#x27; 1987 book on Northern Tierradentro and the origins of Barranquilla argued that the city had been founded by farmers from the neighboring town of Galapa who left their land, following their herds to the Magdalena River.

===Era of Independence (1810–1823)===

In the era of the Colombian War of Independence, Barranquilla distinguished itself as a supporter of the pro-independence forces. In 1812, General Pierre Labatut attacked and defeated royalist forces at Sitioviejo and Sitionuevo. On April 7, 1813, which was later celebrated as &quot;Barranquilla Day&quot; (&quot;el Día de Barranquilla&quot;), the President-Governor of the Free and Independent State of Cartagena de Indias, Manuel Rodríguez Torices, granted the title of &quot;villa&quot; to the town, thereby allowing it to benefit from certain privileges, and making it the capital of the department of Barlovento (or Tierradentro), in recognition for the valor and patriotism displayed by the town for its defense of the pro-independence city of Cartagena de Indias against the royalist stronghold of Santa Marta.

In 1815, Joaquín Vallejo, a rich merchant, maintained a pro-independence battalion for three months at his own expense. When the Spanish forces under Colonel Valentín Capmani approached Barranquilla, its inhabitants resisted Capmani but were defeated on April 25, 1815. The population of the town was attacked and taken prisoner by the royalist troops, which also defeated Vallejo&#x27;s pro-independence battalion. In the following 5–6 years, Barranquilla was a center for republican military operations. On October 10, 1821, the last royalist stronghold at Cartagena was defeated. At that time, Cartagena was capital of the Sovereign State of Bolivar, to which Barranquilla belonged. In the same year, Barranquilla was governed by its very first mayor, Agustín Del Valle, who carried out his duties from his own home, which later was converted in a military headquarters. On July 24, 1823, the naval Battle of Lake Maracaibo took place, which resulted in the final expulsion of Spanish royalist forces from Gran Colombia.

=== Republican Period ===
====19th century====
The geographic area of Barranquilla did not include mineral or natural riches, and thus did not serve as a location where the Spanish maintained a permanent presence. Its importance was not appreciated until the mid-19th century, due to the introduction of steamships that navigated the Magdalena River by the German Juan Bernardo Elbers on behalf of Simón Bolívar at the founding of Gran Colombia in 1823. The route was opened on November 10, 1825. Barranquilla thus initiated a lively exchange of goods with cities and towns of the Colombian interior, as well as with international merchants, and it became a principal port for the export of coffee. With the establishment of the new nation of the Republic of New Granada in 1831, two revolutions began in Barranquilla. One was led by Policarpo Martínez, Antonio Pantoja, Lorenzo Hernández, Crispín Luque, Esteban Márquez y Santos de la Hoz against the dictatorship of Rafael Urdaneta. The second was led by General Ignacio Luque, who had crushed the first revolution.

In 1840, merchants and commercial carriers of Barranquilla tried to form an independent province, &quot;Cibeles&quot;, which was to comprise the cantons of Barlovento. They proclaimed Colonel Ramón Antigüedad as their leader. The primary objective was to rehabilitate the town of Sabanilla as an independent port, as exports were controlled by the cities of Cartagena and Santa Marta. This rebellion was quickly crushed by Cartagenan troops. In 1845, the city was one of nine cantons that comprised the province of Cartagena.
 At the end of the decade, in 1849, President Tomás Cipriano de Mosquera issued a decree that revitalized the bay of Sabanilla as a port to export goods. A customs house was built there, the Castillo de Salgar, to accommodate the new traffic. In early June 1849, an outbreak of cholera occurred in Barranquilla. It had originated in Cartagena, which in turn had received it from shipments coming from Panama.

On March 20, 1852, a law was passed by the Congress of New Granada that separated the province of Cartagena from the cantons of Barranquilla, Soledad, and Sabanalarga, which became part of the province of Sabanilla, with Barranquilla as the capital. On May 2, 1854, Tomás Cipriano de Mosquera arrived at Barranquilla, and the inhabitants supported him in his fight against the revolutionary José María Melo in Bogotá. On October 7, 1857, Barranquilla was granted the status of &quot;ciudad&quot; (&quot;city&quot;) by the Constituent Assembly of the State of Bolívar; and in the same year, the Municipal Council of Barranquilla designated three zones in the city: Abajo del Río, Arriba del Río, and El Centro. Barranquilla formed part of the department of Sabanilla, one of the five departments that comprised the Sovereign State of Bolívar, whose formation had succeeded the province of Cartagena by law of June 15, 1857. During the time of the Granadine Confederation, Conservative General Joaquín Posada Gutiérrez attacked and defeated the city square in Barranquilla defended by the Liberal leader Vicente Palacio on November 6, 1859. Subsequently, the city would be recovered by the Liberal leader Manuel Cabeza on December 9.
On January 25, 1861, General Juan José Nieto Gil, president of the State of Bolívar, launched a rebellion from Barranquilla. Barranquilla became the capital of a province of the same name by law on December 26, 1862, and the Sovereign State of Bolívar was divided into 12 provinces. At the establishment of the United States of Colombia, the growing commercial importance of Barranquilla led to the construction, between 1869 and 1871, of the Bolívar Railway (&quot;Ferrocarril de Bolívar&quot;), the first railway of the present-day Republic of Colombia. It linked Barranquilla and Sabanilla (Salgar), the latter being the location of the customs house. Due to the shallowness of the waters, it was necessary to extend the railway to Puerto Cupino, where the Cuban engineer Francisco Javier Cisneros built what was then one of the longest piers in the world, second only to the one in Southend-on-Sea, England.

In 1872, an epidemic with symptoms similar to those of cholera became manifest in the city. In 1876, an enormous amount of contraband entered the city from Salgar. In the last decades of the 19th century, Barranquilla experienced a series of advances represented by the founding of the Society of the Aqueduct in 1877, commissioning in 1884 of a mule-pulled tram, the installation of the first phones in Colombia on September 1, 1885. This telephone project had Mr. Orlando Flye, an electrical engineer from Ohio, as general contractor; and the foundation of the first private telephone service in Colombia, the Colombian-West Indian Mobile Company of Mobile by the U.S. citizen William Ladd.

It was at this time that the city became important for its booming business and its strategic geographic location, becoming the first port on a river of Colombia.

On January 6, 1885, revolutionary forces under General Ricardo Gaitán Obeso occupied the city. On February 11, the head of government, General Vicente Carlos Urueta, attacked an area defended by General Nicolás Jimeno Collante. Urueta triumphed over Obeso, but additional troops overtook Urueta. The modern Republic of Colombia was established the following year. Barranquilla became one of the 34 new departments, comprising the provinces of Barranquilla and Sabanalarga. During this time the city was established as the principal port of Colombia, helped along by the commissioning of the steam tramway in 1890 and the construction of the port of Puerto Colombia in 1893, which served as the Barranquilla port into the 20th century. The goods moved by rail to Barranquilla, and then by river to the interior.

====20th century====
As part of the country&#x27;s restructuring, President General Rafael Reyes, of the National Constituent and Legislative Assembly, through Act April 17, 11, 1905 created the Atlántico department, consisting of the provinces of Barranquilla and Sabanalarga, the department of Bolivar, and Barranquilla as the capital. However, in 1908, Atlántico department was changed to the Department of Barranquilla by Act 1. With the fall of General Reyes in 1909, the Department of Barranquilla was abolished by Act 65 of that year, with Barranquilla again integrating into the department of Bolivar. The National Constituent Assembly of 1910 enacted Law 21 on July 14, which definitively established the Department of Atlántico with Barranquilla again as capital.

With the city&#x27;s economic boom, the Chamber of Commerce of Barranquilla was created on June 28, 1905. On September 7, 1909, a bill was passed by Congress recognizing the opening of Bocas de Ceniza as a national necessity. In June of the same year, &quot;The Barranquillazo&quot; coup was attempted by followers of General Ramón González Valencia against the General Jorge Holguín who was designated the rank of president of the republic after the resignation of the incumbent, General Reyes. The first flight of a Colombian airplane occurred in Barranquilla in December 1912, the plane being flown by the Canadian pilot George Schmitt. On December 10, 1919, the first commercial airline arrived in the Americas, and second in the world; Scadta later became Avianca. In June 1919, U.S. pilot William Knox Martin and Mario Santo Domingo inaugurated industrial airmail in Colombia with a flight between Barranquilla and Puerto Colombia, where Santo Domingo delivered the mail sack.

With the connections of the river and seaport reaching the country&#x27;s interior and abroad, the city became in the second half of the 19th century through the early decades of the 20th century, one of the most cosmopolitan and multicultural cities of Colombia. Puerto Colombia became one of the longest piers in the world and the principal port of Colombia, nicknamed the &quot;Golden Gate of Colombia&quot;. 

A major inflow of Jewish immigrants, as well as foreigners from Syria, Palestine, Lebanon, France, Germany, the United States, Italy, China and Japan, invigorated the industry and helped to make Barranquilla a modern city. Of these immigrants, the Arab and Jewish from the Middle East immigrants were prominent, referred to wrongly as &quot;Turks&quot; by the Colombian people. As a result, during the first half of the twentieth century, Barranquilla became one of the fastest-growing cities of Colombia, growing at rates well above others; this was maintained until the 1970s. 
In this context, the office of Salgar was moved to Barranquilla, the Customs Administration of Barranquilla was constructed between 1919 and 1921, designed by the English architect Leslie Arbouin. Under economic dynamism, the city&#x27;s business strength grew. This was attributed to its point of entry to the country by thousands of immigrants and many advances such as aviation. The city received from President Marco Fidel Suarez the title of &quot;Golden Gate Republic&quot;. On January 12, 1919, amid great excitement in the Costa Caribe against Bogotá, Barranquilla joined the Costeña League. 

In 1920, archaeologists revealed that Barranquilla is located on a vast historic necropolis. On June 8, 1924, while distributing flyers for the work of Bocas de Ceniza, the Tolima A-16 airplane, flown by German aviator Helmuth Von Krohn crashed, killing all six people aboard, including Ernesto Cortissoz, president of SCADTA.

In 1925, the first public companies based in the country were established in Barranquilla. The initial effect of the aqueduct that was built in 1929 was the arrival of piped water to 80% of the homes, while water supply coverage in Bogotá was 59%, and decreasing to 57.3% in Medellín, 74.8% in Cali, 21.4% in Cartagena, and 36.2% in Santa Marta. In 1927, the electricity service provided by the Electric Power Company Barranquilla addressed the needs of 10,300 homes, equivalent to 74% of the total. On February 4, 1925, Scadta acquired the planes large enough to make the first international flights, which took place in August of that year between Barranquilla and Key West, Florida, with stops in Central America, Mexico and Cuba.

In an era of significant progress for the city, the first private commercial radio station was founded in the country, the first station being the state HJN Colombia Bogotá. Elías Pellet Buitrago started commercial radio in Colombia with the first issue of &quot;La Voz de Barranquilla&quot; on December 8, 1929. On April 10, 1931, in a mutiny against hunger and unemployment, the people of Barranquilla destroyed the Theatre Columbia. On August 16, 1933, the Senate approved the contract for Bocas de Ceniza and work was completed in 1936 with President Alfonso Lopez inaugurating the Maritime Terminal Barranquilla. In 1935, the construction of a municipal football stadium enabled hosting of the National Game III.

From the 1960s until the early 1980s, the city plunged into an economic decline, largely due to the failure of the political class as well as the collapse of major sectors of industrial activity. In 1958, the government created the first zone of Colombia in Barranquilla. The city&#x27;s expansion to reach neighboring towns led to the creation of the Metropolitan Area of Barranquilla in 1981. On August 18, 1993, the Congress of Colombia, through Legislative Act Number August 1, 17, 1993, conferred to Barranquilla the category of &quot;Special District, Industrial and Port&quot;.

=== 21st century ===
In the 21st century, the city has been working on new projects to restore itself as the strategic capital within the country. Rapid urban growth, including the mass migration of peasants to the main cities, attracted by economic development, has led to the demand of numerous proposals to accommodate such growth. Barranquilla has always been famous for its chaotic urban planning, understandable given its spontaneous origin as a port and the reality of high administrative corruption which has hampered the channeling of resources for building an urban centre of greater structure and dimensions. The presentation of a new infrastructure, changes in local and regional administration, decentralization since 1991, international pressure to open markets, and competition between the other major Colombian cities will bring about considerable development in Barranquilla into the 21st century.

== Geography ==

The city is located in the northeastern corner of the department of the Atlantic, on the west bank of the Magdalena River, (originally before rapid urban growth) from its mouth in the Caribbean. The municipality covers an area of 154 km2, equivalent to 4.5% of the area of the Atlántico Department. Barranquilla is located at latitude 10° 59&#x27; 16&quot; north of the Equator and longitude 74° 47&#x27; 20&quot; west of Greenwich, with reference to the &quot;Plaza de la Paz&quot;, ground zero of the city.
The urban area is built on a slightly inclined plane whose extreme heights, according to the Codazzi, are 4 m and 98 m east to west. Other sources say the slopes accidental heights of up to 120 meters outside the city. According to Google Earth, the height of the city varies between 0 m in the western breakwater, up to maximum 142 m in the neighborhood of Los Nogales.
Politically, Barranquilla is limited to the east by the department of Magdalena (through the middle of the Magdalena River), north to the town of Puerto Colombia and the Caribbean Sea, west with the municipalities of Puerto Colombia, Galapa and Tubará and south with the municipality of Soledad.

Daytime temperatures usually remain around . Nevertheless, from late November to early April, trade winds more or less cool it to a more comfortable temperature during daylight. During the evening and through the night, temperature can change due to the strong winds it receives. Rainy seasons are from April to June and from August to November, when some streets flood producing &quot;arroyos&quot; (streams) that can be very dangerous, given the lack of appropriate rain drainage in some sectors of town.

=== Flora ===

According to the Agustín Codazzi Geographic Institute (Instituto Geográfico Agustín Codazzi), Barranquilla has a dry tropical forest vegetation (according to the Holdridge life zones), which includes species including cacti, mangroves, &quot;Acanthocereus&quot;, &quot;Prosopis juliflora&quot;, divi-divi, &quot;Tabebuia rosea&quot;, and flamboyant or flame tree.

===Ecology and natural resources===
Barranquilla contains important ecosystems such as the Magdalena River, Mallorquín Swamp and the Eastern pipe system. The completion of the construction of embankments of Bocas de Ceniza in 1936 resulted in the deterioration of the swamp, which was originally four marshes, and led to the deterioration of the nearby beaches of Puerto Colombia.

The stream of La Victoria flows through Barranquilla Botanical Garden, a community and recreational green area for public use with an approximate area of 7 hectares, located in the southeastern part of the city, in the neighborhood of La Victoria. The lush vegetation and clear water springs have allowed a suitable habitat for rare native plant and animal species found within the city.

===Environmental pollution===
;Air quality
Under wind, atmospheric pollutants move in a north and northeasterly direction, and in times of low winds or moderate winds, are more evenly distributed over the city. The most polluting industrial processes in the city are ammonium sulfate, cement, plaster, and paper pulp. The emission of gases from motor vehicle traffic is more critical in the central district, where much of the business is. The main source of air pollution is from the vehicles at 34% and then industry with 18%. The pollutants emitted by vehicles are carbon monoxide (89.12%), sulfur dioxide (0.23%), hydrocarbons (6.46%), oxides of nitrogen (3.82%) and other particles (0. 37%). To help remedy this problem, several state enterprises and private sector have supported a project to convert liquid fuel vehicles to natural gas. Furthermore, the city has installed more than 12 service stations catering to natural gas vehicles. Barranquilla is the fourth-biggest atmospheric polluter from industry. 

According to research conducted by the Institute of Hydrology, Meteorology and Environmental Studies of Colombia (IDEAM), monthly concentrations in Barranquilla of particulate matter smaller than 160 micrograms per cubic meter exceeds the highest international standard allowed of 70. The causes of this problem lie heavily with the poor quality of petrol and diesel used by vehicles in the city, with record levels of 5,000 ppm (parts per million sulfur) and 4,500 ppm respectively, when there are countries whose rates do not even exceed 50.

;Water pollution
All of the surface water systems of Barranquilla, the Magdalena River, the Mallorquín swamp, and the system of pipes and streams in the east are subject to water pollution as well as the dumping of raw sewage and solid waste by individuals. The environmental effect has been reduced mainly on the Mallorquín swamp with the construction of ponds and the Estación Depuradora de Aguas Residuales (EDAR) by the Triple A.

;Noise
The maximum noise allowed is 64 decibels for residential areas, and 70 to 75 for commercial and industrial areas. In the center of Barranquilla, the noise generated by vehicular traffic and commercial activity in peak hours can reach levels above 90 decibels, making it a risk factor for population health.

If the property is situated on a street, an address will begin by Calle (otherwise by Carrera), followed by the number of the street and then separated by the # symbol and then usually the name/number of the closest cross street. For example, Calle 47B # 21–10; Carrera 5 Sur # 50–04.

===Architecture===
Barranquilla&#x27;s architecture was built almost entirely in the twentieth century. In the city there are buildings of the colonial period in the early decades of the independent nation, but the profusion of styles that flourished from the late nineteenth century give the city a cosmopolitan atmosphere. This architectural splendor is testament to the influence of the people arriving in the port for much of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries from North America, Europe, the Middle East and Asia, many of whom settled in Barranquilla and imported architectural styles.

Among the most important styles are neoclassical and art deco and interesting examples of neo-colonial architecture, modern, contemporary, eclectic, Mudejar, Spanish late Baroque, Mozarabic and Netherlands Antilles style Caribbean architecture. Some modern buildings are influenced by international architects such as Oscar Niemeyer, Le Corbusier (who was in Barranquilla at the end of the 1940s), Leopoldo Rother, Mies van der Rohe and Richard Neutra, among others that have contributed to an impressive architectural landscape.

;Republican architecture
The so-called &quot;Republican architecture&quot; &quot;style&quot; refers to the architecture of the period in Colombia after independence in 1819, wand around 1930, which brings together different styles in the city, including the late baroque and neoclassical Spanish.

Since the beginning of the twentieth century neoclassical buildings were especially welcome in Barranquilla. Among the outstanding examples are Instituto La Salle, Villa Heraldo, la Corporación Autónoma Regional del Atlántico (former home of writer Álvaro Cepeda Samudio), the residence of Ezequiel Rosado, Funeraria Jardines del Recuerdo, the restored Customs building, the former Banco Comercial de Barranquilla and Banco Dugand y La Perla, among many others, mainly in the neighborhood of El Prado and in the Centro Histórico de Barranquilla. Other noteworthy buildings are the Hotel El Prado (Spanish late Baroque), the Faculty of Fine Arts at the Universidad del Atlántico and the Intendencia Fluvial.

; The transition (1930–1945)
Colombian architectural movement prior to the Modern Movement looks notably different from buildings of the Republicans. Most prominent is Art Nouveau and Art Deco. In the city there are many buildings with Art Deco style, typical of the 1930s, as the Estadio Romelio Martínez (1935), the Departmental Library of Barranquilla (1945), the Rex Theatre (1935), the late Metro Theatre (1946, former Apollo) Shaare Sedek Synagogue (1946–1947), the building of the Agricultural Exhibition (1936, later became Industrial School), the Eckardt building (1939 ), the former residence of the Cuban architect Manuel Carrerá in the Bellavista neighborhood, the García building (1938), Teatro Colón (1946), the former building of Avianca (1934), the last four designed by Manuel Carrerá. The Estadio Romelio Martínez stadium was recognized in 1995 as a national monument by the Ministry of Culture, the first Art Deco building in Barranquilla to obtain this declaration.

; Modern movement (1945–1970)

The Modern Architecture is characterized by being free of ornamental designs that identify the buildings of the Republican period, and the trend toward architectural rationalism in concrete. Among the most valuable examples of modern architecture in the city include the National Building (1945), seat of the judicial branch, designed by German architect Leopoldo Rother, Queen Mary&#x27;s Cathedral (begun in 1955) and the old building of the Agricultural Credit Bank (1964), located on the top of Paseo de Bolívar and designed by architect Fernando Martínez Sanabria. Also, worth mentioning is the Sena buildings, the elegant building of Telecom (with a sculpture by Alejandro Obregón in the square of access), the buildings of the Universidad del Atlantico and the Mayor building in the Paseo de Bolívar, a former building of the Bank of the Republic.

; (1970–1985)

This is a period in which the system &quot;Unidad de Poder Adquisitivo Constante&quot; (UPAC) resulted in the commercialization of architecture at the expense of spatial quality and aesthetics. The search for safer environments brought about the proliferation of housing complexes and shopping centres closed.

<text>A timocracy (from Greek τιμή &quot;timē&quot;, &quot;honor, worth&quot; and -κρατία &quot;-kratia&quot;, &quot;rule&quot;) in Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;Politics&quot; is a state where only property owners may participate in government. More advanced forms of timocracy, where power derives entirely from wealth with no regard for social or civic responsibility, may shift in their form and become a plutocracy where the wealthy rule.

==Ancient Greece==
Solon introduced the ideas of &quot;timokratia&quot; as a graded oligarchy in his Solonian Constitution for Athens in the early 6th century BC. His was the first known deliberately implemented form of timocracy, allocating political rights and economic responsibility depending on membership of one of four tiers of the population. Solon defined these tiers by measuring how many bushels of produce each man could produce in a year, namely:

* Pentacosiomedimnoi – &quot;Men of the 500 bushel&quot;, those who produced 500 bushels of produce per year, could serve as generals in the army
* Hippeis – Knights, those who could equip themselves and one cavalry horse for war, valued at 300 bushels per year
* Zeugitae – Tillers, owners of at least one pair of beasts of burden, valued at 200 bushels per year, could serve as hoplites
* Thetes – Manual laborers

N. G. L. Hammond supposes Solon instituted a graduated tax upon the upper classes, levied in a ratio of 6:3:1, with the lowest class of thetes paying nothing in taxes but remaining ineligible for elected office.

Aristotle later wrote in his &quot;Nicomachean Ethics&quot; (Book 8, Chapter 10) about three &quot;true political forms&quot; for a state, each of which could appear in corrupt form, becoming one of three negative forms. Aristotle describes timocracy in the sense of rule by property-owners: it comprised one of his true political forms. Aristotelian timocracy approximated to the constitution of Athens, although Athens exemplified the corrupted version of this form, described as democracy.

== Thirteen Colonies ==

In the early times of American independence only men who would hold enough property and money (except in New Jersey, where women meeting the requirements were allowed as well) could vote; there were also at times requirement of race:

* Connecticut: an estate worth 40 shillings annually or £40 of personal property
* Delaware: fifty acres of land (twelve under cultivation) or £40 of personal property
* Georgia: fifty acres of land
* Maryland: fifty acres of land and £40 personal property
* Massachusetts Bay: an estate worth 40 shillings annually or £40 of personal property
* New Hampshire: £50 of personal property
* New Jersey: one-hundred acres of land, or real estate or personal property £50
* New York: £40 of personal property or ownership of land
* North Carolina: fifty acres of land
* Pennsylvania: fifty acres of land or £50 of personal property
* Rhode Island and Providence Plantations: personal property worth £40 or yielding 50 shillings annually
* South Carolina: one-hundred acres of land on which taxes were paid; or a town house or lot worth £60 on which taxes were paid; or payment of 10 shillings in taxes
* Virginia: fifty acres of vacant land, twenty-fives acres of cultivated land, and a house twelve feet by twelve feet; or a town lot and a house twelve feet by twelve

==Timocracy, comparable values, and Plato&#x27;s five regimes==

In &quot;The Republic&quot;, Plato describes five regimes (of which four are unjust). Timocracy (Book VIII, 545 B - 550 B) is listed as the first &quot;unjust&quot; regime. Aristocracy degenerates into timocracy when, due to miscalculation on the part of its governed class, the next generation of guardians and auxiliaries includes persons of an inferior nature (the persons with souls made of iron or bronze, as opposed to the ideal guardians and auxiliaries, who have souls made of gold and silver). A timocracy, in choosing its leaders, is &quot;inclining rather to the more high-spirited and simple-minded type, who are better suited for war&quot;. The city-state of Sparta provided Plato with a real-world model for this form of government. Modern observers might describe Sparta as a totalitarian or one-party state, although the details we know of its society come almost exclusively from Sparta&#x27;s enemies. The idea of militarism-stratocracy accurately reflects the fundamental values of Spartan society. The only one of Plato&#x27;s five regimes that he does deem fit to govern is aristocracy, the four other regimes (including Timocracy) are unjust according to Plato. The unjust regimes in Plato&#x27;s work refer to governing that lead to chaos and ultimately corruption.

<doc id="452394" wikidata="Q1750731" url="?curid=452394" title="Northern panhandle of West Virginia">
<text>The northern panhandle is one of the two panhandles in the U.S. state of West Virginia. It is a culturally and geographically distinct region of the state. It is the state&#x27;s northernmost extension, bounded by Ohio and the Ohio River on the north and west and the state of Pennsylvania on the east. Its unusual configuration is the result of the Revolutionary-era claims of Virginia&#x27;s former Yohogania County boundary lying along the Ohio River, conflicting with interpretations of the Colony of Pennsylvania&#x27;s royal charter. The conflict was settled by compromise in the 1780s.

In 2013, its northernmost two counties were included in the Pittsburgh consolidated area by the U.S. Census.

==Geography==

=== Composition ===
The following counties, listed from north to south, are universally accepted as being part of the northern panhandle:
*Hancock County
*Brooke County
*Ohio County
*Marshall County

Most West Virginians also include Wetzel County, and sometimes Tyler County, directly to the south of Marshall County, as a part of the northern panhandle, although they do not lie strictly within the northern extension. Prior to the 2020 redistricting, they formed the core of . 

=== Demographics ===
The region had a total combined population of 132,295, counting counties only physically on the panhandle, and 158,086 counting Wetzel and Tyler counties as of the 2010 census. In the 2020 census, the populations were 124,670 and 147,425, respectively. This constitutes a drop of 5.76% and 7.23%, keeping with the overall population trends of the Rust Belt.

The northern counties of the northern panhandle comprise part of the Weirton–Steubenville, WV–OH Metropolitan Statistical Area, as well as the western regions of Greater Pittsburgh. The southern counties are part of the Wheeling, WV–OH Metropolitan Area.

==Economy==
In the late nineteenth century, the northern panhandle developed as an industrial area, especially in the manufacturing of steel and glass products. It still largely retains its industrial character, although many of its factories have closed down or fallen on hard times like others in the Rust Belt. The region also contains the panhandle coalfield.

Banks in these counties are serviced by the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, while the rest of West Virginia is in the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond.

==Education== 
The region houses three four-year colleges: the public West Liberty University and the private Bethany College and Wheeling University. All five counties listed in this article, plus Tyler County, are located within the service area of West Virginia Northern Community College.

<text>The &quot;Attack&quot;-class patrol boats were small coastal defence vessels built for the Royal Australian Navy (RAN) and operated between 1967 and at least 1991. Following their Australian service, twelve ships were transferred to Papua New Guinea and Indonesia.

==Construction==
Twenty boats were ordered by the Department of Defence in November 1965 at a cost of around A$800,000 each from two Queensland shipyards, Evans Deakin in Brisbane and Walkers in Maryborough. Five were marked for the formation of a &quot;New Guinea coastal security force&quot;, while the other fifteen were for patrols and general duties in Australian waters.

The first vessel was scheduled to be commissioned in August 1966, but she was not launched until March 1967.

The inclusion of the &quot;Attack&quot; class in the RAN fleet led to a smaller scaled down version of the Ships Crest ship&#x27;s badge design to be created, as it was not deemed appropriate for such small vessels to use the full-size crest. The crest used by the patrol boats and other minor war vessels is scaled down from to , with no other alterations to the design.

==Operational history and fates==
The &quot;Attack&quot; class was replaced in RAN service by the larger and more capable s.

In 1975, &quot;Aitape&quot;, &quot;Ladava&quot;, &quot; Lae&quot;, &quot;Madang&quot;, and &quot;Samarai&quot; were transferred to the Papua New Guinea Defence Force. All five were paid off during the late 1980s, with &quot;Aitape&quot; sunk as a dive wreck off Port Moresby in 1995.

&quot;Acute&quot;, &quot;Archer&quot;, &quot;Assail&quot;, &quot;Attack&quot;, &quot;Barbette&quot;, &quot;Bandolier&quot;, &quot;Barricade&quot;, and &quot;Bombard&quot; were transferred to the Indonesian Navy between 1974 and 1985, and are listed in &quot;Jane&#x27;s Fighting Ships&quot; as still operational in 2011.

 was destroyed in Darwin on 25 December 1974 during Cyclone Tracy.

&quot;Advance&quot; was donated to the Australian National Maritime Museum in the late 1980s for preservation as a museum ship. &quot;Ardent&quot; was to be preserved as a memorial in Darwin, but was instead sold into civilian service in 2001 and converted into a pleasure craft. &quot;Aware&quot; was sold to a private owner during the 1990s, who modified her for use as a diving and salvage mothership, then was resold in to new owners in 2006. &quot;Bayonet&quot; was scuttled in Bass Strait in 1999 and has been successfully dived. &quot;Adroit&quot; paid off on 28 March 1992 and was sunk as a target by A-4 Skyhawk aircraft of the Royal New Zealand Air Force west of Rottnest Island on 8 August 1994. The remainder of the class were broken up for scrap.

===In fiction===
Two &quot;Attack&quot;-class boats represented the fictional HMAS &quot;Ambush&quot; in the first series of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation TV series &quot;Patrol Boat&quot;.

==List of ships==

The 1998 edition of &quot;Jane&#x27;s Fighting Ships&quot; reports that two vessels of a similar design, pennant numbers 860 and 861 (KRI &quot;Waigeo&quot;), were being operated by the Indonesian Navy. It speculates that these were locally built copies of the class.

<text>André Robert Raimbourg (; 27 July 1917 – 23 September 1970), better known as André Bourvil (), and mononymously as Bourvil, was a French actor and singer best known for his roles in comedy films, most notably in his collaboration with Louis de Funès in the films &quot;Le Corniaud&quot; (1965) and &quot;La Grande Vadrouille&quot; (1966). For his performance in &quot;Le Corniaud&quot;, he won a Special Diploma at the 4th Moscow International Film Festival.

== Biography ==
Bourvil&#x27;s father was killed in the First World War before he was born. As a result, he spent his entire childhood in the village of Bourville, from which he took his stage name. He married Jeanne Lefrique on 23 January 1943. After a battle with Kahler&#x27;s syndrome, which attacks the bone marrow, he died at the age of 53. He is buried in Montainville, Yvelines.
== Career ==
In his comic performances Bourvil principally played roles of gentle and well-meaning characters who were often a bit obtuse or naïve, such as his roles opposite the hyperactive, dishonest and bossy ones played by Louis de Funès. Bourvil&#x27;s characters not only managed to make viewers laugh, but also to save themselves, often unwittingly, from the Machiavellian designs of his adversaries.

Bourvil was, however, also capable of more dramatic roles such as the handyman in &quot;L&#x27;Arbre de Noël&quot; (1969). In this role he observes the relationship between a man he works for and the young son who has fallen ill. The audience can identify with the character played by Bourvil, just as they can in his comic roles, so often as a simple man. One can also note his role of Monsieur Thénardier in the film adaptation of &quot;Les Misérables&quot; (1958), and his penultimate role as the policeman Mattei in Jean-Pierre Melville&#x27;s &quot;Le Cercle rouge&quot; (1970).

In March 1948, Bourvil took part in the complete recording of Offenbach&#x27;s &quot;The Tales of Hoffmann&quot; with artists of the Paris Opéra-Comique conducted by André Cluytens, playing the four &#x27;servant&#x27; roles.

<text>Paul Andre Cyr (October 31, 1963 – May 12, 2012) was a Canadian professional ice hockey left wing who played for the Buffalo Sabres, New York Rangers and Hartford Whalers in the National Hockey League (NHL).

==Career==
Cyr began his career with the Nanaimo Clippers of the British Columbia Hockey League, for whom he played the 1979–80 season, and then the Victoria Cougars of the Western Hockey League from 1980 to 1982. He was a member of the first Canadian team to win a gold medal at the World Junior Hockey Championship in 1982. Cyr only made the team after being recalled due to another player&#x27;s injury. He scored in the Boxing Day game versus the Soviet Union. In the tournament, he scored a total of four goals and ten points in the ten games he played.

The Buffalo Sabres drafted Cyr ninth overall in the 1982 NHL Entry Draft. He made his debut for the Sabres that year, and played the next six seasons for the team, before being traded midway through the 1987–88 season to the New York Rangers in exchange for Mike Donnelly and a fifth round draft pick. After two injury-plagued seasons with the Rangers, Cyr signed as a free agent with the Hartford Whalers before the 1990–91 season. He had one successful year with the Whalers, appearing in 70 games and scoring 25 points. He was demoted to the Springfield Indians of the American Hockey League the subsequent year, where remained until his retirement in 1993.

Cyr played in a total of 470 games in the NHL over nine seasons, scoring 101 goals and 140 assists.

==Personal life and death==
In 1987, Cyr was shot in the stomach while vacationing in the Dominican Republic. He recovered. His house burned down during his retirement, which he rebuilt himself. Cyr died of heart failure in May 2012.

<text>Britannia Manor was the residence of game designer Richard Garriott. The name comes from the castle of Lord British, ruler of Britannia, the setting of the &quot;Ultima&quot; computer role playing game series, which he created. Britannia Manor was situated atop a large hill near Austin, Texas. The home was featured in a 2007 episode of the HGTV television series &quot;Secret Spaces&quot; on &quot;Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous&quot;, and on &quot;MTV Cribs&quot;.

Britannia Manor was also the name given to what has been called the world&#x27;s most famous haunted house, held in this location every two years from 1988 to 1994.

==Design==
The manor&#x27;s medieval design reflected Garriott&#x27;s interest in the era.

The house was adorned with various medieval items such as crossbows, swords, and armour. It features traps and a network of secret passages and rooms. A secret room in the basement contained some of Garriott&#x27;s most treasured artifacts, including dinosaur fossils, a coffin with a human skeleton inside it, and an authentic 16th century vampire hunting kit. The house also featured other collections such as hairs from the Glacier snowman, a brick from the Great Wall of China, a Russian spacesuit, and three stained glass windows retrieved from an abandoned church. There was a large collection of automatons. The basement room he referred to as the dungeon, had shrunken heads, mummified remains of parts of people as well as a mummified bird found in a tomb in Egypt, and human skulls.

The house also had an observatory in the main complex. Although part of the house, it was structurally independent from the rest of the house in order to damp out vibrations, as they ruined long-exposure space photos.

Britannia Manor was designed by designer/architect, Alan Barley, of Barley &amp; Pfeiffer Architects in Austin, Texas. In 1996, Garriott hired Moore-Andersson Architects, Austin, to design another house on a nearby riverfront property. The property was situated atop a bluff overlooking the Austin, Texas skyline, the 360 Bridge, and Lake Austin. Britannia Manor Mark 3 will also have a rotating observatory and will be more castle than house. Construction on this house was delayed for some time after the dot com crash. It resumed for a while a few years later, but was put on indefinite hold when Garriott decided in 2008 to spend the majority of his fortune to go into space.

There was a working cannon at the front door and an indoor grotto with hot-and-cold-running rain showers.

After spending several years on the market, the house was sold in December, 2014. The new owner demolished the house in late 2016.

==Haunt history==
Before 1995, Britannia Manor was famous for hosting the most elaborate haunted house in the US. Garriott spent a great deal of money biannually around Halloween to pay for makeup, tools, construction materials, special effects, and costumes for his haunted house. The actors and techs were all volunteers, many donating hundreds of hours for the honor of being a part of the show, and a free T-shirt. Only two men were paid to work on Britannia Manor, Greg Dykes and Keith Ewing, from local construction company Custom Creations. They oversaw and organized much of the specialized set construction. Invitations to what Garriott thought of as a giant house party were given away free, with the exception of a few shows where tickets were donated to charity and sold for $100 or more. People waited for as long as two weeks, camped out in front of Garriott&#x27;s house, to be first in line to receive the free invitations.

Britannia Manor was a full contact Halloween adventure. The events were designed like a role-playing game. Participants would go through Garriott&#x27;s mountain property in adventuring parties, gathering clues to solve mysteries and quests, while facing different perils and pitfalls. The actors would touch, grab, and physically as well as verbally interact with the guests, who could not simply wander through like in most haunted houses. They would have to swing, crawl, climb, and row their way out. It was not uncommon for parties to lose members in the course of the quest.

The format of an interactive full contact haunted adventure that Richard Garriott created has continued to this day. Many of the volunteers who worked on Britannia Manor, including Keith Ewing, formerly of Custom Creations, transferred Richard&#x27;s ideas and their talent and enthusiasm to support the Wild Basin Wilderness Preserve in Austin for nine years from 1996 to 2005 by creating Wild Basin&#x27;s Haunted Trails. Since 2007, many of those volunteers have, and continue to support SCARE for a CURE, a charity haunted house formerly in the Austin Elk&#x27;s Lodge, now in Lorane Ghost Town directed by Jarrett Crippen, aka The Defuser. SCARE for a CURE has now incorporated as a non-profit.

In 2009, SCARE for a CURE, now sponsored by Richard Garriott but still under the direction of Jarrett Crippen, was held in Garriott&#x27;s unfinished manor about half mile from the original manor, which he has dubbed Britannia Manor Mark 3 (Mark 1 being his original house in New Hampshire, and Mark 2 being his current residence).

==Curtain Theater==
On the waterfront portion of the property, Garriott had built a scaled replica of an Elizabethan outdoor theater called the Curtain, after the original Curtain Theatre. Capable of seating well over a hundred, Garriott&#x27;s Curtain theater was modeled after the style also replicated in full-scale by Sam Wanamaker&#x27;s Globe Theatre replica in Southwark, on the south bank of the Thames, in an area known as Bankside.

==Media coverage==
It was featured on an episode of &quot;MTV Cribs&quot;.

A free documentary was also made called &quot;The World&#x27;s Most Famous Haunted House: A Tribute to Britannia Manor&quot;.

==Burglar attack==
In 1997 the house was broken into by a deranged fan. Garriott held him off with an Uzi, firing a warning shot while waiting for police to arrive.

<text>Dragon Quest VII: Fragments of the Forgotten Past is a 2000 role-playing video game developed by Heartbeat and ArtePiazza, and published by Enix for the PlayStation. The game was produced by Yuji Horii, who has presided over the &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; series since its inception. Artwork and character designs were once again provided by Dragon Ball creator Akira Toriyama, the artist responsible for all previous &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; games. It was released in North America in 2001 under the title Dragon Warrior VII. The game received a remake on the Nintendo 3DS in Japan in 2013, released in English under the title &quot;Dragon Quest VII: Fragments of the Forgotten Past&quot; in 2016. A version of the game for Android and iOS was released in Japan in 2015.

The game follows the Hero and his friends as they discover secrets about the mysterious islands surrounding their home of Estard. Through some ancient ruins, they are transported to the pasts of various islands and must defeat evil in each new location. Game mechanics are largely unchanged from previous games in the series, although an extensive Class system allows players to customize their characters.

&quot;Dragon Quest VII: Fragments of the Forgotten Past&quot; is the seventh installment of the popular &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; series of role playing games, and is the successor to 1995&#x27;s &quot;Dragon Quest VI&quot; for the Super Famicom. An immediate success upon release, &quot;Dragon Warrior VII&quot;&#x27;s sales totalled 4.06 million by April 6, 2001, making it the best-selling PlayStation game in Japan, and is an Ultimate Hits title. It was the first main series &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; title to be released outside Japan since the release of &quot;Dragon Quest IV&quot; in North America in 1992, the last &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; title to be released in North America with the &quot;Dragon Warrior&quot; name, and the last &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; game outside of Japan to be published by Enix, before merging with Squaresoft in 2003 to form Square Enix.

== Gameplay ==

&quot;Dragon Quest VII&quot; is best known for its huge size. Without completing the game&#x27;s side quests, a single game of &quot;Dragon Quest VII&quot; can take a hundred hours or more. In terms of gameplay, not much has changed from previous installments; battles are still fought in a turn-based mode from a first person perspective. Although non-battle sequences are rendered in 3D, battles themselves are still portrayed two dimensionally. The ability to talk with the party characters in and outside of battles was added to this game. They offer advice about battle strategies and plot points, or simply comment on how they feel at a given moment. There are four ways and means of locomotion: walking (striding), sailing a boat, flying a magic carpet, or using an object known as the skystone. Each of these can move across different terrain; however, some are more limited than others.

The main flow of the game is different from the other &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; games; instead of exploring one large world, the party goes to separate continents by placing stone shards into their appropriate pedestals in Estard Fane. Once all of the missing shards are located and placed for a particular pedestal, the party is transported to the trapped location in the past. After solving whatever problems plague the location, the party then travels back to Estard, the beginning island. From there, they can travel via boat, carpet, or skystone to the modern version of the location they just saved. These saved lands appear on the main map, although the originals (from the past) can be revisited through the ruins.
Like most of the other &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; games, this game has several mini-games to participate in. The Immigrant Town, similar to the one in &quot;Dragon Quest IV&quot;, lets the player recruit people from various towns. They then live in the town, which changes depending on the type of people living there (e.g. several merchants will bring more stores to the town). A prominent feature in most &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; games is the casino. Poker, slot machines, and luck panel can all be played in &quot;Dragon Quest VII&quot;. The Ranking Association allows the player to compete for the highest stats, like the Beauty Competition from &quot;Dragon Quest VI&quot;. The player can also catch monsters, although they are only displayed in the Monster Park, unlike in &quot;Dragon Quest V&quot;, where monsters fought in the party. Blueprints are found to add new environments to the park.

=== Class system ===

&quot;Dragon Quest VII&quot; uses a class system for learning abilities, similar to that of &quot;Dragon Quest VI&quot;. Some available classes include Warrior, Fighter, Cleric, Mage, Bard, Dancer, Jester, Thief, Idol, Pirate, Ranger, Gladiator, Paladin, Summoner, God Hand (&quot;Champion&quot; in the localized 3DS version), and Hero, some of which are unlocked by mastering other classes. The game also includes monster classes, which can be unlocked by using the appropriate monster heart or mastering pre-requisite monster classes.

Characters generally stop learning character specific spells and skills around experience level 15; however, around this time in the game, players will reach Dharma Island, where they can give their characters certain classes. Each non-monster class belongs to one of three tiers (Basic, Intermediate, and Advanced), while monster classes have more tiers. Characters gain levels in classes by fighting a certain number of battles, as opposed to gaining experience points. Characters learn different spells and skills when they reach another class level and their stats are affected by what class they are. Once a character reaches the 8th and final level of a class, it is considered &quot;mastered&quot;, if a character masters certain classes, higher tier classes will become available to them. For example, if a character masters the Mage and Cleric classes, which are both Basic, then the Intermediate class Sage will be available to them. If that character was to then master the Teen Idol class, the Advanced Summoner class would open up.

== Plot and setting ==

=== Story ===

The story begins when the father of the protagonist brings home a map fragment from a fishing trip; this map suggests to the protagonist and his friend that the world had, at some point in its past, many continents, though now there is only the small island of . The two of them find a way to travel back to the past, when the continents still existed. The continents are facing serious problems that threaten their existence; the protagonist and his growing party work to resolve the problems, and when they do, the continents reappear in the present. When all the continents are finally restored, the party confronts the Demon Lord Orgodemir, who long ago defeated God (The Almighty in the 3DS English translation) and is responsible for the continents&#x27; disappearance. After his initial defeat, Orgodemir returns in the present and poses as God to trick humanity into worshiping him, then seals the continents away again. The party summons the Four Elemental Spirits to expose Orgodemir, then travels to the Dark Palace where they defeat Orgodemir in a final showdown.

=== Characters ===

* — The Hero has no default name; as is traditional in the &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; series, the name is supplied by the player (however, he is called Arus in the official manga and was given the name Auster in the 3DS English translation). The Hero is a lifelong native of the town of Fishbel (Pilchard Bay in the 3DS remake) on Estard Island. He is good friends with Maribel, daughter of the mayor of Fishbel, and Kiefer, prince of Estard Castle. In particular, he has a fondness for going out on impromptu &quot;adventures&quot; with Kiefer. It is one such adventure than begins the story of the game. In terms of gameplay, the Hero is a well-rounded character who is one of the strongest fighters in the game. He also lays claim to a variety of healing magics, and has fairly average statistical growth.
* — Kiefer is a prince of Estard, and the presumptive heir to the throne. Far from anticipating his elevation to kingship, however, Kiefer seems to resent his royal blood, and is a source of endless worry and frustration to his family and advisors. Kiefer, for his part, spends much of his time in search of excitement and adventure, and has found a kindred spirit in the Hero, whom he considers his closest friend. Kiefer is incredibly strong, with a high physical attack statistic and naturally high hit points (HP). He is the most powerful character available early on in the game. On one trip to an ancient land, Kiefer falls in love, and remains behind. Upon returning to the present, the hero finds out that Kiefer became a famous guardian of the Dejan tribe, and is the biological ancestor of almost an entire culture/continent. Kiefer is also the main character of the game &quot;Dragon Quest Monsters: Caravan Heart&quot;.
* known as Maribel Mayde in the 3DS English translation — A friend of both the Hero and Kiefer, Maribel is the daughter of the mayor of Fishbel. Unlike Kiefer, who has steadfastly refused to let his social status influence how he looks upon other people, Maribel tends to be a bit condescending, even bossy. Despite this, she has a kind, sentimental side and gets along well with her friends, and occasionally accompanies them on their adventuring, even if she sometimes has to pressure them into letting her tag along. Maribel is primarily a magic user: with low starting physical statistics, and an early lack of powerful weapons available for her use, it takes a good deal of time before she can do anything approaching the amount of physical damage inflicted by some of the other characters. On the other hand, Maribel has access to a variety of damaging attack spells relatively early on. She is forced to leave the party when her father falls ill, but unlike Kiefer, she can rejoin them later on.
* known as Ruff in the 3DS English translation — Although he appears normal, Gabo is actually a white wolf pup who was irrevocably turned into a boy. As such, he retains a number of obvious lupine characteristics, and can be somewhat animalistic at times. He agrees to travel with the heroes hoping to protect his family, but remains with the group out of a sense of loyalty. In contrast to Maribel, Gabo&#x27;s specialty is in physical combat. Despite his diminutive size, he can easily become as powerful as the Hero, Melvin, and Aira through mastery of the class system.
* known as Mervyn in the 3DS English translation — A skilled paladin of generations past, Melvin fought on the side of God against the Demon Lord many years ago. Melvin excelled at his work, and distinguished himself in both skill and honor. As such, Melvin was petrified in stone by God, so that, should the need arise, he could be reawakened to once again take up the fight against evil. The party finds Melvin, who joins their adventure, although his age and unfamiliarity with the present day often leave other characters somewhat befuddled. Melvin is proficient at both magic and physical combat, though his magic casting abilities are slightly superior to his physical attack skills.
* known as Aishe in the 3DS English translation — Aira is the lead ritual dancer of the Deja tribe, an ancient race of people charged with the stewardship of a temple necessary in the act of calling forth God. Raised and trained at swordsmanship, Aira is a more than capable fighter, as well. But, for all her skills, Aira harbors a secret from her past that weighs heavily upon her soul. Aira is a powerful fighter and magic user. Although capable of doing both significant physical and significant magical damage, Aira stands in contrast to Melvin, in that her magic skills tend to lag slightly behind her physical statistics.

== Development and release ==

&quot;Dragon Quest VII&quot; was designed by series creator Yuji Horii and directed by Manabu Yamana. Shintaro Majima signed on as art director, while series veterans Akira Toriyama and Koichi Sugiyama designed the characters and composed the music respectively. The game was officially announced in 1996 and originally expected to be released for the Nintendo 64DD. On January 15, 1997, it was announced that development had been moved to the PlayStation. By the next day, both stock in Sony and Enix rose significantly in Japan. In turn, the move to the PlayStation was described as a &quot;semi-crisis situation&quot; for Nintendo, with Japanese stock analysts and industry observers losing faith in the long-term viability of the Nintendo 64 line. Enix cited the larger potential market and lower cost of manufacturing CDs as the reasons for the change of platform. By 2000, &quot;Dragon Quest VII&quot; was predicted to be so successful in Japan that it would &quot;create a 50 billion yen effect on the Japanese economy&quot;, said research firm DIHS. &quot;Dragon Quest VII&quot; would go on to be released on August 26, 2000 and sold 4.06 million games in Japan alone, becoming one of the highest selling games of all time.

The game was delayed numerous times before its actual release. Work on the game was extended because the development staff wanted to perfect the game due to high expectations from the fans and because the team only consisted of about 35 people. Before its release, it was ranked as the most wanted game in Japan and Square, knowing about &quot;Dragon Quest VII&#x27;s&quot; release, moved &quot;Final Fantasy IX&quot; to come out on a later date. Horii stated in an interview that the team focused more on puzzle solving than the game&#x27;s story. Being the first game in the series to include 3D graphics, the team was also initially reluctant to include CG movies and cinematics due to letters written to Enix by fans fearing that doing so would change the overall feeling of the series.

The English language localization of &quot;Dragon Warrior VII&quot; began directly after the game&#x27;s Japanese release. Enix of America was tasked with translating over 70,000 pages of text via 20 translators and 5 copy editors. No effort was made to edit or censor the context of the Japanese script. Weeks prior to the game&#x27;s US release, Enix released new information about the game&#x27;s different mechanics on their website weekly to introduce players to the game. Paul Handelman, president of Enix America, commented on the game that &quot;All the talk this month about new systems with the latest technological wizardry doesn&#x27;t diminish the fact that at the end of the day, compelling game play is what it&#x27;s all about, and Dragon Warrior VII provides just that.&quot; &quot;Dragon Warrior VII&quot; was released in the US on November 1, 2001 and was the last game in the series to have &quot;Warrior&quot; in its title instead of &quot;Quest&quot;. In 2003, Square Enix registered the &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; trademark in the US, with the intent to retire the &quot;Dragon Warrior&quot; name. Soon after the game&#x27;s release, developer Heartbeat went on hiatus. Justin Lucas, product manager of Enix America, commented on the hiatus, saying that the developer merely &quot;worked their tails off on Dragon Warrior 7 and Dragon Warrior 4. They decided to take a sabbatical for a while and rest up&quot;, noting that it had nothing to do with the game&#x27;s US sales.

The back of the &quot;Dragon Warrior VII&quot; manual in North America contained an advertisement for &quot;Dragon Warrior IV&quot;, an enhanced remake for the PlayStation of a Nintendo game of the same name. The localization was later cancelled, due to Heartbeat&#x27;s closure.

=== Remake ===

On October 30, 2012 Square Enix announced that they were remaking &quot;Dragon Quest VII&quot; exclusively for the Nintendo 3DS and that it would be released in Japan in February 2013. Later that day, Square Enix confirmed that the release date would be February 7, 2013 for Japan. Similarly to &quot;Dragon Quest IX&quot;, the game features visible enemy encounters instead of random encounters, unique backgrounds and enemies that have individual attack characteristics. The remake was originally not intended for a release outside of Japan, in part due to the sheer cost and time needed to localize the game&#x27;s substantial content. After numerous letters from core &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; fans in France, as well as Square Enix and Nintendo executives, the decision was made to release the 3DS port worldwide. In the November 2015 Nintendo Direct, it was shown that &quot;Dragon Quest VII&quot; would be coming outside Japan in 2016, with the new subtitle &quot;Fragments of the Forgotten Past&quot;. The international release of the 3DS remake contained a completely retranslated script which followed the localization style of games since Square Enix&#x27;s release of &quot;Dragon Quest VIII&quot; in 2005, including numerous name and terminology changes for characters from the original &quot;Dragon Warrior VII&quot; release. The Western release also replaced the orchestral score from the Japanese release, performed by the Tokyo Metropolitan Symphony Orchestra, with the synthesized MIDI soundtrack that had been used in the Japan-only iOS and Android versions of the game, released in 2015.

== Other media ==

=== Soundtrack ===

As with nearly every &quot;Dragon Quest&quot; game, Koichi Sugiyama composed the musical score. As was done for &quot;Dragon Quest VI&quot;, the original sound version was bundled with the symphonic suite in a two-disc set called &quot;Dragon Quest VII: Eden no Senshitachi Symphonic Suite + OST&quot;. The entire first disc and the opening track of the second disc consists of the symphonic suite, while the rest of the second disc is the original sound version. The &quot;Symphonic Suite&quot; was released alone on Super Audio CD later that year, and re-released in 2009. A disc titled &quot;Dragon Quest VII: Eden no Senshitachi on Piano&quot; was also released, and contained 27 piano-arranged tracks. The &quot;Symphonic Suite&quot; was later re-recorded in 2006 along with the rest of the music from the series. An original soundtrack for the 3DS remake was released on March 19, 2014, and features the original recordings by the Tokyo Metropolitan Symphony Orchestra from the Japanese version of the remake.

=== Manga ===

The manga adaptation of &quot;Dragon Quest VII&quot; was published by Enix&#x27;s &quot;Monthly Gangan&quot; in Japan. It was illustrated by Kamui Fujiwara, who also worked on another franchise-related manga, &quot;Dragon Quest Retsuden: Roto no Monshō&quot;. Fourteen volumes were released between 2001 and 2006, though the series is currently on hiatus. In this adaptation, the hero is given the name &quot;Arus&quot;. The manga follows the game story while adding in new characters and more detailed relationships, as the original hero was silent and a personality needed to be added for the comic version.

== Reception ==

&quot;Dragon Warrior VII&quot; received both commercial and critical success in Japan. units were sold within 17 days of the game&#x27;s release; the game established itself for having the largest annual shipment of any independently sold game for the original PlayStation. It was the best-selling PlayStation game of 2000 in the region, having sold more than copies by November. Shipments of &quot;Dragon Quest VII&quot; reached four million copies on January 5, 2001, and the game became the sixth best-seller video game of all platforms in Japan at that time. Worldwide, shipments of the game have surpassed 4.1 million units as of March 2003. &quot;Dragon Warrior VII&quot; won the grand prize in Digital (Interactive) Art Division at the 4th Japan Media Arts Festival in 2000, where the game was praised for being &quot;...engaging without depending on a high degree of realism...&quot; and &quot;...well refined and artfully executed.&quot; The game also won four awards from the 5th Japan Entertainment Software Awards by the Computer Entertainment Supplier&#x27;s Association (CESA), including Best Prize, Scenario Prize, Sales Prize, and Popularity Prize. In 2006, the readers of &quot;Famitsu&quot; magazine voted &quot;Dragon Warrior VII&quot; the 9th best video game of all time.

Sales of the North American version of &quot;Dragon Warrior VII&quot; reached almost 200,000 copies according to The Magic Box, which was not nearly as stellar as its Japanese counterpart. Enix of America still expressed their satisfaction with the sales figures. &quot;Dragon Warrior VII&quot; met with mostly positive reviews from North American critics. IGN noted that all &quot;100+ hours&quot; of the game are enjoyable despite the dated visuals and clunky presentation. GameZone.com praised the game&#x27;s concept and nostalgia factor and cited it as &quot;what role-playing games were meant to be.&quot; They also noted the game&#x27;s high difficulty, which, instead of making the game frustrating, they say, &quot;make it that much more of an accomplishment when you complete a quest.&quot; IGN described the game&#x27;s class system as &quot;one of the best class systems seen outside a strategy RPG.&quot;

Other critics were not as pleased with &quot;Dragon Warrior VII&quot;. GameShark.com described the first two hours of the game as &quot;some of the most boring hours you will ever play in a video game.&quot; XenGamers.com also pointed out that in order to play the game, the player needs &quot;the patience of a rock&quot;. &quot;Game Informer&quot; even went as far as to say that &quot;four million Japanese can be wrong&quot;, referring to the game&#x27;s immense popularity in Japan. Because of the game&#x27;s delay in being developed, its release was after the PlayStation 2&#x27;s release, which created some negative feedback, particularly about the game&#x27;s graphics. IGN commented on this, calling the game &quot;a game that makes only a bare minimum of concessions to advancing technology, but more than makes up for this with its deep gameplay, massive quest, and sheer variety.&quot; GameSpot called the graphics &quot;not good&quot; and warned readers that if the &quot;most rewarding things&quot; they &quot;got out of Final Fantasy VII were the full-motion video interludes, you definitely won&#x27;t be wowed by anything you see in Dragon Warrior VII.&quot;

Eric Bratcher reviewed the PlayStation version of the game for &quot;Next Generation&quot;, rating it four stars out of five, and stated that &quot;The harder-core you are, the more you&#x27;ll love this definitely old-school RPG, but graphics hounds and those with short attention spans can sit this one out.&quot;

Sales of the Nintendo 3DS remake exceeded 800,000 copies the first week in Japan. As of March 17, 2013, the remake has sold 1,174,077 copies. Famitsu rated the remake a 35/40, praising the new orchestrated score as well as the improved graphics, intro and first dungeon.

<text>Leopold Ružička (; born Lavoslav Stjepan Ružička; 13 September 1887 – 26 September 1976) was a Croatian-Swiss scientist and joint winner of the 1939 Nobel Prize in Chemistry &quot;for his work on polymethylenes and higher terpenes&quot; &quot;including the first chemical synthesis of male sex hormones.&quot; He worked most of his life in Switzerland, and received eight doctorates &quot;honoris causa&quot; in science, medicine, and law; seven prizes and medals; and twenty-four honorary memberships in chemical, biochemical, and other scientific societies.

==Early life==
Ružička was born in Vukovar (until 1918 in the Austria-Hungary, today in Croatia). His family of craftsmen and farmers was mostly of Croat origin, with a Czech great-grandparent, Ružička, and a great-grandmother and a great-grandfather from Austria. He lost his father, Stjepan, at the age of four, and his mother, Amalija Sever, took him and his younger brother Stjepan, to live in Osijek.

Ružička attended the classics program secondary school in Osijek. He changed his original idea of becoming a priest and switched to studying technical disciplines. Chemistry was his choice, probably because he hoped to get a position at the newly opened sugar refinery built in Osijek.

Owing to the excessive hardship of everyday and political life, he left and chose the High Technical School in Karlsruhe in Germany. He was a good student in areas he liked and that he thought would be necessary and beneficial in the future, which was organic chemistry. That is why his physical chemistry professor, Fritz Haber (Nobel laureate in 1918), opposed his &quot;summa cum laude&quot; degree. However, in the course of his studies, Ružička set up excellent cooperation with Hermann Staudinger (a Nobel laureate in 1953). Studying within Staudinger&#x27;s department, he obtained his doctoral degree in 1910, then moved to Zürich as Staudinger&#x27;s assistant.

==Career in research==
Ružička&#x27;s first works originated in the field of chemistry of natural compounds. He remained in this field of research all his life. He investigated the ingredients of the Dalmatian insect powder Pyrethrum (from the herb &quot;Tanacetum cinerariifolium&quot;), a highly esteemed insecticide found in pyrethrins, which were the focus of his work with Staudinger. Ružička later said of this time: &quot;Toward the end of five and a half years of mainly synthetic work on the pyrethrins I had come to the firm conclusion that we were barking up the wrong tree.&quot; In this way, he came into contact with the chemistry of Terpineol, a fragrant oil of vegetable origin, interesting to the perfume industry. He and Staudinger split company when he started cooperation with the Chuit &amp; Naef Company (later known as Firmenich) in Geneva.

In 1916–1917, he received the support of the oldest perfume manufacturer in the world &quot;Haarman &amp; Reimer&quot;, of Holzminden, Germany. He became a Swiss citizen in 1917, and published his Habilitation in 1918. Fornasir and he isolated linalool in 1919.

With expertise in the terpene field, he became senior lecturer in 1918, and in 1923, honorary professor at the ETH (Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule) as well as the University of Zurich. Here, with a group of his doctoral students, he proved the structure of the compounds muscone and civetone, macrocyclic ketone scents derived from the musk deer (&quot;Moschus moschiferus&quot;) and the civet cat (&quot;Viverra civetta&quot;). These were the first natural products shown to have rings with more than six atoms, and at the time that Ružička inferred that civetone as having a 17-member ring. Synthetic techniques at the time were only known for rings of up to eight members. Muscone had been isolated in 1904 but was not identified as 3-methylcyclopentadecanone until Ružička suspected a macrocycle, having characterised civetone. He also developed a method for synthesising macrocycles, now known as the Ružička large ring synthesis, which he demonstrated by preparing civetone in 1927.
In 1921, the Geneva perfume manufacturers Chuit &amp; Naef asked him to collaborate. Working here, Ružička achieved financial independence, but not as big as he had planned, so he left Zürich to start working for the Basel-based CIBA. In 1927, he took over the organic chemistry chair at Utrecht University in the Netherlands. In the Netherlands, he remained for three years and then returned to Switzerland, which was superior in its chemical industry. A synergistic upheaval in both the administration and chemistry departments coincided to make his good fortune.

Ružička was the first to synthesize musk at an industrial scale. Firmenech named this product Exaltone. Other Swiss manufacturers and DuPont were in competition with them.

In 1934, Ružička synthesized the male hormone androsterone and also proved &quot;its constitutional and configurational relation to the sterols.&quot; This was followed in 1935 by the partial synthesis of the much more active male hormone testosterone. Both discoveries led to the pre-eminence of the Swiss industry in the steroid hormone field. At ETH Zurich he became a professor of organic chemistry and started the most brilliant period of his professional career. He widened the area of his research, adding to it the chemistry of higher terpenes and steroids. After the successful synthesis in 1935 of sex hormones (androsterone and testosterone), his laboratory became the world centre of organic chemistry. He was awarded in 1936 an honorary degree from Harvard University.

In 1939 he won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry with Adolf Butenandt. Over the period 1934–1939 he published 70 papers in the field of medicinally important steroid sex hormones, and filed several dozen patents besides.

In 1940, following the award, he was invited by the Croatian Chemical Association, where he delivered a lecture to an over-packed hall of dignitaries. The topic of the lecture was &quot;From the Dalmatian Insect Powder to Sex Hormones&quot;. In 1940 he became a foreign member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences, in 1942 he was elected a foreign member of the Royal Society, and in 1944 he became an international member of the US National Academy of Sciences. During World War II, some of his excellent collaborators were lost, but Ružička restructured his laboratory with new, younger and promising people; among them was young scientist and future Nobel laureate Vladimir Prelog. With new people and ideas new research areas were opened.
In 1946, Ružička and Lardon &quot;established that the fragrance of ambergris is based on the triterpene (named) ambrein&quot;.

Following 1950, Ružička returned to chemistry, which had entered a new era of research. Now he turned to the field of biochemistry, the problems of evolution and the genesis of life, particularly to the biogenesis of terpenes. In 1953, he published his hypothesis, the &quot;Biogenetic Isoprene Rule&quot; (that the carbon skeleton of terpenes is composed variously of regularly or irregularly linked isoprene units), which was the peak of his scientific career. In 1952, Oskar Jeger and he supervised a team which isolated lanosterol and established the link between terpenes and steroids. Ružička retired in 1957, turning over the running of the laboratory to Prelog.

==Later life, legacy, honours and awards==
Ružička was the recipient of eight honorary doctorates and the 1938 Marcel Benoist Prize. He was listed as an author on 583 scientific papers. In 1965, he became an honorary member of the Polish Chemical Society, and he was an honorary member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. After the war he acquired a taste for Dutch masterpieces, which he later lodged in the Kunsthaus Zürich as the Ružička collection. He militated against nuclear weapons.

In 1970, Ružička delivered to the Nobel Laureate Conferences in Lindau a lecture entitled &quot;Nobel Prizes and the chemistry of life&quot;.

In later years, he served as a consultant to Sandoz A. G. of Basel.

Ružička dedicated significant efforts to the problems of education. He insisted on a better organization of academic education and scientific work in the new Yugoslavia, and established the Swiss-Yugoslav Society. Ružička became an honorary academician at the then Yugoslav Academy of Sciences and Arts in Zagreb.

In 1974 he was awarded the Order of the Yugoslav Flag with Golden Wreath.

At ETH Zurich, the Ružička Award was established in 1957 on the occasion of his retirement, for young chemists working in Switzerland.

In his native Vukovar, a museum was opened in his honour in 1977.

Ružička&#x27;s archives are kept at ETH Zurich.

The Ružička reaction is named after him.

===Personal life===
Ružička married twice: to Anna Hausmann in 1912, and in 1951 to Gertrud Acklin. From 1929, he lived at Freudenbergstrasse 101 until the last years of his life. He died in Mammern, Switzerland, a village on Lake Constance at the age of 89.

<text>Ogbomosho (also known as Ogbomoso and Ògbómọ̀ṣọ́) is a city in Oyo State, south-western Nigeria. It was founded in the mid 17th century. The population was approximately 655,517 in 2024. It is the second largest city in Oyo State and also among the most populated in Nigeria. It is the 3rd most populated city in South Western Nigeria after Lagos and Ibadan. The City itself has 5 local governments, which makes it one of the largest cities in Nigeria. And the city is set to be the capital of the newly proposed state &quot;OYO STATE&quot;. Although the principal inhabitants of the city are the Yoruba people, there are people from other parts of Nigeria and other West African countries who are residents in the city.

==History==
Ọlábánjọ Ògúnlọlá Ògúndìran was of Ibariba descent. He and his wife, Esuu, built their hut by the side of the Àjàgbọn tree.

According to an early missionary, &quot;Ògbómọ̀ṣọ́ in 1891 was a walled city, the gates of which were closely watched by day and securely closed by night. The town, picturesque and well watered was isolated from the rest of the Yoruba towns. Political relations were maintained with the Ibadans, for the country depended on its security on the warriors of Ògbómọ̀ṣọ́ and Ikirun...The strength of Ògbómọ̀ṣọ́ lay in the wall and moat surrounding the town, and the warriors made full use of it by sitting close and tight..&quot;

The area that is called Ògbómọ̀ṣọ́ today is between Igbọ́n and Ìrẹṣà—Arẹṣà to the west; Oníkòyí to the East; Olúgbọ́n to the north; and Tìmì of Ẹdẹ to its south direction—according to Ògbómọ̀ṣọ́ History and Origin Documentary by Israel Ayanwuyi.

Ògúnlọlá (later Ṣọ̀ún) noticed smoke oozing from some nearby locations. He took courage and approached these places and discovered other hunters. There is no more Baálẹ̀ Akandíẹ̀.
Ogunlola, after the discovery of these hunters, took the initiative to invite them to form the Alongo Society. The primary objectives of the society were:
defence against Sunmoni (slave prowlers) raids
group hunting of wild animals, and
mutual assistance.
After each day&#x27;s hunting, they retired to Ogunlola&#x27;s hut where they were treated to beans and other meals and were served with Sekete wine brewed by Ogunlola&#x27;s wife from fermented guinea corn. They also engaged in discussing current affairs and planning.

Esuu, the wife of Ogunlola, introduced the worship of Orisapopo to Ogbomosho. The worshippers were distinguished by white beads worn round their necks and wearing of white dresses only. Drinking of palm wine was forbidden to them. The name Orisapopo was probably derived from the fact that Ogunlola&#x27;s hut was on the northsouthern route, therefore the Orisala being worshipped in the hut was named &quot;Orisapopo&quot; (idol by the highway). The importance and influence of &#x27;Orisapopo&#x27; among the citizens of Ogbomoso is immense. It can be described as the patron Òrìṣà of Ògbómọ̀ṣọ́.
During the time, the Ibaribas, under the leadership of Elemoso, attacked Oyo-Ile near Ilorin city. Elemoso caused a devastating havoc among the Oyo people, so much that they feared him in battle. Elemoso consequently laid total siege on Oyo, causing famine and untold hardship among the people.

Alaafin was so impressed by Ogunlola&#x27;s prowess that he, the Alaafin, requested Ogunlola to stay in the capital (Oyo-Ile) instead of returning to his settlement. Ogunlola politely declined saying &quot;Ejeki a ma se ohun&quot; meaning &quot;let me manage the that place.&quot; His majesty, the Alaafin, granted Ogunlola&#x27;s wish to return to his settlement. This was later contracted to Ogbomoso.

Eventually, the authority of Ogunlola became greater and more respected. His compound by the Ajagbon tree then became the Soun&#x27;s palace and a rallying point for all Ogbomoso citizens.

Ogbomosho, because of her strategic location, quickly grew from a village status to a medium size town. Her people were also renown warriors. During the Fulani wars of the 19th century, many towns and villages (about 147) were deserted while their people took refuge in Ogbomosho. The influx of people further enhanced the size and strength of the town.

===Alagba the sacred tortoise===
Alagba is believed to have been born in the year 1675 in the old Oyo town, which is now being referred to as Ogbomoso. He was reputedly said to have been brought from the forest by the third Soun of Ogbomoso, Oba Ikumoyede who ruled from 1770 until 1797. In deference to its age, it is called Alagba, which means &quot;the elderly one&quot; in Yoruba. In Ogbomoso, where the legendary tortoise lumbers about in the palatial grounds of the king, it is almost a sacrilege to refer to Alagba as a mere tortoise. The tortoise played host to many monarchs in Ogbomoso in the past.

The sacred tortoise, which was believed to be the oldest in Africa, was sick for a few days before her demise on 5 October 2019.

The palace household, Ogbomoso community and stakeholders in the tourism sector are reportedly mourning Alagba&#x27;s passage because of the great impact left behind. Plans are underway to preserve Alagba&#x27;s body for historical records.( by Timothy copy )

==List of Monarchs==

<text>Leon Botstein (born December 14, 1946, in Zürich, Switzerland) is a Swiss-born American conductor, educator, historical musicologist, and scholar serving as the President of Bard College.

== Biography ==
Botstein was born in Zürich, Switzerland, in 1946. The son of Polish-Jewish physicians, Botstein immigrated to New York City at the age of two. He studied violin with Roman Totenberg and, during the summers, studied with faculty from the National Conservatory in Mexico City. 

In 1963, at age 16, Botstein graduated from the High School of Music and Art in Manhattan. He graduated from the University of Chicago in 1967 with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in history. While an undergraduate, he was concertmaster and assistant conductor of the university orchestra and founded its chamber orchestra. His music teachers in college included composer Richard Wernick and the musicologists H. Colin Slim and Howard Mayer Brown. In 1967, after studying at Tanglewood, Botstein attended Harvard University, where he studied history under David Landes, writing on musical life of Vienna in the 19th and early 20th centuries, earning an MA in 1968. At Harvard, he was the assistant conductor of the Harvard Radcliffe Orchestra and conductor of the Doctors&#x27; Orchestra of Boston.

In 1969, while a graduate student, Botstein was awarded a Sloan Foundation Fellowship and began work for New York City Mayor John V. Lindsay’s administration as special assistant to the president of the Board of Education of the City of New York. In 1970, at age 23, Botstein became the youngest college president in history after being appointed president of the now-defunct Franconia College in New Hampshire. He was offered the position after meeting his future father-in-law, Oliver Lundquist, who was on the board of trustees. 

== President of Bard College ==
In 1975, Botstein left Franconia to become the president of Bard College, a position he still holds. He oversaw significant curricular changes, and, under his leadership, Bard saw record gains in enrollment, campus growth, endowment, institutional reach, and high-profile faculty. Botstein directed the launch of the Levy Economics Institute, a public-policy research center, as well as graduate programs in the fine arts, decorative arts, environmental policy, and curatorial studies; soon thereafter, he helped acquire Bard College at Simon&#x27;s Rock and later founded Bard High School Early College, which operates in seven cities: Newark, New York City, Cleveland, Washington D.C., Baltimore, New Orleans, and Hudson.

In the wake of the death of his second child, an 8-year-old daughter, Botstein decided to return to the musical career he had begun at University of Chicago. In 1985, he completed his Ph.D. in music history at Harvard and began retraining as a conductor with Harold Farberman, eventually leading the Hudson Valley Philharmonic Chamber Orchestra.

===1990–present: Festivals, international programs, and conducting===
 In 1990, Botstein established the Bard Music Festival, whose success led to the development of the critically acclaimed Richard B. Fisher Center for the Performing Arts, a multi-functional facility designed by Frank Gehry on the Bard campus. In 1992, in addition to being named editor of &quot;The Musical Quarterly&quot;, he was appointed director of the American Symphony Orchestra, a position he still holds. Under Botstein&#x27;s directorship, the orchestra has developed a reputation for rescuing lesser-known works from obscurity. In 1999, he helped establish Bard’s acclaimed Prison Initiative, which established college-in-prison programs across the country and is now active in nine states.

In 2003, following the success of the Bard Music Festival, Botstein developed Bard SummerScape, a festival of opera, theater, film, and music, where, since its founding, he has revived 13 rare operas in full staging. Later that year, Botstein became the music director of the Jerusalem Symphony Orchestra. His concerts with the Jerusalem Symphony Orchestra were broadcast in regular series across the U.S. and Europe, and he led the orchestra on several tours, including twice across the U.S. and to Leipzig to open the 2009 Bach Festival with a performance of Felix Mendelssohn’s Elijah in Bach’s Thomaskirche. In 2011, he stepped down from that post and became the Jerusalem Symphony Orchestra&#x27;s Conductor Laureate and, as of 2022, also serves as its Principal Guest Conductor. In addition to his work with the ASO and JSO, Botstein has performed or recorded with, among many others, the London Philharmonic Orchestra, New York City Opera, Los Angeles Philharmonic, BBC Symphony Orchestra, London Symphony Orchestra, Buffalo Philharmonic Orchestra, St. Petersburg Philharmonic Orchestra, Mariinsky Theatre Orchestra, and NDR Symphony Orchestra. In 2005, his recording of Gavriil Popov’s First Symphony with the London Symphony Orchestra was nominated for a Grammy Award.

Throughout this period, in collaboration with institutions abroad, Botstein helped launch liberal arts programs to countries in Eastern Europe, the former Soviet Union, South Africa, Central Asia, and the Middle East. He established programs with Al Quds University, American University of Central Asia, and Central European University, as well as helping found Bard College Berlin and Smolny College, Russia&#x27;s first and foremost liberal arts institution.

Botstein also turned his attention to developing Bard&#x27;s music program. In 2005, he oversaw the development of The Bard College Conservatory of Music and later became director of The Bard Conservatory Orchestra. During this period, he also helped Bard acquire the Longy School of Music, and led The Bard Conservatory Orchestra on tours of China, Eastern Europe, and Cuba. In addition to conducting for the Youth Orchestra of Caracas in Venezuela and on tour in Japan, Botstein also helped develop Take a Stand, a national music program in the U.S. based on principles of El Sistema. In 2015, he founded The Orchestra Now, a pre-professional orchestra and master’s degree program at Bard College; in addition to performing multiple concerts each season at Carnegie Hall and Lincoln Center, The Orchestra Now performs a regular concert series at Bard&#x27;s Fisher Center and takes part in Bard Music Festival concerts.

In 2016, Botstein received $150,000 as a donation to Bard College from the foundation Gratitude America, which was founded by financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, according to articles in &quot;The New York Times&quot; and &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;. At the time, Botstein was on the charity&#x27;s advisory board.

In 2018, Botstein was appointed artistic director of Campus Grafenegg in Austria, where he collaborated with Thomas Hampson and Dennis Russell Davies. On January 23, 2020, he was named chancellor of the Open Society University Network, of which Bard College and Central European University are founding members.

In 2019, Botstein appeared in the documentary &quot;College Behind Bars&quot;, a four-part television series about the Bard Prison Initiative, a degree program offered to inmates in New York prisons. The series was produced by his daughter, Sarah Botstein, who works for Ken Burns&#x27;s documentary production company.

== Musicianship ==
Botstein is renowned for reviving and promoting neglected repertoire and composers. In addition, as director of the American Symphony Orchestra and the Jerusalem Symphony Orchestra, he emerged as a significant proponent of &quot;thematic programming&quot;, which assembles concert programs around common themes grounded in literature, music history, or art. He is also known for the series &quot;Classics Declassified&quot;, in which he lectures, conducts, and takes questions from the audience. Both the Bard Music Festival and Bard SummerScape continue his method of reviving neglected works and synthesizing performance and scholarship. The &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; Barrymore Laurence Scherer wrote, &quot;the Bard Music Festival…no longer needs an introduction. Under the provocative guidance of the conductor-scholar Leon Botstein, it has long been one of the most intellectually stimulating of all American summer festivals and frequently is one of the most musically satisfying. Each year, through discussions by major scholars and illustrative concerts often programmed to overflowing, Bard audiences have investigated the oeuvre of a major composer in the context of the society, politics, literature, art and music of his times.&quot;

== Scholarship and writings ==
Botstein&#x27;s scholarship focuses on the intersection of music, culture, and politics since the early 19th century. He has written books including &quot;Judentum und Modernitaet&quot; and &quot;Von Beethoven zu Berg: Das Gedächtnis der Moderne&quot; (2013) and &quot;The History of Listening: How Music Creates Meaning&quot; (2000). 

In addition, he is coeditor of &quot;Vienna: Jews and the City of Music, 1870-1938,&quot; published in 2004, and editor of &quot;The Complete Brahms: A Guide to the Musical Works of Johannes&quot; (1999).

Botstein&#x27;s essays for The Bard Music Festival are published as a series in the Princeton University Press. He has been editor of The Musical Quarterly since 1993 and a frequent contributor to periodicals focusing on music and history. 

Botstein also writes frequently on primary and secondary education and universities: in addition to the book &quot;Jefferson&#x27;s Children: Education and the Promise of American Culture&quot; (1997), he is the author of numerous articles on education in the United States.

== Personal life ==
Botstein is the brother of biologist David Botstein and pediatric cardiologist Eva Griepp. Both of his parents were physicians who, after emigrating to the U.S., served on faculty of the Einstein College of Medicine in New York. 

He is the husband of art historian Barbara Haskell. They have two children: Clara Haskell Botstein, director of legislation and governmental relations at the D.C. office of the deputy mayor for education, and Max Botstein.

Botstein and his first wife, Jill Lundquist, are the parents of Sarah Botstein, who produced the documentary &quot;College Behind Bars&quot;, and Abby Botstein (1973-1981).

<text>Picigin () is traditional ball game from Split, Croatia that is played at the beach. It is an amateur sport played in shoals or other shallow water, usually consisting of cooperating players keeping a small ball from falling in the water.

==Origin==

Picigin originated on the sandy beach of Bačvice in Split. It was first played in 1908 by a group of Croatian students returning from Prague who were finding it difficult to play the game of water polo in shallow water. Instead, they began playing a different game which would come to be known as picigin.

==Game characteristics==
The game involves several players in a circle batting around a small ball with their hands; the objective is to keep the ball in the air and out of the water for as long as possible. Players are not allowed to catch the ball, but bounce it around with the palm of the hand to others. As such, the game somewhat resembles net-less volleyball, but it is played with a much smaller ball, usually a tennis ball stripped of felt. There is no set number of players, though five is usually average and customary. The game calls for agility as there is a lot of jumping and leaping involved in order to reach the ball in certain situations. As all players cooperate, the game by default is considered a non-competitive sport with no scoring system. 

===Rules===
Since picigin is an amateur sport, there are no strict or formal rules, but it is played according to general tradition with little variation. The main goal in the most popular variant is to keep ball in the air without it falling in the water for as long as possible. In some game variants, a player is only allowed to touch the ball once or twice before passing it on to others, as in volleyball.

===Players===
There is no limit on the number of players, but the game is usually played with five players who stand as to form points of a pentagram-like shape. There are two traditional player roles or positions – &quot;sidrun&quot; and &quot;trkač&quot;. Two &quot;sidrun&quot; (pl. &quot;sidruni&quot;, Chakavian Croatian for &quot;anchor&quot;) players remain anchored to their position and ensure that ball passing is stable while the other three players play as &quot;trkač&quot; (pl. &quot;trkači&quot;, Croatian for &quot;runner&quot;), tasked with chasing after and saving loose balls. The game does not call for any physical characteristics for either role, but &quot;trkač&quot; roles are optimally taken up by more agile players with higher stamina while &quot;sidrun&quot; role calls for above average height.

===Terrain===
As picigin often sees players jumping and landing on their body, it requires a soft surface in shoal or other shallow water to be played as intended without possibility of serious injury; this is usually a shallow sandy beach. Preferred depth is roughly ankle-deep for all players as to not greatly hinder movement.

===Ball===
Picigin is played with various small balls. However, the traditional ball, called &quot;balun&quot; (Chakavian Croatian for &quot;ball&quot;) is actually a tennis ball that has been stripped of its felt and polished off a few millimeters. As such, the &quot;balun&quot; is smoother, lighter and bounces more easily than a normal tennis ball.

==Tradition==
The most traditional players believe it to be impossible to play picigin anywhere but on the sandy beach of Bačvice in Split, which is considered the game&#x27;s spiritual home. 

Picigin is played on Bačvice year round and, often at night in the summer (reflectors can be used in the dark). There is also a longstanding tradition of playing picigin on New Year&#x27;s Day regardless of weather conditions, when the sea temperature is rarely above 15 °C.

In June 2008, picigin was pronounced a Croatian immaterial cultural good, for a period of three years, with pending plans for a permanent designation. That status was confirmed in 2013.

In September 2023, the centennial of picigin at Bačvice beach was commemorated with an unveiling of commemorative plaque.

===Championships===
Since 2005, the Picigin World Championship () is organized every year on Bačvice beach in Split. Until 2008, players were given a task to do certain jumps, but from 2008, the winner is selected according to the artistic impression of a whole group.
