<text>The Parti nationaliste du Québec was a fringe Quebec-based federal political party in Canada, that advocated sovereignty of Quebec and was founded by Parti Québécois (PQ) supporters. Its primary goal was to represent Quebec&#x27;s interests in Ottawa and serve as a federal wing for the PQ.

==Origins==
For decades, the Social Credit Party&#x27;s Quebec wing, the Ralliement créditiste, attracted many Quebec nationalists as a party that could represent Quebec&#x27;s interests in the House of Commons of Canada. When Créditistes were wiped off the electoral map in 1980 federal election, the political situation seemed favourable for the growth of the Parti nationaliste.

The Parti nationaliste was a successor to the Union Populaire, a party that had little success in the 1979 and 1980 federal elections.

==Beau risque==
Marcel Léger, who had been the PQ Member of the provincial legislature for the district of LaFontaine since 1970 became the party&#x27;s first leader on September 14, 1983. He was a former Minister of the Environment who had been dropped from the Cabinet in 1982.

In the aftermath of the 1982 Patriation of the Constitution by the federal government, PQ leader René Lévesque adopted the beau risque strategy and refused to give his blessing to Léger&#x27;s efforts to establish the Parti nationaliste. Instead, Lévesque backed Brian Mulroney&#x27;s pledge to have Quebec integrate the Canadian constitution in honour and dignity.

Léger resigned as leader on May 17, 1984, and was succeeded by Denis Monière, a Professor of Political Science who later founded Parti indépendantiste (1985) and is a founding member of Option nationale (2011-).

==1984 election==
The party ran 74 candidates in the 1984 federal election. All of them ran in Quebec districts and were defeated, including interim leader Denis Monière, who ran in the district of Duvernay.

The party conducted a very modest campaign, lacking financial and human resources. Most PQ supporters voted for the Progressive Conservative Party which won 58 out of Quebec&#x27;s 75 districts and Mulroney became Prime Minister.

==Decline==
During the months that followed the 1984 defeat, the PQ dealt with the worst crisis of its existence. Five cabinet members, including Minister of Finance Jacques Parizeau, resigned. The PQ lost the 1985 provincial election. The PQ&#x27;s misfortunes distracted the Parti nationaliste&#x27;s supporters. It left them with little time available for federal politics.

Monière went on to help found the Parti indépendantiste in 1985. The Parti indépendantiste was a Quebec provincial party that aimed to attract more radical supporters of the PQ who were disappointed with the beau risque approach.

The Parti nationaliste unsuccessfully ran a candidate in the September 29, 1986 by-election in the district of Saint-Maurice. It ceased to exist soon after.

==Legacy==
The Parti nationaliste may have provided the groundwork for the subsequent success of the sovereigntist Bloc Québécois (BQ) in federal politics. In 1993, 54 out of the BQ&#x27;s 75 candidates were elected. Three of them, Antoine Dubé, Réal Ménard and Yves Rocheleau, had run under the Parti nationaliste label nine years earlier.

<text>The Mystic River is a river in Massachusetts. In the Massachusett language, means &quot;large estuary&quot;, alluding to the tidal nature of the Mystic River. The resemblance to the English word &quot;&quot; is a coincidence, which the colonists followed.

The Mystic River lies to the north of Boston and flows approximately parallel to the lower portions of the Charles River, encompassing of watershed. The river flows from the Lower Mystic Lake and travels through East Boston,
Chelsea, Charlestown, Everett, 
Medford, Somerville, and 
Arlington. The river joins the Charles River to form inner Boston Harbor. Its watershed contains 44 lakes and ponds, the largest of which is Spot Pond in the Middlesex Fells, with an area of . Significant portions of the river&#x27;s shores are within the Mystic River Reservation and are administered by the Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation, which include a variety of recreation areas.

The Mystic River has a long history of industrial use and a continuing water quality problem. Some sections are undergoing an extensive cleanup as part of the construction of Everett&#x27;s new Encore Boston Harbor casino.

==History==
American Indians and colonists used weirs to catch alewives and fertilize their crops. In 1631, the first ship built in Massachusetts was the &quot;Blessing of the Bay&quot;, launched from the river&#x27;s shores. The first bridge was built in 1637; neighboring towns squabbled about the costs for more than a hundred years.

The Mystic River played a role in the American Revolution on September 1, 1774 when a force of roughly 260 British regulars rowed from Boston up the river to a landing point near Winter Hill. From there, they marched about a mile (1.6 km) to the Powder House where a large supply of American gunpowder was kept; they removed all the powder, sparking a popular uprising known as the Powder Alarm. The Battle of Chelsea Creek took place in the river&#x27;s watershed in May 1775, and the British attacked via the river&#x27;s beach in the Battle of Bunker Hill in June.

In 1805, the Middlesex Canal linked the Charles and Mystic Rivers to the Merrimack River in Lowell. Ten shipyards along the Mystic River built more than 500 clipper ships during the 19th Century. Shipbuilding peaked in the 1840s, as schooners and sloops transported timber and molasses for rum distilleries between Medford and the West Indies.

Extensive salt marshes lined the banks of the Mystic River until 1909, when the first Craddock Locks was built across the river, converting salt marsh to freshwater marsh and enabling development. The Amelia Earhart Dam was built in 1966, named for Amelia Earhart. In 1950, construction was completed on the Maurice J. Tobin Bridge which spans the Mystic River, joining Charlestown and Chelsea.

== Wildlife ==
At one time, the Mystic River was home to many species of fish, including salmon, alewife, blueback herring, striped bass, bluefish, smallmouth bass, largemouth bass, bluegill, carp and more. Although most of these species still live in the Mystic River, pollution and dam building have severely damaged the populations. Pollution came from various mills and a small ship building yard in the past. The main source of pollution in the 20th century and into the present is from drainage from cities and towns in the watershed. Many of the records of nearby drainage pipes have been lost, or have undocumented changes and diversions. Once described as having so many herring that one could cross the river on their backs, the Mystic River herring run is much smaller than it was in historic times. Pollution has raised bacteria levels and turbidity, making it unfavorable for fish to live in.

== In popular culture ==
In 1844, Medford abolitionist and writer Lydia Maria Child described her journey across the Mystic to her grandfather&#x27;s house in the poem &quot;Over the River and Through the Wood.&quot; (Grandfather&#x27;s House, restored by Tufts University in 1976, still stands near the river on South Street in Medford.)

John Townsend Trowbridge&#x27;s popular 1882 novel, &quot;The Tinkham Brothers&#x27; Tide-Mill&quot;, had its setting along the river at a time when saltwater still reached the Mystic Lakes.

In Dennis Lehane&#x27;s novel of the same name, Boston-area Mystic River holds a pivotal narrative development in the mystery. Later, Clint Eastwood directed the acclaimed film adaptation.

In the 1861 poem &quot;Paul Revere&#x27;s Ride&quot; by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, Paul Revere rides along the banks of the Mystic River.

<doc id="461272" wikidata="Q3712541" url="?curid=461272" title="Doge of Genoa">
<text>The Doge of Genoa ( ) was the head of state of the Republic of Genoa, a city-state and soon afterwards a maritime republic, from 1339 until the state&#x27;s extinction in 1797. Originally elected for life, after 1528 the Doges were elected for terms of two years. 
The Republic (or Dogate) was ruled by a small group of merchant families, from whom the doges were selected.

==Form of address==

The Genoese doge&#x27;s form of address initially was &quot;eccelso&quot; (exalted), then &quot;illustrissimo&quot; (most illustrious), &quot;eccellentissimo&quot; (most excellent), and finally, &quot;serenissimo principe&quot; (most serene prince), &quot;signore&quot; (lord), or &quot;altezza serenissima&quot; (most serene highness).

== History ==

The first Doge of Genoa, Simone Boccanegra (Ligurian: &quot;Scimón Boccanéigra&quot;), whose name is kept alive by Verdi&#x27;s opera, was appointed by public acclaim in 1339. Initially the Doge of Genoa was elected without restriction and by popular suffrage, holding office for life in the so-called &quot;perpetual dogate&quot;; but after the reform effected by Andrea Doria in 1528 the term of his office was reduced to two years. At the same time plebeians were declared ineligible, and the appointment of the doge was entrusted to the members of the great council, the &quot;Gran Consiglio&quot;, who employed for this purpose a complex political system.

The Palazzo Pubblico, where the Doges had formerly presided, was expanded in 1388 to accommodate the new ruler and style of government, the first of a series of radical reconstructions. It was renamed &quot;Palazzo Ducale&quot; and magnificently rebuilt in the 16th century. Until recently the palazzo housed courts, but it now functions as Genoa&#x27;s cultural centre.

Of all the &quot;perpetual&quot; doges of Genoa who ruled for their lifetime, only one ruled for more than eight years. Many resigned or were driven out before taking office. Some failed to complete a single day in power. Between 1339 and 1528, only four Doges were legally elected. Genoa did not trust its Doges; the ruling caste of Genoa tied them to executive committees, kept them on a small budget, and kept them apart from the communal revenues held at the &quot;Casa di San Giorgio&quot;.

Still, the position of Doge stood at the head of state patronage, and the city&#x27;s inner group of leading merchant families vied with each other to place their man in the position. Rival elections were known to take place within the building. In 1389, a frustrated candidate made a surprise return from enforced exile accompanied by 7,000 supporters, and after dining amicably with the incumbent, politely but firmly ejected him, thanking him for serving so ably as his deputy during his own &quot;unavoidable absence&quot; from Genoa.

For generations two powerful families in Genoa all but monopolized the &quot;dogate&quot;: the Adorno and the Fregoso or di Campofregoso. Tomaso di Campofregoso became Doge three times: in 1415, 1421 and 1437. In 1461, Paolo Fregoso, archbishop of Genoa, enticed the current doge to his own palace, held him hostage and offered him the choice of retiring from the post or being hanged. When Fregoso was in due course himself toppled, he fled to the harbour, commandeered four galleys and launched himself on a whole new career as a pirate. Among other influential families in the republic were the Spinola, the Grimaldi, the Doria and the Durazzo, all these dynasties gave numerous doges to Genoa. While the doge&#x27;s palace in Venice accumulated great furnishings and works of art over the years, in Genoa, each Doge was expected to arrive with his own furnishings and, when he left, to strip the palace to its bare walls.

In the 16th century, the republic enjoyed a dramatic revival under the leadership of the admiral, statesman and patron of the arts Andrea Doria who ruled the state as a virtual dictator but never actually became doge. It was through the Spanish empire in the New World that Genoa became rich again. And the bankers of Genoa handled Spain&#x27;s financial business, which vastly enriched Genoa&#x27;s banking oligarchy.

The Napoleonic Wars put an end to the office of Doge of Genoa. In 1797, when Napoleon Bonaparte incorporated Genoa into the newly organized Ligurian Republic, French soldiers and the city&#x27;s mob ransacked the Doge&#x27;s palace.

== Election ==
The Doge&#x27;s election took place through the vote of the members of the Great Council and Minor Council of Genoa that met in a room with the same name at the Doge&#x27;s Palace. The voting took place by drawing fifty golden balls which were contained in an urn placed in front of the throne. Thanks to a series of successive votes, the number of candidates was reduced to six and, among the latter, the one who obtained the highest number of votes was elected Doge.

<text>PiHex was a distributed computing project organized by Colin Percival to calculate specific bits of . 1,246 contributors used idle time slices on almost two thousand computers to make its calculations. The software used for the project made use of Bellard&#x27;s formula, a faster version of the BBP formula.

==History==
To calculate the five trillionth digit (and the following seventy-six digits) took 13,500 CPU hours, using 25 computers from 6 countries. The forty trillionth digit required 84,500 CPU hours and 126 computers from 18 countries. The highest calculation, the one quadrillionth digit, took 1.2 million CPU hours and 1,734 computers from 56 countries. Total resources: 1,885 computers donated 1.3 million CPU hours. The average computer that was used to calculate would have taken 148 years to complete the calculations alone.

After setting three records, calculating the five trillionth bit, the forty trillionth bit, and the quadrillionth bit, the project ended on September 11, 2000.

While the PiHex project calculated the least significant digits of ever attempted at the time in any base, the second place is held by Peter Trueb who computed some 22+ trillion digits in 2016 and third place by &quot;houkouonchi&quot; who derived the 13.3 trillionth digit in base 10.

==Algorithm==
Unlike most computations of , which compute results in base 10, PiHex computed in base 2 (bits), because Bellard&#x27;s formula and the BBP formula could only be used to compute in base 2 at the time.

The final bit strings for each of the three calculations resulted as such:

* Binary digits of from five trillion minus three to five trillion and seventy-six (completed August 30, 1998):
 0000 0111 1110 0100 0101 0111 0011 0011 1100 1100
 ^ Five trillionth bit of 
 0111 1001 0000 1011 0101 1011 0101 1001 0111 1001
* Binary digits of from forty trillion minus three to forty trillion and sixty-four (February 9, 1999):
 1010 0000 1111 1001 1111 1111 0011 0111 0001 1101
 ^ Forty trillionth bit of 
 0001 0111 0101 1001 0011 1110 0000
* Binary digits of from one quadrillion minus three to one quadrillion and sixty (September 11, 2000):
 1110 0110 0010 0001 0110 1011 0000 0110 1001 1100
 ^ Quadrillionth bit of 
 1011 0110 1100 0001 1101 0011

<text>Andrea di Robilant (born 13 February 1957) is an Italian journalist and writer.

==Early life and education==
Di Robilant was born in Rome, Italy, and attended a Swiss boarding school, Institut Le Rosey. He moved to New York for university, where he earned his BA in History in 1979 from Columbia College and his MA in International Relations from the School of International and Public Affairs, Columbia University in 1980.

He is the eldest of three sons of Count Alvise Nicolis di Robilant e Cereaglio, of Piedmontese and Venetian ancestry, and American Elizabeth, née Stokes. His father, a descendant of Italian statesman and diplomat Carlo Felice Nicolis, conte di Robilant, was managing director of Sotheby&#x27;s in Italy; he was found murdered in his apartment in the Palazzo Rucellai in Florence in 1997, aged 72. The murder remains unsolved.

Other members of his family include General Mario Nicolis di Robilant, who commanded the Italian Fourth Army at Monte Grappa during World War I.

His great-great-great-great grandmother, Lucia Memmo, married Alvise Mocenigo, a member of the House of Mocenigo that played a pivotal role in Venice&#x27;s history. In 1818, Lucia rented the piano nobile of Palazzo Mocenigo to Lord Byron, who wrote parts of &quot;Don Juan&quot; at the family mansion, and hosted illustrious figures such as François-René de Chateaubriand and Effie Ruskin throughout her life. Lucia&#x27;s father, Andrea Memmo, was the Venetian ambassador to the Papal States and a prominent citizen of the Republic of Venice. Both of di Robilant&#x27;s ancestors became subjects of his books.

==Career==
After he finished school, he was hired as a reporter for the New Jersey–based Italian-American newspaper, &quot;Il Progresso Italo-Americano.&quot; He later joined &quot;La Repubblica&quot; as a U.S. correspondent, covering the Ronald Reagan presidency, the Central American crisis, and the Falklands War. He then traveled to South America and covered local affairs for a number of publications and was &quot;The Dallas Morning News&quot;&#x27;s Latin American correspondent in Buenos Aires, where he covered the end of military regimes in South America.

He returned to Italy in 1987 to start a monthly city magazine in Milan named &quot;02&quot; but the magazine folded only after a year, which made him return to journalism. He joined &quot;La Stampa&quot; and became its diplomatic correspondent and in 1996, he became the paper&#x27;s bureau chief in Washington, D.C., where he covered Bill Clinton&#x27;s second term in office.

In 2003, di Robilant wrote his first book &quot;A Venetian Affair&quot;, a biography of his ancestor, Andrea Memmo, in 18th century Venice based on his correspondence with Giustiniana Wynne found in the Palazzo Mocenigo; and a sequel entitled &quot;Lucia: A Venetian Life in the Age of Napoleon&quot; (2008) based on Andrea&#x27;s daughter, Lucia Mocenigo. He subsequently left &quot;La Stampa&quot; to pursue a full-time writing career.

In 2011, he published &quot;Irresistible North: From Venice to Greenland on the Trail of the Zen Brothers&quot;, in which he analyses the claim that two Venetian merchants, the Zeno brothers, sailed over the north Atlantic in a pre-Columbian expedition to North America. His new book, &quot;Autumn in Venice: Ernest Hemingway and His Last Muse&quot; was published in 2018.

Di Robilant lives in Rome. He is a writer and a professor at The American University of Rome.

==Personal life==
He and his wife, Alessandra Mattirolo, have two sons, Tommaso and Sebastiano.

<text>Irving Grant Thalberg Jr. (August 25, 1930August 21, 1987) was an American author and the son of 1930s Hollywood producer Irving Thalberg and Academy Award-winning actress Norma Shearer.

Thalberg was six years old when his father died from pneumonia at the age of 37. He was educated at Institut Le Rosey in Switzerland and attended Stanford University. He was a professor of philosophy at the University of Illinois at Chicago until he died of cancer on August 21, 1987. He left a wife and three daughters. Prior to the University of Illinois, he was briefly a professor at the University of Washington.

==Publications==
Thalberg published two books of philosophical studies through the Muirhead Library of Philosophy: &quot;Enigmas of Agency&quot; (Allen &amp; Unwin, London, 1972), and &quot;Perception, Emotion &amp; Action&quot; (Blackwells, Oxford, 1977).

Unlike most epistemologists, Thalberg published articles that defended the Platonic tripartite analysis of knowledge (justified true belief, a.k.a. &quot;JTB&quot;) against the more popular view that Gettier counterexamples refuted the JTB account. Specifically, Thalberg argued that justification is not transmissible through valid deduction.

<text>Aligarh (; formerly known as Koil) is a city in the state of Uttar Pradesh in India. It is the administrative headquarters of Aligarh district, and lies northwest of state capital Lucknow and approximately southeast of the capital, New Delhi. The cities and districts which adjoin Aligarh are: Gautam Buddha Nagar, Bulandshahr, Sambhal, Badaun, Kasganj, Hathras, Etah and Mathura, as well as Palwal district of Haryana. As of 2011, Aligarh is the 53rd most populous city in India.

The recorded history of Aligarh begins in the 12th century, under the name Kol. Kol was a major city of the Delhi Sultanate and Mughal Empire, serving as both a political and economic centre. Beginning with a major rebuilding of the Aligarh Fort in the 16th century, the city was renamed several times before eventually settling on the current name, Aligarh, in the mid-1700s. It is notable as the seat of Aligarh Muslim University, which was founded here as Mohammadan Anglo-Oriental College in 1875, initiating the Aligarh Movement.

==History==
Written references to the city commence only from 12th century onward; however, archaeological records suggest that the town used to be inhabited by Jains. The area of Aligarh before the Ghurid conquest of the region was under the sway of Dor Rajputs in 12th century.

In 1194, Qutb-ud-din Aibak mounted a successful invasion of the region and Hisam-ud-din Ulbak was installed as the first Muslim governor; court-historian Hasan Nizami noted Kol to be &quot;one of the most celebrated fortresses of Hind&quot;. Beginning the 13th century, the place featured — as Kol or Koil — in multiple Persian (as well as non-Persian) Sultanate sources as a center of economic prominence, especially for production of distilled wine. By the mid-13th century, the town commanded enough importance for (would-be Sultan) Ghiyas ud din Balban to erect a minaret.

Under the Khiljis and Tughlaqs, the prominence continued unabated; it had become an &quot;iqta&quot; by the times of Alauddin Khalji.

Kol is mentioned in Ibn Battuta&#x27;s &quot;Rihla&quot;, when Ibn Battuta, along with 15 ambassadors representing Ukhaantu Khan, emperor of the Mongol Chinese Yuan dynasty, travelled to Kol city en route to the coast at Cambay (in Gujarat) in 1341. According to Battuta, it would appear that the district was then in a very disturbed state since the escort of the Emperor&#x27;s embassy had to assist in relieving Jalali from an attacking body of Hindus and lost an officer in the fight. Ibn Batuta calls Kol &quot;a fine town surrounded by mango groves&quot;. From these same groves the environs of Kol would appear to have acquired the name &quot;Sabzabad&quot; or &quot;the green country&quot;.

In the reign of Akbar, Kol was made a Sirkar and included the &quot;dasturs&quot; of Marahra, Kol ba Haveli, Thana Farida and Akbarabad. Akbar and Jahangir visited Kol on hunting expeditions. Jahangir clearly mentions the forest of Kol, where he killed wolves.

During the time of Ibrahim Lodhi, Muhammad, son of Umar, was the governor of Kol. He built a fort at Kol and named the city Muhammadgarh, after himself, in 1524–25. Sabit Khan, who was then the governor of this region, rebuilt the old Lodhi fort and named the town Sabitgarh, after himself.

The ruler of Koil was Bargujar King Bahadur Singh who, in 1753, rose against the destruction of Hindu temples. The Jat ruler, Surajmal, with consent of Safdar Jang, occupied the fort of Koil. Bahadur Singh continued the battle from another fort and died fighting in what is known as the &quot;Battle of Ghasera&quot;. It was renamed Ramgarh and Rao Durjan Singh Poonia of Bijauli was made the kiledar of the fort. When a Persian Mughal Shia commander, Najaf Khan, captured Ramgarh, he renamed it and gave it its present name of Aligarh. Aligarh Fort (also called Aligarh Qila), as it stands today, was built by French engineers under the control of French officers Benoît de Boigne and Perron.

===Battle of Aligarh (1803)===

The Battle of Aligarh was fought on 1 September 1803 during the Second Anglo-Maratha War (1803–1805) at Aligarh Fort. The British 76th Regiment, now known as the Duke of Wellington&#x27;s Regiment besieged the fort, which was under the control of the French officer Perron, and established British rule. In 1804, the Aligarh district was formed by the union of the second, third and fourth British divisions with the addition of Anupshahr from Muradabad and Sikandra Rao from Etawa. On 1 August 1804, Claude Russell was appointed the first Collector of the new district.

<text>The Convention of Philippine Baptist Churches (CPBC) (Hiligaynon: &quot;Kasapulanan sang Bautista nga Pilipinhon&quot;) is a Baptist Christian denomination in the Philippines. It is affiliated with the Baptist World Alliance and is headquartered in Jaro, Iloilo City. CPBC was founded in 1900 as the oldest and first organized union of Baptist churches in the Philippines. This occurred after the country opened to Protestant American missions in 1898, following Spain&#x27;s transfer of the Philippine islands administration to the United States.

CPBC is associated with the American Baptist Foreign Mission Society (now International Ministries) and played a key role in establishing the Jaro Evangelical Church, the first Baptist church in the Philippines outside Manila. CPBC has affiliations with various institutions, including Central Philippine University, the first Baptist and second Protestant university in the country. Additionally, CPBC is affiliated with the CPU College of Theology, the first Baptist theological seminary in the Philippines; Filamer Christian University, the first Baptist school in the country; and Capiz Emmanuel Hospital, the first Baptist hospital in the Philippines.

In the 1930s, CPBC also became affiliated with the Iloilo Mission Hospital, initially founded by Protestant Presbyterians and later transferred to the Baptists (CPBC). The Iloilo Mission Hospital is the first American and Protestant hospital in the Philippines.

At present, besides being affiliated with the American Baptist Churches USA, the organization is a member of the National Council of Churches in the Philippines. It has over 1,000 affiliated Baptist churches and more than 600,000 members across the Philippines.&quot;

==History==

The Convention of Philippine Baptist Churches has its origins in a foreign mission of the American Baptist Missionary Union on the island of Panay in February 1900, when the Philippines islands was opened to the Evangelical missions after it was ceded to the United States administration.

Eric Lund, a Swedish Baptist minister working under the auspices of the American Baptist Foreign Mission Society and one of the founding fathers of the Jaro Evangelical Church, translated the entire Bible into Hiligaynon, and the New Testament into two other dialects. In 1905, the Bible School and Jaro Industrial School were established through a grant given by the American Baptist, business magnate and philanthropist, John D. Rockefeller. The two schools later merged and became Central Philippine University, the first Baptist and second American university in the Philippines and Asia.

In 1935 the formal formation of &quot;Convention of Philippine Baptist Churches&quot; was established. In 1980, Angelina Buensuceso became the first woman ordained pastor in the Convention.

According to a census published by the association in 2023, it claimed 1,079 churches and 600,000 members.

==Core Mission Principles==

== Beliefs ==
The Convention has a Baptist confession of faith in Protestant theology. It is a member of the Baptist World Alliance and maintains ties with the American Baptist Churches USA.

==Schools==

Baptist missionaries founded many schools and universities in the Philippines. Most notable of these is Central Philippine University (CPU), the first Baptist and second American university in the Philippines and in Asia (after Silliman University in Dumaguete), while Filamer Christian University is the first Baptist school in the Philippines.

CPU&#x27;s earliest forerunner, the Central Philippine University College of Theology which was established four months earlier than the university&#x27;s second precursor, the Jaro Industrial School, is the first Baptist theological seminary in the Philippines.

The CPU College of Nursing, an academic institution for nurses founded in 1906 as Union Mission Hospital Training School for Nurses by the Presbyterian Protestant American missionaries through the present day Iloilo Mission Hospital, is the first Nursing School in the Philippines. The Central Philippine University College of Nursing is also one of the leading nursing schools in the Philippines.

Central Philippine University&#x27;s official student governing body, the CPU Republic (Central Philippine University Republic), is the oldest student government in the South East Asia. It was organized in 1905, one year after the founding of the school. The University&#x27;s official publication, the Central Echo (&quot;CE&quot;) is the official student publication of CPU. It was founded in 1910, five years after Jaro Industrial School opened. It is one of the oldest student publications in the Philippines.

<text>Charlotte Lennox, &quot;née&quot; Ramsay (c. 1729 – 4 January 1804), was a Scottish author and a literary and cultural critic, whose publishing career flourished in London. Best known for her novel &quot;The Female Quixote&quot; (1752), she was frequently praised for her genius and literary skill. As a result, Sir Joshua Reynolds painted her portrait and she was featured in &quot;The Nine Living Muses of Great Britain&quot; in 1778. Samuel Johnson declared her superior to all other female writers, and Henry Fielding said that she &quot;excelled Cervantes.&quot; Her pioneering study of Shakespeare&#x27;s source material is still cited and her magazine (1760–1761) is the focus of &quot;The Lady&#x27;s Museum Project.&quot;

==Life==
Lennox was born in Gibraltar. Her father, James Ramsay of Dalhousie, was a Scottish captain in the British Army, and her mother Catherine, née Tisdall (died 1765), was Scottish and Irish. She was baptized Barbara Charlotte Ramsay. Very little direct information on her pre-public life is available, and biographers have extrapolated from her first novel such elements as seem semi-autobiographical. Charlotte lived the first ten years of her life in England before her father, who was a lieutenant in the guards, moved the family to Albany, New York in 1738, where he was lieutenant-governor. He died in 1742.

Lennox&#x27;s experiences in the colonies probably inspired her first and last novels, &quot;Harriot Stuart&quot; (1750) and &quot;Euphemia&quot; (1790). Around the age of 13, she was sent to be a companion to her maternal aunt Mary Lucking in London, but on her arrival she found that the son of her future guardian had died and the arrangement was no longer suitable. Instead, Charlotte&#x27;s writing seems to have caught the attention of Lady Isabella Finch, who had an extensive library and offered her protection.

Lennox&#x27;s first volume of poetry, &quot;Poems on Several Occasions&quot;, published in 1747, was dedicated to Lady Isabella and centred partly on themes of female friendship and independence. She might have been offered a position at court, but this was forestalled by her marriage to Alexander Lennox, and her decision to take up acting and to publish her works (and thereby earn her own income). Her husband&#x27;s only known employment was in the customs office from 1773 to 1782, and this was reported to be as a benefice of the Duke of Newcastle as a reward for his wife. He also claimed to be the proper heir to the Earl of Lennox in 1768, but the House of Lords rejected his claims, possibly on the basis of bastardy. Charlotte mentioned his &quot;birth misfortunes&quot; in a letter.

In 1746, after turning away from a life of aristocratic patronage, seventeen-year-old Lennox took on a public role for the first time. She performed in a successful run of &quot;The Fair Penitent,&quot; which was part of a series of &quot;civic&quot; dramas at Drury Lane dealing with social issues of politics and gender. After the publication of her first poems, &quot;Poems on Several Occasions&quot; (1747), she began to shift away from acting towards writing. However, she did perform at Richmond in 1748 and received a benefit night at the Haymarket Theatre in a production of &quot;The Mourning Bride&quot; in 1750. In the latter year, she also published her most successful poem, &quot;The Art of Coquetry&quot; in the &quot;Gentleman&#x27;s Magazine.&quot; She met Samuel Johnson around that time, and he held her in high regard. When her first novel, &quot;The Life of Harriot Stuart, Written by Herself&quot;, appeared, Johnson threw a lavish party for Lennox, with a laurel wreath and an apple pie that contained bay leaf. Johnson thought her superior to his other female literary friends, Elizabeth Carter, Hannah More, and Frances Burney, due to her efforts to professionalize her writing career, rather than write anonymously. He ensured that Lennox was introduced to important members on the London literary scene.

However, some of the women of Johnson&#x27;s circle were not fond of Lennox. Hester Thrale, Elizabeth Carter, and Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, all members of the Bluestocking Society, faulted her either for her housekeeping (which even Lennox joked about), for her ostensibly unpleasant personality, or for her bad temper. They saw her specifically as an incendiary.

Samuel Richardson and Samuel Johnson both favourably reviewed Lennox&#x27;s second, most successful novel, &quot;The Female Quixote, or, The Adventures of Arabella&quot; (1752). Henry Fielding praised it in his &quot;Covent Garden Journal&quot; and it gained popularity. It was reprinted and packaged in a series of great novels in 1783, 1799, and 1810, and translated into German in 1754, French in 1773 and 1801, and Spanish in 1808. The novel formally inverts &quot;Don Quixote&quot;: as the Don mistakes himself for the knightly hero of a romance. Arabella, also informed by earnest reading, mistakes herself for the maiden love of a romance. While the Don thinks it his duty to praise the platonically pure damsels he meets (such as the farm girl he loves), so Arabella believes it is in her power to kill with a look and that her lovers have a duty to suffer ordeals on her behalf.

Some of Lennox&#x27;s other works were advertised as being by &quot;the author of &quot;The Female Quixote&quot;&quot;. The translator/censor of the Spanish version, Lt-Col. Don Bernardo María de Calzada, appropriated the text, stating &quot;written in English by an unknown author and in Spanish by D. Bernardo,&quot; even though he was not fluent in English and had only translated into Spanish a previous French translation, which was already censored. In the preface, de Calzada also warns the reader of the questionable quality of the text, as good British texts were only written by &quot;Fyelding&quot; and Richardson, the two authors of international fame.

Lennox cultivated friendships that assisted her in her publishing efforts. For her translation of &quot;The Greek Theatre of Father Brumoy&quot;, the most influential French study of Greek tragedy in the mid-18th century, she found several learned men to contribute. In 1755 she translated &quot;Memoirs of Maximilian de Bethune, Duke of Sully&quot;, which sold well. Learning several languages, including Italian from Joseph Baretti, Lennox studied the sources for William Shakespeare&#x27;s plays. In 1753, the first two volumes of &quot;Shakespear Illustrated&quot; – seen by many scholars as the first feminist work of literary criticism – were published by Andrew Millar. The third volume, which appeared in 1754, spoke to its success. Lennox studied and discussed how Shakespeare used his sources and was especially attentive to the romance tradition on which Shakespeare drew. One criticism Lennox had was that his plays strip female characters of their original authority, &quot;taking from them the power and the moral independence which the old romances and novels had given them.&quot;

Samuel Johnson wrote the dedication for &quot;Shakespear Illustrated,&quot; but others criticized its treatment, in David Garrick&#x27;s words, by &quot;so great and so Excellent an Author.&quot; and the literary world took its revenge upon the presentation of her play, &quot;The Sister (1769),&quot; based on her third novel, &quot;Henrietta&quot; (1758)&quot;.&quot; Several groups of attendees concerted to boo the play off the stage on its opening night, though it went on to be printed in several editions.

&quot;Henrietta&quot; sold well, but did not bring her any money. From 1760 to 1761 she edited and wrote for the periodical &quot;The Lady&#x27;s Museum,&quot; which included her novel &quot;Harriot and Sophia&quot; (later &quot;Sophia),&quot; known as one of two of the earliest serialized novels (along with Tobias Smollett&#x27;s &quot;The Life and Adventures of Sir Launcelot Greaves&quot;). Lennox called this magazine &quot;a course in female education&quot; and included the learned subjects botany, history, astronomy, medicine, literary criticism, zoology, and theology. David Garrick produced her &quot;Old City Manners&quot; at Theatre Royal, Drury Lane in 1775 (an adaptation of Ben Jonson&#x27;s &quot;Eastward Ho&quot;). The play saw at least nine performances over two seasons, favourable reviews, and publication. Lennox was described as &quot;a Lady well known as a favourite attendant in the train of the muses.&quot; Finally, in 1790, Lennox published &quot;Euphemia&quot; with little success, as the public&#x27;s interest in novels of romance seemed to have waned. &quot;Euphemia&quot; is an epistolary novel set in New York before the American Revolution and describes relationships between Native Americans and the British, primarily Mohawks and Hurons.

Lennox had two children who survived infancy: Harriot Holles Lennox (1765–1782/3) and George Lewis Lennox (born 1771), who emigrated to America in 1793. In that same year, she and her husband, with whom she had been estranged for many years, separated. Charlotte then lived in &quot;solitary penury&quot; for the rest of her life, relying on support from the Literary Fund. She died on 4 January 1804 in London and was buried in an unmarked grave not far from &quot;Dean&#x27;s yard, Westminster,&quot; the area of London currently called St. John&#x27;s Gardens.

During the 19th century, &quot;The Female Quixote&quot; remained moderately popular. In the 20th century, feminist scholars such as Janet Todd, Jane Spencer, and Nancy Armstrong praised Lennox&#x27;s skill and inventiveness. Five of Lennox&#x27;s six novels have been published in a modern edition.

&quot;The Female Quixote&quot; has been chosen for the 2024 Aggregation exam to certify English teachers in France.

<text>Power Rangers Turbo is a television series and the fifth season of the Power Rangers franchise that aired in 1997. The show was prefaced with the franchise&#x27;s second film, &quot;&quot;. 

As with its predecessors, &quot;Power Rangers Turbo&quot; is based on one of the entries of the Super Sentai series; in Turbo&#x27;s case, the source is the 20th series, &quot;Gekisou Sentai Carranger&quot;. The series introduced a child actor as the new Blue Ranger, and featured the departure of the long-running characters Zordon and Alpha 5, as well the veteran team of Rangers. The series introduced four new characters to take the place of the veteran Rangers. The fifth season also marked the final regular appearances of Johnny Yong Bosch, Catherine Sutherland, and Steve Cardenas, and also the last appearance of Nakia Burrise.

==Plot==
After Maligore&#x27;s defeat, the Turbo Power Rangers, Tommy Oliver, Adam Park, Tanya Sloan and Katherine Hillard graduate from high school, while the new 12-year-old Blue Ranger, Justin Stewart, skips ahead a couple of grades and gets to go to Angel Grove High. Seeking revenge, Divatox begins to attack the Rangers. At the beginning of the season, the Rangers’ longtime mentors, Zordon and Alpha 5 depart to return to Zordon&#x27;s home planet of Eltar, making way for the spectral Dimitria of Inquiris and Alpha 6. Other changes are also seen as Ernie leaves Angel Grove to do volunteer work in South America and Lt. Stone takes over the Juice Bar. Also an ally, the Blue Senturion arrives from the year 2000, with a message for Dimitria and the Rangers that Lord Zedd, Rita Repulsa, The Machine Empire and Divatox will team up to destroy the universe, but fails to show the complete message due to Divatox corrupting the end of it.

Later, Tommy, Adam, Tanya and Katherine, who are leaving for new chapters of their lives, are asked to pass on their powers to a new group of people. They choose T.J. Johnson, Carlos Vallerte, Ashley Hammond and Cassie Chan as the new Red, Green, Yellow and Pink Rangers respectively with Justin still being the Blue Ranger. The new team of Rangers are also joined by another ally, the Phantom Ranger, a mysterious being from another world. The team eventually learns that Dark Specter has captured Zordon, though Zordon is able to warn the Rangers not to rescue him as it would leave Earth defenseless. A short while later, the Rangers lose both the Turbo and Rescue Megazords in a battle with Divatox&#x27;s most powerful monster yet, Goldgoyle. As Dimitria and the Blue Senturion leave for Eltar to help Zordon, Divatox finds the Power Chamber&#x27;s location. Her army of grunts and monsters infiltrate the Chamber, defeating the team and destroying the Power Chamber. However, before Divatox tries to finish off the Rangers, she receives a message that Zordon has been captured and under the order of Dark Specter leaves for the Cimmerian planet. The powerless Rangers then leave Earth and head for space to save Zordon, with Justin choosing to stay behind with his father. These events lead to the next incarnation of the franchise, &quot;Power Rangers in Space&quot;.

At the age of 28 he was a county court judge, and in the following year he was appointed chairman of a commission in the Bavarian Minister-President&#x27;s office which was to review Bavarian law for a new survey published by the Bavarian state parliament. The Munich City Council made him their legal secretary (Rechtsreferent) in 1958.

== Political career ==
=== Mayor in Munich ===
Vogel became a member of the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) in 1950. At age 34, he was elected Mayor of Munich on 27 March 1960, with 64.3% of the vote, then the youngest mayor of a city in Europe with more than a million inhabitants. His popularity increased further, partly due to his success in tackling the city&#x27;s traffic problems, and he was re-elected in 1966 with 77.9%. The fact that Munich was chosen as the venue of the 1972 Summer Olympics, which had additional beneficial effects on town planning and traffic projects, was to a large extent a result of his efforts.

When Vogel became the leader of the Bavarian Social Democrats and also a member of the executive of the Social Democratic Party of Germany in 1972, he resigned as Mayor of Munich, succeeded by Georg Kronawitter. He described his Munich years in his book &quot;Die Amtskette&quot; (&quot;The Chain of Office&quot;), which was published in the same year.

In the Federal Elections of 19 November 1972, Vogel was the top candidate of the Bavarian SPD; two years later he was the SPD&#x27;s top candidate in the elections for the Bavarian State Parliament. Whereas he could not prevent a victory of the Christian Social Union of Bavaria (CSU), he personally gained the best result for any SPD politician in Bavaria after the Second World War.

=== Minister in Bonn ===

In December 1972, Chancellor Willy Brandt made Vogel Federal Minister of Regional Planning, Construction and Urban Development; Brandt&#x27;s successor, Helmut Schmidt, made him Minister of Justice in 1974.

=== Mayor in Berlin ===
A new challenge came in 1981 when Dietrich Stobbe stepped down as Mayor of West Berlin, and Vogel was asked to be his successor and take charge of a deeply divided Berlin SPD. He created a unique &quot;Berlin way&quot; (&quot;Neue Berliner Linie&quot;) of dealing with the problem of &quot;squats&quot; (&quot;Hausbesetungen&quot;) by granting contracts to the squatters, while preventing any new squats at the same time. Although he managed to successfully deal with his party&#x27;s difficulties to a large extent, the SPD lost the following West Berlin elections, only a few months after Vogel had taken office. Governing Mayor of West Berlin became Richard von Weizsäcker (CDU), the later President of Germany. During the following year, Vogel led the opposition in the West Berlin parliament.

=== Party leader ===
Vogel became the SPD&#x27;s top candidate for the federal elections on 6 March 1983, filling in for Helmut Schmidt, who had been toppled as chancellor by the CDU leader, Helmut Kohl. His campaign focused on disarmament and the problems of the labour market (&quot;&quot;), but Kohl won the elections.

After the elections, Vogel was one of Berlin&#x27;s members of the German parliament, Bundestag. Herbert Wehner, the previous leader of the parliamentary SPD, nominated him as his successor, and Vogel held that office until 1991. Under his leadership the Parliamentary SPD turned against atomic energy after the Chernobyl disaster of 1986.

From 1987 to 1991 Vogel was also the leader of the SPD. He was a member of the Bundestag until 1994. &quot;I&#x27;ve never pushed myself into the foreground&quot;, he said of himself.

===Career after political posts===
After 1994, Vogel withdrew from political posts, but he continued as a member of the organisation &quot;Gegen Vergessen – Für Demokratie&quot; (&quot;Against Oblivion – For Democracy&quot;), aimed at spreading basic democratic values, as a contrast to Nazi Germany and East German concept. Vogel was one of its founders in 1993, and its first chairman. He served as chairman until 2000.

From the beginning in 2001 to 2005, Vogel belonged to the National Ethics Council of Germany, looking at ethical aspects such as biotechnology and its consequences for individuals and society.

==Awards==
Vogel was awarded the Grand Cross 1st class of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany in 1986. He received the for promoting a better understanding between the Jewish community in Berlin and its social surroundings in 1998. In 2001 he won the , the highest award of the Central Council of Jews in Germany.

== Personal characteristics and private life ==

Originally on the right wing of the SPD, Vogel became more and more liberal in his views, for instance, with regard to the legislation about asylum seekers, referendums, or the protection of personal data (&quot;Datenschutz&quot;) from the state. In 1992, he visited twelve successor states of the former Soviet Union, meeting numerous presidents, ministers, but also leaders of the opposition, of the Orthodox Church, and of Islam, which broadened his outlook.

In his party, Vogel was a mediator between the various wings, and a centre of integration. He was open to seeking co-operation with the other parties. As the chairman of his party&#x27;s delegates in a parliamentary commission for reviewing the Constitution, he achieved the inclusion of the principles of the protection of the environment and of the promotion of women in society. In his final speech in parliament, he said that he would have liked to see a better representation of East German values in the German Constitution after unification.

Vogel summed up his political attitude: &quot;I am a Social Democrat who would like to reconcile something of a vision with the rather stringent and inexorable knowledge that politics cannot be conducted with clouds of words, but with solid work and craftsmanship.&quot;

Vogel was the elder brother of CDU politician Bernhard Vogel. In 1949, he married his first wife, Ilse, and the couple had three children. They were divorced in 1971. He married his second wife, Liselotte, in 1972. They moved to a senior citizen&#x27;s home in 2006. In 2014, Vogel announced that he had Parkinson&#x27;s disease which had been diagnosed two years prior. Vogel died in Munich on 26 July 2020 at the age of 94.

<doc id="461320" wikidata="Q751642" url="?curid=461320" title="Foyle (UK Parliament constituency)">
<text>Foyle is a constituency in Northern Ireland covering Derry, represented in the House of Commons of the UK Parliament. Its current Member of Parliament (MP) has been Colum Eastwood of the SDLP since 2019.

==Boundaries==
The seat was created in boundary changes in 1983, as part of an expansion of Northern Ireland&#x27;s constituencies from 12 to 17, and was predominantly made up from the old Londonderry constituency. From further revisions in 1995 (when it lost parts of the district of Strabane to the West Tyrone constituency), and until the 2008 revision, it covered exactly the same area as Derry City Council.

Prior to the 2010 general election the transfer of Claudy and Banagher wards to East Londonderry were approved through the passing of the Northern Ireland Parliamentary Constituencies Order in 2008.

Prior to the 2024 general election, Claudy and Eglinton were transferred to East Londonderry, and Slievekirk was transferred to West Tyrone.

The constituency is currently composed of the following wards of the District of Derry and Strabane:
* Ballymagroarty, Brandywell, Carn Hill, Caw, City Walls, Clondermot, Creggan, Creggan South, Culmore, Drumahoe, Ebrington, Enagh, Foyle Springs, Galliagh, Kilfennan, Lisnagelvin, Madam&#x27;s Bank, New Buildings, Northland, Shantallow, Shantallow East, Sheriff&#x27;s Mountain, Skeoge, Springtown, and Victoria.

==Constituency profile==

The name comes from the River Foyle which the city lies on and is used to avoid the contentious names of Derry or Londonderry, as well as to cover the areas of County Tyrone that were originally in the constituency. The seat is nationalist-leaning and residents&#x27; wealth is below average for the UK.

The wards within the constituency are among the poorest in the UK with high unemployment, high welfare dependency and the lowest employment rate for Northern Ireland.

The seat has typically been an SDLP stronghold however in 2017 Sinn Féin gained the seat for the first time with the smallest majority in Northern Ireland of 169. In 2019 SDLP leader Colum Eastwood won the seat back with an 18% swing and 17,000 majority.

==History==
At the seat&#x27;s creation at the 1983 general election, SDLP leader John Hume won the new seat, becoming the party&#x27;s only MP after it lost Belfast West to Sinn Féin. Hume retained the seat until his retirement at the 2005 general election, when he was succeeded by the SDLP&#x27;s Mark Durkan.

Durkan retained the seat in 2010. This seat also gave the Alliance Party their worst share of the vote in Northern Ireland, polling just 0.6% of the votes. Durkan was re-elected to a third term in 2015, increasing his share of the vote to 47.9% and winning a majority of 6,046 votes.

In the 2016 referendum to leave the European Union, the constituency was estimated to have voted remain by 78.3%. This was the sixth highest support for remain for a constituency, and the highest support for remain in Northern Ireland.

In the 2017 election, the seat was won by Elisha McCallion of Sinn Féin, who won with a majority of just 169 votes over Mark Durkan. Following the election, concerns about electoral malpractice were raised with the Electoral Office by the SDLP and People Before Profit&#x27;s Eamonn McCann.

In the 2019 election, the seat was recaptured by SDLP leader Colum Eastwood. Sinn Féin&#x27;s vote share dropped significantly from 39.7% in 2017 to 20.7% in 2019, which was the lowest percentage share that that party had won in any general election in the constituency since 1992.

== Members of Parliament ==
The Member of Parliament since the 2019 UK General Election is Colum Eastwood of the SDLP. He succeeded Elisha McCallion of Sinn Féin to regain the seat which the SDLP had held from its 1983 creation until 2017. The constituency was previously represented by John Hume, former leader of the SDLP and recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize.

<doc id="461322" wikidata="Q220741" url="?curid=461322" title="City of God (2002 film)">
<text>City of God () is a 2002 Brazilian epic crime film directed by Fernando Meirelles and Kátia Lund. The screenplay, written by Bráulio Mantovani, is adapted from the 1997 novel by Paulo Lins, though the plot is also loosely based on real events. The film portrays the rise of organized crime in the Cidade de Deus suburb of Rio de Janeiro between the late 1960s and early 1980s, culminating in a war between drug dealer Li&#x27;l Zé and vigilante-turned-criminal Knockout Ned. Its tagline is, &quot;If you run, the beast catches you; if you stay, the beast eats you.&quot;

The film features a cast including Alexandre Rodrigues, Leandro Firmino, Jonathan and Phellipe Haagensen, Douglas Silva, Daniel Zettel, Seu Jorge, and the film debut of Alice Braga. Most of the actors were actual residents of favelas such as Vidigal and Cidade de Deus itself.

&quot;City of God&quot; received widespread critical acclaim and earned four nominations at the 76th Academy Awards: Best Cinematography (César Charlone), Best Director (Meirelles), Best Film Editing (Daniel Rezende), and Best Adapted Screenplay (Mantovani). At the previous 75th Academy Awards, it was Brazil&#x27;s submission for Best Foreign Language Film but was not selected as a finalist.. In 2015, the Brazilian Film Critics Association (Abraccine) ranked &quot;City of God&quot; 8th on its list of the 100 greatest Brazilian films.

Following the success of &quot;City of God&quot;, Meirelles and Lund created the &quot;City of Men&quot; TV series and its 2007 film adaptation. Both projects share some actors (notably leads Silva and Darlan Cunha) and the same setting as &quot;City of God&quot;.

==Plot==
The film opens in medias res in the 1980s within the titular Rio de Janeiro favela. A gang led by the ruthless drug lord Li&#x27;l Zé (formerly Li&#x27;l Dice) chases a runaway chicken. The bird halts between the gang and the film’s narrator, Rocket (Buscapé), a young aspiring photographer. This tense standoff frames the nonlinear narrative, which chronicles the favela’s descent into violence over two decades.

=== 1960s: The rise of the Tender Trio ===
The story flashes back to the 1960s, when the Cidade de Deus is a fledgling housing project plagued by poverty. Rocket, then a child, observes his older brother Goose (Marreco) and two friends—Shaggy (Cabeleira) and Clipper (Alicate)—known as the &quot;Tender Trio.&quot; These amateur thieves rob gas trucks and businesses, sharing proceeds with residents who shield them from police. Their cautious approach contrasts with Li&#x27;l Dice, an ambitious preteen who idolizes the trio.

Li&#x27;l Dice manipulates the Tender Trio into raiding a motel, insisting they rob wealthy guests. The trio agrees but forbids killing. During the heist, Li&#x27;l Dice, left as a lookout, fabricates a police arrival, prompting the gang to flee. He then massacres the motel occupants, drawing intense police scrutiny. The trio disbands: Clipper joins a church, Shaggy dies in a police shootout, and Goose is murdered by Li&#x27;l Dice after stealing his loot. Witnessing this, Benny (Bené), Shaggy’s brother and Li&#x27;l Dice’s friend, becomes complicit in the betrayal.

=== 1970s: Li&#x27;l Zé’s reign and Rocket’s struggles ===
By the 1970s, the favela morphs into a violent drug hub. Li&#x27;l Dice, now &quot;Li&#x27;l Zé,&quot; dominates the trade with Benny, eliminating rivals except Carrot, Benny’s childhood friend. Rocket, now a teenager, navigates the chaos, pursuing photography and a romance with Angélica. His life intersects with Li&#x27;l Zé when he visits a drug den during a raid; recognizing Rocket as Goose’s brother, Benny spares him.

Li&#x27;l Zé’s empire faces threats from the &quot;Runts,&quot; preteen thieves disrupting Carrot’s territory. When Carrot refuses to act, Li&#x27;l Zé forces a Runt named Steak n’ Fries to kill a peer, cementing his tyranny. Meanwhile, Rocket’s attempts at honest work fail after the Runts loot his supermarket job. He nearly turns to crime but is dissuaded by Knockout Ned (Mané Galinha), a principled bus clerk and ex-Army sharpshooter.

Benny, seeking escape, plans to leave with Angélica. At his farewell party, a conflict erupts when Li&#x27;l Zé confronts Benny over abandoning him. Blacky, a disgruntled dealer who had his turf stolen in by Zé in an earlier raid, accidentally kills Benny during a botched assassination attempt. Carrot, fearing retaliation, kills Blacky. Grief-stricken, Li&#x27;l Zé targets Carrot but first assaults Ned and rapes his girlfriend. Ned retaliates by allying with Carrot, sparking a gang war.

=== 1981: Escalation and resolution ===
A year later, the war rages on. Ned, now a media figure, is betrayed by his own vengeance, killing a guard during a bank robbery. Rocket, now working for Jornal do Brasil, photographs the chaos. After Li&#x27;l Zé demands photos of his gang, Rocket’s images are accidentally published without consent. While he believes that this will endanger his life and forbid him from returning to the favela, unbeknownst to him, it is revealed that Li&#x27;l Zé was trying to gain the media spotlight anyway and approves of the photos. Marina, the journalist who published the photos, offers for Rocket to spend a night at hers as a form of apology, finally losing his virginity to her in the process.

The narrative returns to the opening chicken chase. Amid a police standoff, Carrot’s gang ambushes Li&#x27;l Zé. Ned kills Li&#x27;l Zé’s ally Tiago but is slain by Otto, the son of the bank guard who witnessed his murder at the hands of Ned. Police arrest Li&#x27;l Zé and Carrot but release the former after bribes. The Runts, aspiring to power and seeking revenge for their murdered comrade, execute Li&#x27;l Zé. Rocket photographs the corrupt exchange but opts to publish Li&#x27;l Zé’s corpse, securing his journalism career over exposing police corruption.

The film concludes with the Runts plotting their takeover, perpetuating the cycle of violence. Rocket’s choice underscores his role as an observer, capturing the favela’s brutal reality while seeking escape through his art.

As an adult, he is given the name Zé Pequeno in a Candomblé ceremony, which may be unrelated to his actual name and more to his short stature.

==Production==
&quot;City of God&quot; was filmed on 16mm film stock.

On the bonus DVD, it is revealed that the only professional actor in the film was Matheus Nachtergaele, who played the supporting role of Carrot. Most of the remaining cast were from real-life favelas, and in some cases, even the real-life City of God favela itself. According to Meirelles, amateur actors were used for two reasons: the lack of available professional black actors, and the desire for authenticity. Meirelles explained: &quot;Today I can open a casting call and have 500 black actors, but just ten years ago this possibility did not exist. In Brazil, there were three or four young black actors and at the same time I felt that actors from the middle class could not make the film. I needed authenticity.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bessa/iG&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning around 2000, about a hundred children and young people were hand-picked and placed into an &quot;actors&#x27; workshop&quot; for several months. In contrast to more traditional methods (e.g. studying theatre and rehearsing), it focused on simulating authentic street war scenes, such as a hold-up, scuffle, and shoot-out. Much came from improvisation, as it was thought better to create an authentic, gritty atmosphere. This way, the inexperienced cast soon learned to move and act naturally. After filming, the crew could not leave the cast to return to their old lives in the favelas. Assistance groups were set up to help those involved in the production to build more promising futures.

Meirelles went into the film with the intention of staying true to the &quot;casual nature&quot; of the violence in the novel by Lins. Critic Jean Oppenheimer wrote on the production of the film saying that: &quot;A second guiding principle was to avoid glamorising the violence&quot; and that &quot;many of the killings are either shown indistinctly or kept out of frame.&quot;

Because the real Cidade de Deus favela was in the middle of a conflict, a large majority of the film was shot in Cidade Alta, a different favela within Rio. During the production, slumlords did not allow for the production company to have their own security, so local security guards were hired for the safety of the set.

Lund and Meirelles filmed the short film &quot;Golden Gate&quot; as a test run while casting for &quot;City of God&quot; was in the initial stages.

==Reception==

===Box office===
The film was screened out of competition at the 2002 Cannes Film Festival. The film could not be part of the official selection because Walter Salles, one of the executive producers, was in the festival jury. In Brazil, &quot;City of God&quot; garnered the largest audience for a domestic film in 2002, with over 3.1 million tickets sold, and a gross of R$18.6 million ($10.3 million). The film grossed over $7.5 million in the U.S. and over US$30.5 million worldwide.

===Critical response===
On Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;City of God&quot; has an approval rating of 91% based on reviews from 165 critics, with an average rating of 8.3/10. The website&#x27;s consensus reads, &quot;&quot;City of God&quot; offers a shocking and disturbing—but always compelling—look at life in the slums of Rio de Janeiro.&quot; On Metacritic, the film holds a score of 79 out of 100 based on 33 critic reviews, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

Colin Kennedy from &quot;Empire&quot; awarded the film a full 5 out of 5 stars, comparing it favorably to &quot;Goodfellas&quot; and writing in his review, &quot;At once a laboratory for cinema technique and a victory for raw heart, this is a snot-nosed, blood-stained masterpiece. If you see even one or two better movies this year, you will be very lucky indeed.&quot; In 2008, the magazine chose &quot;City of God&quot; as the 177th best film of all time.

Film critic Roger Ebert awarded the film 4 stars out of 4, writing in his review, &quot;&quot;City of God&quot; churns with furious energy as it plunges into the story of the slum gangs of Rio de Janeiro. Breathtaking and terrifying, urgently involved with its characters, it announces a new director of great gifts and passions: Fernando Meirelles. Remember the name.&quot;

Filmmaker Robert Altman stated, &quot;I don&#x27;t know how Fernando Meirelles made &quot;City Of God&quot;. It&#x27;s so courageous, so truthful. I think it&#x27;s the best picture I&#x27;ve ever seen&quot;. Meirelles himself cited Altman&#x27;s work as an influence on his own career.

The film was not without criticism. Peter Rainer of &quot;New York&quot; magazine stated that while the film was &quot;powerful&quot;, it was also &quot;rather numbing&quot;. John Powers of &quot;LA Weekly&quot; wrote that &quot;[the film] whirs with energy for nearly its full 130-minute running time, it is oddly lacking in emotional heft for a work that aspires to be so epic – it is essentially a tarted up exploitation picture whose business is to make ghastly things fun&quot;.

Ivana Bentes, a Brazilian film critic, criticised the film for its depiction of the favela and her view that it glorified issues of poverty and violence as means of &quot;domestication of the most radical themes of culture and Brazilian cinema ... as products for export.&quot; Bentes targets the film specifically in saying that: &quot;&quot;City of God&quot; promotes tourism in hell&quot;.

&quot;City of God&quot; was ranked No.3 in Film4&#x27;s &quot;50 Films to See Before You Die&quot;, and No.7 in &quot;Empire&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;The 100 Best Films of World Cinema&quot; in 2010. It was also ranked No.6 on &quot;The Guardian&quot;″s list of &quot;the 25 Best Action Movies Ever&quot;. It was ranked No.1 in &quot;Paste&quot; magazine&#x27;s 50 best movies of the decade of the 2000s. &quot;Time&quot; listed it as one of the 100 greatest films of all time.

In 2012, the Motion Picture Editors Guild listed &quot;City of God&quot; as the 17th best-edited film of all time based on a survey of its members.

====Top ten lists====
The film appeared on several American critics&#x27; top ten lists of the best films of 2003.
* 2nd – &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; (Roger Ebert) (for 2002)
* 2nd – &quot;The Charlotte Observer&quot; (Lawrence Toppman)
* 2nd – &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; (Marc Caro)
* 4th – &quot;New York Post&quot; (Jonathan Foreman)
* 4th – &quot;Time&quot; (Richard Corliss)
* 5th – &quot;Portland Oregonian&quot; (Shawn Levy)
* 7th – &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; (Michael Wilmington)
* 10th – &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; (Michael Rechtshaffen)
* 10th – &quot;New York Post&quot; (Megan Lehmann)
* 10th – &quot;The New York Times&quot; (Stephen Holden)

It is ranked No.38 on the BBC list of best 100 films of the 21st century.

===MV Bill&#x27;s response===
Brazilian rapper MV Bill, a resident of Cidade de Deus, said the film had &quot;brought no good to the favela, no social, moral, or human benefit.&quot; He said, &quot;The world will know that they exploited the image of the children who live here in Cidade de Deus. What is obvious is that they are going to carry a bigger stigma throughout their lives; it has only become greater because of the film.&quot;

===Awards and nominations===
&quot;City of God&quot; won fifty-five awards and received another twenty-nine nominations. Among those:

==Legacy==
In an interview with &quot;Slant Magazine&quot;, Meirelles states he had met with Brazil&#x27;s former and current president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva who told him about the impact the film has had on both policies and public security within the country. The film has also sparked major increase in film productions, with over 45 being done during 2002. Films such as &quot;The Motorcycle Diaries&quot; and &quot;The Intruder&quot; are some of the films which have used Brazil for film production.

The 2013 documentary &quot;City of God – 10 Years Later&quot; reunites the cast and crew of &quot;City of God&quot; and takes a look at how their lives have changed after the original film&#x27;s release. In a &quot;BBC&quot; article written at the time of the documentary&#x27;s release, Firmino mentions that the cast had mixed careers after the film&#x27;s release. Firmino says that Jefechander Suplino, who played Clipper, could not be found by the documentary producers. His mother, however, believes him to still be alive, but is unaware of his whereabouts. Seu Jorge, who played Knockout Ned, had a better career after the film and became a major musician, performing at the London 2012 Olympic Games closing ceremony.

&quot;City of God: The Fight Rages On&quot;, a miniseries set two decades after the events of the film, premiered in August 2024.

<text>The Thomas Fisher Rare Book Library is a library in the University of Toronto, constituting the largest repository of publicly accessible rare books and manuscripts in Canada. The library is also home to the university archives which, in addition to institutional records, also contains the papers of many important Canadian literary figures including Margaret Atwood and Leonard Cohen.

==History==
The Department of Rare Books and Special Collections was founded in November 1955 by the Chief Librarian, Robert H. Blackburn. Blackburn hired Marion E. Brown who was working in the special collections department at Brown University. Brown&#x27;s first responsibility was to deal with the items that had been accumulating since 1890. Some of these items in the collection included medieval manuscripts, early printed books, and special volumes of later periods that had been presented by Queen Victoria to the university. Between the accumulated items and items found in the stacks of the main library, there was enough to open up the Rare Book Room in 1957.

The Department of Rare Books and Special Collections and the University Archives didn&#x27;t have a permanent home until 1973 when the Thomas Fisher Rare Book library was opened. The library is named in honour of Thomas Fisher (1792–1874), who immigrated from Yorkshire, settled along the Humber River in 1822, and became a successful merchant–miller. In 1973 his great-grandsons, Sidney and Charles Fisher, donated to the library their own collections of Shakespeare, various twentieth-century authors, and etchings of Wenceslaus Hollar. Since the opening of the library, it has grown to approximately 740,000 volumes and 4,000 metres of manuscript holdings.

The Fisher building was designed by Mathers and Haldenby, Toronto with design consultant Warner, Burns, Toan and Lunde, New York. It forms part of a complex with the John P. Robarts Research Library for the Humanities and Social Sciences, and the Claude Bissel Building which houses the Faculty of Information.

Richard Landon, the director until his death in 2011, organized two or three exhibitions of rare books and other materials annually.

==Collections==
Among the collection&#x27;s items are the &quot;Nuremberg Chronicle&quot; (1493), Shakespeare&#x27;s First Folio (1623), and Newton&#x27;s &quot;Principia&quot; (1687). Contrary to widespread internet claims, 
the library does not have Darwin&#x27;s proof copy with annotations of &quot;On the Origin of Species&quot; (1859); the library does however have annotated proof sheets of: &quot;The Power of Movement in Plants&quot;, &quot;The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals&quot;, and &quot;The Effects of Cross and Self Fertilisation in the Vegetable Kingdom&quot;. Other collections include Babylonian cuneiform tablet from Ur (1789 BC), 36 Egyptian papyrus manuscript fragments (245 BC), and Catholicon (1460).

The Robert S. Kenny Collection resides in the library. This immense collection of books, documents, and other materials pertaining to the radical and labour movements, particularly in Canada, contains approximately 25,000 items collected by Robert S. Kenny, who was a member of the Communist Party of Canada. The Canadian section, which has 382 books and 768 pamphlets, was acquired by the library from Kenny in 1977. The international section of the collection was donated by Kenny in 1993.

In addition, there is a collection of etchings by Wenceslaus Hollar (1607–1677) from the collection of Sidney Thomson Fisher. The collection consists of etching plates, original prints and published works by Wenceslaus Hollar.

The library has a collection of 500 Valentines.

In April 2018, it was announced that the library had acquired the oldest English-language book in Canada, and its 15 millionth item, known as the &quot;Caxton Cicero&quot;, which was printed in 1481 by the Englishman William Caxton.

<text>The Last House on the Left is a 1972 rape and revenge horror film written and directed by Wes Craven in his directorial debut, and produced by Sean S. Cunningham. The film stars Sandra Peabody, Lucy Grantham, David Hess, Fred J. Lincoln, Jeramie Rain, and Marc Sheffler. Additionally, Martin Kove appears in a supporting role. The plot follows Mari Collingwood (Peabody), a teenager who is abducted, raped, and brutally murdered by a group of violent fugitives led by Krug Stillo (Hess). When her parents discover what happened to her, they seek vengeance against the killers, who have taken shelter at their home.

Craven based it on the 1960 Swedish film &quot;The Virgin Spring&quot;, directed by Ingmar Bergman, which in turn is an adaptation of the Swedish ballad &quot;Töres döttrar i Wänge&quot;. Cunningham produced the film for $90,000 and used a cast of relatively unknown actors. Distributor Hallmark Releasing, in partnership with American International Pictures, gave him and Craven funding after the box office success of Cunningham&#x27;s &quot;Together&quot; (1971).

Craven cut the film numerous times for the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) to rate it R. Internationally, the United Kingdom refused to certify the film for release, and while briefly released on home video in the 1980s, the &quot;video nasty&quot; scare led to the banning of the film until 2002. &quot;The Last House on the Left&quot; was released in the United States on August 30, 1972. While the film initially received a polarizing reception from critics, it was highly profitable, grossing over $3 million at the domestic box office.

Like the exploitation films &quot;Night of the Living Dead&quot; (1968) and &quot;The Texas Chain Saw Massacre&quot; (1974), the film has received critical reevaluation years after release, with particular praise towards the narrative and performances of Peabody and Hess. It has since achieved a cult following and received a nomination for AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Thrills in 2001. The film was remade in 2009.

==Plot==

Mari Collingwood plans to attend a concert with her friend Phyllis Stone for her 17th birthday. Mari&#x27;s parents, Estelle and John, express concern about her friendship with Phyllis, but they let her go and give her a peace symbol necklace. Phyllis and Mari head into the city, and on the way, they hear a news report of a recent prison escape involving criminals Krug Stillo, a sadistic rapist and serial killer; his heroin-addicted son, Junior; Sadie, a promiscuous psychopath and sadist; and Fred &quot;Weasel&quot; Podowski, a child molester, peeping Tom, and murderer. Before the concert, Mari and Phyllis encounter Junior while trying to buy marijuana. He leads them to an apartment where the criminals trap them. Phyllis tries to escape and reason with them, but she fails and is gang-raped. Meanwhile, Mari&#x27;s unsuspecting parents prepare a surprise party for her.

The following day, Mari and Phyllis are bound, gagged, and put in the trunk of Krug&#x27;s car and transported to the woods. Mari recognizes that the road is near her home. Phyllis is forced to urinate in her jeans, and Mari and Phyllis are forced to perform sexual acts on each other. Phyllis distracts the kidnappers to allow Mari to escape but is chased by Sadie and Weasel, while Junior stays behind to guard Mari. Mari tries gaining Junior&#x27;s trust by giving him her necklace and calling him &quot;Willow.&quot; Phyllis stumbles across a cemetery where she is cornered and stabbed by Weasel. She crawls to a nearby tree and is stabbed to death. Mari convinces Junior to let her go, but Krug halts her escape. Krug carves his name into her chest, then rapes her. Mari vomits, quietly says a prayer and walks into a nearby lake, where Krug fatally shoots her.

After they change out of their bloody clothes, the gang goes to the Collingwoods&#x27; home, masquerading as traveling salesmen. Mari&#x27;s parents let them stay overnight. The gang finds photos of Mari and realizes it is her home. Later, when Junior is amid heroin withdrawal, Estelle enters the bathroom to check on him and sees Mari&#x27;s peace symbol necklace around his neck. She finds blood-soaked clothing in their luggage and overhears them talking about Mari&#x27;s death and her disposal in a nearby lake.

Estelle and her husband rush into the woods, where they find Mari&#x27;s body and decide to take revenge. Estelle pretends to seduce Weasel, performs oral sex on him, bites off his penis, and leaves him to bleed to death. John takes his shotgun and shoots at Krug and Sadie. Krug escapes into the living room and overpowers John before manipulating Junior into killing himself. Krug attempts to flee, but after being cornered by a traumatized Sadie and a chainsaw-wielding John, he is hindered by an electrocution booby trap. Sadie, now terrified of both Krug and John, runs outside. After a scuffle between her and Estelle, she falls into the backyard swimming pool where Estelle slits her throat. The sheriff arrives just as John kills Krug with the chainsaw.

==Production==
===Screenplay===
Sean S. Cunningham made his directorial debut with the 1970 white coater film &quot;The Art of Marriage&quot;, which grossed $100,000. The film attracted the attention of Steve Minasian&#x27;s company Hallmark Releasing, which had a distribution partnership with American International Pictures. Cunningham made the 1971 film &quot;Together&quot; as a &quot;better version&quot; of &quot;The Art of Marriage&quot;. Wes Craven, who had no money at the time, was put on the job of synchronizing dailies for &quot;Together&quot; and soon began editing the film with Cunningham, with whom he became good friends. Hallmark bought the film for $10,000, and it was considered a &quot;hit&quot;, prompting the company to persuade Cunningham and Craven to make another film with a bigger budget; the company then gave them $90,000 to shoot a horror film.

Cunningham served as producer and Craven served as writer and director on the project. Written by Craven in 1971, the original script was intended to be a graphic &quot;hardcore&quot; film, with all actors and crew being committed to filming it as such. However, after shooting began, the decision was made to edit the script to be less harsh. This script, written under the title &quot;Night of Vengeance&quot;, has never been released; only a brief glimpse is visible in the featurette &quot;Celluloid Crime of the Century&quot;, a 2003 documentary on the making of the film. The crux of the plot is based on the Swedish ballad &quot;Töres döttrar i Wänge&quot;, which itself was the basis of Ingmar Bergman&#x27;s 1960 film &quot;The Virgin Spring&quot;, of which Craven was an admirer. Craven envisioned a film in which the violence would be shown in detail onscreen, as he felt that many popular films of the era, such as Westerns, glamorized violence and the &quot;vigilante hero&quot;, and gave the public a misleading representation of death in the wake of the Vietnam War.

===Casting===
The majority of the cast of &quot;The Last House on the Left&quot; were inexperienced or first-time actors, with the exception of Richard Towers, Eleanor Shaw and Sandra Peabody, who were all soap opera regulars and had prior film roles. Cunningham and Craven held casting calls for the film at Cunningham&#x27;s office in Midtown Manhattan in late 1971. Peabody, who was returning to New York after a cross-country road trip, signed on to the film after responding to a casting notice in the trade publication &quot;Backstage&quot;. Cunningham and Craven originally wanted her to read for the role of Phyllis; however, after meeting her, they decided to cast her in the lead role of Mari. Shaw was a prominent soap opera actress, and Towers worked as a talent agent in addition to acting. Although she did not recall the specific circumstances of how she became involved with the project, Lucy Grantham was ultimately cast in the role of Mari&#x27;s best friend Phyllis. The role of the lead villain, Krug Stillo, was given to David Hess, also a musician and songwriter. Jeramie Rain, then twenty-one years old, was playing Susan Atkins in an Off-Broadway production based on the Manson family murders. Despite the fact that the original script called for an actress in her forties, Rain was awarded the part of Sadie. Fred Lincoln, who had appeared in pornographic films, was cast as Krug&#x27;s criminal partner, while Mark Sheffler was given the role of Krug&#x27;s heroin-addicted son. Sheffler was a struggling twenty-one year old actor and a client of Towers prior to filming, and was informed of auditions by him. According to Lincoln, he and Peabody were acquaintances and had the same agent at the time.

===Filming===

The film was shot on location for seven days in New York City, as well as Long Island, followed by shoots in rural locations outside of Westport, Connecticut. While filming in Connecticut, the cast and crew spent much time at producer Cunningham&#x27;s family&#x27;s home. According to Craven, the lake sequence was shot in the town reservoir of Weston, Connecticut. Craven sought a &quot;documentary&quot;-style appearance for the film, marked by close-up shots and single-cut takes.

Cunningham later described the film shoot as being &quot;guerrilla-style&quot;, with the crew spontaneously filming at locations and being forced to leave due to lack of permits; in retrospect, Lincoln said that &quot;nobody knew what [they] were doing&quot;. Much of the special effects in the film were achieved practically, some at Lincoln&#x27;s suggestion. For example, for the sequence in which Phyllis is disemboweled, Lincoln helped craft fake intestines with condoms filled with fake blood and sand. For the murder sequence of Sadie in the swimming pool, Rain had a pouch full of fake blood attached underneath her shirt, as well as blood capsules in her mouth, which she manually punctured. Grantham recalled that during the scene in which Hess&#x27;s character tells her to &quot;piss her pants&quot;, she in fact urinated in her jeans. Steve Miner, who would later become a director himself, served as a production assistant on the film.

Hess recalled that much of the cast bonded heavily during the filming process since they were mostly inexperienced actors. In the 2003 documentary &quot;Celluloid Crime of the Century&quot;, Lincoln, Rain and Sheffler recalled similar memories which recounted the making of the film. However, both Hess and director Craven recalled the on-set relationship between Hess and Peabody to be turbulent. Peabody was often treated differently than the rest of the cast to the point that Craven recalled there &quot;not being much acting&quot; during the shooting of the film&#x27;s more violent scenes. Sheffler admitted during a one-on-one sequence with Peabody that he threatened to push her over a cliff if she failed to hit her marks.

Peabody stated that she was genuinely upset during the filming of the more violent scenes as she felt unprepared: &quot;I was upset because I&#x27;m an emotional person, and I reacted to what was going on as if it were real. I had a really hard time with some of scenes, because I had come out of &quot;American Playhouse&quot;, where it was all about preparation, and everything had to be real. I ended up doing a horrible job in the film. I was very upset, and I felt like I should have channeled that, but I couldn&#x27;t... I was a young actress and I was still learning to balance any emotions I had from outside of the film into my scene work.&quot; Hess revealed that he actually got very physical with her during the filming of the rape scene, and that she could not do anything about it once the camera was running. During this particular shot, assistant director Yvonne Hannemann described it as an upsetting shoot, with her having to be consoled by Craven throughout filming. Peabody recalled, &quot;One of the characters was a method actor, so he was trying to live his part... he&#x27;d come after us with a knife at night, trying to freak us out. This was the guy with the dark curly hair [David Hess] - he tried to play his role on and off the set. It was like, &#x27;Lock your doors and windows at night, you don&#x27;t want him to come get you!&#x27; I was scared; I thought this guy had been a killer at some point in his past!&quot; Sandra states that although she was uncertain how a lot of the scenes would turn out, she trusted Craven and Cunningham and their vision for the film.

===Music===
The film&#x27;s soundtrack was written by Stephen Chapin and David Hess (who also played the main antagonist, Krug); Chapin wrote all the incidental music, arrangements and orchestration, as well as all the contracting and producing musicians. The music was deliberately written to break with established, conventional horror film scores at that point, employing a mix of 1960s folk rock and bluegrass. It also ran counter to the horror film convention of punctuating moments of fright with shock effects; during some of the film&#x27;s most violent scenes, music that is completely at odds with the visual content plays.

In 2013, the soundtrack had a re-release on vinyl, compact disc, cassette, and digital download through One Way Static Records. It was also reissued on a limited hand numbered picture disc for Record Store Day 2014.

==Release==
The film underwent multiple title changes, with its investors initially titling it &quot;Sex Crime of the Century&quot;. However, after test screenings were completed, it was decided to change the title to &quot;Krug and Company&quot;, but even this title was found to have little draw during test screenings. A marketing specialist who was an acquaintance of Cunningham&#x27;s proposed the title &quot;The Last House on the Left&quot;, which Craven initially thought was &quot;terrible&quot;. The film was released under this title on August 30, 1972. Like many films during the era, it had a regional expansion to cinemas and drive-in theaters over the course of the next several months, opening in various U.S. cities between September and November 1972. It was frequently shown as part of a double or triple feature with other Hallmark/AIP releases, most notably Mario Bava&#x27;s &quot;Twitch of the Death Nerve&quot;, a film that would also have a considerable impact on the horror genre due to serving as a primary influence on Cunningham&#x27;s later &quot;Friday the 13th&quot; franchise.

Due to its graphic content, the film sparked protests calling for its removal from local theaters throughout the fall of 1972. The Paris Cinema, a movie theater in Pittsfield, Massachusetts, issued an open letter to these criticisms in September 1972, in which it was noted:

Promotional material capitalized on the film&#x27;s graphic content and divisive reception, featuring taglines such as &quot;To avoid fainting, keep repeating &#x27;It&#x27;s only a movie&#x27; ...&quot; Under the &quot;Last House&quot; title, the film proved to be a hit, although anecdotes as to where the advertising campaign originated vary somewhat. Cunningham claims that the marketing specialist who devised the &quot;Last House&quot; title was watching a cut of the film with his wife, who continually covered her eyes, prompting him to tell her that it was &quot;only a movie&quot;. Other origins have been suggested, however, as it had been used twice before: first for H. G. Lewis&#x27;s 1964 splatter film &quot;Color Me Blood Red&quot;, and then for William Castle&#x27;s &quot;Strait-Jacket&quot; the following year. The tagline was so successful that it was re-purposed by many of Hallmark&#x27;s other releases, such as &quot;Don&#x27;t Look in the Basement&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Open the Window&quot;, and other exploitation films, sometimes with a unique spin. A variation was used in the UK for the 1974 double-bill of &quot;Night Of The Bloody Apes&quot; and &quot;Night Of Bloody Horror&quot;. The film&#x27;s title was also imitated, as in the cases of &quot;Last House on Dead End Street&quot;, and &quot;The House on the Edge of the Park&quot;, another film starring David Hess; other films, such as the aforementioned &quot;Twitch of the Death Nerve&quot;, were later marketed as unofficial sequels with such titles as &quot;Last House Part II&quot;.

Newspaper advertisements featured lengthy statements from the film&#x27;s producers defending it against claims that it sensationalized violence, one of which noted: &quot;You will hate the people who perpetrate these outragesand you should! But if a movieand it is only a moviecan arouse you to such extreme emotion then the film director has succeeded ... The movie makes a plea for an end to all the senseless violence and inhuman cruelty that has become so much a part of the times in which we live.&quot; Promotional artwork accompanying such statements included a warning that the film was &quot;not recommended for persons under 30&quot;. The film continued to be screened throughout the United States into 1973.

==Censorship==
===United States===
Though the film passed with an R-rating by the Motion Picture Association of America after numerous cuts were made, director Craven claimed that on several occasions, horrified audience members would demand that theater projectionists destroy the footage, sometimes stealing the film themselves. John Saco, a British film archivist, recalled discussing the film with American theater owners: &quot;Projectionists were so offended, they would just cut up the film as they were watching it. I&#x27;d ask people, &#x27;How cut is your version?&#x27; They&#x27;d say, &#x27;It&#x27;s not as cut as some of the others I&#x27;ve seen&#x27; – that&#x27;s hardly what you want to hear!&quot;

===United Kingdom===
&quot;Last House on the Left&quot; was refused a certificate for cinema release by the British Board of Film Censors in 1974, due to scenes of explicit and sadistic sexual violence and humiliation. During the early 1980s home video boom, the film was released uncut (save for an incidental, gore-free scene with the comic relief cops, and the end credit roll), as video did not fall under the BBFC&#x27;s remit at the time. This changed in 1982 when the &quot;video nasty&quot; scare started, leading to the Video Recordings Act 1984. The movie landed on the Department of Public Prosecutions list of &quot;video nasties&quot;, and was banned.

The film remained banned throughout the remainder of the 1980s and into the 1990s. However, it had developed an underground cult reputation in the UK, and critics such as Mark Kermode began to laud the film as an important piece of work. In 2000, the film was again presented to the BBFC for theatrical certification and it was again refused. The independent film label Blue Underground toured an uncut print around Britain without a BBFC certificate; Southampton City Council granted it its own &quot;18&quot; certificate. The film was granted a license for a one-off showing in Leicester in June 2000, after which the BBFC again declared that it would not receive any form of certification.

In June 2002 the BBFC prevailed against an appeal made to the Video Appeals Committee by video distributor Blue Underground Limited. The BBFC had required 16 seconds of cuts to scenes of sexual violence before it would grant the video an &quot;18&quot; certificate. Blue Underground Limited refused to make the cuts, and the BBFC therefore rejected the video. The distributor then appealed to the Video Appeals Committee, who upheld the BBFC&#x27;s decision. During the appeal, film critic Kermode was called in as a horror expert to make a case for the film&#x27;s historical importance. However, after his report, the committee not only upheld the cuts, but demanded additional ones. The film was eventually given an &quot;18&quot; certificate, on July 17, 2002, with 31 seconds of cuts, and was released in the UK on DVD in May 2003. The cut scenes were viewable as a slideshow extra on the disc, and there was a link to a website where the cut scenes could be viewed. The BBFC finally classified the uncut film at 18 for video release on March 17, 2008.

===Australia===
Contrary to popular belief, the film was never banned in Australia on its initial release – rather, it was never picked up for distribution in the country due to the censorship issues that it would have created at the time. The film was submitted to the censorship board in 1987 for VHS release by Video Excellence under the alternative title &quot;Krug and Company&quot;, but it was rejected because of its violent and sexual content. In October 1991, &quot;The Last House on the Left&quot; was part of a package of fifteen tapes that was seized by the Australian Customs Service. The package of tapes was forwarded to the Australian Classification Board (then known as the Office of Film and Literature Classification) who declared them &quot;prohibited pursuant to Regulation 4A(1A)(a)(iii) of the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations&quot;. The film was eventually classified &quot;R&quot; by the OFLC for its DVD premiere on November 15, 2004. It had a theatrical screening that same month at the Australian Centre for the Moving Image in Melbourne.

===New Zealand===
The film was banned by New Zealand&#x27;s Video Recordings Authority in 1988. The ban was lifted in 2004 when the DVD was passed with an R18 rating.

===Rare or lost scenes===
Many different versions of the film exist on various DVD and VHS releases struck from different cuts of the film, many of them from different countries. To get a completely uncut version is difficult as even some cinema machinists cut footage from prints of the movie before screening it during the 1970s; many copies were cut or &quot;hacked to pieces&quot; and because of this, some scenes have become rarities.

Some incomplete scenes are:
* &quot;Lesbian rape scene&quot; – One scene long thought lost, except as a photographic still, is the two female victims forced to commit sexual acts on each other in the woods. This forced lesbian rape scene was included as an outtake with no sound on the Metrodome Three-Disc DVD Ultimate Edition and on the 2011 Blu-ray release.
* &quot;Mari in her room&quot; – In the beginning of the movie, photographic stills show Mari in her room reading birthday cards while she is nude; this scene no longer exists.
* &quot;Mari raped by Sadie&quot; – Footage of Sadie committing sexual acts against Mari in the woods is often removed, even from some DVDs that have been labeled as &quot;uncut&quot;.

In the &quot;Krug and Company&quot; cut, Mari is still alive when her parents find her. She tells her parents what happened to her and Phyllis before dying in front of them.

==Home media==
&quot;The Last House on the Left&quot; has been released multiple times on home media in the United States; MGM Home Entertainment released a DVD version on August 27, 2002, which featured outtakes, a making-of documentary, and &quot;Forbidden Footage&quot;, a featurette exploring the film&#x27;s most violent shocking sequences. On February 1, 2011, a Blu-ray was released by MGM through 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment, which featured multiple featurettes and making-of documentaries, two audio commentary tracks, never-before-seen footage, and cast and crew interviews.

A limited edition Blu-ray box set was released in the United States and United Kingdom on July 3, 2018, from Arrow Video, which features three different cuts of the film each restored in 2K from the original film elements, a double-sided poster, lobby card reproductions, a book featuring writings on the film, a CD soundtrack, various archival bonus materials, and new interviews with cast, crew, and associates of Craven.

==Critical response==
===Contemporary===
Critical response to &quot;The Last House on the Left&quot; upon its original release was largely centered on its depictions of violence. Gene Siskel of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; derided the film, writing: &quot;My objection to &quot;The Last House on the Left&quot; is not an objection to the graphic representations of violence per se, but to the fact that the movie celebrates violent acts, particularly adult male abuse of young women ... I felt a professional obligation to stick around to see if there was any socially redeeming value in the remainder of the movie and found none.&quot; Howard Thompson of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that he walked out of the theater during a screening: &quot;When I walked out, after 50 minutes (with 35 to go), one girl had just been dismembered with a machete. They had started in on the other with a slow switch blade. The party who wrote this sickening tripe and also directed the inept actors is Wes Craven. It&#x27;s at the Penthouse Theater, for anyone interested in paying to see repulsive people and human agony.&quot;

Edward Blank of the &quot;Pittsburgh Press&quot; called the film a &quot;cheap-jack movie of no discernible merit [...] riddled with awkward, self-conscious performances.&quot; Roger Ebert, however, gave the film three and a half out of four stars, and described it as &quot;about four times as good as you&#x27;d expect&quot;. &quot;The Christian Science Monitor&quot; News Service referred to the film as a &quot;desperately sordid melodrama&quot; and a &quot;vulgarized&quot; version of &quot;The Virgin Spring&quot;, and drew comparisons to Sam Peckinpah&#x27;s 1971 film &quot;Straw Dogs&quot;. Brian Nelson of &quot;The Daily Dispatch&quot; deemed it the worst film of the year, writing: &quot;Producer Sean S. Cunningham has somehow managed to make what is possibly 1972&#x27;s most worthless general release film and, with a sensational and overblown advertising campaign, parlay it into a major moneymaker. In doing so, he may be in line for the Cy Dung Award for the movie most offensive to the intelligence of an audience.&quot; The &quot;Lubbock Avalanche-Journal&quot;″s Bill Towery suggested the film should have received an X rating, adding in his review: &quot;Films such as these give the movie ratings system a bad name. But if your cup of tea is assault, murder, maiming, revenge, and violence, the movie is going to be perfect.&quot;

===Modern assessment===

On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;The Last House on the Left&quot; holds an approval rating of 65%, based on 40 reviews, and an average rating of 6.3/10. Its consensus reads, &quot;Its visceral brutality is more repulsive than engrossing, but &quot;The Last House on the Left&quot; nevertheless introduces director Wes Craven as a distinctive voice in horror.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 68 out of 100, based on 8 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

Author and film critic Leonard Maltin awarded the film one-and-a-half out of a possible four stars. Maltin called the film &quot;cheap&quot;, and &quot;[a] repellent but admittedly powerful and (for better or worse) influential horror shocker.&quot; The film was nominated for AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Thrills.

==Related works==
===Sequel===
In the 1980s, Vestron Pictures hired Danny Steinmann to write and direct a sequel, though the film fell apart in pre-production due to rights issues. Mario Bava&#x27;s film &quot;Twitch of the Death Nerve&quot; was also released under the titles &quot;Last House on the Left – Part II&quot;, &quot;Last House – Part II&quot; and &quot;New House on the Left&quot;.

===Remake===

In August 2006, Rogue Pictures finalized a deal to remake &quot;The Last House on the Left&quot; with original writer and director Wes Craven as a producer. The company intended to preserve the storyline of the original film. Craven described his involvement with the remake: &quot;I&#x27;m far enough removed from these films that the remakes are a little like having grandchildren. The story, about the painful side effects of revenge, is an evergreen. The headlines are full of people and nations taking revenge and getting caught up in endless cycles of violence.&quot; Craven formed Midnight Pictures, a shingle of Rogue, to remake &quot;The Last House on the Left&quot; as its first project. Production was slated for early 2007. Screenwriter Adam Alleca was hired to write the script for the remake.

In May 2007, Rogue entered negotiations with director Dennis Iliadis to direct the film. The film was released to theaters in the U.S. and Canada on March 13, 2009.

<doc id="461337" wikidata="Q5011445" url="?curid=461337" title="Celtiberians">
<text>The Celtiberians were a group of Celts and Celticized peoples inhabiting an area in the central-northeastern Iberian Peninsula during the final centuries BC. They were explicitly mentioned as being Celts by several classic authors (e.g. Strabo). These tribes spoke the Celtiberian language and wrote it by adapting the Iberian alphabet, in the form of the Celtiberian script. The numerous inscriptions that have been discovered, some of them extensive, have enabled scholars to classify the Celtiberian language as a Celtic language, one of the Hispano-Celtic (also known as Iberian Celtic) languages that were spoken in pre-Roman and early Roman Iberia. Archaeologically, many elements link Celtiberians with Celts in Central Europe, but also show large differences with both the Hallstatt culture and La Tène culture.

There is no complete agreement on the exact definition of Celtiberians among classical authors, nor modern scholars. The Ebro river clearly divides the Celtiberian areas from non-Indo-European speaking peoples. In other directions, the demarcation is less clear. Most scholars include the Arevaci, Pellendones, Belli, Titti and Lusones as Celtiberian tribes, and occasionally the Berones, Vaccaei, Carpetani, Olcades or Lobetani.

In 195 BC, part of Celtiberia was conquered by the Romans, and by 72 BC the entire region had become part of the Roman province of Hispania Citerior. The subjugated Celtiberians waged a protracted struggle against the Roman conquerors, staging uprisings in 195–193 BC, 181–179 BC, 153–151 BC, and 143–133 BC. In 105 BC, Celtiberian warriors drove the Germanic Cimbri from Spain in the Cimbrian War (113–101 BC) and also played an important role in the Sertorian War (80–72 BC).

==Etymology==

The term &quot;Celtiberi&quot; appears in accounts by Diodorus Siculus, Appian and Martial who recognized intermarriage between Celts and Iberians after a period of continuous warfare, though Barry Cunliffe says &quot;this has the ring of guesswork about it.&quot; Strabo just saw the Celtiberians as a branch of the &quot;Celti&quot;. Pliny the Elder thought that the original home of the Celts in Iberia was the territory of the Celtici in the south-west, on the grounds of an identity of sacred rites, language, and the names of cities.

==History==
===Early history===
Strabo cites Ephorus&#x27;s belief that there were Celts in the Iberian peninsula as far as Cádiz. 

Celtic presence in Iberia likely dates to as early as the 6th century BC, when the &quot;castros&quot; evinced a new permanence with stone walls and protective ditches. Archaeologists Martín Almagro Gorbea and Alberto José Lorrio Alvarado recognize the distinguishing iron tools and extended family social structure of developed Celtiberian culture as evolving from the archaic &quot;castro&quot; culture which they consider &quot;proto-Celtic&quot;.

Archaeological finds identify the culture as continuous with the culture reported by Classical writers from the late 3rd century onwards (Almagro-Gorbea and Lorrio). The ethnic map of Celtiberia was highly localized however, composed of different tribes and &quot;nations&quot; from the 3rd century centered upon fortified &quot;oppida&quot; and representing a wide-ranging degree of local assimilation with the autochthonous cultures in a mixed Celtic and Iberian stock.
The cultural stronghold of Celtiberians was the northern area of the central &quot;meseta&quot; in the upper valleys of the Tagus and Douro east to the &quot;Iberus&quot; (Ebro) river, in the modern provinces of Soria, Guadalajara, Zaragoza and Teruel. There, when Greek and Roman geographers and historians encountered them, the established Celtiberians were controlled by a military aristocracy that had become a hereditary elite. The dominant tribe were the Arevaci, who dominated their neighbors from powerful strongholds at Okilis (Medinaceli) and who rallied the long Celtiberian resistance to Rome. Other Celtiberians were the Belli and Titti in the Jalón valley, and the Lusones to the east.

Excavations at the Celtiberian strongholds &quot;Kontebakom-Bel&quot; Botorrita, &quot;Sekaisa&quot; Segeda, Termantia complement the grave goods found in Celtiberian cemeteries, where aristocratic tombs of the 6th to 5th centuries BC give way to warrior tombs with a tendency from the 3rd century BC for weapons to disappear from grave goods, either indicating an increased urgency for their distribution among living fighters or, as Almagro-Gorbea and Lorrio think, the increased urbanization of Celtiberian society. Many late Celtiberian &quot;oppida&quot; are still occupied by modern towns, inhibiting archaeology.

Metalwork stands out in Celtiberian archaeological finds, partly from its indestructible nature, emphasizing Celtiberian articles of warlike uses, horse trappings and prestige weapons. The two-edged sword adopted by the Romans was previously in use among the Celtiberians, and Latin &quot;lancea&quot;, a thrown spear, was a Hispanic word, according to Varro. Celtiberian culture was increasingly influenced by Rome in the two final centuries BC.

From the 3rd century, the clan was superseded as the basic Celtiberian political unit by the &quot;oppidum&quot;, a fortified organized city with a defined territory that included the &quot;castros&quot; as subsidiary settlements. These &quot;civitates&quot; as the Roman historians called them, could make and break alliances, as surviving inscribed hospitality pacts attest, and minted coinage. The old clan structures lasted in the formation of the Celtiberian armies, organized along clan-structure lines, with consequent losses of strategic and tactical control.

===Late period===
The Celtiberians were the most influential ethnic group in Iberia when the Mediterranean powers (Carthage and Rome) started their conquests. In 220 BC, the Punic army was attacked when preparing to cross the Tagus river by a coalition of Vaccei, Carpetani and Olcades. Despite these clashes, during the Second Punic War the Celtiberians served most often as allies or mercenaries of Carthage in its conflict with Rome, and crossed the Alps in the mixed forces under Hannibal&#x27;s command. Under Scipio Africanus, the Romans were able to secure alliances and change the allegiances of many Celtiberian tribes, using these allied warriors against the Carthaginian forces and allies in Spain. After the conflict, Rome took possession of the Punic empire in Spain, and some Celtiberians soon challenged the new dominant power that loomed in the borders of its territory. Tiberius Sempronius Gracchus spent the years 182 to 179 pacifying the Celtiberians. Gracchus boasted of destroying over 300 Celtiberian settlements.

In 155 BC, a raid into Hispania Ulterior (Farther Spain) by the Lusitani and the defeat of two successive Roman praetors encouraged the town of Segeda in Hispania Citerior (Nearer Spain) to rebel. The following year, it refused to pay tribute or provide a military contingent to Rome but formed instead a confederacy with neighboring towns and began the construction of a defensive wall. Quintus Fulvius Nobilior was sent against the Celtiberians in 153 BC, with nearly 30,000 men. But the consul was late in arriving and ambushed soon after, with 6,000 Romans slain. A siege of Numantia several days later, where the Segedans had taken refuge, was no more successful. Three elephants were brought up against the town walls but became frightened and turned on the Romans, who retreated in confusion. There were other setbacks, and the hapless Nobilior was obliged to withdraw to camp, where more men suffered frostbite and died of the winter cold. Nobilior lost over 10,000 men in his campaign. In 137 BC, the Celtiberians forced the surrender of a 20,000-man Roman consular army led by Gaius Hostilius Mancinus. In 134 BC, the consul Scipio Aemilianus took charge of the demoralized Roman troops in Spain and laid siege to Numantia.
Nearby fields were laid waste and what was not used burned. The stronghold of Numantia then was circumvallated with a ditch and palisade, behind which was a wall ten feet high. Towers were placed every hundred feet and mounted with catapults and ballistae. To blockade the nearby river, logs were placed in the water, moored by ropes on the shore. Knives and spear heads were embedded in the wood, which rotated in the strong current. Allied tribes were ordered to send reinforcements. Even Jugurtha, who later would revolt from Rome, himself, was sent from Numidia with twelve war elephants. The Roman forces now numbered 60,000 men and were arrayed around the besieged town in seven camps. The Numantines, &quot;ready though they were to die, no opportunity was given them of fighting&quot;.

There were several desperate attempts to break out but they were repulsed. Nor could there be any help from neighboring towns. Eventually, as their hunger increased, envoys were sent to Scipio, asking if they would be treated with moderation if they surrendered, pleading that they had fought for their women and children, and the freedom of their country. But Scipio would accept only &quot;deditio&quot; (surrender). Hearing this demand for absolute submission, the Numantines, &quot;who were previously savage in temper because of their absolute freedom and quite unaccustomed to obey the orders of others, and were now wilder than ever and beside themselves by reason of their hardships,&quot; slew their own ambassadors.

After eight months, the starving population was reduced to cannibalism and, filthy and foul smelling, compelled to surrender. But, &quot;such was the love of liberty and of valour which existed in this small barbarian town,&quot; relates Appian, that many chose to kill themselves rather than capitulate. Families poisoned themselves, weapons were burned, and the beleaguered town set ablaze. There had been only about 8,000 fighting men when the war began; half that number survived to garrison Numantia. Only a pitiable few survived to walk in Scipio&#x27;s triumph. The others were sold as slaves and the town razed to the ground, the territory divided among its neighbors.
After Numantia was finally taken and destroyed, Roman cultural influences increased; this is the period of the earliest Botorrita inscribed plaque; later plaques, significantly, are inscribed in Latin. The Sertorian War (80–72 BC) marked the last formal resistance of the Celtiberian cities to Roman domination, which submerged the Celtiberian culture.

The Celtiberian presence remains on the map of Spain in hundreds of Celtic place-names. The archaeological recovery of Celtiberian culture commenced with the excavations of Numantia, published between 1914 and 1931.

A Roman army auxiliary unit, the Cohors I Celtiberorum, is known from Britain, attested by 2nd century AD discharge diplomas.

==Genetics==
In a March 2019 genetic study published in &quot;Science&quot;, three Celtiberians buried at La Hoya, Alava (in Beron territory) between 400 BC and 195 BC were examined. They had high levels of north-central European ancestry compared to non-Celtic populations of Iberia. One of the males examined was found to be a carrier of the paternal haplogroup I2a1a1a.

<doc id="461343" wikidata="Q1016878" url="?curid=461343" title="Mildenhall, Suffolk">
<text>Mildenhall is a market town in the civil parish of Mildenhall High, in the West Suffolk district, in the county of Suffolk, England. The town is near the A11, and is north-west of Ipswich. The large Royal Air Force station, RAF Mildenhall, as well as RAF Lakenheath, are located north of the town. Both are used by the United States Air Force and Mildenhall is the headquarters of its 100th Air Refueling Wing and 352nd Special Operations Group. Mildenhall is often seen as the start of The Fens on the south/east.


== History ==
=== Early history ===
The area around Mildenhall has been settled by humans since at least the Bronze Age. Following the Roman Empire invasion of Britain, Mildenhall was the site of a Roman settlement, which at some point contained the Mildenhall Treasure.

The name of the town was first recorded in 1050 as &quot;Mildenhale&quot;, believed to mean a nook of land belonging to a woman called &quot;Milde&quot; or a man called &quot;Milda&quot;. In 1086, the Domesday Book recorded that the town was the property of the Abbot of St Edmunds and had a population of some 64 families.

=== Early Modern history ===
With the Dissolution of the Monasteries in 1536, ownership of the town was transferred to Edward North, 1st Baron North, whose son, Roger North, lived in Mildenhall for a time. Ownership of the Mildenhall estate remained with the North family for many decades. It was Henry North who, upon retirement, built the Manor house at Mildenhall.

Sir Henry North was elected MP for Suffolk in 1685, but he died a bachelor and so ownership of the estate passed to Sir Thomas Hanmer. Hanmer was elected Speaker of the House of Commons in 1714 and spent little time in his estate. He also died without an heir, and ownership then passed to Thomas Bunbury, who also became MP for Suffolk.
In 1810 Joseph Smedley was able to hire a building as a temporary theatre for £2.

=== Modern history ===
The Bunbury family held the manor of Mildenhall until the estate was broken up in 1933. RAF Mildenhall was officially opened in 1934 and served as a base for RAF Bomber Command during the Second World War. In 1950, the US Air Force took over its operation.

On 1 April 2019 the parish of West Row was split from Mildenhall, on 10 October 2023 the parish was renamed from &quot;Mildenhall&quot; to &quot;Mildenhall High&quot;.

==The town==
Mildenhall is centred on a market place with a 16th-century hexagonal market cross and town pump. The town&#x27;s market is held here every Friday; it originated as a weekly chartered market in (it is believed) the 15th century. In 1934 Mildenhall was the start point of the MacRobertson Air Race to Melbourne, Australia.

The town is the subject and namesake of a song by The Shins, as well as being mentioned in passing in the Pink Floyd song &quot;Let There Be More Light&quot; on the 1968 album &quot;A Saucerful of Secrets&quot; as a speculated location for first contact between humanity and extraterrestrial life:

:&quot;Then at last, the mighty ship&quot;
:&quot;Descending on a point of flame&quot;
:&quot;Made contact with the human race at Mildenhall&quot;

Due to the airfield, Mildenhall currently has the highest concentration of U.S. citizens in the country. In 2005, as many as 30% of residents were born in the U.S.

== Transport ==
The town has a bus station, which was completed in 2005. Regular bus services run to the neighbouring towns of Brandon, Bury St. Edmunds, Newmarket and Thetford. National Express operate daily coach services to Norwich, London (Victoria Coach Station), Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted Airports. Mildenhall railway station was the terminus of the Cambridge to Mildenhall railway until its closure in 1962.

==Education==
Mildenhall has two primary schools: St. Mary&#x27;s and Great Heath
and one secondary school: Mildenhall College Academy. The secondary school also contains a sixth form.

==Sport and leisure==
Mildenhall has a non-League football club, Mildenhall Town F.C., who play at Recreation Way.Mildenhall currently play in the Isthmian League North after winning the Thurlow Nunn League for a second time in 2023/24 season.

It also has one of the East of England&#x27;s leading cricket clubs, Mildenhall Cricket Club, playing at Wamil Way. In 2016 the 1st XI won the Two Counties Championship and was promoted to the East Anglian Premier Cricket League. Notable former players include England internationals Tymal Mills and Tom Westley and Essex Women&#x27;s Lilly Reynolds.

The Mildenhall Cycling Club is located next to the cricket ground, and has famous previous members such as Victoria Pendleton.

A modern leisure centre is based at Mildenhall Hub and is run by Abbeycroft Leisure. It boasts a swimming pool, a gym, fitness classes, a sports hall for racquet sports and outdoor pitches for football. Over the last few years, the Mildenhall community have been inspired to get active through running with the start-up of a 5km parkrun event held every Saturday and a 2km junior parkrun event held every Sunday encouraging runners, joggers and walkers of all abilities to take part for free in an inclusive environment supported by volunteers. These events are both held at the Mildenhall Hub.

The River Lark runs through the town, and there is a 19-acre open space adjoining it, called the Jubilee Fields.

Roald Dahl wrote an article about the find which was published first in the &quot;Saturday Evening Post&quot;, and later as &quot;The Mildenhall Treasure&quot; (a short story) in his short story collection &quot;The Wonderful Story of Henry Sugar and Six More&quot;.

<text>A unisex name (also known as an epicene name, a gender-neutral name or an androgynous name) is a given name that is not gender-specific. Unisex names are common in the English-speaking world, especially in the United States. By contrast, some countries have laws preventing unisex names, requiring parents to give their children sex-specific names. In other countries or cultures, social norms oppose such names and transgressions may result in discrimination, ridicule, and psychological abuse.

Names may have different gender connotations from country to country or language to language. For example, the Italian male name &quot;Andrea&quot; (derived from Greek &quot;Andreas&quot;) is understood as a female name in many languages, such as English, German, Hungarian, Czech, and Spanish.

Parents may name their child in honor of a person of another sex, which – if done widely – can result in the name becoming unisex. For example, Christians, particularly Catholics, may give a child a second/middle name of the opposite sex, e.g. name a son Marie or Maria in honor of the Virgin Mary or formerly Anne for Saint Anne; or name a daughter José in honor of Saint Joseph or Jean in honor of John the Baptist. 

In the United States, one popular names website considers a name unisex if Census Bureau and Social Security Administration data shows a name is assigned to a particular gender less than 95 percent of the time.

Some masculine and feminine names are homophones, pronounced the same for both sexes but spelled differently. These names are not strictly unisex names.

===Chinese===
Chinese given names are composed of 1–3 Chinese characters, with the exception of non-Han ethnic groups who sometimes choose to use their native naming traditions instead and transliterate their names to Chinese for legal registration, often ending up in very long Chinese full names. Some characters have masculine connotations tied to them (for example, 偉 (wěi), 冠 (guàn), 宏 (hóng), 廷 (tíng), 傑 (jié), 豪 (háo)), some have feminine connotations (for example, 娟 (juān), 妍 (yán), 淑 (shú), 卉 (huì), 晴 (qíng), 薇 (wéi)), and some can be fully gender-neutral or will only gain a masculine/feminine leaning when paired with another character that has a specific leaning (for example, 家 (jiā), 安 (ān), 子 (zǐ), 文 (wén), 品 (pǐn), 華 (huá)). Some Chinese given names may have the same pronunciation, but use different characters associated with different genders to give the name a gender association.

===Hebrew===

Many of the modern Hebrew names have become unisex and are suitable for both boys and girls. Some popular examples are:

===Indian languages===

Many Indian names become unisex when written with Latin characters because of the limitations of transliteration. The spellings &quot;Chandra&quot; and &quot;Krishna&quot;, for example, are transliterations of both the masculine and feminine versions of those names. In Indian languages, the final &quot;a&quot; in each of these names are different letters with different pronunciations, so there is no ambiguity. However, when they are seen (and usually, spoken) by someone unfamiliar with Indian languages, they become sexually ambiguous. Other Indian names, such as &quot;Ananda&quot;, are exclusively or nearly exclusively masculine in India, but because of their &quot;a&quot; ending, are assumed to be feminine in Anglophone societies.

Nehal, Sonal, Sonu, Snehal, Niral, Pranjal and Anmol are used commonly to name baby boys or girls in western states of India such as Gujarat. Similarly, names like Kajal, Sujal, Viral, Harshal, Deepal, Bobby, Mrinal, Jyoti, Shakti, Nilam, Kiran, Lucky, Ashwini, Shashi, Malhar, Umang, Shubham and Anupam are also very common sex-neutral names or unisex names in India. Most Punjabi Sikh first names such as &quot;Sandeep, Gurdeep, Kuldeep, Mandeep&quot;, &quot;Surjeet, Gurjeet, Kuljeet, Harjeet, Manjeet&quot;, &quot;Harpreet, Gurpreet, Jaspreet, Kulpreet, Manpreet&quot;, &quot;Prabhjot, Harjot, Gurjot, Jasjot&quot; and &quot;Sukhjinder, Bhupinder, Jasbinder, Parminder, Kulvinder, Harjinder, Ranjodh, Sheeraz, Hardeep, Kirandeep, Sukhdeep, Govindpal, Encarl, Rajan&quot; are unisex names and equally commonly given to either sex. Also, names derived from Dari Persian and Arabic, but not used among native speakers of those languages, are common among South Asian Muslims. Since Persian does not assign genders to inanimate nouns, some of these names are gender-neutral, for example Roshan, Hitesh, Sudesh, Parveen, and Insaaf.

===Japanese===

Despite there being only a small number of Japanese unisex names in use, unisex names are widely popular. Many high-profile Japanese celebrities such as Hikaru Utada, Jun Matsumoto, Ryo Nishikido, and Izumi Sakai have unisex names.

Many of the entries in the following list, in Roman characters, each represent more than one name, with different meanings, which are often distinguished by the use of different kanji characters.

====Nicknames====
Unisex names may also be used as nicknames. For example, a man named Ryounosuke and a woman named Ryouko may both use the unisex name Ryou as a nickname.

===Kazakh===
Unisex names in Kazakhstan are not seldom. About 500 000 (3.9%) Kazakh people in Kazakhstan have 294 Unisex names with 10% threshold.

===Vietnamese===

Among modern Vietnamese names, unisex names are very popular. Vietnamese people may distinguish unisex names by middle names. For example, Quốc Khánh may be a male name (Quốc is a male name) and Ngân Khánh may be a female name (Ngân is a female name), and sex-specific middle names such as &quot;Văn&quot; for males and &quot;Thị&quot; for females also help. In many cases, a male could have a female name and vice versa. Popular examples of unisex names in Vietnamese are:

* Anh (beautiful, outstanding, hero)
* An (safe and sound)
* Bình (peaceful)
* Châu (pearl)
* Dương (light, sun)
* Giang (big river)
* Hà (river)
* Hải (sea)
* Khánh (joyful celebration, bell)
* Linh (divinity, essence, spirit, soul)
* Nhân (kindness, humanity)
* Thanh (clear, pure, distinct, youth, young, cyan)
* Tú (elegant, talented person)

* Sang (bright, luxurious)

* Ekai

*Joar

=== Serbo-Croatian ===

* Matija (generally male, but female in the Neretva region)

=== Czech ===
Up until December 31, 2021, the Czech Registry Act forbade giving male names or surnames to females or female names or surnames to males, but did not restrict neutral names and surnames. As of January 1, 2022, females are now allowed to request a male surname for themselves or for their children without any additional paperwork. For the period of transitioning, the Act explicitly allows the use of gender-neutral given names and surnames.

As of July 2023, the MVČR or Internal Ministry of the Czech Republic, officially released a list of 4,000 gender-neutral names that can be used by citizens, particularly aimed toward transgender people needing a gender neutral name during their transition (or otherwise a name that does not require a legal gender change to use).

=== Dutch ===
This is a list of the 20 most common names of which at least 10% are of the other sex.

===Finnish===

Finnish law forbids giving a female name to a male child and a male name to a female child among other restrictions. Some names do exist that have been given to children of both genders. Such unisex names were more common in the first half of the 20th century. This is an incomplete list:
Many of these names are rare, foreign or neologisms; established names tend to be strongly sex-specific. Notably, a class of names that are derived from nature can be often used for either sex, for example: Aalto (wave), Halla (frost), Lumi (snow), Paju (willow), Ruska (fall colors), and Valo (light). Similarly, there are some (sometimes archaic) adjectives which carry no strong gender connotations, like Kaino (timid), Vieno (calm) or Lahja (a gift). Certain names can have unisex diminutives, such as Alex, which can be short for Aleksandra or Aleksanteri (or variants thereof).

===French===

Popular unisex names of French origin include:

There are also pairs of masculine and feminine names that have slightly different spellings but identical pronunciation, such as André / Andrée, Frédéric / Frédérique, René / Renée and Gabriel / Gabrielle. In France and French-speaking countries, it can happen for people to have a combination of both masculine and feminine given names, but most of these include &quot;Marie&quot;, such as Jean-Marie, Marie-Jean, Marie-Pierre. Marie was a unisex name in medieval times; it is nowadays only female except for its presence in compound names. Notable examples of people with a combination of masculine and feminine given names are Jean-Marie Le Pen (male), Marie-Jean Hérault de Séchelles (male), Marie-Pierre Kœnig (male), and Marie-Pierre Leray (female). In the past, it was not unusual to give a child that was assigned male at birth the middle name Marie as a sign of religious devotion; the most notable example is that of François Maurice Marie Mitterrand.

European royals often bear the name Marie, the French form of Maria, in their names. Prince Amedeo of Belgium, Archduke of Austria-Este (Amedeo Marie Joseph Carl Pierre Philippe Paola Marcus), Prince Jean of Luxembourg (Jean Félix Marie Guillaume), and Jean, Grand Duke of Luxembourg (Jean Benoît Guillaume Robert Antoine Louis Marie Adolphe Marc) are examples of male royals who bear Marie in their names.

===German===

In the past, German law required parents to give their child a sex-specific name. In 2008 the Federal Constitutional Court of Germany ruled, that under certain circumstances this cannot be enforced, even if the child has only one given name. The custom of adding a second name which matches the child&#x27;s legal sex is no longer required. Still, unisex names of German origin are rare, most of them being nicknames rather than formal names (such as Alex).

Examples of unisex names include:

* Eike
* Gustl (the male variant is a shortening of &quot;August&quot; or &quot;Gustav&quot;, the female for &quot;Augusta&quot;)
* Kai
* Kim
* Lennox
* Luca
* Micha
* Michi
* Mika
* Niko
* Sascha 
* Sigi

===Icelandic===

In June, 2019, Iceland&#x27;s Parliament, the Althing, passed a new gender autonomy act which will recognize all approved Icelandic names as unisex.

Previously, unisex names were in generally illegal in Iceland. The Icelandic Naming Committee (Icelandic: &quot;Mannanafnanefnd&quot;) maintained preapproved lists of male and female names, with names not on the list - or on a different gender&#x27;s list - typically denied. Earlier court cases had carved out exceptions, such as the names &quot;Blær&quot; (approved for women after a 2013 court case), &quot;Auður&quot; (approved for men later in 2013), and &quot;Alex&quot; (denied for women in 2013 but approved in 2018).

Additionally, the new gender autonomy act makes changes to the traditional patronymics/matronymics used as Icelandic surnames. Before the bill, Icelandic last names (by law) could not be unisex: the suffix &quot;-dóttir&quot; (&quot;daughter&quot;) was attached to a parent&#x27;s name for women and the suffix &quot;-son&quot; (&quot;son&quot;) was used for men. The new law will allow adults who have officially changed their gender marker to &quot;X&quot;, a non-binary gender marker, to also change their patronymic/matronymic suffix to &quot;-bur&quot; (&quot;child&quot;). Newborns cannot be assigned a non-binary gender marker at this time, and will continue to receive a patronymic/matronymic suffix in keeping with their assigned sex at birth.

Among Irish Catholics in the 19th and 20th centuries, it was not unusual to give a child that was assigned male at birth a feminine middle name, particularly &quot;Mary&quot;, as a sign of religious devotion. Joseph Mary Plunkett was a signatory of the Irish Declaration of Independence in 1916, and was later executed as one of the leaders of the Easter Rising.

===Italian===

In Italy, unisex names (&quot;nomi ambigenere&quot;) are very rare. There are names that are primarily male, like Andrea (which is female, e.g., in English, Spanish, German, and French) or Felice, that can also be given to females. Names like Celeste, Amabile, Fiore or Diamante are, as opposite, female names that occasionally can be given to males.

Sometimes &quot;Maria&quot; is used as a middle male name (such as Antonio Maria).

&quot;Loreto&quot; (feminine &quot;Loreta&quot; or &quot;Loretta&quot;) and &quot;Rosario&quot; (feminine: &quot;Rosaria&quot;) are male names in Italian whereas in Spanish they are female.

There are also unisex nicknames, for example:

* Giusi or Giusy can stand either for Giuseppe (&quot;Joseph&quot;) or Giuseppina (&quot;Josephine&quot;).
* Dani or Dany can stand for Daniele (male) or Daniela (female).
* Ale or Alex can stand for Alessandro (male) or Alessandra (female).
* Fede can stand either for Federico or Federica.

===Portuguese===
* Carmo
* Cruz
*Duda

====Brazilian====
Names that end with an &quot;i&quot; are considered unisex in Brazil. They tend to be Native Brazilian Indigenous names in origin, such as Araci, Jaci, Darci, Ubirani, but names from other cultures are now being absorbed, such as Remy, Wendy, and Eddy. Names that end with &quot;ir&quot; and &quot;mar&quot; tend to be unisex also, such as Nadir, Aldenir, Dagmar and Niomar – though in these cases there are some exceptions.

===Russian===
Unisex names are not common in Russian language, however, diminutive forms of names in Russian language can be unisex, such as Sasha/Shura (Alexandr or Alexandra), Zhenya (Yevgeniy or Yevgeniya), Valya (Valentin or Valentina), Valera (Valeriy or Valeriya), Slava (for names ending with -slav or -slava), Vitalya (Vitaly or Vitalia).

===Slovene===
* Fran (diminutive of Frančiška)
* Ivica (diminutive of &quot;Ivan&quot; (John) or &quot;Ivana&quot; (Joanne))
* Saša (diminutive of &quot;Aleksander&quot; (Alexander))
* Slava (diminutive of Slavko)
* Vanja (diminutive of Ivan or Ivana)

===Spanish===

In Spanish, unisex names are rare. Some names for devotional titles of the virgin Mary, such as Guadalupe, Trinidad and Reyes are used for both genders, although more often by women. Epicene names from Basque are sometimes used in non-Basque speaking regions of Spain. Other names adapted from English, French or Hebrew can also be used as unisex. Some names include:

Like in English, some common nicknames are unisex such as Álex (Alejandro, Alejandra), Cris (Cristina, Cristian, Cristóbal), Dani (Daniel, Daniela) and Gabi (Gabriel, Gabriela).

===Swedish===
Swedish unisex names generally follow the tradition as in similar Western countries, including names such as Robin, Kim, Lou and Lee. Unisex names that are particularly Swedish include Mio, after the popular Astrid Lindgren book &quot;Mio, my son&quot;, and Tintin, after the popularity of the Belgian comics character. A more traditional unisex name is Kaj, the male variant might be a Continental loan through Danish, whereas the female variant might be a shortening of Kajsa, from Katarina.

===Turkish===

There are many Turkish names which are unisex. These names are almost always pure Turkish names (i.e. not Turkified Arabic names that have an Islamic connotation) that derive from Turkish words. These names may either be modern names or be derived from Turkic mythology. Some Persian-derived Turkish names, like Can and Cihan, are also unisex, as are even a few Arabic-derived names, like İhsan and Nur.

Among the common examples of the many unisex names in Turkey are:
==English speaking world==

Unisex names have been enjoying some popularity in English-speaking countries in the past several decades. Masculine names have become increasingly popular among females in the past century, while current feminine names were originally common among males. 

Unisex names include:

In the United States, some of the above-mentioned male names are now largely female, while in Britain, they remain largely male. Sometimes different spellings have different sex distributions (Francis is less likely female than Frances), but these are rarely definitive. For example, in the US, as of 2016, both Skylar and Skyler are more common for females, but Skylar is most strongly associated with females (the 42nd most common name for females and the 761 most common for males born in 2016) than Skyler (the 359 most common name for females and the 414 most common for males born in 2016).

Some names are masculine in one culture and feminine in another, so that when these cultures mix in a third location, the same name appears unisex. Examples include Andrea and Nicola, which is predominantly male in Italy, but predominantly female in other countries, or Joan, which is female in English, but male in Catalan.

<text>Redan (a French word for &quot;projection&quot;, &quot;salient&quot;) is a feature of fortifications. It is a work in a V-shaped salient angle towards an expected attack. It can be made from earthworks or other material.

The redan developed from the lunette, originally a half-moon-shaped outwork; with shorter flanks it became a redan.

== History ==
Redans were a common feature in the coastal batteries built in Malta between 1715 and the end of the 18th century. Surviving batteries with redans include Mistra Battery and Saint Anthony&#x27;s Battery.

The Russians used redans on their left at the Battle of Borodino against Napoleon. A small redan whose faces make an obtuse angle with a vertex toward the enemy is called a &quot;flèche&quot; (arrow in French). The &quot;Bagration flèches&quot; were three redans backwards in echelon. The Shevardino Redoubt (another redan) was erected as an early warning post a mile in front of the Bagration flèches.

== Redan hole in golf ==
A &quot;Redan hole&quot; or &quot;Redan&quot; is an aspect of golf course architecture commonly associated with golf architect Charles B. Macdonald. The term alludes to the &quot;Redan&quot; type of fortification. Specifically, a Redan hole has a green which slopes downwards and away from the point of entrance, typically the front right portion of the green. Links golf is played on the ground as much as in the air and, consequently, the green slopes away from the golfer playing to the green from the tee or fairway. Thus, it is often played in an indirect manner; that is, the player plays somewhat away from the target and then allows contours to direct the golf ball to its final resting point.

Macdonald&#x27;s oft-quoted description from &quot;Scotland&#x27;s Gift: Golf&quot; is as follows:
This definition serves well to explain the basic concept. Macdonald built his original American Redan as the fourth hole at the National Golf Links of America, commonly known as NGLA. He and his design cohorts, Seth Raynor and Charles &quot;Steamshovel&quot; Banks built a Redan or a reverse version of it at nearly every course that they constructed. It is a design element that has been copied by modern architects frequently - most notably the husband &amp; wife team of Pete and Alice Dye, and Tom Doak. The design element can be used as a green complex of any &quot;par&quot; hole - a par 3 most commonly, but it may also be used as a par 4 or par 5 green complex.

Many Redan holes are flanked by a variety of deep bunkers, in the typical arrangement one fronts on the left side. The original &quot;Redan&quot; is the 15th hole on the West Links of North Berwick. A frequent feature is a somewhat raised portion of ground, often called a kick mound or kick plate, with or without a bunker to the right (in a traditional Redan) side of the green which can be skillfully used to propel the ball onto the green and nearer the hole by the more skilled golfer. Redan holes in which the green is visible from the tee can produce a particular excitement for the golfer as the ball tracks its way to the hole. At the original Redan design in North Berwick, Scotland, the green is invisible (or blind) from the tee. The NGLA version, more the inspiration for modern copies than the original hole, introduced this concept of green visibility to the design. Many golf architecture connoisseurs feel that the NGLA hole is the perhaps the greatest example of this design, exceeding the original.

==Place names==
In Aldershot, once &#x27;Home of the British Army&#x27;, Redan Road leads from the High Street to the top of a hill where a redan was constructed for training soldiers in Victorian times. The redan was restored by the local council and a replica cannon is installed there above a glacis. At the time of the Crimean War, several public houses in Britain adopted the name. The Redan Inn (now The Quarterdeck) in North Berwick shared its name with the famous hole on the golf course, while there is also a Redan Inn in Chilcompton, Somerset. A street in Shepherd&#x27;s Bush, London is named Redan Street, and there is a street in Ipswich named Redan Street; the pub on the corner of Queensway and Westbourne Grove, London W2, was named The Redan. Its sign carried an illustration purportedly from a Napoleonic era battle, but it was more likely a Crimean War scene. The flag carried was British, but the defenders appeared to be wearing Russian uniform of the mid 19th century. Any engagement between Russians and Napoleonic armies would not have featured a British flag. Pub names like this and the Alma came into prominence after the Crimean War. The Redan public house on Thorpe Road in Norwich (now closed) was originally named &quot;The Hero of the Redan&quot;, in reference to Major-General Charles Ashe Windham who took part in the storming of the Redan at Sevastopol during the Crimean campaign in 1855. An area of Maryhill, Glasgow was known as &#x27;The Redan&#x27; for many years and there is a closed-down pub called &#x27;The Redan&#x27; close to this area on Maryhill Road, Glasgow. There was also a beerhouse called The Redan at the junction of Blue Ball Road and Cross Wells Road, Soyland, near Ripponden, West Yorkshire. It opened in 1890 and closed in 1937. Unfortunately, the pub was later demolished. As at November 2018, CAMRA&#x27;s WhatPub website lists only two extant pubs called the Redan: one in Wokingham, Berkshire and one in Chilcompton, near Bath. 

The census-designated place of Redan, Georgia was likely named for the redans built in the area during the Atlanta Campaign of the American Civil War.

Redan is also a southern suburb of the regional city of Ballarat in central western Victoria, Australia. It was named for the fortifications used during the battle at Sevastopol in Ukraine during the Crimean War.

<text>The Association of Fundamental Baptist Churches in the Philippines (AFBCP) is an organization guiding cooperative ministries of Independent Baptist churches on the islands of the Philippines.

==History==
The &quot;Association of Fundamental Baptist Churches&quot; shares a common early history with the Convention of Philippine Baptist Churches. Both bodies are an outgrowth of the first mission work on the islands. The work began in 1900 with Eric Lund (a Swedish missionary working with the &quot;American Baptist Missionary Union&quot;) and Braulio Manikin (a Filipino converted during Lund&#x27;s work in Spain) on the island of Panay. Neither national organization actually existed at the time of the split.

In 1927, Dr. Raphael C. Thomas was told to give up making evangelistic trips and concentrate his work solely to the hospital in Jaro. This Dr. Thomas refused to do, choosing rather to resign from his work with the &quot;American Baptist Foreign Mission Society&quot; and return to the United States. In August of that year, a group met in Watch Hill, Rhode Island at the invitation of Marguerite Doane (1868–1954; daughter of hymn writer William Doane). Out of this meeting came a new agency for sending and supporting missionaries - the &quot;Association of Baptists for Evangelism in the Orient&quot; (now Association of Baptists for World Evangelism). Dr. Thomas returned to the Philippines in 1928, settling in Manila. The first church established by ABEO and Thomas was the First Baptist Church of Manila.

World War II brought much devastation to Baptist missionary work in the Philippines, and much reorganization was required. The &quot;Association of Fundamental Baptist Churches&quot; was formed in 1948. A &quot;Philippine Association of Baptists for World Evangelism&quot; was organized in 1957 for the purpose of sending missionaries to Borneo. They now have about a dozen missionaries in southeast Asia. 

The &quot;Association of Fundamental Baptist Churches&quot; and the &quot;Association of Bible Believing Churches of the Philippines&quot; reconciled at a convention held in 1997. Together, they have over 2000 churches in the Philippines. Bethel Baptist Hospital is a non-profit institution affiliated with the Association. The Association participates in the &quot;Biblical Baptist Partnership International (formerly called the International Partnership of Fundamental Baptist Ministries or IPFBM)&quot;, and is a member of the &quot;Far Eastern Council of Christian Churches&quot;, and the International Council of Christian Churches. Rev. Levie C. Lumilang as of 2022, serves the body as chairman.

<text>Lochore Welfare Junior Football and Athletic Club are a Scottish football club from the village of Crosshill, Fife. The club currently compete in the . Originally formed in 1934, the club are based at Central Park and their present home colours are black and white.

==History==
Lochore Welfare are a club formed from mergers between various other Junior clubs over the years, firstly with local amateur side, Lochore Miners to become Lochore Miners Welfare. Then, in the late 1990s, it merged with Benarty JFC and reverted to its original name of Lochore Welfare. Crosshill was once a prosperous mining village but the decline of this industry has had a substantial impact on the community and hence the club, although the community is making strong efforts to fight against this.

The club can boast of giving some football&#x27;s talented players their first footing on the ladder to success and stardom. Among these are Willie Johnston, who could often be seen playing for Lochore before going on to play for Rangers and Scotland and Ian Porterfield, whose greatest moment of glory was scoring the winning goal for Sunderland in the 1973 FA Cup Final. Craig Levein was another Lochore old boy who went on to play for Scotland and Hearts and most recently Colin Cameron.

Other Lochore players who have stepped up include Tommy Callaghan with Celtic; Cammy Fraser, Willie Gibson, Arthur Mann, Peter Oliver and Willie Benvie at Hearts; Alec Edwards with Dunfermline and Hibernian; Ian Campbell with Cowdenbeath, Dunfermline and Brechin; Jimmy Logie with Arsenal; Chris Anderson at Blackburn Rovers; Garry Patterson with Dundee.

Former player and captain James Adam took over as manager in October 2018. He is assisted by another two former players; Gary Patterson and James Davies, as well as goalkeeper coach Scott Donaldson.

Lochore moved from the Junior leagues to the East of Scotland League ahead of the 2020–21 season. They won their first trophy in 20 years by securing the King Cup in 2022–23.

==Ground==
Central Park has a capacity of 1,300. There is a small covered enclosure and a refreshment kiosk. The pitch itself was relaid at considerable cost to the club in 1998. Home attendances can reach around 200 for more significant games.

<text>The Grand Rapids Rampage was an arena football team based in Grand Rapids, Michigan. The team began play in 1998 in the Arena Football League as an expansion team. They were last coached by Steve Thonn. Their home arena was the Van Andel Arena.

==History==
In 1997, Dan DeVos was granted an expansion AFL franchise for the 1998 season, and was awarded the remains of the dormant Massachusetts Marauders franchise out of bankruptcy court. That team&#x27;s first incarnation, the Detroit Drive, had been the league&#x27;s first dynasty; the Drive had advanced to the ArenaBowl in all six years they played in Detroit, winning four times. They moved to Worcester, Massachusetts for the 1994 season before folding. Due to the four-year period of dormancy, the Rampage did not claim the Drive/Marauders&#x27; history as their own. Grand Rapids was the smallest market in which the AFL had a franchise at the times of its first/2009 disbanding.

The Rampage played in the Van Andel Arena, which is also the home of the AHL&#x27;s Grand Rapids Griffins. They competed in the Central Division of the American Conference.

The Grand Rapids Rampage started play in 1998 under coach Michael Trigg. In 2001, with notable players Clint Dolezel, and Terrill Shaw, the Rampage went on to win their first ArenaBowl. This game was broadcast live on the ABC Network.

The Rampage&#x27;s official mascot was a Rhinoceros named Blitz.

The Rampage had a rivalry with the Nashville Kats, one which dates back to the original Kats. This rivalry solidified with the Rampage&#x27;s defeat of Nashville in ArenaBowl XV.

The Rampage also shared a rivalry with the Chicago Rush, known as the Amtrak Classic, after the Amtrak railway system which connects the two cities. On July 6, 2008, the Amtrak Classic added an interesting chapter as the Rampage, losers of their last six meetings with Chicago, defeated their heavily favored opponents on the road. Grand Rapids entered the game as a 6 seed, and upended the #1 seeded Rush 58–41, in a game of controversial penalties and brawls.

On March 5, 2010, it was announced that the Rampage were officially out of business and had no plans to return.

==Logo==
The Rampage&#x27;s logo was a red rhinoceros. Its end zone featured the team&#x27;s secondary logo. However, it was changed to &#x27;Arena Football&#x27; during the ArenaBowl in 2001.

==Rampage highlights==
* On Sunday, June 23, 2002, the Rampage hosted a game against the Georgia Force. After a low-scoring first quarter, the Rampage took a 28–15 halftime lead. However, the Force refused to go down, as they had a 41–35 lead with only 12 seconds left in the game. On one play, Quarterback Clint Dolezel threw a game-winning 31-yd touchdown pass to Offensive Specialist Steve Smith (who hadn&#x27;t played a down that game until the final play). The Rampage would win 42–41. On the AFL&#x27;s 20 Greatest Highlights Countdown, this is ranked at #13.
* On Saturday, February 5, 2005, in a road game against their division-rival, the Colorado Crush, Rampage quarterback Michael Bishop became the first Arena Football League player to run for 100 yards in a single game. It was only Bishop&#x27;s third-ever start, yet he accomplished this feat on just six attempts. Despite falling 72–56, Bishop&#x27;s helped set a bold new record. On the AFL&#x27;s 20 Greatest Highlights Countdown, this is ranked at #12.
* In a pregame warm-up, quarterback Michael Bishop threw a pass from one end zone, across the field, through the uprights and into the stands. On the AFL&#x27;s 20 Greatest Highlights Countdown, this is tied at #9.
* On Monday, March 24, 2008, The Rampage set the AFL record for the most points scored in a single game by a road team, beating the Kansas City Brigade 92–52. James Macpherson went 24–27, nine touchdowns, and 307 yards in his first start for the Rampage. MacPherson would later go on to break the franchise record for touchdown passes in a later game.

<doc id="461353" wikidata="Q508841" url="?curid=461353" title="House of Sand and Fog (film)">
<text>House of Sand and Fog is a 2003 drama film directed by Vadim Perelman, with a screenplay written by Perelman and Shawn Lawrence Otto. It is based on the novel of the same name by Andre Dubus III.

The tragic story concerns the battle between a former drug addict and an immigrant Iranian family over the ownership of a house in Northern California, which ultimately leads to the destruction of five lives. The film was nominated for three Academy Awards: Best Actor (Ben Kingsley), Best Supporting Actress (Shohreh Aghdashloo), and Best Original Score (James Horner).

==Plot==
Abandoned by her husband, recovering drug addict Kathy Nicolo, living alone in a small house near the San Francisco Bay Area, ignores eviction notices erroneously sent to her for nonpayment of business taxes. Assuming the misunderstanding was cleared up, she is surprised when Sheriff&#x27;s Deputy Lester Burdon arrives to forcibly evict her. Telling Kathy that her home is to be auctioned off, Lester feels sympathy for her, helps her move out, and advises her to seek legal assistance to regain her house.

Former Imperial Iranian Army colonel Massoud Behrani, who fled his homeland with his family, now lives in the Bay Area working multiple menial jobs. Living beyond his means, he maintains the façade of a respectable businessman so as not to shame his wife Nadereh, son Esmail, and daughter Soraya. He buys Kathy&#x27;s house for a quarter of its actual value, intending to improve and sell it. Kathy is evicted from the motel she is staying in. With nowhere else to go, she spends the night in her car. Seeing the renovations and how the Behranis have settled in makes her determined to get her house back and she finds an attorney, Connie Walsh, who assures her that because of the county&#x27;s mistake, they will return Massoud&#x27;s money and restore the house to her.

Massoud, having already spent money on improving the house, is unwilling to accept anything less than the higher value of the property, which the county refuses to pay. Connie advises Kathy that her only option is now to sue the county, though it will take months. Kathy tries to convince Massoud to sell back the house; he too advises her to sue the county and promises to sell her the house back if she comes up with the money, but she retaliates by beginning to harass him and his family in front of potential buyers. Desperate for help, Kathy falls easily into an affair with Lester, who abandons his wife and children and fashions himself as Kathy&#x27;s protector. Under a pseudonym, Lester threatens to have Massoud and his family deported if he refuses to sell the house back to the county. Aware that Lester was acting on Kathy&#x27;s behalf, Massoud reports this to Internal Affairs, who severely reprimand Lester, and furiously warns Kathy to leave his family alone. Kathy calls her brother Frank for help, but cannot bring herself to admit that she is homeless.

Despondent, Kathy becomes drunk and attempts suicide in the driveway with Lester&#x27;s sidearm. Massoud finds Kathy drunkenly unable to discharge the gun, and brings her inside. Kathy tries to kill herself again with pills, but Nadereh saves her. As she and her husband carry Kathy to the bedroom, Lester breaks in and sees Kathy unconscious. In a xenophobic rage, Lester locks the Behranis in their own bathroom, refusing to let them out until Massoud agrees to relinquish the house. Massoud offers to sell the house and will give Kathy the money in exchange for her putting the house in his name. Lester takes Massoud to the county office to finalize the transaction.

Outside the office, Lester begins to manhandle Massoud and Esmail seizes Lester&#x27;s gun and aims it at him. Massoud grabs Lester and begins calling for help from nearby police officers, but they misinterpret the situation and shoot Esmail instead of Lester. Massoud is arrested but is released after Lester confesses to his crimes and is detained.

Massoud begs God to save his son but Esmail does not survive. Believing they have nothing left to live for, Massoud kills Nadereh by lacing her tea with pills. He then dons his old military uniform, tapes a plastic dust cover over his head, and asphyxiates himself while clutching his wife&#x27;s hand. Kathy discovers the couple and frantically attempts to resuscitate Massoud but she is too late. As the bodies of Massoud and Nadereh are taken away by paramedics, a policeman asks Kathy if the house is hers. After a long pause, she admits that it is not.

==Cast==
==Production==
Harvey Weinstein wanted Todd Field to direct and offered Vadim Perelman $500,000, a producer credit and a script of his choosing from the Miramax slate instead, which he declined. Julianne Moore was initially attached but after meeting Connelly, Perelman went with her at the eleventh hour.

Shohreh Aghdashloo was a respected actress in Iran before immigrating to the United States. When the film roles offered to her were limited to terrorists and other assorted villains, she turned to a career in the theater. This film marked her return to the screen after nearly two decades.

Jonathan Ahdout, whose previous acting experience was limited to school plays, was cast as Esmail Behrani two days before the start of filming. His original audition had not impressed Perelman, but when he began to have doubts about the actor he had hired, he reviewed the audition tapes and saw something in Ahdout&#x27;s performance he felt he had overlooked. He called him back and had him meet and perform with Aghdashloo. The chemistry between them convinced Perelman the boy was right for the part.

===Music===
An original soundtrack album featuring James Horner&#x27;s film score was released by Varèse Sarabande.

==Reception==

===Critical response===
The film received positive reviews from critics. Based on 182 reviews collected by Rotten Tomatoes, 74% of critics gave &quot;House of Sand and Fog&quot; a positive review (135 &quot;Fresh&quot;; 47 &quot;Rotten&quot;), with an average rating of 7.08/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus states, &quot;Powerful and thought provoking film&quot;. On Metacritic, the film holds a score of 71 out of 100, sampled from 41 critics&#x27; reviews, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

In his review in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, A.O. Scott called the film &quot;an impressively self-assured directing debut&quot; and wrote it &quot;is the nearly flawless execution of a deeply flawed premise. Mr. Perelman inadvertently exposes the inconsistencies in Mr. Dubus&#x27;s novel even as he comes very close to overcoming them...the conflict between Kathy and Behrani arises from a sin so trivial as to be almost comical ... and every stage of its escalation seems determined less by the psychology of the characters than by the forced, schematic logic of the story. You feel the heavy, implacable force of the narrative without quite believing it.&quot; In &quot;Variety,&quot; Todd McCarthy called the film, along with &quot;Mystic River&quot; and &quot;21 Grams&quot;, one of &quot;the first significant group of post-9/11 movies&quot;.

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film four out of four stars and wrote, &quot;Here is a film that seizes us with its first scene and never lets go, and we feel sympathy all the way through for everyone in it ..it stands with integrity and breaks our hearts.&quot; Owen Gleiberman of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; rated the film B−: &quot;[it] has its pretensions, but mostly it&#x27;s a vigorous and bracingly acted melodrama spun off from a situation that&#x27;s pure human-thriller catnip...though I do wish that the movie didn&#x27;t spiral into the most shocking of tragedies.&quot; David Edelstein of &quot;Slate&quot; wrote, &quot;Kingsley, Connelly, Eldard, and Aghdashloo give vivid and courageous performances. But the machinations of tragedy and farce are quite similar, and in a bad tragedy, they can merge.&quot;

Peter Travers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; rated it three out of a possible four stars and added, &quot;Before it runs off course into excess, this brilliantly acted film version of the 1999 novel by Andre Dubus III moves with a stabbing urgency...Vadim Perelman...makes a smashing debut in features...Prepare for an emotional wipeout.&quot; In &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, David Denby wrote Ben Kingsley is &quot;the only entertainment in this noble pool of despair...Vadim Perelman...produces scenes of great intensity, but he doesn&#x27;t capture the colloquial ease and humor of American life.&quot;

On Salon.com, Andrew O&#x27;Hehir wrote it &quot;features an astonishing pair of lead performances and one of this year&#x27;s most impressive directing debuts.&quot; Channel 4 stated &quot;There&#x27;s nothing wrong in funneling operatic tragedy through seemingly mundane domestic battles, but the way events escalate here feels deeply fraudulent...heavy-handed allegory and symbolism wait at every turn...though relentlessly downbeat, this is so overwrought, underdeveloped and ham-fisted that it&#x27;s more unintentionally comic than genuinely tragic.&quot;

&quot;The Washington Post&quot;″s Ann Hornaday commented that the film loses much of the nuance in Dubus&#x27; book and concluded, &quot;What should have been a nuanced exploration of the roots of violence turns out to be a cautionary tale about opening your mail.&quot; Ed Gonzales of &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; contended the film &quot;refuses to examine the racism that makes the story’s real estate fiasco a fiasco to begin with&quot;.

===Box office===
The film began a limited release in the United States on December 19, 2003 and opened at #43, grossing $45,572 in its opening weekend. It eventually grossed $13,040,288 in North America and $3,902,507 in other territories for a worldwide total of $16,942,795. Its budget was $16.5 million.

<text>HMS &quot;Devastation&quot; was the first of two &quot;Devastation&quot;-class mastless turret ships built for the Royal Navy. This was the first class of ocean-going capital ships that did not carry sails, and the first in which the entire main armament was mounted on top of the hull rather than inside it.

==Design and construction==
&quot;Devastation&quot; was built at a time in which steam power was well-established among the world&#x27;s larger naval powers. However, most ships built at this time were equipped not only with a steam engine, but also with masts and sails for auxiliary power. The presence of masts also prohibited the use of gun turrets since the rigging would obstruct their arc of fire. &quot;Devastation&quot;, designed by Sir Edward J. Reed, represented a change from this pattern when she was built without masts and her primary armament, two turrets each with two 12-inch (305 mm) muzzle-loading guns, was placed on the top of the hull, allowing each turret a 280-degree arc of fire.

&quot;Devastation&quot; was the first turret ship built to an Admiralty design. She was long between perpendiculars, with a beam of , a mean draught of , and had a freeboard of only . She was armed with four RML 12 inch 25 ton guns, mounted in pairs in two turrets, protected by armour thick. Her breastworks and hull were protected by of armour, and she was also fitted with a spur bow. The ship had a double bottom, and was divided internally into watertight compartments. She was propelled by two four-bladed screws, in diameter, each powered by two direct-acting trunk engines built by John Penn and Sons of Greenwich, providing a total of , with eight boilers, working at , giving a maximum speed of . &quot;Devastation&quot; could carry 1,350 tons of coal, giving her a range of at 12 knots or at . She also carried 30 tons of water, enough for three weeks, and 19 tons of provisions, six weeks&#x27; supply for her crew of 329.

Following the loss of the masted turret ship , which capsized and sank on 6 September 1870 with the loss of 500 men, almost her entire crew, a special committee was appointed to examine the design of this type of vessel, and particularly the &quot;Devastation&quot;. Although they found no reason for concern in the stability of the ship, as a safety precaution a number of changes were made to the design. The freeboard was increased to , and armour-plated bulkheads, between thick, provided additional protection to the magazines and engines. The 25-ton guns were replaced with RML 12 inch 35 ton guns. This additional weight increased her mean draught to .
Sea trials were made in mid-1873 and generated an unusual amount of public interest; not just for the novelty of her appearance, but as the successor to the &quot;Captain&quot;. In time trials she recorded a speed of , the engines producing . Gunnery trials were made off the Isle of Wight, firing Palliser shells. To judge her behaviour in various sea conditions she was then accompanied by the armoured ships and in a voyage from Plymouth to Castletownbere in southern Ireland, and from there she made two cruises out into the Atlantic. Apart from a tendency for her low forecastle to be swept by the sea, she performed slightly better than her companions in both pitch and roll.
==Service history==
&quot;Devastation&quot; was deployed to serve in the waters of the United Kingdom and the Mediterranean Sea. In 1891, the 12-inch guns were replaced with 10-inch breech-loading guns and she was refitted with new triple-expansion steam engines.

In November 1898 Captain Frederick Inglefield was appointed as her commander. In March 1900 she is reported to have visited Syracuse, Sicily. In 1901 she was guard ship at the port of Gibraltar, until relieved as such by newly commissioned in February 1902. She left the Mediterranean station headquarters at Malta, homebound, on 19 February 1902, and after a last visit to Gibraltar arrived in Plymouth on 2 April. She was paid off at Devonport on 18 April, and proceeded to Portsmouth.
On 21 June 1902 she was recommissioned as a tender to the torpedo school ship HMS &quot;Vernon&quot;. She took part in the fleet review held at Spithead on 16 August 1902 for the coronation of King Edward VII.

Later, she was refitted again and assigned to the First Reserve Fleet based in Scotland. The ship was broken up in 1908.

==Popular culture==
* HMS &quot;Devastation&quot; is the ship depicted on &quot;England&#x27;s Glory&quot; matchboxes.
* Her badge was also issued by publishers for use in Monogram and Crest Albums – a popular collecting hobby of the second half of the 19th century.

<text>Ciego de Ávila () is a city in the central part of Cuba and the capital of Ciego de Ávila Province. The capital city has a population of about 156,322 and the province 430,507.

==Geography==
Ciego de Ávila lies on the Carretera Central highway and on a major railroad. Its port, Júcaro, lies south-southwest on the coast of the Gulf of Ana Maria of the Caribbean Sea, in the adjacent municipality of Venezuela. The city is located about east of Havana and west of the city of Camagüey. It was part of the Camagüey Province until 1976, when Fidel Castro&#x27;s government made Ciego de Ávila the capital of the newly created Ciego de Ávila Province.

By 1945, the municipality was divided into the barrios of Angel Castillo, Ceballos, Guanales, Jagüeyal, Jicotea, José Miguel Gómez, Júcaro, La Ceiba, Majagua, Norte, San Nicolás and Sur. After the new political and administrative division of Cuba in 1976, it was divided into four municipalities (Majagua, Ciego de Ávila, Baragua, and Venezuela).

===Climate===

==History==

The city of Ciego de Ávila was founded by 1840, having at the time 263 inhabitants. In 1877, its municipal government was created and the city became independent of the city of Morón. Ciego de Ávila gained importance when the Spanish army built a fortified military line, known as Trocha de Júcaro a Morón, to impede the pass of insurrectionist forces to the western part of the island during the 1st War of Independence (1868–1878). This &quot;trocha&quot;, which made this region famous, was thought to be strong enough to stop the Cuban forces, but was not able to stop the pass of General Máximo Gómez and several hundred men. Many of the old Spanish colonial buildings in Ciego de Ávila (such as the Teatro Principal) were commissioned under Angela Hernández, viuda de Jiménez, a rich socialite who battled to create a cultural mecca in her hometown.

<doc id="461364" wikidata="Q390097" url="?curid=461364" title="Cold Mountain (film)">
<text>Cold Mountain is a 2003 epic period war drama film written and directed by Anthony Minghella. The film is based on the bestselling 1997 novel by Charles Frazier. It stars Jude Law, Nicole Kidman, and Renée Zellweger with Eileen Atkins, Brendan Gleeson, Kathy Baker, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Natalie Portman, Jack White, Giovanni Ribisi, Donald Sutherland, and Ray Winstone in supporting roles. The film tells the story of a wounded deserter from the Confederate army close to the end of the American Civil War, who journeys home to reunite with the woman he loves. The film was a co-production of companies in Italy, Romania, and the United States.

&quot;Cold Mountain&quot; was released theatrically on December 25, 2003, by Miramax Films. It emerged a critical and commercial success, grossing over $173 million. It received seven nominations at the 76th Academy Awards, including Best Actor (Law), with Zellweger winning Best Supporting Actress.

==Plot==
When North Carolina secedes from the Union on May 20, 1861, the young men of Cold Mountain enlist in the Confederate States Army. Among them is W.P. Inman, a carpenter who has fallen in love with Ada Monroe, the preacher&#x27;s daughter who came from Charleston, South Carolina, to care for her father. Their courtship is interrupted by the war, but they share their first kiss the day Inman leaves for battle. Ada promises to wait for him.

Three years later, Inman fights in the Battle of the Crater and survives. He then comforts a dying acquaintance from Cold Mountain, while fellow soldier Stobrod Thewes plays a tune on his fiddle. Inman is later wounded in a skirmish, and as he lies in a hospital near death, a nurse reads him a letter from Ada, who pleads for Inman to come home to her. 

Inman recovers and deserts. Embarking on a long trek back to Cold Mountain, he encounters corrupt preacher Veasey and stops him from drowning his impregnated slave. Exiled from his parish, Veasey joins Inman on his journey. They meet a young man, Junior, and join him and his family for dinner. Junior betrays the duo to the Confederate Home Guard, who take Inman and Veasey away along with other deserters. Veasey and the group are killed in a skirmish with Union cavalry; Inman is left for dead. An elderly hermit finds Inman and nurses him back to health. Inman eventually meets grieving young widow Sara and her infant child Ethan, and stays the night at her cabin. The next morning, three Union soldiers arrive demanding food; they hold Ethan hostage and try to rape Sara, which forces Inman and Sara to kill them.

Back in Cold Mountain, Ada&#x27;s father has died. With no money and little means to run the family farm in Black Cove, she survives on the kindness of her neighbors, particularly Esco and Sally Swanger, who eventually send for Ruby Thewes, an experienced farmer (and Stobrod&#x27;s daughter), to help. Together they bring Black Cove to working order and become close friends. Ada continues to write letters to Inman, hoping they will reunite and renew their romance. Ada has several tense encounters with Captain Teague, the leader of the local Home Guard who covets Ada and her property. His grandfather once owned much of Cold Mountain. One day, Teague and his men kill Esco. They torture Sally to coax her deserter sons out of hiding and kill them as well. Ada and Ruby rescue Sally, who is traumatized and rendered mute. The women celebrate Christmas with Stobrod, who has come to Cold Mountain with fellow deserters and musicians Pangle and Georgia.

While camping in the woods one night, Stobrod and Pangle are cornered by Teague and the Guard while Georgia secretly watches. Pangle inadvertently reveals they are deserters, and the Guard shoots Pangle and Stobrod. Georgia escapes and informs Ruby and Ada, who find Pangle dead and Stobrod badly wounded. The women and Stobrod take shelter in an abandoned Cherokee camp. Ada hunts for food and is reunited with Inman, who has finally returned to Cold Mountain. They return to the camp and spend the night consummating their love. Heading home, Ada and Ruby are surrounded by Teague and his men, who had captured and tortured Georgia to learn their whereabouts. Inman arrives, and a gunfight occurs, resulting in Teague and most of his posse dying. Inman chases Bosie, Teague&#x27;s lieutenant, and exchange fast draws. Bosie is killed, and Inman is mortally wounded. Ada finds and comforts Inman, who dies in her arms.

Years later, it is revealed that Ada&#x27;s night with Inman produced a daughter, Grace Inman, and that Ruby has married Georgia and borne two children. With Stobrod and Sally, the family celebrates Easter together at Black Cove.

==Cast==
==Production==
In 1997, United Artists bought the rights to &quot;Cold Mountain&quot; for Anthony Minghella to write and direct, with Sydney Pollack as producer. MGM/United Artists and Miramax Films then announced a deal to produce eight films together, sharing the profits. Historical painter Don Troiani was hired and served as historical advisor to the production.

As the script was developed, the scope of the film grew from a period love-story of a $40 million budget into an expensive epic. The budget grew to nearly $120 million, with Minghella having trouble finding American landscapes that could pass for 19th-century towns. Tom Cruise, at the time married to Nicole Kidman, wanted to play Inman, but the studio did not want to meet his $20 million fee demand. To get the budget down, production was moved to Romania. Principal photography started on 10 July 2002, but during filming, in October 2002, MGM pulled out. Executive producer Harvey Weinstein was going to cancel the shoot, but, with Minghella already in pre-production, Weinstein agreed to fund the $80 million project after receiving a $10 million tax break.

===Location===
Cold Mountain, where the film is set, is a real mountain located within the Pisgah National Forest, Haywood County, North Carolina. However, the film was shot mostly in Romania, with numerous scenes shot in Virginia, South Carolina, and North Carolina. The film was one of an increasing number of Hollywood productions made in Eastern Europe as a result of lower costs in the region, and because, in this instance, Transylvania had lower infrastructure, such as power cables and paved roads, and was thus less marked by modern life than the Appalachians.

===Editing===
The film marked a technological and industry turnaround in editing. Walter Murch edited &quot;Cold Mountain&quot; on Apple&#x27;s sub-$1000 Final Cut Pro software &quot;using several off-the-shelf PowerMac G4 computers&quot;. This was a leap for such a big-budgeted film, where expensive Avid systems are usually the standard editing system. His efforts on the film were documented in the 2005 book &quot;Behind the Seen: How Walter Murch Edited Cold Mountain Using Apple&#x27;s Final Cut Pro and What This Means for Cinema&quot;.

==Reception==

=== Box office ===
&quot;Cold Mountain&quot; grossed $95.6 million in the United States and Canada and $77.4 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $173 million. Executive producer Harvey Weinstein said the film would break-even if it grossed $135 million. The film made $14.5 million in its opening weekend, finishing third at the box office. It made $11.7 million in its second weekend and $7.9 million in its third, finishing fourth both times.

=== Critical response ===
&quot;Cold Mountain&quot; opened to positive reviews from critics, with Law and Zellweger&#x27;s performance receiving widespread critical acclaim. According to review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, 70% of 231 critics gave the film a positive review, with an average rating of 6.70/10. The site&#x27;s critics consensus states: &quot;The well-crafted &quot;Cold Mountain&quot; has an epic sweep and captures the horror and brutal hardship of war.&quot; On Metacritic, the film was assigned a weighted average score of 73 out of 100 based on 41 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of B+ on scale of A+ to F.

Movie critic Roger Ebert gave the film three stars out of four, noting, &quot;It evokes a backwater of the Civil War with rare beauty, and lights up with an assortment of colorful supporting characters.&quot; Richard Corliss, film critic for &quot;Time&quot;, gave the film a positive review. He called it &quot;A grand and poignant movie epic about what is lost in war and what&#x27;s worth saving in life. It is also a rare blend of purity and maturity—the year&#x27;s most rapturous love story.&quot; In his movie guide, Leonard Maltin gave the film 3 1/2 stars out of 4, writing &quot;Minghella&#x27;s adaptation of the Charles Frazier best-seller captures both the grimness of battle and the starkness of life on the home front in the South,&quot; and concluded the film was &quot;meticulously crafted&quot; with &quot;first-rate performances all around.&quot;

===Top ten lists===
&quot;Cold Mountain&quot; was listed on many critics&#x27; top ten lists of 2003.

* 1st – Stephen Hunter, &quot;The Washington Post&quot;
* 1st – Megan Lehmann, &quot;New York Post&quot;
* 2nd – Jonathan Foreman, &quot;New York Post&quot;
* 3rd – Ruthie Stein, &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot;
* 5th – Richard Corliss, &quot;TIME Magazine&quot;
* 5th – Peter Travers, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;
* 7th – Lou Lumenick, &quot;New York Post&quot;
* 7th – Jonathan Rosenbaum, &quot;Chicago Reader&quot;
* 8th – Mike Clark, &quot;USA Today&quot;
* 8th – Wesley Morris, &quot;The Boston Globe&quot;
* Top 10 (listed alphabetically) – Kenneth Turan, &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;
=== Historical accuracy ===
Several scholars of historical studies reviewed the film for its representation of North Carolina during the Civil War, especially the state&#x27;s mountainous western region. Their justification is the effect popular media have on national and worldwide perceptions of Appalachian people, particularly southern Appalachians in this case. The opinions vary, but the consensus among them is the historical context of the movie is close to the scholarship.
Scholars praised the film for its conformity to the historical scholarship in other subjects, with one saying &quot;The final product should... provide so unflinching a portrayal of the bleak and unsettling realities of a far less familiar version of the Civil War, but one that would be all too recognizable to thousands of hardscrabble southern men and women who lived through it.&quot;

One scholar said, &quot;Some of the best of the soundtrack was not composed for the movie but garnered from the body of time-tested and proven masterpieces of an earlier rural American culture.&quot; Such selections were not necessarily performed authentically in the film: the two Sacred Harp songs, although generally authentic to the period and region, contained vocal parts not yet written at that time.

The beginning Battle of the Crater is depicted as happening in broad daylight but it began at 4:44 am with the detonation of the mine.

==Soundtrack==

&quot;Cold Mountain: Music from the Motion Picture&quot; shares producer T Bone Burnett with the soundtrack for &quot;O Brother, Where Art Thou?&quot;, a largely old-time and folk album with limited radio play that still enjoyed commercial success, and garnered a Grammy. As a result, comparisons were drawn between the two albums. Burnett brought in musician and scholar Tim Eriksen to teach the performers Sacred Harp singing, which features prominently in the sountrack.

It features songs written by Jack White of The White Stripes (who also appeared in the film in the role of Georgia), Elvis Costello and Sting. Costello and Sting&#x27;s contributions, &quot;The Scarlet Tide&quot; and &quot;You Will Be My Ain True Love&quot;, were both nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Song and featured vocals by bluegrass singer Alison Krauss. Gabriel Yared&#x27;s Oscar-nominated score is represented by four tracks amounting to approximately fifteen minutes of music.

<doc id="461371" wikidata="Q3121507" url="?curid=461371" title="Guy (band)">
<text>Guy is an American hip hop, R&amp;B and soul group founded in 1987 by Teddy Riley, Aaron Hall, and Timmy Gatling. Hall&#x27;s younger brother Damion Hall replaced Gatling after the recording of the group&#x27;s self-titled debut album. The group released their debut album, which went on to sell over a million copies and was certified double platinum. Following their success, the group released their second album &quot;The Future&quot; in 1990, which also charted with successful singles and received platinum as well. Following their nearly decade long split, the group returned with their third album before the 2000s, which charted with their hit single &quot;Dancin&#x27;&quot;.

Guy held the credit as the pioneer of the new jack swing genre with the early interactions of their work, which was developed and mainstreamed by Riley.

==Overview==
===Origins===
==== Kids at Work (1979–1985) ====
Teddy Riley and Timmy Gatling both grew up in the Harlem section of New York City. Both of their family households were musically active and took inspiration from late 70s acts such as the Gap Band, Earth Wind &amp; Fire and the Jacksons. They soon got involved in local live bands for ages around 12 to 20. Riley was in a band called The Climates as a 12-year-old prodigy piano player. 

At the time, music executive Gene Griffin was scouting for young artists and owned a label called Sounds of New York, which had artists such as Indeep (known for the “Last Night A D.J. Saved My Life” hit single). Griffin offered Teddy Riley a contract to form the kid group &quot;Kids at Work&quot;. Sony Music Publishing handled distribution. The band consisted of Teddy Riley playing on keyboard, Timmy Gatling on vocals and bass, and Clurel Henderson on percussion &amp; lead vocals.

In 1984, they released their self-titled debut album. The group eventually left the label after Griffin’s sudden incarceration. Teddy Riley would go on to produce other projects such as “The Show” for Doug E. Fresh.

====Guy (1986–1991)====
After the breakup of Kids at Work, Griffin offered Gatling a new deal to create a band. Gatling approached Aaron Hall, with whom he used to work in Abraham &amp; Straus&#x27; shoe department. Hall sang in choirs at the Bethel Gospel Tabernacle in Jamaica, Queens. Gatling introduced Hall to Teddy Riley, and the three named their new group &quot;Guy&quot;. Gene Griffin became their manager and was credited as producer as he introduced them to Uptown Records founder Andre Harrell, who immediately signed the trio.

===Mainstream success and breakup (1988–1991)===
Under the guidance of manager Gene Griffin, the trio signed to Andre Harrell&#x27;s Uptown Records and released &quot;Guy&quot; in June 1988. Gatling was forced out of the group by Gene Griffin because he refused to sign the management contract, which gave Gene Griffin full control of their publishing and income. His face was kept on the album because he was officially part of the group and MCA Records needed his permission to release the album. Gatling released his solo debut, &quot;Help&quot;, in 1989 on Tommy Boy/Warner Bros. Records and wrote and produced songs such as &quot;Promises, Promises&quot; for Christopher Williams and &quot;When Will I See You Smile Again?&quot; for Bell Biv DeVoe.

Five singles were released from &quot;Guy&quot;, only one of which, &quot;I Like,&quot; charted on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. However, four of the album&#x27;s singles became significant &quot;Billboard&quot; R&amp;B chart hits: &quot;Groove Me&quot; (#4), &quot;Teddy&#x27;s Jam&quot; (#5), &quot;I Like&quot; (#2), and &quot;Spend the Night&quot; (#15) helped propel the album to double platinum status. In addition, &quot;&#x27;Round and &#x27;Round (Merry Go &#x27;Round of Love)&quot; reached #24 on the R&amp;B chart, and &quot;Piece of My Love&quot; also received some airplay on R&amp;B stations. &quot;Guy&quot; reached #1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; R&amp;B album chart and, more impressively, climbed to #27 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 album chart without a major pop hit.

The band contributed the song &quot;My Fantasy&quot; to the soundtrack of Spike Lee&#x27;s film &quot;Do the Right Thing&quot; in 1989. Riley and Gene Griffin also worked with Boy George, producing his R&amp;B hit &quot;Don&#x27;t Take My Mind on a Trip.&quot; However, that same year Guy split acrimoniously from Griffin. Riley continued to produce and remix for other artists and firmly established himself as the figurehead and driving force behind new jack swing.

In November 1990 Guy released its second album, &quot;The Future&quot;. Although still not scoring Top 40 pop hits, the album&#x27;s five singles became R&amp;B hits: &quot;Wanna Get Wit U&quot; (#4); &quot;Let&#x27;s Chill&quot; (#3); &quot;Do Me Right,&quot; featuring Heavy D) (#2); &quot;D-O-G Me Out&quot; (#8); and &quot;Let&#x27;s Stay Together&quot; (#16) took the album to platinum status. In 1991 Guy made an appearance in Mario Van Peebles&#x27;s film &quot;New Jack City&quot;, performing the song of the same name.

After touring behind &quot;The Future&quot;, the group split up, later citing &quot;the tragedy of our ex-manager,&quot; Gene Griffin, as the reason for Guy&#x27;s disbandment. One of their final recordings during this period was a cover of Wilson Pickett&#x27;s &quot;Land of a Thousand Dances&quot; for the 1992 animated film &quot;&quot;. Riley then focused on producing other artists, such as Heavy D and Michael Jackson, and formed a new group, Blackstreet. The two Hall brothers each pursued solo careers during the &#x27;90s.

===Reunions===
Guy has reformed periodically since their initial break-up, the first of which occurred in 1995, with the release of the song &quot;Tell Me What You Like&quot;, but an album did not follow at that time.

In 1999, Riley and the Hall brothers reunited to release their first album in nine years titled &quot;Guy III&quot;. The album featured the modest hit &quot;Dancin&#x27;&quot; produced by Eddie F, Darren Lighty and G-Wise, which peaked at No. 19 on the US Hot 100 chart, becoming surprisingly their biggest hit on the pop charts. However, the album was poorly promoted and as quickly as it was released it dropped from the public consciousness. The group disbanded again soon after, but reformed periodically from 2005 onwards, and despite rumours of another album, they have yet to release another.

In 2006 they were part of the New Jack Reunion Tour line up, along with BLACKstreet, Tony! Toni! Toné!, After 7, New Edition, and SWV.

Riley and the Hall brothers reunited at the 2009 BET Awards, performing &quot;I Like&quot; as part of a new jack swing medley.

Speaking in March 2010 to noted UK R&amp;B writer Pete Lewis – Deputy Editor of the award-winning Blues &amp; Soul – Riley confirmed he is no longer involved with Guy. He went on to perform with the group again in October 2010. However, the reunion was short-lived following claims by other band members that Riley had not properly distributed royalties he had collected on behalf of Guy.

On January 16, 2011, Aaron and Damion performed without Teddy at BET Honors in Washington DC. &quot;Guy brought the audience to its feet with new-jack-swing-era hits Let&#x27;s Chill and Groove Me.&quot; – The Washington Post. The performance at BET Honors became a trending topic on Twitter when it aired on February 21, 2011. The duo appeared again on February 17, 2011, on the TV One Black History Month special &quot;Way Black When.&quot; As of 2013, Riley has announced he&#x27;s returned to Guy and will be working with Guy as well as Blackstreet. Riley&#x27;s return in 2013 was short and he left once again according to Aaron Hall. In August 2014, Riley announced via his official Instagram that he has reunited with the Hall brothers with a new website and tour coming soon.

<doc id="461382" wikidata="Q5686131" url="?curid=461382" title="Sanjay Kumar (business executive)">
<text>Sanjay Kumar (born 1962) is the former chairman and CEO of Computer Associates International (now CA Technologies), from 2000 until April 2004. 

He was sentenced to 12 years in prison in connection with the 35 day month accounting scandal and released in 2017.

==Early childhood==
He immigrated with his family to the United States in 1976 to escape civil unrest in his native Sri Lanka. The family originally settled in South Carolina. He attended Furman University from 1980 to 1983, and left without completing a degree.

==Career==
Kumar became an employee of Computer Associates in 1987 when it acquired UCCEL Corp. in an $800 million buyout. Kumar was, at the time, UCCEL&#x27;s director of software development and had been employed by UCCEL only for a few months.

Kumar was promoted to vice president of planning the following year, relocating to Computer Associates&#x27; Long Island headquarters. Over the years, he held various leadership roles at the firm. In 1989, he became senior vice president of planning and in 1993 moved up to Executive Vice President of Operations. Kumar was named president and chief operating officer in 1994 at age 31. Kumar succeeded the retiring Tony Wang, the older brother of Chief Executive Officer Charles Wang, as Tony was pressured to leave to make way.

In 2000, Kumar replaced his mentor Charles Wang as chief executive officer of the firm and in 2002 became chairman of Computer Associates&#x27; board of directors. Kumar is widely credited with moving CA to be more customer-friendly.

==Resignation==
Kumar resigned as chairman and chief executive in April 2004, following an investigation into securities fraud and obstruction of justice at Computer Associates. He remained with the firm in the new position of chief software architect for about six weeks before leaving the firm altogether on June 4, 2004. A federal grand jury in Brooklyn indicted him on fraud charges on September 22, 2004. Kumar pleaded guilty to obstruction of justice and securities fraud charges on April 24, 2006. On November 2, 2006, it was reported that he was sentenced to 12 years in prison and fined $8 million for his role in a massive accounting fraud at Computer Associates.

==Sentencing ==
At the hearing in federal court in Brooklyn, Judge Leo Glasser sentenced Kumar, 44 years old, to 144 months in prison, to be followed by three years supervised release. The judge deferred payment of the fine until after restitution is determined at a hearing scheduled for February 2, 2007. Kumar was scheduled to report to prison on February 27, but that was delayed by two months due to delays in the restitution hearing. The start of the prison sentence was then delayed again, to November. However, in early June U.S. District Judge I. Leo Glasser ordered Kumar to surrender by August 14, 2007, to the federal correctional center in Fairton, New Jersey, to begin his 12-year sentence, and on that date he did so. Upon starting his prison sentence, Kumar alleged that Charles Wang, cofounder of Computer Associates, &quot;personally directed&quot; improper accounting there going back to 1987. Kumar said that board members Lewis Ranieri and Alfonse D&#x27;Amato, the former New York Republican senator, &quot;had knowledge of&quot; the accounting misdeeds for which he went to prison — going back &quot;at least&quot; to 2003.

&quot;I stand before your honor today to take full responsibility for my actions,&quot; Kumar said prior to sentencing. &quot;I know that I was wrong and there&#x27;s no excuse for my conduct.&quot;

Kumar was released from federal prison on January 25, 2017.

==Restitution==
On April 13, 2007, Judge Glasser approved an agreement for Kumar to pay $798.6 million in restitution, at least $52 million by December 31, 2008. After he served his 12-year prison term, the government may take 20% of his future gross annual pay for restitution.

==Other investments==
At one time, Kumar was a part owner, with Wang, in the New York Islanders hockey team and New York Dragons arena football team, but, according to local news reports, Wang purchased Kumar&#x27;s share in 2006.

<text>The Okinawa diet describes the traditional dietary practices of indigenous people of the Ryukyu Islands (belonging to Japan), which were claimed to have contributed to their relative longevity over a period of study in the 20th century.

==Relative longevity==
As assessed over 1949 to 1998, people from the Ryukyu Islands (of which Okinawa is the largest) had a life expectancy among the highest in the world (83.8 years vs. 78.9 years in the United States), although the male life expectancy rank among Japanese prefectures plummeted in the 21st century.

Okinawa had the longest life expectancy in all prefectures of Japan for almost 30 years prior to 2000. The relative life expectancy of Okinawans has since declined, due to many factors including Westernization. In 2000, Okinawa dropped in its ranking for longevity advantage for men to 26th out of 47 within the prefectures of Japan. In 2015, Japan had the highest life expectancy of any country: 90 years for women and for men, 84 years.

Although there are myriad factors that could account for differences in life expectancy, calorie restriction and regular physical activity could be factors. People have promoted the &quot;Okinawa diet&quot;, despite the fact that the diet alone is unlikely to solely explain high life expectancy among seniors on Okinawa in the 20th century.

== Indigenous islanders&#x27; diet ==

The traditional diet of the islanders contained sweet potato, green-leafy or root vegetables, and soy foods, such as miso soup, tofu or other soy preparations, occasionally served with small amounts of fish, noodles, or lean meats, all cooked with herbs, spices, and oil. Although the traditional Japanese diet usually includes large quantities of rice, the traditional Okinawa diet consisted of smaller quantities of rice; instead the staple was sweet potato. The Okinawa diet had only 30% of the sugar and 15% of the grains of the average Japanese dietary intake.

Okinawan cuisine consists of smaller meal portions of green and yellow vegetables, soy and other legumes, relatively small amounts of rice compared to mainland Japan, as well as occasional fish and pork. The center of the Okinawan cuisine is the sweet potato. Not only is the sweet potato tuber used but so are the leaves from the plant. The leaves are used often in miso soup. In Okinawa, the bitter melon is called goya and is served in the national dish, gōyā chanpurū.

===Food proportions===
The dietary intake of Okinawans compared to other Japanese circa 1950 shows that Okinawans consumed: fewer total calories (1785 vs. 2068), less polyunsaturated fat (4.8% of calories vs. 8%), less rice (154g vs. 328g), significantly less wheat, barley and other grains (38g vs. 153g), less sugars (3g vs. 8g), more legumes (71g vs. 55g), significantly less fish (15g vs. 62g), significantly less meat and poultry (3g vs. 11g), less eggs (1g vs. 7g), less dairy (&lt;1g vs. 8g), much more sweet potatoes (849g vs. 66g), less other potatoes (2g vs. 47g), less fruit (&lt;1g vs. 44g), and no pickled vegetables (0g vs. 42g). As proportions of total caloric intake, foods in the traditional Okinawa diet included sweet potato (69%), rice (12%), other grains (7%), legumes including soy (6%), green and yellow vegetables (3%), refined oils (2%), fish (1%) and seaweed, meat (mostly pork), refined sugars, potato, egg, nuts and seeds, dairy and fruit (all &lt;1%). Specifically, the Okinawans circa 1950 ate sweet potatoes for 849 grams of the total 1262 grams of food that they consumed, which constituted 69% of their total daily calories.

The traditional Okinawan diet as described above was widely practiced on the islands until about the 1960s. Since then, dietary practices shifted towards Western and mainland Japanese patterns, with fat intake rising from about 6% to 27% of total caloric intake and the sweet potato being supplanted with rice and bread.

Another low-calorie staple in Okinawa was seaweed, particularly, konbu or kombu. This plant, like much of the greenery from the island, is rich in protein, amino acids and minerals such as iodine. Another seaweed commonly eaten was wakame, which is rich in minerals like iodine, magnesium and calcium. Seaweed and tofu in one form or other were eaten on a daily basis.

Okinawans ate three grams total of meat – including pork and poultry – per day, substantially less than the 11-gram average of Japanese as a whole in 1950. The pig&#x27;s feet, ears, and stomach were considered as everyday foodstuffs. In 1979 after many years of Westernization, the quantity of pork consumption per person a year in Okinawa was , exceeding by about 50% that of the Japanese national average.

=== Okinawan health ===
In addition to their relative longevity identified in the mid-20th century, islanders were noted for their low mortality from cardiovascular disease and certain types of cancers. One study compared age-adjusted mortality of Okinawans versus Americans and found that, during 1995, an average Okinawan was 8 times less likely to die from coronary artery disease, 7 times less likely to die from prostate cancer, 6.5 times less likely to die from breast cancer, and 2.5 times less likely to die from colon cancer than an average American of the same age, though more than 10% of the Okinawans suffered from cheilosis from a low consumption of vitamin B2. Delayed menstruation and deficient lactation were also relatively frequent at 9% and almost 18% due to low caloric intake and/or low body fat levels in women. In the 21st century, the shifting dietary trend coincided with a decrease in longevity, where Okinawans actually developed a lower life expectancy than the Japanese average.

Overall, the traditional Okinawa diet led to little weight gain with age, low body mass index throughout life, and low risk from age-related disease. No ingredients or foods of any kind have been scientifically shown to possess antiaging properties.

== Research ==
In the 1972 Japan National Nutrition Survey, it was determined that Okinawan adults consumed 83% of what Japanese adults did and that Okinawan children consumed 62% of what Japanese children consumed. Since the early 2000s, the difference in life expectancy between Okinawan and mainland Japanese decreased, possibly due to Westernization and erosion of the traditional diet. The spread of primarily American fast-food chains was linked with an increase in cardiovascular diseases, much like the ones noted in Japanese migrants to the United States.

== Culture and customs ==
Okinawa and Japan have food-centered cultures. Festivities often include food or are food-based. Moreover, the food tends to be seasonal, fresh and raw. Portion sizes are small and meals are brought out in stages that starts with appetizers, many main courses including sashimi (raw fish) and suimono (soup), sweets and tea. The food culture and presentation is preserved, passing low-calorie food from generation to generation.

<text>The New Gods are a fictional extraterrestrial race appearing in the eponymous comic book series published by DC Comics, as well as selected other DC titles. Created and designed by Jack Kirby, they first appeared in February 1971 in &quot;New Gods&quot; #1.

==Publication history==
===Volume 1 (1971)===

The New Gods are natives of the twin planets of New Genesis and Apokolips. New Genesis is an idyllic planet filled with unspoiled forests, mountains, and rivers and ruled by the benevolent Highfather, while Apokolips is a nightmarish, polluted dystopia filled with machinery and fire pits, ruled by the tyrannical Darkseid. The two planets were once part of the same world, a planet called &quot;Urgrund&quot; (German for &quot;primeval ground&quot;), but it was split apart millennia ago after the death of the Old Gods during Ragnarök.
The characters associated with the New Gods are often collectively referred to as &quot;Jack Kirby&#x27;s Fourth World&quot;. Unhappy with Marvel Comics at the time, as he had created or co-created a plethora of characters without having copyright or creative custody of them, he turned to rival publisher DC Comics, with his sketches and designs for a new group of heroes and villains. As author Marc Flores, who writes under the pen name Ronin Ro, described:

Kirby began the &quot;Fourth World&quot; in &quot;Superman&#x27;s Pal Jimmy Olsen&quot; #133 (October 1970). The New Gods first appeared in &quot;New Gods&quot; #1 (February–March 1971) and &quot;Forever People&quot; #1 (February–March 1971). Another &quot;Fourth World&quot; title &quot;Mister Miracle&quot; was launched in April 1971. Various New Gods, notably Darkseid, went on to interact with other denizens of the DC Universe.

&quot;New Gods&quot; #1 marks the first appearance of Orion, Highfather, and Metron, among others. The opening sequence alludes to the presence of the &quot;Old Gods&quot; and the &quot;New Gods&quot; (e.g., &quot;There came a time when the Old Gods died...&quot;). Simultaneously published during this time were the &quot;Forever People&quot; and &quot;Mister Miracle&quot; series, also written and drawn by Kirby.

Kirby fans consider the three-issue arc in &quot;New Gods&quot; #6-8 to be the peak of Kirby&#x27;s artistic work. Jason Sacks and Keith Dallas say that issue #6, &quot;The Glory Boat&quot;, &quot;juxtaposes several of [Kirby&#x27;s] favorite themes: the conflict between generations, the ways that pacifism is forced to confront violence, and, of course, the continuing battle between Apokolips and New Genesis, all drawn in some of the most spectacular art of his career.&quot; Charles Hatfield says that the story&#x27;s conclusion: &quot;...is a pure example of Kirby&#x27;s technological sublime, at once redemptive and seductive, healing and cataclysmic... This rhapsodic episode suggests a glorying in, but also a fearful ambivalence about, the blurring of the living and the technological.&quot;

Issue #7, &quot;The Pact&quot;, sought to explain the backstory of the New Gods. Sacks and Keith said: &quot;While the story can also be read as a commentary and critique of the Vietnam War (as it&#x27;s all about the ambiguity and moral costs of war), &#x27;The Pact&#x27; is a creation myth in comics form, providing readers deeper context about both the struggle between Apokolips and New Genesis and the great sacrifices that have to be made to create peace in the face of overwhelming destruction.&quot;

Despite the creative strength of Kirby&#x27;s material, the book&#x27;s sales slipped steadily after a strong start. &quot;New Gods&quot; was cancelled with issue #11 (Oct-Nov 1972), and the last issue of &quot;Forever People&quot; was also #11 (August–September 1972). The Apokolips/New Genesis war was left unresolved.

Kirby&#x27;s production assistant at the time, Mark Evanier, explained: 

Despite the sales failure of the book, Kirby&#x27;s work has remained an inspiration for future comics creators. Comics historian Les Daniels observed in 1995: &quot;Kirby&#x27;s mix of slang and myth, science fiction and the Bible, made for a heady brew, but the scope of his vision has endured.&quot;

In 2007, comics writer Grant Morrison commented: &quot;Kirby&#x27;s dramas were staged across Jungian vistas of raw symbol and storm ... The Fourth World saga crackles with the voltage of Jack Kirby&#x27;s boundless imagination let loose onto paper.&quot;

====Return of the New Gods (1977)====
In 1976, the New Gods were featured in the last issue of &quot;1st Issue Special&quot;, written by Gerry Conway and Dennis O&#x27;Neil and pencilled by Mike Vosburg. The issue featured a new, more mainstream superhero costume for Orion, which he would wear for the next few years, but failed to lead to a relaunch. That same year, Jenette Kahn became DC&#x27;s new publisher and decided to revive the &quot;Fourth World&quot; lineup in 1977. &quot;The New Gods&quot; series relaunched in July 1977, and with &quot;1st Issue Special&quot; still a relatively recent publication, it picked up where the storyline of that issue left off. Although the title remained &quot;The New Gods&quot; in the indicia and retained its original numbering, launching with #12, the covers used the title &quot;The Return of the New Gods&quot;. Conway wrote the series and Don Newton provided the pencils.

The series introduced the character Jezebelle. It was cancelled with issue #19 (July–August 1978) prior to the &quot;DC Implosion&quot;, where a variety of market-related factors caused DC to cancel almost all of the titles launched the previous year. The final chapters of the series were published as backup features in the &quot;Adventure Comics&quot; #459–460 (1978) featured a climactic battle between Darkseid&#x27;s forces and the New Gods, culminating in Darkseid&#x27;s defeat and apparent &quot;death.&quot; Conway later said that he felt the finale he provided for the New Gods saga was inadequate, though he greatly enjoyed working with Newton on the series.

The New Gods met the Flash in &quot;Super-Team Family&quot; #15 (March–April 1978).

Darkseid&#x27;s &quot;death&quot; would quickly be overturned in the New Gods&#x27; next appearance in &quot;Justice League of America&quot; #183–185. The three-part storyline would tell of Darkseid&#x27;s return to Apokolips and his scheme to destroy Earth-Two and teleport Apokolips into its place, so that he could conquer a new universe devoid of the New Gods. The plan would be foiled by the combined power of the New Gods, the Justice League, and the Justice Society.

===Volume 2 (1984)===

Essentially a reprint series, this volume packaged two issues apiece per single issue of the original 1971 series. The mini-series&#x27; final issue was originally intended to include a reprint of &quot;New Gods&quot; #11 and a new 24-page story which would conclude the series and end with both Darkseid and Orion dead. DC editors prevented Kirby from using his original intended ending. Kirby instead turned in a one-off story called &quot;On the Road to Armagetto&quot; which was also rejected, due to the fact that it did not contain a definitive ending to the series. A 48-page new story called &quot;Even Gods Must Die&quot; was published in the sixth issue of the reprint series instead, which in turn served as a prologue for the upcoming &quot;The Hunger Dogs&quot; graphic novel, which DC editors greenlighted to conclude the series.

====&quot;The Hunger Dogs&quot;====
Published as &quot;DC Graphic Novel&quot; #4, &quot;The Hunger Dogs&quot; was intended by Kirby and DC to serve as the end to the entire Fourth World saga. The project was mired in controversy over Kirby&#x27;s insistence that the series should end with the deaths of the New Gods, which clashed with DC&#x27;s demands that the New Gods could not be killed off.

As a result, production of the graphic novel suffered many delays and revisions. Pages and storyline elements from the never published &quot;On the Road to Armagetto&quot; were revised and incorporated into the graphic novel, while DC ordered the entire plot restructured, resulting in many pages of the story being rearranged out of Kirby&#x27;s intended reading order.

In the end, &quot;The Hunger Dogs&quot; saw the tormented, slave population of Apokolips rise up against Darkseid in a massive slave revolt, forcing Darkseid to flee his homeworld. This ending would not last, as Darkseid would reclaim Apokolips off-panel prior to the events of the 1986 &quot;Legends&quot; crossover.

===Volume 3 (1989–91)===
Following the &quot;Cosmic Odyssey&quot; limited series by Jim Starlin and Mike Mignola, a new &quot;New Gods&quot; series was launched. Written by longtime Kirby assistant Mark Evanier, with co-author and penciler Paris Cullins, this would be the most lengthy &quot;New Gods&quot; run yet. Coming in at 28 issues, this volume was published from February 1989 to August 1991. This series is sometimes considered volume 2, as the aforementioned volume 2 was essentially a reprinting of volume 1.

===Volume 4 (1995–97)===
Originally written by Tom Peyer and Rachel Pollack, and pencilled by Luke Ross, volume 4 of &quot;New Gods&quot; ran from October 1995 until February 1997. It was taken over by John Byrne for issues #12–15 at the end of the series; this title would be renamed as &quot;Jack Kirby&#x27;s Fourth World&quot;, also by Byrne, with numbering reset to issue #1, and covers provided by Walt Simonson. Walt Simonson&#x27;s &quot;Orion&quot; series, which continued to host the backup feature &quot;Tales of the New Gods&quot;, began in Byrne&#x27;s &quot;Jack Kirby&#x27;s Fourth World&quot; and served as an extension of it. Simonson wished to simply title his series &quot;New Gods&quot;, but DC felt the name had been used too much recently.

John Byrne&#x27;s one-shot issue &quot;Darkseid vs. Galactus: The Hunger&quot; also appeared in October 1995.

===2007–present===
====&quot;Death of the New Gods&quot; and &quot;Final Crisis&quot;====

Taking place in both the yearlong series &quot;Countdown to Final Crisis&quot; (2007–2008) and its spin-off, &quot;Death of the New Gods&quot;, written by Jim Starlin, was a story-arc involving the mysterious deaths of the New Gods across the universe in preparation for the coming storylines in Grant Morrison&#x27;s &quot;Final Crisis&quot;, published later in 2008. As elaborated in &quot;Death of the New Gods&quot;, the mysterious Godkiller turned out to be an agent of the sentient Source itself, which sought to destroy the imperfect Fourth World—compromised by the disruption in its creation by the Old Gods—in favor of a more perfect &quot;Fifth World&quot; by reuniting the Source with the Anti-Life Equation. The Source&#x27;s initial attempts to recreate the Fifth World had been hampered by the &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; which unified the Multiverse and forged an impenetrable Source Wall around the Anti-Life Equation. The Source&#x27;s agent is revealed to be the New God Infinity-Man. Darkseid acquires the powers of the Anti-Life Equation and capitalizes on the deaths of the New Gods by using the human Jimmy Olsen as a &quot;soul-catcher&quot; for the Gods, from which he can claim all their powers and recreate the universe in his own image, but he is killed when the Source is able to send Darkseid&#x27;s resurrected son, Orion, to rip out his heart. Orion leaves the scene of the fray to die of his own wounds; and, seemingly with success, the Source entity manages to reunite with the Anti-Life entity and merge Apokolips with New Genesis to create the Fifth World, with the New Gods of the Fourth World all deceased.

In &quot;DC Universe&quot; #0, a bridge between the &quot;Countdown&quot; and &quot;Final Crisis&quot; limited series, Darkseid is resurrected on Earth. In &quot;Final Crisis&quot;, Darkseid and his minions now exist on Earth in the guises of organized criminals, with Darkseid taking the name &quot;Boss Dark Side&quot;. Other New Gods, such as Metron and the Black Racer, also appear reborn in newer, more elaborate Fifth World incarnations. Orion is discovered dead by detective Dan Turpin, prompting the Guardians of the Universe to launch an investigation. Batman surmises that Orion was in fact killed not of injuries from battling Darkseid, but by a sort of bullet sent backwards in time. Darkseid spreads the Anti-Life Equation among the human population, creating monstrous slaves out of its victims as he ushers in the &quot;Final Crisis of Mankind&quot;. Shilo Norman begins recruiting an army, warning of a war in heaven having occurred where evil won. Darkseid similarly claims to have ultimately come out of this war in heaven the victor. The villain Libra reappears on Earth after a long absence, making promises to the villains of Earth in the name of the deity he worships.

Grant Morrison addressed what he described as &quot;the disconnects that online commentators, sadly, seem to find more fascinating than the stories themselves&quot;, by explaining that he provided a rough draft of the first issue, and an outline of the plot, before the writing began on &quot;Countdown&quot; and &quot;Death of the New Gods&quot;. He outlined his thinking on the issues of continuity between the stories by stating that he &quot;started writing &quot;Final Crisis&quot; #1 in early 2006, around the same time as the &quot;52&quot; series was starting to come out, so &quot;Final Crisis&quot; was more a continuation of plot threads from &quot;Seven Soldiers&quot; and &quot;52&quot; than anything else.&quot;

As the events of &quot;Final Crisis&quot; unfold, it is revealed that the evil gods of Apokolips have been hiding in human bodies, and some have their bodies &quot;rebuilt&quot; for them in the Evil Factory, formerly the Command-D bunkers in Blüdhaven. Darkseid inhabits the body of Dan Turpin, after Turpin finally succumbs to the evil god. Kalibak inhabits a new body, that of a humanoid tiger, leading a team of similar creatures in battle. Mokkari and Simyan appear, looking more or less identical to their previous forms, with no explanation given to where their bodies came from. Granny Goodness takes up residence in the Alpha Lantern Kraken, using her to attack the Guardians of the Universe, while DeSaad inhabits the body of Mary Marvel. The Female Furies themselves are not shown to still exist, but they are recreated using Anti-Life controlled heroes and villains in the forms of Wonder Woman, Batwoman, Catwoman, and Giganta.

At the conclusion of the series, the essence of Darkseid is destroyed; the New Gods, are resurrected and reborn; and Nix Uotan implies that they will guide the recently destroyed Earth-51, restoring it to prosperity and peace. Nix also indicates that the Super Young Team are the new Forever People of the Fifth World.

====Post-&quot;Final Crisis&quot;====

In an interview with Newsarama, DC Executive Editor Dan DiDio spoke of the future of the New Gods in the DC Universe, saying, &quot;The other thing we’ll give a rest to as well is the concept of the New Gods and the ideas surrounding them. There&#x27;s a very clear conclusion to the New Gods’ storyline in &quot;Final Crisis&quot; #7. The good part about it is that readers will see that ending, and we won&#x27;t have to return to it right away. Like the Multiverse, the New Gods will be out there and available to us, and we can use them when we see fit, and feel the time is right. Just because we introduced concepts doesn&#x27;t mean that we have to constantly use them.&quot;

====&quot;The New 52&quot;====
In September 2011, &quot;The New 52&quot; rebooted DC&#x27;s continuity. In this new timeline, Darkseid first appears in &quot;Justice League&quot; #4. DeSaad and Steppenwolf also briefly appear in this story arc, experimenting on Superman and referring to &quot;the search for Darkseid&#x27;s daughter&quot;, explaining Darkseid&#x27;s actions throughout infinite and his assault and assimilation of various worlds throughout the multiverse. In subsequent issues it is revealed that Cyborg&#x27;s teleportation powers are linked to the Boom Tubes, thanks to upgrades performed by his father utilizing the Mother Box found by the team in their initial adventure, and that every 1,000 times he uses this technology, a glitch in it transports him and his Justice League comrades to Apokolips.

In the pages of &quot;Earth 2&quot; #1, it is revealed that Darkseid&#x27;s search has also resulted in his traversing the array of worlds invading this parallel Earth. Unlike his encounters in &quot;Justice League&quot;, this one is far more successful, resulting in the death of that Earth&#x27;s Superman, Batman and Wonder Woman; in the midst of this war, Power Girl and Huntress somehow traverse into the realm of Prime-Earth.

It is teased that the fall of the Olympian Gods will lead to the creation of New Gods, but not stated if they mean the race of New Gods populating the Fourth World or simply newer younger gods. A figure, with Orion&#x27;s helmet, appears in shadow then disappears into a Boom Tube. Orion fights against, then assists Wonder Woman in her struggle with the gods of Olympus and the monstrous First Born of Zeus, eventually leading her and the Last Born of Olympus to New Genesis and its leader: Highfather. While Highfather appears much younger than his pre-&quot;Flashpoint&quot; incarnation, New Genesis appears much the same, consisting of a futuristic floating city above a mostly rural world covered in forests.

In the &quot;Darkseid&quot; special issue, it is revealed that he and Highfather are some of the only survivors of a previous larger world, where they were brothers and peasants. Their world was also inhabited by colossal beings known as Old Gods, who spent much of their time brawling with each other, feeding off the worship of the &#x27;mudgrubbers&#x27;, whose lives were often lost in the battles. One day the man formerly known as Uxas, having tired of his idol&#x27;s destructiveness, decided to spark a war between them which would in turn devastate their world fatally wounding his sister, Izaya&#x27;s first wife, after which he opted to kill all the wounded Old Gods, steal their powers and bring about a new order. One by one, the Old Gods were destroyed by Darkseid, who became more horrific in turn as he leeched their essence from them. As Darkseid&#x27;s schemes started to tear the planet apart, Highfather ran with his wounded Avia in hand towards one of the last and greatest of the Old Gods, acknowledging his time had come and passed he chose to pass on the last of his power to reward Izaya&#x27;s beloved&#x27;s devotion to them. Empowered in a blinding flare of light, Highfather arose as a New God to battle Darkseid. The brothers, now equal, tore the world apart during their battle, leaving them to rebuild on the remains, which became Apokolips and New Genesis.

It was his search for what was believed to be his daughter Kaiyo that Darkseid came to traverse and enslave various worlds and universes throughout the 52 realities spanning existence, leading up to his first invasion of Earth 2 as well as the incursion of countless other Earths along the DCnU, up until the core world of Prime Earth where he battled and lost against the Justice League when they first formed to battle his invasion.

After countless eons of infighting proceeding after the fall of the Old World, Darkseid and Highfather would eventually be forced into conflict against their demented father and King of the Old Gods, Yuga Khan. Livid at the fact his sons ended up killing and usurping the powers of all the Old Gods of Urgrund save himself, he utilized the power of the Anti-Life Equation to reanimate his fallen subjects, while using his own powers to suppress his sons&#x27; New God Abilities, all to prevent the rise of the New Gods standing before him. When Zonuz was prepping to deliver the killing blow, Uxas crept up from behind and ended him, reducing his resurrected army back to the dust they were recreated from and sending the Old God back to the Source.

For a time, both brothers would raise their dead world back from the devastation wreaked by their previous conflicts, dubbing it Genesis with Izaya eventually remarrying, up until for undisclosed reasons Darkseid killed Highfather&#x27;s new wife away from prying eyes, save those of his sibling&#x27;s. Another war would commence pitting the former&#x27;s faction against the self-titled God of Evil, which devastated the world they made together. With the losses tallied on both sides, a ceasefire was eventually called with Darkseid eventually slinking back into the darkness, while Highfather wept over the loss of their new home. Over time, a peace treaty would be forged in which Izaya would lose the compassionate part of himself to the Source to make him go through with it. Exchanging their sons like in the previous continuity would not stop Darkseid from waging wars of conquest across reality however, so Highfather brokered another treaty where Darkseid would only attack the Earth 2 dimension while leaving the other infinite Earths untouched.

Over time, the core universe where Apokolips first suffered defeat from would have more interactions with the New Gods of both New Genesis; created by the now-militant Highfather, as well as those of Apokolips; domain of the malevolent Darkseid and his elite followers.

==Setting==
===Apokolips===
===New Genesis===

New Genesis is the home of the New Gods, who live in the floating city of Supertown. The surface is inhabited by the &quot;Bugs&quot; and the Primitives, with the former being considered a lesser class.

New Genesis and Apokolips exist in a different plane of existence located near the Source, and can only be accessed via Boom Tube portals.
New Genesis and Apokolips were created after the destruction of the Old Gods&#x27; home planet of Urgrund and respectively seeded with good and evil essences by Balduur and an unnamed sorceress. Through Darkseid&#x27;s manipulation, the two planets enter a devastating war before Highfather enacts a temporary truce.

The conflict between the two planets symbolizes the struggle of good and evil on a grand mythic scale. However, despite representing good, New Genesis and its inhabitants are not entirely perfect. Biographer Charles Hatfield writes, &quot;The saga turns out to be not so simple, for Kirby — and this is revealing – blurs the seeming idealized perfection of New Genesis, adding complexity to his gods.&quot; Similarly, John Morrow writes, &quot;Kirby knew that his New Genesis was no heaven. Rather, it was more like the free West during the Cold War, which was threatened by forces from within as well as without.&quot;

Locations on New Genesis include:

* Asylum of the Gods - An insane asylum where New Gods who have gone mad are incarcerated.
* Bug Mound - The home of the Bugs of New Genesis.
* Lonar&#x27;s Range - An area of wilderness where the Primitives live.
* Singularity Stockade - A multiversal prison.
* Supertown - A floating city that is the capital of New Genesis and the home of the New Gods.

====Later continuity events====
In &quot;Genesis&quot;, Highfather is killed and succeeded by Takion.

In &quot;Seven Soldiers&quot;, New Genesis and Apokolips are destroyed before the Source entity recreates them as a singular planet. Additionally, most of the New Gods are killed during &quot;Final Crisis&quot; before being resurrected.

In &quot;The New 52&quot; reboot, New Genesis&#x27; surface is littered with the ruins of previous cities that were devastated in its conflict with Apokolips. Additionally, New Genesis technology was used to create OMAC.

==Powers and abilities==
The beings of New Genesis and Apokolips call themselves gods, living outside of normal time and space in an extradimensional realm known as the Fourth World. Due to their proximity to the Source, a primeval energy believed to be one of the ultimate foundations of the Universal Expression of Energy, these New Gods have evolved into genetically stable higher beings of evolutionary perfection.

All of the New Gods possess superhuman abilities of various kinds and differing degrees, including superhuman strength, stamina, reflexes, invulnerability and speed. The denizens of New Genesis and Apokolips are also immortal and endowed with a greater intelligence than &quot;Homo sapiens&quot;, despite their resemblance. Both worlds have the finest technology that the universe can offer.

Despite their immortality, the New Gods are vulnerable to a substance called Radion. Its source is unknown and its effects are toxic only in sustained amounts or after explosive exposure. The average New God can be slain by an application of Radion from a Radion blaster or bomb.

Writer Rachel Pollack introduced the idea in &quot;Sacrifice of the Gods&quot; in 1996 that the New Gods were giants and that the Boom Tube would shrink them as they traveled to normal time and space or enlarge beings who traveled to the Fourth World realm. For example, if Superman were to travel to Apokolips under his own power, he would be miniature in comparison to the New Gods – Orion remarked that &quot;Earth is but a speck in an air pocket&quot; and that the universe of New Genesis is the &quot;real world&quot;. Proportionally, entire planets were shown to seem no larger than golf balls.

==Bibliography==
Outside of the original three Kirby titles, and those strictly labeled &quot;New Gods&quot;, other characters from Kirby&#x27;s Fourth World have had their own titles. Mister Miracle has had numerous other iterations of his own comic, and Orion was given his own title in 2000 that ended in 2002. The aforementioned &quot;Jack Kirby&#x27;s Fourth World&quot; is another example, as is Takion, a New God not created by Kirby, but one that had his own series for seven issues in 1996. The New Gods and their concepts have at times played a central role in the DC Universe, in series such as Jim Starlin&#x27;s &quot;Cosmic Odyssey&quot;. Particularly, the character Darkseid has been a major force in the DC Universe, and is one of the main villains in the various &quot;Superman&quot; titles.

===Tales of the New Gods===
&quot;Tales of the New Gods&quot; was a backup feature that began in John Byrne&#x27;s &quot;Jack Kirby&#x27;s Fourth World&quot;, and continued in Walt Simonson&#x27;s &quot;Orion&quot; series. In the features for &quot;Jack Kirby&#x27;s Fourth World&quot;, Byrne almost exclusively provided the pencils and text for the stories. In the features for the &quot;Orion&quot; title, Simonson often wrote the story, and fellow artists would, appropriately, provide the artwork; although on rare occasions, other writers would provide the script/story. Two backup stories, though not under the &quot;Tales of the New Gods&quot; banner, were printed when Byrne filled in as penciller on &quot;Orion&quot; for the main stories in issues #13 and #14, with Simonson providing writing and pencilling, and Bob Wiacek inking.

===Collected editions===
The various New Gods stories have been collected into various volumes. All 11 issues of the original series have been collected into &quot;Jack Kirby&#x27;s New Gods&quot; (). DC Comics published a &quot;Tales of the New Gods&quot; trade paperback () in January 2008, which collects all of the back-up stories listed above, a Mark Evanier/Steve Rude &quot;Mister Miracle&quot; one-shot comic from 1987, and a previously unpublished story by Mark Millar and Steve Ditko originally meant to be printed in the pages of &quot;Orion&quot;. In 2008, DC released a one-shot titled &quot;Countdown Special: New Gods&quot; #1, which reprinted &quot;Forever People&quot; #1, &quot;Mister Miracle&quot; #1, and &quot;New Gods&quot; #7. &quot;Death of the New Gods&quot; has been collected into a hardcover edition (). and later reprinted in trade paperback.

The entirety of Kirby&#x27;s work on the &quot;Fourth World&quot; was collected in four &quot;Omnibus&quot; editions published in 2007 and 2008:
* &quot;Jack Kirby&#x27;s Fourth World Omnibus&quot;

==In other media==
===Film===
* The evil New Gods are referenced throughout &quot;Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice&quot; (2016). In one deleted scene from the film, which is included in the Ultimate Edition extended cut, Lex Luthor communicates with Steppenwolf using technology from a Kryptonian scout ship.
* The New Gods feature prominently in &quot;Justice League&quot; (2017), with the main antagonist being Steppenwolf (Ciarán Hinds). Exiled from Apokolips, Steppenwolf invades Earth in command of an army of Parademons, hunting down the three Mother Boxes located thereon. The Mother Boxes are hidden among the united forces of Earth, located in Atlantis, Themyscira and by mankind. Cyborg is created through the aid of a Mother Box, and has a connection to their power. The New Gods Darkseid (Ray Porter), DeSaad (Peter Guinness), and Granny Goodness (portrayed by an uncredited actress) were meant to appear in the film, but were cut following Snyder&#x27;s departure from the project. They did appear in the director&#x27;s cut of the film, &quot;Zack Snyder&#x27;s Justice League&quot; (2021). Snyder intended to include all the New Gods in his planned &quot;Justice League&quot; sequels, which went unproduced.
* A New Gods live-action film was in development from 2018 to 2021. It was planned to be directed by Ava DuVernay, originally with a script written by Kario Salem, but later with a script written by DuVernay and Tom King. Darkseid was planned to be the main antagonist of the film, but the film was also planned to include the Female Furies and All-Widow, among others.
* George Lucas&#x27;s &quot;Star Wars&quot; series has been speculated to be influenced by the New Gods. At a 1972 dinner that included comics writer/editor Roy Thomas and comic shop owner Ed Summer, George Lucas told his story for &quot;Star Wars&quot;, after which Roy Thomas noted that it sounded very similar to Jack Kirby&#x27;s &quot;New Gods&quot;.
* An alternate universe variant of Bekka as Wonder Woman appears in the 2015 animated film &quot;Justice League: Gods and Monsters&quot;.
* Darkseid appeared in the DC Animated Movie Universe as the main antagonist, appearing in the films &quot;Justice League: War&quot;, &quot;Reign of the Supermen&quot; and &quot;Justice League Dark: Apokolips War&quot;. Additionally, writer J. M. DeMatteis was interested in scripting a New Gods film set in this franchise.

<text>Durham City Association Football Club is a football club based in Durham, England. Members of the Football League from 1921 until 1928, they currently play in the .

==History==
The club was established in 1918 and initially competed in the Victory League, which was set up in celebration of the end of World War I, finishing bottom of the table. In 1919 they joined the North Eastern League, finishing fifth in their first season. Despite a mid-table finish in 1920–21, they were one of fourteen clubs automatically elected to the newly formed Third Division North of the Football League in 1921. They finished bottom of the division in 1922–23, but were re-elected. In 1925–26 the club reached the second round of the FA Cup for the first time, losing 3–0 at home to Division Three North rivals Southport. After finishing second-from-bottom in 1927–28, the club failed to win re-election, gaining only 11 votes to the 22 received by the newly elected Carlisle United.

Durham dropped back into Division One of the North Eastern League, replacing their reserve team. They finished bottom of Division One in 1928–29 and were relegated to Division Two. However, after finishing as Division Two runners-up in 1930–31, they were promoted back to Division One. In 1933 the club was renamed City of Durham. After three consecutive finishes in the bottom three between 1934–35 and 1936–37, they ended the 1937–38 season bottom of the league. They dropped into the Wearside League, but folded in November 1938, partly due to the introduction of greyhound racing at their Holiday Park ground.

The club was re-established in 1949, and joined the Wearside League for the 1950–51 season. After two seasons they were admitted to the Northern League. The club finished bottom of the league in 1954–55, but the following season saw them reach the first round of the FA Cup for the first time as a non-League club, eventually losing 3–1 at local rivals Bishop Auckland. In 1957–58 they went one better, reaching the second round, where they lost 3–0 at home to Tranmere Rovers in front of Ferens Park&#x27;s record crowd. The club finished bottom of the Northern League again in 1960–61, 1963–64 and 1965–66, but were runners-up in 1970–71. After the league gained a second division in 1982, they were relegated to Division Two at the end of the 1983–84 season. However, a third-place finish in 1987–88 saw them promoted back to Division One.

After three seasons in Division One, Durham were relegated back to Division Two at the end of the 1990–91 season, which had seen them finish bottom of the table. However, they were runners-up in Division Two the following season, and were promoted back to Division One. They went on to win their first league title in 1993–94, also winning the league&#x27;s Cleator Cup. Although the club were relegated at the end of the 1997–98 season, they won Division Two the following season to make an immediate return to Division One. They won the League Cup and the Cleator Cup in 2001–02 and finished as Division One runners-up in 2003–04. After winning the league for a second time and the Cleator Cup for a third time in 2007–08, they were promoted to Division One North of the Northern Premier League.

Durham&#x27;s first season in the Northern Premier League saw them win Division One North, earning promotion to the Premier Division; they also won the league&#x27;s Chairman&#x27;s Cup. However, their main sponsor withdrew in the summer of 2009 after the Football Conference ruled that they would not accept clubs with artificial pitches, which Durham had. As a result, the club lost most of its players and won only two league matches during the 2009–10 season. They finished bottom of the table with zero points after having six points deducted for playing a player under a false name, and were relegated back to Division One North. Although they managed to finish in mid-table in the following two seasons, they resigned from the league at the end of the 2011–12 season and returned to Division One of the Northern League. In 2013 the club was purchased by former Premier League player Olivier Bernard, with a stated aim of making them a talent development club for local professional teams. After finishing in the bottom three in 2015–16, the club were relegated to Division Two.

Durham continued to struggle, winning only one game in four years between April 2019 to May 2023, resulting in them being labelled &quot;England&#x27;s worst football club&quot;. The 2019–20 and 2020–21 seasons were not completed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and club avoided relegation. However, in 2021–22 they finished bottom of Division Two and were relegated to Division One of the Wearside League. The following season saw them finish bottom of Division One, resulting in relegation to the second tier of the Wearside League (renamed Division One for the 2023–24 season).

===Season-by-season record===
==Ground==
The club initially played at Garden House Park before moving to Kepier Haughs in 1920. Due to its distance from the city centre, the club relocated to Holiday Park in 1923.

After being reformed, the club played at Ferens Park until the end of the 1993–94 season. During the 1994–95 season they played at Chester-le-Street Town&#x27;s Moor Park, before moving to New Ferens Park in 1995. The ground has a capacity of 2,700, of which 270 is seated and 750 covered. An artificial pitch was installed in 2006. However, a dispute with the landlord led to the club moving to Consett&#x27;s Belle View Stadium in 2015, where they played until the end of the 2016–17 season. They then moved to Willington&#x27;s Hall Lane ground prior to the 2017–18 season. In 2022 the club relocated to Leyburn Grove in Houghton-le-Spring.

<text>The Plumian chair of Astronomy and Experimental Philosophy is one of the major professorships in Astronomy at Cambridge University, alongside the Lowndean Professorship (which is now mainly held by mathematicians). The chair is currently held at the Institute of Astronomy in the University. The Plumian chair was founded in 1704 by Thomas Plume, a member of Christ&#x27;s and Archdeacon of Rochester, to &quot;erect an Observatory and to maintain a studious and learned Professor of Astronomy and Experimental Philosophy, and to buy him and his successors utensils and instruments quadrants telescopes etc.&quot;

Trustees were appointed, and statutes drawn up by Isaac Newton, John Flamsteed and John Ellys. The first Professorship was awarded in 1706 to Roger Cotes, a former student of Newton, and the stipend was increased in 1768 by Dr Robert Smith, the second Plumian Professor.

<text>Mac McDonald (born Terence McDonald; June 18, 1949) is an American actor. He is known for playing Captain Hollister on the BBC TV series &quot;Red Dwarf&quot; and frequently plays American characters in other British TV shows. He has also had many movie roles in films such as &quot;Aliens&quot;, &quot;Batman&quot; and &quot;The Fifth Element&quot;, all of which were filmed in London.

==Life and career==
McDonald was born on Long Island, New York. After leaving school, McDonald pursued a stage career, with a preference for comedy and music. In 1968, he was in Shreveport, Louisiana as the local TV station&#x27;s Bozo the Clown. Later he moved to San Francisco, working as a cycle courier and joining the AAA Acting Company.

He developed an interest in the teachings of George Gurdjieff but in 1974 turned down an invitation to attend the movement&#x27;s training school, deciding instead to travel in Europe, armed only with a fool&#x27;s hat and a melodica. In Amsterdam, he met a fellow American and accepted an invitation to stay in a commune in Kentish Town, North London. There he stayed for some years, taking over a leatherworking business from another departing American and running a leather goods stall in the newly opened Camden Lock Market.

There he hit upon a novel idea for busking, the &quot;Human Jukebox&quot;, in which he waited in a large silver box until, when prompted by the insertion of a coin and the selection of a song, he opened a window and delivered his (unaccompanied) rendering. This was quite a success since McDonald&#x27;s tenor voice was reinforced by a showbizzy, faux-sincere personality that was by turns endearing, ironical and corny. As the &quot;Human Jukebox&quot;, he made his first UK TV appearance, standing in for Elton John&#x27;s part with Kiki Dee in the hit duet &quot;Don&#x27;t Go Breaking My Heart&quot;.

At about this time, McDonald joined another company, this time presenting children&#x27;s shows in conjunction with the Inner London Education Authority. In 1982, he and another member, Hilary, left to form a three-person musical comedy troupe, The Cheap Shots, with McDonald&#x27;s close friend Sakal providing the music. The threesome developed &quot;The Chip Shop Show&quot;, a series of spoof musicals popular on the newly burgeoning London alternative comedy circuit, making many appearances at London&#x27;s The Comedy Store alongside Ronnie Golden, John Hegley and others, including several future &quot;Red Dwarf&quot; players.

This format led to further TV work and McDonald acquired an agent, bringing appearances in TV commercials and other parts requiring an American. After a few minor film roles, his appearance in &quot;Red Dwarf&quot; raised his profile and brought more and better roles.

<doc id="461401" wikidata="Q7959747" url="?curid=461401" title="Wahconah Park">
<text>Wahconah Park is a city-owned baseball park located in Pittsfield, Massachusetts, and nestled in a working-class neighborhood. One of the last remaining ballparks in the United States with a wooden grandstand, it was constructed in 1919 and seats 4,500. Through the park&#x27;s history, 201 different Pittsfield players went on to the Major Leagues, and 100 different Pittsfield players already had some Major League experience. The park was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2005.

In the July 23, 1990, issue of &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;, author Daniel Okrent raved about the park in his column entitled &quot;Just A Little Bit of Heaven – Pittsfield&#x27;s Wahconah Park is Baseball as it Oughta Be.&quot;

In 2012, the stadium became the home field of the Pittsfield Suns, an expansion franchise of the Futures Collegiate Baseball League. The Suns did not play the 2024 season because of safety issues at Wahconah Park, and will again sit out the 2025 season.

==Field configuration==
Former park dimensions were 334 feet to left field, 374 feet to center field, and 333 feet to right field. The current field dimensions are 310 feet down the left field line, 377 feet to left field, 374 feet to center field, 403 feet to right-center field, and 305 feet down the right field line.

Because the field was constructed before the advent of field lighting, no harm was seen in orienting the diamond due west. It is one of only two professional ballparks in the U.S. today that faces west (the other being Sam Lynn Ballpark in Bakersfield, California, built in 1941). Lights were not installed until 1946. In 1989 a mesh screen was placed in center field. Nevertheless, some umpires still briefly suspend games at sunset, so that the setting sun will not interfere with the batters&#x27; view of the pitch.

In 1927, a dike was installed on the Housatonic River to prevent recurrent flooding.

==History==
The Pittsfield Mets were a minor-league baseball team moved to Pittsfield, Massachusetts from Little Falls, New York, by an investment group organized by Michael T. Casey. The team played in the New York - Penn League, and were affiliated with the New York Mets from 1989 to 2000 and the Houston Astros in 2001.

In 2002, the independent Berkshire Black Bears moved to Wahconah Park after three years of dormancy as the Massachusetts Mad Dogs. After the 2003 season, they did not renew their lease but moved to New Haven, Connecticut.

Jim Bouton proposed to renovate the park without any public dollars and bring professional baseball back. On July 3, 2004, a record crowd of 5,000 attended a vintage baseball game he organized at Wahconah Park between Pittsfield and Hartford, a game telecast live for over four hours on ESPN Classic as &quot;America&#x27;s Pastime: Vintage Baseball, Live&quot;. Commentators included Bouton, Bill Lee, actor Tim Robbins, and baseball historians John Thorn and David Pietrusza. Eventually, Pittsfield politics intervened and Bouton was forced out.

In 2005, former Boston Red Sox General Manager Dan Duquette brought the Pittsfield Dukes, a New England Collegiate Baseball League (NECBL) team, to Wahconah Park. During the 2007 season, the Dukes attracted a season attendance of 28,955 through 21 home games, averaging 1,378 fans per game. His agreement with the City of Pittsfield was jeopardized prior to the 2008 season over back maintenance fees, but Duquette and city officials reached a settlement. For the 2009 season, Duquette restyled the team the Pittsfield American Defenders, with a military theme. The park was called Nokona Stadium at Wahconah Park pursuant to a sponsorship deal with the manufacturer of baseball gloves that funded all-new bathrooms, stadium offices, and press box. On May 3, 2009, Williams College and Amherst College alumni played a game under 1859 rules to commemorate the 150th-anniversary of the first college baseball game, played between the two schools. Duquette, an alumnus of Amherst, was instrumental in organizing the event.

The Pittsfield American Defenders lasted only one season. In 2010, Duquette moved the NECBL franchise to his baseball camp in nearby Hinsdale, and moved his Can-Am League entry, the New Hampshire American Defenders, to Wahconah Park from Nashua, New Hampshire; they were known as the Pittsfield Colonials.

In 2012, the Pittsfield Suns, an expansion franchise of the Futures Collegiate Baseball League (FCBL), began playing at Wahconah Park. Marvin Goldklang is the majority owner; the Goldklang Group also owns part of the club. Goldklang previously owned and operated the Pittsfield Mets.

In March 2024, the FCBL announced that the Suns would not play the 2024 season because of safety issues at Wahconah Park. Pittsfield was also scheduled to sit out the 2025 season.

In the summer, concerts are held in Wahconah Park. It is also home to varsity football games for Pittsfield-area high schools.

<doc id="461402" wikidata="Q57312467" url="?curid=461402" title="Cybersix">
<text>Cybersix is an Argentinean comic book series published in 1991, created by the Argentine authors Carlos Trillo (story) and Carlos Meglia (art) for the comics magazine &quot;Skorpio&quot; (Eura Editoriale). The series first appeared in Spanish in November 1993. It follows the eponymous leather-clad genetic engineering survivor who cross-dresses (to conceal her identity) working as a male teacher during the day, and fights against the scientist who created her at night.

The series was adapted into a live-action television series and an animated television series that garnered positive critical reception from the Pulcinella Awards.

==Plot==
Von Reichter is a surviving member of Schutzstaffel in World War II. He works on experiments in South America, creating the &quot;Cyber&quot; series of artificial humanoids with super strength and agility. The 5000 original Cybers became servants, mimicked human emotions and making their will. When they disobeyed orders, Reichter orders them all to be destroyed. After the death of Cyber-29, Reichter transfers his brain into the body of a black panther named Data-7. Cyber-6 (Cybersix) is one of the survivors, who escapes and arrives in the city of Meridiana. She disguises herself as school teacher Adrian Seidelman after the real one is killed in a car crash. Cybersix defeats von Reichter&#x27;s creations, the human-like &quot;Techno&quot; series and the more Frankenstein&#x27;s monster-like Fixed Ideas, in order to drink the sustenance liquid contained within them. Along the way, she meets an orphaned boy Julian, Reichter&#x27;s cloned son José, and high school teacher Lucas Amato.

==Production==
===Comics===
The comics were originally published in Italy in the magazine &quot;Skorpio &quot;in 113 weekly 12-pages installments from May 1991 to July 1994, followed by 45 96-pages comic books between November 1994 and January 1999. Parts of the material were translated in Spanish and published in Argentina (since 1993 by El Globo Editor) and in Spain (since 1995 by Planeta De Agostini). Collections were released in French, with twelve volumes distributed by Editions Vents d&#x27;Ouest between 1994 and 1998.

===Live-action series===
The series debuted in Argentina on 15 March 1995. It was produced by Luis Gandulfo, Sebastián Parrotta, Fernando Rascovsky and Andre Ronco, and written by Ricardo Rodríguez, Carlos Meglia and Carlos Trillo. The series aired on Telefé, but was cancelled after only a few episodes due to low ratings. Cybersix was played by former model and actress Carolina Peleritti, José was played by Rodrigo de la Serna, and Doguyy was played by Mario Moscoso.

===Animated series===
==Controversy with &quot;Dark Angel&quot; and lawsuit==
Meglia and Trillo filed a lawsuit against James Cameron, claiming that &quot;Dark Angel&quot; plagiarized the series. Trillo and Meglia accused the show of stealing most of the plot from the comic and most recognizable elements. In a 2007 interview, Trillo stated that he and Meglia dropped the lawsuit due to lack of financial resources, although the issue is still a matter of controversy.

<doc id="461404" wikidata="Q2959666" url="?curid=461404" title="Charles Wood, 2nd Viscount Halifax">
<text>Charles Lindley Wood, 2nd Viscount Halifax (7 June 1839 – 19 January 1934), was a British Anglo-Catholic ecumenist who served as president of the English Church Union from 1868 to 1919, and from 1927 to 1934. In 1886, he was a former part of Northern Regiment of West Riding Yeomanry Cavalry became a Deputy Lieutenant of the North Riding of Yorkshire, also one of the Ecclesiastical Commissioners, and a member of Houses of Laymen for York.

==Early life and education==
Halifax was born in London, the eldest son of Charles Wood, 1st Viscount Halifax, a prominent Liberal politician, and his wife, the former Lady Mary Grey, the fifth daughter of the 2nd Earl Grey. As a student at Eton he was the favourite of William Johnson Cory, his master, who dedicated his book of Uranian verse, &quot;Ionica&quot;, to him. Between 1858 and 1863, he studied law and modern history at Christ Church, Oxford. He earned a BA in 1863 and MA in 1865.

From 1862 to 1877, he served as Groom of the Chamber to the Prince of Wales, the future Edward VII. He succeeded to the viscountcy on 8 August 1885.

==English Church Union==
An Anglo-Catholic, Halifax became influenced by the Oxford Movement and, at the request of Edward Bouverie Pusey, became president of the English Church Union, a society dedicated to the promotion of Catholic principles and practices within the Church of England, in 1868. Along with the French priest, he played a prominent role in the attempt to bring about dialogue between the Roman Catholic Church and the Church of England on the subject of Anglican orders, including the Malines Conversations. Due to disagreement from Canterbury and Westminster, no constructive dialogue ever came about, however, and the unhoped result of Halifax&#x27;s actions was the condemnation of Anglican orders as &quot;absolutely null and utterly void&quot; in the papal encyclical &quot;Apostolicae curae&quot;. The Archbishop of Canterbury, Edward White Benson, and the Archbishop of Westminster, Cardinal Herbert Vaughan, can be accused of letting this early attempt at rapprochement fall away due to the narrow-minded vision of each other&#x27;s place in the English church during that era. It might also be argued that Pope Leo XIII was led astray by Vaughan and like-minded Roman Catholic scholars who viewed the Church of England as a state church with no real theological authority. Benson, like most Anglican clergy in the power structure viewed any Roman Catholic involvement in England as the &quot;Italian Mission&quot;, with not even a toehold worth acknowledging in English Society. Halifax served as president of the English Church Union until 1919, and again from 1927 until his death. One of his last achievements was the union of the English Church Union with the Anglo-Catholic Congress in 1933.

==Personal life==

Halifax was a collector of ghost stories, many of which are to be found in &quot;Lord Halifax&#x27;s Complete Ghost Book&quot; () and &quot;The Ghost Book of Charles Lindley, Viscount Halifax&quot; ().

Halifax married Lady Agnes Elizabeth Courtenay (1838–1919), daughter of William Courtenay, 11th Earl of Devon, and his wife, Lady Elizabeth Fortescue, daughter of Hugh Fortescue, 1st Earl Fortescue. They had four sons and two daughters:

* The Hon. Charles Reginald Lindley Wood (7 July 1870 – 6 September 1890)
* The Hon. Alexandra Mary Elizabeth Wood (25 August 1871 – 10 March 1965), godchild of Queen Alexandra, married in 1898 Maj. Gen. Hugh Sutton
* The Hon. Francis Hugh Lindley Wood (21 September 1873 – 17 March 1889)
* The Hon. Mary Agnes Emily Wood (25 March 1877 – 25 March 1962), married in 1903 George Lane-Fox. He was later created, in 1933, the 1st Baron Bingley.
* The Hon. Henry Paul Lindley Wood (25 January 1879 – 6 June 1886)
* Edward Frederick Lindley Wood, 3rd Viscount Halifax and 1st Earl of Halifax (16 April 1881 – 23 December 1959)

Halifax died in 1934 aged 94, having outlived his three eldest sons. His fourth and youngest son succeeded to the viscountcy and was created Earl of Halifax in 1944 after serving as Viceroy of India, Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and British Ambassador to the United States.

<text>The longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) is a pine species native to the Southeastern United States, found along the coastal plain from East Texas to southern Virginia, extending into northern and central Florida. In this area it is also known as &quot;yellow pine&quot; or &quot;long leaf yellow pine&quot;, although it is properly just one out of a number of species termed yellow pine. It reaches a height of and a diameter of . In the past, before extensive logging, they reportedly grew to with a diameter of . The tree is a cultural symbol of the Southern United States, being the official state tree of Alabama. This particular species is one of the eight pine tree species that falls under the &quot;Pine&quot; designation as the state tree of North Carolina.

==Description==

The bark is thick, reddish-brown, and scaly. The leaves are dark green and needle-like, and occur in bundles of mainly three, sometimes two or four, especially in seedlings. They often are twisted and in length. A local race of &quot;P. palustris&quot; in a cove near Rockingham, North Carolina, have needles up to 24 inches (61 centimeters ) in length. It is one of the two Southeastern U.S. pines with long needles, the other being slash pine.

The cones, both female seed cones (ovulate strobili) and male pollen cones (staminate strobili), are initiated during the growing season before buds emerge. Pollen cones begin forming in their buds in July, while seed conelets are formed during a relatively short period of time in August. Pollination occurs early the following spring, with the male cones long. The female (seed) cones mature in about 20 months from pollination; when mature, they are yellow-brown in color, long, and broad, opening to , and have a small, but sharp, downward-pointing spine on the middle of each scale. The seeds are long, with a wing.

Longleaf pine takes 100 to 150 years to become full size and may live to be 500 years old. When young, they grow a long taproot, which usually is long; by maturity, they have a wide spreading lateral root system with several deep &#x27;sinker&#x27; roots. They grow on well-drained, usually sandy soil, characteristically in pure stands. 
Longleaf pine also is known as being one of several species grouped as a southern yellow pine or longleaf yellow pine, and in the past as pitch pine (a name dropped as it caused confusion with pitch pine, &quot;Pinus rigida&quot;).

==Etymology==
The species epithet &quot;palustris&quot; is Latin for &quot;of the marsh&quot; and indicates its common habitat. The scientific name meaning &quot;of marshes&quot; is a misunderstanding on the part of Philip Miller, who described the species, after seeing longleaf pine forests with temporary winter flooding.

==Ecology==

Longleaf pine is highly pyrophytic (resistant to wildfire) and dependent on fire. Their thick bark and growth habits help to provide a tolerance to fire. Periodic natural wildfire and anthropogenic fires select for this species by removing competition and exposing bare soil for successful germination of seeds. The lack of medium-tall trees (called a midstory canopy) leads to open longleaf pine forests or savannas. New seedlings do not appear at all tree-like and resemble a dark-green fountain of needles. This form is called the grass stage. During this stage, which lasts for 5–12 years, vertical growth is very slow, and the tree may take a number of years simply to grow ankle high. After that, it has a growth spurt, especially if it is in a gap or no tree canopy is above it. In the grass stage, it is very resistant to low intensity fires because the terminal bud is protected from lethal heating by the tightly packed needles. While relatively immune to fire at this stage, the plant is quite appealing to feral pigs; the early settlers&#x27; habit of releasing swine into the woodlands to feed may have been partly responsible for the decline of the species.

Longleaf pine forests are rich in biodiversity. They are well-documented for their high levels of plant diversity, in groups including sedges, grasses, carnivorous plants, and orchids. These forests also provide habitat for gopher tortoises, which as keystone species, dig burrows that provide habitat for hundreds of other species of animals. The red-cockaded woodpecker is dependent on mature pine forests and is now endangered as a result of this decline. Longleaf pine seeds are large and nutritious, forming a significant food source for birds (notably the brown-headed nuthatch) and other wildlife. Nine salamander species and 26 frog species are characteristic of pine savannas, along with 56 species of reptiles, 13 of which could be considered specialists on this habitat.

The Red Hills Region of Florida and Georgia is home to some of the best-preserved stands of longleaf pines. These forests have been burned regularly for many decades to encourage bobwhite quail habitat in private hunting plantations.

== Native range, restoration, and protection ==

Before European settlement, longleaf pine forest dominated as much as stretching from Virginia south to Florida and west to East Texas. Its range was defined by the frequent widespread fires that were lit by humans and occurred naturally throughout the southeast. In the late 19th century, these virgin timber stands were &quot;among the most sought-after timber trees in the country.&quot; This rich ecosystem now has been relegated to less than 5% of its presettlement range due to fire suppression and clear-cutting practices:

As they stripped the woods of their trees, loggers left mounds of flammable debris that frequently fueled catastrophic fires, destroying both the remaining trees and seedlings. The exposed earth left behind by clear-cutting operations was highly susceptible to erosion, and nutrients were washed from the already porous soils. This further destroyed the natural seeding process. At the peak of the timber cutting in the 1890s and first decade of the new century, the longleaf pine forests of the Sandhills were providing millions of board feet of timber each year. The timber cutters gradually moved across the South; by the 1920s, most of the &quot;limitless&quot; virgin longleaf pine forests were gone.
:— Jerry Simmons, &quot;ASLC Large Operation from Beginnings&quot;

In &quot;pine barrens&quot; most of the day. Low, level, sandy tracts; the pines wide apart; the sunny spaces between full of beautiful abounding grasses, liatris, long, wand-like solidago, saw palmettos, etc., covering the ground in garden style. Here I sauntered in delightful freedom, meeting none of the cat-clawed vines, or shrubs, of the alluvial bottoms.
: – John Muir
Efforts are being made to restore longleaf pine ecosystems within its natural range. Some groups such as the Longleaf Alliance are actively promoting research, education, and management of the longleaf pine.

The USDA offers cost-sharing and technical assistance to private landowners for longleaf restoration through the NRCS Longleaf Pine Initiative. Similar programs are available through most state forestry agencies in the longleaf&#x27;s native range. In August 2009, the Alabama Forestry Commission received $1.757 million in stimulus money to restore longleaf pines in state forests.

Four large core areas within the range of the species provide the opportunity to protect the biological diversity of the coastal plain and to restore wilderness areas east of the Mississippi River. Each of these four (Eglin Air Force Base: 187,000+ ha; Apalachicola National Forest: 228,000+ ha; Okefenokee-Osceola: 289,000+ ha; De Soto National Forest: 200,000+ ha) have nearby lands that offer the potential to expand the total protected territory for each area to well beyond 500,000 ha. These areas would provide the opportunity not only to restore forest stands, but also to restore populations of native plants and animals threatened by landscape fragmentation.

Notable eccentric populations exist within the Uwharrie National Forest in the central Piedmont region of North Carolina. These have survived owing to relative inaccessibility, and in one instance, intentional protection in the 20th century by a private landowner (a property now owned and conserved by the LandTrust for Central North Carolina).
The United States Forest Service is conducting prescribed burning programs in the 258,864-acre Francis Marion National Forest, located outside of Charleston, South Carolina. They are hoping to increase the longleaf pine forest type to by 2017 and in the long term. In addition to longleaf restoration, prescribed burning will enhance the endangered red-cockaded woodpeckers&#x27; preferred habitat of open, park-like stands, provide habitat for wildlife dependent on grass-shrub habitat, which is very limited, and reduce the risk of damaging wildfires.

Since the 1960s, longleaf restoration has been ongoing on almost 95,000 acres of state and federal land in the sandhills region of South Carolina, between the piedmont and coastal plain. The region is characterized by deep, infertile sands deposited by a prehistoric sea, with generally arid conditions. By the 1930s, most of the native longleaf had been logged, and the land was heavily eroded. Between 1935 and 1939, the federal government purchased large portions of this area from local landowners as a relief measure under the Resettlement Administration. These landowners were resettled on more fertile land elsewhere. Today, the South Carolina Sand Hills State Forest comprises about half of the acreage, and half is owned by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service as the adjacent Carolina Sandhills National Wildlife Refuge. At first, restoration of forest cover was the goal. Fire suppression was practiced until the 1960s, when prescribed fire was introduced on both the state forest and the Sandhills NWR as part of the restoration of the longleaf/wiregrass ecosystem.

Nokuse Plantation is a 53,000-acre private nature preserve located around 100 miles east of Pensacola, Florida. The preserve was established by M.C. Davis, a wealthy philanthropist who made his fortune buying and selling land and mineral rights, and who has spent $90 million purchasing land for the preserve, primarily from timber companies. One of its main goals is the restoration of longleaf pine forest, to which end he has had 8 million longleaf pine seedlings planted on the land.

A 2009 study by the National Wildlife Federation says that longleaf pine forests will be particularly well adapted to environmental changes caused by climate disruption.
In 2023, the Virginia Department of Conservation and Recreation announced a plan to reintroduce longleaf pines to the Dendron Swamp Natural Area Preserve, with seedlings propagated from cones collected at South Quay Sandhills Natural Area Preserve.

== Uses ==

Vast forests of longleaf pine once were present along the southeastern Atlantic coast and Gulf Coast of North America, as part of the eastern savannas. These forests were the source of naval storesresin, turpentine, and timberneeded by merchants and the navy for their ships. They have been cutover since for timber and usually replaced with faster-growing loblolly pine and slash pine, for agriculture, and for urban and suburban development. Due to this deforestation and overharvesting, only about 3% of the original longleaf pine forest remains, and little new is planted. Longleaf pine is available, however, at many nurseries within its range; the southernmost known point of sale is in Lake Worth Beach, Florida.

The yellow, resinous wood is used for lumber and pulp. Boards cut years ago from virgin timber were very wide, up to , and a thriving salvage business obtains these boards from demolition projects to be reused as flooring in upscale homes.

The extremely long needles are popular for use in the ancient craft of coiled basket making.

Annual sales of pine straw for use as mulch were estimated at $200M in 2021.

The stumps and taproots of old trees become saturated with resin and will not rot. Farmers sometimes find old buried stumps in fields, even in some that were cleared a century ago, and these usually are dug up and sold as fatwood, &quot;fat lighter&quot;, or &quot;lighter wood&quot;, which is in demand as kindling for fireplaces, wood stoves, and barbecue pits. In old-growth pine, the heartwood of the bole is often saturated in the same way. When boards are cut from the fat lighter wood, they are very heavy and will not rot, but buildings constructed of them are quite flammable and make extremely hot fires.

The seeds of the longleaf pine are edible raw or roasted.

==Culture==
The longleaf pine is the official state tree of Alabama. It is referenced by name in the first line of the official North Carolina State Toast. Also, the state&#x27;s highest honor is named the &quot;Order of the Long Leaf Pine&quot;. The state tree of North Carolina is officially designated as simply &quot;pine&quot;, under which this and seven other species fall.

<doc id="461408" wikidata="Q6831553" url="?curid=461408" title="Michael Jackson (television executive)">
<text>Michael Richard Jackson (born 11 February 1958) is a British television producer and executive. He was one of only three people to have been Controller of both BBC1 and BBC2, the main television channels of the British Broadcasting Corporation, and for being the first media studies graduate to reach a senior level in the British media. He was also the Chief Executive of British television station, Channel 4, between 1997 and 2001. In 2018, he co-founded Two Cities TV, with Wall to Wall Media founder and ex-CEO Alex Graham

==Early life and career==
Born in Macclesfield, Cheshire, Jackson was the son of Ernest Jackson, a baker, and his wife Margaret. He was educated at The King&#x27;s School, at the time a direct-grant grammar school, and now an independent school in Macclesfield, Cheshire and his sister, Hilary, later claimed in a newspaper feature that he was already focused on a media career by the age of twelve. Following school, Jackson studied at the Polytechnic of Central London (renamed the University of Westminster in 1992), from which he graduated with a First Class Honours BA in Media Studies in 1979. The media studies degree at the Polytechnic of Central London had been launched by David Cardiff in 1969, when the institution was still known by its former title of Regent Street Polytechnic, and was the first such degree course ever to have been established in the United Kingdom.

Immediately after graduating, Jackson became the organiser of &quot;The Channel Four Group&quot;, having written his final year dissertation at college on the prospect of a fourth national television channel in Britain. The Channel Four Group was a collective of television producers lobbying the British Government to establish a new independent television channel outside of the BBC / ITV duopoly, to act as a &quot;publisher&quot; of programmes produced by independent production companies rather than using the almost exclusively in-house production methods the existing channels then employed. This channel, named Channel 4, was eventually launched in 1982, and Jackson was the producer of one of its first major documentary series, &quot;The Sixties&quot;, screened that year.

The following year he joined the staff of the independent production company Beat Productions Ltd, where he continued to make programmes for Channel 4. Two of the programmes he worked on for the channel during the 1980s were &quot;Open the Box&quot;, which looked at the way television programmes were both produced and viewed and the attitudes held towards them, and &quot;The Media Show&quot;, of which he was founding editor when it launched in 1987. &quot;The Media Show&quot; was described by Waldemar Januszczak in &quot;The Guardian&quot; newspaper in 1997 as &quot;one of the defining television programmes of the 1980s... In Michael Jackson, its first producer, it gave us a media-genius.&quot;

Despite his success in the independent sector however, in 1988 Jackson was persuaded by Alan Yentob, the then Controller of BBC Two, to join the staff of the BBC. Jackson came to be seen as something of a protégé of Yentob&#x27;s during his time at the corporation, both coming from a background in arts and media programming, and Yentob immediately installed Jackson as the founding editor of the new late-night BBC 2 arts magazine series &quot;The Late Show&quot;.

==BBC==
Prior to the launch of &quot;The Late Show&quot; in January 1989, there was some scepticism as to whether or not the programme, running four nights per week on BBC 2 in a late night slot after &quot;Newsnight&quot;, would be a success. In a feature for &quot;The Times&quot; newspaper on television arts coverage, published two months prior to the show&#x27;s launch, Bryan Appleyard wrote that: &quot;the real tension is building up around &quot;The Late Show&quot; and its young creator, Michael Jackson.&quot; Appleyard pointed out that: &quot;the investment financial, intellectual and egotistical in the programme is enormous... Yentob is determined to put his own cultural stamp on BBC2 and Jackson has everything to prove.&quot; However, the programme went on to be a success, running for six years. Looking back at &quot;The Late Show&quot; and other television arts programming in a feature for &quot;The Guardian&quot; in 2003, David Herman felt that the programme represented the last great era of television arts coverage. &quot;&quot;The Late Show&quot; cast its net wider in terms of formats... What drove it was the enthusiasm and passions of its presenters, producers and editors, and this built a certain eclecticism and unashamed highbrowness into its agenda... It could be argued that the real high point of intellectual life on British television was not the 1960s or the 1970s, but the decade between the beginning of Channel 4 and the end of &quot;The Late Show&quot; in 1995.&quot;

Jackson remained as editor of &quot;The Late Show&quot; for the next two years, until in 1991 he was promoted to become BBC television&#x27;s Head of Music and Arts. At the age of thirty-three, he was the youngest Head of Department in the history of the BBC.

In 1993, at the age of thirty-five, he became the second youngest Channel Controller in the BBC&#x27;s history when he was promoted to succeed Yentob, who had been promoted to Controller of BBC 1, as Controller of BBC 2. Jackson&#x27;s time at BBC 2 was generally seen as a great success — he was described by &quot;The Guardian&quot; in 1996 as &quot;one of the best controllers BBC2 has ever had.&quot; During his time in charge of the channel it increased its average audience share from 10% to 11%, and was the only channel during that period to increase its audience share in households which had cable or satellite television.

Jackson enjoyed particular success with drama at BBC 2, finally commissioning the production of Peter Flannery&#x27;s serial &quot;Our Friends in the North&quot; (1996) in 1994 after the drama had spent a decade in development and been commissioned and then cancelled on two previous occasions. Its £7 million budget was a record for BBC 2, but the serial was a great success, garnering huge critical acclaim and many accolades at the British Academy Television Awards (BAFTAs), Royal Television Society Awards and others. Other drama successes came with &quot;This Life&quot; (1996–97) and the American import &quot;The X-Files&quot; (1994–96; its ratings success on BBC 2 saw it transferred to BBC 1).

Other successes Jackson oversaw at the channel included the documentary series &quot;The Death of Yugoslavia&quot; (1995) and &quot;The House&quot; (1996), the daytime television series &quot;Ready Steady Cook&quot; (1994–2010) and &quot;Esther&quot; (1996–98) and the comedies &quot;The Day Today&quot; (1994), &quot;Knowing Me, Knowing You with Alan Partridge&quot; (1994) and &quot;The Fast Show&quot; (1994–2000). However, he also took the decision to cancel &quot;The Late Show&quot;, the series he himself had initiated, in 1995. &quot;I think it simply boils down to Michael not wanting to spend that much money that late,&quot; was how one &quot;insider&quot; described the decision to &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; newspaper. He also delayed the transmission of the second series of the sitcom &quot;Joking Apart&quot;; this has been seen as ruining the momentum that the series needed to become established.

Jackson&#x27;s next move came somewhat unexpectedly in the summer of 1996, when the Director-General of the BBC, John Birt, unveiled a series of major — and controversial — changes to the structure of the corporation. The administration of the BBC was to be split into two main divisions; BBC Broadcast, responsible for the commissioning of programmes and the running of the channels, and BBC Production, responsible for producing in-house programme content. Some of these changes were made very suddenly — Alan Yentob was informed that he was to be moved on from his post as Controller of BBC 1, and allegedly given just forty-eight hours to decide whether he wanted to run BBC Broadcast as Director of Television or BBC Production as Director of Programmes.

Yentob chose the latter, which although technically a promotion was interpreted by some as him having effectively been sidelined. In his place, Jackson was promoted to a dual role as both Controller of BBC 1 and Director of Television, responsible overall for all BBC television broadcasting as well as the implementation of planned future services on the new digital television platforms. &quot;The Guardian&quot; suggested, in reference to Jackson&#x27;s replacement of Yentob at BBC 1, that &quot;in the end Yentob was eclipsed by his protege.&quot;

Jackson had little time to make a significant impact in his new senior role at BBC One, however. He did commission a new range of idents for the channel, keeping the traditional &quot;globe&quot; theme used since 1963, but now based around the globe in the form of a roaming hot air balloon. But in May 1997, after less than a year in his new post and in what &quot;The Guardian&quot; described as &quot;a hammer blow&quot; to the BBC, Jackson was tempted away from the corporation to succeed Michael Grade as the Chief Executive of Channel 4. He took up the post at the end of June.

==Channel 4==
At Channel 4, Jackson enjoyed several successes. In 1998 the channel won the rights to broadcast the England cricket team&#x27;s home Test matches in a £103 million deal, for the first time in history taking the coverage away from the BBC, which had broadcast television coverage of such matches since 1938. Channel 4&#x27;s coverage of the sport went on to win a British Academy Television Award (BAFTA) for Best Sports Coverage in 2000.

The channel&#x27;s comedy output enjoyed particular success under Jackson&#x27;s aegis, with the sitcoms &quot;Spaced&quot; (1999–2001) and &quot;Black Books&quot; (2000–04), sketch show &quot;Smack the Pony&quot; (1999–2003) and the more generally comic &quot;Da Ali G Show&quot; (2000) and &quot;So Graham Norton&quot; (1998–2002) all proving to be popular successes. However, it was the launch of the British version of &quot;Big Brother&quot; (2000–2018) that proved to be his longest-lasting legacy, with the reality television series becoming an immediate popular culture event and proving to be a returning mainstay of the Channel 4 schedules.

Jackson is often cited as the reason for the channel&#x27;s once flagship soap opera &quot;Brookside&quot; being removed from primetime in 2002 before finally being axed in 2003 after 21 years, so much so that the main antagonist in the soap&#x27;s final few episodes was named Jack Michaelson, a drug dealer who was hated by the residents of the Close and eventually hanged from a bedroom window in the final episode.

In drama, Jackson was at times criticised for relying more on US imports than home-grown material, with &quot;Ally McBeal&quot;, &quot;The West Wing&quot; and &quot;Sex and the City&quot; all arriving at the broadcaster during his time there. In 1999, he also spent £100 million reacquiring the rights to the US drama series &quot;ER&quot; — in a joint deal which also included the sitcom &quot;Friends&quot; — which Channel 4 had lost first-run rights for to rival broadcaster Sky1 in 1996. Home-grown drama successes were rarer, as he himself admitted in a 2001 interview with &quot;The Guardian&quot;. He did, however, point to significant British drama successes with &quot;Queer as Folk&quot; (1999–2000) and &quot;Teachers&quot; (2001–04), describing the former as one of the &quot;signature shows&quot; of his time at the channel.

The high spending on imported shows, however, contributed to a financial shortfall at Channel 4 that saw the channel negotiating a £55 million overdraft in his final year in charge, and by October that year having already used up most of a £49 million reserve it had set aside for the year. Jackson also later admitted that he had made a mistake in setting up the channel&#x27;s independent film production company FilmFour Limited in 1998. Channel 4 had participated in feature film production ever since its launch in 1982, backing successful films such as &quot;Four Weddings and a Funeral&quot; (1994), but FilmFour Limited was an attempt to set up a full-blown rival to Hollywood studio productions. The studio saw several of its big-budget films flop, and was eventually closed down in 2002, with the channel going back to its original more modest film backing strategy. More successful spin-offs from the main channel under Jackson&#x27;s control were the establishment of the offshoot digital television channels E4 and Film4, which continued to grow successfully.

In 2001 Channel 4 won eleven BAFTAs, but on 23 July that year Jackson shocked many in the British television industry when he announced that he had decided to leave the channel to work for Barry Diller&#x27;s USA Entertainment company. Jackson had first been approached by Diller in 2000, but had declined his initial offer as he had wanted to remain at Channel 4 to oversee the launch of the E4 digital channel. The reaction to Jackson&#x27;s departure was similar to that which had greeted his equally unexpected move from the BBC four years previously. One producer for Channel 4 told &quot;The Independent&quot; the week that his decision was announced that: &quot;We are devastated.&quot;

==America==
Jackson&#x27;s initial role in the US was as President and Chief Executive of USA Entertainment. In this role he was responsible for overseeing the cable television networks USA Network and Sci-Fi, as well as the feature film production company USA Films. After various mergers, his job became Chairman of Universal Television, and in this role he commissioned the successful drama series &quot;Monk&quot; (2002–2009) and &quot;The Dead Zone&quot; (2002–2007) and Battlestar Galactica (2004-2009) In January 2006, he was made President of Programming of Barry Diller&#x27;s IAC/InterActiveCorp internet business responsible for developing and acquiring content-based web businesses.   While at IAC he acquired majority control of Connected Ventures, comprising Collegehumor.com and Vimeo.com for a reported $25M. In 2021 Vimeo was spun out of IAC with a market capitalisation of $8B.

Since his move to the US, Jackson has been linked at various times with a return to a senior media position in the United Kingdom. In 2006, he was offered the role of CEO of ITV as a part of a proposed merger between the NTL cable company (now Virgin Media) and ITV plc, however BSkyB effectively blocked the merger by controversially buying a 17.9% stake in ITV plc.

== Independent Producer &amp; Board Member ==
Since 2010, Jackson has been an active producer while also sitting on a number of boards.

He has executive produced factual programmes including: Arena: Flames of Passion (BBC, 2007, 1x90m) about the under-appreciated parts of British cinema; The Genius of Photography (BBC, 2007, 6x1hr), the first television history of photography; America: The Story of US (The History Channel, 2011, 9x1hr); Civilisations (BBC, 2018, 9x1hr); and Creativity [Working Title] (BBC, 2022, 6x1hr).

Board positions during his career have included EMI Group plc (1999-2002); Nutopia (2008-2016); Scottish Television plc (2009-2018); DIC Entertainment 2006-2009), Peters Fraser and Dunlop 2015-2020).  He was Chairman of the leading UK photography non-profit The Photographers Gallery between 1998 and 2001

== Two Cities Television Ltd ==
In 2018, Jackson Executive Produced his first drama series – Patrick Melrose, starring Benedict Cumberbatch (Sky Atlantic/Showtime, 2018, 5x1hr). The series was nominated for four Emmy awards including Best Drama Series and won four BAFTA&#x27;s including Best mini-series. Patrick Melrose was produced by Two Cities TV, Sunnymarch, Rachael Horotvitz’ company West Fourth Films, and Little Island.

Two Cities TV was founded in 2018 by Jackson, Stephen Wright and Alex Graham with funding from BBC Studios, based in Belfast, London, and New York. In 2020, Scottish Television became Two Cities’ backer and Graham left the company. Also in 2020, Two Cities was commissioned by BBC One to make the Belfast based police drama &quot;Blue Lights&quot;.

Jackson is a Fellow of the Royal Television Society (1997) and holds an Honorary DLitt from the University of Westminster (1995).

<text>Arbovirus is an informal name for any virus that is transmitted by arthropod vectors. The term &quot;arbovirus&quot; is a portmanteau word (&quot;ar&quot;thropod-&quot;bo&quot;rne &quot;virus&quot;). &quot;Tibovirus&quot; (&quot;ti&quot;ck-&quot;bo&quot;rne &quot;virus&quot;) is sometimes used to more specifically describe viruses transmitted by ticks, a superorder within the arthropods. Arboviruses can affect both animals (including humans) and plants. In humans, symptoms of arbovirus infection generally occur 3–15 days after exposure to the virus and last three or four days. The most common clinical features of infection are fever, headache, and malaise, but encephalitis and viral hemorrhagic fever may also occur.

==Signs and symptoms==
The incubation period – the time between when infection occurs and when symptoms appear – varies from virus to virus, but is usually limited between 2 and 15 days for arboviruses. The majority of infections, however, are asymptomatic. Among cases in which symptoms do appear, symptoms tend to be non-specific, resembling a flu-like illness, and are not indicative of a specific causative agent. These symptoms include fever, headache, malaise, rash and fatigue. Rarely, vomiting and hemorrhagic fever may occur. The central nervous system can also be affected by infection, as encephalitis and meningitis are sometimes observed. Prognosis is good for most people, but is poor in those who develop severe symptoms, with up to a 20% mortality rate in this population depending on the virus. The very young, elderly, pregnant women, and people with immune deficiencies are more likely to develop severe symptoms.

==Cause==
===Transmission===

Arboviruses maintain themselves in nature by going through a cycle between a host, an organism that carries the virus, and a vector, an organism that carries and transmits the virus to other organisms. For arboviruses, vectors are commonly mosquitoes, ticks, sandflies and other arthropods that consume the blood of vertebrates for nutritious or developmental purposes. Vertebrates which have their blood consumed act as the hosts, with each vector generally having an affinity for the blood of specific species, making those species the hosts.

Transmission between the vector and the host occurs when the vector feeds on the blood of the vertebrate, wherein the virus that has established an infection in the salivary glands of the vector comes into contact with the host&#x27;s blood. While the virus is inside the host, it undergoes a process called amplification, where the virus replicates at sufficient levels to induce viremia, a condition in which there are large numbers of virions present in the blood. The abundance of virions in the host&#x27;s blood allows the host to transmit the virus to other organisms if its blood is consumed by them. When uninfected vectors become infected from feeding, they are then capable of transmitting the virus to uninfected hosts, resuming amplification of virus populations. If viremia is not achieved in a vertebrate, the species can be called a &quot;dead-end host&quot;, as the virus cannot be transmitted back to the vector.

An example of this vector-host relationship can be observed in the transmission of the West Nile virus. Female mosquitoes of the genus &quot;Culex&quot; prefer to consume the blood of passerine birds, making them the hosts of the virus. When these birds are infected, the virus amplifies, potentially infecting multiple mosquitoes that feed on its blood. These infected mosquitoes may go on to further transmit the virus to more birds. If the mosquito is unable to find its preferred food source, it will choose another. Human blood is sometimes consumed, but since the West Nile virus does not replicate that well in mammals, humans are considered a dead-end host.

===In humans===
Person-to-person transmission of arboviruses is not common, but can occur. Blood transfusions, organ transplantation, and the use of blood products can transmit arboviruses if the virus is present in the donor&#x27;s blood or organs. Because of this, blood and organs are often screened for viruses before being administered. Rarely, vertical transmission, or mother-to-child transmission, has been observed in infected pregnant and breastfeeding women. Exposure to used needles may also transmit arboviruses if they have been used by an infected person or animal. This puts intravenous drug users and healthcare workers at risk for infection in regions where the arbovirus may be spreading in human populations.

===Virology===
Arboviruses are a polyphyletic group, belonging to various viral genera and therefore exhibiting different virologic characteristics.

==Diagnosis==
Preliminary diagnosis of arbovirus infection is usually based on clinical presentations of symptoms, places and dates of travel, activities, and epidemiological history of the location where infection occurred. Definitive diagnosis is typically made in a laboratory by employing some combination of blood tests, particularly immunologic, serologic and/or virologic techniques such as ELISA, complement fixation, polymerase chain reaction, neutralization test, and hemagglutination-inhibition test.

===Classification===
In the past, arboviruses were organized into one of four groups: A, B, C, and D. Group A denoted members of the genus &quot;Alphavirus&quot;, Group B were members of the genus &quot;Flavivirus&quot;, and Group C remains as the Group C serogroup of the genus &quot;Orthobunyavirus&quot;. Group D was renamed in the mid-1950s to the Guama group and is currently the Guama serogroup in the genus &quot;Orthobunyavirus&quot;. Currently, viruses are jointly classified according to Baltimore classification and a virus-specific system based on standard biological classification. With the exception of the African swine fever virus, which belongs to the &quot;Asfarviridae&quot; family of viruses, all major clinically important arboviruses belong to one of the following four groups:
* Order &quot;Bunyavirales&quot; (Baltimore class V)
** Genus &quot;Orthobunyavirus&quot;

==Prevention==
Vector control measures, especially mosquito control, are essential to reducing the transmission of disease by arboviruses. Habitat control involves draining swamps and removal of other pools of stagnant water (such as old tires, large outdoor potted plants, empty cans, etc.) that often serve as breeding grounds for mosquitoes. Insecticides can be applied in rural and urban areas, inside houses and other buildings, or in outdoor environments. They are often quite effective for controlling arthropod populations, though use of some of these chemicals is controversial, and some organophosphates and organochlorides (such as DDT) have been banned in many countries. Infertile male mosquitoes have been introduced in some areas in order to reduce the breeding rate of relevant mosquito species. Larvicides are also used worldwide in mosquito abatement programs. Temefos is a common mosquito larvicide.

People can also reduce the risk of getting bitten by arthropods by employing personal protective measures such as sleeping under mosquito nets, wearing protective clothing, applying insect repellents such as permethrin and DEET to clothing and exposed skin, and (where possible) avoiding areas known to harbor high arthropod populations. Arboviral encephalitis can be prevented in two major ways: personal protective measures and public health measures to reduce the population of infected mosquitoes. Personal measures include reducing time outdoors particularly in early evening hours, wearing long pants and long sleeved shirts and applying mosquito repellent to exposed skin areas. Public health measures often require spraying of insecticides to kill juvenile (larvae) and adult mosquitoes.

===Vaccination===
Vaccines are available for the following arboviral diseases:
* Japanese encephalitis
* Yellow fever
* Tick-borne encephalitis
* Rift Valley Fever (only veterinary use)

Vaccines are in development for the following arboviral diseases:
* Zika Virus
* Dengue fever
* Eastern Equine encephalitis
* West Nile
* Chikungunya
* Rift Valley Fever

==Treatment==
Because the arboviral encephalitides are viral diseases, antibiotics are not an effective form of treatment and no effective antiviral drugs have yet been discovered. Treatment is supportive, attempting to deal with problems such as swelling of the brain, loss of the automatic breathing activity of the brain and other treatable complications like bacterial pneumonia.

The WHO caution against the use of aspirin and ibuprofen as they can increase the risk of bleeding.

==Epidemiology==
Most arboviruses are located in tropical areas, however as a group they have a global distribution. The warm climate conditions found in tropical areas allows for year-round transmission by the arthropod vectors. Other important factors determining geographic distribution of arthropod vectors include rainfall, humidity, and vegetation.

Mapping methods such as GIS and GPS have allowed for spatial and temporal analyses of arboviruses. Tagging cases or breeding sites geographically has allowed for deeper examination of vector transmission.

To see the epidemiology of specific arboviruses, the following resources hold maps, fact sheets, and reports on arboviruses and arboviral epidemics.
==History==

Arboviruses were not known to exist until the rise of modern medicine, with the germ theory and an understanding that viruses were distinct from other microorganisms. The connection between arthropods and disease was not postulated until 1881 when Cuban doctor and scientist Carlos Finlay proposed that yellow fever may be transmitted by mosquitoes instead of human contact, a reality that was verified by Major Walter Reed in 1901. The primary vector, &quot;Aedes aegypti&quot;, had spread globally from the 15th to the 19th centuries as a result of globalization and the slave trade. This geographic spreading caused dengue fever epidemics throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, and later, in 1906, transmission by the &quot;Aedes&quot; mosquitoes was confirmed, making yellow fever and dengue fever the first two diseases known to be caused by viruses.

Thomas Milton Rivers published the first clear description of a virus as distinct from a bacterium in 1927. The discovery of the West Nile virus came in 1937, and has since been found in &quot;Culex&quot; populations causing epidemics throughout Africa, the Middle East, and Europe. The virus was introduced into the Western Hemisphere in 1999, sparking a series of epidemics. During the latter half of the 20th century, Dengue fever reemerged as a global disease, with the virus spreading geographically due to urbanization, population growth, increased international travel, and global warming, and continues to cause at least 50 million infections per year, making Dengue fever the most common and clinically important arboviral disease.

Yellow fever, alongside malaria, was a major obstacle in the construction of the Panama Canal. French supervision of the project in the 1880s was unsuccessful because of these diseases, forcing the abandonment of the project in 1889. During the American effort to construct the canal in the early 1900s, William C. Gorgas, the Chief Sanitary Officer of Havana, was tasked with overseeing the health of the workers. He had past success in eradicating the disease in Florida and Havana by reducing mosquito populations through draining nearby pools of water, cutting grass, applying oil to the edges of ponds and swamps to kill larvae, and capturing adult mosquitoes that remained indoors during the daytime. Joseph Augustin LePrince, the Chief Sanitary Inspector of the Canal Zone, invented the first commercial larvicide, a mixture of carbolic acid, resin, and caustic soda, to be used throughout the Canal Zone. The combined implementation of these sanitation measures led to a dramatic decline in the number of workers dying and the eventual eradication of yellow fever in the Canal Zone as well as the containment of malaria during the 10-year construction period. Because of the success of these methods at preventing disease, they were adopted and improved upon in other regions of the world.

<doc id="461411" wikidata="Q685997" url="?curid=461411" title="DFS 346">
<text>The DFS 346 (&quot;Samolyot 346&quot;) was a German rocket-powered swept-wing aircraft which began development during World War II in Germany. It was designed by Felix Kracht at the &quot;Deutsche Forschungsanstalt für Segelflug&quot; (DFS), the &quot;German Institute for Sailplane Flight&quot;. A prototype was constructed but did not reach completion before the end of the war. It was taken to the Soviet Union where it was completed, tested and flown (with indifferent success).

==Design==
The DFS-346 was a midwing design of all-metal construction. The front fuselage of the 346 was a body of rotation based on the NACA-Profile 0012-0,66-50. The middle part was approximately cylindrical and narrowed to the cut off to accommodate vertically arrayed nozzles in back. Probably for volume and weight reasons the DFS-346 was equipped with landing skids, both in the original German design and in the later Soviet prototypes; this caused trouble several times.

The wings had a 45° swept NACA 0012-0,55-1,25 profile of 12% thickness. The continuously varying profile shape caused a stall in certain flight conditions, which caused complete loss of control. This was later corrected by use of fences on the top of the wings.

==Development==

===Concept===
The DFS 346 was a parallel project to the DFS 228 high-altitude reconnaissance aircraft, designed under the direction of Felix Kracht and his team at DFS. While the DFS 228 was essentially of conventional sailplane design, the DFS 346 had highly-swept wings and a highly streamlined fuselage that its designers hoped would enable it to break the sound barrier.

Like its stablemate, it also featured a self-contained escape module for the pilot, a feature originally designed for the DFS 54 prior to the war. The pilot was to fly the machine from a prone position, a feature decided from experience with the first DFS 228 prototype. This was mainly because of the smaller cross-sectional area and easier sealing of the pressurized cabin, but it was also known to help with g-force handling.

The 346 design was intended to be air-launched from the back of a large mother ship aircraft for air launch, the carrier aircraft being the Dornier Do 217. After launch, the pilot would fire the 346&#x27;s Walter 509B/C twin-chamber &quot;cruiser&quot; engine to accelerate to a proposed speed of Mach2.6 and altitude of 30,500 meters (100,000 ft). This engine had two chambers — the main, upper &quot;Hauptofen&quot; combustion chamber as used on the earlier HWK 509A motor; but capable of just over two short tons (4,410 lbf) of thrust at full power (more at altitude), and the lower-thrust &quot;Marschofen&quot; throttleable chamber below the main unit of either 300 kg (B-version) or 400 kg (C-version) top thrust levels mounted beneath the main chamber. After reaching altitude, the speed could be maintained by short bursts of the lower &quot;Marschofen&quot; cruise chamber. The question of what rocket-motor subtype was to be used (the 509B or -C) is not adequately addressed here.

In an operational use the plane would then glide over England for a photo-reconnaissance run, descending as it flew but still at a high speed. After the run was complete the engine would be briefly turned on again, to raise the altitude for a long low-speed glide back to a base in Germany or northern France.

===Prototype construction===
Since the aircraft was to be of all-metal construction, the DFS lacked the facilities to build it and construction of the prototype was assigned to Siebel Werke located in Halle, where the first windtunnel models and partially built prototype were captured by the advancing Red Army.

===Post-War===
On 22 October 1946, the Soviet OKB-2 (Design Bureau 2), under the direction of Hans Rössing and Alexandr Bereznyak, was tasked with continuing its development.
The captured DFS 346, now simply called &quot;Samolyot 346&quot; (&quot;samolyot&quot; means &quot;airplane&quot;) to distance it from its German origins, was completed and tested in TsAGI wind tunnel T-101. Tests revealed some aerodynamic deficiencies which would result in unrecoverable stalls at certain angles of attack. This phenomenon involved a loss of longitudinal stability of the airframe. After the wind tunnel tests, two wing fences were installed on a more advanced, longer version of the DFS-346, the purpose of fences was to interrupt the spanwise movement of airflow that would otherwise bring the boundary-layer breakdown and transition from attached to stalled airflow with loss of lift and increase of drag.

This solution was used on the majority of Soviet planes with swept wings of the 1950s and 1960s. In the meantime, the escape capsule system was tested from a B-25J and proved promising. Despite results from studies showing that the plane would not have been able to pass even Mach 1, orders were given to proceed with construction and further testing.

==Operational use==
In 1947, an entirely new 346 prototype was constructed, incorporating refinements suggested by the tests. This was designated 346-P (&quot;P&quot; for &quot;planer&quot; - &quot;glider&quot;). No provision was made for a powerplant, but ballast was added to simulate the weight of an engine and fuel. This was carried to altitude by a B-29 Superfortress captured in Vladivostok and successfully flown by Wolfgang Ziese in a series of tests. This led to the construction of three more prototypes, intended to lead to powered flight of the type.

===First accidents===

Newly built 346-1 incorporated minor aerodynamic refinements over the 346-P, and was first flown by Ziese on September 30, 1948, with dummy engines installed. The glider was released at an altitude of 9700 m, and the pilot realised that he hardly could maintain control of the aircraft. Consequently, while attempting to land, he descended too fast (his speed was later estimated at 310 km/h). After first touching the ground he bounced up to a height of 3–4 m and flew 700–800 m. At the second descent, the landing ski collapsed and the fuselage hit the ground hard.

The pilot seat structure and safety-belt proved to be very unreliable, because at the end of a rough braking course Ziese was thrown forward and struck the canopy with his head, losing consciousness. Luckily, he wasn&#x27;t seriously injured, and after treatment in hospital he was able to return to flying. Accident investigation research team came to the conclusion that the crash was a result of pilot error, who failed to fully release the landing skid. This accident showed that the aircraft handling was still very unpredictable, as a result, all rocket-powered flights were postponed until pilots were able to effectively control the aircraft in unpowered descent, requiring further glide flights.

The damaged 346-1 was later repaired and modified to 346-2 version. It was successfully flown by test pilot P. Kazmin in 1950-1951 winter, but nonetheless these flights also ended &quot;on fuselage&quot;. Furthermore, after the last flight of these series, the airframe again required major repairs. On 10 May 1951, Ziese returned to the program, flying final unpowered test flights with the 346-2, and from 6 June, unpowered tests of the 346-3 without accidents.

===Final flights===
By the mid-1951 346-3 was completed, and Ziese flew it under power for the first time on 13 August 1951, using only one of the engines. Continuing concerns about the aircraft&#x27;s stability at high speeds had led to a VNE limit of Mach0.9 being placed during test flights. Ziese flew it again on 2 September and 14 September. On this last flight, however, things went drastically wrong. Separating from the carrier plane at 9,300 meters (30,500 ft) above Lukovici airfield, the pilot fired the engine and accelerated to a speed of 900 km/h (560 mph). The rocket engine worked as expected, and 346-3, quickly accelerating, started ascending and soon had flown in very close proximity of its carrier aircraft.

Ziese then reported that the plane was not responding to the controls, and was losing altitude. Ground control commanded him to bail out. He used the escape capsule to leave the stricken aircraft at 6,500 meters (21,000 ft) and landed safely by parachute. With the loss of this aircraft, the 346 program was abandoned.

==Variants==
* DFS-346 - First prototype built by Siebel Werke in the early 1940s. Later taken to USSR where the newly formed OKB-2 tested it in TsAGI wind tunnel. Later scrapped, because it was not flyable.
* 346-P - This airframe was first post-war build of this plane, and was completed in 1948 by German engineers. Visually 346-P was identical to the earlier design, excepting a landing gear cowl which was removed primarily for lightening the airframe. This prototype also featured mounted under wing supports, to help stop the plane when landed.
* 346-1(A) - On 5 May 1949, construction of 346-1 was finished. It had a rocket engine mock up installed, and incorporated some minor changes in the rudder and tail design.
* 346-2(D) - The same as 346-1, but the rocket engines fitted.
* 346-3 - Only plane that flew rocket-engine powered, and twice went transonic.

<text>Peripeteia (alternative Latin form: Peripetīa, ultimately from ) is a reversal of circumstances, or turning point. The term is primarily used with reference to works of literature; its anglicized form is peripety.

==Aristotle&#x27;s view==
Aristotle, in his &quot;Poetics&quot;, defines peripeteia as &quot;a change by which the action veers round to its opposite, subject always to our rule of probability or necessity.&quot; According to Aristotle, peripeteia, along with discovery, is the most effective when it comes to drama, particularly in a tragedy. He wrote that &quot;The finest form of Discovery is one attended by Peripeteia, like that which goes with the Discovery in Oedipus...&quot;.

Aristotle says that peripeteia is the most powerful part of a plot in a tragedy along with discovery (anagnorisis). A peripety is the change of the kind described from one state of things within the play to its opposite, and that too in the way we are saying, in the probable or necessary sequence of events. There is often no element like Peripeteia; it can bring forth or result in terror, mercy, or in comedies it can bring a smile or it can bring forth tears (Rizo). 

This is the best way to spark and maintain attention throughout the various form and genres of drama &quot;Tragedy imitates good actions and, thereby, measures and depicts the well-being of its protagonist. But in his formal definition, as well as throughout the Poetics, Aristotle emphasizes that&quot; ... Tragedy is an imitation not only of a complete action, but also of events inspiring fear or pity&quot; (1452a 1); in fact, at one point Aristotle isolates the imitation of &quot;actions that excite pity and fear&quot; as &quot;the distinctive mark of tragic imitation&quot; (1452b 30). 

Pity and fear are effected through reversal and recognition; and these &quot;most powerful elements of emotional interest in Tragedy-Peripeteia or Reversal of the Situation, and recognition scenes-are parts of the plot (1450a 32). has the shift of the tragic protagonist&#x27;s fortune from good to bad, which is essential to the plot of a tragedy. It is often an ironic twist. Good uses of Peripeteia are those that especially are parts of a complex plot, so that they are defined by their changes of fortune being accompanied by reversal, recognition, or both&quot; (Smithson).

Peripeteia includes changes of character, but also more external changes. A character who becomes rich and famous from poverty and obscurity has undergone peripeteia, even if his character remains the same.

When a character learns something he had been previously ignorant of, this is normally distinguished from peripeteia as anagnorisis or discovery, a distinction derived from Aristotle&#x27;s work.

Aristotle considers anagnorisis, leading to peripeteia, the mark of a superior tragedy. Two such plays are &quot;Oedipus Rex&quot;, where the oracle&#x27;s information that Oedipus has killed his father and married his mother brings about his mother&#x27;s death and his own blindness and exile, and &quot;Iphigenia in Tauris&quot;, where Iphigenia realizes that the strangers she is to sacrifice are her brother and his friend, resulting in all three of them escaping Tauris. These plots he considered complex and superior to simple plots without anagnorisis or peripeteia, such as when Medea resolves to kill her children, knows they are her children, and does so. Aristotle identified &quot;Oedipus Rex&quot; as the principal work demonstrating peripety. (See Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;Poetics&quot;.)

==Examples==
===&quot;Oedipus Rex&quot;===
In Sophocles&#x27; &quot;Oedipus Rex&quot;, the peripeteia occurs towards the end of the play when the Messenger brings Oedipus news of his parentage. In the play, Oedipus is fated to murder his father and marry his mother. His parents, Laius and Jocasta, try to forestall the oracle by sending their son away to be killed, but he is actually raised by Polybus and his wife, Merope, the rulers of another kingdom. The irony of the Messenger’s information is that it was supposed to comfort Oedipus and assure him that he was the son of Polybus. Unfortunately for Oedipus, the Messenger says, &quot;Polybus was nothing to you, [Oedipus] that’s why, not in blood&quot; (Sophocles 1113). 

The Messenger received Oedipus from one of Laius’ servants and then gave him to Polybus. The plot comes together when Oedipus realizes that he is the son and murderer of Laius as well as the son and husband of Jocasta. Martin M. Winkler says that here, peripeteia and anagnorisis occur at the same time &quot;for the greatest possible impact&quot; because Oedipus has been &quot;struck a blow from above, as if by fate or the gods. He is changing from the mighty and somewhat arrogant king of Thebes to a figure of woe&quot; (Winkler 57).

===Conversion of Paul on the road to Damascus===

The instantaneous conversion of Paul on the road to Damascus is a classic example of &quot;peripeteia&quot;, which Eusebius presented in his &quot;Life of Constantine&quot; as a pattern for the equally revelatory conversion of Constantine. Modern biographers of Constantine see his conversion less as a momentary phenomenon than as a step in a lifelong process.

===The Three Apples===
In &quot;The Three Apples&quot;, a medieval &quot;Arabian Nights&quot;, after the murderer reveals himself near the middle of the story, he explains his reasons behind the murder in a flashback, which begins with him going on a journey to find three rare apples for his wife, but after returning finds out she cannot eat them due to her lingering illness. Later at work, he sees a slave passing by with one of those apples claiming that he received it from his girlfriend, a married woman with three such apples her husband gave her. He returns home and demands his wife to show him all three apples, but she only shows him two. This convinces him of her infidelity and he murders her as a result. After he disposes of her body, he returns home, where his son confesses that he had stolen one of the apples and that a slave, to whom he had told about his father&#x27;s journey, had fled with it. The murderer thus realizes his guilt and regrets what he has just done.

The second use of peripety occurs near the end. After finding out about the culprit behind the murder, the protagonist Ja&#x27;far ibn Yahya is ordered by Harun al-Rashid to find the tricky slave within three days, or else he will have Ja&#x27;far executed instead. After the deadline has passed, Ja&#x27;far prepares to be executed for his failure and bids his family farewell. As he hugs his youngest daughter, he feels a round object in her pocket, which is revealed to be the same apple that the culprit was holding. In the story&#x27;s twist ending, the daughter reveals that she obtained it from their slave, Rayhan. Ja&#x27;far thus realizes that his own slave was the culprit all along. He then finds Rayhan and solves the case, preventing his own execution. That was a plot twist.

<doc id="461419" wikidata="Q5262628" url="?curid=461419" title="Derived row">
<text>In music using the twelve-tone technique, derivation is the construction of a row through segments. A derived row is a tone row whose entirety of twelve tones is constructed from a segment or portion of the whole, the generator. Anton Webern often used derived rows in his pieces. A partition is a segment created from a set through partitioning.

==Derivation==
Rows may be derived from a sub-set of any number of pitch classes that is a divisor of 12, the most common being the first three pitches or a trichord. This segment may then undergo transposition, inversion, retrograde, or any combination to produce the other parts of the row (in this case, the other three segments).

One of the side effects of derived rows is invariance. For example, since a segment may be equivalent to the generating segment inverted and transposed, say, 6 semitones, when the entire row is inverted and transposed six semitones the generating segment will now consist of the pitch classes of the derived segment.

Here is a row derived from a trichord taken from Webern&#x27;s Concerto, Op. 24:

:&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot; lang=&quot;lilypond&quot;&gt;
\override Score.TimeSignature
#&#x27;stencil = ##f
\override Score.SpacingSpanner.strict-note-spacing = ##t
 \set Score.proportionalNotationDuration = #(ly:make-moment 3/2)
 \relative c&quot; {
 \time 3/1
 \set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t \tempo 1 = 60
 b1 bes d
 es, g fis
 aes e f
 c&#x27; cis a
}
&lt;/score&gt;


P represents the original trichord, RI, retrograde and inversion, R retrograde, and I inversion.

The entire row, if B=0, is:
*0, 11, 3, 4, 8, 7, 9, 5, 6, 1, 2, 10.
For instance, the third trichord:
*9, 5, 6
is the first trichord:
*0, 11, 3
backwards:
*3, 11, 0
and transposed 6
*3+6, 11+6, 0+6 = 9, 5, 6 mod 12.

Combinatoriality is often a result of derived rows. For example, the Op. 24 row is all-combinatorial, P0 being hexachordally combinatorial with P6, R0, I5, and RI11.

==Partition and mosaic==
The opposite is partitioning, the use of methods to create segments from entire sets, most often through registral difference.

In music using the twelve-tone technique a partition is &quot;a collection of disjunct, unordered pitch-class sets that comprise an aggregate&quot;. It is a method of creating segments from sets, most often through registral difference, the opposite of derivation used in derived rows.

More generally, in musical set theory partitioning is the division of the domain of pitch class sets into types, such as transpositional type, see equivalence class and cardinality.

Partition is also an old name for types of compositions in several parts; there is no fixed meaning, and in several cases the term was reportedly interchanged with various other terms.

A cross-partition is, &quot;a two-dimensional configuration of pitch classes whose columns are realized as chords, and whose rows are differentiated from one another by registral, timbral, or other means.&quot; This allows, &quot;&quot;slot-machine&quot; transformations that reorder the vertical trichords but keep the pitch classes in their columns.&quot;

A mosaic is &quot;a partition that divides the aggregate into segments of equal size&quot;, according to Martino (1961). &quot;Kurth 1992 and Mead 1988 use &quot;mosaic&quot; and &quot;mosaic class&quot; in the way that I use &quot;partition&quot; and &quot;mosaic&quot;&quot;, are used here. However later, he says that, &quot;the DS determines the number of distinct partitions in a &quot;mosaic&quot;, which is the set of partitions related by transposition and inversion.&quot;

===Inventory===
The first useful characteristic of a partition, an inventory, is the set classes produced by the union of the constituent pitch class sets of a partition. For trichords and hexachords combined see Alegant 1993, Babbitt 1955, Dubiel 1990, Mead 1994, Morris and Alegant 1988, Morris 1987, and Rouse 1985.

===Degree of symmetry===
The second useful characteristic of a partition, the degree of symmetry (DS), &quot;specifies the number of operations that preserve the unordered pcsets of a partition; it tells the extent to which that partition&#x27;s pitch-class sets map into (or onto) each other under transposition or inversion.&quot;

<doc id="461423" wikidata="Q281936" url="?curid=461423" title="Our Friends in the North">
<text>Our Friends in the North is a British television drama serial produced by the BBC. It was originally broadcast in nine episodes on BBC2 in early 1996. Written by Peter Flannery, it tells the story of four friends from Newcastle upon Tyne over a period of 31 years, from 1964 to 1995. The story makes reference to certain political and social events which occurred during the era portrayed, some specific to Newcastle and others which affected Britain as a whole. These include general elections, police and local government corruption, the UK miners&#x27; strike of 1984–1985, and the Great Storm of 1987.

The serial is commonly regarded as one of the most successful BBC television dramas of the 1990s, described by &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; as &quot;a production where all ... worked to serve a writer&#x27;s vision. We are not likely to look upon its like again&quot;. It has been named by the British Film Institute as one of the 100 Greatest British Television Programmes of the 20th century, by &quot;The Guardian&quot; as the third greatest television drama of all time and by &quot;Radio Times&quot; as one of the 40 greatest television programmes. It was awarded three British Academy Television Awards (BAFTAs), two Royal Television Society Awards, four Broadcasting Press Guild Awards, and a Certificate of Merit from the San Francisco International Film Festival.

&quot;Our Friends in the North&quot; helped to establish the careers of its four lead actors, Daniel Craig, Christopher Eccleston, Gina McKee and Mark Strong. Daniel Craig&#x27;s part in particular has been referred to as his breakthrough role. It was also a controversial production, as its stories were partly based on real people and events. Several years passed before it was adapted from a play, performed by the Royal Shakespeare Company, to a television drama, owing in part to the BBC&#x27;s fear of legal action.

In February 2022, it was announced that Flannery had rewritten &quot;Our Friends in the North&quot; for BBC Radio 4 and that it would feature a new, tenth episode written by Adam Usden that was set in Newcastle in 2020. It features James Baxter, Norah Lopez Holden, Philip Correia and Luke MacGregor in the respective roles of Nicky, Mary, Tosker and Geordie, and began 17 March 2022.

==Plot==
In 1964 twenty-year-old university student Nicky Hutchinson (Christopher Eccleston) returns to Newcastle after volunteering for the summer in the U.S. civil rights movement. His friends Geordie (Daniel Craig) and Tosker (Mark Strong) are eager to start a band but Nicky rebuffs them as he is occupied with his volunteering work.

Nicky&#x27;s girlfriend, Mary (Gina McKee), is also unhappy with his lack of attention and they drift apart. Tosker takes advantage of the situation and successfully woos Mary, getting her pregnant. Nicky is offered a job working for Austin Donohue (Alun Armstrong), a former council leader who is starting a PR and lobbying firm.

Nicky is impressed by Austin&#x27;s apparent passion for change and he drops out of university to accept the job, to the dismay of his working-class father, Felix (Peter Vaughan). Geordie gets into a fight with his abusive, alcoholic father and runs away from home, abandoning his pregnant fiancée.

Now living in London, Geordie accepts a job offer from sleazy crime boss Benny Barratt (Malcolm McDowell) and begins working as his assistant in the Soho sex industry. Meanwhile Mary and Tosker struggle to adapt to their new married life. Their high-rise council flat, despite being brand new, is plagued by structural issues including rampant damp. Nicky is dismayed that Austin&#x27;s firm is representing John Edwards, the owner of the company responsible for the sub-standard flats. After discovering records of the extensive bribery that took place in the project&#x27;s development, Nicky resigns in protest. Austin later receives four years in prison for his involvement and Edwards is declared bankrupt. Tosker&#x27;s dreams of becoming a professional musician rapidly fade after a brutal audition with a local talent scout. Dejected, he continues to do menial jobs to make ends meet. After visiting Geordie in London, he is given a loan from Benny and starts his own grocery business. Around this time, Geordie starts an affair with Benny&#x27;s girlfriend, Julia.

Working as a photo journalist in London, Nicky&#x27;s ideologies become extreme to the point he joins an anarchist terrorist cell. While lying low in Newcastle he is confronted by his parents and family friend, Eddie Wells (David Bradley), after his mother, Florrie (Freda Dowie), finds a submachinegun in his room. Despite his insistence he is in the right, his anarchist activities are brought to a sudden halt when the cell&#x27;s hideout is raided by the police and everyone but him is arrested. Later Eddie runs as an independent Labour candidate in a Westminster by-election, after Felix agrees to be his campaign agent. Owing to Nicky&#x27;s past ties to extremism, Eddie rejects his support, narrowly winning the seat nevertheless. Nicky eventually returns to mainstream politics in Newcastle and becomes a Labour parliamentary candidate himself. However, despite running in a safe Labour constituency and receiving an endorsement from Eddie, he manages to lose the seat to the Conservatives after a smear campaign depicts him as an IRA sympathiser.

In London the situation gets progressively more difficult for Benny&#x27;s businesses as continued pressure from the Metropolitan Police (Met) Commissioner Colin Blamire (Peter Jeffrey) forces the heavily corrupt vice (&quot;dirty&quot;) squad to reluctantly act. Meanwhile, tired of being repeatedly blackmailed by the dirty squad, one of Benny&#x27;s men takes evidence of Met corruption to the Sunday papers and the resulting scandal forces the government to hold an independent inquiry. Roy Johnson (Tony Haygarth) is brought in from Newcastle as an outsider to run the investigation but is obstructed at every turn by Blamire, dirty squad Commander Harold Chapple (Donald Sumpter) and his henchman John Salway (David Schofield). Despite the setbacks, Johnson is able to present a report to the Home Secretary detailing extensive Met corruption. Blamire, however, is able to leverage a separate investigation into the Home Secretary&#x27;s past business dealings to blackmail him into suppressing the inquiry findings. A disheartened Johnson returns to Newcastle to take early retirement. With the inquiry behind them, Benny and the dirty squad are free to reach new lucrative arrangements. Benny also has Geordie framed and imprisoned in revenge for the affair with Julia years before. Subsequent police investigations eventually bring down Chapple, Salway and many other corrupt Met officers.

Some years later Tosker is now a moderately successful businessman and Mary is occupied with her advocacy work. After Tosker&#x27;s repeated infidelity, their marriage breaks down and he moves out to live with his new girlfriend, Elaine (Tracey Wilkinson). Nicky and Mary briefly reunite, but she is hesitant to resume their relationship out of concern for her young children. Out of prison and back living in Newcastle, Geordie is devastated to learn that Julia has been killed in an apparent accident. He aggressively questions Benny over her death but accepts Benny&#x27;s argument that he had no motive to kill her. Eventually Geordie&#x27;s casual drug dealing gets him in trouble with the law again and he departs for London a second time.

In 1984 Nicky is covering the ongoing miners&#x27; strike. After being injured in a brawl between the police and the miners, he rekindles his relationship with Mary. Tosker meanwhile has made his fortune as a slum landlord, straining his marriage with Elaine. At her urging, he sells the properties and invests heavily in stocks, which are subsequently wiped out in the 1987 market crash. Three years later, Nicky is struggling with his marriage to Mary and also with his father Felix who has been diagnosed with Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. While in London, he needlessly picks a fight with Eddie Wells and starts an affair with a young student, Alice. He eventually separates from Mary to pursue Alice but by then she is not interested in a serious relationship. Geordie, who is now an alcoholic and living at a homeless shelter, sets fire to his bed in a moment of madness. Quickly apprehended, he is deemed a danger to society and is stunned when the judge sentences him to life in prison. Nicky reconciles with Eddie after he discovers Eddie&#x27;s assistant is a mole for a PR company. Eddie resigns in embarrassment but as he is leaving Westminster he is caught up in the Great Storm of 1987 and dies of a heart attack. The storm also presents Geordie an opportunity to escape his prison transport but he chooses not to take it. In Newcastle, Mary initially refuses to run in the by-election for Eddie&#x27;s seat but eventually changes her mind and is subsequently elected. Exasperated at Felix&#x27;s increasingly outlandish behaviour, Florrie can no longer cope and she sends him to a care home.

Seven years later in 1995, Nicky has been living in Italy and returns to Newcastle to attend Florrie&#x27;s funeral. Tosker and Elaine have slowly rebuilt their business and are on the eve of opening a new floating nightclub. Geordie has escaped from prison and approaches the club looking for work, where he is recognised by Elaine. Although Tosker and Elaine privately do not believe his story that he is out on parole, they take him in and give him a job playing keyboards for the opening night band. Nicky desperately tries to convince Felix that his life, in particular the Jarrow March, was not a failure, but Felix&#x27;s mind is too far gone to understand. Geordie tries to attend the club launch event but is refused entry due to a miscommunication with the bouncers. Tosker fills in for the band at the last minute and finally achieves his dream of musical stardom, albeit on a small scale. The four friends reunite at Florrie&#x27;s funeral for the first time for 31 years. Afterwards Tosker spends time with his grandchildren, Nicky decides to try and patch things up with Mary and Geordie walks off to an unknown fate.

==Episodes==
==Background==

===Stage play===
&quot;Our Friends in the North&quot; was originally written by the playwright Peter Flannery for the theatre, while he was a writer in residence for the Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC). The idea came to Flannery while he was watching the rehearsals for the company&#x27;s production of &quot;Henry IV, Part 1&quot; and &quot;Part 2&quot; at Stratford-upon-Avon in 1980; the scale of the plays inspired him to come up with his own historical epic. The original three-hour long theatre version of &quot;Our Friends in the North&quot;, directed by John Caird and featuring Jim Broadbent and Roger Allam among the cast, was produced by the RSC in 1982. It initially ran for a week at The Other Place in Stratford before touring to the city in which it was set, Newcastle upon Tyne, and then playing at The Pit, a studio theatre in the Barbican Centre in London.

In its original form the story went up only to the 1979 general election and the coming to power of the new Conservative government under Margaret Thatcher. The play also contained a significant number of scenes set in Rhodesia, chronicling UDI, the oil embargo and the emergence of armed resistance to white supremacy. This plot strand was dropped from the televised version, although the title &quot;Our Friends in the North&quot;, a reference to how staff at BP in South Africa referred to the Rhodesian government of Ian Smith, remained.

Flannery was heavily influenced not only by his own political viewpoints and life experiences but also by the actual history of his home city of Newcastle during the 1960s and 1970s. Characters such as Austin Donohue and John Edwards were directly based on the real-life scandals of T. Dan Smith and John Poulson. Flannery contacted Smith and explained that he was going to write a play based on the events of the scandal, to which Smith replied, &quot;There is a play here of Shakespearean proportions.&quot;

===1980s attempts at production===
The stage version of &quot;Our Friends in the North&quot; was seen by BBC television drama producer Michael Wearing in Newcastle in 1982, and he was immediately keen on producing a television adaptation. At that time, Wearing was based at the BBC English Regions Drama Department at BBC Pebble Mill in Birmingham, which had a specific remit for making &quot;regional drama&quot;. Wearing initially approached Flannery to adapt his play into a four-part television serial for BBC2, with each episode being 50 minutes long and the Rhodesian strand dropped for practical reasons. A change of executives meant that the project was not produced, although Wearing persisted in trying to get it commissioned. Flannery extended the serial to six episodes, one for each United Kingdom general election from 1964 to 1979. However, by this point in the mid-1980s, Michael Grade was Director of Programmes for BBC Television, and he had no interest in the project.

By 1989, Wearing had been recalled to the central BBC drama department in London where he was made Head of Serials. This new seniority eventually allowed him to further the cause of &quot;Our Friends in the North&quot;. Flannery wrote to the BBC&#x27;s then managing director of television, Will Wyatt, &quot;accusing him of cowardice for not approving it.&quot; The BBC was concerned not only with the budget and resources that would be required to produce the serial, but also with potential legal issues. Much of the background story was based on real-life events and people, such as Smith and Poulson and former Home Secretary Reginald Maudling, upon whom another character, Claud Seabrook, was based. According to &quot;The Observer&quot; newspaper, one senior BBC lawyer, Glen Del Medico, even threatened to resign if the production was made. Others tried to persuade Flannery to reset the piece &quot;in a fictional country called Albion rather than Britain.&quot; Both Smith and Poulson died before the programme aired. The character of Benny Barratt was based on the pornographer James Humphreys.

===Pre-production===
In 1992, Wearing was able to persuade the controller of BBC Two, Alan Yentob, to commission Peter Flannery to write scripts for a new version of the project. Yentob had no great enthusiasm for &quot;Our Friends in the North&quot;, as he remembered a meeting with Flannery in 1988, when the writer had left him unimpressed by stating that &quot;Our Friends in the North&quot; was about &quot;post-war social housing policy&quot;. As Wearing was now a head of department at the BBC, he was too busy overseeing other projects to produce &quot;Our Friends in the North&quot;. George Faber was briefly attached to the project as producer before he moved on to become Head of Single Drama at the BBC. Faber was succeeded by a young producer with great enthusiasm for the project, Charles Pattinson.

When Yentob was succeeded as controller of BBC Two by Michael Jackson, Pattinson was able to persuade him to commission full production on the series. This was in spite of the fact that Jackson and Wearing were not close and did not get on; Pattinson took to dealing with Jackson directly. Jackson had agreed to nine one-hour episodes but Flannery protested that each episode should be as long as it needed to be, to which Jackson agreed. The long delay in production did have the advantage of allowing Flannery to extend the story and instead of ending in 1979, it carried on into the 1990s, bringing the four central characters into middle age. Flannery later commented that: &quot;The project has undoubtedly benefited from the delay. I&#x27;m not sure I have&quot;. The series encountered more legal problems, when some references to the fictional businessman Alan Roe were removed, because of a perceived similarity to Sir John Hall, a Newcastle businessman who had a number of things in common. The drama had originally shown Roe as taking advantage of tax subsidies to build a large shopping centre.

==Production and broadcast==
The scale of &quot;Our Friends in the North&quot; required BBC Two controller Michael Jackson to devote a budget of £8 million to the production, which was half of his channel&#x27;s drama serials budget for the entire year. Producer Charles Pattinson attempted to gain co-production funding from overseas broadcasters, but met with a lack of interest. Pattinson believed it was because the story was so much about Britain and had limited appeal to other countries. BBC Worldwide, the corporation&#x27;s commercial arm which sold its programmes overseas, offered only £20,000 of funding towards the production. The speaking cast of &quot;Our Friends in the North&quot; numbered 160; more than 3,000 extras were used, and filming took place across 40 weeks, from November 1994 until September 1995.

===Directors===
The first director approached to helm the production by Michael Wearing was Danny Boyle. Boyle was keen to direct all nine episodes, but Pattinson believed that one director taking charge of the entire serial would be too punishing a schedule for whoever was chosen. Boyle had recently completed work on the feature film &quot;Shallow Grave&quot; and wanted to see how that film was received before committing to &quot;Our Friends in the North&quot;. When &quot;Shallow Grave&quot; proved to be a critical success, Boyle was able to enter pre-production on &quot;Trainspotting&quot;. He withdrew from &quot;Our Friends in the North&quot;. Sir Peter Hall was also briefly considered, but he too had other production commitments.

Two directors were finally chosen to helm the project. Stuart Urban was assigned the first five episodes and Simon Cellan Jones the final four. However, after completing the first two episodes and some of the shooting for the third, Urban left the project after disagreements with the production team. Peter Flannery was concerned that Urban&#x27;s directorial style was not suited to the material that he had written. Christopher Eccleston&#x27;s viewpoint is that Urban was &quot;only interested in painting pretty pictures.&quot; Pattinson agreed that a change was needed, and Michael Jackson agreed to a change of director mid-way through production, which was unusual for a British television drama of this type so far into proceedings. Director Pedr James, who had recently directed an adaptation of &quot;Martin Chuzzlewit&quot; for Michael Wearing&#x27;s department, was hired to shoot the remainder of what were to have been Urban&#x27;s episodes.

===Casting===
Of the actors cast in the four leading roles, only Gina McKee was a native of North East England, and she was from Sunderland rather than from Newcastle. McKee related strongly to many of the characters and story elements in the scripts and was very keen to play Mary, but the production team was initially uncertain whether it would be possible to age her up convincingly enough to portray the character in her 50s. McKee was concerned that she would not be given the part after an unsuccessful makeup test where efforts to make her appear to be in her 50s resulted in her resembling a drag queen.

Christopher Eccleston was the only one of the four lead actors who was already an established television face, having previously co-starred in the ITV crime drama series &quot;Cracker&quot;. Eccleston first heard about the project while working with Danny Boyle on the film &quot;Shallow Grave&quot; in the autumn of 1993. Initially, Eccleston had been considered by the production team as a candidate to play Geordie, but he was more interested in playing Nicky, whom he saw as a more emotionally complex character. Eccleston was particularly concerned about being able to perform with the Newcastle Geordie accent. He did not even attempt the accent at his audition, concentrating instead on characterisation. He drew inspiration for his performance as the older Nicky from Peter Flannery, basing aspects of his characterisation on Flannery&#x27;s personality. He even wore some of the writer&#x27;s colourful shirts.

Daniel Craig was auditioned late for the role of Geordie. At the audition he performed the Geordie accent very poorly but won the part, which came to be regarded as his breakthrough role. Mark Strong worked on the Geordie accent by studying episodes of the 1980s comedy series &quot;Auf Wiedersehen, Pet&quot;, which featured lead characters from Newcastle. Strong later claimed that Christopher Eccleston took a dislike to him and outside of their scenes together the pair did not speak while the series was filming.

Among the supporting roles, one of the highest-profile pieces of casting was Malcolm McDowell as Soho porn baron Benny Barratt. Barratt appears in scenes in episodes from &quot;1966&quot; to &quot;1979&quot; but the production could only afford him for three weeks. This was because McDowell was then a resident of the United States. All of McDowell&#x27;s scenes were shot by Stuart Urban as part of the first block of filming; the rest of the production was filmed roughly chronologically. This was considered more than worthwhile, however, for the prestige of being able to use an actor such as McDowell, predominantly a film actor who seldom did television work.

Daniel Craig&#x27;s performance would first bring him to the attention of producer Barbara Broccoli, who later cast him in the role of secret agent James Bond in the long-running film series. Christopher Eccleston also went on to achieve success as a long-running, well-known fictional character when he appeared as the Ninth Doctor in the BBC science-fiction series &quot;Doctor Who&quot; in 2005. Since then various media articles have noted the coincidence of the future James Bond and &quot;Doctor Who&quot; leads having co-starred in the same production earlier in their careers.

===Episode one re-shoot===
After Stuart Urban left the production and the decision had been made to re-shoot some of the material that he had completed with Pedr James directing, producer Charles Pattinson suggested to Peter Flannery that the first episode should not simply be remade, but also rewritten. Flannery took the opportunity to completely change the opening storyline, introducing the love story element between Nicky and Mary earlier. This was introduced in later episodes of the television version, but had not been part of the original play. Other storyline and character changes were made with the new version of the first episode because it was the script that had most closely resembled the original stage play. Michael Wearing felt that the story could be expanded to a greater degree for television.

Production of the new version of the opening episode took place in what was to have been a three-week break for the cast between production blocks. Gina McKee was initially very concerned about having her character&#x27;s early life story changed when she had already based elements of her later performance on the previously established version. Eccleston was also unhappy about the sudden changes. However, McKee felt that the new version of episode one eventually made for a much stronger opening to the story.

Due to budgetary constraints, it was not possible to re-shoot some scenes of episode one in the north-east, and they instead had to be filmed in and around Watford. Beach-set scenes were shot at Folkestone rather than Whitley Bay, which was obvious to locals on screen due to the presence of pebbles on the beach, which are not present at Whitley Bay. This led to some critics mockingly referring to the production as &quot;Our Friends in the South&quot;.

===Music===
Contemporary popular music was used throughout the production to evoke the feel of the year in which each episode was set. The BBC&#x27;s existing agreements with various music publishers and record labels meant that the production team was easily able to obtain the rights to use most of the desired songs. A particular piece of synchronicity occurred in the final episode, &quot;1995&quot;, which Cellan Jones had decided to close with the song &quot;Don&#x27;t Look Back in Anger&quot; by Oasis from the album &quot;(What&#x27;s the Story) Morning Glory?&quot;. While &quot;Our Friends in the North&quot; was airing, it was released as a single and was at the top of the UK Singles Chart in the week of the final episode&#x27;s transmission.

===Broadcast===
&quot;Our Friends in the North&quot; was broadcast in nine episodes on BBC2 at 9pm on Monday nights, from 15 January to 11 March 1996. The episode lengths varied, with &quot;1966&quot; being the shortest at 63 minutes, 48 seconds and &quot;1987&quot; the longest at 74 minutes, 40 seconds. The total running time of the serial is 623 minutes.

The first episode of &quot;Our Friends in the North&quot; gained 5.1 million viewers on its original transmission. In terms of viewing figures, the series was BBC2&#x27;s most successful weekly drama until 2001.

==Reception==

===Critical response===

Both during and after its original transmission on BBC2, the serial was generally praised by the critics. Reviewing the first episode in &quot;The Observer&quot; newspaper, Ian Bell wrote: &quot;Flannery&#x27;s script is faultless; funny, chilling, evocative, spare, linguistically precise. The four young friends about to share 31 hellish years in the life of modern Britain are excellently played.&quot;

The conclusion of the serial in March brought similar praise. &quot;&quot;Our Friends in the North&quot; confounded the gloomier predictions about its content and proved that there was an audience for political material, provided that it found its way to the screen through lives imagined in emotional detail ... It will be remembered for an intimate sense of character, powerful enough to make you forgive its faults and stay loyal to the end,&quot; was the verdict of &quot;The Independent&quot; on the final episode. Writing in the same newspaper the following day, Jeffrey Richards added that &quot;Monday night&#x27;s final episode of &quot;Our Friends in the North&quot; has left many people bereft. The serial captivated much of the country, sketching a panoramic view of life in Britain from the sixties to the nineties ... At once sweeping and intimate, both moving and angry, simultaneously historical and contemporary, it has followed in the distinguished footsteps of BBC series such as &quot;Boys from the Blackstuff&quot;.&quot;

However, the response was not exclusively positive. In &quot;The Independent on Sunday&quot;, columnist Lucy Ellmann criticised both what she saw as the unchanging nature of the characters and Flannery&#x27;s concentration on friendship rather than family. &quot;What&#x27;s in the water there anyway? These are the youngest grandparents ever seen! Nothing has changed about them since &quot;1964&quot; except a few grey hairs ... It&#x27;s quite impressive that anything emotional could be salvaged from this nine-part hop, skip and jump through the years. In fact we still hardly know these people – zooming from one decade to the next has a distancing effect,&quot; she wrote of the former point. And of the latter, &quot;Peter Flannery seems to want to suggest that friendships are the only cure for a life blighted by deficient parents. But all that links this ill-matched foursome in the end is history and sentimentality. The emotional centre of the writing is still in family ties.&quot;

Michael Jackson, the BBC2 controller who had finally commissioned production of the serial, felt that even though it was successful, its social realist form was outdated. The academic Georgina Born, writing in 2004, also felt that although the serial had its strengths, it also contained &quot;involuntary marks of pastiche&quot; in its treatment of social realism. In contrast, the British Film Institute&#x27;s Screenonline website praises the serial for its realistic and un-clichéd depiction of life in the North East, stating that: &quot;Unlike many depictions of the North-East, it has fully rounded characters with authentic regional accents. It&#x27;s clearly a real place, not a generic &#x27;up North&#x27;.&quot;

===Awards and recognition===
At the British Academy Television Awards (BAFTAs) in 1997, &quot;Our Friends in the North&quot; won the award for Best Drama Serial, ahead of other nominees &quot;The Crow Road&quot;, &quot;The Fragile Heart&quot; and &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot;. At the same ceremony, Gina McKee won the Best Actress category. Both Christopher Eccleston and Peter Vaughan (who played Nicky&#x27;s father, Felix) were nominated for the Best Actor award for their performances in &quot;Our Friends in the North&quot;, but they lost to Nigel Hawthorne for his role in &quot;The Fragile Heart&quot;. Also at the 1997 BAFTAs, Peter Flannery was presented with the honorary Dennis Potter Award for his work on the serial. &quot;Our Friends in the North&quot; also gained BAFTA nominations for costume design, sound, and photography and lighting.

The Royal Television Society Awards covering the year 1996 saw &quot;Our Friends in the North&quot; win the Best Drama Serial category, and Peter Flannery was given the Writer&#x27;s Award. Peter Vaughan also gained another Best Actor nomination for his role as Felix. At the 1997 Broadcasting Press Guild Awards, &quot;Our Friends in the North&quot; won the categories for Best Drama Series or Serial, Best Actor (Eccleston), Best Actress (McKee) and the Writer&#x27;s Award for Peter Flannery.

In the United States, &quot;Our Friends in the North&quot; was awarded a Certificate of Merit in the Television Drama Miniseries category at the San Francisco International Film Festival in 1997.

In 2000, the British Film Institute conducted a poll of industry professionals to find the 100 Greatest British Television Programmes of the 20th century, with &quot;Our Friends in the North&quot; finishing in twenty-fifth position, eighth position out of the dramas featured on the list. The commentary for the &quot;Our Friends in the North&quot; entry on the BFI website described it as a &quot;powerful and evocative drama series ... The series impressed with its ambition, humanity and willingness to see the ambiguities beyond the rhetoric.&quot; The serial was also included in an alphabetical list of the 40 greatest TV shows published by the &quot;Radio Times&quot; magazine in August 2003, chosen by their television editor Alison Graham. In January 2010, the website of &quot;The Guardian&quot; newspaper produced a list of &quot;The top 50 TV dramas of all time,&quot; in which &quot;Our Friends in the North&quot; was ranked in third position.

==Legacy==
Following the success of &quot;Our Friends in the North&quot;, Flannery proposed a &quot;kind of prequel&quot; to the serial under the title of &quot;Our Friends in the South&quot;. This would have told the story of the Jarrow March. Although the BBC initially took up the project, it did not progress to script stage and was eventually abandoned.

&quot;Our Friends in the North&quot; was given a repeat run on BBC2 the year following its original broadcast, running on Saturday evenings from 19 July to 13 September 1997. It received a second repeat run on the BBC ten years after its original broadcast, running on BBC Four from 8 February to 29 March 2006. In the early 2000s, the serial was also repeated on the UK Drama channel.

In April 1997, the serial was released on VHS by BMG Video in two sets, &quot;1964 – 1974&quot; and &quot;1979 – 1995&quot;. In 2002, BMG released the series on DVD, which along with the original episodes contained several extra features, including a retrospective discussion of the series by Wearing, Pattinson, Flannery, James and Cellan Jones, and specially shot interviews with Eccleston and McKee. Simply Media brought out a second DVD release of the serial in September 2010, although on this occasion there were no extra features. This edition contained an edit not present on the 2002 BMG release; most of the song &quot;Don&#x27;t Look Back in Anger&quot; by Oasis is removed at the end of the final episode, fading out early and the credits instead running in silence.

&quot;Our Friends in the North&quot; has been invoked on several occasions as a comparison when similar drama programmes have been screened on British television. The year following &quot;Our Friends in the North&quot;″s broadcast, Tony Marchant&#x27;s drama serial &quot;Holding On&quot; was promoted by the BBC as being an &quot;&quot;Our Friends in the South&quot;,&quot; after Marchant made the comparison when discussing it with executives. The 2001 BBC Two drama serial &quot;In a Land of Plenty&quot; was previewed by &quot;The Observer&quot; newspaper as being &quot;the most ambitious television drama since &quot;Our Friends in the North&quot;.&quot; The writer Paula Milne drew inspiration from &quot;Our Friends in the North&quot; for her own &quot;White Heat&quot; (2012); she felt that &quot;Our Friends in the North&quot; had been too centred on white, male, heterosexual characters and she deliberately wanted to counter that focus. The original stage version of &quot;Our Friends in the North&quot; was revived in Newcastle by Northern Stage in 2007, with 14 cast members playing 40 characters. In August 2016, Flannery was interviewed for an event, part of the Whitley Bay Film Festival, that celebrated the 20th anniversary of the series being broadcast.

==Radio==

In February 2022, it was announced that Peter Flannery had revived and rewritten &quot;Our Friends in the North&quot; for BBC Radio 4, with a tenth episode, written by Adam Usden, set in Newcastle in 2020.

Produced and directed by Melanie Harris, and with lead sound design by Eloise Whitmore, it features James Baxter, Norah Lopez Holden, Philip Correia and Luke MacGregor as, respectively, Nicky, Mary, Tosker and Geordie, Bryony Corrigan as Amy and with Tracey Wilkinson and Trevor Fox reappearing from the TV series but in new roles.

The cast also includes Tom Goodman-Hill, Eve Shotton, David Leon, Tom Machell, James Gaddas, Tony Hirst, Des Yankson and Maanuv Thiara; weekly broadcasts began 17 March 2022.

It was serialized in Shueisha&#x27;s manga magazine &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot; from February 1980 to September 1984, with the chapters collected in 18 volumes. The series follows the humorous adventures of the little girl robot Arale Norimaki, her creator Senbei Norimaki, and the other residents of the bizarre Penguin Village.

The manga was adapted into an anime television series by Toei Animation that ran on Fuji TV from 1981 to 1986 for 243 episodes. A remake series was created thirteen years after the manga ended, consisting of 74 episodes that were broadcast from 1997 to 1999. The series has also spawned several novels, video games, and eleven animated films.

&quot;Dr. Slump&quot; launched Toriyama&#x27;s career. It was awarded the Shogakukan Manga Award for and manga in 1981, and has sold over 30 million copies in Japan. The manga was released in North America by Viz Media from 2004 to 2009. Discotek Media released the first five films in North America in 2014. In 2021, Tubi announced their acquisition of the 1997 TV anime.

==Plot==

&quot;Dr. Slump&quot; is set in , a place where humans co-exist with all sorts of anthropomorphic animals and other objects. In this village lives Senbei Norimaki, an inventor. In the first chapter, he builds what he hopes will be the world&#x27;s most perfect little girl robot, named Arale Norimaki. However, she turns out to be in severe need of eyeglasses. She is also very naïve, and in later issues she has adventures such as bringing a huge bear home, having mistaken it for a pet. To Senbei&#x27;s credit, she does have super-strength. In general, the manga focuses on Arale&#x27;s misunderstandings of humanity and Senbei&#x27;s inventions, rivalries, and romantic misadventures. In the middle of the series, a recurring villain named Dr. Mashirito appears as a rival to Senbei.

==Humor==
&quot;Dr. Slump&quot; is filled with puns and toilet humor, and parodies of both Japanese and American culture. For example, one of the recurring characters is Suppaman, a short, fat, pompous buffoon who changes into a Superman-like alter-ego by eating a sour-tasting (&quot;suppai&quot; in Japanese) umeboshi. Unlike Superman, Suppaman cannot fly, and instead pretends to fly by lying belly down on a skateboard and scooting through the streets. Also, one of the village&#x27;s policemen wears a &quot;Star Wars&quot;-style stormtrooper helmet, just as in the American movies. Toriyama himself has been portrayed as a bird (the &quot;tori&quot; in his last name means &quot;bird&quot;, hence the name of his production studio Bird Studio), although it has been suggested (by himself even) that he actually based the design of Senbei on himself. In addition, other real-life people make appearances as well, such as Toriyama&#x27;s editor (Kazuhiko Torishima), assistants, wife, his colleague friends (such as Masakazu Katsura), and others.

==Production==
With Toriyama a newcomer to manga and his editor Kazuhiko Torishima still relatively new at his job as well, the two worked for 18 months with Torishima rejecting all the author&#x27;s ideas until the first draft of &quot;Dr. Slump&quot;. One of these rejected works, , served as a basis for &quot;Dr. Slump&quot;. After his 1979 one-shot &quot;Tomato the Cutesy Gumshoe&quot; saw some popularity, Toriyama decided to create another manga with a female lead character and that became &quot;Dr. Slump&quot;. Toriyama drew several short omake included in the &quot;Dr. Slump&quot; &quot;tankōbon&quot; volumes that supposedly depict actual events on the production of the series, although, as they are often humorous, the level of truthfulness to them is uncertain. In one, he claimed that when he told Torishima that he wanted to make a manga about a doctor, the editor told him to add a robot. Toriyama originally wanted a very large robot, but as it would not fit in the panels, he instead made it small. When Torishima rejected that idea, he made the robot a girl, knowing Torishima would find her &quot;cute&quot;. He also stated that Senbei was supposed to be the main character, but his editor told him to make it Arale instead, which Toriyama agrees turned out better. The act of having Senbei and Midori get married came from having nothing else to draw that week, and it happened quickly because he does not like romance. He went on to state that Torishima does enjoy romance, and that the relationships of Arale and Obotchaman, Akane and Tsukutsun, and Taro and Tsururin were all Torishima&#x27;s ideas.

Toriyama did not expect &quot;Dr. Slump&quot; to last long, as even before it debuted Torishima was asking him what he would draw for his next series. However, it lasted for roughly five years. When Toriyama began &quot;Dr. Slump&quot;, he worked at home, where he lived with his parents, and had one assistant who worked one day a week. Toriyama has said several times that he typically would not have any ideas for the story for that week&#x27;s chapter, but would think up something as soon as Torishima called asking. He thought up each week&#x27;s story as he drew and sent the rough draft to Torishima at &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot; headquarters in Tokyo by air courier from Nagoya Airport. After getting the approval of his editor, he began by drawing the lines that stick out of the frames, then the frames themselves, before using a g-pen to draw clear crisp lines at roughly one page an hour. After he had around eight pages finished, his assistant (also known as ) came over, although Toriyama stated he only allowed him to color. For color pages, Toriyama first drew them with permanent ink and used water-soluble color pens, before touching up with a wet brush. Later in serialization (around volume 13, as stated in volume 18), became his assistant when Hiswashi started his own series, although Hiswashi occasionally still helped out, as did Toriyama&#x27;s wife when they were close to a deadline.

In 2016, Torishima said that although &quot;Dr. Slump&quot; was very successful, having debuted at number two in the magazine&#x27;s reader rankings, Toriyama wanted to stop it after about six months. He explained that because it was a self-contained comedy each week, if something did not work, the author had to change everything. Torishima said that because it was a top-ranking series, would regularly sell a million copies, and had an anime about to begin, &quot;Jump&quot; and Shueisha would not allow it to end. However, Torishima claimed the magazine&#x27;s chief editor told him that if they could come up with something more interesting and successful then they could. In order to have time to discuss new ideas they had to adjust the weekly schedule, finishing a &quot;Dr. Slump&quot; chapter in five days instead of seven. Toriyama stated that one of the conditions he agreed to that allowed him to end the popular &quot;Dr. Slump&quot;, was that he start his next series relatively soon after. He began &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; roughly three months later.

In his own words, Toriyama described the scenery of &quot;Dr. Slump&quot; as having an &quot;American West Coast&quot; feel. Torishima recalled that when he asked Toriyama why he drew relatively sparse backgrounds, his reply was simply that it was easier that way. However, Toriyama has stated that he was particular about the art, working more hours on it than he would later on &quot;Dragon Ball&quot;. In an actual chapter of &quot;Dr. Slump&quot;, where Toriyama and Matsuyama appear, it was revealed that Matsuyama draws most of the backgrounds and houses. Toriyama often used colored paper, a technique fairly common in design, but less-so in manga. He stated that the tournament-type events, such as the Penguin Village Grand Prix and the kick the can contest, were popular with readers and inspired the Tenkaichi Budōkai in &quot;Dragon Ball&quot;.

Torishima described the &quot;Dr. Slump&quot; anime as unsuccessful in his opinion because it did not loyally follow the manga. He said this was because it was the first time the &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot; team had to manage an anime based on one of their manga and its creative process, explaining that, if something went wrong, it was too late to change because it was already animated.

==Reception==
The &quot;Dr. Slump&quot; manga has had over 30 million copies in circulation. Only a year after its debut, the series was awarded the 1981 Shogakukan Manga Award for and manga. Viz Media&#x27;s North American release of the first volume of &quot;Dr. Slump&quot; was nominated for the 2005 Quill Award in the Graphic Novel category. The first anime adaptation of &quot;Dr. Slump&quot; was also popular, holding the coveted Saturday 6pm timeslot for five years. With a 36.9% average household rating, its December 16, 1981, episode is the third most watched anime since the television ratings group Video Research began keeping track on September 26, 1977. In 1982, it was voted the 13th Favorite Anime in Japanese magazine &quot;Animage&quot;″s fourth annual Anime Grand Prix. In 2001, &quot;Animage&quot; ranked it number 48 on its list of the Top 100 Anime. TV Asahi released two Top 100 Anime lists in 2005, in the web poll &quot;Dr. Slump&quot; ranked number 34, while a nationwide poll of multiple age groups named it number 29. The following year, a list created from polling 100 celebrities had it in the 25th position. A running gag in &quot;Dr. Slump&quot; that utilizes feces has been reported as an inspiration for the Pile of Poo emoji. Ian Jones-Quartey, a former producer of the American animated series &quot;Steven Universe&quot; and creator of &quot;OK K.O.! Let&#x27;s Be Heroes&quot;, is a fan of &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; and &quot;Dr. Slump&quot;, and uses Toriyama&#x27;s vehicle designs as reference for his own. He also stated that &quot;We&#x27;re all big Toriyama fans on [&quot;Steven Universe&quot;], which kind of shows a bit.&quot;

Mike Toole of Anime News Network called &quot;Dr. Slump&quot; &quot;the greatest manga of all time&quot;, filled with &quot;parody, gags, and fart jokes that everyone from toddlers to grandparents can enjoy together&quot;. Jason Thompson referred to &quot;Dr. Slump&quot; as the best series Toriyama has created, claiming it is better drawn and more creative than &quot;Dragon Ball&quot;. He also reports that it is considered &quot;the last non-manufactured hit&quot; by many in the Japanese manga industry, particularity among &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot; titles. &quot;The Asahi Shimbun&quot; wrote that the manga&#x27;s appeal lies in its &quot;visually pleasing drawings, humor and laid-back atmosphere, which set it distinctly apart from works that glorified &#x27;moral virtues&#x27; like extreme endurance, self-discipline and so on.&quot; In their review, &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; stated &quot;Toriyama has created his own demented sitcom, and his fantastic imagination and comic invention never let up&quot;, &quot;The [English] translation is a bit flat, but the uncommonly good storytelling more than makes up for it.&quot; Eduardo M. Chavez of Mania Entertainment summarized &quot;Dr. Slump&quot; as a &quot;quirky slap-stick comedy entirely based in fantasy.&quot; He thinks that while Toriyama&#x27;s usual art style uses &quot;SD&quot; characters, &quot;Dr. Slump&quot; also shows hints that he can draw realistic. He noted that &quot;little nuances&quot;, particularity puns, are lost in translation from Japanese to English and expressed disdain for Viz&#x27;s censorship, saying it took away from the honesty of the series. Chavez feels that what the characters do never crosses the line into inappropriate; &quot;The jokes might not be wholesome, but they are genuinely funny and harmless&quot;; and went on to say that the series fills the void for &quot;all ages manga&quot; in bookstores and libraries.

Reviewing the first five movies, Carl Kimlinger of Anime News Network summarized &quot;Dr. Slump&quot; as &quot;random silly adventures [...] delivered with a lot of surreal nonsense humor, only the most basic sense of continuity, and not a whiff of substance or seriousness.&quot; He felt that much of the humor comes simply from the visuals; stating that the vintage hand-done art and animation provide a &quot;warmth&quot; and &quot;raises Slump&#x27;s visuals above&quot; other anime. However, he called the background music &quot;non-descript&quot; and stated that the films are only for viewers who are familiar with the series, as they provide no exposition.

<text>Christopher Eccleston (; born 16 February 1964) is an English actor whose work has encompassed Hollywood blockbusters and arthouse films, television dramas, Shakespearean stage performances and science fiction, most notably the ninth incarnation of the Doctor in the BBC series &quot;Doctor Who&quot; (2005). He starred as Matt Jamison in &quot;The Leftovers&quot; (2014–2017), and has frequently collaborated with filmmakers Danny Boyle and Michael Winterbottom.

Eccleston first rose to prominence for his portrayal of Derek Bentley in the film &quot;Let Him Have It&quot; (1991). His television performance in &quot;Our Friends in the North&quot; (1996) resulted in his first BAFTA Award nomination. He received a second nomination for &quot;The Second Coming&quot; (2003). Eccleston won an International Emmy Award for his performance in &quot;Accused&quot; (2010). On stage, he has played the title roles in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Hamlet&quot; and &quot;Macbeth&quot;, and starred in Strindberg&#x27;s &quot;Miss Julie&quot;, Ibsen&#x27;s &quot;A Doll&#x27;s House&quot;, as well as the Greek tragedy &quot;Antigone&quot;. Since 2017, he has narrated the documentary series &quot;Ambulance&quot;.

==Early life==
Eccleston was born on 16 February 1964 into a working-class family in the Langworthy area of Salford, then part of Lancashire. He is the son of Elsie and Ronnie Eccleston. He has twin brothers, Alan and Keith, who were born eight years before he was. On his religious upbringing, he said, &quot;My dad&#x27;s family were Catholic. My mum was very Church of England – still is – but it doesn&#x27;t work for me.&quot; 

The family lived in a small terraced house on Blodwell Street before moving to Little Hulton when Eccleston was seven months old. He attended Joseph Eastham High School, where he became head boy.

At the age of 19, Eccleston was inspired to pursue acting by such television dramas as &quot;Boys from the Blackstuff&quot;. He completed a two-year Performance Foundation Course at Salford Tech, then went on to train at the Central School of Speech and Drama. He was influenced in his early years by Ken Loach&#x27;s film &quot;Kes&quot; and Albert Finney&#x27;s performance in the film &quot;Saturday Night and Sunday Morning.&quot; He soon found himself performing the classics as well, including the works of William Shakespeare, Anton Chekhov, and Molière. 

At the age of 25, he made his professional stage debut in the Bristol Old Vic&#x27;s production of &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot;. Underemployed as an actor for some years after graduating from college, he took a variety of odd jobs: at a supermarket, on building sites, and as an artist&#x27;s model.

==Career==
===Early work (1991–1994)===

Eccleston first came to public attention as Derek Bentley in the film &quot;Let Him Have It&quot;, and for a guest appearance in the &quot;Inspector Morse&quot; episode &quot;Second Time Around&quot;, both 1991. The following year he portrayed Sean Maddox in the BBC miniseries &quot;Friday on my Mind&quot;. A regular role in the hit crime drama &quot;Cracker&quot; (1993–94) brought him widespread recognition in the UK. After he decided to leave the series, his character was killed off in October 1994. At around the same time, Eccleston appeared in the &quot;Poirot&quot; episode &quot;One, Two, Buckle My Shoe&quot;.

In 1994, he co-starred with Ewan McGregor in the low-budget Danny Boyle film &quot;Shallow Grave&quot;, and also landed the part of Nicky Hutchinson in &quot;Our Friends in the North&quot;, as part of an ensemble cast which featured Mark Strong, Gina McKee and Daniel Craig. The broadcast of the epic serial in 1996 on BBC Two helped to make Eccleston a household name in the UK. Also in 1996, he starred in the television film &quot;Hillsborough&quot;, written by Jimmy McGovern, portraying Trevor Hicks, who lost both of his daughters in the 1989 Hillsborough disaster. When Hicks got married in March 2009, Eccleston was his best man.

===Established actor (1995–2004)===
During this period Eccleston built on his early successes, appearing in a wide variety of films and working with high profile directors including David Cronenberg in &quot;eXistenZ&quot; (1999), Michael Winterbottom in &quot;Jude&quot; (1996) and &quot;24 Hour Party People&quot; (2002), and collaborated again with Danny Boyle on &quot;28 Days Later&quot; (2002). He played the Duke of Norfolk in &quot;Elizabeth&quot; (1998), appeared in &quot;Gone in 60 Seconds&quot; (2000) - years before taking his driving test in January 2004 - and &quot;The Others&quot; (2001). Eccleston took the lead role in &quot;Revengers Tragedy&quot; (2002), adapted from Thomas Middleton&#x27;s play of the same name. He starred in the independent films &quot;A Price Above Rubies&quot; (1998) and &quot;The Invisible Circus&quot; (2001). 

He also appeared in a variety of television roles, mostly British dramas, including &quot;Hearts and Minds&quot; (1995) for Channel 4, &quot;Clocking Off&quot; (2000) and &quot;Flesh and Blood&quot; (2002) for the BBC, a modern version of &quot;Othello&quot; (2001), and the religious fantasy epic &quot;The Second Coming&quot; (2003) for ITV, in which he played Steve Baxter, the son of God. He made guest appearances in the comedy-drama &quot;Linda Green&quot; (2001) and the macabre sketch show &quot;The League of Gentlemen&quot; (2002). Eccleston appeared in &quot;Hamlet&quot; in the 2002 production at Leeds&#x27;s West Yorkshire Playhouse. From March to April 2004, he returned to the venue in a play called &quot;Electricity&quot;.

Eccleston has been twice nominated in the Best Actor category at the British Academy Television Awards, both during this period, the first in 1997 when he lost to Nigel Hawthorne in &quot;The Fragile Heart&quot;. He was nominated again in 2004, losing to Bill Nighy who took the award for his performance in &quot;State of Play&quot;. Eccleston won the Best Actor category at the 1997 Broadcasting Press Guild Awards for &quot;Our Friends in the North&quot;. In 2003, he won the Royal Television Society Best Actor award for his performance in &quot;Flesh and Blood&quot;.

=== &quot;Doctor Who&quot; (2005, 2006) ===
On 2 April, 2004, the BBC revealed that Eccleston was to play the ninth incarnation of the Doctor in the revival of &quot;Doctor Who&quot;. Eccleston was the first actor born after the inception of the original series to play the role. It debuted on 26 March, 2005, and a few days later, on 30 March, the BBC released a statement, ostensibly from Eccleston, saying that he had decided to leave the role after just one series to avoid becoming typecast. On 4 April, the BBC revealed that the statement had been falsely attributed and released without Eccleston&#x27;s consent. The broadcaster admitted that it had broken an agreement made in January not to disclose publicly that the actor had only intended to do one series. The statement had been issued following inquiries from journalists to the press office. Following his departure, Eccleston was replaced by David Tennant, who played the Tenth Doctor from 2005 to 2010. 

For his performance, Eccleston won a National Television Award and was nominated for a Broadcasting Press Guild Award and BAFTA Cymru Award

On 11 June, 2005, when asked about his feelings about working on &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, Eccleston told a BBC interviewer: &quot;Mixed, but that&#x27;s a long story&quot;. Eccleston&#x27;s reasons for leaving the role continued to be debated in Britain&#x27;s newspapers: On 4 October, 2005 Alan Davies told &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; that Eccleston had been &quot;overworked&quot; by the BBC and had left the role because he was &quot;exhausted&quot;. Eccleston later stated that he had left the show because he &quot;didn&#x27;t enjoy the environment or the culture that the cast and crew had to work in&quot;, but that he was proud of having played the role. He subsequently said: &quot;My relationship with my three immediate superiors – the showrunner, the producer and co-producer – broke down irreparably during the first block of filming, and it never recovered.&quot; Eccleston said that &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;″s quote was partially falsified, stating that he &quot;didn&#x27;t find [the job], physically, too tiring. When &quot;The Telegraph&quot; said that, any other producer reading that would go &#x27;Oh, no, we can&#x27;t employ Chris Eccleston because he gets tired.&#x27; So, it was a lie.&quot;

Eccleston was voted &quot;Most Popular Actor&quot; at the 2005 National Television Awards for his portrayal of the Doctor. In July 2012, Eccleston spoke positively of his time on &quot;Doctor Who&quot; during a talk at the National Theatre. This led to speculation he was considering making a return appearance as the Doctor for the show&#x27;s 50th anniversary special, &quot;The Day of the Doctor&quot;, in 2013. Matt Smith, who portrayed the Eleventh Doctor, stated that he would have loved Eccleston to return. After discussions with executive producer Steven Moffat, Eccleston declined to return. In a 2018 interview Eccleston said that the BBC had &quot;put [him] on a blacklist&quot; when he left.

Eccleston began appearing as a guest at &quot;Doctor Who&quot; conventions for the first time in 2018. He had previously expressed his reluctance to appear at conventions, saying in 2017 that he preferred to &quot;just earn [his] living by acting&quot;. He has since said that his experience of meeting fans at conventions &quot;healed something in [him]&quot; and made him re-evaluate his relationship to the series.

On 9 August, 2020, it was announced that Eccleston would reprise his role of the Ninth Doctor in audio dramas for Big Finish Productions, across four boxsets to be released between May 2021 and February 2022. This would be the first time he had portrayed the role in 16 years. Eccleston was later confirmed to appear in a further four boxsets, releasing in 2022 and 2023, as well as an episode of the 60th anniversary audio series &quot;Once and Future&quot;. He has said that it is unlikely that he will reprise the role on television as his relationship with the BBC &quot;has not healed&quot;. When asked in 2023 what it would take for him to return to the character on television, Eccleston replied, &quot;sack Russell T Davies, sack Jane Tranter, sack Phil Collinson, sack Julie Gardner and I&#x27;ll come back.&quot;

===Other work (2005–2010)===

On 30 October 2005, Eccleston appeared on stage at The Old Vic theatre in London in the one-night play &quot;Night Sky&quot; alongside Navin Chowdhry, Bruno Langley, David Warner, Saffron Burrows and David Baddiel. Eccleston sat on the 2nd Amazonas International Film Festival Film Jury in November 2005. The Canadian born director Norman Jewison was chairman of the Jury. In December 2005, Eccleston travelled to Indonesia&#x27;s Aceh province for the &quot;BBC Breakfast&quot; news programme, examining how survivors of the 2004 Boxing Day tsunami were rebuilding their lives.

Late in 2006 he starred in &quot;Perfect Parents&quot;, an ITV drama written and directed by Joe Ahearne, who had directed him in &quot;Doctor Who&quot;. Eccleston joined the cast of the NBC TV series &quot;Heroes&quot; in the episode &quot;Godsend&quot;, which was broadcast on 22 January 2007. Eccleston played a character named Claude who has the power of invisibility, and helps Peter Petrelli with his powers. Eccleston appeared as the Rider in a film adaptation of Susan Cooper&#x27;s novel &quot;The Dark Is Rising&quot;.

Eccleston appeared on the BBC Four World Cinema Award show in February 2008, arguing the merits of five international hits such as &quot;The Lives of Others&quot; and &quot;Pan&#x27;s Labyrinth&quot; with Jonathan Ross and Archie Panjabi. In 2009, Eccleston starred opposite Archie Panjabi in a short film called &quot;The Happiness Salesman&quot;. Eccleston agreed to do the film because of Panjabi and the fact that it was a winner of the British Short Screenplay Competition. He also appeared as the villainous Destro in the G.I. Joe film, &quot;G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra&quot;. In 2018 he described his experience working on the film as &quot;horrendous&quot;. He did not return for the 2013 sequel.

Eccleston was cast as John Lennon in a BBC production called &quot;Lennon Naked&quot; which aired in the UK on 23 June 2010, with Eccleston playing the title role, and Naoko Mori, who had previously appeared with him in &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, as Yoko Ono. In November 2010, Eccleston starred in the first episode of BBC One anthology drama &quot;Accused&quot;. He won an International Emmy Award for his role. In May 2011, he starred as Joseph Bede in &quot;The Shadow Line&quot;, a seven-part television drama serial for BBC Two.

===Later work (2011–present)===
On 31 December 2011, Eccleston played the role of Pod Clock in an adaptation of Mary Norton&#x27;s children&#x27;s novel &quot;The Borrowers&quot; on BBC One. In July 2012, he starred in the political thriller &quot;Blackout&quot; on BBC One. In the same month, he starred as Creon in an adaptation of &quot;Antigone&quot; at the Royal National Theatre; his performance in the play was called &quot;charismatic&quot; and &quot;intense&quot;. In September 2012, Eccleston starred in the film &quot;Song for Marion&quot;, also known as &quot;Unfinished Song&quot; with Terence Stamp.

In 2013, Eccleston portrayed the villainous Malekith in &quot;&quot;, the sequel to &quot;Thor&quot; and the eighth instalment in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. In 2018 he compared working on the film to having a &quot;gun in your mouth&quot;. Later that year, he played John Aspinall in &quot;Lucan&quot;, a mini-series about the disappearance of Lord Lucan. From 2014 to 2017, Eccleston starred as Reverend Matt Jamison on the HBO drama series &quot;The Leftovers&quot; and earned consistent acclaim for his performance across all three seasons. In 2015, Eccleston starred in the television series &quot;Fortitude&quot; as a scientist based in Arctic Norway alongside Stanley Tucci and Michael Gambon before he and Marsha Thomason played a married couple who own a guest house in the Lake District in the series &quot;Safe House&quot;. Later in 2015, Eccleston starred as
Leonard &quot;Nipper&quot; Read in &quot;Legend&quot;, a film about the Kray twins, opposite Tom Hardy.

In 2016, Eccleston began appearing as Maurice Scott in the BBC drama &quot;The A Word&quot;. Maurice is the eccentric but lovable dad to his daughter who, with her husband, has an autistic son. The second series began airing in November 2017 both in the UK and the US, where &quot;The A Word&quot; airs on Sundance TV. A third series was confirmed and aired in the spring of 2020.

Eccleston played the lead role in the Royal Shakespeare Company&#x27;s production of &quot;Macbeth&quot; in 2018. The production was streamed on BBC Four. Also in 2018, Eccleston starred in two films; opposite Tom Wilkinson as crime boss Harvey in &quot;Dead in a Week or Your Money Back&quot; and as a Nazi officer Heinz in &quot;Where Hands Touch&quot;. That same year he appeared in &quot;King Lear&quot; as Oswald and in the television mini-series &quot;Come Home&quot;, the latter of which he was nominated for an Emmy Award for Best Actor. In 2021, Eccleston starred in the six-part television mini-series &quot;Close to Me&quot;.

Further projects include playing Fagin in the series &quot;Dodger&quot; and in a television adaptation of the award-winning novel &quot;My Name is Leon&quot;.

==Personal life==
Eccleston married Mischka, a copywriter, in November 2011. Their first child, a son named Albert, was born in February 2012. Their second child, a daughter named Esme, was born in 2013. They were divorced in December 2015.

Eccleston is a lifelong supporter of Manchester United, and was a regular marathon runner until 2000.

In September 2007, as part of a £9.5 million building project, Salford&#x27;s Pendleton College named its new 260-seat auditorium the Eccleston Theatre.

Eccleston became a Mencap charity ambassador on 28 April 2005, and is a supporter of the British Red Cross. He also supports research for Alzheimer&#x27;s disease and other forms of dementia; his father, Ronnie, had vascular dementia in his later years, from 1998 until his death in 2012.

In his autobiography, Eccleston described chronic anorexia, body dysmorphia and depression, and said that he had considered suicide. Speaking about his poor mental health, he wrote that he was &quot;a lifelong body hater&quot;. He was hospitalised in 2016 with severe clinical depression.

Eccleston is an atheist.

===Political views===
Eccleston has criticised the Conservative Party and expressed concern at opportunities for actors from his background to achieve his level of success in the future. He said in July 2017, &quot;It&#x27;s always been a policy of the Conservative government and party to destroy working class identity. If you prevent them from having a cultural voice, which is what&#x27;s happening, they achieve that. They hate us, they want to destroy us, so we&#x27;re being ruled out of having a voice.&quot;

Eccleston endorsed Labour Party incumbent Andy Burnham in the 2021 Greater Manchester mayoral election.

Eccleston is a British republican who supports the abolition of the British monarchy.

<text>Brothers James Lloyd &quot;Jim&quot; Mitchell (November 30, 1943 in Stockton, California – July 12, 2007 in Petaluma, California) and Artie Jay Mitchell (December 17, 1945 in Lodi, California – February 27, 1991 in Marin County, California) were American entrepreneurs. They operated in the pornography and striptease club business in San Francisco and other parts of California from 1969 until 1991 when Jim was convicted of killing Artie.

They opened the O&#x27;Farrell Theatre in 1969 as an adult cinema and at one time operated eleven such businesses. They produced and directed many adult films, including &quot;Behind the Green Door&quot; in 1972. They were also successful as defendants in many obscenity cases. Their notoriety significantly increased with Jim&#x27;s fratricide and they became the subject of three books, &quot;X-Rated,&quot; &quot;Bottom Feeders,&quot; and &quot;9½ Years Behind the Mitchell Brothers&#x27; Green Door&quot; and the movie &quot;Rated X.&quot;

==Early life==
The Mitchells&#x27; father Robert (known as Bob), from Oklahoma, was a professional gambler. He and his wife Georgia Mae settled in Antioch, California, near San Francisco. According to the Mitchell brothers&#x27; biographers, they had a relatively stable childhood; the boys were popular, and some of their childhood friends became important members of their porn empire. Both attended public schools and graduated from Antioch High School.

Jim, a part-time filmmaking student at San Francisco State University in the mid-1960s, aspired to become an &quot;important&quot; director like Roman Polanski and headed a clique of classmates with similar ambitions. While in school, he worked at the Follies, a cinema showing brief, plotless films featuring naked performers, and observed that each night the theater was filled with masturbators who arrived simply for the onscreen nudity. He therefore perceived pornography as a potentially lucrative career opportunity for himself and Artie, who had been discharged from the United States Army.

==Moviemaking and the O&#x27;Farrell Theatre==

In 1969, with the help of Artie&#x27;s Ivy League-educated wife Meredith Bradford, the brothers fulfilled their ambitions by leasing and renovating a dilapidated two-story building at 895 O&#x27;Farrell Street, which they converted into the O&#x27;Farrell Theatre, a movie theater with a makeshift film studio upstairs. They also rented a larger facility at 991 Tennessee Street in which to shoot some of their films; nevertheless, even their fans conceded that the Mitchells&#x27; movies ranged in quality from mediocre to atrocious. Jim Mitchell once quipped, &quot;The only Art in [porn] is my brother.&quot;

The Mitchells opened the O&#x27;Farrell Theatre on July 4, 1969, and were confronted almost immediately by the authorities. They would open other X-rated movie houses in California over the years, spending much time in court and money on lawyers to stay open as indignant locals and officials repeatedly tried to shut them down.

They became incorporated as Cinema 7 (headquartered in the managers&#x27; offices at the O&#x27;Farrell Theatre), and in 1972 produced one of the world&#x27;s first famous feature-length pornographic movies, &quot;Behind the Green Door,&quot; starring an unknown Ivory Snow girl Marilyn Chambers in her porn debut. The movie, produced for $60,000, grossed over $25 million.

The Mitchells rode the porno chic wave, using some of their &quot;Green Door&quot; profits to produce fairly lavish hardcore movies including &quot;Resurrection of Eve&quot; in 1973, &quot;Sodom and Gomorrah: The Last Seven Days&quot; in 1975, &quot;C.B. Mamas&quot; (1976), &quot;The Autobiography of a Flea&quot; (1976),&quot; Never a Tender Moment&quot; (1979), and &quot;Beyond De Sade&quot; (1979).

One of their last big-budget movies was &quot;The Grafenberg Spot&quot; (1985), featuring Traci Lords, who had entered the adult-video industry underaged using fake identification. The Mitchell brothers were the first to transfer film titles to videotape and market them via ads in national sex magazines. The brothers were inducted into the AVN Hall of Fame.

In 1985, the brothers made the sequel to &quot;Behind the Green Door&quot; that had been long-awaited—and often postponed. They hired Sharon McNight, a cabaret singer and frequent movie collaborator, to direct the picture and, uncharacteristically, chose to cast the film exclusively with amateur performers, despite the availability of such adult-industry stars as Lady Ashley Liberty, who had just concluded an engagement at New York City&#x27;s Show World Center. The Mitchell brothers auditioned virtually every newcomer who responded to their advertisements (which appeared in Variety and Bay Area sex tabloids). A handful of O&#x27;Farrell dancers accepted small roles; one of them asked to be cast as Gloria, the female lead, reprising the role originally played by Chambers, who did not participate in the sequel. While McNight considered the house dancer for that part, Artie Mitchell&#x27;s girlfriend, who then called herself Missy Manners, cast herself as Gloria. Filming of the sequel occurred mainly in the O&#x27;Farrell Theatre, and took only one day.

Missy, inexperienced at acting and public sex, reportedly had much difficulty performing in front of the film crew; the set was so tense that at one point Jim Mitchell harangued one of his O&#x27;Farrell managers in front of everyone because their catered lunch was inadequate. The Green Door sequel was also the world&#x27;s first safe-sex film, in which all the men wore condoms, and self-protection advice was given to the audience by one of the characters. Highly over-budgeted at $250,000, &quot;Behind the Green Door: the Sequel,&quot; according to adult magazines, was one of the worst porn pictures ever made, mainly due to the absence of a professional cast.

==Lawsuits==
In the mid 1970s, low-level organized crime began making unauthorized copies of the Mitchells&#x27; movies, and the brothers retaliated in the courts. When one judge ruled that obscene material could not receive copyright protection, the brothers eventually prevailed in the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals, leading to the FBI copyright warnings now found at the start of videos.

The O&#x27;Farrell Theatre was frequently raided on obscenity and related charges, leading to over 200 cases against its proprietors. According to Artie&#x27;s daughter Liberty Bradford Mitchell, the brothers were arrested and jailed more than 180 times each; the family euphemistically referred to those episodes as &quot;business trips&quot;. They were defended by attorneys who included Michael Kennedy and civil rights specialist, Joseph Rhine.

==Friends and activities outside of porn==
The Mitchells were popular on the fringes of San Francisco&#x27;s diverse society. Their friends included a who&#x27;s-who of pornography plus San Francisco personalities and celebrities from outside the city: Warren Hinckle, Herb Gold, Aerosmith, Black Panther Huey &quot;Doc&quot; Newton, and Jack Palladino. Palladino would come to be considered the world&#x27;s most expensive private investigator. The late journalist Hunter S. Thompson was a close friend of the brothers, and frequently visited the O&#x27;Farrell Theatre. In 1988, the Mitchells made a 30-minute documentary about him, &quot;Hunter S. Thompson: The Crazy Never Die.&quot;

Thompson claimed in his 2003 book &quot;Kingdom of Fear&quot; that he had worked for a while in 1985 as night manager at the club, an assertion repeated by some news articles. Thompson also claimed that the Mitchell brothers smuggled guns to the IRA.

Jim and Artie Mitchell supported various cartoonists, Dan O&#x27;Neill among them. During the 1984 Democratic National Convention, they opened the upper floor of the O&#x27;Farrell to a group of underground cartoonists, including Victor Moscoso, Robert Crumb, Spain Rodriguez, Ted Richards, S. Clay Wilson, Gary Hallgren and Phil Frank, to cover the convention for the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle.&quot;

Jim launched the publication &quot;War News&quot; to protest the first Gulf War; journalist Warren Hinckle was hired as editor, Robert Crumb designed the logo, and Art Spiegelman and Winston Smith were paid contributors. Other contributors included Daniel Ellsberg, Michael Moore, Paul Krassner, Ron Turner, Bob Callahan, Peter Bagge, Jim Woodring, Trina Robbins, S. Clay Wilson, and Hunter S. Thompson. The publication drew little support, and folded shortly after the defeat of Iraq.

==Personal lives==
Twice-divorced Jim cohabitated for years with Lysa Thatcher (real name Lisa Adams), a former adult-entertainment starlet and O&#x27;Farrell dancer. He and his second wife Mary Jane had four children and were married for seven years until 1986; one of them, Meta, is now the O&#x27;Farrell&#x27;s general manager.

Artie was the father of six, three with his first wife, Meredith Bradford (who retained her maiden name and insisted that their children go by Bradford), and the others with Karen Hassall, whom he divorced in the mid-1980s. Meredith attended law school at her husband&#x27;s expense and, upon graduating, represented the Mitchells until Jim fired her over a conflict involving his children&#x27;s manners at her family&#x27;s Massachusetts vacation home.

In 2011, Jim&#x27;s son James &quot;Rafe&quot; Mitchell was convicted of first degree murder for the 2009 death of his ex-girlfriend Danielle Keller in Novato, who was killed with a baseball bat. He was sentenced to 35 years to life for the crime. In May 2014, Artie&#x27;s daughter Jasmine, was arrested for her alleged participation in an identity theft ring. In his book, &quot;Bottom Feeders,&quot; John Hubner characterizes the Mitchells as frequently quarreling with each other and everyone else, alternately stingy and profligate, and often misogynistic. In Hubner&#x27;s book, the O&#x27;Farrell Theatre is a mirrored house of sleaze, filled with bikini-clad predators hustling money from men too insecure or ugly to get girls any other way.

==Killing of Artie and trial==
On February 27, 1991, Jim, in response to demands by friends and associates to &quot;do something&quot; about alcoholic, cocaine-addled Artie, drove to Artie&#x27;s house in Corte Madera with a .22 rifle that he had inherited from his father and fatally shot the younger Mitchell. O&#x27;Farrell dancer Julie Bajo (Artie&#x27;s lover at the time) immediately called 911 and the police arrested Jim minutes later. Marilyn Chambers spoke at Artie&#x27;s funeral, and he was then buried at Cherokee Memorial Park in Lodi.

After a highly publicized trial in which Jim was represented by an old friend, Michael Kennedy (by then a prominent attorney), the jury rejected a murder charge and found him guilty of voluntary manslaughter. Before Jim&#x27;s sentencing, numerous people spoke on his behalf (presumably appealing for clemency), including former Mayor Frank Jordan, Sheriff Michael Hennessey and former Police Chief Richard Hongisto. Jim Mitchell was sentenced to six years in prison.

One of the outcomes of Jim&#x27;s trial was that the California Courts allowed, in a precedent-setting decision, a computer-animation reenactment of the murder to be entered into evidence. The animation was produced by Alexander Jason, a crime scene analyst who had first planned to make a video to show the complex series of events that ended with Artie&#x27;s fatal shooting. The animation showed the positions of Jim, Artie, the bullet impact points, and the path taken by bullets as they entered Artie&#x27;s body. This was the first use of a 3D computer animation in a criminal trial. In his final argument before the jury, Michael Kennedy had attempted to mock the virtual reality reenactment. The method&#x27;s success led to its use in other trials.

==After release from prison==
After he served three years in San Quentin, Jim was released in 1997 and returned to run the O&#x27;Farrell Theatre. Jim established the &quot;Artie Fund&quot; to collect money for a local drug rehabilitation center and for the Surf Rescue Squad of the San Francisco Fire Department. (In 1990, Artie had been caught in a riptide off Ocean Beach in San Francisco, Jim had paddled out to help, and the Surf Rescue Squad had aided in the rescue of both of them; the Mitchells, out of gratitude, issued lifetime O&#x27;Farrell passes to the squad members.) Artie&#x27;s children have denounced the fund, claiming that it is intended to whitewash Artie&#x27;s murder. On their website, they describe their father&#x27;s murder as premeditated and motivated by greed and jealousy, and claim that the depictions of Artie in the books and movie are inaccurate. Shortly before his death, Jim wanted to change California&#x27;s nickname to &quot;the Prison State&quot; and design a license plate saying so. He intended to protest the efforts of law enforcement officers and prison guards to lobby for longer prison sentences.

==Death of Jim==
Jim Mitchell died at his ranch in Sonoma County, California on July 12, 2007, from an apparent heart attack. The funeral in Jim&#x27;s boyhood town of Antioch, California on July 19 was attended by around 300 people, including Mayor Willie Brown, former District Attorney Terence Hallinan, and many O&#x27;Farrell ecdysiasts. He was buried next to his brother.

==Books and movies==
Biographies of the brothers are &quot;X-Rated&quot; by David McCumber (1992, ) and &quot;Bottom Feeders: From Free Love to Hard Core&quot; by John Hubner (1993, ).

In 2000, their story was dramatized in the movie &quot;Rated X&quot; starring real-life brothers Charlie Sheen and Emilio Estevez as Artie and Jim, with Estevez directing. The film was shot in Toronto, Ontario, although the entire story occurred in the San Francisco Bay Area.

In 2001, the TV series &quot;Forensic Files&quot; aired an episode titled &quot;Sibling Rivalry&quot;, which documented Artie&#x27;s murder and the use of forensic animation and sound analysis at Jim&#x27;s trial.

The 2007 book &quot;9½ Years Behind the Green Door&quot; () by Simone Corday describes the brothers from the perspective of a dancer at the O&#x27;Farrell and girlfriend of Artie.

==Popular references==
The Mitchell brothers &quot;The Left Hand and the Right Hand&quot;, written by Chuck Prophet and released on his 2012 album &quot;Temple Beautiful&quot;. The album was an homage to Prophet&#x27;s hometown San Francisco.

<text>La Plagne () is a French ski area in the alpine valley of the Tarentaise (Savoie). Since 2003, La Plagne and the neighbouring resort of Les Arcs form the Paradiski ski area. It is currently owned by Compagnie des Alpes.

In 2014, La Plagne was named the most popular ski resort in the world with more than 2.5 million visitors a season on average.

==Ski area==

La Plagne lies at altitudes between (on the Glacier de la Chiaupe near the top of Bellecôte) and (in the village of Montchavin). La Plagne has of ski area spread across four communes (Aime, Bellentre, Champagny-en-Vanoise and Mâcot-la-Plagne). La Plagne has of slopes (134 slopes: 15 black/expert, 30 red/advanced, 72 blue/intermediate, and 10 green/beginner), and a large off piste skiing area including Bellecôte&#x27;s North Face. La Plagne is a modern ski resort with 2 cable-cars: the &quot;Telemetro&quot;, linking Plagne Centre and Aime-La Plagne and the Vanoise Express (which links La Plagne to Les Arcs, was opened in 2003, and travels at over , making it one of the fastest of its kind in the world, 8 gondolas, 36 chairlifts (2 8-seater, 11 6-seaters, 19 4-seaters, and 5 2-seaters) and 38 drag lifts. A bobsleigh, luge, and skeleton track was built in La Plagne for the 1992 Winter Olympics held in nearby Albertville. At the end of the 2022/23 winter ski season, ski access to the Chiaupe Glacier will close. The glacier is being &quot;rewilded&quot; to preserve the snow conditions. There will be access to ski the Bellecôte glacier, which will still be above 3,000m, but the peak will not be as high as the Chiaupe Glacier.

==History==
La Plagne was created in 1961, as with many resorts in the Alps, to save the valleys from becoming deserted. The agriculture and mining industries were in crisis, which led to young people leaving the valley in search of work. In 1960, four towns (Aime, Bellentre, Longefoy and Macôt) created an association to defend their interests, with an initiative of Dr. Borrionne, mayor of Aime. On 24 December 1961, La Plagne opened, with its two drag lifts and its four slopes. Emile Allais, great ski-champion, has helped La Plagne to grow. Immediately, La Plagne generated a great deal of success, and in 1966, Guy Lux, a French TV host, presented &quot;Interneiges&quot;, a live competition between two French resorts.

==Eleven resorts==
===Plagne Centre (1,970 m)===
The first of the resorts of La Plagne opened in December 1961. The name of &quot;Plagne Centre&quot; dates from 1982, before which the resort was simply called &quot;La Plagne&quot;. Plagne Centre has an urban, but functional architecture, and was created by Michel Bezançon. Plagne Centre is a model of the &quot;station intégrée&quot;, where cars and skiers are separated.

===Aime-La Plagne (2,100 m)===

Located in the commune of Aime, the building of Aime-La Plagne began in 1968, but the resort itself opened in December 1969. Called the &quot;Steamer of the snow&quot;, the main building (picture on the right) of Aime-La Plagne was created by Michel Bezançon. In 1990, the &quot;Club Med&quot; was built, with a design inspired by Tibetan temples. 
===Champagny-en-Vanoise (1,250 m)===

At the end of the &#x27;60s, this little village, located in the valley of Bozel, wanted to grow. The Vanoise National Park gave Champagny possibility to develop its summer activities. In 1969, Champagny became attached to the La Plagne resort, rather than to nearby Courchevel. Champagny is on a south-facing slope, unlike the other parts of La Plagne, meaning it gets more sunshine, therefore less snow.
===Montchavin (1,250 m)===

Montchavin is found in the commune of Bellentre which is historically an alpine farming community, that still has many of its original and pretty buildings. Now there are 3 chairlifts serving the village of Montchavin, with one linking to Les Coches, a short distance away, and the Paradiski ski circuit beyond. 
=== Plagne Villages (2,050 m)===

Opened in 1972.
===Plagne Bellecôte (1,930 m)===

Created in 1974, this resort was in project since 1968. It was to be called &quot;Les Ours&quot;, but it is the summit of Bellecôte which gave its name to the new resort. Michel Bezançon drew the resort like a hydroelectric dam to close the valley. In 1975, a gondola linked Bellecôte with Roche de Mio, and three years later with the summit of Bellecôte, in 40 minutes. In December 2005, the first 8-seater chairlift in La Plagne (Arpette Chairlift) was built in Bellecôte. 
===Les Coches (1,450 m)===

Opened in 1980 as a modern satellite to Montchavin, Les Coches is primarily a family resort now located at the centre of the Paradiski circuit and next to the Vanoise Express cable car, also linking into the La Plagne area by a six person high speed chair (Plan Bois). This area offers many delightful runs down through extensive larch forests and the accommodation is mainly high quality, self-catering apartments.

===Montalbert (1,350 m)===

Opened in 1980.

===Plagne 1800 (1,800 m)===

Opened in 1982.

La Plagne 1800 is known as the backwater of La Plagne with a special charm. An old mining village that still sports the traditional wooden chalets with locally quarried &#x27;blue lauze&#x27; slate roofs. 
===Belle Plagne (2,050 m)===

Opened in 1981. Belle Plagne is directly linked with Plagne Bellecote by telecabine. During season this lift remains open until midnight whereas the normal ski lifts already close around 5:00 pm. British tour operator Esprit Ski has its flagship hotel, L&#x27;Hotel des Deux Domaines (pictured far left) in the village, which is open in both the winter and the summer.
===Plagne Soleil (2,050 m)===

Opened in 1990.

<text>In music using the twelve tone technique, combinatoriality is a quality shared by twelve-tone tone rows whereby each section of a row and a proportionate number of its transformations combine to form aggregates (all twelve tones). Much as the pitches of an aggregate created by a tone row do not need to occur simultaneously, the pitches of a combinatorially created aggregate need not occur simultaneously. Arnold Schoenberg, creator of the twelve-tone technique, often combined P-0/I-5 to create &quot;two aggregates, between the first hexachords of each, and the second hexachords of each, respectively.&quot; 

Combinatoriality is a side effect of derived rows, where the initial segment or set may be combined with its transformations (T,R,I,RI) to create an entire row. &quot;Derivation refers to a process whereby, for instance, the initial trichord of a row can be used to arrive at a new, &#x27;derived&#x27; row by employing the standard twelve-tone operations of transposition, inversion, retrograde, and retrograde-inversion.&quot; 

Combinatorial properties are not dependent on the order of the notes within a set, but only on the content of the set, and combinatoriality may exist between three tetrachordal and between four trichordal sets, as well as between pairs of hexachords, and six dyads. A complement in this context is half of a combinatorial pitch class set and most generally it is the &quot;other half&quot; of any pair including pitch class sets, textures, or pitch range.

==Definition==
Most generally complementation is the separation of pitch-class collections into two complementary sets, one containing the pitch classes not in the other. More restrictively complementation is &quot;the process of pairing entities on either side of a center of symmetry&quot;.

The term, &quot;&#x27;combinatorial&#x27; appears to have been first applied to twelve-tone music by Milton Babbitt&quot; in 1950, when he published a review of René Leibowitz&#x27;s books &quot;Schoenberg et son école&quot; and &quot;Qu’est-ce que la musique de douze sons?&quot; Babbitt also introduced the term &quot;derived row&quot;.

==Hexachordal combinatoriality==

A 12-tone row has hexachordal combinatoriality with another 12-tone row if their respective first (as well as second, because a 12-tone row itself forms an aggregate by definition) hexachords form an aggregate.

There are four main types of combinatoriality. A hexachord may be:
*Prime combinatorial (transposition)
*Retrograde combinatorial (retrograde)
*Inversional combinatorial (inversion)
*Retrograde-inversional combinatorial (retrograde-inversion)
and thus:
*Semi-combinatorial (by one of the above)
*All-combinatorial (by all)

Prime (transpositional) combinatoriality of a hexachord refers to the property of a hexachord whereby it forms an aggregate with one or more of its transpositions. Alternatively, transpositional combinatoriality is the lack of shared pitch classes between a hexachord and one or more of its transpositions. For example, 0 2 4 6 8 t, and its transposition up one semitone (+1): 1 3 5 7 9 e, have no notes in common.

Retrograde hexachordal combinatoriality is considered trivial, since any row has retrograde hexachordal combinatoriality with itself (&quot;all&quot; tone rows have retrograde combinatoriality).

Inversional combinatoriality is a relationship between two rows, a principal row and its inversion. The principal row&#x27;s first half, or six notes, are the inversion&#x27;s last six notes, though not necessarily in the same order. Thus, the first half of each row is the other&#x27;s complement. The same conclusion applies to each row&#x27;s second half as well. When combined, these rows still maintain a fully chromatic feeling and don&#x27;t tend to reinforce certain pitches as tonal centers as might happen with freely combined rows. For example, the row from Schoenberg&#x27;s &quot;Moses und Aron&quot;, above contains: 0 1 4 5 6 7, this inverts to: 0 e 8 7 6 5, add three = 2 3 8 9 t e.
 01 4567 : 1st hexachord P0/2nd hexachord I3
 23 89te : 2nd hexachord P0/1st hexachord I3
 complete chromatic scale
Retrograde-inversional combinatoriality is a lack of shared pitches between the hexachords of a row and its retrograde-inversion.

Babbitt also described the semi-combinatorial row and the all-combinatorial row, the latter being a row which is combinatorial with any of its derivations and their transpositions.
Semi-combinatorial sets are sets whose hexachords are capable of forming an aggregate with one of its basic transformations (R, I, RI) transposed. There are thirteen hexachords that are semi-combinatorial by inversion only. 
 (0) 0 1 2 3 4 6 // e t 9 8 7 5
 (1) 0 1 2 3 5 7 // e t 9 8 6 4
 (2) 0 1 2 3 6 7 // e t 9 8 5 4
 (3) 0 1 2 4 5 8 // e t 9 7 6 3
 (4) 0 1 2 4 6 8 // e t 9 7 5 3
 (5) 0 1 2 5 7 8 // e t 9 6 4 3
 (6) 0 1 3 4 6 9 // e t 8 7 5 2
 (7) 0 1 3 5 7 9 // e t 8 6 4 2
 (8) 0 1 3 5 8 9 // 7 6 4 2 e t
 (9) 0 1 3 6 7 9 // e t 8 5 4 2
 (10) 0 1 4 5 6 8 // 3 2 e t 9 7
 (11) 0 2 3 4 6 8 // 1 e t 9 7 5
 (12) 0 2 3 5 7 9 // 1 e t 8 6 4
Any hexachord which contains a zero in its interval vector possesses transpositional combinatoriality (in other words: to achieve combinatoriality a hexachord cannot be transposed by an interval equaling a note it contains). For example, there is one hexachord which is combinatorial by transposition (T6):
 (0) 0 1 3 4 5 8 // 6 7 9 t e 2
Neither hexachord contains tritones.


All-combinatorial sets are sets whose hexachords are capable of forming an aggregate with any of its basic transformations transposed.
There are six source sets, or basic hexachordally all-combinatorial sets, each hexachord of which may be reordered within itself:
 (A) 0 1 2 3 4 5 // 6 7 8 9 t e
 (B) 0 2 3 4 5 7 // 6 8 9 t e 1
 (C) 0 2 4 5 7 9 // 6 8 t e 1 3
 (D) 0 1 2 6 7 8 // 3 4 5 9 t e
 (E) 0 1 4 5 8 9 // 2 3 6 7 t e
 (F) 0 2 4 6 8 t // 1 3 5 7 9 e

Note: t = 10, e = 11.

Because the first three sets (&quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, and &quot;C&quot;) each satisfy all four criteria for just one transpositional value, set &quot;D&quot; satisfies them for two transpositional values, &quot;E&quot; for three values, and &quot;F&quot;, for six transpositions, Babbitt designates these four groups as &quot;first-order&quot;, &quot;second-order&quot;, &quot;third-order&quot;, and &quot;sixth-order&quot; all-combinatorial hexachords, respectively. Notice that the first set, set &quot;A,&quot; is the first six notes of an ascending chromatic scale, and that the last set, set &quot;F,&quot; is a whole-tone scale.

Combinatoriality may be used to create an aggregate of all twelve tones, though the term often refers simply to combinatorial rows stated together.

Hexachordal combinatoriality is a concept in post-tonal theory that describes the combination of hexachords, often used in reference to the music of the Second Viennese school. In music that consistently utilizes all twelve chromatic tones (particularly twelve-tone and serial music), the aggregate (collection of all 12 pitch classes) may be divided into two hexachords (collections of 6 pitches). This breaks the aggregate into two smaller pieces, thus making it easier to sequence notes, progress between rows or aggregates, and combine notes and aggregates.

Occasionally a hexachord may be combined with an inverted or transposed version of itself in a special case which will then result in the aggregate (complete set of 12 chromatic pitches).

A row (B=0: 0 6 8 5 7 e 4 3 9 t 1 2) used by Schoenberg may be divided into two hexachords:
 B E F E F A // D C G G B C

When you invert the first hexachord and transpose it, the following hexachord, a reordering of the second hexachord, results:
 G C B D C G = D C G G B C

Thus, when you superimpose the original hexachord 1 (P0) over the transposed inversion of hexachord 1 (I9 in this case), the entire collection of 12 pitches results. If you continued the rest of the transposed, inverted row (I9) and superimposed original hexachord 2, you would again have the full complement of 12 chromatic pitches.

Hexachordal combinatoriality is closely related to the theory of the 44 tropes created by Josef Matthias Hauer in 1921, although it seems that Hauer had no influence on Babbitt at all. Furthermore, there is little proof suggesting that Hauer had extensive knowledge about the inversional properties of the tropes earlier than 1942 at least. The earliest records on combinatorial relations of hexachords, however, can be found amongst the theoretical writings of the Austrian composer and music theorist Othmar Steinbauer. He undertook elaborate studies on the trope system in the early 1930s which are documented in an unpublished typescript &quot;Klang- und Meloslehre&quot; (1932). Steinbauer&#x27;s materials dated between 1932 and 1934 contain comprehensive data on combinatorial trichords, tetrachords and hexachords including semi-combinatorial and all-combinatorial sets. They may therefore be the earliest records in music history. A compilation of Steinbauer&#x27;s morphological material has in parts become publicly available in 1960 with his script &quot;Lehrbuch der Klangreihenkomposition&quot; (author&#x27;s edition) and was reprinted in 2001.

==Trichordal combinatoriality==
Trichordal combinatoriality is a row&#x27;s ability to form aggregates through the combination of trichords. &quot;Trichordal combinatoriality involves the simultaneous presentation of four rows in parcels of three pcs.&quot; The existence of trichordal combinatoriality, or any other form, in a row does not preclude the existence of other forms of combinatoriality (at the least trivial hexachordal combinatoriality exists between every row form and its retrograde). All trichordally derived rows possess trichordal combinatoriality.

<doc id="461454" wikidata="Q1588205" url="?curid=461454" title="Conservative vector field">
<text>In vector calculus, a conservative vector field is a vector field that is the gradient of some function. A conservative vector field has the property that its line integral is path independent; the choice of path between two points does not change the value of the line integral. Path independence of the line integral is equivalent to the vector field under the line integral being conservative. A conservative vector field is also irrotational; in three dimensions, this means that it has vanishing curl. An irrotational vector field is necessarily conservative provided that the domain is simply connected.

Conservative vector fields appear naturally in mechanics: They are vector fields representing forces of physical systems in which energy is conserved. For a conservative system, the work done in moving along a path in a configuration space depends on only the endpoints of the path, so it is possible to define potential energy that is independent of the actual path taken.

==Informal treatment==

In a two- and three-dimensional space, there is an ambiguity in taking an integral between two points as there are infinitely many paths between the two points—apart from the straight line formed between the two points, one could choose a curved path of greater length as shown in the figure. Therefore, in general, the value of the integral depends on the path taken. However, in the special case of a conservative vector field, the value of the integral is independent of the path taken, which can be thought of as a large-scale cancellation of all elements formula_1 that do not have a component along the straight line between the two points. To visualize this, imagine two people climbing a cliff; one decides to scale the cliff by going vertically up it, and the second decides to walk along a winding path that is longer in length than the height of the cliff, but at only a small angle to the horizontal. Although the two hikers have taken different routes to get up to the top of the cliff, at the top, they will have both gained the same amount of gravitational potential energy. This is because a gravitational field is conservative.

==Intuitive explanation==

M. C. Escher&#x27;s lithograph print &quot;Ascending and Descending&quot; illustrates a non-conservative vector field, impossibly made to appear to be the gradient of the varying height above ground (gravitational potential) as one moves along the staircase. The force field experienced by the one moving on the staircase is non-conservative in that one can return to the starting point while ascending more than one descends or vice versa, resulting in nonzero work done by gravity. On a real staircase, the height above the ground is a scalar potential field: one has to go upward exactly as much as one goes downward in order to return to the same place, in which case the work by gravity totals to zero. This suggests path-independence of work done on the staircase; equivalently, the force field experienced is conservative (see the later section: Path independence and conservative vector field). The situation depicted in the print is impossible.

==Definition==

A vector field formula_2, where formula_3 is an open subset of formula_4, is said to be conservative if there exists a formula_5 (continuously differentiable) scalar field formula_6 on formula_3 such that

formula_8

Here, formula_9 denotes the gradient of formula_6. Since formula_6 is continuously differentiable, formula_12 is continuous. When the equation above holds, formula_6 is called a scalar potential for formula_12.

The fundamental theorem of vector calculus states that, under some regularity conditions, any vector field can be expressed as the sum of a conservative vector field and a solenoidal field.

==Path independence and conservative vector field==
=== Path independence ===
A line integral of a vector field formula_12 is said to be path-independent if it depends on only two integral path endpoints regardless of which path between them is chosen: 
formula_16

for any pair of integral paths formula_17 and formula_18 between a given pair of path endpoints in formula_3.

The path independence is also equivalently expressed as

formula_20
for any piecewise smooth closed path formula_21 in formula_3 where the two endpoints are coincident. Two expressions are equivalent since any closed path formula_21 can be made by two path; formula_17 from an endpoint formula_25 to another endpoint formula_26, and formula_18 from formula_26 to formula_25, so
formula_30
where formula_31 is the reverse of formula_18 and the last equality holds due to the path independence formula_33

=== Conservative vector field ===
A key property of a conservative vector field formula_12 is that its integral along a path depends on only the endpoints of that path, not the particular route taken. In other words, &quot;if it is a conservative vector field, then its line integral is path-independent.&quot; Suppose that formula_35 for some formula_5 (continuously differentiable) scalar field formula_6 over formula_3 as an open subset of formula_4 (so formula_12 is a conservative vector field that is continuous) and formula_41 is a differentiable path (i.e., it can be parameterized by a differentiable function) in formula_3 with an initial point formula_25 and a terminal point formula_26. Then the gradient theorem (also called &quot;fundamental theorem of calculus for line integrals&quot;) states that
formula_45

This holds as a consequence of the definition of a line integral, the chain rule, and the second fundamental theorem of calculus. formula_46 in the line integral is an exact differential for an orthogonal coordinate system (e.g., Cartesian, cylindrical, or spherical coordinates). Since the gradient theorem is applicable for a differentiable path, the path independence of a conservative vector field over piecewise-differential curves is also proved by the proof per differentiable curve component.

So far it has been proven that a conservative vector field formula_12 is line integral path-independent. Conversely, &quot;if a continuous vector field formula_12 is (line integral) path-independent, then it is a conservative vector field&quot;, so the following biconditional statement holds:

The proof of this converse statement is the following.

formula_12 is a continuous vector field which line integral is path-independent. Then, let&#x27;s make a function formula_6 defined as
formula_51
over an arbitrary path between a chosen starting point formula_52 and an arbitrary point formula_53. Since it is path-independent, it depends on only formula_52 and formula_53 regardless of which path between these points is chosen.

Let&#x27;s choose the path shown in the left of the right figure where a 2-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system is used. The second segment of this path is parallel to the formula_56 axis so there is no change along the formula_57 axis. The line integral along this path is
formula_58
By the path independence, its partial derivative with respect to formula_56 (for formula_6 to have partial derivatives, formula_12 needs to be continuous.) is
formula_62
since formula_63 and formula_56 are independent to each other. Let&#x27;s express formula_12 as formula_66 where formula_67 and formula_68 are unit vectors along the formula_56 and formula_57 axes respectively, then, since formula_71,
formula_72
where the last equality is from the second fundamental theorem of calculus.

A similar approach for the line integral path shown in the right of the right figure results in formula_73 so
formula_74
is proved for the 2-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system. This proof method can be straightforwardly expanded to a higher dimensional orthogonal coordinate system (e.g., a 3-dimensional spherical coordinate system) so the converse statement is proved. Another proof is found here as the converse of the gradient theorem.

==Irrotational vector fields==

Let formula_75 (3-dimensional space), and let formula_76 be a formula_5 (continuously differentiable) vector field, with an open subset formula_3 of formula_4. Then formula_12 is called irrotational if its curl is formula_81 everywhere in formula_3, i.e., if
formula_83

For this reason, such vector fields are sometimes referred to as curl-free vector fields or curl-less vector fields. They are also referred to as longitudinal vector fields.

It is an identity of vector calculus that for any formula_84 (continuously differentiable up to the 2nd derivative) scalar field formula_6 on formula_3, we have
formula_87

Therefore, &quot;every formula_5 conservative vector field in formula_3 is also an irrotational vector field in formula_3&quot;. This result can be easily proved by expressing formula_91 in a Cartesian coordinate system with Schwarz&#x27;s theorem (also called Clairaut&#x27;s theorem on equality of mixed partials).

Provided that formula_3 is a simply connected open space (roughly speaking, a single piece open space without a hole within it), the converse of this is also true: &quot;Every irrotational vector field in a simply connected open space formula_3 is a formula_5 conservative vector field in formula_3&quot;.

The above statement is &quot;not&quot; true in general if formula_3 is not simply connected. Let formula_3 be formula_98 with removing all coordinates on the formula_99-axis (so not a simply connected space), i.e., formula_100. Now, define a vector field formula_12 on formula_3 by
formula_103

Then formula_12 has zero curl everywhere in formula_3 (formula_106 at everywhere in formula_3), i.e., formula_12 is irrotational. However, the circulation of formula_12 around the unit circle in the formula_110-plane is formula_111; in polar coordinates, formula_112, so the integral over the unit circle is
formula_113

Therefore, formula_12 does not have the path-independence property discussed above so is not conservative even if formula_106 since formula_3 where formula_12 is defined is not a simply connected open space. 

Say again, in a simply connected open region, an irrotational vector field formula_12 has the path-independence property (so formula_12 as conservative). This can be proved directly by using Stokes&#x27; theorem,formula_120for any smooth oriented surface formula_25 which boundary is a simple closed path formula_21. So, it is concluded that &quot;In a simply connected open region, any&quot; formula_5 &quot;vector field that has the path-independence property (so it is a conservative vector field.) must also be irrotational and vice versa.&quot;

=== Abstraction ===
More abstractly, in the presence of a Riemannian metric, vector fields correspond to differential. The conservative vector fields correspond to the exact , that is, to the forms which are the exterior derivative formula_124 of a function (scalar field) formula_125 on formula_3. The irrotational vector fields correspond to the closed , that is, to the formula_127 such that formula_128. As any exact form is closed, so any conservative vector field is irrotational. Conversely, all closed are exact if formula_3 is simply connected.

=== Vorticity ===
The vorticity formula_130 of a vector field can be defined by:
formula_131

The vorticity of an irrotational field is zero everywhere. Kelvin&#x27;s circulation theorem states that a fluid that is irrotational in an inviscid flow will remain irrotational. This result can be derived from the vorticity transport equation, obtained by taking the curl of the Navier–Stokes equations.

For a two-dimensional field, the vorticity acts as a measure of the &quot;local&quot; rotation of fluid elements. The vorticity does &quot;not&quot; imply anything about the global behavior of a fluid. It is possible for a fluid that travels in a straight line to have vorticity, and it is possible for a fluid that moves in a circle to be irrotational.

==Conservative forces==

If the vector field associated to a force formula_132 is conservative, then the force is said to be a conservative force.

The most prominent examples of conservative forces are gravitational force (associated with a gravitational field) and electric force (associated with an electrostatic field). According to Newton&#x27;s law of gravitation, a gravitational force formula_133 acting on a mass formula_134 due to a mass formula_135 located at a distance formula_136 from formula_134, obeys the equation

formula_138

where formula_139 is the gravitational constant and formula_140 is a &quot;unit&quot; vector pointing from formula_135 toward formula_134. The force of gravity is conservative because formula_143, where

formula_144

is the gravitational potential energy. In other words, the gravitation field formula_145 associated with the gravitational force formula_133 is the gradient of the gravitation potential formula_147 associated with the gravitational potential energy formula_148. It can be shown that any vector field of the form formula_149 is conservative, provided that formula_150 is integrable.

For conservative forces, &quot;path independence&quot; can be interpreted to mean that the work done in going from a point formula_25 to a point formula_26 is independent of the moving path chosen (dependent on only the points formula_25 and formula_26), and that the work formula_155 done in going around a simple closed loop formula_156 is formula_157:

formula_158

The total energy of a particle moving under the influence of conservative forces is conserved, in the sense that a loss of potential energy is converted to the equal quantity of kinetic energy, or vice versa.
