<text>Uíge (pronunciation: ; ) is one of the eighteen Provinces of Angola, located in the northwestern part of the country. Its capital city is of the same name.

==History==
During the Middle Ages, the Uíge Province was the heartland of the Kongo Kingdom. The Bakongo North and South of the Kongo river were all part of this Kingdom, a centralized monarchy which for given periods of time also dominated part of the Ambundu further to the South. The kings lived in the city of M&#x27;banza-Kongo which had a population of about 50,000 in the 16th century. Knowledge of metallurgy among the Bakongo was renowned; their king was even called the &quot;Blacksmith King&quot;. Their reign was first strengthened by the arrival Portuguese priests who lived at the king&#x27;s court and taught religion as well as literacy; the interaction with the Portuguese stronghold of Luanda was rather marginal for a long time. Things changed when the Portuguese started to conquer and occupy the hinterland in the 19th century. In the beginning of the 20th century, the Kongo kingdom still existed on paper and the court in M&#x27;banza-Kongo was maintained, but had lost any effective power.

In the early part of 20th century the province was on a decline due to its inhospitable terrain and poor accessibility. The situation changed entirely when the Portuguese discovered that soil and climate were favourable to coffee production. The Uíge province (then called &quot;district&quot;) became Angola&#x27;s major centre for coffee production in the 1950s. While part of the production came from European (mostly Portuguese) owned plantations, most producers were Bakongo smallholders; in both cased, they relied on forced or &quot;contract&quot; labour from the Ovimbundu. Its market centre of Uíge town, the district capital, prospered and was designated a city in 1956. To encourage the principle of national integration with Portugal, many towns in Angola were renamed during Portuguese colonial rule, including the provincial capital of Uíge town, which was renamed Vila Marechal Carmona () after Marshal Óscar Carmona, the former President of Portugal, later simplified as Carmona.

In the 1950s, the Bakongo people were among the forerunners in the independence movement. For part of them, the purpose was to restore their kingdom, but their majority came out in favour of Angola as a whole. They formed first a regional movement, União das Populações do Norte de Angola (union of the people of Northern Angola), then baptized União das Populações de Angola (union of Angolan peoples), and finally the National Front for the Liberation of Angola (Frente Nacional de Libertação de Angola; FNLA), which became one of the three Angolan anti-colonial guerrilla movements fighting the Portuguese forces, during the 1960s.

During the Portuguese rule, the province, and in particular its capital Uíge, became the haven of rebel activity (its inaccessible wilderness providing the cover for such activity) of the rebels received active support from the leader of its neighbouring country of Congo, Mobutu Sese Seko. Rebels of the União Nacional para a Independência Total de Angola (UNITA) had even occupied the province for short spells during renewed civil war in 1990s. It was only in 2002 there was peace in the region.

Beginning in October 2004 and continuing into 2005, Uíge Province was the centre of an outbreak of Marburg hemorrhagic fever, a disease closely related to Ebola. It was caused by Marburg virus which is an African RNA virus that causes green monkey disease. Now thought to be under control, there were 374 cases with 88% deaths. According to the United Nations, it was, at the time, the world&#x27;s worst epidemic of any kind of hemorrhagic fever.

==Geography==
Uíge Province is located in northwestern Angola. It is bounded on the north by the Democratic Republic of Congo, on the west by the Zadi River, east by the Beu river and on the south by Beu town. The land route to enter the province is from Luanda through the province of Bengo. Roads are being built over the hilly terrain to connect with Congo. The main road in the north is the one which crosses the border at Kizenga to reach Kinshasa. A highway connects to Castilo and further on to Luanda. Another southwest highway connects with the provinces of Zaire and Malanje.

The province is drained by many rivers. Cuilo river flows is a popular attraction, as is the Sanza Pombo falls. The lagoon of Luzamba and Muvoio and the lagoon of Sacapate are good for swimming and bathing. Other important rivers in the province are the Zadi River, the Lucala River, the Dange River and the Luvulu River. Only small boats can ply these rivers. The province is characterized by pastoral terrain and rich soil, with an area of . It has a tropical climate with an annual average temperature reported as . The province&#x27;s Beu Forest Reserve covers an area of . It is bounded on the north by the Democratic Republic of Congo, on the west by the Zadi, east by the Beu River and on the south by Beu town. Since the Forest Reserve near Beu village is not declared the assistance provided to maintain it is lacking. Hence, the reserve has poor infrastructure and guidance. Among the large mammals, elephants could be sighted here.

==Demographics==
Uíge has a population 1,426,354. In ethnic terms, its inhabitants are almost exclusively different groups of Bakongo. They speak the Kikongo language.

==Economy==
The economy of the province is basically of traditional agricultural farming of coffee, beans, cassava, grain, peanuts, cotton, and wood. Plantation and production of coffee contributed largely to the economy of the province and also Angola during colonial times. Coffee production (in Uíge, Luanda, Cuanza Norte and Cuanza Sul provinces of Angola) was started by the Portuguese in 1830s and soon became a cash crop; the popular crop grown was robusta coffee (in its 2000 and odd plantations in Angola, owned mostly by the Portuguese). It was even one of the largest coffee producing country in Africa, in the 1970s. However, the civil war for independence from Portuguese rule devastated the coffee plantations and many coffee agronomists migrated to Brazil and the plantations became wild bushes. However, the rehabilitation of the plantation has started since 2000 but the investment required to replace the 40-year-old unproductive plants are estimated to be US$230 million. With opening up of new roads, industrial activity in the province is taking shape.

Important mineralogical resources which help the economy include copper, silver, and cobalt. Diamonds are also found in the alluvial deposits in the province. The Movoviao –Tetelo-Bembe copper exploration project is located in the province at the border with the Congo Republic. The project has been taken up under a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) signed in 2008 between Hansa Resources Limited of Canada and Angala Petroleum Services (S.A.R.L). Under this MOU, the Movio copper mine, which was operational between 1937 and 1961 as an open pit and underground mine, is being revived, in addition to the Bembe and Tetelco deposits. Several other minerals, such as cobalt, gold, lead, manganese, silver, vanadium, and zinc, have also been found in this region.

==Landmarks==
Some of the important monuments in the province are the tomb of Mekabango, and the tomb of king M’Bianda-N Gunga, ruler of the resistance movement.
São José church built in the 18th century is also located near Encope rock outcrop. A fort constructed in the 20th century is also located next to the church.

<doc id="448763" wikidata="Q1539360" url="?curid=448763" title="Northern Liang">
<text>The Northern Liang (; 397–439) was a dynastic state of China and one of the Sixteen Kingdoms in Chinese history. It was ruled by the Juqu (沮渠) family of Lushuihu ethnicity, though they are sometimes categorized as Xiongnu in some historiographies. Although Duan Ye of Han ethnicity was initially enthroned as the Northern Liang ruler with support from the Juqu clan, Duan was subsequently overthrown in 401 and Juqu Mengxun was proclaimed monarch.

All rulers of the Northern Liang proclaimed themselves &quot;wang&quot; (translatable as either &quot;prince&quot; or &quot;king&quot;). It was also only known as &quot;Liang&quot; (涼) from 399 to 401 and from 431 to 433, as their rulers took on several lesser titles while they were acting as vassals. To distinguish with the other Liang states, they were given the prefix of &quot;Northern&quot; by historiographers as they controlled northern Gansu when they first established. They later went on to rule the entirety of the Hexi Corridor with the key city of Guzang (姑臧, in modern Wuwei, Gansu) as their capital. 

After Northern Liang fell, remnants of the Juqu clan fled and occupied the oasis city of Gaochang in 442, where they restored their state as the &quot;Northern Liang of Gaochang&quot; (; 442–460).

==History==

=== Background ===
For most of its existence, the Northern Liang dynasty was ruled by the Juqu tribe of Lushuihu ethnicity. The Lushuihu, or &quot;Lu River Barbarians&quot; were an ethnic group whose origin is still debated by scholars today. Theories range from them being a branch of the Xiongnu people, to them being descendants of the Lesser Yuezhi that intermingled with the Qiang. The Juqu, in particular, were a Lushuihu tribe based in Linsong Commandery (臨松郡; in modern-day Zhangye, Gansu). Their ancestors once served under the Xiongnu empire under the title of &quot;Juqu&quot; of the Right of Xiongnu (匈奴左沮渠), which they then adopted as their family name. The Juqu eventually submitted to the Han dynasty, and centuries later found themselves serving under the Di-led Later Liang dynasty. 

After the Later Liang suffered a heavy defeat to the Western Qin in 397, two members of the Juqu, Juqu Luochou (沮渠羅仇) and Juqu Quzhou (沮渠麴粥) were blamed for the loss and executed. At their funeral, their nephew, Juqu Mengxun riled up the ten thousands in attendant to rebel and avenge their kin. He was defeated early on, but his cousin, Juqu Nancheng, rallied his troops and convinced Duan Ye, the Administrator of Jiankang (建康, in modern Zhangye, Gansu) and a Han Chinese, to lead their rebellion.

=== Reign of Duan Ye ===
Duan Ye took the imperial title of Duke of Jiankang and changed the era name, although real power was shared between him, Juqu Mengxun and Juqu Nancheng. In 398, Mengxun took several commanderies before capturing Zhangye, effectively controlling the western parts of Later Liang. Duan Ye shifted the capital to Zhangye, and in 399, he elevated himself to King of Liang. To distinguish with the other Liang states at the time, historiographers refer to his state as Northern Liang.

However, in 400, the Administrator of Dunhuang, Li Gao rebelled in his commandery and established the Western Liang, taking over the westernmost region and attracting the local Han Chinese. Tension also arose between Mengxun, Nancheng and Duan Ye. In 401, Mengxun manoeuvred into killing Nancheng and Duan Ye, seizing power for himself.

=== Reign of Juqu Mengxun ===
Juqu Mengxun claimed the title of Duke of Zhangye. With the Western Liang breaking away, the Northern Liang was weaker than it was before and had to rely on careful diplomacy with their neighbours. Initially, Mengxun allied with the Southern Liang to destroy Later Liang, achieving so in 403. He then declared himself a vassal of the Later Qin and began clashing with Southern Liang and Western Liang. He repelled several attacks by Southern Liang, and in 410, even besieged their capital Guzang (姑臧, in modern Wuwei, Gansu) but without success. The inhabitants of Guzang later surrendered to him in 411, and in 412, he made the city his new capital, where he elevated himself to the King of Hexi.

Northern Liang continued to place pressure on Southern Liang before they fell to Western Qin in 414. Their demise placed Northern Liang in contact with Qin, sparking a new conflict between them. In 417, taking advantage of Li Gao&#x27;s death, he went on the offensive against Western Liang. By 421, he captured their capital, Jiuquan and destroyed their last pocket of resistance in Dunhuang, ending the Western Liang. Thus, the Northern Liang became the sole power in the Hexi Corridor and began trading with the Western Regions.

With their western frontier secured, Northern Liang now concentrated their resources on the Western Qin. They allied themselves with the Helian Xia in the Guanzhong and launched a series of attacks on Qin, gradually weakening them. Previously, Northern Liang had submitted to the Eastern Jin in the south vassal, and they continued to send tribute to their successor, the Liu Song, who affirmed Mengxun&#x27;s imperial title in 423. However, in 431, both Western Qin and Xia fell, and Northern Liang was now in direct contact with the powerful Northern Wei dynasty. As a result, Mengxun decided to become a vassal to Wei, who bestowed him the title of King of Liang.

=== Reign of Juqu Mujian ===
Juqu Mengxun grew deathly ill in 433, and as he was dying, his officials considered his heir apparent, Juqu Puti (沮渠菩提) as being too young to lead and supported another son, Juqu Mujian to the throne. At this point, the Northern Wei was on the verge of unifying northern China. After succeeding his father, Mujian was compelled into entering a marriage alliance with Wei, sending his sister Princess Xingping to marry Emperor Taiwu of Northern Wei while he married Taiwu&#x27;s sister, Princess Wuwei, and Wei granted him the title of King of Hexi. Meanwhile, he was also a vassal to the Liu Song, who he engaged with in cultural exchange by trading literature works from their respective territories.

Despite their alliance, Emperor Taiwu was determined to complete his unification. In 439, alleging that Mujian was planning to rebel, the Northern Wei launched a campaign against Northern Liang and placed Guzang under siege. Mujian surrendered himself to Wei, thus ending the Northern Liang. The Northern Liang was the last of the so-called Sixteen Kingdoms, and their fall in 439 marked a formal end to the period.

===Northern Liang of Gaochang (442-460)===
Juqu Mujian was initially treated with respect in Wei, but by 452, he and his family members in Wei were all put to death under suspicion of plotting to rebel. While he was in Wei, Juqu Wuhui and Juqu Anzhou, continued to hold out in the far northwest and attempted to revive their state in their former territory, but eventually fled and occupied the oasis city of Gaochang in 442. In historiography, their state is known as the &quot;Northern Liang of Gaochang&quot;. In 444, Juqu Wuhui submitted to the Liu Song and received the title of King of Hexi. He died shortly after and was succeeded by Juqu Anzhou. Anzhou destroyed the Jushi Kingdom in 450 and attempted to maintain friendly relations with the Rouran Khaganate. However, in 460, the Rouran conquered Gaochang and slaughtered the remnants of the Juqu family.

==Buddhist cave sites and art==
The Juqu were strong propagators of Buddhism, and it was during the Northern Liang that the first Buddhist cave shrine sites appear in Gansu Province. The two most famous cave sites are Tiantishan (&quot;Celestial Ladder Mountain&quot;), which was south of the Northern Liang capital at Yongcheng, and Wenshushan (&quot;Manjusri&#x27;s Mountain&quot;), halfway between Yongcheng and Dunhuang. Maijishan lies more or less on a main route connecting China proper and Central Asia (approximately west of modern Xi&#x27;an), just south of the Weihe (Wei River). It had the additional advantage of located not too distant from a main route that also ran N-S to Chengdu and the Indian subcontinent. The Northern Liang also built and decorated the first decorated Mogao Caves (caves 268, and ) from 419 to 439 CE until the Northern Wei invasion. They have many common points and were built at the same time as of the Kizil Caves.

<doc id="448766" wikidata="Q521234" url="?curid=448766" title="You Oughta Know">
<text>&quot;You Oughta Know&quot; is a song by Canadian singer-songwriter Alanis Morissette, released as the lead single from her third studio album, &quot;Jagged Little Pill&quot; (1995), on July 6, 1995. After releasing two studio albums, Morissette left MCA Records Canada and was introduced to manager Scott Welch. Morissette began working on new music after moving from her hometown of Ottawa to Toronto, but made little progress. In Los Angeles, she met producer Glen Ballard, with whom she wrote songs including &quot;You Oughta Know&quot;. Despite much speculation concerning whom the song is about, Morissette has never disclosed the person&#x27;s identity and has never indicated an intention to do so.

&quot;You Oughta Know&quot; signaled Morissette&#x27;s departure from bubblegum pop to alternative rock, and features guitarist Dave Navarro and bassist Flea of Red Hot Chili Peppers. It outperformed the label&#x27;s expectations and received positive reviews. After the influential Los Angeles modern rock radio station KROQ-FM began playing it, the single reached the top ten in Canada, Australia and the United States. It was a multiformat hit in several US genre charts, and made the top 40 in Belgium, Iceland, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Sweden and the United Kingdom.

A music video was directed by Nick Egan. The single was added in the set list for Morissette&#x27;s 1995 world tour; since then, it has been included in her albums &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot; (1999), &quot;Feast on Scraps&quot; (2002), and &quot;The Collection&quot;, as well as 1997 Grammys and the &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot; compilation albums. It has received numerous accolades; in 1996, the single was nominated for three Grammy Awards, winning the awards for Best Rock Song and Best Female Rock Vocal Performance. In 2021, the song was listed at #103 in the Rolling Stone&#x27;s 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.

==Background==
In 1991, MCA Records Canada released Morissette&#x27;s debut studio album &quot;Alanis&quot;, which went platinum in Canada. This was followed by her second album, &quot;Now Is the Time&quot;, but it was a commercial failure, selling only a little more than half the copies of her first album. With her two-album deal with MCA Records Canada complete, Morissette was left without a major label contract. In 1993, Morissette&#x27;s publisher Leeds Levy at MCA Music Publishing introduced her to manager Scott Welch. Welch told HitQuarters he was impressed by her &quot;spectacular voice&quot;, her character and her lyrics. At the time she was still living with her parents. Together they decided it would be best for her career to move to Toronto and start writing with other people.

After graduating from high school, Morissette moved from Ottawa to Toronto. Her publisher funded part of her development and when she met producer and songwriter Glen Ballard, he believed in her talent enough to let her use his studio. The two wrote and recorded Morissette&#x27;s first internationally released album, &quot;Jagged Little Pill&quot;, and by the spring of 1995, she had signed a deal with Maverick Records. According to Welch, every label they had approached had passed on Morissette apart from Maverick.

==Recording==
Ballard met Morissette on March 8, 1994, after his publishing company matched them up. According to Ballard, the connection was &quot;instant&quot;, and within 30 minutes of meeting each other, they had begun experimenting with different sounds in Ballard&#x27;s home studio in San Fernando Valley, California. Ballard also declared to &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, &quot;I just connected with her as a person, and, almost parenthetically, it was like &#x27;Wow, you&#x27;re 19?&#x27; She was so intelligent and ready to take a chance on doing something that might have no commercial application. Although there was some question about what she wanted to do musically, she knew what she didn&#x27;t want to do, which was anything that wasn&#x27;t authentic and from her heart.&quot;

&quot;You Oughta Know&quot; was co-written by Morissette and Ballard. Morissette stated that she wrote the song from her &quot;subconscious&quot;: &quot;I wasn&#x27;t aware of what was coming out of me. I&#x27;d go into the booth when the ink wasn&#x27;t even dry and sing. I&#x27;d listen the next day and not really remember it.&quot; The demo was recorded on November 28, 1994, and additional vocals were recorded on November 30. Initial rhythm recording began with Los Angeles engineer Chris Fogel on December 1, 1994. Matt Laug played drums and Lance Morrison played bass. On December 5, Benmont Tench of Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers recorded Hammond organ. Additional guitars were recorded on December 9.

In early 1995, producer Jimmy Boyle recruited guitarist Dave Navarro and bassist Flea of Red Hot Chili Peppers to play on the track. According to Navarro, &quot;There were no guide tracks, we just had the vocal to work from... and we basically jammed until we found something we were both happy with. Alanis was happy too.&quot; Flea said, &quot;When I first heard the track, it had a different bassist and guitarist on it; I listened to the bassline and thought, &#x27;That&#x27;s some weak shit!&#x27; It was no flash and no smash! But the vocal was strong, so I just tried to play something good.&quot;

Two mixes of the song appear on &quot;Jagged Little Pill&quot;. Track 2 was mixed by Chris Fogel, and is the most widely known version of the song. Track 13 is the &quot;Jimmy the Saint Blend&quot; and was mixed by Jimmy Boyle and it was only used in the original music video from 1995, replaced in 2020 by the Chris Fogel mix.
==Composition==
Morissette has never publicly identified anyone as the ex-boyfriend portrayed in the song. In 2008, she said,
Well, I&#x27;ve never talked about who my songs were about and I won&#x27;t, because when I write them they&#x27;re written for the sake of personal expression. So with all due respect to whoever may see themselves in my songs, and it happens all the time, I never really comment on it because I write these songs for myself, not other people.

Nonetheless, in comments made on different occasions, actor-comedian Dave Coulier has alternatively admitted to and denied being the subject of the song. In 1997, the &quot;Boston Herald&quot; reported that Coulier &quot;admitted the lines are very close to home. Especially the one about &#x27;an older version of me&#x27; and bugging him [Coulier] &#x27;in the middle of dinner.&#x27;&quot; Coulier&#x27;s former television co-star Bob Saget said in one interview that he was present when Morissette made that call during dinner. In the 2021 documentary &quot;Jagged&quot;, Morissette denied the song is about Coulier.

Other celebrities have been rumoured to be the lover in the song, including: Mike Peluso, hockey player for the New Jersey Devils; Doug Gilmour hockey player; Matt LeBlanc, the actor who appeared in the video for Morissette&#x27;s single &quot;Walk Away&quot; in 1991; and Leslie Howe, a musician and the producer of Morissette&#x27;s first two albums in the early 1990s.

==Release==
Maverick Records released &quot;Jagged Little Pill&quot; internationally in 1995. The album was expected only to sell enough for Morissette to make a follow-up, but the situation changed quickly when KROQ-FM, an influential Los Angeles modern rock radio station, began playing &quot;You Oughta Know&quot;, which was released as the album&#x27;s first single. 
The song instantly garnered attention for its scathing, explicit lyrics.

The single was added in the set list for Morissette&#x27;s concert tour, Jagged Little Pill World Tour (1995). The song was added to the tour&#x27;s video album &quot;Jagged Little Pill Live&quot; (1997). Since then, the song has been included in her albums &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot; (1999), &quot;Feast on Scraps&quot; (2002), and &quot;The Collection&quot;, as well as 1997 Grammys and the &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot; compilation albums.

==Music video==
Directed by Nick Egan and produced by Mark Fetterman, the accompanying music video for the track was filmed in Death Valley. In the video, Morissette aggressively runs around the desert landscape and sings into a microphone on a mock-up stage with her then band-members performing, including Taylor Hawkins. Throughout the video, Morissette switches from a short black dress to a white shirt, jeans and coat, to a blue silk shirt in the climax – all signifying her change in image.

== Reception ==
Upon release &quot;You Oughta Know&quot; was met with positive reviews from critics. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic praised the song&#x27;s &quot;vengeful&quot; lyrics and stated that the song propelled the album&#x27;s success and encouraged the public to embrace the &quot;women in rock&quot; movement. Steve Baltin from &quot;Cash Box&quot; wrote that here, the singer &quot;comes out of the box with the same scintillating sensuality that marked Sophie B. Hawkins&#x27; coming out song, &#x27;Damn, I Wish I Was Your Lover&#x27;. When the 20-year old Morissette sings, &#x27;Are you thinking of me when you fuck her&#x27;, ears can&#x27;t help but stand up at attention. The brilliantly emotive song is sung with just the right blend of anger and passion.&quot; David Browne of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; also praised the single&#x27;s lyrical content, calling them &quot;spiteful and seething&quot;, and continues by saying that Morissette was able to turn &quot;jealous bile into something worth hearing.&quot; Chuck Campbell from &quot;Knoxville News Sentinel&quot; felt it &quot;promises to be one of the year&#x27;s most memorable songs&quot;, remarking that it &quot;belongs to Morissette, who builds to a rage-filled chorus&quot;. He added, &quot;Her stunned reaction to being unceremoniously dumped may belie her age (21), but jilted souls of all ages can connect with the bitterness.&quot; A reviewer from &quot;Music &amp; Media&quot; commented, &quot;Jeez, this woman is really cross. Her man has walked away with &#x27;another&#x27;, and she can&#x27;t hide that jealousy, which is stirred by a mean beat and an aggressively rocking wah guitar.&quot; British magazine &quot;Music Week&quot; gave it three out of five, adding, &quot;The Canadian songstress shows startling maturity for her years, and this debut single from her album &quot;Jagged Little Pill&quot; is made all the stronger by guests Flea and Dave Navarro of the Chili Peppers.&quot; David Sinclair from &quot;The Times&quot; wrote, &quot;The arrangement bustles along, thanks to the rugged bass and guitar-playing (...), gradually building to a knockout punch of a chorus. But the song&#x27;s tremendous thrust derives primarily from Morissette herself as she nails down a rapid succession of home truths with vengeful enthusiasm.&quot;

==Commercial performance==

The song was only a modest hit in Morissette&#x27;s native Canada at first, initially reaching number 20 on the &quot;RPM&quot; 100 Hit Tracks chart and number 21 on the &quot;RPM&quot; Alternative 30 chart. However, it would eventually reach a number-six peak in the artist&#x27;s home country, thanks to a resurgence of popularity in the United States later in the fall of 1996 resulting from the release of a &quot;live&quot; version that Morissette had performed at the Grammy Awards in Los Angeles earlier that year. This version was issued as part of the commercial single release for her follow-up single &quot;You Learn&quot;; the latter track was credited as the official &quot;A&quot;-side of the double-sided release during its entire chart run, which peaked at number six. Music journalists have attributed the uneven chart performance of &quot;You Oughta Know&quot; to resistance from Canadian radio programmers, because the aggressive, hard rock nature of the song marked a dramatic shift from Morissette&#x27;s established image as a teen dance-pop star. Even in Morissette&#x27;s own hometown of Ottawa, most radio stations resisted the song, with contemporary hit radio stations deeming it too rock-oriented for their formats and rock stations deeming it too dance-pop. It was the only single from the album not to hit number one or two on the Canadian pop charts. Despite the song&#x27;s initially poor chart performance, however, the video reached number one on MuchMusic and number three on MusiquePlus in the summer, and overall album sales of &quot;Jagged Little Pill&quot; were comparable to those in the United States even while the single&#x27;s performance was faltering.

&quot;You Oughta Know&quot; received moderate to major success worldwide. In New Zealand, the song was released twice: once as a solo single, then as a double A-side with &quot;Ironic&quot; in 1996. The solo release saw the song peak at number 25 and stay in the top 50 for 25 nonconsecutive weeks, while the re-release with &quot;Ironic&quot; allowed the song to reach number three. It was certified gold by Recorded Music NZ (RMNZ), for shipments of 15,000 copies.
Most notably, the song was a top ten hit in three different genre charts in the United States, peaking at number three on the active rock charts, seven on the contemporary hit radio charts and number one for five weeks on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Alternative Songs chart, retaining the record for longest run by a woman atop that chart until it was surpassed by Lorde&#x27;s &quot;Royals&quot; in 2013. In addition, the song was a top ten hit in Australia, and reached the top 40 in Belgium, the Netherlands, and Sweden.

The song saw some success in the United Kingdom, debuting at number 76 on the week ending of July 25, 1995; over the course of the next few weeks &quot;You Oughta Know&quot; rose to numbers 53, 40, and finally 22. The song held its peak position for a second week before falling to number 30, then continued to drop on the charts, and after eight weeks, it fell off the charts completely.

==Legacy==
&quot;You Oughta Know&quot; was ranked at number 12 on VH1&#x27;s &quot;100 Greatest Songs of the 90&#x27;s&quot; in December 2007. In 1996, the single was nominated for three Grammy Awards, winning the awards for Best Rock Song and Best Female Rock Vocal Performance but losing the Grammy Award for Song of the Year to Seal&#x27;s song &quot;Kiss from a Rose&quot;. Additionally, the song entered &quot;About.com&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Top 10 Alanis Morissette Lyrics&quot; list at number three, with Bill Lamb picking the lyrics, &quot;And every time you speak her name, Does she know how you told me, You&#x27;d hold me until you died, Till you died, but you&#x27;re still alive&quot; as the best.

Before inviting Morissette onstage to sing &quot;You Oughta Know&quot; with her at an August 2015 concert, Taylor Swift said, &quot;[Morissette] inspired a generation of confessional female singer-songwriters who all of the sudden felt like you could actually say these raw feelings that you had. You could actually sing about your real life. You could put detail to it. You could get really, really mad if you wanted to. And I think that it is fair to say that so many of the female singer-songwriters of my generation, including myself, would not write the way we do without her and her music.&quot;

A re-arranged version of the song also appeared in &quot;Jagged Little Pill,&quot; a 2020 jukebox musical based around music by Morissette. Composer Tom Kitt noted that it was particularly difficult to adapt &quot;You Oughta Know&quot;, questioning how they could &quot;take something that already is a ball of fire and truth and emotion&quot; and still have it &quot;stake its own claim in the musical&quot;.

==Cover versions==

Since the song&#x27;s initial release, it has been covered by numerous artists. American musician and parodist &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic utilized a portion of this song for &quot;The Alternative Polka&quot;, which appeared on his album &quot;Bad Hair Day&quot;, released the year after the song was released. Richard Cheese and Lounge Against the Machine covered the song in a comedic lounge music style on their 2005 album &quot;Aperitif for Destruction&quot;.

Britney Spears performed the song during her 2009 The Circus Starring Britney Spears tour. Mike Bruno of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; wrote, &quot;she rocked it. What better way to silence the critics than to step up to the mic, say to hell with it all, and spew some of that bile. Hot, confident Britney, live vocals, a dash of rebellion…&quot; After a number of Jonathan Coulton&#x27;s fans compared Morissette&#x27;s cover of &quot;My Humps&quot; to his cover of &quot;Baby Got Back&quot;, he covered &quot;You Oughta Know&quot; himself.

The song was sampled by American R&amp;B singer Beyoncé during her 2009 I Am... World Tour, her I Am… Yours residency in Las Vegas, as well as at the 2010 Grammys and her historic headlining Glastonbury Festival Performance.

In August 2015, when Taylor Swift invited Morissette on stage in Los Angeles to sing the song with her, many of Swift&#x27;s fans at the concert, who had been born after the song&#x27;s release, expressed bewilderment as to her identity. In &quot;Slate&quot;, Amanda Marcotte suggested it was better they didn&#x27;t, criticizing the song in the process. &quot;I am happy for these teenagers who don&#x27;t know who Alanis Morissette is. I envy you, teens,&quot; she wrote. &quot;[W]eirdly enough, &#x27;You Oughta Know&#x27; was held up in 1995 as some kind of feminist anthem of empowerment, an angry yalp of rebellion from ladies who had enough,&quot; she recalled. While she found nothing wrong with that idea in principle, she compared Morissette&#x27;s perspective in the song to men who lash out at women who they believe have put them in the &quot;friend zone.&quot; &quot;It&#x27;s still a song about refusing to take no for an answer. This is a &#x27;yes means yes&#x27; world. There&#x27;s no reason for the teens of this world to know anything about Alanis Morissette.&quot;

On November 22, 2015, Demi Lovato and Morissette teamed up to perform &quot;You Oughta Know&quot; at the 2015 American Music Awards. The performance was met with critical acclaim and turned out to be &quot;one of the most talked-about moments&quot; of the 2015 edition of the awards show.

Released March 25, 2022, Season 2 Episode 5 of the Netflix drama &quot;Bridgerton&quot; included a classical strings rendition of &quot;You Oughta Know&quot;, appropriately placed in a break-up scene shortly after male romantic interest Anthony had indeed &quot;bugged her in the middle of dinner&quot;. The version in the episode is instrumental, but Netflix also &quot;got a Alanis to sing along with the special cover&quot;.

The Warning performed a live-in-the-studio cover of the song for SiriusXM in October 2024.

<text>The Great Brink&#x27;s Robbery was an armed robbery of the Brink&#x27;s building in the North End of Boston, Massachusetts, on January 17, 1950. The $2.775 million ($ million today) theft consisted of $1,218,211.29 in cash and $1,557,183.83 in checks, money orders, and other securities. It was at the time the largest robbery in the history of the United States and has been called &quot;the crime of the century&quot;. The robbery remained unsolved for nearly six years, until estranged group member Joseph O&#x27;Keefe testified only days before the statute of limitations would have expired. 

Of the eleven people involved in the robbery, eight would receive life sentences after a trial, with two others dying before they could be convicted. Less than $60,000 of the more than $2.7 million stolen would ever be recovered. The robbery received significant press coverage and was eventually adapted into four movies.

* Joseph McGinnisaccording to O&#x27;Keefe&#x27;s testimony, McGinnis was the mastermind behind the robbery; however, this was later disputed by Geagan. He was responsible for destroying incriminating evidence, including guns, the truck, and clothes. McGinnis died in prison on October 5, 1966.
* Joseph &quot;Specs&quot; O&#x27;KeefeO&#x27;Keefe died in March 1976, at the age of 67.
* Anthony Pinoaccording to Geagan, Pino was the leader of the gang. Pino died in October 1973, at the age of 67.
* Adolph &quot;Jazz&quot; MaffieMaffie died in September 1988, at the age of 77. He was the last surviving member of the robbery.
* Thomas &quot;Sandy&quot; RichardsonRichardson died in 1980, at the age of 73.

The robbery was first conceived in 1947; however, in 1948, after months of planning, the group learned that Brink&#x27;s had moved to a new location. While the theft was originally intended to be a burglary, rather than an armed robbery, they could not find a way around the building&#x27;s burglar alarm. After observing the movements of the guards, they decided that the robbery should take place just after 7 pm, as the vault would be open and fewer guards would be on duty. Over a period of several months, the robbers removed each lock from the building and had a key made for it, before returning the lock. Two vehicles were stolen: a truck, to carry away the loot from the robbery, and a car, which would be used to block any pursuit. Vincent Costa was the group&#x27;s lookout and signalled with a flashlight from a nearby rooftop when he saw the vault being opened. After five aborted runs, Costa finally gave the go-ahead on the night of January 17, 1950.

== Robbery ==
Seven of the group went into the Brink&#x27;s building: O’Keefe, Gusciora, Baker, Maffie, Geagan, Faherty, and Richardson. They each wore a chauffeur cap, pea coat, rubber Halloween mask, and each had a .38 caliber revolver. At 7:10 pm, they entered the building and tied up the five employees working in the vault area. They spent about twenty minutes inside the vault, putting money into large canvas bags. Approximately a million dollars in silver and coins was left behind by the robbers; they were not prepared to carry it. The total amount stolen was $1,218,211 in cash and $1,557,183 in checks and other securities. By 7:37, one of the Brink&#x27;s employees managed to free himself and raise the alarm.

== Investigation and falling out ==

Immediately following the robbery, Police Commissioner Thomas F. Sullivan sent a mobilization order for all precinct captains and detectives. Thirteen people were detained in the hours following the robbery, including two former employees of Brink&#x27;s. Brink&#x27;s, Inc. offered a $100,000 reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of those involved in the robbery, with an additional 5% of recovered cash offered by the insurance company. Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, J. Edgar Hoover, took over supervision of the investigation.

The only physical evidence left at the crime scene was a cap and the tape and rope used to bind the employees. Most of the cash stolen was in denominations of $1 to $20, which made it nearly impossible to trace the bills through serial numbers. Any information police could get from their informers initially proved useless. The truck that the robbers had used was found cut to pieces in Stoughton, Massachusetts, near O&#x27;Keefe&#x27;s home.

In June 1950, O’Keefe and Gusciora were arrested in Pennsylvania for a burglary. O’Keefe was sentenced to three years in Bradford County Jail and Gusciora to 5-to-20 years in the Western State Penitentiary at Pittsburgh. Police heard through their informers that O&#x27;Keefe and Gusciora demanded money from Pino and MacGinnis in Boston to fight their convictions. It was later claimed that most of O&#x27;Keefe&#x27;s share went to his legal defense.

FBI agents tried to talk to O&#x27;Keefe and Gusciora in prison but the two professed ignorance of the Brink&#x27;s robbery. Other members of the group came under suspicion, but there was not enough evidence for an indictment, so law enforcement kept pressure on the suspects. Adolph Maffie was convicted and sentenced to nine months for income tax evasion.

After O&#x27;Keefe was released, he was taken to stand trial for another burglary and parole violations and was released on a bail of $17,000. O&#x27;Keefe later claimed that he had never seen his portion of the loot after he had given it to Maffie for safekeeping. Apparently in need of money, he kidnapped Vincent Costa and demanded his part of the loot for ransom.

Pino paid a small ransom but then decided to try to kill O&#x27;Keefe. After a couple of attempts, he hired underworld hitman Elmer &quot;Trigger&quot; Burke to kill O&#x27;Keefe. Burke traveled to Boston and shot O&#x27;Keefe, seriously wounding him but failing to kill him. The FBI approached O&#x27;Keefe in the hospital, and on January 6, 1956, he decided to talk.

On January 12, 1956, just five days before the statute of limitations was to run out, the FBI arrested Baker, Costa, Geagan, Maffie, McGinnis, and Pino. They apprehended Faherty and Richardson on May 16 in Dorchester. O&#x27;Keefe pleaded guilty on January 18. Gusciora died on July 9. Banfield was already dead. A trial began on August 6, 1956.

Eight of the gang&#x27;s members received maximum sentences of life imprisonment. All were paroled by 1971 except McGinnis, who died in prison. O&#x27;Keefe received four years and was released in 1960. Only $58,000 of the $2.7 million was recovered. O&#x27;Keefe cooperated with writer Bob Considine on &quot;The Men Who Robbed Brink&#x27;s&quot;, a 1961 &quot;as told to&quot; book about the robbery and its aftermath.
== Films ==

At least four movies were based, or partially based, on the Great Brink&#x27;s Robbery:
*&quot;Six Bridges to Cross&quot; (1955, Joseph Pevney)
*&quot;Blueprint for Robbery&quot; (1961, Jerry Hopper)
* &quot;&quot; (1976, Marvin J. Chomsky)
* &quot;The Brink&#x27;s Job&quot; (1978, William Friedkin)

<text>The small pratincole, little pratincole, or small Indian pratincole (Glareola lactea) is a small wader in the pratincole family, Glareolidae.

==Distribution==
The small pratincole is a resident breeder in India, Western Pakistan, Bangladesh, Burma, Laos, Cambodia, Sri Lanka and Thailand. It breeds from December to March on gravel or sand banks near rivers and lakes, laying 2–4 eggs in a ground scrape. Breeding areas include small areas in northern Karnataka (manvi district raichur.(and along the Hemavathi River) and northern Kerala near Kannur.

This species is only in length, with a wingspan. Because of its small size, the small pratincole can be briefly confused in flight with swifts or swallows.

==Description==
This bird has short legs, long pointed wings and a short tail. Its short bill is an adaptation to aerial feeding. On the ground, it looks mainly pale grey (hence &quot;lactea&quot;, milky). The crown of the head is brown.

The wings are grey above with black primaries and black and white bars at the rear edge of the inner flight feathers. The underwings are mainly black. The tail is white with a black terminal triangle. The belly is white.

==Ecology==
The most unusual feature of the pratincoles is that although classed as waders they typically hunt their insect prey on the wing like swallows, although they can also feed on the ground.

The small pratincole is a species of open country, and is often seen near water in the evening, hawking for insects.

<text>Andokides (; ) was a famous potter of Ancient Greece. The painter of his pots was an anonymous artist, the Andokides painter, who is recognized as the creator of the red-figure style, beginning around 530 BC. His work is compared with Exekias, who was said to have created the most detailed and best examples of black-figure pottery. Exekias is said to be the teacher of Andokides. Although the work of Andokides and his painter is considered inferior to that of Exekias, the invention of red figure was an important innovation.

The most renowned work of Andokides is the amphora depicting the god Dionysus and two of his maenads.

<doc id="448787" wikidata="Q31617" url="?curid=448787" title="Greater painted-snipe">
<text>The greater painted-snipe (Rostratula benghalensis) is a species of wader in the small painted-snipe family Rostratulidae. It widely distributed across Africa and southern Asia and is found in a variety of wetland habitats, including swamps and the edges of larger water bodies such as lakes and rivers. This species is sexually dimorphic with the female being larger and more brightly coloured than the male. The female is normally polyandrous with the males incubating the eggs and caring for the young.

==Taxonomy==
The greater painted-snipe was formally described in 1758 by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. He placed it with the rails in the genus &quot;Rallus&quot; and coined the binomial name &quot;Rallus benghalenis&quot;. Linnaeus based his account on the &quot;Bengall water rail&quot; that had been described and illustrated in 1738 by the English naturalist Eleazar Albin in his &quot;A Natural History of Birds&quot;. Albin had examined a drawing that had been sent to the English silk-pattern designer Joseph Dandridge from Bengal. The greater painted-snipe is now placed with the Australian painted-snipe in the genus &quot;Rostratula&quot; that was introduced in 1816 by the French ornithologist Louis Vieillot. The species is treated as monotypic: no subspecies are recognised.

The Australian painted-snipe (&quot;Rostratula australis&quot;) was formerly treated as a subspecies but was promoted to species status based on the differences in morphology and in the vocal calls.

==Description==

The greater painted-snipe is a medium-sized shorebird with an overall length of . The species is sexually dimorphic: females are larger, heavier, and have bolder plumage than males. The female has a black head with a buff stripe and a white eye-patch. The neck is dark rufous. The upperparts are mostly dark bronze-green finely barred with black. A white stripe curves around the shoulder mantle. The underbody is white. The male is much paler and less uniform with barring on the and wing-coverts. The juvenile resembles the male but lacks the darker band around the chest.

It is not a vocal species; apart from the breeding season, it is mostly silent. The female may make a &quot;mellow hooting or booming&quot; sound.

== Distribution and habitat==
Greater painted-snipe are very widely distributed; in mainland Africa as well as Madagascar and the Seychelles; in India, and Southeast Asia. Within Africa, they are found in the Nile River Valley and in the non-rainforested areas of Sub-Saharan Africa. They are notably absent from the eastern portion of Somalia, from the desert areas of Namibia, and from parts of Botswana and South Africa. Despite their wide distribution, they are uncommon within their range. There are between 31,000 and 1,000,000 mature individuals alive, according to BirdLife International.

Although this species inhabits a variety of wetland habitats, it prefers muddy areas with available cover (i.e., vegetation). It is also found on the edges of lakes and rivers, provided there is cover nearby, and in marshes and around swamps. They are usually found close to the fringes of reed beds along shorelines of marshes, swamps, ponds and streams.

==Behaviour==
Greater painted-snipe usually live solitarily or in pairs, but sometimes are found in large groups. They are rather shy and retiring, skulking close to the vegetation so that they can retreat to cover if disturbed. When flushed, the birds like rails, with their legs dangling.

===Food and feeding===
Feeds on insects, snails, earthworms and crustacea as well as vegetable matter such as plant seeds. Uses scythe-like action of the head and bill in shallow water. They are generally crepuscular, feeding in the early morning and near dusk.


===Breeding===
Greater painted-snipe are almost always polyandrous. The female initiates courtship and usually mates with two males in a season, but may mate with up to four. Males incubate the eggs and provide parental care. The females court the males, are polyandrous with males incubating and raising the young. The nest is a shallow scrape in soft ground, lined with plant material and situated among grass or reeds at the water&#x27;s edge; sometimes a pad of vegetation or a nest of grass and weeds. It is usually well concealed. The clutch is normally 4 eggs. These have a light buff-yellow background and are covered with black-brown blotches, spots and lines. The eggs which measure are incubated by the male for around 19 days. The young are precocial and nidifugous. They are brooded when they are small. The chicks are buff coloured and have black stripes running along their length.

== Conservation status ==
The greater painted-snipe is as &quot;Least Concern&quot; by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), due to its large range and the relatively slow rate of population decrease.

<text>The masked finch (Poephila personata) is a small passerine bird in the estrildid finch family, Estrildidae. It is a common resident of dry savannah across northern Australia, from the Kimberley, across the Top End, the Gulf country and the southern part of Cape York Peninsula, as far east as Chillagoe, but always near water.

==Description==
The masked finch is 12.5–13.5 cm long. The male is larger, but the sexes are otherwise similar. It is cinnamon-brown above and paler below with a white rump, black mark on the flanks and black face mask. It has a heavy yellow bill and a pointed black tail. The eastern subspecies &quot;P. p. leucotis&quot; has whitish cheeks.

==Behaviour==
Pairs or small flocks of masked finches forage through the day, mostly on the ground for grass seeds. In the evenings and early mornings, large numbers—sometimes thousands— can gather around waterholes to drink, cleanse, and preen, flicking their tails sideways and chattering incessantly.

Pairs build a domed nest from grasses, lined with fine grass, feathers, and charcoal, in the late wet or early dry season. The nest position varies: it can be as high as 20 metres or simply hidden in long grass. Five to six white eggs are laid.

<text>The white-faced whistling duck (Dendrocygna viduata) is a whistling duck that breeds in sub-Saharan Africa and much of South America.

This species is gregarious, and at favoured sites, the flocks of a thousand or more birds arriving at dawn are an impressive sight. As the name implies, these are noisy birds with a clear three-note whistling call.
==Taxonomy==
The white-faced whistling duck was formally described by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in 1766 in the twelfth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; under the binomial name &quot; Anas viduata&quot;. He specified the type locality as Cartagena in Colombia. The white-faced whistling duck is now one of eight species placed in the genus &quot;Dendrocygna&quot; that was introduced in 1837 by the English naturalist William Swainson. The species is considered as monotypic: no subspecies are recognised. The genus name combines the Ancient Greek &quot;dendron&quot; meaning &quot;tree&quot; with the genus name &quot;Cygnus&quot; Bechstein, 1803, meaning &quot;swan&quot; in Latin. The specific epithet &quot; viduata&quot; is Latin meaning &quot;widowed&quot; or &quot;in mourning&quot;.

== Description ==
The white-faced whistling duck has a long grey bill, a long head, and longish legs. It has a black neck and head, and a distinctive white face that gives it its name, though the amount of white color visible has regional variations among the species. For example, the white-faced whistling ducks with more black coloration are commonly found in western Africa where rainfall supersedes the dry season. The back and wings are dark brown to black, and the underparts are black with a fine white barring on the flanks. The neck is chestnut. Males and females have similar plumage. Juveniles are similar in color to adults but have a much less contrasted head pattern.

==Distribution and habitat==
The white-faced whistling duck has a peculiar disjunctive distribution, occurring in Africa and South America. It has been suggested that they may have been transported to new locations worldwide by humans. The habitat is still freshwater lakes or reservoirs, with plentiful vegetation, where this duck feeds on seeds and other plant food.

Because of its large range, there are many common names for the white-faced whistling duck, including &quot;irere&quot; and &quot;guiriri&quot;.

== Behaviour and ecology ==
This is an abundant species. It is largely resident, apart from local movements which can be 100 km or more.

=== Breeding===
The nest site is a depression in the ground or in reed beds. The clutch is 6 to 12 eggs which are incubated by both sexes. The eggs hatch after 26 to 28 days. Both sexes attend the ducklings and usually keep them hidden in reeds. The chicks have dark down above and yellow down below. They fledge after two months.

== Conservation ==
The white-faced whistling duck is one of the species to which the &quot;Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds&quot; (AEWA) applies.

<text>United Kingdom Commando Force (UKCF), previously called 3 Commando Brigade (3 Cdo Bde), is the UK&#x27;s special operations-capable commando formation of the Royal Marines. It is composed of Royal Marine Commandos and commando qualified personnel from the Royal Navy, British Army and Royal Air Force.

The brigade was formed 1 September 1943 at Dorchester with personnel from 102 RM Brigade, during the Second World War, with a mixture of Army Commando and Royal Marine Commando units, and was deployed to the South-East Asian Theatre of World War II to conduct operations against the invading forces of Imperial Japan, such as the Burma Campaign. After the Second World War, the Army Commandos were disbanded and the brigade became a Royal Marine formation. Recently, United Kingdom Commando Force has again become a mixed formation with the addition of commando qualified soldiers from the Royal Artillery and Royal Engineers to provide support for the Royal Marine Commandos. Since the end of the Second World War, it has been involved in a number of engagements such as the Suez Crisis, Falklands War, Gulf War and the War in Afghanistan.

==History==
===Second World War===
Between September and November 1943, in Scotland, 102nd Brigade, Royal Marines Division, was detached from the division, to form the independent 3rd Special Service Brigade – a joint British Army-Royal Marines formation. The founding commander was Brigadier Wilfrid Nonweiler and it was composed of the following units:
* No. 1 Commando (Army);
* No. 5 Commando (Army);
* No. 42 Commando (Royal Marines); and
* No. 44 Commando (Royal Marines).
Nos. 1 and 5 Commandos had already earned battle honours as units in, respectively, the North African and Madagascar campaigns. Because &quot;Commando&quot;, at the time, implied a company/battalion-sized unit, the name &quot;Special Service&quot; was instead used for British commando brigades. (However, the term &quot;Commando Brigade&quot; was often used informally, because &quot;Special Service&quot; was unpopular and had a superficial similarity to the name of the notorious German Schutzstaffel (SS).) The brigade was later officially renamed 3rd Commando Brigade.

On 10 November 1943, elements of the brigade embarked at Gourock, bound for India. It was intended that the brigade would be used in operations against Japanese forces in the South-East Asia theatre, such as the Burma campaign. However, the limited shipping capacity available at the time meant that the relocation was prolonged and the components of the brigade were not reunited until late 1944. Lt Col. Peter Young was transferred from the Normandy campaign to become second-in-command of 3rd Commando Brigade. Young succeeded Nonweiler as commander of the brigade.

During January 1945, the brigade was involved in the campaign to recapture Arakan, including the battles of Myebon peninsula and Kangaw. The brigade was then withdrawn to India to prepare for Operation Zipper, a proposed amphibious operation to recapture the Malayan peninsula. The atomic bombs against Japan precipitated an earlier surrender of Japan than expected. The 3rd Commando Brigade moved to secure Hong Kong – a British crown colony that was under Japanese occupation in 1941–45. During 1946, British Army personnel and units within the 3rd Commando Brigade were demobilised or transferred elsewhere and it became a Royal Marine formation.

===Post Second World War===
3 Commando Brigade&#x27;s most high-profile operation after the war was the Suez Crisis, when it took part in the amphibious assault against Egyptian targets. During Operation Musketeer, units of the brigade made a helicopter-borne assault.
1971 saw the withdrawal of British forces from the Far East and Persian Gulf. The brigade returned to the UK with other British units. It moved to Stonehouse Barracks in Plymouth, where it remains to this day.

===Operation Corporate===
The brigade&#x27;s next large operation was in 1982. Argentina invaded the Falkland Islands, and 3 Commando Brigade, reinforced by 2 Para and 3 Para, was one of the two main British land formations that took part in operations to recapture the islands. The brigade landed at San Carlos Water and marched across East Falkland to Stanley. Argentine units were defeated in several sharp engagements, and their forces surrendered on 14 June.

===Gulf War===
In the aftermath of the 1991 Gulf War, the brigade was deployed on a non-combat task in northern Iraq. The Iraqi Kurds had suffered immensely during the war and in its aftermath, and the brigade was used due to its rapid deployment ability. It provided humanitarian aid to the Kurds and saved many from starvation.

===21st century===
Recently, the brigade has been involved in two major campaigns, including Operation Veritas in Afghanistan, 2001 and 2002, and Operation Telic during the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Iraq, however, saw heavy fighting occur in the early stages of the campaign, as the brigade made its first amphibious assault in over 20 years by landing on the Al-Faw peninsula in south-east Iraq. In 2006, the brigade returned to Afghanistan on Operation Herrick, replacing 16 Air Assault Brigade, where intense fighting occurred. 

In 2022, 3 Commando Brigade was rebranded to the United Kingdom Commando Force (UKCF), a process that started in 2020 and completed in 2024.

==Organisation==
The UK Commando Force contains Royal Marines, Royal Navy, Army and Royal Air Force personnel. When operating as part of the combined United Kingdom / Netherlands Landing Force, the 1st Marine Combat Group of the Dutch Korps Mariniers is also attached to the brigade.

==Amphibious Task Group==

Formerly known as the Amphibious Ready Group, the Amphibious Task Group (ATG) is a mobile, balanced amphibious warfare force, based on a Commando Group and its supporting assets, that can be kept at high readiness to deploy into an area of operations. The ATG was normally based around specialist amphibious ships, such as the former , the only helicopter carrier in the British fleet until she was decommissioned and sold to Brazil in 2018. &quot;Ocean&quot; was designed and built to accommodate an embarked commando and its associated stores and equipment. The strategy of the ATG is to wait &quot;beyond the horizon&quot; and then deploy swiftly as directed by HM Government. The whole amphibious force is intended to be self-sustaining and capable of operating without host-nation support. The concept was successfully tested in operations in Sierra Leone.

Since the disposal of both HMS &quot;Ocean&quot; and, in 2024/25, the Albion class assault ships, British amphibious forces are reliant on deployment from the Queen Elizabeth class aircraft carriers and from amphibious warfare vessels of the Royal Fleet Auxiliary. Aircraft of the Commando Helicopter Force can be accommodated on these vessels.

==Commando Helicopter Force==
The Commando Helicopter Force (CHF) forms part of the Fleet Air Arm. It comprises three helicopter squadrons and is commanded by Joint Aviation Command (JAC).

CHF is neither under the permanent control of Headquarters Commando Forces nor that of the Commandant General Royal Marines, but rather is allocated to support Commando units as required by JAC. It uses both Merlin HC4/4A medium-lift and Wildcat AH1 light transport/reconnaissance helicopters to provide aviation support to Commando Forces.

<text>Irvin Leigh Matus (July 25, 1941 – January 5, 2011) was an independent scholar, autodidact, and author. He is best known as an authority on Shakespeare, but also wrote about aspects of Brooklyn&#x27;s history such as the Vitagraph Studios, and developed a method of modelling baseball statistics. He was a scholar-in-residence at Shepherd University for the academic year 1992–1993. He was based in Washington, DC.

==Early life==
Matus&#x27;s father was manager of the Western Union office in Times Square. The late congressman Stephen J. Solarz was his cousin. Matus was born and raised in Brooklyn, New York, where he lived until 1971. He graduated from Erasmus Hall High School in 1958, and briefly studied commercial art at the Pratt Institute in New York. His primary interests at the time focused on baseball, American history and rhythm and blues, his musical interests being influenced by his early friendship with Alan Freed. Together with his brother Paul he ran an urban transport business until he was drafted in 1965 into United States Army. Stationed on Staten Island, he won the Army Commendation Medal for meritorious service.

==Baseball==
A keen reader of baseball statistics, in 1978 he published an article anticipating what was later to be known as sabermetric analysis, though Matus would distinguish his own methods from the mechanical computerized techniques of contemporary sabermetrics, an approach he characterizes as &quot;the baseball version of Oxfordianism.&quot; The article analysed pitching stats on 162 scorecards for one year, 1976 to examine the view of pitching coaches at the time that 135 pitches (15 per innings) was the average for a complete game. Tom Seaver relied on this standard yardstick in evaluating a pitcher&#x27;s performance, that he is doing well if he throws about 15 pitches per innings. By a close break-down of statistics, based his analysis on average of 14 pitches per inning after six innings, Matus showed that the contrary was the case, and concluded: &quot;The evidence clearly indicates that, for endurance and effectiveness in any given game, 14 pitches or less per innings as an average is preferable for most pitchers.&quot;

At the time of his death, he was working on a comprehensive history of baseball.

==Researching Shakespeare==
His interest in Shakespeare dated back to high school, though he once confessed that his notion of a good read consisted back then of reading a Brooklyn Dodger box-score sheet. Shakespeare classes tortured him for the impression they gave that Shakespeare wrote footnotes. Yet one day, while walking down Flatbush Avenue, a line—&quot;You blocks, you stones, you worse than senseless things!&quot;—from &quot;Julius Caesar&quot; floated to mind and seemed to sum up the appearance of the crowd he encountered. He suddenly realized that, unwittingly, he had been memorizing large swathes of Shakespeare. He became a dedicated Shakespearean shortly afterwards, on watching Richard Burton&#x27;s performance as Edwin Booth in the film &quot;Prince of Players&quot;.

===&quot;Shakespeare, the Living Record&quot;===
Matus would read the history plays together with biographies of the kings they featured, and discovered, from earlier period tourist brochures, an article by A.L. Rowse and one by Louis Wright, past director of the Folger Shakespeare Library, that the artifacts and physical environment of Shakespeare&#x27;s life were poorly represented. In 1983, impressed by reading a book on English architecture, he scoured the libraries to find information linking Elizabethan buildings to Shakespeare, only to find that virtually no good reference books had been written. After a brief trip to England for roughly six weeks in 1984, he and his brother Paul sold their home on Long Island, and Matus used his proceeds to finance his research project on this topic—which entailed a second 6-month journey in a camper van—to examine buildings on-site and interview archivists, preservationists, and historians. Returning to the United States in November 1985, he moved to Washington to finalize his research by reading in the Folger Library. There Samuel Schoenbaum, the doyen of Shakespearean biographers, assisted him in securing access to its restricted collections.

Almost wholly self-financed, Matus eked out a living by working part-time jobs, while finding accommodation as a house-sitter. In June, 1987, he received a $2,500 grant that allowed him to buy a $650 word processor and begin his writing. Shakespearean scholar Richard Dutton read his manuscript, and submitted it to Macmillan, remarking that:

It&#x27;s very thorough, archival, back-to-the-grass-roots, trust-nothing, find-the-first-sources scholarship... And so little scholarship is like that. He&#x27;s done an amazing job of collecting that sort of information.

In the meantime he published an article, &quot;An Early Reference to the Coventry Corpus Christi Pageants in Shakespeare?&quot; suggesting a possible source for Shakespeare&#x27;s metaphor, in &quot;The Tragedy of King Richard III&quot;, of the &quot;worm of conscience&quot; in the Doomsday play of the Drapers&#x27; Guild in 1561.

The resulting book, &quot;Shakespeare, the Living Record &quot;, published by Palgrave Macmillan in 1991, took the form of a travelogue of modern-day England pertaining to persons and places associated with Shakespeare or mentioned in his plays. Stanley Wells thought this &#x27;freelance&#x27; contribution sounded &#x27;refreshingly up-to-date&#x27;.

===The Shakespeare authorship question: &quot;Shakespeare, In Fact&quot;===
In February 1989 he was asked by the Shakespeare Authorship Roundtable to investigate the scholarship of the Shakespeare authorship controversy and was invited to speak to the membership in Los Angeles about his findings. Matus, according to Jonathan Bate, came to the controversy as an agnostic. Up until this particular research interest emerged, his interest in Shakespeare had been almost entirely focused on the plays, not their author. He flew to Los Angeles in August 1989 and spent two months there. His visit culminated in an address he delivered to members of the Roundtable in September, in which he remarked that, though he found the members honest, thoughtful, gracious, and cordial, his research found much fault with Oxfordian scholarship and led him to the conclusion that William Shakespeare was the true author of the works.

Matus then turned to write a comprehensive book on the Shakespearean authorship question. He returned to England in 1993 for another five months, primarily to research in the British Library. In Matus&#x27;s view, the long history of the debate in public controversy and both amateurish and professional speculation had been usually ignored by scholars. He defended his method by arguing for the following principle:

It is the rule of controversialist scholarship, the error rate of which hovers around 100 percent, that a single flaw in a work of orthodox scholarship, whether perceived or actual—or fabricated—is sufficient in their eyes to cast doubt upon the accuracy and authenticity of the entire work.

He took the &quot;Stratfordian&quot; perspective, advocating the orthodox view that William Shakespeare of Stratford-on-Avon, was the primary author of the plays attributed to him. Matus went on to defend this position against the Oxfordian theory, in the October 1991 issue of &quot;The Atlantic Monthly&quot; as part of a print debate written by advocates of both sides. He did the same in an article published as part of a similar debate in the April 1999 issue of Harper&#x27;s Magazine.

In &quot;Shakespeare, In Fact&quot;, Matus examined Oxfordian arguments, presenting both detailed rebuttals of the sceptical perspective and positive evidence for Shakespeare&#x27;s authorship. On its publication, Shakespeare scholar Thomas Pendleton hailed the work as the most authoritative on the subject. Writer Scott McCrea has praised it for its &quot;original and valuable scholarship&quot;, while James S. Shapiro has recently referred &quot;those interested in the strongest arguments in favor of Shakespeare’s authorship&quot; to Matus&#x27;s book. Gail Kern Paster, director of the Washington, DC–based Folger Shakespeare Library, judging its contribution more broadly, has written that &quot;Shakespeare, in Fact&quot; is recognized as &quot;a reliable, trustworthy, and authoritative source for what we know for sure about Shakespeare.&quot; Dover Books reissued &quot;Shakespeare, In Fact&quot; in 2013, with a new introduction by Thomas Mann, former reference librarian at the Library of Congress.

While working on &quot;Shakespeare, In Fact&quot; Matus also investigated a different authorship question: Charles Hamilton&#x27;s claim that he had found &quot;Cardenio&quot;—a lost play by Shakespeare. The play turned out to be the playhouse copy of Thomas Middleton&#x27;s &quot;The Second Maiden&#x27;s Tragedy,&quot; and Matus reviewed Hamilton&#x27;s book for the &quot;Times Literary Supplement&quot;.

==Later years==
Matus lived in great dignity on an income substantially under $4,000 per annum in his later years. His brilliant conversation, gentleness with fellows and with the creaturely world, and resolute integrity in the face of hard circumstances, is fondly remembered by those who had the opportunity to know him.

<text>Wood Buffalo National Park is the largest national park of Canada at . It is in northeastern Alberta and the southern Northwest Territories. Larger in area than Switzerland, it is the second-largest national park in the world. The park was established in 1922 to protect the world&#x27;s largest herd of free-roaming wood bison. They became hybridized after the introduction of plains bison. The population is currently estimated at 3,000. It is one of two known nesting sites of whooping cranes.

The park ranges in elevation from at the Little Buffalo River to in the Caribou Mountains. The park headquarters is in Fort Smith, with a smaller satellite office in Fort Chipewyan, Alberta. The park contains one of the world&#x27;s largest fresh-water deltas, the Peace-Athabasca Delta, formed by the Peace, Athabasca and Birch rivers.

It is also known for its karst sinkholes in the north-eastern section of the park. Alberta&#x27;s largest springs (by volume, with an estimated discharge rate of eight cubic metres per second), Neon Lake Springs, are in the Jackfish River drainage. Wood Buffalo is located directly north of the Athabasca Oil Sands.

This area was designated in 1983 as a UNESCO World Heritage Site for the biological diversity of the Peace-Athabasca Delta, and for the population of wild bison. It is the most ecologically complete and largest example of the Great Plains-Boreal grassland ecosystem of North America.

On June 28, 2013, the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada designated Wood Buffalo National Park as Canada&#x27;s newest and the world&#x27;s largest dark-sky preserve. The designation helps preserve nighttime ecology for the park&#x27;s large populations of bats, night hawks and owls, as well as providing opportunities for visitors to experience the northern lights.

== History ==

=== Before the park ===

This region has been inhabited by human cultures since the end of the last ice age. Aboriginal peoples in this region have followed variations on the subarctic lifeway, based around hunting, fishing, and gathering. Situated at the junction of three major rivers used as canoe routes for trade: the Athabasca, Peace and Slave rivers, the region that later was defined as the national park was well travelled by indigenous peoples for millennia.

In recorded times, the Dane-zaa (historically called the Beaver tribe), the Chipewyan people, the South Slavey (Dene Thaʼ), and Woods Cree people inhabited the region, where they sometimes competed for resources and trade. The Dane-zaa, Chipewyan, and South Slavey speak (or spoke) languages from the Northern Athabaskan family. These languages are common also among the peoples in the regions to the north and west of the park, who call themselves the Dene collectively. The Cree, by contrast, are an Algonquian people. They are thought to have migrated here from the east within the timeframe of recorded history, as most Algonquian-speaking peoples are along the Atlantic coast, from Canada and south through much of the United States.

Sometime after 1781, when a smallpox epidemic decimated the region, the Dene and Cree made a peace treaty at Peace Point through a ceremonial pipe ceremony. This is the origin of the name of the Peace River that flows through the region: the river was used to define a boundary between the Dane-zaa to the North and the Cree to the South.

Explorer Peter Pond is believed to have passed through the region in 1785, likely the first European to do so, followed by Alexander Mackenzie three years later. In 1788 British fur traders established posts at Fort Chipewyan, just east of the current boundaries of the park, and Fort Vermilion close to the west. Fur traders followed the First Nations in using the Peace River as part of their network of canoe routes for the North American fur trade. The Métis people, descendants initially of European traders and indigenous women, developed as another major ethnic group in the region.

After nearly another century of domination by the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company, Canada purchased the company&#x27;s claim to the region. Agriculture was never developed in this part of Western Canada, unlike to the south. Hunting and trapping remained the dominant industry in this region well into the 20th century, and are still vital to many of its inhabitants. Following the Klondike Gold Rush of 1897, the Canadian government was keen to extinguish Aboriginal title to the land. It wanted to be able to exploit any mineral wealth found in the future without having to contend with possible objections from First Nations. The Crown signed Treaty 8 with these peoples on 21 June 1899, acquiring much of the territory as Crown land.

=== As a national park ===

Established in 1922, the park was created on Crown land acquired through Treaty 8 between Canada and the local First Nations. The park completely surrounds several Indian reserves such as Peace Point and ʔejëre Kʼelnı Kuę́ (also called Hay Camp).

Despite protests from biologists, between 1925 and 1928 the government relocated nearly 6,700 plains bison here from Buffalo National Park, to avoid unwanted mass culling at the latter park due to over-population there. The plains bison hybridized with the local 1,500–2,000 wood bison, and carried such diseases as bovine tuberculosis and brucellosis, which they introduced into the wood bison herd. Since that time park officials have tried to undo this damage, making successive culls of diseased animals.

In 1957, a healthy and relatively pure wood bison herd of 200 was discovered near Nyarling River. In 1965, 23 of these bison were relocated to the south side of Elk Island National Park. Today, they number 300 and are the most genetically pure wood bison remaining.

Between 1951 and 1967, 4000 bison were killed and of meat were sold from a special abattoir built at Hay Camp. These smaller culls did not eradicate the diseases. In 1990, the government announced a plan to destroy the entire herd and restock the park with disease-free bison from Elk Island National Park. The public quickly reacted negatively to this plan and it was abandoned.

Local governance within the Alberta portion of Wood Buffalo National Park was introduced on January 1, 1967, with the incorporation of an improvement district. Originally numbered as Improvement District No. 150, it was renumbered as Improvement District No. 24 on January 1, 1969.

In 1983, a 21-year lease was granted to Canadian Forest Products Ltd. to log a 50,000-hectare area of Wood Buffalo National Park. The Canadian Parks and Wilderness Society filed a lawsuit against Parks Canada for violating the &quot;National Parks Act&quot;. Before the trial commenced in 1992, Parks Canada acquiesced and recognized that the lease was invalid and unauthorized by the provisions of the act.

In March 2019, Kitaskino Nuwenëné Wildland Provincial Park was established on the borders of Wood Buffalo National Park. The Mikisew Cree First Nation had first proposed protecting this land as a park. It preserves the natural ecosystems from the expanding industrial areas north of Fort McMurray. The park was created after three oil companies, Teck Resources, Cenovus Energy, and Imperial Oil, voluntarily gave up certain oilsands and mining leases in the area, following negotiations with the Alberta government and Indigenous groups. This provincial park is closed to forestry and new energy projects. But existing wells can keep producing, and traditional Indigenous land uses are allowed.

In June 2019, UNESCO expressed concerns about the management of the park&#x27;s ecological health and Indigenous usage, noting decline in water quality. It warned the park that it could be delisted from the World Heritage List if conditions deteriorated too much. In response Canada announced allocating $27.5 million to solve the problems. UNESCO questioned the plan and has not lifted the potential delisting of the park. The World Heritage Committee will review Canada&#x27;s report and plan for preserving the park in 2021.

==Climate==
In the park, summers are very short, but days are long. Temperatures range between during this season. On average, summers are characterized by warm and dry days; in some years, there may be a pattern of cool and wet days. The mean high in July is while the mean low is . Fall tends to have cool, windy and dry days, and the first snowfall usually occurs in October. Winters are cold with temperatures that can drop below in January and February, the coldest months. The mean high in January is while the mean low is . In spring, temperatures gradually warm up as the days become longer.

== Wildlife ==
Wood Buffalo National Park contains a large variety of wildlife species, including American black bears, American martens, bald eagles, Canada lynxes, great grey owls, hawks, marmots, North American beavers, Northwestern wolves, peregrine falcons, red foxes, ruffed grouses, sandhill cranes, snowshoe hares, snowy owls, Western moose, whooping cranes, wolverines, wood bisons, and the world&#x27;s northernmost population of Red-sided Garter snakes, which form communal dens within the park. Grizzly bears, North American cougars, feral horses, and muskoxen have been recorded within and in the vicinity of the park.

Wood Buffalo Park contains the only natural nesting habitat for the endangered whooping crane. Known as Whooping Crane Summer Range, it is classified as a Ramsar site. It was identified through the International Biological Program. The range is a complex of contiguous water bodies, primarily lakes and various wetlands, such as marshes and bogs, but also includes streams and ponds.

In 2007, the world&#x27;s largest beaver dam – about in length – was discovered in the park using satellite imagery. The dam, at , about from Fort Chipewyan, had only been sighted by satellite and fixed-wing aircraft since July 2014.

===Hybrid bison===
As above-mentioned, &quot;wood bison&quot; in the park are hybrid descendants, the product of unions with plains bison that were transferred to the park in the 1920s from Buffalo National Park. The plains bison were more numerous and were found to have been carrying diseases that became established among the bison in the park. That, plus the hybridization that ensued, threatened the survival of true wood bison. A 1995 study detected that there have been notable differences in morphology among each herd within the park, which have developed different degrees of hybridization. The herd at the Sweetgrass Station near Peace–Athabasca Delta, followed by Slave River Lowlands herd, preserve a phenotype closer to the original wood bison before the 1920s. They are more true to the original types than the preserved herds at Elk Island National Park and Mackenzie Bison Sanctuary.

==Transportation==
Year-round access is available to Fort Smith by road on the Mackenzie Highway, which connects to Highway 5 near Hay River. Commercial flights are available to Fort Smith and Fort Chipewyan from Edmonton. Winter access is also available using winter and ice roads from Fort McMurray through Fort Chipewyan.

<doc id="448820" wikidata="Q8029303" url="?curid=448820" title="Wok with Yan">
<text>Wok with Yan is a Chinese cuisine cooking show starring Stephen Yan. The show was first produced in Vancouver, British Columbia by CTV affiliate BCTV as a weekly show, &quot;Yan&#x27;s Woking&quot;, for two seasons before moving to CBC in 1980 as a daily show, &quot;Wok With Yan&quot; The show was also sold into syndication, with new episodes being produced until 1995. &quot;Wok With Yan&quot; was co-produced by Carleton Productions in Ottawa, which had previously produced &quot;The Galloping Gourmet&quot; and &quot;Celebrity Cooks&quot;, and Stephen Yan Productions, and was taped at CJOH&#x27;s studios in Ottawa for two seasons before moving production to CBC Vancouver.

==Format==
A running gag featured on the show was Yan&#x27;s wearing of an apron featuring a different pun on the word &quot;wok.&quot; Some examples are:

*Wok &amp; Roll
*Wokking My Baby Back Home
*Danger, Yan at Wok
*Wok Around the Clock
*Wok the Heck
*You Are Wok You Eat
*Wok Goes up Must Come Down
*Wok&#x27;s New, Pussycat?
*Wokkey Night in Canada
*Stuck Between a Wok and a Hard Place
*Raiders of The Lost Wok
*Eat Your Wok Out
*Moon Wok
*Wok Your Butts Off
*Jailhouse Wok
*Superior Wokmanship
*Wok-A-Doodle-Doo
*Wok Before You Run
*Wok Me Amadeus
*Wok up Little Susie
*Wok Don&#x27;t Run
*Don&#x27;t Wok The Boat
*101 Ways to Wok the Dog
The humorous aprons also complemented his humour that consisted of spontaneous one-liners spoken with his trademark Cantonese accent or him playing with his food or cookware. That, combined with his energetic personality, endeared him to Canadian viewers. Prior to him preparing his stir fry cuisine, the show usually featured a vignette of Yan travelling to different vacation spots from around the world (e.g., Thailand). He always invited an audience member to come up and eat with him near the end of each episode (there was a ticket draw in the studio audience to sit with him), and had a fortune cookie reading before the meal (first done in Cantonese, then translated in English).

Later sources have occasionally confused the show with &quot;Yan Can Cook&quot;, an American series hosted by Martin Yan which also aired during the 1980s, but which originated in Canada as &quot;Yan Can&quot;. Martin Yan worked for Stephen Yan for a year in the 1970s as was trained by Stephen Yan as one of his &#x27;Flying Squad&#x27; of six chefs who flew across Canada to do demonstrations in Chinese cooking at major events such as the Calgary Stampede and Edmonton&#x27;s Klondike Days as well as in department stores.

<doc id="448821" wikidata="Q3121493" url="?curid=448821" title="Oral Roberts University">
<text>Oral Roberts University (ORU) is a private evangelical university in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Founded in 1963, the university is named after its founder, Charismatic Christian preacher Oral Roberts.

Sitting on a campus, ORU offers over 70 undergraduate degree programs along with 20 graduate programs across six colleges. ORU is classified among &quot;Master&#x27;s Colleges &amp; Universities: Medium Programs&quot;. The university enrolls approximately 5,000 students.

== History ==

===Foundation and early years===

Ground was officially broken for Oral Roberts University in 1962 in Tulsa, Oklahoma. The university received its charter the following year from the State of Oklahoma and Oral Roberts University officially opened in 1965 with an enrollment of 300 students and seven major completed buildings. The university was founded by Oral Roberts &quot;as a result of the evangelist Oral Roberts&#x27; obeying God&#x27;s mandate to build a university on God&#x27;s authority and the Holy Spirit. God&#x27;s commission to Oral Roberts was to &#x27;Raise up your students to hear My voice, to go where My light is dim, where My voice is heard small, and My healing power is not known, even to the uttermost bounds of the earth. Their work will exceed yours, and in this I am well pleased&#x27;.&quot; Roberts placed special importance on the Prayer Tower, even though the concept of a building specifically dedicated to prayer at the center of the campus caused considerable tension, as some academic leaders were afraid the school would be unable to receive accreditation with such a building. But the tower, designed by architect Frank Wallace, was completed in 1967 at a cost of $2 million, a further source of contention. After its completion, Roberts called for a three-day period of prayer and fasting. At the university&#x27;s dedication ceremony in 1967, the evangelist Billy Graham was the keynote speaker.

The first partial graduation took place in 1968 and the first full graduation in 1969. In 1971, Oral Roberts University was accredited by the North Central Association.

ORU was accredited in 1971 by the Higher Learning Commission of the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools. It is also accredited by the Association of Theological Schools in the United States and Canada.

During the first decade of the school&#x27;s existence many of the campus&#x27;s iconic structures were completed, such as the Howard Auditorium, the Graduate Center, the Mabee Center, and Christ&#x27;s Chapel.

The O. W. Coburn School of Law opened in 1979. In 1986 the university &quot;shut down its ailing law school and sent its library to Pat Robertson&#x27;s Bible-based college in Virginia&quot;, which subsequently founded the Regent University School of Law.

===Campus expansion and later years===

The university built the City of Faith Medical and Research Center hospital in 1981 and started the Oral Roberts University School of Medicine in 1978. Severe financial difficulties with both of these institutions led to their closure in 1989. Oral Roberts&#x27;s son Richard was named president in 1993.

In January 1996, Golden Eagle Broadcasting, a small digital satellite Christian and family programming television network owned and operated by Oral Roberts University, was founded.

On February 5, 1997, several ORU students reportedly disrupted services at a mosque near the University of Tulsa. The students mistakenly thought it was the 27th night of Ramadan when it was actually the 28th day of Ramadan. A university spokesman indicated that the students would not be disciplined and that university officials were discussing with the students their accounts of the events, which differed from what those attending services at the mosque reported. On February 7, 1997, the Islamic Society of Tulsa received a formal apology from Reverend Bill Shuler, who led religious services on campus.

Due to alleged discrimination against LGBT students at ORU, Soulforce placed the university on its 2006 Equality Ride route, with a rally taking place on March 20, 2006. Soulforce members objected to the university&#x27;s honor code pledge&#x27;s ban on homosexual activity. All students are required to sign and abide by the honor code which places the same restriction on all sexual activity outside &quot;traditional marriage of one man and one woman.&quot;
In February 2007, ORU announced that it would offer new art degrees.
In 2010, ORU teamed up with the National Hispanic Christian Leadership Conference to open a bilingual Hispanic Center on campus. The goals of this partnership include targeting a 25% Hispanic population within the student body and to reduce the approximately 50% high school dropout rate among Hispanic students.

ORU was granted an exception to Title IX in 2017 which allows it to legally discriminate against LGBT students for religious reasons. It is ranked among the &quot;Absolute Worst Campuses for LGBTQ Youth&quot; by Campus Pride.

ORU and G12 Vision announced in 2019 they had reached an agreement over a partnership. It was hoped that the agreement would make ORU&#x27;s theological education more accessible worldwide.

ORU moved to virtual classes for the remainder of the 2020 spring semester after the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. In fall 2020, students were required to get tested for COVID-19 before moving into the dorms. All students and staff were required to wear masks on campus at all times. The university also rearranged class schedules in order for the semester to end early.

In 2021, the university expanded its campus through the addition of 3 new buildings: a welcome center (which broke ground in April), Media Arts Center, and library. The expansion was part of ORU&#x27;s $75 million campaign, which allocated $60 million to these new structures with the remainder going towards student scholarships. ORU also announced in April 2021 the development of the Mike Carter Athletic Center, which is expected to be over 40,000 square feet, and renovation of the Mabee Center.

=== Resignation of Richard Roberts ===
In October 2007, three former professors filed a wrongful termination lawsuit against ORU in Tulsa County. The professors also alleged university president Richard Roberts misused university assets and illegally ordered the university to participate in Republican candidate Randi Miller&#x27;s political campaign for Tulsa mayor.
Lindsay Roberts, the wife of Richard Roberts, was accused of spending university funds on clothes, awarding nonacademic scholarships to the children of family friends and sending text messages on university-issued cell phones to &quot;underage males.&quot; The lawsuit also alleged a longtime maintenance employee was fired for the purpose of giving the job to an underage male friend of Lindsay Roberts.

The plaintiffs filed an amended lawsuit adding the university&#x27;s Board of Regents (Oral and Richard Roberts, along with George Pearsons, Kenneth Copeland, Creflo Dollar, Michael A. Hammer, John Hagee, Marilyn Hickey, Jerry Savelle and Charles Watson) to the suit and alleged that Roberts fired the university&#x27;s financial comptroller and &quot;voluminous materials and documents were shredded and destroyed, constituting spoliation of evidence.&quot; The filing also alleged Lindsay Roberts had spent nights in the ORU guest house with a 16-year-old male who also was allowed to live in the Roberts family residence on campus.

On October 17, 2007, Richard Roberts announced a &quot;temporary leave of absence&quot; as president of the university, citing the &quot;toll&quot; the lawsuit and attendant allegations had taken on him and his family. Billy Joe Daugherty became Executive Regent of the Board of Regents and Interim President. Chairman of the Board George Pearsons noted the temporary resignation was not an admission of guilt.

In November 2007, the tenured faculty of Oral Roberts University approved by a simple majority a non-binding vote of no confidence in Richard Roberts. Roberts tendered his letter of resignation to the board of regents on November 23. Pearsons said the university planned to separate its finances and leadership from the Oral Roberts Evangelistic Association, to the apparent relief of many students and faculty members. On January 10, 2008, ORU settled with plaintiff John Swails, who was reinstated to his previous teaching position. The school also announced a formal search committee for a new president, to be headed by board of regents member and Tulsa resident Glenda Payas.

Tulsa evangelist Billy Joe Daugherty was named interim President and executive regent. The same month, the school was reportedly &quot;struggling financially&quot; with over $50 million in debt.

=== Finances ===
ORU&#x27;s operating budget for 2007-08 was over $82 million. On January 14, 2008, ORU&#x27;s board of regents voted unanimously to accept $62 million from the Mart Green family, the owners of Oklahoma City-based Hobby Lobby, Mardel educational, and various Christian supply stores, an offer which included changes to the university&#x27;s governing board. In October of that year, an ORU spokesman said the university was still $52.5 million in debt. The school accepted an additional $8 million from the Greens in November. Of the $82 million given to Oral Roberts University, approximately half went toward eliminating its debt. The remaining half was allocated to &quot;campus renovations, technology upgrades, academic enhancement, financial aid for new and returning students, marketing and operations&quot;, according to the university website. In February 2008, the Renewing the Vision campaign was initiated in an effort to erase this debt. To free the university from its burgeoning debt, the board of trustees announced plans for a $25 million matching campaign, in which the board agreed to match dollar-for-dollar all donations. In addition to eliminating debt, funds from the Renewing the Vision campaign contributed to the 2008 summer campus renovations, as well as scholarships provided by the university. During the summer of 2008, $10 million went to campus upgrades and deferred maintenance. Many dormitories were extensively renovated and most other buildings received restoration and upgrades. In January 2009, the university&#x27;s presidential search committee recommended Mark Rutland, President of Southeastern University of the Assemblies of God in Florida, to succeed Richard Roberts, which the trustees approved. On January 14, Rutland confirmed that he had been offered the position and intended to accept it. The university began to implement the employment reduction plans, laying off 53 employees and cutting about 40 unfilled positions. On January 29, 2009, the Green family committed $10.4 million to additional campus renovations and upgrades to take place during summer 2009. Following Mart Green&#x27;s contribution, the university&#x27;s debt was reduced to $25 million.
On April 15, 2009, Chairman of the Armand Hammer Foundation and university trustee Michael Armand Hammer made a $1 million donation to the school&#x27;s Whole Person Scholarship. As of June 3, 2009, donations and pledges had reduced the university&#x27;s debt to $720,000. On September 23, 2009, it was announced at the end of the university&#x27;s chapel service that the school was debt-free. The announcement was made two days before Rutland&#x27;s September 25, 2009 inauguration ceremony, held at the Mabee Center.

In December 2010, ORU announced that the Green family would make another $10 million gift in 2011, to be used for renovations and technology improvements. The gift raised the Greens&#x27; total donations to $110 million.

=== Allegations of LGBTQ discrimination on campus ===
On August 25, 2015, ORU Administration learned of student Sabrina Bradford&#x27;s recent marriage to a woman, and two days later she was informed she was not welcome back on campus. In March 2006 eight peaceful protesters were arrested while rallying across the street from ORU&#x27;s main entrance. Ronnie Roberts, the son of Oral Roberts, came out as gay to the Rev. Troy Perry, founder of the Metropolitan Community Church, in the early 1980s. Six months later, Ronnie Roberts committed suicide. As of December 7, 2021, an online petition to &quot;Tell Oral Roberts University: Change your anti-LGBTQ honor code&quot; had gained over 10,000 signatures. In March 2021, the Religious Exemption Accountability Project, or REAP, filed a class action lawsuit, &quot;Hunter v. the U.S. Department of Education&quot;, on March 26, 2021, against this campus and other named campuses citing the abuses that thousands of LGBTQ+ students endured at these colleges and universities over the years. LGBTQ+ students document their own direct discrimination, harassment and negative harms in the filing. Those abuses include &quot;conversion therapy, expulsion, denial of housing and health care, sexual and physical abuse and harassment.&quot; The abuses also include the &quot;less visible, but no less damaging, consequences of institutionalized shame, fear, anxiety, and loneliness.&quot; On November 1, 2017, president Billy Wilson preached a chapel service entitled, &quot;Holy Sex&quot; and quoted Leviticus 20:13: &quot;If a man has sexual relations with a man as one does with a woman, both of them have done what is detestable, they are put to death.&quot; Within three months of graduation, Andrew Hartzler joined a class-action lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Education, seeking to strike down a religious exemption provision in U.S. civil rights law that allows ORU and other schools to receive federal funds despite such discriminatory policies. The lawsuit contends it is a violation of the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment and of the students&#x27; equal protection rights.

=== Presidential inauguration of William Wilson and recent history ===
On January 31, 2013, ORU announced that William &quot;Billy&quot; Wilson, executive director of the International Center for Spiritual Renewal and vice-chair of the ORU board of trustees, had been selected to succeed Rutland as president, effective July 1, 2013. A day earlier, the ORU student newspaper had briefly posted an erroneous report on its website, mistakenly identifying someone else as the new president. Rutland criticized the report at a student assembly and the newspaper&#x27;s longtime faculty adviser left the school the next day.

In 2018, the university announced that it would retain Wilson as president for 10 years or at least until 2028. Under Wilson&#x27;s presidency, ORU completed a $50 million developmental campaign, which helped construct its Global Learning Center and ONEOK Sports Complex. Student enrollment rose from approximately 3,000 in 2008 to over 4,100 in 2019.

In 2020, the university began its $75 million Impact 2030 campaign, a program focusing on making ORU a &quot;maximum global impact&quot; by 2030. A component of achieving this global impact will be ORU&#x27;s goal of educating students from 195 nations. Fundraising this campaign is due to span over three years and be divided as such: $60 million for buildings, $10 million for international scholarships in order to enroll at least one student from every country around the world, and $5 million for reconverting the university&#x27;s current library into the Center for Global Leadership. The David Green family has promised to match every campaign gift up to $45 million with a 3-to-1 match.

== Campus ==

The campus began construction in 1963 with a futuristic look and architecture, which historian Margaret Grubiak noted as being inspired by the 1933 Chicago World&#x27;s Fair. Architects Stanfield, Imel &amp; Walton of Tulsa designed the 1963 master plan, but most of the buildings were designed by Tulsa architect Frank Wallace. In 1981, the City of Faith Medical and Research Center opened. The buildings were south of the ORU campus, and were originally built as a 60-story clinic, a 30-story hospital, and a 20-story research center. The original tenants left in 1989 because of financial problems and a lack of demand for medical services. As of 2007, some floors (in the 20-story building) have never been leased. The facility is now mostly leased out as commercial office space under the name CityPlex Towers. A 60 ft (18.2 m), 30 ton bronze sculpture &quot;Healing Hands&quot;, by sculptor Leonard McMurray (cast in Ciudad Juárez, Mexico in 1980) and originally in front of the towers, was moved to the ORU campus entrance in the summer of 1991. By 2007, the campus was described as &quot;a perfect representation of the popular modernistic architecture of the time... the set of &quot;The Jetsons&quot;&quot; but also &quot;shabby&quot; and &quot;dated, like Disney&#x27;s Tomorrowland.&quot; Interviewed in 2010, Wallace characterized his ORU buildings as &quot;sculptures&quot;, noting that an inspiration for his artistic sensibility was &quot;whittling since I was a kid&quot;. It has also been suggested that the buildings may have been inspired by Tulsa&#x27;s art deco architectural heritage, along with Bruce Goff&#x27;s individualistic style and creative use of new materials.

Maintenance of the many unique but aging buildings, structures, and architectural details on campus was cited as a growing problem for the university. In 2008, $10 million was set aside from Green family donations for long-deferred maintenance on many campus buildings, along with the Prayer Tower. The Green family donated another $10 million for work during the summer of 2009.

In 2011, the Prayer Tower was renovated and returned to its original function as a place for prayer.

ORU opened its Global Learning Center and the ONEOK Sports Complex, a track stadium with tennis courts in 2017. The campus added its first student housing since 1976, the Niko Njotorahardjo Residence Hall, in 2019. It also started a $75 million fund for scholarships and campus expansion.
The front entrance onto campus is a divided, landscaped roadway, originally called The Avenue of Flags and now renamed Billy Joe Daugherty circle, lined with lighted flags representing the more than 60 nations from which ORU students have come.

The main academic building is the John D. Messick Learning Resource Center / Marajen Chinigo Graduate Center, an immense 900,000 square foot (80,000 m2) facility with many pylon-like columns, gold-tinted windows and a lozenge-shaped footprint that university publicity says was styled after King Solomon&#x27;s Temple. The Howard Auditorium is a gold, Buckminster Fuller-style geodesic dome used for movies, theatre productions, classes and seminars. Biweekly university chapel services are held in Christ&#x27;s Chapel, a 3,500-seat building constructed in drape-like fashion as an echo of Oral Roberts&#x27;s early tent revivals. The Googie style Prayer Tower at the center of campus was intended to resemble &quot;an abstract cross and Crown of Thorns&quot; and also houses a visitor center. The Mabee Center is an 11,000-seat arena on the southwestern edge of campus and is used for basketball games, concerts, church services and satellite television productions. Timko-Barton Hall houses musical and theatrical performance halls as well as classrooms devoted to the university&#x27;s programs in the performing arts. The building&#x27;s performance halls are often the scene of concerts and recitals by performing arts students.

The Kenneth H. Cooper Aerobics Center houses basketball courts, an elevated running track, a free-weights and exercise room, a swimming pool and classrooms for students who are enrolled in health fitness courses (a requirement for all students). J.L. Johnson Stadium is a 2,200 seat baseball stadium located on the north of the campus.

The Armand Hammer Alumni-Student Center was designed by KSQ Architects, PC, and constructed and completed in 2013. It is the first building to be built on the ORU campus in decades. It totes the largest TV in Oklahoma, a &quot;living room&quot; for students, a gaming center equipped with Wiis and Xboxes, pool tables, ping pong, and more. The building is a modern design fitting for the campus. Students also enjoy addition restaurants and a coffee shop. The Armand Hammer Student-Alumni Center also houses student government offices as well as board rooms for special meetings. No classes meet in this building; it is strictly for the use and enjoyment of the student body.

The Hamill Student Center is between Ellis Melvin Roberts and Claudius Priscilla Roberts Halls and houses restaurants on its lower level. Zoppelt Auditorium is on the ground level and is often used as a lecture hall for classes, forums and special events. Campus Security and the &quot;Fireside Room&quot; are also on ground level with the university cafeteria (called &quot;Saga&quot; by students) on the upper level.

=== Housing ===
There are eight residence halls on campus. The university has strict guidelines concerning student access to the upper floors of residence halls by members of the opposite sex, which is limited to designated occasions called &quot;Open Dorms.&quot;

* Claudius Priscilla Roberts Hall is a seven-story building built in 1965 that can house up to 600 women. Called &quot;Claudius&quot; by students, the building is named after Oral Roberts&#x27;s mother.
* Ellis Melvin Roberts Hall is a seven-story building also built in 1967 that can house up to 600 men. Called &quot;EMR&quot; by campus residents, this dormitory is similar to Claudius Priscilla Roberts Hall but has some differences, notably walls made of concrete blocks rather than sheet rock, two elevators instead of one and laundry facilities in the basement instead of on every floor. According to the university, these two tri-winged buildings are meant to reflect the Trinity.

* Frances Cardone Hall (originally Ethel Hughes Hall) is a 12-story building for up to 372 women. This is one of the four &quot;Towers&quot; dormitories, meant to represent the Star of David. The building is called &quot;Frances&quot; by university students.
* Michael Cardone, Sr. Hall (originally Edward Hughes Hall) is the twin dormitory to Frances and houses up to 372 men. It is linked to the three other Towers dormitories by a central hallway and the main lobby area, called the &quot;Fishbowl&quot; for its glass exterior walls.
* Susie Vinson Hall is one of two shorter &quot;Towers&quot; housing 244 women on eight stories and known as &quot;Susie.&quot;
* Wesley Leuhring Hall, called &quot;Wesley&quot; by students, is the twin dormitory of &quot;Susie&quot; and is alike in both capacity and design. In the summer of 2017, Wesley was converted into a women&#x27;s dorm and was to be called &quot;Susie North.&quot;
* Gabrielle Christian Salem Hall is a three-story split-level dormitory west of Timko-Barton Hall and called &quot;Gabby&quot; by the students. It can house up to 240 women and has secured doors that open using university-issued cards. There are in-room bathroom facilities on the first and second floors.
* Niko Njotorahardjo Hall, named after the founder and senior pastor of an Indonesian church and ministry, opened for the fall 2019 semester. It was ORU&#x27;s first new student housing project since 1976 and contains 240 beds in apartment and dorm style rooms.

===Chapel===
The university has weekly chapel services in Christ&#x27;s Chapel, which are recorded and broadcast live through the university&#x27;s television station and also via satellite.

A typical chapel service features contemporary worship, a missions offering, special music, and a sermon, typically from President William Wilson, as well as special guests, including some of the world&#x27;s biggest and most well-known pastors, evangelists, and spiritual leaders. Attendance at Chapel is mandatory and attendance is taken by student leadership.

== Academics ==
ORU is accredited by the Higher Learning Commission. Some colleges and programs are accredited by specialized accreditors, including the Association of Collegiate Business Schools and Programs, National Council for Accreditation of Teacher Education, Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology, Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education, and Council on Social Work Education.

In addition to its undergraduate programs, the university also has a graduate seminary and graduate programs in business, education, computer science, and data science.

ORU has signed an early assurance program with the Oklahoma State University Center for Health Sciences in 2011, allowing high achieving students to receive conditional admission to OSU&#x27;s osteopathic medical school program.

From its founding, ORU has placed emphasis on Charismatic doctrines of Christianity; its initial presidential leadership, including Oral Roberts and his son Richard Roberts, also espoused the doctrine of seed faith. This belief was closely connected to fundraising efforts by both Oral and Richard.

While the majority of ORU staff were happy with including other doctrines of faith, some such as Charles Farah have disagreed publicly, indirectly leading to the publishing of a PhD thesis from a student a number of years later about his opinions on seed faith.

== Student life ==

The university&#x27;s residential policy requires all unmarried undergraduate students younger than 23 to live on campus, although exceptions are made for students who live with their parents in the Tulsa area. Men and women are housed in separate dormitory facilities on campus with student access to housing of the opposite sex largely restricted. In addition to having a chaplain on every wing of each dormitory, there are also residential advisers for each floor, who enforce curfew, take attendance at Chapel services, and serve as &quot;go-to persons&quot; for students on their floors. Every Monday night is a mandatory Hall Meeting at which announcements are made by dorm leadership.

All students are required to sign a pledge stating they will live according to the university&#x27;s honor code. Prohibited activities include lying, cursing, smoking, drinking, and a range of sexual acts, including homosexual behavior and sex outside marriage. In early 2003, the student dress code was relaxed for the first time in 40 years and described as business casual. For most of the school&#x27;s history, men were required to wear collared shirts and ties and women were required to wear skirts (an exception for winter months was added in 2000). In 2006, campus-wide dress code rules were eased further, allowing students to wear jeans to class and dress more casually in non-academic settings. Since 2009, men are allowed to have neatly trimmed facial hair. Restrictions on men&#x27;s hair length were relaxed in 2013.

== Athletics ==

Oral Roberts University is a member of The Summit League after leaving its former conference home, Southland Conference, in July 2014. Its athletic programs include basketball, cross country, golf, soccer and tennis along with track and field for men and women. There is also a baseball program for men and volleyball for women.

ORU&#x27;s early sports team nicknames were the Titans for men and the Lady Titans for women, adopted in 1965 by a vote of the student body. On April 30, 1993, all teams for both men and women became known as the Golden Eagles. ORU&#x27;s mascot is Eli the golden eagle, who hatched out of his papier-mâché egg on November 17, 1993, before the start of an exhibition basketball game as the official symbol of a new era in ORU athletics. The mascot&#x27;s name is an acronym for education, life skills and integrity.

Notable players include: Max Abmas (men&#x27;s basketball), Jose Trevino and Alex &quot;Chi Chi&quot; Gonzalez (baseball), Kevi Luper (women&#x27;s basketball), Jeffery Gibson (track and field), Jack Whitt (track and field), and Austin Hannah (golf).

===Basketball===
The women&#x27;s basketball team has appeared in four NCAA tournaments in the past eight seasons. In 2018, former NBA player Lee Mayberry was appointed as assistant coach for the women&#x27;s basketball team.

Paul Mills has been the head coach of the Golden Eagles men&#x27;s basketball team since 2017. On March 19, 2021, the ORU men&#x27;s basketball team defeated the #2 seed Ohio State in the 2021 NCAA tournament as a #15 seed in the first round. This was the first time a #15 seed won an NCAA tournament game since Middle Tennessee defeated Michigan State in the first round of the 2016 NCAA tournament. ORU then defeated #7 seed Florida in the Round of 32 to advance to the Sweet Sixteen. It is only the second #15 seed to ever reach the Sweet Sixteen, after Florida Gulf Coast in 2013. Player Max Abmas was named the Summit League Men&#x27;s Basketball Player of the Year in March 2021.

===Baseball===
The ORU baseball team has played in 29 NCAA regional tournaments. ORU advanced to the College World Series in 1978 and 2023. In 2006, ORU advanced to the NCAA Super Regional against Clemson, and in 2023 the Golden Eagles beat Oregon in the Eugene Super Regional. ORU baseball once won 12 consecutive conference championships and played in 12 consecutive NCAA regional tournaments (1998 to 2009).

<text>Charles Locke Eastlake (11 March 1836 – 20 November 1906) was a British architect and furniture designer.

His uncle, Sir Charles Lock Eastlake PRA (born in 1793), was a Keeper of the National Gallery, from 1843 to 1847, and from 1855 its first director, which results in some confusion between the two men, whose names are distinguished only by the presence or absence of an &quot;e&quot; in their middle names.

The style of furniture named after him, Eastlake style, flourished during the later half of the nineteenth century. The Eastlake movement, a style of architecture, with old English and Gothic elements, is also named for him.

==Life==
Eastlake was born March 11, 1836, in Plymouth. His formal education included studies at the Westminster School and the Royal Academy where he discovered an interest in architecture, along with the talent for drawing and painting in watercolors. Eastlake furthered his education with three years of travel throughout France, Italy, and Germany, developing his love for medieval building and architecture. Trained by the architect Philip Hardwick (1792–1870), he popularized William Morris&#x27;s notions of decorative arts in the Arts and Crafts style, becoming one of the principal exponents of the revived Early English or Modern Gothic style popular during the nineteenth century. His book, &quot;A History of the Gothic Revival,&quot; published in 1872, depicted buildings of English Gothic architectural style and the Gothic Revival built between 1820 and 1870. This was influential to revivalists interested in restoring the language of Gothic tradition in England.

Although he had the qualifications of an architect, Eastlake did not practice as one. In the years 1855 and 1856 he put forward several architectural designs for a number of projects, including a design for the Rugby Town Hall, but all were rejected. In the years following, Eastlake instead focused on journalism, the occasional design of interior goods, and furniture design. He did not make any furniture; his designs were produced by professional cabinet makers.

In 1868 he published &quot;Hints on Household Taste in Furniture, Upholstery and other Details&quot;, which was very influential in Britain, and later in the United States, where the book was published in 1872. From 1866 to 1877 he was secretary to the Royal Institute of British Architects, and from 1878 to 1898 he was Keeper of the National Gallery, London.

He died, aged 70, at Leinster Square, Bayswater, and was buried at Kensal Green.

==Artistic recognition==

A bust of Eastlake by John Gibson is held in the National Portrait Gallery, London.

<text>Holly Marie Combs Ryan (born December 3, 1973) is an American actress and producer. She is known for her roles as Kimberly Brock in the CBS series &quot;Picket Fences&quot; (1992–1996), Piper Halliwell in The WB series &quot;Charmed&quot; (1998–2006) and Ella Montgomery in the Freeform series &quot;Pretty Little Liars&quot; (2010–2017).

==Early life==
Combs was born in San Diego, California, and is of Irish descent. At the time of her birth, her mother, Lauralei Combs was 15 years old, and her father was 17. Combs&#x27; biological parents married, but the two split up after two years, feeling they were too young to make a marriage work.

While Combs was learning to walk, she fell and hit her head on a marble table, resulting in a noticeable &#x27;split&#x27; at the top of her right eyebrow. She lived in many different homes with her mother, near the beach in San Diego, often having very little privacy, while her mother attempted to pursue an acting career. When Combs was seven, she and her mother moved to New York City where she spent most of her growing years. Combs was 12 when her mother married her stepfather. In New York City, Combs attended Beekman Hill Elementary and then the Professional Children&#x27;s School. In an interview when she was in Sydney, Australia, for Supanova Expo, she said that she was a certified scuba diver at 13.

==Career==

===Early work: 1988–1997===

When she was 14 years old, Combs landed her first major role in &quot;Sweet Hearts Dance&quot; (1988), a comedy drama film directed by Robert Greenwald. She played Debs Boon, the daughter of Wiley Boon (played by Don Johnson) and Sandra Boon (played by Susan Sarandon). Her next major role was in Oliver Stone&#x27;s &quot;Born on the Fourth of July&quot; (1989), a film adaptation of the best selling autobiography of the same name by Vietnam War veteran Ron Kovic. Combs portrayed Jenny in the film, which also starred Tom Cruise. Her other roles included Helena in the 1989 anthology film &quot;New York Stories&quot;, and Kim Fields in Hal Hartley&#x27;s &quot;Simple Men&quot; (1992). Also in 1992, Combs made an appearance in Temístocles López&#x27;s &quot;Chain of Desire&quot; as Diana, and in the slasher film &quot;Dr. Giggles&quot;, in which she played Jennifer Campbell, the 19-year-old daughter of Tom Campbell (played by Cliff De Young) and girlfriend of Max Anderson (played by Glenn Quinn).

Combs&#x27;s first major breakthrough as an actress came at the age of 18, in the CBS television series &quot;Picket Fences&quot;. She portrayed Kimberly Brock, the daughter of Sheriff Jimmy Brock (played by Tom Skerritt) and his first wife Lydia for the show&#x27;s four seasons (1992–96). Jimmy&#x27;s second wife, Dr. Jill Brock (played by Kathy Baker), was her character&#x27;s stepmother. Combs auditioned for the role in New York. The casting agent told her that she wasn&#x27;t right for the part because she &quot;didn&#x27;t have a big enough heart.&quot; Combs retorted, &quot;If you&#x27;re looking for someone with a big heart, what the hell are you doing in New York?&quot; She was later called back and offered the job. Combs won a Young Artist Award for her performance on the show. During 1996, Combs starred as Sophie DiMatteo in &quot;Sins of Silence&quot;, a drama/horror television film directed by Sam Pillsbury. The following year, Combs portrayed real-life convicted murderer Diane Zamora in the television film &quot;Love&#x27;s Deadly Triangle: The Texas Cadet Murder&quot;, and appeared in the fact-based drama film &quot;Daughters&quot; as Alex Morell, one of the two daughters of a murdered heiress.

=== Later work: 1998–present ===
In 1998, Combs landed a lead role in The WB television series &quot;Charmed&quot;, in which she portrayed Piper Halliwell, the middle of three sisters who are witches. Following Shannen Doherty&#x27;s departure after season three (2000–01), Combs&#x27;s character became the eldest sister for the remaining five seasons of the show. Combs also became a producer for &quot;Charmed&quot; from season five onwards. The series ended its eight-season run on May 21, 2006. In 2007 and 2008, AOL named Combs&#x27;s character Piper the third-greatest witch in television history. Combs was the only cast member to appear in every episode of the series, including the original unaired pilot.

During &quot;Charmed&quot;, Combs made an uncredited cameo appearance in Steven Soderbergh&#x27;s &quot;Ocean&#x27;s Eleven&quot; (2001), and starred opposite Charisma Carpenter in the romantic comedy film &quot;See Jane Date&quot; (2003), portraying the role of &quot;a struggling actress whose career benefits from an affair with an A-list actor.&quot; In 2007, she starred in the Lifetime television film &quot;Point of Entry&quot; (also titled &quot;Panic Button&quot;) as Kathy Alden, a wife and mother of a single child whose family moves to a &quot;beautiful and supposedly secure gated community after she&#x27;s the victim of a violent house break-in.&quot; The following year, Combs signed a contract with Lifetime to produce and star in a series &quot;Mistresses&quot;, based on the British series of the same name. However, that version of the show never made it to air. (ABC later made a version featuring Combs&#x27; former &quot;Charmed&quot; co-star Alyssa Milano.) In 2010, Combs was cast in the Freeform series &quot;Pretty Little Liars&quot; as Ella Montgomery, the mother of one of the main characters, Aria Montgomery (played by Lucy Hale). Combs was a series regular for the first three seasons, but became credited as a special guest star from season four onwards. &quot;Pretty Little Liars&quot; ended after seven seasons, and Combs returned for the show&#x27;s final episode on June 27, 2017.

Combs and Doherty starred in their own road trip reality show &quot;Off the Map with Shannen &amp; Holly&quot;, which premiered on Great American Country on January 2, 2015. The six-episode series followed the pair traveling across southeastern United States, with stops in Kentucky, Tennessee, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia and Florida. Viewers were able to vote on activities Doherty and Combs would partake in at each destination on Great American Country&#x27;s official website. In January 2016, Combs starred in the Hallmark Channel television film &quot;Love&#x27;s Complicated&quot;, playing the lead role of Leah Townsend, a big city novel writer and senator&#x27;s daughter who is &quot;known for being a people pleaser.&quot;

== Personal life ==
In 1993, Combs married actor Bryan Travis Smith; they divorced in 1997.

On February 14, 2004, she married her long time boyfriend and the former &quot;Charmed&quot; key-grip David Donoho. They have three sons together. In November 2011, she filed for divorce from Donoho, citing irreconcilable differences.

In 2016, Combs began dating restaurateur Mike Ryan. On September 3, 2017, Combs announced their engagement. On September 7, 2019, it was reported that they married in Carmel, California. Through this marriage, Combs has one stepdaughter.

<doc id="448834" wikidata="Q847843" url="?curid=448834" title="College and university rankings">
<text>College and university rankings order higher education institutions based on various criteria, with factors differing depending on the specific ranking system. These rankings can be conducted at the national or international level, assessing institutions within a single country, within a specific geographical region, or worldwide. Rankings are typically conducted by magazines, newspapers, websites, governments, or academics.

In addition to ranking entire institutions, specific programs, departments, and schools can be ranked. Some rankings consider measures of wealth, excellence in research, selective admissions, and alumni success. Rankings may also consider various combinations of measures of specialization expertise, student options, award numbers, internationalization, graduate employment, industrial linkage, historical reputation and other criteria.

However, there is significant debate surrounding the interpretation, accuracy, and usefulness of rankings. The expanding diversity in rating methodologies and accompanying criticisms of each indicate the lack of consensus in the field. Further, it seems possible to game the ranking systems through excessive self-citations or by researchers supporting each other in surveys.

UNESCO has even questioned whether rankings &quot;do more harm than good,&quot; noting that while &quot;Rightly or wrongly, they are perceived as a measure of quality and so create intense competition between universities all over the world&quot;.

==Global rankings==
Several organizations produce worldwide university rankings, including the following. The three longest established and most influential global rankings are those produced by Quacquarelli Symonds (QS), &quot;Times Higher Education&quot; (&quot;THE&quot;) and Shanghai Ranking Consultancy (the &quot;Academic Ranking of World Universities&quot;; &quot;ARWU&quot;). All of these, along with other global rankings, primarily measure the research performance of universities rather than their teaching. They have been criticized for being &quot;largely based on what can be measured rather than what is necessarily relevant and important to the university&quot;, and the validity of the data available globally has been questioned. As of 2021, across the three most popular global rankings, &quot;the majority of the top-ten globally ranked institutions are located in southern England, California, the tri-state area (New York, New Jersey, Connecticut), and nearby Massachusetts.&quot;

While some rankings attempt to measure teaching using metrics such as staff to student ratio, the Higher Education Policy Institute has pointed out that the metrics used are more closely related to research than teaching quality, e.g. &quot;Staff to student ratios are an almost direct measure of research activity&quot;, and &quot;The proportion of PhD students is also to a large extent an indication of research activity&quot;. Inside Higher Ed similarly states &quot;these criteria do not actually measure teaching, and none even come close to assessing the quality of impact&quot;. Many rankings are also considered to contain biases towards the natural sciences and, due to the bibliometric sources used, towards publication in English-language journals. Some rankings, including &quot;ARWU&quot;, also fail to make any correction for the sizes of institutions, so a large institution is ranked considerably higher than a small institution with the same quality of research. Other compilers, such as Scimago and &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;, use a mix of size-dependent and size-independent metrics.

Some compilers, notably QS, &quot;THE&quot;, and &quot;U.S. News&quot;, use reputational surveys. The validity of these has been criticized: &quot;Most experts are highly critical of the reliability of simply asking a rather unrandom group of educators and others involved with the academic enterprise for their opinions&quot;; &quot;methodologically [international surveys of reputation] are flawed, effectively they only measure research performance and they skew the results in favor of a small number of institutions.&quot;

However, despite the criticism, much attention is paid to global rankings, particularly &quot;ARWU&quot;, QS, and &quot;THE&quot;. Some countries, including Denmark and the Netherlands, use university rankings as part of points-based immigration programs, while others, such as Russia, automatically recognize degrees from higher-ranked universities. India&#x27;s University Grants Commission requires foreign partners of Indian universities to be ranked in the top 500 of the &quot;THE&quot; or &quot;ARWU&quot; ranking, while Brazil&#x27;s Science Without Borders program selected international partner institutions using the &quot;THE&quot; and QS rankings.

===Major international rankings===

====QS World University Rankings====

The QS World University Rankings are a ranking of the world&#x27;s top universities produced by Quacquarelli Symonds published annually since 2004. In 2024, they ranked 1500 universities, with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Imperial College London, University of Oxford, Harvard University and University of Cambridge taking the top 5 spots. 
The QS rankings should not be confused with the &quot;Times Higher Education World University Rankings&quot;. From 2004 to 2009 the QS rankings were published in collaboration with &quot;Times Higher Education&quot; and were known as the &quot;Times Higher Education-QS World University Rankings&quot;. In 2010 QS assumed sole publication of rankings produced with this methodology when &quot;Times Higher Education&quot; split from QS in order to create a new rankings methodology in partnership with Thomson Reuters. The QS rankings were previously published in the United States by &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; as the &quot;World&#x27;s Best Universities&quot;. However, in 2014, &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; launched their own international university ranking titled &quot;Best Global Universities&quot;. The inaugural ranking was published in October 2014.

In 2023, for the 20th edition of the QS World University Rankings, released on 28 June 2023, QS following an 18 months long consultation involving representatives of the global higher education sector, students and the QS Rankings Global Advisory Board (established in 2010), introduced its largest-ever methodological enhancement, introducing three new metrics: Sustainability, Employment Outcomes and International Research Network, each worth 5% of a university&#x27;s possible score. The results draw on the analysis of 17.5m academic papers (bibliometric data provided by data from Scopus,) which informs the &quot;Citation per Faculty&quot; indicator and represent 20 percent of the overall score. The results also draw on the expert opinions of over 144,000 academic faculty and over 98,000 international employers. These two indicators are worth 30 percent and 15 percent of a university&#x27;s possible score respectively. The QS rankings also incorporate faculty/student ratios (10 percent of the overall score) and international staff and student numbers (5 percent each of the overall score). The detailed methodology is available online.

QS Asian University Rankings
The QS World University Rankings expanded its portfolio in 2009 to incorporate the Asian University Rankings.
This expansion was executed in collaboration with &quot;The Chosun Ilbo&quot; newspaper, based in South Korea. By 2023, the rankings had grown to feature 760 universities. The eligibility criteria for these rankings were anchored in the &quot;United Nations M49 Standard&quot;. These criteria update led to the inclusion of five Central Asian nations - Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan - as well as Iran. For the first time in eight years, a Singaporean institution did not take the regional top spot, nor did Singapore occupy two of the top three positions. The city-state&#x27;s hegemony at the top of the table was interrupted by the rise of China&#x27;s premier institutions, particularly Peking University, the new regional leader, breaking the National University of Singapore’s four-year run as Asia&#x27;s number one university. NUS fell to second place while China&#x27;s Tsinghua University came third. Nanyang Technological University dropped to fifth place. China (Mainland) was the region&#x27;s most represented location, with 128 listed universities, followed by India with 118 and Japan with 106.  Although the Asian University Rankings share some core metrics with the QS World University Rankings, there are variations in the weightings. Additionally, the methodology for the Asian rankings integrates region-specific indicators. Notably, these include metrics such as the percentage of staff with PhDs and data on inbound and outbound exchange students.

QS Latin American &amp; Caribbean University Rankings
The QS Latin American University &amp; The Caribbean Rankings were published for the first time in 2011. The methodology was developed in consultation with experts from the region. Evaluating the region&#x27;s institutions based on academic and employer recognition, research output, resources and internationalisation, the 2024 edition of the rankings lists 430 institutions across 25 locations. Universidade de São Paulo tops the table, usurping Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile which comes second while Brazil&#x27;s Universidade Estadual de Campinas places third. Brazil is the most represented nation with 97 listed universities, followed by Mexico with 63 and Colombia with 61. 

QS Arab Region Universities Rankings
The first-ever QS Arab Region University Rankings is released in 2014. Evaluating institutions based on global recognition, research prowess, teaching resources and internationalisation (methodology), the 2024 edition of the ranking is the largest ever, showcasing 223 institutions from 18 member countries of the Arab League. King Fahd University of Petroleum &amp; Minerals topped the table, climbing from third place in the previous edition. King Saud University came second while Qatar University placed third. The previous year&#x27;s leader, King Abdulaziz University (KAU), dropped to fifth, after spending four consecutive years in the top spot. Egypt was the most represented higher education system, with 36 featured universities, followed by Saudi Arabia with 34 and Iraq with 24.

The top ten universities in the Arab world represent a diverse array of institutions spanning various countries. Among them are Qatar University in Doha, Qatar, and King Saud University in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, Sultan Qaboos University in Muscat, Oman, and the American University of Beirut (AUB) in Beirut, Lebanon are prominent fixtures in the region&#x27;s educational landscape. American University of Sharjah in Sharjah, United Arab Emirates, and the University of Jordan in Amman, Jordan, are esteemed for their contributions to higher education and research in the Arab world. United Arab Emirates University in Al Ain, United Arab Emirates, and King Fahd University of Petroleum &amp; Minerals in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, are also notable for their rigorous academic programs. In addition, Khalifa University in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, and King Abdulaziz University (KAU) in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, are recognized for their commitment to innovation and knowledge dissemination.

Various methods of ranking universities, including QS University Rankings, Times Higher Education World University Rankings and Academic Ranking of World Universities, underwent analysis. Arab scholars recommended creating two new methodologies for World University Ranking and Arab University Ranking. They raised concerns by accusing biases against universities in the Arab region universities within existing rankings, and underscored the importance of recalibrating indicator weighting due to disregarded institutional disparities.

QS Ranking by Subject

The QS World University Rankings by Subject was first published in 2011, featuring 26 disciplines. The latest edition showcases over 1,500 universities and specialist higher education institutions across 55 different subjects, grouped into 5 faculty (broad subject) areas.

====Times Higher Education World University Rankings====

From 2004 to 2009 &quot;Times Higher Education&quot; (&quot;THE&quot;), a British publication, published the annual &quot;Times Higher Education–QS World University Rankings&quot; in association with Quacquarelli Symonds (QS). &quot;THE&quot; published a table of the top 200 universities and QS ranked approximately 500 online, in book form, and via media partners. On 30 October 2009, &quot;THE&quot; broke with QS and joined Thomson Reuters to provide a new set of world university rankings, called &quot;Times Higher Education World University Rankings&quot;. The 2015/16 edition of the &quot;Times Higher Education World University Rankings&quot; rank the world&#x27;s 800 best universities, while the 2016/17 installment will rank the world&#x27;s top 980.

On 3 June 2010, &quot;Times Higher Education&quot; revealed the methodology which they proposed to use when compiling the new world university rankings. The new methodology included 13 separate performance indicators, an increase from the six measures employed between 2004 and 2009. After further consultation the criteria were grouped under five broad overall indicators to produce the final ranking. &quot;THE&quot; published its first rankings using its new methodology on 16 September 2010, a month earlier than previous years. &quot;THE&quot; also kick-started &quot;THE&quot; 100 Under 50 ranking and Alma Mater Index.

&quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; in 2010 described the &quot;Times Higher Education World University Rankings&quot; as &quot;arguably the most influential&quot;.
Research published by professors at the University of Michigan in 2011 demonstrated that the early &quot;THES&quot; rankings were disproportionately influential in establishing the status order of world research universities.

This ranking was published for the first time in March 2011. The rankings are based on a survey of (for 2016) 10,323 academics from 133 countries, who are asked to talk the top universities in their field for teaching and for research.

====Academic Ranking of World Universities====

The &quot;Academic Ranking of World Universities&quot; (&quot;ARWU&quot;) compiled originally by the Shanghai Jiao Tong University and now maintained by the ShanghaiRanking Consultancy, has provided annual global rankings of universities since 2003, making it the earliest of its kind. &quot;ARWU&quot; does not rely on surveys and school submissions. Among other criteria, &quot;ARWU&quot; includes the number of articles published by &quot;Nature&quot; or &quot;Science&quot; and the number of Nobel Prize winners and Fields Medalists (mathematics). Harvard and Stanford have topped the ranking for years.
One of the primary criticisms of &quot;ARWU&quot; methodology is that it is biased towards the natural sciences and English language science journals over other subjects. Moreover, the &quot;ARWU&quot; is known for &quot;relying solely on research indicators&quot;, and &quot;the ranking is heavily weighted toward institutions whose faculty or alumni have won Nobel Prizes&quot;: it does not measure &quot;the quality of teaching or the quality of humanities.&quot;

===Other global rankings===

====Aggregate Ranking of Top Universities====
The Aggregate Ranking of Top Universities (ARTU) is a meta-ranking that positions global universities based on World University Rankings by &quot;THE&quot;, QS, and &quot;ARWU&quot;. ARTU is produced by UNSW Sydney and published annually since 2019, with retrospective rankings available for 2012 to 2018. In 2024, ARTU ranked 471 universities and featured the Top 400 for publication, with MIT securing first place, followed by Harvard and Oxford in second and third place, respectively.

The criteria for ARTU is the sum of world rank across the 3 rankings (=&quot;THE&quot;+QS+&quot;ARWU&quot;) with universities excluded if they do not have a distinct rank in &quot;THE&quot;, QS, and &quot;ARWU&quot;. Since 2012, United States has the highest number of ARTU Top 200 universities, while Switzerland has the most ARTU Top 200 universities per capita. Meanwhile, Hong Kong, now surpassing Switzerland—which traditionally led on a per capita basis—has the highest number of ARTU Top 200 universities per capita.

Since 2022, ARTU has included Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and Research &amp; Development (R&amp;D) expenditure as modifiers to determine country level performance and return on investment. Hong Kong and Australia come out on top for GDP and R&amp;D respectively for most ARTU Top 200 universities adjusted by these indicators.

====Academic Influence====
Academic Influence creates global and U.S.-centric rankings of colleges, universities, and disciplinary programs by evaluating the combined influence of a school&#x27;s faculty within and across fields of study. Using machine-learning technology developed with funding from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, Academic Influence searches and collates open-source data from such massive publicly available data sources as Wikipedia, Wikidata, Crossref, Semantic Scholar, IPEDS, and BLS. Academic Influence gives weight in its rankings to citations of peer-reviewed articles, chapters, and books by influential academics worldwide. It thereby attempts to map and objectively measure the influence of a school&#x27;s thought leadership through its students, faculty, staff, and alumni. Academic Influence allows users to create rankings on the fly through its dynamic schools and people tools, which can be filtered by discipline, country, and period. Tech entrepreneur and computer scientist Erik J. Larson co-founded Academic Influence.

====Center for World University Rankings====
The Center for World University Rankings (CWUR) is based in the United Arab Emirates and publishes global university rankings measuring the quality of education and training for students as well as the prestige of the faculty members and the quality of their research. Samplings do not come from surveys and university data submissions. Instead, the rankings rely more on outcome-based samplings, coupled with a Subject ranking in 227 subject categories. The Subject portion of the ranking is based on the number of research articles in top-tier journals with data obtained from Clarivate Analytics. In the United States, the CWUR evaluates and ranks over 1,300 universities and 2,000 worldwide.

====Leiden Ranking====

The Centre for Science and Technology Studies at Leiden University maintains a European and worldwide ranking of the top 500 universities according including the number and impact of Web of Science-indexed publications per year. The rankings compare research institutions by taking into account differences in language, discipline and institutional size. Multiple ranking lists are released according to various bibliometric normalization and impact indicators, including the number of publications, citations-per-publication, and field-averaged impact per publication.

====Performance Ranking of Scientific Papers for World Universities====

The Performance Ranking of Scientific Papers for World Universities was produced until 2012 by the Higher Education Evaluation and Accreditation Council of Taiwan (HEEACT). The indicators were designed to measure both long-term and short-term research performance of research universities.

This project employed bibliometrics to analyze and rank the performance of the 500 top universities and the top 300 universities in six fields. HEEACT further provides subject rankings in science and technology fields. It also ranked the top 300 universities across ten science and technology fields.
The ranking included eight indicators. They were: articles published over the prior 11 years; citations of those articles, &quot;current&quot; articles, current citations, average citations, &quot;H-index&quot;, number of &quot;highly cited papers&quot; and high impact journal articles. They represented three criteria of scientific papers performance: research productivity, research impact, and research excellence.

The 2007 ranking methodology was alleged to have favored universities with medical schools, and in response, HEEACT added assessment criteria. The six field-based rankings are based on the subject categorization of WOS, including Agriculture &amp; Environment Sciences (AGE), Clinical Medicine (MED), Engineering, Computing &amp; Technology (ENG), Life Sciences (LIFE), Natural Sciences (SCI) and Social Sciences (SOC). The ten subjects include Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics, Geosciences, Electrical Engineering, Computer Science, Mechanical Engineering, Chemical Engineering (including Energy &amp; Fuels), Materials Sciences, and Civil Engineering (including Environmental Engineering). The ranking was produced by National Taiwan University since 2012 and also known as NTU Ranking.

====Reuters World&#x27;s Top 100 Innovative Universities====

The ranking uses a methodology with 10 metrics. The process cross-references the 500 academic and government organizations with the greatest number of published articles in scholarly journals as indexed in the Thomson Reuters Web of Science Core Collection database against how many patents and patent equivalents each organization filed in the same period in the Derwent World Patents Index and the Derwent Innovations Index. The remaining 70 institutions were mostly universities and were ranked using criteria such as frequency of patent applications granted, the number of filed patents, frequency of those patents being cited, as well as how many of their papers were cited by patents or co-authored by an industry author. The ranking has the Asia-Pacific edition featuring top 75 institutions across the region and top 25 most innovative governmental institutions in the world. Currently, the last available edition of the ranking dates back to 2019.

====Round University Ranking====

Round University Ranking, or abbreviated RUR Rankings is a world university ranking, assessing effectiveness of 750 leading universities in the world based on 20 indicators distributed among 4 key dimension areas: teaching, research, international diversity, financial sustainability. The ranking has international coverage and is intended to become a tool of choice of the university for the key stakeholders of higher education: applicants, students, representatives of the academic community, university management. The RUR Rankings publisher is an independent RUR Rankings Agency, geographically located in Moscow, Russia.
RUR is aimed to provide a transparent, comprehensive analytical system for benchmarking and evaluating universities across the borders to the widest possible audience: students, analysts, decision-makers in the field of higher education development both at individual institutional and at the national level.

====SCImago Institutions Rankings====

The SCImago Institutions Rankings (SIR) since 2009 has published its international ranking of worldwide research institutions, the SIR World Report. The SIR World Report is the work of the SCImago Research Group, a Spain-based research organization consist of members from the Spanish National Research Council (CSIC), University of Granada, Charles III University of Madrid, University of Alcalá, University of Extremadura and other education institutions in Spain.

The ranking measures areas such as research output, international collaboration, normalized impact, and publication rate.

====U-Multirank====
U-Multirank, a European Commission supported feasibility study, was undertaken to contribute to the European Commission objective of enhancing transparency about the different missions and the performance of higher education institutions and research institutes. At a press conference in Brussels on 13 May 2011, the U-Multirank was officially launched by Androulla Vassiliou, Commissioner for Higher Education and Culture saying: U-Multirank &quot;will be useful to each participating higher education institution, as a planning and self-mapping exercise. By providing students with clearer information to guide their study choices, this is a fresh tool for more quality, relevance and transparency in European higher education.&quot;

====University Ranking by Academic Performance====

The University Ranking by Academic Performance, abbreviated as URAP, was developed in the Informatics Institute of Middle East Technical University. Since 2010, it has been publishing annual national and global college and university rankings for top 2000 institutions. The scientometrics measurement of URAP is based on data obtained from the Institute for Scientific Information via Web of Science and inCites. For global rankings, URAP employs indicators of research performance including the number of articles, citation, total documents, article impact total, citation impact total, and international collaboration. In addition to global rankings, URAP publishes regional rankings for universities in Turkey using additional indicators such as the number of students and faculty members obtained from Center of Measuring, Selection and Placement ÖSYM.

====U.S. News &amp; World Report Best Global Universities Rankings====

&quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; inaugural Best Global Universities ranking was launched on 28 October 2014, and it was based on data and metrics provided by Thomson Reuters, and are thus methodologically different from the criteria traditionally used by &quot;U.S. News&quot; to rank American institutions. Universities are judged on factors such as global research reputation, publications, and the number of highly cited papers. &quot;U.S. News&quot; also publishes region-specific and subject-specific global rankings based on this methodology.

The annual &quot;U.S. News&quot; Best Global Universities rankings were produced to provide insight into how universities compare globally. As an increasing number of students are planning to enroll in universities outside of their own country, the Best Global Universities rankings – which focus specifically on schools&#x27; academic research and reputation overall and not on their separate undergraduate or graduate programs – can help those students accurately compare institutions around the world.

The Best Global Universities rankings also provide insight into how U.S. universities – which &quot;U.S. News&quot; has been ranking separately for more than 30 years – stand globally. All universities can now benchmark themselves against schools in their own country and region, become more visible on the world stage and find top schools in other countries to consider collaborating with.

The overall Best Global Universities rankings encompass the top 750 institutions spread out across 57 countries – up from the top 500 universities in 49 countries ranked last year. The first step in producing these rankings, which are powered by Thomson Reuters InCitesTM research analytics solutions, involved creating a pool of 1,000 universities that was used to rank the top 750 schools. In comparison with &quot;U.S. News&quot; Best Colleges Ranking, the Global University Ranking is focused on the research power and faculty resources for students, while the National Ranking is only focused on undergraduate studies. Therefore, for graduate studies and international students, the Best Global Universities Ranking is a much better reference than National University Ranking.

&quot;Inside Higher Ed&quot; noted that &quot;U.S. News&quot; is entering into the international college and university rankings area that is already &quot;dominated by three major global university rankings&quot;: the &quot;Times Higher Education World University Rankings&quot;, the &quot;Academic Ranking of World Universities&quot;, and the &quot;QS World University Rankings&quot;. &quot;U.S. News&quot;&#x27; chief data strategist Robert Morse stated: &quot;We&#x27;re well-known in the field for doing academic rankings so we thought it was a natural extension of the other rankings that we&#x27;re doing.&quot;

Morse pointed out that &quot;U.S. News&quot; as &quot;the first American publisher to enter the global rankings space&quot;, given &quot;Times Higher Education&quot; and QS are both British, while the Academic Ranking of World universities is Chinese.

====Webometrics====

The Webometrics Ranking of World Universities is produced by Cybermetrics Lab (CCHS), a unit of the Spanish National Research Council (CSIC), the main public research body in Spain. It offers information about more than 12,000 universities according to their web presence (an assessment of the scholarly contents, visibility, and impact of universities on the web). The ranking is updated every January and July.

The Webometrics Ranking or Ranking Web is built from a database of over 30,000 higher education institutions. The top 12,000 universities are shown in the main ranking and more are covered in regional lists.

The ranking started in 2004 and is based on a composite indicator that includes both the volume of the Web content and the visibility and impact of web publications according to the number of external links they received. A wide range of scientific activities appears exclusively on academic websites and is typically overlooked by bibliometric indicators.

Webometric indicators measure institutional commitment to Web publication. Webometric results show a high correlation with other rankings. However, North American universities are relatively common in the top 200, while small and medium-size biomedical institutions and German, French, Italian, and Japanese universities were less common in the top ranks. Possible reasons include publishing via independent research councils (CNRS, Max Planck, CNR) or the large amount of non-English Web content, which is less likely to be linked.

====The Three University Missions====
The Three University Missions Moscow International University Ranking (shortly MosIUR) is produced by Association of Rating Makers, a non-commercial organization based in Moscow. The Three University Missions ranking evaluates the quality of education, scientific work, and the universities&#x27; contribution to society. The ranking uses 17 criteria divided into three groups: Education, Research, and University and Society.

The shortlist of the Moscow International University Ranking aims to provide the widest possible representation of the leading multi-profile universities all over the world, the quota being assigned to each country with regard to that country&#x27;s contribution to the global economy. MosIUR shortlists those universities that achieved leading positions in other global university rankings and/or national academic rankings listed in IREG Inventory of National Rankings, and, in some cases, also those universities showing the highest research productivity. MosIUR does not consider narrow-focused higher education institutions.
The latest Moscow Ranking issue featured 1800 higher education institutions globally.

===Specific rankings===
====Eduniversal====

This university ranking is owned by the French consulting company and rating agency &quot;SMBG&quot;. It ranks masters and MBA in its 9 geographical regions (the 5 continents).

====Human Resources &amp; Labor Review====

The Human Resources &amp; Labor Review (HRLR) publishes a human competitiveness index &amp; analysis annually by Asia First Media—now part of Destiny Media, previously ChaseCareer Network (ChaseCareer.Net). This system is based on Human Resources &amp; Labour Review Indexes, the HRI and LRI, which measure the performance of top 300 universities&#x27; graduates.

In 2004, a couple of educational institutions voiced concerns at several events in regard to the accuracy and effectiveness of ranking bodies or lists. The HRLR ranking was pioneered in late 2005 within a working group in response to those concerns. The team was founded in January 2007, in London, and started compiling and processing data, resulting in the first lists in 2007–2008. The ranking concept is later being adopted for Alumni score on &quot;ARWU&quot; and many other rankings.

The new HRLR ranking innovative methods sparked intense interest from many institutions and inspired several other ranking lists and scoring which are based on professional, alumni, executives, competitiveness, human capital-oriented aspects. Nevertheless, HRLR remains to be the leader in university ranking with innovative and comprehensive approaches, and not relying merely on those aforementioned aspects.

====Nature Index====

The Nature Index tracks the affiliations of high-quality scientific articles published in 68 science journals independently chosen by the scientific community as the journals scientists would most like to publish their best research in. Updated monthly, the Nature Index presents research reports of approximately 9,000 parent institutions worldwide presenting a page of output statistics for each institution along with information on institutions collaborating with the institution in the publication of Index articles. Each of the approximately 60,000 articles in the Index has a dedicated article page with social and mainstream media coverage tracked by Altmetric. League tables of the output of institutions can be generated on the fly on a global, regional, or country basis and by broad subject area as well as by article count and fractional article count. Compare with other metrics of science (e.g., Impact Factor, h-index), Nature Index is the prominent scientific journal ranking with global reputation on original natural science and life science research.

====Professional Ranking of World Universities====

In contrast to academic rankings, the &quot;Professional Ranking of World Universities&quot; established in 2007 by the École nationale supérieure des mines de Paris measures the efficiency of each university at producing leading business professionals. Its main compilation criterion is the number of Chief Executive Officers (or equivalent) among the Fortune Global 500. This ranking has been criticized for placing five French universities into the top 20.

===Defunct rankings===
====G-factor====
G-factor ranks university and college web presence by counting the number of links only from other university websites, using Google search engine data. G-factor is an indicator of the popularity or importance of each university&#x27;s website from the combined perspectives of other institutions. It claims to be an objective peer review of a university through its website—in social network theory terminology, G-factor measures the centrality of each university&#x27;s website in the network of university websites.

====Global University Ranking====
Global University Ranking measures over 400 universities using the RatER, an autonomous, non-commercial, Russian rating agency supported by Russia&#x27;s academic society. The methodology pools universities from &quot;ARWU&quot;, HEEACT, &quot;Times&quot;-QS and Webometrics and a pool of experts formed by project officials and managers to determine the rating scales for indicators in seven areas. It considers academic performance, research performance, faculty expertise, resource availability, socially significant activities of graduates, international activities, and international opinion. Each expert independently evaluates these performance indicators for candidate universities. The rating is the average of the expert evaluations. This ranking raised questions when it placed Russian Moscow State University in fifth place, ahead of Harvard and Cambridge.

====High Impact Universities: Research Performance Index====
The High Impact Universities Research Performance Index (RPI) is a 2010 Australian initiative that studies university research performance. The pilot project involved a trial of over 1,000 universities or institutions and 5,000 constituent faculties (in various disciplines) worldwide. The top 500 results for universities and faculties were reported on the project website. The project promotes simplicity, transparency and fairness. The assessment analyzes research performance as measured by publications and citations. Publication and citation data are drawn from Scopus. The project uses standard bibliometric indicators, namely the 10-year g-index and h-index. RPI equally weighs contributions from the five faculties. The five faculty scores are normalized to place them onto a common scale. The normalized scores are then averaged to arrive at a final RPI.

====Newsweek====
In August 2006, the American magazine &quot;Newsweek&quot; published a ranking of the Top 100 Global Universities, using selected criteria from &quot;ARWU&quot; and the &quot;Times Higher Education&quot;-QS rankings, with the additional criterion of the number of volumes in the library. It formed part of a special issue including an article from Tony Blair, then prime minister of the UK, but has not been repeated. It considered openness and diversity as well as distinction in research. The ranking has been continued since its merger with &quot;The Daily Beast&quot;, and currently uses data from the &quot;Times Higher Education World Rankings&quot;, Webometrics world college rankings from public-research outlet Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Científicas in Spain, and the Shanghai Ranking Consultancy in order to compile its results.

==Regional and national rankings==
Regional and national rankings are carried out in Africa, Asia, Europe, North America, South America and Oceania.

===Asia===
QS&#x27;s Asian University Rankings use some of the same data as the QS World University Rankings alongside other material, such as the number of exchange students attending or traveling from each university. The rankings list the top 350 universities in Asia. Similarly, the &quot;THE&quot; Asia University Rankings &quot;use the same 13 performance indicators as the THE World University Rankings, but they are recalibrated to reflect the attributes of Asia&#x27;s institutions.&quot;

====China====
University rankings in China are ordered by different standards and made by various organizations, including:
* BCUR, by Shanghai Jiao Tong University
* Wu Shulian, published in the name of the Chinese Academy of Management Science
* Netbig, the higher education internet information company
* CUAA, by Airuishen (a company) in the name of Chinese Universities Alumni Association, etc.

====India====
The National Institutional Ranking Framework is initiated by the Ministry of Human Resource Development of the Government of India, to rank all institutions of higher education in India. Magazines such as &quot;Youth Incorporated Magazine&quot;, &quot;India Today&quot;, &quot;Outlook&quot;, &quot;Mint&quot;, &quot;The Week&quot;, &quot;Dataquest&quot;, &quot;Careers360&quot; and &quot;Electronics For You&quot; conduct for the major disciplines.

====Japan====
The Times Higher Education Supplement (The Thes) is publishing Japan University Rankings once a year, using a balanced scorecard approach, with 16 individual performance indicators combining to create an overall score that reflects the broad strength of an institution. Data for the rankings come from a variety of sources. These include self-submitted data from the institutions as well as data gathered from Elsevier, Benesse Corporation, Nikkei Human Resources, the Japanese government and the &quot;Times Higher Education&quot; Academic Reputation Survey.

On the other hand, some of the ranking systems in Japan rank universities by the difficulty of their entrance exams, called &quot;Hensachi&quot;. One example of such a ranking is Going broke universities - Disappearing universities by Kiyoshi Shimano. In addition to this, there&#x27;s the other example of rankings using &quot;Hensachi&quot;, GTZ. It is released by Benesse Corporation and describes to which deviation value class (S1 to D3) each university belongs.

Japanese preparatory school Kawaijuku also released the Japan&#x27;s Top 30 University Rankings in Natural Sciences and Technology for MEXT&#x27;s GLOBAL 30 Project in 2001.

====Pakistan====

Pakistan&#x27;s Higher Education Commission annually ranks domestic universities.

====Philippines====

Academic rankings in the Philippines are conducted by the Professional Regulation Commission and the Commission on Higher Education, based on accreditations, academic designations and the average passing rates in board tests.

====South Korea====
Korean Council for University Education, established in 2009, evaluates universities in South Korea.

===Europe===

====European Union====
The European Commission compiled a list of the 22 universities in the EU with the highest scientific impact. This ranking was compiled as part of the Third European Report on Science &amp; Technology Indicators, prepared by the Directorate General for Science and Research of the European Commission in 2003 (updated 2004). It only explicitly considers the European Union&#x27;s top institutions, but comparisons with the rest of the world are provided in the full report. The report said, &quot;University College London comes out on top in both publications (the number of scientific publications produced by the university) and citations (the number of times those scientific publications are cited by other researchers)&quot; however the table lists the top scoring university as &quot;Univ London&quot; implying that the authors counted the scientific output of the entire University of London, rather than its constituent colleges.

In this ranking, the EU&#x27;s top two universities were Cambridge and Oxford, as in the Jiao Tong and &quot;Times&quot; rankings. This ranking stresses the scientific quality of the institution, as opposed to its size or perceived prestige. Thus smaller, technical universities, such as Eindhoven (Netherlands) and the Technical University Munich (Germany) are ranked third and fourth, behind Cambridge, and followed by the University of Edinburgh. The report does not provide a direct comparison between EU and universities in the rest of the world, although it does compute a scientific impact score, which is measured against the world average.

In December 2008, the European Commission published a call for tenders, inviting bidders to design and test a new multi-dimensional university ranking system with global outreach. The first results of the envisaged pilot project were promised for the first half of 2011.

Another approach to classify the European research area is offered by &#x27;European Research Ranking&#x27;. This ranking is based on publicly available data from the European Commissions project and funding database CORDIS to estimate the funding and networking performance of European research institutions.

====Austria====
Some Austrian universities, including all Austrian Universities of Applied Sciences, take part in the CHE University Ranking.

====Bulgaria====
The Bulgarian University Ranking System, maintained by the Bulgarian Ministry of Education, compares academic programs in accredited domestic higher education institutions. The system ranks programs based on more than 50 indicators, such as teaching and learning conditions, scientific research, career development opportunities, prestige, and material resources.

====Denmark====
In Denmark, the think-tank CEPOS conduct an annual survey and ranking of higher education at study program level and institution level, based on entry salary, career development, drop-out rates, and program completion rates.

====France====

&quot;Eduniversal&quot; provides rankings of undergraduate and graduate degrees of French universities in some areas.

&quot;Le Nouvel Observateur&quot; occasionally offer rankings of &quot;&quot;Grandes écoles&quot; and their preparatory schools, the &quot;Prépas&quot;&quot;, and of universities&#x27; undergraduate degrees in some areas. The French government also uses the Shanghai ranking as its national ranking for French universities and &quot;Grandes écoles&quot;.

====Germany====
Since 1998, the Centre for Higher Education (CHE) has published the CHE University Ranking, a comprehensive ranking of German and Austrian universities.

The CHE also publishes a &quot;ResearchRanking&quot; showing the research strengths of German universities. The CHE ResearchRanking is based on the research-related data of the University Ranking.

====Ireland====
&quot;The Sunday Times&quot; ranks Irish universities based on a mix of criteria, including secondary school examination scores, graduation rates, staff-student ratio, research efficiency, accommodation, nontraditional students, athletics and sports facilities.

====Italy====
Every year, the newspaper , in collaboration with CENSIS, compiles a ranking of Italian universities.
Furthermore, the ministerial Agency for the Evaluation of University and Research (ANVUR) publishes every five years a detailed analysis regarding the entirety of the higher education institutions in the country, with a range of grades from D to A.

====North Macedonia====
The &quot;Academic Ranking of World Universities&quot; (&quot;ARWU&quot;) compiled a ranking of Macedonian Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) commissioned by the country&#x27;s Ministry of Education and Science in February 2011 and released it on 16 February 2012. Nineteen qualified HEIs were included in the ranking. The ranking used 19 indicators of academic performance and competitiveness, covering major mission aspects of HEIs such as teaching, research and social service. It is the first university ranking in North Macedonia.

====Netherlands====
Most Dutch universities take part in the CHE UniversityRanking.

====Poland====
A popular ranking of Polish higher education institutions is annually published by education magazine &quot;Perspektywy&quot;.

====Romania====
The Ad Astra association of Romanian scientists ranked Romanian universities in 2006 and 2007.

====Russian Federation====
Several bodies rank Russian universities, including RIA Novosti / Forbes, independent rating agency RatER, Interfax (in cooperation with Ekho Moskvy) and the Russian journal &quot;Finance&quot;.

RIA Novosty / Forbes rankings are conducted under the supervision of Public Chamber of Russia in cooperation with State University – Higher School of Economics. This ranking is considered the most objective system. It covers 476 higher education institutions and is based on the average score of the Unified State Examination that is required to enter a university. The ranking has separate sub-rankings for different subjects and clusters of universities.

RIA Novosty rankings do not align with other local and international rankings such as Academic Ranking of World Universities and QS World University Rankings which take into account inherited reputation from the Soviet Union.

RatER publishes annual rankings based on representation of university graduates in governmental, education and business elite.

Interfax annually ranks &quot;classical&quot; (or multi-faculty) universities and higher education institutions specialising in law. Interfax&#x27; methodology &quot;quantifies&quot; several &quot;qualitative&quot; factors such as research, teaching standards, public opinion and social and international activity.

&quot;Finance&quot; produces an integrated ranking of higher education institutions specialising in economics and finance. The Journal uses the average score of the Unified State Examination, the number of CFO graduates and the consolidated turnover of companies where graduate CFOs are employed.

====Spain====
National rankings for Spanish universities include the &quot;50 carreras&quot; (50 degrees) from the &quot;El Mundo&quot; newspaper, the CSIC or the IAIF ranking of the UCM.

====Sweden====
In Sweden, the Confederation of Swedish Enterprise (Svenskt Näringsliv) conduct an annual survey and ranking of higher education at study program level, based on entry salary, career development, internationalization, and degree of academic-business collaboration.

====Switzerland====
The swissUp Ranking ranked Swiss university and polytechnic students until 2004. The swissUp Ranking is no longer conducted. Some universities from the German-speaking part of Switzerland, such as ISFOA Lugano take part in the CHE UniversityRanking.

====Turkey====
The URAP Research Laboratory of the Middle East Technical University assesses academic output of Turkish universities, as well as about 300 institutes of higher education worldwide. Their methodology focuses only on article and citation indicators in an attempt to minimize the impact of subjective data.

====Ukraine====
Ukraine&#x27;s Ministry of Education and Science performs official yearly university evaluations. Zerkalo Nedeli newspaper published the top 200–ranked Ukrainian universities in 2007. Kyiv Student Council ranks universities on criteria of student satisfaction.

====United Kingdom====
There are three major rankings of universities in the United Kingdom published by commercial companies: &quot;The Times&quot; and &quot;Sunday Times&quot; Good University Guide, &quot;The Complete University Guide&quot; and &quot;The Guardian University Guide&quot;. Since 2008, &quot;Times Higher Education&quot; has compiled a &quot;Table of Tables&quot; which combines the results of the 3 national league tables. For 2017, the top 5 universities were Cambridge University, Oxford University, University of St Andrews, and Imperial College London and Durham University in joint fourth.

The Research Excellence Framework was the successor to the Research Assessment Exercise in 2014. It is used by the UK government to evaluate the research quality of British universities and determine the distribution of future research funding. In 2014, the top five universities for research power as compiled by Research Fortnight were University of Oxford, University College London, University of Cambridge, University of Edinburgh and University of Manchester.

The Research Assessment Exercises (RAE) were the UK government&#x27;s evaluation of research quality in British Universities. Each subject, called a unit of assessment, was ranked by a peer review panel. The rankings were used in the allocation of government funding. The last assessment was made in 2008. The RAE provided quality ratings for research across all disciplines. Panels used a standard scale for each submission. Ratings ranged from 1 to 5, according to the quantity of work that was judged to reach national or international levels of excellence. Participating institutions receive grants from one of the four higher education funding bodies in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. The top three universities in the 2008 RAE exercise were London School of Economics, Cambridge University and Oxford University.

The Quality Assurance Agency for Higher Education (QAA) assesses undergraduate teaching. QAA is an independent body established by the UK&#x27;s higher education institutions in 1997. QAA was under contract to the Higher Education Funding Council for England to assess quality for English universities. This replaced Teaching Quality Assessments (TQAs) which aimed to assess the administrative, policy and procedural framework within which teaching took place and did not directly assess teaching quality. This inspection-based system was replaced by a system of information provision, including a national student survey. QAA publishes scores which have been used by the league table industry. The first Teaching Excellence Framework is to be published in 2017; this is a rating system (giving gold, silver or bronze ratings to higher education providers) rather than a ranking as such.

===North America===

====Canada====

&quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot;, a Canadian news magazine, publishes an annual ranking of Canadian universities, called the Maclean&#x27;s University Rankings. Ranking criteria include student body characteristics, classes, faculty, finances, library, and reputation. The rankings are split into three categories: schools that focus on undergraduate studies with few to no graduate programs, schools that have both extensive undergraduate studies and an extensive selection of graduate programs and schools that have a professional medical program and a selection of graduate programs.

The University of Calgary produced a formal study examining the ranking methodology, illuminating the factors that determined its rank and criticizing certain aspects of the methodology. The University of Alberta, the University of Toronto and University of Manitoba have expressed displeasure over the ranking system.

A notable difference between rankings in the United States and &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; rankings, however, is that &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; excludes privately funded universities. However, the majority of Canada&#x27;s institutions, including the best-known, are publicly funded.

Beginning in September 2006, over 20 Canadian universities, including several of the most prestigious and largest universities such as the University of Toronto, University of British Columbia, University of Alberta, Concordia University, McMaster University and Dalhousie University, jointly refused to participate. University of Alberta president Indira Samarasekera wrote that &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; initially filed a &quot;Freedom of Information&quot; request but that it was &quot;too late&quot; for the universities to respond. Samarasekera further stated, &quot;Most of [the universities] had already posted the data online, and we directed &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; staff to our Web sites. In instances where the magazine staff couldn&#x27;t find data on our Web site, they chose to use the previous year&#x27;s data.&quot;

====Mexico====
=====Estudio Comparativo de Universidades Mexicanas=====

Mexican institutions have been compared in the &quot;Estudio Comparativo de Universidades Mexicanas&quot; (ECUM) produced within the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México (UNAM). ECUM provides data on institutional participation in articles on ISI Web of Knowledge–indexed journals; faculty participation in each of Mexico&#x27;s three-level National Researchers System (SNI); graduate degrees within National Council of Science and Technology&#x27;s (CONACYT) register of quality graduate programs; and number of academic research bodies (&quot;cuerpos academicos&quot;) according to the Secretariat of Public Education (SEP) program PROMEP.

ECUM provides online access to data for 2007 and 2008 through ExECUM. Institutional data can be visualized through three options:
* A selection of the most prominent 58 universities (43 publics and 13 privates). This selection accounts for more than 60 percent of undergraduate and graduate enrollments. It includes public federal universities (UNAM, Instituto Politécnico Nacional, Universidad Autónoma Metropolitana, Universidad Pedagógica Nacional, Universidad del Ejército y la Fuerza Aérea, Colegio de México, Universidad Autónoma de Chapingo, Universidad Autónoma Agraria Antonio Narro); 35 public state universities (UPES), and a group of private institutions that feature within ECUM&#x27;s selected classification data.
* Result tables for the top 20 institutions in each of the data labels in this study. These include some of the selected universities in addition to the rest of Mexico&#x27;s higher education institutions, as well as institutes, centers and other research producing organizations.
* A personalized selection from more than 600 institutions. These are classified by institutional type, institutional gatherings, by activity sector alphabetically.

ExECUM allows users to establish comparison types and levels which they consider relevant. Data is presented in raw form with virtually no derived indicators. Users can relate variables and build indicators according to their own analytical perspectives.

Based on this comparative study project, ECUM&#x27;s creator, the Dirección General de Evaluación Institucional, published reports providing an analysis of the data for 2007 and 2008.

====United States====


===Oceania===

====Australia====
The Good Universities Guide and Excellence in Research for Australia annually rank domestic universities.

===South America===

====QS University Rankings: Latin America====

QS Quacquarelli Symonds, in addition to their QS World University Rankings, publish an annual ranking of the top 300 universities in Latin America. The eighth instalment, released for the 2016/17 academic year, places the Universidade de São Paulo as the region&#x27;s best university.

====Argentina====
In Argentina the National Commission for University Evaluation and Accreditation ranks higher education programs by evaluation and accreditation.

====Brazil====
The latest ranking, the Ranking Universitário Folha (RUF) website (in Portuguese), was created by the newspaper . This ranking is based on the combination of four indicators: education quality, research quality, market assessment and an innovation indicator.

====Chile====
In Chile the &quot;Comisión Nacional de Acreditación&quot; (National Commission of Accreditation of the Universities) manages evaluation and accreditation. It also ranks universities according to accreditation levels. Other commercial rankings are made by research magazines, including &quot;Qué Pasa&quot; and &quot;América Economía&quot;. &quot;Qué Pasa&#x27;s&quot; ranking evaluates perception and quality following surveys of approximately 1,000 employers across the country. &quot;América Economía&quot; ranking considers quality of students, quality of teachers, rating of professors by student, research productivity, internationalization, integration with the community, student life quality and inclusion of students from lower social strata.

== Criticism ==

Critics argue that rankings can divert universities&#x27; attention away from teaching and social responsibility towards the type of scientific research valued by indicators used for ranking exercises. There have also been concerns that by applying a limited set of criteria to world universities, and given the strong desire to feature in the top 200 universities, rankings actually encourage the homogenization of higher education institutions, making them less responsive and less relevant to their immediate contexts. The fact that rankings are also said to favour the advantage enjoyed by the 200 best-ranked institutions has important implications for equity.

<text>Urban economics is broadly the economic study of urban areas; as such, it involves using the tools of economics to analyze urban issues such as crime, education, public transit, housing, and local government finance. More specifically, it is a branch of microeconomics that studies the urban spatial structure and the location of households and firms .

Historically, much like economics generally, urban economics was influenced by multiple schools of thought, including original institutional economics and Marxist economics. These heterodox economic currents continue to be used in contemporary political-economic analyses of cities. But, most urban economics today is neoclassical in orientation and centred largely around urban experiences in the Global North. This dominant urban economics also influences mainstream media like &quot;The Economist.&quot; Today, much urban economic analysis relies on a particular model of urban spatial structure, the monocentric city model pioneered in the 1960s by William Alonso, Richard Muth, and Edwin Mills. While most other forms of neoclassical economics do not account for spatial relationships between individuals and organizations, urban economics focuses on these spatial relationships to understand the economic motivations underlying the formation, functioning, and development of cities.

Since its formulation in 1964, Alonso&#x27;s monocentric city model of a disc-shaped Central Business District (CBD) and the surrounding residential region has served as a starting point for urban economic analysis. Monocentricity has weakened over time because of changes in technology, particularly, faster and cheaper transportation (which makes it possible for commuters to live farther from their jobs in the CBD) and communications (which allow back-office operations to move out of the CBD).

Additionally, recent research has sought to explain the polycentricity described in Joel Garreau&#x27;s Edge City. Several explanations for polycentric expansion have been proposed and summarized in models that account for factors such as utility gains from lower average land rents and increasing (or constant) returns due to economies of agglomeration .

==Introduction==
Urban economics is rooted in the location theories of von Thünen, Alonso, Christaller, and Lösch that began the process of spatial economic analysis . Economics is the study of the allocation of scarce resources, and as all economic phenomena take place within a geographical space, urban economics focuses on the allocation of resources across space in relation to urban areas . Other branches of economics ignore the spatial aspects of decision making but urban economics focuses not only on the location decisions of firms but also of cities themselves as cities themselves represent centers of economic activity .

Many spatial economic topics can be analyzed within either an urban or regional economics framework as some economic phenomena primarily affect localized urban areas while others are felt over much larger regional areas . Arthur O&#x27;Sullivan believes urban economics is divided into six related themes: market forces in the development of cities, land use within cities, urban transportation, urban problems and public policy, housing and public policy, and local government expenditures and taxes. .

==Market forces in the development of cities==
Market forces in the development of cities relate to how the location decision of firms and households causes the development of cities. The nature and behavior of markets depend somewhat on their locations therefore market performance partly depends on geography.. If a firm locates in a geographically isolated region, its market performance will be different than a firm located in a concentrated region. The location decisions of both firms and households create cities that differ in size and economic structure. When industries cluster, like in Silicon Valley in California, they create urban areas with dominant firms and distinct economies.

By looking at location decisions of firms and households, the urban economist is able to address why cities develop where they do, why some cities are large and others small, what causes economic growth and decline, and how local governments affect urban growth . Because urban economics is concerned with asking questions about the nature and workings of the economy of a city, models and techniques developed within the field are primarily designed to analyze phenomena that are confined within the limits of a single city .

==Land use==
Looking at land use within metropolitan areas, the urban economist seeks to analyze the spatial organization of activities within cities. In attempts to explain observed patterns of land use, the urban economist examines the intra-city location choices of firms and households. Considering the spatial organization of activities within cities, urban economics addresses questions in terms of what determines the price of land and why those prices vary across space, the economic forces that caused the spread of employment from the central core of cities outward, identifying land-use controls, such as zoning, and interpreting how such controls affect the urban economy .

==Economic policy==
Economic policy is often implemented at the urban level thus economic policy is often tied to urban policy . Urban problems and public policy tie into urban economics as the theme relates urban problems, such as poverty or crime, to economics by seeking to answer questions with economic guidance. For example, does the tendency for the poor to live close to one another make them even poorer? .

==Transportation and economics==
Urban transportation is a theme of urban economics because it affects land-use patterns as transportation affects the relative accessibility of different sites. Issues that tie urban transportation to urban economics include the deficit that most transit authorities have and efficiency questions about proposed transportation developments such as light-rail .

==Housing and public policy==
Housing and public policy relate to urban economics as housing is a unique type of commodity. Because housing is immobile, when a household chooses a dwelling, it is also choosing a location. Urban economists analyze the location choices of households in conjunction with the market effects of housing policies .
In analyzing housing policies, we make use of market structures e.g., perfect market structure. There are however problems encountered in making this analysis such as funding, uncertainty, space, etc.

==Government expenditures and taxes==
The final theme of local government expenditures and taxes relates to urban economics as it analyzes the efficiency of the fragmented local governments presiding in metropolitan areas .

<text>The Territory of Wyoming was an organized incorporated territory of the United States that existed from July 25, 1868, until July 10, 1890, when it was admitted to the Union as the State of Wyoming. Cheyenne was the territorial capital. The boundaries of the Wyoming Territory were identical to those of the modern State of Wyoming.

==Background==
Because of Wyoming&#x27;s location as part of the Louisiana Purchase, the Oregon Country, and the Mexican Cession, the land which became Wyoming has a complicated history of territorial relationships. Portions of the territory, which eventually fell under Wyoming&#x27;s jurisdiction, were at various points associated with the territories of Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Dakota, Nebraska, and Utah, and had previously belonged to the independent states of Great Britain, France, Spain, Mexico, and Texas.

The portion of the Wyoming Territory east of the continental divide was acquired by the U.S. in the 1803 Louisiana Purchase and organized into the Nebraska Territory in 1854. On March 2, 1861, the northern portion of the Nebraska Territory, including the northeastern portion of future Wyoming Territory, became part of the Dakota Territory, while the southeastern portion remained with Nebraska, forming an extended Nebraska &quot;panhandle&quot;. In 1863, the Idaho Territory was formed; it included the entirety of the modern states of Idaho and Montana and almost all of modern Wyoming save the southwest corner.

The portion of the Wyoming Territory west of the continental divide and north of the 42nd parallel was originally part of the Oregon Country, which was organized into the Oregon Territory in 1848; when Oregon entered the union as a state under its present boundaries in 1859, this land became part of the Washington Territory. Although, its eastern part had been granted to the Nebraska Territory in 1854. The Idaho Territory subsumed this land as well, in 1863.

The southwestern corner of what became the Wyoming Territory, south of the 42nd parallel, became part of the United States with the 1848 Mexican Cession. An eastern section of this was once claimed by the Republic of Texas. In 1851, the portion of this land west of the continental divide was made part of the Utah Territory, and, with the organization of the Colorado Territory in 1861, most of it was transferred to the Nebraska Territory and subsumed into the Idaho Territory, in 1863. A small corner of Wyoming remained part of Utah until the creation of the Wyoming Territory, in 1868.

In 1864, with the formation of the Montana Territory, the southeastern section of the Idaho Territory (most of modern Wyoming) became briefly part of Dakota Territory once again, although a strip of land along the western border of what would become Wyoming remained part of the Idaho Territory.

==History==

Native Americans lived in the region for centuries. On July 25, 1868, President Andrew Johnson signed the Wyoming Organic Act creating the Wyoming Territory using lands from the Dakota, Idaho, and Utah territories, and on April 17, 1869, the territorial government was organized. In 1869 the territory granted women&#x27;s suffrage for all elections in an attempt to attract new settlers. A later attempt to repeal the law was defeated after the governor vetoed the repeal; the legislature failed to override the veto by one vote.

In 1872, Wyoming Territory had five counties: Albany, Carbon, Laramie, Sweetwater, and Uinta, each a tall narrow rectangle comprising approximately one-fifth of the territory.

On July 10, 1890, the territory was admitted as the forty-fourth state seven days after the Idaho territory was admitted by President Benjamin Harrison.

<text>Punjab National Bank (abbreviated as PNB) is an Indian government bank based in New Delhi. It was founded in May 1894 and is the second-largest public sector bank in India in terms of its business volumes, with over 180 million customers, 12,248 branches, and 13,000+ ATMs.

PNB has a banking subsidiary in the UK (PNB International Bank, with seven branches in the UK), as well as branches in Hong Kong, Kowloon, Dubai, and Kabul. It has representative offices in Almaty (Kazakhstan), Dubai (United Arab Emirates), Shanghai (China), Oslo (Norway), and Sydney (Australia). In Bhutan, it owns 51% of Druk PNB Bank, which has five branches. In Nepal, PNB owns 20% of Everest Bank, which has 122 branches. PNB also owns 41.64% of JSC (SB) PNB Bank in Kazakhstan, which has four branches. Punjab National Bank is rated CARE AA+ (Stable) by CareEdge Ratings.

==History==
Punjab National Bank is a Public sector undertakings in India (PSU) working under the government of India regulated by the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934 and the Banking Regulation Act, 1949. It was registered on 19 May 1894 under the Indian Companies Act, with its office in Anarkali Bazaar, in pre-independent India (present-day Pakistan). The founding board was drawn from different parts of India professing different faiths and of varying backgrounds, with the common objective of creating a truly national bank that would further the economic interest of the country. PNB&#x27;s founders included several leaders of the Swadeshi movement such as,Dyal Singh Majithia and Lala Harkishen Lal, Lala Lalchand, Kali Prosanna Roy, E. C. Jessawala, Prabhu Dayal, Bakshi Jaishi Ram, and Lala Dholan Dass. Lala Lajpat Rai was actively associated with the management of the Bank in its early years. The board first met on 23 May 1894. The bank opened for business on 12 April 1895 in Lahore.

PNB is the first Indian bank to have been started solely with Indian capital that survives to the present, as the earlier Oudh Commercial Bank, which was established in 1881, failed in 1958.

Mahatma Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru, Lal Bahadur Shastri, Indira Gandhi and the Jalianwala Bagh Committee have held PNB accounts.

===Timeline===

In 1900 PNB established its first branch outside Lahore in India. Branches in Karachi and Peshawar followed. The next major event occurred in 1940 when PNB absorbed Bhagwan (or Bhugwan) Dass Bank, which had its head office in Dehra.

At the Partition of India and the creation of Pakistan, PNB lost its premises in Lahore, but continued to operate in Pakistan. Partition forced PNB to close 92 offices in West Pakistan, one-third of its total number of branches, and which held 40% of the total deposits. PNB still maintained a few caretaker branches. On 31 March 1947, even before Partition, PNB had decided to leave Lahore and transfer its registered office to India; it received permission from the Lahore High Court on 20 June 1947, at which time it established a new head office at Under Hill Road, Civil Lines in New Delhi. Lala Yodh Raj was the Chairman of the Bank.

In 1951, PNB acquired the 39 branches of Bharat Bank (est. 1942). Bharat Bank became Bharat Nidhi Ltd. In 1960, PNB again shifted its head office, this time from Calcutta to Delhi. In 1961, PNB acquired Universal Bank of India, which Ramakrishna Jain had established in 1938 in Dalmianagar, Bihar. PNB also amalgamated Indo Commercial Bank (est. 1932 by S. N. N. Sankaralinga Iyer) in a rescue. In 1963, The Burmese revolutionary government nationalised PNB&#x27;s branch in Rangoon (now Yangon). This became People&#x27;s Bank No. 7. After the Indo-Pak war of 1965, the government of Pakistan seized all the offices in Pakistan of Indian banks in September 1965. PNB also had one or more branches in East Pakistan (now Bangladesh).

The government of India (GOI) nationalised PNB and 13 other major commercial banks, on 19 July 1969. In 1976 or 1978, PNB opened a branch in London. some ten years later, in 1986, the Reserve Bank of India required PNB to transfer its London branch to State Bank of India after the branch was involved in a fraud scandal. That same year, 1986, PNB acquired Hindustan Commercial Bank (est. 1943) in a rescue. The acquisition added Hindustan&#x27;s 142 branches to PNB&#x27;s network. In 1993, PNB acquired New Bank of India, which the GOI had nationalised in 1980. In 1998 PNB set up a representative office in Almaty, Kazakhstan.

In 2003, PNB took over Nedungadi Bank, the oldest private sector bank in Kerala. At the time of the merger with PNB, Nedungadi Bank&#x27;s shares had zero value, with the result that its shareholders received no payment for their shares. PNB also opened a representative office in London. In 2004, PNB established a branch in Kabul, Afghanistan, a representative office in Shanghai, and another in Dubai. PNB also established an alliance with Everest Bank in Nepal that permits migrants to transfer funds easily between India and Everest Bank&#x27;s 12 branches in Nepal. Currently, PNB owns 20% of Everest Bank. Two years later, PNB established PNBIL – Punjab National Bank (International) – in the UK, with two offices, one in London, and one in Southall. Since then it has opened more branches, this time in Leicester, Birmingham, Ilford, Wembley, and Wolverhampton. PNB also opened a branch in Hong Kong. In January 2009, PNB established a representative office in Oslo, Norway. PNB hopes to upgrade this to a branch in due course. In January 2010, PNB established a subsidiary in Bhutan. PNB owns 51% of Druk PNB Bank, which has branches in Thimphu, Phuntsholing, and Wangdue. Local investors own the remaining shares. Then on 1 May, PNB opened its branch in Dubai&#x27;s financial center. PNB purchased a small minority stake in Kazakhstan-based JSC Danabank established on 20 October 1992 in Pavlodar. Within the year PNB increased its ownership till 84% of what has become JSC (SB) PNB, with its share currently decreased to 49%.

<doc id="448860" wikidata="Q12485466" url="?curid=448860" title="Hay Fever (play)">
<text>Hay Fever is a comic play written by Noël Coward in 1924. Its first production was in the West End in 1925 with Marie Tempest as Judith Bliss. A cross between high farce and a comedy of manners, the play is set in an English country house in the 1920s, and deals with the four eccentric members of the Bliss family and their outlandish behaviour when they each invite a guest to spend the weekend. The self-centred behaviour of the hosts finally drives their guests to flee while the Blisses are so engaged in a family row that they do not notice their guests&#x27; furtive departure.

The play&#x27;s original production opened in London in 1925 and ran for 337 performances. Coward wrote the piece with Tempest in mind for the central role of Judith. In later productions the part has been played by actresses including Constance Collier, Edith Evans, Constance Cummings, Rosemary Harris, Judi Dench, Geraldine McEwan and Felicity Kendal. &quot;Hay Fever&quot; has been continually revived in Britain, the US and elsewhere, and has been adapted frequently for radio and television.

==Background==
In 1921 Coward first visited New York, hoping to interest American producers in his plays. During that summer he became a friend of the playwright Hartley Manners and his wife, the eccentric actress Laurette Taylor. Coward wrote, &quot;It was inevitable that someone should eventually utilise portions of this eccentricity in a play, and I am only grateful to Fate that no guest of the Hartley Manners thought of writing &quot;Hay Fever&quot; before I did&quot;. Coward&#x27;s biographer Philip Hoare and others also note elements of Evangeline Astley Cooper – an English eccentric of whom the young Coward was a protégé – in the central character, Judith Bliss. The two women reacted very differently to Coward&#x27;s caricature of them. Taylor was offended (either by Coward&#x27;s Judith or the overplaying of the role in the Broadway production, or both), and Cooper was much amused.

Coward wrote the play in three days in 1924, at first giving it the title &quot;Still Life&quot; before adopting &quot;Hay Fever&quot; prior to the first production. He intended the star role, Judith, for the actress Marie Tempest, &quot;whom I revered and adored&quot;. Though she found it amusing, she thought it not substantial enough for a whole evening, but changed her mind after the success of Coward&#x27;s &quot;The Vortex&quot; later in 1924.

Coward introduces one of his signature theatrical devices at the end of the play, where the four guests tiptoe out as the curtain falls, leaving disorder behind them – a device that he also used in various forms in &quot;Present Laughter&quot;, &quot;Private Lives&quot; and &quot;Blithe Spirit.&quot;

==Original productions==
&quot;Hay Fever&quot; opened at the Ambassadors Theatre on 8 June 1925, directed by Coward, and transferred to the larger Criterion Theatre on 7 September 1925; it ran for 337 performances. Coward remembered in 1964 that the notices &quot;were amiable and well-disposed although far from effusive. It was noted, as indeed it has been today, that the play had no plot and that there were few if any &#x27;witty&#x27; lines.&quot; &quot;Hay Fever&quot; opened the same year at the Maxine Elliott Theatre in New York; the star, Laura Hope Crews, was accused of over-acting, not all the supporting cast were competent, and the production closed after 49 performances.

The original casts in London and New York were:

==Plot==
The action is set in the Hall of David Bliss&#x27;s house at Cookham, Berkshire, by the River Thames.

===Act I===
;A Saturday afternoon in June

Sorel and Simon Bliss, a brother and sister, exchange artistic and bohemian dialogue. Judith, their mother, displays the absent-minded theatricality of a retired star actress, and David, their father, a novelist, is concentrating on finishing his latest book. Each of the four members of the Bliss family, without consulting the others, has invited a guest for the weekend. Judith announces that she has decided to return to the stage in one of her old hits, &quot;Love&#x27;s Whirlwind&quot;. She and Sorel and Simon amuse themselves acting out a melodramatic passage from the play beginning, &quot;Is this a game?&quot; &quot;Yes, and a game that must be played to the finish!&quot; They are interrupted by the ringing of the doorbell.

Clara, Judith&#x27;s former dresser and now her housekeeper, opens the door to the first of the four guests, Sandy Tyrell, a sporty fan of Judith&#x27;s. The next arrival is the vampish Myra Arundel, whom Simon has invited. The other two guests arrive together: Richard Greatham, a diplomat, and Jackie Coryton, a brainless but good-hearted young flapper. Tea is served. Conversation is stilted and eventually grinds to a halt. The scene ends in total and awkward silence.

===Act II===
;After dinner that night

The family insists that everyone should join in a parlour game, a variety of charades in which one person must guess the adverb being acted out by the others. The Blisses are in their element, but the guests flounder and the game breaks up. Simon and Jackie exit to the garden, Sorel drags Sandy into the library, and David takes Myra outside.

Left alone with Richard, Judith flirts with him, and when he chastely kisses her she theatrically over-reacts as though they were conducting a serious affair. She nonplusses Richard by talking of breaking the news to David. She in turn is nonplussed to discover Sandy and Sorel kissing in the library. That too has been mere flirtation, but both Judith and Sorel enjoy themselves by exaggerating it. Judith gives a performance nobly renouncing her claim on Sandy, and exits. Sorel explains to Sandy that she was just playing the theatrical game for Judith&#x27;s benefit, as &quot;one always plays up to Mother in this house; it&#x27;s a sort of unwritten law.&quot; They leave.

David and Myra enter. They too indulge in a little light flirtation, at the height of which Judith enters and finds them kissing. She makes a theatrical scene, with which David dutifully plays along. Simon rushes in violently, announcing that he and Jackie are engaged. Sorel and Sandy enter from the library, Judith goes into yet another bout of over-theatrical emoting. In the ensuing uproar, Richard asks &quot;Is this a game?&quot; Judith, Sorel and Simon seize on this cue from &quot;Love&#x27;s Whirlwind&quot; and trot out the melodramatic dialogue as they had in Act I. David is overcome with laughter and the uncomprehending guests are dazed and aghast as Judith ends the scene by falling to the floor as if in a faint.

===Act III===
;The next morning

A breakfast table has been laid in the hall. Sandy enters and begins eating nervously. At the sound of someone approaching he escapes into the library. Jackie enters, helps herself to some breakfast and bursts into tears. Sandy comes out and they discuss how uncomfortable they were the night before and how mad the Bliss family are. When they hear people approaching, they both retreat to the library. Myra and Richard now enter and begin breakfast. Their conversation mirrors that of Sandy and Jackie, who emerge from the library to join them. All four decide that they are going to return to London without delay. Sandy agrees to drive them in his motor car. They go upstairs to collect their things.

Judith comes down, asks Clara for the Sunday papers and begins reading aloud what the gossip columns say about her. The rest of her family enter. David proposes to read them the final chapter of his novel. Immediately, a minor detail about the geography of Paris is blown into a full-scale family row, with everyone talking at once about whether the Rue Saint-Honoré does or does not connect with the Place de la Concorde and hurling insults at each other. They are so wrapped up in their private row that they do not notice when the four visitors tiptoe down the stairs and out of the house. The Blisses are only momentarily distracted when the slam of the door alerts them to the flight of their guests. Judith comments, &quot;How very rude!&quot; and David adds, &quot;People really do behave in the most extraordinary manner these days.&quot; Then, with no further thought of their four tormented guests, they happily return to David&#x27;s manuscript and to what passes for their normal family life.

==Revivals==
===West End===
The first London revival was in 1933 at the Shaftesbury Theatre with Constance Collier as Judith. In 1941 the piece was revived at the Vaudeville Theatre in a repertory series of English comedies.

A 1964 production at The Old Vic was the National Theatre Company&#x27;s first production by a living author. It was directed by Coward, and starred Edith Evans as Judith. The rest of the cast comprised Derek Jacobi as Simon, Maggie Smith as Myra, Barbara Hicks as Clara, Anthony Nicholls as David, Robert Stephens as Sandy, Robert Lang as Richard, and Lynn Redgrave as Jackie. After being invited to direct the production, Coward wrote, &quot;I am thrilled and flattered and frankly a little flabbergasted that the National Theatre should have had the curious perceptiveness to choose a very early play of mine and to give it a cast that could play the Albanian telephone directory.&quot; The last London revival in Coward&#x27;s lifetime was at the Duke of York&#x27;s Theatre in 1968, with Celia Johnson as Judith and a cast including Roland Culver, Simon Williams, Richard Vernon and Prunella Scales.

A revival at the Queen&#x27;s Theatre in 1983 starred Penelope Keith as Judith, with a cast including Moray Watson, Donald Pickering and Abigail McKern. A 1992 revival at the Albery Theatre starred Maria Aitken as Judith, with a cast including Abigail Cruttenden, Maria Charles, John Standing, Carmen du Sautoy, Christopher Godwin and Sara Crowe. A 1999 Savoy Theatre cast starred Geraldine McEwan as Judith, with Monica Dolan, Stephen Mangan, Peter Blythe, Sylvestra Le Touzel, Malcolm Sinclair, and Cathryn Bradshaw. The 2006 Haymarket Theatre cast included Kim Medcalf as Sorel, Dan Stevens as Simon, Judi Dench as Judith, Peter Bowles as David, Charles Edwards as Sandy, and Belinda Lang as Myra. The following UK tour, in 2007, cast Stephanie Beacham as Judith, Christopher Timothy as David, William Ellis as Simon, Christopher Naylor as Sandy, and Andrew Hall as Richard.

A 2012 revival at the Noël Coward Theatre included in the cast Lindsay Duncan as Judith, Jeremy Northam as Richard, Kevin McNally as David, Olivia Colman as Myra, Sam Callis as Sandy, Freddie Fox as Simon, Amy Morgan as Jackie, Phoebe Waller-Bridge as Sorrel, and Jenny Galloway as Clara. The 2014 touring production transferred to the Duke of York&#x27;s Theatre in 2015.

===Other UK productions===
While the play continued its first West End run, Eva Moore headed the cast in a touring production, which played to what &quot;The Stage&quot; called &quot;phenomenal business&quot; around Britain. Phyllis Calvert headed the cast in a UK tour of &quot;Hay Fever&quot; in 1975. A production directed by Michael Blakemore opened at the Lyric Theatre, Hammersmith in 1980 starring Constance Cummings as Judith. In 1988 Googie Withers starred in a revival at the Chichester Festival Theatre. Dora Bryan played Judith in a UK tour in 1992. A production by Alan Strachan opened at the Theatr Clwyd in October 1992 and transferred to the West End the following month (see above). In 2010, Celia Imrie played Judith at the Rose Theatre, Kingston, succeeded later in the run by Nichola McAuliffe. In 2014 Felicity Kendal starred as Judith in a UK tour with Simon Shepherd as David, Sara Stewart as Myra, Celeste Dodwell as Jackie, and Alice Orr-Ewing as Sorrel.

Collier played Judith in a 1931 revival at Avon Theatre in New York. In 1937 John Craven starred in the play at Harold Lloyd&#x27;s Beverly Hills Little Theatre for Professionals. In a 1970 revival at the Helen Hayes Theatre, New York, the cast included Roberta Maxwell as Sorel, Sam Waterston as Simon, Sudie Bond as Clara, Shirley Booth as Judith, John Williams as David, John Tillinger as Sandy, Marian Mercer as Myra, and Carole Shelley as Jackie.
A 1985 production at the Music Box Theatre in New York had a cast including Mia Dillon as Sorel, Robert Joy as Simon, Barbara Bryne as Clara, Rosemary Harris as Judith, Roy Dotrice as David, Campbell Scott as Sandy, Carolyn Seymour as Myra, Charles Kimbrough as Richard, and Deborah Rush.

The play was translated into French with the title &quot;Week End&quot;, and given at the Théâtre de la Potinière, Paris in 1928. It was well received by audiences and critics; one of the latter wrote that there was &quot;a suggestion of Molière&quot; about it. The first professional production of the play in Australia was given by the Allan Wilkie and Hunter-Watts company at the Tivoli Theatre, Melbourne in February 1931, with Wilkie and Hunter-Watts as David and Judith. &quot;The Melbourne Argus&quot; commented, &quot;The situations are handled deliciously, and the dialogue, highly polished and clever, is at times brutally cynical ... we leave the theatre wondering between our chuckles whether we have any genuine emotions left&quot;.

2014 revivals included one at the Stratford Festival, Canada, with Lucy Peacock as Judith, Cynthia Dale as Myra, and Tyrone Savage as Sandy.

==Critical reception==

The initial notices in the British press were moderately favourable. Coward told a theatre colleague, Basil Dean, &quot;I&#x27;m very surprised it hasn&#x27;t irritated the Press more – some of them actually seem to have been amused by it.&quot; Herbert Farjeon in &quot;The Sphere&quot; said &quot;&quot;Hay Fever&quot; begins admirably, tails off, picks up, is disappointing because it is not better, and yet is pleasing because it is so bright&quot;. The critic in &quot;The Tatler&quot; thought that on the whole &quot;Hay Fever&quot; was &quot;most amusing ... there is no real plot ... but it is very funny&quot;. &quot;The Illustrated Sporting and Dramatic News&quot; found the play &quot;the best of fun ... Let us hope Mr Coward will supply more goods of this quality&quot;. &quot;The Times&quot; said the play was &quot;all, as usual, Mr Coward&#x27;s fun. All the better fun, be it added, for being punctuated, as usual, with Mr Coward&#x27;s wit&quot;, but thought it was essentially a vehicle for Marie Tempest&#x27;s &quot;brilliantly comic acting&quot;. &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; thought the first act promised more than the two later acts could deliver, and that although Coward&#x27;s touch had not deserted him, &quot;this particular jest does not quite come off&quot;, but it was a &quot;very amusing comedy ... so light and airy&quot;. Reviewers in &quot;The Daily News&quot; and &quot;The Tatler&quot; both commented that Coward&#x27;s choice of title seemed inexplicable. In 2010 &quot;The Times&#x27;s&quot; theatre critic, though offering no firm explanation, commented, &quot;In some productions one&#x27;s eyes can stream, though only with laughter&quot;.

After the first Broadway production &quot;The New York Times&quot; observed, &quot;If Mr Coward had packed his play with half the humor the actors bring to their parts, &quot;Hay Fever&quot; might be steadily amusing; at present it has many colorless moments&quot;. Six years later, after the first New York revival, the same paper said that the play was &quot;theatrical satire, and infernally delicate and accomplished. It is dry, subtle, mettlesome comedy, and it is enormously entertaining&quot;. After the 1985 revival opened, the paper said:
Coward was aware that the play lacked obvious witticisms. He commented:
In a study of Coward&#x27;s plays, published in 1982, John Lahr called &quot;Hay Fever&quot; &quot;the first and the finest of his major plays&quot;. In 2014 Michael Billington wrote of a new production: &quot;I found myself wondering why, 90 years after it was written, Noël Coward&#x27;s comedy still proves so astonishingly durable. I suspect it is because it combines astute observation with ironclad technique&quot;.

==Adaptations==
The play was broadcast on radio in 1937 in both the US (CBS Radio) and Britain (BBC radio, with Marie Tempest in her original stage role.) In later BBC radio adaptations, Judith has been played by Athene Seyler (1952), Peggy Ashcroft (1971), and Judi Dench (1993).

&quot;Hay Fever&quot; was the first of Coward&#x27;s plays to be televised: an NBC production in 1939 starred Isobel Elsom as Judith. A UK television production in 1960 in ITV&#x27;s &quot;Play of the Week&quot; series featured Edith Evans as Judith Bliss and Maggie Smith as Jackie Coryton. This version is not known to have survived. &quot;The Times&quot; reviewed this broadcast, calling &quot;Hay Fever&quot; &quot;Mr Noel Coward&#x27;s best play ... one of the most perfectly engineered comedies of the century.&quot; Other members of the television cast were Pamela Brown, George Devine, Paul Eddington and Richard Wattis. Evans and Smith later played in the stage production of &quot;Hay Fever&quot; under the author&#x27;s direction in the National Theatre Company&#x27;s revival in 1964 with Smith switching from the ingénue role of Jackie to that of the vampish Myra. Another lost production of the play in the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Play of the Month&quot; series was transmitted in 1968. This featured Lucy Fleming as Sorel, Ian McKellen as Simon, Celia Johnson as Judith, Dennis Price as David, Richard Briers as Sandy, Anna Massey as Myra, Charles Gray as Richard, and Vickery Turner as Jackie.

The BBC recorded another television production, which was first shown in the UK during Christmas 1984. This version stars Penelope Keith as Judith, Eddington as David, Patricia Hodge as Myra, Michael Siberry as Simon, Phoebe Nicholls as Sorel and Benjamin Whitrow as Richard.

==Publication==
&quot;Hay Fever&quot; was first published in 1925 in the &quot;Contemporary British Dramatists&quot; series issued by the publisher Ernest Benn. Unlike some of Coward&#x27;s other plays it had no dedicatee, but in 1964, when Heinemann published a new edition with an introduction by the author, marking the National Theatre revival, Coward dedicated it to his long-time secretary, Lorn Lorraine.

<doc id="448863" wikidata="Q1779610" url="?curid=448863" title="South Pass (Wyoming)">
<text>South Pass (elevation and ) is a route across the Continental Divide, in the Rocky Mountains in southwestern Wyoming. It lies in a broad high region, wide, between the nearly Wind River Range to the north and the over Oregon Buttes and arid, saline near-impassable Great Divide Basin to the south. The Pass lies in southwestern Fremont County, approximately SSW of Lander.

Though it approaches a mile and a half high, South Pass is the lowest point on the Continental Divide between the Central and Southern Rocky Mountains. The passes furnish a natural crossing point of the Rockies. The historic pass became the route for emigrants on the Oregon, California, and Mormon trails to the West during the 19th century. It was designated as a U.S. National Historic Landmark on January 20, 1961.

==History==
Though well known to Native Americans, South Pass was first traversed in 1812 by European American explorers who were seeking a safer way to return from the West Coast than they had taken to it. As a natural crossing point of the Rockies its pioneering was a significant achievement in the westward expansion of the United States. Because the Lewis and Clark Expedition of 1803-1806 was searching for a water route across the Continental Divide it did not learn of South Pass from local peoples. Instead, the expedition followed a northerly route up the Missouri River, crossing the Rockies over difficult passes in the Bitterroot Range between present-day Montana and Idaho.

The first recorded crossing was made on October 22, 1812 by Robert Stuart, and six companions from the Pacific Fur Company of John Jacob Astor. They were trying to avoid Crow warriors further north, on their return to St. Louis, Missouri from Astoria, Oregon. A Shoshone had told Stuart of &quot;...a shorter trace to the South than that by which Mr. Hunt had traversed the R. Mountains...&quot; In 1856 Ramsay Crooks, one of the party, wrote a letter describing their journey:

Stuart&#x27;s &quot;Travel Memorandum&quot; was left with President James Madison, but the War of 1812 preempted western exploration. A translation of his journal was published in an 1821 French journal, but South Pass would have to be rediscovered by later explorers from information provided by Crow Indians.

In 1823 William Henry Ashley&#x27;s Rocky Mountain Fur Company led to the rediscovery of the pass. Jedediah Smith&#x27;s party, part of Ashley&#x27;s Hundred, made the first crossing traveling east to west in Feb. 1824. Ashley subsequently established the first Rocky Mountain Rendezvous in 1825. Ashley sold out to Smith, William Sublette, and David Jackson in 1826, becoming their supplier.

In 1832 Captain Benjamin Bonneville, aided by Michel Cerre and Joseph R. Walker, blazed a wagon road across the pass. Their caravan of 20 wagons, in place of the usual pack-train, supplied the fur trappers from Fort Bonneville, which they established near the Green River.

In 1834, Nathaniel Jarvis Wyeth led the first Methodist missionaries Jason Lee, Daniel Lee, and Cyrus Shepard across the pass. They were accompanied by the naturalist John Kirk Townsend, who documented this first use of the Oregon-California Trail, avoiding the Lander Cutoff used by the fur traders. Wyeth then established Fort Hall on the Snake River and the Lees settled the Willamette Valley. Robert &quot;Doc&quot; Newell&#x27;s first child was born at South Pass in June 1835. Also in 1835, Thomas Fitzpatrick led Protestant missionaries Samuel Parker and Dr. Marcus Whitman across the pass. In 1836, Fitzpatrick guided the &quot;First White Women to Cross This Pass&quot;, Narcissa Whitman and Eliza Hart Spalding, along with and their husbands, plus Miles Goodyear and William Gray. By 1838, four additional American missionary women had crossed the pass, Myra Fairbanks Eells, Mary Richardson Walker, Mary Augusta Dix Gray and Sarah Gilbert White Smith.

The first family of emigrants, the Walkers, crossed the pass in 1840 with the intention of settling in Oregon. Joel Pickens Walker, and his wife Mary Young Walker, made the journey with their four children. In 1841, Fitzpatrick led the Bartleson-Bidwell Party across the pass, the first wagon train.

In 1842, John C. Fremont led a United States Army Corps of Topographical Engineers expedition to survey South Pass. Reaching the pass on 8 Aug. 1842, Fremont wrote, &quot;The ascent had been so gradual, that, with all the intimate knowledge possessed by Carson, who had made the country his home for seventeen years, we were obliged to watch very closely to find the place at which we had reached the culminating point.&quot; In his 1843 expedition, Fremont was able to determine the elevation of the pass at 7,490 feet above sea level. He wrote, &quot;...it may be assumed to be about half-way between the Mississippi and the Pacific ocean, on the common traveling route...the emigrant road to Oregon.&quot;

Stephen W. Kearny led the first military expedition to South Pass in 1845. By 1848, 18,487 Americans had crossed the pass, and over 300,000 by 1860.

Gold had been discovered in the gulches near the pass as early as 1842. However, it was not until 1867, when an ore sample was transported to Salt Lake City, that an influx of miners descended into the region. The gold rush led to the establishment of booming mining communities, such as South Pass City and Atlantic City. The placer gold in the streams was exhausted quickly, however, and by 1870 the miners began leaving the region. In 1884, Emile Granier, a French mining engineer, established a hydraulic mining operation that allowed gold mining to continue. Gold mining was revived in nearby Rock Creek in the 1930s. Additionally, from 1962 through 1983, a U.S. Steel iron ore mine operated in Atlantic City, and the company&#x27;s Atlantic City Mine Railroad crossed South Pass.

After passage of the Pacific Telegraph Act of 1860, South Pass Station was established in 1861, at Last Crossing on the Sweetwater River.
South Pass was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1961.

Wyoming Highway 28 traverses the modern pass, roughly following the route of the Oregon Trail. Wagon ruts are still clearly visible at numerous sites within a few miles of the highway.

==Topography==
The pass is a broad open saddle with prairie and sagebrush, allowing a broad and nearly level route between the Atlantic and Pacific watersheds. The Sweetwater River flows past the east side of the pass, and Pacific Creek rises on the west side. Historic South Pass is the lower of the two passes (elevation ), and was the easy crossing point used by emigrants. Wyoming Highway 28 crosses the Continental Divide to the northwest at elevation , and its crossing is also named South Pass. The Lander Cutoff Route crosses the Continental Divide at the far northwest end of the broad South Pass region, about to the northwest of the South Passes, at an elevation of .

<text>Private Lives is a 1930 comedy of manners in three acts by Noël Coward. It concerns a divorced couple who, while honeymooning with their new spouses, discover that they are staying in adjacent rooms at the same hotel. Despite a perpetually stormy relationship, they realise that they still have feelings for each other. Its second-act love scene was nearly censored in Britain as too risqué. Coward wrote one of his most popular songs, ‘Someday I&#x27;ll Find You’, for the play.

After touring the British provinces, the play opened the new Phoenix Theatre in London in 1930, starring Coward, Gertrude Lawrence, Adrianne Allen and Laurence Olivier. A Broadway production followed in 1931, and the play has been revived at least a half-dozen times each in the West End and on Broadway. The leading roles have attracted a wide range of actors: among those who have succeeded Coward as Elyot are Robert Stephens, Richard Burton, Alan Rickman and Matthew Macfadyen, and successors to Lawrence as Amanda have included Tallulah Bankhead, Elizabeth Taylor, Joan Collins, Elaine Stritch, Maggie Smith, Penelope Keith and Lindsay Duncan. Directors of new productions have included John Gielgud, Howard Davies and Richard Eyre. The play was made into a 1931 film and has been adapted several times for television and radio.

==Background==
Coward was in the middle of an extensive Asian tour when he contracted influenza in Shanghai. He spent the better part of his two-week convalescence sketching out the play and then completed the actual writing of the piece in only four days. He immediately cabled Gertrude Lawrence in New York to ask her to keep autumn 1930 free to appear in the play. After spending a few more weeks revising it, he typed the final draft in The Cathay Hotel in Shanghai and sent copies to Lawrence and his producer and manager, John C. Wilson, with instructions to cable him with their reactions.

Coward received no fewer than 30 telegrams from Lawrence about the play. She first said that she had read the play and there was &quot;nothing wrong with it that can&#x27;t be fixed.&quot; Coward &quot;wired back curtly that the only thing that was going to be fixed was her performance.&quot; Lawrence was indecisive about what to do about her previous commitment to André Charlot. Coward finally responded that he planned to cast the play with another actress. By the time he returned to London, he found Lawrence not only had cleared her schedule but was staying at Edward Molyneux&#x27;s villa in Cap-d&#x27;Ail in southeastern France learning her lines. Coward joined her, and the two began rehearsing the scenes they shared. 

At the end of July they returned to London where Coward began to direct the production. Coward played the part of Elyot Chase himself, Adrianne Allen was his bride Sibyl, Lawrence played Amanda Prynne, and Laurence Olivier was her new husband Victor. Coward wrote Sibyl and Victor as minor characters, &quot;extra puppets, lightly wooden ninepins, only to be repeatedly knocked down and stood up again.&quot; He later insisted, however, that they must be credible new spouses for the lead characters: &quot;We&#x27;ve got to have two people as attractive as Larry and Adrianne were in the first place, &quot;if&quot; we can find them.&quot;

Rehearsals were still underway when the Lord Chamberlain took exception to the second act&#x27;s love scene, labelling it too risqué in light of the fact the characters were divorced and married to others. Coward went to St. James&#x27;s Palace to plead his case by acting out the play himself and assuring the censor that with artful direction the scene would be presented in a dignified and unobjectionable manner. Coward repeats one of his signature theatrical devices at the end of the play, where the main characters tiptoe out as the curtain falls – a device that he also used in &quot;Present Laughter&quot;, &quot;Hay Fever&quot; and &quot;Blithe Spirit.&quot;

The play contains one of Coward&#x27;s most popular songs, &quot;Some Day I&#x27;ll Find You&quot;. The Noël Coward Society&#x27;s website, drawing on performing statistics from the publishers and the Performing Rights Society, ranks it among Coward&#x27;s ten most performed songs.

==Synopsis==
;Act 1
Following a brief courtship, Elyot and Sibyl are honeymooning at a hotel in Deauville, France, although her curiosity about his first marriage is not helping his romantic mood. In the adjoining suite Amanda and Victor are starting their new life together, although he cannot stop thinking of the cruelty Amanda&#x27;s ex-husband displayed towards her. Elyot and Amanda, following a volatile three-year-long marriage, have been divorced for five years, but they now discover that they are sharing a terrace while on their honeymoons with their new and younger spouses. Elyot and Amanda separately beg their new spouses to leave the hotel with them immediately, but both new spouses refuse to cooperate and each storms off to dine alone. Realising they still love each other and regretting having divorced, Elyot and Amanda abandon their spouses and run off to Amanda&#x27;s flat in Paris.

;Act 2

After dinner at the Paris flat several days later, Elyot and Amanda use their code word &quot;Solomon Isaacs&quot;, soon abbreviated to &quot;Sollocks&quot;, to stop their arguments from getting out of hand. They kiss passionately, but the harmony cannot last: whilst Elyot and Amanda cannot live without each other, neither can they live with each other. They argue violently and try to outwit each other, just as they had done during their stormy marriage. Their ongoing argument escalates to a point of fury, as Amanda breaks a record over Elyot&#x27;s head and he retaliates by slapping her face. They seem to be trapped in a repeating cycle of love and hate as their private passions and jealousies consume them. At the height of their biggest fight, Sibyl and Victor walk in.

;Act 3
The next morning Amanda tries to sneak away early but is surprised to find Sibyl and Victor there. As they talk, Elyot comes in, and he and Amanda start bickering again. It has been decided that neither of the new spouses will grant a divorce for a year, to give Amanda and Elyot time to confirm if this is really what they want. As tempers rise, Sibyl and Victor begin to bicker with each other, defending their respective spouses. Amanda and Elyot realise that Sibyl and Victor are as suited to each other as they are, forgive each another and sneak out, leaving the younger two together. As Elyot and Amanda tiptoe out, Victor and Sibyl have reached the point of mutual violence.

==Productions==

===Original productions===

Produced by C. B. Cochran, the play premiered on 18 August 1930, at the King&#x27;s Theatre in Edinburgh, directed by Coward and starring Coward as Elyot, Gertrude Lawrence as Amanda, Laurence Olivier as Victor and Adrianne Allen as Sibyl. Sets and costumes were designed by Gladys Calthrop. After successfully touring Liverpool, Birmingham, Manchester and Southsea for five weeks, the production opened the new Phoenix Theatre in London on 24 September 1930. A week after the play opened, Heinemann published the text; a week later, HMV issued recordings of scenes from the play performed by Coward and Lawrence. Coward disliked appearing in long runs, and the London run was therefore a limited three-month season. It sold out within a week and was still playing to packed houses when, despite &quot;the gratifying knowledge that we could have run on for another six [months],&quot; it ended on 20 December 1930.

The first Broadway production opened at the Times Square Theatre on 27 January 1931 with Coward, Lawrence and Olivier reprising their roles and Jill Esmond, who had married Olivier a few months earlier, as Sibyl. Walter Winchell described the production as &quot;something to go quite silly over.&quot; The New York critics were enthusiastic about the play and Coward&#x27;s performance. A few weeks before Coward and Lawrence were scheduled to be replaced by Otto Kruger and Madge Kennedy, Lawrence collapsed with a combined attack of laryngitis and nervous exhaustion. Coward appeared at five performances with her understudy, and then closed the production for two weeks to allow Lawrence to recuperate. She returned, and the two continued in their roles until 9 May 1931. The production ran a total of 256 performances.

===Major revivals (1940s to 1970s)===

The first West End revival was at the Apollo Theatre in 1944 starring John Clements and Kay Hammond. Googie Withers took over as Amanda during the run.

Over the years, the play has been revived on Broadway six times. The first of these, in 1948, starred Tallulah Bankhead as Amanda and Donald Cook as Elyot, with Barbara Baxley as Sibyl and William Langford as Victor, in a production directed by Martin Manulis at the Plymouth Theatre, where it ran for 248 performances. The production toured all but three states of the U.S., and grossed more than $1.5 million. Coward went to see the production &quot;with my heart in my boots and was very pleasantly surprised ... her (Bankhead&#x27;s) vitality was amazing, and, strange to say, she played the love scene quite beautifully.&quot;

In 1963, at the start of what Coward called &quot;Dad&#x27;s Renaissance&quot;, a London revival directed by James Roose-Evans at the Hampstead Theatre Club heralded Coward&#x27;s return to critical favour. The success of the production, with Edward de Souza as Elyot and Rosemary Martin as Amanda, led to its transfer to the Duke of York&#x27;s Theatre. The West End producer wanted to cast established stars in the transfer, but Coward insisted that the young Hampstead cast should be retained. It ran in the West End for 212 performances. A May 1968 Off-Broadway production directed by Charles Nelson Reilly starred Elaine Stritch as Amanda, and ran for nine performances at the Theatre de Lys. A 1969 production, directed by Stephen Porter and starring Brian Bedford as Elyot and Tammy Grimes as Amanda (winning a Tony Award for her performance), with David Glover as Victor and Suzanne Grossman as Sibyl, opened at Broadway&#x27;s Billy Rose Theatre and then moved to the Broadhurst Theatre to complete its run of 198 performances. The last major revival during Coward&#x27;s lifetime was at London&#x27;s Queen&#x27;s Theatre in 1972. It was directed by John Gielgud and starred Maggie Smith and Robert Stephens. During the run of the production, John Standing took over as Elyot, and Jill Bennett was a replacement as Amanda. Gielgud directed a 1975 Broadway transfer of his production, starring Maggie Smith and John Standing at the 46th Street Theatre, where it ran for 92 performances. In 1978, Smith reprised her role (alongside Brian Bedford) in a Stratford Festival production of the play.

===Major revivals (1980s to present)===

In 1980, a production from the Greenwich Theatre transferred to the Duchess Theatre in the West End. It starred Michael Jayston and Maria Aitken, and it was directed by Alan Strachan. Elizabeth Taylor as Amanda and Richard Burton as Elyot were the headliners in a highly anticipated 1983 Broadway production directed by Milton Katselas, which opened at the Lunt-Fontanne Theatre in May 1983 following a pre-Broadway run at the Shubert Theatre in Boston in April 1983. It co-starred John Cullum as Victor and Kathryn Walker as Sibyl and ran for 63 performances. After closing on Broadway, this production toured to the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in August and September 1983, the Shubert Theatre, Chicago in September, and the Wilshire Theatre, Los Angeles in October 1983.

In 1990, a revival at London&#x27;s Aldwych Theatre, starring Keith Baxter and Joan Collins, directed by Tim Luscombe, was not well received, although Sara Crowe won an Olivier Award, Actress in a Supporting Role, as Sibyl. Arvin Brown directed Collins as Amanda and Simon Jones as Elyot in a 1992 Broadway production that closed after only 11 previews and 37 performances at the Broadhurst Theatre. The last West End production of the 20th century was at the National Theatre, running from May to September 1999, with Anton Lesser as Elyot and Juliet Stevenson as Amanda, directed by Philip Franks.

A 2001 London revival emphasised the harshness and darker side of the play; it starred Alan Rickman and Lindsay Duncan, directed by Howard Davies at the Albery Theatre (subsequently renamed the Noël Coward Theatre). Duncan won the Olivier Award for her performance, Tim Hatley won for his set designs, and Jenny Beavan won for costumes. A Broadway transfer of Davies&#x27;s West End production, starring Rickman and Duncan, ran for 127 performances at the Richard Rodgers Theatre in 2002. It won the Tony Award for Best Revival, while Duncan won for Leading Actress and Hatley won for sets. In 2009 at its new home, the Hampstead Theatre presented a revival directed by Lucy Bailey, with Jasper Britton as Elyot and Claire Price as Amanda.

A 2010 revival at the Vaudeville Theatre in London was directed by Richard Eyre and starred Matthew Macfadyen as Elyot and Kim Cattrall as Amanda. The ten-week limited season ran from February to May 2010. This production then moved to North America, starring Cattrall and Paul Gross. It had tryouts in Toronto from 16 September to 30 October 2011 and played on Broadway at the Music Box Theatre from 6 November, with an official opening on 17 November. Simon Paisley Day played Victor, and Anna Madeley played Sibyl. The production closed early, on 31 December 2011.

A production ran at the Chichester Festival Theatre from 28 September (previews from 21 September) to 27 October 2012, starring Anna Chancellor as Amanda and Toby Stephens as Elyot, with Anthony Calf as Victor and Anna-Louise Plowman as Sibyl. It was directed by Jonathan Kent. This production was reprised with the same cast at the Gielgud Theatre, in London, from 3 July (previews from 22 June) to 21 September 2013. This performance was broadcast to participating cinemas in the UK from 6 February 2014, and in the US on 11 December 2013, by CinemaLive and Digital Theatre in their West End Theatre Series.

A UK tour of &quot;Private Lives&quot; starring Patricia Hodge and Nigel Havers opened in October 2021 in Bath. This production cast all the lead roles as much older than in previous productions, which was initially met with scepticism. However, the change was received well by audiences and the tour broke several box-office records before ending in Nottingham in April 2022. This production transferred to the Ambassadors Theatre in the West End from 31 August to 25 November 2023. 

Another revival ran at the Donmar Warehouse in London from 7 April to 27 May 2023. The production starred Stephen Mangan, Rachael Stirling, Laura Carmichael and Sargon Yelda.

==Critical reception==
The original production received mixed reviews. Coward later wrote, &quot;The critics described &quot;Private Lives&quot; variously as &#x27;tenuous, thin, brittle, gossamer, iridescent, and delightfully daring&#x27;. All of which connoted in the public mind cocktails, repartee and irreverent allusions to copulation, thereby causing a gratifying number of respectable people to queue up at the box office.&quot; &quot;The Times&quot; wrote, &quot;What an entertaining play it is!&quot;, but wondered if any other performers could bring it off. Allardyce Nicoll called it &quot;amusing, no doubt, yet hardly moving farther below the surface than a paper boat in a bathtub and, like the paper boat, ever in imminent danger of becoming a shapeless, sodden mass.&quot; &quot;The Manchester Guardian&quot; commented, &quot;The audience evidently found it a good entertainment, but Mr. Coward certainly had not flattered our intelligence. The play appears to be based on the theory that anything will do provided it be neatly done.&quot; &quot;The Observer&quot; also thought that the play depended on brilliant acting and thought the characters unrealistic, though &quot;None the less, for a couple of hours they are delicious company when Mr. Coward is master of unceremonious ceremonies.&quot; The &quot;New Statesman&quot; discerned a sad side to the play in its story of a couple who can live neither with nor without each other: &quot;It is not the least of Mr. Coward&#x27;s achievements that he has ... disguised the grimness of his play and that his conception of love is really desolating.&quot;

When the text was published, &quot;The Times&quot; called it &quot;unreadable&quot;, and &quot;The Times Literary Supplement&quot; found it &quot;inexpressibly tedious&quot; in print but acknowledged that its effectiveness on stage was &quot;proved by the delight of a theatrical audience.&quot; T. E. Lawrence, however, wrote, &quot;The play reads astonishingly well ... superb prose.&quot; The editor of &quot;The Gramophone&quot; greeted Coward and Lawrence&#x27;s 1930 recording of scenes from the play as a success and added, &quot;I wish that Noel Coward would find time to write a short play for the gramophone, for neither of these extracts has enough completeness to bear indefinite repetition.&quot;

A famous scene has Amanda and Elyot discuss Elyot&#x27;s voyage to Asia, with questions on &quot;how China was&quot; (&quot;Very big&quot;) and &quot;how was the Taj Mahal?&quot; (&quot;Unbelievable, a sort of dream&quot;). 

==Literary analysis==
&quot;Private Lives&quot; has been the subject of literary analysis under a range of literary theories. Coward expressed a dim view of such analyses: &quot;Many years ago an earnest young man wrote a book about my plays. It was very intelligent and absolute rubbish.&quot; In a 2005 article, Penny Farfan analyses the play from the point of view of queer theory, arguing that &quot;the subversiveness of [Coward&#x27;s] sexual identity is reflected in his work,&quot; and that &quot;Private Lives&quot; questions &quot;the conventional gender norms on which compulsory heterosexuality depends.&quot; Positing that the leading characters&#x27; portrayal as equals is evidence in support of this theory, Farfan instances the famous image (shown above) of Coward and Lawrence as Elyot and Amanda smoking and &quot;posing as mirror opposites&quot;. Coward himself pronounced the play &quot;psychologically unstable&quot;, and John Lahr in a 1982 study of Coward&#x27;s plays writes, &quot;Elyot and Amanda&#x27;s outrageousness is used to propound the aesthetics of high camp – an essentially homosexual view of the world that justifies detachment. However, in a 1992 article on &quot;Coward and the Politics of Homosexual Representation&quot;, Alan Sinfield, examining gay aspects of Coward&#x27;s major plays, mentions &quot;Private Lives&quot; only in passing. The critic Michael Billington writes of the piece, &quot;It is not a closet gay play but a classic about the mysterious charm of .&quot;

The play has also been analysed as part of the theatre of the absurd. In a 1984 article, Archie J. Loss argues that nothing can ever happen in the relationship of Elyot and Amanda, because it is based on conflicting emotions: &quot;they are bound to repeat themselves, playing out their scene again and again with different words and different props but always with the same result.&quot; In a 2000 study of Coward, Jean Chothia instances surreal exchanges in the play, such as: &quot;Have you ever crossed the Sahara on a camel?&quot; &quot;Frequently. When I was a boy we used to do it all the time. My Grandmother had a wonderful seat on a camel.&quot;

==Film and broadcast versions==

Hanns Kräly and Richard Schayer wrote the screenplay for a 1931 film adaptation directed by Sidney Franklin and starring Norma Shearer as Amanda and Robert Montgomery as Elyot. Una Merkel and Reginald Denny played Sibyl and Victor. The film received mixed reviews. Coward thought it &quot;passable.&quot;

On 21 April 1939, CBS Radio aired an hour-long adaptation of the play by Orson Welles for &quot;The Campbell Playhouse&quot;. Guest star Gertrude Lawrence reprised her stage role as Amanda, and Welles played Elyot. Naomi Campbell and Robert Speaight played Sibyl and Victor.

On British television, Peter Gray and Maxine Audley starred in a 1959 presentation, and Alec McCowen and Penelope Keith took the leads in a BBC production in 1976. BBC Radio 4 broadcast a radio adaptation starring Paul Scofield and Patricia Routledge on 20 December 1975.

In the early 1980s, Peter Bogdanovich was asked to do a film adaptation of Coward&#x27;s &quot;Private Lives&quot; with Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton, which was set to be shot in the Rivera until they decided just to film it on stage. Prior to this, around 1974, there had been talk of Bogdanovich staging it as a revival on Broadway, with the participation of Audrey Hepburn. Later on, in 1990, Bogdanovich wrote a second draft adaptation of the play, which he had hoped to make with Hepburn starring. However, Bogdanovich credits the film&#x27;s demise to Billy Wilder, who didn&#x27;t like him: &quot;The executives asked [Wilder] what he thought of the idea. He said, &#x27;Bad idea.&#x27; That was the end of that.&quot;

In January 2010, BBC Radio 4 broadcast another adaptation of the play directed by Sally Avens, starring Helena Bonham Carter as Amanda and Bill Nighy as Elyot.

==Awards==
When &quot;Private Lives&quot; premiered, the various awards now given for achievement in musical theatre, such as the Olivier Awards and Tony Awards, had not yet been created, and therefore the original productions of the play received no such awards. The first Broadway production of &quot;Private Lives&quot; to receive major theatre awards was the 1969 production, for which Tammy Grimes won both the Tony Award for Leading Actress in a Play and the Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Actress during the 1970 awards season. Brian Bedford won the Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Actor. Sara Crowe won an Olivier Award for her performance as Sibyl in 1991. For her performance as Amanda in the 1975 production, Maggie Smith was nominated for both the Tony and the Drama Desk Awards.

The 2001 London production won three Olivier Awards out of seven nominations, for Lindsay Duncan as Amanda and the set designs by Tim Hatley and costumes by Jenny Beavan. On Broadway in 2002, the same production won three Tonys out of five nominations, including Best Revival, Best Actress (Duncan) and Best Scenic Design (Hatley). It also won the corresponding three Drama Desk awards, out of seven nominations.

<text>Lynsey de Paul (born Lyndsey Monckton Rubin; 11 June 1948 – 1 October 2014) was an English singer-songwriter and record producer. After initially writing hits for others, she had her own chart hits in the UK and Europe in the 1970s, starting with UK top 10 single &quot;Sugar Me&quot;, and became the first British female artist to achieve a number one with a self-written song (in 1972 in Belgium, Spain and the Netherlands). She represented the UK in the 1977 Eurovision Song Contest, finishing in second place and scoring another chart-topping hit in Switzerland, and had a successful career as a songwriter, record producer, actress and television celebrity.

==Early life==
Lyndsey Monckton Rubin was born to Meta (née de Groot) and Herbert Rubin, a property developer. They were a Jewish family with a Dutch, Austrian and German background, and had one other child, John (b. 1944). She studied classical music with a tutor from the Royal Academy of Music. She attended South Hampstead High School followed by Hornsey College of Art, now part of Middlesex University. De Paul later claimed that she and her brother suffered physical abuse at the hands of their father. In one incident as a student aged 19, de Paul was concussed for two days following a fight with her violent father, prompting her to leave her comfortable family home for a two roomed flat above an Indian restaurant near her college.

==Career==
===Early songwriting===
Three of de Paul&#x27;s earliest songs were co-written with Don Gould (formerly a member of the Applejacks) and recorded by &quot;Oliver!&quot; performer Jack Wild: &quot;Takin&#x27; It Easy&quot; and &quot;Bring Yourself Back To Me&quot; from the album &quot;Everything&#x27;s Coming Up Roses&quot;, which was released in 1971. &quot;Bring Yourself Back To Me&quot; was also the B-side to Wild&#x27;s 1971 US single &quot;(Holy Moses!) Everything&#x27;s Coming Up Roses&quot;. Another song co-penned by her, this time with Edward Adamberry, called &quot;E.O.I.O.&quot;, was recorded by Wild as a track on his 1972 album &quot;A Beautiful World&quot;, and also released as a single by the Beads as well as an album track, &quot;Io...Aio (EEO-EIO)&quot; by the Italian group Domodossola (band) on their album &quot;D... Come Domodossola&quot;.

After these initial successes, she was contracted to ATV-Kirshner music publishing (now Sony Music Publishing) by Eddie Levy when she was 18 years old. ATV Music (now Sony Music Publishing) was located above the Peter Robinson&#x27;s store on Oxford Street, where she joined a group of professional songwriters that included Barry Blue (at that time known as Barry Green) and Ron Roker (later to become Barry&#x27;s brother-in-law), resulting in revenues from songs recorded by other artists. One of their earliest songs (and the only song where all three collaborated) was &quot;Sugarloaf Hill&quot;, recorded by the reggae artist, Del Davis and finally released on the &quot;Trojan Carnival Box Set&quot; CD in 2003 as part of the Trojan Box Set series.

Her first major breakthrough came early in 1972 as the co-writer (with Ron Roker) of the Fortunes&#x27; top 10 UK hit &quot;Storm in a Teacup&quot;. De Paul performed the song the same year on the BBC&#x27;s &quot;The Two Ronnies&quot;. Canadian singer Ginette Reno recorded a French language version of the song (&quot;Dans la vie, tout s&#x27;arrange&quot;) which reached No. 2 on the French-Canadian top 10. Around this time, she also had chart success in Malaysia and the Netherlands as the writer of &quot;On the Ride (You Do It Once, You Do It Twice)&quot;, a top 30 hit by the Continental Uptight Band, and also &quot;When You&#x27;ve Gotta Go&quot;, an Australian chart hit recorded and released by Solomon King. All three songs credited her as &#x27;L. Rubin&#x27;. Other notable songs from this period included &quot;Papa Do&quot;, which was released by Barry Green as a single, and made the lower reaches of the French singles chart, as well as &quot;Crossword Puzzle&quot;, also co-penned with Barry Green and which led to an appearance on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; and &quot;Saturday Variety&quot; for the Irish singer Dana. &quot;Crossword Puzzle&quot; peaked at No. 2 on the Bangkok singles chart. De Paul&#x27;s own versions of both of these two songs would later be found as tracks on her debut album, &quot;Surprise&quot;. &quot;Boomerang&quot;, the B-side to &quot;Papa Do&quot; and another de Paul/Blue collaboration was released as a single in the UK by the Young Generation, a group of dancers and singers recruited by Dougie Squires and they performed it on their BBC prime time TV show while a French version was also released by Jane and Julie. Geno Washington &amp; the Ram Jam Band recorded their version of &quot;Boomerang&quot; in 1972, which appeared on their 1998 compilation album and their 2016 album, &quot;Geno!&quot;. In an interview with &quot;Cashbox&quot; in early 1972, Don Kirshner said &quot;We are looking for another Carole King. We think we found her in Lynsey Rubin.&quot;

===Singer-songwriter: Early to mid-1970s===
Although she had recorded demo versions of her songs, de Paul was initially a reluctant performer. She wrote the song &quot;Sugar Me&quot; for Peter Noone, but her boyfriend at the time, Dudley Moore, suggested that she take a demo version to Gordon Mills, who urged her to record it herself and release it on his MAM record label. Explaining her change of name from Rubin, she said: &quot;There had just been the massacre of Jewish athletes at the Munich Olympics and I was told that it would be better not to have an obviously Jewish name. For my stage name I took De from my mother&#x27;s maiden name, De Groot, and my father&#x27;s middle name was Paul&quot;. Released as a single on the MAM Records label, &quot;Sugar Me&quot; rapidly reached the top 10 of the UK Singles Chart, as well as the top of the singles charts in the Netherlands, Spain and Belgium. The arrangement featured a distinctive piano counter-melody motif as well as Hammond organ backing, a violin solo and a distinctive whip-crack.

This was the start of de Paul&#x27;s becoming a regular British chart and TV fixture over the next five years. Her follow-up single to &quot;Sugar Me&quot; was &quot;Getting a Drag&quot;, which reached the UK top 20, as well as being a hit on the official German singles chart. She appeared on the first episode of the German music show &quot;Musikladen&quot; on 13 December 1972, where she performed her two German hit singles &quot;Sugar Me&quot; and &quot;Getting a Drag&quot;, as well as a few weeks later performing &quot;Doctor, Doctor&quot;, which would appear on her debut album a few months later. She was listed as the best female artist of 1972 by &quot;Record Mirror&quot;, female performer of the year by Radio Luxembourg as well as the third best female singer in the 1973 &quot;New Musical Express&quot; (NME) music poll.

In March 1973, her first album, &quot;Surprise&quot;, was released on the MAM label. As well as writing or co-writing all of the songs on &quot;Surprise&quot;, de Paul was also the producer for all of the tracks. In his 2015 autobiography, label mate Tom Jones wrote: &quot;We had Lynsey de Paul, a big star, though she fell out with Gordon (Mills) for wanting to produce her own records&quot;. Later that year, after &quot;All Night&quot;, her third single, co-written with Ron Roker and released on the MAM label, failed to chart in the UK, de Paul returned to the UK top 20 with &quot;Won&#x27;t Somebody Dance with Me&quot;, which was also a hit in Ireland and the Netherlands and covered in the US. According to an interview with Michael Robson, featured in the liner notes to &quot;Sugar and Beyond&quot;, de Paul had to fight hard to get this single released - indeed she would have preferred it in place of &quot;All Night&quot; and also to keep the long closing instrumental part of the song. She was vindicated since it was a chart hit and she was presented with an Ivor Novello Award for the song, the first woman to receive the award. The BBC Radio 1 disc jockey Ed Stewart spoke the words &quot;May I have the pleasure of this dance&quot; near the end of the record (he often played the record on his &quot;Junior Choice&quot; programme on Saturday mornings) although Tony Blackburn and Dave Lee Travis spoke these words when she appeared on BBC Television&#x27;s &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;. De Paul performed the song on the 500th edition special on 4 October 1973, which was the date of the release of the single. The flip side of &quot;Won&#x27;t Somebody Dance with Me&quot; was &quot;So Good to You&quot;, a song covered by Lenny Zakatek on the B-side of his single &quot;I Gotcha Now&quot;. &quot;I Gotcha Now&quot; was also written by de Paul, originally for Slade. In Japan, &quot;So Good to You&quot; was released as the A-side with &quot;Won&#x27;t Somebody Dance with Me&quot; being relegated to the B-side. Another song co-written by de Paul, &quot;Today Gluggo, Tomorrow the World&quot;, was the B-side of &quot;Don&#x27;t You Let It Bring You Down&quot; by the Spencer Davis Group, as well as an album track on their 1973 &quot;Gluggo&quot;.

De Paul recorded the female lyric to Mott the Hoople&#x27;s album track version of &quot;Roll Away the Stone&quot;, but the female trio Thunderthighs appeared on the hit single version of the song. However, the de Paul album version was released as a single in Japan, with the single being credited to &quot;Mott The Hoople &amp; Lynsey de Paul&quot;. She was also credited for backing vocals on a second track on the album &quot;The Hoople&quot; called &quot;Alice&quot;. In 1973, when Mick Ralphs left Mott the Hoople, his replacement Luther Grosvenor was contractually obliged to change his name – de Paul suggested Ariel Bender. She also provided backing vocals (credited as &quot;Loony&quot;) on &quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Winter (Loony&#x27;s Tune) (Sorry, the Word Spring Wouldn&#x27;t Fit)&quot; and thus helped Wizzard (fronted by Roy Wood; her boyfriend at the time) reach the UK top 10 in 1974. In February of that year, de Paul was voted top female singer in the UK music weekly Disc Readers Awards Poll, while David Bowie was voted top male singer and Slade the top group. De Paul was also voted female singer of 1974 by Israeli radio station Galei Zahal. 

After appointing Don Arden her new manager at the end of 1973, in part because her former manager Harold Davison fell ill earlier that year, de Paul released &quot;Ooh I Do&quot; in May 1974, which became a chart hit in the UK, Belgium, Netherlands, Brazil and Japan. The song&#x27;s co-writer, Barry Blue, also recorded a version of the song as an album track with different lyrics for the verses. De Paul also wrote her first TV theme tune (&quot;Pilger theme&quot;) for &quot;Pilger&quot; where journalist, John Pilger, examined various political issues at the time (1974-1977) in a series of 25 minute documentaries. Another theme song, this time co-written with Barry Blue, was recorded and released as a single by the UK group Rain, featuring Stephanie De Sykes as the vocalist. The song &quot;Golden Day&quot;, released as a single on 12 July 1974, was used as the theme for the TV game show &quot;The Golden Shot&quot;.

A second Ivor Novello Award followed a year later for &quot;No, Honestly&quot;, which was also the theme tune to the hit ITV comedy &quot;No, Honestly&quot;, and provided her with another UK top 10 hit. The B-side to this single was de Paul&#x27;s version of &quot;Central Park Arrest&quot;, the song she had written for Thunderthighs and which had provided them with a top 30 UK hit single a few months earlier. The TV series &quot;No, Honestly&quot; was followed by &quot;Yes, Honestly&quot;, and although Georgie Fame wrote and performed the theme tune to the first series of &quot;Yes Honestly&quot;, an instrumental version of de Paul&#x27;s &quot;No, Honestly&quot; was chosen as the theme for the second series. &quot;No Honestly&quot; was the first release on the newly formed Jet Records, established by Don Arden. She also wrote the second single that was released on the label, a song called &quot;My One and Only&quot; by UK female singing trio Bones. Her second album, &quot;Taste Me... Don&#x27;t Waste Me&quot;, was the first album release on Jet Records and was her favourite of all her albums. De Paul continued to release singles through the mid-1970s, including the UK hit &quot;My Man and Me&quot;, which she performed an acoustic version of on &quot;The Old Grey Whistle Test&quot;, along with &quot;Rhythm and Blue Jean Baby&quot;, &quot;Love Bomb&quot;, &quot;Hug and Squeeze Me&quot; and &quot;If I Don&#x27;t Get You the Next One Will&quot;.
De Paul also continued to write songs for a wide range of recording artists. In a five-year period (1972–77), she wrote a total of fourteen UK Singles Chart hits, most notably the Carl Allen award-winning song &quot;Dancin&#x27; (on a Saturday Night)&quot; which was a hit for co-writer Barry Blue, as well as Flash Cadillac and the Canadian group Bond. More hit singles co-written with Blue and performed by him followed, including &quot;School Love&quot;, &quot;Miss Hit and Run&quot; and &quot;Hot Shot&quot; They finally released a duet at the end of 1975, the festive &quot;Happy Christmas to you from me&quot;, which was co-written by the duo. The song received favourable reviews and continues to receive plays over the years. Other notable songs co-written by de Paul and Blue include &quot;Tip of My Tongue&quot; which was a radio hit and UK chart bubbler for the British group Brotherly Love as well as female vocal trio Ellie (a.k.a. the Hope Sisters who would later become Liquid Gold) and &quot;House of Cards&quot; recorded by artists including John Christie, Australian artist Rob Guest and the DJ Tony Blackburn. De Paul&#x27;s songs have reached the charts in many territories, including the US, Japan, Germany, the Netherlands, France, Switzerland, Belgium, Austria, Sweden, Norway, Ireland, Israel, Canada and Australia. She also performed producing and arranging duties on many of these recordings.

Her third album, &quot;Love Bomb&quot;, was released on Jet Records in 1975. Whereas the title track was released as a single in most territories, in the US and Japan the track &quot;Sugar Shuffle&quot; was released as a single. Later, US soul singer Cheryl Lynn would release her version of &quot;Love Bomb&quot; on her 1979 album &quot;In Love&quot; and Japanese singer Asami Kobayashi released a cover version of &quot;Sugar Shuffle&quot; on her 1984 album &quot;Cryptograph&quot;. The cover sleeve for the &quot;Love Bomb&quot; album was photographed by Brian Aris but she was also photographed that year by Terry O&#x27;Neill. De Paul was voted best female singer in a poll by the readers of the weekly music newspaper &quot;Record Mirror &amp; Disc&quot; for the third year in a row in February 1976.

In April 1976, she appeared with Sacha Distel (who had, together with Petula Clark, recorded a version of &quot;Taking It On&quot;, composed by de Paul and Ron Roker in 1973) and Marti Caine at the London Palladium. Later that year she was the recipient of the &#x27;Woman of the Year Award For Music&#x27; from the Variety Club of Great Britain. Management problems with Don Arden, however, made this a difficult time for de Paul and her third album for Jet Records, &quot;Before You Go Tonight&quot;, was shelved as the two parted ways shortly after the release of &quot;If I Don&#x27;t Get You The Next One Will&quot;, her last single of the Jet Records label. Nevertheless, that year she recorded the only cover song of her recording career, the Lennon–McCartney song &quot;Because&quot; that appeared on the soundtrack to the movie &quot;All This and World War II&quot;. The song appeared on a double album released in 1976 to tie in with the film. The album charted in the US, the UK New Zealand and the Netherlands, and was re-released as &quot;The Beatles and World War II&quot; on CD in July 2016. That same year she co-wrote the song &quot;Don&#x27;t You Remember When&quot; for Dame Vera Lynn, after guesting on her show and being impressed by the length of time for which Lynn could hold a single note - the song features a long
sustained note at the end. &quot;Don&#x27;t You Remember When&quot; was released as a single on the EMI Records label in February 1976 and de Paul was also the producer as well as singing backing vocals. Another notable guest was ex-Beatle Ringo Starr, who played the tambourine. De Paul also wrote and performed the theme song for &quot;A Divorce&quot;, a series of three plays by Fanny Galleymore starring Julia Foster, Polly James and Michael Kitchen for the BBC that was also broadcast on German TV. De Paul also performed her song &quot;Funny How Things Can Change&quot; in one of the episodes. De Paul was one of the guests at the UK premiere of &quot;The Song Remains the Same&quot; by Led Zeppelin at Warner West End Cinema, London on 4 November 1976. On 22 December that year, de Paul attended a charity dinner hosted by Prince Charles, that was also attended by Elton John and Gary Glitter. De Paul and John played Christmas carols on the piano for the Prince.

===Eurovision and the late 1970s===
&quot;Rock Bottom&quot;, which she wrote with Mike Moran originally for Blue Mink, was chosen as the UK entry in the Eurovision Song Contest 1977 and released on Polydor. The duo also wrote and performed the B-side, the amusing &quot;You Shouldn&#x27;t Say That&quot;. De Paul made history by being the first female to perform her own composition at the Eurovision Song Contest. As she later explained, as well as being an honour, taking part in Eurovision was a way to circumvent the legal wrangles that were preventing her from signing to a new record label. Although it was the favourite to win, it came second in the Eurovision Song Contest and went on to become a Top 20 hit in many European countries including France, Germany, Austria and Switzerland, where it reached the top of their singles chart. It was the 15th best selling single of 1977 in Switzerland and the 32nd best selling single in Germany. The Eurovision experience resulted in a formal offer to stand as a Liberal parliamentary candidate by chief party whip John Pardoe. &quot;It started when I shot my mouth off over the strike of BBC cameramen that threatened to black out the song contest in England&quot;, she recalled. Pardoe, deputy leader of the Liberal Party, invited her to tea at the House of Commons and suggested that she run for a seat in Parliament. That year she also joined the Council of the Songwriters Guild of Great Britain, the only woman on the council at that time.

Together with Moran, de Paul subsequently wrote other songs, notably &quot;Let Your Body Go Downtown&quot; (1977) for the Martyn Ford Orchestra, a No. 38 UK chart hit that Ford and his Orchestra performed on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;; and the follow-up non-album single &quot;Going to a Disco&quot;, credited solely to Martyn Ford as well as the songs &quot;Without You&quot;, and &quot;Now and Then&quot;, which appeared on the albums &quot;Tigers and Fireflies&quot; and &quot;Just a Little Time&quot;, respectively.

Beach Boys member Bruce Johnston released his version of &quot;Won&#x27;t Somebody Dance With Me&quot; on his 1977 solo album &quot;Going Public&quot;, as did Lena Zavaroni on her 1977 album &quot;Presenting Lena Zavaroni&quot;. The song was also featured in the 1978 film &quot;The Big Sleep&quot;, a remake of the American classic featuring Robert Mitchum, Joan Collins, Edward Fox, John Mills and directed by Michael Winner. The character Mona Grant, played by Diana Quick, actually sings the song. &quot;Won&#x27;t Somebody Dance With Me&quot; was also featured in &quot;The Muppet Show&quot;, sung by Gonzo (Season Two, Episode 41 with Julie Andrews) as well as in &quot;The New Mickey Mouse Club&quot; performed by Lisa Whelchel.

De Paul released a further single &quot;You Give Me Those Feelings&quot; in August 1977. The song was also recorded by Gracie Rivera, a Filippina singer based in Hong Kong with EMI as a track on her 1978 album &quot;Gracie Ann Rivera&quot;. In 1977, de Paul also wrote and performed the theme music for the revival by London Weekend Television of the sitcom, &quot;The Rag Trade&quot; (1977), with the song &quot;The Rag Trade&quot; performed by Joan Brown. That same year she composed &quot;Hi Summer&quot;, the title of an ITV variety show, performed by Carl Wayne and released as a single produced by de Paul. In addition to songs composed by her serving as the themes of nine prime-time UK television series, de Paul&#x27;s songs have been featured in internationally released films such as &quot;The Big Sleep&quot;, &quot;The Long Good Friday&quot;, &quot;Anita and Me&quot;, &quot;Side by Side&quot;, &quot;Aces Go Places&quot;, &quot;American Swing&quot;, &quot;Northern Soul&quot;, &quot;Fraulein Phyllis&quot; and &quot;Cut Snake&quot;.

Just over a year after the release of &quot;You Give Me Those Feelings&quot;, de Paul released her next single &quot;Hollywood Romance&quot;, probably inspired by her then recent move to California; the lyric is a playful homage to some of Hollywood&#x27;s classic films. The single garnered radio play and was also covered by Lena Zavaroni on her TV show. It was a teaser and track on the 1979 album &quot;Tigers and Fireflies&quot;, which was produced by Rupert Holmes. Justin de Villeneuve was Lynsey&#x27;s manager at the time and the album was recorded at Long View Farm. A second single, &quot;Tigers and Fireflies&quot;, released in 1979 and lifted from the album, told of de Paul&#x27;s experiences with various former managers. Holmes and de Paul co-wrote the song &quot;Twas&quot;, which also appeared on &quot;Tigers and Fireflies&quot;. The album also featured a bluesy version of de Paul&#x27;s hit &quot;My Man and Me&quot;.

===Branching out in the 1980s===
After a four-year period in California in the late 1970s and early 1980s with her partner at the time, actor James Coburn, whom she met at a party thrown by Joan Collins de Paul returned to England. Although she only released one self-composed solo single, &quot;Strange Changes&quot;, in the 1980s, it made the UK disco chart, published in the music magazine &quot;Record Mirror&quot;, and resulted in prime time TV appearances in the UK and Germany. She co-wrote with Terry Britten &quot;A Little TLC&quot;, which was covered by Sam Hui as &quot;心思思&quot; with Cantonese lyrics and it was awarded an RTHK Top 10 Gold Songs Award in Hong Kong in 1986. Other versions of this song were recorded by Latino boy band Menudo, with lead vocals by Ricky Martin as a track on their 1988 album &quot;Sons of Rock&quot;; as well as Japan based Filipina soul singer Marlene as a track on her album &quot;Looking for Love&quot;; and also featured in the US children&#x27;s television programme, &quot;Kidd Video&quot;. De Paul later released her own version of the song on her website music store. Her song &quot;Brandy&quot;, which had been the B-side of the single &quot;Getting a Drag&quot; was released by Japanese singer Miki Asakura on her 1981 album &quot;Sexy Elegance&quot; with new lyrics and the title &quot;Friday Night&quot;. Whilst continuing to write songs for artists as diverse as Shirley Bassey (&quot;There&#x27;s No Place Like London&quot;), funk/soul band Heatwave, Marti Webb (both recording the song &quot;All I Am&quot;) and the Real Thing (&quot;We Got Love&quot;), de Paul also branched out into record production, acting in musicals and plays, interviewing and TV presentation and drawing cartoons. She also continued to compose TV themes, including for the BBC&#x27;s 1981 comedy series &quot;The Olympian Way&quot; and in 1988 the long-running Esther Rantzen programme &quot;Hearts of Gold&quot; which was released as a single on CBS by the artist &quot;Gold&quot; in November 1988.

De Paul was a celebrity participant in the TV show &quot;Christmas Star Games&quot;, a Thames Television production shown on ITV on 26 December 1980. In 1982, she hosted a Sunday morning radio show on Capital Radio (now Capital London) to promote new talent in the music business. The show included selected examples of the many demonstration tapes received by the station from London&#x27;s vast popular music-making population over the years. a musician from the Czech Republic, was selected as the winner of a contest on de Paul&#x27;s show with his own quirky song &quot;King Kong in Hong Kong&quot; and it was released as a single, which became a hit in his native country. It was widely played at London discos, in particular at the Empire, Leicester Square by DJ Roy Kelly.

In 1982, De Paul made her acting debut onstage in Iain Blair’s thriller &quot;Shriek!&quot; at the Churchill Theatre, Bromley and, in the following year, on television in Granada&#x27;s &quot;The Starlight Ballroom&quot;, when she played the lead female character, alongside Alvin Stardust. Her first panto appearance was as &quot;Cinderella&#x27;s Star Night&quot; where de Paul played Cinderella and Joanna Lumley playing Prince Charming as part of an all-star cast to raise funds for The Bobath Centre held at the Prince Edward Theatre, London, on 31 January 1982. The script was written by writers including Michael Frayn, Jack Rosenthal and John Cleese with the epilogue provided by Alan Ayckbourn and narrated by Ian McKellen and also featured Joanna Lumley, Nigel Havers and Helen Mirren. De Paul also appeared in Aladdin at the Shaftesbury Theatre in 1983 and Jack and the Beanstalk (Oxford Playhouse, 1989). She also appeared as the character Prudie in Pump Boys and Dinettes (Piccadilly Theatre, 1985).

In 1983, de Paul orchestrated, played, and produced two updated classical recordings for Deutsche Grammophon and released &quot;Air on a Heart String&quot; (&quot;Air on the G String&quot; composed by Bach) backed with &quot;Arrival of the Queen&quot; (&quot;The Arrival of the Queen of Sheba&quot; composed by Handel) with panflautist Horea Crishan. During this period, de Paul began composing and performing songs for children. This included writing the music for the children&#x27;s film &quot;Gabrielle and the Doodleman&quot;, in which she had a starring role as an actress. That same year, she also appeared with Carl Davis in a specially commissioned film &quot;What Price Music?&quot; for the Performing Rights Society (PRS) (now known as the PRS for Music) explaining how the PRS looks after its 15,000 members as well as almost half a million affiliated members worldwide.

De Paul also composed jingles for radio stations including Capital Radio. In 1983, she appeared at the Conservative Party conference with DJ Kenny Everett and film producer Michael Winner, where she sang a song she had composed especially for the occasion: &quot;Vote Tory, Tory, Tory/For election glory&quot;. She was the subject of the first episode of a TV series about female singers called &quot;Ladybirds&quot;, directed by Bryan Izzard. As well as being interviewed about her music and life, she played some of her most famous compositions, as well as her version of &quot;All I Am&quot; and a new song, &quot;Thunder in the Night&quot;. She also played a solo version of &quot;Arrival of the Queen of Sheba&quot; on various synthesisers/keyboards on a London roof top with a great view overlooking St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral. Some years later, her version of this song would later become the theme song for a German TV programme.

De Paul was the special guest of the day on &quot;Good Morning Britain: with Nick Owen and Anne Diamond&quot; on 17 February 1984. She also made a guest appearance on the &quot;Rod and Emu Show&quot; (aka &quot;Rod and Emu&#x27;s Saturday Special&quot;) on the 10 March 1984, where she performed her self-composed song, &quot;Thunder in the Night&quot;. On 19 November 1984, de Paul was honoured to be one of the performers at the Royal Variety Performance in the presence of Queen Elizabeth II as well as the Queen Mother and the Prince and Princess of Wales and Lady Sarah Armstrong-Jones at the Victoria Palace Theatre. The complete show was aired on BBC One.

In 1985, she was a judge on the television talent show &quot;New Faces&quot; and also on &quot;Sky Star Search&quot; as well as a regular panellist on the television shows &quot;Call My Bluff&quot;, &quot;Punchlines&quot; and &quot;Blankety Blank&quot;. She hosted television shows such as &quot;Club Vegetarian&quot;, &quot;Shopper&#x27;s Heaven&quot;, &quot;Eat Drink &amp; Be Healthy&quot;, &quot;Women of Substance&quot;, &quot;The Vinyl Frontier&quot; and 15 episodes of &quot;Living Room Legends&quot;, which featured home videos. 

In 1986, she appeared on Spanish TV as a guest on the &quot;Àngel Casas Show&quot; singing two of her 1980s compositions &quot;Suspicion&quot; and &quot;Words Don&#x27;t Mean a Thing&quot; as well as her Spanish number one hit single &quot;Sugar Me&quot;. A year later, de Paul was back on UK television singing &quot;Take Back Your Heartaches&quot; (co-written by Gerard Kenny - his version appeared on his 1995 album &quot;An Evening with Gerard Kenny Live&quot;) and &quot;Words Don&#x27;t Mean a Thing&quot;. That year, de Paul took part in two days of music and fun on 5 and 6 July at the Royal Academy of Music in aid of its international appeal

On 21 April 1989, she was a special guest and performed songs during RTÉ Television coverage of the first People in Need Trust Telethon.

===Taking Control: the 1990s===
In January 1991, de Paul (along with Midge Ure and Justin Hayward) was elected to BASCA&#x27;s decision making council. De Paul was a member of the judging panel for the UK 1992 &quot;Song For Europe&quot; entry, the only woman on the 13 member panel. That year, de Paul returned to the public spotlight in a different role in 1992 when she released a self-defence video for women called &quot;Taking Control&quot;. As well as starring in the video, both as the presenter and demonstrator of self-defence techniques, she co-wrote and was the producer for the theme song and incidental music with Ian Lynn. Baron Mackenzie of Framwellgate, former president of the Police Association, endorsed it by saying: &quot;It is a very positive contribution to crime prevention and the protection of women and I will be recommending it&quot;. She also presented a documentary about women&#x27;s self-defence, called &quot;Eve Fights Back&quot;, which won a Royal Television Society award. A book based on the programme and video written by de Paul and Clare McCormick with the title &quot;Taking Control: Basic Mental &amp; Physical Self Defence for Women&quot;, was published by Boxtree in 1993. In 2006, an updated DVD of her self-defence training programme, &quot;Taking Control: Simple Mental &amp; Physical Self Defence for Women&quot;, was released and featured on television (&quot;The Wright Stuff&quot;) and in the media. The programme showed the importance of self-defence for women, and she approached schools and universities to include the DVD in the curriculum. It was also released in Germany, (title &quot;Selbstverteidigung für Frauen: Das komplette Trainingsprogramm&quot;) dubbed in German.

That same year, music magazine &quot;Rock Compact Disc Magazine&quot;, published by Northern &amp; Shell PLC, listed the de Paul MAM 1970&#x27;s compilation album &quot;Lynsey Sings&quot; aka &quot;The World of Lynsey de Paul&quot; (comprising all of the tracks from the &quot;Surprise&quot; album plus various non-album singles and B-sides) as one of the top 50 glam rock era albums in their &quot;Wham Bam, Thank You Glam: 50 Glam Era Highlights 1972-1974&quot; listing, with a greatest hits album from co-writer and colleague Barry Blue that also included his four hit singles written with de Paul also featuring in the listing and cementing their glam credentials.

In 1994, she released her first album in 15 years entitled &quot;Just a Little Time&quot;. It featured newly recorded and released songs, notably &quot;Words Don&#x27;t Mean a Thing&quot; and &quot;We Got Love&quot;, as well as reworked and updated versions of many of her classic hits, plus two club mixes of &quot;Sugar Me&quot; and &quot;Getting a Drag&quot;. This was a CD-only release on the Music DeLuxe label that has since been re-issued on other labels such as ARC Records and Tring International. That year, she also released a new single &quot;There&#x27;s No Place Like London&quot;, her version of the song she had written for Shirley Bassey, featuring an all-star cast that included Frankie Vaughan, Patti Boulaye, Gareth Hunt, Kenny Lynch, Rula Lenska, Gwen Taylor, Lionel Blair, Lorraine Chase, Pam St. Clement, Harry Fowler, Polly James, Larry Adler, Rose Marie, Victor Spinetti, Gorden Kaye and the St Joan of Arc School Choir and credited to Lynsey &amp; Friends. The song was the winning record for the LBC London Parade and it went on sale to raise money for the Variety Club. In an LBC radio programme, de Paul discussed how it came about and how it got its title. Lorraine Chase who sang on the track, also discussed her role. Elizabeth Cohen of Nonsuch High School and David Burditch of St Joan of Arc School in Rickmanshaw, described how their schools became involved in the recording. Lionel Blair urged everyone to join the parade to promote London and Ian Fenn provided a report from Stock Aitken Waterman&#x27;s Hit Factory, where the record was produced.

One year later, de Paul also co-wrote with Ian Lynn an album &quot;How Do You Do - I&#x27;m Marcus&quot;, for the opening of Eurotunnel, which was released on CD in 1995. It was a children&#x27;s album that told the story of Marcus the Mole and various other characters, as featured in the book by Cheryl Wilson. De Paul also performed some of the tracks on the album credited as the character Michelle (&quot;He Can&#x27;t Dance&quot;) and also Moleye (&quot;Old Mole and Grandma&quot;). Other artists appearing on the album included Ron Moody (who sang &quot;A Little Learning&quot; as Prof. Maurice Molehead), Kate Robbins, Ian Lynn, Tony Jackson (bass player) and Jon Glover. It came with an accompanying song colouring book for Eurotunnel&#x27;s mascot, entitled &quot;Marcus The Mole&quot;,

De Paul also signed up with Leosong in 1995, along with Barry Mason, Lonnie Donegan and Debbie Wiseman. Gerard Kenny released his version of &quot;Take Back Your Heartache&quot;, a song that he co-wrote with de Paul on his 1995 album, &quot;An Evening with...&quot;, as well as his &quot;Old Friends&quot; album and that de Paul performed as &quot;Take Back Your Heartaches&quot; on TV in the UK. In 1996, her song &quot;Martian Man&quot; was featured on a CD single &quot;The Milkman&quot; by the Julianne Regan fronted group Mice. Regan is a long-time fan of de Paul and sought her approval to record the song, albeit in a very different style to the original more ethereal version. The single made it to the lower reaches of the UK Singles Chart. It was also a track on the album &quot;New &amp; Improved&quot; by Mice. In 1998, an album entitled &quot;Kucinta&quot; by the Indonesian singer Yana Julio, featured a cover version of the de Paul/Sheridan song &quot;All I Am&quot;.

De Paul conceived and presented the TV series &quot;Women of Substance&quot; in 1998. Guests included Judy Finnigan, Diana Moran, Claudia Winkleman, and Heather Mills. In 1999, de Paul was featured on the cover of &quot;Saga Magazine&quot;, published by Saga plc, together with a lengthy interview where she discussed her early years, how she became a successful songwriter and her later four-year relationship with James Coburn and living with him in Los Angeles. De Paul stated for the first time that during this period she was in talks with Dolly Parton&#x27;s management, but that they mysteriously broke off. She also spoke at length about her belief in the need for self-defence for women, giving the background to how she conceived the &quot;Eve Fights Back&quot; (aka &quot;Eve Strikes Back&quot;) TV documentary and the &quot;Taking Control&quot; video. That year she was also one of the judges for the Sony Radio Awards.

===2000s===
In 2000, de Paul was present for the launch of the charity &quot;Support for Africa 2000&quot;, with the aim to help those suffering from the effects of HIV/AIDS or malaria at a reception at the Nigerian Embassy in London, hosted by HE Prince Bola Ajibola, the Nigerian High Commissioner to the UK. Among the guests were Princess Katarina of Yugoslavia; tenor Russell Watson, who sang a duet with the charity&#x27;s president Patti Boulaye; and Errol Brown. De Paul was a long-term supporter of this charity and appeared at a number of their events and concerts. She was a guest at the &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot; 30th anniversary event in 2002. In 2002, the de Paul/Blue song &quot;Dancin&#x27; (on a Saturday Night)&quot; was featured in the film &quot;Anita and Me&quot; as well as on the soundtrack album and one year later it was also featured in the cult TV program &quot;Monkey Dust&quot;.

De Paul, together with friend and Childline founder Esther Rantzen was one of the comperes and appeared with a host of stars and celebrities at the &quot;Children Will Listen: A 75th Birthday Tribute to Stephen Sondheim&quot; event in aid of Childline held on Sunday 23 October 2005.

Her longstanding contribution to the music industry was recognised in 2005 when de Paul received a Gold Badge Award from BASCA (now the Ivors Academy). This was followed by her becoming a director on the board of the Performing Rights Society (PRS) on 30 June 2006 where she proved to be a long serving and active member. The PRS was renamed PRS for Music and in 2009 de Paul was re-elected for a second three-year term. She was held in high regard by her peers at PRS, where she also served as Trustee of the Members Benevolent Fund.

Since she had trained as an artist at the Hornsey College of Art and was a talented cartoonist (as evidenced from the gatefold album sleeve of her debut album, &quot;Surprise&quot; and other album sleeves she designed), she was employed as the resident cartoonist for &quot;OK!&quot; in its first year of weekly distribution in 2006, with her humorous pocket-cartoon series entitled &quot;Light Entertainment&quot;. She also provided cartoons for the women&#x27;s magazine &quot;Chic&quot; with another series of pocket-cartoons entitled &quot;Woman to Woman&quot;.

A 2006 episode of the BBC Radio 2 series &quot;Sold on Song&quot;, included Gamble and Huff, who talked about how they wrote some of their classic songs. Some were performed with Sheila Ferguson singing, and the program featured de Paul as well as Kim Appleby, Guy Fletcher, Steve Levine and David Arnold.

In 2007, de Paul briefly returned to acting and played the glamorous character &#x27;Sheila Larsen&#x27; in the first episode of &quot;Kingdom&quot;, the Stephen Fry drama series. Peter Kingdom managed to clear up a feud between Sheila Larsen&#x27;s two sons that starts after she dies suddenly and whose money apparently disappeared. She also appeared on the BBC program &quot;Breakfast&quot; on 4 October 2007 talking about the loss of her friend and colleague Ronnie Hazlehurst, specifically the TV themes he penned and his conducting of the orchestra with rolled up umbrella for de Paul and Moran at the 1977 Eurovision Song Contest, where he was dressed in a pin-striped suit and a bowler hat. On 10 April 2008, de Paul participated in a celebrity version of the Channel 4 show &quot;Come Dine with Me&quot; along with Tamara Beckwith, MC Harvey and Jonathan Ansell. De Paul, who was the only vegetarian among the group, came in last place. She was also the subject of a celebrity version of &quot;Cash in the Attic&quot; in March 2009 where she became a temporary auctioneer.

In 2008, a digital-only album of songs by members of the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers, and Authors (BASCA - now The Ivors Academy) entitled &quot;Songs From The British Academy, Vol. 1&quot; featured de Paul singing her song &quot;Words Don&#x27;t Mean a Thing&quot;, as well as other classic British artists such as Boy George, Peter Gabriel, KT Tunstall, Brian May, The Pretenders, Robin Gibb and Cliff Richard.

She wrote the foreword for the 2009 book &quot;Medium Rare&quot; about the spiritual medium Liam Scott who is one of the UK&#x27;s leading stage psychics. She was one of the interviewees in an article &quot;60 years old: happy birthday to the single&quot; where celebrities and media personalities were asked to name a single that was important to them. De Paul chose &quot;Love Came to Me&quot; by Dion and the Belmonts (1962) and said &quot;It was a really good pop record of its time. Certain songs have emotional associations in one&#x27;s life. This was almost a coming of age.&quot;

In 2011, de Paul had her own programme on Sky, entitled &quot;Lynsey&#x27;s Love Songs&quot;. According to a news item on her website, she chose the songs she liked and researched the songwriters and people who made the records. De Paul also joined Vintage TV and in February 2012, the channel broadcast three episodes where de Paul interviewed the songwriters Gilbert O&#x27;Sullivan, Mike Batt and Howard Jones. Aled Jones interviewed de Paul on his &quot;Good Morning Sunday&quot; programme on BBC Radio 2 on 29 April 2012. He asked her about her life, career and religious beliefs as well as what inspired her. She attended the 2012 Ivor Novello Awards held at the Grosvenor House Hotel, London, on 17 May 2012. She was a member of the UK jury for the Eurovision Song Contest 2012. On 31 May that year, an interview with de Paul and her songs &quot;Sugar Me&quot; and &quot;Getting a Drag&quot; were featured in the BBC Radio 2 documentary, &quot;The Radio Luxembourg Story&quot;, about former rival station Radio Luxembourg.

On 15 September 2012, de Paul, together with Noddy Holder, co-hosted the Marc Bolan 35th anniversary concert, a special charity event for the PRS for Music Members Benevolent Fund held at the O2 Shepherd&#x27;s Bush Empire featuring Marc Almond, Boy George, Tony Visconti, Steve Harley, Alvin Stardust, Linda Lewis, Sandie Shaw, Glen Matlock, Mike Lindup, Andy Ellison and the Marc Bolan tribute band, Danielz and T.Rextasy. De Paul and Holder received glowing reviews as did the performers. One week later, de Paul was on stage again, appearing in the play, &quot;Hollywood Love&quot;. She played the role of the American actress and gossip columnist Hedda Hopper, together with Jeff Stewart, who portrayed the actor Gareth Hughes, who was Hopper&#x27;s friend. From 2013 until her death, de Paul was a regular guest newspaper reviewer for BBC Radio London 94.9 FM on the Simon Lederman Show, commenting on the day&#x27;s news and current affairs.

Two double CD anthologies of de Paul&#x27;s songs from the 1970s including previously unreleased tracks, entitled &quot;Sugar and Beyond&quot; and &quot;Into My Music&quot;, were released in March 2013 on the Cherry Red/RPM record label, a project that was personally overseen by de Paul. Also that month, de Paul appeared as a guest on The Ken Bruce BBC Radio 2 programme, &quot;Tracks of my Years&quot;, where she selected some of her favourite songs from other artists such as John Lennon, Earth, Wind &amp; Fire, Lee Ann Womack and R. Kelly. De Paul was one of the guests at the PRS for Music event &quot;100 Years of Music&quot; VIP launch in London, along with other UK based songwriters such as Cathy Dennis, Glenn Tilbrook, Mike Batt, Bob Geldof and Gary Kemp in March 2014. One of her last public appearances was as a trustee and guest at the unveiling of the Spike Milligan statue at Avenue House in Finchley on 4 September 2014.

In 2015, PRS for Music established an annual Lynsey de Paul prize for emerging female singer-songwriters in honour of the singer-songwriter. The 2015 winner of the prize was Emma McGrath, who was presented with the award at an event celebrating the life of Lynsey de Paul, hosted by Esther Rantzen. McGrath later said in an interview with &quot;Women&#x27;s Music News&quot; &quot;...I was 15 and I won the Lynsey de Paul Prize. I think that award is significant because she was creating a career at a time when it probably wasn&#x27;t as easy as it is now to be a female in the music industry&quot;. The second Lynsey de Paul prize was presented to Elsa Hewitt in September 2016. Jemio was awarded the prize in 2017. The PRS Foundation announced the 2018 winners of the Lynsey de Paul Prize on 27 September 2018, with soul singer-songwriter Amahla receiving the top bursary and five other (Bianca Gerald, Dani Sylvia, Fiona Lee, Rebekah Fitch and Harpy) being runners up. Amahla went on to receive a &quot;Rising Star Award&quot; from Apple Music, as announced by PRS.

In March 2018, de Paul was listed as one of the 65 iconic, most influential, women who have helped define the UK music industry from the 1950s until the present day by Annie Rew Shaw in &quot;Women&#x27;s Music News&quot;. Her performance of her song &quot;Sugar Shuffle&quot; appeared on the Bob Stanley compiled album, &quot;76 In The Shade&quot;, released in August 2020. It reached No. 23 on the Dutch album charts.

===Media mentions and influence===

At least four of de Paul&#x27;s songs have been used as the basis for other songs. The first was &quot;All I Am&quot;, which formed the music for the Buddha Monk song &quot;Dedicated&quot; that appeared on his 1998 Billboard charting album &quot;The Prophecy&quot; and that was co-credited to de Paul and Susan Sheridan. Bilal performed the song &quot;Certified&quot; which incorporates a looped sample of Klaus Wunderlich&#x27;s version of &quot;Sugar Me&quot; and resulted in a writing credit for de Paul and Blue on &quot;Guru&#x27;s Jazzmatazz, Vol. 3: Streetsoul&quot; album, released in 2000, which reached No. 32 on the Billboard 200 and No. 72 on the UK Albums Chart. The third song is &quot;You Don&#x27;t Know&quot;, by UK soul/funk outfit Smoove &amp; Turrell, that credits de Paul with co-writing the song; as it featured a long sample of her track &quot;Water&quot; from her debut album, &quot;Surprise&quot;.

The original recording of her song &quot;Won&#x27;t Somebody Dance With Me&quot; featured on a playlist of songs that director Nicolas Winding Refn circulated to the cast and crew of his film &quot;The Neon Demon&quot; to get them into the right mood for filming, and this was released on the album &quot;The Wicked Die Young&quot;, although this appears to be a cover version by Tina Charles.

De Paul has been impersonated on television programmes such as &quot;The Goodies Rule – O.K.?&quot;, aired on BBC One on 21 December 1975 where de Paul is played by Tim Brooke Taylor. The book &quot;Diary of a Rock&#x27;n&#x27;Roll Star&quot; by Ian Hunter mentions de Paul as a singer/songwriter of repute. In the 1998 novel &quot;Breakfast on Pluto&quot; by Patrick McCabe, the main character Patrick is said to resemble de Paul when he dresses up as his alter ego &quot;Pussy&quot;. One chapter in the book is entitled &quot;Lynsey de Paul&quot; and another &quot;Dancing on a Saturday Night&quot;; plus de Paul&#x27;s first hit &quot;Sugar Me&quot; was also mentioned. In the film version, his alter ego became &quot;Kitten&quot; and the de Paul reference was replaced by Dusty Springfield. De Paul is also mentioned in the book &quot;Untorn Tickets&quot; by Paul Burke. A character in the TV comedy movie &quot;You Are Here&quot; played by Paul Kaye is named Detective Inspector Lindsay de Paul. Her song &quot;Sugar Me&quot; is mentioned as one of the 10 songs used for writing the Dave Jeanes book &quot;Sweet Dreams&quot;.

The actor and writer Tom Conti told de Paul that he had written the book &quot;The Doctor&quot;, and she put him in contact with the publisher Jeremy Robson who published the book. De Paul was a guest of honour at the book launch party held at The Royal Society of Medicine, Chandos House, London on 29 September 2004. Carla Lane, writer of &quot;The Liver Birds&quot;, &quot;Butterflies&quot; and &quot;Bread&quot;, credited de Paul for goading her to write her autobiography, &quot;Someday I&#x27;ll Find Me&quot;. The Sharon Osbourne autobiography, &quot;Sharon Osbourne Extreme: My Autobiography&quot;, reveals that she was de Paul&#x27;s day-to-day person at Jet Records and that the two of them travelled to Los Angeles and the Seychelles. De Paul is also mentioned in &quot;Vail&quot; by Trevor Hoyle. Muppets creator, Jim Henson, was a friend of de Paul and James Coburn and, in his Red Book, revealed that he stayed in a guest house owned by de Paul in 1978, and he also spent Christmas Eve 1979 with de Paul and Coburn. She also featured in David Bailey and David Litchfield&#x27;s &quot;Ritz Newspaper&quot; in 1979. De Paul is also a contributor to &quot;Looking at Life&quot;, a book by Joe Pyle, a boxer turned film producer/recording manager, dispensing advice based on his life&#x27;s experiences. An article in &quot;The New York Times&quot; by Laura Rysman entitled &quot;How to Host a Dinner Party&quot;, included de Paul&#x27;s &quot;Sugar Me&quot; on D.J. Michel Gaubert&#x27;s special dinner-party playlist. De Paul is also featured in the 2009 book, &quot;Style City: How London Became a Fashion Capital&quot;, written by Robert O&#x27;Byrne.

Robert Holmes, the founder of the musical group Love Bomb, was inspired to choose this name for the group because of the de Paul song of the same name. The song &quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Winter (Loony&#x27;s Tune)&quot;, a UK chart hit by Wizzard was inspired and dedicated to de Paul by the song&#x27;s writer, Roy Wood. She is mentioned in the song &quot;False Grit&quot; by Half Man Half Biscuit. She is also mentioned in the lyrics to the song &quot;Man out of Time&quot; by musician, poet and erstwhile The Smiths collaborator, Vinny Peculiar (aka Alan Wilkes) that appeared on his 2019 album &quot;While You Still Can&quot;. De Paul was also name checked in the film &quot;The Great Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Swindle&quot; where it is mentioned that Richard Branson is in a mansion that &quot;overlooked the tomb of Karl Marx and the bedroom of Lynsey de Paul&quot;. The song &quot;Black Crow&quot; by London-based duo Beyond the Wizard&#x27;s Sleeve, was inspired by her song &quot;Sugar Me&quot;. Spanish singer-songwriter, Lia Pamina, cites de Paul as an influence, as has the British singer Kim Wilde. Toyah Willcox also acknowledged that de Paul was &quot;a really good songwriter&quot; The American singer songwriter Tori Amos has been compared to de Paul. The Japanese singer-songwriter &quot;Sugar Me&quot; (real name Ayumi Teraoka) took her name in honour of the de Paul song. Her photo appeared in the Patrick Lichfield book &quot;The Most Beautiful Women&quot;. The Louis Vuitton Spring Summer 2012 fashion show advertisement campaign, used de Paul&#x27;s &quot;Sugar Me&quot; as the soundtrack, as did Adam Selman for his Spring/Summer 2018 show as part of the New York Fashion Week held in September 2017. &quot;Sugar Me&quot; also featured on the sound track to the 2021 US TV series &quot;Physical&quot;.

Paul Phillips, the British singer-songwriter, journalist at &quot;Music Week&quot;, and a former A&amp;R man and record producer at CBS Records, recalled &quot;Lynsey de Paul was tougher than she looked, and more talented than her career appeared to allow for. She was the first female to win an Ivor Novello Award, and it wasn&#x27;t her last. Her name as writer or co-writer is on a lot more songs than those you remember her for. She was a woman in what was, for sure, a man&#x27;s world. For all her female and feminine attributes, she held her own with the toughest, including Sean Connery and James Coburn. Later, she learned self-defence and made documentaries on the subject, for other women. She donated to charities that helped battered women. Later still, she admitted her father had been violently abusive. Much of her post-pop life was devoted to bringing focus to ways in which women could protect themselves, mentally and physically. So she wasn&#x27;t the pop poppet of her 70s image. She was a gifted musician, classically trained. She arranged and recorded various pieces of classical music, which she scored for her own style&quot;. Alan McGee chose &quot;Sugar Me&quot; as one of his favourite songs and praised de Paul&#x27;s songwriting, especially &quot;Storm in a Teacup&quot; on the radio programme &quot;Alice in Londonland&quot; on Soho Radio.

In an interview with Drew Tosh from &quot;Northern Soul&quot; about female singer-songwriters, Bronté Barbé said &quot;In the early 70s UK musical landscape, Lynsey de Paul was the only British woman to achieve major success with her own work. She wrote 14 hits over five years and performed seven of them herself. In 1974 she became the first woman to win a coveted Ivor Novello song writing award going on to win another the following year. An accomplished pianist, producer and arranger, her distinctive multi-tracked falsetto vocals were later favoured by the likes of Enya. Often seen as a precursor to Kate Bush&quot;.

Light is shed on de Paul&#x27;s character in the book &quot;Everybody Died, So I Got a Dog&quot;, written by the writer and radio presenter, Emily Dean, who as a girl was fascinated by her neighbour and she recounts wise advice that de Paul gave her. Dean also mentioned de Paul in a magazine interview she gave for &quot;Saga&quot;. De Paul is also mentioned several times in &quot;Broken Greek&quot;, the evocative memoir by the music writer by Pete Paphides. She also features prominently in the biography of James Coburn, written by Coburn&#x27;s daughter-in-law and based on material from tapes recorded by Coburn for an unfinished autobiography.

Close friend Esther Rantzen was quoted as saying &quot;Lynsey was a close friend and neighbour and we saw a lot of each other. She was beautiful and ageless; she looked 35 and was so gifted. She was a writer and composer but she was also very clever with words, very witty. Obviously she sang and played the piano, but she was also an artist, she painted as well. In fact, she could do everything. I called her Renaissance woman. She really was quite outstanding&quot;.

==Personal life==
De Paul never married. She was romantically involved with Dudley Moore, Chas Chandler, Roy Wood, Ringo Starr, James Coburn, Bill Kenwright, Dodi Fayed, George Best, Bernie Taupin and David Frost, receiving five marriage proposals (one from Chandler and another from Coburn). De Paul also had an affair with Sean Connery, which she later said she regretted. She claimed to be &quot;horrified&quot; after discovering comments Connery had made in interviews in which he had suggested it was acceptable to hit women. De Paul later stated that Connery&#x27;s remarks and her upbringing with a violent father inspired her participation in campaigns to raise awareness against domestic violence. In his autobiography, George Best said that de Paul was &quot;fiercely independent&quot;. In 1977, in an interview with music journalist Barry Cain that appeared in &quot;Record Mirror&quot;, de Paul prophetically said, &quot;I guess I&#x27;ll never get married. My first love will always be music.&quot;

Prince Charles was also quite enamoured with de Paul. The two met at a charity dinner party at The Ritz in Piccadilly. In his book &quot;Settling Down&quot;, James Whitaker, the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot;&#x27;s royal editor, wrote, &quot;Fellow guests that night sat entranced as the Prince grew more and more friendly towards Lynsey, clearly bowled over by the diminutive singer&#x27;s looks and bubbly personality&quot;.

She was a patron of the Spike Milligan Statue Memorial Fund and was present for the unveiling of the statue in his honour in September 2014. She was also a friend of another ex-Goon, Michael Bentine, and a former neighbour of Michael Palin, who mentions her in his published diaries.

During the 1970s, de Paul bought a gothic style home, facing Highgate Cemetery East, in Holly Village, Highgate, before moving in the 1990s to a Victorian mansion in Hampstead, in North London. She named it &quot;Moot Grange&quot;, an anagram of &quot;No Mortgage&quot;, after also considering &quot;Gnome Groat&quot; and &quot;No Meat/Grog&quot;, the latter because she was vegetarian and teetotal. Her home at the time of her death, was in Mill Hill, in North West London. De Paul was a long-time campaigner for animal rights and shared her house with a three-legged cat called Tripod.

Politically, de Paul was referred to as a supporter of the Conservative Party and appeared at the 1983 Conservative conference along with other celebrities where she sang a jingle she had composed for the event, even though earlier in her career she was more associated with the Liberal party.

She put her career on hold at the end of the 1990s until the end of 2001 to look after her ailing mother, who, until she died, was the company secretary for Lynsey de Paul Music Limited. Upon de Paul&#x27;s own death in 2014, her brother John, a consultant surveyor by training, was appointed sole company director of her music company.

==Death==
De Paul suffered a brain haemorrhage on the morning of 1 October 2014 at her home in Mill Hill and was later pronounced dead at Barnet General Hospital. Her niece, Olivia Rubin, told &quot;The Times&quot; that her death was &quot;completely unexpected&quot;, adding: &quot;She was a vegetarian, she didn&#x27;t smoke, she didn&#x27;t drink—she was amazing, in fact.&quot; Broadcaster and friend Esther Rantzen, for whose television series &quot;Hearts of Gold&quot; de Paul had written the theme, said: &quot;She was a renaissance woman. She could do everything: she could sing, she could compose, she was an immensely talented artist. She became a huge star but she was also a loyal and generous friend. It&#x27;s an absolutely tragic loss.&quot; Def Leppard singer Joe Elliott paid tribute to de Paul on his 4 October 2014 Planet Rock radio show, playing the album version of &quot;Roll Away The Stone&quot; by Mott the Hoople featuring de Paul&#x27;s spoken vocals. Elliott said &quot;I&#x27;m playing this song in memory of a wonderful lady called Lynsey de Paul who passed away at the very tender age of 64 this week. She in her own right was a fantastic singer and songwriter&quot;.

She was interred with a Humanist funeral at Hendon Cemetery. De Paul is listed on the official Grammy website under &quot;remembering the music people we lost in 2014–15&quot;.

<doc id="448876" wikidata="Q7821470" url="?curid=448876" title="Tonight at 8.30">
<text>Tonight at 8.30 is a cycle of ten one-act plays by Noël Coward, presented in London in 1936 and in New York in 1936–1937, with the author and Gertrude Lawrence in the leading roles. The plays are mostly comedies, but three, &quot;The Astonished Heart&quot;, &quot;Shadow Play&quot; and &quot;Still Life&quot;, are serious. Four of the comedies include songs, with words and music by Coward.

One play, &quot;Star Chamber&quot;, was dropped after a single performance. The other nine plays were presented in three programmes of three plays each. There have been numerous revivals of many of the individual plays, but revivals of the complete cycle have been much less frequent. Several of the plays have been adapted for the cinema and television.

&quot;Tonight at 8.30&quot; was first presented in 1935 in Manchester and then on tour in six other British cities, before opening in London and New York the following year.

==Background==
In the late 1920s and early 1930s, Coward wrote a succession of hits, ranging from the operetta &quot;Bitter Sweet&quot; (1929) and the epic &quot;Cavalcade&quot; (1931), requiring a large cast, gargantuan sets and a complex hydraulic stage, to the intimate comedies &quot;Private Lives&quot; (1930), in which Coward starred alongside Gertrude Lawrence, and &quot;Design for Living&quot; (1932). Coward said that after &quot;Private Lives&quot;, he felt that the public enjoyed seeing him and Lawrence together on stage, and so he wrote the play cycle &quot;Tonight at 8.30&quot; as &quot;acting, singing, and dancing vehicles for Gertrude Lawrence and myself&quot;.

In the programme for the London run Coward wrote:
==Plays==
The cycle consists of ten plays. In order of first production they are:
* &quot;We Were Dancing&quot; – &quot;A comedy in two scenes&quot;
* &quot;The Astonished Heart&quot; – &quot;A play in six scenes&quot;
* &quot;Red Peppers&quot; – &quot;An interlude with music&quot;
* &quot;Hands Across the Sea&quot; – &quot;A light comedy in one scene&quot;
* &quot;Fumed Oak&quot; – &quot;An unpleasant comedy in two scenes&quot;
* &quot;Shadow Play&quot; – &quot;A play with music&quot;
* &quot;Family Album&quot; – &quot;A Victorian comedy with music&quot;
* &quot;Star Chamber&quot; – &quot;A light comedy in one act&quot;
* &quot;Ways and Means&quot; – &quot;A comedy in three scenes&quot;
* &quot;Still Life&quot; – &quot;A play in five scenes&quot;

===Songs===
Four of the plays in the cycle are musical. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, they &quot;break into spontaneous song ... in the most unexpected places&quot;. The songs from &quot;Tonight at 8.30&quot; are:
*&quot;We Were Dancing&quot;, from &quot;We Were Dancing&quot;
*&quot;Has Anybody Seen our Ship?&quot; and &quot;Men About Town&quot; from &quot;Red Peppers&quot;
*&quot;Then&quot;, &quot;Play, Orchestra, Play&quot; and &quot;You Were There&quot; from &quot;Shadow Play&quot;
*&quot;Drinking Song&quot;, &quot;Princes and Princesses&quot;, &quot;Music Box&quot; and &quot;Hearts and Flowers&quot; from &quot;Family Album&quot;.

==Productions==
===Original provincial production and tour===
Six of the plays (&quot;We Were Dancing, The Astonished Heart, Red Peppers, Hands Across the Sea, Fumed Oak&quot; and &quot;Shadow Play&quot;) were first presented at the Opera House, Manchester, beginning on 15 October 1935. A seventh play, &quot;Family Album&quot;, was added on the subsequent nine-week provincial tour. The final three were added for the London run: &quot;Ways and Means, Still Life&quot; and &quot;Star Chamber&quot;, which was performed only once.

===London and New York premieres===
The first London performance was on 9 January 1936 at the Phoenix Theatre. Matinées were billed as &quot;To-day at 2.30&quot;. The first set of three plays presented comprised &quot;Family Album&quot;, &quot;The Astonished Heart&quot; and &quot;Red Peppers&quot;. Four days later the second trio was presented: &quot;Hands Across the Sea&quot;, &quot;Fumed Oak&quot; and &quot;Shadow Play&quot;. &quot;We Were Dancing&quot; was introduced on 29 January, and &quot;Ways and Means&quot; and &quot;Still Life&quot; were added in May. &quot;Star Chamber&quot;&#x27;s only performance was on 21 March.

Partly to allow himself time to write, and partly because he hated acting in long runs, Coward&#x27;s practice was to play for no more than six months in any run. The London production closed on 20 June 1936, after 157 performances. The American production opened in New York, after a try-out in Boston, on 24 November and played for 118 performances. The Broadway openings for the three parts were on 24, 27 and 30 November 1936, again starring Coward and Lawrence. Reviewing the Boston performances, James Thurber wrote:

The New York run finished a month earlier than planned, because Coward&#x27;s health broke down from overwork and his doctor insisted on an immediate break.

===Revivals===
The cycle was given in Canada in 1938 by an American touring company, led by Bramwell Fletcher.
Major productions of parts of the cycle included Broadway revivals in 1948 (&quot;Red Peppers&quot;, &quot;Hands Across the Sea&quot;, &quot;Fumed Oak&quot;, &quot;Family Album&quot;, &quot;Shadow Play,&quot; and &quot;Ways and Means&quot;, starring Lawrence and Graham Payn), and 1967 (&quot;Fumed Oak, Still Life&quot; and &quot;Ways and Means&quot;), 1981 at the Lyric Theatre in London (&quot;Shadow Play&quot;, &quot;Hands Across the Sea&quot; and &quot;Red Peppers&quot;), starring John Standing and Estelle Kohler and at the Chichester Festival in 2006 (&quot;Shadow Play&quot;, &quot;Hands Across the Sea&quot;, &quot;Red Peppers&quot;, &quot;Family Album&quot;, &quot;Fumed Oak&quot; and &quot;The Astonished Heart&quot;). In 1971, the Shaw Festival revived &quot;We Were Dancing&quot;, &quot;Family Album&quot; and &quot;Shadow Play&quot;, and in 2000, the Williamstown Theatre Festival revived &quot;We Were Dancing&quot;, &quot;Family Album&quot;, &quot;Hands Across the Sea&quot; (all starring Blythe Danner), &quot;Red Peppers,&quot; &quot;Shadow Play&quot; and &quot;Star Chamber&quot;. The Antaeus Company in Los Angeles revived all ten plays in October 2007, as did the Shaw Festival in 2009.

The first professional revival of the cycle in Britain was in April 2014, when English Touring Theatre staged all the plays except for &quot;Star Chamber&quot;. The critic Michael Billington wrote, &quot;We are used to all-day stagings of Shakespeare. A marathon viewing of three Noel Coward triple bills, however, sounds like a banquet of soufflés. In the event, the nine plays … not only prove unexpectedly nourishing, but also reveal a lot about the author himself.&quot; The production, co-produced by the Nuffield Theatre, Southampton, opened there before a three-month national tour. In 2018 a revival played at Jermyn Street Theatre in London, directed by Tom Littler, omitting &quot;Fumed Oak&quot; but including &quot;Star Chamber&quot;. The cast included Sara Crowe, Ian Hallard and Rosemary Ashe.

==Adaptations==
===Cinema===
Several films have been based on the plays. &quot;We Were Dancing&quot; was loosely adapted as a film of the same name in 1942, starring Norma Shearer and Melvyn Douglas. Coward adapted &quot;Still Life&quot; for the screen as &quot;Brief Encounter&quot; in 1945. The film was remade in 1974 starring Richard Burton and Sophia Loren. For a 1952 film, &quot;Meet Me Tonight&quot; (called &quot;Tonight at 8:30&quot; in the US), directed by Anthony Pelissier, Coward adapted &quot;Ways and Means&quot;, &quot;Red Peppers&quot; and &quot;Fumed Oak&quot;. Coward played Christian Faber in a 1950 film of &quot;The Astonished Heart&quot; (also starring Celia Johnson and Margaret Leighton).

===Television===
Eight of the plays in the cycle (omitting &quot;Star Chamber&quot; and &quot;We Were Dancing&quot;) were adapted for television in 1991, by the BBC, starring Joan Collins. Television adaptations of &quot;Red Peppers&quot; were released in 1937, 1938, 1958 and 1969, the last starring Bruce Forsyth and Dora Bryan as the Peppers and Edith Evans as Mabel Grace. &quot;Still Life&quot; was given a television production in 1951. The NBC-TV anthology series &quot;Producers&#x27; Showcase&quot; debuted on 18 October 1954 with &quot;Shadow Play&quot;, &quot;Still Life&quot; and &quot;Red Peppers&quot;, produced and directed by Otto Preminger, starring Ginger Rogers in all three; Martyn Green also starred in &quot;Red Peppers&quot;. &quot;Hands Across the Sea&quot; was adapted for television in 1938.

<text>The Emblem of Guinea-Bissau was adopted shortly after independence from Portugal in 1973.

== Design ==
Featured prominently is a black star, that is part of traditional Pan-African symbolism, and is often referred to as the Black star of Africa. A seashell at the bottom unites two symmetrical olive branches. The seashell is symbolism for the location of the country on the West coast of Africa.

The red banner contains the national motto of Guinea-Bissau: that translates to English as &quot;Unity, Struggle, Progress&quot;.

==Historical coat of arms==
In 1935, the Portuguese colonies were officially assigned coats of arms that followed a standard design pattern.

<doc id="448884" wikidata="Q102953" url="?curid=448884" title="Flag of Guinea-Bissau">
<text>The national flag of Guinea-Bissau was adopted on 24 September 1973, the day the country proclaimed its independence from Portugal.

== Design ==

Like the former flag of Cape Verde, the flag is based on that of the African Party for the Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde (PAIGC). The party was established in 1956 to peacefully campaign for independence from Portugal during its Estado Novo regime but turned to armed conflict in the 1960s and was one of the belligerents in the 1963–74 Guinea-Bissau War of Independence. It is still the dominant party in Guinea-Bissau. The PAIGC party flag was derived from that of Ghana, which was the first design to use the Pan-African combination of red, yellow, green, and black in 1957.

In the Ghanaian view, the black star stands for the unity of Africa. Red stands for the blood shed during the struggle for independence, yellow stands for the sun, and green represents hope.

The flag features the traditional Pan-African colors of gold, green, red, and also the Black Star of Africa.The flag&#x27;s design is heavily influenced by the flag of Ghana. The colors have the same meanings: specifically, the red is for the blood of martyrs, green for forests, and gold for mineral wealth.

==Systematics and evolution==
The fossil record of casuariforms is interesting, but not very extensive.

Some Australian fossils initially believed to be from emus were recognized to represent a distinct genus, &quot;Emuarius&quot;,
which had a cassowary-like skull and femur and an emu-like lower leg and foot.

<text>Dromaius (from greek δρομαίυς &quot;runner&quot;) is a genus of ratite present in Australia. There is one extant species, &quot;Dromaius novaehollandiae,&quot; commonly known as the emu.

In his original 1816 description of the emu, Louis Pierre Vieillot used two generic names; first &quot;Dromiceius&quot;, then &quot;Dromaius&quot; a few pages later. Which label is correct has been a point of contention ever since; the latter is more correctly formed, but the convention in taxonomy is that the first name given stands, unless it is clearly a typographical error, as argued by W.B. Alexander. For names published on the same day, or in the same publication, the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature states that both names have equal precedence, and that the Principle of First Reviser (Article 24.2 ) determines which name is to be used. Most modern publications, including those of the Australian government, use &quot;Dromaius&quot;, with &quot;Dromiceius&quot; mentioned as an alternative spelling. Misspellings of both forms by later authors have produced further synonyms. The &quot;Dromiceius&quot; spelling was the basis for Dale Russell&#x27;s 1972 naming of the dinosaur &quot;Dromiceiomimus&quot;.

==Species and subspecies==
The following species and subspecies are recognized:
* &quot;Dromaius novaehollandiae&quot;, emu, remains common in most of the more lightly settled parts of mainland Australia. Overall population varies from decade to decade according to rainfall; as low as 200,000 and as high as 1,000,000, but a typical figure is about half a million individuals. Although emus are no longer found in the densely settled southern and southwestern agricultural areas, the provision of permanent stock water in arid regions has allowed the mainland subspecies to extend its range. There are five recognised subspecies or races of the emu:
** &quot;Dromaius novaehollandiae novaehollandiae&quot; – Southeastern Australia – whitish ruff when breeding.
** &quot;Dromaius novaehollandiae woodwardi&quot; – Northern Australia – slender, paler (not recognised as a subspecies by all authorities).
** &quot;Dromaius novaehollandiae rothschildi&quot; – Southwestern Australia – darker, no ruff during breeding (not recognised as a subspecies by all authorities).
** †&quot;Dromaius novaehollandiae diemenensis&quot; – Tasmania – The Tasmanian emu, which became extinct around 1850.
** †&quot;Dromaius novaehollandiae minor&quot; – King Island – The King Island emu was about half the size of the mainland species. By 1805 it had been hunted to extinction by sealers and visiting sailors. Some individuals were kept in captivity in Paris, the last one dying in 1822. Vieillot coined the name &quot;Dromaius ater&quot;, but in his 1907 book &quot;Extinct Birds&quot;, Walter Rothschild stated that Vieillot&#x27;s description actually referred to the mainland emu and that the name &quot;D. ater&quot; was therefore invalid. It was thought to be a distinct species until 2011.
** †&quot;Dromaius novaehollandiae baudinianus&quot; - Kangaroo Island - The Kangaroo Island emu became extinct around 1827 as a result of hunting and frequent fires. The larger mainland subspecies was introduced to Kangaroo Island in the 1920s.
* †&quot;Dromaius ocypus&quot;, a prehistoric species of emu, described from Late Pliocene fossils (Mampuwordu Sands Formation, Lake Palankarinna, Australia), currently accepted as distinct.
* †&quot;Dromaius arleyekweke&quot;, a diminutive species of emu, known from dispersed skeletal elements from the Miocene Waite Formation (Northern Territory, Australia)

A number of other emu fossils from Australia described as separate species are now regarded as chronosubspecies at best, given the considerable variation even between living individuals. There are also some unidentifiable remains of emu-like birds from rocks as old as the middle Miocene.

<text>The Great North Woods, also known as the Northern Forest, are spread across four northeastern U.S. states: Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont and New York in the New England area. The area spans from the Down East lakes of Maine to the Adirondack Mountains of New York, generally bordering the Canadian province of Quebec. Collectively, the Great North Woods make up a 26 million acre (105,000 km2) forestland.

== States ==
=== New Hampshire ===

In New Hampshire, the Great North Woods Region is an official state tourist region, located in Coös County, the northernmost county in the state. The northern part of the White Mountain National Forest is located in this region. The city of Berlin, formerly known for its large paper mill, is also found in this region.

=== New York ===
Upstate New York&#x27;s Great North Woods is located in the extreme northern part of the state. Like Maine and Vermont, the Great North Woods region is an unofficial region. In New York, this region mainly consists of the Adirondack Mountains, as defined by the Adirondack Park.

=== Maine ===
Within Maine, the Great North Woods include the Maine North Woods, which are unincorporated townships in Aroostook County. This is an unofficial region of Maine, and no official population figures are published.

=== Vermont ===
Vermont&#x27;s Great North Woods region is an unofficial region of Vermont, and is located mainly in the Northeast Kingdom, bordering New Hampshire and Québec. The Northeast Kingdom region of Vermont is very remote and rural. The northern part of the Green Mountain National Forest is in this region.

<text>Blithe Spirit is a comic play by Noël Coward, described by the author as &quot;an improbable farce in three acts&quot;. The play concerns the socialite and novelist Charles Condomine, who invites the eccentric medium and clairvoyant Madame Arcati to his house to conduct a séance, hoping to gather material for his next book. The scheme backfires when he is haunted by the ghost of his wilful and temperamental first wife, Elvira, after the séance. Elvira makes continual attempts to disrupt Charles&#x27;s marriage to his second wife, Ruth, who cannot see or hear the ghost.

The play was first seen in the West End in 1941 and ran for 1,997 performances, a new record for a non-musical play in London. It also did well on Broadway later that year, running for 657 performances. The play was adapted for the cinema in 1945; a second film version followed in 2020. Coward directed a musical adaptation, &quot;High Spirits&quot;, seen on Broadway and in the West End in 1964. Radio and television presentations of the play have been broadcast in Britain and the US from 1944 onwards. It continues to be revived in the West End, on Broadway and elsewhere.
==Background==
The title of the play is taken from Shelley&#x27;s poem &quot;To a Skylark&quot;, (&quot;Hail to thee, blithe Spirit! / Bird thou never wert&quot;). For some time before 1941 Coward had been thinking of a comedy about ghosts. His first thoughts centred on an old house in Paris, haunted by spectres from different centuries, with the comedy arising from their conflicting attitudes, but he could not get the plot to work in his mind. He knew that in wartime Britain, with death a constant presence, there would be some objection to a comedy about ghosts, but his firm view was that as the story would be thoroughly heartless, &quot;you can&#x27;t sympathise with any of them. If there &quot;was&quot; a heart it would be a sad story.&quot;

After his London office and flat had been destroyed in the Blitz, Coward took a short holiday with the actress Joyce Carey at Portmeirion on the coast of Snowdonia in Wales. She was writing a play about Keats, and he was still thinking about his ghostly light comedy. He later recounted:
==Synopsis==
Charles Condomine is a successful novelist. At the start of the play, while dressing for dinner, he and his second wife, Ruth, discuss his first wife, Elvira, who died young, seven years earlier. He comments, &quot;I remember her physical attractiveness, which was tremendous, and her spiritual integrity, which was nil&quot;. Among the Condomines&#x27; dinner guests is an eccentric medium, Madame Arcati, whom Charles has invited in the hope of learning about the occult for a story he is writing. He has arranged for her to conduct a séance after dinner. During the séance she plays a recording of Irving Berlin&#x27;s song &quot;Always&quot; on the gramophone, inadvertently attracting the ghost of Elvira.

The medium leaves, unaware of what she has done. Only Charles can see or hear Elvira, and Ruth does not believe that Elvira exists, until a floating vase is handed to her out of thin air. The ghostly Elvira makes continued, and increasingly desperate, efforts to disrupt Charles&#x27;s current marriage. Charles accuses her of being &quot;feckless and irresponsible and morally unstable&quot;. She finally sabotages his car in the hope of killing him so that he will join her in the spirit world, but it is Ruth rather than Charles who drives off and is killed.

Ruth&#x27;s ghost immediately comes back for revenge on Elvira, and though Charles cannot at first see Ruth, he can see that Elvira is being chased and tormented, and his house is in uproar. He calls Madame Arcati back to exorcise both the spirits, but instead of banishing them she unintentionally materialises Ruth. With both his dead wives now fully visible, and neither of them in the best of tempers, Charles, together with Madame Arcati, goes through séance after séance and spell after spell to try to exorcise them. It is not until Madame Arcati works out that the housemaid, Edith, is psychic and had unwittingly been the conduit through which Elvira was summoned that she succeeds in dematerialising both ghosts. Charles is left seemingly in peace, but Madame Arcati, hinting that the ghosts may still be around unseen, warns him that he should go far away as soon as possible. Coward repeats one of his signature theatrical devices at the end of the play, where the central character tiptoes out as the curtain falls – a device that he also used in &quot;Present Laughter&quot;, &quot;Private Lives &quot;and &quot;Hay Fever&quot;. Charles bids his vanished wives farewell and leaves at once; the unseen ghosts throw things and wreck the room as soon as he has gone.

==First production==
&quot;Blithe Spirit&quot; was first produced at the Manchester Opera House on 16 June 1941, and then premiered in the West End on 2 July. During the long London run − 1,997 performances − it played at three theatres. It opened at the Piccadilly Theatre, transferred to the St James&#x27;s Theatre on 23 March 1942 and then to the Duchess Theatre on 6 October 1942, closing on 9 March 1946. It was directed by Coward; sets and costumes were designed by Gladys Calthrop. The run set a record for non-musical plays in the West End that was not surpassed until September 1957 by &quot;The Mousetrap&quot;.

===Original cast===
* Charles Condomine – Cecil Parker
* Ruth – Fay Compton
* Elvira – Kay Hammond
* Madame Arcati – Margaret Rutherford
* Dr Bradman – Martin Lewis 
* Mrs Bradman – Moya Nugent 
* Edith, a maid – Ruth Reeves

There were several changes of cast during the run; all but two of the roles were played by different performers at one time or another. Only Martin Lewis and Moya Nugent stayed from the first night to the last. Irene Browne played two different characters during the run. After playing the steely Ruth from 1942 to 1944 she appeared for six months in 1945 as the ebullient Madame Arcati. As well as changes in the regular principals, other actors − including Coward − appeared for short spells of two or more weeks to allow the regulars to take a holiday.

While the play continued its London run several tours were organised. A company under the management of Ronald Squire began a British tour in February 1942. The cast included Squire (Charles), Browne (Ruth), Ursula Jeans (Elvira), and Agnes Lauchlan (Madame Arcati). A company headed by Coward presented the piece along with &quot;Present Laughter&quot; and &quot;This Happy Breed&quot; under the collective title of &quot;Play Parade&quot;, in a 25-week tour from September 1942. Coward played Charles; Joyce Carey, Ruth; Judy Campbell, Elvira; and Beryl Measor, Madame Arcati. Another tour went out in 1943, headed by John Wentworth as Charles and Mona Washbourne as Madame Arcati.

From February 1944 an ENSA company toured the Middle East and continental Europe with &quot;Blithe Spirit&quot;. Emlyn Williams played Charles; Jessie Evans and Elliott Mason shared the role of Madame Arcati, Adrianne Allen played Ruth; and Lueen MacGrath, Elvira. From October 1945 to February 1946 another ENSA company played &quot;Blithe Spirit&quot; (and &quot;Hamlet&quot;) in India and Burma for the armed forces. John Gielgud played Charles; Irene Browne, Madame Arcati; Marian Spencer, Ruth; and Hazel Terry, Elvira.

==Later productions==
===Britain===
In July 1970 the play was revived in the West End at the Globe Theatre, starring Patrick Cargill as Charles, Phyllis Calvert as Ruth, Amanda Reiss as Elvira and Beryl Reid as Madame Arcati; it ran until January 1971. It was revived by the National Theatre in 1976 in a production directed by Harold Pinter, starring Richard Johnson as Charles, Rowena Cooper as Ruth, Maria Aitken as Elvira and Elizabeth Spriggs as Madame Arcati. Another London revival played in 1986 at the Vaudeville Theatre, starring Simon Cadell as Charles, Jane Asher as Ruth, Joanna Lumley as Elvira and Marcia Warren as Madame Arcati. A 1997 revival at the Chichester Festival, directed by Tim Luscombe, featured Steven Pacey (Charles), Belinda Lang (Ruth), Twiggy (Elvira) and Dora Bryan as Madame Arcati.
The piece was back in the West End at the Savoy Theatre in 2004, in a production directed by Thea Sharrock, starring Aden Gillett as Charles, Joanna Riding as Ruth, Amanda Drew as Elvira and Penelope Keith (succeeded by Stephanie Cole) as Madame Arcati. Matt Wolf wrote in &quot;Variety&quot;, &quot;Sharrock and her company land every laugh in a play that induces an indecent amount of pleasure while never letting us forget the extent to which &quot;Blithe Spirit&quot; comes marinated in pain.&quot;

Sharrock directed a revival of her production of the play, which started as a UK tour and then moved to the Apollo Theatre, London. It ran there from March to June 2011, with a cast including Robert Bathurst as Charles, Hermione Norris as Ruth, Ruthie Henshall as Elvira and Alison Steadman as Madame Arcati.

A West End production, directed by Michael Blakemore, opened at the Gielgud Theatre in March 2014, with Charles Edwards as Charles, Janie Dee as Ruth, Jemima Rooper as Elvira, Angela Lansbury as Madame Arcati, and Jones as Dr Bradman as in Blakemore&#x27;s 2009 Broadway production. It ran until June.

A revival at the Theatre Royal Bath in 2019 was followed by a UK tour and a West End run at the Duke of York&#x27;s Theatre that opened in March 2020. After 12 performances, it was interrupted due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The production starred Jennifer Saunders as Madame Arcati and Richard Eyre directed. Geoffrey Streatfeild and Lisa Dillon played Charles and Ruth Condomine, Simon Coates and Lucy Robinson were Dr and Mrs Bradman, Emma Naomi played Elvira and Rose Wardlaw was Edith. Design was by Anthony Ward, lighting by Howard Harrison, sound by John Leonard and illusions by Paul Kieve.

The Eyre production returned to the West End for a limited run from September to November 2021 at the Harold Pinter Theatre with the same cast and crew, except that Madeleine Mantock played Elvira.

====London casts, 1970 to 2019====
===America===
The Broadway premiere was on 5 November 1941 at the Morosco Theatre, presented by Coward&#x27;s American producer, John C. Wilson, with designs by Stewart Chaney. The play transferred to the Booth Theatre on 18 May 1942; it ran for a total of 657 performances. The play won the New York Drama Critics&#x27; Circle Award for Best Foreign Play for the 1941–1942 season. After closing at the Booth on 5 June 1943, a return engagement played 32 performances from 6 September to 2 October 1943 at the Morosco. Haila Stoddard took over as Elvira. While the first Broadway production was still running, Wilson mounted another in Chicago. It opened on 17 February 1942 at the Selwyn Theater.

&quot;Blithe Spirit&quot; was revived on Broadway at the Neil Simon Theatre on 31 March 1987 in a production directed by Brian Murray. It starred Richard Chamberlain as Charles, Judith Ivey as Ruth, Blythe Danner as Elvira and Geraldine Page as Madame Arcati. It ran for 104 performances. Page, who received a Tony Award nomination for Best Actress, died of a heart attack during the run; Patricia Conolly succeeded her in the role.

A Broadway revival played in 2009 at the Shubert Theatre. Blakemore directed, with Rupert Everett as Charles, Jayne Atkinson as Ruth, Christine Ebersole as Elvira, Angela Lansbury as Madame Arcati and Simon Jones as Dr Bradman. &quot;The New York Times&quot; found the revival somewhat uneven, calling the opening performance &quot;bumpy&quot;, but praised Lansbury&#x27;s performance. 

A revival, directed by Blakemore with most of the West End cast (including Lansbury at age 89) except Charlotte Parry as Ruth, toured North America from December 2014 to March 2015, visiting Los Angeles, San Francisco, Toronto and Washington D.C.

====American casts, 1941 to 2011====
===Australia===
A production at the Comedy Theatre, Melbourne in April 1945 starred Edwin Styles as Charles, Aileen Britton as Ruth, Bettina Welch as Elvira and Letty Craydon as Madame Arcati. In 2003 Roger Hodgman directed a production by the Melbourne Theatre Company, with Miriam Margolyes as Arcati. It later played the Sydney Opera House.

===France===
A French translation, &quot;Jeux d&#x27;esprits&quot;, was presented at the Théâtre de la Madeleine, Paris, in November 1946, directed by Pierre Dux, with Robert Murzeau as Charles, Renée Devillers as Suzanne (Ruth), Simone Renant as Elvire (Elvira) and Jeanne Fusier-Gir as Madame Arcati. In &quot;Le Figaro&quot; Jean-Jacques Gautier acknowledged Coward as a master of comic absurdity but found the piece &quot;thin, thin, thin&quot; – the champagne a little lacking in sparkle.

==Critical reception==
After the first performance in Manchester the reviewer in &quot;The Manchester Guardian&quot; thought the mixture of farce and impending tragedy &quot;An odd mixture and not untouched by genius of a sort&quot;. After the London premiere, Ivor Brown commented in &quot;The Observer&quot; on the skill with which Coward had treated his potentially difficult subject; he ended his notice, &quot;But here is a new play, a gay play, and one irresistibly propelled into our welcoming hearts by Miss Rutherford&#x27;s Lady of the Trances, as rapt a servant of the séance as ever had spirits on tap.&quot; The London correspondent of &quot;The Guardian&quot; wrote, &quot;London received Mr Noel Coward&#x27;s ghoulish farce with loud, though not quite unanimous acclaim. There was a solitary boo – from an annoyed spiritualist, presumably.&quot; &quot;The Times&quot; considered the piece the equal not only of Coward&#x27;s earlier success &quot;Hay Fever&quot; but of Wilde&#x27;s classic comedy &quot;The Importance of Being Earnest&quot;. There were dissenting views. James Agate thought the play &quot;common&quot;, and Graham Greene called it &quot;a weary exhibition of bad taste&quot;.

When the piece had its first West End revival in 1970 the play was warmly though not rapturously praised by the critics, but by the time of the next major production, in 1976, Irving Wardle of &quot;The Times&quot; considered, &quot;Stylistically, it is Coward&#x27;s masterpiece: his most complete success in imposing his own view of things on the brute facts of existence,&quot; and Michael Billington of &quot;The Guardian&quot; wrote of Coward&#x27;s influence on Harold Pinter. Coward&#x27;s partner, Graham Payn, commented to Peter Hall that Coward would have loved the production (directed by Pinter) &quot;because at last the play was centred on the marriage between Charles and Ruth; Elvira and ... Madame Arcati were incidentals&quot;. After the Broadway revival in 1987 &quot;Newsweek&quot; commented that the play reminds us that Coward was the precursor of playwrights like Pinter and Joe Orton.

In 2004 Charles Spencer of &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; wrote, &quot;With &quot;Hay Fever&quot; and &quot;Private Lives&quot;, &quot;Blithe Spirit&quot; strikes me as being one of Coward&#x27;s three indisputable comic masterpieces. [It is] the outrageous frivolity with which Coward treats mortality that makes the piece so bracing.&quot;

==Adaptations==

===Film===
&quot;Blithe Spirit&quot; has twice been adapted for the cinema. A 1945 film was directed by David Lean, and starred two of the principals from the original stage production reprising their roles: Kay Hammond as Elvira and Margaret Rutherford as Madame Arcati. Constance Cummings played Ruth, and Rex Harrison Charles. Coward was out of the country during the filming and was therefore obliged to leave the direction to Lean. The author was less than impressed with the result. He found Lean&#x27;s direction static and said that the film &quot;wasn&#x27;t entirely bad but it was a great deal less good than it should have been&quot;.

A 2020 film adaptation was directed by Edward Hall, with Dan Stevens as Charles, Isla Fisher as Ruth, Leslie Mann as Elvira and Judi Dench as Madame Arcati. In &quot;The Guardian&quot; Peter Bradshaw gave the film one star out of a possible five: &quot;a festival of mugging and farcical overacting&quot;. &quot;The New York Times&quot; also published an unenthusiastic review: &quot;more screw-loose than screwball ... a ludicrous adaptation of Noël Coward&#x27;s 1941 stage play, reimagines its source material as little more than a slip-and-fall farce&quot;.

===Radio===
American radio adaptations were transmitted in 1944 (NBC, with Ronald Colman, Loretta Young and Edna Best), 1947 (ABC, with Clifton Webb, Leonora Corbett and Mildred Natwick), and 1952 (NBC, with John Loder and Mildred Natwick).

BBC Radio&#x27;s first adaptation was broadcast in 1954, with Michael Denison (Charles), Thelma Scott (Ruth), Dulcie Gray (Elvira) and Winifred Oughton (Madame Arcati). A second version with Denison and Gray was broadcast in 1972, with Gudrun Ure as Ruth and Sylvia Coleridge as Madame Arcati. A 1983 version featured Paul Eddington as Charles, Julia McKenzie as Ruth, Anna Massey as Elvira and Peggy Mount as Madame Arcati. The short-lived British commercial radio station Oneword presented a 2002 adaptation co-produced with and subsequently released on CD by Naxos Audio Books. The director was Sheridan Morley and the cast was led by Corin Redgrave (Charles), Kika Markham (Ruth), Joanna Lumley (Elvira) and Thelma Ruby (Madame Arcati). A 2008 BBC Radio adaptation featured Roger Allam as Charles, Hermione Gulliford as Ruth, Zoe Waites as Elvira and Maggie Steed as Madame Arcati. In December 2014 an adaptation of the play featured cast members of &quot;The Archers&quot; in a supposed amateur production.

===Television===
An American television adaptation was broadcast in 1946, with Philip Tonge as Charles, Carol Goodner as Ruth, Leonora Corbett as Elvira, Estelle Winwood as Madame Arcati and Doreen Lang reprising the role of Edith. In Britain, BBC television broadcast a production in 1948, directed by George More O&#x27;Ferrall, with Frank Lawton as Charles, Marian Spencer as Ruth, Betty Ann Davies as Elvira and Beryl Measor reprising her stage role of Madame Arcati. On 14 January 1956 Coward directed a live American television adaptation for the &quot;Ford Star Jubilee&quot; series, in which he also starred as Charles, with Claudette Colbert as Ruth, Lauren Bacall as Elvira and Mildred Natwick as Madame Arcati. A British commercial television adaptation in 1964 was directed by Joan Kemp-Welch, with Griffith Jones as Charles, Helen Cherry as Ruth, Joanna Dunham as Elvira and Hattie Jacques as Madame Arcati. Another American television TV production was presented in 1966 on &quot;Hallmark Hall of Fame&quot;, with Dirk Bogarde as Charles, Rachel Roberts as Ruth, Rosemary Harris as Elvira and Ruth Gordon as Madame Arcati.

===Musical===
The play was adapted into the musical &quot;High Spirits&quot; in 1964, with book, music and lyrics by Hugh Martin and Timothy Gray. It had a Broadway run of 375 performances, starring Edward Woodward as Charles, Louise Troy as Ruth, Tammy Grimes as Elvira and Beatrice Lillie as Madame Arcati. It had a three-month West End run in 1964–1965, with Denis Quilley as Charles, Jan Walters as Ruth, Marti Stevens as Elvira and Cicely Courtneidge as Madame Arcati.

===Novelisation===
The play was novelised by Charles Osborne in 2004.

<text>The , the J.League or the for sponsorship reasons, is the top level of the system. Founded in 1992, it is one of the most successful leagues in Asian professional club football history. Contested by 20 clubs, it operates on a system of promotion and relegation with the J2 League. It was known as the J.League from 1993 to 1998 before becoming a two-division league, and as J.League Division 1 from 1999 to 2014. Vissel Kobe successfully defended their second consecutive title in the 2024 season, after previously winning it in the 2023 season.

==History==

===Phases of J1===

====Before the professional league (1992 and earlier)====
Before the inception of the J.League, the highest level of club football was the Japan Soccer League (JSL), which was formed in 1965 and consisted of amateur clubs. Despite being well-attended during the boom of the late 1960s and early 1970s (when Japan&#x27;s national team won the bronze Olympic medal at the 1968 games in Mexico), the JSL went into decline in the 1980s, in general line with the deteriorating situation worldwide. Fans were few, the grounds were not of the highest quality, and the Japanese national team was not on a par with the Asian powerhouses. To raise the level of play domestically, to attempt to garner more fans, and to strengthen the national team, the Japan Football Association (JFA) decided to form a professional league.

The professional association football league, J.League was formed in 1992, with eight clubs drawn from the JSL First Division, one from the Second Division, and the newly formed Shimizu S-Pulse. At the same time, JSL changed its name and became the now–defunct Japan Football League, a semi-professional league. Although the J.League did not officially launch until 1993, the Yamazaki Nabisco Cup competition was held between the ten clubs in 1992 to prepare for the inaugural season.

====Inaugural season and J.League boom (1993–1995)====
J.League officially kicked off its first season with ten clubs in early 1993.

====After the boom (1996–1999)====
Despite its success in the first three years, in early 1996, the league attendance declined rapidly. In 1997, the average attendance was 10,131, compared to more than 19,000 in 1994. Notably, Arsène Wenger managed Nagoya Grampus Eight during this period.

====Change of infrastructure and game formats (1999–2004)====

By 1999, the league&#x27;s management came to a conclusion that they were heading in the wrong direction. They subsequently came up with two solutions to solve the problem.

Firsty, they announced the J.League Hundred Year Vision, in which they aimed to create or endorse 100 professional association football clubs throughout Japan by 2092, which would mark the hundredth season since the establishment of the J1 League. The league also encouraged the clubs to promote football or non-football related sports and health activities, to acquire local sponsorships, and to build good relationships with their hometowns at the grassroots level. The league administration believed that this would allow the clubs to bond with their respective cities and towns, and obtain support from local government, companies, and citizens. In other words, clubs will be able to rely on the locals, rather than major national sponsors.

Secondly, the infrastructure of the league was heavily changed in 1999. The league acquired nine clubs from the semi-professional JFL and one club from the J.League to create a two-division system. The top flight became the J.League Division 1 (J1) with 16 clubs while the J.League Division 2 (J2) was launched with ten clubs in 1999. The former second-tier Japan Football League now became the third-tier Japan Football League (J3).

Also, until 2004 (with the exception of 1996 season), the J1 season was divided into two stages. At the end of each full season, the champions from each half played a two-legged series to determine the overall season winners and runners-up. Júbilo Iwata in 2002, and Yokohama F. Marinos in 2003, won both &quot;halves&quot; of the respective seasons, thus eliminating the need for the playoff series. The league abolished the split-season system in 2005.

====European League Format &amp; AFC Champions League (2005–2008)====
Since the 2005 season, the J1 League consisted of 18 clubs (from 16 in 2004) and the season format adopted a system similar to European club football. The number of relegated clubs also increased from 2 to 2.5, with the 3rd-to-last club going into a promotion/relegation playoff with the third-placed J2 club. Since then, other than minor adjustments, the top flight has stayed consistent.

Japanese teams did not view the AFC Champions League (ACL) as a major competition in the early years, in part due to the distances travelled and teams involved. Despite this, three Japanese sides made the quarter-finals in the 2008 ACL.

However, in recent years, with the inclusion of the A-League in Eastern Asia, introduction to the Club World Cup, and increased marketability in the Asian continent, both the league and the clubs paid more attention to Asian competition. For example, Kawasaki Frontale built up a notable fan base in Hong Kong, owing to their participation in the Asian Champions League during the 2007 season. Continuous effort led to the success of Urawa Red Diamonds in 2007 and Gamba Osaka in 2008. Thanks to excellent league management and competitiveness in Asian competition, the AFC awarded J.League the highest league ranking and a total of four slots starting from the 2009 season. The league took this as an opportunity to sell TV broadcasting rights to foreign countries, especially in Asia.

Also starting from the 2008 season, the Emperor&#x27;s Cup Winner was allowed to participate in the upcoming Champions League season, rather than waiting a whole year (i.e. 2005 Emperor&#x27;s Cup winner, Tokyo Verdy, participated in the 2007 ACL season, instead of the 2006 season). In order to fix this one-year lag issue, the 2007 Emperor&#x27;s Cup winner, Kashima Antlers&#x27; turn was waived. Nonetheless, Kashima Antlers ended up participating in the 2009 ACL season by winning the J.League title in the 2008 season.

====Modern phase (2009–2016)====
Three major changes were seen starting in the 2009 season. First, starting that season, four clubs entered the AFC Champions League. Secondly, the number of relegation slots increased to three. Finally, the AFC Player slot was implemented starting this season. Each club will be allowed to have a total of four foreign players; however, one slot is reserved for a player that derives from an AFC country other than Japan. Also, as a requirement of being a member of the Asian Football Confederation, in 2012, the J.League Club Licence became one criterion of whether a club was permitted to be promoted to a higher tier in professional level leagues. No major changes happened to J.League Division 1 as the number of clubs stayed at 18.

In 2015, the J.League Division 1 was renamed J1 League. Also, the tournament format was changed to a three-stage system. The season was split into first and second stages, followed by a third and final championship stage. The third stage was composed of three to five teams. The top point accumulator in each stage and the top three point accumulators for the overall season qualified. If both of the stage winners finished in the top three teams for the season, then only three teams qualified for the championship stage. These teams then took part in a championship playoff stage to decide the winner of the league trophy.

====Current (2017–)====
Despite the new multi-stage format being initially reported as locked in for five seasons, due to negative reaction from hardcore fans and failure to appeal to casual fans, after 2016 it was abandoned in favour of a return to a single-stage system. From 2017, the team which accumulates the most points will be named champion, with no championship stage taking place at the season&#x27;s end, and from 2018, the bottom two clubs are relegated and the 16th-placed club enters a playoff with the J2 club that wins a promotion playoff series. If the J2 playoff winner prevails, the club is promoted, with the J1 club being relegated, otherwise the J1 club can retain its position in J1 League with the promotion failure of the J2 club.

In November 2017, Urawa Red Diamonds played the AFC Champions League final against Al Hilal. After a draw in the first leg, Urawa Red Diamonds won the second leg 1-0 and were crowned Asian Champions. In the past 10–15 years, Japanese clubs have risen also intercontinentally. Clubs Gamba Osaka and Urawa Red Diamonds have been crowned Asian champions and participated in the Club World Cup, always targeting at least the semi-finals. Kashima Antlers were finalists of the 2016 edition and eventually lost to Real Madrid.

Beginning in 2026–27, the J.League will use a fall–spring format. The regular season will begin in August and pause for a winter break between December and February, with the final matches played in May.

In seasons 1995–1996, were using 3 pts for any win, 1 pt for PK loss, and 0 pts for regulation or extra time loss. In seasons 1997-1998, were using 3 pts for a regulation win, 2 pts for extra-time win, 1 pt for PK win, and 0 pts for any loss. And from seasons 1999–2002, were using 3 pts for a regulation win, 2 pts for an extra time win, and 1 pt for a tie.

===Most successful clubs===
Clubs in bold compete in top flight for the 2025 season.
=== Relegation history ===
Only four clubs have never been relegated from J1. Among those, only two clubs – Kashima Antlers and Yokohama F. Marinos – have participated in every league season since its establishment in 1993. Sagan Tosu were promoted to the first division in 2012, and remain there ever since. The former J.League club Yokohama Flügels never experienced relegation before their merger with Yokohama Marinos in 1999.

JEF United Chiba holds the record for the longest top flight participation streak of 44 consecutive seasons in the first divisions of JSL and J.League that lasted from the establishment of JSL in 1965 and ended with their relegation in 2009. The longest ongoing top flight streak belongs to Yokohama F. Marinos who have played in the top flight since 1982 (44 seasons as of 2024).

;The 1998 season
When the league introduced the two-division system in 1999, they also reduced number of Division 1 clubs from 18 to 16. At the end of 1998 season, they ran the J.League Promotion Tournament to determine the two relegated clubs.

;Split-season era (1999–2004, 2015–2016)
Throughout 1999 to 2003 seasons, the two bottom clubs were relegated to Division 2. To accommodate the split-season format, combined overall standings were used to determine the relegated clubs. This created a confusing situation, where for the championship race stage standings were used, while overall standing was used for relegation survival.

At end of the 2004 season, Division 1 again expanded from 16 to 18 clubs. No clubs were relegated; however, the last-placed (16th) club had to play the Promotion/Relegation Series against the 3rd placed club from J2. Again, to determine the 16th placed club, the overall standing was used instead of stage standings.

For two seasons starting in 2015, the three bottom clubs were relegated based on overall standings.

;Single season era (2005–2014, 2017–2019, 2022–present)
For the next four seasons, 2005 to 2008, the number of relegating clubs was increased to 2.5, with two clubs from each division being promoted and relegated directly, and two more (15th in J1 and 3rd in J2) competing in the Promotion/Relegation Series.

In 2009, the promotion/relegation series was abandoned and three teams were directly exchanged between divisions. In 2012, promotion playoffs were introduced in J2, allowing teams that finished from 3rd to 6th to compete for the last J1 promotion place. For the 2018, 2019 and 2022 seasons, the bottom two teams are relegated and the entry playoff has the 16th team play the J2 playoff winner.

;Single season era (2021)
No teams descended to J2 after the 2020 season due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan and its effects. Instead, four relegations were in place for the 2021 season to bring back the number of teams from 20 to 18.

<doc id="448904" wikidata="Q162058" url="?curid=448904" title="Coat of arms of Albania">
<text>The coat of arms of Albania (Albanian: Stema e Republikës së Shqipërisë) is an adaptation of the flag of Albania and is based on the symbols of Gjergj Kastrioti Skanderbeg. It features the black double-headed eagle, documented in official use since 1458, as evidenced from a sealed document uncovered in the Vatican Secret Archive (fund: Miscellanea, vol. XXXIX, doc. 2398), addressed to Pope Pius II and co-sealed by notary Johannes Borcius de Grillis. 
The stylized gold helmet is partially based on the model of crown-like rank that once belonged to Skanderbeg, currently on display at the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna, first mentioned in 1593 in the Ambras armory inventory and depicted in 1601/03 in the &quot;Armamentarium Heroicum&quot; of Jakob Schrenck von Notzing. The ruler of Austria, Ferdinand II, acquired the helmet from the Duke of Urbino, so mentioned in a letter sent to him from the duke, dated 15 October 1578.

The helmet as an integral component in the coat of arms was instituted for the first time by the president of the republic Ahmet Zogu on 12 July 1926.

==Official regulation==
The coat of arms of the Republic is described in Article 14 of the Constitution of Albania:

The design is further specified in articles VII and VIII of Law 8926:
==Expanded usage==
The expanded usage of the coat of arms of the Republic is explained by decision no. 474 of the Council of Ministers, dated 10 July 2003.

The usage of the coat of arms of the Republic, is later included in the Official Ceremonial (), approved by decision no. 229, dated 23 April 2004 which states:

==Significance of the helmet==

Skanderbeg&#x27;s helmet is mentioned, along with two swords, in the inventory of the Ambras Castle armory in 1593, inherited by Archduke Ferdinand II and in the catalogue known as &#x27;Armamentarium Heroicum&#x27; published in 1601 by Jakob Schrenk von Notzing. From one of 125 portraits of European princes in plates engraved by Dominicus Custos, after designs by Giovanni Battista Fontana, Skanderbeg is shown with the helmet and a sword. The plates were accompanied with a text by Schrenk von Notzing giving a brief profile of the subject. Archduke Ferdinand had himself led a campaign against the Ottomans in Hungary in 1556 at the behest of his father, Holy Roman Emperor Ferdinand I, so it was not perhaps surprising that he would want to include the arms of Skanderbeg in his collection.

In 1605, Ambras Castle was sold to the Austrian Emperor, and in 1806 the arms were transferred to Belvedere Palace and then finally, in 1888, to the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna. In recent years, the arms have been the subject of study by the museum&#x27;s curator, Matthias Pfaffenbichler.

The iron forged helmet is likely of Italian origin, thought to have been made around 1460. The lower part of the helmet and the neck protection are missing and cracks in the base have been covered by a sewn leather band under which are traces of the original silk. A copper band with gold plated border is adorned with six rosettes, most of which are 16th century restorations, though the one at the back dates to the 15th century. Between the rosettes, an inscription in a particular type of Gothic minuscule on a hatched ground reads ‘in/per/ra/to/re/bt’.

Skënder Anamali, an archaeologist and scholar on medieval history, has proposed that the decorative band with the inscription and the rosettes were added by Skanderbeg&#x27;s descendants. The initials of the inscription are usually rendered as &quot;Jezus Nazarenus /Principi Emathie /Regi Albaniae * Terrori Osmanorum * Regi Epirotarum * Benedictat Te&quot; which translate as Jesus of Nazareth Blesses Thee Prince of Emathia, King (or Kingdom) of Albania, Terror of the Ottomans, King (or Kingdom) of Epirus. Such titles, however, were not used during Skanderbeg&#x27;s lifetime.

Pfaffenbichler&#x27;s close inspection of the inscription confirms the view that it was added to the helmet after Skanderbeg&#x27;s lifetime. The transverse part of the letter ‘t’ is from a calligraphic font called Fraktur, developed by Wolfgang Spitzberg, the scribe of the Chancellery, and used for the first time around 1500. Fraktur only appeared in wider use from 1517, about 50 years after the death of Skanderbeg. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that the decorative band with its inscription are not original – though one of the rosettes dating to the 15th century may possibly have been a replacement of an original fitting.

The helmet is distinguished for its goat&#x27;s head crest. There are a number of theories explaining the association of the goat&#x27;s head with Skanderbeg. One such theory is that it relates to the rams’ horns, a symbol of Zeus Ammon, worn by Alexander the Great, who was Epirote by descent from his mother Olympias. The famed King of Epirus, Pyrrhus, also wore a helmet that had, according to Plutarch, a &quot;towering crest and … goat&#x27;s horns&quot;.

The goat&#x27;s head is partially hammered in copper, engraved and gold plated. The eye sockets that today are empty would have been inlaid. The shape of the crest hole on top of the helmet does not precisely mold into the shape needed for the goat&#x27;s head crest so the two parts may have not originally gone together.

<doc id="448905" wikidata="Q5098585" url="?curid=448905" title="Children of the plantation">
<text>&quot;Children of the plantation&quot; is a euphemism used to refer to people with ancestry tracing back to the time of slavery in the United States in which the offspring was born to black African female slaves (either still in the state of slavery or freed) in the context of the trans-Atlantic slave trade and Non-Black men, usually the slave&#x27;s owner, one of the owner&#x27;s relatives, or the plantation overseer. These children were often considered to be the property of the slave owner and were often subjected to the same treatment as other slaves on the plantation. Many of these children were born into slavery and had no legal rights, as they were not recognized as the legitimate children of their fathers. The men who fathered these children often used their power and authority to rape the black females (girls and/or women) (often 13 to 16 years old or when they commenced menstruation) who were under their control.

Plantation owners raping female slaves was a common occurrence. These children were born into slavery, through a legal doctrine known as &quot;partus sequitur ventrem&quot;. They were classified as mulattoes, a former term for a multiracial person. Some of the fathers treated these children comparatively well, sometimes providing educational or career opportunities, or manumitting (freeing) them. Examples are Archibald and Francis Grimké, and Thomas Jefferson&#x27;s children by Sally Hemings. Others treated their multiracial children as property; Alexander Scott Withers, for instance, sold two of his children to slave traders, where they were sold again.

Alex Haley&#x27;s &quot;&quot; (1993) is a historical novel, later a movie, that brought knowledge of the &quot;children of the plantation&quot; to public attention. Edward Ball&#x27;s &quot;Slaves in the Family&quot; (1998), written by a White descendant of slave owners, describes this complex legacy. Toni Morrison wrote that this sexual usage of slaves was known as &quot;droit du seigneur&quot;, the &quot;right of the lord&quot;, a term originating in the feudalism of medieval Europe.

<doc id="448906" wikidata="Q2562744" url="?curid=448906" title="Green wall">
<text>A green wall is a vertical built structure intentionally covered by vegetation. Green walls include a vertically applied growth medium such as soil, substitute substrate, or hydroculture felt; as well as an integrated hydration and fertigation delivery system. They are also referred to as living walls or vertical gardens, and widely associated with the delivery of many beneficial ecosystem services.

Green walls differ from the more established vertical greening typology of &#x27;green facades&#x27; as they have the growth medium supported on the vertical face of the host wall (as described below), while green facades have the growth medium only at the base (either in a container or as a ground bed). Green facades typically support climbing plants that climb up the vertical face of the host wall, while green walls can accommodate a variety of plant species. Green walls may be implanted indoors or outdoors; as freestanding installations or attached to existing host walls; and applied in a variety of sizes.

Stanley Hart White, a Professor of Landscape Architecture at the University of Illinois from 1922 to 1959, patented a &#x27;vegetation-Bearing Architectonic Structure and System&#x27; in 1938, though his invention did not progress beyond prototypes in his backyard in Urbana, Illinois. The popularising of green walls is often credited to Patrick Blanc, a French botanist specialised in tropical forest undergrowth. He worked with architect Adrien Fainsilber and engineer Peter Rice to implement the first successful large indoor green wall or &quot;Mur Vegetal&quot; in 1986 at the Cité des Sciences et de l&#x27;Industrie in Paris, and has since been involved with the design and implementation of a number of notable installations (e.g. Musée du quai Branly, collaborating with architect Jean Nouvel).

Green walls have seen a surge in popularity in recent times. An online database provided by greenroof.com for example had reported 80% of the 61 large-scale outdoor green walls listed as constructed after 2009, with 93% after 2007.
Many notable green walls have been installed at institutional buildings and public places, with both outdoor and indoor installations gaining significant attention. As of 2015, the largest green wall is said to cover 2,700 square meters (29,063 square feet) and is located at the Los Cabos International Convention Centre designed by Mexican architect Fernando Romero.

==Media types==
Green walls are often constructed of modular panels that hold a growing medium and can be categorized according to the type of growth media used: loose media, mat media, and structural media.

===Media-free===
Media-free green walls are those that do not require soil substrates, fertilizers, or reticulated watering systems, and which utilize a method of selecting plant species which are best suited to the local climate. Media-free green walls often use a structural steel frame that is infilled with wire mesh, which is then attached to the façade of the structure, and plants are individually attached to this wire mesh. These frames are offset from the supporting structure to allow airflow between the green wall and the supporting structure, and this offset results in additional cooling to the adjoining building.

These media-free systems result in green walls which are considerably lighter than other methods, and also require significantly less maintenance, while the risk of liquid migration into adjoining structural walls is eliminated. The plant species which can be used in media-free systems varies depending on the location of the planned green wall. Xeric plants, such as Tillandsias, can be used because they absorb available atmospheric water and nutrients via trichome leaf cells, and their roots have developed to hold onto a support structure, unlike other plants which use their roots as a medium to absorb nutrients. The other benefit of Tillandsias within a media-free system is that these plants use a crassulacean acid metabolism to photosynthesize, and they have evolved to withstand long periods of heat and drought, and as a result, these plants grow slowly and require minimal maintenance.

Every three-to-five-years, any additional plant growth can be harvested to reduce weight, and these plant pups can be utilized for additional green walls. As long as suitable species are matched to the climate of the green wall&#x27;s location, then potential plant losses across any three-to-five-year period is minor. As there is no watering system involved this method eliminates potential mold, algae and moss problems that can plague other systems. Because of the lack of media and water, these screens can also be installed horizontally, and the first of these screens ever installed was for a 2023 installation on the rooftop of the City of Melbourne&#x27;s Council House 2 building.

===Freestanding media===
Freestanding media are portable living walls that are flexible for interior landscaping and are considered to have many biophilic design benefits. Zauben living walls are designed with hydroponic technology that conserves 75% more water than plants grown in soil, self-irrigates, and includes moisture sensors.

===Loose media===
Loose medium walls tend to be &quot;soil-on-a-shelf&quot; or &quot;soil-in-a-bag&quot; type systems. Loose medium systems have their soil packed into a shelf or bag and are then installed onto the wall. These systems require their media to be replaced at least once a year on exteriors and approximately every two years on interiors.

Loose soil systems are not well suited for areas with any seismic activity. Most importantly, because these systems can easily have their medium blown away by wind-driven rain or heavy winds, these should not be used in applications over high. There are some systems in Asia that have solved the loose media erosion problem by use of shielding systems to hold the media within the green wall system even when soil liquefaction occurs under seismic load. In these systems, the plants can still up-root themselves in the liquified soil under seismic load, and therefore it is required that the plants be secured to the system to prevent them from falling from the wall.

Loose-soil systems without physical media erosion systems are best suited for the home gardener where occasional replanting is desired from season to season or year to year. Loose-soil systems with physical media erosion systems are well suited for all green wall applications.

===Mat media===

Mat type systems tend to be either coir fiber or felt mats. Mat media are quite thin, even in multiple layers, and as such cannot support vibrant root systems of mature plants for more than three to five years before the roots overtake the mat and water is not able to adequately wick through the mats.

The method of reparation of these systems is to replace large sections of the system at a time by cutting the mat out of the wall and replacing it with new mat. This process compromises the root structures of the neighboring plants on the wall and often kills many surrounding plants in the reparation process.

These systems are best used on the interior of a building and are a good choice in areas with low seismic activity and small plants that will not grow to a weight that could rip the mat apart under their own weight over time.

Mat systems are particularly water inefficient and often require constant irrigation due to the thin nature of the medium and its inability to hold water and provide a buffer for the plant roots. This inefficiency often requires that these systems have a water re-circulation system put into place at an additional cost. Mat media are better suited for small installations no more than eight feet in height where repairs are easily completed.

=== Sheet media ===
Semi-open cell polyurethane sheet media utilising an egg crate pattern has successfully been used in recent years for both outdoor roof gardens and vertical walls. The water holding capacity of these engineered polyurethanes vastly exceeds that of coir and felt based systems. Polyurethanes do not biodegrade, and hence stay viable as an active substrate for 20+ years. Vertical wall systems utilising polyurethane sheeting typically employ a sandwich construction where a water proof membrane is applied to the back, the polyurethane sheeting (typically two sheets with irrigation lines in between) is laid and then a mesh or anchor braces/bars secure the assembly to the wall. Pockets are cut into the face of the first urethane sheet into which plants are inserted. Soil is typically removed from the roots of any plants prior to insertion into the urethane mattress substrate. A flaked or chopped noodle version of the same polyurethane material can also be added to existing structural media mixes to boost water retention.

===Structural media===

Structural media are growth medium &quot;blocks&quot; that are not loose, nor mats, but which incorporate the best features of both into a block that can be manufactured into various sizes, shapes and thicknesses. These media have the advantage that they do not break down for 10 to 15 years, can be made to have a higher or lower water holding capacity depending on the plant selection for the wall, can have their pH and EC&#x27;s customized to suit the plants, and are easily handled for maintenance and replacement.

There is also some discussion involving &quot;active&quot; living walls. An active living wall actively pulls or forces air through the plants le quality to the point that the installation of other air quality filtration systems can be removed to provide a cost-savings. Therefore, the added cost of design, planning and implementation of an active living wall is still in question. With further research and UL standards to support the air quality data from the living wall, building code may one day allow for our buildings to have their air filtered by plants.

The area of air quality and plants is continuing to be researched. Early studies in this area include NASA studies performed in the 1970s and 1980s by B. C. Wolverton. There was also a study performed at the University of Guelph by Alan Darlington. Other research has shown the effect the plants have on the health of office workers.

==Function==

Green walls are found most often in urban environments where the plants reduce overall temperatures of the building. &quot;The primary cause of heat build-up in cities is insolation, the absorption of solar radiation by roads and buildings in the city and the storage of this heat in the building material and its subsequent re-radiation. Plant surfaces however, as a result of transpiration, do not rise more than 4–5 °C above the ambient and are sometimes cooler.&quot;

Living walls could function as urban agriculture, urban gardening, or provide aesthetic enhancement as art installations. They are particularly suitable for cities, as they allow good use of available vertical surface areas. They are also suitable in arid areas, as the circulating water on a vertical wall is less likely to evaporate than in horizontal gardens. It is sometimes built indoors to help alleviate sick building syndrome. Living walls are also acknowledged for remediation of poor air quality, in both internal and external environments.

Water management

Living walls may also be a means for water reuse and management. The plants purify slightly polluted water (such as greywater) by absorbing the dissolved nutrients. Bacteria mineralize the organic components to make them available to the plants. A study is underway at the Bertschi School in Seattle, Washington, using a GSky Pro Wall system, however, no publicly available data on this is available at this time.

Phytoremediation and air quality improvement
Green walls provide an additional layer of insulation that can protect buildings from heavy rainwater which leads to management of heavy storm water and provides thermal mass. They also help reduce the temperature of a building because vegetation absorbs large amounts of solar radiation. This can reduce energy demands and cleanse the air from VOC’s (Volatile Organic Compounds) released by paints, furniture, and adhesives. Off-gassing from VOCs can cause headaches, eye irritation, and airway irritation and internal air pollution. Green walls can also purify the air from mould growth in building interiors that can cause asthma and allergies.

Indoor green walls can have a therapeutic effect from exposure to vegetation. The aesthetic feel and visual appearance of green walls are other examples of the benefits - but also affects the indoor climate with reduced CO2 level, noise level and air pollution abatement. However, to have the optimal effect on the indoor climate it is important that the plants in the green wall have the best conditions for growth, both when talking about watering, fertilizing and the right amount of light. To have the best result on all of the aforementioned, some green wall systems has special and patented technologies that is developed to the benefit of the plants.

Thomas Pugh, a biogeochemist at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology in Germany, created a computer model of a green wall with a broad selection of vegetation. The study showed results of the green wall absorbing nitrogen dioxide and particulate matter. In street canyons where polluted air is trapped, green walls can absorb the polluted air and purify the streets.

Biodiversity enhancement

Traditional green facades are best characterised as ‘Xerothermophilous’ habitats comparable to cliffs, while continuous felt and modular substrate-filled living wall types are best characterised as damp and cool habitats comparable to vegetated waterfalls. Systems with increased substrate depth are typically found to offer the highest diversity and abundance of species. Biodiversity at indoor applications in contrast is likely to be significantly limited owing to the restricted ecosystems created, with introductions most likely at planting or replanting stages.

<doc id="448908" wikidata="Q5302807" url="?curid=448908" title="Down East">
<text>&quot;Down East&quot; or &quot;Downeast&quot; is a term for parts of eastern coastal New England and Canada, particularly the U.S. state of Maine and Canada&#x27;s Maritime Provinces, an area that closely corresponds to the historical French territory of Acadia. The phrase apparently derives from sailing terminology: sailors from western ports sailed downwind toward the east to reach the area.

A person from this area may be called a &quot;down-easter.&quot; Within Maine, the phrase may refer specifically to the state&#x27;s easternmost regions, also called Downeast Maine.

The Downeast Maine National Heritage Area was established in the National Heritage Area Act in 2022. The National Heritage Area will help preserve more historic and cultural sites in Hancock and Washington counties.

==Etymology==
The origin of the phrase &quot;Downeast&quot; is typically traced to nautical terminology referring to direction, rather than location. In the warm months most suitable for sailing, the prevailing winds along the coast of New England and Canada blow from the southwest, meaning ships sail downwind to go east. As such, the northeastern stretches were said to be &quot;Downeast&quot; in relation to major western cities such as Boston. Correspondingly, sailors spoke of going &quot;up to Boston&quot; from Downeast ports, a phrase still common in Maine, despite the fact that Boston is around fifty miles to the south of Maine. The term can be used as an adverb, adjective, or noun. The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; traces the earliest known use in print to 1825. The phrase &quot;down-easter&quot;, meaning a person from &quot;Downeast&quot;, appeared in print in 1828.

==Uses==
The phrase &quot;Downeast&quot; is used in several ways. Most broadly, it refers to areas from northeastern New England into Canada&#x27;s Maritime Provinces. Sargent F. Collier wrote that Downeast extended from Maine into Canada as far as Chaleur Bay. This area is similar to the boundaries of the historical French colony of Acadia; Collier regarded this as a cultural legacy of the former colony. According to Maine author John Gould, Downeast is &quot;a never-never land always east of where you are&quot;. The term is relational, with Boston being the traditional referent for determining what is &quot;Downeast&quot;. As such, sailors going from one port in Maine to another nearby may have said they were going &quot;down Maine&quot; or &quot;east&#x27;ard&quot;, reserving &quot;Downeast&quot; for farther points.

Within New England, &quot;Downeast&quot; often refers specifically to Maine, especially the coastal areas. The phrase has widespread use in the state; Maine&#x27;s largest monthly magazine is titled &quot;Down East&quot;. Amtrak named its passenger train service between Boston and Brunswick, Maine the &quot;Downeaster&quot;. The term &quot;Downeast&quot; provided the name for a prominent type of sailing ship developed in Maine in the later 19th century, the Downeaster. Downeasters were a modification of the earlier clipper, with new lines and rigging enabling it to carry substantially more cargo. Primarily used to transport wheat and other goods from California to European markets, Downeasters were characteristically built in Maine, and their captains often came from the state. A significant part of Maine&#x27;s maritime legacy, they were among the last prominent sailing ships built before steamships came to dominate the industry. While steamships may have supplanted sailing ships in some contexts, this prominence just before the decline led Maine boatbuilders to remain in demand for sailing yachts and motor yachts; a common modern design influenced by coastal Maine&#x27;s ubiquitous lobster boats is made by several manufacturers under names resembling &#x27;Downeaster&#x27;.

In Maine, &quot;Downeast&quot; may refer more narrowly to the easternmost section of the state along the Canada–US border. This area, also known as &quot;Downeast Maine&quot; or &quot;Downeast Maine&quot;, lies on the coast roughly between the Penobscot River and the border, including rural Hancock and Washington counties and the towns of Deer Isle, Bar Harbor, Machias, Jonesport, and Eastport. This was among the last parts of the state settled by Europeans. Due to its thankless climate it saw little settlement by the French, and British colonists arrived only after French control ended in 1763. Initially attracted by the availability of land for farming, the early British settlers soon turned to fishing to survive; fishing remains a significant economic driver. Largely due to its inhospitable climate and remoteness, Downeast Maine remained one of the state&#x27;s least developed areas throughout the 20th century. In more recent years, Downeast Maine and the Greater Portland area have emerged as an important center for the creative economy, which is also bringing gentrification.

In Canada, &quot;Down East&quot;, often written as two words, refers to the Maritime Provinces: New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and Prince Edward Island. Newfoundland and the Gaspé Peninsula of Quebec are sometimes included. The term gave its name to Down East fiddling, which developed in the Maritimes and has become one of the most prominent styles of Canadian fiddling. The style is closely associated with New Brunswick native Don Messer, who hosted a radio show on Prince Edward Island beginning in 1939 and had a wide influence over fiddle music in Canada. The Down East style is distinguished by simple playing and dance-ready rhythms. In Thunder Bay and Northwestern Ontario, &quot;down east&quot; refers to southern Ontario.

<text>The year 1759 in science and technology involved several significant events.

==Astronomy==
* Halley&#x27;s Comet returns; a team of three mathematicians, Alexis Clairaut, Jérome Lalande and Nicole Reine Lepaute, have – for the first time – predicted the date.

==Biology==
* Caspar Friedrich Wolff&#x27;s dissertation at the University of Halle &quot;Theoria Generationis&quot; supports the theory of epigenesis.

==Botany==
* Kew Gardens established in England by Augusta of Saxe-Coburg, the mother of George III.

==Geology==
* Giovanni Arduino proposes dividing the geological history of Earth into four periods: Primitive, Secondary, Tertiary and Volcanic, or Quaternary.

==Medicine==
* June 15 – The first vascular surgery in history is performed by a Dr. Hallowell at Newcastle upon Tyne in England, who uses suture repair rather than a tying off with a ligature to repair an aneurysm on a patient&#x27;s brachial artery. The new procedure of reconstructing a damaged artery replaces the practice of ligation that had risked the amputation of a limb or organ failure. 
* Angélique du Coudray publishes &quot;Abrégé de l&#x27;art des accouchements&quot; (&quot;The Art of Obstetrics&quot;).

==Physics==
* Posthumous publication of Émilie du Châtelet&#x27;s French translation and commentary on Newton&#x27;s &quot;Principia&quot;, &quot;Principes mathématiques de la philosophie naturelle&quot;.

==Technology==
* English clockmaker John Harrison produces his &quot;No. 1 sea watch&quot; (&quot;H4&quot;), the first successful marine chronometer.

==Transport==
* James Brindley is engaged by the Duke of Bridgewater to construct a canal to transport coal to Manchester from the duke&#x27;s mines at Worsley, in North West England.
* October 16 – Smeaton&#x27;s Tower, John Smeaton&#x27;s Eddystone Lighthouse off the coast of South West England, is first illuminated.

==Awards==
* Copley Medal: John Smeaton

==Births==
* January 29 – Louis Augustin Guillaume Bosc, French botanist (died 1828) 
* July 19 – Jacques Anselme Dorthès, French physician, entomologist and naturalist (died 1794)
* August 12 – Thomas Andrew Knight, English horticulturalist (died 1838)
* September 19 – William Kirby, English entomologist (died 1850)
* December 2 – James Edward Smith, English botanist (died 1828)
* Date unknown – Maria Petraccini, Italian anatomist and physician (died 1791)

==Deaths==
* February 16 – Bartholomew Mosse, Irish surgeon (born 1712)
* April 6 – Johann Gottfried Zinn, German anatomist and botanist (born 1727)
* July 27 – Pierre Louis Maupertuis, French mathematician (born 1698)

<text>The year 1758 in [[science]] and technology involved some significant events.

==Astronomy==
* December 25 – Halley&#x27;s Comet is sighted by Johann Georg Palitzsch, confirming Edmund Halley&#x27;s 1705 prediction of its periodicity.

==Chemistry==
* John Champion patents a process for calcining zinc sulphide into an oxide usable in the retort process.

==Medicine==
* French midife Angélique du Coudray demonstrates the first obstetric mannequin.
* Scottish physician Francis Home makes the first attempt to deliver a measles vaccine.

==Physics==
* Ruđer Bošković publishes his atomic theory in &quot;Philosophiæ naturalis theoria redacta ad unicam legem virium in natura existentium&quot; (&quot;Theory of natural philosophy reduced to one law of the forces existing in nature&quot;).
* John Dolland presents his &quot;Account of some experiments concerning the different refrangibility of light&quot; (&quot;Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society&quot; (London)) describing the discovery of a means of constructing doublet achromatic lenses by the combination of crown and flint glasses, reducing chromatic aberration.

==Zoology==
* January 1 – Swedish biologist Carl Linnaeus (Carl von Linné) publishes in Stockholm the first volume (&quot;Animalia&quot;) of the 10th edition of &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;, the starting point of modern zoological nomenclature, introducing binomial nomenclature for animals to his established system of Linnaean taxonomy. Among the first examples of his system of identifying an organism by genus and then species, Linnaeus identifies the lamprey with the name &quot;Petromyzon marinus&quot;. He introduces the term &quot;Homo sapiens&quot;. (Date of January 1 assigned retrospectively.)

==Awards==
* Copley Medal: John Dollond

<text>Hans-Jürgen P. Walter (born 25 March 1944 in Gladenbach-Weidenhausen, Germany) is a German psychologist and psychotherapist known as one of the main founders of Gestalt Theoretical Psychotherapy. Walter studied psychology with the German Gestalt psychologists Edwin Rausch and Friedrich Hoeth, eminent representatives of the second and third generation of Gestalt theory in Germany. Gestalt Theoretical Psychotherapy GTP spread as a psychotherapeutic method in the German-speaking countries, being officially accredited as an independent scientific psychotherapy method in Austria.

==Life and study==
Between 1965 and 1971 Hans-Jürgen Walter studied psychology and German studies in Marburg and Frankfurt, Germany. In 1977 he earned his doctorate in Darmstadt with a thesis on &quot;Die Gestalttheorie als wissenschaftliche Grundlage psychotherapeutischer Praxis und ihre Beziehung zu psychotherapeutischen Ansaetzen der Gegenwart&quot; (&quot;The Gestalt theory as a scientific base for psychotherapy practice and its relation to contemporary approaches in psychotherapy&quot;). This thesis shows that Gestalt theory can provide an appropriate framework to integrate the methods and merits of many other psychotherapeutic schools, especially the analytic and the humanistic ones. This work has appeared in 1994 in its third and enlarged edition under the title &quot;Gestalt Theorie und Psychotherapy. Zur integrativen Anwendung zeitgenoessischer Therapieformen&quot; (&quot;Gestalt Theory and Psychotherapy: an integrative approach to contemporary forms of psychotherapy&quot;). It is considered the first basic text for Gestalt Theoretical Psychotherapy in its contemporary form.

Walter held a teaching position for Gestalt Theoretical Psychotherapy at the University of Vienna and at several psychotherapy institutes in Germany and Austria. In 1999 he was appointed honorary chairman of the international &quot;Society for Gestalt Theory and its Applications&quot; (GTA). He has been one of the editors of the international multidisciplinary journal &quot;Gestalt Theory&quot; (Sciendo, De Gruyter), and is now a member of its &quot;Founders and Honorary Board&quot;.

==History==
Many years of intensive pursuit of theoretical and practical evaluation of several psychotherapeutical approaches preceded Walter&#x27;s formation and development of Gestalt Theoretical Psychotherapy. Before him, other well-known representatives of Gestalt psychology of the Berlin school, especially in the U.S.A. (for example Erwin Levy, Abraham S. Luchins, Erika Oppenheimer-Fromm, Molly Harrower, Junius F. Brown and other students of Kurt Lewin) had stated their opinions and elaborated theoretically and practically on applying Gestalt theory to psychotherapeutic problems. Walter, however, earned recognition for being the first to generally, originally and stringently use the theoretical and practical possibilities of Gestalt theory to formulate a consistent and encompassing Gestalt theoretical approach to psychotherapy. In addition to this, he also argued that it was possible to use Gestalt theoretical principles in order to develop and extend the Gestalt therapy of Fritz Perls, which Gestalt Theoretical Psychotherapy is related, but not identical, to.

One of the most striking characteristics of Gestalt Theoretical Psychotherapy is the key role of the epistemological grounding position of Gestalt theory (&quot;critical realism&quot;) and its consideration in all fundamental, theoretical and practical problems in psychotherapy. In Gestalt Theoretical Psychotherapy this is closely bound up with the basic methodological approach (holistic, phenomenological, experimental) of Gestalt theory, its system theoretical approach, its specific psychophysical and psychological approach. Walter has started to bring all of these approaches together, as well as the long and rich tradition of Gestalt theoretical experimental research.

<text>In field theory, the primitive element theorem states that every finite separable field extension is simple, i.e. generated by a single element. This theorem implies in particular that all algebraic number fields over the rational numbers, and all extensions in which both fields are finite, are simple.

== Terminology ==
Let formula_1 be a &quot;field extension&quot;. An element formula_2 is a &quot;primitive element&quot; for formula_1 if formula_4 i.e. if every element of formula_5 can be written as a rational function in formula_6 with coefficients in formula_7. If there exists such a primitive element, then formula_1 is referred to as a &quot;simple extension&quot;. 

If the field extension formula_1 has primitive element formula_6 and is of finite degree formula_11, then every element formula_12 can be written in the form

:formula_13

for unique coefficients formula_14. That is, the set

:formula_15

is a basis for &quot;E&quot; as a vector space over &quot;F&quot;. The degree &quot;n&quot; is equal to the degree of the irreducible polynomial of &quot;α&quot; over &quot;F&quot;, the unique monic formula_16 of minimal degree with &quot;α&quot; as a root (a linear dependency of formula_17).

If &quot;L&quot; is a splitting field of formula_18 containing its &quot;n&quot; distinct roots formula_19, then there are &quot;n&quot; field embeddings formula_20 defined by formula_21 and formula_22 for formula_23, and these extend to automorphisms of &quot;L&quot; in the Galois group, formula_24. Indeed, for an extension field with formula_25, an element formula_6 is a primitive element if and only if formula_6 has &quot;n&quot; distinct conjugates formula_28 in some splitting field formula_29.

== Example ==
If one adjoins to the rational numbers formula_30 the two irrational numbers formula_31 and formula_32 to get the extension field formula_33 of degree 4, one can show this extension is simple, meaning formula_34 for a single formula_2. Taking formula_36, the powers 1, &quot;α&quot;, &quot;α&quot;2, &quot;α&quot;3 can be expanded as linear combinations of 1, formula_31, formula_32, formula_39 with integer coefficients. One can solve this system of linear equations for formula_31 and formula_32 over formula_42, to obtain formula_43 and formula_44. This shows that &quot;α&quot; is indeed a primitive element: 
:formula_45
One may also use the following more general argument. The field formula_46 clearly has four field automorphisms formula_47 defined by formula_48 and formula_49 for each choice of signs. The minimal polynomial formula_50 of formula_51 must have formula_52, so formula_53 must have at least four distinct roots formula_54. Thus formula_53 has degree at least four, and formula_56, but this is the degree of the entire field, formula_57, so formula_58.

== Theorem statement ==
The primitive element theorem states: 
:Every separable field extension of finite degree is simple.

This theorem applies to algebraic number fields, i.e. finite extensions of the rational numbers Q, since Q has characteristic 0 and therefore every finite extension over Q is separable.

Using the fundamental theorem of Galois theory, the former theorem immediately follows from Steinitz&#x27;s theorem.

== Characteristic &quot;p&quot; ==
For a non-separable extension formula_1 of characteristic p, there is nevertheless a primitive element provided the degree [&quot;E&quot; : &quot;F&quot;] is &quot;p:&quot; indeed, there can be no non-trivial intermediate subfields since their degrees would be factors of the prime &quot;p&quot;.

When [&quot;E&quot; : &quot;F&quot;] = &quot;p&quot;2, there may not be a primitive element (in which case there are infinitely many intermediate fields by Steinitz&#x27;s theorem). The simplest example is formula_60, the field of rational functions in two indeterminates &quot;T&quot; and &quot;U&quot; over the finite field with &quot;p&quot; elements, and formula_61. In fact, for any formula_62 in formula_63, the Frobenius endomorphism shows that the element formula_64 lies in &quot;F&quot; , so &quot;α&quot; is a root of formula_65, and &quot;α&quot; cannot be a primitive element (of degree &quot;p&quot;2 over &quot;F&quot;), but instead &quot;F&quot;(&quot;α&quot;) is a non-trivial intermediate field.

== Proof ==
Suppose first that formula_7 is infinite. By induction, it suffices to prove that any finite extension formula_67 is simple. For formula_68, suppose formula_69 fails to be a primitive element, formula_70. Then formula_71, since otherwise formula_72. Consider the minimal polynomials of formula_73 over formula_74, respectively formula_75, and take a splitting field formula_76 containing all roots formula_77 of formula_53 and formula_79 of formula_80. Since formula_71, there is another root formula_82, and a field automorphism formula_83 which fixes formula_84 and takes formula_85. We then have formula_86, and:
:formula_87, and therefore formula_88.
Since there are only finitely many possibilities for formula_89 and formula_90, only finitely many formula_68 fail to give a primitive element formula_92. All other values give formula_93.

For the case where formula_7 is finite, we simply take formula_6 to be a primitive root of the finite extension field formula_96.

== History ==
In his First Memoir of 1831, published in 1846, Évariste Galois sketched a proof of the classical primitive element theorem in the case of a splitting field of a polynomial over the rational numbers. The gaps in his sketch could easily be filled (as remarked by the referee Poisson) by exploiting a theorem of Lagrange from 1771, which Galois certainly knew. It is likely that Lagrange had already been aware of the primitive element theorem for splitting fields. Galois then used this theorem heavily in his development of the Galois group. Since then it has been used in the development of Galois theory and the fundamental theorem of Galois theory. 

The primitive element theorem was proved in its modern form by Ernst Steinitz, in an influential article on field theory in 1910, which also contains Steinitz&#x27;s theorem; Steinitz called the &quot;classical&quot; result &quot;Theorem of the primitive elements&quot; and his modern version &quot;Theorem of the intermediate fields&quot;. 

Emil Artin reformulated Galois theory in the 1930s without relying on primitive elements.

<text>Pascal Salin (born May 16, 1939) is a French economist, professor &quot;emeritus&quot; at the Université Paris-Dauphine and a specialist in public finance and monetary economics. He is a former president of the Mont Pelerin Society (1994 to 1996).

== Biography ==
After undergraduate studies in law at the University of Bordeaux, Salin studied economics in Paris and graduated from the Instituts d&#x27;études politiques. While graduating in sociology with a &quot;licence&quot;, he started a doctorate in economics and obtained his &quot;agrégation d&#x27;économie&quot;. At the age of 22, he lectured in economics at the universities of Paris, Poitiers, and Nantes. In 1970, he became University Professor at the Université Paris-Dauphine where he stayed until his retirement in 2009. At Dauphine he co-founded the &quot;Jean-Baptiste Say research center in economics&quot;.

Salin has been a consultant for the International Monetary Fund, the United Nations, the Food and Agriculture Organization, and the Harvard Institute for International Development. He is a frequent contributor to the French newspapers &quot;Le Figaro&quot; and &quot;Les Echos&quot;. He has published several articles in many other French media outlets such as &quot;Le Monde&quot;. He also publishes in the &quot;Wall Street Journal Europe&quot;. Mathieu Laine and Jörg Guido Hülsmann co-edited a &quot;festschrift&quot; in honor of Salin in 2006. He was made &quot;Chevalier de la Légion d&#x27;honneur&quot; and &quot;Chevalier des Arts et des Lettres&quot;, as well as &quot;Officier des Palmes Académiques&quot;. He was awarded the &quot;Prix renaissance de l&#x27;économie&quot; in 1986.

==Work==

In the 1960s and 1970s, Salin was influenced by Milton Friedman and monetarism, Jacques Rueff and his view of the international monetary order, as well as Harry Gordon Johnson and his monetary approach to the balance of payments. Robert Mundell&#x27;s work also played a part in Salin&#x27;s own approach to economics, especially regarding the topics of supply-side economics and optimum currency areas. Salin aided in awarding Mundell the degree of Doctor Honoris Causa from the Université de Paris-Dauphine in 1992. Salin and his colleague, Emil-Maria Claassen, contributed to the European research on these subjects throughout the 1960s and 1970s.

Salin later became interested in the Austrian school of economics. In addition to Friedrich Hayek, who was one of Salin&#x27;s intellectual mentors, Salin has been influenced by the works of Frédéric Bastiat, Israel Kirzner, Ludwig von Mises, Murray Rothbard, and Jean-Baptiste Say. Salin opposes full-reserve banking and supports unregulated free banking and fractional reserves. He rejects the theory of John Maynard Keynes and sees it as an aberration in the evolution of economic ideas.

== Selected bibliography ==
Salin publishes primarily in French and has mostly published works in monetary theory and policy. In the 1970s and 1980s, he authored many articles on the European monetary system. In recent years, he has published books defending the system of free enterprise and the philosophy of classical liberalism in France.
Among his works of note are:
* &quot;Revenir au capitalisme : Pour éviter les crises&quot;, Odile Jacob, (2010)
* &quot;Français, n&#x27;ayez pas peur du libéralisme&quot;, Odile Jacob, (2007)
* &quot;L&#x27;arbitraire fiscal ou comment sortir de la crise&quot; (1996)

<doc id="448942" wikidata="Q7828469" url="?curid=448942" title="Tottenville, Staten Island">
<text>Tottenville is a neighborhood on the South Shore of Staten Island, New York City. It is the southernmost neighborhood and settlement in both New York City and New York State, as well as the westernmost neighborhood in New York City. Tottenville is bounded on three sides by water: the south side abuts the New York Bight while the west and north sides are bordered by the Arthur Kill. Nassau Place, Bethel Avenue and Page Avenue form the neighborhood&#x27;s eastern border.

The settlement was originally named &quot;Bentley Manor&quot; by one of its first settlers, Captain Christopher Billop (1638–1726), a member of the Royal Navy, after his own ship. In 1869 it was renamed as Tottenville after John Totten and his prominent local family of that name, some of whom served as Loyalists under Billop during the American Revolutionary War.

Tottenville is part of Staten Island Community District 3 and its ZIP Code is 10307 (formerly &quot;Staten Island 7, New York&quot;). Tottenville is patrolled by the 123rd Precinct of the New York City Police Department. Tottenville has been represented in the New York State Senate by Andrew Lanza since 2007. It is represented in the New York State Assembly by Michael Reilly.

==History==
=== Early history ===

The Raritan band of the Unami Indians, a branch of the Lenape or Delaware nation, were the original inhabitants of all Staten Island, including Tottenville. The largest pre-European burial ground, known as Burial Ridge, is located in what is now Conference House Park.

The village was originally named &quot;Bentley Manor&quot; by one of its first settlers, Captain Christopher Billop (1638–1726), after a small ship he owned named the &quot;Bentley&quot;. In 1869 the district was renamed as &quot;Tottenville&quot;, apparently in honor of John Totten and the locally prominent Totten family. Their names appear on tombstones in the cemetery of Bethel Methodist Church. Several Totten family members were Loyalists during the American Revolution and served under Captain Christopher Billopp.

During the colonial period and for a significant time thereafter, Tottenville was an important waypoint for travelers between New York City—of which Staten Island did not formally become a part until 1898—and Philadelphia. These were both sites of temporary capitals of the new United States. The town was the site of a ferry that crossed the Arthur Kill to the Ferry Slip in Perth Amboy, New Jersey. The ferry became less important when the Outerbridge Crossing opened in 1928, but continued to operate until 1963.

Two distinctive landmarks stand at the northern approaches to the neighborhood: the Bethel United Methodist Church, erected in 1840 and rebuilt on the same site in 1886 after a fire destroyed the original structure. Secondly, a now abandoned factory was built in 1900 as Nassau Smelting&#x27;s plant. It was later used for recycling by Lucent Technologies and closed in 2001.

Tottenville is bounded on the west and south by the Arthur Kill, and on the east by Raritan Bay, the mouth of which lies immediately to the south of Arthur Kill&#x27;s entry to the bay (which is also sometimes reckoned as being part of the Atlantic Ocean).

The Conference House was built by Christopher Billop and so named because it was the site of negotiations to end the American Revolutionary War in 1776, but these were unsuccessful. The historic residence has been preserved as the centerpiece of the city park of the same name. The Billop family, who developed the estate in 1678, continued to own it and the surrounding property during the 1776 meeting. Because they were Loyalists during the war, their land was confiscated in 1784.

Tottenville has a strong Victorian architecture heritage, akin to neighborhoods on Staten Island&#x27;s North Shore. This is unique to this South Shore neighborhood. The other South Shore areas were developed much later. Seven buildings in Tottenville have been honored with the Preservation League of Staten Island Award: 88 Bentley Street, 24 Brighton Street, 213 Wood Avenue, 115 Bentley Street, 7647 Amboy Road, 7639 Amboy Road, and the Tottenville Branch of the New York Public Library. 88 Bentley Street has been photographed as an example of Staten Island&#x27;s carefully restored Victorian homes in &quot;New York City - The Five Boroughs: A Photographic Tour&quot; (1997) by Carol M. Highsmith and Ted Landphair. In addition, the Old Church of St. Joachim and St. Anne was restored after a fire and is now used as a home for children.

===20th century===
During an early period of industrialization, many small factories once dotted the neighborhood&#x27;s western shoreline, but jobs have shifted and most are no longer in operation. Boat construction also once flourished along the shoreline, but the industry was rendered obsolete in 1900 when ships and commercial boats began being constructed of steel rather than wood. During World War I, shipbuilding was revived here, but that proved temporary. Tottenville&#x27;s last shipyard closed in 1930.

Harvesting oysters from surrounding waters was important to the economy in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. But this practice ceased in 1916 when the New York City Health Department determined that pollution made it unsafe. After the decrease in waterfront industries and decades of working to improve water quality, in 2005, the city approved oyster harvesting again.

Until the late 1950s, Tottenville 8 was one of the two telephone exchanges on the island with operators. The other was Honeywood 6. When dial service arrived, they were combined to become Yukon 4.

During the 1990s, the section of Tottenville southeast of Hylan Boulevard, until then nearly uninhabited, was an area of intense levels of new home construction. The district&#x27;s population density and crime rate still rank among the lowest in New York City. Until the 2000s, commercial development had largely been restricted to the Main Street corridor in the heart of the neighborhood. A second commercial core began to emerge at the north end of the community along Page Avenue and west of Amboy Road at this time. Further expansion on the neighborhood&#x27;s north end was seen in 2005 with the redevelopment of the old Nassau Smelting plant. Site clean up began in October 2006, and was scheduled to be finished within a year. The site had suffered chemical contamination, as it was principally used to recycle copper and other metals from old wires. Mill Creek, which runs through the site, was also scheduled to be cleaned as part of the project.

Tottenville Beach was largely undeveloped until the 1990s. It is exclusively residential, and is bordered on the south and west by Conference House Park. The beach for which the area was named is most popular for fishing, rather than swimming or sunbathing. During the first half of the 20th century, several hotels dotted the shoreline, including the Shore House Hotel. The Coral Bay Cafe restaurant operated there but was destroyed by Hurricane Sandy.

=== 21st century ===

Many large, stately homes built in Tottenville in the 19th century remain standing. But in the early 21st century, land developers have been buying up the property on which several of these houses have stood, with the intention of demolishing them and constructing townhouses on the property. The fate of 7484 Amboy Road, built circa 1870 as the parsonage of Bethel Methodist Church and contained an extremely large backyard, became the focus of an intense local controversy in March 2005. The community opposed plans by builder John Grossi, who had purchased the property, to raze the house and construct five townhouse units on the site. On March 17 Grossi spray-painted graffiti on the house, including a threat to fill it with low-income tenants under the federal Section 8 housing program.

The public outcry prompted New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg to have the home declared a landmark, and prevented its demolition. Bloomberg announced his decision during a visit to Tottenville on March 22, and the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission made the designation official on April 12. After years of being uninhabited and in disrepair, the home was restored in 2017.

In March 2008, over 20 blocks in the northern section of the neighborhood were changed to one-way streets. This was intended to improve traffic management on the older, narrower blocks.

In 2016, a consortium of Bridgewater Capital and the Brooklyn-based Riseman family bought of the Nassau Smelting property from Lucent Technologies. Their plans to rezone the property from Manufacturing (M) to residential (RX3) in order to develop residential housing units met with criticism and opposition from the community, because the soils were contaminated from the heavy metals that were recycled during Lucent Technologies tenure of operation. The future use of this property remains undetermined.

==Demographics==

<text>Lisa Anne Loeb (; born March 11, 1968) is an American singer-songwriter, musician, author and actress. She started her career with &quot;Stay (I Missed You)&quot; from the film &quot;Reality Bites&quot;, the first &quot;Billboard&quot; number one single for an artist without a recording contract. She achieved two additional top 20 singles with &quot;Do You Sleep?&quot; in 1996 and &quot;I Do&quot; in 1998. Her studio albums include two back-to-back albums that were certified gold: &quot;Tails&quot; and &quot;Firecracker&quot;.

Loeb&#x27;s film, television and voice-over work includes guest starring roles in the season finale of &quot;Gossip Girl&quot;, and two episodes, including the series finale, of Netflix&#x27;s &quot;Fuller House&quot;. She also starred in two other television series, &quot;Dweezil &amp; Lisa&quot;, a weekly culinary adventure for the Food Network that featured her alongside Dweezil Zappa, and &quot;Number 1 Single&quot; on E! Entertainment Television. She has also acted in such films as &quot;House on Haunted Hill&quot;, &quot;Fright Night&quot;, &quot;Hot Tub Time Machine 2&quot;, and &quot;Helicopter Mom&quot;.

Loeb has released children&#x27;s CDs and books; her 2016 children&#x27;s CD &quot;Feel What U Feel&quot; won the Grammy Award for Best Children&#x27;s Music Album. Loeb&#x27;s latest album, &quot;A Simple Trick to Happiness&quot;, was released in February 2020.

==Early life and education==
Lisa Loeb was born to a Jewish family in Bethesda, Maryland, and was raised in Dallas, Texas, where her parents still reside. Her mother, Gail, was the president of the Dallas County Medical Society Alliance and Foundation, and her father, Peter Loeb, was a gastroenterologist. She has a younger sister, songwriter Debbie Loeb. As a child, Lisa studied piano, but later switched to guitar. She attended The Hockaday School, an all-girls private school. For two years, she had her own radio show on 88.5 KRSM-FM, a 10-watt station licensed to the nearby all-boys St. Marks School of Texas. After graduating from high school in 1986, she attended Brown University, where she graduated in 1990 with a degree in comparative literature.

==Music career==
===Early years and first bands (1980s–1993)===
At Brown in the mid-1980s, Loeb and Elizabeth Mitchell formed a band named Liz and Lisa, with future singer/songwriter and classmate Duncan Sheik as a guitarist. The duo released the albums &quot;Liz and Lisa&quot; (1989) and &quot;Liz and Lisa - Days Were Different&quot; (1990) independently. After college, bassist Rick Lassiter and drummer Chad Fischer joined the band. After developing a following together, Loeb and Mitchell parted ways a few years after college.

Loeb attended Berklee College of Music in Boston for a session of summer school, and in 1990 formed a full band called Nine Stories. The band, which was named after the book by J.D. Salinger, included Tim Bright on guitar, Jonathan Feinberg on drums, and Joe Quigley on bass. Loeb began working with producer Juan Patiño to make the cassette &quot;Purple Tape&quot; in 1992. It included the earliest recordings of later popular tracks such as &quot;Do You Sleep?&quot;, &quot;Snow Day&quot;, &quot;Train Songs&quot;, and &quot;It&#x27;s Over&quot;. Loeb sold the violet-colored cassette to fans at gigs and used it as a sonic calling card to industry gatekeepers. She and her band made a recording of her song &quot;Stay (I Missed You)&quot; during the same period.

Loeb developed a following from her solo acoustic performances on the New York City coffeehouse circuit and the rock club circuit. She travelled to cities such as Philadelphia, Los Angeles, and Dallas, but focused mainly on New York City. She played acoustically and with her band in folk and rock clubs, including at CBGB. Loeb performed at music festivals such as the New Music Seminar and South by Southwest.

===&quot;Stay (I Missed You)&quot; (1994)===

Loeb&#x27;s big break came through her friendship with actor Ethan Hawke, who lived in an apartment across the street from her in New York City. She told &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot; that she met Hawke in the NYC theater community where, as she phrased it, &quot;I made music for his plays&quot;. Loeb gave Hawke the Juan Patiño-produced version of &quot;Stay (I Missed You);&quot; he in turn gave it to director Ben Stiller during the making of the 1994 film &quot;Reality Bites&quot;. Stiller subsequently decided to use the song in the film&#x27;s ending credits, and it was included by Ron Fair on the soundtrack on RCA Records. Hawke directed a rare one-take video on film, a continuous steadicam shot operated by Robin Buerki.

&quot;Stay (I Missed You)&quot; went on to become a number one hit on the American charts. When her song hit number one, Loeb earned the distinction of being the first artist to top the Hot 100 before being signed to any record label. The single reached Gold status on July 12, 1994, just over three months after its release date. Loeb and Nine Stories received a Grammy nomination for Best Pop Performance by a Group, and were named Best International Newcomer in the Brit Awards.

In 2019, Loeb released a limited edition 12&quot; red vinyl pressing of the song for the 25th anniversary of the song. The release included four unreleased versions of &quot;Stay (I Missed You)&quot;, &quot;Truthfully&quot;, &quot;Waiting for Wednesday&quot;, and &quot;I Do&quot;, recorded live in January 2013 in Japan.

In September 1995, Loeb&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Tails&quot;, credited to Lisa Loeb &amp; Nine Stories, was released on Geffen Records. The album was co-produced by Juan Patiño, her then longtime boyfriend. &quot;Stay&quot; was included on the album, and Loeb managed a top 20 hit with &quot;Do You Sleep?&quot; and two moderately successful radio hits with &quot;Taffy&quot; and &quot;Waiting for Wednesday&quot;. The album was certified Gold by the RIAA on December 1, 1995. Critics were favorable to the album, with Ken Tucker of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, in particular, noting, &quot;Loeb has an undeniable gift for creating an air of intimacy and vulnerability, which may well be enough for &#x27;Stay&#x27; fans looking for additional doses of contemplative melancholy&quot;.

After the release of &quot;Tails&quot; Tim Bright and Jonathan Feinberg left Nine Stories and were replaced with Mark Spencer and Ronny Crawford respectively.

In 1997, Loeb released a second major-label album on Geffen, &quot;Firecracker&quot;, and began experimenting more with orchestrations done with Dan Coleman. At this point, Loeb started going under her own name for the albums instead of using the band name, although she still continued to tour worldwide with Nine Stories, as well as acoustically as she had done from the start. &quot;Firecracker&quot; included hit singles such as &quot;I Do&quot;, which received radio success, peaking at #17 on the Billboard Hot 100 and music television.

Although the album was not as commercially successful as its predecessors, critics noted the mature and strong writing by Loeb.

<text>Mehli Mehta (25 September 1908 – 19 October 2002) was an Indian conductor and violinist.

==Early life==
Mehta was born in Bombay, India to a Parsi family. His involvement in music stemmed from his birth. As a young violinist his main musical influence and inspiration was Jascha Heifetz. A pioneering figure in the Indian musical world, he founded the Bombay Symphony Orchestra in 1935, and was its Concertmaster (1935–1945) and conductor (1945–1955). He was married to Tehmina.

==Performing career==
In 1940 Mehta founded the Bombay String Quartet. He spent five years in New York City studying with eminent violin pedagogue Ivan Galamian, and earned degrees from the University of Bombay and Trinity College of Music in London.

He moved to the United States in 1945, where he studied violin in New York. In 1955 Mehli Mehta moved to England, where he served for five years as Assistant Concertmaster and Concertmaster of the Hallé Orchestra of Manchester under Sir John Barbirolli. Mehta came to regard Barbirolli as &quot;one of the greatest influences of my conducting life.&quot;

In 1959 he joined the Curtis Quartet of Philadelphia and toured with them across the United States for the next five years. In later years he was to state, &quot;the string quartet has been the prime, basic factor of my entire musical philosophy.&quot; He then moved to Los Angeles and was Director of the Orchestra Department at UCLA (1964 to 1976).

Within two months of his arrival in 1964, he organised the American Youth Symphony with students from all the universities in Los Angeles. Under his dedicated leadership the orchestra grew to its current size of 110 young musicians, ages 16–27, from all over Los Angeles and the surrounding areas. He conducted the orchestra at the twelve-hour Beethoven Marathon in a performance of a Beethoven symphony on Beethoven&#x27;s 200th birthday, 16 December 1970, in the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, a concert at which his son, Zubin Mehta, also conducted. He led the orchestra until its 34th season in 1998.

In his biography of Barbirolli, author Michael Kennedy quotes the great conductor as saying, &quot;I... attended Mehli&#x27;s concert with the American Youth Symphony. I am glad I did, for dear Mehli was magnificent. Made those children play really quite splendidly. I was really thrilled and impressed.&quot;

Mehta was highly acclaimed when he appeared as conductor with the Philadelphia Orchestra in 1978, 1980, 1982 and 1984. In addition, he conducted the RIAS Berlin, Israel, Tokyo, Yokohama, Jerusalem, Venezuela and Brazil Symphonies; the Israel Sinfonietta; and the symphony orchestras of San Antonio, Grand Rapids, Milwaukee, Miami, Puerto Rico, Rhode Island, Jacksonville, Memphis, Ashland and Eugene. In March 1983, he made his New York debut at Carnegie Hall to unanimous acclaim with the National Orchestra Association Symphony.

Mehta was the recipient of the Governor&#x27;s &quot;Award for the Arts&quot; of the California Arts Council: the &quot;Magnum Opus Award&quot; of the University of Southern California; the American String Teachers Award; the Award of Merit from the Mayor and Council of Los Angeles; and the Zoroastrian Association of California&#x27;s Honorable Award. Mehta was under the management of ICM Artists Ltd., New York.

Mehli Mehta died in Santa Monica, California on 19 October 2002, aged 94.

==Legacy==
Mehta&#x27;s son, Zubin, is a well-known classical music conductor. His other son, Zarin, was the executive director of the New York Philharmonic and was previously the executive director of the Montreal Symphony as well as the Ravinia Festival in Chicago.

<text>This is a list of cities where [[trolleybus]]es operate, or operated in the past, as part of the public transport system. The original list has been divided to improve user-friendliness and to reduce article size. Separate lists—separate articles in Wikipedia—have been made for the following countries:

*Americas
**Brazil
**Canada
**United States
*Europe (&quot;Note:&quot; countries not listed here are included in &quot;this&quot; article; see &quot;Contents&quot; table below)
**France
**Germany
**Italy
**Russia
**Spain
**Switzerland
**Ukraine
**United Kingdom

This page also provides references that are applicable to all parts of the complete list.

Bold typeface for a location city indicates an existing trolleybus system, currently in operation (temporary suspensions not counted), or a new system currently under construction.

*Note: Tests began 18 September 1949 along tramway lines using &quot;all-service vehicles&quot; (dual-mode buses) purchased secondhand from Newark, New Jersey, US. The tests did not involve building new or converting existing supply because Havana&#x27;s tramway had twin-wire overhead. Regular service was not operated.

===Ecuador===

===Mexico===

*Note: The Mexico City trolleybus system was long thought to have opened in April 1952, but is now known to have opened more than a year earlier, in March 1951. Previous to that, there was an experimental line, for testing without passengers, in 1947 or 1948.

Notes for the two tunnel trolleybus lines:
* The 6.1 km Kanden Tunnel Trolleybus line operated almost entirely in tunnel, through a mountain, and connected Ōgizawa Station with Kurobe Dam, for tourists and hikers. The transport service continues to operate, but no longer uses trolleybuses. Ōgizawa Station is in Ōmachi city, Nagano Prefecture.
* The affiliated 3.6 km Tateyama Tunnel Trolleybus line, similarly, operates entirely in tunnel and connects Daikanbo with Murodō. The line is located in Tateyama town, Toyama Prefecture.

Both lines are part of the Tateyama Kurobe Alpine Route. This passes through Chūbu-Sangaku National Park (also known in English as &quot;Japan Alps National Park&quot;).

<text>Mid Bedfordshire was a local government district in Bedfordshire, England, from 1974 to 2009.

==Creation==
The district was formed on 1 April 1974 as part of a general reorganisation of local authorities in England and Wales carried out under the Local Government Act 1972. Mid Bedfordshire was formed by the amalgamation of five districts:
*Ampthill Urban District
*Biggleswade Urban District
*Sandy Urban District
*Ampthill Rural District
*Biggleswade Rural District
The new council continued to use the former offices of Ampthill Rural District Council and Biggleswade Rural District Council until 2006, when a new combined office was built at Priory House, Chicksands for £15million.

==Civil parishes==

The district comprised the following civil parishes:
*Ampthill
*Aspley Heath
*Arlesey
*Astwick
*Aspley Guise
*Battlesden
*Biggleswade (Town)
*Blunham
*Brogborough
*Campton and Chicksands
*Clifton
*Clophill
*Cranfield
*Dunton
*Edworth
*Eversholt
*Everton
*Eyeworth
*Flitton and Greenfield

*Flitwick
*Gravenhurst
*Harlington
*Haynes
*Henlow
*Henlow Camp
*Houghton Conquest
*Hulcote and Salford
*Husborne Crawley
*Langford
*Lidlington
*Marston Moretaine
*Maulden
*Milton Bryan
*Meppershall
*Moggerhanger
*Millbrook
*Northill
*Old Warden

*Potsgrove
*Potton
*Pulloxhill
*Ridgmont
*Sandy (Town)
*Shefford (Town)
*Shillington
*Silsoe
*Southill
*Stondon
*Stotfold
*Sutton
*Tempsford
*Tingrith
*Westoning
*Woburn
*Wrestlingworth and Cockayne Hatley
==Elections and political control==

The first election to Mid Bedfordshire District Council took place on 7 June 1973, with the 49 councillors elected forming a shadow authority until 1 April 1974. Following ward boundary changes, the number of councillors was increased to 53 in 1979. Elections for the whole council were then held in 1979 and every four years thereafter. In 2003 the wards were again redrawn, with the size of the council remaining at 53. The final election took place in 2007, with councillors staying in office until the abolition of the council in 2009.

The first council elected had a large majority of independent councillors. Gains by the Conservatives in 1976 meant that the council was under no control, although independents remained the largest group. In 1979 Conservatives gained a majority, which they held for sixteen years. In 1995 there was a large swing against the unpopular government of John Major, and the Labour Party gained 17 seats to achieve parity with the Conservatives. The council also included Liberal Democrats and Independents. In 1999 the Conservatives regained control, which they held until the council&#x27;s abolition.

† New ward boundaries

==Abolition==
In 2006 the Department for Communities and Local Government considered reorganising Bedfordshire&#x27;s administrative structure as part of the 2009 structural changes to local government in England. On 6 March 2008 it was announced that Mid Bedfordshire would merge with the neighbouring district of South Bedfordshire to form a new unitary authority called Central Bedfordshire. The new council was formed on 1 April 2009 although its initial members were not elected until 4 June 2009.

<text>South Bedfordshire was a local government district in Bedfordshire, in the East of England, from 1974 to 2009. Its main towns were Dunstable, Houghton Regis and Leighton Buzzard.

==Creation==
The district was formed on 1 April 1974 as part of a general reorganisation of local authorities in England and Wales carried out under the Local Government Act 1972. South Bedfordshire was formed by the amalgamation of three former districts which were all abolished at the same time:
*Dunstable Municipal Borough;
*Leighton-Linslade Urban District; and
*Luton Rural District.

==Premises==
The council initially used the former Dunstable Borough Council offices at Grove House in Dunstable as its headquarters, but also continued to use the former Leighton-Linslade offices at the White House in Leighton Buzzard and the former Luton Rural District Council offices on Sundon Road in Houghton Regis. A new headquarters for the council was built in 1989 on the site of the former Dunstable North railway station, called the District Council Offices. Following the council&#x27;s abolition in 2009 the building was used as a secondary office by Central Bedfordshire Council, being renamed as Watling House.

==Civil parishes==
The district comprised the following civil parishes:
*Barton-le-Clay
*Caddington
*Chalton
*Dunstable (Town)
*Eaton Bray
*Heath and Reach
*Houghton Regis (Town) 
*Hockliffe
*Hyde
*Leighton-Linslade (Town)
*Kensworth
*Slip End
*Stanbridge
*Streatley
*Studham
*Sundon
*Toddington
*Totternhoe
*Whipsnade

==Elections and political control==

The first election to South Bedfordshire District Council took place on 7 June 1973, with the 45 councillors elected forming a shadow authority until 1 April 1974. Following ward boundary changes, the number of councillors was increased to 53, with an election of the whole council held in 1976. The council resolved to hold elections by thirds thereafter. Councillors had a four-year term of office, and one third of the council was elected in three years out of four. Elections to Bedfordshire County Council took place in years that there were none to the district council. In 2002 the wards were again redrawn, and the size of the council was reduced to 50 members. An election of the whole council was held on the new boundaries. The electoral cycle continued by thirds in later years. The elections due to take place in May 2008 were cancelled, with councillors staying in office until the abolition of the council in 2009.

The first council elected was under no overall control, with the Conservative Party having the largest number of councillors. The party dominated the council for most of its existence, gaining a majority in 1976 which they held until 1995. In 1996 they were supplanted by the Labour Party as the largest grouping on the council, in a year that saw a strong vote against the unpopular Conservative government of John Major. In 1999 the Liberal Democrats briefly became the largest group on the council, which remained under no overall control. The Conservatives staged a recovery in 2000, taking 10 seats from Labour and the Liberal Democrats, and again gaining a plurality of councillors. They subsequently regained their majority, which they held until the council&#x27;s abolition.

==Coat of arms==
On 27 November 1976 South Bedfordshire District Council was granted armorial bearings by the College of Arms. The arms combined elements from the devices of the three merged councils, and were blazoned as follows:
Or a pile gules over all a single-arched bridge throughout argent masoned sable the keystone charged with an ear of wheat between on the pile three sickles proper all within a bordure engrailed sable; and for a Crest on a wreath of the colours out of a mural crown argent masoned sable in front of a demi-Bull three cog-wheels in fesse Or; and for a Badge or Device: Upon a roundel embattled gules irradiated with rays of the sun a demi-bull rampant couped Or.

The gold and red colouring was derived from the arms of the Bedfordshire County Council. The triangular &quot;pile&quot; and black engrailed border around the shield came from the device of Dunstable Borough Council, itself based on the arms of Dunstable Priory. The bridge across the centre of the shield was from the arms of Leighton Linslade UDC, and the sickles from those of Luton RDC. The crest above the shield was a gold bull, one of the supporters of the county council arms. The motto of Leighton-Linslade, &quot;By Truth and Dilgence&quot; was adopted.

==Abolition==
In 2006 the Department for Communities and Local Government considered reorganising Bedfordshire&#x27;s administrative structure as part of the 2009 structural changes to local government in England. On 6 March 2008 it was announced that South Bedfordshire would merge with Mid Bedfordshire to form a new unitary authority called Central Bedfordshire. The new council was formed on 1 April 2009.

<text>The knob-billed duck (Sarkidiornis melanotos) or African comb duck is a type of duck found along the tropical/sub-tropical wetlands and waterways of Sub-Saharan Africa and the island of Madagascar, as well as most of South Asia and mainland Indochina.

Most taxonomic authorities classify the knob-billed duck and the comb duck separately. A misidentified species of extinct Mauritian comb duck was initially described from unrecognised remains of the Mauritius sheldgoose (&quot;Alopochen mauritiana&quot;); this was realised as early as 1897, but the printed case of mistaken identity can still, occasionally, be found in modern-day sources.

==Taxonomy and systematics==
Uncertainty surrounds the correct systematic placement of this species. Initially, it was placed in the dabbling duck subfamily Anatinae. Later, it was assigned to the &quot;perching ducks&quot;, a paraphyletic assemblage of waterfowl most of which are intermediate between dabbling ducks and shelducks. As the &quot;perching ducks&quot; were split up, the knob-billed duck was moved to the Tadorninae or shelduck subfamily.

Analysis of mtDNA sequences of the cytochrome &quot;b&quot; and NADH dehydrogenase subunit 2 genes, however, suggests that it is a quite basal member of the Anatidae, vindicating the earliest placement. But its closest living relatives cannot be resolved to satisfaction without further study.

==Description==
This common species is unmistakable. It is one of the largest species of duck. Length can range from , wingspan ranges from and weight from . Adults have a white head freckled with dark spots, and a pure white neck and underparts. The upperparts are glossy blue-black upperparts, with bluish and greenish iridescence especially prominent on the secondaries (lower arm feathers). The male is much larger than the female, and has a large black knob on the bill. Young birds are dull buff below and on the face and neck, with dull brown upperparts, top of the head and eyestripe. Knob-billed ducks are generally larger in size when compared to comb ducks, and flanks are usually lighter (light grey, in females sometimes whitish).

Immature knob-billed ducks look like a large greyish female of the cotton pygmy goose (&quot;Nettapus coromandelicus&quot;) and may be difficult to tell apart if no other birds are around to compare size and hue. However, knob-billed ducks in immature plumage are rarely seen without adults nearby and thus they are usually easily identified too.

The knob-billed duck is silent except for a low croak when flushed.
==Ecology==
It breeds in still freshwater swamps and lakes in the tropics. It is largely resident, apart from dispersion in the wet season.

This duck feeds on vegetation by grazing or dabbling and to a lesser extent on small fish, invertebrates, and seeds. It can become a problem to rice farmers. Knob-billed ducks often perch in trees. They are typically seen in flocks, small in the wet season, up to 100 in the dry season. Sometimes they separate according to sex.

The knob-billed duck is declining in numbers locally, but due to its wide range it is not considered globally threatened by the IUCN. It is one of the species to which the &quot;Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds&quot; applies.

===Reproduction===
African birds breed during and after the rainy season and may not breed if the rain is scanty. Knob-billed ducks nest mainly in tree holes, also in tall grass.

Males may have two mates at once or up to five in succession. They defend the females and young but not the nest sites.

Females lay 7 to 15 yellowish-white eggs.

<text>The comb duck or American comb duck (Sarkidiornis sylvicola), is an unusual duck, found in tropical wetlands in continental South America south to the Paraguay River region in eastern Paraguay, southeastern Brazil and extreme northeastern Argentina, and as a vagrant on Trinidad.

Most taxonomic authorities split this species and the knob-billed duck from each other. The comb duck is generally smaller in size when compared to the knob-billed duck, and flanks are darker (black in males, medium grey in females).
==Systematics==
Uncertainty surrounds the correct systematic placement of this species. Initially, it was placed in the dabbling duck subfamily Anatinae.

The upperparts are glossy blue-black upperparts, with bluish and greenish iridescence especially prominent on the secondaries (lower arm feathers). The male is much larger than the female, and has a large black knob on the bill.

If seen at a distance, immature comb ducks can also be mistaken for a fulvous whistling duck (&quot;Dendrocygna bicolor&quot;). However, knob-billed ducks in immature plumage are rarely seen without adults nearby and thus they are usually easily identified, too.

==Ecology==
It breeds in still freshwater swamps and lakes in the tropics. It is largely resident, apart from dispersion in the wet season.

They are typically seen in flocks, small in the wet season, up to 100 in the dry season. Sometimes they separate according to sex.

===Reproduction===
Comb ducks nest mainly in tree holes, also in tall grass. They line their nests with reeds, grass, or feathers, but not down.

Males may have two mates at once or up to five in succession. They defend the females and young, but not the nest sites. Unmated males perch in trees and wait for opportunities to mate.

Females lay seven to 15 yellowish-white eggs. Several females may lay in a single &quot;dump nest&quot; containing up to 50 eggs.

It is moderately common between Carnarvon in the west, and Sydney in the east, although it has become scarce in some parts of the south-east, as a result of competition from the kelp gull, which has &quot;self-introduced&quot; since the 1940s.

Much larger than the ubiquitous silver gull, and nowhere near as common, Pacific gulls are usually seen alone or in pairs, loafing around the shoreline, steadily patrolling high above the edge of the water, or (sometimes) zooming high on the breeze to drop a shellfish or sea urchin onto rocks.

== Diet ==
The gulls&#x27; diet consists of a number various fish species and invertebrates. They frequently consume crabs, most often the species &quot;Ovalipes australiensis&quot; and &quot;Paragrapsus gaimardii.&quot; They also commonly eat &quot;Platycephalus bassensis&quot; (sand flatheads) and cephalopods, both of which are sourced from their regular consumption of waste from fish which have been cleaned on wharves and beaches. Additionally, they may eat insects, eggs, and other seabirds.

The gulls may be found scavenging abattoirs and in rubbish tips, where they will often steal food from other birds.

==Taxonomy==
The Pacific gull was first described by English ornithologist John Latham in 1801 from a Thomas Watling drawing, where the local name had been recorded as &quot;Troo-gad-dill&quot;. Its specific epithet refers to the Pacific Ocean.

Two subspecies are recognised:
==Description==

Pacific gulls are the only large gulls in their range, besides the occasional kelp gull. This species can range in length from and span across the wings. They typically weigh from . This species is mostly white, with dark wings and back, and a very thick (when compared to other gull species), powerful, red-tipped yellow bill. They have salt glands that secrete salty water through the nostrils. Young birds are mottled-brown all over, and attain their adult plumage only gradually; by its fourth year, a young Pacific gull has usually become difficult to tell apart from an adult bird.

Of the two subspecies, the nominate eastern race prefers sheltered beaches, and the western race &quot;L. p. georgii&quot; is commonly found even on exposed shores. Both subspecies nest in pairs or loose colonies on offshore islands, making a cup of grasses and sticks in an exposed position, and laying two or three mottled brown eggs.

<text>South Cambridgeshire is a local government district of Cambridgeshire, England, with a population of 162,119 at the 2021 census. It was formed on 1 April 1974 by the merger of Chesterton Rural District and South Cambridgeshire Rural District. It completely surrounds the city of Cambridge, which is administered separately from the district by Cambridge City Council.

On the abolition of South Herefordshire and Hereford districts to form the unitary Herefordshire in 1998, South Cambridgeshire became the only English district to completely encircle another. South Cambridgeshire District Council and Cambridge City Council work together on some projects, such as the Greater Cambridge Local Plan. Since 2017 the district has been a constituent member of the Cambridgeshire and Peterborough Combined Authority, led by the directly-elected Mayor of Cambridgeshire and Peterborough.

South Cambridgeshire has scored highly on the best places to live, according to Channel 4, which ranked South Cambridgeshire as the fifth-best place to live in 2006. A Halifax survey rated South Cambridgeshire the best place to live in rural Britain, and sixth best overall in 2017.

In January 2023 the council started a three-month trial of a four day working week, with the intention of extending the trial until April 2024. Conservative local government minister, Lee Rowley, ordered the trial be halted, claiming it would breach the Local Government Act.

==History==
The district was formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972. The new district covered the area of two former districts, which were both abolished at the same time:
*Chesterton Rural District
*South Cambridgeshire Rural District
The new district was named South Cambridgeshire, reflecting its position within the wider county.

==Governance==

South Cambridgeshire District Council provides district-level services. County-level services are provided by Cambridgeshire County Council. The whole district is also covered by civil parishes, which form a third tier of local government.

===Political control===
The council has been under Liberal Democrat majority control since the 2018 election.

The first election to the council was held in 1973, initially operating as a shadow authority alongside the outgoing authorities until the new arrangements came into effect on 1 April 1974. Political control of the council since 1974 has been as follows:
===Leadership===
The leaders of the council since 2001 have been:

===Composition===
Following the 2022 election and subsequent by-elections and changes of allegiance up to June 2023, the composition of the council was:
The next election is due in 2026.

===Elections===

Since the last full review of boundaries in 2018 the council has comprised 45 councillors representing 26 wards, with each ward electing one, two or three councillors. Elections are held every four years.
==Key policies==

===Four day working week===
In January 2023, the council began a controversial four day working week trial. This is not a compressed hours regime but rather staff work 80% of their hours for 100% of their pay and are expected to work more efficiently and therefore complete all their work in the reduced time.

The Conservative minister at the time, Lee Rowley wrote to the council leader “ask that you end your experiment immediately” and said he had concerns about the “value for money” for local taxpayers.

The scheme became particularly controversial when it emerged that the council&#x27;s CEO was also writing a PhD thesis on flexible working, a fact that had not been earlier disclosed. 

After 18 months of running the trial the council claimed reduced staff turnover, financial savings and little impact on service levels. 

===Premises===
South Cambridgeshire District Council&#x27;s headquarters are located in South Cambridgeshire Hall in the Cambourne Business Park in Cambourne. The district council&#x27;s headquarters moved from Cambridge to Cambourne in 2004.

==Transportation==
Cambridge Airport is located in South Cambridgeshire.

The Cambridgeshire Guided Busway passes through South Cambridgeshire.

==Economy==
ScotAirways has its head office on the grounds of Cambridge Airport in South Cambridgeshire.

== Residents ==
Jenny Jefferies an author of several cook books and member of the Guild of Food Writers.

==Parishes==
The whole district is divided into civil parishes. The parish councils for Cambourne and Northstowe take the style &quot;town council&quot;. Some of the smaller parishes have a parish meeting rather than a parish council.

==Arms==
The council&#x27;s coat of arms contains a tangential reference to the coat of arms of the University of Cambridge
by way of the coat of arms of Cambridge suburb Chesterton.
The motto, , means &quot;Nothing Without Work&quot; (or effort) in pre-standard Dutch; the only Dutch motto in British civic heraldry. It was originally the motto of Cornelius Vermuyden, who drained the Fens in the 17th century. The council uses a monochrome depiction of its coat of arms as its logo.
