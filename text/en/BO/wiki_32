<text>Argyll (; archaically Argyle; , ), sometimes called Argyllshire, is a historic county and registration county of western Scotland. The county ceased to be used for local government purposes in 1975 and most of the area now forms part of the larger Argyll and Bute council area.

Argyll is of ancient origin, and broadly corresponds to the ancient kingdom of less the parts which were in Ireland. Argyll was also a medieval bishopric with its cathedral at Lismore. In medieval times the area was divided into a number of provincial lordships. One of these, covering only the central part of the later county, was called Argyll. It was initially an earldom, elevated to become a dukedom in 1701 with the creation of the Duke of Argyll. Other lordships in the area included Cowal, Kintyre, Knapdale, and Lorn. From at least the 14th century there was a Sheriff of Argyll, whose jurisdiction was gradually extended; from 1633 the shire covered all these five provinces. Shires gradually eclipsed the old provinces in administrative importance, and also became known as counties. Between 1890 and 1975, Argyll had a county council. The county town was historically Inveraray, but from its creation in 1890 the county council was based at Lochgilphead.

The county is sparsely populated, with many islands and sea lochs along its coast, and the inland parts are mountainous. Six towns in the county held burgh status: Campbeltown, Dunoon, Inveraray, Lochgilphead, Oban, and Tobermory. Argyll borders Inverness-shire to the north, Perthshire and Dunbartonshire to the east, and (separated by the Firth of Clyde) neighbours Renfrewshire and Ayrshire to the south-east, and the County of Bute to the south.

Argyll ceased to be used for local government purposes in 1975. Most of the pre-1975 county was then included in the Argyll and Bute district of the Strathclyde region. The district created in 1975 excluded the Morvern and Ardnamurchan areas from the pre-1975 county, which were transferred to the Highland region, but included the Isle of Bute, which had not been in Argyll. Further reforms in 1996 abolished the Strathclyde region and made Argyll and Bute a single-tier council area instead. As part of those reforms, Argyll and Bute also gained an area around Helensburgh which had historically been in Dunbartonshire.

==Name==
The name is generally said to derive from Old Irish&quot; &quot;, meaning &quot;border region of the Gaels&quot;. The early 13th-century author of &#x27; wrote that &quot;the name &quot;Arregathel&quot; means the margin (i.e., border region) of the Scots or Irish, because all Scots and Irish are generally called &quot;Gattheli&quot; (i.e. Gaels), from their ancient warleader known as Gaithelglas.&quot; The word &#x27; also means &quot;coast&quot; when applied to maritime regions, so the name can also be translated as &quot;coast of the Gaels&quot;.

An alternative theory has more recently been advanced that the name may actually come from the early Irish kingdom of Airgíalla.

The legal name of the county was Argyll, which was also used by the Royal Mail as the name of the postal county for the mainland (the islands formed their own postal counties). The Ordnance Survey adopted the alternative form &#x27;Argyllshire&#x27; for the county on its maps.

==History==
The Kilmartin Glen has standing stones and other monuments dating back to around 3000BC, and is one of the most significant areas for Neolithic and Bronze Age remains in mainland Scotland. In 563AD Iona Abbey was founded, becoming one of the most important early Christian sites in Scotland.
The Gaelic kingdom of existed between the 5th and 9th centuries. Its territory covered north-eastern parts of Ireland in what later became County Antrim, part of the mainland of Great Britain in what is now western Scotland, and numerous islands in the Inner Hebrides. A fortress at Dunadd in the Kilmartin Glen, north-west of the modern town of Lochgilphead, served as the main seat of the kingdom. Dál Riata fragmented in the 9th century during the Viking Age; the part in Ireland was absorbed into the kingdom of Ulaid, the islands came under the control of the Kingdom of the Isles, and the part on mainland Britain was united in 843AD with the Pictish kingdom to its east under Kenneth MacAlpin to become the Kingdom of Alba.

The name Argyll (), meaning &#x27;coast or borderland of the Gaels&#x27;, came to be used for the part of the former Dál Riata territory on mainland Britain. The name distinguished the area from the , meaning &#x27;islands of the foreigners&#x27; which was used for the Kingdom of the Isles, ruled by Old Norse-speaking Norse–Gaels.

Argyll was divided into several lordships or provinces, including Kintyre, Knapdale, Lorn, Cowal, and a smaller Argyll province which covered the area around Inveraray between Loch Fyne and Loch Awe (the latter sometimes described by later writers as &quot;Argyll proper&quot; or &quot;Mid-Argyll&quot; to distinguish it from the wider area). The term &quot;North Argyll&quot; was also used to refer to the area later called Wester Ross. It was called North Argyll as it was settled by missionaries and refugees from , based at the abbey of Applecross. The position of abbot was hereditary, and when Ferchar mac in tSagairt, son of the abbot, became the Earl of Ross in the 13th century, the region of North Argyll gradually became known as Wester Ross instead.
Alba evolved into the kingdom of Scotland, but lost control of Kintyre, Knapdale and Lorn to Norwegian rule, as was acknowledged in a treaty of 1098 between Edgar, King of Scotland and Magnus Barefoot, King of Norway. In 1266, the Treaty of Perth re-established the Scottish crown&#x27;s authority over the parts of Argyll which had been under Norwegian rule, along with the former Kingdom of the Isles, which together became the semi-independent Lordship of the Isles.

By this time, the rest of the area under Scottish rule was divided into shires, administered by sheriffs. The shires covered different territories to the provinces, and it was the shires which subsequently evolved into Scotland&#x27;s counties rather than the older provinces. Following the Treaty of Perth, the Argyll provinces were initially placed in the shire of Perth. In 1293, two new shires were created within Argyll; the Sheriff of Kintyre, covering just that province, and the Sheriff of Lorn, covering Lorn, Knapdale, and Mid-Argyll (which probably included Cowal at that time).

The earliest reference to a Sheriff of Argyll was in 1326. The position appears to have been a re-establishment or renaming of the position of the Sheriff of Lorn. The post subsequently became a hereditary position held by members of Clan Campbell.

Despite the creation of the shires, much of the area remained under the practical control of the Lord of the Isles until 1476, when John MacDonald, last Lord of the Isles, quitclaimed Kintyre, Knapdale, and Mid-Argyll to full Scottish control. In 1481, Knapdale was added to the shire of Kintyre which then became known as Tarbertshire, being initially administered from Tarbert.

The Scottish Reformation coincidentally followed the fall of the Lordship of the Isles. The MacDonalds (the clan of the former Lords of the Isles) were strong supporters of the former religious regime. The Campbells, by contrast, were strong supporters of the reforms. At the start of the 17th century, under instruction from James VI, the Campbells were sent to the MacDonald territory at Islay and Jura, which they subdued and added to the shire of Argyll. Campbell pressure at this time also led to the sheriff court for Tarbertshire being moved to Inverary, where the Campbells held the court for the sheriff of Argyll. Tarbertshire was subsequently abolished by an act of parliament in 1633, being absorbed into the shire of Argyll. The act also confirmed the town of Inveraray&#x27;s position as &quot;head burgh&quot; of the enlarged shire.
In 1667, Commissioners of Supply were established for each shire, which would serve as the main administrative body for the area until the creation of county councils in 1890.
David II had restored MacDougall authority over Lorn in 1357, but John MacDougall (head of the MacDougalls) had already renounced claims to Mull (in 1354) in favour of the MacDonalds, to avoid potential conflict. The MacLeans were an ancient family based in Lorn (including Mull), and following the quitclaim, they no longer had a Laird in Mull, so themselves became Mull&#x27;s Lairds. Unlike the MacDonalds, they were fervent supporters of the Reformation, even supporting acts of civil disobedience against king Charles II&#x27;s repudiation of the Solemn League and Covenant. Archibald Campbell (Earl of Argyll) was instructed by the privy council to seize Mull, and suppress the non-conformist behaviour; by 1680 he gained possession of the island, and transferred shrieval authority to the sheriff of Argyll.

In 1746, following Jacobite insurrections, the Heritable Jurisdictions Act abolished regality, and forbade the position of sheriff from being inherited. Local governance was brought into line with that of the rest of the recently unified Great Britain, and the English term &quot;county&quot; came to be used interchangeably with the term &quot;shire&quot;. In 1890, elected county councils were created under the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1889.

The 1889 Act also led to parish and county boundaries being adjusted to eliminate cases where parishes straddled county boundaries. The parish of Small Isles straddled Argyll and Inverness-shire, with the islands of Muck, Rùm, Canna, and Sanday being in Argyll but Eigg in Inverness-shire. The whole parish was placed in Inverness-shire in 1891. The parishes of Ardnamurchan and Kilmallie both also straddled Argyll and Inverness-shire; the county boundary through Kilmallie was adjusted to follow Loch Eil in 1891. In 1895 these two parishes were both split along the county boundary; the part of Ardnamurchan in Inverness-shire became a new parish of Arisaig and Moidart, leaving the reduced Ardnamurchan parish wholly in Argyll, whilst the part of Kilmallie in Argyll became a new parish of Ardgour.

Argyll was abolished as a county for local government purposes in 1975, with its area being split between Highland and Strathclyde Regions. A local government district called Argyll and Bute was formed in the Strathclyde region, including most of Argyll and the adjacent Isle of Bute (the former County of Bute was more extensive). The Ardnamurchan, Ardgour, Ballachulish, Duror, Glencoe, Kinlochleven, and Morvern areas of Argyll were detached to become parts of Lochaber District, in Highland. They remained in Highland following the 1996 revision.

In 1996, a new unitary council area of Argyll and Bute was created, with a change in boundaries to include part of the former Strathclyde district of Dumbarton. The historic county boundaries of Argyll are still used for some limited official purposes connected with land registration, being a registration county.

===County council===

Argyll County Council held its first meeting at the courthouse in Inveraray on 22 May 1890, when over three hours were spent debating where the council should meet thereafter, with proposals put forward in favour of meeting in Lochgilphead, Inveraray, Oban, Dunoon, or even Glasgow (despite the latter being outside the county). It was decided to meet at Dunoon between May and September and at Oban for the rest of the year. The council did subsequently hold meetings in more places than just those two towns, meeting occasionally at all the towns which had been suggested at that first meeting.

The council also appointed a clerk who was based in Lochgilphead at its first meeting, beginning the practice of having the council&#x27;s main offices in that town. The clerk&#x27;s offices were initially at the County Offices which formed part of Lochgilphead&#x27;s courthouse and police station on Lochnell Street, which had been built in 1849. In 1925 the council bought the former Argyll Hotel at 5 Lochnell Street for £2,700, converting it to become their offices. The hotel had been built in 1887, and was renamed County Offices. The Lochgilphead building was not large enough to house all the council&#x27;s staff, and some departments remained in other towns throughout the county council&#x27;s existence, with the county treasurer being based in Campbeltown, the health department in Oban, and the education offices in Dunoon.

After the county council&#x27;s abolition in 1975, the building at 5 Lochnell Street became the sub-regional office of Strathclyde Regional Council, being renamed &quot;Dalriada House&quot;, whilst the new Argyll and Bute District Council established its headquarters at nearby Kilmory Castle.

==Geography==
Argyll is split into two non-contiguous mainland sections divided by Loch Linnhe, plus a large number of islands that fall within the Inner Hebrides. Mainland Argyll is characterised by mountainous Highland scenery interspersed with hundreds of lochs, with a heavily indented coastline containing numerous small offshore islands. The islands present a contrasting range of scenery – from the relatively flat islands of Coll and Tiree to the mountainous terrain of Jura and Mull. For ease of reference the following is split into three sections: Mainland (north), Mainland (south) and the Inner Hebrides.

===Mainland (north)===
The northern mainland section consists of two large peninsulas – Ardnamurchan and Morvern – divided by Loch Sunart, with a large inland section – known traditionally as Ardgour – bounded on the east by Loch Linnhe. This loch gradually narrows, before turning sharply west in the vicinity of Fort William (where it is known as Loch Eil), almost cutting the northern mainland section of Argyll in two. This area, in the vicinity of Fort William and along the railway line, contains the largest towns of northern mainland Argyll.

Ardnamurchan is a remote, mountainous region with only one access road; it terminates in Ardnamurchan Point and Corrachadh Mòr, the westernmost points of the British mainland. In the north-east of the peninsula two unnamed sub-peninsulas almost encircle Kentra Bay, and are bound by the South Channel of Loch Moidart to the north; to the east of this lies the River Shiel and then Loch Shiel, a long loch which forms most of this section of the border with Inverness-shire. Morvern is a large peninsula and like its northern neighbour is remote, mountainous and sparsely populated. In its north-west Loch Teacuis cuts deeply into the peninsula, as does Loch Aline in the south. At the estuary of Loch Teacuis lie the large islands of Oronsay, Risga and Càrna. There are numerous lochs in northern Argyll, the largest being Loch Doilet, Loch Arienas, Loch Teàrnait, Loch Doire nam Mart and Loch Mudle.

===Mainland (south)===

The southern mainland section is much larger than the northern, and is dominated by the long Kintyre peninsula, the terminus of which lies only from Northern Ireland on the other side of the North Channel. The coast is complex, with the west coast in particular being heavily indented and containing numerous sea inlets, peninsulas and sub-peninsulas; of the latter, the major ones (north to south) are Appin, Ardchattan, Craignish, Tayvallich, Taynish, Knapdale and Kintyre, and the major loch inlets (north to south) are Loch Leven, Loch Creran, Loch Etive, Loch Feochan, Loch Melfort, Loch Craignish, Loch Crinan, Loch Sween, Loch Caolisport and West Loch Tarbert, the latter dividing Kintyre from Knapdale. To the east Loch Fyne separates Kintyre from the Cowal peninsula, which is itself split into three sub-peninsulas by Lochs Striven and Riddon and split on its east coast by Holy Loch and Loch Goil; south across the Kyles of Bute lies the island of Bute, which is part of Buteshire, and to east across Loch Long lies the Rosneath peninsula in Dunbartonshire. The topography of south Argyll is in general heavily mountainous and sparsely populated, with numerous lochs; Kintyre is slightly flatter though still hilly. Near Glen Coe can be found Bidean nam Bian, the tallest peak in the county at 1,150 m (3,770 ft). Of the lochs and bodies of water the largest are (roughly north to south) the Blackwater Reservoir, Loch Achtriochtan, Loch Laidon, Loch Bà, loch Buidhe, Lochan na Stainge, Loch Dochard, Loch Tulla, Loch Shira, the Cruachan Reservoir, Loch Restil, Loch Awe, Loch Avich, Blackmill Loch, Loch Nant, Loch Nell, Loch Scammadale, Loch Glashan, Loch Loskin, Loch Eck, Asgog Loch, Loch Tarsan, Càm Loch, Loch nan Torran, Loch Ciàran, Loch Garasdale, Lussa Loch and Tangy Loch.

== Constituency ==
Starting in 1590, as one of the measures that followed the Scottish reformation, each sheriffdom elected commissioners to the Parliament of Scotland. As well as the commissioner representing &quot;Argyll&quot;, at least one was sent to represent Tarbertshire, Sir Lachlan Maclean of Morvern. In the 1630 parliamentary session, Sir Coll Lamont, laird of Lamont, was the commissioner for &quot;Argyll &quot;and Tarbert&quot;&quot;.

There was an &quot;Argyllshire&quot; constituency of the Parliament of Great Britain from 1708 to 1801, and of the Parliament of the United Kingdom from 1801 to 1983 (renamed &quot;Argyll&quot; in 1950). The Argyll and Bute constituency was created when the Argyll constituency was abolished.

==Civil parishes==
Civil parishes are still used for some statistical purposes, and separate census figures are published for them. As their areas have been largely unchanged since the 19th century, this allows for comparison of population figures over an extended period of time.

==Transport==
The West Highland railway runs through the far north of the county, stopping at Locheilside, Loch Eil Outward Bound, Corpach and Banavie, before carrying on to Mallaig in Inverness-shire. A branch of the line also goes to Oban, calling at Dalmally, Loch Awe, Falls of Cruachan, Taynuilt and Connel Ferry.

Numerous ferries link the islands of the Inner Hebrides to each other and the Scottish mainland. Many of the islands also contain small airstrips enabling travel by air. A fairly extensive bus network links the larger towns of the area, with bus transport also available on the islands of Islay, Jura and Mull.

The county contains a number of small airports which serve the region and Edinburgh/Glasgow: Oban, Tiree, Coll, Colonsay, Campbeltown and Islay.

Kintyre has been one of the mooted locations for a proposed British-Irish bridge; as the closest point to Ireland at first glance it appears to be the most obvious route, however Kintyre is hampered by its remoteness from the main centres of Scotland&#x27;s population.

<doc id="452027" wikidata="Q1054813" url="?curid=452027" title="Municipalities of Japan">
<text>Japan has three levels of governments: national, prefectural, and municipal. The nation is divided into 47 prefectures. Each prefecture consists of numerous municipalities, with 1,719 in total as of January 2014. There are four types of municipalities in Japan: cities, towns, villages and special wards of Tokyo (). In Japanese, this system is known as , where each kanji in the word represents one of the four types of municipalities. Some designated cities also have further administrative subdivisions, also known as wards. But, unlike the special wards of Tokyo, these wards are not municipalities.

== Status ==
The status of a municipality, if it is a village, town or city, is decided by the prefectural government. Generally, a village or town can be promoted to a city when its population increases above fifty thousand, and a city can (but need not) be demoted to a town or village when its population decreases below fifty thousand. The least-populated city, Utashinai, Hokkaidō, has a population of merely four thousand, while a town in the same prefecture, Otofuke, Hokkaidō, has nearly forty thousand residents, and the country&#x27;s largest village Yomitan, Okinawa has a population of 40,517.

The capital city, Tokyo, no longer has city status. Tokyo Prefecture now encompasses 23 special wards, each a city unto itself, as well as many other cities, towns and even villages on the Japanese mainland and outlying islands. Each of the 23 special wards of Tokyo is legally equivalent to a city, though sometimes the 23 special wards as a whole are regarded as one city. For information on the former city of Tokyo, see Tokyo City; for information about present-day Tokyo Prefecture, see Tokyo.

== Examples ==
See List of cities in Japan for a complete list of cities. &quot;See also&quot;: Core cities of Japan

The following are examples of the 20 designated cities:
*Fukuoka, the most populous city in the Kyūshū region
*Hiroshima, the busy manufacturing city in the Chūgoku region of Honshū
*Kobe, a major port on the Inland Sea, located in the center of Honshū near Osaka
*Kitakyūshū, a city of just under one million inhabitants in Kyūshū
*Kyoto, former capital, historic center and thriving modern city
*Nagoya, center of a major automobile-manufacturing region on the eastern seaboard of Honshū
*Osaka, a vast manufacturing city on the Inland Sea coast of Honshū
*Sapporo, the largest city in Hokkaidō
*Sendai, the principal center of northeast Honshū (also known as the Tōhoku region)
*Yokohama, a port city just south of Tokyo

==Non-municipality==
The same kanji which designates a town (町) is also sometimes used for addresses of sections of an urban area. In rare cases, a municipal village might even contain a section with the same type of designation. Although the kanji is the same, neither of these individual sections are municipalities unto themselves. Sometimes, the section name is a remnant from gappei, a system where several adjacent communities merge to form a larger municipality, where the old town names are kept for a section of the new city, even though the resulting new city may have a completely different name.
* Subprefectures are branch offices of the prefectures and not municipalities by themselves.
* Districts are not current municipalities but names of groups of towns and villages.
* Provinces are not current municipalities but (almost obsolete) names of geographical regions similar to prefectures.

<doc id="452037" wikidata="Q1935259" url="?curid=452037" title="Peacehaven">
<text>Peacehaven is a town and civil parish in the Lewes district of East Sussex, England. It is above the chalk cliffs of the South Downs about east of Brighton city centre, on the A259 road. It is the place where the Greenwich meridian crosses the English south coast. Peacehaven is next to Telscombe Cliffs, a later western extension to Peacehaven, which is in a separate parish and has a separate town council.

==History==
There is a Bronze Age barrow (burial mound) near the cliff top, which has been under investigation by local societies. The barrow is evidence of human occupation at Peacehaven at least 3,500 years ago. A 2007 excavation of the new Bovis Homes site west of Peacehaven Community School&#x27;s playing fields unearthed evidence for a prehistoric settlement throughout the Bronze and Iron Ages.

Peacehaven was founded in 1916 by entrepreneur Charles Neville, who bought land in the parish of Piddinghoe. He founded a company to develop the site, and also eventually built nearby town of Saltdean and parts of Rottingdean). He advertised it by setting up a competition in virtually every newspaper in England to name the development. The name of the winners who chose the name &#x27;New Anzac-on-Sea&#x27; (to commemorate the ANZAC&#x27;s involvement in the Battle of Gallipoli) were Mr West of Ilford, Essex and Mr Kemp of Maidstone, Kent.

The &quot;Daily Express&quot; later sued Neville over the competition, holding that it was a scam, since he was offering &quot;free&quot; plots of land in the town as runner-up prizes but issuing them only on the payment of a conveyancing fee. The &quot;Express&quot; won the case, but the publicity brought the scheme to a large audience. The idea was then to sell plots of land cheaply for people to build on themselves.

Initially, the town was New Anzac-on-Sea, but less than a year later, on 12 February 1917, it was renamed Peacehaven.

In 1927, the directors of Peacehaven Estates Ltd, of South Coast Road, Peacehaven, and 7, Pall Mall, Westminster, were Lord Teynham (Chairman), CW Neville (managing director), and G. Kay Green.

Although it has been claimed that the town was originally formed for retiring World War I veterans in order for them to escape and recover from the effects of the war, this is not proven. Mr Neville&#x27;s publicity promoted the town as being an idyllic setting; sea air and simple lifestyle were thought to have aided good health. The land was also cheap and, as a result, working-class families from the city started to buy plots and gradually build makeshift homes for weekends and holidays. This movement of frontier-style buildings made with whatever materials were available at the time was called the plotlands movement. Inhabitants felt a sense of freedom in living off what they needed and enjoying a simpler life away from the busy, polluted city. The plotlands provided the working class an opportunity that might not have been available otherwise.

By 1924, there were 3,000 people living in Peacehaven. Original houses were often very temporary affairs (some were old railway carriages). Others were constructed from former army huts, brought from North Camp near Seaford, a few of these still survive, having been given an outer concrete block wall (they can be identified by their oblong shape that tends to be end-on to the road). Eventually the local council invested in water and electrical services and so people started to build more substantial houses. After World War II, the local council introduced a zoning scheme in order to distinguish areas for improvement along the coast road. In 1974 the &quot;Town Centre Map and Action Plan&quot; was formed to aid development.

There are two listed farmsteads in the town: Halcombe Farm House, built in the 17th century; and Hoddern Farm House, from the 18th century. Another old building is the Shepherds Cot; now part of a private house in The Compts in north Peacehaven. This tiny cabin was built in the 1880s to shelter shepherds in the lambing season.

The popular singer and comedian Gracie Fields bought a home in Peacehaven overlooking the sea.

==Geography==
Peacehaven is on fairly flat coastal land, about above sea level. The pebble beach below the cliffs can be reached by a stairs and concrete driveway and sea walk. There is a number of green spaces along the A259 and the cliffs, one of which is called The Dell. A cinema formerly stood on this site, and now it holds events such as car boot sales, fireworks, fairgrounds, motorhome exhibitions, the Donkey Derby and an annual carnival, except in 2005 when the carnival was held on the Joff field behind the Meridian shopping centre. In the 1950s, the carnival stalls were on the then vacant land on the NW corner of the South Coast Road (A259) and Dorothy Avenue.

Neville was influenced by the American grid system of planning. There were originally no &quot;Streets&quot; in Peacehaven; only &quot;Roads&quot; and &quot;Avenues&quot;. With very few exceptions, &quot;Roads&quot; ran east to west, and &quot;Avenues&quot; north to south, most forming crossroads where they intersected the South Coast Road, which is now classified the A259. Apart from this road, Roderick Avenue, running roughly up the centre, was the only surfaced road (except for the area of Local Authority housing around Friars Avenue (north) in Peacehaven until the late 1950s, when the process of making-up the roads began. This started in Telscombe Cliffs and worked eastwards. As part of this, many of the Avenues had their junction with the main road blocked off to reduce the number of junctions and crossroads. The town still retains its original &quot;grid&quot; layout (apart from the newer development to the west called Telscombe Cliffs and above Firle Road): rectangular plots of land on both sides of the main road. Aerial photographs from the 1930s clearly show the &quot;grid&quot; pattern and, at that time, the scattered nature of the community.
The parish includes part of the Brighton to Newhaven Cliffs Site of Special Scientific Interest. The cliffs are mainly of geological interest, containing many Santonian and Campanian fossils. The SSSI listing includes flora and fauna biological interest too.

The point where the Prime meridian of the world crosses the coast is marked by a tall obelisk, commissioned by Charles Neville. It was unveiled on 10 August 1936, and has been relocated twice due to erosion of the cliffs.

==Governance==

Peacehaven&#x27;s lowest tier of government is the Peacehaven Town Council who are responsible for local planning, highways and other amenities. The council consists of 17 elected councillors from three wards, North, West and East Peacehaven. The May 2007 election returned 17 Conservative Party councillors.

The next level of government is Lewes District Council with responsibilities for the wider ranging areas such as council tax collection, environmental health and democratic services. Peacehaven provides six councillors to the district council, representing the same three wards as the parish council. Elections are held every four years, the May 2007 election returned six Conservative Party councillors; the May 2023 local elections returned six Labour Party councillors for these six seats.

The county council for East Sussex has responsibility for education, libraries, social services, civil registration, trading standards and transport. Elections for the county council are held every four years. Peacehaven parish is combined with the neighbouring Telscombe parish forming the Peacehaven &amp; Telscombe Towns electoral division which elects two councillors to the council. The May 2013 election returned two UKIP councillors.

Peacehaven is in the Brighton Kemptown and Peacehaven constituency for the UK parliamentary elections. In the 2024 general election the seat was won by Chris Ward of the Labour Party.

Prior to Brexit in 2020, Peacehaven was represented by the South East region, in the European Parliament.

==Economy and retail==
Peacehaven is twinned with the French town of Épinay-sous-Sénart and the German town of Isernhagen.

The Co-operative Meridian Shopping Centre is in the town. There is also a leisure centre, several pubs, coffee shops, cafés and restaurants throughout the town.

==Religious buildings==

There are four churches in Peacehaven and one in Telscombe Cliffs. &quot;The Church of the Ascension&quot;, build by L. Keir Hett to replace Peacehaven&#x27;s Church of England parish church, replaced a temporary building which had been built in 1922. The Roman Catholic Church, dedicated to the Immaculate Conception, was also founded in a temporary building in the 1920s, which survives as the church hall of the present brick church. There are also an Evangelical Free Church and a Kingdom Hall of Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses. Telscombe Cliffs United Reformed Church serves the population of both communities.

==Education==
The town has one secondary school, Peacehaven Community School. There are also three primary schools: Peacehaven Heights Primary School, Meridian Primary School, and Telscombe Cliffs Primary School and Nursery. The library in the Meridian Centre hosts various training talks for adults and educational activities for children, as well as hosting a regular citizens&#x27; advice bureau.

==Peacehaven in film and fiction==
The town plays a part in Graham Greene&#x27;s 1938 novel &quot;Brighton Rock.&quot;

The 1979 film &quot;Quadrophenia&quot; starring Phil Daniels in the leading role as a mod named Jimmy also ended up in Peacehaven. At the end of the film he finds out his idol, the suave mod &quot;poster boy&quot; Ace Face (played by Sting), is in reality a bellboy. He steals Ace&#x27;s scooter and heads out to Peacehaven Cliffs and an uncertain fate.

Peacehaven was selected for the site at which a car is pushed over the cliff in the TV thriller series &quot;The Level&quot;, while earlier Tiffany Mitchell&#x27;s ashes were portrayed to be cast over the cliffs, in the BBC soap &quot;EastEnders&quot; in 1999, with viewers having been told at her funeral that she had spent happy childhood holidays there.

Miodrag Kojadinović has a short story about a search for an ancestor in Peacehaven that plays with the concept of a &quot;haven of peace&quot;, which won a prize for stories with Jewish themes and appeared in Serbian and Hungarian, both out of Novi Sad.

==Music==
Punk band Peter and the Test Tube Babies formed in Peacehaven in 1978, and recall calling themselves the Banchood group for a short period.

<text>The Portland Pattern Repository (PPR) is an online repository for computer programming software design patterns. It was accompanied by the website WikiWikiWeb, the world&#x27;s first wiki. The repository has an emphasis on extreme programming, and is hosted by Cunningham &amp; Cunningham (C2) of Portland, Oregon. The PPR&#x27;s motto is &quot;People, Projects &amp; Patterns&quot;.

== History ==
On 17 September 1987, programmer Ward Cunningham with Tektronix and Apple Computer&#x27;s Kent Beck co-published the paper &quot;Using Pattern Languages for Object-Oriented Programs&quot; This paper, about software design patterns, was inspired by Christopher Alexander&#x27;s architectural concept of &quot;patterns&quot; It was written for the 1987 OOPSLA programming conference organized by the Association for Computing Machinery. Cunningham and Beck&#x27;s idea became popular among programmers because it helped them exchange programming ideas in an easy to understand format.

Cunningham &amp; Cunningham, the programming consultancy that would eventually host the PPR on its Internet domain, was incorporated in Salem, Oregon, on 1 November 1991, and is named after Ward and his wife, Karen R. Cunningham, a mathematician, school teacher, and school director. Cunningham &amp; Cunningham registered their Internet domain, &quot;c2.com&quot;, on 23 October 1994. Ward created the Portland Pattern Repository on &quot;c2.com&quot; as a means to help object-oriented programmers publish their computer programming patterns by submitting them to him. Some of those programmers attended the OOPSLA and PLoP conferences about object-oriented programming, and posted their ideas on the PPR. The PPR is accompanied, on &quot;c2.com&quot;, by the first ever wiki, a collection of reader-modifiable Web pages, which is named WikiWikiWeb.

<text>Terry Biddlecombe (2 February 1941 – 5 January 2014) was an English National Hunt racing jockey in the 1960s and 1970s. He was Champion Jockey in 1965, 1966 and 1969.

Biddlecombe was born in Hartpury, Gloucester on 2 February 1941. He rode 114 winners in the 1964/1965 season, and followed that with 102 the next season. In 1968/1969, he rode 77 winners, which saw him tied with Bob Davies. One of his finest moments came in the 1967 Cheltenham Gold Cup, when he rode the 100-8 horse &quot;Woodland Venture&quot; to victory. In 1972 he finished second in the Grand National on Gay Trip. Between 1972 and 1974, he rode many times for Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother, a well-known supporter of horse racing. In April 1974 he appeared on the television programme &quot;This Is Your Life&quot;, and finally retired from competitive racing having posted more than 900 winners.

==Early life==
His father Walter was a successful point to point jockey and farmer. His mother, Nancy was a horsewoman. His elder brother Tony, also a successful amateur jockey until he gave up racing to take over the family farm was born on 6 November 1938 and his sister Sue was born in May 1948.

Brother Tony was National Hunt amateur champion jockey in 1961/2 and his cousin, Peter Jones was also a jockey.

==Career==
On 23 February 1957 Biddlecombe was unplaced on first ride on Balkan Flower at Wincanton and rode his first winner, Burnella, at the same course on 6 March 1958 beating Fred Winter in a photo finish.

In February 1960 Biddlecombe turned professional. Shortly after he had his first ride in the Grand National on Aliform where he fell at the 22nd fence (Becher&#x27;s Brook).
Biddlecombe had his first ride for Fred Rimell in 1961, and on 28 January 1962 rode his first winner for him on Voleur. He was retained as his second jockey (behind Bobby Beasley) for the 1962/3 season and was retained as first jockey for the 1963/4 season.

On 27 February 1970, Biddlecombe suffered a life-threatening fall on King&#x27;s Dream at Kempton Park where he ruptured a kidney and broke 3 ribs. He returned to race riding on 29 April 1970 but missed the winning ride on Gay Trip in the Grand National, a horse he was to ride in the next 2 Grand Nationals, falling at the 1st fence in 1971 and finishing 2nd in 1972.

Due to increasing weight concerns, Fred Rimell replaced Biddlecombe with Bill Smith as stable jockey for the 1972/3 season. Biddlecombe continued as a freelance jockey, riding some Rimell horses and many horses for Fulke Walwyn and Ryan Price.

On 14 March 1974, he retired from riding after finishing 3rd on Game Spirit in the Gold Cup and unplaced on Amarind in the final race of the day.

Biddlecombe was National Hunt champion jockey on 3 occasions. 1965 with a season&#x27;s career best 114 wins, 1966 (102 wins) and 1969 (77 wins) when he tied with Bob Davies, his future brother in law.

Biddlecombe retired with 905 British winners - at the time, the only National Hunt jockey to have ridden more was Stan Mellor - and reputedly at least 47 broken bones.

Biddlecombe was a regular for the Jockeys Cricket XI, usually keeping wicket.

With a large frame, he was 5 foot 11 tall, he fought a constant battle with his weight and increasingly with alcohol.

==Personal life==
On 26 July 1968, Biddlecombe married Bridget Tyrwhitt-Drake. They had two daughters, Laura (born 10 December 1972) and Elizabeth (born 26 April 1974).

On retirement, Biddlecombe applied for a permit to train, but was refused by the Jockey Club as his wife already ran a livery yard from the premises.

He had spells as a BBC Sport paddock commentator and racing correspondent for Midlands ATV. It was whilst doing a feature that he first met Henrietta Knight.

In 1981, he married Ann Hodgson, they had three children, including Robert, a successful jockey. They emigrated to Australia in 1985 and a farm outside Perth where alcoholism eventually led to the end of the marriage.

In 1992 Biddlecombe returned to England and with the help of the Injured Jockeys Fund, dried out. A few months later he met Henrietta Knight again. They married in 1995.

==Later life==
Biddlecombe married the trainer Henrietta Knight in 1995, having given her the ultimatum &quot;It&#x27;s the bottle or me&quot;.

Together with his wife, held open days at their stables, with many coming to see the 3 x Cheltenham Gold Cup winner &quot;Best Mate&quot;, who was ridden to victory by Jim Culloty in 3 consecutive Gold cups in 2002, 2003 &amp; 2004 . Another of their star horses, &quot;Edredon Bleu&quot; won the 2003 King George VI Chase at Kempton Park Racecourse.

In the early 1980s, Terry worked with the actor John Hurt for his role in the 1983 film &quot;Champions&quot;, the biopic of jockey Bob Champion.
Terry was followed into the racing game by his son, from his second marriage, Robert.

He had remained involved in horse racing until his death on 5 January 2014 following a long illness.

Najimy created and produced the off-Broadway play &quot;Gloria: A Life&quot;, about the life of activist Gloria Steinem. Starting in 2012, Najimy has been creating, directing, and co-writing personal monologues with actresses including Olivia Wilde, Amy Schumer, Zosia Mamet, Debra Messing, Rosie Perez, and Gabourey Sidibe. The pieces have been performed at Glamour Magazine&#x27;s live evening of personal monologues titled &quot;These Girls&quot; and at the 2017 and 2018 MAKERS conference. Najimy is currently working on a documentary about the 53% of white women who voted for Donald Trump in 2016. She has performed her solo show, &quot;Lift Up Your Skirt&quot;, at many venues including the Adelaide Cabaret Festival, ICONS at Fire Island, and Feinstein&#x27;s at The Nikko in San Francisco. She is also currently producing a television series about the women&#x27;s movement.

Najimy uses her celebrity status to donate money to charities by appearing on game shows. She appeared as a contestant on a celebrity version of &quot;The Weakest Link&quot; where she won $50,000 for The Feminist Majority Foundation&#x27;s Campaign to Stop Gender Apartheid in Afghanistan. She won the season 6 tournament of &quot;Celebrity Poker Showdown&quot;, donating the $100,000 to V-Day, an organization that helps stop violence against women and girls. She was also crowned Grand Champion on CBS&#x27;s &quot;Gameshow Marathon&quot; in 2006, donating the $100,000 winnings to Girls Best Friend, a charity that helps empower girls. In 2013, Najimy was a contestant on &quot;Rachael vs. Guy: Celebrity Cook-Off&quot; on Team Rachael where she was playing for PETA, cooking only vegetarian food. She was eliminated on the Feb 3 episode, reaching third place.

Before she became a known actress, in 1981, Najimy was a contestant on &quot;Family Feud,&quot; which was used as the finale in &quot;Gameshow Marathon.&quot; Najimy and her family were winners on both shows. Najimy also appeared on the &quot;$25,000 Pyramid&quot; as a civilian contestant, on the episode dated July 31, 1985. She claimed, on the &quot;Pyramid&quot; show, that she also had been on &quot;American Bandstand&quot;. She returned to the &quot;Pyramid&quot; (&quot;The $100,000 Pyramid&quot;) on the June 26, 2016, episode as a celebrity guest opposite Rosie O&#x27;Donnell. She appeared once again in Season 2, Episode 7 on July 23, 2017, to play against Alexandra Wentworth, helping her contestant partner win the $150,000 grand prize.

==Personal life==
In August 1998, Najimy married actor and singer Dan Finnerty of The Dan Band. Gloria Steinem officiated the ceremony. Najimy and Finnerty have one daughter, musician Samia.

<doc id="452050" wikidata="Q5549345" url="?curid=452050" title="Human experimentation in North Korea">
<text>Human experimentation is an issue raised by some North Korean defectors and former prisoners. They have described suffocation of prisoners in gas chambers, testing deadly chemical weapons and surgery without anesthesia.

==Sources==
Human experimentation in North Korea has been described by several North Korean defectors, including former prisoner Lee Soon-ok, former prison guards Kwon Hyok and Ahn Myung-chul, and others. In Lee&#x27;s testimony to the U.S. Senate and in her prison memoir &quot;Eyes of the Tailless Animals&quot; (published in 1999) she recounted witnessing two instances of lethal human experimentation. An episode of the BBC television programme &quot;This World&quot; detailed some of the allegations. The accusations have been described as &quot;very plausible&quot; by a senior US official quoted anonymously by NBC News. Lee&#x27;s accounts have been questioned by Chang In-suk, former head of the North Korean Defectors’ Association in Seoul, as well as a number of former North Korean citizens on NKnet who believed that Lee&#x27;s accounts were &quot;unlikely to be true&quot;.

==Testing of deadly poisons==

Lee described an experiment in which 50 healthy female prisoners were selected and given poisoned cabbage leaves. All of the women were required to eat the cabbage, despite cries of distress from those who had already eaten. All 50 died after 20 minutes of vomiting blood and anal bleeding. Refusing to eat the cabbage would allegedly have meant reprisals against them and their families.

Kwon Hyok, who has stated he was a former head of security at Camp 22, described laboratories equipped with glass gas chambers for suffocation gas experiments, in which three or four people, normally a family, are the experimental subjects. After the people undergo medical checks, the chambers are sealed and poison is injected through a tube, while scientists observe from above through glass. In a report reminiscent of an earlier account of a family of seven, Kwon claims to have watched one family of two parents, a son and a daughter die from suffocating gas, with the parents trying to save the children using mouth-to-mouth resuscitation for as long as they had the strength. Dr. Kim, a chemist who led these experiments before defecting from North Korea, confirmed these reports and stated that the experiments&#x27; purposes included observing the poison gas&#x27;s effects on victims&#x27; mental state and determining how much gas would be needed to kill everyone in an area.

Kwon&#x27;s testimony was supported by documents from Camp 22 describing the transfer of prisoners designated for the experiments; the documents were identified as genuine by Kim Sang-hun, a London-based expert on Korea and human rights activist. Toxicologist Alastair Hay stated that Kim&#x27;s testimony is detailed and scientifically accurate enough that it is likely to be true. A press conference in Pyongyang, organized by North Korean authorities, denounced the allegations and claimed that the corroborating documents had been forged. Shin Eon-sang, South Korea&#x27;s Assistant Minister for Unification Policy, stated that &quot;[t]he authenticity of the evidence is difficult to assess&quot; because North Korean defectors&#x27; &quot;claims are in most cases exaggerated.&quot; Kwon&#x27;s account was also questioned by the Yonhap News Agency based in South Korea, which argued he had never served in a political prison and had no access to the information he claimed. Kwon and Kim claim that the South Korean National Intelligence Service told them not to talk about North Korean human experimentation to avoid harming South Korea&#x27;s relations with North Korea, and harassed them and denied them passports when they refused.

<text>Pierre Bouguer () (16 February 1698, Le Croisic – 15 August 1758, Paris) was a French mathematician, geophysicist, geodesist, and astronomer. He is also known as &quot;the father of naval architecture&quot;.

==Career==
Bouguer&#x27;s father, Jean Bouguer, one of the best hydrographers of his time, was Regius Professor of hydrography at Le Croisic in lower Brittany, and author of a treatise on navigation. He taught his sons Pierre and Jan at their home, where he also taught private students. In 1714, at the age of 16, Pierre was appointed to succeed his deceased father as professor of hydrography. In 1727 he gained the prize given by the French Academy of Sciences for his paper &quot;On the masting of ships&quot;, beating Leonhard Euler; and two other prizes, one for his dissertation &quot;On the best method of observing the altitude of stars at sea&quot;, the other for his paper &quot;On the best method of observing the variation of the compass at sea&quot;. These were published in the Prix de l&#x27;Académie des Sciences.

In 1729 he published &quot;Essai d&#x27;optique sur la gradation de la lumière&quot;, the object of which is to define the quantity of light lost by passing through a given extent of the atmosphere, and became the first known discoverer of what is now more commonly known as the Beer-Lambert law. He found the light of the sun to be 300 000 times more intense than that of the moon, and thus made some of the earliest measurements in photometry. In 1730 he was made professor of hydrography at Le Havre, and succeeded Pierre Louis Maupertuis as associate geometer of the Academy of Sciences. He also invented a heliometer, afterwards perfected by Joseph von Fraunhofer. He was afterwards promoted in the Academy to the place of Maupertuis, and went to reside in Paris.

Bouguer&#x27;s Mémoire presented to the Academy of Sciences in 1734 and published in 1736 was the first treatise on the theory of dome.

In 1735 Bouguer sailed with Charles Marie de La Condamine on a scientific mission to Peru, to measure the length of a degree of latitude in the meridian arc near the equator. Ten years were spent in this operation, a full account of which was published by Bouguer in 1749, &quot;La figure de la terre&quot; (French for &quot;the figure of the earth&quot;). 

In 1746 he published the first treatise of naval architecture, &quot;Traité du navire&quot;, which among other achievements first explained the use of the metacenter as a measure of ships&#x27; stability. His later writings were nearly all upon the theory of navigation and naval architecture.

In January 1750 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society.

==Recognition==
A crater on Mars was named in his honour. A lunar crater and an asteroid were also named after him.

His name is also recalled as the meteorological term &quot;Bouguer&#x27;s halo&quot; (also known as &quot;Ulloa&#x27;s halo&quot;, after Antonio de Ulloa, a Spanish member of his South American expedition) which an observer may see infrequently in fog when sun breaks through (for example, on a mountain) and looks down-sun – effectively a &quot;fog bow&quot; (as opposed to a &quot;rain-bow&quot;). It is &quot;An infrequently observed meteorological phenomenon; a faint white, circular arc or complete ring of light that has a radius of 39 degrees and is centred on the antisolar point. When observed, it is usually in the form of a separate outer ring around an anticorona.&quot;

The term &quot;Bouguer anomaly&quot;, referring to small regional variations in the Earth&#x27;s gravity field resulting from density variations in underlying rocks, is named after him.

A large bronze statue of him stands at the port in Le Croisic;

<text>Charles Marie de La Condamine (; 28 January 1701 – 4 February 1774) was a French explorer, geographer, and mathematician. He spent ten years in territory which is now Ecuador, measuring the length of a degree of latitude at the equator and preparing the first map of the Amazon region based on astro-geodetic observations. Furthermore he was a contributor to the &quot;Encyclopédie&quot;.

==Biography==
Charles Marie de La Condamine was born in Paris as a son of well-to-do parents, Charles de La Condamine and Louise Marguerite Chourses. He studied at the Collège Louis-le-Grand in Paris, where he was trained in humanities as well as in mathematics. After finishing his studies, he enlisted in the army and fought in the war against Spain (1719). After returning from the war, he became acquainted with scientific circles in Paris. On 12 December 1730 he became a member of the Académie des Sciences and was appointed Assistant Chemist at the Academy.

In 1729 La Condamine and his friend Voltaire exploited a loophole in the French government’s lottery, which brought them large profits.

In May 1731 La Condamine sailed with the Levant Company to Constantinople (now Istanbul), where he stayed five months. After returning to Paris, La Condamine submitted in November 1732 a paper to the Academy entitled &quot;Mathematical and Physical Observations made during a Visit of the Levant in 1731 and 1732&quot;.

===In South America===
Three years later he joined the French Geodesic Mission to territory which is now Ecuador, which had the aim of testing a hypothesis of Isaac Newton. Newton had posited that the Earth is not a perfect sphere, but bulges around the equator and is flattened at the poles. Newton&#x27;s opinion had raised a huge controversy among French scientists. Pierre Louis Maupertuis, Alexis Claude Clairaut, and Pierre Charles Le Monnier traveled to Lapland, where they were to measure the length of several degrees of latitude orthogonal to the Arctic Circle, while Louis Godin, Pierre Bouguer, and La Condamine were sent to South America to perform similar measurements around the equator.

On 16 May 1735, La Condamine sailed from La Rochelle accompanied by Godin, Bouguer and a botanist, Joseph de Jussieu. After stopovers in Martinique, Saint-Domingue, and Cartagena, they sailed southward through Panama, arriving at the Pacific port of Manta on 10 March 1736.

La Condamine&#x27;s associations with his colleagues were unhappy. The expedition was beset by many difficulties, and finally La Condamine split from the rest and made his way to Quito, Ecuador separately, following the Esmeraldas River, becoming the first European to encounter rubber in the process. La Condamine is credited with introducing samples of rubber to the &quot;Académie Royale des Sciences&quot; of France in 1736. In 1751, he presented a paper by François Fresneau to the Académie (eventually published in 1755) which described many of the properties of rubber. This has been referred to as the first scientific paper on rubber. He joined the group again on 4 June 1736 in the city of Quito.

The meridian arc whose length La Condamine and his colleagues chose to measure passed through a high valley perpendicular to the equator, stretching from Quito (now the capital of Ecuador) in the north to Cuenca in the south. The scientists spent a month performing triangulation measurements in the Yaruqui plains—from 3 October to 3 November 1736—and then returned to Quito.

After they had come back to Quito, they found that subsidies expected from Paris had not arrived. La Condamine, who had taken precautions and had made a deposit on a bank in Lima, traveled in early 1737 to Lima to collect money. He prolonged this journey somewhat to study the cinchona tree with its medicinally active bark (containing the anti-malarial drug quinine), the tree being hardly known in Europe. Because cinchona only grows at high altitudes the plants did not survive.
He described how the plants were brought to France:

On June 3rd I spent the whole day on one of these mountains [near Loja in present-day Ecuador]. Though assisted by two Americans of the region whom I took with me as guides, I was able to collect no more than eight or nine young plants of &quot;Quinquina&quot; [cinchona] in a proper state for transportation. These I had placed in earth taken from the spot in a case of suitable size and had them carried on the shoulders of a man whom I kept constantly in my sight, and then by canoe. I hoped to leave some of the plants at Cayenne [in Guiana] for cultivation and to transport the others to the King&#x27;s garden in France.

He collected valuable seeds, sarsparilla, guaiacum, ipecacuanha, cacao, vanilla and simarouba.

After returning to Quito on 20 June 1737, he found that Godin refused to disclose his results, whereupon La Condamine joined forces with Bouguer. The two men continued with their length measurements in the mountainous and inaccessible region close to Quito. When in December 1741 Bouguer detected an error in a calculation of La Condamine&#x27;s, the two explorers got into a quarrel and stopped speaking to each other. However, working separately, the two completed their project in May 1743.
===Return to Europe===
Insufficient funds prevented La Condamine from returning to France directly. Thus La Condamine chose to return by way of the Amazon River, a route which is longer and more dangerous. His was the first scientific exploration of the Amazon. He reached the Atlantic Ocean on 19 September 1743, having made observations of astronomic and topographic interest on the way. He also made some botanical studies, notably of cinchona and rubber trees.

In February 1744 he arrived in Cayenne, the capital of French Guiana. He did not dare to travel back to France on a French merchant ship because France was at war (the Austrian Succession War of 1740–1748), and he had to wait for five months for a Dutch ship, but made good use of his waiting time by observing and recording physical, biological and ethnological phenomena. Finally leaving Cayenne in August 1744, he arrived in Amsterdam on 30 November 1744, where he stayed for a while, and arrived in Paris in February 1745. He brought with him many notes, natural history specimens, and art objects that he donated to the naturalist Buffon (1707–1788).
La Condamine published the results of his measurements and travels with a map of the Amazon in &quot;Mém. de l&#x27;Académie des Sciences&quot;, 1745 (English translation 1745–1747). This included the first descriptions by a European of the Casiquiare River and the curare arrow poison prepared by the Amerindians. He also noted the correct use of quinine to fight malaria. The journal of his ten-year-long voyage to South America was published in Paris in 1751. The scientific results of the expedition were unambiguous: the Earth is indeed a spheroid flattened at the poles as was believed by Newton.

La Condamine and Bouguer failed to write a joint publication, and Bouguer&#x27;s death in 1758 put an end to their relationship. The other expedition member, Godin, died in 1760. Being the only surviving member, he received most of the credit for the expedition which drew a great deal of attention in France, as he was a gifted writer and popularizer.

On a visit to Rome La Condamine made careful measurements of the ancient buildings with a view to a precise determination of the length of the Roman foot. He also wrote in favour of inoculation, and on various other subjects, mainly connected with his work in South America.

La Condamine had contracted smallpox in his youth. This led him to take part in the debate on variolation against the disease and to propagate inoculation against smallpox. Assisted by the clarity and elegance of his writing, he presented several papers at the Academy of Sciences in which he defended his ideas with passion. He became a corresponding member of the academies of London, Berlin, Saint Petersburg and Bologna, and was elected to the l&#x27;Académie française on 29 November 1760. In August 1756, he married, with papal dispensation, his young niece Charlotte Bouzier of Estouilly. La Condamine had many friends, the closest one being Maupertuis, to whom he bequeathed his papers. La Condamine died in Paris on 4 February 1774, following a hernia operation.

<text>Burntwood is a former mining town and civil parish in the Lichfield District of Staffordshire, England. It is approximately west of Lichfield and north east of Brownhills, with a population of 26,049 and forming part of Lichfield district. The town forms one of the largest urbanised parishes in England. Samuel Johnson opened an academy in nearby Edial in 1736. The town is home to the smallest park (opened to commemorate the marriage of the Prince of Wales in 1863) in the UK, Prince&#x27;s Park, which is located next to Christ Church on the junction of Farewell Lane and Church Road. The town expanded in the nineteenth century around the coal mining industry.

Areas of Burntwood are Boney Hay, Chase Terrace, Chasetown, Gorstey Lea, Burntwood Green, and Summerfield &amp; All Saints. Nearby places are Brownhills, Cannock, Cannock Wood, Norton Canes, Gentleshaw, Pipehill, Muckley Corner, Hammerwich and Lichfield.

In July 2009 a Burntwood man, Terry Herbert, discovered a hoard of Saxon treasure with a metal detector in a field in the adjoining village of Hammerwich. Known as the Staffordshire Hoard, it is the largest hoard of Anglo-Saxon gold yet found.

==Transport==
Burntwood - along with Chasetown - has bus connections 60 and 62 to Cannock and Lichfield operated by Chaserider. National Express West Midlands operate service 8 (previously 10A) to Lichfield also linking Brownhills and Walsall.

Arriva Midlands was the former operator of most bus routes around Burntwood before being taken over by D&amp;G Bus in January 2021, now operating under Chaserider brand which is a subsidiary of D&amp;G. 

There are no railway connections in Burntwood. The nearest railway stations are Lichfield, Hednesford and Cannock, of which Lichfield is the closest.

Burntwood was served by the South Staffordshire Line which had a station in Hammerwich. There were many mineral lines in Burntwood which connected to Chasewater collieries as well as Angelsea Sidings. There is a heritage railway called the Chasewater Railway which is nearby with stops at Chasetown (Church Street) and Chasewater Heaths. In 2015, Lichfield District Council released a transport plan for Burntwood mentioning that if the line reopens to passenger services, there could be a chance of a new station to serve the town.

Ring Road near the town centre, as the name suggests, was intended to form part of the ring road around the town centre, a function superseded by the A5190.

==Media==
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC West Midlands and ITV Central. Television signals are received from the Sutton Coldfield TV transmitter. 

Local radio stations are BBC Radio WM, Capital Mid-Counties, Heart West Midlands, Greatest Hits Radio Birmingham &amp; The West Midlands, Smooth West Midlands, Hits Radio Birmingham and Cannock Chase Radio FM, a community radio station that broadcast from Cannock Chase. 

The town is served by the local newspapers, Lichfield Mercury and Lichfield Live.

<text>Draperstown () is a village in the Sperrin Mountains in County Londonderry, Northern Ireland. It is situated in the civil parish of Ballinascreen and is part of Mid-Ulster district. It is also part of the Church of Ireland parish of Ballynascreen and the Catholic parish of Ballinascreen, and within the former barony of Loughinsholin.

The village lies at the intersection of the townlands of Moykeeran (), Moyheeland (), Cahore and Tonaght ().

==Name==
Draperstown had its name bestowed upon it in 1818 by the Worshipful Company of Drapers, which had previously named Moneymore as Draperstown.

Prior to this however the settlement was originally known as &quot;Borbury&quot; (). It was then recorded as being called &quot;The Cross&quot; in 1813 and &quot;Moyheelan&quot; in 1821.

Despite the name given to it by the Drapers&#x27; Company, locals continued to commonly refer to the settlement with a variety of names: 
*The Cross, in reference to the crossroads where the market was held,
*Moyheelan, after the townland of Moyheeland (), which it was founded in,
*the Cross of Ballynascreen, after the fact that it was the main crossroads in the parish of Ballynascreen,
*Ballinascreen (), after the Roman Catholic parish.
*Draperstown-cross, after the crossroads that were the main feature of the settlement
*Ballynacross, of which the Irish form &quot;Baile na Croise&quot;, meaning &quot;townland of the crossroad&quot;, is used as the present Irish name for Draperstown.

The term &quot;screen&quot; in the popular Irish song &quot;The Verdant Braes of Screen&quot; apparently refers to Ballinascreen.

==History==
The village began to emerge around the crossroads in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Prior to that, the crossroads was the location for occasional fairs. In the 1600s, at the time of the Plantation of Ulster, the expropriated land in the Ballinacreen area was allocated to two London Livery Companies. It was divided between the Drapers&#x27; Company who took possession of the land west of the crossroads (Straw, Sixtowns and Moneyneena) while the Skinners&#x27; Company took possession of the land to the east. Although settlers began to arrive, the livery companies did not develop the area until later.

In 1760, the original St. Columba&#x27;s Church of Ireland Church was built near the crossroads. In 1798, Laughlin McNamee, a publican from nearby Moneyneena, opened a public house at the crossroads where the local fair was held. He also built several houses. A broad main street, now known as St. Patrick&#x27;s Street, typical of Irish towns, began to develop along the road to Sixtowns (). At this time this settlement became known by several names including the Cross of Ballinascreen, Moyheeland and Burboy. McNamee is buried at St. Columba&#x27;s Church in Straw (). In 1812, the Drapers Company built a series of buildings including a courthouse at the other side of the crossroads from the main street. The company named it Draperstown, which was adopted by the Post Office as the official name of the village. The Presbyterian Church opened in 1843 and St. Columba&#x27;s Catholic Church at Straw opened in 1853.

==Governance==
The town lies within the Moyola (District Electoral Area) of Mid-Ulster District Council which elects five councillors out of the 40 members of the council. In the 2023 Mid Ulster District Council election, the five elected councillors included three members of Sinn Féin, one member of the SDLP and one member of the Democratic Unionist Party.

It is located within the Mid Ulster (Assembly constituency) in the Northern Ireland Assembly and the Mid Ulster (UK Parliament constituency). Cathal Mallaghan of Sinn Féin was elected MP in 2024.

==Economy==
The town largely acts as a service centre for the surrounding farming communities. The main store in the town is the EuroSpar. There are a range of other smaller shops. There is also a livestock mart in the town for the sale of cattle, sheep and pigs. The mart has weekly sales.

==Churches and local landmarks==

The Roman Catholic Parish of Ballinascreen covers the town of Draperstown and surrounding district. The first church in the area dates back to at least the eighth century. It was a monastery church called &quot;Scrin Colimbkille&quot; (Columbcille&#x27;s shrine) which is located in the townland of Moneyconey outside the town. The parish gets its name from this shrine the ruins of which are still visible. There are four active churches in the parish. 
* The new Church of the Holy Rosary located on the Derrynoid Road opened in 1979. This replaced St. Mary&#x27;s Oratory which had opened in 1928. 
* The older St. Columba&#x27;s Church which is located on the Sixtowns Road at Straw opened in 1853.
* St. Patrick&#x27;s Church in Sixtowns opened in 1854.
* St. Eugene&#x27;s Church, Moneyneany opened in 1902.
There are two other churches both of which are listed buildings. These are:
* St. Columba&#x27;s Church, Church of Ireland, Tobermore Road, built 1888. The original church on this site was built in 1760, before the town itself. 
* Presbyterian Meeting House, 47 High Street, built 1843.

The Courthouse, 20 High Street, built 1839 is also a listed building. It is now used as a library.

In 1979, the core of the village was designated a Conservation Area.

==Demography==
Draperstown is classified as a village by the NI Statistics and Research Agency (NISRA). There were 1,638 people living in Draperstown in the 2001 census. The village had a population of 1,777 people in the 2011 census.

There is a regular bus service through the town. Ulsterbus routes 112 and 112a are from Magherafelt to Draperstown via the B40. Route 403 is from Magherafelt to Omagh passing through Draperstown via the B40 and B47.

==Irish language==
Although the dominant language of the residents of Draperstown has been English for the past century, in the surrounding rural areas the Irish language was widely spoken up until the late nineteenth century. Indeed, there is evidence that it was still spoken in some households in the 1930s and later. Although the most prominent native Irish speaker was Éilis Ní Dhonnghaile (1857–1935) of Labby, records of other Irish speakers included the Murray sisters in Moneyneena (1931), Peig James (1943) and Hannah James (1947); Matthew Regan, Draperstown (1942); and Mary Anne Doherty, Moneyneena and Antrim (1965). There have been attempts to promote the speaking of Irish in the area with the opening of an Irish language nursery and primary school. Pupils from the primary school can proceed to the Irish language secondary school Gaelcholáiste Dhoire in Dungiven.

<text>The Discovery Program is a series of Solar System exploration missions funded by the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) through its Planetary Missions Program Office. The cost of each mission is capped at a lower level than missions from NASA&#x27;s New Frontiers or Flagship Programs. As a result, Discovery missions tend to be more focused on a specific scientific goal rather than serving a general purpose.

The Discovery Program was founded in 1990 to implement the policy of the then-NASA administrator Daniel S. Goldin of &quot;faster, better, cheaper&quot; planetary science missions. Existing NASA programs had specified mission targets and objectives in advance, then sought bidders to construct and operate them. In contrast, Discovery missions are solicited through a call for proposals on any science topic and assessed through peer review. Selected missions are led by a scientist called the principal investigator (PI) and may include contributions from industry, universities or government laboratories.

The Discovery Program also includes Missions of Opportunity, which fund U.S. participation in spacecraft operated by other space agencies, for example by contributing a single scientific instrument. It can also be used to re-purpose an existing NASA spacecraft for a new mission.

As of June 2021, the most recently selected Discovery missions were VERITAS and DAVINCI, the fifteenth and sixteenth missions in the program.

==History==
In 1989, NASA&#x27;s Solar System Exploration Division began to define a new strategy for Solar System exploration up to the year 2000. This included a Small Mission Program Group that investigated missions that would be low cost and allow focused scientific questions to be addressed in shorter time than existing programs. The result was a request for rapid studies of potential missions and NASA committed funding in 1990. The new program was called &quot;Discovery&quot;.

The panel assessed several concepts that could be implemented as low-cost programs, selecting NEAR Shoemaker which became the first launch in the Discovery Program on February 17, 1996. The second mission, Mars Pathfinder, launched on December 4, 1996, carried the &quot;Sojourner&quot; rover to Mars.

==Missions==
===Standalone missions===
===Missions of opportunity===
These provide opportunities to participate in non-NASA missions by providing funding for a science instrument or hardware components of an instrument, or for an extended mission for a spacecraft that may differ from its original purpose.

* ASPERA-3, an instrument designed to study the interaction between the solar wind and the atmosphere of Mars, is flying on board the European Space Agency&#x27;s Mars Express orbiter. Launched on 2 June 2003, it has been orbiting Mars since 30 December 2003. The Principal Investigator is David Winningham of Southwest Research Institute.
*A NASA contribution to the joint ESA - CNES NetLander Mars meteorological mission was planned, consisting of meteorological, seismic, and geodetic instruments; however, the mission was terminated prior to its 2007 launch.
* Moon Mineralogy Mapper (M3) is a NASA-designed instrument placed on board the ISRO&#x27;s Chandrayaan orbiter selected in February 2005. Launched in 2008, it was designed to explore the Moon&#x27;s mineral composition at high resolution. M3&#x27;s detection of water on the Moon was announced in late September 2009, one month after the mission ended. The Principal Investigator was Carle Pieters of Brown University.
* Extrasolar Planet Observation and Deep Impact Extended Investigation (EPOXI) was selected in July 2007. It was a series of two new missions for the existing &quot;Deep Impact&quot; probe following its success at Tempel 1:
** The Extrasolar Planet Observations and Characterization (EPOCh) mission used the Deep Impact high-resolution camera in 2008 to better characterize known giant extrasolar planets orbiting other stars and to search for additional planets in the same system, as well as to investigate possible moons and ring systems of said exoplanets. A secondary science goal was to better observe the earth in both infrared and visible light, in order to create better computer models of exoplanets. The Principal Investigator was L. Drake Deming of NASA&#x27;s Goddard Space Flight Center. 
** The Deep Impact eXtended Investigation of Comets (DIXI) mission used the Deep Impact spacecraft for a flyby mission to a second comet, Hartley 2. The goal was to take pictures of its nucleus to increase our understanding of the diversity of comets. The flyby of Hartley 2 was successful with closest approach occurring on November 4, 2010. Michael A&#x27;Hearn of the University of Maryland was the Principal Investigator.
* New Exploration of Tempel 1 (NExT) was selected in July 2007 together with the EPOXI extension. It was a new mission for the &quot;Stardust&quot; spacecraft to fly by comet Tempel 1 in 2011 and observe changes since the Deep Impact mission visited it in July 2005. Later in 2005, Tempel 1 made its closest approach to the Sun, possibly changing the surface of the comet. The flyby was completed successfully on February 15, 2011. Joseph Veverka of Cornell University is the Principal Investigator.
* Strofio is a mass spectrometer that is a part of the SERENA instrument package on board the Mercury Planetary Orbiter component of the ESA&#x27;s BepiColombo mission. Strofio will study the atoms and molecules that compose Mercury&#x27;s atmosphere to reveal the composition of the planet&#x27;s surface. Stefano Livi of Southwest Research Institute is the Principal Investigator.
* MEGANE (Mars-moon Exploration with GAmma rays and NEutrons) is an instrument planned to fly aboard the Martian Moons Exploration (MMX), a Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) probe to Phobos and Deimos launching in 2024. MEGANE includes a gamma-ray spectrometer and a neutron spectrometer. David J. Lawrence of Johns Hopkins University is the Principal Investigator.
* In addition, the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter was temporarily managed under the Discovery Program from the termination of the Lunar Precursor Robotic Program until the creation of the Lunar Discovery and Exploration Program.

===Mission timeline===
==Proposals and concepts==
However often the funding comes in, there is a selection process with perhaps two dozen concepts. These sometimes get further matured and re-proposed in another selection or program. An example of this is &quot;Suess-Urey Mission&quot;, which was passed over in favor of the successful &quot;Stardust&quot; mission, but was eventually flown as Genesis, while a more extensive mission similar to INSIDE was flown as &quot;Juno&quot; in the New Frontiers program. Some of these concepts went on to become actual missions, or similar concepts were eventually realized in another mission class. This list is a mix of previous and current proposals.

Additional examples of Discovery-class mission proposals include:
* Whipple, a space-observatory to detect objects in the Oort cloud by transit method.
* Io Volcano Observer, was proposed for missions 15 or 16, a Jupiter orbiter designed to make 10 flybys of the volcanically active moon Io.
* Comet Hopper (CHopper), a mission to comet 46P/Wirtanen that would&#x27;ve utilised multiple short flights to repeatedly land on the comet&#x27;s nucleus in order to map various geological processes such as outgassing.
* Titan Mare Explorer (TiME), a lander mission to explore one of the methane lakes found in the north polar region of Titan, a moon of Saturn.
* Suess-Urey, similar to the later Genesis mission.
* Hermes, a Mercury orbiter. (similar to the MESSENGER Mercury orbiter)
* INSIDE Jupiter, an orbiter that would map Jupiter&#x27;s magnetic and gravity fields in an effort to study the giant planet&#x27;s interior structure. The concept was further matured and implemented as Juno in the New Frontiers program.
* The Dust Telescope, a space observatory that would measure various properties of incoming cosmic dust. The dust telescope would combine a trajectory sensor and a mass spectrometer, to allow the elemental and even isotopic composition to be analyzed.
* OSIRIS (Origins Spectral Interpretation, Resource Identification and Security), an asteroid observation and sample return mission concept selected in 2006 for further concept studies. It further matured and launched September 8, 2016, as OSIRIS-REx in the New Frontiers Program.
* Small Body Grand Tour, an asteroid rendezvous mission. This 1993 concept reviews possible targets for what became NEAR 4660 Nereus and 2019 Van Albada. Other targets considered for an extended mission included Encke&#x27;s comet (2P), 433 Eros, 1036 Ganymed, 4 Vesta, and 4015 Wilson–Harrington (1979 VA). (NEAR Shoemaker visited 433 Eros and Dawn visited 4 Vesta)
* Comet Coma Rendezvous Sample Return, a spacecraft designed to rendezvous with a comet, make extended observations within the cometary coma (but not land on the comet), gently collect multiple coma samples, and return them to Earth for study. (Similar to &quot;Stardust&quot;)
* Micro Exo Explorer, a spacecraft that would&#x27;ve utilised a new form of micro-electric propulsion, called &#x27;Micro Electro-fluidic-spray Propulsion&#x27; to travel to a near Earth object and gather important data.

===Mars focused===

* Pascal, a Mars climate network mission.
* MUADEE (Mars Upper Atmosphere Dynamics, Energetics, and Evolution), an orbiter mission designed to study Mars&#x27;s upper atmosphere. (similar to MAVEN of the Mars Scout program)
* PCROSS, similar to LCROSS, but directed towards Mars&#x27;s moon Phobos.
* Merlin, a mission that would place a lander on Mars&#x27;s moon Deimos.
* Mars Moons Multiple Landings Mission (M4), would conduct multiple landings on Phobos and Deimos.
* Hall, a Phobos and Deimos sample return mission.
* Aladdin, a Phobos and Deimos sample return mission. It was a finalist in the 1999 Discovery selection, with a planned launch in 2001 and return of the samples by 2006. Sample collection was intended to work by sending projectiles into the moons, then collecting the ejecta by means of a collector spacecraft flyby.
* Mars Geyser Hopper, a lander that would investigate the springtime carbon dioxide Martian geysers found in regions around the Martian south pole.
* MAGIC (Mars Geoscience Imaging at Centimeter-scale), an orbiter that would provide images of the Martian surface at 5–10 cm/pixel, permitting resolution of features as small as 20–40 cm.
* &quot;Red Dragon&quot;, a Mars lander and sample return.

===Lunar focused===
* Lunar sample return from the South Pole–Aitken basin, current geological models don&#x27;t adequately describe the area and this mission would have attempted to solve this issue.
* EXOMOON, &quot;in situ&quot; investigation on Earth&#x27;s Moon.
* PSOLHO, would use the Moon as an occulter to look for exoplanets.
* Lunette, a lunar lander.
* Twin Lunar Lander, a double lander mission to better understand the Moon&#x27;s evolution and geology.

===Venus focused===
* Venus Multiprobe, proposed for a 1999 launch, would have dropped 16 atmospheric probes into Venus, which would fall slowly to the surface, taking pressure and temperature measurements.
* Vesper, a concept for a Venus orbiter focused on studying the planet&#x27;s atmosphere. It was one of three concepts to receive funds for further study in the 2006 Discovery selection. Osiris and GRAIL were the other two, and eventually GRAIL was chosen and went on to be launched. 
* V-STAR (Venus Sample Targeting, Attainment and Return), a Venus sample return mission with a goal of understanding Venus&#x27;s evolution. The mission would have consisted of a Venus orbiter with an attached lander. The lander would fall through the Venusian atmosphere, collecting samples along the way, as well as after landing through the use of a &quot;mole&quot;. Said lander would launch those samples into a low orbit, where they would rendezvous with the orbiter, returning the samples to Earth.
* VEVA (Venus Exploration of Volcanoes and Atmosphere), an atmospheric probe for Venus. The main component is a 7-day balloon flight through the atmosphere accompanied by various small probes dropped deeper into the planet&#x27;s thick gases.
* Venus Pathfinder, a long-duration Venus lander. 
* RAVEN, a Venus orbiter radar mapping mission.
* VALOR, a Venus mission to study its atmosphere with a balloon. Twin balloons would circumnavigate the planet over 8 Earth-days. 
* Venus Aircraft, a robotic atmospheric flight on Venus&#x27;s atmosphere using a long-duration solar-powered aircraft system. It would carry 1.5 kg of scientific payload and would contend with violent wind, heat and a corrosive atmosphere.
* Zephyr, a rover concept that would be propelled by the wind force on its vertical wingsail. Conceived in 2012, the project has since made progress in developing electronic components that would allow the vehicle to operate for 50 days on the surface of Venus without a cooling system.

==Selection process==
=== Discovery 1 and 2 ===

The first two Discovery missions were Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous (NEAR) (later called Shoemaker NEAR) and &quot;Mars Pathfinder&quot;. These initial missions did not follow the same selection process that started once the program was under-way. &quot;Mars Pathfinder&quot; was salvaged from the idea for a technology and EDL demonstrator from the Mars Environmental Survey program. One of the goals of &quot;Pathfinder&quot; was to support the Mars Surveyor program. Later missions would be selected by a more sequential process involving Announcements of Opportunity.

In the case of NEAR, a working group for the program recommended that the first mission should be to a near-Earth asteroid. A series of proposals limited to missions to a near-Earth asteroid missions were reviewed in 1991. What would be the NEAR spacecraft mission was formally selected in December 1993, after which began a 2-year development period prior to launch. NEAR was launched on February 15, 1996, and arrived to orbit asteroid Eros on February 14, 2000. &quot;Mars Pathfinder&quot; launched on December 4, 1996, and landed on Mars on July 4, 1997, bringing along with it the first NASA Mars rover, &quot;Sojourner&quot;.

=== Discovery 3 and 4 ===

In August 1994, NASA made an Announcement of Opportunity for the next proposed Discovery missions. There were 28 proposals submitted to NASA in October 1994: 

# ASTER - Asteroid Earth Return
# Comet Nucleus Penetrator
# Comet Nucleus Tour (CONTOUR)
# Cometary Coma Chemical Composition (C4)
# Diana (Lunar and Cometary Mission)
# FRESIP-A mission to Find the Frequency of Earth-sized Inner Planets
# Hermes Global Orbiter (Mercury Orbiter)
# Icy Moon Mission (Lunar Orbiter)
# Interlune-One (Lunar Rovers)
# Jovian Integrated Synoptic Telescope (IO Torus investigation)
# Lunar Discovery Orbiter
# Mainbelt Asteroid Exploration/Rendezvous
# Mars Aerial Platform (Atmospheric)
# Mars Polar Pathfinder (Polar Lander)
# Mars Upper Atmosphere Dynamics, Energetics and Evolution
# Mercury Polar Flyby
# Near Earth Asteroid Returned Sample
# Origin of Asteroids, Comets and Life on Earth
# PELE: A Lunar Mission to Study Planetary Volcanism
# Planetary Research Telescope
# Rendezvous with a Comet Nucleus (RECON)
# Small Missions to Asteroids and Comets
# Venus Composition Probe (Atmospheric)
# Venus Environmental Satellite (Atmospheric)

In February 1995, &quot;Lunar Prospector&quot;, a lunar orbiter mission, was selected for launch. Three other missions were left to undergo a further selection later in 1995 for the fourth Discovery mission: &quot;Stardust&quot;, &quot;Suess-Urey&quot;, and &quot;Venus Multiprobe&quot;. &quot;Stardust&quot;, a comet sample-return mission, was selected in November 1995 over the two other finalists.

=== Discovery 5 and 6 ===
In October 1997, NASA selected &quot;Genesis&quot; and &quot;CONTOUR&quot; as the next Discovery missions, out of 34 proposals that were submitted in December 1996.

The five finalists were:
* Aladdin (Mars moon sample return)
* Comet Nucleus Tour (CONTOUR)
* &quot;Genesis&quot; (Solar wind sample return)
* Mercury Surface, Space Environment, Geochemistry and Ranging mission (MESSENGER)
* Venus Environmental Satellite (VESAT)

=== Discovery 7 and 8 ===

In July 1999, NASA selected &quot;MESSENGER&quot; and &quot;Deep Impact&quot; as the next Discovery Program missions. &quot;MESSENGER&quot; was the first Mercury orbiter and mission to that planet since Mariner 10. Both missions targeted a launch in late 2004 and the cost was constrained at about US$300 million each.

In 1998 five finalists had been selected to receive US$375,000 to further mature their design concept. The five proposals were selected out of about 30 with the goal of achieving the best science. Those missions were:
* &quot;Aladdin&quot;
* &quot;Deep Impact&quot;
* &quot;MESSENGER&quot;
* &quot;INSIDE Jupiter&quot;
* &quot;Vesper&quot;

&quot;Aladdin&quot; and &quot;MESSENGER&quot; were also finalists in the 1997 selection.

=== Discovery 9 and 10 ===
26 proposals were submitted to the 2000 Discovery solicitation, with budget initially targeted at US$300 million. Three candidates were shortlisted in January 2001 for a phase-A design study: &quot;Dawn&quot;, Kepler space telescope, and &quot;INSIDE Jupiter&quot;. &quot;INSIDE Jupiter&quot; was similar to a later New Frontiers mission called &quot;Juno&quot;; &quot;Dawn&quot; was a mission to asteroids Vesta and Ceres, and &quot;Kepler&quot; was a space telescope mission aimed to discover extrasolar planets. The three finalists received US$450,000 to further mature the mission concept.

In December 2001, Kepler and &quot;Dawn&quot; were selected for flight. At this time, only 80 exoplanets had been detected, and the main mission of Kepler to look for more exoplanets, especially Earth-sized. Both &quot;Kepler&quot; and &quot;Dawn&quot; were initially projected for launch in 2006.

=== Discovery 11 ===
The original Announcement of Opportunity for a Discovery mission released on April 16, 2004. The only candidate for selection for a concept Phase A study was JASSI, which was a Jupiter flyby mission based on the New Frontiers Mission Juno that was already under consideration for final selection (eventually Juno was selected as the 2nd New Frontiers mission in 2005 and launched in 2011). No other discovery mission proposed in response to the Announcement of Opportunity was considered for concept study and therefore no Discovery mission was selected for this opportunity (although a mission of opportunity was selected (Moon Mineralogy Mapper) as part of the AO in 2004). The next Announcement of Opportunity for a Discovery mission was released on January 3, 2006. There were three finalists for this Discovery selection including GRAIL (the eventual winner), OSIRIS, and VESPER. OSIRIS was very similar to the later OSIRIS-REx mission, an asteroid sample-return mission to 101955 Bennu, and &quot;Vesper&quot;, a Venus orbiter mission. A previous proposal of &quot;Vesper&quot; had also been a finalist in the 1998 round of selection. The three finalists were announced in October 2006 and awarded US$1.2 million to further develop their proposals for the final round.

In November 2007 NASA selected the GRAIL mission as the next Discovery mission, with a goal of mapping lunar gravity and a 2011 launch. There were 23 other proposals that were also under consideration. The mission had a budget of US$375 million (then-year dollars) which included construction and launch.

=== Discovery 12 ===
The Announcement of Opportunity for a Discovery mission released on June 7, 2010. For this cycle, 28 proposals were received; 3 were for the Moon, 4 for Mars, 7 for Venus, 1 for Jupiter, 1 to a Jupiter Trojan, 2 to Saturn, 7 to asteroids, and 3 to comets. Out of the 28 proposals, three finalists received US$3 million in May 2011 to develop a detailed concept study: 
* &quot;InSight&quot;, a Mars lander.
* Titan Mare Explorer (TiME), a lake lander for Saturn&#x27;s moon Titan with methane-ethane lakes.
* Comet Hopper (CHopper) to study cometary evolution by landing on a comet multiple times and observing its changes as it interacts with the Sun.

In August 2012, InSight was selected for development and launch. The mission launched on May 5, 2018, and successfully landed on Mars on November 26.

=== Discovery 13 and 14 ===

In February 2014, NASA released a Discovery Program &#x27;Draft Announcement of Opportunity&#x27; for launch readiness date of December 31, 2021. The final AO was released on November 5, 2014, and on September 30, 2015, NASA selected five mission concepts as finalists, each received $3 million for one-year of further study and concept refinement.

*Deep Atmosphere Venus Investigation of Noble gases, Chemistry, and Imaging (DAVINCI)
*Venus Emissivity, Radio Science, InSAR Topography and Spectroscopy (VERITAS)
*Near-Earth Object Camera (NEOCam)
*&quot;Lucy&quot;
*&quot;Psyche&quot;

On January 4, 2017, Lucy and Psyche were selected for the 13th and 14th Discovery missions, respectively and launched on 16 October 2021 and 13 October 2023, respectively. &quot;Lucy&quot; will fly by five Jupiter trojans, asteroids which share Jupiter&#x27;s orbit around the Sun, orbiting either ahead of or behind the planet. &quot;Psyche&quot; will explore the origin of planetary cores by orbiting and studying the metallic asteroid 16 Psyche.

===Discovery 15 and 16===
On December 22, 2018, NASA released a draft of its Discovery 2019 Announcement of Opportunity, which outlined its intent to select up to two missions with launch readiness dates of July 1, 2025 – December 31, 2026, and/or July 1, 2028 – December 31, 2029, as Discovery 15 and 16, respectively. The final Announcement of Opportunity was released on April 1, 2019, and proposal submissions were accepted between then and July 1, 2019.

Finalists, announced on February 13, 2020, were:

*DAVINCI (Deep Atmosphere Venus Investigation of Noble gases, Chemistry, and Imaging), a Venus atmospheric probe.
*Io Volcano Observer, an orbiter to Jupiter to perform at least nine flybys of Jupiter&#x27;s volcanically active moon Io.
*&quot;Trident&quot;, a probe that would conduct a flyby of Neptune and its moon Triton.
*VERITAS (Venus Emissivity, Radio Science, InSAR, Topography, and Spectroscopy), a Venus orbiter to map the surface of Venus in high resolution.
On June 2, 2021, NASA administrator Bill Nelson announced in his &quot;State of NASA&quot; address that the two Venus missions, VERITAS and DAVINCI, had been selected for development. The two missions will launch between 2031 and 2032.

Other proposal submissions for Discovery 15 and 16 missions included:

;Asteroids, comets, Centaurs, interplanetary dust
*&quot;Centaurus&quot;, a reconnaissance mission to explore multiple Centaurs via flybys as a way to learn about Solar System and planet formation.

<doc id="452071" wikidata="Q7869829" url="?curid=452071" title="USS Grayling (SS-209)">
<text>USS &quot;Grayling&quot; (SS-209) was the tenth &quot;Tambor&quot;-class submarine to be commissioned in the United States Navy in the years leading up to the country&#x27;s December 1941 entry into World War II. She was the fourth ship of the United States Navy to be named for the grayling. Her wartime service was in the Pacific Ocean. She completed seven war patrols in the following 20 months, and is credited with the sinking of over 20,000 tons of Japanese merchant shipping and warships. &quot;Grayling&quot; received six battle stars for her World War II service. She was declared lost with all hands in September 1943. Her fate remains an unsolved mystery. Of the twelve &quot;Tambor&quot;-class submarines, only five survived the war.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Grayling&quot;′s keel was laid down at the Portsmouth Navy Yard in Kittery, Maine, on 15 December 1939. She was launched on 4 September 1940, sponsored by Mrs. Marion Barnes Bryant Leary, wife of Rear Admiral Herbert F. Leary, and commissioned on 1 March 1941.

==Pre-World War II==

After conducting tests and sea trials, she was called upon 20 June 1941 to assist in the search for submarine &quot;O-9&quot; (SS-70), which had failed to surface after a practice dive off Isles of Shoals. &quot;O-9&quot; was subsequently discovered on the bottom, but rescue efforts failed; &quot;Grayling&quot; participated 22 June in the memorial services for those lost.

Joining the Atlantic Fleet, &quot;Grayling&quot; sailed on shakedown cruise on 4 August to Morehead City, North Carolina, and St. Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands, returning to Portsmouth on 29 August. After final acceptance, she departed 17 November, armed at Newport, Rhode Island, and sailed for duty with the Pacific Fleet. &quot;Grayling&quot; transited the Panama Canal on 3 December and moored at San Diego, California, on 10 December.

==Start of War, and Raising of Nimitz&#x27;s Flag==

&quot;Grayling&quot; sailed for Pearl Harbor on 17 December, arrived 24 December, and had the honor of being chosen for the Pacific Fleet change of command ceremony on 31 December 1941. The ceremony would normally have taken place on a battleship, but all the fleet&#x27;s battleships had been either sunk or damaged during the Japanese Navy&#x27;s attack three weeks earlier. On that day, Admiral Chester Nimitz hoisted his flag aboard &quot;Grayling&quot; as Commander, Pacific Fleet and began the United States Navy&#x27;s long fighting road back to victory in the Pacific.
==COMSUBPAC Patrols, 1942==

After the ceremonies, &quot;Grayling&quot; stood out of Pearl Harbor on her first war patrol 5 January 1942. Cruising the Northern Gilbert Islands, &quot;Grayling&quot; failed to register a kill, but gained much in training and readiness, returning to Pearl Harbor on 7 March.

Her second patrol, beginning 27 March, was more successful. Cruising off the coast of Japan itself, &quot;Grayling&quot; sank her first ship 13 April, sending the cargo freighter &quot;Ryujin Maru&quot; to the bottom. She returned to Hawaii on 16 May.

&quot;Grayling&quot; returned to action in June as all available ships were pressed into service to oppose the Japanese advance on Midway Island. As part of Task Group 7.1, &quot;Grayling&quot; and her sister submarines were arranged in a fan-like reconnaissance deployment west of Midway Atoll in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands, helping to provide knowledge of Japanese movements. During this deployment, 12 U.S. Army Air Forces B-17 Flying Fortress bombers sighted &quot;Grayling&quot; on 7 June 1942 while she was on the surface, and three of them mistakenly attacked her with a string of twenty bombs dropped from an altitude of more than , all of which missed. &quot;Grayling&quot; quickly crash-dived and avoided damage, but the crews claimed to have sunk a Japanese heavy cruiser in 15 seconds.

As U.S. Navy planners established a submarine blockade of Truk in connection with the U.S. offensive in the Solomon Islands, &quot;Grayling&quot; began her third war patrol on 14 July 1942 around the Japanese stronghold. She damaged a Japanese submarine tender on 13 August, but was forced to return to Pearl Harbor on 26 August by fuel leaks.

At Pearl Harbor, &quot;Grayling&quot; was repaired and was fitted with surface radar, after which she began her fourth patrol on 19 October 1942. Although attacked by gunfire and six separate depth charge runs by Japanese destroyers, &quot;Grayling&quot; succeeded on 10 November 1942 in sinking a 4,000-ton cargo ship southwest of Truk. She also destroyed a Japanese schooner on 4 December before putting into Fremantle submarine base, Western Australia, 13 December 1942.

==Deployment to Australia, 1943==

Changing her base of operations to Australia, &quot;Grayling&quot; stood out of Fremantle on 7 January 1943 on her fifth patrol, this time in Philippine waters. She sank cargo ship &quot;Ushio Maru&quot; west of Luzon on 26 January and damaged another Japanese ship the next day. After sinking a schooner on 24 February, &quot;Grayling&quot; returned to Fremantle.

&quot;Grayling&quot; left Australian waters on 26 March on her sixth war patrol and cruised in the Tarakan area and the Verde Island Passage. There, she attacked and sank cargo ship &quot;Shanghai Maru&quot; on 9 April and damaged four other ships before returning to Fremantle on 25 April.

Her seventh war patrol, commencing 18 May, took &quot;Grayling&quot; into the waters off northwest Borneo. While she en route to her patrol area, a PBY Catalina flying boat of U.S. Navy Patrol Squadron 101 (VP-101) mistakenly dropped a depth charge on her as she submerged in the Indian Ocean at . The depth charge did not explode. After reaching her patrol area, &quot;Grayling&quot; damaged a freighter and two smaller ships before returning to her base on 6 July 1943.

==Loss==

&quot;Grayling&quot; began her eighth and last war patrol in July, 1943, from Fremantle. She made two visits to the coast of the Philippines, delivering supplies and equipment to guerrillas at Pucio Point, Pandan Bay, Panay, 31 July and 23 August 1943. Cruising in the Philippines area, &quot;Grayling&quot; recorded her last kill, the passenger-cargo &quot;Meizan Maru&quot; on 27 August in the Tablas Strait, but was not heard from again after 9 September. She was scheduled to make a radio report on 12 September, which she did not, and all attempts to contact her failed. &quot;Grayling&quot; was officially reported &quot;lost with all hands&quot; 30 September 1943.

On 27 August 1943, Japanese ships witnessed a torpedo attack, and the next day a surfaced submarine was seen, both in the Tablas Strait area, and then on 9 September a surfaced American submarine was seen inside Lingayen Gulf. All of these sightings correspond with &quot;Grayling&quot;&#x27;s orders to patrol the approaches to Manila. On 9 September 1943, Japanese passenger-cargo vessel &quot;Hokuan Maru&quot; reported a submarine in shallow water west of Luzon. The ship made a run over the area and &quot;noted an impact with a submerged object&quot;. No additional data are available.

Assuming she survived this incident, no other recorded Japanese attacks could have sunk &quot;Grayling&quot;. Her loss may have been operational or by an unrecorded attack. The only certainty, therefore, is that &quot;Grayling&quot; was lost between 9 September and 12 September 1943 either in Lingayen Gulf or along the approaches to Manila. ComTaskFor71 requested a transmission from &quot;Grayling&quot; on 12 September, but did not receive one.

&quot;Grayling&quot; was credited with five major kills, totaling 20,575 tons. All but the first of &quot;Grayling&quot;&#x27;s eight war patrols were declared &quot;successful&quot;.

==Honors and awards==
&quot;Grayling&quot; received six battle stars for her World War II service.

<doc id="452072" wikidata="Q7873893" url="?curid=452072" title="USS Saury">
<text>USS &quot;Saury&quot; (SS-189), a &quot;Sargo&quot;-class submarine, was the only ship of the United States Navy to be named for the saury, a long-beaked relative of the flying fish found in the temperate zones of the Atlantic.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Saury&quot;′s keel was laid down on 28 June 1937 by the Electric Boat Company in Groton, Connecticut. She was launched on 20 August 1938, sponsored by Mrs. Mary E. Casbarian, wife of James Paul Casbarian, who headed the U.S. Navy&#x27;s Ships&#x27; Names and Sponsors Office, and commissioned on 3 April 1939.

==Pre-World War II service==

Following commissioning, &quot;Saury&quot; conducted tests in the New London, Connecticut, area and as far south as Annapolis, Maryland, before visiting New York City in late April 1939 for the 1939 New York World&#x27;s Fair. In mid-May 1939, she conducted tests with experimental periscopes, then prepared for her shakedown cruise which, between 26 June and 26 August, took her from Newfoundland to Venezuela and the Panama Canal Zone and back to southern New England. In September, she entered the Portsmouth Navy Yard in Kittery, Maine, for post-shakedown overhaul.

After overhaul and final trials, &quot;Saury&quot; got underway on 4 December for the West Coast. On 12 December, she transited the Panama Canal and, nine days later, joined Submarine Division (SubDiv) 16 of Submarine Squadron (SubRon) 6, at San Diego, California. Upkeep, exercises, and services as a target for surface units took her through March 1940. In April, she sailed west to participate in Fleet Problem XXI, an eight-phased problem simulating an attack on the defense of the Hawaiian area and the destruction of one fleet prior to the concentration of another.

Based afterward at Pearl Harbor, &quot;Saury&quot; conducted exercises in the Hawaiian Islands and as far west as Midway Island until she returned to the West Coast in September for overhaul at Mare Island. From March to October 1941, she operated out of both Pearl Harbor and San Diego, California, then departed the former for her new base, Cavite, Philippines.

==First war patrol==

Assigned to SubDiv 21, SubRon 2, after 1 June 1941, &quot;Saury&quot; arrived in Manila Bay in mid-November. On 8 December (7 December east of the International Date Line), she got underway for her first war patrol.

Clearing Manila Bay, &quot;Saury&quot; moved north to search for and intercept ships of the Japanese invasion force. Lack of emergency identification systems and radio problems complicated her job. During the next two weeks, she patrolled near Vigan and along a north–south line at longitude 120 degrees East. Then, on 21 December, she was ordered into Lingayen Gulf in response to a report from submarine of Japanese forces there.

Prior to dawn on 22 December, she took up patrol duties off San Fernando in the northern approaches to the gulf, and moved south. At 0411, she sighted an enemy destroyer and, at 04:24, she fired. Although the &quot;fish&quot; headed &quot;right at&quot; the destroyer, there was no explosion. At 04:26, a second destroyer appeared; and, the hunter became the hunted. &quot;Saury&quot; commenced evasive tactics in the relatively shallow waters of the gulf. Depth charges were dropped, but none within of the submarine. &quot;Saury&quot; continued on evasive courses, working her way to the northwest and out of the destroyer-patrolled area. By noon, she was clear. After dark, she moved back into the gulf, past the enemy patrol line between San Fernando and Cape Bolinao.

At about 02:10 on 23 December, an enemy destroyer sighted &quot;Saury&quot;. The submarine went to . By 02:16, three depth charges had exploded within . Two more depth charges followed, but &quot;Saury&quot; escaped and continued to hunt for targets. Early afternoon brought more depth charging, but &quot;Saury&quot; was not damaged. On 24 December, she sighted a transport, running fast and very close in shore. The submarine was unable to close and attack.

That evening brought a change in orders; and, in preparing to clear the area, &quot;Saury&quot; found herself between two enemy ships. She headed out &quot;playing tag with enemy destroyers all night&quot;. The next evening, she was again closed by an enemy destroyer. She went to and evaded the enemy&#x27;s depth charges. On the night of 27–28 December, she interrupted battery charging to avoid a division of enemy destroyers. On 1 January 1942, she sighted an enemy convoy, but was unable to close the range. On 8 January, she received orders to proceed to the Netherlands East Indies.

Moving south, &quot;Saury&quot; patrolled the Basilan Strait area on 11 and 12 January. By then, Tarakan had fallen and the submarine headed south to patrol the enemy&#x27;s Davao-Tarakan line. By 16 January, she was east of the Tarakan lightship; and, on 18 January, she crossed the equator into the southern latitudes.

On 19 January, the Japanese landed at Sandakan in North Borneo, and &quot;Saury&quot; arrived at Balikpapan to fuel and provision. The next day, the submarine departed, fueled but not provisioned. After patrolling toward Cape William, Sulawesi (Celebes), she took up station in the approaches to Balikpapan.

==Second war patrol==

On 23 January 1942, as other Allied units moved into Makassar Strait to delay the Japanese, &quot;Saury&quot; shifted north to the Koetai River Delta (Mahakam) in hopes of impeding enemy shipping moving south to Balikpapan. On the morning of 24 January, she was illuminated, forced to go deep, and was unable to attack.

After the Japanese took Balikpapan, &quot;Saury&quot; was ordered to patrol off Cape William. On 27 January, she moved toward Java. On 30 January, she met a Dutch patrol vessel off Meinderts Reef, then proceeded through Madura Strait to Surabaya (Soerabaja).

On 9 February, as the Japanese were taking Makassar, &quot;Saury&quot; departed Surabaya for her second war patrol. The submarine headed east to patrol along the north coasts of the Lesser Soendas. On 13 February, she headed north-northwest for a three-day patrol between Kabaena and Salajar off the Sulawesi coast. From there, she moved southwest to patrol the entrance to Lombok Strait. On the night of 19 and 20 February, she received word of the Japanese landing on Bali; sighted her first enemy ships of the patrol; and commenced 18 hours of submerged evasive tactics to avoid enemy destroyers&#x27; depth charges. On 24 February, she shifted northward to an area southeast of Sepandjang Island where she sighted and attacked, unsuccessfully, an enemy convoy.

From 26 February to 8 March, &quot;Saury&quot; patrolled from Meinderts Reef to Kangean Island, the eastern entrance to Madura Strait. However, the Japanese moved on Surabaya from the north and west. Batavia and Surabaya fell. On 9 March, &quot;Saury&quot; began making her way to Australia. The submarine arrived at Fremantle on 17 March. Her torpedoes, Mark 14s, had not damaged the enemy.

==Third war patrol==

On 28 April 1942, &quot;Saury&quot; cleared Fremantle for her third war patrol, but, three days later, a crack in the after trim tank caused her to return to Australia. On 7 May, she again departed Fremantle and headed north. By 14 May, she was off Timor; and, by 16 May, she was in the Flores Sea, en route to the Banda Sea and the eastern Sulawesi (Celebes) coast. On 18 May, off Wowoni, she fired three torpedoes at an enemy cargo-passenger ship without effect. She remained in the area for two days to intercept enemy traffic to Kendari; then moved north to hunt in Greyhound Strait and the Molucca Passage. On 23 and 24 May, she was off Kema, whence she rounded North Cape to patrol off Manado on the tip of northern Sulawesi.

On 26 May, &quot;Saury&quot; commenced hunting in the eastern Celebes Sea. On 28 May, she sighted and fired on a merchantman which had been converted into a seaplane carrier, but again was unsuccessful.

On 8 June, the submarine turned south and began retracing her route through the Molucca Passage and Greyhound Strait. From 12 to 14 June, she again patrolled off Kendari. On 15 June, she searched Boeton Passage; then moved into the Flores Sea, whence she headed via Timor for Australia. &quot;Saury&quot; returned to Fremantle on 28 June.

On 2 July, she sailed for Albany, where tests were to be conducted on the Mark 14 torpedoes. On 18 July, &quot;Saury&quot; launched four torpedoes at a net 850 to away. They were set for ten feet. The first passed through an area from which the net had been torn during the night. The other three penetrated the net at .

From 23 to 25 July, &quot;Saury&quot; escorted submarine tender back to Fremantle, then prepared for her fourth war patrol, which would take her back to the Philippines.

==Fourth war patrol==

Sailing at the end of the month, &quot;Saury&quot; transited Lombok Strait on 6 August 1942 and, by 16 August, was running up the Iloilo-Manila sea lane. On 17 August, she investigated Ambulong Strait and Mangarin Bay. On 18 August, she moved up the Mindoro Coast to Cape Calavite, whence she took up station west of Corregidor.

On 20 August, the submarine moved into the presumed enemy convoy route. The next day, she sighted and attempted to close a tanker; then shifted her patrol to a line five miles (8 km) off the coast.

On 24 August, the submarine again closed Manila Bay. At 06:45, she sighted masts; but heavy rain soon moved in and obscured the target. At 09:52, she launched two torpedoes. Her periscope began vibrating, hindering visibility and precluding the firing of two more torpedoes. At 09:54, an explosion was heard and the target, a small tanker, was seen to take on a five-degree list to port. &quot;Saury&quot; proceeded to to avoid detection by enemy air patrol units. At about 10:47, a bomb exploded close by the submarine. Depth charges followed and, at 11:50 and 11:52, two more bombs exploded.

The hunt for the submarine continued through the afternoon. At 18:10, the sounds of propellers and pinging died out. At 19:21, &quot;Saury&quot; surfaced, started recharging and headed out to sea on her three available engines. An hour later, she was sighted by an enemy destroyer, which closed in fast. &quot;Saury&quot; submerged, and her elusive tactics were again successful.

The next night, she sighted another enemy warship, a destroyer or a torpedo boat. The submarine, badly in need of a charge, did not attack. 29 August brought extremely poor weather. On 31 August, she sighted a hospital ship. On 3 September, the day she headed south, the weather began to clear.

On 7 September, &quot;Saury&quot; received orders to patrol off Makassar City and, while surfaced on the night of 11 September, she sighted a cargoman. At 20:58, she sent three torpedoes at the target. At 21:00, an explosion rocked the target. Flames enveloped the center of the ship. Its superstructure and deck cargo blazed. Eighteen minutes later, the target blew up. Japanese records identified the victim as the 8,606-ton aircraft ferry, &quot;Kanto Maru&quot;.

On 17 September, &quot;Saury&quot; cleared Lombok Strait and headed for Exmouth Gulf where she delivered excess fuel to a barge; thence continued on to Fremantle, arriving on 23 September.

==Fifth and sixth war patrols==

From 24 September to 18 October 1942, she underwent upkeep and repairs. She then shifted to Brisbane, whence she departed on 31 October for her fifth war patrol. Her 27-day patrol was conducted off western and northern New Britain, where she had 27 contacts, was able to develop four, and fired 13 torpedoes, of which only one was a possible hit.

On 21 December, &quot;Saury&quot; arrived at Pearl Harbor and, on 29 December, she moored at Mare Island. During her ensuing overhaul, she received a bathythermograph and a high periscope.

&quot;Saury&quot; returned to Pearl Harbor on 16 April 1943 and, on 7 May, she departed for her sixth war patrol which would take her into the East China Sea to operate off the northern Ryukyu Islands and in the coastal waters of Kyūshū. During the patrol, she would also test the effectiveness of the high periscope in daytime attacks and the usefulness of the bathythermograph in locating thermal layers in which to hide.

On 11 May, &quot;Saury&quot; topped off on fuel and lubricating oil at Midway Island, then continued west. On 19 May, she ran into the edges of a typhoon. On 20 May, &quot;the bottom dropped out of the barometer&quot;, but the next day, the storm abated. On 25 May, the submarine entered her assigned area and headed toward Amami Ōshima, a naval base some south of the industrial port of Kagoshima on southern Kyūshū.

Patrolling to the west of the island, &quot;Saury&quot; sighted her first enemy &quot;maru&quot; soon after 09:00 on 26 May; but the ship was too distant to catch. About an hour later, she abandoned the approach; then sighted a five-ship convoy on the port quarter. At 10:30, she fired tubes one, two, and three. One minute and 44 seconds later, a torpedo exploded against the stern of a transport. Nine seconds after that, another hit broke the target&#x27;s back and sent debris high into the air. The 2,300-ton &quot;Kagi Maru&quot; went under. At 10:34, &quot;Saury&quot; went deep. By 10:38, nine depth charges had been dropped, but none was close.

On the afternoon of 28 May, &quot;Saury&quot;, patrolling on the surface with her high periscope in operation, sighted the masts of a steamer and moved to intercept. Fourteen minutes later, at 16:43, she submerged. At 17:24, she launched four torpedoes at the target, the unescorted, empty, 10,216-ton tanker, &quot;Akatsuki Maru&quot;. Three missed, one hit. The tanker&#x27;s speed had been underestimated. The tanker dropped two depth charges. &quot;Saury&quot; fired six more torpedoes. Four scored and the tanker went under.

In the late afternoon of 29 May, &quot;Saury&quot;, again on the surface and using the high periscope, sighted smoke about fourteen miles (21 km) off. At 19:13, she submerged and began tracking a convoy of four cargo ships and three tankers. At 20:58, she surfaced and attacked. Japanese records show that she sank &quot;Takamisan Maru&quot;, 1,992 tons, and &quot;Shoko Maru&quot;, 5,385 tons.

On 30 May, &quot;Saury&quot; headed back to Midway Island. On 7 June, her number four main engine went out of commission. The next day, she arrived at Midway; and, on 13 June, she moored at Pearl Harbor for repairs and refit.

==Seventh war patrol==

A month later, on 13 July 1943, the submarine departed Hawaii on her seventh war patrol. On 21 July, her number four main engine again went out of commission, and remained out for the duration of the patrol. Poor weather then slowed her westward progress still further; and, on the night of 30 July, while halfway between Iwo Jima and Okinawa, she made her first contact of the patrol.

The contact was made by radar at about 22:25. &quot;Saury&quot; set a course to intercept the targets, two large warships and a destroyer. At 03:03 on 31 July, &quot;Saury&quot; submerged. At 03:25, she turned to attack; losing, regaining, losing, and then regaining depth control. By then, the targets had passed firing bearing. A few seconds later, at 03:38, the sound operator reported a bearing of 180 degrees relative. Almost simultaneously, the periscope revealed a destroyer with a zero degree angle on the bow. The commanding officer ordered &quot;Saury&quot; deep. A few seconds later, two jolts shook &quot;Saury&quot;. She took on a five-degree list to port. She continued to go deeper, then retired to the east. No depth charges were heard. &quot;Saury&quot; remained at 175 to all day. At 20:20, she surfaced. Her periscope shears were bent 30 degrees from the vertical to starboard. All equipment mounted therein was damaged. Both periscopes and both radars were out of commission. &quot;Saury&quot; had been blinded.

Temporary repairs were made; and, at 04:03 on 1 August, &quot;Saury&quot; headed home, arriving at Midway Island on 8 August and at Pearl Harbor on 12 August. Her patrol had ended before she had reached her assigned area but she was credited with causing damage to an enemy destroyer.

During repair and refit, &quot;Saury&quot; was given an enlarged conning tower, new periscope shears, and new radar equipment. Her number-four engine was completely overhauled. On 4 October, she was ready for sea.

==Eighth and ninth war patrols==

On her eighth and ninth war patrols, 4 October to 26 November 1943 and from 21 December 1943 to 14 February 1944, &quot;Saury&quot; inflicted no damage. Much of the latter patrol was spent in fighting extremely bad weather in the East China Sea, during which proper navigational positions were unobtainable. At the end of that patrol, one day out of Midway, she was swamped by an oversized swell while her hatches were open. The wave overtook &quot;Saury&quot; from the quarter, pushed her over to a 40-degree list to port; turned her 140 degrees from her course; and sent green water through the conning tower hatch and main induction. Electrical equipment grounded out and small fires were started, but were quickly extinguished. Auxiliary power was restored in half an hour, but repairs to main control required almost a full day, and repairs to the master gyro took even longer.

&quot;Saury&quot; arrived at Pearl Harbor from Midway Island on 21 February and continued on to Mare Island, where she underwent overhaul and re-engining during March and April. On 16 June, she returned to Pearl Harbor, and on 29 June, she departed on her tenth war patrol.

==Tenth and eleventh war patrols==

On 3 July 1944, she topped off at Midway Island. On 5 July, a cracked cylinder liner forced her back to Midway for repairs, and, on 6 July, she headed out again. On 11 July, another cylinder liner cracked, but she continued on toward her assigned area, San Bernardino Strait in the Philippines, which she entered on 18 July.

On 4 August, the submarine shifted north in hope of better hunting, and, on 6 August, she sighted an unescorted freighter. However, the glassy sea, unlimited visibility, and enemy, land-based, patrol planes combined against her, and she broke off the attack. Four days later, she departed the area, arriving at Majuro on 23 August.

From 20 September to 29 November 1944, &quot;Saury&quot; conducted her eleventh and last war patrol. She patrolled in the Nansei Shoto area from 20 September to 4 November, rescuing a downed pilot, but sinking no enemy ships as she hunted in the wake of the fast carrier forces. After stopping at Saipan from 5 to 10 November, she proceeded on the second phase of the patrol, an antipatrol vessel sweep north of the Bonin Islands. Extremely poor weather again interfered, but on 18 November, she damaged a tanker. On 29 November, she returned to Pearl Harbor.

==Fate==

For the remainder of the war, &quot;Saury&quot; served in the Hawaiian area as a target and training submarine. On 19 August 1945, she sailed for San Francisco, California, and inactivation. &quot;Saury&quot; was decommissioned on 22 June 1946, and her name was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 19 July. She was sold and delivered to the Learner Company of Oakland, California, in May 1947, and was scrapped the following October.

It serves an inner city population of 700,000 in the London boroughs of Southwark and Lambeth, but also serves as a tertiary referral centre in certain specialties to millions of people in southern England. It is a large teaching hospital and is, with Guy&#x27;s Hospital and St. Thomas&#x27; Hospital, the location of King&#x27;s College London School of Medicine and one of the institutions that comprise the King&#x27;s Health Partners, an academic health science centre. The chief executive is Dr Clive Kay. It is also the birthplace of Queen Camilla.

==History==
===Early history===

King&#x27;s was originally opened in 1840 in the disused St Clement Danes workhouse in Portugal Street close to Lincoln&#x27;s Inn Fields and King&#x27;s College London itself. It was used as a training facility where medical students of King&#x27;s College could practice and receive instruction from the college&#x27;s own professors. The surrounding area there was composed of overcrowded slums characterised by poverty and disease. Within two years of opening, the hospital was treating 1,290 inpatients in 120 beds, with two patients sharing a bed by no means unusual. The main contractor for the new hospital was Lucas Brothers. It was one of the first hospitals to start nurse training, in 1856.

Pioneer of aseptic surgery Joseph Lister performed the first major elective surgery under strict antiseptic conditions in 1877. He helped propel the hospital to have a surgical unit comparable with the best in Europe.

In the first years of the 20th century, demographic changes saw a decrease in the number of patients requiring treatment in the centre of London, and an increase of patients from further afield – notably Camberwell, Peckham and Brixton which were then suburbs on the outskirts of London. Following an Act of Parliament in 1904, a foundation stone was laid for the new hospital, designed by William Pite, in 1909 at its present site at Denmark Hill, south of the River Thames. The move to Denmark Hill provided the hospital with a greenfield-site nearer to its patients. The building itself incorporated modern design principles to encourage adequate ventilation, used electric clocks throughout, contained only the second internal phone installation in the UK at the time, and generated its own power through the use of diesel engines.

Pre-clinical training of medical students remained the responsibility of King&#x27;s College London, whilst advanced medical training took place at the hospital under the auspices of a newly formed King&#x27;s College Hospital Medical School. 
During the First World War, a large part of the hospital was requisitioned by the War Office to create the 4th London General Hospital, a facility for the Royal Army Medical Corps to treat military casualties. A dental school was established at the same site in 1923. During this time most patients were still poor and highly vulnerable to contagious diseases such as tuberculosis. In 1937 the private Guthrie wing was established with a donation from the Stock Exchange Dramatic and Operatic Society for wealthier patients to enjoy less crowded wards. During the Second World War the hospital was used for treating casualties of air raids, and was fortunate never to sustain a major direct hit. The hospital was the birthplace of Queen Camilla in 1947.

===Modern history===
Following the creation of the National Health Service in 1948, the hospital was granted Teaching Hospital status. In 1974 the NHS re-organisation saw King&#x27;s become the centre for all health services management in its catchment area. The hospital&#x27;s medical school was reunited with King&#x27;s College in 1983 to form King&#x27;s College School of Medicine and Dentistry. A purpose-built medical education centre, the Weston Education Centre, was built in 1997 and contains a medical library as well as hosting conferences, symposia, and professional training events as well as containing public access computer rooms for students. In 1998 King&#x27;s College School of Medicine and Dentistry merged with the United Medical and Dental Schools (UMDS) of Guy&#x27;s and St Thomas&#x27;s Hospitals to form Guy&#x27;s, King&#x27;s and St Thomas&#x27;s School of Medicine, commonly abbreviated to &quot;GKT&quot;.

The Golden Jubilee wing, intended to host a number of outpatient clinics as well as therapy suites for speech and language, occupational therapy and physiotherapy, was procured under a Private Finance Initiative contract in 2000. The works, which were carried by a joint venture of Costain and Skanska at a cost of £50 million, were completed in 2002.

In December 2013 it was announced that a proposed merger with Guy&#x27;s and St Thomas&#x27; and South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trusts had been suspended because of doubts about the reaction of the Competition Commission.

The Trust took over the management of Princess Royal University Hospital in October 2013 after the dissolution of the South London Healthcare NHS Trust. Over Christmas 2013 8 patients there waited on trolleys for more than 12 hours for admission, the largest number of trolley waits in England.

==Facilities==
The hospital is situated mainly on Bessemer Road, which is completely contained within the hospital grounds. Although the classically-styled Hambleden Wing Entrance is still the official main entrance, the Golden Jubilee Wing Entrance about 100m to the north-east has become the de facto main entrance, due to it being directly opposite Caldecot Road (where pedestrians arrive from the Coldharbour Lane bus stops) and having the ambulance parking spaces in front of it. There is also the new walk-in A&amp;E Entrance on Bessemer Road (previously located on Denmark Hill), next to the Golden Jubilee Wing and the Denmark Wing entrance and Ambulance Admissions on Denmark Hill (there is no unaccompanied patient access between A&amp;E and the rest of the hospital), whilst on Bessemer Road is the Bessemer Wing Entrance and there is also the Cheyne Wing Entrance on an unnamed service road at the south-west of the main building.

The Trust was one of the first such organisations to introduce a comprehensive public Wi-Fi service, which is free of charge courtesy of the Charitable Trust.

A new outpatient unit with 48 consulting rooms and eight procedure rooms was built in 2022, with Premier Modula using offsite construction methods on a very constrained site.

==Location==
On the opposite side of the A215 (Denmark Hill) is the Maudsley psychiatric hospital, which has close links with King&#x27;s. The Institute of Psychiatry is nearby and many doctors at King&#x27;s collaborate with their academic colleagues in carrying out research in conditions such as Parkinson&#x27;s disease and Motor neurone disease. The Denmark Hill Campus of King&#x27;s College London is also on Denmark Hill although the main Strand campus is further along the 68 bus route at Aldwych. The nearest railway station is Denmark Hill railway station.

==Media==
The hospital features in Channel 4&#x27;s award winning documentary &quot;24 Hours in A&amp;E&quot;. The documentary focuses on the hospital&#x27;s accident and emergency department and is filmed using 70 different cameras strategically placed to capture the workings of the department without interference.
It was also the setting for Louis Theroux&#x27;s 2016 documentary &quot;Drinking to Oblivion&quot;.

<doc id="452085" wikidata="Q1053345" url="?curid=452085" title="Communication Theory of Secrecy Systems">
<text>&quot;Communication Theory of Secrecy Systems&quot; is a paper published in 1949 by Claude Shannon discussing cryptography from the viewpoint of information theory. It is one of the foundational treatments (arguably &quot;the&quot; foundational treatment) of modern cryptography. His work has been described as a &quot;turning point, and marked the closure of classical cryptography and the beginning of modern cryptography.&quot; It has also been described as turning cryptography from an &quot;art to a science&quot;. It is also a proof that all theoretically unbreakable ciphers must have the same requirements as the one-time pad. 

The paper serves as the foundation of secret-key cryptography, including the work of Horst Feistel, the Data Encryption Standard (DES), Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), and more. In the paper, Shannon defined unicity distance, and the principles of confusion and diffusion, which are key to a secure cipher.

Shannon published an earlier version of this research in the formerly classified report &quot;A Mathematical Theory of Cryptography,&quot; Memorandum MM 45-110-02, Sept. 1, 1945, Bell Laboratories. This report also precedes the publication of his &quot;A Mathematical Theory of Communication&quot;, which appeared in 1948.

<text>Isaac Beverly Lake Jr. (January 30, 1934 – September 12, 2019) was an American jurist and politician, who served as chief justice of the North Carolina Supreme Court.

==Early life==
I. Beverly Lake Jr. was born on January 30, 1934, in Raleigh, North Carolina, United States to I. Beverly Lake Sr. and Gertrude Bell. He attended Wake Forest Grammar and High School from 1940 to 1951. He earned the rank of Eagle Scout in 1949. He received the Distinguished Eagle Scout Award in 2006. Lake also served briefly in the United States Army from 1956 to 1958. He got a Bachelor of Science degree from Wake Forest University in 1955, and secured a Juris Doctor from Wake Forest University School of Law in 1960. 

==Political career==
===Early activities===
In the late 1960s, Lake entered politics. Between 1969 and 1976, Lake served as an appointed deputy attorney general for the state of North Carolina. He served two terms in the North Carolina Senate as a Democrat. A conservative, in his last session in the legislature he convinced the body to remove segregation academies from state oversight.

===1980 gubernatorial election===
In October 1979 Lake announced his intention to seek the Republican nomination in the upcoming 1980 North Carolina gubernatorial election. A few days later he officially switched his partisan registration from the Democratic Party to the Republican Party. He ran as the unsuccessful nominee against incumbent Governor Jim Hunt. While not campaigning on segregation, he refused to eschew his father&#x27;s politics, saying that he was &quot;proud of his public record&quot;.

===Judicial career===
From 1985 to 1986 Lake served as Governor James G. Martin&#x27;s legislative liaison. Lake ran for the North Carolina Supreme Court in 1990 but lost to incumbent John Webb, who he had attacked as being &quot;soft on crime&quot;. In 1992 Martin appointed Lake to the Supreme Court. He ran for election later that year but lost to Sarah Parker. In 1994 Lake re-contested the seat and defeated Parker with 55 percent of the vote. Along with Robert F. Orr, he became one of the first two Republicans elected to the bench.

He was elected as the court&#x27;s chief justice in 2000, defeating incumbent Henry Frye. The two maintained cordial relations and occasionally golfed together. In April 2002 the court ruled that legislative districts drawn by Democratic legislative leaders violated North Carolina&#x27;s constitution for not respecting county boundaries. Lake authored the majority opinion, writing that &quot;Enforcement of the [whole counties provision] will, in all likelihood, foster improved voter morale, voter turnout, and public respect for state government, and specifically, the General Assembly, as an institution.&quot;

While serving as chief justice, a series of high-profile wrongful convictions in North Carolina came to his attention. He reviewed several of the cases with his clerk and resolved that the criminal justice system required reform. In 2002, he convened a commission including defense attorneys, prosecutors, law enforcement officers to review how innocent people were convicted and how to exonerate them. The body released a study which led to the creation of a new government agency, the N.C. Innocence Inquiry Commission, in 2006. It was designed to review convictions and release persons found innocent. By North Carolina law, he had to step down in 2006, after his 72nd birthday. He was succeeded by then-Associate Justice Sarah Parker.

<text>Quiet storm is a radio format and genre of R&amp;B, performed in a smooth, romantic, jazz-influenced style. It was named after the title song on Smokey Robinson&#x27;s 1975 album &quot;A Quiet Storm&quot;.

The radio format was pioneered in 1976 by Melvin Lindsey, while he was an intern at the Washington, D.C. radio station WHUR-FM. It eventually became regarded as an identifiable subgenre of R&amp;B. Quiet storm was marketed to primarily upscale mature African-American audiences. It peaked in popularity during the 1980s, but fell out of favor with young listeners in the golden age of hip hop.

==History==

===Origins===
Melvin Lindsey, a student at Howard University, with his classmate Jack Shuler, began as disc jockeys for WHUR in June 1976, performing as stand-ins for an absentee employee. Lindsey&#x27;s on-air voice was silky smooth, and the music selections were initially old, slow romantic songs from black artists of the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s, a form of easy listening which Lindsey called &quot;beautiful black music&quot; for African Americans. The response from listeners was positive, and WHUR station manager Cathy Hughes soon gave Lindsey and Shuler their own show. The name of the show came from the Smokey Robinson song &quot;Quiet Storm&quot;, from his 1975 album &quot;A Quiet Storm&quot;. 

The song developed into Lindsey&#x27;s theme music which introduced his time slot every night. &quot;The Quiet Storm&quot; was four hours of melodically soulful music that provided an intimate, laid-back mood for late-night listening, and that was the key to its tremendous appeal among adult audiences. The format was an immediate success, becoming so popular that within a few years, virtually every station in the U.S. with a core black, urban listenership adopted a similar format for its graveyard slot.

Philadelphia’s WDAS-FM had begun a similar format in 1972, where Tony Brown hosted “The Extrasensory Connection.” That program was renamed to “The Quiet Storm” in 1976, and is still on the air. 

In the San Francisco Bay Area, KBLX-FM expanded the night-time concept into a 24-hour quiet storm format in 1979. In the New York tri-state late night market, Vaughn Harper deejayed the quiet storm graveyard program for WBLS-FM which he developed with co-host Champaine in mid-1983. In 1993, Harper took ill and Champaine continued the program as Quiet Storm II. 

Following in the footsteps of KBLX, Lawrence Tanter of KUTE in Greater Los Angeles changed his station to an all-day quiet storm format from January 1984 until September 1987, playing &quot;a hybrid that incorporates pop, jazz, fusion, international, and urban music&quot;. Addressing the misconception that quiet storm was only for blacks, Tanter said his listenership was 40% black, 40% white, and 20% other races. WLNR-FM in Chicago also changed in August 1985 to a 24-hour quiet storm program called &quot;The Soft Touch&quot;, featuring more instrumental music and even straight-ahead jazz, a mix which sales manager Gregory Brown described as &quot;not so laid-back&quot; as other quiet storm shows. A notable feature of WLNR was that the four regular deejays were women.

==Success==
Because of the popularity of his show, Lindsey saw his annual salary increase from $12,000 in 1977 to more than $100,000 in 1985 (). After signing a million-dollar, five-year contract with rival Washington DC station WKYS, he left WHUR at the end of August 1985, continuing the quiet storm format on WKYS for five years starting in November with a show called &quot;Melvin&#x27;s Melodies&quot;. Part of Lindsey&#x27;s original style was to mix different decades of music together, for instance playing a Sarah Vaughan ballad in between more modern numbers.

Lindsey died of AIDS in 1992 at the age of 36, but the quiet storm format he originated remains a staple in American radio programming. WHUR radio still has a quiet storm show, and many urban, black radio stations still reserve their late-night programming slots for quiet storm music. WHUR operator Howard University has registered &quot;Quiet Storm&quot; as a trademark for &quot;entertainment services, namely, a continuing series of radio programs featuring music&quot;.

Hughes later built on the success of WHUR&#x27;s quiet storm format to found Radio One, a broadcasting company aimed at African Americans.

==Characteristics==
Quiet storm was most popular as a programming niche with listeners from the mid-1970s to the early 1990s. During this era, it promoted a noticeable shift in the sound of R&amp;B of the time. Quiet storm songs were in most cases devoid of any significant political commentary and maintained a strict aesthetic and narrative distance from issues relating to black urban life. Quiet storm appropriates R&amp;B and soul &quot;slow jams&quot; and recontextualizes them into rotations with their peers and predecessors.

Music journalist Jason King wrote, &quot;Sensuous and pensive, quiet storm is seductive R&amp;B, marked by jazz flourishes, &#x27;smooth grooves,&#x27; and tasteful lyrics about intimate subjects. As disco gave way to the &#x27;urban contemporary&#x27; format at the outset of the 1980s, quiet storm expanded beyond radio to emerge as a broad catchall super-genre.&quot;

Ben Fong-Torres of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; called quiet storm a &quot;blend of pop, jazz fusion, and R&amp;B ballads—all elegant and easy-flowing, like a flute of Veuve Clicquot champagne.&quot;

=== Gender and sexuality ===
For some, the conception of quiet storm represented a shift in the gendered and sexualized musical landscapes of R&amp;B and soul. Music journalist Eric Harvey said that within the quiet storm genre, artists such as Luther Vandross were able to push the boundaries of gender normativity in both their sound and lyricism.  Author Jason King said that through the genre and his music more generally, &quot;Vandross toys with dominant conventions of male sexuality without engaging in androgyny or any explicit forms of traditionally feminine embodiment.&quot; 

Given the sensuality and &quot;domesticity&quot; that the genre became recognized for, artists, particularly men, seemed to be awarded much more freedom in regards to expression of gender and sexuality, as opposed to what were viewed as more &quot;masculine&quot; genres. Harvey went on to say: &quot;This is one of the most important and overlooked aspects of the Quiet Storm format, and something that Vandross did so well: embrace a male form of domestic sensuality, a musical ideal previously exclusive to women.&quot;

=== Musical escape ===
Quiet Storm emerged at a time when the US Black middle-class population was growing and the divide between the Black rich and poor was widening. &quot;The black suburban population doubled between 1970 and 1986, and the number of blacks attending college increased 500 percent between 1960 and 1977.&quot; Quiet Storm was an escape from politics and friction; it reassured Black communities with the feeling of stability and normalcy.

==Radio==
In the 1990s, Canadian adult contemporary station CFQR-FM in Montreal aired a &quot;Quiet Storm&quot; program featuring new-age music. At least two non-commercial FM stations, the community-based WGDR in Plainfield, Vermont, and its sister station, WGDH in Hardwick, Vermont (both owned by Goddard College), have been broadcasting a weekly, two-hour &quot;Quiet Storm&quot; program since 1998—a 50-50 mix of smooth jazz and soft R&amp;B, presented in &quot;Triple-A&quot; (Album Adult Alternative) style, with a strong emphasis on &quot;B&quot; and &quot;C&quot; album tracks that most commercial stations often ignore.

In 2007, Premiere Radio Networks launched a nationally syndicated nightly radio program based upon the quiet storm format, known as &quot;The Keith Sweat Hotel&quot;. That program, in edited form, broadcasts under the Quiet Storm name (as &quot;The Quiet Storm with Keith Sweat&quot;) on WBLS in New York City.

<doc id="452089" wikidata="Q7422675" url="?curid=452089" title="Sarah Parker">
<text>Sarah Elizabeth Parker (born August 23, 1942) is an American judge who served as the chief justice of the North Carolina Supreme Court from February 2006 until August 2014.

==Education and career==
Born in Charlotte, North Carolina, Parker attended Meredith College, graduated from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill with an Education degree and served with the Peace Corps in Turkey from 1964 to 1966 before returning to Chapel Hill to earn a J.D. degree (1969). After working in private law practice for 15 years, Parker was named by Governor Jim Hunt to the North Carolina Court of Appeals in late 1984. Voters elected and re-elected her to that Court in 1986 and 1990.

Parker was elected by the people to the state&#x27;s Supreme Court in November 1992. After she lost a bid for re-election to a full term in 1994, she was reappointed to another seat by Hunt. She was elected to a regular 8-year term on the court in 1996. In 2004, Parker was elected to another eight-year term on the court, defeating John Tyson in the statewide judicial elections.

==Chief Justice==
On January 19, 2006, Governor Mike Easley announced that he was appointing Parker Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, to replace the retiring I. Beverly Lake Jr. Parker took the oath of office on February 6, becoming the third female Chief Justice of North Carolina&#x27;s highest court, after Susie Sharp and Rhoda Billings.

At the time of her appointment, former justice Bob Orr, a Republican and executive director of the N.C. Institute for Constitutional Law, was quoted in the &quot;Charlotte Observer&quot; calling Parker &quot;probably one of the more conservative justices that has been on the court in a good long while... She&#x27;s going to be reluctant to go out on a limb... My sense is that you would find very few cases that were close to the line where she favored criminal defendants.&quot;
Parker calls herself a moderate conservative. &quot;I tend to stick very closely to precedent and the intent of the legislature as expressed in the language of the statute,&quot; she said in that article.

Parker decided to run for a full term as chief justice in the November 2006 election. Although judicial races in North Carolina were non-partisan at the time, Parker was backed by the North Carolina Democratic Party.

On November 7, 2006, Parker was elected Chief Justice by a 2-to-1 margin over Judge Rusty Duke. She was inducted into the North Carolina Women&#x27;s Hall of Fame in 2011.

Parker stepped down from the court on August 31, 2014, after she reached the state&#x27;s mandatory retirement age for judges. Governor Pat McCrory appointed Mark Martin, the court&#x27;s senior Associate Justice, to replace her through the 2014 election.

<text>Robert F. &quot;Bob&quot; Orr (born October 11, 1946) is an American attorney, jurist, and politician who served as an associate justice of the North Carolina Supreme Court from 1995 to 2004. Orr was a Republican candidate for governor of North Carolina in 2008 North Carolina gubernatorial election.

== Early life and education ==
Orr was born in Norfolk, Virginia and spent his childhood in Hendersonville, North Carolina. After earning a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Orr served in the United States Army from 1968 to 1971. Orr returned to Chapel Hill to earn his Juris Doctor at University of North Carolina School of Law. 

== Career ==
After graduating from law school, Orr entered private law practice in Asheville, North Carolina. In 1986, Orr was appointed to the North Carolina Court of Appeals, and in 1994 was elected to the state&#x27;s highest court. From 1992 to 1993, Orr served on the United States National Park System Advisory Board. Orr formerly served as an adjunct faculty member at North Carolina Central University and at UNC School of Law.

On July 31, 2004, Orr retired from the state Supreme Court during the summer to head the newly formed North Carolina Institute for Constitutional Law.

In December 2006, &quot;The News &amp; Observer&quot; reported that Orr was exploring a run for governor of North Carolina in 2008. He made his candidacy official in late January 2007. He lost to Pat McCrory in the May 2008 primary. Orr then returned to the NC Institute for Constitutional Law. He stepped down from leading the institute in 2011 and joined the Poyner Spruill law firm. Gov. McCrory appointed him to serve as district attorney for the 24th district in 2014, filling a vacancy through the 2014 general election. He subsequently returned to the private practice of law. 

Orr was a delegate to the 2016 Republican National Convention. A supporter of John Kasich, Orr said he would not vote for his party&#x27;s nominee, Donald Trump, in the general election, telling a reporter that Trump would be &quot;a danger to the country.&quot; Uproar over Orr&#x27;s comments resulted in his credentials as a delegate being withheld which led him to leave the convention early.

Orr officially left the Republican Party in February 2021, changing his registration to unaffiliated.

<text>Morris Markin () (July 15, 1893 – July 8, 1970) was a Russian-born American businessman who founded the Checker Cab Manufacturing Company (which would later become the Checker Motors Corporation).

==Early years==

Born into a Jewish family in Smolensk, a city in western Russia, Morris Markin worked in a clothing factory during his young years. His determination and hard work got him promoted to a supervisor position by the age of nineteen, when he emigrated to the United States in November 1912. When he arrived at Ellis Island, he spoke no English and couldn&#x27;t afford to pay the bond required to enter the country. A janitor at the facility loaned him the twenty-five dollars he needed for the bond.

From New York City, Markin went to Chicago to live with his uncle. He held several jobs as an errand boy, the last for a tailor who taught him the trade. When the tailor died, Markin purchased the business on credit from the widow. He worked hard and saved enough money to bring seven brothers and two sisters to the States. Markin then teamed up with one of the brothers and opened a factory which made pants under government contracts during World War I. This company prospered after the war.

==Formation of Checker Cab==

In 1921, Markin entered the automobile business when he collected an auto body manufacturing company from an engineer named Lomberg. Markin had loaned fifteen-thousand-dollars to Lomberg earlier in an effort to keep the company afloat. When it failed, Lomberg returned to Markin to ask for more money. Markin refused and took over the company for his debt. He then picked up a failed automobile manufacturer, Commonwealth Motors, and with it the accountant, Ralph E. Oakland. Then, in a bold move, Markin purchased the defunct Handley-Knight chassis plant and the Dort body plant in Kalamazoo, Michigan. He moved his entire operation to Kalamazoo and on February 2, 1922 formed the Checker Cab Manufacturing Company.

In 1929, he purchased the Yellow Cab Company from John Hertz.

Markin died in 1970. His son David became president of Checker.

<text>Mark D. Martin (born April 29, 1963) is an American jurist who served as the chief justice of the Supreme Court of North Carolina from 2014 through 2019. He was appointed by North Carolina Governor Pat McCrory to become Chief Justice on September 1, 2014 upon the retirement of Sarah Parker. Martin was already running for the seat in the 2014 general election.

Prior to his tenure at the North Carolina Supreme Court, Martin also served on the North Carolina Court of Appeals, and the North Carolina Superior Court. At the time of his installation in 1999, he was the youngest Supreme Court Justice in North Carolina history. He was also the youngest person ever elected to the North Carolina Court of Appeals.

==Education==
Martin was born in Brussels, where his father, who served in the United States Air Force, was assigned to the U.S. Embassy. Martin received his J.D. degree, with honors, at the University of North Carolina School of Law and received a B.S. degree, summa cum laude, from Western Carolina University. He also has a Master of Laws (LL.M.) Degree in Judicial Process from the University of Virginia. During law school, Martin served as Editor-in-Chief of the &quot;North Carolina Journal of International Law &amp; Commercial Regulation&quot; and was inducted into the Davis Society.

==Career==
After graduating from law school, Martin served as a judicial law clerk to United States District Judge Clyde H. Hamilton. Following his clerkship, Martin practiced law at the McNair Law Firm in Raleigh, North Carolina. He then served as Legal Counsel to James G. Martin, the Governor of North Carolina, until his appointment in 1992 as Resident Superior Court Judge in Pitt County, North Carolina. From 1994 to 1999, Martin served as a Judge on the North Carolina Court of Appeals. He began serving as an associate justice of the Supreme Court of North Carolina in January 1999 and became the Senior Associate Justice in February 2006. He became re-elected to an eight-year term in November 2006.
In August 2014, North Carolina Governor Pat McCrory announced he would appoint Justice Martin as Chief Justice of the State Supreme Court. The appointment came as former Chief Justice Sarah Parker reached the state&#x27;s mandatory retirement age of 72. Martin then won his bid for a full term as chief justice on November 4, 2014.

Martin has served on the adjunct faculty at Duke University School of Law, University of North Carolina School of Law, and North Carolina Central University School of Law.

On January 25, 2019, Martin announced that he would retire from the North Carolina Supreme Court in February 2019. Governor Roy Cooper appointed Associate Justice Cheri Beasley as Martin’s successor. Martin took on a new role as Dean of the Regent University School of Law in Virginia Beach, Virginia, with this role becoming effective on March 1, 2019. In 2022, it was announced that he would be leaving Regent University to become the founding Dean of a new law school at High Point University.

In early January 2021, it was reported that Martin had participated in the attempts to overturn the 2020 presidential election during President Donald Trump&#x27;s last efforts to stay in power before the certification of Joe Biden&#x27;s Electoral College victory by telling the President that Vice President Mike Pence had the constitutional authority to block the certification by rejecting the Electoral College votes from multiple states. Pence ultimately did not accept Martin&#x27;s argument, instead certifying Biden as the winner of the election. In October 2024, &quot;The Intercept&quot; reported that Martin was also involved in helping to develop a lawsuit, based on the independent state legislature theory that each state legislature has absolute authority to choose presidential electors regardless of a state&#x27;s laws or constitution, that Republican state attorneys could file directly to the US Supreme Court. In December 2020, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton filed the suit, &quot;Texas v. Pennsylvania,&quot; which the Supreme Court declined to hear.

==Professional involvement==
Martin has served on a number of entities within the American Bar Association (ABA), including the Advisory Commission to the World Justice Project, the Executive Committee of the Appellate Judges Conference, the Coalition for Justice, the Commission on State Court Funding, the John Marshall Award Review Committee, and &quot;The Judges’ Journal&quot; Editorial Board. He served as Chair of the ABA Judicial Division Program Committee in 2007-08. Martin has also been active within the Appellate Judges Education Institute (AJEI), serving as both a member and Chair of the Program Planning Committee. He was elected chair of the ABA Judicial Division in 2013.

<doc id="452104" wikidata="Q653884" url="?curid=452104" title="Hispanic America">
<text>Hispanic America ( or ), historically known as [[Spanish America]] () or [[Castile (historical region)|Castilian]] America (), is the Spanish-speaking countries and territories of the Americas. In all of these countries, Spanish is the main language - sometimes sharing official status with one or more indigenous languages (such as Guaraní, Quechua, Aymara, or Mayan) or English (in Puerto Rico), and Latin Catholicism is the predominant religion.

Hispanic America is sometimes grouped together with Brazil under the term Ibero-America, meaning those countries in the Americas with cultural roots in the Iberian Peninsula. Hispanic America also contrasts with Latin America, which includes not only Hispanic America, but also Brazil (the former Portuguese America) and, by few definitions, the former French colonies in the Western Hemisphere (areas that are now in either the United States or Canada are usually excluded).

==History==
The Spanish conquest of the Americas began in 1492, up until 1531, during the reign of the catholic crown King Fernando V and Queen Isabella. Cristopher Columbus landed in the Caribbean islands during one of his expeditions with the Spanish crew looking for Asia. Once established in the &quot;New World&quot; the desire of the Spaniards to acquire wealth quickly developed into conquest, the idea of goods and wealth drew more Spaniards&#x27; attention to the new land. Conquerors like Hernan Cortes motivated the Spanish to conquer lands and establish their living in this &#x27;New World&#x27; and ultimately was part of a larger historical process of world discovery, through which various European powers colonized a considerable amount of territory and peoples in the Americas, Asia, and Africa between the 15th and 20th centuries. Hispanic America became the main part of the vast Spanish Empire. Napoleon&#x27;s intervention in Spain in 1808 and the consequent chaos initiated the dismemberment of the Spanish Empire, as the Hispanic American territories began their struggle for emancipation. By 1830, the only remaining Spanish American territories were the islands of Cuba and Puerto Rico, until the 1898 Spanish–American War.
== Impact ==

In general, Spanish colonies allowed mostly flexibility as long as people followed specific obligations and respected hierarchies and within these limits, Hispanic Americans were able to negotiate certain aspects of their living. In the early 1540s, once most of the territories were conquered, a lot of Spanish established themselves there for a living, and they also brought with them many African slaves and even free Africans to build on the economy of the &#x27;New World&#x27;. They created two separate Republics; &#x27;&quot;Republica de Españoles&quot;&#x27; and &quot;&#x27;Republica de Indios&quot;&#x27;. One was composed by the Spanish and their African slaves and the other one by Hispanic Americans.

There are theories that there were various Republics, others say there were none, however, these two existed and inside the Republica de Indios there were lots of villages that created their own too. Both &#x27;Republica de Indios&#x27; and &#x27;Republica de Españoles&#x27; lived apart from each other but did not have problems between them, it was just a way to separate hierarchies due to race and ethnicity. Spaniards created this separation as a similar government behaviour as the one back in their country, where only the top of the hierarchy didn&#x27;t work or pay. In this case, the &#x27;Republica de Españoles&#x27; was the top of the hierarchy and most took advantage of it to gain wealth without working just because of their ethnicity. Later on, in the later 1550s the Spaniards would send some churchmen and officials to incorporate into the &#x27;Republica de Indios&#x27; so that Christianity remained regardless of the ethnicity.

This idea of the two republics isolated the Hispanic people due to their race. It gave Spanish people wealth and power only because of their ethnicity, generating a social hierarchy that left Hispanic Americans in the lowest position at the level of the African slaves Spanish brought with them through the Atlantic slave trade, and them in the highest position. Spanish were always considered at the top of the hierarchy and both Indigenous Americans and Africans at the bottom. However, sexual relations between these groups developed into mixed raced populations called &quot;&#x27;Castas&quot;&#x27;. This partially threatened the hierarchy but Spanish maintained themselves at the top and maintained Hispanic Americans and Africans at the bottom but allowed &quot;Castas&quot; to position themselves somewhere in the middle. However people were often judged and categorised by their level of Spanish, their clothing and their diet as well as their relationship circles. This system entrenched racial inequalities that persisted long after the colonial period.

The independence of Hispanic American countries consisted mainly between 1808 and 1826, and was a fruit of the national people fighting for their territory as they were tired of Spanish taking advantage of their power and the huge inequality there was between the Republicas. The wars for territories consisted of many battles that were generally violent but ended up being effective for the Indigenous to gain their freedom and their lands back. However, it took long for some of the countries to re-establish economic stability in their territories since most of the wealth had been acquired by the Spanish and was no longer there.

==Demographics==
===Countries and territories===

===Largest cities===

===Ethnology===
The population of the Hispanic America is made up of the descendants of three large racial groups and their combinations:

• The Indigenous peoples of the Americas, descendants of Incas, Aztecs, Mayan, Taíno, and others.

• Those of European ancestry, mainly Spanish, and Italian.

• Africans who were brought over to Hispanic America during the Slave Trade.

Unlike in the United States, there were no anti-miscegenation policies in Latin America. Though still a racially stratified society there were no significant barriers to gene flow between the three populations. As a result, admixture profiles are a reflection of the colonial populations of Amerindians, Europeans and Africans. The pattern is also sex biased in that the Amerindian and African maternal lines are found in significantly higher proportions than Amerindian or African Y chromosomal lines. This is an indication that the primary mating pattern was that of European males with Amerindian or African females. According to the study, half the White populations of the Latin American countries studied have some degree of either Indigenous American or African admixture (MtDNA or Y chromosome). In countries such as Chile and Colombia almost the entire white population was shown to have some non-European admixture.

Frank Moya Pons, a Dominican historian documented that Spanish colonists intermarried with Taíno women, and, over time, these mestizo descendants intermarried with Africans, creating a tri-racial Creole culture. 1514 census records reveal that 40% of Spanish men in the colony of Santo Domingo had Taíno wives.

The most common combinations are:

• Mestizos, those of mixed ancestry.


===Languages===
Spanish is the official language in most Hispanic American countries, and it is spoken by the vast majority of the population. Indigenous American languages are widely spoken in Chile, Peru, Guatemala, Bolivia, Paraguay and Mexico, and, to a lesser degree, in Panama, Ecuador, Colombia, and Venezuela. In some Hispanic American countries, the population of speakers of indigenous languages tends to be very small or even non-existent (e.g. Uruguay). Mexico contains the largest variety of indigenous languages; there, the most spoken native language is Nahuatl.

In Peru, Quechua is an official language, alongside Spanish and any other indigenous language in the areas where they predominate. In Ecuador, while holding no official status, the closely related Quichua is a recognized language of the indigenous people under the country&#x27;s constitution; however, it is only spoken by a few groups in the country&#x27;s highlands. In Bolivia, Aymara, Quechua and Guaraní hold official status alongside Spanish. Guaraní, along with Spanish, is an official language of Paraguay, and is spoken by a majority of the population (who are, for the most part, bilingual), and it is co-official with Spanish in the Argentine province of Corrientes. In Nicaragua, Spanish is the official language, but on the country&#x27;s Caribbean coast English and indigenous languages such as Miskito, Sumo, and Rama also hold official status. Colombia recognizes all indigenous languages spoken within its territory as official, though fewer than 1% of its population are native speakers of these languages. Nahuatl is one of the 62 native languages spoken by indigenous people in Mexico, which are officially recognized by the government as &quot;national languages&quot; along with Spanish.

Other European languages spoken in Hispanic America include: English, by some groups in Puerto Rico and descendants of British settlers in Argentina and Chile; German, in southern Chile and portions of Argentina, Venezuela, and Paraguay; Italian, in Argentina, Venezuela, and Uruguay; Ukrainian, Polish, and Russian in Argentina; and Welsh, in southern Argentina.
Yiddish and Hebrew can be heard around Buenos Aires. Non-European or Asian languages include Japanese in Peru, Bolivia, and Paraguay; Korean in Argentina and Paraguay; Arabic in Argentina, Colombia, Venezuela, and Chile; and Chinese throughout South America.

In several nations, especially in the Caribbean region, creole languages are spoken. Creole languages of mainland Latin America, similarly, are derived from European languages and various African tongues.

The Garifuna language is spoken along the Caribbean coast in Honduras, Guatemala, Nicaragua and Belize mostly by the Garifuna people a mixed race Zambo people who were the result of mixing between Indigenous Caribbeans and escaped Black slaves. Primarily an Arawakan language, it has influences from Caribbean and European languages.

==Culture==
===Cuisine===
Hispanic cuisine as the term is applied in the Western Hemisphere, is a misnomer. What is usually considered Hispanic cuisine in the United States is mostly Mexican and Central American cuisine. Mexican cuisine is composed of mainly indigenous—Aztec and Mayan—and Spanish influences.

Mexican cuisine is considered intangible cultural heritage by UNESCO and can be found all over the United States.

In the United States, with its growing Hispanic population, food staples from Mexican cuisine and the cuisine from other Hispanic countries have become widely available. Over the years, the blending of these cuisines has produced unique American forms such as Tex-Mex cuisine. This cuisine, which originated in Texas, is based on maize products, heavily spiced ground beef, cheese and tomato sauces with chilies. This cuisine is widely available not just in the United States but across other countries, where American exports are found. In Florida, Cuban food is widely available. All of these Hispanic foods in the United States have evolved in character as they have been commercially americanized by large restaurant chains and food companies.

The cuisine of Spain has many regional varieties, with Mediterranean flavors based on olive oil, garlic, and tomatoes and due to its long Atlantic and Mediterranean coastlines, has been graced with a great variety and availability of seafood. In the inland communities of Spain, there is a long tradition of cured meat of different kinds, in addition to an abundance of dishes such as roasts and stews, based on beef, pork, lamb, and poultry. The European and Arab heritage of Spain is reflected in its food, along with cosmopolitan influences beginning in the many new ingredients brought in from the New World since the 16th century, e.g. tomatoes, potatoes, or chocolate, and the more modern tastes introduced from Europe since the 19th century, especially through French and Italian dishes. It is only in the last ten years that Hispanic American dishes have been introduced in Spain. In the United States and Canada, the number of Hispanic restaurants has become a growing trend, following the &quot;tapas&quot;-style restaurants fashion that first appeared in North America in the 1990s.

Cuban, Dominican, and Puerto Rican cuisines, on the other hand, tend to use a lot of pork and can depend heavily on starchy root vegetables, plantain, and rice. The most prominent influences on their Spanish culinary traditions were introduced by African slaves, and to a lesser degree, French influence from Haiti and later Chinese immigrants. The use of spicy chile peppers of varying degrees of strength used as flavour enhancers in Mexican tradition is practically unknown in traditional Spanish–Caribbean dishes. The cuisine of Haiti, a country with a Francophone majority, is very similar to its regional neighbors in terms of influences and ingredients used.

The Argentine diet is heavily influenced by the country&#x27;s position as one of the world&#x27;s largest beef and wine producers, and by the impact that European immigration had on its national culture. Grilled meats are a staple of most meals as are pastas, potatoes, rice, paella and a variety of vegetables (Argentina is a huge exporter of agricultural products). Italian influence is also seen in the form of pizza and ice cream, both of which are integral components of national cuisine.
Uruguayan cuisine is similar to that of Argentina, though seafood is much more dominant in this coastal nation. As another one of the world&#x27;s largest producers, wine is as much a staple drink to Uruguayans as beer is to Germans.

In Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Chile, potato dishes are typical since the potato is originally from this region. Beef and chicken are common sources of meat. In the Highlands is the &quot;cuy&quot;, a South American name for guinea pig, a common meat. Given the coastal location, both countries have extensive fishing fleets, which provide a wealth of seafood options, including the signature South American dish, ceviche. While potato is an important ingredient in the Highlands, Rice is the main side dish on the coast.

This diversity in staples and cuisine is also evident in the differing regional cuisines within the national borders of the individual countries.

===Symbols===
====Flag====
While relatively unknown, there is a flag representing the countries of Spanish America, its people, history and shared cultural legacy.

It was created in October 1933 by Ángel Camblor, captain of the Uruguayan army. It was adopted by all the states of Spanish America during the Pan-American Conference of the same year in Montevideo, Uruguay.

The white background stands for peace, while the Inti sun god of Inca mythology symbolizes the light shining on the Americas, and the three crosses represent Christopher Columbus&#x27; caravels, the &quot;Niña&quot;, &quot;Pinta&quot;, and &quot;Santa María&quot;, used in his first voyage from Spain to the New World in 1492. The deep lilac color of the crosses evokes the color of the lion on the coat of arms of the medieval Crown of Castile.

===Religion===
The Spanish and the Portuguese took the Latin Catholic faith to their colonies in the Americas, Asia, and Africa; Roman Catholicism remains the predominant religion amongst most Hispanic Americans. Membership in Protestant denominations is increasing, particularly in Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, Puerto Rico and other countries. In particular, Pentecostalism has experienced massive growth. This movement is increasingly attracting Latin America&#x27;s middle classes. Anglicanism also has a long and growing presence in Latin America.

<doc id="452108" wikidata="Q1503136" url="?curid=452108" title="Geography of North Carolina">
<text>The geography of [[North Carolina]] falls naturally into three divisions — the Appalachian Mountains in the west (including the Blue Ridge and Great Smoky Mountains), the central Piedmont Plateau, and the eastern Atlantic Coastal Plain. North Carolina covers and is long by wide. The physical characteristics of the state vary from the summits of the Smoky Mountains, an altitude of near seven thousand feet () in the west, sloping eastward to sea level along the coast and beaches of the Atlantic Ocean.

==Appalachian mountains==
The mountains of North Carolina may be conveniently classed as four separate chains: 

*The Great Smoky Mountains – also called the &quot;Smokies&quot;.
*The Blue Ridge Mountains – North Carolina&#x27;s largest mountain range, the Blue Ridge run across the state in a very tortuous course and often shoot out in spurs of great elevation over the surrounding terrain. The Black Mountains, a subrange of the Blue Ridge, are the highest mountains in the Eastern United States, and culminate in Mount Mitchell at 6,684 feet (2,037.3 m) above sea level.
*The Brushy Mountains – A much smaller and lower mountain range, the Brushy Mountains are located entirely within the state&#x27;s borders. Often called the &quot;Brushies&quot;, they divide, for the greater part of their courses, the waters of the Catawba River and Yadkin River. The Brushy Mountains begin at Hibriten Mountain in Caldwell County and terminate in Pilot Mountain and the Sauratown Mountains in Stokes County. The highest point in the Brushy Mountains is Pores Knob at 2,680 feet (817.4 m) above sea level.

Each of these mountain ranges is marked by distinct characteristics. The Smoky Mountain chain (as contrasted with the Blue Ridge) is more continuous, more elevated, more regular in its direction and height, and rises very uniformly from 5,000 to .

The Blue Ridge is composed of many fragments scarcely connected into a continuous and regular chain. Its higher summits range from 5,000 to nearly ; however, its average elevation is from 3,000 to . The eastern slopes of the Blue Ridge rise sharply from 1,500 to above the terrain to the east; to observers they often appear as a vast, lofty wall running across the state&#x27;s western horizon. 
The Brushy Mountain range presents, throughout the greater part of its course, a remarkable uniformity in direction and elevation, many of its peaks rising above , and a few rising above . 
The last, the Uwharrie range, sometimes presents a succession of elevated ridges, then a number of bold and isolated knobs, which often appear higher than they actually are, due to the relative flatness of the surrounding terrain.

The tallest of the Appalachian Mountains is Mount Mitchell. Mount Mitchell is also the tallest point east of the Mississippi River.
The section enclosed within these limits is in shape somewhat like an ellipse. Its length is about ; its average breadth is from . It is a high plateau, from the plane of which several high mountains rise, including the Roan, the Grandfather, and the Black. Between the mountains are scenic fertile valleys, plentifully watered by streams.

The mountains lie within the Appalachian–Blue Ridge forests ecoregion and are heavily forested. They often feature thick underbrush, except a few which have prairies on their summits, called balds.

==Piedmont==

The Piedmont plateau forms the central third of the state. The Piedmont is a hilly region and is the most urbanized and densely populated section, containing the state&#x27;s largest cities. Due to rapid urbanization over the last 30 years, a significant part of the rural area in this region has been transformed into suburbs. In particular, the cities of Charlotte and Raleigh have become major urban centers, with large, diverse, and rapidly growing populations. Elevations in the Piedmont vary from above sea level. Isolated mountain ranges are scattered here, mostly on the Western side, but few of them reach over 1,200 feet. The Piedmont lies within the Southeastern mixed forests ecoregion and has many forests. The Piedmont borders the Coastal Plain at the Fall Line. An important resource throughout the Piedmont is tobacco. The original inhabitants of the Piedmont were the Catawba Indians. Europeans started settling in this region around the 1700s.

Within the Piedmont region are the Uwharrie Mountains, which was named after a Native American tribe which once lived in the region. The Uwharries are North Carolina&#x27;s easternmost mountain range; they are the lowest mountain range in the state. The Uwharries begin in Montgomery County, North Carolina and terminate in the hills of Person County, North Carolina. The highest point in the Uwharries is High Rock Mountain, which is only above sea level. However, the Uwharries still rise several hundred feet above the surrounding terrain, which averages only above sea level.

==Coastal Plain==

The Coastal Plain is the largest geographic area of the state, and covers roughly 45% of North Carolina. The Coastal Plain begins along the fall line, a line that marks the boundary between metamorphic/igneous rocks of the Piedmont province (to the west) and sedimentary rocks of the Coastal Plain province (to the east). Rapids are common where rivers cross this line. The Fall Line extends through Fayetteville, then Raleigh, and finally through Henderson, North Carolina near the Virginia border. The topography at the fall line drops in an eastward direction; while noticeable, the drop is quite gradual and occurs over a width of . East of the fall line, most of the coastal plain is relatively flat, with sandy soils ideal for growing tobacco, cotton, soybeans, and melons.

The natural lands are those of the Middle Atlantic coastal forests ecoregion. The rivers of the coastal plain are much wider and deeper than those of the Piedmont or mountains, and flow more slowly. The coastal plain encompasses the two largest landlocked sounds in the United States; Albemarle Sound in the north and Pamlico Sound in the south. Pamlico Sound is larger than the state of Connecticut. The coastal plain is covered by thick forests of pines and other evergreens; due to the sandy soils it is difficult for many deciduous trees to grow.

The easternmost portion of the state contains the Outer Banks, sandy islands that do not have coral reefs to attach to and thus are constantly shifting their locations. The Outer Banks are known as the &quot;Graveyard of the Atlantic&quot; because numerous ships have been wrecked along their beaches and shoals due to storms and strong tides. The Coastal Plain is host to three capes: Cape Hatteras, Cape Lookout, and Cape Fear. Despite the fact that North Carolina has hundreds of miles of beachfront territory, due to the Outer Banks and swampland along the coast the state lacks a good natural harbor. As such, North Carolina never developed a major port city as did neighboring states such as Georgia (Savannah), South Carolina (Charleston), and Virginia (Norfolk). Wilmington, located up the Cape Fear River, and Morehead City located on the other side of the bridge from Atlantic beach crossing the Bogue Sound remain the state&#x27;s only two major ports; the Cape Fear river often has to be dredged to keep it open to large merchant marine ships. 

The Carolina Sandhills is a 10-35 mi wide physiographic region within the innermost part of the Atlantic Coastal Plain province. The northern extent of the Carolina Sandhills is located near Fayetteville in North Carolina, and the Carolina Sandhills extend south and southwestward into South Carolina and Georgia.

==River systems==


Seventeen major river basins have covered at least part of the state of North Carolina. These rivers can be broadly divided into three groups. In the extreme western part of the state, there are rivers that flow in a northwesterly direction, draining into the Gulf of Mexico through the Mississippi River. In the central part of the state, rivers flow generally southward into South Carolina before reaching the Atlantic Ocean. In the eastern part of the state, most of the rivers flow generally in an eastward or southeastward direction, before emptying into one of the sounds that separate the mainland of North Carolina from the Outer Banks. 

The divide between the Atlantic and Gulf watersheds, part of a larger divide known as the Eastern Continental Divide, lies not along the Smoky Mountains, the tallest in the state, but rather along the lower Blue Ridge Mountains to the east. The western slopes of the Blue Ridge form the headwaters of the French Broad and the Kanawha Rivers. Through the taller Smoky Mountains, these rivers pass through deep canyons known as water gaps. For example the Hiawassee River and its tributaries follow a series of canyons between Cleveland, Tennessee and Murphy, North Carolina, part of which can be followed driving along the Ocoee Scenic Byway.

The rivers of central North Carolina rise on the eastern slopes of the Blue Ridge. The two largest of these are the Catawba River and the Yadkin River, and they drain much of the Piedmont region of the state.

The major rivers of Eastern North Carolina, from north to south, are: the Chowan, the Roanoke, the Tar, the Neuse and the Cape Fear. Many of those rivers are navigable far inland, owing to their breadth as they traverse the low, flat Atlantic Coastal Plain in the eastern part of the state.
==Lakes==
Among North Carolina&#x27;s lakes are hundreds of elliptically-shaped lakes or ponds that are referred to as Carolina bays. These interesting and often ecologically-rich lakes occur in many other states but for some reason are highly concentrated in eastern North Carolina. Lake Waccamaw is the largest of the Carolina bays. 

While large, natural lakes are rare in North Carolina, excepting the Carolina bays in the eastern part of the state, there are many large reservoirs along the major river systems of the state. Among these are Lake James and Lake Norman on the Catawba River, Falls Lake on the Neuse River, Jordan Lake on the Haw River, as well as Gaston and Kerr Lakes along the Roanoke Rivers. Many of these reservoirs serve as water supplies for North Carolina&#x27;s urban areas, but also feature recreational facilities including boat ramps, fishing areas, and beaches.

==Climate==
The climate of North Carolina is mild and equable. This is due in part to its geographical position: midway in the Northern Hemisphere. Also, the high Appalachian chain offers, to some extent, a shield from cold winter winds of the northwest. On the ocean side, in winter, is the moderating influence of the warm Gulf Stream, the current of which sweeps along near its shores.

The result of these combined causes is shown in the character of the seasons. Fogs are frequent, especially during the summer; frosts do not occur until the middle of October; ice forms on raised surfaces at least once a winter; snows are frequently light, seldom remaining on the ground more than two or three days, except in the higher elevations. The average rainfall is about , which is pretty uniformly distributed throughout the year.

<text>Amir Ageeb or Aamir Ageeb (c. 1968 or 1969 – 28 May 1999) was a Sudanese who was killed while resisting deportation from Germany, leading to a lawsuit against the involved officers.

At Frankfurt Airport, Ageeb physically resisted the three Bundesgrenzschutz officers who escorted him onto Lufthansa Flight 588 travelling to Sudan on 28 May 1999. They restrained him with several ropes, handcuffs and bands; put a helmet on his head; leaned on his chest; and pushed his head between his knees, apparently all in accordance with procedures in use at the time. Ageeb suffocated and was found to be dead shortly after the aircraft took off.

The three officers were charged with voluntary manslaughter (, literally &#x27;bodily harm with fatality&#x27;) and found responsible for the death. Instead of the minimum sentence of one year, Judge Heinrik Gehrke imposed nine months probation, in order to avoid the officers losing their right to work in civil service. with a fine paid to the family of Aamir Ageeb of each. Gehrke criticised the policies of the asylum policy, comparing treatment of asylum seekers to that of the inmates at Abu Ghraib prison.

As a result, deportation procedures for Bundesgrenzschutz officers were changed, different helmets used, and deportations became more frequently suspended, especially in cases of violent resistance.

The incident contributed to protests against Lufthansa&#x27;s role in air deportations.

<text>Leroy &quot;Lonnie&quot; Jordan (born November 21, 1948, in San Diego) is an American musician and songwriter. He is a founding member of the American funk band War. Jordan had a number of roles over the years, acting as vocalist and playing guitar, piano, synthesizer, and percussion. He was among the first three people to join the group after its inception, having joined before the group adopted the name &quot;War&quot; (it had previously been known as &quot;the Creators&quot; and &quot;Nightshift&quot;), as well as being the group&#x27;s only remaining original member.

Jordan recorded as a solo artist with MCA in 1977 and Boardwalk in 1982. He has also recorded with Eric Burdon, Tanya Tucker, T. Rex and Los Lobos.
Jordan also made a record with two members of War, Harold Brown and B.B. Dickerson, &quot;The Other Side of War Warms Your Heart&quot; on Soufflé Records, which featured Bobby Womack on guitar. Lonnie Jordan is the only current member of War from the original lineup. Four other members created a new group called Lowrider Band. In 2017, Lonnie Jordan co-wrote and featured on vocals on the Alex Puddu album &quot;From the Beginning&quot; on three songs &quot;Runaway Boys&quot;, &quot;Nobody&quot; and &quot;Stormy Weather&quot;.

<text>The Condor Legion () was a unit of military personnel from the air force and army of Nazi Germany’s Wehrmacht which served with the Nationalist faction during the Spanish Civil War. The legion developed methods of strategic bombing that were used widely during the Second World War. The bombing of Guernica was the Condor Legion&#x27;s most infamous operation. Hugo Sperrle commanded the unit&#x27;s aircraft formations, and Wilhelm Ritter von Thoma commanded the ground element.

== Military aid to Spain ==
After the 17 July 1936 military coup in Spain began the Spanish Civil War, the Nationalists requested support from Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy. The first request for German aircraft was made on 22 July, for 10 transport aircraft. Adolf Hitler decided to support the Nationalists on 25 or 26 July, but was wary of provoking a wider European war. The Reich Air Travel Ministry concluded that Nationalist forces would need at least 20 Junkers Ju 52s, flown by Luft Hansa pilots, to carry the Spanish Army of Africa from Spanish Morocco to Spain. This mission became known as Operation Magic Fire (). To carry it out, a joint venture was created between the Spanish-German &quot;Spanish-Moroccan Transport Company&quot; (, HISMA) dummy corporation and the German Raw Materials and Goods Purchasing Company (). German involvement was hidden from the foreign and the economic ministries, and was funded with three million Reichsmarks.

The organisation and the recruitment of German volunteers was also kept secret. The first contingent (86 men) left Germany on 1 August 1936. Unaware of their destination, they were accompanied by six biplane fighters, anti-aircraft guns and about 100 tons of other supplies. Many believed that the German troops would train the Nationalists and not engage in active combat.

The volunteers were stationed at Tablada Airfield near Seville and, with the support of German air transport, began the airlift of Francisco Franco&#x27;s troops to Spain. Germany&#x27;s involvement grew in September to encompass the Wehrmacht&#x27;s other branches. Operation Magic Fire was renamed Operation Guido in November. The Kriegsmarine provided submarines in 24 October, also providing surface ships and co-ordinated movement of German supplies to Spain. German U-boats were dispatched to Spanish waters under the codename Ursula.
In the two weeks after 27 July, German transport moved nearly 2,500 Army of Africa troops to Spain. By 11 October (the mission&#x27;s official end), 13,500 troops, 127 machine guns and 36 field guns had been transported to mainland Spain from Morocco. Over that period, there was a transition from training and supply missions to overt combat. The operation commander, Alexander von Scheele, was replaced by Walter Warlimont. In September, 86 tons of bombs, 40 Panzer I tanks and 122 personnel were deployed in Spain. They were accompanied by 108 aircraft from July to October, divided between aircraft for the Nationalist faction and planes for German volunteers in Spain.

German air crews supported the August-to-October 1936 Nationalist advance on Madrid, and the successful relief of the Siege of the Alcázar on 27 September 1936. Ultimately, the initial phase of the Siege of Madrid was unsuccessful. Soviet air support for the Republicans was growing, particularly through the supply of Polikarpov aircraft. Warlimont appealed to Germany to increase its support. After Berlin&#x27;s recognition of Franco&#x27;s government on 30 September, German efforts in Spain were reorganised and expanded. The existing command structure was replaced with the Winterübung Rügen; military units already in Spain were formed into a new legion, which was briefly called the Iron Rations () and the Iron Legion () before Hermann Göring renamed it the Condor Legion (). The first German chargé d&#x27;affaires to Franco&#x27;s government, General Wilhelm Faupel, arrived in November and was told not to interfere in military matters.

===Motivation===
In the years after the Spanish Civil War, Hitler gave several possible motives for German involvement. They included providing distraction from German rearmament, preventing the spread of communism to Western Europe, creating a state friendly to Germany to disrupt Britain and France, and creating possibilities for economic expansion. Although the Nationalist offensive on Madrid was abandoned in March 1937, a series of attacks on weaker Republican-controlled areas was supported by the Condor Legion. Despite prolonging the Civil War, it helped distract the other Western powers from Hitler&#x27;s ambitions in Central Europe. The offensive on Biscay, a mining and industrial centre, helped to fuel German industry. In a speech at Würzburg on 27 June 1937, Hitler said that he supported Franco to gain control of Spanish ore.

Discussions about German objectives for intervention took place in January 1937. Germany was keen to avoid prompting a wider European war, which was a risk if it committed further resources to Spain. There was no consensus among German officials; Ernst von Weizsäcker of the German Foreign Office suggested that it was a matter of graceful withdrawal, and Göring said that Germany would never recognise a &quot;red Spain&quot;. A joint Italian–German agreement said that the last shipments would be made no later than early February.

It has been speculated that Hitler used the Spanish Civil War to distract Benito Mussolini from Hitler&#x27;s plans to annex Austria; the authoritarian, Catholic and anti-Nazi Vaterländische Front ran the government of Austria from 1933 to 1938, and had been allied with Mussolini. In 1934, the assassination of Austrian Chancellor Engelbert Dollfuss had given rise to Italian military assistance to prevent a German invasion.

A December 1936 communiqué from German ambassador to Rome Ulrich von Hassell said that Italy’s involvement in the Spanish Civil War kept it out of the Western powers&#x27; camp:

The role played by the Spanish conflict as regards Italy&#x27;s relations with France and England could be similar to that of the Abyssinian conflict, bringing out clearly the actual, opposing interests of the powers and thus preventing Italy from being drawn into the net of the Western powers and used for their machinations ... All the more clearly will Italy recognize the advisability of confronting the Western powers shoulder to shoulder with Germany.

==Military operations==
The Condor Legion originally consisted of the with three squadrons of Ju 52 bombers and the Jagdgruppe 88, with three squadrons of Heinkel He 51 fighters; the reconnaissance Aufklärungsgruppe 88 supplemented by the Aufklärungsgruppe See 88, an anti-aircraft group (the Flakabteilung 88); and the Nachrichtenabteilung 88 signals group. The anti-aircraft guns used by Flakabteilung 88 were the standard German anti-aircraft guns of the time: the 8.8cm Flak 18, 3.7cm Flak 18 and 2cm Flak 30. Overall command was given to Hugo Sperrle, with Alexander Holle chief of staff. Scheele became a military attaché in Salamanca. Also operational were two armoured units under the command of Wilhelm Ritter von Thoma, with four Panzer I tanks each.

The Nationalists were supported by German and Italian units and material in the Battle of Madrid, but its military situation remained poor for them. Under orders from Francisco Franco, German and Italian aircraft began bombing raids on the city. The Germans were keen to observe the effects of bombing and the deliberate burning of civilian sites on a city. Offensives involving German aircraft, and the bombings, were unsuccessful. Growing Republican air superiority became increasingly apparent, particularly the strength of the Soviet Polikarpov I-15 and I-16 aircraft, but historian Hugh Thomas described their armaments as &quot;primitive&quot;.

Faupel advocated the creation of a single German unit of 15,000 to 30,000 men in November and December 1936, which he believed would be enough to turn the tide of the war toward the Nationalists. Hans-Heinrich Dieckhoff said that this would be insufficient, and larger measures could provoke Spanish wrath. New aircraft were sent to the Condor Legion between late 1936 and early 1937, including Henschel Hs 123 dive bombers and prototypes of the Heinkel He 112 and Messerschmitt Bf 109; the latter was the most successful. The Heinkel He 111 was added to the bomber fleet, along with the Dornier Do 17 E and F types. Older aircraft were passed on to the Nationalists. By the end of 1936, about 7,000 Condor Legion personnel were in Spain.

German forces also operated in the Battle of Jarama, which began with a Nationalist offensive on 6 February 1937. It included German-supplied ground forces, including two batteries of machine guns, a tank division, and the Condor Legion&#x27;s anti-aircraft guns. Bombing by Republican and Nationalist aircraft, including Ju 52s from the Legion, created a stalemate and demonstrated the inadequacy of Legion aircraft when faced with superior Soviet-made fighters. Von Thoma requested Irish nationalist support for a tank advance at one point. The use of He 51 and Ju 52s and the Legion&#x27;s anti-aircraft guns in ground roles only partly mitigated the Nationalist defeat in the March Battle of Guadalajara. A joint Italian-German general staff had been set up in January 1937 to advise Franco on war planning. The defeat of a significant Italian force and growing Soviet superiority in tanks and aircraft led the Germans to support a plan to abandon the offensive on Madrid and concentrate a series of attacks on weaker Republican-controlled areas. Some concluded that motorised troops were less effective than they had been thought, and the inadequacy of the Italians as a fighting force had become apparent to the Germans.

===Biscay campaign===
The isolated area of Biscay, a predominantly-Basque region of northern Spain, was the most immediate target in what was called the War in the North. It was largely a Nationalist and Italian offensive, supported by a consistently re-equipping Condor Legion. The terrain was favourable, with planes coming over a range of mountains to the south which masked their entrance. Sperrle remained in Salamanca; Wolfram von Richthofen replaced Holle in January as deputy, and was in actual command. Since the Basque air force was limited, fighter aircraft were used in ground-attack roles rather than air-to-air combat. The Legion&#x27;s air force initially attacked the towns of Otxandio and Durango. Durango had no anti-aircraft defence, and only a few other defences. According to the Basques, 250 civilians died there on 31 March (including a priest, nuns and the congregation at a church ceremony). The Germans, because of their air raids, were hated. The Basque ground forces were in full retreat towards Bilbao through the town of Guernica, which was bombed on 26 April in one of the war&#x27;s most controversial attacks.

===Guernica===

In Operation Rügen, waves of Ju 52 and He 111 planes bombed and strafed targets in Guernica. The number of casualties is controversial, with perhaps 200 or 300 people killed; the Basques reported 1,654 dead and 889 wounded. Several explanations were given by the Nationalists, who blamed the attack on the Republicans, said that the attack was part of a prolonged offensive, or the Rentería bridge outside Guernica was the true target. The nature of the operation, however (including its formation and armaments), undermines the credibility of these explanations. Guernica was a clear target of the Condor Legion, rather than the Nationalists. The 11 July offensive against Bilbao was supported by Condor Legion ground units and extensive air operations, proving the legion&#x27;s worth to the Nationalist cause.

The first English-language media reports of the destruction of Guernica appeared two days after the attack. George Steer, a reporter for &quot;The Times&quot; who was covering the Spanish Civil War from inside the country, wrote the first full account. Steer&#x27;s reporting set the tone for much of the subsequent reportage, noting clear German complicity in the action. Three small bomb cases stamped with the German imperial eagle made it clear that the German position of neutrality in the war and the signing of a non-intervention pact were meaningless, and German forces were actively participating in combat. Steer&#x27;s report was syndicated worldwide, generating widespread shock, outrage and fear.

===Other campaigns===
The Condor Legion also took part in the Battle of Brunete, a Republican offensive designed to take the pressure off northern Spain where fighting was ongoing. The legion was sent from the north to reinforce a broken line. There were repeated raids by bombers and by fighters based in Salamanca on Republican armoured vehicles and, later, defensive positions. Despite Nationalist fears, Republican aircraft were ineffective compared with German aircraft; the Messerschmitt Bf 109 was superior to the I-15 and I-16 models used by Republican forces. The legion lost eight aircraft, but claimed 18 victories. German tactics improved after Brunete, particularly the &quot;en masse&quot; use of tanks by the Nationalists.

The Nationalists again focused on capturing northern Spain. The latest models of German test aircraft faced an outdated Basque air force which had some Russian planes. Heavy aerial bombardment by 200 Nationalist, German and Italian planes occurred far behind Basque lines in August 1937 and led to the fall of Santander after the 1 September battle. The battle in Asturias ended with the fall of Gijon on 21 October. A large amount of ammunition was used by the Legion, including a million machine gun rounds and 2,500 tonnes of bombs. Germany immediately began to ship its industrial production back to Spain. Sperrle argued repeatedly with Faupel against HISMA&#x27;s monopoly, and Faupel was replaced by Franco. Sperrle also returned to Germany, and was replaced by . After disagreements with Volkmann, Von Richthofen was replaced with Hermann Plocher in early 1938.
After the next major campaigns (Madrid and Barcelona), the Condor Legion was moved to Soria and began a week of strikes against Republican airfields. This move was halted by the Republican advance on Teruel and ensuing battle. The legion&#x27;s land and air forces were deployed in Bronchales. Poor weather resulted in few flights, and the town fell to Republican forces on 6 January. Up to 100 sorties a day were launched during the Nationalist&#x27;s counter-offensive through the Alfambra Valley. The Junkers Ju 87A was used for the first time in the advance on Teruel, which was retaken on 22 February. The continued Nationalist offensive on Aragon from April to June 1937, including the Battle of Belchite, involved bombing raids and the legion&#x27;s ground forces. The legion was switched to focus in the north, towards the Segre River, before moving south again after Nationalist successes. It moved its headquarters to Benicarló; single-engine planes operated from nearby airfields, and twin-engine planes from Zaragoza. Hitler&#x27;s words to his colleagues belied a change in attitude about the war in Germany; a quick victory was undesirable, and a continuation of the war would be preferable. German policy was to prevent a Republican defeat. Casualties were beginning to mount for the Legion andcombined with a resurgence in Republican air activitythe Nationalist advance stalled, perhaps because of the reluctance of German commanders to supply reinforcements in light of the emerging Czechoslovak crisis. Debates about the operation&#x27;s rising cost to the Germans — then about 10 million Reichsmarks a month — continued unresolved. The Legion&#x27;s materiel was exhausted.

Republican forces launched the last major offensive of the war, the Battle of the Ebro, on 24–25 July. Condor Legion reconnaissance units had noticed a troop build-up and warned Nationalist forces, but their warning went unheeded. Although the Republicans gained ground, they failed to gain control of Gandesa; 422 sorties by the legion (with around 70 aircraft operational) had a considerable effect. The rest of the battle saw a series of artillery attacks or air strikes, followed by a Nationalist ground advance. Tensions in Czechoslovakia and a pilot shortage in Germany led to the return of 250 pilots from the legion, about half of whom were bomber crews. Although trained Spaniards made up some of the shortfall, Volkmann complained to central command in Berlin and was recalled in September. During the 113-day battle, 10 legion aircraft were lost (some by accident) and 14 were badly damaged. The legion claimed about 100 Republican aircraft, one-third of those lost; five aircrew were killed, and six captured. Aid from Germany temporarily halted in mid-September. Germany and Nationalist Spain settled the issue of German interests in Spanish mines.

The Legion took a short break from active duty to receive new aircraft (including Bf 109Es, He 111Es and Js, and Hs 126As), which brought its strength to 96 aircraft — about one-fifth of the Nationalist force. Richthofen returned to Spain in overall command, with Hans Seidemann his chief of staff. That reinforcement may have been the most important intervention by a foreign side in the war, enabling a counterattack after the Battle of the Ebro. The legion primarily took part in operations against the remaining Republican air force in January and February 1939, with considerable success. After participating in parades in Barcelona and elsewhere and minor duties over Madrid, it was dissolved. The men returned on 26 May, the best aircraft were returned to Germany, and the rest of the equipment was bought by the new Spanish regime.

The Condor Legion claimed to have destroyed 320 Republican planes with aircraft (shot down or bombed on the ground) and to have shot down another 52 with anti-aircraft guns. It claimed to have destroyed 60 ships, including Spanish Republican Navy vessels. The legion lost 72 aircraft from hostile action, and another 160 from accidents.

===Maritime operations===
The Maritime Reconnaissance Staffel 88 () was the Condor Legion&#x27;s maritime unit under the command of Karl Heinz Wolff. Operating independently of the land-based division, it acted against enemy shipping, ports, coastal communications and occasionally inland targets such as bridges. It used floatplanes, starting with the Heinkel He 60, which began operating at Cadiz in October 1936. Missions started as reconnaissance, but after the move from Cadiz to Melilla in Spanish Morocco in December 1936, the focus shifted to attacks on shipping. It was again moved in February 1937 to Málaga, which was newly captured, and then to Majorca when Málaga proved unsuitable. In June, operations began to be expanded to allow attacks on all Republican ports as long as British ships were not present. There were 10 ships attacked in the second half of 1937, but the Norwegian torpedoes that were used proved ineffective, and strafing or bombing targets was used instead.

The arrival of Martin Harlinghausen (known as &quot;Iron Gustav&quot;) saw operations expand, and operations targeted Alicante, Almería, Barcelona and Cartagena. As naval activity declined, inland targets became more numerous, and night missions began. Activities in support of ground forces became the main focus of the unit until the end of hostilities. Both Wolff and Harlinghausen received the Spanish Cross in Gold with Swords and Diamonds. In total, eleven men were killed in action, and five others died due to accident or illness.

====Other operations====

Overtly, the Kriegsmarine was partly used to enforce the Non-Intervention Agreement from interfering in the war. However, the agreement was clearly broken by Germany. As a result, the German pocket battleship stood guard over Ceuta to prevent interference from Republican ships while Franco transported troops to the Spanish mainland. By mid-October, the German North Sea Group around Spain consisted of the pocket battleships &quot;Deutschland&quot; and &quot;Admiral Scheer&quot;, the light cruiser , and four torpedo boats. After the Germans claimed that &quot;Leipzig&quot; had been attacked by an unidentified submarine, it was formally withdrawn from international patrols.

Operation Ursula, named after the daughter of Karl Dönitz, involved a group of German U-boats active around Spain. It began on 20 November 1936, with the movement of the &quot;U-33&quot; and the &quot;U-34&quot; from Wilhelmshaven. Identification marks were obscured, and the whole mission was kept secret. Difficulties in identifying legitimate targets and concerns about discovery limited their operations. During their return to Wilhelmshaven in December, the Republican submarine &quot;C-3&quot; was sunk; the Germans claimed that the sinking resulted a torpedo fired by &quot;U-34,&quot; although the Republican enquiry claimed its loss to have been caused by an internal explosion. Their submarines&#x27; return marked the official end of Operation Ursula. However, further submarines seem to have been sent in mid-1937, but details of the operation are not known (although six are believed to have been involved).

===Abwehr===
The German Abwehr intelligence service, independent of the Condor Legion, was secretly involved in Operation Bodden and later played a part in the detection of the Operation Torch invasion fleet.

===Return to Germany===
The KdF fleet, including the MV Wilhelm Gustloff and seven other ships, were given secret orders on 20 May 1939 and diverted from their regular pleasure-cruise schedule to arrive in Vigo, Spain. They arrived on 24 May to pick up the legion, and departed on 26 May for a five-day voyage to Hamburg, Germany. They arrived to crowds, parades and ceremonies celebrating their success, with Hermann Göring and other high-ranking officials in attendance.

==Military gains==
===Training===

Many army leaders were hesitant to become involved in the conflict, and resisted a call from the Italian government for a transfer of ground troops to Spain. Luftwaffe involvement was not restricted, and it is commonly thought that its involvement in the Spanish Civil War was a proving ground for troops in World War II. That view is supported by the testimony of Hermann Göring when he was on trial in Nuremberg. Asked about the decision to use the Luftwaffe, Göring said:
When the Civil War broke out in Spain, Franco sent a call for help to Germany and asked for support, particularly in the air. One should not forget that Franco with his troops was stationed in Africa and that he could not get the troops across, as the fleet was in the hands of the Communists, or, as they called themselves at the time, the competent Revolutionary Government in Spain. The decisive factor was, first of all, to get his troops over to Spain. The Führer thought the matter over. I urged him to give support [to Franco] under all circumstances, firstly, in order to prevent the further spread of communism in that theater and, secondly, to test my young Luftwaffe at this opportunity in this or that technical respect. It was cited in Western media after German forces left Spain.

Dozens of Messerschmitt Bf 109 fighters Heinkel He 111 medium bombers and, after December 1937, at least three Junkers Ju 87 Stuka dive bombers first saw active service in the Condor Legion against Soviet aircraft. The Stuka&#x27;s first mission in Spain was in February 1938, and each aircraft played a major role early in World War II. The Germans realised that biplane fighters were quickly becoming less effective than newer monoplane designs. The Heinkel He 51 fighter, after many losses during the first twelve months of the war, was switched to a ground-attack role and later saw service as a trainer.

===Other units===
The Condor Legion included ground-combat units. Panzer crews operating Panzer I light tanks were commanded by Wilhelm Ritter von Thoma. The Germans also tested small numbers of 88 mm Flak 18 anti-aircraft artillery guns to destroy Republican tanks, fortifications and aircraft with direct fire. German involvement in Spain spurred development of the first air ambulance service for evacuation of wounded combatants.

===Technical advances===

One military innovation thought to have resulted from the conflict is the technical development of the Messerschmitt Bf 109. The V3 to V6 types entered service in Spain from operational trials around January 1937. They were joined by type C aircraft in spring 1938, with type Es first deployed in December of that year.

===Tactics===
In addition to combat experience, it is thought that strategic initiatives were first tested during Luftwaffe involvement in the Spanish Civil War. Legion commander in Spain Wolfram von Richthofen became a Field Marshal during World War II and served in high Luftwaffe positions, specialising in ground attacks. His units spearheaded offensives in Poland, France and the Low Countries and the Balkans, and in Operation Barbarossa.

Joint operations were emphasised. Close air support for Nationalist troops, attack bombing of Republican troop concentrations, and strafing were features of the war. The legion worked to maximise the fighting ability of the Nationalist air force and troops, the Italian CTV, and pilots from the Aviazione Legionaria (Legionary Air Force). German air ace Adolf Galland said that in focusing after World War II on lessons learned by the Germans from the conflict in Spain, the value of the lessons was exaggerated. Galland believed that the wrong conclusions were drawn by the German High Command, particularly regarding the Luftwaffe:
Whatever may have been the importance of the tests of German arms in the Spanish Civil War from tactical, technical and operational points of view, they did not provide the experience that was needed nor lead to the formulation of sound strategic concepts.

==Commemoration and re-evaluation==

Shame about the activities of the Condor Legion and its involvement in the bombing of Guernica have re-surfaced in Germany since its 1990s reunification. In 1997, the 60th anniversary of Operation Rügen, German President Roman Herzog wrote an apology on behalf of the German people and state to survivors of the raid. Herzog said that he wanted to extend &quot;a hand of friendship and reconciliation&quot; on behalf of all German citizens. The sentiment was echoed by members of the German Parliament who, in 1998, legislated the removal of all former Legion members&#x27; names from German military bases. The issue surfaced again in 2005 after media reports about the role of pilot Werner Mölders, who had volunteered to serve in Spain. Although he was not involved in the bombing of Guernica, it was decided by German Defence Minister Peter Struck that Mölders&#x27; name would be removed from the barracks at Visselhoevede and from association with Luftwaffe Fighter Wing 74 (Jagdgeschwader 74) based in Neuburg an der Donau. Until then, it had not been established that Mölders had flown as a Condor Legion volunteer before his death in 1941.

On 26 April 2017, the 80th anniversary of the Guernica bombing, the Madrid City Council announced that it had dismantled the Condor Legion mausoleum at the Cementerio de la Almudena. The mausoleum&#x27;s facade, removed at the request of the German embassy in Madrid, would be replaced with name plaques for the seven soldiers entombed there.

==Awards==
The Spanish Cross () campaign medal began to be awarded by the German authorities in seven classes on 14 April 1939. The clandestine nature of German activities in Spain meant that no awards were made until April 1939, at the end of German involvement in the conflict. The Spanish Cross complemented the Condor Legion Tank Badge, which was approved on 10 July 1939, and cuff titles were issued. Legionnaires also received a campaign medal struck by the Spanish authorities to thank German volunteers for their service. An &quot;al Merito En Campaña&quot; medal was awarded to the legion as a whole, and added to its battle flag. 

The legion assembled for an address by Hitler on 6 June 1939 and for a parade as part of the 20 April 1939 celebrations of Hitler&#x27;s 50th birthday. Its activities were commemorated in a special issue of &quot;Der Adler&quot;, the Luftwaffe&#x27;s propaganda magazine, which was circulated in Spain and the United States.

<doc id="452116" wikidata="Q2022932" url="?curid=452116" title="James St Clair-Erskine, 2nd Earl of Rosslyn">
<text>General James St Clair-Erskine, 2nd Earl of Rosslyn, (6 February 1762 – 18 January 1837) was a Scottish military officer, politician and peer who served as Lord President of the Council from 1834 to 1835. 

==Background and education==
Erskine was the son of Lieutenant-General Sir Henry Erskine, 5th Baronet, and Janet, daughter of Peter Wedderburn (a Lord of Session under the judicial title of Lord Chesterhall) and sister of Alexander Wedderburn, 1st Earl of Rosslyn. Lord Rosslyn&#x27;s earldom had been created with special remainder to his nephew, Erskine. Erskine succeeded as sixth baronet in 1765, at the age of three, on the death of his father. He was educated at Edinburgh High School and Eton, and was commissioned in the 21st Light Dragoons in 1778.

==Military career==
Erskine was assistant Adjutant-General in Ireland in 1782. In 1793, he became Adjutant-General, in which capacity he served at the Siege of Toulon and Corsica. In 1795, he was promoted to colonel and appointed Aide-de-Camp to King George III. He became a major-general in 1798, lieutenant-general in 1805, and general in 1814. In 1806, he was a member of the special mission to Lisbon, which resulted in Sir Arthur Wellesley (later the Duke of Wellington) being sent to the Peninsular. He also saw action in Denmark

As a result of the Slave Compensation Act 1837, Erskine received a £3,626 payment from the British government, as he was a trustee for the Lower Walrond and Upper Walrond slave plantations in Antigua owned by his son-in-law Bethell Walrond.

==Political career==
Erskine was a member of the House of Commons for the English pocket boroughs of Castle Rising between 1782 and 1784 and Morpeth between 1784 and 1796. Initially a Whig, an adherent of Edmund Burke and an active supporter of Charles James Fox against William Pitt the Younger in the debates over the East India Company, he was one of the managers of the Impeachment of Warren Hastings. In 1789, on inheriting the Rosslyn and Dysart estates from his cousin James Paterson St Clair, he adopted the name St Clair before his own surname. In 1796, he was elected for the Dysart Burghs in Fife, a constituency traditionally under the St Clair influence.

In January 1805, he succeeded his uncle as Earl of Rosslyn, being by this time considered a Tory, and, after the end of the Napoleonic Wars, continued his political career in the House of Lords. He was a member of the cabinet as Lord Privy Seal from 1829 to 1830 under the Duke of Wellington&#x27;s and Lord President of the Council under Sir Robert Peel from 1834 to 1835. In 1829, he was sworn of the Privy Council.

==Family==
Lord Rosslyn married Harriet Elizabeth, daughter of the Hon. Edward Bouverie, in 1790. She died in August 1810. Rosslyn remained a widower until his death in January 1837, aged 74. He was succeeded by his son, James.

<text> () is a type of (&#x27;stretched-curd&#x27;) cheese made out of sheep&#x27;s or cow&#x27;s milk. It is produced throughout southern Italy, particularly in the Apennine Mountains and in the Gargano peninsula. Shaped like a teardrop, it is similar in taste to the aged southern Italian provolone cheese, with a hard edible rind.

==Etymology==
The Italian name of the cheese literally means &#x27;horse cheese&#x27; and it is generally thought that the name derives from the fact that two cheese forms are always bound together with rope and then left to mature by placing them &quot;a cavallo&quot;, i.e. straddling, upon a horizontal stick or branch.

==History==
A sort of was first mentioned around 500 BC by Hippocrates, emphasising the &quot;Greeks&#x27; cleverness in making cheese&quot;. Columella in his classic treatise on agriculture, &quot;De re rustica&quot; (35–45 CE), described precisely the methods used in its preparation, making it one of the oldest known cheeses in the world. Types of cheese with names similar to are common throughout the Balkans and southern Italy.
In Sicily, the Ragusano DOP, known locally as had to drop the denomination &quot;&quot; in order to get DOP status.

==Types==
Many different types of exist in Italy, and several are recognised as (PAT), such as (produced using only milk from the Podolica cattle breed), (from Miscano Valley in the Apennines) or (often called ).

==Protected geographical status (PDO)==
 is made with cow&#x27;s milk in designated areas of southern Italy, in the regions of Basilicata, Calabria, Campania, Molise and Apulia, and gained protected geographical status in 1993.

<doc id="452123" wikidata="Q7220270" url="?curid=452123" title="Kashkaval">
<text>Kashkaval is a type of cheese made from the milk of cows, sheep, goats, or a mixture thereof. In Turkey, Albania, Bulgaria, Kosovo, North Macedonia, Romania and Serbia, the term is often used to refer to all yellow cheeses (or even any cheese other than &quot;sirene&quot;). In English-language menus in Bulgaria, &quot;kashkaval&quot; is translated as &#x27;yellow cheese&#x27; (whereas &quot;sirene&quot; is usually translated as &#x27;white cheese&#x27; or simply &#x27;cheese&#x27;).

==Etymology==
The name &quot;kashkaval&quot; possibly comes from the Italian &quot;caciocavallo&quot;.

Another theory claims that it is related to the Aromanian &quot;caș&quot;, &#x27;cheese&#x27;, but the &quot;kaval&quot; part remains unexplained.

==Locality==

===Albania===

In Albania, &quot;kaçkavall&quot; is the most popular type of cheese after &quot;djathë i bardhë&quot; (white cheese). It is considered a traditional Albanian cheese, and is widely used as a side dish. Some traditional restaurants will bring plates of raw or fried &quot;kaçkavall&quot; for no additional cost before the main dishes finish cooking. All dairy companies in Albania produce &quot;kaçkavall&quot; and mainly use cow&#x27;s or sheep&#x27;s milk, but some also use goat&#x27;s milk, though not as frequently.

===Bulgaria===

In Bulgaria, &quot;kashkaval vitosha&quot; is made from cow&#x27;s milk, &quot;kashkaval balkan&quot; from ewe&#x27;s milk, and &quot;kashkaval preslav&quot; is made from a mixture of the two.

&quot;Kashkaval&quot; is used in many breakfast pastries. A common dish with &quot;kashkaval&quot; is &quot;kashkavalka&quot;, a little pastry containing &quot;kashkaval&quot; inside and on top. As in the other Balkan countries, &quot;kashkaval&quot; substitutes for other cheeses, especially in pizzas. A popular Bulgarian snack is &quot;princesa&quot; (; ), toast topped with &quot;kashkaval&quot; or with ground pork and &quot;kashkaval&quot;.

===Romania and Moldova===
In Romania and Moldova, &quot;cașcaval&quot; is used to refer to a number of types of yellow medium and semi hard cheeses made of sheep&#x27;s or cow&#x27;s milk. The best known varieties of &quot;cașcaval&quot; in Romania are &quot;dobrogea&quot; (from sheep&#x27;s milk only), &quot;penteleu&quot; (from mix of sheep&#x27;s and cow&#x27;s milk), &quot;dalia&quot; and &quot;rucăr&quot; (both from cow&#x27;s milk only). But the term is often used by extension as a generic name for all semi-hard yellow cheeses such as the Swiss Emmental cheese, the Dutch Gouda and the British Cheddar, or anything that looks similar to &quot;cașcaval&quot;.

During the communist regime, because of the food shortages, Romanian housewives developed a technique for a homemade pressed cheese, similar to &quot;cașcaval&quot;, made out of milk, &quot;smântână&quot;, butter and eggs. In Romanian cuisine, a lot of dishes are made with &quot;cașcaval&quot;, such as &quot;cașcaval pane&quot; or &quot;mămăligă&quot;.

===North Macedonia===

&quot;Kashkaval&quot; cheese is very popular in North Macedonia. It is mostly made of cow&#x27;s milk, however both a sheep&#x27;s milk and a mixed (cow&#x27;s and sheep&#x27;s milk) variant are widely available. &quot;Kashkaval&quot; is also a synonym for any yellow cheese, to the extent that the word &quot;cheese&quot; mostly means white cheese such as feta, while yellow cheeses such as Gouda or Emmental have the suffix &quot;kashkaval&quot; attached to them in everyday speech, as simply calling them cheese would be ludicrous, since they&#x27;re not white cheeses.

===Russia===
&quot;Kashkaval&quot; cheese is popular in Russia. In addition to the Balkan and Italian products, there exists also a Russian version of &quot;kashkaval&quot;.

===Serbia===
In Serbia, &quot;kačkavalj&quot; is traditionally a sheep milk hard cheese, and as such a protected brand of the city of Pirot. Other cheeses, made from a mix of cow and sheep milk, are sometimes also branded as &quot;kačkavalj&quot; but they cannot be defined as &quot;pirotski&quot; (of Pirot).

&quot;Kačkavalj&quot; is one of the six traditional cheeses of Serbia. The production process (in Serbian) can be seen online, and according to a TV show video clip, it was brought to Pirot in the 1810s with the Dalmatian or Italian cheesemakers who settled in then-Ottoman Empire; the cheese was distributed throughout the Balkans (specifically mentioned in the link are Salonica and Istanbul).

===Levant===
In the Levant (Syria, Jordan, Palestine, Israel, and Lebanon), &quot;qashqawān&quot; is widely used as a melting cheese, particularly in pastries. Hungarian made &quot;kashkaval&quot; is the most common type found in the region.

===Turkey===

&quot;Kaşkaval&quot; (Ottoman: &quot;penir-i kaskaval&quot;) was a type of cheese consumed in Ottoman feasts. Evliya Çelebi&#x27;s &quot;Seyahatnâme&quot; mentions that there at his time (17th century) in Istanbul 400 artisans produced different types of cheese: among them, cut cheese, teleme cheese and &quot;kaşkaval&quot;. In the same book is also mentioned that &quot;kaşkaval&quot;, cheese was produced in Çatalca.

<text>Sir Julian Michael Shersby (17 February 1933 – 8 May 1997) was a British Conservative Party politician who was the Member of Parliament for Uxbridge from 1972 until his death.

==Early life==
Shersby was born to William and Elinor Shersby (Nora, née Fuller) at their home 9 Court Road, Ickenham (a Greater London area later in his seat in the House of Commons) on 17 February 1933. Christened Julian Michael, he was known primarily as Michael by the age of ten. He had siblings: Dick (also known as Harold), Marjorie and Brian Shersby. His father advanced in the Port of London Authority to be a manager.

He attended Breakspear primary school and The John Lyon School, in Harrow. Shersby left school at 15, in 1948 starting work as a messenger in the City of London. He lived with family in Ickenham until at 25 he married Barbara Barrow of West Drayton and they moved to London. He qualified as a trained Conservative party agent during the 1950s and worked in that capacity during his early 20s before joining the industrial film industry between 1958 and 1966. Between 1966 and 1988 he was Director General of the British Sugar Bureau, the industry&#x27;s trade association.

==Career==
Shersby&#x27;s career as an elected political representative began in 1959 when he was first elected as a borough councillor on Paddington Borough Council for Maida Vale North ward and he then continued to serve for the Maida Vale ward of Westminster City Council from 1964 to 1970 after Paddington was subsumed into the new larger unitary council&#x27;s area. He served as deputy lord mayor on Westminster City Council from 1967 to 1968.

On 7 December 1972, Shersby was elected to Parliament at a by-election triggered by the death of Uxbridge MP Charles Curran, who had re-taken the seat for the Conservatives from Labour&#x27;s John Ryan in the 1970 general election. Shersby was not expected to win the by-election, as it was considered a marginal seat; it occurred the same day as another by-election in Sutton and Cheam, in which the Conservatives lost a seat they had held in 1970 with a larger majority.

He received an Honorary Doctorate from Brunel University in 1994 and was knighted in 1995 for his longstanding years of service in Parliament.

==Private members&#x27; bills==
Since at least 1920s he holds a record as the parliamentarian who has introduced the most of their own tabled bills (eight) to become law. Many of these he was the named sponsor, to bring attention to their importance, thus survive tight parliamentary timetabling rules.

==Hillsborough disaster==
As Parliamenty Adviser to the Police Federation, Shersby was invited to assist in the development of a ‘counter attack’ to ‘repudiate’ Lord Justice Taylor&#x27;s Interim Report, which had condemned the evidence and testimony of senior police officers and rejected as exaggerated the allegations made against Liverpool fans. Taylor LJ stated categorically that fans’ behaviour played no part in the disaster. The Police Federation considered the Interim Report unfair and unbalanced. His acts, if any, as Parliamentary Adviser to the Police Federation following the Hillsborough disaster, per the Hillsborough Independent Panel&#x27;s report, are unknown.

==Personal life and death==

Shersby married Barbara Barrow in 1958, and they had two children, Julian and Lucy. Lucy stood as Conservative Parliamentary candidate for Battersea in the 2001 general election but was not elected, while Julian served as a Conservative councillor on Mole Valley District Council between 1999 and 2006.

Shersby died of a heart attack in London on 8 May 1997, at the age of 64, only seven days after being re-elected to Parliament in the 1997 general election. The resulting by-election was won by local department store owner John Randall.

Shersby is buried in the churchyard of Harefield parish church. His epitaph is: &quot;He demanded little, and gave much&quot;.

<text>Roger Stott, (7 August 1943 – 9 August 1999) was a British Labour Party politician.

==Biography==
Stott was born in Rochdale, the first child of Richard and Edith Stott. He was of Scottish descent. He went to school in Rochdale and when he was 15 he joined the Merchant Navy. He then worked as an engineer for the Post Office and became local councillor for the Labour Party in Rochdale, where he was the Chair of the Housing Committee. He married Irene Mills on 17 June 1969 from which he had two sons Andrew (1970) and Joe (Stott) Mills (1972). The marriage ended in 1982 and he married again for a second time to a teacher Gillian Pye on 30 March 1985 and later had two children Daniel and Ciara. When Stott was not working, he loved to play sport, he was a great rugby league fan and went to watch it whenever he had the chance. He was also a great fan of cricket.

==Political career==
Stott represented the North West Region on the National Committee of the Labour Party Young Socialists in 1969, following Peter Kent. He contested Cheadle in 1970, coming third.

Stott was first elected to the House of Commons as Member of Parliament (MP) for Westhoughton at a by-election in 1973, following the death of the sitting Labour MP Tom Price. He was sponsored by the Post Office Engineering Union (POEU). He held that seat at three subsequent general elections before the constituency was abolished for the 1983 general election.

He was then elected MP for the Wigan constituency in Greater Manchester, and held that seat at the next three general elections. His death in office in 1999 made him the fourth Wigan MP in the twentieth century to die in office (the others being John Parkinson, Ronald Williams and William Foster).

Stott was a longtime joint chairman of the Council for the Advancement of Arab-British Understanding, and served as Parliamentary Private Secretary to James Callaghan during his administration. He later served as a junior opposition spokesman.

==Death==
Stott died of liver cancer on Monday, 9 August 1999, two days after his 56th birthday. He had been ill for some time. After his death many people, including Ian McCartney and Jack Cunningham, wrote tributes to him and the work he had done while he was MP.

<doc id="452140" wikidata="Q14512155" url="?curid=452140" title="Richard Bell Davies">
<text>Vice Admiral Richard Bell Davies (19 May 1886 – 26 February 1966), also known as Richard Bell-Davies, was a senior Royal Navy commander, naval aviator, and a First World War recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Early life and career==
Born in Kensington, London, Davies was orphaned by the age of five and was brought up by an uncle, a doctor. He attended Bradfield College in Berkshire between September 1899 and April 1901. Davies enlisted in the Royal Navy in 1901 joining , and on 15 September 1902 was posted as a naval cadet to the protected cruiser HMS &quot;Diana&quot;, serving with the Mediterranean Fleet. In 1910 he took private flying lessons, and in 1913 he was accepted into the Royal Naval Air Service (RNAS) and was appointed a squadron commander.

==First World War==
===Distinguished Service Order===
In the early days of the war, Davies and Richard Peirse carried out a number of raids on German submarine bases at Ostend and Zeebrugge. Both were awarded the DSO:
===Victoria Cross===
Davies was then posted to the Dardanelles, and was awarded the Victoria Cross on 1 January 1916 for an action at Ferrijik Junction, in what was then part of Bulgaria near the border with Ottoman-controlled Europe, on 19 November 1915. Today, Feres (Ferecik in Turkish) is in the Evros region of modern Greece. Davies was 29 years old, and in command of No. 3 Squadron RNAS. His citation read:
This was the first combat search and rescue by aircraft in history. Like later search and rescue efforts, Davies&#x27; action sprang from the desire to keep a compatriot from capture or death at the hands of the enemy; unlike most of those future efforts, it was a one-man impromptu action that succeeded because of a peculiarity in construction of his aircraft. The Nieuport 10 he was flying was a single seat model which had had its front cockpit decked over. When Davies picked him up under rifle fire, Smylie wriggled past Davies and through his controls into the tiny roofed-over front compartment. Smylie was so thoroughly wedged among the controls that, upon landing, it took two hours to extricate him.

Davies was also mentioned in despatches for his Gallipoli service.

In early 1916, Davies was transferred to the Western Front, conducting bombing raids behind German lines, and then as wing commander in the seaplane carrier , attached to the Grand Fleet. The RNAS was incorporated into the Royal Air Force in April 1918, but Davies relinquished his RAF commission in May 1919 and returned to naval service. After the war, he was awarded the Air Force Cross and the French Croix de guerre with Palm.

==Interbellum and Second World War==
Davies was first lieutenant of in 1919–20; in charge of the Air Section of the Naval Staff 1920–24; and executive officer of in the Atlantic Fleet 1924–26. He was promoted to captain in 1926 and was again in charge of the Air Section of the Naval Staff 1926–28.

He was Chief Staff Officer to the Rear Admiral commanding 1st Cruiser Squadron in the Mediterranean 1929–30, and Liaison Officer for the Fleet Air Arm at the Air Ministry 1931–33. He commanded on the China station 1933–35 and the naval base at Devonport (HMS &quot;Drake&quot;) 1936–38. He was promoted to rear admiral in 1938 and from 1939 to 1941 was Rear Admiral, Naval Air Stations, based at RNAS Lee-on-Solent (HMS &quot;Daedalus&quot;). He was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath in the King&#x27;s Birthday Honours of 1939.

Davies was promoted to vice admiral upon retiring on 29 May 1941, aged 55. He then joined the Royal Naval Reserve (RNR) with a reduction in rank to commander. As an RNR officer, he served as a convoy commodore, and as commissioning captain of the escort carrier and the trials carrier . He left the RNR in 1944.

==Death and legacy==
He died at RNH Haslar in Gosport, Hampshire. His Victoria Cross is on display at the Fleet Air Arm Museum in Yeovil, Somerset.

On 19 November 2015, he was remembered at a memorial service in central London, with a memorial stone laid in Sloane Square, Chelsea.

<text>Fritz Julius Kuhn (May 15, 1896 – December 14, 1951) was a German Nazi activist who served as the elected leader of the German American Bund, a German-American Nazi organization before World War II. He became a naturalized United States citizen in 1934, though his citizenship was revoked in 1943 owing to his status as a foreign agent of Nazi Germany. Kuhn served prison time for larceny and forgery from 1939 to 1943 and, upon release, was immediately interned by the United States government as an enemy agent. He was deported in 1945 and later served further prison time in post-war Germany before dying in 1951.

==Early life and education==
Kuhn was born in Munich, Germany, on May 15, 1896, the son of Georg Kuhn and Julia Justyna Beuth. During World War I, Kuhn earned an Iron Cross as a German infantry lieutenant. After the war, he joined the Freikorps and later graduated from the Technical University of Munich with a master&#x27;s degree in chemical engineering. 

In the 1920s, Kuhn moved to Mexico. In 1928, he moved to the United States, and after 6 years, in 1934, he became a naturalized citizen of the United States. He worked at a Ford factory in Detroit before assuming control of the German American Bund in Buffalo, New York, in 1936.

== Leadership of the German American Bund ==
A Congressional committee headed by Samuel Dickstein concluded that the Friends of New Germany supported a branch of German dictator Adolf Hitler&#x27;s Nazi Party in the United States, and the Friends of New Germany disbanded. However, in March 1936, the German American Bund was established in Buffalo as a follow-up organization. The Bund elected the German-born American citizen Kuhn as its leader.

Kuhn, while describing the Bund as &quot;sympathetic to the Hitler government&quot;, denied that the organization received money or took orders from the government of Germany. Kuhn also denied that the Bund had any agenda of introducing fascism to the United States.

Kuhn enlisted thousands of German Americans by using antisemitic, anticommunist, pro-German, and pro-American propaganda. One of his first tasks was planning a trip to Germany with 50 American followers. The purpose was to be in the presence of Hitler and to witness Nazism in practice personally.

At this time, Germany was preparing to host the 1936 Olympics. Kuhn anticipated a warm welcome from Adolf Hitler, but the encounter was disappointing. This did not stop Kuhn from fabricating propaganda to his followers once he returned to the United States about how Hitler acknowledged him as the &quot;American Führer&quot;.

As his profile grew, so did the tension against him. Not only Jewish-Americans, but also German-Americans who did not want to be associated with Nazis protested against the Bund. These protests were occasionally violent, making the Bund front page news in the United States. In response to the outrage of Jewish war veterans, Congress in 1938 passed the Foreign Agents Registration Act requiring foreign agents to register with the State Department. The negative attention to the American Nazis was not to Hitler&#x27;s liking because he wanted the Nazi Party in the United States to be strong but stealthy. Hitler needed to keep the U.S. neutral throughout the coming war and sought to avoid provoking Americans. In contrast, Kuhn was eager to stir media attention. On March 1, 1938, the Nazi government decreed that no German national () could be a member of the Bund and that no Nazi emblems were to be used by the organization.

Undaunted, on September 3, 1938, the Bund reelected Kuhn, and on February 20, 1939, Kuhn held the largest and most publicized rally in the Bund&#x27;s history at Madison Square Garden in New York City. Some 20,000 people attended and heard Kuhn mock President Franklin D. Roosevelt as &quot;Frank D. Rosenfeld&quot;, calling his New Deal the &quot;Jew Deal&quot; and denouncing what he called Bolshevik-Jewish American leadership. Kuhn also stated: &quot;The Bund is fighting shoulder to shoulder with patriotic Americans to protect America from a race that is not the American race, that is not even a white race... The Jews are controlling everything and the white man is thrown out of his job... The Jews are enemies of the United States... All Jews are Communists... Christ was not a Jew...&quot; There was an outbreak of violence between Bund storm troopers and thousands of angry protesters in the streets. During Kuhn&#x27;s speech, a Jewish protester, Isadore Greenbaum, rushed the stage and had to be rescued by police after he was beaten and stripped by stormtroopers.

== Criminal conviction ==
Later in 1939, seeking to cripple the Bund, New York City Mayor Fiorello La Guardia ordered the city to investigate the Bund&#x27;s taxes. It alleged that Kuhn had embezzled $14,548 from the organization, spending part of the money on a mistress. District Attorney Thomas E. Dewey issued an indictment on May 25, 1939, and won a conviction against Kuhn. On December 5, 1939, Kuhn was sentenced to two and a half to five years in prison for larceny and forgery. The next day, he was sent to Sing Sing. Despite his convictions for embezzlement, followers of the Bund continued to hold Kuhn in high regard, in line with the Nazi &quot;Führerprinzip&quot;, which gives the leader absolute power.

In 1940, James Wheeler-Hill, the Secretary of the Bund, was sentenced to one to three years in prison after pleading guilty to perjury for falsely testifying that he was an American citizen at Kuhn&#x27;s trial. Wheeler-Hill had been born in Latvia, and was never naturalized.

== Imprisonment and deportation ==
Kuhn&#x27;s citizenship was revoked on June 1, 1943, while he was in Sing Sing prison, on the grounds of it having been obtained fraudulently as shown by his ongoing activity as a foreign agent of, and a person with loyalty including oaths of military service towards, Germany and the Nazi Party. Upon his release after 43 months in prison, Kuhn was re-arrested on June 21, 1943, as an enemy agent and interned by the federal government at a camp in Crystal City, Texas. Interned with Kuhn were his wife and 16-year-old son, who were deemed &quot;enemy aliens&quot;. Kuhn&#x27;s family had returned to Germany in 1938, but came back to support him for the trial. They were repatriated to Germany in an exchange in February 1944.

After the war, Kuhn, along with 714 other &quot;unteachable Germans&quot; was sent to Ellis Island and deported to Germany on September 15, 1945. Upon his return, he was interned at Hohenasperg Fortress. A CIC agent who interrogated Kuhn in January 1946 recommended his release, saying he was &quot;discredited and spiritually broken.&quot; Kuhn wanted to return to the United States, but worked as an industrial chemist in a small chemical factory in Munich. The German authorities then decided that he could be tried under Germany&#x27;s denazification laws, and he was imprisoned in July 1947.

== Last years in Germany ==
Kuhn was held in an internment camp at Dachau, awaiting trial before a Bavarian German de-Nazification court. He escaped on February 4, 1948, by promising a 32-year-old German civilian employee of the US armed forces that he would marry her. Nonetheless, Kuhn was tried in absentia in April 1948, and a jury found him guilty. He was sentenced to ten years in prison. The Associated Press reported that the trial was carried out entirely by the presentation of documents demonstrating Kuhn&#x27;s close ties with Hitler&#x27;s Third Reich and his attempts transplant its ideology into the United States.

Kuhn was recaptured on June 15 in the French zone town of Bernkastel, near Trier. After an investigation into how he had escaped, the camp director, Anton Zirngibl, was fired. Kuhn told reporters, &quot;The door was open so I went through.&quot; Kuhn said on June 17 that he considered the ten-year sentence as a &quot;major Nazi offender&quot; unfair and that he intended to appeal.

In 1949, an appellate court reduced Kuhn&#x27;s sentence to two years of hard labor. He was released on February 22, 1949. While in prison, Kuhn reportedly sent a message to columnist Walter Winchell, who had helped lead media counterattacks against the Bund back in New York City. It read: &quot;Tell Herr Vinchell, I will lift to piss on his grafe [sic].&quot; Winchell died in 1972, outliving the Nazi activist by 21 years.

== Death ==
Kuhn died of unknown causes on December 14, 1951, in Munich, Germany. &quot;The New York Times&quot; obituary said that he died &quot;a poor and obscure chemist, unheralded and unsung.&quot; Shortly before his death, Kuhn was asked why he&#x27;d followed Hitler. Disillusioned by the collapse of Nazi Germany, he replied, &quot;Who would have known it would end like this?&quot;

<doc id="452152" wikidata="Q1988024" url="?curid=452152" title="Sally Rand">
<text>Sally Rand (born Helen Gould Beck; April 3, 1904 – August 31, 1979) was an American burlesque dancer, vedette, and actress, famous for her ostrich-feather fan dance and balloon bubble dance. She also performed under the name Billie Beck. 

Rand got her start as a chorus girl before working as an acrobat and traveling theater performer. Her career spanned more than forty years, appearing on stage, screen and on television. Through her career she worked alongside Humphrey Bogart, Karl Malden, and Cecil B. De Mille. She was a trained pilot and briefly dated Charles Lindbergh.

==Early life==
Rand was born in the village of Elkton, Hickory County, Missouri. Her father, William Beck, was a West Point graduate and retired U.S. Army colonel, while her mother, Nettie (Grove) Beck, was a school teacher and part-time newspaper correspondent. The family moved to Jackson County, Missouri while she was still in grade school.

== Career==
Helen started on the stage quite early, working as a chorus girl at Kansas City&#x27;s Empress Theater when she was only 13. An early supporter of her talent was Goodman Ace, a drama critic for the &quot;Kansas City Journal&quot;, who saw her performing in a Kansas City nightclub and wrote glowing reviews. After studying ballet and drama in Kansas City, the teenaged Helen decided her future lay in Hollywood. For a short time, as she worked her way to the west coast, she was employed as an acrobat in the Ringling Brothers Circus. She also performed in summer stock and traveling theater, including working with a then-unknown Humphrey Bogart.

During the 1920s, she acted on stage and appeared in silent films. Cecil B. DeMille gave her the name Sally Rand, inspired by a Rand McNally atlas. She was selected as one of the WAMPAS Baby Stars in 1927.

After the introduction of sound films, she became a dancer, known for the fan dance, which she popularized starting at the Paramount Club, at 15 E. Huron, in Chicago. Her most famous appearance was at the 1933 Chicago World&#x27;s Fair, known as the Century of Progress, accompanied by her backing orchestra, directed by Art Frasik. She would play peek-a-boo with her body by manipulating her fans in the front and behind her, like a winged bird as she swooped and twirled on the stage, usually to &quot;Clair de Lune&quot;. She was arrested four times in a single day during the fair due to perceived indecent exposure after a fan dance performance and while riding a white horse down the streets of Chicago, where the nudity was only an illusion, and again after being bodypainted by Max Factor Sr. with his new makeup formulated for Hollywood films. She was convicted of willfully performing an obscene and indecent dance in a public place on September 23, 1933 but was allowed to continue performing at World&#x27;s Fair, and the conviction was overturned in November of 1934. 

She also conceived the bubble dance, in part to cope with wind while performing outdoors. She performed the fan dance on film in &quot;Bolero&quot;, released in 1934. She performed the bubble dance in the film &quot;Sunset Murder Case&quot; (1938).
In 1936, she purchased The Music Box burlesque hall in San Francisco, which later became the Great American Music Hall. She starred in &quot;Sally Rand&#x27;s Nude Ranch&quot; at the Golden Gate International Exposition in San Francisco in 1939 and 1940. To advertise for her upcoming Treasure Island Nude Ranch, she organized a stunt on February 17, 1939, wherein lingerie clad women on horses rode down Market Street in downtown San Francisco. 

Rand took an interest in flying due in part to her brief relationship with Charles Lindbergh. By 1923, Rand had learned to fly, and she would later receive her pilot&#x27;s license. Rand often flew herself to her performances. On August 1, 1939, she reportedly broke the speed record for a light plane flight she made from San Francisco to Reno, completing the trip in 1 hour and 54 minutes.

In the early 1940s, Rand did summer stock in Woodstock, New York. She signed on to star in &quot;Rain&quot; and &quot;Little Foxes&quot; whose cast also included Karl Malden. He remembered being stressed that she was unprepared and seemed to care more about her costumes than learning her lines, costumes which he admitted were dazzling to the point that he forgot his own lines during a performance. “Her burlesque days were written all over her, especially in her hygiene habits,” wrote Malden in his memoirs. “One could assume she rarely bathed, and the college kids who cleaned the rooms at the playhouse confirmed that the tub was never used. Instead, she just kept dousing herself with perfume and shoveling on the makeup, layer upon layer, until it began to cake and separate so that you could see the dirt buildup in the creases around her neck.”

She was arrested twice in San Francisco in 1946; while performing at Club Savoy, she was arrested by six police officers in the audience as she danced, seemingly nude, in silhouette behind a large white fan; the judge, Daniel R. Shoemaker, granted her immunity should she be arrested for the same offense while on trial; however she was arrested during a night of the trial while performing her act, despite her immunity and the fact that she was wearing long underwear and a note that read &quot;CENSORED. S.F.P.D.&quot; that time. In an unusual move, the judge viewed her performance at the Savoy and cleared her of all charges after deeming that &quot;anyone who could find something lewd about the dance as she puts it on has to have a perverted idea of morals&quot;.

In the early 1950s, she was traveling with a 17-member troupe around the Midwest, appearing at state fairs and small theaters. Edith Dahl accompanied Rand&#x27;s famous fan dance, the finale of the show, on the violin and &quot;cracked a few jokes&quot;. According to local newspaper accounts, Rand&#x27;s large white feathered fans acted as &quot;a guard to keep too much of mother nature from showing.&quot; &quot;Smutty jokes&quot; were at minimum in the afternoon performances.&quot; The tour was across Oklahoma and Texas, then west toward Washington before returning east. She refused to divulge her age to reporters at the time, but was known to be approaching 50.

Rand was the mystery guest on the December 28, 1952, episode of &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot; Her identity was guessed by panelist Robert Q. Lewis.

She appeared on television on March 12, 1957, in episode 13 of the first season of &quot;To Tell the Truth&quot; with host Bud Collyer and panelists Polly Bergen, Ralph Bellamy, Kitty Carlisle, and Carl Reiner. She did not &quot;stump the panel&quot;, but was correctly identified by all four panelists (she was introduced as Helen Beck, her birth name).

She continued to appear on stage doing her fan dance into the 1970s. While performing at Mangam’s Chateau in suburban Chicago in 1966, she donated two of her feather fans to the Chicago History Museum. Rand once replaced Ann Corio in the stage show &quot;This Was Burlesque&quot;, appeared at the Mitchell Brothers club in San Francisco in the early 1970s and toured as one of the stars of the 1972 nostalgia revue &quot;Big Show of 1928&quot;, which played major concert venues, including New York&#x27;s Madison Square Garden. Describing her 40-year career, Rand said, &quot;I haven’t been out of work since the day I took my pants off.&quot;

==Death==
Rand died on August 31, 1979, at Foothill Presbyterian Hospital, in Glendora, California, aged 75, from congestive heart failure. She was deeply in debt at her death. Rand&#x27;s adopted son told an interviewer that Sammy Davis Jr. stepped in and wrote a $10,000 check, which took care of Rand&#x27;s expenses.

==Football play==
Football coaches at the University of Delaware named a football play after Sally Rand. One explanation is that the play misdirected the defense, or in other words, like the dancer herself, the offense was showing more than they actually had. The name migrated to Canada, where a &quot;naked bootleg&quot; became known as a &quot;Sally Rand&quot; and was used to great effect by the BC Lions.

==In popular culture==
* In Tex Avery&#x27;s cartoon &quot;Hollywood Steps Out&quot; (1941), a rotoscoped Rand performs her famous bubble dance onstage to an appreciative crowd. A grinning Peter Lorre caricature in the front row comments, &quot;I haven&#x27;t seen such a beautiful bubble since I was a child.&quot; The routine continues until the bubble is suddenly popped by Harpo Marx and his slingshot, with a surprised Rand (her nudity covered by a well-placed wooden barrel) reacting with shock. Rand is referred to as &quot;Sally Strand&quot; here. Closer to the beginning of the cartoon, a coat check girl says &quot;Good evening, Miss Rand,&quot; as we see a woman&#x27;s hand offer her a set of feather fans to hang up.
* She was the model of several characters in Robert A. Heinlein&#x27;s science fiction stories, such as the Mary-Lou Martin character of &quot;Let There Be Light&quot;. She was also a guest of Robert and Virginia Heinlein at 1976&#x27;s 34th World Science Fiction Convention, held in Kansas City, Missouri, where Robert Heinlein was the Guest of Honor; at that Worldcon, she served as a judge for the convention&#x27;s masquerade costume contest. She was also included in Heinlein&#x27;s 1987 book, &quot;To Sail Beyond the Sunset&quot;, as a friend of main character, Maureen Johnson Long, mother of the character Lazarus Long.
* In the 1979 book &quot;The Right Stuff&quot;, the author Tom Wolfe described Sally Rand fan-dancing for the first American astronauts and other dignitaries at the barbecue in Houston celebrating the space center, and referred to the astronauts&#x27; observing this sixtyish woman&#x27;s &quot;ancient haunches&quot;. In the 1983 film version of &quot;The Right Stuff&quot;, Rand was portrayed by actress Peggy Davis.
* A fictionalized version of Rand appeared in Toni Dove&#x27;s interactive cinema project &quot;Spectropia&quot;, played by Helen Pickett of the Wooster Group.
* In the 1936 Merrie Melodie cartoon &quot;Page Miss Glory&quot;, a robustly proportioned matron performs a parody of Rand&#x27;s fan dance.
* In the &quot;Nathan Heller&quot; mystery series by Max Allan Collins, Detective Heller meets Rand.
* In her novel &quot;The Fountainhead&quot;, Ayn Rand (no relation) mentions a Sally Rand-inspired performer named Juanita Fay &quot;who danced with a live peacock as sole garment&quot; at &quot;The March of the Centuries&quot; 1936 world fair (which strongly resembles 1933 Century of Progress fair).

<text>Abdul Qadeer Khan, ( ; ; 1 April 1936 – 10 October 2021), known as A. Q. Khan, was a Pakistani nuclear physicist and metallurgical engineer who is colloquially known as the &quot;father of Pakistan&#x27;s atomic weapons program&quot;.

An &quot;émigré (Muhajir)&quot; from India who migrated to Pakistan in 1952, Khan was educated in the metallurgical engineering departments of Western European technical universities where he pioneered studies in phase transitions of metallic alloys, uranium metallurgy, and isotope separation based on gas centrifuges. After learning of India&#x27;s &quot;Smiling Buddha&quot; nuclear test in 1974, Khan joined his nation&#x27;s clandestine efforts to develop atomic weapons when he founded the Khan Research Laboratories (KRL) in 1976 and was both its chief scientist and director for many years.

In January 2004, Khan was subjected to a debriefing by the Musharraf administration over evidence of nuclear proliferation handed to them by the Bush administration of the United States. Khan admitted his role in running a nuclear proliferation network – only to retract his statements in later years when he leveled accusations at the former administration of Pakistan&#x27;s Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto in 1990, and also directed allegations at President Musharraf over the controversy in 2008. 

Khan was accused of selling nuclear secrets illegally and was put under house arrest in 2004. After years of house arrest, Khan successfully filed a lawsuit against the Federal Government of Pakistan at the Islamabad High Court whose verdict declared his debriefing unconstitutional and freed him on 6 February 2009. The United States reacted negatively to the verdict and the Obama administration issued an official statement warning that Khan still remained a &quot;serious proliferation risk&quot;.

On account of the knowledge of nuclear espionage by Khan and his contribution to nuclear proliferation throughout the world post 1970s, and the renewed fear of weapons of mass destruction in the hands of terrorists after the September 11 attacks, former CIA Director George Tenet described Khan as &quot;at least as dangerous as Osama bin Laden&quot;.

After his death on 10 October 2021, he was given a state funeral at Faisal Mosque before being buried at the H-8 graveyard in Islamabad.

==Early life and education==
Abdul Qadeer Khan was born on 1 April 1936, in Bhopal, a city then in the erstwhile British Indian princely state of Bhopal State, and now the capital city of Madhya Pradesh. He was a Muhajir of Urdu-speaking Pashtun origin. His maternal ancestors hailed from the Tirah Valley (now in the Khyber District of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan) while from his paternal side, an ancestor of his was an Uzbek soldier who came to India with Muhammad of Ghor, the 12th century conqueror, the reason why years later he would name his ballistic missiles as &quot;Ghauri&quot;. In 1994-1995, Khan would build a mausoleum for Ghori situated at around 80 kilometres from Islamabad.

His father, Abdul Ghafoor, was a schoolteacher who once worked for the Ministry of Education, and his mother, Zulekha, was a housewife with a very religious mindset. His older siblings, along with other family members, had emigrated to Pakistan during the partition of India in 1947, who would often write to Khan&#x27;s parents about the new life they had found in Pakistan.

After his matriculation from a local school in Bhopal, in 1952 Khan emigrated from India to Pakistan on the Sind Mail train, partly due to the reservation politics at that time, and religious violence in India during his youth had left an indelible impression on his world view. Upon settling in Karachi with his family, Khan briefly attended the D. J. Science College before transferring to the University of Karachi, where he graduated in 1956 with a Bachelor of Science (BSc) in physics with a concentration on solid-state physics.

From 1956 to 1959, Khan was employed by the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (city government) as an Inspector of weights and measures, and applied for a scholarship that allowed him to study in West Germany. In 1961, Khan departed for West Germany to study material science at the Technical University in West Berlin, where he academically excelled in courses in metallurgy, but left West Berlin when he switched to the Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands in 1965.

In 1962, while on vacation in The Hague, he met Hendrina &quot;Henny&quot; Reterink, a British passport holder who had been born in South Africa to Dutch expatriates. She spoke Dutch and had spent her childhood in Africa before returning with her parents to the Netherlands where she lived as a registered foreigner. In 1963, he married Henny in a modest Muslim ceremony at Pakistan&#x27;s embassy in The Hague. Khan and Henny together had two daughters, Dina Khan - who is a doctor, and Ayesha Khan.

In 1967, Khan obtained an engineer&#x27;s degree in materials technology – an equivalent to a Master of Science (MS) offered in English-speaking nations such as Pakistan – and joined the doctoral program in metallurgical engineering at the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven in Belgium. He worked under Belgian professor Martin J. Brabers at Leuven University, who supervised his doctoral thesis which Khan successfully defended, and graduated with a DEng in metallurgical engineering in 1972. His thesis included fundamental work on martensite and its extended industrial applications in the field of graphene morphology.

==Career in Europe==
In 1972, Khan joined the Physics Dynamics Research Laboratory (or in Dutch: FDO), an engineering firm subsidiary of Verenigde Machinefabrieken (VMF) based in Amsterdam, from Brabers&#x27;s recommendation. The FDO was a subcontractor for Ultra-Centrifuge Nederland of the, British-German-Dutch uranium enrichment consortium, URENCO which was operating a uranium enrichment plant in Almelo and employed gaseous centrifuge method to assure a supply of nuclear fuel for nuclear power plants in the Netherlands. Soon after, Khan left FDO when URENCO offered him a senior technical position, initially conducting studies on uranium metallurgy.

Uranium enrichment is an extremely difficult process because uranium in its natural state is composed of just 0.71% of uranium-235 (U235), which is a fissile material, 99.3% of uranium-238 (U238), which is non-fissile, and 0.0055% of uranium-234 (U234), a daughter product which is also a non-fissile. The URENCO Group utilised the Zippe-type of centrifugal method to electromagnetically separate the isotopes U234, U235, and U238 from sublimed raw uranium by rotating the uranium hexafluoride (UF6) gas at up to ~100,000 revolutions per minute (rpm). Khan, whose work was based on physical metallurgy of the uranium metal, eventually dedicated his investigations to improving the efficiency of the centrifuges by 1973–74.

Frits Veerman, Khan&#x27;s colleague at FDO, uncovered nuclear espionage at Almelo where Khan had stolen designs of the centrifuges from URENCO for the nuclear weapons programme of Pakistan. Veerman became aware of the espionage when Khan had taken classified URENCO documents home to be copied and translated by his Dutch-speaking wife and had asked Veerman to photograph some of them. In 1975, Khan was transferred to a less sensitive section when URENCO became suspicious and he subsequently returned to Pakistan with his wife and two daughters. Khan was sentenced in absentia to four years in prison in 1983 by the Netherlands for espionage but the conviction was later overturned due to a legal technicality. Ruud Lubbers, Prime Minister of the Netherlands at the time, later said that the General Intelligence and Security Service (BVD) was aware of Khan&#x27;s espionage activities but he was allowed to continue due to pressure from the CIA, with the US backing Pakistan during the Cold War. This was also highlighted when despite Archie Pervez (Khan&#x27;s associate for nuclear procurement in the US) being convicted in 1988, no action was taken against Khan or his proliferation network by the US government which needed the support of Pakistan during the Soviet–Afghan War.

, a Dutch engineer and businessman who had studied metallurgy with Khan at the Delft University of Technology, continued providing goods needed for enriching uranium to Khan in Pakistan through his company Slebos Research. Slebos was sentenced in 1985 to one year in prison but the sentence was reduced on appeal in 1986 to six months of probation and a fine of 20,000 guilders. Though Slebos continued to export goods to Pakistan and was again sentenced to one year in prison and a fine of around was imposed on his company.

Ernst Piffl, was convicted and sentenced to three and a half years in prison by Germany in 1998 for supplying nuclear centrifuge parts through his company Team GmbH to Khan&#x27;s Khan Research Laboratories in Kahuta. Asher Karni, a Hungarian-South African businessman was sentenced to three years in prison in the US for the sale of restricted nuclear equipment to Pakistan through Humayun Khan (an associate of A. Q. Khan) and his Pakland PME Corporation.

==Scientific career in Pakistan==
===Smiling Buddha and initiation===
Upon learning of India&#x27;s surprise nuclear test, &#x27;Smiling Buddha&#x27;, in May 1974, Khan wanted to contribute to efforts to build an atomic bomb and met with officials at the Pakistani Embassy in The Hague, who dissuaded him by saying it was &quot;hard to find&quot; a job in PAEC as a &quot;metallurgist&quot;. In August 1974, Khan wrote a letter which went unnoticed, but he directed another letter through the Pakistani ambassador to the Prime Minister&#x27;s Secretariat in September 1974.

Unbeknownst to Khan, his nation&#x27;s scientists were already working towards feasibility of the atomic bomb under a secretive crash weapons program since 20 January 1972 that was being directed by Munir Ahmad Khan, a reactor physicist, which calls into question of his &quot;father-of&quot; claim. After reading his letter, Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto had his military secretary run a security check on Khan, who was unknown at that time, for verification and asked PAEC to dispatch a team under Bashiruddin Mahmood that met Khan at his family home in Almelo and directed Bhutto&#x27;s letter to meet him in Islamabad. Upon arriving in December 1974, Khan took a taxi straight to the Prime Minister&#x27;s Secretariat. He met with Prime Minister Bhutto in the presence of Ghulam Ishaq Khan, Agha Shahi, and Mubashir Hassan where he explained the significance of highly enriched uranium, with the meeting ending with Bhutto&#x27;s remark: &quot;He seems to make sense.&quot;

The next day, Khan met with Munir Ahmad and other senior scientists where he focused the discussion on production of highly enriched uranium (HEU), against weapon-grade plutonium, and explained to Bhutto why he thought the idea of &quot;plutonium&quot; would not work. Later, Khan was advised by several officials in the Bhutto administration to remain in the Netherlands to learn more about centrifuge technology but continue to provide consultation on the Project-706 enrichment program led by Mahmood. By December 1975, Khan was given a transfer to a less sensitive section when URENCO became suspicious of his indiscreet open sessions with Mahmood to instruct him on centrifuge technology. Khan began to fear for his safety in the Netherlands, ultimately insisting on returning home.

===Khan Research Laboratories and atomic bomb program===

In April 1976, Khan joined the atomic bomb program and became part of the enrichment division, initially collaborating with Khalil Qureshi – a physical chemist. Calculations performed by him were valuable contributions to centrifuges and a vital link to nuclear weapon research, but continue to push for his ideas for feasibility of weapon-grade uranium even though it had a low priority, with most efforts still aimed to produce military-grade plutonium. Because of his interest in uranium metallurgy and his frustration at having been passed over for director of the uranium division (the job was instead given to Bashiruddin Mahmood), Khan refused to engage in further calculations and caused tensions with other researchers. Khan became highly unsatisfied and bored with the research led by Mahmood – finally, he submitted a critical report to Bhutto, in which he explained that the &quot;enrichment program&quot; was nowhere near success.

Upon reviewing the report, Bhutto sensed a great danger as the scientists were split between military-grade uranium and plutonium and informed Khan to take over the enrichment division from Mahmood, who separated the program from PAEC by founding the Engineering Research Laboratories (ERL). The ERL functioned directly under the Army&#x27;s Corps of Engineers, with Khan being its chief scientist, and the army engineers located the national site at isolated lands in Kahuta for the enrichment program as ideal site for preventing accidents.

The PAEC did not forgo their electromagnetic isotope separation program, and a parallel program was led by G. D. Alam at the Air Research Laboratories (ARL) located at Chaklala Air Force Base, even though Alam had not seen a centrifuge, and only had a rudimentary knowledge of the Manhattan Project. During this time, Alam accomplished a great feat by perfectly balancing the rotation of the first generation of centrifuge to ~30,000 rpm and was immediately dispatched to ERL which was suffering from many setbacks in setting up its own program under Khan&#x27;s direction based on centrifuge technology dependent on URENCO&#x27;s methods. Khan eventually committed to work on problems involving the differential equations concerning the rotation around fixed axis to perfectly balance the machine under influence of gravity and the design of first generation of centrifuges became functional after Khan and Alam succeeded in separating the 235U and 238U isotopes from raw natural uranium.

In the military circles, Khan&#x27;s scientific ability was well recognised and was often known with his moniker &quot;Centrifuge Khan&quot; and the national laboratory was renamed after him upon the visit of President Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq in 1983. In spite of his role, Khan was never in charge of the actual designs of the nuclear devices, their calculations, and eventual weapons testing which remained under the directorship of Munir Ahmad Khan and the PAEC.

The PAEC&#x27;s senior scientists who worked with him and under him remember him as &quot;an egomaniacal lightweight&quot; given to exaggerating his scientific achievements in centrifuges. At one point, Munir Khan said that, &quot;most of the scientists who work on the development of atomic bomb projects were extremely &#x27;serious&#x27;. They were sobered by the weight of what they don&#x27;t know; Abdul Qadeer Khan is a showman.&quot; During the timeline of the bomb program, Khan published papers on analytical mechanics of balancing of rotating masses and thermodynamics with mathematical rigour to compete, but still failed to impress his fellow theorists at PAEC, generally in the physics community. In later years, Khan became a staunch critic of Munir Khan&#x27;s research in physics, and on many occasions tried unsuccessfully to belittle Munir Khan&#x27;s role in the atomic bomb projects. Their scientific rivalry became public and widely popular in the physics community and seminars held in the country over the years.

===Nuclear tests: Chagai-I===


Many of his theorists were unsure that military-grade uranium would be feasible on time without the centrifuges, since Alam had notified PAEC that the &quot;blueprints were incomplete&quot; and &quot;lacked the scientific information needed even for the basic gas-centrifuges&quot;. Calculations by Tasneem Shah, and confirmed by Alam, showed that Khan&#x27;s earlier estimation of the quantity of uranium needing enrichment for the production of weapon-grade uranium was possible, even with the small number of centrifuges deployed.

Khan produced the designs of the centrifuges from URENCO. However, they were riddled with serious technical errors, and while he bought some components for analysis, they were broken pieces, making them useless for quick assembly of a centrifuge. Its separative work unit (SWU) rate was extremely low, so that it would have to be rotated for thousands of RPMs at the cost of millions of taxpayers money, Alam maintained. Though Khan&#x27;s knowledge of copper metallurgy greatly aided the it was the calculations and validation that came from his team of fellow theorists, including mathematician Tasneem Shah and Alam, who solved the differential equations concerning rotation around a fixed axis under the influence of gravity, which led Khan to come up with the innovative centrifuge designs.

Scientists have said that Khan would have never got any closer to success without the assistance of Alam and others. The issue is controversial; Khan maintained to his biographer that when it came to defending the &quot;centrifuge approach&quot; and really putting work into it, both Shah and Alam refused.

Khan was also very critical of PAEC&#x27;s concentrated efforts towards developing a plutonium &#x27;implosion-type&#x27; nuclear devices and provided strong advocacy for the relatively simple &#x27;gun-type&#x27; device that only had to work with high-enriched uranium – a design concept of gun-type device he eventually submitted to Ministry of Energy (MoE) and Ministry of Defense (MoD). Khan downplayed the importance of plutonium despite many of the theorists maintaining that &quot;plutonium and the fuel cycle has its significance&quot;, and he insisted on the uranium route to the Bhutto administration when France&#x27;s offer for an extraction plant was in the offing.

Though he had helped to come up with the centrifuge designs, and had been a long-time proponent of the concept, Khan was not chosen to head the development project to test his nation&#x27;s first nuclear-weapons (his reputation of a thorny personality likely played a role in this) after India conducted its series of nuclear tests, &#x27;Pokhran-II&#x27; in 1998. Intervention by the Chairman Joint Chiefs, General Jehangir Karamat, allowed Khan to be a participant and eye-witness his nation&#x27;s first nuclear test, &#x27;Chagai-I&#x27; in 1998. At a news conference, Khan confirmed the testing of the boosted fission devices while stating that it was KRL&#x27;s highly enriched uranium (HEU) that was used in the detonation of Pakistan&#x27;s first nuclear devices on 28 May 1998.

Many of Khan&#x27;s colleagues were irritated that he seemed to enjoy taking full credit for something he had only a small part in, and in response, he authored an article, &quot;Torch-Bearers&quot;, which appeared in &quot;The News International&quot;, emphasising that he was not alone in the weapon&#x27;s development. He made an attempt to work on the Teller–Ulam design for the hydrogen bomb, but the military strategists had objected to the idea as it went against the government&#x27;s policy of minimum credible deterrence. Khan often got engrossed in projects which were theoretically interesting but practically unfeasible.

==Proliferation controversy==

In the 1970s, Khan had been very vocal about establishing a network to acquire imported electronic materials from the Dutch firms and had very little trust of PAEC&#x27;s domestic manufacturing of materials, despite the government accepting PAEC&#x27;s arguments for the long term sustainability of the nuclear weapons program. At one point, Khan reached out to the People&#x27;s Republic of China for acquiring the uranium hexafluoride (UF6) when he attended a conference there – the Pakistani Government sent it back to the People&#x27;s Republic of China, asking KRL to use the UF6 supplied by PAEC. In an investigative report published by Nuclear Threat Initiative, Chinese scientists were reportedly present at Khan Research Laboratories (KRL) in Kahuta in the early 1980s. In 1996, the U.S. intelligence community maintained that China provided magnetic rings for special suspension bearings mounted at the top of rotating centrifuge cylinders. In 2005, it was revealed that President Zia-ul-Haq&#x27;s military government had KRL run a HEU programme in the Chinese nuclear weapons program. Khan said that &quot;KRL has built a centrifuge facility for China in Hanzhong city&quot;. China also exported some of DF-11&#x27;s ballistic missile technology to Pakistan, where Pakistan&#x27;s Ghaznavi and Shaheen-II borrowed from DF-11 technology.

In 1982, an unnamed Arab country reached out to Khan for the sale of centrifuge technology. Khan was very receptive to the financial offer, but one scientist alerted the Zia administration which investigated the matter, only for Khan to vehemently deny such an offer was made to him. The Zia administration tasked Major-General Ali Nawab, an engineering officer, to keep surveillance on Khan, which he did until 1983 when he retired from his military service, and Khan&#x27;s activities went undetected for several years after.

===Court controversy and U.S. objections===
In 1979, the Dutch government eventually probed Khan on suspicion of nuclear espionage but he was not prosecuted due to lack of evidence, though it did file a criminal complaint against him in a local court in Amsterdam, which sentenced him &quot;in absentia&quot; in 1985 to four years in prison. Upon learning of the sentence, Khan filed an appeal through his attorney, S. M. Zafar, who teamed up with the administration of Leuven University, and successfully argued that the technical information requested by Khan was commonly found and taught in undergraduate and doctoral physics at the university – the court exonerated Khan by overturning his sentence on a legal technicality. Reacting to the suspicions of espionage, Khan stressed that: &quot;I had requested for it as we had no library of our own at KRL, at that time. All the research work [at Kahuta] was the result of our innovation and struggle. We did not receive any technical &#x27;know-how&#x27; from abroad, but we cannot reject the use of books, magazines, and research papers in this connection.&quot;

In 1979, the Zia administration, which was making an effort to keep their nuclear capability discreet to avoid pressure from the Reagan administration of the United States (U.S.), nearly lost its patience with Khan when he reportedly attempted to meet with a local journalist to announce the existence of the enrichment program. During the Indian Operation Brasstacks military exercise in 1987, Khan gave another interview to local press and stated: &quot;the Americans had been well aware of the success of the atomic quest of Pakistan&quot;, allegedly confirming the speculation of technology export. At both instances, the Zia administration sharply denied Khan&#x27;s statement and a furious President Zia met with Khan and used a &quot;tough tone&quot;, promising Khan severe repercussions had he not retracted all of his statements, which Khan immediately did by contacting several news correspondents.

In 1996, Khan again appeared on his country&#x27;s news channels and maintained that &quot;at no stage was the program of producing 90% weapons-grade enriched uranium ever stopped&quot;, despite Benazir Bhutto&#x27;s administration reaching an understanding with the United States Clinton administration to cap the program to 3% enrichment in 1990.

===North Korea, Iran, and Libya===
The innovation and improved designs of centrifuges were marked as classified for export restriction by the Pakistan government, though Khan was still in possession of earlier designs of centrifuges from when he worked for URENCO in the 1970s. In 1990, the United States alleged that highly sensitive information was being exported to North Korea in exchange for rocket engines. Pakistan&#x27;s Ghauri missile was based entirely on North Korea&#x27;s Rodong-1 as reflected in its technology. The project was supported by Benazir Bhutto who consulted for the project with North Korea and facilitated the technology transfer to Khan Research Laboratories in 1993.

On multiple occasions, Khan levelled accusations against Benazir Bhutto&#x27;s administration of providing secret enrichment information, on a compact disc (CD), to North Korea; these accusations were denied by Benazir Bhutto&#x27;s staff and military personnel.

Between 1987 and 1989, Khan secretly leaked knowledge of centrifuges to Iran without notifying the Pakistan Government, although this issue is a subject of political controversy. In 2003, the European Union pressured Iran to accept tougher inspections of its nuclear program and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) revealed an enrichment facility in the city of Natanz, Iran, utilising gas centrifuges based on the designs and methods used by URENCO. The IAEA inspectors quickly identified the centrifuges as &quot;P-1&quot; types, which had been obtained &quot;from a foreign intermediary in 1989&quot;, and the Iranian negotiators turned over the names of their suppliers, which identified Khan as one of them. Heinz Mebus, a German engineer and businessman and college friend of Khan, was named as one of the suppliers - acting as a middleman for Khan.

In May 1998, &quot;Newsweek&quot; reported that Khan had sent Iraq centrifuge designs, which were apparently confiscated by the UNMOVIC officials. Iraqi officials said &quot;the documents were authentic but that they had not agreed to work with A. Q. Khan, fearing an ISI sting operation, due to strained relations between two countries. 

On June 7, 1998, 10 days after Pakistan&#x27;s first underground nuclear test, there was yet another incident according to Foreign Policy. Kim Sa Nae, wife of a midlevel North Korean &quot;diplomat&quot;, who was invited by Khan as part of a 20-member delegation was shot to death a few yards from Khan&#x27;s official residence after she was suspected to be a spy for the United States by the ISI that subsequently informed the North Korean authorities. Privately, some Pakistani intelligence sources leaked this information to the Los Angeles Times. 3 days after Kim&#x27;s death, both P-1 and P-2 centrifuges, warheads, and technical data, along with Kim&#x27;s body, were flown to North Korea in the same American made C-130 cargo plane that was making rounds between Pakistan and North Korea from 1997-2002.

In 2003, merchant vessel &quot;BBC China&quot; was caught carrying nuclear centrifuges to Libya from Malaysia, the Scomi Group and Khan Research Laboratories were supplying nuclear parts to Libya through Khan&#x27;s Dubai-based Sri Lankan associate Buhary Syed Abu Tahir. This was further revealed in the Scomi Precision Engineering nuclear scandal surrounding Scomi CEO Shah Hakim Zain and , son of former Malaysian Prime Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi.

Libya negotiated with the United States to roll back its nuclear program to have economic sanctions lifted, effected by the Iran and Libya Sanctions Act, and shipped centrifuges to the United States that were identified as &quot;P-1&quot; models by the American inspectors. Ultimately, the Bush administration launched its investigation of Khan, focusing on his personal role, when Libya handed over a list of its suppliers. Friedrich Tinner, a nuclear engineer and friend of Khan since their days at the Leuven University, was one of the heads of Libya&#x27;s nuclear programme and worked in nuclear enrichment for Libya and Pakistan. In 2008, German nuclear engineer was convicted and sentenced to five years and six months in prison for procuring centrifuges for Libya from Khan, Lerch also acted as Khan&#x27;s middleman for Iran. Alfred Hempel, a German businessman, arranged the shipment of gas centrifuge parts from Khan in Pakistan to Libya and Iran via Dubai.

The &quot;A.Q. Khan network&quot; involved numerous shell companies set-up by Khan in Dubai to obtain equipment necessary for nuclear enrichment. From 1999 onwards, Khan traveled to Dubai 41 times according to the Pakistan government. Khan also kept a penthouse on posh al-Maktoum Road. The shell companies consisting of &quot;a fax machine and an empty office&quot; would be used to facilitate shipments and shut down immediately after the deals. of Iran&#x27;s Defense Industries Organization was involved in nuclear proliferation for Iran and North Korea through China. Parts needed for nuclear enrichment in Pakistan were also imported by Khan from several Japanese companies.

===Security hearings, pardon, and aftermath===
Starting in 2001, Khan served as an adviser on science and technology in the Musharraf administration and had become a public figure who enjoyed much support from his country&#x27;s political conservative sphere. In 2003, the Bush administration reportedly turned over evidence of a nuclear proliferation network that implicated Khan&#x27;s role to the Musharraf administration. Khan was dismissed from his post on 31 January 2004. On 4 February 2004, Khan appeared on Pakistan Television (PTV) and confessed to running a proliferation ring, and transferring technology to Iran between 1989 and 1991, and to North Korea and Libya between 1991 and 1997. The Musharraf administration avoided arresting Khan but launched security hearings on Khan who confessed to the military investigators that former Chief of Army Staff General Mirza Aslam Beg had given authorisation for technology transfer to Iran.

On 5 February 2004, President Pervez Musharraf issued a pardon to Khan as he feared that the issue would be politicised by his political rivals. Despite the pardon, Khan, who had strong conservative support, had badly damaged the political credibility of the Musharraf administration and the image of the United States who was attempting to win hearts and minds of local populations during the height of the Insurgency in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. While the local television news media aired sympathetic documentaries on Khan, the opposition parties in the country protested so strongly that the U.S. Embassy in Islamabad had pointed out to the Bush administration that the successor to Musharraf could be less friendly towards the United States. This restrained the Bush administration from applying further &quot;direct&quot; pressure on Musharraf due to a strategic calculation that it might cause the loss of Musharraf as an ally.
In December 2006, the Weapons of Mass Destruction Commission (WMDC), headed by Hans Blix, stated that Khan could not have acted alone &quot;without the awareness of the Pakistan Government&quot;. Blix&#x27;s statement was also reciprocated by the United States government, with one anonymous American government intelligence official quoted by independent journalist and author Seymour Hersh: &quot;Suppose if Edward Teller had suddenly decided to spread nuclear technology around the world. Could he really do that without the American government knowing?&quot;.

In 2007, the U.S. and European Commission politicians as well as IAEA officials had made several strong calls to have Khan interrogated by IAEA investigators, given the lingering scepticism about the disclosures made by Pakistan, but Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz, who remained supportive of Khan and spoke highly of him, strongly dismissed the calls by terming it as &quot;case closed&quot;.

In 2008, the security hearings were officially terminated by Chairman joint chiefs General Tariq Majid who marked the details of debriefings as &quot;classified&quot;. In 2008, in an interview, Khan laid the whole blame on former President Pervez Musharraf, and labelled Musharraf as the &quot;Big Boss&quot; for proliferation deals. In 2012, Khan also implicated Benazir Bhutto&#x27;s administration in proliferation matters, pointing to the fact as she had issued &quot;clear directions in thi[s] regard.&quot; Khan also said that he was persecuted because he was a Muhajir.

==Government work, academia, and political advocacy==

Khan&#x27;s strong advocacy for nuclear sharing of technology eventually led to his ostracisation by much of the scientific community, but Khan was still quite welcome in his country&#x27;s political and military circles. After leaving the directorship of the Khan Research Laboratories in 2001, Khan briefly joined the Musharraf administration as a policy adviser on science and technology on a request from President Musharraf. In this capacity, Khan promoted increased defence spending on his nation&#x27;s missile program to counter the perceived threats from the Indian missile program and advised the Musharraf administration on space policy. He presented the idea of using the &quot;Ghauri&quot; missile system as an expendable launch system to launch satellites into space.

At the height of the proliferation controversy in 2007, Khan was paid tribute by Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz on state television while commenting in the last part of his speech, Aziz stressed: &quot;The services of [nuclear] scientist ... Dr. [Abdul] Qadeer Khan are &quot;unforgettable&quot; for the country&quot;.

In the 1990s, Khan secured a fellowship with the Pakistan Academy of Sciences – he served as its president in 1996–97. Khan published two books on material science and started publishing his articles from KRL in the 1980s. Gopal S. Upadhyaya, an Indian metallurgist who attended Khan&#x27;s conference and met him along with Kuldip Nayar, reportedly described him as being a proud Pakistani who wanted to show the world that scientists from Pakistan are inferior to no one in the world. Khan also served as project director of Ghulam Ishaq Khan Institute of Engineering Sciences and Technology and briefly tenured as professor of physics before joining the faculty of the Hamdard University; where he remained on the board of directors of the university up until his death in 2021. Later, Khan helped established the A. Q. Khan Institute of Biotechnology and Genetic Engineering at Karachi University.

In 2012, Khan announced the formation of a conservative political advocacy group, Tehreek-e-Tahaffuz-e-Pakistan (&#x27;Movement for the Protection of Pakistan&#x27;). It was subsequently dissolved in 2013.

==Illness and death==
In August 2021, Khan was admitted to Khan Research Laboratories Hospital after testing positive for COVID-19. Khan died on 10 October 2021, at the age of 85, after being transferred to a hospital in Islamabad with lung problems. He was given a state funeral at the Faisal Mosque before being buried at the H-8 graveyard in Islamabad.

The Prime Minister of Pakistan, Imran Khan, expressed grief over his death in a tweet adding that &quot;for the people of Pakistan he was a national icon&quot;. President of Pakistan Arif Alvi also expressed sadness adding that &quot;a grateful nation will never forget his services&quot;.

==Legacy==

During his time in the atomic bomb project, Khan pioneered research in the thermal quantum field theory and condensed matter physics, while he co-authored articles on chemical reactions of the highly unstable isotope particles in the controlled physical system. He maintained his stance of the use of controversial technological solutions to both military and civilian problems, including the use of military technologies for civilian welfare. Khan also remained a vigorous advocate for a nuclear testing program and defence strength through nuclear weapons. He justified Pakistan&#x27;s nuclear deterrence program as sparing his country the fate of Iraq or Libya. In an interview in 2011, Khan maintained his stance on peace through strength and vigorously defended the nuclear weapons program as part of the deterrence policy:

During his work on the nuclear weapons program and onwards, Khan faced heated and intense criticism from his fellow theorists, most notably Pervez Hoodbhoy who contested his scientific understanding in quantum physics. In addition, Khan&#x27;s false claims that he was the &quot;father&quot; of the atomic bomb project since its inception and his personal attacks on Munir Ahmad Khan caused even greater animosity from his fellow theorists, and most particularly, within the general physics community, such as the Pakistan Physics Society.

Various motivations have been cited for Khan&#x27;s role in the proliferation of nuclear weapons. According to the editor-in-chief of &quot;Foreign Policy&quot;, Moisés Naím, although his actions were certainly ideological or political in nature, Khan&#x27;s motives remain essentially financial. This is evidenced, according to him, by his commercial maneuvers, his presence in North Korean trade as well as his real estate ownerships. For instance, Khan owned the Hendrina Khan Hotel in Timbuktu, named after his wife. It was one of dozens of his commercial enterprises. To build his hotel in Timbuktu, he reportedly used a Pakistan Air Force C-130 transport aircraft in the early 2000s to transport carved wooden furniture. The plane landed at Tripoli Airport in Libya and the cargo was then taken to Timbuktu by road as it was unable to land in Mali. Khan himself accompanied the furniture from Islamabad. His wife, two daughters and brother Abdul Quyuim Khan were all named in the Panama Papers in 2016 as owners of Wahdat Ltd., an offshore company registered in the Bahamas.

Bruno Tertrais, a senior researcher at the Foundation for Strategic Research states: &quot;Khan&#x27;s motivations were complex and evolving (...) The primary motivation seems to have been to ensure the legitimacy of his role in building Pakistan&#x27;s nuclear force (...) The second motivation, which has become more important over time, is personal enrichment. Finally, the third important element of varying importance depending on the hypothesis: Khan&#x27;s more or less diffuse desire to see other Muslim countries access nuclear power.&quot;

In spite of the proliferation controversy and his volatile personality, Khan remained a popular public figure and has been as a symbol of national pride with many in Pakistan who see him as a national hero. While Khan has been bestowed with many medals and honours by the federal government and universities in Pakistan, Khan also remains the only citizen of Pakistan to have been honoured twice with the Nishan-e-Imtiaz.

<text>Parrotfish are a group of fish species traditionally regarded as a family (Scaridae), but now often treated as a subfamily (Scarinae) or tribe (Scarini) of the wrasses (Labridae). With roughly 95 species, this group&#x27;s largest species richness is in the Indo-Pacific. They are found in coral reefs, rocky coasts, and seagrass beds, and can play a significant role in bioerosion.

==Description==

Parrotfish are named for their dentition, which is distinct from other fish, including other labrids. Their numerous teeth are arranged in a tightly packed mosaic on the external surface of their jaw bones, forming a parrot-like beak with which they rasp algae from coral and other rocky substrates (which contributes to the process of bioerosion).

Maximum sizes vary within the group, with the majority of species reaching in length. However, a few species reach lengths in excess of , and the green humphead parrotfish can reach up to . The smallest species is the bluelip parrotfish (&quot;Cryptotomus roseus&quot;), which has a maximum size of .

==Mucus==
Some parrotfish species, including the queen parrotfish (&quot;Scarus vetula&quot;), secrete a mucus cocoon, particularly at night. Prior to going to sleep, some species extrude mucus from their mouths, forming a protective cocoon that envelops the fish, presumably hiding its scent from potential predators. This mucus envelope may also act as an early warning system, allowing the parrotfish to flee when it detects predators such as moray eels disturbing the membrane. The skin itself is covered in another mucous substance which may have antioxidant properties helpful in repairing bodily damage, or repelling parasites, in addition to providing protection from UV light.

==Feeding==
Most parrotfish species are herbivores, feeding mainly on epilithic algae. A wide range of other small organisms are sometimes eaten, including invertebrates (sessile and benthic species, as well as zooplankton), bacteria and detritus. A few mostly larger species such as the green humphead parrotfish (&quot;Bolbometopon muricatum&quot;) feed extensively on living coral (polyps). None of these are exclusive corallivores, but polyps can make up as much as half their diet or even more in the green humphead parrotfish. Overall it has been estimated that fewer than one percent of parrotfish bites involve live corals and all except the green humphead parrotfish prefer algae-covered surfaces over live corals. Nevertheless, when they do eat coral polyps, localized coral death can occur. Their feeding activity is important for the production and distribution of coral sands in the reef biome, and can prevent algal overgrowth of the reef structure. The teeth grow continuously, replacing material worn away by feeding. Whether they feed on coral, rock or seagrasses, the substrate is ground up between the pharyngeal teeth. After they digest the edible portions from the rock, they excrete it as sand, helping create small islands and the sandy beaches. The humphead parrotfish can produce of sand each year. Or, on average (as there are so many variables i.e. size/species/location/depth etc.), almost per parrotfish per day.
While feeding, parrotfish must be cognizant of predation by one of their main predators, the lemon shark. On Caribbean coral reefs, parrotfish are important consumers of sponges. An indirect effect of parrotfish grazing on sponges is the protection of reef-building corals that would otherwise be overgrown by fast-growing sponge species.

Analysis of parrotfish feeding biology describes three functional groups: excavators, scrapers and browsers. Excavators have larger, stronger jaws that can gouge the substrate, leaving visible scars on the surface. Scrapers have less powerful jaws that can but infrequently do leave visible scraping scars on the substrate. Some of these may also feed on sand instead of hard surfaces. Browsers mainly feed on seagrasses and their epiphytes. Mature excavating species include &quot;Bolbometopon muricatum&quot;, &quot;Cetoscarus&quot;, &quot;Chlorurus&quot; and &quot;Sparisoma viride&quot;. These excavating species all feed as scrapers in early juvenile stages, but &quot;Hipposcarus&quot; and &quot;Scarus&quot;, which also feed as scrapers in early juvenile stages, retain the scraping feeding mode as adults. Browsing species are found in the genera &quot;Calotomus&quot;, &quot;Cryptotomus&quot;, &quot;Leptoscarus&quot;, &quot;Nicholsina&quot; and &quot;Sparisoma&quot;. Feeding modes reflect habitat preferences, with browsers chiefly living in the grassy seabed, and excavators and scrapers on coral reefs.

Recently, the microphage feeding hypothesis challenged the prevailing paradigm of parrotfish as algal consumers by proposing that:

Microscopy and molecular barcoding of coral reef substrate bitten by scraping and excavating parrotfish suggest that coral reef cyanobacteria from the order Nostocales are important in the feeding of these parrotfish. Additional microscopy and molecular barcoding research indicates that some parrotfish may ingest microscopic biota associated with endolithic sponges.

==Life cycle==
Most tropical species form large schools when feeding and these are often grouped by size. Harems of several females presided over by a single male are normal in most species, with the males vigorously defending their position from any challenge.
As pelagic spawners, parrotfish release many tiny, buoyant eggs into the water, which become part of the plankton. The eggs float freely, settling into the coral until hatching.

=== Sex change ===
The development of parrotfishes is complex and accompanied by a series of changes in sex and colour (polychromatism). Most species are sequential hermaphrodites, starting as females (known as the initial phase) and then changing to males (the terminal phase). In many species, for example the stoplight parrotfish (&quot;Sparisoma viride&quot;), a number of individuals develop directly to males (i.e., they do not start as females). These directly developing males usually most resemble the initial phase, and often display a different mating strategy than the terminal phase males of the same species. A few species such as the Mediterranean parrotfish (&quot;S. cretense&quot;) are secondary gonochorists. This means that some females do not change sex (they remain females throughout their lives), the ones that do change from female to male do it while still immature (reproductively functioning females do not change to males) and there are no males with female-like colors (the initial phase males in other parrotfish). The marbled parrotfish (&quot;Leptoscarus vaigiensis&quot;) is the only species of parrotfish known not to change sex. In most species, the initial phase is dull red, brown, or grey, while the terminal phase is vividly green or blue with bright pink, orange or yellow patches. In a smaller number of species the phases are similar, and in the Mediterranean parrotfish the adult female is brightly colored, while the adult male is gray. In most species, juveniles have a different color pattern from adults. Juveniles of some tropical species can alter their color temporarily to mimic other species. Where the sexes and ages differ, the remarkably different phases often were first described as separate species. As a consequence early scientists recognized more than 350 parrotfish species, which is almost four times the actual number.

The sex change in parrotfishes is accompanied by changes in circulating steroids. Females have high levels of estradiol, moderate levels of T and undetectable levels of the major fish androgen 11-ketotestosterone. During the transition from initial to terminal coloration phases, concentrations of 11-ketotestosterone rise dramatically and estrogen levels decline. If a female is injected with 11-ketotestosterone, it will cause a precocious change in gonadal, gametic and behavioural sex.

==Economic importance==
A commercial fishery exists for some of the larger species, particularly in the Indo-Pacific, but also for a few others like the Mediterranean parrotfish. Protecting parrotfishes is proposed as a way of saving Caribbean coral reefs from being overgrown with seaweed and sponges. Despite their striking colors, their feeding behavior renders them highly unsuitable for most marine aquaria.

A new study has discovered that the parrotfish is extremely important for the health of the Great Barrier Reef; it is the only one of thousands of reef fish species that regularly performs the task of scraping and cleaning inshore coral reefs.

==Taxonomy==
Traditionally, the parrotfishes have been considered to be a family level taxon, Scaridae. Although phylogenetic and evolutionary analyses of parrotfishes are ongoing, they are now accepted to be a clade in the tribe Cheilini, and are now commonly referred to as scarine labrids (subfamily Scarinae, family Labridae). Some authorities have preferred to maintain the parrotfishes as a family-level taxon, resulting in Labridae not being monophyletic (unless split into several families).

The World Register of Marine Species divides the group into two subfamilies as follows:
* subfamily Scarinae
** genus &quot;Bolbometopon&quot; (1 species)
** genus &quot;Cetoscarus&quot; (2 species)
** genus &quot;Chlorurus&quot; (18 species)
** genus &quot;Hipposcarus&quot; (2 species)
** genus &quot;Scarus&quot; (53 species)
* subfamily Sparisomatinae
** genus &quot;Calotomus&quot; (5 species)
** genus &quot;Cryptotomus&quot; (1 species)
** genus &quot;Leptoscarus&quot; (1 species)
** genus &quot;Nicholsina&quot; (3 species)
** genus &quot;Sparisoma&quot; (15 species)

Some sources retain the Scaridae as a family, placing it alongside the wrasses of the family Labridae and the weed whitings Odacidae in the order Labriformes, part of the Percomorpha. They also do not support the division of the Scaridae into two subfamilies.

<text>The lithology of a rock unit is a description of its physical characteristics visible at outcrop, in hand or core samples, or with low magnification microscopy. Physical characteristics include colour, texture, grain size, and composition. Lithology may refer to either a detailed description of these characteristics, or a summary of the gross physical character of a rock. Examples of lithologies in the second sense include sandstone, slate, basalt, or limestone. 

Lithology is the basis of subdividing rock sequences into individual lithostratigraphic units for the purposes of mapping and correlation between areas. In certain applications, such as site investigations, lithology is described using a standard terminology such as in the European geotechnical standard Eurocode 7.

==Rock type==

The naming of a lithology is based on the rock type. The three major rock types are igneous, sedimentary, and metamorphic. Igneous rocks are formed directly from magma, which is a mixture of molten rock, dissolved gases, and solid crystals. Sedimentary rock is formed from mineral or organic particles that collect at the Earth&#x27;s surface and become lithified. Metamorphic rock forms by recrystallization of existing solid rock under conditions of great heat or pressure.

Igneous rocks are further broken into three broad categories. Igneous rock composed of broken rock fragments created directly by volcanic processes (tephra) are classified as pyroclastic rock. Pyroclastic rocks are further classified by average fragment (clast) size and whether the fragments are mostly individual mineral crystals, particles of volcanic glass, or rock fragments. Further classifications, such as by chemical composition, may also be applied. Igneous rocks that have visible mineral grains (phaneritic rocks) are classified as intrusive, while those that are glassy or very fine-grained (aphanitic) are classified as extrusive rock. Intrusive igneous rocks are usually classified using the QAPF classification, which is based on the relative content of quartz, alkali feldspar, plagioclase, and feldspathoid. Special classifications exist for igneous rock of unusual compositions, such as ultramafic rock or carbonatites. Where possible, extrusive igneous rocks are also classified by mineral content using the extrusive QAPF classification, but when determining the mineral composition is impractical, they may be classified chemically using the TAS classification. This is based on the total content of silica and alkali metal oxides and other chemical criteria.

Sedimentary rocks are further classified by whether they are siliciclastic or carbonate. Siliciclastic sedimentary rocks are then subcategorized based on their grain size distribution and the relative proportions of quartz, feldspar, and lithic (rock) fragments. Carbonate rocks are classified with the Dunham or Folk classification schemes according to the constituents of the carbonate rock.

Metamorphic rock naming can be based on protolith, mineral composition, texture, or metamorphic facies. Naming based on texture and a pelite (e.g., shale, mudrock) protolith can be used to define slate and phyllite. Texture-based names are schist and gneiss. These textures, from slate to gneiss, define a continually-increasing extent of metamorphism. Metamorphic facies are defined by the pressure-temperature fields in which particular minerals form. Additional metamorphic rock names exist, such as greenschist (metamorphosed basalt and other extrusive igneous rock) or quartzite (metamorphosed quartz sand).

==Grain/clast size==

In igneous and metamorphic rocks, grain size is a measure of the sizes of the crystals in the rock. In igneous rock, this is used to determine the rate at which the material cooled: large crystals typically indicate intrusive igneous rock, while small crystals indicate that the rock was extrusive. Metamorphism of rock composed of mostly a single mineral, such as quartzite or marble, may increase grain size (grain growth), while metamorphism of sheared rock may decrease grain size (syntectonic recrystallization).

In clastic sedimentary rocks, grain size is the diameter of the grains and/or clasts that constitute the rock. These are used to determine which rock naming system to use (e.g., a conglomerate, sandstone, or mudstone). In the case of sandstones and conglomerates, which cover a wide range of grain sizes, a word describing the grain size range is added to the rock name. Examples are &quot;pebble conglomerate&quot; and &quot;fine quartz arenite&quot;.

==Mineralogy==

In rocks in which mineral grains are large enough to be identified using a hand lens, the visible mineralogy is included as part of the description. In the case of sequences possibly including carbonates, calcite-cemented rocks or those with possible calcite veins, it is normal to test for the presence of calcite (or other forms of calcium carbonate) using dilute hydrochloric acid and looking for effervescence.

The mineralogical composition of a rock is one of the major ways in which it is classified. Igneous rocks are classified by their mineral content whenever practical, using the QAPF classification or special ultramafic or carbonatite classifications. Likewise metamorphic facies, which show the degree to which a rock has been exposed to heat and pressure and are therefore important in classifying metamorphic rocks, are determined by observing the mineral phases that are present in a sample.

==Colour==
The colour of a rock or its component parts is a distinctive characteristic of some rocks and is always recorded, sometimes against standard colour charts, such as that produced by the Rock-Color Chart Committee of the Geological Society of America based on the Munsell color system.

==Fabric==
The fabric of a rock describes the spatial and geometric configuration of all the elements that make it up. In sedimentary rocks the main visible fabric is normally bedding, and the scale and degree of development of the bedding is normally recorded as part of the description. Metamorphic rocks (apart from those created by contact metamorphism), are characterised by well-developed planar and linear fabrics. Igneous rocks may also have fabrics as a result of flow or the settling out of particular mineral phases during crystallisation, forming cumulates.

==Texture==

The texture of a rock describes the relationship between the individual grains or clasts that make up the rock. Sedimentary textures include the degree of sorting, grading, shape and roundness of the clasts. Metamorphic textures include those referring to the timing of growth of large metamorphic minerals relative to a phase of deformation—before deformation porphyroclast—after deformation porphyroblast. Igneous textures include such properties as grain shape, which varies from crystals with ideal crystal shapes (euhedral) to irregular crystals (anhedral), whether the rock shows highly nonuniform crystal sizes (is porphyritic), or whether grains are aligned (which is described as trachytic texture).

==Small-scale structures==

Rocks often contain small-scale structures (smaller than the scale of an individual outcrop). In sedimentary rocks this may include sole markings, ripple marks, mudcracks and cross-bedding. These are recorded as they are generally characteristic of a particular depositional environment and may provide information on paleocurrent directions. In metamorphic rocks associated with the deeper levels of fault zones, small scale structures such as asymmetric boudins and microfolds are used to determine the sense of displacement across the zone. In igneous rocks, small-scale structures are mostly observed in lavas such as pahoehoe versus ʻAʻā basaltic flows, and pillows showing eruption within a body of water or beneath ice.

==Surficial lithology==
Unconsolidated surficial materials may also be given a lithology. This is defined by grain size and composition and is often attached to an interpretation of how the unit formed. Surficial lithologies can be given to lacustrine, coastal, fluvial, aeolian, glacial, and recent volcanic deposits, among others.

<doc id="452190" wikidata="Q2553002" url="?curid=452190" title="Wayland's Smithy">
<text>Wayland&#x27;s Smithy is an Early Neolithic chambered long barrow located near the village of Ashbury in the south-central English county of Oxfordshire. The barrow is believed to have been constructed about 3600 BCE by pastoral communities shortly after the introduction of agriculture to the British Isles from continental Europe. Although part of an architectural tradition of long barrow building that was widespread across Neolithic Europe, Wayland&#x27;s Smithy belongs to a localised regional variant of barrows - found only in south-west of Britain - known as the Severn-Cotswold group. Wayland&#x27;s Smithy is one of the best surviving examples of this type of barrow. 

The site&#x27;s appearance is a result of restoration following excavations undertaken by archaeologists, Stuart Piggott and Richard Atkinson, in 1962–63. Their research of the site showed it had been built in two different phases. First as a timber-chambered oval barrow built around 3590 and 3550 BCE and then later as a stone-chambered long barrow in around 3460 to 3400 BCE. The barrow is on the same hill range as Uffington White Horse and Uffington Castle; it is also close to The Ridgeway, the ancient trackway across the Berkshire Downs. 

The barrow, which is a scheduled monument, is under the guardianship of English Heritage and open all year round. It has been used as a ritual site in modern Paganism since the late 20th century.

==Toponym==

Wayland&#x27;s Smithy is one of many prehistoric sites associated with Wayland or &quot;Wolund&quot;, a Germanic smith-god. This character appears in Norse mythology, and a depiction of him is believed to be present on the Franks Casket, on display in the British Museum in London. It was most likely named by the Saxons who settled in the area some four thousand years after Wayland&#x27;s Smithy was built. The first recorded mention of the name is in an early medieval land deed (908AD) from Compton Beauchamp, which documented in a charter from King Eadred in 955AD.

==Description==
The Early Neolithic era was a revolutionary period of British history. Between 4500 and 3800 BC, it saw a widespread change in lifestyle as the communities living in the British Isles adopted agriculture as their primary form of subsistence, abandoning the hunter-gatherer lifestyle that had characterised the preceding Mesolithic period. This came about through contact with continental societies, although it is unclear to what extent this can be attributed to an influx of migrants or to indigenous Mesolithic Britons adopting agricultural technologies from the continent.

With new technologies, Neolithic societies in Britain began to emulate European funerary practices. The wooden mortuary house mainly consisted of a paved stone floor with two large posts at either end. A single crouched burial had been placed at one end and, the mostly disarticulated remains of a further 14 individuals were scattered in front of it. Analysis of these remains indicated that they had been subjected to excarnation before burial and deposited in possibly four different phases. Postholes at one end have been interpreted as supporting a timber facade. An earth barrow covered the whole monument with material excavated from two flanking ditches and measured around wide and deep.

The later stone tomb consists of two opposing transept chambers and terminal chamber; along with the longer entrance chamber, this gives the burial area a cruciform appearance in plan. At the entrance four large sarsen stones stand (originally six, but two are lost), having been returned to their upright locations following the 1962 excavations. It is classified by archaeologists as one of the Severn-Cotswold tombs. The large trapezoidal earth barrow erected over it was revetted with a stone kerb and its material was again excavated from two large flanking ditches. Excavation in 1919 revealed the jumbled remains of seven adults and one child.

The site is important as it illustrates a transition from a timber-chambered barrow to stone-chamber tomb over a period that may have been as short as 50 years. Carbon dating of the burials in the second tomb suggests it was a late use of this style of burial, being similar to West Kennet Long Barrow, which had been in use 200 years before.

==Antiquarian historiography ==
In 1738, Francis Wise, who was then the under-keeper of the Bodleian Library, recorded a belief held about the site in local folklore. Like several other early commentators, Wise referred to the site not as &quot;Wayland&#x27;s Smithy&quot;, but only as &quot;Wayland Smith&quot;. Wise related that:

: All the account which the country people are able to give of it is &#x27;At this place lived formerly an invisible Smith, and if a traveller&#x27;s Horse had lost a Shoe upon the road, he had no more to do than to bring the Horse to this place with a piece of money, and leaving both there for some little time, he might come again and find the money gone, but the Horse new shod.

The site was also mentioned in a letter sent to the antiquarian William Stukeley by his daughter Anna on 3 October 1758. There is some folklore associating witch relics with the site. It is referred to as &quot;Wayland Smith&#x27;s Forge&quot; in Walter Scott&#x27;s 1821 novel &quot;Kenilworth&quot;. In 1828, a one-inch Ordnance Survey map recorded the site&#x27;s name as being &quot;Wayland Smith&#x27;s Forge&quot;. The folklorist and archaeologist Leslie Grinsell suggested that the decision to name it this on the map was influenced by Scott&#x27;s novel.

==Modern use==
The deposition of coins at the site has taken place since at least the 1960s, with visitors lodging the coins into cracks in the site&#x27;s stones. As of 2015, the local wardens from The National Trust are tasked with removing said deposits, and &quot;circa&quot; 2010 English Heritage removed information about the coin deposition custom from the site&#x27;s information panel. The coins removed by the wardens are then donated to local charities. As the folklorist Ceri Houlbrook noted, all of this deposited material &quot;contributes to the ritual narrative of a site&quot;. 

Modern Pagans, including Druids and Heathens use Wayland&#x27;s Smithy for ritual purposes. Anthropologist Thorsten Gieser thinks the modern ritualistic use of the site by new age religions to communicate with &quot;ancestors&quot;, &quot;spirits of the earth&quot;, and an &quot;earth goddess&quot; is symbolic of its folkloric links to Wayland and its use as a prehistoric burial ground. However, in 2019, concern were raised that one of the groups using the site for their rituals was &quot;Woden&#x27;s Folk&quot;, a neo-Nazi Heathen movement. The National Trust said it would increase the number of times its rangers visited the site. Graffiti carved into the trees around the site has included swastikas.

==Cultural references==

Walter Scott&#x27;s Elizabethan novel &quot;Kenilworth&quot; (published 1821) features both a chambered underground dwelling and a farrier living in it named &#x27;Wayland Smith&#x27;.

Susan Cooper&#x27;s &quot;The Dark is Rising&quot; series of young-adult novels features a supporting character named Wayland Smith, and deals greatly with English lore and legend.

Julian Cope included a song called &quot;Wayland&#x27;s Smithy Has Wings&quot; on his 1992 album &quot;The Skellington Chronicles&quot;.

Author Patricia Kennealy-Morrison has a protagonist named Turk Wayland in her Rennie Stride mystery series, and sets a scene at the end of the fourth book, &quot;A Hard Slay&#x27;s Night: Murder at the Royal Albert Hall&quot;, at Wayland&#x27;s Smithy.

Rudyard Kipling, in his interlinked collection of stories &quot;Puck of Pook&#x27;s Hill&quot;, set many of the stories near the Smithy, and told of the arrival of the smith god in the first.

Both the Uffington White Horse and Wayland&#x27;s Smithy were incorporated into the BBC miniseries &quot;The Moon Stallion&quot;, produced in 1978. In the serial, set in 1906, the stones are associated with witchcraft.

The British music group Radiohead recorded a music video here for their non-album single &quot;Pop Is Dead&quot;.

<text>Dale Norman Campbell-Savours, Baron Campbell-Savours (born 23 August 1943) is a British Labour Party politician. The Member of Parliament (MP) for Workington from 1979 to 2001, he retired from the House of Commons due to ill health, and now sits in the House of Lords.

==Early life==
Campbell-Savours was educated at Keswick School, the first of three generations: his three sons and grandchildren also attending; and at the Sorbonne. As a student in Paris, he witnessed incidents of violence on Parisian streets during the Algerian War, including a gun battle on the Rue Souflot. He travelled extensively throughout Europe and the Middle East in his early 20s, returning to the UK in the mid 1960s. During his travels, he identified opportunities to use onyx marble as a material in manufacturing processes. He established an onyx clock and metal component manufacturing company in a former felt mill in the Lancashire town of Ramsbottom. Having established a market both at home and overseas, he sold out in 1976. His clocks were widely distributed in the UK and overseas, and trade to this day under the brand name Xavier of London. 

==Parliamentary career==
A councillor on Ramsbottom Urban District Council from 1972–1974, he contested Darwen at both the February 1974 and October 1974 general elections and then Workington at a by-election in 1976. He was elected Member of Parliament for Workington at the 1979 general election. Throughout his 22-year membership of the Commons he was repeatedly subject to periods of illness, on each occasion presenting his party with the prospect of by-elections during politically volatile periods.

Campbell-Savours was opposition spokesman for International Development (1991–1992) and for Food, Agriculture and Rural Affairs (1992–1994), resigning from the front bench in 1994 due to ill health: in 1995 half his lung was removed. He was a member of various select committees including: Public Accounts (1980-1991), Members Interest (1982-1990), Procedure (1984-1989), Agriculture (1994–1996), Standards and Privileges (1996–2001), and the Intelligence and Security Committee (1997–2001). He won a number of backbench awards during his period as a member of the House of Commons. 

His repeated interventions in Parliament in the 1980s on land reclamation following closure of the Workington steel production plant led directly to the establishment of the West Cumberland Enterprise Zones, opening the door to later commercial developments.

Having negotiated the transfer of ownership of Maryport Harbour into the public sector, he secured support for dredging and harbour improvement, persuading William Waldergrave, then Secretary of State, of the need for financial support to deal with the harbour&#x27;s contamination.

In 1990 Campbell-Savours established a research project on electoral reform, designing and stress-testing a new voting system: the Supplementary Vote. The system was adopted by the incoming Labour government in 1997 for the election of City Mayors and Police Commissioners.

During his 1990-1992 tenure as a shadow minister for international development, he spearheaded the creation of a working group with the remit to research the creation of a new Department for International Development (DFID) which was subsequently implemented by the incoming Labour government in 1997.

In 1991 Campbell-Savours conducted a four-year project for the creation of a multi campus university in Cumbria, leading to his 1995 proposal for a University of the Lakes, which came to fruition with the establishment of the University of Cumbria in 2007: Campbell-Savours was appointed a university fellow in recognition of his contribution. In 2002 Campbell-Savours spoke out strongly against the introduction of tuition fees, which he argued would undermine the government&#x27;s apprenticeship training programmes.

As shadow agricultural minister, Campbell-Savours proposed, 1992-94, a national scheme for the registration of cattle for tracking of animal health. This was adopted in 1997, with the British Cattle Movement Service creating employment for over 1,000 people in Workington. 

Prior to his retirement from the Commons, Campbell-Savours negotiated a deal with the Labour government for the local authorities to secure ownership over 1000 acres of land, believed at the time to be contaminated, for the price of £1. After long delays, the land on RNAD Broughton Moor is now being commercially developed. 
Iraq War: Campbell-Savours supported the liberation of Kuwait, and argued strongly for enforcement of the UN sanctions regime against Iraq, making several visits to Washington to make the case. Opposed to occupation, he did support military intervention. He arranged for his office researcher to visit the Iraqi Turkish border to report on oil sanction breeches. During a series of interventions during the debate on the war, he proposed the development of safe havens for Kurdish refugees seeking sanctuary from Saddam Hussain&#x27;s military forces. He later described his subsequent support for the war as the biggest misjudgement of his political life, viewing the war in Iraq as a driver behind the resurgence of militant Islam which subsequently spread across North Africa to Afghanistan and Europe.

In 1996 Campbell-Savours gave evidence to the Nolan Commission on the need for a new code of conduct. A number of the recommendations he and others made were accepted by the commission in its final report: Upholding Standards in Public Life.

==House of Lords==
Campbell-Savours was created a life peer: Baron Campbell-Savours, of Allerdale in the County of Cumbria, on 4 July 2001 and now sits in the House of Lords, serving on select committees including Procedure (2001-2005), Liaison (2005-2009), House (2009-2016), Administration (2008-2015) and Services (2017- )

Campbell-Savours has campaigned for reform of the law on rape, in particular the issue of qualified anonymity for the accused and prosecution of accusers where false accusations are made. In 2006 he used parliamentary privilege to reveal the identity of a serial false accuser, who had previously remained anonymous due to laws which protect women who report sexual assault. His action was praised by some legal practitioners and the Daily Mail, which launched a campaign on anonymity reform. Campaigners from Women Against Rape maintained that the decision to name the woman was illegal, an attack on anonymity laws, and amounted to persecution of women who report rape. The named woman, who was never convicted of perverting the course of justice, said that Campbell-Savours’ decision was a &quot;setback for all victims of sexual assault&quot;. He has raised the lack of anonymity injustice in the cases of Former Prime Minister Edward Heath, the singer Cliff Richard, former Home Secretary Leon Britain, former MP Harvey Proctor, impresario Paul Gambaccini, Army Chief Ashley Bramhall, Greville Janner and others.

Campbell-Savours strongly supports the introduction of national identity cards.

Having voted for Common Market entry in 1974, Campbell-Savours (who&#x27;d spent much of his childhood living in Milan whilst a boarder at Keswick School), remained an advocate for the European Union until 2016, when he argued that Europe&#x27;s direction of travel paid insufficient regard to the need for stronger border controls, expressing concerns over what he described as the &quot;dark clouds of racial intolerance and extremism sweeping across the continent of Europe&quot;. He argued for a review of Shengen and amendment of EU rules on free movement during periods of volatility in international migratory movements, and that a positive response from Europe and a new EU deal on borders should be followed by a second referendum in which he would vote to remain in the EU.

Campbell-Savours has called for reform of land tenure, arguing that profit-taking on land needed for housing development is not in the public interest, and that there should be a new form of housing tenure to describe housing on land acquired at agricultural prices and then sold on for development for huge profits.

In 2021 Campbell-Savours published a report exposing deficiencies in the operation of local government finance arrangements. He argued that council tax favoured much of the south while penalising large areas of the north with higher charges, quoting a £70,000 council or housing association house in his former Workington constituency which paid the same council tax as a luxury £52 million Mayfair residence in London.

During the covid pandemic Campbell-Savours was advised to stop attending parliament due to his lung condition. Arrangements were made for him to appear on camera in the chamber along with others who were infirm during proceedings, setting a precedent in parliamentary proceedings.

Campbell-Savours was a single voice on the Labour benches opposing the war in Ukraine. He challenged both his party and the government&#x27;s approach, arguing that it was an important part of Russian policy to maintain a string of non-nuclear, non NATO-affiliated barrier states, from the Arctic through Georgia and the Caucuses. He argued, in the context of a residual debate in Russia over its Second World War losses, that Russia was not a military threat unless provoked, and that opposition to the brutal Putin regime should not be allowed to lead to anti Russian sentiment.

Campbell-Savours&#x27; strong support for the state of Israel has been severely tested during the conflict over Gaza. He argues that Palestine should be given full protectorate status under a renewed United Nations mandate, with an administrative power appointed under a process overseen by the permanent members of the United Nation Security Council, perhaps similar to the arrangements under the 1945 Berlin declaration. These ideas have found little support to date.

== Personal life ==
Campbell-Savours married Guðrún Kristín Runólfsdóttir from Reykjavík, Iceland in Reykjavik cathedral in 1970; the couple had three sons. 

His son Markus Campbell-Savours was elected Labour MP for Penrith and Solway in the 2024 general election.

<text>Malcolm George Richardson Chisholm (born 7 March 1949) is a former Scottish politician who served as Minister for Health and Community Care from 2001 to 2004 and Minister for Communities from 2004 to 2006. A member of the Scottish Labour Party, he was Member of Parliament (MP) for Edinburgh North and Leith, formerly Edinburgh Leith, from 1992 to 2001 and Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for the equivalent seat and its successor from 1999 to 2016.

==Career==

Chisholm was Member of Parliament for Edinburgh Leith from 1992, then Edinburgh North and Leith from 1997. He served as a Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland responsible for local government and transport minister for a few months in 1997; but resigned over single parent benefit cuts. He remained an MP until 2001, when he stood down from the House of Commons in order to concentrate on the Scottish Parliament, to which he was elected in 1999 for the same constituency.

Chisholm became Minister for Health and Community Care in 2001, then Minister for Communities from October 2004. As Minister for Health and Community Care, he introduced and oversaw the passage of the National Health Service Reform (Scotland) Bill which brought about the abolition of NHS Trusts in Scotland and the creation of Community Health Partnerships.

As Minister for Communities, Chisholm oversaw investment in the building of affordable homes, approved a proposal from Fife Council for a moratorium on council house sales in order to maintain the supply of affordable housing, developed reforms of planning policy to protect green spaces, and extended the Central Heating Programme and Warm Deal to provide and refurbish heating systems for pensioners.

In December 2006, Chisholm criticised the decision to renew Britain&#x27;s Trident nuclear deterrent, in opposition to First Minister Jack McConnell, leading to speculation that Chisholm might be removed from office. He subsequently resigned on 21 December 2006 after supporting a motion passed by the Scottish National Party that opposed the replacement of the nuclear submarines.

On 17 September 2007, Chisholm was appointed Shadow Minister for Culture and External Affairs by new Scottish Labour leader, Wendy Alexander. In September 2008, Chisholm returned to the backbenches.

In April 2014, Chrisholm announced that he would not seek re-election at the 2016 election.

<doc id="452201" wikidata="Q333397" url="?curid=452201" title="David Clark, Baron Clark of Windermere">
<text>David George Clark, Baron Clark of Windermere PC DL (born 19 October 1939) is a British Labour Party politician, former cabinet minister and author.

==Education and early career==
Clark was born in Castle Douglas, Scotland. He attended Bowness Elementary School and Windermere Grammar School in Cumbria. After leaving school, he worked as a forester and then as a laboratory assistant in a textile mill before becoming a student teacher in 1959.

Clark attended the University of Manchester as a mature student from 1960, gaining a BA in Economics, then later an M.Sc. He was President of the Students&#x27; Union. In 1978, he gained a PhD from the University of Sheffield.

He was a lecturer in Government and Administration at the University of Salford from 1965 to 1970 and a tutor at University of Manchester from 1967 to 1970.

==Parliament==
Clark joined the Labour Party in 1959 and the Co-operative Party two years later. He stood unsuccessfully for Manchester Withington at the 1966 General Election, being defeated by the incumbent Conservative, Sir Robert Cary.

He was first elected as a member of parliament (MP) for Colne Valley which he represented from 1970 to 1974. After losing in the February 1974 general election, he became a senior lecturer in Politics at Huddersfield Polytechnic (now the University of Huddersfield) until 1979 when he returned to the House of Commons as Member of Parliament for South Shields in Tyne and Wear which he held until he stood down at the 2001 general election.

===Shadow cabinet===
Clark was regularly elected to the Shadow Cabinet while the Labour Party was in opposition. He held a number of Shadow portfolios, including Agriculture Fisheries &amp; Food (1972–1974), Defence (1980–81), Food Agricultural and Rural Affairs (1987–1992), and Shadow Defence Secretary (1992–1997). Although he was not a strong supporter of New Labour, he did support Tony Blair&#x27;s bid for the party leadership in 1994.

===Government===
Clark&#x27;s long-standing position as a member of Labour&#x27;s frontbench team meant Blair was obliged to appoint him to the Cabinet when the party was elected to government in May 1997. However, he was not given a senior or middle-ranking position, and instead was given the office of Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, with responsibility for producing a White Paper on Freedom of Information which was published in July 1998 and ultimately led to the Freedom of Information Act 2000.

Clark opposed moves to water down the freedom of information proposals from what had been proposed by Labour in Opposition, and this led to his sacking. At the time, he said that he believed his sacking was also because of his insistence on living in the North-East and &quot;missing out on the London cocktail circuit&quot;. Additionally, Blair&#x27;s sacking of Clark and another &quot;old Labour&quot; figure, Gavin Strang, was part of a plan by Blair to bring two Liberal Democrats into the Cabinet, a plan thwarted by John Prescott and others (though it is highly likely the Liberal Democrats would not have accepted the plan anyway had it become public).

Heavily involved and interested in Bosnia, Clark was forced to apologise for not declaring a 1993 meeting with Radovan Karadžić in the Register of Members&#x27; Interests, as he &quot;thought it had been a United Nations-funded trip&quot;.

===Speaker&#x27;s election===
Two years later, on 23 October 2000, Clark stood for the job of Speaker of the House of Commons in succession to Betty Boothroyd but was unsuccessful (192 votes in favour, 257 against) and his backbench colleague, Michael Martin was elected.

===2001 general election and resignation===
Clark sought reselection by the South Shields Constituency Labour Party to contest the 2001 general election for the seat. However, control of the constituency Party had swung in favour of a vocal group of critics, led by a faction within South Tyneside Council, who feared Clark actually intended to stand down when the General Election was called, thus enabling the Labour Party&#x27;s National Executive Committee to parachute a favoured candidate into the Constituency, historically a safe Labour seat. During the reselection contest Clark vigorously denied the claims and told the &quot;Shields Gazette&quot; newspaper advising he had every intention of contesting the general election. In the event, he won reselection thanks to the support of regional trade union barons.

When Prime Minister Tony Blair announced the date of the general election in 2001, Clark immediately stood down and the Labour Party NEC moved swiftly, New Labour rising star David Miliband was selected to fight the seat. Miliband, an Oxford graduate from London, was seen locally as a parachute candidate.

Within weeks of the Labour Party winning the 2001 general election, Clark was created a life peer on 2 July 2001 as Baron Clark of Windermere, &quot;of Windermere in the County of Cumbria&quot; and now sits in the House of Lords. He was also appointed to the paid post of chairman of the Forestry Commission.

===House of Lords===
Clark&#x27;s ongoing political interests include Bosnia, open spaces, hunting and bloodsports (to which he is opposed), defence and the environment.

He was awarded Freedom of the Borough of South Tyneside in February 1999, and is a long-standing fan of Carlisle United Football Club, of which he is a director. He served as a deputy lieutenant of Cumbria from 2007 to 2014. Clark was chair of the Atlantic Council of the UK (1998–2003), and has been Leader of the North Atlantic Assembly since 2001, having been a member since 1980. He was a member of the executive of the National Trust from 1980 until 1994. He was chair of the Forestry Commission from 2004 to 2009; a non-executive director of the Homeowners Friendly Society, the Thales Group, and the UK Friendly Insurance Services. He is a trustee of the Vindolanda Trust, the History of Parliament Trust, and the Gravetye Trust, and a patron of the UK Defence Forum. He chairs the Lake District National Park Partnership.

==Personal life==
He married Christine Kirkby, in 1970 and they have one daughter and one son, Catherine and Thomas. He lives in Windermere, and lists his recreations as gardening, fell walking, reading, and watching football. He is a director of Carlisle United Football Club.

==Honours==
* He was sworn in as a member of the Privy Council of the United Kingdom in 1997, giving him the honorific title &quot;The Right Honourable&quot; and after ennoblement the Post Nominal Letters &quot;PC&quot; for life.
* He was awarded the Freedom of the Town of South Shields in 1999.
* He was made a baron in the Peerage of the United Kingdom in 2001 by Prime Minister Tony Blair, allowing him a seat in the House of Lords where he sits with the Labour Party. 
* He took the title Baron Clark of Windermere.
* He served as a deputy lieutenant of the County of Cumbria from 2007 to 2014. This allowed him the post nominal letters &quot;DL&quot; for life.
* He was awarded an honorary fellowship in November 2009 of the University of Cumbria.

<doc id="452211" wikidata="Q1513195" url="?curid=452211" title="M. Butterfly (film)">
<text>M. Butterfly is a 1993 American romantic drama film directed by David Cronenberg and written by David Henry Hwang based on his 1988 play. The film stars Jeremy Irons and John Lone, with Ian Richardson, Barbara Sukowa, and Annabel Leventon. The story is loosely based on true events which involved French diplomat Bernard Boursicot and Chinese opera singer Shi Pei Pu.

==Plot==
René Gallimard is a French diplomat assigned to Beijing, China in the 1960s. He becomes infatuated with a Peking opera performer, Song Liling, who spies on him for the government of the People&#x27;s Republic of China. Their affair lasts for 20 years, and they subsequently marry, with Gallimard all the while apparently unaware, or willfully ignorant, of the fact that in Peking opera &quot;Dan&quot; roles were traditionally performed by men.

==Cast==
* Jeremy Irons as René Gallimard
* John Lone as Song Liling
* Ian Richardson as Ambassador Toulon
* Barbara Sukowa as Jeanne Gallimard
* Annabel Leventon as Frau Baden
* Shizuko Hoshi as Comrade Chin
* Vernon Dobtcheff as Agent Entacelin

==Production==
David Henry Hwang&#x27;s play &quot;M. Butterfly&quot;, based on the relationship between Bernard Boursicot and Shi Pei Pu, opened on Broadway in 1988, and was critically and financially successful. David Geffen, the play&#x27;s producer, retained the film rights through his company. He worked with Warner Bros. on the film and it was given a budget of $17–18 million.

Cronenberg stated that &quot;Ironically, if there was ever a film of mine that you could call a sellout, it was &quot;M. Butterfly&quot;&quot;. He read the film script written by Hwang before seeing his for the first time. Geffen initially wanted Peter Weir to direct the film, but Weir declined. It was the most expensive film directed by Cronenberg until &quot;A History of Violence&quot;.

Cronenberg had parts of the script, such as Americans in Vietnam and bombing scenes, removed as he was not interested in it. The first draft of the script featured Gallimard watching the &quot;Madama Butterfly&quot; opera with his mother as a child. The ending scene between Gallimard and Liling in the police van was created by Cronenberg as he &quot;just knew that it wouldn&#x27;t play in prison the way it was in the play&quot; as he felt Liling being allowed in Gallimard&#x27;s cell and stripping would be unbelievable.

Cronenberg auditioned over sixty men for the role of Liling before selecting John Lone. The costume design was done by Cronenberg&#x27;s sister Denise 5,979 costumes were used in the film. Hairstyling was done by Aldo Signoretti. Randy Balsmeyer and Mimi Everett designed the title sequence, which features CGI created using Softimage 3D, and purchased around $30,000 worth of antique kimonos for it. It was their first title sequence to be fully computer generated.

The film was mostly filmed in Toronto and was also shot in Beijing, Budapest, and Paris from August to December 1992. It was Cronenberg&#x27;s first film to be shot outside of Canada. Geffen and Warner Bros. were impressed by the first trailer and the grand scale despite its small budget according to Cronenberg as &quot;for 17 million dollars we got a fucking 50 million dollar epic&quot;. Cronenberg was unable to accept the Genie Awards he won for &quot;Naked Lunch&quot; in person as he was filming in Hungary.

==Release==
&quot;M. Butterfly&quot; premiered as the gala opening film at the 1993 Toronto International Film Festival on September 9, 1993. Cronenberg was the first director to have two of their films shown as the festival&#x27;s opening film, with &quot;Dead Ringers&quot; opening the festival in 1988. It was released on LaserDisc on March 30, 1994.

The film was a commercial failure and grossed $1,498,795 in the domestic box office. It earned $57,280 in its domestic opening weekend. Cronenberg stated that he was disappointed by the film&#x27;s reception and felt that it was overshadowed by &quot;The Crying Game&quot;. He said that the films paralleled each other as both were transsexual, transracial, and transcultural.

==Reception==
On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 39%, based on 23 reviews, and an average rating of 5.60/10. The website&#x27;s critics consensus reads: &quot;David Cronenberg reins in his provocative sensibility and handles delicate material with restraint, yielding a disappointing adaptation that flattens &quot;M. Butterfly&quot; into a tedious soap opera.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 43 out of 100, based on 19 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;.

Marshall Fine gave the film two stars wrote that &quot;it&#x27;s hard to know where Hwang and Cronenberg went wrong in translating this film from stage to screen&quot; and &quot;it lacks the power, the ambition and the drama of the play&quot;. Craig MacInnis, writing in the &quot;Toronto Star&quot;, wrote that &quot;Against all odds, &quot;M. Butterfly&quot; is a boring film&quot;, Robert Feldberg, writing in &quot;The Record&quot;, wrote that it was &quot;remarkably boring&quot; in his 1½ star review, and Kenneth Turan, in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, wrote that the &quot;Dazzling and multicolored&quot; play was &quot;turned into a drab moth of a film&quot;. Gene Siskel gave the film 2½ stars stating that it was a &quot;disappointing treatment of the hit play&quot; and that it failed &quot;because it is impossible to believe that Irons&#x27; character can&#x27;t figure out that this womanly figure is really a man&quot;.

Jami Bernard praised Irons and Lone&#x27;s acting in her 3½ star review. Eleanor O&#x27;Sullivan, writing a 2½ star review in &quot;Asbury Park Press&quot;, criticized Irons as being miscast and that Gallimard should have had a previous gay relationship as it would have &quot;given real force to his resolution to believe the man he loves is a woman&quot;. Rene Rodriguez, writing in the &quot;Miami Herald&quot;, also criticized the performances in his two star review stating that Irons &quot;doesn&#x27;t seem to be all here&quot; compared to his &quot;terrific dual performance&quot; in &quot;Dead Ringers&quot; and Lone was not believable as a woman.

Noel Taylor, writing in the &quot;Ottawa Citizen&quot;, gave the film four stars. Jay Boyar wrote that there was &quot;not a single unearned tear in this &quot;M. Butterfly&quot;&quot; in his four star review in the &quot;Orlando Sentinel&quot;. Roger Ebert gave the film 2½ stars and a thumbs up, but criticized that it &quot;does not take hold the way the stage play did&quot; and the two ending scenes &quot;fly so recklessly in the face of plausibility that we&#x27;re distracted&quot;.

<doc id="452214" wikidata="Q6039211" url="?curid=452214" title="Institute for Christian Studies">
<text>The Institute for Christian Studies (ICS or ICS Toronto) is a private, graduate-level Reformed philosophical and theological school in Toronto, Ontario. At ICS, students and faculty take part in shared learning through participatory seminars, mentoring, and an interdisciplinary approach to study. There are several unrelated institutions bearing similar names.

==Associations==
ICS is affiliated with the Vrije Universiteit (VU or Free University). The Vrije Universiteit has co-sponsored and co-supervised some ICS doctoral degrees. The Institute is also an affiliated institution to the Toronto School of Theology at the University of Toronto. The Toronto School of Theology allows students to take a certain number of credits towards their degree from external institutions, including ICS. ICS students may also take some of their course work at the University of Toronto Department of Philosophy. In 2025, the ICS Board of Trustees voted to end its denominational affiliation with the Christian Reformed Church in North America, as a result of the church&#x27;s move to make disapproval of same-sex partnerships a binding confessional stance.

===Other affiliations===
The Institute for Christian Studies is part of a worldwide movement for Christian higher education, where a primary task is often the fostering of teachers for the elementary and secondary levels. In this regard, ICS offers K-12 teachers an Educational Leadership emphasis in its Master of Arts in Philosophy degree program, and prepares Master of Arts in Philosophy and PhD-level graduates to teach across disciplines in colleges and universities, or to enter into a more activist profession. With its unique emphasis among English-based Christian programs of advanced studies, ICS is also a dedicated affiliate of the International Network for Christian Higher Education (INCHE) formerly called the International Association for Promotion of Christian Higher Education (IAPCHE). INCHE is a worldwide network that advances Christian higher education through professional development, scholarship, capacity building, and communication. The network seeks to reflect both the shared view that Christ is central to those efforts and the local realities.

==Faith &amp; Learning Network, ICS&#x27;s online worldwide service==
As part of its services to its broad circle of affiliated institutions and interested individuals, ICS maintains the Faith &amp; Learning Network (FLN) developed over several years. Principally, FLN is a bibliographic resource that can be accessed directly from the ICS website. Its purpose is to disseminate information on the results of Christian research publications, and popularizations, to various learning levels that resonate with the vision of ICS, INCHE, and related worldwide organizations and movements.

==History==
ICS is accredited by the Ontario government. The original model for ICS was the Central Interfaculty of the Free University (Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam), an interdisciplinary philosophy department in which the foundations of the special disciplines were to be investigated. The founders of ICS were convinced that a Christian graduate school was vital to generating comprehensively informed perspectives by biblical revelation. Henk Hart was ICS&#x27;s inaugural professor with the opening of the school in 1967. In 1972, ICS moved to its current location on College Street in Toronto, and had added several faculty and had begun granting master&#x27;s-level certification in philosophy. In 1980, ICS began to develop a doctoral programme in co-operation with the Free University of Amsterdam.

In 1983, ICS (then, the Association for the Advancement of Christian Scholarship, or AACS) received Royal Assent to a Charter from the Legislative Assembly of Ontario allowing ICS to grant a Master of Philosophical Foundations, and to offer a program of doctoral studies leading to a PhD conferred by the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. The AACS then ceased to exist and allowed the ICS to develop. In 1992, ICS was authorized to grant a Master of Worldview Studies degree, a one-year program in large part to accommodate non-philosophers teaching in Christian elementary and secondary schools. In December 2004, ICS was given ministerial permission to grant PhD and MA in Philosophy degrees on its own standing before the Crown, without a necessary mediation through the Free University Amsterdam – a process which culminated in receiving Royal Assent to grant these degrees from the Legislative Assembly of Ontario in June 2005. The strong bond between ICS and the VU, and inter-academic affiliation and cooperation, continues.

===Background, founding and early faculty===
More than ten years before, a lay movement was initiated amongst Dutch immigrants in Canada to promote academic studies from a Reformational Christian perspective. As a result of that movement, the Association for Reformed Scientific Studies (ARSS) was launched in 1956 in Toronto, Ontario, by a number of pastors, including Paul Schrotenboer, who emerged as key figures in close contact with H. Evan Runner, a professor of philosophy at Calvin College, Grand Rapids, Michigan. Runner had graduated from Westminster Theological Seminary, Philadelphia, and then during studies at Harvard University had served as an assistant to Werner Jaeger, a leading classicist there. Runner then went to the Free University to study philosophy under D. H. Th. Vollenhoven, as would many of the early faculty members of ICS from its inception. In 1958 the philosopher Herman Dooyeweerd visited America and suggested to the ARSS – which later became the Association for the Advancement of Christian Scholarship (AACS) – that they write an educational creed. The creed appeared several years later and was drafted by D. H. Th. Vollenhoven, during his subsequent visit and conferencing with Runner, Schrotenboer, and others. The prevailing idea was to lay the groundwork for an independent Protestant Christian university modelled after the VU (Free University of Amsterdam), not under the governance of the state or any church.

In 1967 the ARSS became the AACS which soon established the Institute. The first professor, called a Senior Member, appointed to serve the new Institute was Hendrik Hart who proceeded to teach worldview studies and philosophy, an appointment which later became specialized to Systematic Philosophy as the number of Senior Members grew. The student body also began to grow in numbers. A second Senior Member, James Olthuis who had graduated from Calvin Theological Seminary and received his doctorate from André Troost in philosophical ethics, received an appointment in ethics and philosophical theology. Then, in short order, because of a dispute at another institution in the United States, individuals in what may be called &quot;the Chicago School&quot; of thought within Reformational philosophy became available for ICS appointments: Calvin Seerveld in philosophical aesthetics, Arnold DeGraaff in psychology and education, and Thomas McIntire in history. What marked this entire contingent was the strong emphasis on pursuing philosophy and the philosophical foundations of other disciplines, with intense historical depth.

Upon completion of his dissertation under Herman Dooyeweerd, professor of jurisprudence at VU Amsterdam, Bernard Zylstra took up an appointment at ICS as Senior Member in political philosophy. Zylstra had been a student of Runner&#x27;s as an undergraduate at Calvin College, had received his theological degree at Calvin Theological Seminary, his Master&#x27;s in Law at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, and was the only faculty member to have studied directly under Dooyeweerd at VU Amsterdam. He had a strong influence on numerous students who are teaching in political science departments today. Many other ICS Senior Members were also students of Runner and had completed doctorates at VU. The exception among early faculty was McIntire who was writing his dissertation for the University of Pennsylvania at the time of his ICS appointment. He received it a few years later.

At some point, ICS&#x27;s affiliation with VU required that a full-time Senior Member in History of Philosophy be added to the faculty, so that candidates for the PhD program in philosophy sponsored by VU could meet VU&#x27;s own internal requirements regarding the credit hours in discipline of history of philosophy, a trademark of VU&#x27;s philosophy faculty since its establishment under Vollenhoven. ICS was quite amenable to this arrangement. Runner, Hart, and Seerveld had all studied history of philosophy directly under Vollenhoven. A fourth Senior Member &quot;promoted&quot; by Vollenhoven, Albert M. Wolters, received the first ICS appointment as Senior Member in history of philosophy.

The current ICS faculty includes: Nicholas John Ansell (Theology), Ronald A. Kuipers (Philosophy of Religion), Rebekah Smick (Philosophy of Arts and Culture), Gideon Strauss (Leadership and Worldview Studies), Robert Sweetman (History of Philosophy), and Edith van der Boom (Philosophy of Education and Practice of Pedagogy). Emeritus faculty include: Doug Blomberg (Philosophy of Education), James Olthuis (Philosophical Theology), Calvin Seerveld (Philosophical Aesthetics), and Lambert Zuidervaart (Philosophy).

ICS Presidents have included: Bernard Zylstra (1978–1985), Clifford Pitt (1985–1989), Harry Fernhout (1989–2005), John Suk (2006–2008), Chris Gort (2010–2012), Tom Wolthuis and Dawn Wolthuis (2013–2014), Doug Blomberg (2014–2017), and Ronald A. Kuipers (2018–present).

<doc id="452218" wikidata="Q779603" url="?curid=452218" title="Market Rasen">
<text>Market Rasen ( ) is a market town and civil parish within the West Lindsey district of Lincolnshire, England. The River Rase runs through it east to west, approximately north-east from Lincoln, east from Gainsborough, west of Louth, and south-west from Grimsby. It lies on the main road between Lincoln and Grimsby, the A46, and is famous for its racecourse. In 2001, the town had a population of 3,200. In the 2011 census, the population of the civil parish was 3,904.

==History==
The place-name &#x27;Market Rasen&#x27; is first attested in the Domesday Book of 1086, where it appears as &quot;Rase&quot;, &quot;Rasa&quot;, and &quot;Resne&quot;. The name derives from the Old English &quot;ræsn&quot; meaning &#x27;plank&#x27;, and is thought to refer to a plank bridge. The river name &#x27;Rase&#x27; is a back-formation.

Originally &quot;Rasen&quot;, as it is known locally, was called &quot;East Rasen&quot;, &quot;Rasen Parva&quot; or &quot;Little Rasen&quot;.
In the 19th century, touring theatrical companies performed in theatres in the town. David Grose opened &#x27;a very neat and comfortable theatre&#x27; in 1834. In May 1844, the Giffords performed in the town.

The Corn Exchange was designed by Henry Goddard and completed in 1854.

Market Rasen&#x27;s community fire and police station opened in December 2005.
Market Rasen is served by a railway station which opened in 1848. 

==Geography==
The River Rase flows through the town and crosses Waterloo Street at Crane Bridge.

In 2011, it was one of the towns chosen for the Portas Review of small-town retailing businesses.

==Education==
Market Rasen&#x27;s secondary school is De Aston School, a co-educational 11–18 former comprehensive school now an academy member with approximately 1,300 pupils, including day pupils and formerly boarders. It was founded in 1863 as a small grammar school as part of a legal settlement following a court case involving funds from the medieval charity of Thomas de Aston, a 13th-century monk.

The main primary school is the Market Rasen Church of England Primary School.

==February 2008 earthquake==
On 27 February 2008, a significant earthquake had its epicentre approximately north-west of Market Rasen, near the neighbouring parish of Middle Rasen. The earthquake, which according to the British Geological Survey measured 5.2 on the Richter Scale, struck at a depth of and was felt across much of the UK from Edinburgh to Plymouth, and as far away as Bangor in Northern Ireland and Haarlem in the Netherlands.
The 10-second quake was the largest recorded example in the United Kingdom since the 1984 Llŷn Peninsula earthquake struck North Wales, measuring 5.4.
There were no recorded local injuries and only one recorded injury elsewhere in the UK, in South Yorkshire, when a chimney was dislodged from a house roof, falling down through the house&#x27;s roof and landing on the male resident, who was in bed at the time, causing a broken pelvis.

==Local media==
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC Yorkshire and Lincolnshire and ITV Yorkshire. Television signals are received from the nearby Belmont TV transmitter. 

The town newspaper is the weekly &quot;Market Rasen Mail&quot;, which was founded in 1856.

Local radio stations are BBC Radio Lincolnshire on 94.9 FM, Greatest Hits Radio Lincolnshire on 102.2 FM, DAB radio station, Hits Radio Lincolnshire and County Linx Radio, a community online station.

<text>A drill bit is a cutting tool used in a drill to remove material to create holes, almost always of circular cross-section. Drill bits come in many sizes and shapes and can create different kinds of holes in many different materials. In order to create holes drill bits are usually attached to a drill, which powers them to cut through the workpiece, typically by rotation. The drill will grasp the upper end of a bit called the &quot;shank&quot; in the chuck.

Drills come in standardized drill bit sizes. A comprehensive drill bit and tap size chart lists metric and imperial sized drills alongside the required screw tap sizes. There are also certain specialized drill bits that can create holes with a non-circular cross-section.

==Characteristics==
Drill geometry has several characteristics:
* The spiral (or rate of twist) in the drill bit controls the rate of chip removal. A fast spiral (high twist rate or &quot;compact flute&quot;) drill bit is used in high feed rate applications under low spindle speeds, where removal of a large volume of chips is required. Low spiral (low twist rate or &quot;elongated flute&quot;) drill bits are used in cutting applications where high cutting speeds are traditionally used, and where the material has a tendency to gall on the bit or otherwise clog the hole, such as aluminum or copper.
* The point angle, or the angle formed at the tip of the bit, is determined by the material the bit will be operating in. Harder materials require a larger point angle, and softer materials require a sharper angle. The correct point angle for the hardness of the material influences wandering, chatter, hole shape, and wear rate.
* The lip angle is the angle between the face of the cut material and the flank of the lip, and determines the amount of support provided to the cutting edge. A greater lip angle will cause the bit to cut more aggressively under the same amount of point pressure as a bit with a smaller lip angle. Both conditions can cause binding, wear, and eventual catastrophic failure of the tool. The proper amount of lip clearance is determined by the point angle. A very acute point angle has more web surface area presented to the work at any one time, requiring an aggressive lip angle, where a flat bit is extremely sensitive to small changes in lip angle due to the small surface area supporting the cutting edges.
* The functional length of a bit determines how deep a hole can be drilled, and also determines the stiffness of the bit and accuracy of the resultant hole. While longer bits can drill deeper holes, they are more flexible meaning that the holes they drill may have an inaccurate location or wander from the intended axis. Twist drill bits are available in standard lengths, referred to as Stub-length or Screw-Machine-length (short), the extremely common Jobber-length (medium), and Taper-length or Long-Series (long).

Most drill bits for consumer use have straight shanks. For heavy duty drilling in industry, bits with tapered shanks are sometimes used. Other types of shank used include hex-shaped, and various proprietary quick release systems.

The diameter-to-length ratio of the drill bit is usually between 1:1 and 1:10. Much higher ratios are possible (e.g., &quot;aircraft-length&quot; twist bits, pressured-oil gun drill bits, etc.), but the higher the ratio, the greater the technical challenge of producing good work.

The best geometry to use depends upon the properties of the material being drilled. The following table lists geometries recommended for some commonly drilled materials.

===Materials===
Many different materials are used for or on drill bits, depending on the required application. Many hard materials, such as carbides, are much more brittle than steel, and are far more subject to breaking, particularly if the drill is not held at a very constant angle to the workpiece; e.g., when hand-held.

====Steels====
* Soft low-carbon steel bits are inexpensive, but do not hold an edge well and require frequent sharpening. They are used only for drilling wood; even working with hardwoods rather than softwoods can noticeably shorten their lifespan.
* Bits made from high-carbon steel are more durable than low-carbon steel bits due to the properties conferred by hardening and tempering the material. If they are overheated (e.g., by frictional heating while drilling) they lose their temper, resulting in a soft cutting edge. These bits can be used on wood or metal.
* High-speed steel (HSS) is a form of tool steel; HSS bits are hard and much more resistant to heat than high-carbon steel. They can be used to drill metal, hardwood, and most other materials at greater cutting speeds than carbon-steel bits, and have largely replaced carbon steels.
* Cobalt steel alloys are variations on high-speed steel that contain more cobalt. They hold their hardness at much higher temperatures and are used to drill stainless steel and other hard materials. The main disadvantage of cobalt steels is that they are more brittle than standard HSS.

====Others====
* Tungsten carbide and other carbides are extremely hard and can drill virtually all materials, while holding an edge longer than other bits. The material is expensive and much more brittle than steels; consequently they are mainly used for drill-bit tips, small pieces of hard material fixed or brazed onto the tip of a bit made of less hard metal. However, it is becoming common in job shops to use solid carbide bits. In very small sizes it is difficult to fit carbide tips; in some industries, most notably printed circuit board manufacturing, requiring many holes with diameters less than 1 mm, solid carbide bits are used.
* Polycrystalline diamond (PCD) is among the hardest of all tool materials and is therefore extremely resistant to wear. It consists of a layer of diamond particles, typically about thick, bonded as a sintered mass to a tungsten-carbide support. Bits are fabricated using this material by either brazing small segments to the tip of the tool to form the cutting edges or by sintering PCD into a vein in the tungsten-carbide &quot;nib&quot;. The nib can later be brazed to a carbide shaft; it can then be ground to complex geometries that would otherwise cause braze failure in the smaller &quot;segments&quot;. PCD bits are typically used in the automotive, aerospace, and other industries to drill abrasive aluminum alloys, carbon-fiber reinforced plastics, and other abrasive materials, and in applications where machine downtime to replace or sharpen worn bits is exceptionally costly. PCD is not used on ferrous metals due to excess wear resulting from a reaction between the carbon in the PCD and the iron in the metal.

===Coatings===

* Black oxide is an inexpensive black coating. A black oxide coating provides heat resistance and lubricity, as well as corrosion resistance. The coating increases the life of high-speed steel bits.
* Titanium nitride (TiN) is a very hard metallic material that can be used to coat a high-speed steel bit (usually a twist bit), extending the cutting life by three or more times. Even after sharpening, the leading edge of coating still provides improved cutting and lifetime.
* Titanium aluminum nitride (TiAlN) is a similar coating that can extend tool life five or more times.
* Titanium carbon nitride (TiCN) is another coating also superior to TiN.
* Diamond powder is used as an abrasive, most often for cutting tile, stone, and other very hard materials. Large amounts of heat are generated by friction, and diamond-coated bits often have to be water-cooled to prevent damage to the bit or the workpiece.
* Zirconium nitride has been used as a drill-bit coating for some tools under the Craftsman brand name.
* Al-Chrome Silicon Nitride (AlCrSi/Ti)N is a multilayer coating made of alternating nanolayer, developed using chemical vapor deposition technique, is used in drilling carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) and CFRP-Ti stack. (AlCrSi/Ti)N is a superhard ceramic coating, which performs better than other coated and uncoated drill.
* BAM coating is Boron-Aluminum-Magnesium BAlMgB14 is a superhard ceramic coating also used in composite drilling.

==Universal bits==
General-purpose drill bits can be used in wood, metal, plastic, and most other materials.

===Twist drill bit=== 
The twist drill bit is the type produced in largest quantity today. It comprises a cutting point at the tip of a cylindrical shaft with helical flutes; the flutes act as an Archimedean screw and lift swarf out of the hole.

The modern-style twist drill bit was invented by Sir Joseph Whitworth in 1860. They were later improved by Steven A. Morse of East Bridgewater, Massachusetts, who experimented with the pitch of the twist. The original method of manufacture was to cut two grooves in opposite sides of a round bar, then to twist the bar (giving the tool its name) to produce the helical flutes. Nowadays, the drill bit is usually made by rotating the bar while moving it past a grinding wheel to cut the flutes in the same manner as cutting helical gears.

Twist drill bits range in diameter from and can be as long as .

The geometry and sharpening of the cutting edges is crucial to the performance of the bit. Small bits that become blunt are often discarded because sharpening them correctly is difficult and they are cheap to replace. For larger bits, special grinding jigs are available. A special tool grinder is available for sharpening or reshaping cutting surfaces on twist drill bits in order to optimize the bit for a particular material.

Manufacturers can produce special versions of the twist drill bit, varying the geometry and the materials used, to suit particular machinery and particular materials to be cut. Twist drill bits are available in the widest choice of tooling materials. However, even for industrial users, most holes are drilled with standard high-speed steel bits.

The most common twist drill bit (sold in general hardware stores) has a point angle of 118 degrees, acceptable for use in wood, metal, plastic, and most other materials, although it does not perform as well as using the optimum angle for each material. In most materials it does not tend to wander or dig in.

A more aggressive angle, such as 90 degrees, is suited for very soft plastics and other materials; it would wear rapidly in hard materials. Such a bit is generally self-starting and can cut very quickly. A shallower angle, such as 150 degrees, is suited for drilling steels and other tougher materials. This style of bit requires a starter hole, but does not bind or suffer premature wear so long as a suitable feed rate is used.

Drill bits with no point angle are used in situations where a blind, flat-bottomed hole is required. These bits are very sensitive to changes in lip angle, and even a slight change can result in an inappropriately fast cutting drill bit that will suffer premature wear.

&quot;Long series&quot; drill bits are unusually long twist drill bits. However, they are not the best tool for routinely drilling deep holes, as they require frequent withdrawal to clear the flutes of swarf and to prevent breakage of the bit. Instead, gun drill (through coolant drill) bits are preferred for deep hole drilling.

===Step drill bit=== 
A step drill bit is a drill bit that has the tip ground down to a different diameter. The transition between this ground diameter and the original diameter is either straight, to form a counterbore, or angled, to form a countersink. The advantage to this style is that both diameters have the same flute characteristics, which keeps the bit from clogging when drilling in softer materials, such as aluminum; in contrast, a drill bit with a slip-on collar does not have the same benefit. Most of these bits are custom-made for each application, which makes them more expensive.

===Unibit===
A unibit (often called a step drill bit) is a roughly conical bit with a stairstep profile. Due to its design, a single bit can be used for drilling a wide range of hole sizes. Some bits come to a point and are thus self-starting. The larger-size bits have blunt tips and are used for hole enlarging.

Unibits are commonly used on sheet metal and in general construction. One drill bit can drill the entire range of holes necessary on a countertop, speeding up installation of fixtures. They are often used on softer materials, such as plywood, particle board, drywall, acrylic, and laminate. They can be used on very thin sheet metal, but metals tend to cause premature bit wear and dulling.

Unibits are ideal for use in electrical work where thin steel, aluminum or plastic boxes and chassis are encountered. The short length of the unibit and ability to vary the diameter of the finished hole is an advantage in chassis or front panel work. The finished hole can often be made quite smooth and burr-free, especially in plastic.

An additional use of unibits is deburring holes left by other bits, as the sharp increase to the next step size allows the cutting edge to scrape burrs off the entry surface of the workpiece. However, the straight flute is poor at chip ejection, and can cause a burr to be formed on the exit side of the hole, more so than a spiral twist drill bit turning at high speed.

The unibit was invented by Harry C. Oakes and patented in 1973. It was sold only by the Unibit Corporation in the 1980s until the patent expired, and was later sold by other companies. Unibit is a trademark of Irwin Industrial Tools.

Although it is claimed that the stepped drill was invented by Harry C. Oakes it was in fact conceived by George Godbold and first produced by Bradley Engineering, Wandsworth, London in the 1960s and named the Bradrad. It was marketed under this name until the patent was sold to Halls Ltd.uk by whom it is still produced.

===Hole saw===
Hole saws take the form of a short open cylinder with saw-teeth on the open edge, used for making relatively large holes in thin material. They remove material only from the edge of the hole, cutting out an intact disc of material, unlike many drills which remove all material in the interior of the hole. They can be used to make large holes in wood, sheet metal and other materials.

==For metal==

===Center and spotting drill bit=== 
Center drill bits, occasionally known as Slocombe drill bits, are used in metalworking to provide a starting hole for a larger-sized drill bit or to make a conical indentation in the end of a workpiece in which to mount a lathe center. In either use, the name seems appropriate, as the bit is either establishing the &quot;center&quot; of a hole or making a conical hole for a lathe &quot;center&quot;. However, the true purpose of a center drill bit is the latter task, while the former task is best done with a &quot;spotting drill bit&quot; (as explained in detail below). Nevertheless, because of the frequent lumping together of both the terminology and the tool use, suppliers may call center drill bits &quot;combined-drill-and-countersinks&quot; in order to make it unambiguously clear what product is being ordered. They are numbered from 00 to 10 (smallest to largest).

====Use in making holes for lathe centers====
Center drill bits are meant to create a conical hole for &quot;between centers&quot; manufacturing processes (typically lathe or cylindrical-grinder work). That is, they provide a location for a (live, dead, or driven) center to locate the part about an axis. A workpiece machined between centers can be safely removed from one process (perhaps turning in a lathe) and set up in a later process (perhaps a grinding operation) with a negligible loss in the co-axiality of features (usually total indicator reading (TIR) less than ; and TIR &lt; is held in cylindrical grinding operations, as long as conditions are correct).

====Use in spotting hole centers====
Traditional twist drill bits may tend to wander when started on an unprepared surface. Once a bit wanders off course it is difficult to bring it back on center. A center drill bit frequently provides a reasonable starting point as it is short and therefore has a reduced tendency to wander when drilling is started.

While the above is a common use of center drill bits, it is a technically incorrect practice and should not be considered for production use. The correct tool to start a traditionally drilled hole (a hole drilled by a high-speed steel (HSS) twist drill bit) is a &quot;spotting drill bit&quot; (or a &quot;spot drill bit&quot;, as they are referenced in the U.S.). The included angle of the spotting drill bit should be the same as, or greater than, the conventional drill bit so that the drill bit will then start without undue stress on the bit&#x27;s corners, which would cause premature failure of the bit and a loss of hole quality.

Most modern solid-carbide bits should not be used in conjunction with a spot drill bit or a center drill bit, as solid-carbide bits are specifically designed to start their own hole. Usually, spot drilling will cause premature failure of the solid-carbide bit and a certain loss of hole quality. If it is deemed necessary to chamfer a hole with a spot or center drill bit when a solid-carbide drill bit is used, it is best practice to do so after the hole is drilled.

When drilling with a hand-held drill the flexibility of the bit is not the primary source of inaccuracy—it is the user&#x27;s hands. Therefore, for such operations, a center punch is often used to spot the hole center prior to drilling a pilot hole.

===Core drill bit===

The term core drill bit is used for two quite different tools.

====Enlarging holes====
A bit used to enlarge an existing hole is called a core drill bit. The existing hole may be the result of a core from a casting or a stamped (punched) hole. The name comes from its first use, for drilling out the hole left by a &quot;foundry core&quot;, a cylinder placed in a mould for a casting that leaves an irregular hole in the product. This core drill bit is solid.

These core drill bits are similar in appearance to reamers as they have no cutting point or means of starting a hole. They have 3 or 4 flutes which enhances the finish of the hole and ensures the bit cuts evenly. Core drill bits differ from reamers in the amount of material they are intended to remove. A reamer is only intended to enlarge a hole a slight amount which, depending on the reamers size, may be anything from 0.1 millimeter to perhaps a millimeter. A core drill bit may be used to double the size of a hole.

Using an ordinary two-flute twist drill bit to enlarge the hole resulting from a casting core will not produce a clean result, the result will possibly be out of round, off center and generally of poor finish. The two fluted drill bit also has a tendency to grab on any protuberance (such as flash) which may occur in the product.

====Extracting core====

A hollow cylindrical bit which will cut a hole with an annular cross-section and leave the inner cylinder of material (the &quot;core&quot;) intact, often removing it, is also called a core drill bit or annular cutter. Unlike other drills, the purpose is often to retrieve the core rather than simply to make a hole. A diamond core drill bit is intended to cut an annular hole in the workpiece. Large bits of similar shape are used for geological work, where a deep hole is drilled in sediment or ice and the drill bit, which now contains an intact core of the material drilled with a diameter of several centimeters, is retrieved to allow study of the strata.

===Countersink bit===

A countersink is a conical hole cut into a manufactured object; a countersink bit (sometimes called simply countersink) is the cutter used to cut such a hole. A common use is to allow the head of a bolt or screw, with a shape exactly matching the countersunk hole, to sit flush with or below the surface of the surrounding material. (By comparison, a counterbore makes a flat-bottomed hole that might be used with a hex-headed capscrew.) A countersink may also be used to remove the burr left from a drilling or tapping operation.

===Ejector drill bit===
Used almost exclusively for deep hole drilling of medium to large diameter holes (approximately diameter). An ejector drill bit uses a specially designed carbide cutter at the point. The bit body is essentially a tube within a tube. Flushing water travels down between the two tubes. Chip removal is back through the center of the bit.

===Gun drill bit===

Gun drills are straight fluted drills which allow cutting fluid (either compressed air or a suitable liquid) to be injected through the drill&#x27;s hollow body to the cutting face.

===Indexable drill bit===
Indexable drill bits are primarily used in CNC and other high precision or production equipment, and are the most expensive type of drill bit, costing the most per diameter and length. Like indexable lathe tools and milling cutters, they use replaceable carbide or ceramic inserts as a cutting face to alleviate the need for a tool grinder. One insert is responsible for the outer radius of the cut, and another insert is responsible for the inner radius. The tool itself handles the point deformity, as it is a low-wear task. The bit is hardened and coated against wear far more than the average drill bit, as the shank is non-consumable. Almost all indexable drill bits have multiple coolant channels for prolonged tool life under heavy usage. They are also readily available in odd configurations, such as straight flute, fast spiral, multiflute, and a variety of cutting face geometries.

Typically indexable drill bits are used in holes that are no deeper than about 5 times the bit diameter. They are capable of quite high axial loads and cut very fast.

===Left-hand bit===
Left-hand bits are almost always twist bits and are predominantly used in the repetition engineering industry on screw machines or drilling heads. Left-handed drill bits allow a machining operation to continue where either the spindle cannot be reversed or the design of the machine makes it more efficient to run left-handed. With the increased use of the more versatile CNC machines, their use is less common than when specialized machines were required for machining tasks.

Screw extractors are essentially left-hand bits of specialized shape, used to remove common right-hand screws whose heads are broken or too damaged to allow a screwdriver tip to engage, making use of a screwdriver impossible. The extractor is pressed against the damaged head and rotated counter-clockwise and will tend to jam in the damaged head and then turn the screw counter-clockwise, unscrewing it. For screws that break off deeper in the hole, an extractor set will often include left handed drill bits of the appropriate diameters so that grab holes can be drilled into the screws in a left handed direction, preventing further tightening of the broken piece.

===Metal spade bit===
A spade drill bit for metal is a two part bit with a tool holder and an insertable tip, called an insert. The inserts come in various sizes that range from . The tool holder usually has a coolant passage running through it. They are capable of cutting to a depth of about 10 times the bit diameter. This type of drill bit can also be used to make stepped holes.

===Straight fluted bit===
Straight fluted drill bits do not have a helical twist like twist drill bits do. They are used when drilling copper or brass because they have less of a tendency to &quot;dig in&quot; or grab the material.

===Trepan===
A trepan, sometimes called a BTA drill bit (after the Boring and Trepanning Association), is a drill bit that cuts an annulus and leaves a center core. Trepans usually have multiple carbide inserts and rely on water to cool the cutting tips and to flush chips out of the hole. Trepans are often used to cut large diameters and deep holes. Typical bit diameters are and hole depth from up to .

==For wood==

===Brad point bit===
The brad point drill bit (also known as lip and spur drill bit, and dowel drill bit) is a variation of the twist drill bit which is optimized for drilling in wood.

Conventional twist drill bits tend to wander when presented to a flat workpiece. For metalwork, this is countered by drilling a pilot hole with a spotting drill bit. In wood, the brad point drill bit is another solution: the center of the drill bit is given not the straight chisel of the twist drill bit, but a spur with a sharp point, and four sharp corners to cut the wood. While drilling, the sharp point of the spur pushes into the soft wood to keep the drill bit in line.

Metals are typically isotropic, so even an ordinary twist drill bit will shear the edges of the hole cleanly. &quot;Wood&quot; drilled across the grain, however, produces long strands of wood fiber. These long strands tend to pull out of the hole, rather than being cleanly cut at the hole edge. The brad point drill bit has the outside corner of the cutting edges leading, so that it cuts the periphery of the hole before the inner parts of the cutting edges plane off the base of the hole. By cutting the periphery first, the lip maximizes the chance that the fibers can be cut cleanly, rather than having to be pulled messily from the timber.

Brad point drill bits are also effective in soft plastic. When using conventional twist drill bits in a handheld drill, where the drilling direction is not maintained perfectly throughout the operation, there is a tendency for hole edges to be &quot;smeared&quot; due to side friction and heat.

In metal, the brad point drill bit is confined to drilling only the thinnest and softest sheet metals, ideally with a drill press. The bits have an extremely fast cutting tool geometry: no point angle, combined with a large (considering the flat cutting edge) lip angle, causes the edges to take a very aggressive cut with relatively little point pressure. This means these bits tend to bind in metal; given a workpiece of sufficient thinness, they have a tendency to punch through and leave the bit&#x27;s cross-sectional geometry behind.

Brad point drill bits are ordinarily available in diameters from .

===Wood spade bit===
Spade bits are used for rough boring in wood. They tend to cause splintering when they emerge from the workpiece. Woodworkers avoid splintering by finishing the hole from the opposite side of the work. Spade bits are flat, with a centering point and two cutters. The cutters are often equipped with spurs in an attempt to ensure a cleaner hole. With their small shank diameters relative to their boring diameters, spade bit shanks often have flats forged or ground into them to prevent slipping in drill chucks. Some bits are equipped with long shanks and have a small hole drilled through the flat part, allowing them to be used much like a bell-hanger bit. Intended for high speed use, they are used with electric hand drills. Spade bits are also sometimes referred to as &quot;paddle bits&quot;.

Spade drill bits are ordinarily available in diameters from 6 to 36 mm, or to inches.

===Spoon bit===
Spoon bits consist of a grooved shank with a point shaped somewhat like the bowl of a spoon, with the cutting edge on the end. The more common type is like a gouge bit that ends in a slight point. This is helpful for starting the hole, as it has a center that will not wander or walk. These bits are used by chair-makers for boring or reaming holes in the seats and arms of chairs. Their design is ancient, going back to Roman times. Spoon bits have even been found in Viking excavations. Modern spoon bits are made of hand-forged carbon steel, carefully heat-treated and then hand ground to a fine edge.

Spoon bits are the traditional boring tools used with a brace. They should never be used with a power drill of any kind. Their key advantage over regular brace bits and power drill bits is that the angle of the hole can be adjusted. This is very important in chairmaking, because all the angles are usually eyeballed. Another advantage is that they do not have a lead screw, so they can be drilled successfully in a chair leg without having the lead screw peek out the other side.

When reaming a pre-bored straight-sided hole, the spoon bit is inserted into the hole and rotated in a clockwise direction with a carpenters&#x27; brace until the desired taper is achieved. When boring into solid wood, the bit should be started in the vertical position; after a &quot;dish&quot; has been created and the bit has begun to &quot;bite&quot; into the wood, the angle of boring can be changed by tilting the brace a bit out of the vertical. Holes can be drilled precisely, cleanly and quickly in any wood, at any angle of incidence, with total control of direction and the ability to change that direction at will.

Parallel spoon bits are used primarily for boring holes in the seat of a Windsor chair to take the back spindles, or similar round-tenon work when assembling furniture frames in green woodworking work.

The spoon bit may be honed by using a slipstone on the inside of the cutting edge; the outside edge should never be touched.

===Forstner bit===

Forstner bits were patented by Benjamin Forstner in 1886. They bore precise, flat-bottomed holes in wood, in any orientation with respect to the wood grain. They can cut on the edge of a block of wood, and can cut overlapping holes; for such applications they are normally used in drill presses or lathes rather than in hand-held electric drills. Because of the flat bottom of the hole, they are useful for drilling through veneer already glued to add an inlay.

The bit includes a center brad point which guides it throughout the cut (and incidentally spoils the otherwise flat bottom of the hole). The cylindrical cutter around the perimeter shears the wood fibers at the edge of the bore, and also helps guide the bit into the material more precisely. Forstner bits have radial cutting edges to plane off the material at the bottom of the hole. The bits shown in the images have two radial edges; other designs may have more. Forstner bits have no mechanism to clear chips from the hole, and therefore must be pulled out periodically.

Sawtooth bits are also available, which include many more cutting edges to the cylinder. These cut faster, but produce a more ragged hole. They have advantages over Forstner bits when boring into end grain.

Bits are commonly available in sizes from diameter. Sawtooth bits are available up to diameter.

Originally the Forstner bit was very successful with gunsmiths because of its ability to drill an exceedingly smooth-sided hole.

===Center bit===
The center bit is optimized for drilling in wood with a hand brace. Many different designs have been produced.

The center of the bit is a tapered screw thread. This screws into the wood as the bit is turned, and pulls the bit into the wood. There is no need for any force to push the bit into the workpiece, only the torque to turn the bit. This is ideal for a bit for a hand tool. The radial cutting edges remove a slice of wood of thickness equal to the pitch of the central screw for each rotation of the bit. To pull the bit from the hole, either the female thread in the wood workpiece must be stripped, or the rotation of the bit must be reversed.

The edge of the bit has a sharpened spur to cut the fibers of the wood, as in the brad point drill bit. A radial cutting edge planes the wood from the base of the hole. In this version, there is minimal or no spiral to remove chips from the hole. The bit must be periodically withdrawn to clear the chips.

Some versions have two spurs. Some have two radial cutting edges.

Center bits do not cut well in the end grain of wood. The central screw tends to pull out, or to split the wood along the grain, and the radial edges have trouble cutting through the long wood fibers.

Center bits are made of relatively soft steel, and can be sharpened with a file.

===Auger bit===

The cutting principles of the auger bit are the same as those of the center bit above. The auger adds a long deep spiral flute for effective chip removal.

Two styles of auger bit are commonly used in hand braces: the Jennings or Jennings-pattern bit has a self-feeding screw tip, two spurs and two radial cutting edges. This bit has a double flute starting from the cutting edges, and extending several inches up the shank of the bit, for waste removal. This pattern of bit was developed by Russell Jennings in the mid-19th century.

The Irwin or solid-center auger bit is similar, the only difference being that one of the cutting edges has only a &quot;vestigal flute&quot; supporting it, which extends only about up the shank before ending. The other flute continues full-length up the shank for waste removal. The Irwin bit may afford greater space for waste removal, greater strength (because the design allows for a center shank of increased size within the flutes, as compared to the Jenning bits), or smaller manufacturing costs. This style of bit was invented in 1884, and the rights sold to Charles Irwin who patented and marketed this pattern the following year.

Both styles of auger bits were manufactured by several companies throughout the early- and mid-20th century, and are still available new from select sources today.

The diameter of auger bits for hand braces is commonly expressed by a single number, indicating the size in 16ths of an inch. For example, #4 is 4/16 or 1/4 in (6 mm), #6 is 6/16 or 3/8 in (9 mm), #9 is 9/16 in (14 mm), and #16 is 16/16 or 1 in (25 mm). Sets commonly consist of #4-16 or #4-10 bits.

The bit shown in the picture is a modern design for use in portable power tools, made in the UK in about 1995. It has a single spur, a single radial cutting edge and a single flute. Similar auger bits are made with diameters from 6 mm (3/16 in) to 30 mm (1 3/16 in). Augers up to long are available, where the chip-clearing capability is especially valuable for drilling deep holes.

===Gimlet bit===
The gimlet bit is a very old design. The bit is the same style as that used in the gimlet, a self-contained tool for boring small holes in wood by hand. Since about 1850, gimlets have had a variety of cutter designs, but some are still produced with the original version. The gimlet bit is intended to be used in a hand brace for drilling into wood. It is the usual style of bit for use in a brace for holes below about diameter.

The tip of the gimlet bit acts as a tapered screw, to draw the bit into the wood and to begin forcing aside the wood fibers, without necessarily cutting them. The cutting action occurs at the side of the broadest part of the cutter. Most drill bits cut the base of the hole. The gimlet bit cuts the side of the hole.

===Hinge sinker bit===
The hinge sinker bit is an example of a custom drill bit design for a specific application. Many European kitchen cabinets are made from particle board or medium-density fiberboard (MDF) with a laminated melamine resin veneer. Those types of pressed wood boards are not very strong, and the screws of butt hinges tend to pull out. A specialist hinge has been developed which uses the walls of a hole, bored in the particle board, for support. This is a very common and relatively successful construction method.

A Forstner bit could bore the mounting hole for the hinge, but particle board and MDF are very abrasive materials, and steel cutting edges soon wear. A tungsten carbide cutter is needed, but the complex shape of a forstner bit is difficult to manufacture in carbide, so this special drill bit with a simpler shape is commonly used. It has cutting edges of tungsten carbide brazed to a steel body; a center spur keeps the bit from wandering.

=== Adjustable wood bits === 
An adjustable wood bit, also known as an expansive wood bit, has a small center pilot bit with an adjustable, sliding cutting edge mounted above it, usually containing a single sharp point at the outside, with a set screw to lock the cutter in position. When the cutting edge is centered on the bit, the hole drilled will be small, and when the cutting edge is slid outwards, a larger hole is drilled. This allows a single drill bit to drill a wide variety of holes, and can take the place of a large, heavy set of different size bits, as well as providing uncommon bit sizes. A ruler or vernier scale is usually provided to allow precise adjustment of the bit size.

These bits are available both in a version similar to an auger bit or brace bit, designed for low speed, high torque use with a brace or other hand drill (pictured to the right), or as a high speed, low torque bit meant for a power drill. While the shape of the cutting edges is different, and one uses screw threads and the other a twist bit for the pilot, the method of adjusting them remains the same.

==Other materials==

===Diamond core bit===
The diamond masonry mortar bit is a hybrid drill bit, designed to work as a combination router and drill bit. It consists of a steel shell, with the diamonds embedded in metal segments attached to the cutting edge. These drill bits are used at relatively low speeds.

===Masonry drill bit=== 
The masonry bit shown here is a variation of the twist drill bit. The bulk of the tool is a relatively soft steel, and is machined with a mill rather than ground. An insert of tungsten carbide is brazed into the steel to provide the cutting edges.

Masonry bits typically are used with a hammer drill, which hammers the bit into the material being drilled as it rotates; the hammering breaks up the masonry at the drill bit tip, and the rotating flutes carry away the dust. Rotating the bit also brings the cutting edges onto a fresh portion of the hole bottom with every hammer blow. Hammer drill bits often use special shank shapes such as the SDS type, which allows the bit to slide within the chuck when hammering, without the whole heavy chuck executing the hammering motion.

Masonry bits of the style shown are commonly available in diameters from 3 mm to 40 mm. For larger diameters, core bits are used. Masonry bits up to long can be used with hand-portable power tools, and are very effective for installing wiring and plumbing in existing buildings.

A , similar in appearance and function to a hole punch or chisel, is used as a hand powered drill in conjunction with a hammer to drill into stone and masonry. A star drill bit&#x27;s cutting edge consists of several blades joined at the center to form a star pattern.

===Glass drill bit===
Glass bits have a spade-shaped carbide point. They generate high temperatures and have a very short life. Holes are generally drilled at low speed with a succession of increasing bit sizes. Diamond drill bits can also be used to cut holes in glass, and last much longer.

===Ceramic drill bit===
Ceramic drill bits are made to drill through glazed and unglazed ceramic tiles, for instance for installing bathroom fittings.

===PCB through-hole drill bit===
A great number of holes with small diameters of about 1 mm or less must be drilled in printed circuit boards (PCBs) used by electronic equipment with through-hole components. Most PCBs are made of highly abrasive fiberglass, which quickly wears steel bits, especially given the hundreds or thousands of holes on most circuit boards. To solve this problem, solid tungsten carbide twist bits, which drill quickly through the board while providing a moderately long life, are almost always used. Carbide PCB bits are estimated to outlast high-speed steel bits by a factor of ten or more. Other options sometimes used are diamond or diamond-coated bits.

In industry, virtually all drilling is done by automated machines, and the bits are often automatically replaced by the equipment as they wear, as even solid carbide bits do not last long in constant use. PCB bits, of narrow diameter, typically mount in a collet rather than a chuck, and come with standard-size shanks, often with pre-installed stops to set them at an exact depth every time when being automatically chucked by the equipment.

Very high rotational speeds—30,000 to 100,000 RPM or even higher—are used; this translates to a reasonably fast linear speed of the cutting tip in these very small diameters. The high speed, small diameter, and the brittleness of the material, make the bits very vulnerable to breaking, particularly if the angle of the bit to the workpiece changes at all, or the bit contacts any object. Drilling by hand is not practical, and many general-purpose drilling machines designed for larger bits rotate too slowly and wobble too much to use carbide bits effectively.

Resharpened and easily available PCB drills have historically been used in many prototyping and home PCB labs, using a high-speed rotary tool for small-diameter bits (such as a Moto-Tool by Dremel) in a stiff drill-press jig. If used for other materials these tiny bits must be evaluated for equivalent cutting speed vs material resistance to the cut (hardness), as the bit&#x27;s rake angle and expected feed per revolution are optimised for high-speed automated use on fiberglass PCB substrate.

===Installer bit===

====Fishing bit====
Installer bits, also known as bell-hanger bits or fishing bits, are a type of twist drill bit for use with a hand-portable power tool. The key distinguishing feature of an installer bit is a transverse hole drilled through the web of the bit near the tip. Once the bit has penetrated a wall, a wire can be threaded through the hole and the bit pulled back out, pulling the wire with it. The wire can then be used to pull a cable or pipe back through the wall. This is especially helpful where the wall has a large cavity, where threading a fish tape could be difficult. Some installer bits have a transverse hole drilled at the shank end as well. Once a hole has been drilled, the wire can be threaded through the shank end, the bit released from the chuck, and all pulled forward through the drilled hole. These bits are made for cement, block and brick; they are not for drilling into wood. Sinclair Smith of Brooklyn, New York was issued for this invention on January 25, 1898.

Installer bits are available in various materials and styles for drilling wood, masonry and metal.

====Flexible shaft bit====
Another, different, bit also called an installer bit has a very long flexible shaft, typically up to long, with a small twist bit at the end. The shaft is made of spring steel instead of hardened steel, so it can be flexed while drilling without breaking. This allows the bit to be curved inside walls, for example to drill through studs from a light switch box without needing to remove any material from the wall. These bits usually come with a set of special tools to aim and flex the bit to reach the desired location and angle, although the problem of seeing where the operator is drilling still remains.

This flexible installer bit is used in the US, but does not appear to be routinely available in Europe.

==Drill bit shank==

Different shapes of shank are used. Some are simply the most appropriate for the chuck used; in other cases particular combinations of shank and chuck give performance advantages, such as allowing higher torque, greater centering accuracy, or efficient hammering action.

<text>Poulton-le-Fylde (), commonly shortened to Poulton, is a market town in Lancashire, England, situated on the coastal plain called the Fylde. In the 2021 United Kingdom census, it had a population of 18,115. 

There is evidence of human habitation in the area from 12,000 years ago, and several archaeological finds from Roman settlement in England have been found in the area. At the time of the Norman conquest, Poulton was a small agricultural settlement in the hundred of Amounderness. The church of St Chad was recorded in 1094, when it was endowed to Lancaster Priory.

By the post-Medieval period, the town had become an important commercial centre for the region with weekly and triannual markets. Goods were imported and exported through two harbours on the River Wyre. In 1837, the town was described as the &quot;metropolis of the Fylde&quot;, but its commercial importance waned from the mid-19th century with the development of the nearby coastal towns of Fleetwood and Blackpool.

Poulton has the administrative centre of the Borough of Wyre and is in the parliamentary constituency of Fylde. It is part of the Blackpool Urban Area and approximately from Blackpool town centre. There are rail links to Blackpool and Preston, and bus routes to the larger towns and villages of the Fylde.

Poulton has a library and two secondary schools: Baines School and Hodgson Academy. There is a farmers&#x27; market once a month, and since October 2011 there has been a weekly market on Mondays in the centre of the town.

==History==
===Early history===
There is evidence of human habitation in the area around Poulton from 10,000 BC. In 1970, building work in nearby Carleton uncovered the 12,000-year-old skeleton of an elk, along with two bone or antler points close to its hind bones. At the time of the Roman conquest of Britain in the 1st century AD, the area was inhabited by a Celtic tribe called the Setantii. A 4th century hoard of 400 Roman coins was found in the area, near Fleetwood. Other finds have been made in Poulton and Skippool; in addition to coins, these have included a medal of Germanicus and a hipposandal (similar to a horseshoe).

Although there is little archaeological evidence of Anglo-Saxon activity in the area following the departure of the Romans, local place names incorporate Old English elements like &quot;tūn&quot; (&quot;farmstead&quot;), suggesting that they were founded in that period. Nearby examples are Thornton, Marton and Carleton. Poulton was recorded in 1086 as &quot;Poltun&quot;; the name is derived from the Old English words &quot;pull&quot; or &quot;pōl&quot; + &quot;tūn&quot; meaning &quot;farmstead by a pool or creek&quot;. In later years, it was recorded variously as &quot;Pultun&quot;, &quot;Polton&quot;, &quot;Potton&quot;, &quot;Poolton&quot; and &quot;Poulton&quot;. The affix &quot;le-Fylde&quot; (&quot;in the district called the Fylde&quot;) was added in 1842 with the arrival of the Penny Post, to distinguish the town from Poulton-le-Sands, a village that is now part of Morecambe.

Poulton is one of seven ancient parishes of the hundred of Amounderness. Prior to the Norman conquest in 1066, Amounderness was in the possession of Earl Tostig, the brother of King Harold II. Tostig died at the Battle of Stamford Bridge and his lands were subsequently taken over by the Normans. Between 1069 and 1086 William the Conqueror gave Amounderness to Anglo-Norman Baron Roger the Poitevin. In the &quot;Domesday Book&quot; of 1086 Poulton&#x27;s area was estimated to contain two carucates of arable land. The survey recorded three churches in Amounderness though not by name. Later documentary evidence suggests that they were probably the churches at Poulton, Kirkham and St Michael&#x27;s on Wyre. The dedication of Poulton&#x27;s church to 7th century Anglo-Saxon saint Chad of Mercia lends weight to its pre-conquest foundation, although it is possible that it was built between 1086 and 1094.

In 1094, Roger the Poitevin founded the Benedictine priory of St. Mary at Lancaster, as a cell of the Norman Abbey of St. Martin in Sées. He endowed the priory with the church and land at Poulton. Roger was eventually banished from the country and his lands returned to the possession of the Crown. In 1194 King Richard I granted the hundred of Amounderness to Theobald Walter, 1st Baron Butler, who held it until his death in 1206. In 1268, King Henry III granted the wapentake of Amounderness to his son Edmund Crouchback, who became the 1st Earl of Lancaster around this time.

The amount of land in Poulton owned by St. Mary&#x27;s Priory increased during the 12th and 13th centuries and caused conflict with local landowners over whose land the tenants and monks of the priory had to cross. In 1276, Sir Adam Banastre and his supporters assaulted the prior, Ralph de Truno, as he travelled to Poulton. He and his attendants were taken by Banastre, beaten and imprisoned in Thornton. An investigation into the incident was instigated by the king; no record survives. In 1330, a compromise was made when two roads were built through Banastre&#x27;s land which enabled the prior and his tenants to travel freely to Poulton. During the 13th and 14th centuries, much of the land at Poulton was given to Cockersand Abbey in Lancaster and rented back to local farm workers. Much of the land in the Fylde was donated either to Cockersand Abbey or Whalley Abbey. To efficiently manage and farm these lands, granges were built at Singleton and Staining. When the alien priories (those under control of religious houses abroad) were dissolved in 1415, the church at Poulton was conveyed to the Abbey of Syon in Middlesex.

In the 17th century Civil Wars, townspeople of Poulton fought on both sides, although more men from the Fylde were on the side of the Royalists. No battles occurred in or close to Poulton but the area was affected with the rest of the county by the widespread poverty that resulted from the wars. In 1643 interest was stirred in the parish when a large Spanish vessel dropped anchor off the coast at Rossall. The ship made no movement for several days but fired its guns occasionally. Locals initially feared an invasion, but eventually realised that the crew was in distress and had been signalling for help. The vessel was carrying ammunition for the Parliamentarian forces and the crew had become sick and feeble. The ship was brought by Royalists into the mouth of the River Wyre and the Earl of Derby marched from across the River Ribble. He ordered the ship to be burnt and the Spanish crew to be set free.

The port of Poulton played a role in the Atlantic slave trade during the 18th century, with at least four slaving voyages setting off from Poulton between 1753 and 1757.

In the 18th century it was the custom for the wealthy in Poulton to bury their dead at night, following a lamp-lit procession through town. This tradition lasted until 1810. In 1732, during the procession preceding the funeral of Geoffrey Hornby, strong winds caused sparks to fly from the lighted tapers carried by mourners. The buildings on the west side of Market Place, low cottages with thatched roofs, caught fire and were destroyed. After local fund-raising the houses were eventually replaced with brick buildings with tile roofs.

===19th and 20th centuries===

Poulton became an important centre for trade in the area. With harbours on either side of the River Wyre, at Skippool and Wardleys, it was able to import goods from as far away as Russia and North America. Flax was imported from Ireland and the Baltic, timber came from across the Atlantic and tallow from Russia. Records from 1806 to 1808 show that Poulton imported limestone from Ulverston, oats from Ulverston, Kirkcudbright, Dumfries, Wigtown, Whitehaven and Liverpool, and coal from Preston. Cheese was exported to the same places. By the 18th century, markets for cattle and cloth were being held in the town in February, April and November, with corn fairs every Monday. It is unclear at what point Poulton began life as a market town; it was never granted a market charter and so markets were held by prescription. The market cross probably dates from the 17th century.

The linen industry was widespread in the Fylde during the 18th century and Poulton&#x27;s importation of flax was essential. There were large warehouses at Skippool and Wardleys, owned by linen merchants from Kirkham. By the 19th century, craftsmen in Poulton were an important part of the industry. In the early part of the 19th century, there was a significant decline in the craft industries because of increased mechanisation, as well as increased demand for labour. In contrast to neighbouring Kirkham, Poulton appeared to suffer from a lack of enthusiasm for new industrial techniques and opportunities among its industry leaders.

Poulton&#x27;s commercial importance was affected by the growth in the 19th century of two nearby coastal towns. In 1836 the first building was constructed in the new, planned town of Fleetwood, north of Poulton, at the mouth of the River Wyre. Fleetwood was conceived by local landowner and Preston Member of Parliament (MP) Sir Peter Hesketh-Fleetwood as a major port and a link for passengers travelling from London to Scotland. To achieve these ideals, a rail link was needed and the new town soon heralded the arrival of the railway to the area. A line connecting Fleetwood with Preston was completed in 1840, with Poulton as one of the stops. Although Fleetwood immediately superseded Poulton as a port (the customs house was quickly moved to Fleetwood), Poulton initially benefited commercially from the rail link. The importation of Irish and Scottish cattle through Fleetwood enabled a fortnightly cattle market to be held in Poulton. At the same time, Blackpool was developing as a resort and for a few years, visitors travelled by rail to Poulton and then on to Blackpool by horse-drawn charabancs or omnibuses. A line between Poulton and Blackpool was completed in 1846. As Fleetwood and Blackpool&#x27;s own commercial capabilities developed, and Kirkham&#x27;s prominence in the linen industry continued to grow, Poulton&#x27;s importance declined.

Mains electricity was brought to Poulton-le-Fylde around 1928.

==Governance==

Historically, Poulton-le-Fylde was one of seven ecclesiastical parishes of the Amounderness hundred, an ancient division of the historic county of Lancashire, with a total area of . The parish included the townships of Poulton, Carleton, Thornton, Hardhorn-With-Newton and Marton. Poulton was governed by a parish council until 1900, when the parish was superseded by Poulton Urban District. The urban district council was based at the old town hall.

Today, with respect to civil parishes, Poulton is unparished. In 1974, following the Local Government Act 1972, Poulton Urban District merged with those of Preesall and Thornton-Cleveleys, the municipal borough of Fleetwood and the rural district of Garstang to form the borough of Wyre. The town has the borough council&#x27;s administrative centre, with its offices in Poulton Civic Centre.

The town is governed locally by a two-tier council system, being a part of both Lancashire County Council and Wyre Borough Council with both councils having different responsibilities for the area. Elections are held for Lancashire County Council every four years with elections to Wyre Borough Council also taking place every four years, but two years after the county elections. For borough elections Poulton contains four wards: Breck, Hardhorn, Highcross and Tithebarn. All four wards elect two councillors each to Wyre Borough Council. Poulton-le-Fylde is also a county division for the Lancashire County Council elections which is made up of the majority of the four wards and elects one councillor to the county council. At the most recent borough election in 2011 the town&#x27;s four wards each elected two Conservative Party councillors, including the mayor of Wyre for 2011 David Bannister and the current leader of the council Peter Gibson.
At the county election in 2009, the town elected a Conservative Party councillor, Geoffrey Roper.

The town is represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom as part of Wyre and Preston North. It elects one MP by the first past the post system of election. Since its creation for the 2010 general election, Wyre and Preston North has been represented at Parliament by Conservative MP Ben Wallace. Prior to the 2010 general election, Poulton-le-Fylde was part of the constituency of Lancaster and Wyre.

==Geography==

At (53.847°, −2.995°), and approximately northwest of London, Poulton-le-Fylde stands above sea level. It is approximately north-east of Blackpool and approximately north-west of Preston. It is situated on the Fylde, a coastal plain that is approximately a square peninsula. The town is on flat, slightly raised ground, approximately from the River Wyre and from the Irish Sea. Until the 20th century, the town consisted of only a few streets surrounding the central market place; it became surrounded by housing developments from the end of the Second World War. The Poulton urban area is adjacent to Carleton and Hardhorn, and close to the Blackpool Urban Area. The land to the east of the town is mostly agricultural.

The bedrock of the area consists of Permo-Triassic sandstones and particularly Triassic mudstones. These old rocks lie beneath sea-level and are invisible beneath drift made up of glacial till deposits and post-glacial colluvium and alluvium deposits; there is a smaller amount of peat.

Poulton has a generally temperate maritime climate like much of the British Isles, with cool summers and mild winters. There is an annual average rainfall of .

==Demography==

At the 2001 UK census, the urban area of Poulton-le-Fylde had a population of 18,264. The 2001 population density for Wyre was 3.74 per hectare, with a 100 to 90.7 female-to-male ratio. The proportion of residents who classified themselves as White was 98.9%, a figure higher than the average for the North West (94.4%) and England (90.9%). Those classifying themselves as belonging to ethnic minorities were correspondingly lower than the regional and national averages. Of those over 16 years old, 22.5% were single (never married), 46.0% married and 8.49% divorced. Although the proportion of divorced people was similar to that of the North West and England, the rates of those who were married were higher than the regional and national averages (North West: 42.8%; England: 43.5%). The rates of those in Wyre who were single were significantly lower than the national and regional averages (North West: 30.1%; England: 30.2%).

Wyre&#x27;s 45,295 households included 29.1% one-person, 37.3% married couples living together, 6.8% co-habiting couples, and 9.0% single parents with their children; these figures were similar to those of the North West and England. Of those aged 16–74, 31.1% had no academic qualifications, similar to that of 31.9% in all of the North West but higher than 28.9% in all of England. Wyre had a lower percentage of adults with a diploma or degree than the North West as a whole. Of Wyre residents aged 16–74, 15.7% had an educational qualification such as first degree, higher degree, qualified teacher status, qualified medical doctor, qualified dentist, a qualified nurse, midwife, or health visitor, compared to 17.2% in the North West and 19.9% nationwide.

===Population change===
Typical of rural agricultural settlements, Poulton&#x27;s population increased by almost 25% through the first two decades of the 19th century. In the decades after 1831, the town&#x27;s population growth slowed, reflecting Poulton&#x27;s failure to adapt to the changes of industrial society.
==Economy==

In the 13th century, Poulton&#x27;s economy was largely agricultural. Over the next centuries, the town became a commercial centre for the area, importing and exporting goods through harbours on the River Wyre at Skippool and Wardleys. Imports of flax were vital for a local linen industry, particularly in nearby Kirkham, and Poulton craftsmen were part of this industry by the beginning of the 19th century. During the early part of this century the changes brought by the Industrial Revolution led to a decline in the craft industries in Poulton. New methods were not embraced by local producers and the town suffered from its location, far from coalfields and large labour markets. Following the development of the new town and port of Fleetwood from 1836, Poulton&#x27;s role as a major commerce centre waned. For some time, the town&#x27;s market remained important as a local supply of goods for growing Fleetwood and Blackpool. Eventually, Poulton was overshadowed by Fleetwood and Blackpool. In his 1837 work on Blackpool, William Thornber called Poulton the &quot;metropolis of the Fylde&quot;. This was a time when Poulton was still prominent among its near neighbours; David Foster commented in 1972 that not only was Thornber&#x27;s description of the town no longer apt, it had ceased to be accurate even from 1850 with the rapid growth of the coastal resorts.

Although the unemployment rate in Wyre is higher than that of the North West and England, in 2004 a Market Town Initiative study noted that the level of unemployment in Poulton was lower than the regional and national averages, at 1.41%. Business in the town is centred at the Poulton Industrial Estate. Agriculture is still important locally; in 2001 2.6% of workers in Wyre were employed in agriculture, hunting or forestry (compared to 1.2% in the North West and 1.5% in England).

==Culture and community==
In 2004 a group appointed by Wyre Borough Council carried out a study of Poulton as part of the Countryside Agency&#x27;s Market Town Initiative. Their &quot;Health Check and Action Plan&quot; identified &quot;economic, transport &amp; accessibility, environmental and social strengths and weaknesses&quot; of Poulton. The study noted that the town has no cinemas, theatres, museums or galleries and that there was popular demand for a cinema, a weekly market and more independent retailers. There was also concern among residents that there are not enough facilities for young people. Poulton has a library, operated by Lancashire County Council.

Poulton&#x27;s public spaces include the Jean Stansfield Memorial Park, Tithebarn Park and the Cottam Hall Playing Fields. Tithebarn Park, north-west of the town centre, was built on the site of a former railway halt, Poulton Curve. It features grass play areas. The Cottam Hall Playing Fields, to the west of the town centre, include sports pitches and allotments. There is a cricket ground to the north-east of the town. Poulton includes part of the Wyre Way footpath.

Poulton Gala is held annually in June and a farmers&#x27; market is held on the fourth Saturday of every month. In October 2011, Wyre Borough Council introduced the return of a weekly market which takes place in the centre of Poulton every Monday.

The town is also where, in the 1970s, the punk group Skrewdriver was formed. Although initially apolitical, the band went on to become internationally known as a white power skinhead rock band.

==Sport==
===Poulton F.C.===
Poulton F.C., based at Cottam Hall on Blackpool Old Road, play in the West Lancashire Football League Premier Division (the 11th tier of the English football pyramid) as of August 2020. The club was founded in 1947 as Poulton Athletic. In 1961, an amalgamation occurred between Poulton Athletic and Poulton United, forming Poulton Town F.C. In 2013, &quot;Town&quot; was dropped from its name, becoming today&#x27;s Poulton F.C.

===Fylde Cricket Club===
Fylde Cricket Club, founded in the early 19th century, is one of the oldest clubs in Lancashire. Its home ground is commonly known as &quot;The G&quot;, based on Moorland Road, close to Hodgson School.

Fylde joined the league in 1922. They won the Loxham Cup in the early 1970s and, in the decade that followed, the Shield and the Meyler on several occasions. The second eleven also added to the trophy collection by winning the respective competitions on a number of occasions. They formed third and fourth teams and played in the Fylde League, providing a bridge between junior and senior league cricket.

The club&#x27;s first XI competes in the Palace Shield Premier Division, with a second and Sunday development team also running.

===Wyre Cricket Club===
The club, also based at Cottam Hall, was formed in 1994 after the break-up of the Over Wyre A and B teams and competed in the Fylde Cricket League. In 1995, the club was renamed again as Thornton International CC because of a name clash with one of Thornton’s football teams. Further changes took place where the club was re-badged again to the current name of Wyre Cricket Club and took residence at Myerscough College in 1996. After Myerscough College built a golf academy on the grounds, the club moved again to Baines School in Poulton-le-Fylde in 2000, and then in 2006 to its current home at Cottam Hall. Wyre CC left the Fylde Cricket League in 2013 (at the end of the 2014 season the Fylde Cricket League was officially dissolved). 

The club joined the Palace Shield Cricket League for the 2014 season. The 1st XI won back-to-back promotions in the first years of joining. Some years later, the club entered the 2nd XI into the Palace Shield league. The club also has a mid-week T20 team and competes in the Palace Shield T20 league.

==Landmarks==
Poulton town centre has been a Conservation Area since 1979, and fifteen buildings and structures in the town have been designated as listed buildings by English Heritage for their special architectural, historical or cultural significance. These include two religious buildings, the structures in the market place and several houses.

The market place, at the centre of Poulton, is the width of two streets and is now closed to motor traffic. Lying south of St Chad&#x27;s Church and surrounded by shops, the square contains the town&#x27;s war memorial as well as a market cross, stocks, whipping post and fish slabs, from which fish were sold on market days. Although many of the buildings surrounding the marketplace were rebuilt following a fire in the 18th century, a few of the earlier buildings remain. To the south of the marketplace, on Blackpool Old Road, are townhouses that were built for local merchants and professionals.

Public houses and inns flourished early on in Poulton due to its status as a market town. One of the most important inns was the Golden Ball, which probably dates from the 18th century. It was also the meeting place of the local court, and at the end of the 19th century, the town&#x27;s cattle market was moved behind the pub from the marketplace. The Thatched House pub existed in 1793 and may have been built in the Middle Ages. It was rebuilt in 1910 in the Mock Tudor style and has been identified as one of the town&#x27;s &quot;key landmarks&quot; by the Poulton Market Town Initiative. In the 19th century, the Ship Inn, located at the corner of Breck Road and Vicarage Road, was a rowdy pub popular with Fleetwood seamen, travelling labourers and locals. In the 1920s, it became a working men&#x27;s club and, from 1928 to 2001, a Conservative club. It is an Edwardian building constructed in red brick with red sandstone dressings. It has a corner tower and the walls have carvings of ships. Since 2000, it has operated as a café, wine bar and nightclub called the Cube.

==Religion==

St Chad&#x27;s Church, the Anglican parish church, is in the centre of town, bordering the marketplace. It has been designated a Grade II* listed building by English Heritage. The current structure dates largely from the mid-18th century when the previous church was demolished, although the tower is from the 17th century. The church is constructed of stone and has a slate roof. A round Norman-style apse was added in 1868. The churchyard, mainly to the south and east of the building, is noted for its display of crocuses in the spring. After the English Reformation there remained a strong Roman Catholic influence in the parish, with worship particularly focused in Singleton. In the late 16th century there were 13 houses in the parish that were known to shelter seminarians. In 1583, the family of Cardinal William Allen, a prominent opponent of the Reformation, were holding three or four masses daily at their home at nearby Rossall. In the early 19th century, a Roman Catholic chapel was built in the town of Poulton. St John the Evangelist&#x27;s was built in the north of the town on Breck Road. The building, with its attached presbytery is constructed of rendered brick with a slate roof and has been designated a Grade II listed building. Tradition has it that at some time during the 19th century, the vicar of St. Chad&#x27;s donated to that church a particularly &quot;papist&quot; vestment. The chapel was replaced by a larger church built a few metres to the south in 1912. The new building, constructed of rock-faced red sandstone in a stripped Romanesque style, was designed by Cuthbert Pugin of Pugin &amp; Pugin.

The first establishment of Nonconformists in Poulton were the Methodists, in 1784. The group met in a room behind the King&#x27;s Arms and initially suffered persecution from other locals. They built a chapel in what is now Church Street in 1819, the second Methodist chapel to be built on the Fylde. The chapel was enlarged in 1861 and 1909 and finally demolished in 1970, replaced by a new chapel in Queen Street. The Congregational church established a chapel in the town in 1809. Its use was intermittent and at one point the building was used as a warehouse. A new chapel was built in 1899.

In the 2001 census 83.06% of respondents in Wyre gave their religion as Christianity. This is higher than the average for the North West (78.01%) and England (71.74). Muslim residents made up 0.18% of respondents in Wyre, 0.15% were Buddhist, 0.14% were Hindu, 0.10% were Jewish and 0.05% were Sikh; these figures are all lower than the regional and national averages. A further 9.40% of people in the borough stated that they had no religion, also a lower figure than the regional and national averages.

==Transport==

The development in the first half of the 19th century of Fleetwood led to the arrival of the railway in the Fylde. The Preston &amp; Wyre Railway and Harbour Company was formed to connect Fleetwood to Preston and the Preston and Wyre Railway line was completed in 1840. Poulton-le-Fylde railway station, on the line between Kirkham and Fleetwood was originally situated at the bottom of the Breck, the road leading north out of Poulton. A branch connecting Poulton to Blackpool opened in 1846, meeting the existing line in a triangular junction with very tight curves towards Blackpool. By 1892, plans were underway to realign the tracks and rebuild the station at the top of the Breck. The fears of local people were realised in 1893 when a train travelling too fast derailed at the bend, killing three people. The new station was built in 1896. A railway halt called Poulton Curve was built in 1923 and was in use for trains between Fleetwood and Blackpool until 1952. Today, Poulton is a stop on the Caldervale Line and the Blackpool Branch Line. It lies between Kirkham and Wesham (towards Preston) and Layton (towards Blackpool North). The Fleetwood Branch Line closed to passengers in 1970; in 2009, a report by the Association of Train Operating Companies suggested that there would be a &quot;strong business case&quot; to reopen the line.

Poulton is approximately west of the M6 motorway and is linked to it by the M55 at Greenhalgh. There are A roads to Fleetwood, Blackpool, Preston, Garstang and Lancaster. The town is served by five bus companies — Blackpool Transport, Stagecoach, Coastal Coaches, Cumfybus and Transpora — providing links to the Fylde&#x27;s coastal towns, as well as villages Over Wyre and Preston.

Poulton was previously served by Blackpool Airport, approximately away; however, the airport no longer has any commercial service and is instead served by the larger Liverpool John Lennon Airport and Manchester Airport.

==Education==

Poulton has two secondary schools, the oldest of which dates from the 18th century. In 1717, local woollendraper James Baines left money in his will to found three free schools in the parish: in Poulton, Marton and Thornton. All three still exist. Baines School in Poulton was rebuilt in 1828 and closed temporarily in the late 19th century, reopening as Baines Endowed School. Today it is a voluntary aided non-denominational comprehensive secondary school. It has 1,008 pupils aged 11–18 and was rated as &quot;good&quot; in its 2007 Ofsted report. Hodgson Academy (formerly Hodgson School) is a comprehensive secondary school that opened in 1932. It has 1,108 pupils aged 11–16 and in 2008 was rated by Ofsted as &quot;outstanding&quot;. The school converted to academy status in 2011.

There are four primary schools in the town: Breck Primary School, St John&#x27;s Catholic Primary School, Carr Head Primary School and St Chad&#x27;s Church of England Primary School. All have been rated either &quot;good&quot; or &quot;outstanding&quot; in past Ofsted inspections.

==Public services==
Poulton&#x27;s water and sewerage facilities are provided by United Utilities. The distribution network operator for electricity is Electricity North West. Home Office policing is provided by Lancashire Constabulary. There was previously one police station in Poulton, which closed in January 2018.

National Health Services are provided by NHS North West and primary care is delivered by the NHS North Lancashire Primary Care Trust. In 2004, the Poulton Market Town Initiative noted 11 general practices in the town (including Carleton). Secondary care is provided by the Blackpool Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust. Acute medical cases are handled by Victoria Hospital in Blackpool and the North West Ambulance Service provides emergency patient transport.

<text>The Territory of Utah was an organized incorporated territory of the United States that existed from September 9, 1850, until January 4, 1896, when the final extent of the territory was admitted to the Union as the State of Utah, the 45th state. At its creation, the Territory of Utah included all of the present-day State of Utah, most of the current state of Nevada save for a portion of Southern Nevada (including the metro area of the city of Las Vegas), much of modern western Colorado, and the extreme southwest corner of present-day Wyoming.

==History==

When the Mormon pioneers moving westward across the Great Plains began settling the Salt Lake Valley around the Great Salt Lake in 1847 and for many years afterward, they relied on existing institutions within the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) or the secular civil governments.

The Utah Territory was organized by an Organic Act of the United States Congress, approved by the newly succeeded 13th President Millard Fillmore (1800–1874, served 1850–1853), only two months after the former Vice President acceded to the higher office upon the sudden death in July 1850 of his military general predecessor Zachary Taylor. The Utah Territory bill was approved by him in September 1850, on the same day that the State of California was admitted to the Union as the 31st state (and the first time the American Union jumping across the North American continent to the opposite Pacific Ocean west coast). Plus the original larger New Mexico Territory in the Great Southwest was added and erected from the southern portion of the huge Mexican Cession in 1849 of former Centralist Republic of Mexico lands, (which amounted to the northwestern one-third of their country) following their defeat in the Mexican–American War.of 1846-1848. The creation of the new Territory of Utah around the Great Basin and the Great Salt Lake was part of the elements of agreements in the political Compromise of 1850 made in the national capital of Washington, D.C. that sought to preserve the balance of power between Southern slave states and free states in the North. With the exception of a small area around the headwaters of the upper Colorado River in present-day Colorado, the United States had acquired all the northwestern lands of the territory and former provinces from southern neighbor Mexico after the negotiations and ratification of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo of 1848, following several additional battles along the Gulf of Mexico coast and central heartland, resulting in the occupation of the Mexican capital of Mexico City by Invading American military forces and their surrender with the end of the brief war. The peace treaty later passing in Congress in the upper chamber of the U.S. Senate, (which approves all foreign treaties according to the U.S. Constitution) and the lower chamber of the House of Representatives voted in the subsequent supplemental legislation in favor of organizing the federal Territory of Utah, 97–85.

The creation of the Territory with no mention at all of the divisive issue of slavery in the documents, was partially the result of a petition sent by the Mormon pioneers under the leadership of Brigham Young (1801–1877, served 1847–1877), the second church president. The petition had asked Congress to allow them to enter the Union as the State of Deseret, (which they had already organized the year before) with its capital as Salt Lake City and with proposed borders that encompassed the entire Great Basin and the watershed of the Colorado River, including all or part of nine current U.S. states in the southwest. The Mormon settlers had drafted a state constitution in 1849 and Deseret had become the &quot;de facto&quot; government in the Great Basin by the time of the creation of the subsequent Federal Utah Territory.

Following the organization of the Territory, second church president Young was inaugurated as its first territorial Governor of Utah. The first Territorial Capital City and Capitol building was located 1850 to 1856 in the small town of Fillmore, Utah, named for the new 13th President Millard Fillmore, who approved and signed the Congressional organic act and territorial erection bill of September 1850, and the small local government was set up here including the meetings of the Territorial Assembly, although first governor and second LDS Church president Brigham Young remained mostly in his Beehive House (current historic site) residence in Salt Lake City, but traveling to Fillmore 1850 to 1856, until his death in 1877. The capital of the Utah Territory was relocated that year of 1856 to the major and largest town of Salt Lake City, which built a new territorial capitol building for the government and its assembly and governor&#x27;s offices for the next four decades and which also continued as the new state capital after statehood in 1896. A massive monumental Utah State Capitol building with landmark dome was later constructed there on the scenic ridge overlooking from the slopes of the surrounding Wasatch Range mountains to the present.

During Brigham Young&#x27;s governorship, he exerted considerable power over the territory. An example being that in 1873, the territory legislature gave to Governor / President Young the exclusive right to manufacture and distil whiskey.

Mormon governance in the territory was regarded as controversial by much of the rest of the nation, partly fed by continuing lurid newspaper depictions of the polygamy marriage practiced by the settlers, which itself had been part of the cause of their flight from their previous homes and center back East in Nauvoo, Illinois, in the United States, trekking westward across the continent to the Great Salt Lake basin after being persecuted and forcibly removed from their settlements in several Eastern states.

Although the Mormons were now the majority in the Great Salt Lake basin, the western area of the new territory soon began to attract many non-Mormon settlers, especially after the discovery of silver at the famous Comstock Lode ore deposits in the Virginia City area, east of the Sierra Nevada mountain ranges and Lake Tahoe (of present-day western Nevada) in 1858. Only three years later on the eve of the outbreak of the American Civil War in 1861, and partly as a result of this, with its importance of the recovered silver bullion for Federal Treasury coffers plus huge growth in population with the influx of prospecting miners (and assorted supporting commercial business interests) and with the subsequent intensive deep shaft industrial mining and drilling, the new Nevada Territory was then created out of the western part of the previous Utah Territory of a decade before. Non-Mormons also entered the opposite side in the easternmost part of the territory during the Pikes Peak Gold Rush, resulting in the discovery of gold at Breckenridge in the Utah Territory in 1859 (ten years after the first mineral findings along the American River in California, resulting in the phenomenal California gold rush of 1849-1855 there). So also in that same year of 1861, additional legislative action was taken by the Congress and the new 16th President Abraham Lincoln (1809–1865, served 1861–1865), to take a large portion of the eastern area of the Utah Territory to be separated and added to as part of the newly created adjacent Colorado Territory further east.

In 1869, the territory&#x27;s legislature (the Territorial Assembly) approved and ratified women&#x27;s suffrage. This allowed women to vote in all future territorial elections continuing to 1896 with statehood (although both male and female residents in American territories had no voice or vote in Federal elections back East).

A total of 46 years elapsed between the organization of the territory and its admission to the Union in 1896 as the 45th State of Utah, long after the admission of other federal territories created after it. In contrast, the Nevada Territory to the west, although more sparsely populated, was admitted to the Union in 1864 in the midst of the ongoing American Civil War only three years after its territorial formation, and Colorado was admitted in 1876 during the American Centennial celebration year, fifteen years after first becoming a territory.
==Coat of arms==
The Utah state coat of arms appears on the state seal and state flag. The beehive was chosen as the emblem for the provisional State of Deseret in 1848 and represents the state&#x27;s industrious and hard-working inhabitants, and the virtues of thrift and perseverance. The sego lilies on either side symbolize peace.

== Territory Flag ==
The first flag to represent the Territory flew in 1851 and consist of 13 red and white stripes, a blue canton with 13 stars and eagle that was positioned above a large 5 pointed star. The flag was preserved in the Smithsonian Institution for a bit, but it&#x27;s location now is unknown. The second flag was raised in 1854 and it similarly contained &quot;...stars, stripes, eagle, and beehive.&quot; The flag was raised up a flag pole on temple block to celebrated Pioneer day. The following year at the Governor&#x27;s mansion on July 4th they &quot;...unfurled the territorial flag.&quot; The third flag was depicted on a cigarette trading card in the 1880s. The flag was in a squared ratio with blue background and the Utah state coat of arms in the center. There is no evidence that the flag was ever made or flown.

==Population==
In 1850, nine churches with regular services in the Utah Territory were unclassified by historian Edwin Gaustad in his &quot;Historical Atlas of Religion in America&quot; (1962), but were probably LDS churches. In the 1890 United States census, 25 counties in the Utah Territory reported the following population counts (after seven reported the following counts in the 1850 United States census):

<text>Saltash () is a town and civil parish in south Cornwall, England. It had a population of 16,184 in 2011 census. Saltash faces the city of Plymouth over the River Tamar and is popularly known as &quot;the Gateway to Cornwall&quot;. Saltash’s landmarks include the Tamar Bridge which connects Plymouth to Cornwall by road, and the Royal Albert Bridge. The area of Latchbrook is part of the town.

==Description==

Saltash is the location of Isambard Kingdom Brunel&#x27;s Royal Albert Bridge, opened by Prince Albert on 2 May 1859. It takes the railway line across the River Tamar. Alongside it is the Tamar Bridge, a toll bridge carrying the A38 trunk road, which in 2001 became the first suspension bridge to be widened whilst remaining open to traffic.

Saltash railway station, which has a regular train service, with some routes between London Paddington station is close to the town centre.

Stagecoach South West and Go Cornwall Bus operate bus services from Saltash, into Plymouth, Launceston, Liskeard, Looe, Polperro, Padstow, and Torpoint.

The grade II listed cottage of Mary Newman, the mistress of Sir Francis Drake, is situated on Culver Road.

Nearby are the castles at Trematon and Ince, as well as the nature reserve at Churchtown Farm. Burrell House near Saltash was built in 1621 and has a wing dated 1636. The entrance side was altered in the 18th century.

The town expanded in the 1990s with the addition of the large new estate Latchbrook, and again with the more recent building of another housing area, Pillmere. In the summer of 2009, the Saltash postcode area was judged as the most desirable place to live in Great Britain in a survey that included statistics from school results and crime figures.

== History ==
===Toponymy===
The Charter of Incorporation refers to the place as &#x27;Essa&#x27; (Latin for &#x27;Ash&#x27;). However, the spelling of the town has changed over the years. For example, in Edward the Confessor&#x27;s time, it was called and spelt &#x27;Aysche&#x27;. In the 1584 Charter, it is stated that &quot;Essa is now commonly called Saltash&quot;. A family called Essa lived in the twelfth century at their property near Ashtor Rock, where the Manor Courts were once held. The &#x27;Salt&#x27; part of the name was added to distinguish it from other places called Ash.

===Early history===

Roger de Valletort (Reginald de Valle Torta) sold out in 1270 to Richard, Earl of Cornwall and King of the Romans while Edward, the Black Prince, became the first Duke of Cornwall, and a visitor to Trematon Castle.

In 1549 there was a Cornish insurrection against the introduction of the Protestant liturgy, and the rebels under Humphrey Arundell, for which he was beheaded at Tyburn, gained possession of Trematon Castle by treachery, capturing Sir Richard Grenville, the elder, in the process. They then carried out acts of barbarity on their surprised visitors.

The arms of Saltash are Az. the base water proper in pale an escutcheon Or thereon a lion rampant Gu. within a bordure Sa. bezantee ensigned with a prince&#x27;s coronet of the third on either side of the escutcheon an ostrich feather Arg. labelled Or. There are seals of Saltash: A three-masted ship with sails furled at anchor; and An escutcheon charges with a lion rampant within a bordure bezantee resting upon water surmounted by a coronet composed on crosses patee and fleurs-de-lis and either side an ostrich feather; with the legends &quot;Sigillum aquate Saltash&quot; and &quot;Sigillum Saltashe&quot; respectively. Saltash Guildhall was built in about 1780 and extended and restored in 1925.

===Saltash Ferry===
The history of Saltash is linked to the &quot;passage&quot;, or ferrying place across the Tamar. The original ferry became established by fishermen for those passing to and from the monastery at St Germans and to Trematon Castle.

After the Norman Conquest, Robert, Count of Mortain, who held the castle and manor at Trematon, took the market from the canons at St. Germans and established it at Saltash. The Count granted Trematon and other manors to the de Valletorts, who had then to provide for the ferry boat. In the twelfth century a borough was founded (1190), and Saltash became the only franchised seaport between Dartmouth and Fowey. This fact has given rise to the Saltash saying, &quot;Saltash was a borough town, when Plymouth was a fuzzy down&quot; (&#x27;fuzzy&#x27; = &#x27;fursy&#x27; i.e. covered in gorse), as the town of Plymouth and its seaport did not exist in 1190. In medieval times the ferry was part of the manor of Trematon, held by the Valletorts.

===Antony Passage Ferry===

The Antony Passage Ferry, which is mentioned in documents as early as 1324, was situated within the St Stephens suburb of Saltash civil parish.
The ferry belonged to the Daunay family in the 14th Century, in 1450 it passed to the Carew family, and by the end of the 18th century it was taken over by the Crosley family, who operated the ferry for several generations until it fell into disuse in the early 1950s. The route linked Jupiter Point (part of the Antony Estate), Antony Passage and Passage Point (both part of Saltash).

Officially the Antony Passage Ferry is still in existence since, as a public ferry, an Act of Parliament would be necessary to terminate it, and it still appears on Ordnance Survey maps.

===Parish churches===
The parish church of Saltash was, until 1881, St Stephen&#x27;s by Saltash, one mile from the town. Though of earlier foundation, the structure of the building is largely the 15th century: there are two aisles and the tower is west of the north aisle. The font is Norman.

This church was probably founded in Norman times by the lords of Trematon Castle. Like the castle it belonged later to the Earls and Dukes of Cornwall; in 1351 King Edward III appropriated it to the Deanery of Windsor so that the benefice became a vicarage. In medieval times there was a chapel at Saltash and private chapels at Shillingham ((1318), Trehan ((1332), Earth (1413) and Trevalward (1395). The chapel at Saltash was dedicated to Saint Nicholas and Saint Faith and became the parish church of the town in 1881.

St. Nicholas &amp; St. Faith&#x27;s Church has an unbuttressed tower adjoining the former north transept which remains from the original Norman church. The blocked south door is Norman, as is; most of the masonry of the chancel, the nave, the south transept, and the west wall. A north chancel chapel was added in the 14th century. In the 15th century, a north aisle was added to the nave; the wagon roofs of the north aisle and the nave are of the same date. The font is probably Norman and is of an unusual vague shape. There is a monument to three naval officers, John and James Drew, and J. W. Drew, who were drowned in 1798 and 1799.

==Education==
Primary schools in Saltash include Burraton CP School, Bishop Cornish (V.A) Primary School, Brunel School (previously Longstone Infant School and Saltash Junior School) and St Stephens School.

The secondary school in Saltash was designated as a Science and Mathematics &amp; Computing Specialist College in September 2004, and renamed Saltash.net community school. The school is now known as Saltash Community School. Saltash.Net sought out links with Microsoft under the headship of Isobel Bryce and during her tenure, the school was rated as ‘good’ by OFTSED. In recent years, there has been a decline in the progress outcomes achieved by students at the school and, partially linked to this, OFSTED have judged the school to be ‘requires improvement. Whilst the school was rated as ‘requires improvement’ in 2019 and has recently (2022) been given the same rating, there is a new framework in place which is more challenging than that under which the school was previously judged. There is evidence within the report that school is moving in the right direction.

Cornwall College has a campus in Saltash.

==Media==
Local TV coverage is provided by BBC South West and ITV West Country. Television signals are received from the Caradon Hill TV transmitter. The town is served by both BBC Radio Cornwall on 95.2 FM and BBC Radio Devon on 95.7 FM. Other radio stations are Heart West on 97.0 FM, Greatest Hits Radio South West on 106.7 Fn, and Liskeard Radio, a community statio that broadcast online. Its local newspaper is the Cornish Times.

==Festivals==
Saltash hosts a number of annual festivals: Saltash Mayfair takes place in and around Fore Street during early May, and Saltash Town Regatta brings music and entertainment to the Waterside area in the summer. On the water there are intense Gig races with the best teams taking part, along with Flashboat rowing and dinghy racing, and the now infamous &#x27;England and back&#x27; race between local organisations. For 2008 a new five towns challenge has been added to the list of events, pitting Saltash against Liskeard, Callington, Looe and Torpoint. Ashore you will find many stalls, music, and marquees. See the Regatta and Mayfair websites listed below for more information.

==Health services==
The local cottage hospital (the Home of St Barnabas (convalescent) ) was provided by the Society of Saint Margaret, an Anglican sisterhood. More recently it has been part of the National Health Service and was operated by Peninsula Community Health for a number of years.
