<text>The Bad News Bears is a 1976 American sports comedy film directed by Michael Ritchie and written by Bill Lancaster. It stars Walter Matthau as an alcoholic ex-baseball pitcher who becomes a coach for a youth baseball team known as the Bears. The film&#x27;s cast includes Tatum O&#x27;Neal, Vic Morrow, Joyce Van Patten, Ben Piazza, Jackie Earle Haley, and Alfred W. Lutter. Its score, composed by Jerry Fielding, adapts the principal themes of Bizet&#x27;s opera &quot;Carmen&quot;.

Released by Paramount Pictures, &quot;The Bad News Bears&quot; received generally positive reviews. It was followed by two sequels, &quot;The Bad News Bears in Breaking Training&quot; in 1977 and &quot;The Bad News Bears Go to Japan&quot; in 1978, a short-lived 1979–80 CBS television series, and a 2005 remake.

==Plot==
In 1976, Morris Buttermaker, an alcoholic pool cleaner and former minor-league baseball pitcher, accepts a secretive cash payment from a lawyer to coach his son&#x27;s youth baseball league expansion team, the Bears. The team is made up of unskilled players, formed as a settlement to a lawsuit brought against the league for excluding such players from other teams. Shunned by the more competitive teams (and their competitive parents and coaches), the Bears are considered outsiders and the least talented team in the Southern California league.

Buttermaker makes little effort to help the boys improve, accomplishing nothing before their first game except for finding a sponsor to provide uniforms. He forfeits the opening game after the Bears allow 26 runs without recording an out.

With the entire team wanting to quit due to the humiliation of their first loss, Buttermaker begins to take his coaching more seriously, teaching basics like hitting, fielding and sliding. In addition, he recruits two unlikely prospects: sharp-tongued Amanda Whurlitzer, the 11-year-old daughter of Buttermaker&#x27;s former girlfriend and a skilled pitcher (trained by Buttermaker when she was younger); and the local cigarette-smoking, loan-sharking, Harley-Davidson-riding troublemaker Kelly Leak, who is also the best athlete in the area but has been excluded from playing in the past due to his juvenile delinquency. With Amanda and Kelly on board, the team gains confidence and they begin to win. The strained past relationship between Buttermaker and Amanda is revealed as the team improves.

Eventually, the Bears make it to the championship game opposite the top-notch Yankees, who are coached by aggressive, competitive Roy Turner. As the game progresses, tensions rise between the teams and the coaches, as Buttermaker and Turner engage in ruthless behavior toward each other and the players in their fervor to win the game. But when Turner strikes his son Joey, the pitcher, for ignoring his orders and intentionally throwing at the batter&#x27;s head, Joey retaliates by holding on to a comebacker until the Bears runner scores, then walks off the field.

Buttermaker realizes that he, too, has placed too much emphasis on winning, and puts in his bench-warmers to allow everyone to play. The Bears lose in the end, but despite Buttermaker&#x27;s move, they nearly win the game. After the trophy award ceremony, Buttermaker gives the team beer, which they spray on each other in a celebration as if they had won, telling the Yankees &quot;where [they] can put their championship trophy&quot;.

==Cast==

Top-billed, shown in the opening credits, are Matthau, O&#x27;Neal and Morrow.

===Adults===
* Walter Matthau as Morris Buttermaker, coach of the Bears: A drunken, loud, ex-professional baseball pitcher and part-time pool cleaner, who drives a rundown green Cadillac convertible.
* Vic Morrow as Roy Turner, coach of the Yankees, who is competitive and aggressive.
* Joyce Van Patten as Cleveland, league manager, who favors Roy and the Yankees.
* Ben Piazza as Bob Whitewood, city councilman and lawyer who sued the league to allow the Bears (in particular, his son) to play, and who convinces (and pays) Buttermaker to coach the team.
* Shari Summers as Mrs. Turner, wife of Roy Turner, coach of the Yankees, and supportive mother of Joey Turner.

===Children===
* Tatum O&#x27;Neal as Amanda Whurlitzer, the 11-year-old star pitcher for the Bears who feels insecure about her tomboy image. She is recruited by Buttermaker to help the team start winning. She is no-nonsense and a great pitcher who was taught by Buttermaker when she was young. The boys grow to be very protective of her, picking a fight with their rivals during the championship game when Amanda is kicked in the chest. Her mother is Buttermaker&#x27;s ex-girlfriend, and Amanda looks to him as a father figure. Amanda and Tanner often butt heads but respect each other. She also has a secret crush on Kelly.
* Chris Barnes as Tanner Boyle, the short-tempered shortstop with a Napoleon complex; after suffering a horrible loss in their first game, he picks a fight with the entire seventh grade from the boys&#x27; middle school (and loses). He tends to curse more than the others, and initially insults and bullies Timmy before realizing that he is treating Timmy no better than the kids from their rival team. He becomes protective of Timmy, leading to an unlikely friendship between them. He is also close friends with Ahmad.
* Jackie Earle Haley as Kelly Leak, the local troublemaker who smokes and rides a mini Harley-Davidson motorcycle. Kelly is also the best athlete in the neighborhood. At first, he does not want to join the team when Amanda attempts to recruit him, but he changes his mind when Coach Turner threatens him. He alternates between left and center field, and has a crush on Amanda. After joining the team, he forms close friendships with Tanner, Ahmad and Ogilvie.
* Erin Blunt as Ahmad Abdul-Rahim, who plays in the outfield, is liked by everyone on the team and adores Hank Aaron; Ahmad strips off his uniform in shame after committing several errors in the Bears&#x27; first game, but is convinced to return to the team by Buttermaker, and is often used for bunts due to his speed. He is shown to be close friends with Tanner, and often has to pull Tanner away from fights.
* Gary Lee Cavagnaro as Mike Engelberg, an overweight boy who plays catcher; a great hitter, he frequently teases Tanner about his size. He breaks Buttermaker&#x27;s windshield with a baseball at the first practice. He has a deep rivalry with Yankee pitcher Joey, causing them to throw insults at each other.
* Alfred W. Lutter as Alfred Ogilvie, a bookworm who memorizes baseball statistics. He is mostly a bench-warmer who assists Buttermaker with defensive strategy. A backup outfielder and first baseman, but reluctant to play because he feels that he is one of the lesser-skilled players on the team.
* David Stambaugh as Toby Whitewood, an unassuming boy who plays first base. He knows about the other players&#x27; personalities, is intelligent and well-spoken, and occasionally speaks on behalf of the team. He is the son of councilman Bob Whitewood, who secretly paid Buttermaker to coach the team.
* Quinn Smith as Timmy Lupus, initially described by Tanner as a &quot;booger-eating spaz&quot;, plays right field and is considered to be the worst player on the team—if not the entire league—but he surprises everyone in the championship game by making a key play to keep the Bears in the game. He is the most quiet and shy player, but shows the ability to prepare a martini for Coach Buttermaker while the team is assisting him with cleaning pools.
* Jaime Escobedo as Jose Aguilar, Miguel&#x27;s older brother who plays second base and does not speak English.
* George Gonzales as Miguel Aguilar, Jose&#x27;s younger brother who plays mostly right field and does not speak English. He is so short that the strike zone is practically nonexistent.
* David Pollock as Rudi Stein, a nervous relief pitcher with glasses who is a terrible hitter. At times, he is asked by Coach Buttermaker to purposely get hit by pitches to get on base. He is also a backup outfielder.
* Brett Marx as Jimmy Feldman, a fairly quiet third baseman with curly blond hair.
* Scott Firestone as Regi Tower, a fairly quiet, red-headed infielder whose father vocally attends practices and games. He plays first base.
* Brandon Cruz as Joey Turner, the star pitcher for the Yankees and coach Roy Turner&#x27;s son. He has a rivalry with Engelberg and regularly bullies Tanner and Timmy. He nearly beans Engelberg, which results in his father slapping him. In response, Joey holds a ground ball that Engelberg hits to him, allowing an inside-the-park home run. He drops the ball at his father’s feet and quits the team.

==Production==
&quot;The Bad News Bears&quot; was filmed in and around Los Angeles, primarily in the San Fernando Valley. The field where they played is in Mason Park on Mason Avenue in Chatsworth. In the film, the Bears were sponsored by an actual local company, &quot;Chico&#x27;s Bail Bonds&quot;. One scene was filmed in the council chamber at Los Angeles City Hall.

Walter Matthau was paid $750,000 plus over 10% of the theatrical rentals. Tatum O&#x27;Neal was paid $350,000 plus a percentage of the profits. These were later estimated to be $1.9 million.

== Reception==
Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a score of 97%, based on reviews from 35 critics, and an average rating of 7.8/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;&quot;The Bad News Bears&quot; is rude, profane, and cynical, but shot through with honest, unforced humor, and held together by a deft, understated performance from Walter Matthau.&quot;

In his 1976 review, critic Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film three stars out of four, and called it &quot;an unblinking, scathing look at competition in American society&quot;.

Gene Siskel of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; awarded two-and-a-half stars out of four, calling the film&#x27;s characters &quot;more types than people&quot; and the kids&#x27; foul-mouth dialogue &quot;overdone&quot;, although he found O&#x27;Neal&#x27;s performance &quot;genuinely affecting&quot;.

&quot;Variety&quot; called it &quot;the funniest adult-child comedy film since &quot;Paper Moon&quot;&quot;, and lauded the &quot;excellent&quot; script.

Kevin Thomas of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; declared it &quot;the best American screen comedy of the year to date&quot;, adding, &quot;Bright, pugnacious and utterly realistic as most children seem to be today, these kids are drawn with much accuracy and are played beautifully.&quot;

Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; found the film only &quot;occasionally funny&quot;, but praised screenwriter Bill Lancaster for &quot;the talent and discipline to tell the story of &quot;The Bad News Bears&quot; almost completely in terms of what happens on the baseball diamond or in the dugout&quot;.

Gary Arnold of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; praised it as &quot;a lively, spontaneously funny entertainment&quot; that &quot;could rally a large parallel audience seeking less innocuous and stereotyped pictures with and about children&quot;.

Tom Milne of &quot;The Monthly Film Bulletin&quot; called it &quot;miraculously funny and entirely delightful&quot;.

It’s so funny. It’s so sweet. It’s sweet and, yet, it’s completely wrong. It’s just so wrong on so many levels. — Tatum O&#x27;Neal&lt;ref name=&quot;shermanreport/tatum&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Awards ===
Walter Matthau was nominated for the BAFTA Award for Best Actor. The screenplay by Bill Lancaster, son of actor Burt Lancaster, was awarded &quot;Best Comedy Written Directly for the Screen&quot; by the Writers Guild of America.

<text>Earl of Listowel (pronounced &quot;Lish-&quot;toe&quot;-ell&quot;) is a title in the Peerage of Ireland. It was created in 1822 for William Hare, 1st Viscount Ennismore and Listowel, who had earlier represented Cork City and Athy in the Irish House of Commons.

He had already been created Baron Ennismore, of Ennismore in the County of Kerry, in 1800, and Viscount Ennismore and Listowel, in 1816, also in the Peerage of Ireland. His grandson, the second Earl, represented Kerry and St Albans in the British House of Commons. He was succeeded by his eldest son, the third Earl. In 1869 he was created Baron Hare, of Convamore in the County of Cork, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom, which gave him an automatic seat in the House of Lords. Lord Listowel later held minor office in the second administration of William Ewart Gladstone. His grandson, the fifth Earl, was a Labour politician and notably served as the last Secretary of State for India and Burma.

 the titles are held by the latter&#x27;s eldest son, the sixth Earl, who succeeded in 1997. Lord Listowel is one of the ninety elected hereditary peers that remain in the House of Lords after the passing of the House of Lords Act 1999, and sits as a cross-bencher.

Another member of the family was the Conservative politician the 1st Viscount Blakenham (1911–1982). He was the third son of the fourth Earl.

Listowel is a town in the north of County Kerry in the south-west of Ireland. The family seat was formerly Convamore House, near Ballyhooly in County Cork.

<text>Spencer Gifts LLC, doing business as Spencer&#x27;s, is a North American mall retailer with over 600 stores in the United States and Canada. Its stores specialize in novelty and gag gifts, and also sell clothing, brand merchandise, sex toys, room decor, collectible figures, fashion and body jewelry, and fantasy and horror items. The company also owns and operates a pop-up seasonal retailer, Spirit Halloween.

==History==
Spencer Gifts was founded in 1947 in Easton, Pennsylvania by Max Spencer Adler (1897–1979) as a mail-order catalog which sold an assortment of novelty merchandise. The company moved all mail order and fulfillment operations to Atlantic City, NJ. In 1960, Max&#x27;s brother, Harry, who had been with the company since 1947, sold his shares to his brother and left the company.

In 1963, Spencer Gifts opened its first retail store in the Cherry Hill Mall in Cherry Hill, New Jersey, where it operates to this day.

After opening approximately 450 stores under the name Spencer Gifts, Adler sold Spencer Gifts to entertainment conglomerate MCA in 1967. In 2003, Spencer&#x27;s Gifts was completely rebranded after being put under new management, and with the change become known only as just Spencer&#x27;s.

In 1990, Spencer Gifts closed its mail-order catalog division.

In 1993 and 1996, respectively, Spencer Gifts acquired the DAPY line of stores and opened its first GLOW! store. The DAPY and GLOW! trademarks were retired sometime before 2007. Around 2021, both GLOW! and DAPY returned to business under a private entity, until July 2024 when GLOW! announced they would be closing down along with DAPY. 

In 1995, MCA was acquired by Seagram Company Ltd. and was renamed Universal Studios. Spencer Gifts began to operate Universal Studios stores as a subsidiary of its parent company.

In 1997, Spencer Gifts opened its first store in Canada.

In 1999, Spencer&#x27;s acquired Spirit Halloween, a seasonal retailer founded by Joseph Marver in 1983. At that time, the business had 60 temporary locations. Spirit&#x27;s stores are only open for the two months leading up to Halloween, though it maintains a website year-round. The stores are generally operated out of the spaces of recently vacated businesses. As of 2013, Spirit had over 1,000 locations, which comprised about half of Spencer&#x27;s annual revenue of $250 million.

In 2000, Spencer&#x27;s expanded into the United Kingdom. The chain opened up to 14 stores in the United Kingdom before closing them sometime in the mid-2000s.
In 2001, Vivendi acquired Universal Studios and rebranded the entire organization as Vivendi Universal Entertainment. Less than two years later, in 2003, GB Palladin, a joint venture between Gordon Brothers Group and Palladin Capital Group, acquired Spencer Gifts from Vivendi, around the same time Vivendi was preparing to sell the majority of its shares of Universal Studios to General Electric&#x27;s NBC division. As a result of the sale, Steven Silverstein became Spencer Gifts&#x27; CEO and also the CEO and president of Spirit Halloween.

In fall 2004, Spencer&#x27;s began redesigning its stores.

In 2006, Spencer&#x27;s began its &quot;Spirit of Children&quot; program, which raises donations through its Spirit Halloween stores and hosts Halloween parties in children&#x27;s hospitals in Canada and the United States. Since 2007, the program has raised over $110 million for over 130 children&#x27;s hospitals.

ACON Investments acquired the company in 2007 and sold it to Spencer&#x27;s management in 2015.

==Legal issues==
The company has been investigated by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) for its advertising practices.

In 1962, Spencer Gifts was found by the Federal Trade Commission to have violated the Federal Trade Commission Act by making misleading statements in advertising its &quot;Reduce-Eze&quot; girdles and ordered to cease making false claims. The girdles were advertised with statements such as &quot;Slim 4 Inches Without Diet&quot; and &quot;Trims 4 Inches Off Your Figure&quot;.

In 1969, Spencer Gifts was found by the FTC to, through the use of words like &quot;stone&quot;, &quot;birthstone&quot;, and &quot;gold&quot;, have misrepresented its jewelry products. As its jewelry did not contain any &quot;genuine precious or semiprecious stones&quot;, nor was its metal 24 karat gold, Spencer Gifts was ordered to stop use of deceptive statements in the promotion of its jewelry.

In 1970, Spencer Gifts was found by the FTC to have misled its customers as to the efficacy of its &quot;non-prescription magnifying spectacles&quot; by failing to disclose that correction of vision defects is limited to older persons who do not have any eye diseases, like astigmatism, but only need &quot;simple magnifying or reducing lenses&quot;. The FTC ordered the retailer to cease the use of advertisements that misrepresented the quality of its optical products.

==Controversies==
Spencer Gifts has come under fire for its merchandise, which has been considered to be sexually explicit and racist.

In 1989, the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee (ADC) mailed thousands of pamphlets to Arab-Americans across the United States to campaign against Spencer&#x27;s &#x27;sheik&#x27; and &#x27;Arafat&#x27; Halloween masks, which were marketed as part of its &quot;Fright Stuff&quot; line of products. The pamphlet featured a picture of the &#x27;sheik&#x27; mask and claimed that it &quot;was the only ethnic one in the product line and being marketed alongside traditional monster masks reinforced the notion Arab people are scary.&quot; Spencer Gifts pulled the two masks from its stores in October following a &quot;three-day protest and telephone campaign&quot; by the ADC, but decided later that month to place the masks back on sale, prompting the ADC to boycott and picket Spencer&#x27;s stores. In a letter to ADC spokesperson Faris Bouhafa, Spencer&#x27;s general counsel Ronald Mangel said that &quot;after re-reviewing the &#x27;Sheik&#x27; and &#x27;Arafat&#x27; masks and discussing the look of the masks with others&quot;, Spencer&#x27;s president John Hacala decided to reverse the earlier decision and place the masks back in stores. &quot;We will not reorder the masks for next year,&quot; the letter added.

Spencer Gifts has been criticized for allowing children access to adult toys and other explicit products. While adults-only products are ostensibly kept in areas off-limits to children, there have been several instances where that is not the case. In one instance, police seized adult materials from the Spencer Gifts in Rapid City, South Dakota as &quot;possible evidence for the national retailer&#x27;s failure to register as an adult-oriented business&quot;.

In February 2014, the Ancient Order of Hibernians, the largest Irish organization in the United States, called on Spencer&#x27;s to cease the sale of merchandise it felt propagated stereotypes about Irish Americans, such as a T-shirt with the slogan &quot;F*** me I&#x27;m Irish&quot; and a hat sporting the phrase &quot;Irish Girl Wasted&quot;. AOH National Anti-Defamation Chairman Neil Cosgrove protested, &quot;We note that Spencer&#x27;s Gifts is a recidivist when it comes to denigrating the heritage and culture of Irish Americans. Spencer&#x27;s St. Pat&#x27;s merchandise seems to plumb new lows with each year.&quot;

<text>Lord Napier, of Merchistoun, is a title in the Peerage of Scotland. It was created in 1627 for Sir Archibald Napier, 1st Baronet. Earlier that year, he already held the [[Napier baronets|Napier Baronetcy]], of Merchistoun in the County of Midlothian, created in the Baronetage of Nova Scotia. The titles remained united until 1683, when the Baronetcy became dormant. It was revived in the early 19th century and is now held by another branch of the Napier family. Between 1683 and 1686, the Lords of Napier also held the Nicolson Baronetcy, of Carnock in the County of Stirling, and since 1725 the Scott Baronetcy, of Thirlestane in the County of Selkirk, both baronetcies created in the Baronetage of Nova Scotia. The latter is still held today. Additionally, the tenth Lord was created Baron Ettrick, of Ettrick in the County of Selkirk in the Peerage of the United Kingdom on 16 July 1872.

Lord Napier is the hereditary Clan Chief of Clan Napier.

==History==
===Napier===

The earliest recorded mention of the name Napier in Scotland occurred in 1290, in a charter of Maol Choluim I, Earl of Lennox, granting lands at Kilmahew to the Napiers. They are said to have taken their name from a saying by King Alexander II of Scotland to one of the Earls of Lennox, after a battle, that Lennox had &quot;na peer&quot; (no equal).

Archibald Napier, son of John Napier, the inventor of logarithms, served as a Gentleman of the Bedchamber to King James VI of Scotland (I of England) and as a Lord of Session. On 2 March 1627 he was created a baronet, &quot;of Merchistoun in the County of Midlothian&quot;, in the Baronetage of Nova Scotia. A few months later he was raised to the Peerage of Scotland as Lord Napier, of Merchistoun. His grandson, the third Lord, obtained an extension of the patent with limitation to (1) his heirs female and their heirs male and female, and (2) failing which to his sisters and their heirs whatsoever, the female heir being obliged to assume the name and arms of Napier. On his death in 1683 the baronetcy became dormant (it was later revived, see the Napier Baronetcy of Merchistoun) while he was succeeded in the Lordship (according to the new patent) by his nephew Sir Thomas Nicolson, 4th Baronet, of Carnock, who became the 4th Lord Napier. He was the son of Sir Thomas Nicolson, 3rd Baronet, of Carnock by his wife the Hon. Jean Napier, eldest daughter of the second Lord Napier. The 4th Lord Napier died unmarried at an early age and was succeeded in the Baronetcy by his cousin and heir male (see the Baron Carnock for later history of this title) and in the Lordship by his aunt, the fifth Lady Napier, the wife of John Brisbane.

===Scott===

Lady Napier was succeeded by her grandson, the sixth Lord. He was the son of Sir William Scott, 2nd Baronet, of Thirlestane by his wife 
Elizabeth, Mistress of Napier. In 1725 he also succeeded his father as third Baronet of Thirlestane. (The Scott Baronetcy, of Thirlestane in the County of Selkirk, had been created in the Baronetage of Nova Scotia on 22 August 1666 for Francis Scott). The titles remain united. His grandson, the eighth Lord, sat in the House of Lords as a Scottish representative peer from 1796 to 1806 and from 1807 to 1823 and also served as Lord Lieutenant of Selkirkshire from 1819 to 1823. He was succeeded by his son, the ninth Lord. He was a Scottish Representative Peer from 1824 to 1832 and served as Ambassador to China in 1833. His son, the tenth Lord, was a prominent diplomat. In 1872 he was created Baron Ettrick, of Ettrick in the County of Selkirk, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. This peerage gave him and his descendants an automatic seat in the House of Lords until the passing of the House of Lords Act 1999. the titles are held by his great-great-great-grandson, the fifteenth Lord, who succeeded his father in 2012. He is styled &quot;Lord Napier and Ettrick&quot;.

<text>Earl of Normanton is a title in the Peerage of Ireland. It was created in 1806 for Charles Agar, 1st Viscount Somerton, Archbishop of Dublin. He had already been created Baron Somerton, of Somerton in the County of Kilkenny, in 1795 and Viscount Somerton, of Somerton in the County of Kilkenny, in 1800, also in the Peerage of Ireland. Lord Normanton sat in the House of Lords from 1800 to 1809 as one of the 28 original Irish representative peer.

His grandson, the third Earl, represented Wilton in Parliament from 1841 to 1852. In 1873, he was created Baron Somerton, of Somerley in the County of Southampton, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. This peerage gave the Earls a seat in the House of Lords. , the titles are held by the third Earl&#x27;s great-great-grandson, the seventh Earl, who succeeded his father in that year.

The first Earl of Normanton was the younger brother of James Agar, 1st Viscount Clifden and the nephew of the politician Welbore Ellis. The latter was in 1794 created [[Baron Mendip]], of Mendip in the County of Somerset with remainder to his nephews Lord Clifden, the future Lord Normanton and a younger brother. On Lord Mendip&#x27;s death in 1802, the barony passed according to the special remainder to his great-nephew the second Viscount Clifden. The titles remained united until 1974, when the Viscountcy of Clifden became extinct. However, the barony of Mendip survived, and was inherited by the sixth Earl of Normanton, who became the ninth Baron Mendip as well.

The family seat is Somerley House, near Ringwood, Hampshire.

<doc id="464148" wikidata="Q376768" url="?curid=464148" title="Adrien Arcand">
<text>Adrien Arcand (October 3, 1899 – August 1, 1967) was a Canadian fascist politician, writer, and journalist. He founded and led the far-right National Unity Party of Canada from 1934 until his death in 1967. During his political career, he proclaimed himself as the &quot;Canadian Führer&quot;.

Arcand was detained by the federal government for the duration of the World War II under the Defence of Canada Regulations.

==Early years==
Arcand was the son of Narcisse-Joseph-Philias Arcand, who was a carpenter and trade union official, and Marie-Anne (Mathieu). He is also the great uncle of the movie director, Denys Arcand. Arcand was born into a family of 12 children and grew up in a house on Laurier street in Montreal. Narcisse Arcand was active in the Labour Party that advocated free education, old age pensions, health insurance and universal suffrage. The appeal of the Labour Party in Quebec was resisted by the Catholic Church, which was powerful at the time in Quebec, as priests instructed their congregations not to vote for the Labour Party. Though the Labour Party stated it was open to all, the party&#x27;s rules explicitly banned Asians from joining, and the party&#x27;s policies advocated the &quot;absolute prohibition of Chinese immigration&quot; to Canada, as Asians were considered as economic competitors of the Caucasian working class. Although the number of Chinese immigrants to Quebec was small—- the 1901 census showed there were 1,648,898 people living in Quebec of whom only 1,037 were Chinese immigrants—- their presence was sufficient to cause the formation of an &quot;Anti-Yellow Peril League&quot; many of whose members were also members of the Labour Party. Narcisse Arcand was very active in lobbying against Asian immigration, testifying in 1909 before the Royal Commission on Education, as long as Asian immigration continued, it would be impossible for the white working class to advance economically. From advocating a ban of Asian immigration to advocating a ban of all immigration was not a great difference, and soon Arcand was arguing for the cessation of all immigration. Arcand&#x27;s son inherited his father&#x27;s belief that immigration was a threat. However, Montreal at the time had a large English-speaking minority, and Adrien Arcand recalled later that he &quot;was raised in an atmosphere not conducive to separatist and Anglophobic sentiments&quot; as he knew many English-speakers as he was growing up and came to speak English fluently.

Though Narcisse Arcand was often at odds with the Catholic Church, all of his children were educated in Catholic schools (Quebec did not have a public education system until 1964 and all schools prior to 1964 were managed by churches). Adrien Arcand was educated at the College de St. Jean d&#x27;Iberville, Collège Saint-Stanislas and Collège de Montréal in Montreal. He received the standard 8-year &quot;collège classique&quot; education emphasizing French, Latin, Greek, religion, mathematics, classic literature, and French history. Arcand considered studying to be a priest, but changed his mind as &quot;weakness&quot; made a life of celibacy unappealing to him. The Collège de Montréal was managed by the Sulpician monks, who had been active in Quebec since the 17th century, and most of the Sulpicians at the college were from France. Many Quebecois thought of themselves at the time as the last remnant of the Catholic &quot;ancien-regime&quot; France that had been ended by the French Revolution, and Arcand&#x27;s education at the Catholic schools emphasised royalist and Catholic values. The Sulpicians from France tended to be hostile to French republicanism and many had relocated to Quebec, a society dominated by the Catholic Church, because it was considerably closer to their idealized version of &quot;ancien-régime&quot; France than the French Third Republic was.

== Journalism and rise to prominence ==
By Arcand&#x27;s own account, his education by the Sulpicians at the Collège de Montréal was &quot;decisive&quot; in shaping his opinions. In 1918, he studied science as a part-time student at McGill University, but the great &quot;Spanish influenza&quot; pandemic of 1918–1919 resulted in the closure of public places after the disease arrived during October 1918 including all theaters, cinemas, concert halls, libraries, schools, meeting halls and hockey arenas in Montreal. During the closures, Arcand wrote to help ease his boredom. Several articles he submitted to newspapers were published, beginning his interest in journalism. In 1919, he was hired by the newspaper &quot;La Patrie&quot; and in 1920 he began to write a weekly column dealing with labour issues. In 1921, he began work for the &quot;Montreal Star&quot;, reporting the news in English. After that he began work for &quot;La Presse&quot;, the largest newspaper in Quebec. A keen amateur violin player, Arcand worked as a music critic for &quot;La Presse&quot;. As Montreal was the largest and wealthiest city in Canada at the time, many famous musicians such as Ignacy Paderewski often played at concerts in Montreal, and Arcand was there to interview him.

In addition to Paderewski, Arcand&#x27;s work as a reporter for &quot;La Presse&quot; allowed him to interview many famous people during the 1920s when they visited Montreal such as the Canadian prime minister William Lyon Mackenzie King, Anna Pavlova, Vincent d&#x27;Indy, Vladimir de Pachmann, Alfred Cortot, Feodor Chaliapin, Cécile Sorel, Jascha Heifetz, Isadora Duncan, Mario Chamlee, Queen Marie of Romania, Jacques Thibaud, Stanley Baldwin, Fritz Kreisler, Douglas Fairbanks, Maurice de Féraudy, Tom Mix, Mary Pickford, Efrem Zimbalist and Lord Birkenhead. In 1923, he joined a militia unit named the Châteauguay Regiment (whose traditions are continued by the 4th Battalion of the Royal 22nd Regiment). On 14 April 1925, he married Yvonne Giguère. During the late 1920s, he became active in organizing for Catholic trade unions and became president of the first union local at &quot;La Presse&quot;. His trade unionism caused him to be dismissed in 1929. Arcand later recalled that his dismissal came as &quot;a surprise, cruel and hard, with the result that my wife and my young babies suffered the effects of painful, abject poverty&quot;. For a time, the water and electricity to his home was terminated due to his inability to pay the bills. Arcand&#x27;s dismissal gave a lifelong grudge against his former employer, Pamphile Réal Du Tremblay, and caused him to found a new newspaper, &quot;Le Goglu&quot;, in August 1929. His sudden transition from the respectable lower middle-class to poverty radicalized him.

Arcand was assisted in founding &quot;Le Goglu&quot; by a printer, Joseph Ménard, who wanted to begin his own newspaper. In &quot;joual&quot; (Quebec French), &quot;goglu&quot; is slang for someone who is jovial and who loves to laugh, and &quot;Le Goglu&quot; belonged to a type of satirical newspaper that was popular in Quebec at the time. &quot;Le Goglu&quot; was an eight-page-long broadsheet full of cartoons that mocked various prominent people, for instance, showing Mackenzie King as a clueless ape staring vacantly into space. The newspaper was based in a lower class part of Montreal, described by Arcand as an area &quot;where are found Chinese gambling dens, Negro shacks, Greeks, cutthroat Slavs, Bulgarian ruffians, Oriental grocers, nauseating Palestinian restaurants, European ex-convict scum, diamond importers from Chicago, and dives of every kind, where officers of the Canadian militia will get it on for 50 cents&quot;. The major target of &quot;Le Goglu&quot;&#x27;s humour was what Arcand termed &quot;the clique that is stifling the province&quot;, by which he mainly meant his former employer, du Tremblay, whom he was relentless in attacking as an exploitative boss and a hypocrite who failed to practice the Catholic social teachings in which he professed to believe. &quot;Le Goglu&quot; was a successful newspaper, and by 1929 for the Christmas special edition, Arcand could afford to print his paper in colour for 12 pages. The cartoons that mocked the ministers of the cabinet of Premier Louis-Alexandre Taschereau as corrupt resulted in several libel suits, which increased the paper&#x27;s circulation.

The major advertisers for &quot;Le Goglu&quot; were at first the famous Bronfman family of Montreal who published advertisements promoting their brands of alcohol, but ceased their advertising after &quot;Le Goglu&quot; began publishing anti-Semitic statements. In August 1929, Arcand started publishing in &quot;Le Goglu&quot; a serialization of a novel he was writing, &quot;Popeline&quot;, chronicling the story of the eponymous heroine, an 18-year-old beauty &quot;who had drunk long and deep from the cup of woe which gave her a heady feminine aura&quot;. &quot;Popeline&quot; was notable as one of the first novels written in the &quot;joual&quot; (local vernacular French), instead of Parisian French which had been the standard in Quebec until then. During November 1929, Arcand initiated his own political philosophy, the &quot;Ordre Patriotique des Goglus&quot; for the &quot;general purification, on preserving our Latin character, our customs and our habits, on protecting our rights and our privileges&quot;. In December 1929, Arcand began a companion newspaper for &quot;Le Goglu&quot;, the Sunday weekly &quot;Le Miroir&quot;, which was more serious. In March 1930, Arcand initiated a third newspaper &quot;Le Chameau&quot; that soon failed during 1931 as it was unprofitable. He published and edited several newspapers during this period, most notably &quot;Le Goglu&quot;, &quot;Le Miroir&quot;, &quot;Le Chameau&quot;, &quot;Le Patriote&quot;, &quot;Le Fasciste Canadien&quot; and &quot;Le Combat National&quot;.

==Political life==
Until 1963, there was not any public school system in Quebec but rather two religious school systems, one operated by the Catholic Church and the other by the Protestant churches. Since the late 19th century, as an uncomfortable arrangement, Jewish children had been educated by the Protestant school system. During late 1929, the Taschereau government agreed to establish a separate Jewish school system in Montreal, an agreement that caused an intense reaction by the Catholic Church, which was stoutly opposed to Jewish schools, generating so much popular opposition that by 1931 Taschereau abandoned the plan. Arcand used the pages of &quot;Le Goglu&quot; to attack the plans for Jewish schools, and in May 1930 he published his antisemitic editorial, &quot;Why Semitism Is a Danger&quot;. This was followed up by several antisemitic editorials during the spring and summer of 1930 such as &quot;How Does Semitism Advance?&quot;, &quot;The Word of God and the Jews&quot;, and &quot;Semitism: Persecuted and Persecutor&quot;. By the summer of 1930, &quot;Le Goglu&quot; had been transformed from a populist, humorous newspaper into a largely antisemitic journal. Arcand credited much of his antisemitism to be a result of reading the pamphlet &quot;The Jewish World Problem&quot; by Lord Sydenham of Combe.

Arcand shared the idea widely accepted in French-Canada that the Confederation of 1867 was a &quot;pact&quot; between two &quot;nations&quot; that agreed to work together for their common betterment. Arcand argued that Canada existed only for the &quot;two founding nations&quot; and to accept the claim by any other group to &quot;nationhood&quot; would by necessity reduce the living standards of the &quot;two founding nations&quot;. In this manner, Arcand argued that &quot;to recognize the Jewish race as an official entity would violate the Confederation pact, eliminate our rights, and force us to officially recognize as national entities all the other groups, such as Polish, Greek, Syrian, Russian, Serbian, German who may request it later&quot;. Arcand&#x27;s antisemitism was motivated at least partly by the fact that the majority of &quot;Ashkenazim&quot; (Yiddish-speaking Jews) immigrants from Eastern Europe usually arrived in Montreal, where a great many chose to settle. Arcand saw the Jews as economic competitors, contrasting his idealized, rural French-Canadian Catholic small grocer who was honest and hard-working with the stereotype of the greedy and unscrupulous big city Jewish immigrant capitalist who only succeeded because of &quot;his dishonesty, not his skill or ability&quot;.

Like many other French-Canadian intellectuals at the time, Arcand had considerable hatred for &quot;godless&quot; France, considered as having abandoned Roman Catholicism, leaving Quebec as the last remnant of the &quot;true&quot; France that ended in 1789. Arcand also profoundly disliked the egalitarianism of French republicanism, writing with disgust how Josephine Baker, the &quot;richest and most famous Negress&quot; in France, became a millionaire &quot;after showing her derrière at the Folies Bérgères&quot;. For Arcand, it was unacceptable for someone like Baker to become rich at a time when Caucasians were suffering from the Great Depression, which for him represented a distorted social order.

In May 1930, Arcand met with the millionaire Conservative leader R. B. Bennett to ask him for his financial assistance in exchange for which Arcand would campaign against the Liberals in the coming election. French-Canadians tended to vote as a bloc for the Liberals at the time, and the fact that the Liberals usually won the majority of the seats in Quebec gave them an advantage in elections. The perception that the Conservatives, identified as the party of &quot;imperialism&quot; (i.e. advocacy for the British empire), were anti-French and anti-Catholic made it difficult for the Conservatives to win seats in Quebec since the late 19th century. The fact that the Liberal politician William Lyon Mackenzie King was a protege of Sir Wilfrid Laurier and had campaigned as an anti-conscription Liberal in the 1917 election gave him the reputation as a friend of Quebec despite the fact that he did not speak French. In a letter to Bennett dated 22 May 1930, Arcand asked for some $15,000 in exchange for which he would manage what he called a &quot;smear campaign&quot; against Mackenzie King, a request that Bennett agreed to.

Arcand received covert funds from the Conservative Party to operate his newspapers and campaign for Bennett in the 1930 federal election. In an editorial in &quot;Le Goglu&quot;, Arcand referred to Mackenzie King and Premier Taschereau &quot;two notorious stinkers&quot;. In another editorial, Arcand referred to Mackenzie King as &quot;the enemy of the people&quot;. The main theme of Arcand&#x27;s attacks was that Mackenzie King was a man who did not care about the suffering caused by the Great Depression, and criticizing King&#x27;s well-known &quot;continentalism&quot; (i.e. establishing a better relationship with the United States), Arcand described him as a friend of American billionaires. In the election of 28 July 1930, the Conservatives won a majority of 134 seats, 24 of which were in Quebec. Given that the Conservatives had much difficulty winning seats in French-Canada, the 24 seats won in Quebec were an impressive achievement and Arcand was quick to take the credit in his letters to Bennett, arguing that the Conservatives would not have won any seats in Quebec as they usually did without him.

Relations became increasingly bad afterwards as Bennett had little use for Arcand after the election. Despite demands from Arcand and his followers to get more money to compensate for their expenses, the subsidy they received from the Tories was sporadic and insufficient. In October 1932, Arcand first made contact with the German Nazi Party when its representative, Kurt Lüdecke, visited Montreal, and told Arcand that the two philosophies had much in common and should cooperate. In his report to Adolf Hitler about his visit, Lüdecke described Arcand as a &quot;man of lively intelligence&quot; whose philosophy was becoming increasingly popular and whom was very close to Prime Minister Bennett. Arcand promised to schedule a meeting between Lüdecke and Bennett, and though he did send a letter to Bennett requesting that he meet Lüdecke, the proposed meeting never occurred.

Arcand was always a staunch federalist and an anglophile. He received secret funds from Lord Sydenham of Combe, former governor of Bombay and a prominent fascist sympathizer in the British Conservative Party after he translated into French Sydenham&#x27;s pamphlet &quot;The Jewish World Problem&quot;. He also maintained correspondence with Arnold Spencer Leese, chief of the Imperial Fascist League. Arcand was influenced most strongly by British fascism as he maintained an active correspondence with various British fascists such as Lord Sydenham, Henry Hamilton Beamish and Admiral Sir Barry Domvile. With the idea of forming a fascist leadership for the British empire, Arcand started a correspondence that continued until his death with Sir Oswald Mosley, the leader of the British Union of Fascists (BUF). Many of the articles that appeared in &quot;Le Fasciste Canadien&quot; were translations of articles from &quot;Action&quot; and &quot;Blackshirt&quot;, the two journals of the BUF.

In 1934, Arcand established the Parti National Social Chrétien (Christian National Social Party), which advocated anti-communism and the banishment of Canadian Jews to the Hudson Bay area. The latter idea was inspired by his friend, noted British Rhodesian fascist Henry Hamilton Beamish, who suggested sending Jews to Madagascar. In 1935 the desperate Bennett ministry again turned to Arcand, who was appointed at the urging of Senator Rainville to the post of Tory publicity director in Quebec. However, many of Arcand&#x27;s friends were more sympathetic to the Reconstruction Party, so &quot;Le Patriote&quot; supported H. H. Stevens while its editor was campaigning for Bennett. Bennett secretly hired Arcand as his chief electoral organizer in Quebec for the 1935 federal election.

In November 1936, Arcand was returning from a rally when he got into a car accident. Arcand was survived without any serious injuries, but a fellow fascist accompanying him, 25-year-old Émile Vallée, was killed. Arcand had been serving as a mentor to Vallée. A group of Canadian fascists in their uniforms attended his funeral.

In 1938, Arcand was chosen as the director of the fascist National Unity Party of Canada, resulting from the fusion of his Parti National Social Chrétien with the Prairie provinces&#x27; Canadian Nationalist Party led by William Whittaker and the CNP&#x27;s Ontario wing, led by Joseph Farr, which had grown out of the Toronto Swastika Clubs of the early 1930s.

Arcand&#x27;s party statutes advocated the following oath to be taken at the beginning of every party meeting:
Arcand was always opposed to Quebec nationalism. He wanted to build a powerful centralized Canadian Fascist state within the British Empire.

On May 30, 1940, he was arrested in Montreal for &quot;plotting to overthrow the state&quot; and interned for the duration of the war as a security threat. His party, then termed the National Unity Party, was banned. In the internment camp, he sat on a throne built by other prisoners and spoke of how he would rule Canada when Hitler conquered it. Arcand was released from custody on July 5, 1945.

Arcand would later argue that he was interned on the orders of the Canadian Jewish Congress.

==After the war==
Arcand campaigned for the House of Commons of Canada on two occasions. Despite being shunned by mainstream Quebecers during the post-war years, he managed to come second with 29 percent of the vote when he campaigned as a National Unity candidate in the riding of Richelieu—Verchères in the 1949 federal election. He came second again with 39 percent of the vote when he campaigned as a &quot;Nationalist&quot; in Berthier—Maskinongé—Delanaudière in the 1953 election.

On 2 February 1952, the British fascist Peter Huxley-Blythe wrote to Arcand asking for permission to publish in German his anti-Semitic pamphlet &quot;La Clé du mystère&quot;, writing: &quot;I&#x27;m anxious to obtain two hundred (200) copies of your excellent work, &quot;The Key to the Mystery&quot; as soon as possible to fulfill an order I have received from Germany&quot;. Permission was granted, and on 27 February 1952 he wrote to Arcand for permission to print 300 more copies of &quot;La Clé du mystère&quot; for sale in Great Britain. In 1957, he campaigned for Progressive Conservative candidate and future Quebec cabinet minister Remi Paul.

Arcand never wavered in his endorsement of Adolf Hitler, and, during the 1960s, was a mentor to Ernst Zündel, who became a prominent Holocaust denier and neo-Nazi propagandist during the latter part of the 20th century. Arcand often corresponded with Issa Nakhleh, a Palestinian Christian who served as the chief of the Palestine Arab Delegation.

On November 14, 1965, he gave a speech before a crowd of 650 partisans from all over Canada at the Centre Paul-Sauvé in Montreal which was draped in the blue banners and insignia of the National Unity Party. As reported in &quot;La Presse&quot; and &quot;Le Devoir&quot;, he took the occasion to thank the newly elected Liberal Member of Parliament for Mount Royal, Pierre Trudeau, and former Conservative politician George Drew, for speaking in his defence when he was interned. However, Trudeau and Drew denied that they had ever defended Arcand or his opinions, and insisted that they had in fact been defending the principle of free speech even for fascists.&quot;Among the rare bits of support Arcand received was an astonishing one from a young law student in London. This young man was Pierre Elliott Trudeau. From the British capital on February 4, 1948, he wrote a rich and dense article of the type that would soon contribute to his renown in a new magazine called Cite Libre. In its issue of February 14, 1948, Notre Temps gave a prominent place to the item by this young contributor who protested against the use of the War Measures Act. Of course, he could not have been aware that he would apply this same law himself in October 1970.&quot;Among those present at the rally were Jean Jodoin, a Progressive Conservative candidate in the 1965 federal election and Gilles Caouette, future Social Credit Party of Canada Member of Parliament.

==Views==
In an interview with David Martin published in &quot;The Nation&quot;, Arcand said his party stood for “God, family, private property and personal initiative…. We believe that the Jews are responsible for all the evils of the world today. Through the two Internationals that they control, the proletarian and the financial, they provoke economic crises and revolutions with a view to taking world power.” He stated that once the National Unity Party won an election, it would ban all other political parties and claim liberalism was &quot;an instrument of world Jewry&quot;. When asked whether he intended to kill the Jews off, he said he would &quot;send them to Madagascar&quot; and joked he was “The greatest Zionist in
the world!”

<doc id="464150" wikidata="Q7205721" url="?curid=464150" title="Pluvial lake">
<text>A pluvial lake is a body of water that accumulated in a basin because of a greater moisture availability resulting from changes in temperature and/or precipitation. These intervals of greater moisture availability are not always contemporaneous with glacial periods. Pluvial lakes are typically closed lakes that occupied endorheic basins. Pluvial lakes that have since evaporated and dried out may also be referred to as &quot;paleolakes&quot;. 

==Etymology==
The word comes from the Latin &quot;pluvia&quot;, which means &quot;rain&quot;.

==Geology==
Pluvial lakes represent changes in the hydrological cycle: wet cycles generate large lakes, and dry cycles cause the lakes to recede. Accumulated sediments show the variation in water level. During glacial periods, when the lake level is fairly high, mud sediments will settle out and be deposited. At times in between glaciers (interglacial), salt deposits may be present because of the arid climate and the evaporation of lakewater.

Several pluvial lakes formed in what is now the southwestern United States during the glaciation of the late Pleistocene. One of these was Lake Bonneville in western Utah, which covered roughly . When Lake Bonneville was at its maximum water level, it was higher than the Great Salt Lake.

Fresh water mollusks have been found in mud deposits from Searles Lake in California and suggest that the water temperature was about 7 degrees Fahrenheit (or 4 degrees Celsius) cooler than current temperatures. Radiocarbon dating of the youngest mud beds yield dates from 24,000 to 12,000 years ago.

==Formation==
When warm air from arid regions meets chilled air from glaciers, cloudy, cool, rainy weather is created beyond the terminus of the glacier. That humid climate was present during the last glacial period in North America and caused more precipitation than evaporation. The increase in rainfall fills the drainage basin and forms a lake.

During interglacial periods, the climate becomes arid once more and causes the lakes to evaporate and dry up.

<text>Earl of Norbury, in the County of Tipperary, is a title in the Peerage of Ireland. It was created in 1827, along with the title Viscount Glandine, of Glandine in the King&#x27;s County, for the Irish politician and judge John Toler, 1st Baron Norbury, upon his retirement as Chief Justice of the Common Pleas in Ireland. The titles were created with special remainder to his second son, Hector, as his eldest son, Daniel, was then considered mentally unwell. Lord Norbury had already been created Baron Norbury, of Ballycrenode in the County of Tipperary, in the Peerage of Ireland in 1800, with remainder to the heirs male of his body. Moreover, his wife, Grace Toler (née Graham), had been created Baroness Norwood, of Knockalton in the County of Tipperary, in the Peerage of Ireland in 1797, with remainder to the heirs male of her body. By the time Lord Norbury was raised to the Earldom, his wife had died and their eldest son had succeeded her as 2nd Baron Norwood. This son also succeeded Lord Norbury himself on his death in 1831 as 2nd Baron Norbury, whilst his younger brother Daniel succeeded to the viscountcy and earldom according to the special remainder. In 1832, the second Earl also succeeded his elder brother in the two baronies. He had already in 1825 assumed the additional surname of Graham by Royal licence. He was shot &quot;by an assassin, in his own plantation&quot; at Durrow Abbey, County Offaly in 1839.

<text>Leonard Kleinrock (born June 13, 1934) is an American computer scientist and Internet pioneer. He is Distinguished Professor Emeritus of Computer Science at UCLA&#x27;s Henry Samueli School of Engineering and Applied Science. Kleinrock made several important contributions to the field of computer science, in particular to the mathematical foundations of data communication in computer networking. He has received numerous prestigious awards.

In the early 1960s, Kleinrock pioneered the application of queueing theory to model delays in message switching networks in his Ph.D. thesis, published as a book in 1964. In the late 1960s and 1970s, he played an influential role in the development of the ARPANET. In the 1970s, he applied queueing theory to model and measure the performance of packet switching networks and published several of the standard works on the subject. He supervised graduate students who worked on the communication protocols for the ARPANET including students whose later work on internetworking and the Internet protocol suite led to the networking technology employed in the Internet. His theoretical work on hierarchical routing in the late 1970s with student Farouk Kamoun remains critical to the operation of the Internet today.

==Education and career==
Leonard Kleinrock was born in New York City on June 13, 1934, to a Jewish family, and graduated from the noted Bronx High School of Science in 1951. He received a Bachelor of Electrical Engineering degree in 1957 from the City College of New York, and a master&#x27;s degree and a doctorate (Ph.D.) in electrical engineering and computer science from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in 1959 and 1963 respectively. He then joined the faculty at the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA), where he remains to the present day; during 1991–1995 he served as the chairman of the Computer Science Department there.

==Achievements==

=== Queueing theory ===
Kleinrock&#x27;s best-known and most-significant work is on queueing theory, a major topic of applied mathematics that has applications in many fields. His thesis proposal in 1961, &quot;Information Flow in Large Communication Nets&quot;, led to a doctoral thesis at MIT in 1962, &quot;Message Delay in Communication Nets with Storage&quot;, later published as book in 1964, &quot;Communication Nets: Stochastic Message Flow and Delay&quot;. In this work, he researched the configuration and operation of communication networks, considering design parameters such as &quot;channel capacity, effect of priority discipline, choice of routing procedure, and design of topological structure&quot;. He analyzed delays in Plan 55-A, a message switching system operated by Western Union for processing telegrams. His thesis went on to apply probability theory to model queueing delays in a generalized communication network. 

Donald Davies, in his 1966 paper on packet switching, applied Kleinorck&#x27;s techniques to show that &quot;there is an ample margin between the estimated performance of the [packet-switched] system and the stated requirement&quot; in terms of a satisfactory response time for a human user. This addressed a key question about the viability of computer networking.

===ARPANET===
A contemporary from MIT, Larry Roberts, brought Leonard Kleinrock into the ARPANET project informally in early 1967. Roberts asked Frank Westervelt to explore the questions of message size and contents for the network, and to write a position paper on the intercomputer communication protocol including “conventions for character and block transmission, error checking and retransmission, and computer and user identification.&quot; Later that year, Roberts learned about packet switching from a paper written by Davies, presented at the October 1967 Symposium on Operating Systems Principles, and incorporated the concept into the proposal for the ARPANET. 

Kleinrock was awarded a contract in 1968 to establish a Network Measurement Center (NMC) to measure and model the performance of the network. His mathematical work studied and influenced the development of the early ARPANET. In addition, Kleinrock managed the software team at UCLA — including Steve Crocker, Jon Postel, and Vint Cerf — who developed the host-host protocol for the ARPANET, the Network Control Program (NCP).

The first message on the ARPANET was sent by a UCLA undergraduate student, Charley Kline, who was supervised by Kleinrock. At 10:30 p.m, on October 29, 1969, from Boelter Hall 3420, the school&#x27;s main engineering building, Kline transmitted from the university&#x27;s SDS Sigma 7 host computer to the Stanford Research Institute&#x27;s SDS 940 host computer. The message text was the word &quot;login&quot;; the &quot;l&quot; and the &quot;o&quot; letters were transmitted, but the system then crashed. Hence, the literal first message over the ARPANET was &quot;lo&quot;. About an hour later, having recovered from the crash, the SDS Sigma 7 computer effected a full &quot;login&quot;. The first permanent ARPANET link was established on November 21, 1969, between the Interface Message Processor (IMP) at UCLA and the IMP at the Stanford Research Institute. By December 5, 1969, the initial four-node network was established.

Kleinrock used the ARPANET for instant messaging from the U.S. to Larry Roberts in England in 1973, employing the network for a modern every-day use.

=== Internet ===
Kleinrock published hundreds of research papers, which ultimately launched a new field of research on the theory and application of queueing theory to computer networks. In this role, he supervised the research of scores of graduate students. He disseminated his research and that of his students to wider audiences for academic and commercial use, and organized hundreds of commercial seminars presented by experts and pioneers in the U.S. and internationally. Many graduate students that Kleinrock supported based their careers on expertise they acquired while working on the ARPANET with him, including several whose later work on internetworking and the Internet protocol suite led to the networking technology employed in the Internet. Kleinrock&#x27;s work published in the mid-1970s on the performance of the ARPANET, which was discussed at the International Network Working Group, underpinned the development of the Transmission Control Protocol of the Internet protocol suite. His analytic work in the 1970s addressed packet switching networks, packet radio networks, local area networks, broadband networks, nomadic computing, peer-to-peer networks, and intelligent software agents. Kleinrock&#x27;s theoretical work on hierarchical routing with student Farouk Kamoun remains critical to the operation of the Internet today.

In 1988, Kleinrock was the chairman of a group that presented the report &quot;Toward a National Research Network&quot; to the U.S. Congress, concluding that &quot;There is a clear and urgent need for a national research network&quot;. Although the U.S. did not build a nationwide national research and education network, this report influenced Al Gore to pursue the development of the High Performance Computing Act of 1991, which helped facilitate development of the Internet as it is known today. Funding from the bill was used in the development of the 1993 web browser Mosaic at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA), which accelerated the adoption of the World Wide Web.

=== Packet switching &#x27;paternity dispute&#x27; ===
In 1990, Kleinrock said:The thing that really drove my own research was the idea of a message switching network, which was a precursor to the packet switching networks. The mathematical tool that had been developed in queueing theory, namely queueing networks, matched perfectly the model of computer networks. Actually, it didn&#x27;t match perfectly and I had to adjust that model to fit the realities of computer networks. Then I developed some design procedures as well for optimal capacity assignment, routing procedures and topology design. 
Beginning in the mid-1990s, Kleinrock sought to be recognized &quot;as the father of modern data networking&quot;. By 1997, he claimed priority on the invention of packet switching and to have convinced Larry Roberts to adopt the technique. In 2004, he described his work as:Basically, what I did for my PhD research in 1961-1962 was to establish a mathematical theory of packet networks which uncovered the underlying principles that drives today&#x27;s Internet.

However, Kleinrock&#x27;s claims that his work in the early 1960s originated the concept of packet switching and that his work was a source of the packet switching concepts used in the ARPANET are disputed by other Internet pioneers, including Robert Taylor, Paul Baran, and Donald Davies. Historians and the U.S. National Inventors Hall of Fame recognize Baran and Davies for independently inventing the concept of digital packet switching used in modern computer networking including the Internet.

==Awards and recognition==

Kleinrock made several important contributions to the field of computer science, in particular to the mathematical foundations of data communication in computer networking. He has received numerous professional awards. In 1980, he was elected a member of the National Academy of Engineering for pioneering contributions to the field and leadership as an educator in computer communications networks. In 2001 he received the Draper Prize &quot;for the development of the Internet&quot;. Kleinrock was selected to receive the prestigious National Medal of Science, the nation&#x27;s highest scientific honor, from President George W. Bush in the White House on September 29, 2008. &quot;The 2007 National Medal of Science to Leonard Kleinrock for his fundamental contributions to the mathematical theory of modern data networks, and for the functional specification of packet switching, which is the foundation of Internet technology. His mentoring of generations of students has led to the commercialization of technologies that have transformed the world.&quot;

In 2010 he shared the Dan David Prize. UCLA Room 3420 at Boelter Hall was restored to its condition of 1969 and converted into the Kleinrock Internet Heritage Site and Archive. It opened to the public with a grand opening attended by Internet pioneers on October 29, 2011.

He was elected as a member into the National Academy of Engineering. In 2012, Kleinrock was inducted into the Internet Hall of Fame by the Internet Society. Leonard Kleinrock was inducted into IEEE-Eta Kappa Nu (IEEE-ΗΚΝ) in 2011 as an Eminent Member. The designation of Eminent Member is the organization&#x27;s highest membership grade and is conferred upon those select few whose outstanding technical attainments and contributions through leadership in the fields of electrical and computer engineering have significantly benefited society. He was elected to the 2002 class of Fellows of the Institute for Operations Research and the Management Sciences. In September 2014, Leonard Kleinrock was awarded the ACM SIGMOBILE Outstanding Contribution Award at MobiCom 2014.

Leonard Kleinrock was given the 2014 BBVA Foundation Frontiers of Knowledge Award &quot;for his seminal contributions to the theory and practical development of the Internet,&quot; in the words of the jury&#x27;s citation.

In 2014, a special edition of &quot;Computer Networks&quot; was published in his honor. Articles were written in recognition of Kleinrock&#x27;s contributions to queueing theory, packet switching, computer communication networks and the development of the Internet and related network technologies.

<text>In mathematics, antiholomorphic functions (also called antianalytic functions) are a family of functions closely related to but distinct from holomorphic functions.

A function of the complex variable formula_1 defined on an open set in the complex plane is said to be antiholomorphic if its derivative with respect to formula_2 exists in the neighbourhood of each and every point in that set, where formula_2 is the complex conjugate of formula_1. 

A definition of antiholomorphic function follows: &quot;[a] function formula_5 of one or more complex variables formula_6 [is said to be anti-holomorphic if (and only if) it] is the complex conjugate of a holomorphic function formula_7.&quot;

One can show that if formula_8 is a holomorphic function on an open set formula_9, then formula_10 is an antiholomorphic function on formula_11, where formula_11 is the reflection of formula_9 across the real axis; in other words, formula_11 is the set of complex conjugates of elements of formula_9. Moreover, any antiholomorphic function can be obtained in this manner from a holomorphic function. This implies that a function is antiholomorphic if and only if it can be expanded in a power series in formula_2 in a neighborhood of each point in its domain. Also, a function formula_8 is antiholomorphic on an open set formula_9 if and only if the function formula_19 is holomorphic on formula_9.

If a function is both holomorphic and antiholomorphic, then it is constant on any connected component of its domain.

<doc id="464186" wikidata="Q4299" url="?curid=464186" title="Coheed and Cambria">
<text>Coheed and Cambria is an American progressive rock band from Nyack, New York, formed in 1995. It consists of Claudio Sanchez (vocals, guitars, keyboards), Travis Stever (guitars, vocals), Josh Eppard (drums, keyboards, backing vocals), and Zach Cooper (bass, backing vocals). The group&#x27;s music incorporates aspects of progressive rock, pop, heavy metal, and post-hardcore.

All of Coheed and Cambria&#x27;s albums except for 2015&#x27;s &quot;The Color Before the Sun&quot; are concept albums based on a science fiction storyline called &quot;The Amory Wars&quot;, a series written by Claudio Sanchez, which has been transcribed into a series of comic books as well as a full-length novel. The band has released ten studio albums, three live albums, and several special-edition releases. Six of their albums have reached the Billboard Top 10. The band&#x27;s tenth studio album, &quot;Vaxis – Act II: A Window of the Waking Mind&quot;, was released in 2022.

==History==

===Formation and Shabütie (1995–2001)===
In March 1995, after the split of Claudio Sanchez and Travis Stever&#x27;s band called Toxic Parents, they formed a band with Nate Kelley called Beautiful Loser. The band featured Stever on vocals and guitar, Sanchez on guitar, Kelley on drums and Jon Carleo on bass. The group was short-lived, breaking up by June 1995 after an argument over gas money. Stever left the band, and the resulting trio was named Shabütie, a word taken from African tribe chants that means &quot;naked prey&quot; in the film &quot;The Naked Prey&quot;.

The band spent nearly a year experimenting with a multitude of different musical styles, including punk rock, indie rock, acoustic rock, funk, and heavy metal. When Carleo left the band in August 1996, Kelley recruited Michael Todd to take his place. Todd, who was primarily a guitarist, picked up the bass specifically for Shabütie. As Shabütie, the band wrote dozens of songs and released their first studio demo &quot;Plan to Take Over the World&quot; in 1999. The band also released &quot;The Penelope EP&quot; in 1999, shortly after which Stever rejoined the band.

Kelley left the band during a performance in late 1999. Josh Eppard (then the drummer of his brother Joey Eppard&#x27;s band 3) replaced him. The band went on to release &quot;Delirium Trigger&quot; in 2000, still featuring Kelley on the drums, but listing Eppard in the liner notes.

===&quot;The Amory Wars&quot;, &quot;The Second Stage Turbine Blade&quot;, and &quot;In Keeping Secrets of Silent Earth: 3&quot; (2001–2004)===

Several songs that appeared on &quot;Delirium Trigger&quot; were adapted into a series of science fiction comics written by Claudio Sanchez called &quot;The Bag.On.Line Adventures&quot;, which was later renamed &quot;The Amory Wars&quot;. Sanchez&#x27;s side project originally developed during a 1998 trip to Paris, where the band members decided to rename themselves Coheed and Cambria, named after two of the story&#x27;s protagonists, and adopted the concept story as a theme that would unify their future albums. This side project also created Coheed&#x27;s official logo, the Keywork, a symbol for the planetary alignment of the Amory Wars universe.

In February 2002 the band released its first studio album &quot;The Second Stage Turbine Blade&quot; after signing with Equal Vision Records. Influenced by the post-hardcore group At The Drive In, the band&#x27;s first release also featured a guest appearance from Dr. Know of the hardcore-punk band Bad Brains as well as the revised &quot;Delirium Trigger&quot;, &quot;33&quot;, and &quot;Junesong Provision&quot; from the &quot;Delirium Trigger&quot; EP. The band also released its first single and music video, &quot;Devil in Jersey City&quot;. The band eventually played several tour dates in the United States and Japan, as well as a brief stint on the 2002 Vans Warped Tour. In August 2002, Coheed and Cambria started working with manager Blaze James.

Following extensive touring with groups Breaking Pangaea, Linkin Park, The Used, and Slipknot, in October 2003 the band released its second studio album &quot;In Keeping Secrets of Silent Earth: 3&quot;, also on Equal Vision Records. Featuring the singles &quot;A Favor House Atlantic&quot; and &quot;Blood Red Summer&quot; and corresponding videos which received airtime on MTV, the band supplemented the release by touring with various artists such as Thursday, Thrice, AFI, and Rainer Maria. Coheed and Cambria also made its second appearance on the Warped Tour and performed additional European shows. The album peaked at No. 52 on the Billboard charts and was certified Gold by the RIAA.

===&quot;Good Apollo, I&#x27;m Burning Star IV&quot; (2004–2006)===

The band also supported the release by filming an August 2004 concert at New Jersey&#x27;s Starland Ballroom. The performance was converted into the band&#x27;s first live DVD, &quot;Live at the Starland Ballroom&quot;, which was released in March 2005.

The success of &quot;In Keeping Secrets of Silent Earth: 3&quot; attracted the attention of the record label Columbia Records, with whom they signed a multi-album contract. The band stopped touring to record their third studio album and first major-label release &quot;Good Apollo, I&#x27;m Burning Star IV, Volume One: From Fear Through the Eyes of Madness&quot; in early 2005 for a September 2005 release.

Their most commercially successful album to date, &quot;Good Apollo Volume One&quot; has sold almost 1 million copies and peaked at No. 7 on the Billboard charts. The album represented a departure from their previous melodic post-hardcore influenced rock toward a progressive rock sound. The single &quot;Welcome Home&quot; was described by John A. Hanson as &quot;a heavily Led Zeppelin-influenced metal tune&quot;. The band supported the album with American and European tours accompanied by The Blood Brothers, Circa Survive, Dredg, Head Automatica, and Avenged Sevenfold, tours culminating in the release of the exclusive iTunes EP &quot;Kerrang!/XFM UK Acoustic Sessions&quot; and their second live DVD &quot;The Last Supper: Live at Hammerstein Ballroom&quot;.

===Departures and &quot;No World for Tomorrow&quot; (2006–2009)===

Claudio Sanchez released an album from his side-project The Prize Fighter Inferno in October 2006 titled &quot;My Brother&#x27;s Blood Machine&quot;. Like Coheed and Cambria&#x27;s albums, it was a concept album, related to Coheed and Cambria via a character that appears in both stories: Jesse, &quot;The Prize Fighter Inferno&quot;. The album was intended to be a prequel to the Coheed and Cambria albums. Claudio says &quot;when we were called Shabütie, the initial idea for Coheed and Cambria was to be an acoustic/electronic side project. So I guess The Prize Fighter Inferno is kind of the original idea for Coheed and Cambria.&quot;

In early November 2006, Josh Eppard and Michael Todd left the band for personal reasons, forcing Matt Williams and the band&#x27;s drum technician, Michael Petrak, to fill out temporarily the band&#x27;s rhythm section for a handful of shows. In April 2007, bassist Michael Todd rejoined Coheed and Cambria, and the band entered the Los Angeles-based studio with new producer Nick Raskulinecz. The following June Chris Pennie, formerly of the Dillinger Escape Plan, joined Coheed and Cambria as its drummer, but due to contractual restrictions with his previous record label, Pennie did not appear on the band&#x27;s fourth release. Instead, Foo Fighters drummer Taylor Hawkins recorded the drums, making use of several ideas Pennie had previously written in correspondence with Sanchez.

The band&#x27;s fourth studio album, and second release with Columbia Records, &quot;Good Apollo, I&#x27;m Burning Star IV, Volume Two: No World for Tomorrow&quot;, was released in October 2007, debuting at number 6 on the Billboard charts. The album&#x27;s first single, &quot;The Running Free&quot;, was released to radio in August 2007. The second single was &quot;Feathers&quot; with a video starring Rena Riffel. The band continued touring, headlining portions of the 2007 Warped Tour, a tour supported by Clutch and The Fall of Troy, and opened for Linkin Park&#x27;s 25-city U.S. tour, which forced the cancellation of Coheed and Cambria&#x27;s performances on Australia&#x27;s Soundwave Festival. In addition to the return of Todd on bass and new drummer Pennie, the band also recruited a touring keyboardist and backup vocalists for its live performances.

In November 2007, their song &quot;Welcome Home&quot; was included as a playable track in the video game &quot;Rock Band&quot;, and a cover of their song &quot;Ten Speed (of God&#x27;s Blood &amp; Burial)&quot; was later made available as a download for Rock Band. In 2009 two more songs were made available for download, &quot;The Running Free&quot; and &quot;A Favor House Atlantic&quot;, for the video game Rock Band, later joined in 2010 by the songs &quot;Guns of Summer&quot;, &quot;Here We Are Juggernaut&quot; and &quot;The Broken&quot;.

The band prepared a four-month world tour beginning in January 2008. They later headlined at The Bamboozle 2008 music festival.

The band headlined the 2008 Kerrang! Tour in the U.K., where the band performed and recorded a cover of &quot;The Trooper&quot; by Iron Maiden, which is featured on Kerrang!&#x27;s Iron Maiden tribute album, &quot;Maiden Heaven&quot;, that came with the July 16 issue. They were nominated for Best International Band and Best Music Video (for &quot;Feathers&quot;) in the 2008 Kerrang! Awards.

In October and November 2008, the band played Neverender, a four-night concert series in which the band played one album per night. The event was held in New York City, Chicago, Los Angeles, and in London in early December. &quot;&quot;, a CD/DVD box set of their Neverender performance, was released on March 24, 2009.

===&quot;Year of the Black Rainbow&quot; (2009–2011)===

Coheed and Cambria toured through most of early 2009. Between January and March, they toured with Slipknot and Trivium on the Slipknot-headlined All Hope Is Gone tour. In August 2009, Coheed and Cambria toured in support of Heaven &amp; Hell on their tour in support of &quot;The Devil You Know&quot;. On September 16, 2009, they performed at the Puyallup Fair alongside Brand New and Jaguar Love. In October they performed at the Austin City Limits Music Festival in Austin, Texas. They also performed at the Wacken Open Air festival, at the UK leg of the Sonisphere Festival tour, and at the Lollapalooza festival in Chicago.

Coheed and Cambria finished recording their fifth studio album &quot;Year of the Black Rainbow&quot; in 2009. It is a prequel to their conceptual story, having events that take place before &quot;The Second Stage Turbine Blade&quot;. A novel was released to accompany the album co-written by Sanchez and Peter David. The album was released on April 13, 2010, in both a standard, iTunes special, and deluxe edition (with the deluxe edition including the &quot;Year of the Black Rainbow&quot; novel and a special Year of the Black Rainbow &quot;black card&quot; that provided the holder early access to some Coheed shows. The concept of a special card with this privilege would carry over into future album releases). In 2010 the band played the UK rock festival Download, alongside A Day to Remember and Bullet for my Valentine.

&quot;The Broken&quot;, &quot;Guns of Summer&quot; and &quot;Here We Are Juggernaut&quot; were released on the Rock Band music store on April 20, 2010.

Sanchez stated that with the Coheed and Cambria saga completely chronicled on the group&#x27;s first five albums, he was contemplating the direction of future releases. &quot;I&#x27;ve thought of telling stories of the future and stories of the past, maybe getting involved more in the story of Sirius Amory (sic – Sirius Amory in the stories), the fellow who figured out the value of the Keywork,&quot; he said. &quot;Or even stories that kind of parallel the one that we’re telling. It’s kind of up in the air. I’ve started writing music for that next record, and I&#x27;m kind of hoping that maybe in doing that it&#x27;s going to tell me which one to do.”

On July 10, 2011, bassist Michael Todd was arrested and taken into police custody in Attleboro, Massachusetts, on charges of armed robbery. Wes Styles acted as a temporary replacement for the remaining dates. On August 4, 2011, Todd and the band parted ways by mutual decision.

The band recorded a cover of the ZZ Top song &quot;Beer Drinkers &amp; Hell Raisers&quot; for the tribute album &quot;A Tribute from Friends&quot;, and the song &quot;Deranged&quot; was released on the soundtrack for the video game &quot;&quot; on October 18, 2011.

=== Line-up change and &quot;The Afterman&quot; (2011–2014) ===
Claudio announced at New York Comic Con in &quot;Radio.com&quot; in October 2011 that the upcoming album was written and that the recordings would begin in November. He also confirmed that the band were continuing to write music following the Amory Wars storyline, and hinted that fans would be surprised by which character was followed in the new album.

In November 2011, Chris Pennie departed the band by mutual agreement due to creative differences. Two weeks later, Pennie was replaced by the band&#x27;s former drummer Josh Eppard, and the following April the band announced via social media that their replacement bassist would be Zach Cooper, previously of the band AM to AM. According to an interview with Cooper, Coheed manager Blaze James &quot;cold-called&quot; Cooper to audition for the bass position, based upon a personal recommendation.

In June, the band completed the recording of their sixth studio album at Applehead Studios. The following month, Coheed announced via their website that the upcoming album would be a double album called &quot;The Afterman.&quot; The first part, titled &quot;The Afterman: Ascension&quot;, was released on October 9, 2012, and the second, titled &quot;The Afterman: Descension&quot;, was released on February 5, 2013. It was produced by Coheed and Cambria, with Michael Birnbaum and Chris Bittner. &#x27;The Afterman&#x27; tells the story of Sirius Amory, the namesake of the concept, as he explores the energy source holding together the Keywork (the 78 worlds in which &quot;The Amory Wars&quot; is set) and finds that it is in fact an afterlife for departed souls. In the same month, Claudio announced at San Diego Comic-Con that &quot;Entourage&quot; producers Mark Wahlberg and Stephen Levinson would be developing his comic book series &quot;The Amory Wars&quot; into a full-length live action film. In September 2019, Sanchez revealed that Wahlberg&#x27;s agreement to produce the project had expired.

On August 28, 2012, the band released the music video for &quot;Key Entity Extraction I: Domino the Destitute&quot;, the first single from &quot;The Afterman: Ascension&quot;, on their Vevo channel, reaching over one million views. Two weeks before the album&#x27;s release, the band premiered the studio version of the title track &quot;The Afterman&quot; on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;. The second video from the album was later created for this track. In 2013, the band released videos for &quot;Dark Side of Me&quot; and &quot;Number City&quot;, from &quot;The Afterman: Descension&quot;.

On August 18, 2014, it was revealed on a Billboard.com article that Coheed and Cambria would be releasing a remastered version of &quot;In Keeping Secrets of Silent Earth: 3&quot; on October 21, including some interview questions about why they were releasing it, and premiering the remastered version of the single &quot;A Favor House Atlantic&quot; from that album.

On August 25, 2014, a video of Claudio playing a new song titled &quot;Atlas&quot; was uploaded to the band&#x27;s YouTube channel.

In September and October 2014, Coheed and Cambria went on tour with Thank You Scientist, playing &quot;In Keeping Secrets of Silent Earth: 3&quot; in its entirety in correspondence with its remastering. In February 2015, it was announced on BBC Radio 1 that the band would be performing &quot;In Keeping Secrets of Silent Earth: 3&quot; at Hevy Fest held at Port Lympne, Kent, England.

=== &quot;The Color Before the Sun&quot; (2015–2017) ===

In an interview with Claudio Sanchez, he stated that he hoped to take Coheed and Cambria into the studio during January 2015 for a spring or summer release.

The band&#x27;s eighth album, &quot;The Color Before the Sun&quot;, was released on October 16, 2015. It is the band&#x27;s first album not connected to &quot;The Amory Wars&quot; storyline. Instead, the album reflects on Sanchez&#x27;s recent events in his life, which includes moving from the country to the city, his child Atlas (of which a studio version of the song of the same name is found on the album), among others. The album&#x27;s first single, &quot;You Got Spirit, Kid&quot; was released on July 10, 2015. The second single, &quot;Here to Mars&quot;, was released on September 3, 2015.

The band embarked on an early 2016 U.S. tour with Glassjaw, I the Mighty, and Silver Snakes, and a late 2016 U.S. tour with Saves the Day and Polyphia.

On August 19, 2016, the band released a Deconstructed version of the album which includes demos of the tracks as well as live recordings.

=== &quot;Vaxis – Act I: The Unheavenly Creatures&quot; (2018–2020) ===
On February 20, 2018, the band announced a summer tour with Taking Back Sunday and The Story So Far.

It was announced on April 5, 2018, that the band had signed with Roadrunner Records, and released a teaser potentially for a new album set to release in 2018. The band decided to premiere a new song after a show at the Chameleon Club in Lancaster, PA on May 5, 2018. After videos of the song went viral among fans on YouTube the band decided to premiere the video for a new song, &quot;The Dark Sentencer&quot; along with the album&#x27;s &quot;Prologue&quot; (the album&#x27;s backstory), on May 31, 2018, against their promotional plan set forth by the new company they signed with, Roadrunner Records. On June 22, 2018, the band announced their new album, &quot;Vaxis – Act I: The Unheavenly Creatures&quot;, would be released October 5, 2018. It continues the &quot;Amory Wars&quot; storyline that the band&#x27;s first seven albums followed. The second song on the album, &quot;Unheavenly Creatures&quot;, was released on June 28. A third single, &quot;The Gutter&quot;, was released on August 16. A fourth, &quot;Old Flames&quot;, was released on September 27. A fifth, &quot;Love Protocol&quot;, made its debut on BBC Radio 1 on September 30.

The band embarked on an early 2019 tour with Maps &amp; Atlases. On February 12, 2019, the band announced The Unheavenly Skye Tour, co-headlined with Mastodon, and featuring special guests Every Time I Die.

On August 21, 2020, the band released &quot;Jessie&#x27;s Girl 2&quot;, a sequel to Rick Springfield&#x27;s 1981 song, &quot;Jessie&#x27;s Girl&quot;, featuring Springfield on the recording. The song will be released on both a red and blue 7&quot; vinyl on September 4. According to an article by &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, the band reportedly has considered releasing a whole album called &quot;Sequels&quot; entirely composed of sequels to other songs.

===&quot;Vaxis – Act II: A Window of the Waking Mind&quot; (2021–2024)===
In early 2021, the band announced a tour co-headlining with The Used. On July 21, 2021, they released the lead single, &quot;Shoulders&quot;, from their tenth studio album. The album continues the &quot;Amory Wars&quot; &quot;Vaxis&quot; saga from the previous album, though frontman Claudio Sanchez noted that parts of the story were still in flux, as some plot points felt insensitive in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, such as a song titled &quot;Hallelujah Quarantine&quot; written before the pandemic, centered around a &quot;celebration called The Quarantine. It’s almost like a cotillion where the young come to party and to decide their fates. But this organization is really just taking these young kids to use them as blood banks.&quot; On November 10, 2021, the band released their new album&#x27;s second single, &quot;Rise, Naianasha (Cut the Cord)&quot;. In December 2021, the band announced The Great Destroyer Tour with Sheer Mag, to take place in February and March 2022. In January 2022, the band announced the title and track listing of their tenth album: &quot;Vaxis – Act II: A Window of the Waking Mind&quot;, which released on June 24, 2022, to critical acclaim. A third single, &quot;The Liars Club&quot;, was released on February 22, 2022. The next day, the band announced the A Window of the Waking Mind Tour with Dance Gavin Dance and Mothica. A fourth single, &quot;Comatose&quot;, was released on May 18, 2022, and the band added European tour dates with Thrice and Touché Amoré. Due to sexual assault allegations against Dance Gavin Dance singer Tilian Pearson and his departure from the band, Alkaline Trio replaced Dance Gavin Dance on the A Window of the Waking Mind tour. On January 24, 2023, the band announced the Neverender: No World for the Waking Mind Tour with Deafheaven. On February 6, 2024, the band announced a tour supporting Incubus, and on February 20, they announced a co-headlining tour with Primus. On May 8, 2024, the band released a new song, &quot;The Joke&quot;, a track cut from &quot;Vaxis – Act II&quot;.

===&quot;Vaxis – Act III: The Father of Make Believe&quot; (2024–present)===
On July 12, 2024, the band premiered a new song, &quot;Blind Side Sonny&quot;, on tour. They released a music video for the song on October 2, 2024. On November 20, the band revealed the title of their eleventh studio album, &quot;Vaxis – Act III: The Father of Make Believe&quot;, the full tracklisting, and second single, &quot;Searching for Tomorrow&quot;, along with a release date of March 14, 2025. On December 9, 2024, the band announced the Infinite Arc Tour with Mastodon and Periphery. On January 14, 2025, the band released the single &quot;Someone Who Can&quot; and announced a second leg to their 2025 tour with Taking Back Sunday and Foxing.

==Musical style and influences==

Sanchez has several times stated he is envious of his father&#x27;s era of music, and that the band is influenced by groups of that era, such as Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, The Police, Queen, and Thin Lizzy. Apart from these roots, Sanchez also acknowledges an eclectic array of influences, including post-hardcore group At the Drive-In, and heavy metal pioneers Iron Maiden. One of the biggest influences for Coheed and Cambria was alternative metal band Faith No More. Before establishing the band, Sanchez and Stever got hold of their 1992 record &quot;Angel Dust&quot;, that Stever claimed it &quot;showed [them] the light&quot;, and they would later listen to their next records &quot;King for a Day&quot; and &quot;Album of the Year&quot; continually as well. Stever also stated &quot;There are many more songs that we have done through the years that have had a guitar part or vocal melody that I will say, ‘Oh shit - there&#x27;s that Faith No More influence’.” Contrary to rumors, bassist Michael Todd said the band was not influenced by Saga and that he had never heard of that group. Many draw similarities between Rush and Coheed and Cambria, but Josh Eppard stated in an interview that neither he nor the other band members were &quot;big&quot; Rush fans. Claudio later stated he began to listen more critically to Rush&#x27;s albums after the comparisons. Influences of punk rock have been cited as well, especially the Misfits and Bad Brains. Dr. Know of Bad Brains plays a guitar solo on the track &quot;Time Consumer&quot; from Second Stage Turbine Blade. Sanchez and Stever&#x27;s early band Toxic Parents drew many similarities from Jane&#x27;s Addiction and Misfits. Sanchez has stated that &quot;The Amory Wars&quot;, the story on which Coheed and Cambria base its lyrics, has similarities to other stories, especially to the &quot;Star Wars&quot; trilogy. For example, when the character Coheed returns home to his wife Cambria, she says, &quot;Somehow I’ve always known,&quot; a line that Princess Leia said to Luke Skywalker in &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;.

===Genre===
The band&#x27;s style is described as progressive rock by Equal Vision, Spin, and AllMusic. Songs such as &quot;Blood Red Summer&quot; and &quot;Three Evils (Embodied in Love and Shadow)&quot; have been noted in many reviews of the band also to contain several elements of pop, as exemplified by one review by Sputnikmusic, which says &quot;Coheed and Cambria manage to bring new life to a dying genre, and mix up the standard pop-punk scheme with creative and original riffs.&quot; The band has also been described as alternative rock, new prog, progressive metal, emo, post-hardcore, and alternative metal.

<doc id="464189" wikidata="Q503343" url="?curid=464189" title="Westworld (film)">
<text>Westworld is a 1973 American science fiction Western film written and directed by Michael Crichton. The film follows guests visiting an interactive amusement park containing lifelike androids that unexpectedly begin to malfunction. The film stars Yul Brynner as an android in the amusement park, with Richard Benjamin and James Brolin as guests of the park.

The film was from an original screenplay by Crichton and was his first theatrical film as director, after one TV film. It was also the first feature film to use digital image processing to pixellate photography to simulate an android point of view. Critical reception was largely positive by contemporary and retrospective critics and &quot;Westworld&quot; was nominated for Hugo, Nebula, and Saturn awards.

&quot;Westworld&quot; was followed by a sequel, &quot;Futureworld&quot; (1976), and a short-lived television series, &quot;Beyond Westworld&quot; (1980). A television series based on the film debuted in 2016 on HBO.

==Plot==
In the near future, a highly realistic adult amusement park called Delos features three themed &quot;worlds&quot;: Western World (the American Old West), Medieval World (medieval Europe) and Roman World (the ancient city of Pompeii). The resort&#x27;s worlds are populated with lifelike androids that are practically indistinguishable from human beings, each programmed in character for their historical environment. For $1,000 per day, guests may indulge in any adventure with the android population of the park, including sexual encounters and simulated fights to the death.

Peter Martin, a first-time Delos visitor and his friend John Blane, on a repeat visit, go to Westworld. One of the attractions is the Gunslinger, an android programmed to instigate gunfights. The firearms issued to the park guests have temperature sensors that prevent them from shooting anything with a high body temperature, such as humans, but allow them to &quot;kill&quot; the cold-blooded androids. The Gunslinger&#x27;s programming allows guests to draw their guns and kill it, with the android always returning the next day for another duel.

The technicians running Delos notice problems are beginning to spread; the androids in Roman World and Medieval World begin experiencing various breakdowns and systemic failures, which may have also spread to Westworld.

After a night spent having sex with two android prostitutes, John is accosted by the same gunslinger Peter killed in the saloon the previous day. Peter bursts into the room and once again shoots the gunslinger dead. Peter is jailed awaiting trial, so John breaks him out and the two try to head out of town.

The malfunctions become more serious when a robotic rattlesnake bites John and against its program, a female android refuses a guest&#x27;s advances in Medieval World. The failures escalate until Medieval World&#x27;s Black Knight android kills a guest in a sword fight. The resort&#x27;s supervisors try to regain control by shutting down power to the park. The shutdown traps them in central control when the doors automatically lock, and they cannot turn the power back on to escape. The androids in all three worlds run amok, operating on reserve power.

Peter and John, recovering from a drunken bar-room brawl, wake up in Westworld&#x27;s brothel, unaware of the park&#x27;s breakdown. When the Gunslinger challenges the men to a showdown, John treats the confrontation as an amusement but the android shoots him dead. Peter runs for his life, and the android follows.

Peter flees to other areas of the park but finds only dead guests, damaged androids and a panicked technician attempting to escape Delos, who is soon killed by the Gunslinger. Peter climbs down through a manhole in Roman World into the underground control complex and discovers that the resort&#x27;s computer technicians suffocated in the control room when the ventilation system shut down. The Gunslinger stalks him through the underground corridors. While running away, Peter enters an android-repair laboratory. When the Gunslinger arrives there, Peter pretends to be an android lying on a table for repairs before throwing acid into the Gunslinger&#x27;s face. Peter flees, returning to the surface inside the Medieval World castle.

With its optical inputs damaged, the Gunslinger cannot track Peter visually and tries instead to find him using its infrared scanners. Peter stands beneath flaming torches and discovers that they mask his presence from the android. He sets it on fire with a torch and leaves the android to burn. Peter hears a call in a dungeon and finds a chained woman begging for help. He gives her water but this causes her to short-circuit and shut down, revealing her to be a robot. The burned shell of the Gunslinger attacks him once again before succumbing to its damage.

Peter then sits on the dungeon steps, exhausted and shocked, as the memory of Delos&#x27; marketing slogan resonates: &quot;Boy, have we got a vacation for you!&quot;

==Production==
===Development===
Michael Crichton had become nationally famous with his best selling novel, &quot;The Andromeda Strain&quot;, which had been turned into a 1971 movie. Crichton made his debut as director with the television film, &quot;Pursuit&quot;) (1972), based on one of his novels, and wanted to direct a feature. He did not want to necessarily make a science fiction film but &quot;That&#x27;s the only way I could get the studio to let me direct. People think I&#x27;m good at it I guess.&quot;

Crichton&#x27;s agent introduced him to producer Paul N. Lazarus III; they became friends and decided to make a film together. The script for &quot;Westworld&quot; was written in August 1972. Lazarus asked Crichton why he did not tell the story as a novel; Crichton said he felt the story was visual and would not really work as a book.

The script was offered to all the major studios. They all turned down the project except for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, then under head of production Dan Melnick and president James T. Aubrey. Crichton said

Crichton said pre-production was difficult. MGM demanded script changes up to the first day of shooting and the leads were not signed until 48 hours before shooting began. Crichton said he had no control over casting and MGM originally would only make the film for under a million dollars but later increased this amount by $250,000. Crichton said that $250,000 of the budget was paid to the cast, $400,000 to the crew, and the remainder on everything else (including $75,000 for sets).

===Principal photography===
The film was shot in 30 days. To save time, Crichton tried to shoot only what was needed, with minimal takes. &quot;Westworld&quot; was filmed in several locations, including the Mojave Desert, the gardens of the Harold Lloyd Estate, several MGM sound stages and on the MGM backlot, one of the final films to be shot there before the backlot was sold to real estate developers and demolished. It was filmed with Panavision anamorphic lenses by Gene Polito.

Richard Benjamin later said he loved making the film:

The Gunslinger&#x27;s appearance is based on Chris Adams, Brynner&#x27;s character from &quot;The Magnificent Seven&quot;. The two characters&#x27; costumes are nearly identical. According to Lazarus, Yul Brynner agreed to play the role for only $75,000 ($), because he needed the money.

Crichton later wrote that &quot;most of the situations in the film are cliches; they are incidents out of hundreds of old movies&quot;, so the scenes &quot;should be shot as clichés. This dictated a conventional treatment in the choice of lenses and the staging&quot;. The original script and original ending of the movie culminated in a fight between Martin and the Gunslinger, which resulted in the Gunslinger being torn apart by a rack. Crichton said he &quot;had liked the idea of a complex machine being destroyed by a simple machine&quot; but when attempting it, &quot;it seemed stagey and foolish&quot;, so the idea was dropped. He also wanted to open the film with shots of a hovercraft traveling over the desert but was unable to get the effect he wanted within a limited budget, so this was dropped as well.

===Score===
The score for &quot;Westworld&quot; was composed by American composer Fred Karlin. It combines ersatz western scoring, source cues, and electronic music.

===Post-production===
In the published screenplay, Crichton explained how he re-edited the first cut of the movie because he was depressed by how long and boring it was. Scenes that were deleted from the rough cut include a bank robbery and sales room sequences, an opening with a hovercraft flying above the desert, additional and longer dialogue scenes, more scenes with robots attacking and killing guests including a scene where one guest is tied down to a rack and is killed when his arms are pulled out, a longer chase scene with the Gunslinger chasing Peter and one where the Gunslinger cleans his face with water after Peter throws acid on him. Crichton&#x27;s assembly cut featured a different ending that included a fight between the Gunslinger and Peter and an alternate death scene in which the Gunslinger was killed on a rack. Once the film was completed on time, MGM authorized the shooting of some extra footage. A television commercial to open the film was added; because there was a writers&#x27; strike in Hollywood at the time, this was written by Steven Frankfurt, a New York advertising executive.

===Digital image processing===
&quot;Westworld&quot; was the first feature film to use digital image processing. Crichton originally went to the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena but after learning that two minutes of animation would take nine months and cost $200,000, he contacted John Whitney Sr., who in turn recommended his son John Whitney Jr. The latter went to Information International, Inc., where they could work at night and complete the animation faster and cheaper. Whitney Jr. digitally processed motion picture photography at Information International, Inc. to appear pixelized to portray the Gunslinger android&#x27;s point of view. The approximately 2 minutes and 31 seconds&#x27; worth of cinegraphic block portraiture was accomplished by color-separating (three basic color separations plus black mask) each frame of source 70 mm film images, scanning each of these elements to convert into rectangular blocks, then adding basic color according to the tone values developed. The resulting coarse pixel matrix was output back to film. The process was covered in the &quot;American Cinematographer&quot; article &quot;Behind the scenes of Westworld&quot; and in a 2013 &quot;New Yorker&quot; online article.

==Reception==
===Box office===
The film was released on an experimental regional saturation basis and grossed $2 million in its first week in 275 theatres in the Chicago, Detroit and Cleveland areas. It earned $4 million in rentals in the US and Canada by the end of 1973. After a re-release in 1976, it earned $7,365,000.

===Book tie-in===
Crichton&#x27;s original screenplay was released as a mass-market paperback in conjunction with the film.

===Critical response===
&quot;Variety&quot; described the film as excellent, saying that it &quot;combines solid entertainment, chilling topicality, and superbly intelligent serio-comic story values&quot;. Vincent Canby of the &quot;New York Times&quot; wrote that Crichton had made &quot;a creditable debut as a film director&quot;, but &quot;Crichton the director seems to have had more fun with the film than Crichton the writer, whose screenplay can offer us no better explanation for the sudden, bloody robot rebellion than an epidemic of &#x27;central mechanism psychosis.&#x27;&quot; Gene Siskel gave the film three stars out of four, calling the first half &quot;exciting and provocative&quot; but thinking much less of the second half which he thought deteriorated into an &quot;illogical and meandering chase story. It is difficult to believe the same man wrote both halves of the film.&quot; Kevin Thomas of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; called it &quot;a clever sci-fi fantasy ... with enough ingenuity and conviction to make it a successful diversion for those seeking novel rather than sophisticated entertainment.&quot; Jean M. White of the &quot;Washington Post&quot; wrote that &quot;Crichton spends too much time establishing his robot world and short-circuits suspense with long, arid stretches of Grade B Western.&quot;

The film has a rating of 84% &quot;Fresh&quot; on Rotten Tomatoes based on 43 reviews. The site&#x27;s consensus states: &quot;Yul Brynner gives a memorable performance as a robotic cowboy in this amusing sci-fi/western hybrid.&quot; Reviewing the DVD release in September 2008, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; reviewer Philip Horne described the film as a &quot;richly suggestive, bleakly terrifying fable—and Brynner&#x27;s performance is chillingly pitch-perfect.&quot;

After making the film, Crichton took a year off. &quot;I was intensely fatigued by &quot;Westworld&quot;&quot;, he said later. &quot;I was pleased but intimidated by the audience reaction. ... The laughs are in the wrong places. There was extreme tension where I hadn&#x27;t planned it. I felt the reaction, and maybe the picture, was out of control.&quot; He believed that the film had been misunderstood as warning of the dangers of technology: &quot;Everyone remembers the scene in &quot;Westworld&quot; where Yul Brynner is a robot that runs amok. But there is a very specific scene where people discuss whether or not to shut down the resort. I think the movie was as much about that decision as anything. They just didn&#x27;t really think it was really going to happen.&quot; His real intention was to warn against corporate greed.

For him the picture marked the end of &quot;about five years of science fiction/monster pictures for me&quot;. He took a break from the genre and wrote &quot;The Great Train Robbery&quot;.

Crichton did not make a film for another five years. He did try, and had one set up &quot;but I insisted on a certain way of doing it and as a result it was never made.&quot;

==Network television airings==
&quot;Westworld&quot; was first aired on NBC television on February 28, 1976. The network aired a slightly longer version of the film than was shown in theaters or subsequently released on home video. Some of the extra scenes that were added for the United States television version are:
* Brief fly-by exterior shot of the hovercraft zooming just a few feet above the desert floor. In the theatrical version, all scenes involving the hovercraft were interior shots only.
* The scenes with the scientists having a meeting in the underground complex was much longer, giving more insight into their &quot;virus&quot; problem with the robots.
* A scene of technicians talking in the locker room about the work load of each robot world.
* There was a longer discussion between Peter and the sheriff after his arrest when he shot the Gunslinger.
* A scene in Medieval World in which a guest is tortured on the rack, which appears in the theatrical version only as a still image, was restored.
* The Gunslinger&#x27;s chase of Peter through the three worlds was also extended.

==Legacy==
A sequel, &quot;Futureworld&quot;, was filmed in 1976, and produced by American International Pictures, and only distributed by MGM. Only Brynner returned from the original cast to reprise his Gunslinger character (in a dream sequence, as well as footage recapping the original), though it did provide details regarding the carnage: more than 50 guests killed and 95 staff members killed or wounded. Fred Karlin returned as composer.

Four years later, in 1980, the CBS television network aired a short-lived television series, &quot;Beyond Westworld&quot;, &quot;which took the &quot;Futureworld&quot; concept of android doppelgangers, but ignored the movie itself, harking back to Westworld&quot; with new characters. Its poor ratings caused it to be canceled after only three of the five episodes aired. Only sound designer Richard S. Church was retained from the movie.

Crichton used similar plot elements—a high-tech amusement park running amok and a central control paralyzed by a power failure—in his bestselling novel &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;.

&quot;Westworld&quot; contains a reference to a computer virus, one of the earliest mentions of them in fiction. The analogy is made by the Chief Supervisor in a staff meeting where the spread of malfunctions across the park is discussed.

In 1996, &quot;Westworld 2000&quot;, a video game sequel to the film, was released by Byron Preiss Multimedia.

Beginning in 2002, trade publications reported that a &quot;Westworld&quot; remake starring Arnold Schwarzenegger was in production, and would be written by &quot;Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines&quot; screenwriters Michael Ferris and John Bracanto. Tarsem Singh was originally slated to direct, but left the project. Quentin Tarantino was approached, but turned it down. On January 19, 2011, Warner Bros announced that plans for the remake were still active.

In August 2013, it was announced that HBO had ordered a pilot for a &quot;Westworld&quot; TV series, to be produced by J. J. Abrams, Jonathan Nolan, and Jerry Weintraub. Nolan and his wife Lisa Joy were set to write and executive produce the series, with Nolan directing the pilot episode. Production began in July 2014 in Los Angeles. The new series premiered October 2, 2016. On April 22, 2020, the series was renewed for a fourth season, which premiered on June 26, 2022.

<doc id="464190" wikidata="Q192924" url="?curid=464190" title="Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)">
<text>The Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye () was signed on 10 September 1919 by the victorious Allies of World War I on the one hand and by the Republic of German-Austria on the other. Like the Treaty of Trianon with Hungary and the Treaty of Versailles with the Weimar Republic, it contained the Covenant of the League of Nations and as a result was not ratified by the United States but was followed by the US–Austrian Peace Treaty of 1921.

The treaty signing ceremony took place at the Château de Saint-Germain-en-Laye.

==Background==
As a preamble, on 21 October 1918, 208 German-speaking delegates of the Austrian Imperial Council had convened in a &quot;provisional national assembly of German-Austria&quot; at the Lower Austrian Landtag. When the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian Army culminated at the Battle of Vittorio Veneto, the Social Democrat Karl Renner was elected German-Austrian State Chancellor on 30 October. In the course of the Aster Revolution on 31 October, the newly established Hungarian People&#x27;s Republic under Minister President Mihály Károlyi declared the real union with Austria terminated.

With the Armistice of Villa Giusti on 3 November 1918, the fate of the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy was sealed. On 11 November 1918 Emperor Charles I of Austria officially declared to &quot;relinquish every participation in the administration&quot;, one day later the provisional assembly declared German-Austria a democratic republic and part of the Weimar Republic. However, on the territory of the Cisleithanian (&quot;Austrian&quot;) half of the former empire, the newly established states of Czechoslovakia, Poland, and the Yugoslav Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (later named Yugoslavia) had been proclaimed. Moreover, South Tyrol and Trentino were occupied by Italian forces and Yugoslav troops entered the former Duchy of Carinthia, leading to violent fights.

An Austrian Constitutional Assembly election was held on 16 February 1919. The Assembly re-elected Karl Renner state chancellor and enacted the Habsburg Law concerning the banishment of the House of Habsburg-Lorraine. When Chancellor Renner arrived at Saint-Germain in May 1919, he and the Austrian delegation found themselves excluded from the negotiations led by French Prime Minister Georges Clemenceau. Upon an Allied ultimatum, Renner signed the treaty on 10 September. The Treaty of Trianon in June 1920 between Hungary and the Allies completed the disposition of the former Dual Monarchy.

==Provisions==

The treaty declared that the Austro-Hungarian Empire was to be dissolved. According to article 177 Austria, along with the other Central Powers, accepted responsibility for starting the war. The new Republic of Austria, consisting of most of the German-speaking Danubian and Alpine provinces in former Cisleithania, recognized the independence of Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Poland, and the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. The treaty included &#x27;war reparations&#x27; of large sums of money, directed towards the Allies (however the exact amount has never been defined and collected from Austria), as well as provisions for the liquidation of the Austro-Hungarian Bank.

===Territory===
Cisleithanian Austria had to face significant territorial losses, amounting to over 60 percent of the prewar Austrian Empire&#x27;s territory:

*The Lands of the Bohemian Crown, i.e. the Bohemia and Moravia (modern day Czechia) crownlands (including small adjacent Lower Austrian territories around Feldsberg and Gmünd) formed the core of the newly created state of Czechoslovakia. The Austrian Silesia province which was the subject of the Polish–Czechoslovak War of January 1919, was split between Czech Silesia and Polish Cieszyn Silesia, and incorporated into the Silesian Voivodeship. These cessions concerned a large German-speaking population in German Bohemia and Sudetenland.
*The former Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria, made up of the territory the Habsburg monarchy had annexed in the 1772 First Partition of Poland, fell back to the re-established Polish Republic.
*The adjacent Bukovina in the east passed to the Kingdom of Romania.
*The southern half of the former Tyrolean crownland up to the Brenner Pass, including predominantly Southern Bavarian-speaking South Tyrol and the present-day Trentino province, together with the Carinthian Canal Valley around Tarvisio fell to Italy, as well as the Austrian Littoral (Gorizia and Gradisca, the Imperial Free City of Trieste, and Istria as recognized by the Treaty of Rapallo in 1920). 
*The main part of the former Kingdom of Dalmatia, the Duchy of Carniola and Lower Styria with the Carinthian Mieß (Meža) Valley and Gemeinde Seeland (Jezersko) was ceded to the Yugoslav Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, contrary to what was stipulated by the 1915 London Pact. Also Bosnia and Herzegovina was given to it. The affiliation of the Southern Carinthian territory with its Slovene-speaking share of population was to be decided in a Carinthian Plebiscite.
*Austria-Hungary&#x27;s only overseas possession, its concession in Tianjin, was turned over to China.
*The predominantly German- and Croatian-speaking western parts of the Hungarian counties of Moson, Sopron and Vas were awarded to Austria. The Uprising in West Hungary led to a plebiscite which resulted in the transition of Sopron and its surrounding 8 villages back to Hungary. Subsequently, other villages were returned or exchanged between Austria and Hungary up to 1923. In the end, the territories finally gained from Hungary were organised as a state of Austria named Burgenland.

The Allies had explicitly committed themselves to the cause of the minority peoples of Austria-Hungary late in the war. Indeed, U. S. Secretary of State Robert Lansing had effectively ended what slim chance existed for Austria-Hungary to survive the war when he told Vienna that since the Allies were now committed to the Czechs, Slovaks and South Slavs, autonomy for the nationalities–the tenth of the Fourteen Points–was no longer enough. Reflecting this, the Allies not only allowed the minority peoples to help create new states (Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia), recreate former states (Poland), or join their ethnic brethren in existing nation-states (Romania, Italy), but allowed the successor states to absorb significant blocks of German-inhabited territory. However, the promise of self-determination ran up against the reality that no convenient line could be drawn to separate intermingled nationalities. In further cases, irredentists would claim that some German or Hungarian-inhabited territories had actually been theirs. This was well rendered by the fact that only a few plebiscites were allowed in the disputed areas to ascertain the wishes of the local populaces.

===Politics and military===
Article 88 of the treaty required Austria to refrain from directly or indirectly compromising its independence, which meant that Austria could not enter into political or economic union with the Weimar Republic without the agreement of the council of the League of Nations. Accordingly, the new republic&#x27;s initial self-chosen name of German-Austria () had to be changed to Austria. Many Austrians would come to find this term harsh (especially among the Austrian Germans being a vast majority who would support a single German nation state), due to Austria&#x27;s later economic weakness, which was caused by loss of land. Because of this, support for the idea of &quot;Anschluss&quot; (political union) with Nazi Germany later proved popular. 

Conscription was abolished and the Austrian Army was limited to a force of 30,000 volunteers. There were numerous provisions dealing with Danubian navigation, the transfer of railways, and other details involved in the breakup of a great empire into several small independent states.

The vast reduction of population, territory and resources of the new Austria relative to the old empire wreaked havoc on the economy of the old nation, most notably in Vienna, an imperial capital now without an empire to support it. For a time, the country&#x27;s very existence was called into question.

<text>The &quot;Nelson&quot; class was a class of two battleships ( and ) of the British Royal Navy, built shortly after, and under the terms of, the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922. They were the only British battleships built between the , ordered in 1913, and the , ordered in 1936.

The ships were named after famous British admirals: George Brydges Rodney, 1st Baron Rodney, victor of the Battle of Cape St. Vincent and the Battle of the Saintes, and Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson, who won the Battles of the Nile and Trafalgar.

To comply with the limitations of the Washington Treaty, these ships were of an unusual design with many novel features. They are often referred to as the first treaty battleships. The &quot;Nelson&quot;s were unique in British battleship construction, being the only ships to carry a main armament of nine guns. The most unusual feature however, and one that is immediately noticeable, is that these were all carried forward of the bridge.

Commissioned in 1927–29, the &quot;Nelson&quot;s served extensively in the Atlantic, Mediterranean, and Indian oceans during World War II. was made famous by her role in the sinking of the in May 1941. At the climax of the battle &quot;Rodney&quot;, in conjunction with &quot;King George V&quot;, closed on &quot;Bismarck&quot; to bombard her at short range. &quot;Rodney&quot;″s main guns were credited with an estimated 100 to 130 hits, contributing greatly to &quot;Bismarck&quot;″s final destruction.

&quot;Nelson&quot; and &quot;Rodney&quot; participated in the bombardment of targets in northern France during and after D-Day. In particular, during the Caen campaign &quot;Nelson&quot; was credited with destroying a group of five Tiger tanks which ventured into a red zone [within of the coast] deemed by the German command to be in range of Allied battleships.

Both ships of the class survived the war, but were scrapped in 1948–1949 along with all other British battleships except the four remaining &quot;King George V&quot;–class battleships and .

==Background and design==
The Battle of Jutland had shown the value of firepower and protection over speed and manoeuvrability.

The next generation of British warships incorporated this lesson. After World War I, the Admiralty drew up plans for massive, heavily armoured battlecruisers and battleships, far larger and stronger than all previous vessels. The s would carry guns, and the proposed s would carry nine guns, and would be the most powerful vessels afloat. The Royal Navy was planning to hold its superiority in the burgeoning arms race, despite the large warships planned in Japan and the United States.

Development was abruptly curtailed by the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922, which brought the arms race to a halt. The four battlecruisers that had been ordered were cancelled. Some of the material acquired would later be used in &quot;Nelson&quot; and &quot;Rodney&quot;. The Treaty limited all nations&#x27; battleships to maximum limits of 35,000 tons and 16-inch guns. The British had successfully ensured that the definition of maximum displacement – the standard displacement – excluded both fuel and boiler feed water. They had argued that having to protect the widespread British Empire meant their ships had to carry more of both and they should not be penalised compared to nations, such as Japan, France and Italy, that operated normally much closer to their home bases. As a result, water-filled internal anti-torpedo bulges could be incorporated, which did not contribute to the &quot;dry&quot; (standard) weights and therefore did not exceed the treaty displacement limits.

The limits of the treaty inevitably led to compromises in the design of two new ships, and the resulting &quot;Nelson&quot; class sacrificed installed power (and hence speed) in order that the ships be well-armed and defended. They were often referred to as the &quot;Cherry Tree&quot; class, because they had been &quot;cut down by Washington&quot;. The need to limit displacement resulted in a radical new warship design, drawn from the &quot;G3&quot; and &quot;N3&quot; designs of Eustace Tennyson-d&#x27;Eyncourt, Director of Naval Construction from 1912 to 1924. To reduce the weight of armour, the main gun turrets were all mounted forward to shorten the armoured citadel. The &quot;G3&quot; and &quot;N3&quot; had two turrets forward of the bridge with the third between the bridge and the funnels/aft superstructure. However, in the &quot;Nelson&quot;s, this was taken further and all three were in front of the bridge; &quot;B&quot; mount superfiring over &quot;A&quot;, with &quot;X&quot; turret on the forecastle deck behind &quot;B&quot;, and therefore unable to fire directly forward or aft. &quot;X&quot; turret is sometimes referred to as &quot;C&quot; turret and one alternative design, designated &quot;O3&quot;, had it superfiring over both &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; turrets. The secondary guns were placed in totally enclosed director-controlled twin turrets at the upper deck level and were grouped aft – another innovative element taken from the G3 and N3 design.

The machinery was of necessity limited in weight, size and installed power, and there were only two shafts with quite large screws. All previous British battleships after of 1906 had four screws as did all British battleship classes after &quot;Nelson&quot;. In order that fuel gasses be kept clear of the superstructure, the boiler rooms were moved behind the engine rooms, exhausting into a single funnel. This orientation also reduced the overall length of the armoured citadel. As a countermeasure to the limited power, the hull was of a very efficient hydrodynamic form, to attain the best possible speed.

==Description==
The &quot;Nelson&quot;s had a length between perpendiculars of and an overall length of (&quot;Nelson&quot;) or (&quot;Rodney&quot;), a beam of , and a draught of at mean standard load. They displaced at standard load and at deep load. Their crew numbered 1,361 officers and ratings when serving as flagships and 1,314 as private ships. At deep load, they had a metacentric height of , which gave them a quick roll between 11.2 and 13.6 seconds. In calm weather, the &quot;Nelson&quot;-class ships were very manoeuvrable, but the large surface area of the superstructure gave them a large amount of weather helm and they could be a handful in confined spaces with a strong wind as was demonstrated when ran aground off Southsea beach in 1934.

The ships were powered by two sets of Brown-Curtis geared steam turbines, each driving one shaft, using steam from eight Admiralty 3-drum boilers fitted with superheaters that operated at a pressure of . The turbines were rated at and intended to give the ship a maximum speed of . The sister ships exceeded their designed speed during their sea trials in 1927, reaching speeds of from . They carried of fuel oil to give them a designed range of at a cruising speed of .

===Armour===
Armour weight was also reduced by using an internal, inclined armour belt sloped outward at 18 degrees from the vertical. The armour belt was thick over the main magazines and control positions to over the machinery and 6-inch gun magazines. The slope increased the relative thickness of the belt to a plunging projectile. Water-filled compartments, surrounded by air-filled ones, formed internal torpedo bulges which were fitted between the armour and the external hull of the ship, which was not armoured. The outer hull plating was meant to initiate detonation of shells which would then explode outside the armour. This innovation dispensed with external torpedo bulges which would otherwise have reduced the speed of the ships due to drag. Underwater protection for the &quot;Nelson&quot;s was provided by a double bottom 5 feet (1.5 m) deep and a layered defence of an empty outer watertight compartment and an inner water-filled compartment. The torpedo defence system had a total depth of 12 feet (3.7 m) and was backed by a torpedo bulkhead 1.5 inches thick. The system was similar in design and effectiveness to that of &quot;Hood&quot;, and was rated to withstand an explosion of 750 lbs (340 kg) TNT. The armour scheme was of the &quot;all or nothing&quot; principle; areas were either well protected, from the front of &quot;A&quot; barbette rearwards to the after 6-inch turrets, or were not protected at all, disposing of the multiple intermediate thickness of armour seen in older designs. For the first time a British battleship had a single, thick armoured deck to protect against plunging shells and aircraft-launched bombs, with armour over the machinery spaces and armour on the lower deck over the stern, both on top of the 0.5 in (12.7 mm) deck plating. The main turrets had armour on the faces, on the sides, on the roof and on the rear with around the barbettes. The secondary turrets, however, had only NC all round over 0.5 in (12.7 mm) structural steel plates.

===Superstructure===
The large superstructure, which was octagonal in plan, was known to its crew as the &quot;Octopoidal&quot; and was sometimes referred to as &quot;Queen Anne&#x27;s Mansions&quot; due to its similarity to a 14-storey brick residential development opposite St James&#x27;s Park tube station in London. The superstructure provided spacious, weatherproof working spaces for the navigating officers and any flag officers embarked. Except for the emergency conning tower at its base, and the trunking for the main gun directors mounted on top, the superstructure was lightly armoured against splinters only, to save weight. Additional weight-saving design measures included the use of light materials such as aluminium for fittings, and fir instead of teak for deck planking, although subsequently, teak decks were fitted in the late 1920s, following concerns that the ships could not fire a full broadside without causing structural damage to the decks.

The &quot;Nelson&quot; class was a revolutionary but compromised design, and unsurprisingly there were shortcomings. The location of the superstructure towards the stern caused manoeuvrability problems in high winds, especially when steaming at low speeds, where the superstructure acted somewhat like a mizzen sail permanently set, causing the ships to &quot;weathervane&quot; but according to Captain Hugh Binney, who commanded &quot;Nelson&quot; in the late twenties, &quot;if this is kept in mind, no real difficulties should be encountered in any circumstances&quot;. This was potentially a problem in crowded harbours, and made the ships somewhat difficult to dock and embark although this issue never led to a major incident. Binney also stated &quot;In the early stages of the ship&#x27;s first commission, there was a general misconception that the &quot;Nelson&quot; class were unhandy and difficult to manoeuvre. Both my predecessor and myself, however, very soon discovered that this opinion was entirely fallacious! In calm weather, the ship&#x27;s manoeuvring capabilities are in no way inferior, and in many ways superior to those of &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; or &quot;Revenge&quot;.&quot; They could also be awkward to manoeuvre when moving astern. This was attributed to the ships having a single, central rudder which was out of the propeller race of the twin screws. At sea, however, they were reported to handle well, with a comparatively small tactical diameter (turning circle) particularly when turning into the wind, according to Lt. Commander (later Rear Admiral) Galfry Gatacre RAN, who served in 1941–1942 as the navigator for both &quot;Nelson&quot; and subsequently &quot;Rodney&quot;. He reported no difficulty in navigating either ship through the boom gates at Scapa Flow. &quot;Nelson&quot; and &quot;Rodney&quot; were the only battleships never to have bumped the boom gate vessel as they passed through Hoxa Sound.

===Armament===

These ships were fitted with the HACS AA fire control system and the Admiralty Fire Control Table Mk I for surface fire control of the main armament.

Their main armament of nine guns were mounted in triple turrets, the only RN battleships constructed in this manner. The &quot;Lion&quot;-class battleships, which were laid down in 1939 but cancelled in 1942, would have also carried nine guns in triple turrets. The &quot;Nelson&#x27;s&quot; innovation was an all-forward main armament orientation, in order to maximize the thickness of armor available for a given weight by making the citadel as short as possible, and this was subsequently copied by the French in the &quot;Dunkerque&quot;-class and &quot;Richelieu&quot;-class of battleships. 

The BL 16-inch Mk I naval guns themselves deviated from standard British designs. Where previous RN weapons fired heavy shells at a moderate velocity, the &quot;Nelson&quot;″s weapons followed the German practice of a lighter shell at a higher velocity. This change in Director of Naval Ordnance policy was due to British testing of surrendered German equipment after World War I, although much later, subsequent testing proved contradictory. Two different rifling rates were tried, and for some time there was a mixture of barrel types in different turrets, even sometimes within the same turret. The guns suffered considerable barrel wear and had a fairly large dispersion pattern, due mainly to the different riflings that each barrel had as they were refurbished over their lifespan. To compensate for barrel wear, muzzle velocities were reduced and a heavier (longer) shell was tried to offset this; but the cost of producing new shells, modifying shell handling and storage equipment came at a time when RN funding had been heavily reduced. The need to reduce displacement led to the use of triple mount turrets, which had early problems with the ammunition handling and loading machinery. The heavier weight of the triple in comparison to a twin turret meant increased stresses on the roller bearings when training the turrets. This was solved by the incorporation of spring-loaded vertical as well as conventional horizontal roller bearings. The triple mount turret proved itself when, in October 1929, a turret crew with two years&#x27; experience loaded and fired 33 consecutive rounds without mishap. The incorporation of many safety features, achieved with lighter materials, meant that the complex and relatively fragile equipment had to be serviced regularly over the ships&#x27; lifetime. Consequently the BL 16-inch Mk I were not generally considered by the RN to be as successful as the previous BL 15 inch Mark I; the BL 14-inch Mark VII, fitted to the subsequent &quot;King George V&quot;-class battleships, returned to a heavier (relatively) shell and lower velocity, but its performance was compromised by an over-complex quadruple-gun mounting that proved to have reliability defects in combat. 

Firing trials revealed that the blast of &#x27;A&#x27; and &#x27;B&#x27; turrets on forward bearings caused damage to many weather-deck fittings and conditions on the mess-decks became very uncomfortable. There was a longstanding rumour that the ships could not fire a full broadside without risk of structural damage.[3] This was disproved during the action against the German battleship &quot;Bismarck&quot;, where &quot;Rodney&quot; fired upwards of 40 broadsides (380 shells) without major structural damage except to deck planking and upper deck fittings,[11] although damage to sickbay fittings, partition bulkheads, toilet bowls and plumbing in the forecastle was extensive. Virtually every light bulb in the forward section was shattered also.[9] When &#x27;X&#x27; turret was fired 30 degrees abaft the beam and elevation of 40 degrees, considerable damage occurred to the two vertically stacked rows of bridge windows. As a result, the guns of &quot;X&quot; turret were usually prohibited from firing abaft of the beam at high elevations during peacetime practice firing. Fitting tempered glass in the bridge windows was tried, but gun blast still shattered some of them and filled the bridge with flying debris. The design of the Captain&#x27;s bridge was altered on &quot;Nelson&quot; circa 1930–33 to reduce the window area and enclose the upper portion of the previous two rows of glass. A great deal of effort was expended in correcting this problem, and fitting of protective ledges below the new smaller windows proved successful. A new enclosed Admiral&#x27;s bridge with its requisite reduced windows was built on top of the Captain&#x27;s bridge and the forward signalling lamps were moved up one level and towards the aft of the bridge. The Admiral&#x27;s bridge on &quot;Rodney&quot; remained stepped back somewhat from the forward edge of the tower, but the Captain&#x27;s bridge had the same reduced area of glass that &quot;Nelson&quot; now had, with larger ledges. Blast was also a problem elsewhere; D.K. Brown tells of a test firing that was suspended when DNC observer H.S. Pengelly, who was beneath the foredeck, reported a bright red flash after firing all guns in &quot;A&quot; turret. This was later discovered to be caused by concussion of the observers&#x27; eyeballs.

In the final phase of the action against &quot;Bismarck&quot;, &quot;Rodney&quot; fired a pair of 24.5-inch torpedoes from her port-side tube and claimed one hit. According to Ludovic Kennedy, &quot;if true, [this is] the only instance in history of one battleship torpedoing another&quot;. Earlier in this same action the starboard side tube had its sluice door jammed as the result of a near miss from one of &quot;Bismarck&quot;″s early salvos. On 27 September 1941, &quot;Nelson&quot;″s port torpedo station almost proved to be a liability when an Italian air-launched 18-inch torpedo holed the compartment behind the torpedo body room, allowing 3,750 tons of water to enter the ship. Following this, &quot;Nelson&quot;″s torpedo tubes may have been removed although another source suggests the torpedo tubes were retained in both ships into 1945.

==Summary==
Because of their unusual silhouettes, HMS &quot;Nelson&quot; and &quot;Rodney&quot; were nicknamed &quot;Nelsol&quot; and &quot;Rodnol&quot; by Royal Navy sailors as their single-funnelled profiles reminded Navy men of a series of fleet oilers that had been built during the First World War bearing names starting with &quot;Ol&quot;, the Ol class.

Despite the derisive criticism directed at this class of battleship by some of the media and some sailors upon their debut, naval historian Antony Preston considered that &quot;they were soundly conceived ships reflecting all the hard-won experience of World War One&quot; and that &quot;they proved to be very well-protected and well-designed ships&quot;.

==Ships in class==
==Construction and career==
By the end of the war, &quot;Rodney&quot; had seen hard use without any significant refit or repair and was worn out, especially her machinery. &quot;Nelson&quot; had been refitted in the United States at the end of 1944 and was in sufficiently good condition to serve in the postwar fleet including a short period as flagship of the Home Fleet at the end of 1945. &quot;Rodney&quot; was scrapped in 1948 at Inverkeithing, not long after the s and s, and &quot;Nelson&quot; in 1949 following its use as a target for bombing trials. &quot;According to Winston Churchill&#x27;s memoirs, a major modernisation was discussed to enable &quot; Nelson&quot; to serve for several years in the postwar fleet, but no other details have survived. In any case &quot;Nelson&quot; was too slow for the modern fleet which had no front-line role for battleships any more&quot;.

<doc id="464192" wikidata="Q3259049" url="?curid=464192" title="Long Tall Weekend">
<text>Long Tall Weekend is the seventh studio album by American alternative rock duo They Might Be Giants, released in 1999. It was released exclusively online through the digital music service eMusic. The album was the band&#x27;s first since their departure from the major label Elektra. &quot;Long Tall Weekend&quot; was also the first full-length album released exclusively on the Internet by an established major label band. Although the album&#x27;s primary release was digital, CDs of the album were issued promotionally. Following the success of the album&#x27;s release through eMusic, TMBG went on to issue a digital series of rarities collections — TMBG Unlimited — through their website.

==Song origins==
Many of the songs that appear on &quot;Long Tall Weekend&quot; existed as demos and selections from the band&#x27;s Dial-A-Song service. &quot;Drinkin&#x27;&quot; was originally written six years prior to the release of the album. &quot;Maybe I Know&quot; had been in TMBG setlists since the 1980s. Many songs were intended for release in different forms on later albums. &quot;She Thinks She&#x27;s Edith Head&quot; and &quot;Older&quot; resurfaced on &quot;Mink Car&quot; in 2001. The next year, &quot;Rat Patrol&quot;, &quot;Token Back to Brooklyn&quot;, &quot;Reprehensible&quot;, &quot;Certain People I Could Name&quot; and &quot;They Got Lost&quot; appeared on the rarities compilation album &quot;They Got Lost&quot;, and &quot;The Edison Museum&quot; appeared on &quot;No!&quot;. &quot;The Edison Museum&quot; was originally written and recorded in 1991 and featured on the &quot;Edisongs&quot; compilation that year. The recorded version appearing on &quot;Long Tall Weekend&quot; is largely the same as the &quot;Edisongs&quot; version, though the mixing varies.

Some songs, such as &quot;They Got Lost&quot; and &quot;Lullabye to Nightmares&quot; had also existed in different forms prior to the release of &quot;Long Tall Weekend&quot;. The former was a live track with a much faster tempo from the band&#x27;s live compilation &quot;Severe Tire Damage&quot; (1998).

&quot;They Got Lost&quot; and &quot;Certain People I Could Name&quot; were both originally slated for inclusion on &quot;Factory Showroom&quot; (1996).

==Reception==

Following the digital release of &quot;Long Tall Weekend&quot;, They Might Be Giants became the most downloaded band of 1999. John Flansburgh speculates that the feat was based not only on the content of the album, but also on the band&#x27;s early willingness to embrace digital formats, having been urged to do so by the Restless Records label.

<doc id="464194" wikidata="Q6141866" url="?curid=464194" title="James Rassman">
<text>James Rassmann (born c. 1948) is a former Los Angeles County Sheriff&#x27;s Department lieutenant who served with the U.S. Army&#x27;s 5th Special Forces Group in the Vietnam War in 1968 and 1969. Now a resident of the U.S. state of Oregon, he has credited U.S. Senator John Kerry with having rescued him from the Bay Hap River on March 13, 1969.

Rassman recommended Kerry for a Silver Star medal, but the two did not maintain a relationship for the following 30 years. Rassman gained national prominence during the 2004 Presidential election when he publicly denounced the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth&#x27;s campaign against Kerry.

Rassman is now a retired Los Angeles County Sheriff&#x27;s Department deputy sheriff and an &quot;avid&quot; orchid grower.

==Events in Vietnam==
Kerry was serving in the United States Navy at the time, as lieutenant and Officer-in-Charge of Swift Boat PCF-94, which for that period primarily patrolled in the Mekong River delta. On 13 March 1969, they had completed operations, had debarked some passengers but retained others, and this squadron of five PCF boats was headed out of the river to the bay. They approached a weir (a series of poles across the river, like thousands along the shore and the shoreline of the bay, across which nets could be strung). Some of the boats hugged the shore to the left, some to the right, in order to get around. As they tried to go around, the lead boat to the left, PCF-3, was blown clear out of the water with a command detonated mine (someone was nearby to remotely detonate it). According to Sen. Kerry&#x27;s account, Kerry was already injured himself, and his boat (already damaged from a second explosion) came under heavy fire, when Kerry heard &quot;man overboard&quot;. He says that he ordered that the crew turn the boat around and return to pick up Rassmann, who had fallen off the port side or stern of PCF-94. Rassmann was for some reason unable to climb up over the cargo net near the bow of PCF-94, so Kerry pulled him on deck. The incident earned Kerry a Bronze Star with &quot;V&quot; Device for valor and his third Purple Heart.

==Political fallout==
This account was disputed by three veterans who identified themselves as members of the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth but who were not involved with Kerry or the Missions they claimed to dispute. The “swift boaters” ( The campaign inspired the widely used political pejorative &quot;swiftboating&quot;, to describe an unfair or untrue political attack.) were part of a political pac organization opposed to Kerry&#x27;s Presidential candidacy. During Kerry&#x27;s Presidential campaign a number of the other actual participants there during the events stepped forward to support the original account including crew members serving on the same boats as those belonging to the SBVT.

==Rassman&#x27;s involvement==
Rassman recommended Kerry for a Silver Star. Based on such an officer&#x27;s recommendation, lacking testimony to the contrary, as Kerry already had this award from a previous incident, he was awarded a Bronze Star with Combat V, instead. Part of the citation read - &quot;Lt. Kerry directed his gunners to provide suppressing fire, while from an exposed position on the bow, his arm bleeding and in pain, with disregard for his personal safety, he pulled the man aboard.&quot;

Rassmann reappeared and became a public figure just before the 2004 Iowa caucus. After having not seen Kerry for more than 30 years, he contacted the Kerry campaign and asked how he could help. He expressed that he had attempted to contact Kerry, whom he credits with saving his life, in 1984, but Kerry said he did not receive any message from Rassmann. Rassmann was a registered Republican at the time he stepped forward to contradict the Republican attack ads . He said that he voted for Democrats Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton, Al Gore, but also Republicans Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush. In January 2004, Rassmann officially changed his registration to the Democratic Party. Rassmann declared his support for Kerry in the Presidential race and the Kerry campaign engineered a meeting. The surprise reunion is credited with rousing veteran support for Kerry and propelling him to a victory in the Iowa caucus and beyond.

Rassman continued to challenge the Swift Boat Veterans&#x27; account of events throughout the campaign. He traveled with Kerry on the campaign trail in May. In August 2004 he and former Senator Max Cleland, along with several other veterans and members of the U.S. Senate, attempted to hand-deliver a letter to President George W. Bush, requesting that he condemn the Swift Boat group&#x27;s TV ads.

== Continued political activity ==
Rassman has stayed active in politics; in 2006 he was one of several veterans who criticized then-Senator Hillary Clinton&#x27;s support of the Iraq War.

<text>The National Unity Party of Canada (NUPC) was a Canadian far-right political party which based its ideology on Adolf Hitler&#x27;s Nazism and Benito Mussolini&#x27;s fascism. It was founded as the  (PNSC) by Nazi sympathizer Adrien Arcand on February 22, 1934. The party&#x27;s activities were originally limited to Quebec, but it later expanded to Ontario and Western Canada. Party membership swelled in the mid-to-late 1930s as the party absorbed smaller fascist groups across the country. Following the outbreak of World War II, the Canadian government banned the NUPC on May 30, 1940, under the &quot;Defence of Canada Regulations&quot; of the &quot;War Measures Act&quot;. Arcand and many of his followers were consequently arrested and interned for the duration of the war.

The ban on the NUPC was lifted following the war&#x27;s end in 1945, and the party resumed its activities shortly afterwards. However, its public presence greatly diminished after the war and all but disappeared following Arcand&#x27;s death in 1967. The 1949 federal election was the only election ever contested by the NUPC; Arcand ran in the Quebec riding of Richelieu—Verchères and placed second, receiving just over 29 percent of the vote.
== History ==

Arcand founded the (PNSC) on February 22, 1934. It was known as the &quot;Christian National Socialist Party&quot; in English. A fascist and antisemite, Arcand described Jews in Canada as &quot;cockroaches and insects&quot;, decried liberal democracy as a &quot;Jewish invention&quot; and lauded Hitler as the &quot;saviour of Christianity&quot;. Arcand looked toward Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy for ideological inspiration. His supporters referred to him as the &quot;Canadian &quot;Führer&quot;&quot;, a reference to the title held by Hitler.

The Canadian Nationalist Party, a fascist group based in the Prairie provinces by the mid-1930s claimed to have a few thousand members, mainly concentrated in Quebec, British Columbia and Alberta, worked closely with the PNSC after 1934. The PNSC later expanded into Ontario and changed its English name to the &quot;National Christian Party of Canada&quot;.

On July 2, 1938, fascist groups from across Canada attended a conference hosted by the PNSC at Forester&#x27;s Hall in Toronto, though the groups claimed to have met in Kingston, Ontario in defiance of a ban by Kingston City Council. Delegates then drove to Kingston and took pictures of themselves to release to the press &quot;for no other purpose than to claim they had successfully met in that city in defiance of the city council&quot;. The attendees agreed to unite under a single organization and consequently established the National Unity Party of Canada (NUPC). Arcand announced that &quot;a flaming torch [would] be the new party&#x27;s emblem, &#x27;Canada for Canadians&#x27; its slogan, the upraised arm its salute and &#x27;King, Country and Christianity&#x27; its program.&quot; At a time of mounting English-French Canadian tension, Arcand hoped to unite the two groups and create a white nationalist movement under the leadership of the NUPC. Arcand was affirmed as the new party&#x27;s leader and Joseph C. Farr, the Ontario chairman of the Canadian Nationalist Party, became the NUPC&#x27;s secretary. At this point, CNP leader William Whittaker was in declining health, having suffered a stroke in March 1938. He would die by the end of the year.

Following the conference, Arcand and Farr held a rally at Massey Hall attended by around 2,500 people with the NUP newspaper, &quot;Le Combat National&quot; claiming that 850 people joined the NUP on the spot. Arcand was accompanied by 85 &quot;Blueshirts&quot;, armed members of the NUPC&#x27;s paramilitary force. The anti-fascist Canadian League for Peace and Democracy simultaneously held a counter-rally of 10,000 people at Maple Leaf Gardens in opposition to the NUPC. A smaller protest of up to 800 people was organized by William Krehm and the Provisional Anti-Fascist Committee resulting in several arrests. The NUPC described the anti-fascists as &quot;the Jews and the organizations that they control&quot;, &quot;Judeo-communist forces&quot;, and &quot;the forces of Israel and Moscow&quot;, claiming that the protestors had planned to enter the meeting and break it up by force.

The outbreak of World War II prompted the Canadian government to ban the NUPC on May 30, 1940, under the &quot;Defence of Canada Regulations&quot; of the &quot;War Measures Act&quot;. Arcand and many of his followers were consequently arrested and interned for the duration of the war. The party resumed its activities after its ban was lifted following the end of the war in 1945.

Arcand contested the 1949 federal election in the Quebec riding of Richelieu—Verchères as a candidate for the NUPC. He placed second, receiving 5,590 votes (29.1 per cent of the total). He came in second again with 39 per cent of the vote when he ran as a &quot;Nationalist&quot; in Berthier—Maskinongé—Delanaudière in the 1953 federal election.

The NUPC&#x27;s last known event was a banquet held in honour of Arcand on November 14, 1965, inside Montreal&#x27;s Paul Sauvé Arena. About 800 to 850 attendees toasted the sickly Arcand, who had prepared a final speech praising his &quot;loyal student&quot; Gérard Lanctôt. By December 1966, Arcand had become bedridden by insomnia and edema; his condition worsened in April 1967 and he suffered from severe pain in his larynx. Arcand died shortly afterwards on August 1, 1967. His funeral was held at a church in Lanoraie and attended by hundreds of his supporters, many of whom gave Arcand a final Roman salute. Lanctôt subsequently inherited Arcand&#x27;s position as leader of the NUPC, a position which he held until his death in 2003.

The NUPC was registered as a private enterprise with the Government of Quebec from March 13, 1978, to July 27, 2016.

<doc id="464204" wikidata="Q1130972" url="?curid=464204" title="USS Block Island (CVE-21)">
<text>USS &quot;Block Island&quot; (CVE-21/AVG-21/ACV-21) was a for the United States Navy during World War II. She was the first of two escort carriers named after Block Island Sound off Rhode Island and was the only American carrier sunk in the Atlantic during the war.

Originally classified AVG-21, she became ACV-21 on 20 August 1942, and CVE-21 on 15 July 1943. She was named after Block Island, an island in Rhode Island east of New York.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Block Island&quot; was launched on 6 June 1942 by Seattle-Tacoma Shipbuilding Corporation in Tacoma, Washington, under a Maritime Commission contract; sponsored by Mrs H. B. Hutchinson, wife of Commander Hutchinson. She transferred to the United States Navy on 1 May 1942 and commissioned on 8 March 1943, with Captain Logan C Ramsey in command.

==Aircraft carried==
&quot;Block Island&quot; had capacity for up to 24 fighter and anti-submarine aircraft normally a mixture of Grumman Wildcat and Avengers with composition dependent upon the mission. The squadron had the callsign VC-25 USN (Composite Squadron Twenty Five).

When she was utilised in a ferry role, she could carry up to 90 aircraft depending on aircraft type.

==Service history==
Departing San Diego, California in May 1943, &quot;Block Island&quot; steamed to Norfolk, Virginia, to join the Atlantic Fleet. She then made two trips from New York City to Belfast, Northern Ireland, carrying Republic P-47 Thunderbolt fighters.

USS &quot;Bogue&quot; (CVE-9) and had pioneered new anti-submarine warfare (ASW) techniques in the Battle of the Atlantic, forming hunter-killer groups to destroy German submarines. &quot;Block Island&quot; formed another group with four veteran flush-deck destroyers, , , , and as Task Group (TG) 21.1. During her four anti-submarine cruises, &quot;Block Island&quot;&#x27;s aircraft sank two submarines and shared another two with her escorts.

On 28 October 1943, her Avenger and Wildcat aircraft sank with depth charges at , fifty-six men were killed (all hands).
On 17 March 1944, &quot;Block Island&quot;, destroyer , and destroyer escort sank at . Nine of the boat&#x27;s crew were killed and 47 taken prisoner.

On 19 March 1944, her aircraft sank in southwest of the Cape Verde Islands. &quot;U-1059&quot; was transporting torpedoes to the &quot;Monsun Gruppe&quot; (&quot;Monsoon Group&quot;), a group of U-boats that operated in the Pacific and Indian Ocean. Of &quot;U-1059&quot;’s crew, 47 were killed and 8 captured.

On 6 May 1944, &quot;Block Island&quot; and destroyer escort sank at . The boat lost 24 killed and there were 36 survivors, later transferred to &quot;Block Island&quot;.

===Sinking===
&quot;Block Island&quot; was torpedoed off the Canary Islands at 20:13 on 29 May 1944 by who had slipped through her screen of escorts. &quot;U-549&quot; fired three T-3 torpedoes, hitting her with two and severely damaging the ship which later sank. Six crewmen were killed in the attack; the remaining 951 were picked up by the escorting destroyers.

 attacked and sank &quot;U-549&quot; using her hedgehog spigot mortar system and depth charges in .

When &quot;Block Island&quot; was torpedoed, six of her Wildcats (VC-55) were in the air and had no place to land. They headed for the Canary Islands but all had to ditch at night after running out of fuel and only two of the pilots were rescued.

==Reunions==
Former crewmembers held several reunions, the final one in Fargo, North Dakota in 2019.

==Awards==
&quot;Block Island&quot; received two battle stars for her service.

<text>Monster Manual II is the title shared by two hardback rulebooks published for different versions of the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; (&quot;D&amp;D&quot;) fantasy roleplaying game.

==&quot;Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;==
&quot;Monster Manual II&quot; was a 160-page hardcover book published in 1983, credited solely to Gary Gygax, which featured cover art by Jeff Easley. The book was a supplement describing over 250 monsters, most with illustrations. Many of the monsters were drawn from scenario modules, in particular from &quot;S4: Lost Caverns of Tsojcanth&quot;. The book included random encounter tables for dungeon and wilderness settings built from the &quot;Monster Manual&quot;, &quot;Fiend Folio&quot;, and &quot;Monster Manual II&quot;, and a dozen new devils that had been first published in the pages of &quot;Dragon&quot; magazine. Like the &quot;Fiend Folio&quot; before it, the monsters in &quot;Monster Manual II&quot; listed the experience point value for each monster within the entry. The &quot;Monster Manual II&quot; along with the First Edition &quot;Unearthed Arcana&quot; book featured quite a number of monsters, races, and places from Gary Gygax&#x27;s Greyhawk Campaign world. The book featured interior illustrations by Jim Holloway, Harry Quinn, Dave Sutherland, and Larry Elmore.

In 1999, a paperback reprint of the first edition was released.

===Reception===
&quot;Monster Manual II&quot; garnered positive reviews, receiving a score of 7 out of 10 in a review in &quot;White Dwarf&quot; magazine. The reviewer praised the book&#x27;s standard of clear presentation, and felt that the artwork was of a higher quality than that in the previous monster books. However, the reviewer felt that there were too many high level and overly deadly monsters, and that most of the monsters in the book were inimical to adventures. The reviewer did make note of the fact that there were &quot;many interesting ideas and several well-developed tribes and hierarchies&quot;, and felt that, overall, the book is &quot;a good, well presented addition to the &quot;AD&amp;D&quot; series, with some very useful creatures&quot;. The reviewer recommended the book to anyone who likes a wide range of monsters in the game.

Doug Cowie reviewed &quot;Monster Manual II&quot; quite favorably for &quot;Imagine&quot; magazine. He noted that the cover was good, and contrasted it with the first edition &quot;Monster Manual&quot;, whose cover was &quot;universally held to be appalling&quot; and whose &quot;childish style&quot; may have &quot;seriously hampered the development of RPGs as adult games&quot;. As for &quot;Monster Manual II&quot;, Cowie suggested: &quot;If you like the AD&amp;D game, go and buy it immediately.&quot; Although he found some monsters &quot;to be just plain silly&quot;, they are all &quot;well presented, properly thought out and adequately described&quot;.

Lawrence Schick also commented on the &quot;Monster Manual II&quot; in &quot;Heroic Worlds&quot;, stating &quot;Some of the monsters are less than inspired, and some are quite silly; this author&#x27;s favorites are the stegocentipede, a giant arthropod notable for its twin row of back plates (wow!), and the stench kow, a monstrous bison that smells &quot;real bad&quot;.&quot;

Scott Taylor for &quot;Black Gate&quot; in 2014 listed &quot;Monster Manual II&quot; by Jeff Easley as #3 in The Top 10 TSR Cover Paintings of All Time.

Scott Taylor of &quot;Black Gate&quot; listed the &quot;Monster Manual II&quot; as #1 on the list of &quot;Top 10 &#x27;Orange Spine&#x27; &quot;AD&amp;D&quot; Hardcovers By Jeff Easley, saying &quot;Jeff&#x27;s first &#x27;Orange Spine&#x27; and first hardcover &quot;AD&amp;D&quot; work, and it absolutely takes it to church. If you haven&#x27;t sat around wondering A: if this [is] a hill giant or and ogre lord and B: if this poor bastard fighter is going to live, then you aren&#x27;t a &quot;D&amp;D&quot; player. Truly, one of the greatest masterworks to ever grace a gaming product.&quot;

==&quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; 3rd edition==
&quot;Monster Manual II&quot; was a new monster-specific rulebook that contained mostly updated monsters from the sourcebooks of earlier editions, though some monsters have almost no overlap with those of their first edition namesakes. &quot;Monster Manual II&quot; also included a discussion of monster design. &quot;Monster Manual II&quot; was designed by Ed Bonny, Jeff Grubb, Rich Redman, Skip Williams, and Steve Winter. Cover art was by Henry Higginbotham, with interior art by Glen Angus, Daren Bader, Thomas Baxa, Matt Cavotta, Dennis Cramer, David Day, Brian Despain, Tony DiTerlizzi, Michael Dutton, Jeff Easley, Emily Fiegenschuh, Donato Giancola, Lars Grant-West, Rebecca Guay, Quinton Hoover, Jeremy Jarvis, Alton Lawson, Todd Lockwood, Raven Mimura, Matthew Mitchell, Vinod Rams, Wayne Reynolds, David Roach, Scott Roller, Richard Sardinha, Marc Sasso, Brian Snoddy, Anthony Waters, and Sam Wood.

According to Jeff Grubb for &quot;Monster Manual II&quot;, &quot;The original plan was about 50 percent completely new, about 50 percent revisions of classic beasts that were not in the first &quot;Monster Manual&quot;. Right now, it&#x27;s hard to tell because a lot of &quot;classics&quot; have been stripped down to their core concepts and names and rebuilt from the ground up.&quot; There was no new version of &quot;Monster Manual II&quot; for the 3.5 edition of &quot;D&amp;D&quot;, although update errata was made available for download from the publisher&#x27;s website.

===Reception===
Alan D. Kohler, a reviewer from &quot;Pyramid&quot;, commented: &quot;The third edition of the game moved forward the &quot;art&quot; of monsters, providing them with more detailed statistics and methods for advancing creatures. It is in these footsteps that the &quot;Monster Manual II&quot; must follow.&quot;

<text>Fiend Folio is the name of three separate products published for successive editions of the fantasy role-playing game &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; (&quot;D&amp;D&quot;). All three are collections of monsters.

The bulk of the material in the first edition came from the British gaming magazine &quot;White Dwarf&quot;, rather than being authored by Gary Gygax, the game&#x27;s co-creator. Readers and gamers had submitted creatures to the &quot;Fiend Factory&quot; department of the magazine, and the most highly regarded of those appearing in the first thirteen issues were selected to be in the publication.

==Publication history==

===&quot;Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; 1st edition===

Games Workshop, with Don Turnbull as editor, originally intended to develop and publish the &quot;Fiend Folio&quot; tome () in late 1979 as the second &quot;Monster Manual&quot; volume, and would be officially recognized by TSR as an &quot;Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; product, with the monsters mostly taken from submissions to &quot;White Dwarf&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Fiend Factory&quot; column. At the time, Games Workshop was the holder of the license to publish &quot;D&amp;D&quot; game products in the United Kingdom. Although the manuscript was completed on time by editor Don Turnbull, a business dispute between Games Workshop and TSR Hobbies delayed publication of the book for nearly two years. The &quot;Fiend Folio&quot; was finally published in August 1981 by TSR itself, who used the product to launch its UK division.

Much of the material for the 128-page hardcover &quot;Fiend Folio&quot; was drawn from early issues of &quot;White Dwarf&quot;. Also edited by Turnbull, the magazine&#x27;s &quot;Fiend Factory&quot; column featured new &quot;AD&amp;D&quot; monsters, many of them created by gamers who read the magazine. The majority of monsters in the &quot;Fiend Folio&quot; were designed by British contributors, each of whom received an acknowledgement in the index. The book used the same format as that of the &quot;Monster Manual&quot;, concisely detailing the attributes and abilities of each monster. Some illustrations by Emmanuel were previously featured in the &quot;Fiend Factory&quot; column from issue 12: the Assassin Bug, Githyanki, Grell and Giant Bloodworm. Besides creatures from the column, jermlaine, drow, kuo-toa, and svirfneblin, all of which had previously appeared in adventure modules from TSR, were included. Turnbull also included creatures that had been submitted to the magazine, but not published in the column. Aside from monsters, the book presents tables to generate random encounters in dungeon and outdoor environments, as well as the Astral and Ethereal Planes; these encounter tables include creatures from both the &quot;Monster Manual&quot; and &quot;Fiend Folio&quot;, and can replace the tables from the &quot;Dungeon Master&#x27;s Guide&quot;.

The githyanki, designed by Charles Stross and first appearing in &quot;White Dwarf&quot;, was introduced to most &quot;D&amp;D&quot; players in the &quot;Fiend Folio&quot;. The githyanki was featured on the cover, which helped it gain traction among the &quot;D&amp;D&quot; community. Not all creatures featured on covers have done as well; the firbolg appeared on the cover of 1983&#x27;s &quot;Monster Manual II&quot; and had as of 2007 slipped back into obscurity. It began to see a resurgence with the 5th edition of D&amp;D in 2016, when they became a playable race.

Monsters featured in the &quot;Folio&quot; were originally submitted by Stross, Ian Livingstone, and Tom Moldvay, among others. Interior illustrations were supplied by Chris Baker, Jeff Dee, Emmanuel (who also illustrated the cover), Albie Fiore, Alan Hunter, Russ Nicholson, Erol Otus, Jim Roslof, David C. Sutherland III, Bill Willingham, Polly Wilson, and Tony Yates.

The publication of &quot;Fiend Factory&quot; monsters had one unintended side-effect for Citadel Miniatures, who had the contract to produce gaming miniatures based on &quot;White Dwarf&quot; features. As a condition of including &quot;Factory&quot; monsters in the &quot;Folio&quot;, Games Workshop transferred the copyright on those monsters to TSR, who already had an exclusive contract with Grenadier Models. This forced Citadel to discontinue miniatures depicting &quot;Factory&quot; monsters that appeared in the &quot;Folio&quot;.

In 1983, TSR used the &quot;Monster Manual II&quot; to introduce a new orange spine cover design for hardcover &quot;AD&amp;D&quot; manuals. The &quot;Fiend Folio&quot; was the only &quot;AD&amp;D&quot; hardcover that did not have its cover redesigned to match the new style; instead, TSR let the &quot;Folio&quot; go out of print. In 1985, as TSR was getting ready to begin work on the &quot;AD&amp;D&quot; 2nd edition, Gary Gygax stated that he was planning to incorporate material from the &quot;Fiend Folio&quot; into a revised &quot;Monster Manual&quot; for the new edition. However, Gygax resigned from TSR in October 1986, before the second edition was produced.

In 1999, a paperback reprint of the first edition was released.

===&quot;Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; 2nd edition===
The &quot;Monstrous Compendium Fiend Folio Appendix&quot; () was published by TSR, Inc. in April 1992, for use with the 2nd edition &quot;AD&amp;D&quot; rules. It is the fourteenth volume of the &quot;Monstrous Compendium&quot; series (abbreviated &quot;MC14&quot;), consisting of a cardboard cover, sixty four loose-leaf pages, and four divider pages. Sometimes referred to simply as the &quot;Fiend Folio Appendix&quot;, it contains over sixty monsters created or updated by members of the RPGA, including revised versions of many monsters introduced in the original &quot;Fiend Folio&quot;.

===&quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; 3rd edition===
The third &quot;Fiend Folio&quot; () was designed by Eric Cagle, Jesse Decker, James Jacobs, Erik Mona, Matt Sernett, Chris Thomasson, and James Wyatt, and was published in April 2003 for use with the 3rd edition &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; rules. Cover art was by Brom and Henry Higginbotham, with interior art by Glen Angus, Darren Bader, Thomas Baxa, Matt Cavotta, Dennis Cramer, Larry Dixon, Jeff Easley, Scott Fischer, Lars Grant-West, Jeremy Jarvis, Todd Lockwood, Kevin McCann, Raven Mimura, Matthew Mitchell, Puddnhead, Wayne Reynolds, Richard Sardinha, Marc Sasso, Brian Snoddy, Arnie Swekel, Ben Templesmith, Anthony Waters, and Sam Wood. The 224-page hardcover manual includes only a few monsters from the original, but added many new creatures, with an emphasis on monsters with extraplanar origins. The book contains more than 150 monsters, with more than half of them being all-new.

The &quot;Fiend Folio&quot; was released before the 3rd edition rules were revised to the 3.5 edition; the book&#x27;s designers tried to foresee changes due to appear in the revised &quot;Monster Manual&quot; and implement them in the &quot;Fiend Folio&quot;. The &quot;extraplanar&quot; and &quot;swarm&quot; subtypes, and the allocation of skill points and feats to function the same way as they did for player characters, were introduced in this book, and then featured in the revised version of the &quot;Monster Manual&quot;. The book also introduced three prestige classes for fiends: fiend of blasphemy, fiend of corruption, and fiend of possession. This edition also introduced grafts and symbionts as new elements to the game; grafts are like living cybernetics and symbionts are living equipment.

The Fiend Folio also introduced two demons more powerful than balors: klurichirs and myrmyxicus. It also introduced a devil more powerful than pit fiends: the paeliryon.

Many of the creatures from the 1st edition &quot;Fiend Folio&quot; were updated to the d20 rules by Necromancer Games in their ENnie award winning &quot;Tome of Horrors&quot;.

==Reception==
TSR&#x27;s &quot;Dragon&quot; magazine featured two separate reviews of the book in issue #55 (November 1981). Ed Greenwood called the book a disappointment, citing its lack of detail and &quot;breaches of consistency&quot;. He felt that there were many incomplete or inadequate monster entries, and also criticized the book for having too many new undead and too many new races. Greenwood, however, did consider the slaad, elemental princes of evil, and penanggalan &quot;worthy additions to any campaign&quot; and noted that the previously published drow and kuo-toa were &quot;expected attractions, but good to see nonetheless.&quot; Contributor Alan Zumwait also reviewed the book, noting that a few of the inclusions were &quot;just &quot;Monster Manual&quot; creatures that are changed or crossbred with other monsters.&quot; He was pleased by the inclusion of the neutral Oriental dragons, but felt that their descriptions were inferior to those of the dragons in the &quot;Monster Manual&quot;. He also liked the slaad and elemental princes of evil, but felt they should both have counterparts of other alignments. Zumwait summed up his review by stating, &quot;the &quot;FIEND FOLIO&quot; Tome is like a basket of peaches: Most of it is pretty good stuff, but part of it is the pits.&quot; At the urging of Kim Mohan, Don Turnbull wrote a rebuttal, which was printed in the same issue. Turnbull cited the publication&#x27;s legal holdups, and the &quot;AD&amp;D&quot; game&#x27;s evolution during that time, as part of the reason for the work&#x27;s inconsistencies. He also felt that Greenwood&#x27;s concerns of incompleteness and inadequacy were a matter of subjective personal taste.

&quot;AD&amp;D&quot; creator Gary Gygax was also critical of errors in the book. Gygax noted that due to &quot;premature actions&quot;, TSR got &quot;the cart in advance of the horse&quot; by mentioning a spell (&quot;advanced illusion&quot;) and a magic item (the &quot;philosopher&#x27;s stone&quot;) which had not yet appeared in a game manual, promising they would eventually appear in game material in 1983. Gygax later commented on an individual who had criticized the &quot;Deities &amp; Demigods&quot; Cyclopedia, noting that this was the same individual responsible for errors on the &quot;Fiend Folio&quot;&#x27;s random encounter tables, among other errors.

The &quot;Fiend Folio&quot; was given an 8 out of 10 in the December 1981/January 1982 issue of &quot;White Dwarf&quot;. Reviewer Jamie Thomson compared it to the &quot;Monster Manual&quot; (&quot;MM&quot;) in format, and felt the &quot;Folio&quot;&#x27;s artwork was better. Thompson felt the biggest distinction was that while the &quot;MM&quot; was American, the &quot;Folio&quot; was of British origin. Creatures he commented on were the giant bat (&quot;seems an obvious choice for &quot;D&amp;D&quot;&quot;), the death dog (&quot;rumored to be a descendant of Cerberus&quot;), Lolth (&quot;which often appears on fantasy literature&quot;), the elemental princes of evil, and the drow (&quot;who figure prominently in a number of TSR dungeon modules&quot;). Also mentioned were the penanggalon, the caterwaul, the death knight, and the revenant. In summary, Thomson recommended the book for readers who wanted more monsters, but that if they did not already possess the &quot;MM&quot; it was not essential.

Lawrence Schick commented on the book&#x27;s contents in his 1991 book &quot;Heroic Worlds&quot;: &quot;Some of the monsters are &quot;really goofy&quot;—you&#x27;re sure to find several good belly laughs in this volume. A dozen or so entries are genuinely imaginative and useful.&quot;

In his 2023 book &quot;Monsters, Aliens, and Holes in the Ground&quot;, RPG historian Stu Horvath noted, &quot;while &quot;Fiend Folio&quot; was largely a dead-end for &quot;AD&amp;D&quot;, it is a glimpse into the future of a behemoth of a different sort ... All of these aesthetic choices would coalesce in the years to come in the Fighting Fantasy series of adventures gamebooks and in the many faces of Games Workshop&#x27;s gore-flecked, heavy metal-influenced &quot;Warhammer&quot; franchise.&quot;

<text>Ulrich von Jungingen (1360 – 15 July 1410) was the 26th Grand Master of the Teutonic Knights, serving from 1407 to 1410. His policy of confrontation with the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and the Kingdom of Poland would spark the Polish–Lithuanian–Teutonic War and lead to disaster for his Order, and his own death, at the Battle of Grunwald.
== Life ==
A scion of the Swabian noble house of Jungingen, he was probably born at Hohenfels Castle near Stockach, as the ancestral seat at Jungingen had been devastated in 1311. Ulrich and his elder brother Konrad von Jungingen, as younger sons excluded from succession, took the vow of the Teutonic Knights and moved to the Order&#x27;s State in Prussia. Ulrich resided in Schlochau (Człuchów) and was Komtur of Balga (1396–1404). His career profited from the patronage of his elder brother Konrad, who was elected Grand Master in 1393. After the Knights had expelled the Victual Brothers from Gotland in 1398, Ulrich distinguished himself in the negotiations for the possession of the island with Queen Margaret I of Denmark, as well as on diplomatic missions to Poland and to Lithuania in connection with the conclusion of the 1398 Treaty of Salynas concerning the Duchy of Samogitia.

In 1404 Ulrich was appointed the Order&#x27;s Marshal (i.e. military leader) and Komtur of Königsberg. He had to deal with several Samogitian uprisings, which he fought both with strict suppression and bribery of the local nobles. Upon the sudden death of Grand Master Konrad von Jungingen in 1407, Ulrich on 26 June, was chosen for his succession.

Unlike his brother, Ulrich&#x27;s diplomatic capability was limited. The situation in Samogitia remained tense, incited by Grand Duke Vytautas the Great, who intended to make use of the turmoils to regain the ceded lands. Furthermore, the new Grand Master had inherited the rising conflict with Vytautas&#x27; cousin King Jagiełło of Poland over Dobrzyń Land and the pawned Neumark region. The Polish ambassador Archbishop Mikołaj Kurowski declared, that any attack on Lithuania would inevitably entail an armed conflict with Poland. Despite the threat of a two-front war, Ulrich prepared for a preemptive strike. He forged an alliance with King Sigismund of Hungary, levied mercenaries in the Holy Roman Empire, and on 6 August 1409 declared war against Poland.

Though Ulrich received no help from his ally King Sigismund, who was stuck in the conflict with his cousin Jobst of Moravia over the election as King of the Romans, the Order&#x27;s forces at first successfully campaigned Dobrzyń and Kuyavia and laid siege to Bydgoszcz. Sigismund&#x27;s brother King Wenceslaus IV of Bohemia arranged a temporary truce and mediated between the belligerents, though without result. On 2 July 1410, the Grand Master at the head of his army left Malbork Castle for the final battle against the united Polish and Lithuanian forces. Both sides met on 15 July between the villages of Grunwald (&quot;Grünfelde&quot;) and Stębark (&quot;Tannenberg&quot;). As noontide approached, none of the armies made a move, until Ulrich, according to the annals of Jan Długosz, had two swords delivered to King Jagiełło with the remark that he and Vytautas may live or die by them.

This act, seen as a bold provocation, sparked the Polish-Lithuanian attack, at first repulsed by the Knights but soon followed by a second strike by Jagiełło&#x27;s forces. Battle luck changed, after Ulrich, sure of victory, decided to personally lead his remaining regiments against the Polish troops. He nearly got hold of the king, but at the same time lost oversight of the Order&#x27;s military operations. After the allied Prussian forces of the Lizard Union under Nicholas von Renys broke away, the Grand Master had to face the superior numbers of the Polish-Lithuanian union. When the Lithuanians attacked him from the rear, Ulrich&#x27;s troops were routed and he himself was killed in action. According to Polish chronicler Jan Długosz he was met and defeated by the Polish knight Mszczuj of Skrzynno. King Jagiełło arranged the transportation of his body to Malbork Castle before he began the Siege of Marienburg.

== Legacy ==
Based on Długosz&#x27;s description, later generations have imputed Ulrich von Jungingen with hot-bloodedness and arrogance. The painting &quot;Battle of Grunwald&quot; by Jan Matejko supposedly illustrates the moment when Ulrich, dressed in white with a black cross, trying to attack Grand Duke Vytautas, is killed by two Polish infantrymen, equipped with an executioner&#x27;s axe and a replica of the Holy Lance reminiscent of the Congress of Gniezno. The tradition was resumed by Henryk Sienkiewicz in his 1900 novel &quot;The Knights of the Cross&quot;, originally modeled on the measures of the Russian occupants in Vistula Land, describing Ulrich as an impulsive and aggressive commander. The book was made into a film by Aleksander Ford in 1960. On the other hand, 19th century German historiography portrayed Ulrich as a man of chivalric virtues, who succumbed to the cunning of his enemies, as rendered by the author Ernst Wichert in his novel &quot;Heinrich von Plauen&quot;.

Ulrich&#x27;s successor Heinrich von Plauen had a lady chapel erected on the former battlefield in 1413, which was probably destroyed by Lipka Tatar or Crimean Tatar forces campaigning in the region in 1656. In 1901 a glacial erratic (&quot;Jungingenstein&quot;), commemorating a &quot;hero&#x27;s death in the struggle for German spirit and German law&quot;, was set up at the behest of the German authorities in East Prussia. The stone is still in its place but has toppled over with the result that the inscription is no longer readable. A more recent second memorial stone nearby marks the place of Jungingen&#x27;s death (&quot;Miejsce śmierci Wielkiego Mistrza Ulricha von Jungingena&quot;). The surrounding area is today the site of an annual historical reenactment.

<text>Ixtlilxochitl II (c. 1500–c. 1550) was a Nahua nobleman, tlatoani of Texcoco. He allied with Spain during the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire and assisted Hernán Cortés during the Siege of Tenochtitlan. He converted to Christianity under the name of Fernando Cortés Ixtlilxóchitl and ruled Texcoco in Spain&#x27;s name until his death.

== Biography ==
In 1516 Nezahualpilli died, and the succession was contested by several of his sons, including Cacamatzin and Ixtlilxochitl. The former gained the support of Moctezuma II, Tlatoani of the Aztec Empire. A civil war ensued, and ended in a tripartite division of Tetzcoco, by which one third of the kingdom, with the capital, was awarded to Cacamatzin, the northern part to his brother Ixtlilxochitl, and the third part to another claimant to the throne. Ixtlilxochitl became from that time the enemy of Moctezuma II.

On the arrival of the Spaniards, the young leader sent an embassy to Hernán Cortés while he was at Tlaxcala, offering him his services and asking his aid in return. A joint army marched on the eastern side of the lake. Cacamatzin fled and was eventually deposed. Ixtlilxochitl eventually took the throne of all of Tetzcoco, but was now allied with Tlaxcala and the Spaniards against Tenochtitlan, its former ally. Ixtlilxochitl led Tetzcocan armies throughout the remaining the Spanish-Aztec Wars. His important services have been commemorated by the historians, who have given him significant credit in the conquest of Tenochtitlan.

After the defeat of Tenochtitlan, he was baptised and took the name of Hernan Cortés, after that of the conquistador, who was his godfather on this occasion. Afterward he took great interest in the propagation of Christianity, and supposedly brought in a bag the first stones to build the church of the convent of San Francisco in the city of Mexico. He accompanied Cortés on his expedition to Honduras in 1525 on which Cuauhtémoc was hanged for an alleged plot against Cortés. Ixtlilxochitl survived the expedition and probably returned overland to Central Mexico.

He threatened the people of Texcoco, including his mother Yacotzin, to convert to Christianity or be killed.

In the 17th century, Fernando de Alva Cortés Ixtlilxóchitl, his great-great-grandson, penned a history of Tetzcoco called the 13th relation of the Historical Compendium of the Kingdom of Texcoco, which defended Ixtlilxochitl and his actions. This history provides one of the most important indigenous views of the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire. The source presents Ixtlilxochitl as a central player in the war. In order to gain rights and privileges from the Spanish monarch, whose power had grown much over the previous century, is careful to depict Ixtlilxochitl as one of the first converts to Christianity in the Americas.

== &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; 5th edition ==
In 2022, Wizards of the Coast announced a new &quot;Monstrous Compendium&quot; series of 5th Edition supplements to be exclusively released on the online platform D&amp;D Beyond; some of these supplements are available for free to registered users.

==Reception==
Stephan Wieck reviewed &quot;Monster Compendium Volume One&quot; in &quot;White Wolf&quot; #17 (1989) and stated that &quot;Of the three new 2nd Edition books, the monster compendium is the one that I feel improves the most over its predecessor.&quot;

Berin Kinsman reviewed &quot;Terrors of the Desert&quot; in the Mar–Apr 1993 issue of &quot;White Wolf&quot;. This 96-page manual was written by Tom Prusa, Louis J. Prosperi, Walter M. Bass, and Kira Glass and is &quot;the first &quot;Monstrous Compendium&quot; appendix to deal with the AD&amp;D Dark Sun setting&quot;. Kinsman stated that it was &quot;an invaluable tool for Dungeon Masters running a game in this setting, and DMs who have included psionics in non-DARK SUN campaigns should look here for interesting challenges&quot;. He rated it overall at a 3 out of 5 possible points.

Rick Swan reviewed &quot;Ravenloft Monstrous Compendium Appendix II: Children of the Night&quot; for &quot;Dragon&quot; magazine #206 (June 1994). He commented on the proliferation of monster books from TSR and other publishers: &quot;Role-players seem to have an insatiable appetite for monsters. The sound you hear is that of publishers scraping the bottom of the barrel for new ones.&quot; Swan noted that &quot;Children of the Night&quot;, by William W. Connors, adds living brains, bardic liches, and half-golems to the Ravenloft roster. Reviewing this with two other monster books from two other publishers, he quipped: &quot;They&#x27;re all interesting, but I bet if I read you the descriptions, you&#x27;d be hard-pressed to tell which monsters belonged to which system.

Trenton Webb reviewed &quot;Planescape Monstrous Compendium Appendix II&quot; for &quot;Arcane&quot; magazine, rating it an 8 out of 10 overall. He commented that the book &quot;has a great cover and it&#x27;s a top read too&quot; and that the artwork &quot;isn&#x27;t exactly exactly inspired but it does sport a coherence and consistency rarely seen in roleplaying books. There are no &#x27;well it&#x27;s a man&#x27;s head on a chicken&#x27;s body&#x27; Crimewatch photofit embarrassments&#x27;&quot; found in many other monster books. Webb noted that the text &quot;goes out of its way to encourage adventurers to use this book as a foundation rather than a work of reference&quot; and that most of the descriptions feature quotes to add flavor, &quot;which normally involve the quotee being horribly killed&quot;. He felt that the blend and balance of the roughly 100 creatures in the book was good, &quot;with a lively mix of the lawful and chaotic, the mighty and meek&quot; but noted that the book &quot;does err slightly in favour of the more fearsome, more powerful creatures&quot;.

Trenton Webb reviewed &quot;Monstrous Compendium Annual Two&quot; for &quot;Arcane&quot; magazine, rating it a 7 out of 10 overall. He comments: &quot;Serious work goes into bringing the beasties to life, but the crippling list format means they limp rather than leap (or crawl, or slither, or fly for that matter) from the page. A fault this work compounds by further tweaking the experience points system. A factor that&#x27;s made all the more frustrating when it becomes apparent that the &quot;Monstrous Annual 2&quot; dangles some delightful creatures before the referee&#x27;s eyes.&quot; Ramshaw appreciated one creature entry above all the others, naming the &quot;star, without a shadow of a doubt&quot; as the shambling umpleby: &quot;Even without the Umpleby the &quot;Monstrous Annual 2&quot; would be a necessary resource for all mainstream refs. With the shaggy-haired one, though, it rapidly approaches the essential.&quot;

Trenton Webb reviewed &quot;Ravenloft Monstrous Compendium Appendices I &amp; II&quot; for &quot;Arcane&quot; magazine, rating it an 8 out of 10 overall. He noted that this product was a re-release of the first two &quot;Monstrous Compendium&quot; appendices for Ravenloft, in a single bound volume, and that &quot;Appendix I&quot; details &quot;the variants, updates and unique monsters which lurk in the Demiplane&#x27;s mists&quot; while &quot;Appendix II&quot; &quot;takes these new creatures and fleshes them out into full NPCs, expanding the descriptions in &quot;Appendix I&quot;&quot;. He commented that as a reference book, &quot;&quot;Appendix I&quot; does its job well enough. The true worth of the work, though, undoubtedly comes from the quality of &quot;Appendix II&quot;&#x27;s creations&quot; which &quot;offer referees a varied and rich source of legends to drop into their tavern conversations or to add colour to campaigns&quot;. Webb concluded his review by saying: &quot;All &quot;Appendices I &amp; II&quot; offer DMs who own the old loose leaf versions are a few new piccies and the tidy new bound form, which is all well and good but hardly enough to justify [the price]. But for &quot;Ravenloft&quot; DMs who&#x27;ve been struggling on without the compendiums, this re-issue is an essential purchase which offers both core reference material and an inspirational glimpse of the Demiplane&#x27;s dark heart.&quot;

David Comford reviewed &quot;Monstrous Compendium Annual Volume Three&quot; for &quot;Arcane&quot; magazine, rating it a 4 out of 10 overall. He commented that &quot;The strength of the annual is that the contents are drawn from a variety of &quot;AD&amp;D&quot; settings. Creatures from the TSR magazines, &quot;Forgotten Realms&quot;, &quot;Birthright&quot;, &quot;Ravenloft&quot;, &quot;Dark Sun&quot;, &quot;Al-Quadim&quot; and &quot;Greyhawk&quot; can be found giving referees access to monsters with abilities that otherwise might not have been thought of.&quot; However, he questioned, &quot;Are a few interesting ideas and cross-over scenarios worth over a tenner, though? Well, TSR has released such a stupefying amount of products to date that every referee should have a decent supply of challenging monsters available for them to use. If you don&#x27;t, then have a flick through this for a few new ideas, but think twice before you buy it.&quot; Comford concluded his review by saying, &quot;Volume three is a mixed bunch. Bar a few good entries it falls into a compilation of variations on a theme which, with a little time and imagination, most referees could come up with.&quot;

Alex Lucard, for Diehard GameFAN, highlighted the &quot;Spelljammer Monstrous Compendium MC7&quot; on a list of 2nd Edition products he would want rereleased on DNDClassics. He commented that &quot;I think the best &quot;Spelljammer&quot; piece to first put on DNDclassics.com would be with its first &quot;Monstrous Compendium&quot;. By taking a look at the wide range of creatures available to the setting, DMs would know if there was anything there to inspire them. [...] There are so many cool monsters in this book. [...] What veteran AD&amp;D 2e gamer hasn’t at least heard of the most infamous race of creatures TSR ever put out? [...] I know, as teens, we all laughed at the concept of a tyrannohamsterus rex – until we had to fight one&quot;.

<text>USS &quot;Breton&quot; (CVE-23) (previously AVG-23 then ACV-23) was a of the United States Navy. &quot;Breton&quot; was in service as an escort carrier from 1943 to 1946 and as an aircraft transport from 1958 to 1970.

&quot;Breton&quot; launched on 27 June 1942 by Seattle-Tacoma Shipbuilding of Tacoma, Washington under a Maritime Commission contract; sponsored by Mrs. A. H. Rooks, widow of Captain Albert Harold Rooks a posthumous Navy Medal of Honor recipient in World War II; and commissioned on 12 April 1943.

==Service history==
Throughout her World War II service, &quot;Breton&quot; operated with the Carrier Transport Squadron, Pacific Fleet. Her sailings carried her throughout the Pacific supplying men, materiel, and aircraft to units of the fleet engaged in making strikes on the enemy. While engaged in these duties, &quot;Breton&quot; took part in the capture and occupation of Saipan (11 June–10 August 1944); the Battle of the Philippine Sea (19–20 June); the 2nd Bonins raid (24 June); and the assault and occupation of Okinawa (6–7 April 1945).

Upon her return to the west coast in January 1946 after serving as a unit of the Far Eastern occupation forces, &quot;Breton&quot; prepared for inactivation at Tacoma, and went out of commission in reserve there on 30 August 1946. She was reclassified CVHE-23 on 12 June 1955. On 1 July 1958, she was redesignated as a utility carrier, CVU-23, and then again on 7 May 1959 as an aviation transport, T-AKV-42. &quot;Breton&quot; was put out of service in 1971 and stricken for disposal on 6 August 1972, where she was subsequently sold for scrap.

==Awards==
&quot;Breton&quot; received two battle stars for her World War II service.

<doc id="464221" wikidata="Q6509943" url="?curid=464221" title="Leap week calendar">
<text>A leap week calendar is a calendar system with a whole number of weeks in a year, and with every year starting on the same weekday. Most leap week calendars are proposed reforms to the civil calendar, in order to achieve a perennial calendar. Some, however, such as the ISO week date calendar, are simply conveniences for specific purposes.

The ISO calendar in question is a variation of the Gregorian calendar that is used (mainly) in government and business for fiscal years, as well as in timekeeping. In this system a year (ISO year) has 52 or 53 full weeks (364 or 371 days).

Leap week calendars vary on whether the concept of month is preserved and whether the month (if preserved) has a whole number of weeks. The Pax Calendar and Hanke–Henry Permanent Calendar preserve or modify the Gregorian month structure. The ISO week date is an example of a leap week calendar that eliminate the month.

A leap week calendar can take advantage of the 400-year cycle of the Gregorian calendar, as it has exactly 20,871 weeks: with 329 common years of 52 weeks plus 71 leap years of 53 weeks, a leap week calendar would synchronize with the Gregorian every 400 years since 

==Advantages==
* The calendar starts on the same day of the week every year; there are no fragments of weeks at the beginning or end of the year.
* Unlike the Gregorian Calendar, variations of years are limited to the possible addition of a leap week.
* Unlike certain proposed calendar reforms such as the World Calendar and International Fixed Calendar, there are no exceptions to the 7 day cycle of the week. This avoids opposition from religious groups who object to the interruption of the weekday sequence.

==Disadvantages==
* Although the calendar starts on the same day of the week every year, not all countries observe the same day as the start of their week. This will therefore present an issue if a leap week calendar is intended for use in multiple countries.
* A year with an intercalary/leap week is 7 days longer than a year without an intercalary week. Consequently, the equinoxes and solstices must vary over 7 days, i.e. ±3 of the average date, or even more, such as 19 days in the Pax Calendar.
* While persons born during the added intercalary week lose their real birthday in common years, similarly to those born on 29 February in the Gregorian calendar, approximately 1 in 294 days would belong to an intercalary week, compared to the approximately 1 in 1506 days that occur on 29 February.
* Leap year rules are more complicated than the Gregorian, since leap years are not at fixed intervals, meaning there is no simple approximation (i.e. one in four years): see Pax Calendar and and . The best comparable rule to Gregorian &quot;every fourth year, except when divisible by 100, unless also divisible by 400&quot; probably is &quot;every fifth year, except when divisible by 40, unless also divisible by 400&quot;, at the expense of even more severe astronomic jitter than rules with equal spread.
* Quarterly accounting statistics will not be consistent over multiple years due to the yearly quarter containing the intercalary week having 14 weeks instead of the usual 13. This issue could arguably be minimised by placing the intercalary week at the end of the year.

<text>Melanie Thandiwe Newton ( ; born 6 November 1972), formerly credited as Thandie Newton ( ), is a British actress. She has received various awards, including a Primetime Emmy Award, and a BAFTA Award, as well as nominations for two Golden Globe Awards. She was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2019 New Year Honours for services to film and charity.

Newton is known for starring roles such as the title character in &quot;Beloved&quot; (1998), Nyah Nordoff-Hall in &quot;&quot; (2000), Tiffany in &quot;Shade&quot; (2003), Dame Vaako in &quot;The Chronicles of Riddick&quot; (2004), Christine in &quot;Crash&quot; (2004), Linda in &quot;The Pursuit of Happyness&quot; (2006), Libby in &quot;Run Fatboy Run&quot; (2007), Stella in &quot;RocknRolla&quot; (2008), Condoleezza Rice in &quot;W.&quot; (2008), Laura Wilson in &quot;2012&quot; (2009), Tangie Adrose in &quot;For Colored Girls&quot; (2010), Maeve Millay in &quot;Westworld&quot; (2016–2022), Roz Huntley in &quot;Line of Duty&quot; (2017), and Val in &quot;&quot; (2018). She also voiced Mona in the Netflix adult animated sitcom &quot;Big Mouth&quot; (2019present) and its spinoff &quot;Human Resources&quot; (20212023).

== Early life and education ==
Melanie Thandiwe Newton was born in the Westminster area of London on 6 November 1972, the daughter of Zimbabwean mother Nyasha Jombe and English father Nick Newton. Her mother was a member of a Shona chieftaincy family, while her father worked as a laboratory technician and artist. Her parents lived in Zambia, and she was born whilst they were in England to visit relatives; they then returned to Zambia, where her younger brother was later born. This has led her birthplace to be incorrectly reported as Zambia in some sources, but she has confirmed in interviews that she was born in Westminster. &quot;Thandiwe&quot; is a name of Nguni origin and means &quot;beloved&quot;.

When Newton was three years old, she returned with her family to England, where they settled in Penzance so her father could help run his family&#x27;s antique business. She attended St Mary&#x27;s Roman Catholic Primary School. She later said of her upbringing, &quot;From about the age of five, I was aware that I didn&#x27;t fit. I was the black atheist kid in the all-white Catholic school run by nuns. I was an anomaly.&quot; She began dropping the letter &quot;w&quot; from her middle name, making it &quot;Thandie&quot; (pronounced ). She studied dance at the Tring Park School for the Performing Arts, then studied at Downing College, Cambridge, where she obtained a degree in social anthropology in 1995.

==Career==
=== 1991–1999: Early roles and breakthrough ===
Newton made her film debut in the coming of age comedy-drama &quot;Flirting&quot; (1991), filmed in 1989 but shelved for two years. She was credited as &quot;Thandie Newton&quot; and subsequently continued to use this name professionally. She then portrayed the slave &quot;Yvette&quot; in the Brad Pitt and Tom Cruise film &quot;Interview with the Vampire&quot; (1994). Newton appeared in the Merchant Ivory production of &quot;Jefferson in Paris&quot; as Sally Hemings. Next, she played in Jonathan Demme&#x27;s drama &quot;Beloved&quot; (1998), based on Toni Morrison&#x27;s novel, in which she played the title character, the ghost of a young slave girl whose mother kills her to save her from slavery. The film also starred Oprah Winfrey and Danny Glover. Newton starred as Nyah Nordoff-Hall, again opposite Cruise, in &quot;&quot;. Her next role was in the low-budget film &quot;It Was an Accident&quot;, written by her husband, screenwriter Ol Parker.

=== 2000–2015: &quot;Crash&quot; and other roles ===

Between 2003 and 2005, Newton played Makemba &quot;Kem&quot; Likasu, love interest of John Carter on the American television series &quot;ER&quot;. She reprised the role for the series finale in 2009. She took a supporting role as Dame Vaako in &quot;The Chronicles of Riddick&quot; (2004). She acted in the ensemble drama &quot;Crash&quot; acting opposite Terrence Howard, playing a woman who was groped by a police officer played by Matt Dillon. Her performance earned widespread acclaim earning her the BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role as well as a nomination with the cast for a Screen Actors Guild Award. She played Chris Gardner&#x27;s wife, Linda Gardner, in &quot;The Pursuit of Happyness&quot; opposite Will Smith. Also in 2006, Newton performed on radio in a pantomime version of &quot;Cinderella&quot;. 

In 2007, Newton co-starred with Eddie Murphy as his love interest in the comedy &quot;Norbit&quot;. She played opposite Simon Pegg as his ex-girlfriend in the 2007 comedy &quot;Run Fatboy Run&quot;. She next portrayed Condoleezza Rice, US National Security Advisor and then Secretary of State in &quot;W.&quot;, Oliver Stone&#x27;s biography of President George W. Bush. The film was released in October 2008. Newton was an introducer at Wembley Stadium on 7 July 2007, for the UK leg of Live Earth. She was due to introduce former US Vice President Al Gore to the concert, but he was delayed, leaving Newton to tell jokes in an attempt to entertain the audience. Newton next portrayed fictional US First Daughter Laura Wilson in &quot;2012&quot;, a disaster film directed by Roland Emmerich and released 13 November 2009. In July 2011, Newton delivered a TED talk on &quot;Embracing otherness, embracing myself.&quot; She discussed finding her &quot;otherness&quot; as a child growing up in two distinct cultures, and as an actress playing many different selves. She acted in Tyler Perry&#x27;s movie &quot;For Colored Girls&quot; (2010), adapted from Ntozake Shange&#x27;s 1975 original choreopoem &quot;for colored girls who have considered suicide / when the rainbow is enuf&quot;.

In 2012, she starred opposite Tyler Perry in his romantic drama film &quot;Good Deeds&quot;, the film was a moderate financial success but received negative reviews. That same year she made her West End debut playing Paulina Salas in the revival of the Ariel Dorfman play &quot;Death and the Maiden&quot; at the Harold Pinter Theatre. Kate Kellaway of &quot;The Guardian&quot; wrote of her performance, &quot;She has been completely miscast. She looks and sounds too immaculate. And the trouble is that, with a less than brilliant lead, the play&#x27;s contrivance starts to show through.&quot; In 2013, Newton starred in &quot;Rogue&quot;, the first original drama series for DirecTV&#x27;s Audience Network. She left &quot;Rogue&quot; during the third season. In 2015, she starred in the US miniseries &quot;The Slap&quot;.

=== 2016–present: &quot;Westworld&quot; and acclaim ===
From 2016 to 2022, Newton portrayed Maeve Millay in HBO science fiction drama series &quot;Westworld&quot;, for which she garnered universal acclaim. She received several accolades, including a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series (out of three nominations), two Critics’ Choice Awards, and nominations for a Golden Globe and Screen Actors Guild Award. James White for &quot;Empire&quot; lauded Newton&#x27;s performance, saying: &quot;Thandie Newton is killing these emotional moments, giving Maeve a twitchy, panicked air without ever overplaying it and really helping us to feel for her.&quot; William Goodman for &quot;Complex&quot; wrote: &quot;Westworld becomes the Thandie Newton show, which benefits everyone involved; she’s consistently electric, and the series gives her no shortage of fun things to do.&quot;

In 2017, she served as a narrator for the documentary entitled &quot;Bill Cosby: Fall of an American Icon&quot;, an exposé on the sexual assault charges laid against Cosby, which aired on BBC One. In the same year, Newton played DCI Roseanne &quot;Roz&quot; Huntley in the fourth season of BBC One&#x27;s &quot;Line of Duty&quot;, a role for which she received a BAFTA TV Award nomination for Best Actress.

Newton appeared as Val in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; film &quot;&quot;, which was released in May 2018 to generally favorable reviews but bombed at the box office with a worldwide gross of $393.2 million. Newton became the first black woman to have a major non-alien role in a &quot;Star Wars&quot; film; however, she expressed disappointment in the role as the fate of the character was changed during filming and found it to be a mistake for the franchise in the sense of what it meant for black women in the franchise. Additionally, Scott Mendelson for &quot;Forbes&quot; felt that Newton was &quot;underutilized&quot; and David Edelstein for &quot;Vulture&quot; wrote in praise of her performance: &quot;The only thing wrong with Thandie Newton’s performance is that there’s not enough of it.&quot;

In a 2021 interview, Newton announced that she would be changing her first name back to its original form &quot;Thandiwe&quot;, and would be credited as such beginning with &quot;Reminiscence&quot; (2021). She also said that she would attempt to have corrections applied to her past performance credits. In 2022, Newton played the lead role of Sandra Guidry in the thriller &quot;God’s Country&quot; which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival. For her performance in the film, she received a nomination for Outstanding Lead Performance at the Gotham Awards.

==Charity work==
In 2006, Newton contributed a foreword to &quot;We Wish: Hopes and Dreams of Cornwall&#x27;s Children&quot;, a book of children&#x27;s writing published in aid of the NSPCC. In it, she wrote about her childhood memories of growing up in Cornwall, and the way in which its cultural heritage made it easy for her to &quot;enrich every situation with layers of magic and meaning&quot;.

In 2008, Newton visited the poverty-stricken village of Nampasso in Mali, describing it as a &quot;humbling experience&quot;.

In 2013, Newton led the One Billion Rising flash mob in London for justice, gender equality, and an end to violence.

==Personal life==
=== Marriage and relationships ===
Newton married English filmmaker Ol Parker in 1998. They separated in 2022. They have two daughters, Ripley (born 2000) and Nico (born 2004), and a son, Booker (born 2014). All three were home births. Nico is also an actress. Newton has been close friends with Nicole Kidman since 1989. Newton is currently in a relationship with American musician Elijah Dias, better known by his stage name Lonr.

=== Activism and politics ===
Newton is a vegan and was named PETA&#x27;s &quot;Sexiest Vegan of 2014&quot; in the UK. In 2007, after Greenpeace members put a sticker that said &quot;this gas-guzzling 4x4 is causing climate change&quot; on the BMW X5 she had only recently purchased, she sold the car and bought a Toyota Prius. She has expressed an affinity for Buddhism. David Schwimmer, who directed &quot;Run Fatboy Run&quot;, called her &quot;the queen of practical jokes&quot; for her behaviour on film sets.

In 2016, Newton stated she had been the victim of a director who repeatedly showed his friends a video of her in a sexually graphic audition she had made as a teenager. She cited this experience as part of why she had taken the &quot;Westworld&quot; role, which involved substantial nudity and reflected experiences of survivors of sexual abuse while also asking moral questions about what it means to be human. In 2018, she said she was disappointed not to have been invited to participate in Time&#x27;s Up, a movement against sexual harassment, considering that she had been &quot;ostracised&quot; for having spoken out about alleged sexual abuse by a director.

Newton was ranked one of the best-dressed women in 2018 by fashion website Net-a-Porter. Later that year, she was named as one of the 100 most influential black British people in the &quot;Powerlist&quot;. In 2020, Newton was one of a number of celebrities and MPs who signed a letter opposing the deportation of 50 convicted offenders, including murderers and rapists, from the UK to Jamaica.

<text>USS &quot;Croatan&quot; (CVE-25) (previously AVG-25 then ACV-25) was a Bogue-class escort carrier launched on 1 August 1942 by the Seattle-Tacoma Shipbuilding Corporation of Seattle, Washington, under a Maritime Commission contract; sponsored by Mrs. J. S. Russell; and commissioned on 28 April 1943.

==Service history==
&quot;Croatan&quot; sailed from San Diego, California on 2 July 1943, and arrived at Norfolk, Virginia on 19 July. As the nucleus for a hunter-killer group, she sailed on 5 August for antisubmarine operations in the Atlantic covering the movement of convoys. Her planes had two skirmishes with surfaced submarines, and on 5 September initiated night flying operations from escort carriers. She returned to Norfolk on 22 September.

From 17 October-29 December 1943, &quot;Croatan&quot; made two voyages to Casablanca ferrying aircraft and plane crews for the North African operations. After another antisubmarine patrol from 14 January-27 February 1944, she took part in tests with the Naval Research Laboratory at Annapolis, Maryland. From 24 March-11 May, &quot;Croatan&quot; made a most successful patrol. On 7 April, her planes marked out the , which was sunk by her escorts and at . On the night of 25–26 April, her four escorts joined in sinking at . She was also successful in her patrol from 2 June-22 July. On 10 June, &quot;Croatan&quot;″s planes and escorts , &quot;Huse&quot;, and attacked and remained in constant contact with it, forcing it to surface the next day. Sixty survivors, including the commanding officer, were rescued before the submarine sank from scuttling charges at . Aircraft and escorts &quot;Frost&quot; and &quot;Inch&quot; combined again to sink on 3 July, at .

Following a brief overhaul and radar tests with the Naval Research Laboratory, &quot;Croatan&quot; put to sea again on 20 August 1944. On 15 September, she aided survivors from the destroyer which had foundered in a hurricane. Returning to Norfolk on 1 October, &quot;Croatan&quot; next sailed for antisubmarine training at Guantanamo Bay Naval Base and Bermuda, then proceeded to provide air cover for a high-speed east bound task force, returning to New York on 4 February 1945. For the next month, she qualified pilots in carrier operations, then sailed from Norfolk on 25 March to join a barrier line to intercept German submarines as part of Operation Teardrop. On 16 April, her escorts, &quot;Frost&quot; and sank and at . &quot;Croatan&quot; returned by way of Naval Station Argentia, Newfoundland to New York City on 14 May for overhaul.

From 15 September to 3 November, &quot;Croatan&quot; qualified aviators at Quonset Point, then cleared Norfolk on 23 November on the first of two transatlantic voyages to bring troops home from Le Havre, France.

&quot;Croatan&quot; was placed out of commission in reserve at Norfolk on 20 May 1946.

==USNS &quot;Croatan&quot;==

Reactivated, &quot;Croatan&quot; was assigned to the Military Sea Transportation Service in a noncommissioned status, manned by a civilian crew on 16 June 1958. In August 1963, she carried 23 F-104 Starfighters delivered to the Royal Norwegian Air Force 331 Squadron at Bodø, Norway. In March 1964 she carried also F-104 Starfighter and delivered to the Royal Hellenic Air Force. In October 1964, she served as an experimental ship under NASA control until May 1965. In August 1965, she helped transport helicopters for the US Army&#x27;s 1st Cavalry Division (Airmobile) to Vietnam. She was stricken for disposal on 15 September 1970 and sold for scrap in 1971.

<text>Laurence G. Hanscom Field , commonly known as Hanscom Field, is a public use airport operated by the Massachusetts Port Authority, located outside Boston in Bedford, Massachusetts, United States.

Hanscom is mainly a general aviation airport, the largest in New England. Both runways can accommodate jets, and are used by Hanscom Air Force Base, a defense-research facility next to Hanscom Field. It is a popular training airport, with more than 40 rental aircraft on the field. The Civil Air Terminal building hosts two flight schools. Transient general aviation planes are served by three FBOs: Jet Aviation, Atlantic Aviation, and Signature Aviation. 

It is also used sometimes by the Boston Bruins, Boston Celtics and Boston Red Sox, instead of Logan International Airport, for their charter flights to and from away contests. 

Federal Aviation Administration records say the airport had 10,956 passenger boardings (enplanements) in calendar year 2017. It is in the National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2021–2025, in which the FAA categories it as a &quot;non-primary commercial service&quot; airport (between 2,500 and 10,000 enplanements per year).

The field serves aircraft from Piper Cubs to Gulfstream V jets. The events of September 11 caused a number of changes to general aviation in the US (see Airport security repercussions due to the September 11 attacks). Hanscom Field saw changes implemented by Massport that included security fees, identification cards, and a requirement for propeller locks.

==Facilities and aircraft==

Hanscom Field covers at an elevation of above mean sea level.

It has two asphalt runways:

*Runway 11/29 is 
*Runway 5/23 is 

In the year ending September 30, 2021 the airport had 99,961 aircraft operations, an average of 274 per day: 81% general aviation, 18% air taxi, less than 1% military and less than 1% scheduled commercial. In April 2022, there were 252 aircraft based at this airport: 146 single-engine, 20 multi-engine, 75 jet and 11 helicopter.

In 2008, and many years prior, Hanscom had handled the second most aircraft movements of any airport in New England after Boston-Logan. On a nice weekend day the traffic pattern gets so busy the tower is known to close the traffic pattern and only allow full stop landings.

Hanscom Field&#x27;s traffic is primarily business jets and general aviation aircraft. The airport is served by a FAA control tower which operates between the hours of to . Massport assesses a nighttime field use fee for takeoffs or landings conducted outside of the tower operating hours.

==Airlines and destinations==
Under Massport regulations adopted in 1980 (Part F of the General Rules and Regulations for Laurence G. Hanscom Field), scheduled commercial operations are limited to aircraft with up to 60 seats.

Shuttle America, a Connecticut-based regional airline, operated scheduled service from the airfield from 1999 until 2004, carrying more than 10,000 passengers each month to Buffalo, New York; Hartford, Connecticut; New York LaGuardia; Trenton, New Jersey; and Greensboro, North Carolina, using De Havilland Dash 8-300 aircraft. In 2001 Shuttle America became a US Airways Express feeder carrier on behalf of US Airways providing service to Philadelphia and Trenton until service ended in 2004. De Havilland Dash 8 and Saab 340 aircraft were used in the latter years.

Boston-Maine Airways, dba Pan Am Clipper Connection began servicing the airport in 2002 using Jetstream 31 aircraft. Clipper flights connected Hanscom Field with Pease Airport in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, and Trenton–Mercer Airport in New Jersey. In its final years, Clipper added flights from Hanscom to Ithaca-Tompkins Regional Airport in Central New York. Even with this new route, Clipper could never draw the numbers it needed to remain profitable. The airline was forced to cease operation in 2008 by the FAA for lack of funding and management. That left Hanscom Field without scheduled airline service for the first time in a decade.

In 2011, Trenton-based airline Streamline Air began its first public charter route to Hanscom using 30-seat Embraer EMB 120 Brasilia aircraft, beginning with two daily round trips on weekdays. Streamline ceased operations on September 15, 2012.

In the spring of 2021, Southern Airways Express announced that they were replacing their Hyannis-Nantucket route with a Bedford/Hanscom Field-Nantucket route beginning May 26, 2021. This was the first scheduled passenger service out of Hanscom Field in almost a decade.

==Notable events at Hanscom Field==
On 8 August 1962, a U.S. Air Force Boeing KC-135 Stratotanker, a modified former tanker, crashed on approach to Hanscom Field&#x27;s runway 11, destroying the aircraft and killing all three members of the flight crew.

In September 1964, The Beatles arrived at Hanscom Field aboard a chartered aircraft during one of their American concert tours. They were making an appearance at Boston Garden the following day. It was felt that the immense popularity of the British singing group would cause congestion at Boston-Logan International Airport, so this alternative airport was selected.

On 24 November 1988, George Koskotas, who fled Greece after being indicted on five counts of forgery and embezzlement for the Koskotas scandal, was apprehended by the FBI at Hanscom Field after landing in a private jet with his family.

On 31 May 2014, a private Gulfstream IV business jet crashed and caught fire beyond the end of runway 11 following an aborted take off from Hanscom Field, killing all seven people on board. A preliminary NTSB report suggests that the flight controls were locked, preventing the aircraft from rotating to take off. Lewis Katz, co-owner of the &quot;Philadelphia Inquirer&quot;, the &quot;Philadelphia Daily News&quot;, and Philly.com, was among the dead.

On June 2, 2017, actor Harrison Ford landed at Hanscom prior to spending the weekend in Boston.

<doc id="464234" wikidata="Q162562" url="?curid=464234" title="Soul Blazer">
<text>Soul Blazer, released in Japan as is an action role-playing video game developed by Quintet and published by Enix for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. It was released in 1992 in Japan and North America, but not released in Europe until 1994. It was not released in the United Kingdom.

It is an action role-playing game where the player takes the role of The Master&#x27;s servant, to destroy monsters and release the captured souls of a world&#x27;s inhabitants. The servant can be named by the player, but in a later game developed by Quintet, &quot;Illusion of Gaia&quot;, he is referred to as &quot;Blazer&quot;.

==Gameplay==

The player frees a series of towns by fighting monsters in traditional dungeon crawl battles. Destroying monster lairs in the dungeons causes a soul belonging to a former town occupant to be liberated and reincarnated. This is often a human, but it could be anything from a dolphin to a talking tulip. As souls are freed, the town is reconstructed around the people. The new town occupants give the player advice and items. When the player defeats the boss monster imprisoning the soul of the head of each town, the area is cleared and the player can continue. After the hero frees the first six villages, he is granted access to the &quot;World of Evil&quot;, where the final villain awaits.

==Plot==
The Master sends one of his heavenly divine companions in the form of a human warrior to the Freil Empire, where the evil spirit Deathtoll has destroyed all villages and incarcerated the souls of all living creatures in his monster lairs, leaving the world empty. The warrior must defeat the monsters and liberate the inhabitants from the lairs, gradually repopulating the kingdom.

The Hero (Blazer) is the protagonist, a divine angel, deity or lesser-deity, or avatar, sent by The Master to restore the world&#x27;s creatures to life. Skilled with a sword and possessing the ability to speak with any living thing and be understood, he battles the hordes of Deathtoll with the assistance of his Soul helpers. 

The warrior travels throughout the kingdom, defeating monsters in each of six regions to gather six magic stones, each a different color, in order to open the path to Deathtoll, who now resides in the World of Evil. The warrior must also find three sacred artifacts to call upon the power of the phoenix to defeat Deathtoll.

On the way, the warrior falls in love with Lisa, the daughter of a brilliant inventor named Dr. Leo. The warrior learns that the world&#x27;s devastation came about after King Magridd imprisoned Dr. Leo and forced him to make a machine to contact Deathtoll. After being summoned, Deathtoll offered the king a gold piece for each soul from his kingdom, and under the counsel of his wife, Magridd agreed, but was eventually imprisoned himself. Dr. Leo is still in Magridd Castle&#x27;s prison after the warrior frees him, and Leo later sacrifices his life to kill the queen, who still wanted to bargain with Deathtoll.

After reaching the World of Evil and defeating Deathtoll, the warrior is returned to Heaven, but one year later, the Master realizes that the warrior misses his life as a human, and agrees to send him back to the Freil Empire, but under the condition that the hero would not have any memory of his past. The hero wakes up in Grass Valley, where Lisa recognizes him. Though he does not remember her, they leave together and renew their friendship.

== Development and release==
&quot;Soul Blazer&quot; was released on January 31, 1992 in Japan, on November 27 in North America, and on January 27, 1994 in Europe.

The soundtrack of the game was composed by Yukihide Takekawa. It was published in Japan by the record label Apollon on February 21, 1992.

The game has never been re-released in any form.

== Reception ==
Quintet reported that &quot;Soul Blazer&quot; sold 200,000 copies in Japan, 70,000 copies in North America, and 25,000 copies in Europe, adding up to 295,000 cartridges sold worldwide.

Upon release, &quot;Famitsu&quot; magazine&#x27;s four reviewers scored the game 32 out of 40. &quot;Game Informer&quot; magazine reviewed the game in 1992, with its three reviewers scoring it 8.5, 8.75 and 8.5 out of 10. In its first issue, &quot;GameFan&quot;″s two reviewers scored it 95% and 92%. &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot;″s four reviewers scored it 8, 9, 8 and 8 out of 10, and gave it the Editor&#x27;s Choice Gold award. They compared it favorably with &quot;The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past&quot;, with one of the reviewers stating that &quot;Soul Blazer&quot; is equally challenging and fun to play. &quot;Dragon&quot; gave the game 3 out of 5 stars. M! Games gave it 78%. 

IGN ranked &quot;Soul Blazer&quot; 76th on its &quot;Top 100 SNES Games of All Time&quot; describing the game as bold and memorable. In 1995, Total! listed the game 35th in their &quot;Top 100 SNES Games&quot;, commenting its game size, graphics and strong storyline.

== Legacy ==
Although it is usually considered part of the unofficial &quot;Gaia trilogy&quot;, according to the producer of Enix USA, there is no connection between &quot;Soul Blazer&quot; and &quot;Gaia&quot;. &quot;Soul Blazer&quot; is instead related to &quot;ActRaiser&quot;, thus acting as &quot;a sort of prequel&quot; to the latter title.

Game journalists and fans often considered &quot;Soul Blazer&quot; to be the first in an unofficial series followed by &quot;Illusion of Gaia&quot; and &quot;Terranigma&quot;. This series is nicknamed either &quot;Quintet Trilogy&quot;, &quot;Gaia Trilogy&quot; or &quot;Heaven and Earth Trilogy&quot; (after &quot;Terranigma&quot;&#x27;s Japanese title, which translates to &quot;the creation of Heaven and Earth&quot;) by fans. &quot;The Granstream Saga&quot; is an intended spiritual successor of the series, as it was developed by Shade (a studio composed of former Quintet personnel), has similar themes, and makes references to the previous titles.

<doc id="464238" wikidata="Q550430" url="?curid=464238" title="Gen Con">
<text>Gen Con is the largest tabletop game convention in North America by both attendance and number of events. It features traditional pen-and-paper, board, and card games, including role-playing games, miniatures wargames, live action role-playing games, collectible card games, and strategy games. Gen Con also features computer games. Attendees engage in a variety of tournament and interactive game sessions. In 2019, Gen Con had nearly 70,000 unique attendees.

Established in 1968 as the Lake Geneva Wargames Convention by Gary Gygax, who later co-created &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;, Gen Con was first held in Lake Geneva, Wisconsin. The convention was moved to various locations in Wisconsin from 1972 to 1984 before becoming fixed in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in 1985, where it remained until moving to Indianapolis, Indiana, in 2003. Other Gen Con conventions have been held sporadically in various locations around the United States, as well as internationally.

In 1976, Gen Con became the property of TSR, Inc., the gaming company co-founded by Gary Gygax. TSR (and Gen Con) were then acquired by Wizards of the Coast in 1997, which was subsequently acquired by Hasbro. Hasbro then sold Gen Con to the former CEO of Wizards of the Coast, Peter Adkison, in 2002. Gen Con spent a short time under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, due to a lawsuit brought against them by Lucasfilm in 2008. The organization emerged from bankruptcy protection a year later, while still holding its regularly scheduled events and became larger than ever.

== History ==

=== Early years ===
The International Federation of Wargaming (IFW) hosted a number of small regional conventions in the months following its foundation in 1967, including the first annual club convention in Malvern, Pennsylvania, in August. Some IFW gamers in the Chicago area could not make the journey to Malvern, so they had an informal gathering that same weekend at the Lake Geneva, Wisconsin home of Gary Gygax. Later this gathering would come to be referred to as &quot;Gen Con 0&quot;. In 1968, Gygax rented Lake Geneva&#x27;s Horticultural Hall to hold a follow-up IFW convention, the Lake Geneva Wargames Convention, later known as the Gen Con gaming convention. The IFW, which Gygax co-founded, put up $35 of the $50 Horticultural Hall fee to sponsor this first Gen Con. Almost 100 people attended. At the second Gen Con in August 1969, Gygax met Rob Kuntz and Dave Arneson. During these early conventions, the events centered around board games and miniature wargames.

Gen Con&#x27;s name is a derivation of &quot;Geneva Convention&quot;, due to the convention&#x27;s origins in Lake Geneva. It is also a play on words, as the &quot;Geneva Conventions&quot; are a set of important international treaties regarding war, the subject of many of the early games. Starting in 1971, Gen Con was cosponsored by the Lake Geneva Tactical Studies Association.

=== TSR ===
Beginning in 1975, Gen Con was managed and hosted by TSR, Inc., original publisher of the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; role-playing game. During the following decade the event grew and was hosted at a variety of southern Wisconsin locations, including an American Legion Hall, George Williams College, and the former Lake Geneva Playboy Resort. In 1978 the convention moved to the University of Wisconsin–Parkside campus in Kenosha, where it remained through 1984.

A Gen Con West was held in California for only three years, 1976–1978. From 1978 to 1984, Gen Con South was held in Jacksonville, Florida, and Gen Con East was held in 1981 and 1982, first in Cherry Hill, New Jersey, and then in Chester, Pennsylvania.

=== MECCA ===
In 1985, Gen Con moved to the Milwaukee Exposition &amp; Convention Center &amp; Arena (MECCA) in Milwaukee, due to a need for more space. After the move, attendance steadily rose from 5,000 to a peak of 30,000 in 1995, making Gen Con the premier event in the role-playing game industry. In 1992, Gen Con broke every previous attendance record for game conventions in the United States, with more than 18,000 people. Gen Con briefly joined with its primary competitor, the Origins Game Fair, and the two were run as a single convention in 1988. Wizards of the Coast debuted &quot;&quot; at Gen Con in August 1993; the game proved extremely popular, selling out its supply of 2.5 million cards, which had been scheduled to last until the end of the year. The ensuing collectible card game craze has been credited with generating the extra attendance that produced the 1995 record.

=== Wizards of the Coast ===
Wizards of the Coast purchased TSR in 1997, which was in turn purchased by Hasbro in 1999. Gen Con moved to the Midwest Express Center (now the Wisconsin Center) in 1998. In November 1999 Wizards announced that Gen Con would leave Milwaukee after the 2002 convention. Peter Adkison, founder of Wizards of the Coast, purchased Gen Con from Hasbro in May 2002, forming Gen Con LLC to run the convention. The first show under Adkison&#x27;s leadership took place that August in Milwaukee.

=== Indianapolis ===
The convention moved to Indianapolis in 2003. Peter Adkison attributed the move to the lack of hotel space, the convention center layout, and frequently broken escalators in Milwaukee&#x27;s convention center.
In Indianapolis, the convention, now called Gen Con Indy, continued to draw between 20,000 and 30,000 visitors each year, at the Indiana Convention Center. Wizards of the Coast helped celebrate the 30th anniversary of the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; game at Gen Con Indy 2004. In 2005 Gen Con Indy generated the most direct visitor spending of any annual convention in Indianapolis.

Adkison also restarted the convention in California, this time named Gen Con SoCal. Smaller than its mid-western counterpart, it drew approximately 6,300 attendees in 2005, making it the third-largest consumer hobby game convention in North America. It was held in the Anaheim Convention Center.

In spite of Adkison saying that he did not want Gen Con to become a &quot;mini-E3&quot; in 2003, when E3 downsized in mid-2006, Gen Con LLC announced it would provide more show space for video game businesses. Gen Con described their intention to &quot;pick up where E3 [left] off&quot;.

Also in 2006, Gen Con LLC ran the official &quot;Star Wars&quot; convention, called &quot;Star Wars&quot; Celebration, which was held in the banner years of the franchise.

The Indiana Convention Center completed a major expansion in 2011, in large part, to accommodate increased attendance to Gen Con, at a cost of over $275 million.

=== International ===
Gen Con was held in Europe in the 1990s, with the first annual European Gen Con held in Camber Sands, Sussex, England, in 1990, and Gen Con Barcelona in Spain in 1994. The European convention was held in England for 8 years, eventually migrating from Camber Sands in the mid-1990s to Loughborough, where the final UK-based European event was held in 1997; the same weekend on which Princess Diana died. There was no European Gen Con in 1998, but it reappeared in Belgium in 1999 for a single year, before again reappearing in Paris for three years between 2006 and 2008. Benelux Gen Con was held in the Netherlands in 1998 and re-occurred there in 2000. Gen Con Barcelona occurred five years, in 1994–1996, 1999, and 2004. Gen Con UK was held between 1998 and 2005. A Gen Con was held in Brisbane, Australia, in July 2008 and again in September 2009. A third Gen Con Australia was scheduled for 2010, but was cancelled.

=== Online ===
When the COVID-19 lockdown prompted Gen Con to cancel the in-person convention in 2020, it instead ran an online version. While the in-person convention returned the following year, an online version was run concurrently until Gen Con ceased operations of Gen Con Online after the 2023 show.

== Events ==
The convention features a large exhibit hall filled with game publishers, artists, and related businesses, wherein most attendees spend at least $100. The only game to be on the event schedule every year since the convention&#x27;s inception is &quot;Fight in the Skies&quot;, later renamed &quot;Dawn Patrol&quot;.

The &quot;D&amp;D&quot; Championship Series (formerly the &quot;D&amp;D&quot; Open) is a long-running series of &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; games at Gen Con, beginning in 1977. The RPGA, beginning in 1981, has run large numbers of events at Gen Con, so extensive they have been given their own category. The RPGA events are primarily &quot;Living&quot; games where players create characters who persist between events. The RPGA first ran events in 1981.
In 1987 a games library was added from which attendees could borrow games. Appearing in 1994 was the first , won by Zak Dolan, who defeated France&#x27;s Bertrand Lestrée in the finals.

Gen Con has featured a number of events that raise money for a variety of charities. These include Cardhalla, in which donated cards are used to build a large city. Attendees are then invited to throw coins at the city to destroy it. The coins are collected for charity. Cardhalla was first run in 1999. The gaming group NASCRAG has run &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; events at Gen Con since 1980. NASCRAG events sometimes donate their ticket fees to charity. The games run tend to be humorous. The Gen Con Live Games Auction is another long-running event, though the majority of the Auction (including the Consignment Store) is not run for charity.

The EN World RPG Awards (the ENnies) are an annual awards ceremony devoted to role-playing games. Established in 2001, the ENnies have been hosted at Gen Con Indy since 2002, and are organized and owned by EN World, a &quot;D&amp;D&quot;/d20 System news website.

&quot;True Dungeon&quot; is an immersive life-sized dungeon crawl live action role-playing game (LARP) run at Gen Con since 2003, featuring a series of puzzles and scenarios designed to recreate a &quot;D&amp;D&quot; environment.

== Issues ==
2008 was a tumultuous year, legally, for Gen Con LLC. On January 10, Lucasfilm filed a lawsuit against them, claiming breach of contract, conversion, and unjust enrichment over Celebration IV, held in 2006. The suit also claims Gen Con failed to give the money raised at a charity auction held at the event to the Make-A-Wish Foundation. Gen Con filed a counter-suit claiming Lucasfilm had no basis for their claims and owed money to Gen Con.

On February 15, 2008, Gen Con LLC announced that it had filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, citing &quot;significant unforeseen expenses associated with ... externally licensed events&quot;. As a result of the bankruptcy filing, the Lucasfilm lawsuit was delayed until November 19, 2008. Gen Con Indy 2008 was held as planned.

On November 20, 2008, a letter of intent to purchase Gen Con LLC&#x27;s assets was filed with the bankruptcy court. It announced that a to-be-formed company called Gen Con Acquisition Group would purchase Gen Con LLC., for an amount equal to Gen Con LLC&#x27;s outstanding debt. Gen Con&#x27;s president, Adrian Swartout, described the letter as &quot;suspiciously cryptic&quot; and concluded that the offer &quot;is not in the best interest of our creditors&quot;. Gen Con rejected the hostile takeover bid, and the bankruptcy court allowed Gen Con to emerge from bankruptcy in January 2009, 11 months after it had entered Chapter 11.

In 2008, Christian Children&#x27;s Fund was reported to have turned down $17,398 from a GenCon Live Game Auction, during that year&#x27;s Gen Con. The donation was made in honor of Gary Gygax, who died in 2008, and was a frequent donor to CCF. Some individuals within the gaming community expressed disappointment about the decision; author and game designer Rich Burlew, for example, called it &quot;insulting,&quot; and the response by gamers led both the CCF and Gen Con to issue official statements explaining what had happened. As a result of the misunderstanding, Gen Con chose to support a different charity.

On March 23, 2015, Adrian Swartout sent a letter to Indiana Governor Mike Pence, asking the governor to reconsider his intent to sign SB 101, the so-called &quot;Religious Freedom&quot; bill that already passed both state legislatures. The bill would allow businesses in the state to deny service to anyone on religious grounds, with opponents of the bill stating that it would allow businesses to unfairly single out and discriminate against the LGBT community and other groups. Swartout pointed out in the letter that &quot;Gen Con proudly welcomes a diverse attendee base, made up of different ethnicities, cultures, beliefs, sexual orientations, gender identities, abilities, and socio-economic backgrounds&quot; from over 40 countries and all 50 states, and that welcoming such a &quot;wide-ranging diversity has been a key element to the success and growth of our convention&quot;, as well as injecting &quot;over $50 million dollars&quot; annually to the local economy. Swartout stated that signing such a bill &quot;will have a direct negative impact on the state economy and factor into [Gen Con&#x27;s] decision-making on hosting the convention in the state of Indiana in future years,&quot; after the Indiana Convention Center had already completed a major expansion in 2011 to accommodate increased attendance to Gen Con. Pence signed SB 101 into effect on March 26, 2015.

In August 2022 when Indiana passed a near total ban on abortions, Gen Con tweeted a statement in support of abortion rights, and Gen Con president David Hoppe made the following statement: &quot;Passage of Senate Bill 1 will have an impact on our stakeholders and attendees and will make it more difficult for us to remain committed to Indiana for our long-term home. We are committed here through 2026. We do have to think about what that means beyond that and, of course, we would have to look at what that means for the period up until that time.&quot;

<text>Alexander Lippisch&#x27;s Delta IV was a continuation of his work on delta wing designs pioneered in his Delta I, Delta II and Delta III aircraft.

==Design and development==
===Fieseler F 3 &quot;Wespe&quot;===
The project began with an order from Gerhard Fieseler for a design that his company could build for him to fly in the 1932 Europarundflug air rally. The result was a highly unorthodox design, sporting large delta wings, canards, and an engine and propeller mounted in both the nose and tail of the plane.

Fieseler built this design as the F 3 &quot;Wespe&quot; (&quot;Wasp&quot;), but it proved highly unstable, causing Fieseler to crash it on his first flight. Further refinements were unable to correct these deficiencies, and after one final crash, Fieseler abandoned the aircraft.

===DFS 39===
Lippisch continued to believe that the problems were surmountable, and found an ally in Professor Walter Georgii of the DFS (&quot;Deutsche Forschungsanstalt für Segelflug&quot; – German Research Institute for Sailplane Flight). Georgii secured funding from the RLM (&quot;Reichsluftfahrtministerium&quot; – Reich Air Ministry) to purchase the aircraft from Fieseler and work on perfecting it. At the DFS, Lippisch rebuilt the aircraft, removing the canards and the rear engine and renaming it the Delta IVa.

Although this flew much better than its predecessor, it was still involved in a very serious crash which led to an investigation of Lippisch&#x27;s endeavours. The RLM and the DVL (&quot;Deutsche Versuchsanstalt für Luftfahrt&quot; – German Aviation Research Institute) eventually concluded that the Delta series was not only dangerous, but an aeronautical dead end. Only Georgii&#x27;s continued support prevented them from ordering the discontinuation of the research.

The aircraft was rebuilt again, this time incorporating new aerodynamic refinements based on Lippisch&#x27;s experiences with his recent Storch X glider. The new incarnation, dubbed Delta IVb proved to be a step in the right direction.

Success finally came with a last round of changes. The aircraft was rebuilt yet again, making the sweep of its wings less severe, and adding small, downturned fins at their tips. The fuselage was lengthened somewhat, and a small rudder was added to it. Now called the Delta IVc, the result was finally what Lippisch had been looking for. In 1936, the aircraft was taken to the Luftwaffe flight-testing centre at Rechlin where test pilot Heini Dittmar put it through its paces, gaining an airworthiness certificate for the type and an official RLM designation – DFS 39.

===Messerschmitt Me 163===
It proved to be an extremely stable and well-behaved design, and now attracted the interest of the RLM as the basis for a rocket-powered research aircraft. The work was kept secret and the new variant of the Delta IV referred to as &quot;Project X&quot;. The airframe was to make significant use of metal construction, which was not available at the DFS, so Lippisch and &quot;Projekt X&quot; were transferred to Messerschmitt. It was redesignated the Me 163 and would eventually appear as the Messerschmitt Me 163 Komet rocket fighter.

<text>is a 1990 video game developed by Quintet and published by Enix for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, It combines traditional side-scrolling platforming and sections with city building and god game elements. A sequel, &quot;ActRaiser 2&quot;, was released for the Super NES in 1993. In 2007, &quot;ActRaiser&quot; became available on the Wii&#x27;s Virtual Console download service in Europe, North America, and Japan. A version of the game was also released for European mobile phones in 2004. A remake, &quot;Actraiser Renaissance&quot;, was released for several platforms in 2021.

==Gameplay==

The player plays as &quot;The Master&quot;, the main protagonist of the game. Although the Master is never directly controlled, the player interacts with the world by controlling an angel and an animated statue. The player plays as an angel during the simulation sequences of the game, and as the statue during the action sequences.

The overhead-view simulation mode involves protecting and guiding the Master&#x27;s new civilization towards prosperity, beginning with two humans. This portion of the game requires the player to take actions that encourage the growth of the population, including road planning and using lightning, rain, sunlight, wind, and earthquakes as miracles. The Angel can interact with the monsters in the area by shooting them with arrows as well as aid the Master by indicating where to build and use miracles.

One obstacle in the simulation mode is the presence of flying monsters that attempt to impede the progression of a civilization. The monsters originate from four lairs around the region at the beginning of each level. They continuously spawn the creatures as the servant kills them. As the population expands, it can seal the lairs of monsters, which prevents them from spawning, and eventually eliminate all the flying monsters in the land. Doing so increases the civilization level of the region, allowing more advanced structures to be built and increasing the potential population. Once all four lairs have been sealed the population will begin to build the most advanced homes available to the people in that region. The Master levels up by increasing the total population of the world, granting an increase in hit points and SP, used in performing miracles.

Each area has two side-scrolling action sequences, one before the building simulation and near the end. In the action sequences, the player controls a humanlike statue brought to life by the Master. The player must jump from platform to platform while defeating monsters to accrue a score. At the end of each action sequence, the player must defeat a boss.

The final level is an action-sequence boss marathon, culminating in the final fight against Tanzra.

==Plot==
The plot follows a godlike being known only as &quot;The Master&quot; (God in the Japanese version) in his fight against Tanzra (Satan in the Japanese version), also referred to as &quot;The Evil One&quot;. According to the instruction booklet, The Master was defeated in a battle with Tanzra and his six lieutenants. The Master retreated to his sky palace to tend to his wounds and fell into a deep sleep. In the Master&#x27;s absence, Tanzra divided the world into six lands, one for each of his lieutenants; they later turned the people to evil.

After several hundred years, the Master awakens fully recovered to discover that he has lost his powers due to the lack of belief in him. As the game progresses, the Master defeats Tanzra&#x27;s lieutenants and recovers his powers by rebuilding the civilizations of his people and communicating with them through prayer. After all lieutenants have been slain, the Master commences an assault on Tanzra&#x27;s stronghold, Death Heim, eventually defeating him.

After the defeat of Tanzra, The Master and his servant revisit the many civilizations that they had helped to build and observe the people. During their observations, they note that nobody is at the temple worshiping the Master. The servant observes that, although the people once prayed to the Master in times of trouble, they no longer feel a need to because they are able to solve their remaining problems on their own. The Master and his servant then enter the sky palace and depart into the heavens to await a time when they may be needed.

==Development==
===Religious subtext===
The game is seen as an allegory for Judeo-Christian monotheism. In the original Japanese version, the protagonist&#x27;s name is God and the antagonist is referred to as Satan. According to Douglas Crockford&#x27;s &quot;Expurgation of Maniac Mansion&quot;, Nintendo of America had a strict policy regarding game content in the early 1990s, especially in regards to material that could be deemed offensive, a blanket category that prohibited the inclusion of any overtly religious themes or plotlines in a game. Hence, the main character of the game was renamed &quot;The Master&quot;, although the allegory remains, as he travels the globe in a palace on a cloud, accompanied by an angel; slays demons; creates life; performs miracles; and is prayed to by the populace of the world. The bosses are based on real-world religion or mythology, such as Greek mythology and Hinduism. The concept of religion is further explored at the end of the game, when the Angel and &quot;Master&quot; discover that the temples of the world have become empty, people having lost their concept of faith and need for a deity now that they had been given all they needed to solve problems on their own. They leave the planet, to come back if needed.

===Version differences===
Further changes were made for the game&#x27;s North American release. The game&#x27;s title was slightly changed to &quot;ActRaiser&quot;, with a new logo. Monster Lairs were now indicated by skull-like symbols (changed from Stars of David). Action segments possess an overall easier level design, enemies were given new attacks, spells require less magic to cast, spike pits do not instantly kill the player, and more time is given to finish each segment. Meanwhile the simulation segments have been made difficult and is difficult to reach the maximum experience level in this version. Finally, there is a &quot;Professional!&quot; mode, unlocked after completing the game, containing only the action segments with a level design similar to the original Japanese release.

European releases use changes from the North American version as a base. The Professional! mode, now called the &quot;Action&quot; mode, is available from the start. Both the original &quot;Story&quot; mode and this Action mode now have three difficulties. The action segments in the Normal and Expert settings for Story mode resemble the action segments from the previous North American and Japanese main modes respectively, while the new Beginner setting is even easier than Normal. The Normal setting for Action mode resembles the North American Professional! mode. Beginner mode resembles the North American main mode, though the new enemy attacks from the North American version of the game have been removed for both. The new Expert setting goes beyond any other version of the game, restoring the new attacks, increasing damage from enemies, and reducing damage dealt.

===Ports===
A modified version of the game was made for the Nintendo Super System arcade platform. This arcade version featured only the action stages, similar to the Professional! mode in the retail version. Among other changes, the game had a different scoring system, and was much more difficult than the retail version: for example, contact with spikes is instantly fatal to the player like in the Japanese version, instead of merely causing loss of HP.

Square Enix released a limited version of the game for mobile phones, published by Macrospace on September 1, 2004. It consists of the first three side-scrolling levels of the game, with the town-building portions completely omitted.

&quot;ActRaiser&quot; also became available on the Wii&#x27;s Virtual Console. It was released in Japan on March 20, 2007, in Europe on April 13, and in North America on May 28. As the game was published by Enix, Square Enix currently holds the rights to the Virtual Console edition.

===&quot;Actraiser Renaissance&quot;===
A remake under the title of &quot;Actraiser Renaissance&quot; was released in September 2021, for Android, iOS, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and Windows. It drastically alters the flow of gameplay, with extra input commands in the action stages, and new tower defense segments in the simulator maps. It also introduces a post-game stage not present in the original game, Alcaleone.

==Music==
Among many things, the game is recognized for its score, which was composed by Yuzo Koshiro. Its release within six months of the launch of the console demonstrated the compositional potential it represented to future projects, underscoring its ability to use and manipulate comparatively high-quality samples. A single disc soundtrack for the game was released on January 25, 1991, in Japan. A shorter arranged soundtrack titled &quot;Symphonic Suite from Actraiser&quot; was released on September 21. In 2004, a medley of music from the game arranged by the original composer was performed live at the second annual Symphonic Game Music Concert in Leipzig, Germany. The soundtrack was re-released by Wayô Records on vinyl and CD in 2021 as &quot;ActRaiser Original Soundtrack &amp; Symphonic Suite&quot;. Koshiro would later return to not only fully recreate the original soundtrack for &quot;Actraiser Renaissance&quot;, but also composed fifteen new tracks, in both the original SNES sample quality and Renaissance&#x27;s own higher quality audio.

==Reception==
The game sold about 620,000 copies worldwide, with 400,000 copies sold in Japan, 180,000 in the US and 40,000 in Europe.

Geoffrey Douglas Smith of &quot;AllGame&quot; wrote while the game was not the height of its genre, the unique combination and the orchestrated soundtrack result in enjoyable adventure.

&quot;Super Gamer&quot; magazine gave a review score of 84%, calling it a brilliant mix of a strategic gods game and platforming elements.

&quot;ActRaiser&quot; was awarded Best Music of 1993 by &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot;. In 1997 &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; editors ranked it the 75th best console video game of all time. They praised the unique combination of gameplay styles and its hypnotic atmosphere that makes playing the game seem more like a religious experience than other games on Super NES.

&quot;ActRaiser&quot; was inducted into GameSpot&#x27;s Greatest Games of All Time in December 2003. It was rated the 150th best game made on a Nintendo System in Nintendo Power&#x27;s Top 200 Games list. In 2007, &quot;ScrewAttack&quot; ranked &quot;ActRaiser&quot; #1 on their &quot;Top 10 Big Names That Fell Off&quot;, which listed games that were popular in days past, whether good or bad, but have since faded into relative obscurity (&quot;ActRaiser&quot; was discussed positively). It was also #10 in their &quot;Top 20 SNES Games&quot; list. In 2018, Complex ranked &quot;ActRaiser&quot; 33rd on their &quot;The Best Super Nintendo Games of All Time&quot; list. In 2017, Gamesradar ranked &quot;ActRaiser&quot; 23rd on its &quot;The best SNES games of all time&quot; list. They praised the gameplay, calling it a good mix of 2D action and city-building simulation. In 1995, &quot;Total!&quot; placed the game 91st on its &quot;Top 100 SNES Games&quot; list.

<doc id="464253" wikidata="Q33776" url="?curid=464253" title="Palauan language">
<text>Palauan () is a Malayo-Polynesian language native to the Republic of Palau, where it is one of the two official languages, alongside English. It is widely used in day-to-day life in the country. Palauan is not closely related to other Malayo-Polynesian languages and its exact classification within the branch is unclear.

==Classification==
It is a member of the Malayo-Polynesian branch of the Austronesian family of languages, and is one of only two indigenous languages in Micronesia that are not part of the Oceanic sub-branch of that family, the other being Chamorro (see , , , and ).

Roger Blench (2015) argues that based on evidence from fish names, Palauan had early contact with Oceanic languages either directly or indirectly via the Yapese language. These include fish names for the sea eel, yellowfin tuna (&quot;Thunnus albacares&quot;), left-eye flounder (&quot;Bothus mancus&quot;), triggerfish, sailfish, barracuda (&quot;Sphyraena barracuda&quot;), damsel fish (&quot;Abudefduf&quot; sp.), squirrelfish (&quot;Holocentrus&quot; spp.), unicorn fish (&quot;Naso&quot; spp.), trevally, land crab (&quot;Cardisoma rotundus&quot;), and wrasse. This suggests that Oceanic speakers had influenced the fishing culture of Palau, and had been fishing and trading in the vicinity of Palau for quite some time. Blench (2015) also suggests that the Palauan language displays influence from Central Philippine languages and Samalic languages.

==Phonology==
The phonemic inventory of Palauan consists of 10 consonants and 6 vowels. Phonetic charts of the vowel and consonant phonemes are provided below, utilizing the .

===Allophones===
While the phonemic inventory of Palauan is relatively small, comparatively, many phonemes contain at least two allophones that surface as the result of various phonological processes within the language. The full phonetic inventory of consonants is given below in (the phonemic inventory of vowels, above, is complete).

The following is the table of allophones and their contexts in Palauan.
===Diphthongs===
Palauan contains several diphthongs (sequences of vowels within a single syllable). A list of diphthongs and corresponding Palauan words containing them are given below, adapted from .

The extent to which it is accurate to characterize each of these vowel sequences as diphthongs has been a matter of debate, as in , , , and . Nevertheless, a number of the sequences above, such as , clearly behave as diphthongs given their interaction with other aspects of Palauan phonology like stress shift and vowel reduction. Others do not behave as clearly like monosyllabic diphthongs.

==Writing system==
In the early 1970s, the Palau Orthography Committee worked with linguists from the University of Hawaii to devise an alphabet based on the Latin script. The resulting orthography was largely based on the &quot;one phoneme/one symbol&quot; notion, producing an alphabet of twelve native consonants, six consonants for use in loan words, and ten vowels. The 20 vowel sequences listed under Diphthongs are also all officially recognized in the orthography.

Most of the letters/graphemes in written Palauan correspond to phonemes that can be represented by the corresponding segments in the International Phonetic Alphabet , e.g., Palauan is the phoneme . Three notable exceptions are worth mentioning: 
* The first is , which is invariably pronounced as a glottal stop . The &quot;ch&quot; digraph is a remnant of an earlier writing system developed during German occupation when the glottal stop was pronounced as a fricative ; some older Palauans still remember their grandparents pronouncing &quot;ch&quot; this way. In modern Palauan usage the sound has been completely replaced by , but the &quot;ch&quot; spelling persists. 
* The second is . It represents sometimes the full vowel as in &#x27;garden&#x27;, and sometimes a schwa , as in &#x27;child&#x27;. The distribution of the two pronunciations is similar to those of English vowel reduction: is found in stressed syllables vs. in unstressed ones (compare Eng. &#x27; vs. &#x27;).
** The two sounds and were once distinguished in the orthography, as the schwa was spelled , using an ogonek: e.g. &#x27;child&#x27;. This was the orthography used by Josephs in his 1975 grammar; yet the same author has used a simple in his later work, e.g. his 1990 dictionary.
* The third is the digraph , which is a (phonemic) velar nasal but can assimilate to be pronounced as or .

There is no phonemic in Palauan: this gap is due to a historical sound shift from Proto-Malayo-Polynesian *n to ‒ a change that is also found elsewhere in the region (e.g. in Gorontalo).

On May 10, 2007, the Senate of Palau passed Bill No. 7-79, which mandates that educational institutions recognize the Palauan orthography laid out in and . The bill also establishes an Orthography Commission to maintain the language as it develops as well as to oversee and regulate any additions or modifications to the current official orthography.

==Grammar==
=== Pronouns ===
The following set of pronouns are the pronouns found in the Palauan language:

===Noun inflection===
Palauan nouns inflect based on humanness and number via the plural prefix , which attaches to plural human nouns (see ). For example, the word &#x27;person&#x27; is a human noun that is unambiguously singular, whereas the noun people is a human noun that is unambiguously plural. Non-human nouns do not display this distinction, e.g., the word for &#x27;stone&#x27;, , can denote either a singular &#x27;stone&#x27; or multiple &#x27;stones.&#x27;

Some possessed nouns in Palauan also inflect to agree with the person, number, and humanness of their possessors. For example, the unpossessed noun means simply &#x27;table,&#x27; whereas one of its possessed forms means &#x27;my table.&#x27; Possessor agreement is always registered via the addition of a suffix to the noun (also triggering a shift in stress to the suffix). The possessor agreement suffixes have many different irregular forms that only attach to particular nouns, and they must be memorized on a noun-by-noun basis . However, there is a &quot;default&quot; e-set suffixes (see and ), shown below:

There are some morphophonological changes, often unpredictable, including: 
* Single vowels are reduced to , written as ( → &#x27;my stone&#x27;), or being syncopated entirely ( → &#x27;my fish&#x27;), with few nouns do not reduce their vowel ( → &#x27;my hand&#x27;)
* Double vowels are reduced to single vowels ( → &#x27;my nail&#x27;), sometimes reduced further to ( → ) or even syncopated
* Due to syncopation, numerous complicated consonant clusters are produced, and some of them are simplified in Palauan ( → &#x27;my water&#x27;, → &#x27;my breast&#x27;)

===Verb inflection===
Palauan verb morphology is highly complex. &#x27;eat&#x27;, for example, may be analyzed as verb prefix + imperfective + , in which is an archimorpheme that is only apparent from comparing various forms, e.g. &#x27;food&#x27; and taking into consideration morphophonemic patterns: &#x27;the dog was eating fish&#x27; (lit. it VERB PREFIX-m eat-PAST INFIX-il- ARTICLE fish ARTICLE dog); &#x27;The dog eats up fish&#x27; (lit. it-eat-PERFECTIVE-INFIX-m- fish ARTICLE dog). The verb system points to fossilized forms related to the Philippine languages.

===Word order===
The word order of Palauan is usually thought to be verb–object–subject (VOS), but this has been a matter of some debate in the linguistic literature. Those who accept the VOS analysis of Palauan word order generally treat Palauan as a pro-drop language with preverbal subject agreement morphemes, final pronominal subjects are deleted (or null).

Example 1: . (means: &#x27;I was eating the apple.&#x27;)

In the preceding example, the abstract null pronoun is the subject &#x27;I,&#x27; while the clause-initial is the first person singular subject agreement morpheme.

On the other hand, those who have analyzed Palauan as SVO necessarily reject the pro-drop analysis, instead analyzing the subject agreement morphemes as subject pronouns. In the preceding example, SVO-advocates assume that there is no &quot;pro&quot; and that the morpheme is simply an overt subject pronoun meaning &#x27;I&#x27;. One potential problem with this analysis is that it fails to explain why overt (3rd person) subjects occur clause-finally in the presence of a co-referring 3rd person &quot;subject pronoun&quot; --- treating the subject pronouns as agreement morphemes circumvents this weakness. Consider the following example.

Example 2: . (means: &#x27;Satsuko was eating the apple.&#x27;)

Proponents of the SVO analysis must assume a shifting of the subject &#x27;Satsuko&#x27; from clause-initial to clause-final position, a movement operation that has not received acceptance cross-linguistically, but see for discussion.

<doc id="464265" wikidata="Q1582736" url="?curid=464265" title="Souvlaki (album)">
<text>Souvlaki is the second studio album by the English rock band Slowdive. It was recorded in 1992, and released on 1 June 1993 by Creation Records.

On its initial release, &quot;Souvlaki&quot; peaked at number 51 on the UK Albums Chart and was greeted with tepid reviews from critics. It has since received retrospective critical acclaim and has been hailed as a classic of the shoegaze genre.

== Background ==
Prior to the writing of &quot;Souvlaki&quot;, Slowdive co-vocalists and guitarists Rachel Goswell and Neil Halstead had ended their relationship and Halstead began to spend more time writing songs alone, a process that had been completed by the full band in the past.

The album&#x27;s title was inspired from a skit by American prank call comedy duo The Jerky Boys, where one of the duo telephones a hotel manager requesting him to perform sexual acts on his wife. Upon learning the manager is Greek, the caller says: &quot;My wife loves that Greek shit... She&#x27;ll suck your cock like souvlaki.&quot;

== Recording ==
While touring Europe in early 1992, Slowdive began tentative work on &quot;Souvlaki&quot;, writing and recording multiple takes of around 40 potential songs. According to the band&#x27;s chief songwriter Neil Halstead, these early songs were influenced by Joy Division and the David Bowie studio albums &quot;Low&quot; (1977) and &quot;Lodger&quot; (1979). Alan McGee, the head of Slowdive&#x27;s label Creation Records, was unimpressed by the band&#x27;s material and rejected it, though he later decided to give Slowdive full creative control over the album.

After returning to the United Kingdom following a May 1992 tour of the United States, Slowdive contacted Brian Eno, of whom Halstead was a &quot;big&quot; fan, and requested that he produce &quot;Souvlaki&quot;. While Eno declined, he did agree to spend a few days recording with Slowdive, and out of these sessions came the tracks &quot;Sing&quot; and &quot;Here She Comes&quot;. Following the sessions with Eno, Halstead began to take greater influence from ambient music in his songwriting; he has cited Aphex Twin, dub music, and early drum and bass as influences for the track &quot;Souvlaki Space Station&quot;.

Meanwhile, Halstead was in a fragile emotional state due to his recent breakup with Goswell. At the suggestion of Slowdive&#x27;s manager, Halstead temporarily exited the recording sessions for &quot;Souvlaki&quot; in the summer of 1992 and travelled to Wales, where he stayed in a rented cottage for around two weeks. In Halstead&#x27;s absence, only bassist Nick Chaplin and guitarist Christian Savill persisted in recording material, though Savill would later recall that he and Chaplin ended up merely recording several &quot;joke songs&quot;. By the time he returned, Halstead had written a new batch of &quot;stark and much more personal&quot; songs, including &quot;Dagger&quot;, which would make the final album. He has said that the lyrics he penned during this period were informed by both his solitary living conditions in Wales and his feelings about the end of his relationship with Goswell.

&quot;Souvlaki&quot; was mixed by Ed Buller, who had previously worked with Suede and Spiritualized.

== Release ==
&quot;Souvlaki&quot; was released on 1 June 1993 through Creation Records. It peaked at number 51 on the UK Albums Chart dated 12 June 1993, 19 places lower than Slowdive&#x27;s debut studio album &quot;Just for a Day&quot; (1991), and spent one week on the chart. It was released in the US through SBK Records on 8 February 1994. The US release included four bonus tracks: a previously unreleased cover of &quot;Some Velvet Morning&quot; (written by Lee Hazlewood and originally recorded by Hazlewood and Nancy Sinatra in 1967), and three tracks from Slowdive&#x27;s 1993 &quot;5&quot; extended play (EP).

A two-disc remastered reissue of &quot;Souvlaki&quot; was released in 2005 by Castle Music, a subsidiary label of Sanctuary Records. The second disc featured the &quot;Some Velvet Morning&quot; cover, two tracks from Slowdive&#x27;s 1993 &quot;Outside Your Room&quot; EP, all tracks from their &quot;5&quot; EP, and Bandulu and Reload remixes of &quot;5&quot; track &quot;In Mind&quot;. Another two-disc remaster was released by Cherry Red Records on 16 August 2010, featuring the same bonus tracks on the second disc.

== Critical reception ==
&quot;Souvlaki&quot; was released in the UK to middling reviews from critics. Dave Simpson of &quot;Melody Maker&quot; wrote: Sing&#x27; aside, I would rather drown choking in a bath full of porridge than ever listen to it again.&quot; John Mulvey of &quot;NME&quot; reacted with muted praise, calling &quot;Souvlaki&quot; &quot;another exemplary product from spangly guitar heaven&quot; yet ultimately deeming it a &quot;pretty, but unfulfilled&quot; album. In 2015, Slowdive and Alan McGee stated that they felt that &quot;Souvlaki&quot; was released at a time when dream pop and shoegaze had become unfashionable and the music press were more interested in Britpop bands such as Oasis.

In later years, &quot;Souvlaki&quot; has been met with more widespread acclaim. In a retrospective review for AllMusic, Jack Rabid praised the album as &quot;quiet, moving, and aggressive simultaneously, mixing trance-like beauty with the deepest delayed guitar sounds around, a sound at once relaxing, soothing, and exciting, and most of all harshly beautiful.&quot; Nitsuh Abebe of &quot;Pitchfork&quot; described it as &quot;a bit of an &quot;Essential Slowdive&quot; in itself&quot;, with songs that are simultaneously &quot;pillowy-soft and passionately deep&quot;. &quot;Paste&quot;″s Zach Schonfeld called &quot;Souvlaki&quot; &quot;the definitive shoegaze statement&quot;.

==Legacy==
In 1999, critic Ned Raggett ranked &quot;Souvlaki&quot; at number 83 on his list of the best albums of the 1990s for &quot;Freaky Trigger&quot;. &quot;Pitchfork&quot; released a documentary about the album in 2015 as part of its &quot;Pitchfork&quot; Classic series. The following year, the website listed &quot;Souvlaki&quot; as the second best shoegaze album of all time. &quot;Souvlaki&quot; has since been recognized as one of the best releases of the 1990s and one of the greatest shoegaze albums of all time by the websites &quot;NME&quot; and &quot;PopMatters&quot;.

<text>The &quot;Bathurst&quot;-class corvettes were a class of general purpose vessels designed and built in Australia during World War II. Originally classified as minesweepers, but widely referred to as corvettes, the &quot;Bathurst&quot;-class vessels fulfilled a broad anti-submarine, anti-mine, and convoy escort role.

A total of 60 &quot;Bathurst&quot;-class corvettes were built, at eight Australian shipyards: 36 were paid for by the Australian government and 24 were built on British Admiralty orders. Of these UK-owned vessels, 20 were officially commissioned into the Royal Australian Navy (RAN), and manned by RAN personnel, while four served in the Royal Indian Navy; none of the UK-owned vessels was commissioned into the Royal Navy. An order for three more &quot;Bathurst&quot;s, to be constructed in India, was cancelled before they were laid down.

Although the &quot;Bathurst&quot;s were designed for the anti-submarine and anti-mine roles, they also served as troop and supply transports, provided air defence for convoys and disabled ships, participated in shore bombardments, and undertook hydrographic surveys. Three ships were lost during the war: one to an air attack and two to collisions with friendly merchant ships. (Following the war, a fourth vessel sank after hitting a mine while sweeping the Great Barrier Reef.)

After the war, the Admiralty ships were sold to the Turkish Navy, Royal Netherlands Navy, and civilian operators, while several RAN-owned vessels were transferred to the Royal New Zealand Navy, temporarily reactivated to facilitate National Service Training, or sold to civilians. Four of the Dutch &quot;Bathurst&quot;s were transferred to the Indonesian Navy; one of these was destroyed in 1956 by anti-government rebels. The rest of the RAN and Admiralty ships were sold for scrap to help fund other projects. Two vessels are preserved as museum ships.

==Background==
In 1937, in an initially-unrelated development, the Australian Commonwealth Naval Board (ACNB) approved the procurement of three net-laying boom defence vessels. However, in February 1938, the ACNB also identified a need for a class of general purpose, &#x27;local defence vessels&#x27; that were easy to construct and operate. (This need emerged from plans for a training tender attached to the RAN anti-submarine warfare training school.) The ships had to be capable of both anti-submarine and minesweeping duties. Consequently, the number of boom defence vessels ordered was reduced to two, and resources for the third were re-allocated to a prototype local defence vessel.

During July 1938, the RAN Director of Engineering, Rear Admiral Percival McNeil, was instructed to develop plans for a local defence vessel, with a displacement of approximately 500 tons, a speed of at least , and a range of . McNeil completed his drawings in February 1939; his proposal called for a 680-ton vessel, with a speed of , and a range of . McNeil&#x27;s unbuilt prototype – sometimes known as HMAS &quot;Kangaroo&quot; – more closely resembled a sloop than the original concept of a local defence vessel; the increase in size and speed also meant the vessel would have been more versatile than originally envisioned. It would have been equipped with a 4-inch gun, ASDIC and either depth charge launchers or minesweeping equipment, depending on operational requirements. In the meantime, however, the order for three net-laying vessels was re-instated before construction of McNeil&#x27;s prototype could begin. (The second of these Bar-class boom vessels to be commissioned was instead named .)
Although McNeil&#x27;s &quot;Kangaroo class&quot; was never built, his general concept attracted interest in Australian naval circles, as it offered advantages over existing minesweeper and anti-submarine classes and could be built in Australia with local resources, with the exception of weapons and some specialised instrumentation. Although not perfectly suited for any specific role, the all-round general capability for minesweeping, anti-submarine warfare, patrol, and escort duties was seen as a good short-term solution until better vessels could be requisitioned or constructed.

In September 1939, following the outbreak of war, there was a new procurement process for seven ships of a design based on McNeil&#x27;s concept. Additional orders were soon placed by both the ACNB and the British Admiralty, and a total of 60 &quot;Bathurst&quot;-class ships were built, including 36 ordered by the RAN for home duties and 24 paid for by the Admiralty. Of these British-ordered vessels, 20 vessels were commissioned into the RAN and crewed by Australian personnel, on the understanding that they would be attached to Royal Navy fleets; a further four vessels were commissioned into the Royal Indian Navy.

The &quot;Bathurst&quot; class were officially classified as &quot;Australian Minesweepers&quot; (AMS) to hide their intended primary role in anti-submarine duties, although the &quot;Bathurst&quot;s were popularly referred to as corvettes.

==Design==

Each ship&#x27;s company varied in size: the standard complement was 85, including 6 commissioned and 12 to 13 non-commissioned officers. Over 20,000 personnel served on a &quot;Bathurst&quot; during the war: the early ships were primarily manned by reservists, while the majority of the &#x27;Hostilities Only&#x27; personnel recruited during the war served on a &quot;Bathurst&quot;-class vessel sometime during their career. Sailors were accommodated in ten-man messdecks, which were small, poorly lit rooms that were perpetually damp from seawater and sweat. In anything but calm weather, hatches and portholes would have to be closed: sunlight and fresh air was a rarity inside the hull. Because of the conditions, high rates of sickness (particularly pneumonia and tuberculosis) were experienced. Officers slept in cabins with bunks (as opposed to hammocks), and ate and relaxed in each ship&#x27;s wardroom, complete with bar and steward service. The difference in conditions between officers and sailors prompted tensions between these two groups.

Six large escort vessels based on a scaled-up version of the &quot;Bathurst&quot; design were considered for construction in mid-1941, but the design was determined to be inferior to the .

===Armament and equipment===
The most common armament for &quot;Bathurst&quot;-class corvettes was a 12-pounder gun or a 4-inch Mark XIX high-angle gun, three Oerlikon 20 mm cannons, two Lewis .303 machine guns, and two .303 Vickers machine guns. The corvettes carried up to 40 depth charges, which were deployed by 4 throwers and 2 chutes. Many of the 12-pounder carrying corvettes were refitted with the 4-inch during their service life, while one of the Oerlikons was often replaced with a Bofors 40 mm gun. &quot;Bathurst&quot;s equipped with the 4-inch main gun were primarily allocated to northern waters, because of the increased air threat and the greater anti-aircraft capabilities of the 4-inch compared to the 12-pounder gun mounted on other corvettes.
Due to the variety of shipyards constructing the corvettes, as well as the varying roles the &quot;Bathurst&quot;s were pressed into, there was no true standardisation of armament. Some ships varied significantly from the common armament profile, while an individual ship&#x27;s weapons outfit could vary significantly for different periods of her career. At one stage, carried six Oerlikon cannons, a number later reduced to four. By comparison, the outfit of consisted of a single 4-inch gun and a single 40 mm gun.

The &quot;Bathurst&quot;s were equipped with modified Type 128 asdic equipment, redesigned to be used without a gyroscopic stabiliser. Minesweeping equipment also varied across the class: ships equipped with the newer &#x27;LL&#x27; minesweeping gear were distributed as evenly as possible throughout major Australian ports.

Each was fitted with a triple expansion steam engine (usually fabricated by railway workshops) to drive two propellers at a theoretical maximum speed of , although this required ideal conditions and was rarely achieved.

==Construction==

Construction of the ships required a significant expansion of the Australian shipbuilding industry. This was achieved by bringing disused dockyards back into production and establishing new facilities. The lead shipyard was Cockatoo Docks &amp; Engineering Company in Sydney, which laid down the first ship, , in February 1940, and produced a further seven vessels. The other seven shipyards involved were Walkers Limited in Maryborough, Queensland (7 ships), Evans Deakin &amp; Company in Brisbane (11 ships), Mort&#x27;s Dock &amp; Engineering Company in Sydney (14 ships), Poole &amp; Steel in Sydney (7 ships), State Dockyard at Newcastle, New South Wales (1 ship), HMA Naval Dockyard at Williamstown, Victoria (8 ships), and BHP at Whyalla, South Australia (4 ships). Each ship cost approximately A£250,000 to build.

The initial rate of construction was slow, due to a variety of factors: delays in equipment delivery from overseas, industrial problems, a lack of qualified labour, and the difficulty of naval overseers in supporting all eight shipyards at once primary among them. The initial prediction was that two vessels per month would enter service through 1941, but by June 1940, only five of the seventeen ordered so far had been laid down, and the RAN was advised at the end of 1940 that only seven would be completed December 1940. The prioritisation of Admiralty orders by the Australian government meant that RAN-ordered ships were further delayed, although the Admiralty later allowed the first four of their ships to remain in local waters until replacements entered service. Rate of construction increased by late 1941, although the increasing need of shipbuilding resources for repairs as the war progressed slowed the rate of construction back down. The corvette&#x27;s build time was comparable to that of an ; the fourteen-month construction time for was equal to or faster than the individual build time of half the corvettes.

Three additional &quot;Bathurst&quot;s were to be built for the Royal Indian Navy by Garden Reach of Calcutta. All three were laid down on 3 May 1943, but were cancelled and broken up on the slipways in March 1945. Instead, three Flower-class corvettes were transferred from the Royal Navy to India.

==Role==
The two main purposes the ships were intended for were minesweeping and anti-submarine escort. However, the corvettes found themselves performing a wide range of duties, including troop and supply transport, bombardment, assault landings support, survey and hydrography mapping, and providing aid to disabled ships. The &quot;Bathurst&quot;s were seen as &#x27;maids of all work&#x27; by the RAN, even though the design was inappropriate for some roles; being too small, too slow, or inadequately armed or equipped. It was not until March 1943 that sufficient ships were available to take the individual variations and capabilities of the &quot;Bathurst&quot;s into account: prior to this, they were the first (and often only) available vessel.

Because of the dual, conflicting roles of local defence vessel and ocean-going escort, &quot;Bathurst&quot;s based in Australia were under two different controllers for the first part of the Pacific War; operationally under the US Navy&#x27;s Naval Commander South West Pacific Area Forces (COMSOUWESTPAC), and administratively under the Naval Officer In Charge (NOIC) of the ship&#x27;s homeport. Following multiple incidents where a ship would be assigned to two different tasks simultaneously; conflicts between local needs, escort schedules, and maintenance requirements; and protests from the NOIC in Fremantle and Darwin, the Australian-based corvettes were placed completely under NOIC control in May 1942. Instead of directly assigning ships to convoys, COMSOUWESTPAC would indicate that ships would be needed from a particular port for escort duties, leaving the NOIC of that port free to allocate available ships.

&quot;Bathurst&quot;-class ships were assigned up to three different pennant numbers during the course of their career. With the exception of , all of the &quot;Bathurst&quot;-class corvettes were given numbers with the &#x27;J&#x27; flag superior, designating them as minesweepers. Ships of the class that served with the British Pacific Fleet, like many other ships serving with the fleet, had their pennant numbers changed to ones with a &#x27;B&#x27; flag superior. At the end of World War II, a reorganisation of the pennant system saw the Bathursts given new numbers with &#x27;M&#x27; as the flag superior, which was the new designator for minesweepers.

==Operational history==

===World War II===
In the early part of their war service, &quot;Bathurst&quot;s were involved in the evacuation of several locations which fell to the initial Japanese advance, and in the transportation of supplies and reinforcements to Australian and Dutch guerrilla operations in Timor. was the only ship of the class destroyed by enemy action; she was sunk by torpedoes from Japanese aircraft on the afternoon of 1 December 1942 while transporting personnel of the Netherlands East Indies Army to Betano, Timor.

The &quot;Bathurst&quot;s were involved in several attacks on submarines during the war. On 20 January 1942, the was sunk outside Darwin. This, the first RAN kill of a full-size submarine, was credited to , with sister ships and assisting. On 11 September 1943, assisted in the destruction of the German submarine . On 11 February 1944, the corvettes and , along with the Indian sloop , were responsible for the sinking of the in the Bay of Bengal.

In November 1942, an Indian &quot;Bathurst&quot;, , along with the Dutch tanker she was escorting, engaged and sank the Japanese commerce raider , and drove off her sister ship .

In early 1943, HMA Ships and were modified to serve as hydrographic survey ships. The corvettes were assigned to Task Group 70.5 of the United States Seventh Fleet, and were used to survey waters prior to several amphibious landings during the war.

Eight corvettes were deployed to the Mediterranean in May 1943. Their anti-aircraft armament made them appropriate for escort duties during the Allied invasion of Sicily. A month later, four Bathursts were part of an eight-ship escort for a 40-strong convoy to Gibraltar when it was attacked by 50 German torpedo bombers; the corvettes&#x27; air defence destroyed nine aircraft, and only two merchant ships received damage. During their time in the Mediterranean, several corvettes reached the Atlantic Ocean.
In early 1945, eighteen &quot;Bathurst&quot;-class corvettes were assigned to the British Pacific Fleet. Eight of these ships cleared Victoria Harbour before the BPF arrived in Hong Kong at the end of the Japanese occupation, while three-, , and -were present in Tokyo Bay when the Japanese Instrument of Surrender was signed.

The poor working and living conditions aboard the ships, combined with the heavy and often difficult workloads, led to mutinous acts aboard four ships during the war: , , , and . The incidents in &quot;Geraldton&quot; and &quot;Lithgow&quot; were minor and resolved without disciplinary charges, while the &#x27;mutiny&#x27; aboard &quot;Toowoomba&quot; was caused by a lack of communication: after a hard day loading supplies, the sailors did not respond to an order to assemble on the quarterdeck as they felt they had laboured enough that day, but changed their mind when informed that the order to assemble was so the captain could thank them for their efforts, and reward them with drinks. However, the &quot;Pirie&quot; mutiny was far more serious: the ship&#x27;s company were unable to respect their commanding officer, who was an ineffective leader but an overly strict disciplinarian with a superiority complex. This lack of respect was compounded while repairs were made to the corvette following an air attack off Oro Bay in April 1943, when the captain forced the rest of the company to live aboard, while he took residence at a hotel. A lack of pay, mail, and shore leave contributed to the sailors&#x27; frustration, and in response, 45 junior sailors refused to report for duties on 9 May until they could present their grievances to the commander. In response, he had the ship surrounded by armed guards and disabled the main gun. A Board of Inquiry failed to identify any ringleaders, and the problem was handed back to &quot;Pirie&quot;″s commander to solve as he saw fit: fourteen men were charged with mutiny, with ten sent to prison. Relationships between commander and company did not improve until he was replaced at the end of 1943 for his botched handling of the event.

Only three &quot;Bathurst&quot;-class corvettes were lost during World War II. As well as &quot;Armidale&quot;, the other two ships were lost following collisions with merchant vessels of the United States: in June 1943, and in October 1944.

===Post-war===

After the war, the 20 Admiralty-owned vessels were disposed of; five to the Turkish Navy, eight to the Royal Netherlands Navy, and one to China, with the rest converted and sold for civilian use or broken up for scrap. Four of the Dutch Bathursts were later sold on to the Indonesian Navy. One of these, , renamed KRI &quot;Hang Tuah&quot;, was bombed and sunk on 28 April 1958 by a CIA-operated Douglas B-26 Invader operating in support of Permesta rebels opposed to the Guided Democracy in Indonesia established the previous year.
Of the 33 surviving RAN vessels, twelve were formed into the 20th Minesweeping Flotilla and tasked with clearing minefields deployed during the war in the waters of Australia, New Guinea, and the Solomons. was sunk by an Australian mine in the Great Barrier Reef in September 1947. Several ships were also used to transport soldiers and liberated prisoners of war. The corvettes were then placed in operational reserve, with the intention that they be reactivated for escort work in the event of another war or international crisis. Most were sold off during the 1950s, including four to the Royal New Zealand Navy, to help offset the cost of acquiring and operating two aircraft carriers. Four corvettes (, , , and ) were recommissioned in 1951 as training vessels for the National Service Program. was reactivated in 1953 for the same purpose. The RAN component of the program ended in 1957.

The last ship to leave RAN service was on 28 October 1960. The gradual loss of minesweeping-capable ships was not rectified until late 1962, when the RAN purchased six s from the Royal Navy.

The 56 corvettes commissioned as Australian vessels travelled a combined total of during their service with the RAN. A total of 83 personnel were killed in service across the entire service life of the class.

<doc id="464271" wikidata="Q159099" url="?curid=464271" title="Nina Hagen">
<text>Catharina &quot;Nina&quot; Hagen (; born 11 March 1955) is a German singer, songwriter, and actress. She is known for her theatrical vocals and rise to prominence during the punk and Neue Deutsche Welle movements in the late 1970s and early 1980s. She is known as &quot;The Godmother of German Punk&quot;.

Born and raised in the former East Berlin, German Democratic Republic, Hagen began her career as an actress when she appeared in several German films alongside her mother Eva-Maria Hagen. Around that same time, she joined the band Automobil and released the schlager single &quot;Du hast den Farbfilm vergessen&quot;. After her stepfather Wolf Biermann&#x27;s East German citizenship was withdrawn in 1976, Hagen followed him to Hamburg. Shortly afterwards, she was offered a record deal from CBS Records and formed the Nina Hagen Band. Their self-titled debut album was released in late 1978 to critical acclaim and was a commercial success selling over 250,000 copies. The band released one more album, &quot;Unbehagen&quot;, before their break-up in 1979.

In 1982, Hagen signed a new contract with CBS and released her debut solo album &quot;NunSexMonkRock&quot;, which became her first record to chart in the United States. She followed it with two more albums: &quot;Fearless&quot; (1983) and &quot;Nina Hagen in Ekstasy&quot; (1985), before her contract with CBS expired and was not renewed. In 1989, she was offered a record deal from Mercury Records. She released three albums on the label: &quot;Nina Hagen&quot; (1989), &quot;Street&quot; (1991), and &quot;Revolution Ballroom&quot; (1993). However, none of the albums achieved notable commercial success. Hagen made her musical comeback with the release of her album &quot;Return of the Mother&quot; (2000).

Besides her musical career, Hagen is also a voice-over actress. She wrote three autobiographies: &quot;Ich bin ein Berliner&quot; (1988), &quot;Nina Hagen: That&#x27;s Why the Lady Is a Punk&quot; (2003), and &quot;Bekenntnisse&quot; (2010). She is also noted for her human and animal rights activism.

==Life and career==

===1955-1976: Early life and career beginnings===

Nina Hagen was born in what was then East Berlin, East Germany, the daughter of Hans Oliva-Hagen, a scriptwriter, and Eva-Maria Hagen (née Buchholz), an actress and singer. Her father Hans survived the Holocaust, being held as a prisoner at a prison in Moabit between 1941 and 1945 until the liberation by the Soviet Army. Her paternal grandfather Hermann Carl Hagen, who was Jewish, was murdered at the Sachsenhausen concentration camp on 28 May 1942, at age 56. Hedwig Elise Caroline Staadt, Nina&#x27;s paternal grandmother, was also murdered at Sachsenhausen. Nina&#x27;s maternal grandfather Fritz Buchholz died during World War II. Her parents divorced when she was two years old. During her childhood, she saw her father infrequently. At age four, she began to study ballet, and she was considered an opera prodigy by the time she was nine.

When Hagen was 11, her mother had a relationship with Wolf Biermann, an singer-songwriter. Biermann&#x27;s political views later influenced young Hagen. She later returned to Germany and joined the cover band Fritzens Dampferband (&quot;Fritzen&#x27;s Steamboat Band&quot;), together with Achim Mentzel and others. She added songs by Janis Joplin and Tina Turner to the &quot;allowable&quot; set lists during shows. From 1972 to 1973, Hagen enrolled in the vocal training performance program at The Central Studio for Light Music in East Berlin (de). Upon graduating, she joined the band Automobil.

In East Germany, she performed with the band Automobil, becoming one of the country&#x27;s best-known young stars. Her most famous song from the early part of her career was &quot;Du hast den Farbfilm vergessen (You Forgot the Colour Film)&quot;, with words by Kurt Demmler to music by Michael Heubach, a subtle dig mocking the sterile, gray, Communist state, in 1974. Hagen performed comic songs like &quot;Hatschi-Waldera&quot; and &quot;Was denn&quot; in Karel Gott´s Czech TV show in Slaný. and &quot;Wir tanzen Tango&quot; in 1976. Her musical career in the DDR was cut short, when she and her mother left the country in 1976, following the expulsion of her stepfather.

===1976-1979: Migration to West-Germany and Nina Hagen Band===

The circumstances surrounding the family&#x27;s emigration were exceptional: Biermann was granted permission by East-German authorities to perform a televised concert in Cologne, but denied permission to re-cross the border to his adopted home country. Hagen submitted an application to leave the country. In it, she claimed to be Biermann&#x27;s biological daughter, and threatened to become &quot;the next&quot; Wolf Biermann if not allowed to rejoin her father. Just four days later her request was granted, and she settled in Hamburg, where she was signed to a CBS-affiliated record label. Her label advised her to acclimatize herself to Western culture through travel, and she arrived in London during the height of the punk rock movement. Hagen was quickly taken up by a circle that included The Slits.

Back in West Germany by mid-1977, Hagen formed the Nina Hagen Band in West Berlin&#x27;s Kreuzberg district. They released their self-titled debut album, &quot;Nina Hagen Band&quot; in late 1978: it included the single &quot;TV-Glotzer&quot; (a cover of &quot;White Punks on Dope&quot; by The Tubes, though with entirely different German lyrics), and &quot;Auf&#x27;m Bahnhof Zoo&quot;, about West-Berlin&#x27;s then-notorious Berlin Zoologischer Garten station. The album also included a version of &quot;Rangehn&quot; (&quot;Go for it&quot;), a song she had previously recorded in East-Germany, but with different music.

The debut album gained significant attention throughout Germany and abroad both for its hard rock sound and for Hagen&#x27;s theatrical vocals which drew heavily from her operatic training, far different from the straightforward singing of her East German recordings. However, relations between Hagen and the other band members deteriorated over the course of the subsequent European tour, and Hagen decided to leave the band in 1979, though she was still under contract to produce a second album. This LP, &quot;Unbehagen&quot; (which in German means &quot;discomfort&quot; or &quot;unease&quot;), was eventually produced with the band recording their tracks in Berlin and Hagen recording the vocals in Los Angeles. It included the single &quot;African Reggae&quot; and &quot;Wir Leben Immer... Noch&quot;, a German language cover of Lene Lovich&#x27;s &quot;Lucky Number&quot;. The other band members, sans Hagen, soon developed a successful independent musical career as Spliff.

Meanwhile, Hagen&#x27;s public persona was steadily creating media uproar. She became infamous for an appearance on an Austrian evening talk show called &quot;Club 2&quot;, on 9 August 1979, on the topic of youth culture, when she demonstrated (while clothed, but explicitly) various female masturbation positions and became embroiled in a heated argument with other panelists, in particular, writer and journalist Humbert Fink. The talk show host, Dieter Seefranz, had to step down following this controversy.

She also acted with Dutch rocker Herman Brood and singer Lene Lovich in the 1979 film &quot;Cha Cha&quot;. Brood and Hagen would have a long romantic relationship that would end when Hagen could no longer tolerate Brood&#x27;s drug abuse. She would refer to Brood as her &quot;soulmate&quot; long after Brood committed suicide in 2001.

===1980-1988: International breakthrough===

A European tour with a new band in 1980 was canceled, and Hagen turned to the United States. A limited-edition 10-inch EP was released on vinyl that summer in the U.S. Two songs from her first album &quot;Nina Hagen Band&quot; were on the A side, and two songs from her second album &quot;Unbehagen&quot; were on the B-side. All four songs were sung in German, although two had English titles and the other two were covers of English-language songs with new German lyrics.

In late 1980, Hagen discovered she was pregnant, broke up with the father-to-be Ferdinand Karmelk, and moved to Los Angeles. Her daughter, Cosma Shiva Hagen, was born in Santa Monica on 17 June 1981. In 1982, Hagen released her first English-language album: &quot;NunSexMonkRock&quot;, a dissonant mix of punk, funk, reggae, and opera. She then went on a world-tour with the No Problem Orchestra.

In 1983, she released the album &quot;Angstlos&quot; and a minor European tour. By this time, Hagen&#x27;s public appearances frequently included discussions of god, UFOs, her social and political beliefs, animal rights, and vivisection, and claims of alien sightings. The English version of &quot;Angstlos,&quot; &quot;Fearless,&quot; generated two major club hits in America, &quot;Zarah&quot; (a cover of the Zarah Leander (No. 45 USA) song &quot;Ich weiß, es wird einmal ein Wunder geschehen&quot;) and the disco/punk/opera song, &quot;New York New York&quot; (No. 9 USA). During 1984, Hagen spent a lot of time in London- and UK-based &quot;MusicSzene&quot; magazine chief-editor Wilfried Rimensberger, in conjunction with Spree Film, produced a first TV feature on her and what was remaining from London&#x27;s 70 Punk movement induced by artist and model Frankie Stein.

Her 1985 album &quot;In Ekstase&quot; fared less well, but did generate club hits with &quot;Universal Radio&quot; (No. 39 USA) and a cover of &quot;Spirit in the Sky&quot; and also featured a 1979 recording of her hardcore punk take on Paul Anka&#x27;s &quot;My Way&quot;, which had been one of her signature live tunes in previous years. She performed songs from this album during the 1985 version of Rock in Rio. While in Brazil she met and befriended Brazilian musicians as diverse as samba diva Beth Carvalho and Brazilian punk singer Supla (who was leader of a punk-new wave band named Tokyo), that invited her to contribute vocals to the hit 1986 song &quot;Garota de Berlim&quot; (Portuguese for &quot;girl from Berlin&quot;) that received huge airplay in radio in Brazil. To this day, Brazilians remember Nina above all things as the Berlin Girl from Tokyo&#x27;s song.

Wilfried Rimensberger and award-winning film director Lothar Spree produced a TV documentary for the German television station ZDF. This was followed by a launch of Nina&#x27;s UFO fashion underwear at anti-SAFT in Zurich, where again Rimensberger joined her up with New Romantic icon Steve Strange performing on stage. Simultaneously fashion photographer Hannes Schmid produced a Nina Hagen cover for German &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot; magazine. This also coincided with leading music publications like &quot;BRAVO&quot; and &quot;MusicSzene&quot; running cover stories that all put Hagen back on the forefront of something that, in retrospect, became a final highpoint of what the punk movement was all about. At the end of 1986, her contract with CBS was over and she released the &quot;Punk Wedding&quot; EP independently in 1987, a celebration of her marriage to an 18-year-old punk South African nicknamed &#x27;Iroquois&#x27;. It followed an independent 1986 one-off single with Lene Lovich, &quot;Don&#x27;t Kill the Animals&quot; (see &quot;Animal Liberation&quot;).

===1989-1994: &quot;Nina Hagen&quot;, &quot;Street&quot;, and &quot;Revolution Ballroom&quot;===

In 1989, Hagen released the album, &quot;Nina Hagen&quot;, which was backed up by another German tour. In 1989, she had a relationship with French stylist and music manager Franck Chevalier which yielded their son, Otis Chevalier-Hagen (b. 1990).

In the 1990s, Hagen lived in Paris with her daughter Cosma Shiva and son Otis. In 1991 she toured Europe in support of her new album &quot;Street&quot;. In 1992 Hagen became the host of a TV show on RTLplus. Also in the same year (1992) she collaborated with Adamski on the European smash and minor UK hit single &quot;Get Your Body&quot;. The following year, she released &quot;Revolution Ballroom&quot;. In 1994, Hagen starred in the acclaimed San Francisco Goethe Institut&#x27;s &quot;The Seven Addictions and Five Professions of Anita Berber&quot;, playing the singer version of &quot;Anita&quot; alongside dancer Darla Teagarden who portrayed the other &quot;professions&quot; of &quot;Anita&quot;. Also, her voice was heard on the Freaky Fukin Weirdoz single &quot;Hit Me with Your Rhythm Stick&quot;. 1995 brought the German-language album &quot;FreuD euch&quot;, equally recorded in English as &quot;BeeHappy&quot; in 1996. Nina returned to San Francisco to star in another San Francisco Goethe Institut show, &quot;Hannusen, Hitler&#x27;s Jewish Clarvoyant&quot;. Hagen also collaborated with electronic music composer Christopher Franke, along with Rick Palombi (credited as Rick Jude) on &quot;Alchemy of Love&quot;, the theme song for the film &quot;Tenchi Muyo! in Love&quot;.

===1995-1999===

In May 1996, she married David Lynn, but divorced him in the beginning of 2000. In 1997 she collaborated with German hip hop musician Thomas D. In 1998, Hagen became the host of a weekly science fiction show on the British Sci-Fi Channel, in addition to embarking on another tour of Germany. In 1999, she released the devotional album &quot;Om Namah Shivay&quot;, which was distributed exclusively online and included an unadulterated musical version of the Hare Krishna mantra. Hagen believes that the Hindu incarnation of Lord Vishnu known as Krishna was &quot;the King of Jerusalem&quot;, and sometimes refers to Krishna as &quot;Christ&quot;. She also provided vocals to &quot;Witness&quot; and &quot;Bereit&quot; on KMFDM&#x27;s &quot;Adios&quot;.

Also in 1998, she recorded the official club anthem &quot;Eisern Union&quot; for 1. FC Union Berlin and four versions were issued on a CD single by G.I.B Music and Distribution GmbH.

In 1999, she played the role of Celia Peachum in &quot;The Threepenny Opera&quot; by Kurt Weill and Bertolt Brecht, alongside Max Raabe. She also regularly performs songs by Kurt Weill, Hanns Eisler and Paul Dessau set to Brecht&#x27;s texts.

===2000-2009: &quot;Return of the Mother&quot;===

In 2000, her song &quot;Schön ist die Welt&quot; became the official song of Expo 2000. Another cover of a Zarah Leander song &quot;Der Wind hat mir ein Lied erzählt&quot; was a minor hit the same year. The album &quot;Return of the Mother&quot; was released in February 2001, accompanied by another German tour. Hagen wrote the song &quot;Handgrenade&quot; on the album &quot;Return of the Mother&quot; for Christine Maggiore. In 2001 she collaborated with Rosenstolz and Marc Almond on the single &quot;Total eclipse&quot;/&quot;Die schwarze Witwe&quot; that reached No. 22 in Germany. On 14 October 2002 Nina hit Moscow by coming there with her concert, while interviews with the eccentric singer were aired on many TV-channels.

Hagen dubbed the voice of Sally in the German release of Tim Burton&#x27;s &quot;The Nightmare Before Christmas&quot;, Yubaba/Zeniba in &quot;Spirited Away&quot; and she has also done voice work on the movie &quot;Hot Dogs&quot; by Michael Schoemann. Due to the death of Elisabeth Volkmann (†2006), the German voice of Marge, during the dubbing of the hit TV show &quot;The Simpsons&quot; 17th season, Nina was a strong contender for the role, which eventually went to Anke Engelke. Hagen has been featured on songs by other bands, for instance on Oomph!&#x27;s song &quot;Fieber&quot;. She did a cover of Rammstein&#x27;s &quot;Seemann&quot; with Apocalyptica. Later albums include &quot;Big Band Explosion&quot; (2003), in which she sang numerous swing covers with her then husband, Danish singer and performer, Lucas Alexander. This was followed by &quot;Heiß&quot;, a greatest hits album. The following album, &quot;Journey to the Snow Queen&quot;, is more of an audio book – she reads the &quot;Snow Queen&quot; fairy tale with Tchaikovsky&#x27;s &quot;The Nutcracker&quot; in the background. In 2005 Nina Hagen headlined the Drop Dead Festival in New York City. Hagen was an active protester against the war in Iraq. In 2006 she was a part of the Popstars team. In August 2009 she was baptized in the Protestant Reformed church of Schüttorf. On 21 October after seven years passed she visited Moscow again.

===2010–present: &quot;Personal Jesus&quot;, &quot;Volksbeat&quot; and &quot;Unity&quot;===

After a four-year lapse her next album, &quot;Personal Jesus&quot;, was released 16 July 2010, followed by &quot;Volksbeat&quot;, released 11 November 2011.

When Angela Merkel ended her 16-year chancellorship of Germany in December 2021, she chose Hagen&#x27;s song &quot;Du hast den Farbfilm vergessen&quot; (You Forgot the Colour Film) as one of the three pieces to be played at her &quot;Großer Zapfenstreich&quot; military leaving ceremony.

===Controversies===

In 1987, she caught the attention of the media by announcing her marriage to a 17-year-old South African punk named Iroquois, whom she met in Rome in 1985. The song &quot;Punk Wedding&quot; was written for the wedding and Hagen described the event as a marriage between the punk and new age movements. The wedding was scheduled on August 9, 1987.

<text>Interstate 795 (I-795), also known as the Northwest Expressway, is a auxiliary Interstate Highway linking Baltimore&#x27;s northwestern suburbs of Pikesville, Owings Mills, and Reisterstown, Maryland, to the Baltimore Beltway (I-695). The route bypasses Maryland Route 140 (MD 140; Reisterstown Road), carrying part of the Maryland Transit Administration (MTA)&#x27;s Baltimore Metro SubwayLink in its median for a stretch, and provides direct access to the former Owings Mills Mall. It never connects to its parent, I-95, except via I-695.

==Route description==

I-795 begins in Pikesville at a directional T interchange with I-695 (Baltimore Beltway), which heads south toward Glen Burnie and east toward Towson. I-695 provides access to I-95 in the directions of Washington, D.C., and Philadelphia to highways into Baltimore. Immediately to the east of the interchange is Old Court station of the MTA&#x27;s Baltimore Metro SubwayLink, which passes through the interchange and settles into the median of the six-lane freeway as they cross Gwynns Falls. I-795 parallels and has two crossings of CSX Transportation&#x27;s Hanover Subdivision as the freeway and transit line head northwest. The subway line ends just north of its and the highway&#x27;s second crossing of Gwynns Falls at the terminal Owings Mills station.
Immediately to the northwest of the subway terminus is I-795&#x27;s interchange with Owings Mills Boulevard (unsigned MD 940), which is a partial cloverleaf interchange with flyover ramps from northbound I-795 to southbound Owings Mills Boulevard and from the southbound boulevard to the southbound Interstate. The interchange also features direct ramps with the Metro Centre at Owings Mills to and from the direction of Baltimore and direct ramps with the subway station to and from the direction of Reisterstown. I-795 continues northwest as a four-lane freeway. The highway has a partial cloverleaf interchange with Franklin Boulevard before reaching its northern terminus at MD 140 on the edge of Reisterstown. The terminus consists of direct ramps with MD 140 to and from the direction of Westminster and an intersection with MD 140 (Westminster Pike) and MD 795, an unnamed and unsigned connector between the intersection and an intersection with MD 30 and MD 128 on the north side of Reisterstown.
==History==

The Northwest Expressway was one of the first freeways planned for construction in the state of Maryland. The first section to the Owings Mills exit was completed in 1985; the remaining were completed in 1987.

The original plan was for the highway to run into the city of Baltimore along a similar route to that of the Baltimore Metro SubwayLink. Plans to extend the highway beyond its current configuration have not been sought out by highway officials in Maryland. This alignment would most likely have terminated at the northern terminus of Wabash Avenue (at Patterson Avenue), which parallels the elevated section of the Baltimore Metro SubwayLink.

== Future ==
MDOT SHA plans to construct a diamond interchange at Dolfield Boulevard in the future. The construction of the interchange is to widen that section of I 795 from four to six lanes, relocate Tollgate Road, and construct new sidewalk, bicycle, drainage, stormwater management, and traffic and landscape upgrades. It would also improve access between Red Run Boulevard and I 795. A public open house was held at New Town High School on May 1, 2024.

<text>An episode is a narrative unit within a larger dramatic work or documentary production, such as a series intended for radio, television or streaming consumption. 

The noun &quot;episode&quot; is derived from the Greek term &quot;epeisodion&quot; (). It is abbreviated as &quot;&quot; (&quot;plural&quot; eps).

An episode is also a narrative unit within a &quot;continuous&quot; larger dramatic work. It is frequently used to describe units of television or radio series that are broadcast separately in order to form one longer series. An episode is to a sequence as a chapter is to a book. Modern series episodes typically last 20 to 50 minutes in length.

The noun &quot;episode&quot; can also refer to a part of a subject, such as an &quot;episode of life&quot; or an &quot;episode of drama&quot;.

<doc id="464274" wikidata="Q378312" url="?curid=464274" title="Whitewash">
<text>Whitewash, calcimine, kalsomine, calsomine, asbestis or lime paint is a type of paint made from slaked lime (calcium hydroxide, Ca(OH)2) or chalk (calcium carbonate, CaCO3), sometimes known as &quot;whiting&quot;. Various other additives are sometimes used.

==Use as paint==

Whitewash cures through a reaction with carbon dioxide in the atmosphere to form calcium carbonate in the form of calcite, a type of reaction generally known as carbonation or by the more specific term, carbonatation.

It is usually applied to exteriors, or interiors of rural dairies because of its mildly antibacterial properties. Whitewash can be tinted for decorative use and is sometimes painted inside structures such as the hallways of apartment buildings. A small amount can rub off onto clothing. In Britain and Ireland, whitewash was used historically in interiors and exteriors of workers&#x27; cottages and still retains something of this association with rural poverty. In the United States, a similar attitude is expressed in the old saying &quot;Too proud to whitewash and too poor to paint.&quot; The historic California Missions were commonly whitewashed, giving them their distinctive bright white appearance.

Whitewash is especially compatible with masonry because it is absorbed easily and the resultant chemical reaction hardens the medium.

Limewash is pure slaked lime in water. It produces a unique surface glow due to the double refraction of calcite crystals. Limewash and whitewash both cure to become the same material.

When whitewash or limewash is initially applied, it has very low opacity, which can lead novices to overthicken the paint. Drying increases opacity and subsequent curing increases opacity even further.

Limewash relies on being drawn into a substrate unlike a modern paint that adheres to the surface. The process of being drawn in needs to be controlled by damping down. If a wall is not damped, it can leave the lime and pigments on the surface powdery; if the wall is saturated, then there is no surface tension and this can result in failure of the limewash. Damping down is not difficult but it does need to be considered before application of the limewash.

===Additives===
Additives traditionally used include water glass, glue, egg white, Portland cement, salt, soap, milk, flour, molasses, alum, and soil.

Whitewash is sometimes coloured with earths to achieve colours spanning the range of broken white, cream, yellow, and a range of browns.

The blue laundry dye (such as Reckitt&#x27;s &quot;Dolly Blue&quot; in the UK, Ireland and Australia, Loulaki in Greece, or Mrs. Stewart&#x27;s Bluing in North America), formerly widely used to give a bright tinge to boiled white textiles, was a common 19th century addition.

Historically, pig&#x27;s blood was added to give the colour Suffolk pink, a colour still widely used on house exteriors in some areas of the UK. If animal blood is applied excessively, its iron oxide can compromise the lime binder&#x27;s strength.

Pozzolanic materials are occasionally added to give a much harder wearing paint finish. This addition creates a short open time and therefore requires timely application of the altered paint.

Linseed oil is sometimes added (typically 0.5-2%) to improve adhesion on difficult surfaces.

Cement addition makes a harder wearing paint in white or grey. Open time is short, so this is added at point of use. Cement restricts the breathable aspects of the limewash and is inadvisable for preserved historic buildings.

Dilute glues improve paint toughness.

Wheat flour has been used as a strength enhancing binder. Salt is often added to prevent mold.

=== Limitations ===
Basic limewash can be inadequate in its ability to prevent rain-driven water ingress. Additives are being developed but these have the potential for affecting free vapor permeability. For this reason silicate paints, more common in Germany, are gaining popularity in the UK over limewash.

== Applications ==

=== Orchards ===
Whitewash is applied to trees, especially fruit trees, to prevent sun scald. Most often only the lower trunk is painted. In Poland painting the whole trunk is also said to help keep the body of the tree cool in late winter and early spring months and hence help prevent fruit trees from blooming too soon, i.e. when warm sunny days could promote rapid tree warming, rising sap and bloom and intermittent frosty nights could damage outer tree rings and destroy the young buds and blossoms.

=== Dairy barns ===
In the middle of the 20th century, when family farms with dairy barns were common in the Upper Midwest of the United States, whitewashing was a necessary part of routine barn maintenance.

A traditional animal barn contains a variety of rough surfaces that are difficult to wash and keep clean, such as stone and brick masonry, and also rough-cut lumber for the ceiling. If left alone, these surfaces collect dust, dirt, and insect debris and wastes, and can become very dirty.

Whitewash aids in sanitation by coating and smoothing over the rough surfaces. Successive applications of whitewash build up layers of scale that flake off and, in the process, remove surface debris. The coating also has antimicrobial properties that provide hygienic and sanitary benefits for animal barns.

=== Other uses ===
Whitewash was painted on the internal walls of Royal Navy vessels during the Age of Sail to improve light levels inside a vessel&#x27;s gundeck, reduce bacteria and prevent wear and tear on hull timbers. It was also used during the Second World War by the German armed forces as an easy-to-apply winter camouflage for soft- and hard-skinned vehicles, aircraft and helmets.

==Removal==
While calcimine was generally stable with oil paint, current latex paints blister and peel.
No success has been reported with primers and other glues over top of a peeling wall. The only approach is to scrape it off. The chalk releases the paint in large flakes or small chips. While working, the wall sections of paint will appear to be solid and later come off easily. It is a long process.

==In popular culture==

The incident of Tom Sawyer whitewashing a fence as punishment is a famous image in American literature. It appears in &quot;The Adventures of Tom Sawyer&quot; written in 1876 by Mark Twain.

In the 1934 film, &quot;Fugitive Lovers&quot;, Madge Evans drops a bottle of cosmetics that she calls her &quot;Calcimine&quot;.

Metaphorically, whitewashing refers to suppression or &quot;glossing over&quot; (possibly a close parallel construction) of potentially damaging or unwelcome information. In many Commonwealth areas, a whitewash refers to a game in which one side fails to score at all; the usage is especially found in cricket.

<doc id="464275" wikidata="Q742499" url="?curid=464275" title="Earl of Lonsdale">
<text>Earl of Lonsdale is a title that has been created twice in British history, firstly in the Peerage of Great Britain in 1784 (becoming extinct in 1802), and then in the Peerage of the United Kingdom in 1807, both times for members of the Lowther family.

This family descends from Sir Richard Lowther (1532–1607), of Lowther Hall, Westmorland, who served as Lord Warden of the West Marches.

==First creation==
His great-grandson, John Lowther, was created a baronet, of Lowther in the County of Westmorland, in the Baronetage of Nova Scotia in circa 1638. He was succeeded by his grandson, the second Baronet (the son of John Lowther, eldest son of the first Baronet). He was an influential politician and held several ministerial posts during the reign of William III. In 1696 he was raised to the Peerage of England as Baron Lowther and Viscount Lonsdale. His eldest son, the second Viscount, died unmarried at an early age and was succeeded by his younger brother, the third Viscount. He was also a prominent politician. On his death in 1751 the barony and viscountcy became extinct.

The late Viscount was succeeded in the baronetcy by his second cousin, James Lowther, the fifth Baronet. He was the son of Robert Lowther, son of Richard Lowther, second son of the first Baronet. Lowther was a Member of Parliament for over twenty years and served as Lord-Lieutenant of Westmorland and Cumberland. He inherited not only the Lowther estates in Westmorland, but also the Whitehaven estates that had recently belonged to Sir James Lowther. In 1784 he was raised to the Peerage of Great Britain as Baron Lowther, of Lowther in the County of Westmorland, Baron of the Barony of Kendal in the County of Westmorland and Baron of the Barony of Burgh in the County of Cumberland, Viscount Lonsdale, Viscount Lowther and Earl of Lonsdale, with normal remainder to the heirs male of his body. The Earl was childless and all his titles were heading for extinction. In 1797 he was therefore created Baron Lowther, of Whitehaven in the County of Cumberland, and Viscount Lowther, of Whitehaven in the County of Cumberland, with remainder to the heirs male of his deceased third cousin, Reverend Sir William Lowther, 1st Baronet, of Little Preston, to whom he also devised his considerable estates. These titles were also in the Peerage of Great Britain. On Lord Lonsdale&#x27;s death in 1802, the baronetcy and the peerages of 1784 became extinct.

He was succeeded in the barony and viscountcy of 1797 according to the special remainder by his third cousin once removed, Sir William Lowther, 2nd Baronet, of Little Preston. He was the elder son of the aforementioned Reverend Sir William Lowther, 1st Baronet, of Little Preston, great-grandson of Sir William Lowther, brother of Sir John Lowther, 1st Baronet, of Lowther (see Lowther Baronets for a more comprehensive history of this branch of the family).

==Second creation==
In 1807 the earldom of Lonsdale was revived when he was created Earl of Lonsdale, in the County of Westmorland, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. The same year he was also made a Knight of the Garter. He was succeeded by his eldest son, the second Earl. He was a prominent Tory politician and notably served as Postmaster General and Lord President of the Council. In 1841 he was summoned to the House of Lords through a writ of acceleration in his father&#x27;s junior title of Baron Lowther. He was childless and on his death the titles passed to his nephew, the third Earl. He was the eldest son of the Hon. Henry Lowther, second son of the first Earl. He represented Cumberland West in the House of Commons and served as Lord-Lieutenant of Westmorland and Cumberland. His eldest son, the fourth Earl, died without male issue at an early age and was succeeded by his younger brother, the fifth Earl. He became known as &quot;England&#x27;s greatest sporting gentleman&quot;. He was succeeded by his younger brother, the sixth Earl. As at 2021 the titles are held by the latter&#x27;s grandson, the ninth Earl, who succeeded his half-brother in that year.

Numerous other members of this family have also gained distinction. John Lowther, eldest son of the first Baronet and father of the second Baronet, was Member of Parliament for Appleby. His son from his second marriage, William Lowther (who was born posthumously), sat as Member of Parliament for Carlisle. Richard Lowther, younger son of the first Baronet, was Member of Parliament for Appleby. His son Robert Lowther, the father of the fifth Baronet, was a Member of Parliament and Governor of Barbados. The Hon. Anthony Lowther, third son of the first Viscount, sat as a Member of Parliament. Sir James Lowther, 1st Baronet, of Swillington, younger brother of the first Earl of the second creation, was created a Baronet in 1824 (see Lowther baronets). Henry Lowther, second son of the first Earl of the second creation and father of the third Earl, was a Conservative politician. His third son William Lowther was a diplomat and politician. He was the father of James Lowther, 1st Viscount Ullswater (see Viscount Ullswater), Sir Gerard Lowther, 1st Baronet (see Lowther baronets) and Sir Cecil Lowther.

<text>Peter Charles Theisinger (August 7, 1945 – June 26, 2024) was the director of the Engineering and Science Directorate at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California and was the project manager of NASA&#x27;s Mars Exploration Rover Mission and later project manager for the 2011 Mars Science Laboratory mission.

Theisinger was born in Fresno, California in 1945 and graduated from the California Institute of Technology in 1967 with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in physics. He joined NASA&#x27;s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) as payload integration engineer that year and except for a three-year span in the early 1980s has worked at JPL since. Among the missions on which he has participated were the 1967 Mariner 5 flyby mission to Venus, the 1971 Mariner 9 orbiter mission to Mars, the Voyager mission to the outer planets of the Solar System, the &quot;Galileo&quot; mission to Jupiter, and the Mars Global Surveyor orbiter.

In 2013, Theisinger, along with Richard Cook, was named one of &quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s 100 Most Influential People in the World as a pioneer for his role in getting the &quot;Curiosity&quot; rover to Mars safely in August 2012.

Theisinger died in La Crescenta, California from throat cancer on June 26, 2024, at the age of 78.

<text>The animated science fiction television program &quot;Futurama&quot; makes a number of satirical and humorous references to religion, including inventing several fictional religions which are explored in certain episodes of the series.

== Fictional religions ==

=== Robotology ===
The episode &quot;Hell Is Other Robots&quot; centers around Bender&#x27;s becoming addicted to high-voltage electricity, then discovering the religion of Robotology to help him break the habit. Sermons are conducted at the Temple of Robotology by the Reverend Preacherbot, a character whose mannerisms draw heavily on black church preacher stereotypes. &quot;Robotology&quot; is a play on the name Scientology, and series creator Matt Groening has said that he received a call from the Church of Scientology concerned about the use of a similar name.
Robotology has a holy text, &quot;The Good Book 3.0&quot; which is stored on a 3.5&quot; floppy disk. Two symbols of the religion are shown in the episode. The first is a zig-zag line with a circle at either end, based on the electronic symbol used for resistors on circuit diagrams. 

Robots who accept Robotology are expected to abstain from behavior such as smoking, pornography, stealing, abusing electricity, and drinking alcohol. Consuming alcohol is usually necessary to power a robot&#x27;s fuel cells, but this episode establishes that mineral oil is an acceptable substitute. Sinners are punished by condemnation to Robot Hell, located under an abandoned amusement park in Atlantic City, New Jersey. The punishments in Robot Hell are similar to the levels and rationale portrayed in Dante&#x27;s &quot;Divine Comedy&quot;, specifically the &quot;Inferno&quot;.

Robot Hell is controlled by the Robot Devil. He is bound by the Fairness in Hell Act of 2275, allowing anyone to win their freedom by defeating him in a fiddle contest with a solid gold fiddle, a reference to the song &quot;The Devil Went Down to Georgia&quot;. Should the individual lose the fiddle contest, they will only receive a smaller, silver fiddle and the Robot Devil may kill them at his discretion.

In &quot;Ghost in the Machines&quot;, Bender&#x27;s ghost is sent to an equivalent robot Heaven monitored by a Robot God whose streamlined design is reminiscent of EVE in the Pixar animated film &quot;WALL-E&quot;. This God appears to be distinct from the more ambiguous, universal &#x27;God&#x27; character that appeared in &quot;Godfellas&quot; and &quot;Bender&#x27;s Big Score&quot;, who may or may not have been representative of the Gods of all religions, and/or a machine. Notably, the Robot God does not deny being God and treats Bender&#x27;s ghost as his subject.

=== Robot Judaism ===
The episode &quot;Future Stock&quot; introduces Robot Judaism in a scene where Fry and Dr. Zoidberg, seeking free food, sneak into a &quot;Bot Mitzvah&quot; celebration (a spoof of the Bar and Bat Mitzvah). As a joke about Jewish dietary laws&#x27; proscriptions against shellfish, Zoidberg was not allowed in (despite having Jewish stereotype qualities), as he was an anthropomorphic lobster. At the Bot Mitzvah, Fry asks a Jewish robot if they don&#x27;t believe in Robot Jesus, to which the robot replies, &quot;We believe he was built, and that he was a very well-programmed robot, but he wasn&#x27;t our Messiah&quot;. A banner written in Hebrew reads &quot;Today you are a robot&quot; (with two misspellings), referencing the traditional Jewish belief that a boy becomes a man at age 13, which is celebrated on his Bar Mitzvah. In the episode &quot;The Bots and the Bees&quot; Bender&#x27;s son, Ben, has a Bot Mitzvah celebration of his own where he becomes a man after being born only a few days prior. This scene reinforces the quick rate at which robots mature in the &quot;Futurama&quot; world as well as alludes to the practice of robot circumcision.

References to a holiday called &#x27;Robanukah&#x27; appear in several episodes, as well, though it is heavily implied that Bender makes up this holiday to avoid work. In the &quot;Futurama Holiday Spectacular&quot;, the Robanukah story involves a pair of fembots who must wrestle in petroleum oil for six and a half weeks. When the oil, which was predicted to last only four and a half weeks, lasts for 500 million years, Bender declares it a Robanukah miracle.

=== The First Amalgamated Church ===

The First Amalgamated Church is a syncretic denomination of several mainstream religions extant in the 21st century, and is referenced in several episodes. The church and one of its priests, Father Changstein el-Gamal, are introduced in the episode &quot;Godfellas&quot;. Father Changstein el-Gamal reappears in &quot;The Sting&quot; at Fry&#x27;s funeral service, and in &quot;Bender&#x27;s Big Score&quot; at Lars and Leela&#x27;s wedding. The religion appears to be a mix of Buddhism, Christianity, Judaism, Hinduism, Islam and even agnosticism.

===Other religions===
Other religions are depicted or mentioned in passing in other episodes. In the episode &quot;Hell Is Other Robots&quot;, Professor Farnsworth complains about Bender&#x27;s devotion to Robotology, saying, &quot;If only he had joined a mainstream religion, like Oprahism or Voodoo&quot;.

In the season 2 episode &quot;I Second That Emotion&quot;, Fry, Leela, and Bender are shown around the sewer mutants&#x27; village. Fry notices a large gold-plated ICBM on the altar of the cathedral and exclaims &quot;Wow! You guys worship an unexploded nuclear bomb?&quot; to which one of the mutants responds &quot;Yeah, but nobody is that observant. It&#x27;s mostly a Christmas and Easter thing.&quot; The altar and the bomb are a reference to the film &quot;Beneath the Planet of the Apes&quot;, in which the subterranean mutants worship a nuclear bomb.

The season 4 episode &quot;Where No Fan Has Gone Before&quot;, presents the situation of a television show becoming elevated to the status of a religion in the form of the &quot;Church of Trek&quot;, where devotees of &quot;Star Trek&quot; worship the characters and attend services dressed as officers and aliens from the show (in 23rd or 24th century).

In the second &quot;Futurama&quot; direct-to-video film, &quot;The Beast with a Billion Backs&quot;, Fry becomes the pope of a new religion which worships the interdimensional planet-sized tentacle monster named Yivo (pronouns: shkle/shkler/shklim), who brainwashed the inhabitants of Earth by attaching shkler tentacles to their brains, before taking them onto shklim, which resembled heaven.

In the third film &quot;Bender&#x27;s Game&quot;, Professor Farnsworth invokes the name of &quot;the all-powerful Atheismo&quot;.

In the season 7 episode &quot;Free Will Hunting&quot;, when Bender walks throughout Chapek 9 looking to discover his never-programmed free-will unit, he happens upon a religious monastery led by a monk named Ab-bot; the abbot takes him in and converts him into his religion called &quot;Order of the Binary Singularity&quot; believing in the promise &quot;Creatrix&quot; or Mom will give them free-will units.

== References to existing religions ==
Aside from inventing religions, the writers of &quot;Futurama&quot; also make references to established faiths.

In the episode &quot;When Aliens Attack&quot;, Earth is invaded by Omicronians demanding to see the season finale of &quot;Single Female Lawyer&quot;, a television show which was accidentally knocked off the air 1,000 years earlier by Fry. Professor Farnsworth explains that the show no longer exists because most video tapes from that era were destroyed during the Second Coming of Jesus in the year 2443. Ken Keeler, the writer of the episode, considered this joke one of the most blasphemous lines in the show, because it suggested that the Second Coming had come and gone but life for the unsaved on Earth had carried on much as before.

Jesus is referenced several times throughout the show, the most notable being on &quot;A Tale of Two Santas&quot;, where all of the crew dress up as Santa and Zoidberg dresses up as &quot;his friend Jesus&quot; to attempt to stay Bender&#x27;s execution. When the real Robot Santa appears and attacks the crew and the people attempting to execute Bender, the executioner exclaims &quot;Get him, Jesus!&quot; before diving behind an object, and in reference to Benjamin Franklin&#x27;s famous remark, Zoidberg replies, &quot;I help those who help themselves.&quot;

On several occasions, Professor Farnsworth uses the phrase &quot;Sweet Zombie Jesus!&quot; as an expression of shock or dismay. These exclamations are usually cut for syndication in the United States. In the DVD of &quot;Futurama&quot; episode &quot;The Deep South,&quot; a cut scene shows Farnsworth muttering in his sleep about the Zombie Jesus returning at tea-time, when Farnsworth has no food to supply it.

Another undead figure, Chanukah Zombie, first mentioned in the episode &quot;A Tale of Two Santas&quot;, makes an appearance in &quot;Bender&#x27;s Big Score&quot;. He teams up with Robot Santa and Kwanzaa Bot to fight alien scam artists who have seized possession of planet Earth. His weapons are themed around Jewish symbols and artifacts, including explosive dreidels and a TIE fighter (a reference to &quot;Star Wars&quot;; &quot;Star Wars&quot; actor Mark Hamill supplies Chanukah Zombie&#x27;s voice) adorned with Stars of David and a menorah.

Catholicism is shown to still exist in some form in the 31st century, as the show makes several references to the &quot;Space Pope&quot;: in the opening titles of &quot;Hell is Other Robots&quot; (stating that the show has been &quot;Condemned by the Space Pope&quot;); in &quot;A Bicyclops Built for Two&quot;, with Bender&#x27;s rhetorical question &quot;Is the Space Pope reptilian?&quot;; and in &quot;I Dated a Robot&quot;, in an endorsement at the end of an educational film (&quot;Brought to you by the Space Pope&quot;). In the last of these, a graphic displays a picture of the Space Pope as a reptilian alien in Papal vestments, encircled by the words &quot;Crocodylus pontifex&quot;. Additionally, in the episode &quot;Put Your Head on My Shoulders&quot;, Fry and Amy Wong have a lighthearted conversation about their parents&#x27; expectations of them; Fry remarks, &quot;What am I, the Pope?&quot; to which Amy replies, &quot;Yeah, and if you were the Pope they&#x27;d be all, &#x27;Straighten your Pope hat,&#x27; and &#x27;Put on your good vestments!&#x27;&quot; In the sixth season episode, &quot;The Duh-Vinci Code&quot;, the cast travels to Rome (announced as Future-Roma), where the Space Pope directs the ship&#x27;s landing at the Vatican. A few episodes later, in &quot;The Silence of the Clamps,&quot; the Space Pope is shown conducting the wedding of the Donbot&#x27;s older daughter.

Conversely, Satanism is also shown to still exist in some form in the 31st century. In the episode &quot;A Taste of Freedom,&quot; Zoidberg&#x27;s lawyer, Old Man Waterfall, requests a Satanic funeral rite before dying, and Professor Farnsworth, in &quot;The Farnsworth Parabox&quot;, when he is presumably creating the box containing the parallel universe, appeals to Satan for help, mentioning that Satan owes him.

It is implied that some form of Neopaganism may still exist in the future, based on references to a lesbian coven across the street from Planet Express in &quot;Future Stock&quot;.

In &quot;The Lesser of Two Evils,&quot; one of the Miss Universe pageant contestants is an energy being identified, with little fanfare, as &quot;Miss Heaven&quot;, suggesting that by the 31st century, Heaven is an accessible part of the universe rather than a divine afterlife attainable only after death. However, another possibility is that Miss Heaven is simply from a conventional planet that has been &quot;named&quot; &quot;Heaven&quot;.

Also, Hermes Conrad, who is Jamaican, claims to be Rastafari.

== Godfellas ==
The episode &quot;Godfellas&quot; explores several religious themes in a more earnest and thought-provoking way than any other episode, and without explicitly referencing or parodying any particular religion. Bender is accidentally cast adrift in space and unwittingly becomes a god figure to a race of tiny people (Shrimpkins) living on an asteroid that impacts his body. Bender attempts to answer their prayers, but ends up harming the Shrimpkins. Meanwhile, the Shrimpkins who have migrated to Bender&#x27;s backside, out of his sight, grow frustrated that their prayers go entirely unanswered. Eventually the two factions of Shrimpkins wipe one another out in a miniature nuclear war.

After Bender&#x27;s unsuccessful attempt at godhood, he encounters a god-like entity in space. Bender first wonders if the entity is God, because of its awesome power or a computer because it thinks in binary. The entity responds &quot;Possible, I do feel compassion towards all living things&quot; and &quot;Possible, I am user-friendly&quot; respectively, adding &quot;My good chum&quot; to the end both times. Bender eventually theorizes that the entity may have, in fact, been the remains of a satellite that collided with God, to which the entity replies &quot;Probable&quot;. The conversation between them touches on the ideas of predestination, prayer, and the nature of salvation, in what Mark Pinsky referred to as a theological turn to the episode which may cause the viewer to need &quot;to be reminded that this is a cartoon and not a divinity school class&quot;. By the end of the conversation, Bender&#x27;s questions still have not been fully answered, and he is left wanting more from the voice than it has given him. The character/entity returned, albeit briefly, in the first of the direct-to-DVD installments, &quot;Bender&#x27;s Big Score&quot;.

The episode also sees Fry turning to religion to help locate Bender. Seeking guidance, he visits the First Amalgamated Church. When this fails to help him, Fry visits the &quot;Monks of Dschubba&quot; to use the radio telescope of a sect of monks who are attempting to find God in the universe. This subplot takes religion much more lightly, referring to the monks as a &quot;crazy sect&quot; and suggesting that prayer is usually unreliable.

The episode also makes reference to &quot;The Nine Billion Names of God&quot;, a story by Arthur C. Clarke.

The book &quot;Toons That Teach&quot;, a text used by youth groups to teach teenagers about spirituality, recommends the episode &quot;Godfellas&quot; in a lesson teaching about &quot;Faith, God&#x27;s Will, [and] Image of God&quot;.

<text>Farruca () is a form of flamenco music developed in the late 19th century. Classified as a cante chico, it is traditionally sung and danced by men. Its origin is traditionally associated with Galicia, a region in northern Spain.

An instrumental adaptation of the farruca was developed by guitarist Ramón Montoya and flamenco dancer Faíco in the 20th century. Others who stylized and expanded farruca include Antonio de Bilbao, Manolito la Rosa and El Batato. Although there are female flamenco dancers who exclusively danced farruca too (such as Rafaela Valverde &quot;La Tanguera&quot;), these female dancers originally danced the farruca wearing male clothing. Women dancers such as Carmen Amaya and Sara Baras have also created well-known versions of the dance.

== History ==
Farruco is a way of calling the Franciscos and the Asturians in Andalusia. Farruco was also the name that people from Andalusia used to denominate people from Galicia, from where this song likely originates. In Flamenco, being mostly an oral tradition, the lyrics often give valuable hints about their origins, and Farruca lyrics undoubtedly allude to the Galicia region. Further proof can be established from the descending melody that is performed on the vowel &#x27;a&#x27; at the end of each couplet and to close the &quot;cante&quot; (Spanish for song or singing), which in a certain way tends to imitate the Galician melos. Another feature of Farruca cante is the use of glossolalia, &quot;con el tran-tran-tran-treiro&quot;, which is reminiscent of the Galician region. It has to be stressed, though, that to this day its geographic origin has not been proven scientifically.

== Dance ==
The original dance version is due to the Sevillian dancer Faíco who was accompanied by Ramón Montoya, who is said to have invented the typical farruca melody for the guitar. The success was thunderous and from then on many other dancers stylized and expanded this flamenco style, such as El Gato or Antonio Gades. Montoya&#x27;s dance adaptation of the farruca is seldom sung. It is commonly played in the key of A minor, with each compás equivalent to 2 measures of 4/4 time with emphasis on the 1st, 3rd, 5th, and 7th beats: [1] 2 [3] 4 [5] 6 [7] 8

The dance often has fast turns, quick intense footwork, held lifts and falls, dramatic poses and bursts of filigrana (often with a flat hand). It can also be danced with a cape.

<text>Konstantinos Mitsotakis (, ; – 29 May 2017) was a Greek politician who was Prime Minister of Greece from 1990 to 1993. He graduated in law and economics from the University of Athens. His son, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, was elected as the Prime Minister of Greece following the 2019 Greek legislative election.

== Family and personal life ==
Mitsotakis was born on 31 October 1918 in Halepa suburb, Chania, Crete, into an already powerful political family, linked to the distinguished statesman Eleftherios Venizelos on both sides. His grandfather (1845–1898), a lawyer, journalist and short-time MP of then Ottoman-ruled Crete, founded the Liberal Party, then &quot;Party of the Barefeet&quot; () with Venizelos, and married the latter&#x27;s sister, Katigo Venizelou, Constantine&#x27;s grandmother. The 1878 Pact of Halepa, granting an Ottoman Crete a certain level of autonomy, was signed in his very home. His father (1883–1944), also MP for Chania in the Greek Parliament (1915–20) and leader of the Cretan volunteers fighting with the Greek army in the First Balkan War, married Stavroula Ploumidaki, daughter of , the first Christian mayor of Chania and an MP at the time of the Cretan State, himself a first cousin of Eleftherios Venizelos.

Mitsotakis was married to Marika Mitsotakis (née Giannoukou) from 1953 until her death on 6 May 2012. They had four children. His son, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, is the Prime Minister of Greece and since January 2016 leader of the conservative New Democracy party (a position previously held by Mitsotakis), and was a government minister in 2013–15. His first daughter, Dora Bakoyannis, ND Member of Parliament, founder and president of Democratic Alliance party, was the mayor of Athens (2003–2006) and the Minister of Foreign Affairs from 2006 to 2009. His second daughter Alexandra Mitsotakis Gourdain is a Greek civil society activist. His third daughter is Katerina Mitsotakis.

Mitsotakis&#x27;s interests outside politics included Cretan antiquities and a passion for preserving the environment. He developed a large collection of Minoan and other Cretan antiquities, which he and his wife donated to the Greek state. He was also very interested in promoting reforesting of Greece, including in particular the mountains of Crete.

=== Venizelos/Mitsotakis family tree ===
==Political career==
Mitsotakis was elected to the Greek Parliament for the first time in 1946, standing for the Liberal Party in his native prefecture of Chania, Crete. He followed most of the old Liberal Party into Georgios Papandreou&#x27;s Center Union in 1961. But in 1965 he led a group of dissidents, known as the &quot;July apostates&quot;, who crossed the floor to bring about the fall of , which earned him the long-time hatred of Papandreou loyalists as well as a significant part of Greek society. He was arrested in 1967 by the military junta but managed to escape to Turkey with a help of Turkish foreign minister İhsan Sabri Çağlayangil and lived in exile with his family in Paris, France, until his return to Greece in 1974, following the restoration of democracy.

In 1974, he campaigned as an independent and failed to be elected to Parliament. He was re-elected in 1977 as founder and leader of the small Party of New Liberals, and he merged his party with Constantine Karamanlis&#x27;s New Democracy (ND) party in 1978. He served as Minister for Coordination from 1978 to 1980, and as Minister for Foreign Affairs from 1980 to 1981.

The ND government was defeated by Andreas Papandreou&#x27;s PASOK in 1981, and in 1984 Mitsotakis succeeded Evangelos Averoff as ND leader. He and Andreas Papandreou, the son of Georgios Papandreou, dominated Greek politics for the next decade: their mutual dislike dated back to the fall of Georgios Papandreou&#x27;s government in 1965.

Mitsotakis and Papandreou had a polarizing dispute regarding Papandreou&#x27;s dubious tactics in not supporting Karamanlis for a second presidential term and proposing far-reaching constitutional amendments that caused a constitutional crisis in 1985.

Mitsotakis soundly defeated Papandreou, embroiled in the Koskotas scandal scandal, in the June 1989 election. PASOK lost 36 seats in one of the largest defeats of a sitting government in modern Greek history. However, in a controversial move, Papandreou&#x27;s government had modified the election system just two months earlier, to require a party to win 50 percent of the vote in order to govern alone. Thus, even though ND was the clear first-place party, with 20 more seats than PASOK, it only won 44 percent of the vote, leaving it six seats short of a majority. 

After Mitsotakis failed to garner enough support to form a government, Court of Cassation president Yannis Grivas became acting prime minister and presided over new elections in November 1989. This election yielded the same result as in June. ND finished 20 seats ahead of PASOK, but only won 46.2 percent of the vote and came up three seats short of a majority. Former Bank of Greece president Xenophon Zolotas became interim prime minister and presided over fresh elections in April 1990. The result was the same as the two 1989 elections. ND won a landslide victory, finishing 27 seats ahead of PASOK. However, Mitsotakis was still unable to govern alone, as ND won 150 seats, one short of a majority. Finally, the lone MP from Democratic Renewal agreed to a coalition with ND, allowing Mitsotakis to form government by one seat.

In social policy family benefits were introduced for families with 3 children or more. IKA pension replacement rates, however, were reduced from 80% to 60%, while the retirement age was raised to 65 for both men and women who entered the workforce in 1993.

Mitsotakis&#x27;s government moved swiftly to cut government spending as much as possible, privatise state enterprises and reform the civil service. In foreign policy, Mitsotakis took the initiative to have Greece formally recognize the state of Israel, and moved to reopen talks on American bases in Greece and to restore confidence among Greece&#x27;s economic and political partners. In June 1990, Mitsotakis became the first Greek Premier to visit the United States since 1974. He promised to meet Greece&#x27;s NATO obligations, to prevent the use of Greece as a base for terrorism, and to stop the rhetorical attacks on the United States that had been Papandreou&#x27;s hallmark. Mitsotakis also supported a new dialogue with Turkey, but made progress on the Cyprus dispute a prerequisite for improvement on other issues.

Papandreou, cleared of charges arising from the Koskotas scandal in a 7–6 vote at the &quot;Eidiko Dikastirio&quot; (Special Court), criticised Mitsotakis&#x27;s government for its economic policies, for not taking a sufficiently strict position over the naming dispute with the newly independent Republic of Macedonia (Mitsotakis favored a composite name such as &quot;Nova Macedonia&quot;, for which he was accused at the time of being too lenient) as well as over Cyprus, and for being too pro-American. The heightened public irritation over the Macedonia naming issue caused several ND parliament members, led by Antonis Samaras, to withdraw their support from Mitsotakis&#x27;s government and form a new political party, Political Spring (&quot; , &quot;). Mitsotakis&#x27; government restored the pre-1989 electoral system, which allowed Papandreou&#x27;s PASOK to obtain a clear parliamentary majority after winning the premature 1993 elections and return to office. Mitsotakis then resigned as ND leader, although he remained the party&#x27;s honorary chairman.

In January 2004 Mitsotakis announced that he would retire from Parliament at the 7 March election, 58 years after his first election.

==Death==
Mitsotakis died on 29 May 2017 in Athens, aged 98 of natural causes.
Four days of national mourning were declared. His state funeral was held on 31 May 2017 and he was buried in Chania.

<text>The Mull of Kintyre is the southwesternmost tip of the Kintyre Peninsula (formerly &quot;Cantyre&quot;) in southwest Scotland. From here, the Antrim coast of Northern Ireland is visible on a calm and clear day, and a historic lighthouse, the second commissioned in Scotland, guides shipping in the intervening North Channel. The area has been immortalised in popular culture by the 1977 hit song &quot;Mull of Kintyre&quot; by Kintyre resident Paul McCartney&#x27;s band of the time, Wings.

==Etymology==
The name is an anglicisation of the Gaelic (), &#x27;Rounded [or bare] Headland&#x27;, where and are respectively the genitive forms of &#x27;head, headland&#x27; and &#x27;land, country&#x27;, so &#x27;Headland Country&#x27; or more simply &#x27;Head Land&#x27;. The anglicised variant &quot;Cantyre&quot; derives directly from non-genitive .

Mull as a geographical term is most commonly found in southwest Scotland, where it is often applied to headlands or promontories, and, often more specifically, for the tip of that promontory or peninsula.

The term &quot;mull&quot; derives from &#x27;bald, bare; baldness, bareness&#x27;. The geographical reference is to a land formation bare of trees, such as a rounded hill, summit, mountain, promontory, or headland.

==Geography==
The Mull is at the extreme south western tip of the Kintyre peninsula, approximately from Campbeltown in Argyll and Bute, Western Scotland. It is about beyond the southernmost village of the peninsula, Southend with its tea room and beaches, and reached via a single-track road.

Ailsa Craig and the County Antrim coast of Ulster and Rathlin Island are all clearly visible from the Mull. On clearer days it is also possible to make out Malin Head in Inishowen in County Donegal in the north of Ulster, and the Ayrshire coast on the other side of Ailsa Craig. Other islands in the Firth of Clyde are also visible when looking east, especially from further back along the single track road from Southend village. The Straits of Moyle (part of the North Channel) allow sea passage from the Irish Sea to the Atlantic Ocean. Notoriously strong currents plague the tip of the Kintyre Peninsula creating a hazard to unmotorised craft and virtually impossible for distance swimmers. At its closest point, mainland Ulster is from the Mull. Owing to the low elevation of Rathlin Island and the high elevation of the Mull of Kintyre it is also possible to see over the top of Rathlin Island to the Antrim coastal town of Ballycastle. Individual houses on the Antrim coast and cars travelling along the coast road can sometimes be seen without the aid of binoculars, visibility conditions depending.


==History==
The Mull has been an important landbridge throughout history. It is thought that it was used by early humans in their travels from continental Europe to Ireland via Scotland. In more recent times it was used again by the Scotti when they travelled from Ireland to establish the kingdom of Dál Riata in modern-day Argyll.

===Air crashes===
The steep cliffs and hills rising out of the sea on all sides, along with the frequent sea mists, have made the area a hazard to flight. It has been the site of numerous air crashes throughout aviation history, and the remains of some of those crashed aircraft still litter the area.

A notable air disaster on the Mull was the RAF Chinook helicopter crash on 2 June 1994.

===Nautical disaster===
On 13 June 1858 the SS &quot;New York&quot;, a steamship converted to sail, was wrecked at the south end of the Mull of Kintyre.

==Mull of Kintyre test==

The Mull of Kintyre test or Mull of Kintyre rule is, according to an urban legend, an unofficial guideline that was used by the British Board of Film Classification (BBFC) in the United Kingdom to decide whether an image of a penis could be shown. According to the myth, the BBFC would not permit the general release of a film or video if it depicted a phallus erect to the point that the angle it made from the vertical was higher than that of the Kintyre peninsula, Argyll and Bute, on maps of Scotland. The BBFC has denied that any such &#x27;test&#x27; existed, and maintain it is merely a humorous rumour.

<text>Earl of Clancarty is a title that has been created twice in the Peerage of Ireland.

== History ==
The title was created for the first time in 1658 in favour of Donough MacCarty, 2nd Viscount Muskerry, of the MacCarthy of Muskerry dynasty. He had earlier represented County Cork in the Irish House of Commons. Lord Clancarty had already been created a baronet in the Baronetage of Nova Scotia in , before he succeeded his father in the viscountcy. The title of Viscount Muskerry had been created in the Peerage of Ireland in 1628 for his father Charles MacCarthy. The first Earl Donough MacCarty was succeeded by his grandson Charles, the second Earl; he was the son of Charles MacCarty, Viscount Muskerry, who was killed during the Second Anglo-Dutch War. Charles, Lord Clancarty died as an infant and was succeeded by his uncle Callaghan MacCarty, the third Earl. On his death the titles passed to his son Donough MacCarty, the fourth Earl. He supported King James II and was attainted in 1691, with his titles forfeited. His son and heir apparent Robert MacCarty, Viscount Muskerry, served as Governor of Newfoundland but was excepted from the Indemnity Act 1747, which pardoned Jacobites.

The title was created for a second time in 1803 in favour of William Trench, 1st Viscount Dunlo. He had previously represented County Galway in the Irish Parliament and had already been created Baron Kilconnel, of Garbally in the County of Galway, in 1797, and Viscount Dunlo, of Dunlo and Ballinasloe in the Counties of Galway and Roscommon, in 1801. These titles were in the Peerage of Ireland. Trench was a descendant of a daughter of the first Viscount Muskerry, hence his choice of title when elevated to an earldom in 1803. Lord Clancarty had nineteen children and was succeeded by his eldest son, the second Earl. He was a prominent politician and diplomat. Lord Clancarty notably served as President of the Board of Trade and as Ambassador to The Netherlands and sat in the House of Lords as an Irish representative peer from 1808 to 1837. In 1815 he was created Baron Trench, of Garbally in the County of Galway, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom, and in 1823 he was further honoured when he was made Viscount Clancarty, of the County of Cork, also in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. On 8 July 1815 he was entered into the Netherlands Nobility by King William I of the Netherlands and granted by Royal Decree the title Marquess of Heusden (Dutch: &quot;Markies van Heusden&quot;).

Lord Clancarty&#x27;s great-grandson, the fifth Earl, is notable for marrying an English music-hall singer Belle Bilton (1867–1906) in July 1889 against the opposition of his father who sold off much of the estate in retaliation. The fifth Earl&#x27;s eldest son, the sixth Earl, died without surviving male issue and was succeeded by his younger brother, the seventh Earl (the fourth son of the first marriage of the fifth Earl). He died childless and was succeeded by his half-brother, the eighth Earl. He was a ufologist. the titles are held by his nephew, who succeeded in 1995. He is the only son of the Hon. Power Edward Ford Le Poer Trench, second son of the fifth Earl from his second marriage. The Earl of Clancarty sat in the House of Lords as &quot;Viscount Clancarty&quot; until the passing of the House of Lords Act 1999 and was re-elected as a Cross-Bench Peer on 23 June 2010.

Several other members of the Trench family have gained distinction. Eyre Trench, brother of the first Earl, was a Lieutenant-General in the Army. The Most Reverend the Hon. Power Trench, third son of the first Earl, was Archbishop of Tuam. The Hon. William Le Poer Trench, fourth son of the first Earl, was a Rear-Admiral in the Royal Navy. The Venerable the Hon. Charles Le Poer Trench, fifth son of the first Earl, was Archdeacon of Ardagh. His son Henry Luke Trench was a Major-General in the Bengal Staff Corps. The Hon. Sir Robert Le Poer Trench, ninth son of the first Earl, was a Colonel in the Army and a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath. The Hon. William Le Poer Trench, third son of the third Earl, was a Colonel in the Royal Engineers and briefly represented County Galway in the House of Commons.

The Trench family claims French Huguenot descent, although a Scottish origin is possible. The Barons Ashtown are members of another branch of the family. William Trench, 1st Earl of Clancarty, was the great-grandson of Frederick Trench, whose brother the Very Reverend John Trench was the great-grandfather of Frederick Trench, 1st Baron Ashtown.

Trench Town in Jamaica gets its name from its previous designation as Trench Pen, 400 acres of land once used for livestock by Daniel Power Trench, an Irish immigrant of the 18th century (descendants of the Earls of Clancarty).

The family seat was Garbally Court, near Ballinasloe, County Galway.

<text>Madigan&#x27;s Millions (Italian: Un dollaro per 7 vigliacchi, Spanish: El Millón de Madigan) is a 1968 Italian-Spanish comedy crime film directed by Stanley Prager and produced by Sidney W. Pink.

The movie was shot in 1966, but was not released for two years. It stars Dustin Hoffman in his first movie role, as Jason Fister, a young U.S. Treasury Dept. official sent to Rome to recover a large sum of money owed to the United States government by a deceased mobster.

The film is in the lowbrow comedy genre, with comic stop-action chase scenes, as well as many scenes involving spaghetti Western-style gunplay on the streets of Rome. Hoffman&#x27;s Fister is a naive and mild-mannered bureaucrat with a sense for sniffing out phonies.

The interiors of the film were shot largely in Spain, with exteriors in Rome.

<text>Pinus strobus, commonly called the eastern white pine, northern white pine, white pine, Weymouth pine (British), and soft pine is a large pine native to eastern North America. It occurs from Newfoundland, Canada, west through the Great Lakes region to southeastern Manitoba and Minnesota, United States, and south along the Appalachian Mountains and upper Piedmont to northernmost Georgia and very rare in some of the higher elevations in northeastern Alabama. It is considered rare in Indiana.

The Haudenosaunee maintain the tree as the central symbol of their multinational confederation, calling it the &quot;Tree of Peace&quot;, where the Seneca use the name o’sóä’ and the Kanienʼkehá:ka call it onerahtase&#x27;ko:wa. Within the Wabanaki Confederacy, the Mi&#x27;kmaq use the term guow to name the tree, both the Wolastoqewiyik and Peskotomuhkatiyik call it kuw or kuwes, and the Abenaki use the term kowa.

It is known as the &quot;Weymouth pine&quot; in the United Kingdom, after Captain George Weymouth of the British Royal Navy, who brought its seeds to England from Maine in 1605.

== Distribution ==

&quot;P. strobus&quot; is found in the nearctic temperate broadleaf and mixed forests biome of eastern North America. It prefers well-drained or sandy soils and humid climates, but can also grow in boggy areas and rocky highlands. In mixed forests, this dominant tree towers over many others, including some of the large broadleaf hardwoods. It provides food and shelter for numerous forest birds, such as the red crossbill, and small mammals such as squirrels.

Fossilized white pine leaves and pollen have been discovered by Brian Axsmith, a paleobotanist at the University of South Alabama, in the Gulf Coastal Plain, where the tree no longer occurs.

Eastern white pine forests originally covered much of north-central and northeastern North America. Only 1% of the old-growth forests remain after the extensive logging operations from the 18th century to early 20th century.

Old-growth forests, or virgin stands, are protected in Great Smoky Mountains National Park. Other protected areas with known virgin forests, as confirmed by the Eastern Native Tree Society, include Algonquin Provincial Park, Quetico Provincial Park, Algoma Highlands in Ontario, and Sainte-Marguerite River Old Forest in Quebec, Canada; Estivant Pines, Huron Mountains, Porcupine Mountains State Park, and Sylvania Wilderness Area in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, United States; Hartwick Pines State Park in the Lower Peninsula of Michigan; Menominee Indian Reservation in Wisconsin; Lost 40 Scientific and Natural Area (SNA) and Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness in Minnesota; White Pines State Park, Illinois; Cook Forest State Park, Hearts Content Scenic Area, and Anders Run Natural Area in Pennsylvania; and the Linville Gorge Wilderness in North Carolina, United States.

Small groves or individual specimens of old-growth eastern white pines are found across the range of the species in the USA, including in Ordway Grove, Maine; Ice Glen, Massachusetts; and Adirondack Park, New York. Many sites with conspicuously large specimens represent advanced old-field ecological succession. The tall stands in Mohawk Trail State Forest and William Cullen Bryant Homestead in Massachusetts are examples.

As an introduced species, &quot;P. strobus&quot; is now naturalizing in the Outer Western Carpathians subdivision of the Carpathian Mountains in Czech Republic and southern Poland. It has spread from specimens planted as ornamental trees.

== Description ==
Like most members of the white pine group, &quot;Pinus&quot; subgenus &quot;Strobus&quot;, the leaves (&quot;needles&quot;) are coniferous, occurring in fascicles (bundles) of five, or rarely three or four, with a deciduous sheath. The leaves are flexible, bluish-green, finely serrated, and long.

The seed cones are slender, long (rarely longer than that) and broad when open, and have scales with a rounded apex and slightly reflexed tip, often resinous. The seeds are long, with a slender wing, and are dispersed by wind. Cone production peaks every 3 to 5 years.

The branches are spaced about every 18 inches on the trunk with five or six branches appearing like spokes on a wagon wheel. Eastern white pine is self-fertile, but seeds produced this way tend to result in weak, stunted, and malformed seedlings. Mature trees are often 200–250 years old, and some live over 400 years. A tree growing near Syracuse, New York, was dated to 458 years old in the late 1980s and trees in Michigan and Wisconsin were dated to roughly 500 years old.

=== Dimensions ===
The eastern white pine has been described as the tallest tree in eastern North America, perhaps sharing the prize with the deciduous tulip tree whose range overlaps with eastern white pine in a few areas. In natural precolonial stands, the pine is reported to have grown as tall as . No means exist for accurately documenting the height of trees from these times, but eastern white pine may have reached this height on rare occasions. Even greater heights have been reported in popular, but unverifiable, accounts such as Robert Pike&#x27;s &quot;Tall Trees, Tough Men&quot;.

Total trunk volumes of the largest specimens are around , with some past giants possibly reaching . Photographic analysis of giants suggests volumes closer to .

==== Height ====
&quot;P. strobus&quot; grows about annually between the ages of 15 and 45 years, with slower height increments before and after that age range. The tallest presently living specimens are tall, as determined by the Native Tree Society (NTS). Prior to their exploitation, it was common for white pines in northern Wisconsin to reach heights of over . Three locations in the Southeastern United States and one site in the Northeastern United States have trees that are tall.Common height of 80 feet or more.

The southern Appalachian Mountains have the most locations and the tallest trees in the present range of &quot;P. strobus&quot;. One survivor is a specimen known as the &quot;Boogerman Pine&quot; in the Cataloochee Valley of Great Smoky Mountains National Park. At tall, it is the tallest accurately measured tree in North America east of the Rocky Mountains, though this conflicts with citations for Liriodendron tulipifera. It has been climbed and measured by tape drop by the NTS. Before Hurricane Opal broke its top in October 1995, Boogerman Pine was tall, as determined by Will Blozan and Robert Leverett using ground-based measurements.

The tallest specimens in Hartwick Pines State Park in Michigan are tall.

In the northeastern USA, eight sites in four states currently have trees over tall, as confirmed by the NTS. The Cook Forest State Park of Pennsylvania has the most numerous collection of eastern white pines in the Northeast, with 110 trees measuring that height or more. The park&#x27;s &quot;Longfellow Pine&quot; is the tallest presently living eastern white pine in the Northeast, at tall, as determined by tape drop. The Mohawk Trail State Forest of Massachusetts has 83 trees measuring or more tall, of which six exceed . The &quot;Jake Swamp Tree&quot; located there is tall. The NTS maintains precise measurements of it. A private property in Claremont, New Hampshire, has approximately 60 specimens that are at least , with the tallest being .

==== Diameter ====
Diameters of the larger pines range from , which translates to a circumference (girth) range of . However, single-trunked white pines in both the Northeast and Southeast with diameters over are exceedingly rare. Notable big pine sites of or less often have no more than two or three trees in the 1.2- to 1.4-m-diameter class. Common diameter of 2-3 feet.

Unconfirmed reports from the colonial era gave diameters of virgin white pines of up to .

== Mortality and disease ==
Because the eastern white pine tree is somewhat resistant to fire, mature survivors are able to reseed burned areas. In pure stands, mature trees usually have no branches on the lower half of their trunks. The white pine weevil (&quot;Pissodes strobi&quot;) and white pine blister rust (&quot;Cronartium ribicola&quot;), an introduced fungus, can damage or kill these trees.

=== Blister rust ===
Mortality from white pine blister rust in mature pine groves was often 50–80% during the early 20th century. The fungus must spend part of its lifecycle on alternate hosts of the genus &quot;Ribes&quot;, the native gooseberry or wild currant. Foresters proposed that if all the alternate host plants were removed, white pine blister rust might be eliminated. A very determined campaign was mounted, and all land owners in commercial pine-growing regions were encouraged to uproot and kill all native gooseberry and wild currant plants. The ramifications for wildlife and habitat ecology were of less concern at the time than timber-industry protection.

Today, native wild currants are relatively rare plants in New England, and planting wild currants or wild gooseberries is strongly discouraged, or even illegal in some jurisdictions. As an alternative, new strains of commercial currants have been developed that are highly resistant to white pine blister rust. Mortality in white pines from rust is only about 3% today.

==Conservation status in the United States==
Old white pines are treasured in the United States. An American National Natural Landmark, Cook Forest State Park in Pennsylvania, contains the tallest known tree in the Northeastern United States, a white pine named Longfellow Pine. Some white pines in Wisconsin are over 200 years old. Although widely planted as a landscape tree in the Midwestern states, native White pine is listed as &quot;rare or uncommon&quot; in Indiana.

== Historical uses ==

=== Lumber ===
In the 19th century, the harvesting of Midwestern white pine forests played a major role in America&#x27;s westward expansion through the Great Plains. A quarter-million white pines were harvested and sent to lumber yards in Chicago in a single year.

The white pine had aesthetic appeal to contemporary naturalists such as Henry David Thoreau (&quot;There is no finer tree.&quot;) Beyond that, it had commercial applications. It was considered &quot;the most sought and most widely utilized of the various forest growths of the northwest.&quot; Descriptions of its uses are quoted below from a 19th-century source:

The species was imported in 1620 to England by Captain George Weymouth, who planted it for a timber crop, but had little success because of white pine blister rust disease.

Old-growth pine in the Americas, of various &quot;Pinus&quot; species, was a highly desired wood since huge, knot-free boards were the rule rather than the exception. Pine was common and easy to cut, thus many colonial homes used pine for paneling, floors, and furniture. Pine was also a favorite tree of loggers, since pine logs can still be processed in a lumber mill a year or more after being cut down. In contrast, most hardwood trees such as cherry, maple, oak, and ash must be cut into 1&quot; thick boards immediately after felling, or else large cracks will develop in the trunk which can render the wood worthless.

Although eastern white pine was frequently used for flooring in buildings constructed before the U.S. Civil War, the wood is soft and tends to cup over time with wear. George Washington opted for the much harder southern yellow pine at Mount Vernon, instead.

=== Mast pines ===
During the 17th and 18th centuries, tall white pines in the Thirteen Colonies became known as &quot;mast pines&quot;. Marked by agents of the Crown with the broad arrow, a mast pine was reserved for the British Royal Navy. Special barge-like vessels were built to ship tall white pines to England. The wood was often squared to better fit in the holds of these ships. A mast was about at the butt and at the top, while a mast was by on its ends.

By 1719, Portsmouth, New Hampshire, had become the hub of pine logging and shipping. Portsmouth shipped 199 masts to England that year. In all, about 4500 masts were sent to England.

The eastern white pine played a significant role in the events leading to the American Revolution. Marking of large white pines by the Crown had become controversial in the colonies by the first third of the 18th century. In 1734, the King&#x27;s men were assaulted and beaten in Exeter, New Hampshire, in what was to be called the Mast Tree Riot. Colonel David Dunbar had been in the town investigating a stock pile of white pine in a pond and the ownership of the local timber mill before caning two townspeople. In 1772, the sheriff of Hillsborough County, New Hampshire, was sent to the town of Weare to arrest mill owners for the illegal possession of large white pines. That night, as the sheriff slept at the Pine Tree Tavern, he was attacked and nearly killed by an angry mob of colonists. This act of rebellion, later to become known as the Pine Tree Riot, may have fueled the Boston Tea Party in 1773.

After the Revolutionary War, the fledgling United States used large white pines to build out its own navy. The masts of the USS &quot;Constitution&quot; were originally made of eastern white pine. The original masts were single trees, but were later replaced by laminated spars to better withstand cannonballs.

In colonial times, an unusually large, lone, white pine was found in coastal South Carolina along the Black River, far east of its southernmost normal range. The king&#x27;s mark was carved into it, giving rise to the town of Kingstree.

Eastern white pine is now widely grown in plantation forestry within its native area.

== Contemporary uses ==

=== Lumber ===
=== Timber framing ===
Eastern white pine has often been used for timber frames, and is available in large sizes. Eastern white pine timbers are not particularly strong, so timbers increase in size to handle loads applied. This species accepts stains better than most, but it has little rot resistance, so should be used only in dry conditions.

=== Characteristics ===
Freshly cut eastern white pine is yellowish white or a pale straw color, but pine wood which has aged many years tends to darken to a deep, rich, golden tan. Occasionally, one can find light brown pine boards with unusual yellowish-golden or reddish-brown hues. This is the famous &quot;pumpkin pine&quot;. Slow growing pines in old-growth forests are thought to accumulate colored products in the heartwood, but genetic factors and soil conditions may also play a role in rich color development.

This wood is also favored by patternmakers for its easy working.

=== Ecology ===
Cottontail, snowshoe rabbits, porcupines, can eat the bark. Red squirrels can eat the cones by extracting the seeds. Seeds are eaten by crossbills, pine siskin, and white tailed deer.

=== Foods and medicines ===
Eastern white pine needles exceed the amount of vitamin C of lemons and oranges and make an excellent herbal tea. The cambium is edible. It is also a source of resveratrol. Linnaeus noted in the 18th century that cattle and pigs fed pine bark bread grew well, but he personally did not like the taste.

Pine tar is produced by slowly burning pine roots, branches, or small trunks in a partially smothered flame. Pine tar mixed with beer can be used to remove tapeworms (flat worms) or nematodes (round worms). Pine tar mixed with sulfur is useful to treat dandruff, and marketed in present-day products. Pine tar can also be processed to make turpentine.

; Native American traditional uses
The name &quot;Adirondack&quot;, an Iroquois word that means tree-eater, referred to their neighbors (more commonly known as the Algonquians) who collected the inner bark of &quot;P. strobus&quot;, &quot;Picea rubens&quot;, and others during times of winter starvation. The white, soft inner bark (cambial layer) was carefully separated from the hard, dark brown bark and dried. When pounded, this product can be used as flour or added to stretch other starchy products.

The young staminate cones were stewed by the Ojibwe Indians with meat, and were said to be sweet and not pitchy. In addition, the seeds are sweet and nutritious, but not as tasty as those of some of the western nut pines.

Pine resin (sap) has been used by various tribes to waterproof baskets, pails, and boats. The Ojibwe also used pine resin to successfully treat infections and even gangrenous wounds, because pine resin apparently has a number of quite efficient antimicrobials. Generally, a wet pulp from the inner bark, or pine tar mixed with beeswax or butter was applied to wounds and used as a salve to prevent infection.

=== Cultivation ===
&quot;P. strobus&quot; is cultivated by plant nurseries as an ornamental tree, for planting in gardens and parks. The species is low-maintenance and rapid-growing as a specimen tree. With regular shearing, it can also be trained as a hedge. Some cultivars are used in bonsai.
==== Cultivars ====
Cultivars have been selected for small to dwarf mature forms, and foliage color characteristics. They include:
*&quot;P. strobus&quot; Nana group – tall by wide MBG: &quot;Pinus strobus&quot; (Nana Group)
**&quot;P. strobus&quot; &#x27;Macopin&#x27; – tall &amp; wide. MBG:&quot;Pinus strobus&quot; &#x27;Macopin&#x27;
**&quot;P. strobus&quot; &#x27;Paul Waxman&#x27; – tall &amp; wide. MBG: &quot;Pinus strobus&quot; &#x27;Paul Waxman&#x27;

==== Christmas trees ====
Smaller specimens are popular as live Christmas trees. Eastern white pines are noted for holding their needles well, even long after being harvested. They also are well suited for people with allergies, as they give little to no aroma. A standard tree takes around 6 to 8 years to grow in ideal conditions. Sheared varieties are usually desired because of their stereotypical Christmas tree conical shape, as naturally grown ones can be sparse, or grow bushy in texture. The branches of the eastern white pine are also widely used in making holiday wreaths and garlands because of their soft, feathery needles.

=== Water filtration ===
White pine xylem has been used as a filter to clean certain bacteria from contaminated water. Hemacytometer tests revealed that at least 99.9% of bacteria tested were rejected after being passed through white pine xylem.

== Symbolism ==
The indigenous Haudenosaunee (Iroquois Confederation) named it the &quot;Tree of Peace&quot;. Since 2017, it has appeared on the flag and seal of the city of Montreal to represent the indigenous peoples of the area.

The eastern white pine is the provincial tree of Ontario, Canada.

In the United States, it is the state tree of Maine (as of 1945) and Michigan (as of 1955). Its &quot;pine cone and tassel&quot; is also the state flower of Maine, and is prominently featured on the state&#x27;s license plates. Sprigs of eastern white pine were worn as badges as a symbol of Vermont identity during the Vermont Republic and are depicted in a stained-glass window in the Vermont State House, on the Flag of Vermont, and on the naval ensign of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and the state of Maine. The 1901 Maine Flag prominently featured the tree during its brief tenure as Maine&#x27;s state flag. The Maine State Guard also use the tree in their uniform badges.

<text>The &quot;Majestic&quot; class of nine pre-dreadnought battleships were built for the Royal Navy in the mid-1890s under the Spencer Programme, named after the First Lord of the Admiralty, John Poyntz Spencer. With nine units commissioned, they were the most numerous class of battleships. The nine ships, , , , , , , , , and , were built between 1894 and 1898 as part of a programme to strengthen the Royal Navy versus its two traditional rivals, France and Russia. This continued the naval re-armament initiatives begun by the Naval Defence Act 1889.

The &quot;Majestic&quot;s introduced a number of significant improvements to British battleship design, including armoured gun shields for the barbette-mounted main battery guns. The ships were armed with a main battery of four BL 12-inch Mark VIII guns, the first large-calibre weapon in the Royal Navy to use smokeless propellant, which made it superior in almost all respects to earlier, larger guns. They were also the first British ships to incorporate Harvey armour, which allowed them to carry a much more comprehensive level of protection. The ships proved to be among the most successful designs of their day, and they were widely copied in foreign navies, including the Japanese and the battleship , which were both modified versions of the &quot;Majestic&quot; design.

The nine ships served in a variety of roles throughout their careers. They primarily served in the Channel Fleet, though several took rotations in the Mediterranean Fleet, and &quot;Victorious&quot; served on the China Station in 1900–02. No longer frontline ships by the outbreak of the First World War in July 1914, the vessels were used to protect the crossing of the British Expeditionary Force and various points on the British coast. In 1915, several of the ships were disarmed, their guns going to equip the s. The disarmed battleships were used as troop ships during the Dardanelles Campaign, and &quot;Prince George&quot; and &quot;Majestic&quot; were used to bombard enemy positions before &quot;Majestic&quot; was torpedoed by a German U-boat. The surviving ships were employed in secondary roles from 1915 onwards, and after the war, all were sold for scrapping in 1920–22. Only one, &quot;Prince George&quot;, avoided the breakers&#x27; yards by wrecking off Camperduin.

== Design ==

In 1891, Rear Admiral Jackie Fisher, then the Controller of the Royal Navy, issued a request for a new battleship design based on the , but that incorporated a recently designed gun and Harvey armour, which was significantly stronger than compound armour. The Director of Naval Construction, William Henry White, prepared a preliminary design for a ship armed with four of the 12 in guns and protected with an armour belt that was thick. White submitted the design on 27 January 1892 to the Board. Due to the greater resilience that Harvey armour provided, less of it could be used for the same level of protection, allowing for significant weight reduction. As a result, the protection scheme was made stronger and more comprehensive than in the &quot;Royal Sovereign&quot;s, while minimising increased displacement. This included the fitting of fully enclosed armoured gun shields for the main battery guns.

The Board approved the design and intended to lay down three ships under the 1892 programme, but work on the 12 in gun was taking longer than predicted, and so construction was delayed to the 1893 programme. By that time, the third ship of what was to be the &quot;Majestic&quot; class was redesigned as a second-class battleship, , leaving only two ships to be laid down under the 1893 estimates. By August 1893, however, the public perceived the strength of the Royal Navy to have fallen relative to its traditional rivals, the French and Russian navies. John Spencer, the First Lord of the Admiralty, proposed a large naval expansion plan referred to as the Spencer Programme that included seven more &quot;Majestic&quot;-class battleships to soothe public opinion.

The &quot;Majestic&quot;s were to be a benchmark for all successor pre-dreadnoughts. While the preceding &quot;Royal Sovereign&quot;-class battleships had revolutionised and stabilised British battleship design by introducing the high-freeboard battleship with four main-battery guns in twin mountings in barbettes fore and aft, it was the &quot;Majestic&quot;s that settled on the 12 in main battery and began the practice of mounting armoured gunhouses over the barbettes; these gunhouses, although very different from the old-style, heavy, circular gun turrets that preceded them, would themselves become known as &quot;turrets&quot; and became the standard on warships worldwide. The &quot;Majestic&quot; class, the largest class of battleships ever built, were some of the most successful battleships of their time, and they were widely copied. Indeed, the Japanese and the battleship were based directly on the &quot;Majestic&quot;s.

===General characteristics and machinery===
The &quot;Majestic&quot;s were long between perpendiculars and long overall. They had a beam of and a draught of . They displaced up to at full combat load. The ships had a freeboard of forward, amidships, and aft. Their hulls were divided into numerous watertight compartments, with 72 compartments inside the armoured citadel and 78 outside it. A double bottom extended for much of the length of the hull. They were fitted with two pole masts, each with two fighting tops. Except for &quot;Caesar&quot;, &quot;Hannibal&quot;, and &quot;Illustrious&quot;, they had a new design in which the bridge was mounted around the base of the foremast behind the conning tower to prevent a battle-damaged bridge from collapsing around the tower.

The &quot;Majestic&quot;s were considered good seaboats, in large part due to their high freeboard, with an easy roll and good steamers, although they suffered from high fuel consumption. They were nevertheless very manoeuvrable. They had a transverse metacentric height of at full load. The ships had a crew of 672–794 officers and ratings, and this number varied between ships and over the course of their careers. Each ship carried a variety of smaller boats, usually including three steam pinnaces, one steam launch, two cutters, two whalers, three gigs of between , one skiff dinghy, and one raft. The ships were equipped with six searchlights, with four on the bridge and one on each mast. All nine ships received Type I wireless transmitters in 1909–10.

During the sea trials for the preceding battleship , the ship&#x27;s engineers learned that the engines might fail at high levels of forced draught; as a result, the &quot;Majestic&quot;s were designed to reach the same maximum speed with a more powerful engine. This allowed the engineers a wider margin of safety at maximum speed. Their propulsion system consisted of two 3-cylinder triple expansion engines, each driving a single four-bladed screw. Steam was provided by eight coal-fired, single-ended Scotch marine boilers, which were trunked into a pair of funnels placed side by side. Their engines were rated at at normal draught, and they provided a top speed of . At forced draught, they could reach and . By 1908, the ships had been re-boilered with mixed coal- and oil-fired models. The ships carried of coal normally, and additional spaces allowed for up to to be stored. With the installation of the new boilers, oil storage amounting to was added. At a speed of , the ships could steam for . At , their cruising radius fell to .

===Armament===

&quot;Majestic&quot; and her sisters were armed with four BL 12-inch Mk VIII 35-calibre guns in twin-gun turrets, one forward and one aft. This calibre would become the standard for all British battleship classes built for the next fifteen years. They were the first new British battleships to mount a 12-inch main battery since the 1880s. The new gun was a significant improvement on the 13.5-inch (343 mm) gun which had been fitted on the Admiral and &quot;Royal Sovereign&quot; classes that preceded the &quot;Majestic&quot;s, in terms of ballistics and strength of the gun itself, and it was significantly lighter. The 12 in gun had a muzzle velocity of —a significant increase over the 13.5 in gun owing to the use of smokeless propellant—and it could fire a shell with a range of .

The turrets were placed on pear-shaped barbettes; the first six ships had this arrangement, but the last two, &quot;Caesar&quot; and &quot;Illustrious&quot;, had circular barbettes. The BII mountings in the first six ships allowed all-around loading from the supply of ready ammunition kept in the turret, but the guns had to return to the centerline to bring ammunition up from the magazines, as the ammunition hoists did not rotate with the turret. &quot;Caesar&quot; and &quot;Illustrious&quot;, with their circular barbettes, had BIII mountings with rotating hoists, and these allowed all-around loading from the magazines. Both the BII and BIII mounts had a range of elevation from −5 degrees to 13.5 degrees, with the loading angle at maximum elevation. During the First World War, four of the &quot;Majestic&quot;s were disarmed, and these guns were used to arm eight s. A further two turrets from &quot;Illustrious&quot; were later emplaced as coastal guns on the Tyne.

The saving in weight from the main battery allowed the &quot;Majestic&quot; class to carry a secondary battery of twelve QF (quick-firing) 6-inch 40-calibre guns, a larger secondary armament than in previous classes. These were mounted in casemates in two gun decks amidships, and they fired a shell at a muzzle velocity of . Elevated at 15 degrees, they could hit targets out to . The ships also carried sixteen QF 12-pounder Mk I guns and twelve QF 2-pounder Mk I guns for defence against torpedo boats. These were placed in a variety of mounts, including in casemates, on the main battery turret roofs, and in the fighting tops. The ships were also equipped with five 18 in (450 mm) torpedo tubes, four of which were submerged in the ship&#x27;s hull, with the last in a deck-mounted launcher in the stern. The Woolwich Arsenal manufactured the torpedoes, which were the Mark IV model; these carried a warhead and had a range of at a speed of .

===Armour===
The armoured belt on the &quot;Majestic&quot; class consisted of 9 inches (229 mm) of Harvey steel, which allowed equal protection with less cost in weight compared to previous types of armour. This allowed the ships to have a deeper and lighter belt than previous battleships without any loss in protection. The belt armour extended for along the hull; it covered above the waterline and below. The belt was connected, via the barbettes, by a thick transverse bulkhead forward and a 12 in thick bulkhead aft. The ship&#x27;s armoured deck was thick on the central portion, with thick sloped sides that connected to the bottom edge of the belt armour. This arrangement required any shell that penetrated the belt to also pass through the deck before it could reach the ship&#x27;s vitals. The deck was reduced to toward the bow and stern.

The barbettes for the main battery were protected with 14 in of armour on their exposed sides above the armoured deck, while the portion that was masked below the deck was reduced to . The gunhouses for the main battery had thick faces, thick sides, rears, and thick roofs. The secondary guns&#x27; casemates were 6 in thick, with 2 in thick sides and rears to protect the gun crews from splinters. A mantlet that was 6 in thick covered the stern torpedo tube. The forward conning tower had 14 in of steel on the sides, except for the rear-facing side, which was reduced to 12 in. The aft conning tower had much thinner armour protection, with 3 in on all sides.

== Service history ==

&quot;Majestic&quot;, &quot;Magnificent&quot;, &quot;Jupiter&quot;, &quot;Mars&quot;, &quot;Prince George&quot;, and &quot;Hannibal&quot; served in the Channel Fleet from their commissioning, with &quot;Magnificent&quot; as the flagship from 1895. They were present at the Diamond Jubilee for Queen Victoria in June 1897 and took part in the Coronation Review for King Edward VII in August 1902, along with &quot;Hannibal&quot;. &quot;Caesar&quot; and &quot;Illustrious&quot; instead went to the Mediterranean Fleet, remaining there until 1903 and 1904, respectively, when they returned to Britain to join their sisters in the Channel Fleet. &quot;Victorious&quot; served briefly in the Mediterranean Fleet in 1897 before being transferred to the China Station in 1898, remaining there until 1900. The ship then returned for another stint in the Mediterranean Fleet from 1900 to 1903, and in 1904 she joined her sisters in the Channel Fleet. In 1906, &quot;Majestic&quot; was paid off; the following year she and &quot;Magnificent&quot; were recommissioned into the Nore Division. At the same time, &quot;Caesar&quot;, &quot;Victorious&quot;, and &quot;Mars&quot; went to the Devonport Division, while &quot;Hannibal&quot;, &quot;Prince George&quot;, &quot;Jupiter&quot;, and &quot;Illustrious&quot; went to the Portsmouth Division.

In March 1912, &quot;Caesar&quot; was reduced to reserve in the 4th Squadron, Home Fleet. Later that year, &quot;Majestic&quot;, &quot;Prince George&quot;, and &quot;Illustrious&quot; were assigned to the 7th Battle Squadron (BS). Following Britain&#x27;s entry into the First World War in August 1914, &quot;Caesar&quot; and &quot;Jupiter&quot; were assigned to the 7th BS, which was in turn assigned to the Channel Fleet and tasked with protecting the British Expeditionary Force as it crossed the English Channel to France. At the same time, &quot;Hannibal&quot;, &quot;Mars&quot;, &quot;Magnificent&quot;, and &quot;Victorious&quot; were assigned to the 9th Battle Squadron and stationed in the Humber to protect the British coast. &quot;Illustrious&quot; was instead used as a guard ship for the Grand Fleet, and was initially based at Loch Ewe.
In early 1915, &quot;Majestic&quot; and &quot;Prince George&quot; took part in the Dardanelles Campaign against the Ottoman Empire; they bombarded Ottoman positions around the Dardanelles until May, when &quot;Majestic&quot; was torpedoed and sunk by the German U-boat off Cape Helles. At around the same time, &quot;Prince George&quot; was hit by a shell from an Ottoman coastal battery, requiring repairs at Malta. &quot;Hannibal&quot;, &quot;Magnificent&quot;, &quot;Victorious&quot;, and &quot;Mars&quot; were laid up in early 1915 and had their 12 in guns removed to arm the &quot;Lord Clive&quot;-class monitors. &quot;Illustrious&quot; was similarly disarmed, with two of her guns going to the Tyne Turrets. &quot;Hannibal&quot;, &quot;Magnificent&quot;, and &quot;Mars&quot; were then used as troop ships during the operations off the Dardanelles. In late 1915 after the conclusion of the Dardanelles Campaign, &quot;Hannibal&quot; was stationed in Egypt as a depot ship, while &quot;Magnificent&quot; and &quot;Mars&quot; returned to Britain to be used as an ammunition ship and a depot ship, respectively.

&quot;Victorious&quot; was converted into a repair ship in 1915–1916 and based in Scapa Flow, the main base of the Grand Fleet. &quot;Jupiter&quot; was transferred to the Suez Canal Patrol in mid-1915, before returning to Devonport in late 1916 to be paid off. By 1916, &quot;Illustrious&quot; had been converted into a storeship and based in Chatham; she was joined there by &quot;Prince George&quot;, by then converted into a barracks ship. From December 1914 to September 1918, &quot;Caesar&quot; was employed as a guard ship, first at Gibraltar and then in the North America and West Indies Station. She served in the Adriatic Squadron in September 1918, and then in the Aegean Squadron in October. After the war, she supported the Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War in the Black Sea as a depot ship; she was the last British pre-dreadnought to serve overseas in any capacity.

&quot;Hannibal&quot; and &quot;Jupiter&quot; were sold in January 1920 and thereafter broken up in Italy and Britain, respectively. &quot;Illustrious&quot; followed her sisters to the breakers in June 1920, being scrapped at Barrow-in-Furness. &quot;Caesar&quot; was paid off in April 1920 and eventually sold for scrapping in Germany in July 1922. &quot;Magnificent&quot; and &quot;Mars&quot; were sold for scrap in May 1921 and broken up at Inverkeithing and Briton Ferry, respectively. &quot;Prince George&quot; was sold for scrapping in Germany in September, but while en route she ran aground off Camperduin. &quot;Victorious&quot; was renamed &quot;Indus II&quot; in 1920 and eventually sold for scrap in December 1922.

<text>The 49th (West Riding) Infantry Division was an infantry division of the British Army. The division fought in the First World War in the trenches of the Western Front, in the fields of France and Flanders. During the Second World War, the division fought in the Norwegian Campaign and in North-western Europe. After the Second World War, it was disbanded in 1946, then reformed in 1947. It remained with Northern Command until finally disbanded in 1967.

==Formation==
The Territorial Force (TF) was formed on 1 April 1908 following the enactment of the Territorial and Reserve Forces Act 1907 (7 Edw.7, c.9) which combined and re-organised the old Volunteer Force, the Honourable Artillery Company and the Yeomanry. Originally designated the West Riding Division, the division was composed of the 1st, 2nd and 3rd West Riding Brigades, each with four infantry battalions, along with supporting units. The division was one of fourteen divisions that made up part of the peacetime TF. In peacetime, the divisional headquarters was, from 1912, at Tower Street in York.

==First World War==
Elements of the division had, by the outbreak of the First World War in August 1914, just departed for their annual summer camp and were mobilised for war service on 5 August, the day after Britain entered the war. According to the Territorial and Reserve Forces Act 1907, men of the TF were not obligated to serve overseas without their permission and so, on 31 August, the division was ordered to form a second-line reserve unit, the 2nd West Riding Division, formed mainly from those men who, for various reasons, choose not to volunteer for overseas service. The division, under the command of Major General Thomas Baldock, who had been in command since 1911, moved to the South Yorkshire/Lincolnshire area for concentration and spent the next few months engaged in training.

By late March 1915, training had progressed to the point where the division was warned for a potential move overseas. By mid-April, the division was in France, and was to remain on the Western Front as part of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) for the rest of the war. Soon after arrival the division, although unfamiliar with trench warfare, was assigned to Lieutenant General Sir Henry Rawlinson&#x27;s IV Corps of the BEF, and played a relatively minor role in the Battle of Aubers Ridge, where Major General Baldock, the divisional commander, was wounded in action. The division was redesignated the 49th (West Riding) Division on 15 May 1915 and given the White Rose of York as its insignia. The division&#x27;s three brigades were also redesignated, the 1st, 2nd and 3rd West Riding Brigades becoming the 146th (1st West Riding), 147th (2nd West Riding) and 148th (3rd West Riding) Brigades, respectively. After Aubers Ridge, the division, now commanded by Major General Edward Perceval, was not engaged in any major battles until 19 December 1915, when the division, now part of Lieutenant General John Keir&#x27;s VI Corps, participated in the first Phosgene attack but suffered comparatively few losses.

The first few months of 1916 were not spent in any major actions and the division held a relatively quiet sector of the Western Front. As part of Lieutenant General Thomas Morland&#x27;s X Corps, the division fought in the Battle of the Somme, fighting in the Battle of Albert, followed by the Battle of Bazentin Ridge. Transferring to Lieutenant General Charles Fergusson&#x27;s II Corps, the division then took part in the Battle of Pozières. Rested throughout August, the division then fought in the Battle of Flers–Courcelette and the Battle of Thiepval Ridge.

Again moved to a quieter sector of the front, the division spent, as it had in 1916, the first few months of 1917 uneventfully in the Ypres Salient, not being employed in any major offensives until the division was to take part in Operation Hush. However, the division was not employed in the operation and instead fought in the final stages of the Passchendaele offensive, in the Battle of Poelcappelle.

In early 1918, the division, now commanded by Major General Neville Cameron, was again holding a quiet sector of the Western Front. Throughout January and February, due to a severe shortage of manpower in the BEF, many of the division&#x27;s infantry battalions were either disbanded, merged with other understrength units or posted elsewhere. The manpower shortage compelled the reduction of each of the division&#x27;s three infantry brigades from four to three battalions. In the latter half of 1918, the division, mostly unaffected by the German Army&#x27;s Spring Offensives, fought in all the major battles of the Lys offensive, and in the Hundred Days Offensive, which saw the war turn in favour of the Allied powers, come to an end on 11 November 1918.

==Between the wars==
The division was disbanded after the war but was reformed, now as the 49th (West Riding) Infantry Division, when the old TF was itself reconstituted as the Territorial Army (TA) in 1920, with the same composition as pre-1914. The division was stationed in Northern Command. During the interwar period, particularly in the late 1930s, many of the division&#x27;s units were converted into other roles, mostly into artillery, searchlight or armoured regiments so that, by the time war broke out in September 1939, the division&#x27;s composition, which included units from the disbanded 46th (North Midland) Division, was much changed from what it was in 1914. Of note, Bernard Montgomery, who was later to have association with the 49th Division, served with this division in 1923, when he was a General Staff Officer Grade 2 (GSO2). Upon the doubling of the size of the TA in mid-1939 the division, as it had in the First World War, raised a second-line duplicate formation, the 46th Infantry Division, when another European conflict, most likely with Nazi Germany, was becoming increasingly inevitable.

==Second World War==
===Mobilisation and early months===
Shortly after the outbreak of the Second World War on 3 September 1939, the division, under Major General Pierse Mackesy, was mobilised for full-time war service and, with conscription having been introduced in the United Kingdom some months earlier, and with many units understrength after having to post officers and men to the second-line units, the division absorbed many conscripts. Although war was declared, the division, serving under Northern Command, still with the 146th, 147th and 148th Infantry Brigades under command, was initially engaged in static defensive duties, guarding vital points and little time was allotted for training. However, training began soon afterwards with the overall intention being that the division, once fully trained, would join the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) in France. In the event, this was not to happen as, in February 1940, the division received orders to form part of &quot;Avonforce&quot; and be sent to Finland, via Norway, and aid the Finnish Army during its Winter War with the Soviet Union. On 12 March, however, the Finnish, severely outnumbered by the Russians, surrendered, thus cancelling the order.

On 4 April, the 49th Division ceased to function and the 146th and 148th Brigades (with the 147th Brigade remaining in England), both very poorly trained and equipped, took part in the short and ill-fated Norwegian Campaign, that were intended to retake the ports of Trondheim and Narvik from the German Army. The 146th Brigade came under command of &quot;Mauriceforce&quot;, with the 148th under &quot;Sickleforce&quot;. The poorly planned campaign was a complete disaster and the two brigades, fighting as two different brigade groups, and widely scattered from each other, withdrew from Norway in May 1940. One consolation, however, was that they gained the distinction of being amongst the very first British troops to fight the enemy in the Second World War, and certainly the first Territorials to do so. The brigades returned to the United Kingdom, where, on 10 June, the division was reconstituted in Scottish Command under Major General Henry Curtis. Curtis, the new General Officer Commanding (GOC), had commanded the division&#x27;s sister formation, the 46th Division, during the Battle of France and in the BEF&#x27;s subsequent retreat to Dunkirk, where it was evacuated to England, albeit with very heavy casualties. The 148th Brigade, which had suffered well over 1,400 casualties in Norway, did not rejoin the division, later becoming an independent formation.

===Service in Iceland, 1940−42===
The division, now with only the 146th and 147th Infantry Brigades left, departed for Iceland, the 146th arriving there on 8 May, the 147th on 17 May, and the divisional HQ arriving on 23 June, when it was redesignated HQ Alabaster Force and, in January 1941, Iceland Force before finally being redesignated HQ British Troops Iceland. Both brigades were thereafter stationed in Iceland until 1942. As a result, a new divisional insignia, featuring a polar bear standing on an ice floe, was adopted. Also stationed there from late October 1940 was the 70th Independent Infantry Brigade. In 1941, at the request of British Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, the division was trained in mountain warfare and also in arctic warfare. By April 1942, responsibility for Iceland had been handed over to the United States, with the arrival in July the previous year of the 1st Provisional Marine Brigade and the three brigades began to be relieved, and Major General Curtis suggested the Marines wear the polar bear insignia. A junior officer of the 1st Tyneside Scottish wrote of the experience in Iceland: &quot;Iceland had given us so much. More than anything it had forged a firm and abiding link between all who wore the Polar Bear&quot;.

===Reconstitution and training for Overlord===
On 26 April 1942, the division HQ was again reconstituted, this time in South Wales, serving under Western Command, commanded by Major General Curtis. The division initially had only the 147th Brigade under command, although the 70th Brigade became part of the division on 18 May, followed on 26 August by the 146th Brigade, and numerous other supporting units which later joined the division. The division then spent the next few months engaged in training throughout Wales and England, with the intention of catching up with the latest training methods. In March 1943, the division, abandoning the mountain and arctic warfare roles, participated in Exercise Spartan, the largest military exercise held in England. In April 1943, the division was assigned to I Corps, under Lieutenant General Gerard Bucknall, and was earmarked as an assault division for the invasion of Normandy, scheduled for spring the following year. On 30 April the division received a new GOC, Major General Evelyn &quot;Bubbles&quot; Barker. A highly competent officer and a decorated veteran of the First World War, Major General Barker ordered the divisional sign to be changed from its current emblem of a polar bear with its head lowered, which the GOC believed to be a sign of a lack of martial intent, into a more &quot;aggressive&quot; sign. &quot;That Bear is too submissive. I want a defiant sign for my division, lift up its head and make it roar&quot;, Barker wrote. Subsequently the 49th Division was issued with a new &quot;aggressive&quot; insignia, now featuring a Polar Bear with its head facing upwards, roaring.

In July, as the division was selected to be one of the three divisions to spearhead the Normandy invasion, then scheduled for the following year, the 49th was sent to Scotland, where it began strenuous training in amphibious warfare and combined operations, which continued throughout 1943 and into 1944. However, in early 1944, when General Sir Bernard Montgomery took over command of the 21st Army Group, which commanded all Allied land forces in the upcoming invasion, Major General Douglas Graham&#x27;s 50th (Northumbrian) Infantry Division, which had fought with distinction in North Africa and Sicily, was chosen by Montgomery as one of the two British assault divisions – the other being Major General Tom Rennie&#x27;s 3rd Division – and the 49th Division, despite training for the role for many months, was instead relegated to a backup role, causing great disappointment to all ranks. In January 1944, the division moved to East Anglia, where, on 2 February, it was transferred from Lieutenant General John Crocker&#x27;s I Corps, with which it had served since April 1943, to XXX Corps, under Lieutenant General Gerard Bucknall, and continued training for the invasion.

===Northwestern Europe, 1944−45===
On 13 June 1944, most of the 49th Division, after just over two years of training, landed in Normandy as part of Operation Overlord. The division arrived too late to take part in the Battle of Villers-Bocage, where the veteran 7th Armoured Division suffered a serious setback, but was involved in the numerous attempts to capture the city of Caen. The division, after landing, was only involved in relatively small-scale skirmishes, most notably on 16 June around Tilly-sur-Seulles, where the 6th Battalion, Duke of Wellington&#x27;s Regiment, of the 147th Brigade, suffered some 230 casualties − 30% of its war establishment strength − in a two-day battle whilst attempting to capture Le Parc de Boislonde. The position was eventually taken by the 7th Battalion, Dukes, under Lieutenant Colonel John Wileey. The 49th&#x27;s first major action as a division came during Operation Martlet, the first phase of Operation Epsom, the British attempt to capture Caen. Although Lieutenant General Sir Richard O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s VIII Corps made the main effort, XXX Corps, with the 49th Division under control, was to protect VIII Corps&#x27; right flank by seizing the Rauray ridge.

The operation commenced on 25 June, and the division, supported by elements of the 8th Armoured Brigade and a massive artillery barrage from over 250 guns, initially went well, with the first phase objective, the town of Fontenay, being captured by the end of the first day against units of two German panzer divisions (the 2nd and 9th). However, capturing Rauray itself proved more difficult although, after hard fighting, much of it in close quarters, it eventually fell to the 70th Brigade on 27 June which, for the next few days, had to ensure a series of very fierce counterattacks, with the 1st Battalion, Tyneside Scottish and 11th Battalion, Durham Light Infantry bearing the brunt of the German attacks, which were repulsed with heavy losses on both sides, although the Germans suffering by far the greater. It was during this period of the fierce fighting in Normandy that the Nazi propaganda broadcaster, Lord Haw-Haw, referred to the division as &quot;the Polar Bear Butchers&quot;, alleging that British soldiers wearing a Polar Bear flash had massacred SS tank crew who were trying to surrendering. Some units had been issued with the order &quot;NPT below rank major&quot;, meaning that they were not to take prisoners below that rank. The 49th&#x27;s GOC, Major General &quot;Bubbles&quot; Barker, explained it in his diary on 2 July, &quot;Yesterday the old 49 Div made a great name for itself and we are all feeling very pleased with ourselves. After being attacked on my left half, all day by infantry and tanks, we were in our original positions after a small scale counter attack by the evening. We gave him a real bloody nose and we calculate having knocked out some 35 tanks mostly Panthers. One of my Scots Battns distinguished themselves particularly. We gave him a proper knockout with our artillery with very strong concentration on any point where movement was expected&quot;.

The division, by now known widely as, &quot;Barker&#x27;s Bears&quot;, then held the line for the next few weeks, absorbing reinforcements and carrying out patrols until its participation in the Second Battle of the Odon, before, on 25 July, transferring from Bucknall&#x27;s XXX Corps, in which the division had served nearly six months, to Lieutenant General John Crocker&#x27;s I Corps. The corps was now part of the First Canadian Army and the 49th Division, on the corps&#x27; left flank, in August, took part in the advance towards the Falaise Pocket, where the Germans were attempting to retreat to, capturing thousands of Germans in the process. It was during this time that the division lost the 70th Brigade, which as a junior, 2nd line territorial formation, was broken up to provide reinforcements to other units. However, substituting the 70th Brigade was the 56th Brigade, formerly an independent formation comprising entirely Regular Army units, that had landed in Normandy on D-Day.

The division reached the River Seine in the late August, and, upon crossing the river, turned towards the capture of Le Havre, which was captured on 12 September (see Operation Astonia) with very light casualties to the 49th Division and its supporting units − 19 killed and 282 wounded − and capturing over 6,000 Germans in the process. Major General &quot;Bubbles&quot; Barker, the GOC, wrote in his diary that it &quot;will be a memorable day for the Div[ision] and myself&quot;. However, the division then had all its transport sent forward to other units then advancing into Belgium, temporarily grounding the &quot;Polar Bears&quot;, although giving the division a few days rest, deservedly so after having endured almost three months of action since landing in Normandy and suffered over 5,000 casualties.

The division received the order to move, arriving, after travelling some 200 miles, in the south of the Netherlands at a concentration area on 21 September, ten miles south of the Antwerp-Turnhout Canal. Over the next few days, the division liberated Turnhout and crossed the Antwerp-Turnhout Canal. It was during this period that the division was awarded its first and only Victoria Cross (VC) of the Second World War, belonging to Corporal John Harper of the Hallamshire Battalion, York and Lancaster Regiment. The division, after being on the offensive since landing in Normandy, then spent the next few weeks on the defensive along the Dutch frontier, before returning to the offensive. Operation Pheasant commenced in the third week of October, with the objective, after Tilburg and Breda had fallen to the 49th, being the capture of the town of Roosendaal, which fell after ten days of vicious fighting. Major General Barker described the town as &quot;not much of a place, bombed by USAF early in the year... We have crossed 20 miles in 10 days and had to fight every inch of it&quot;. Further fighting continued until the division ended up at Willemstad at the Hollandsche Diep. The division then transferred from Lieutenant General Crocker&#x27;s I Corps to Lieutenant General Neil Ritchie&#x27;s XII Corps and helped in the clearing of the west bank of the River Maas, along the Dutch border, fighting in very wet and muddy conditions.

In late November, the division suffered a blow when its GOC, Major General &quot;Bubbles&quot; Barker, who had continuously commanded the 49th since April 1943, succeeded Lieutenant General O&#x27;Connor as the GOC of VIII Corps and left the division. Barker&#x27;s handling of the 49th &quot;Polar Bears&quot; Division, most notably during Operation Epsom in Normandy, had clearly impressed his superiors. He later wrote that &quot;My fortune was to command the Polar Bears whose achievements were made possible by its great efficiency at all levels, its high morale and the marvellous team work... It was a splendid fighting machine&quot;. Barker&#x27;s successor was Major General Gordon &quot;Babe&quot; MacMillan, formerly the GOC of the 15th (Scottish) Infantry Division. Like his predecessor, MacMillan was a distinguished veteran of the First World War.

After the new GOC&#x27;s assumption of command, the next few months for the division, now serving as part of II Canadian Corps, commanded by Lieutenant General Guy Simonds, were spent mainly in small-scale skirmishing, including numerous patrols in attempts to dominate no man&#x27;s land, and garrisoning the area between the River Waal and the Lower Rhine, also known as &quot;The Island&quot;, created in the aftermath of the failed Operation Market Garden. However, in late March 1945, the division, commanded now by Major General Stuart Rawlins after MacMillan was ordered to become GOC of the 51st (Highland) Division, received orders to clear &quot;The Island&quot;, which, after much hard fighting but relatively light casualties, was cleared in early April, before advancing north-eastwards towards Arnhem. The 49th Division&#x27;s last major contribution to the Second World War was the liberation of Arnhem and the fierce battles that led to it. The division, now part of I Canadian Corps, under Lieutenant General Charles Foulkes, and supported by Canadian tanks of the 5th Canadian Armoured Division, liberated the city at a cost of less than 200 casualties, but over 4,000 Germans became casualties.

Just after the German surrender on 7 May 1945, the 49th Division played a part in the liberation of Utrecht, with the 49th Reconnaissance Regiment entering first, followed by Canadian troops. There is a monument dedicated to the Polar Bears at a spot on Biltstraat in the city. During the course of the Second World War, from Normandy to Arnhem, the 49th Division had suffered 11,000 officers and men wounded or missing, with 1,642 of these being killed in action.

The division was disbanded in Germany in 1946, but reformed in the TA in 1947, having been renamed the 49th (West Riding) Armoured Division. It was based in Nottingham, consisting of (on 1 April 1947):

* 8 (Yorkshire) Armoured Brigade
* 146 (West Riding) Infantry Brigade
* 147 (Midland) Lorried Infantry Brigade
* Artillery included 269 and 270 Field Regiments Royal Artillery

In 1956, it was renamed the 49th (West Riding and Midland) Infantry Division, its base moved to Leeds, and the 8th Armoured Brigade was removed from its order of battle. Finally, it underwent its last major change in 1961, when it was renamed to the 49th (West Riding and North Midland) Division/District, and the 147th Infantry Brigade was removed from its composition. The Division/District finally disbanded in 1967, becoming simply East Midlands District.

The polar bear flash was last worn by 49th Brigade, Under Army 2020, 49 (E) Brigade was merged with 7th Armoured Brigade to become 7th Infantry Brigade on 13 February 2015.

<text>A bonfire of the vanities () is a burning of objects condemned by religious authorities as occasions of sin. The phrase itself usually refers to the bonfire of 7 February 1497, when supporters of the Dominican friar Girolamo Savonarola collected and burned thousands of objects such as cosmetics, art, and books in the public square of Florence, Italy, on the occasion of Shrove Tuesday, &quot;martedí grasso&quot;.

Francesco Guicciardini&#x27;s &quot;The History of Florence&quot; gives a firsthand account of the 1497 Florentine bonfire of the vanities. The focus of this destruction was on objects that might tempt one to sin, including vanity items such as mirrors, cosmetics, fine dresses, playing cards, and musical instruments. Other targets included books that Savonarola deemed immoral, such as works by Boccaccio, manuscripts of secular songs, and artworks, including paintings and sculptures.

== Precursors ==
Although often associated with Savonarola, such bonfires had been a common accompaniment to the outdoor sermons of San Bernardino di Siena in the first half of the 15th century.

== Savonarola ==
Savonarola was a Dominican friar who was assigned to work in Florence in 1490 at the request of Lorenzo de&#x27; Medici. Within a few years, Savonarola became one of the foremost enemies of the House of Medici and helped bring about their downfall in 1494. Savonarola campaigned against what he considered to be the artistic and social excesses of Renaissance Italy, preaching with great vigor against any luxury. His power and influence grew so much that with time, he became the effective ruler of Florence and had soldiers for his protection following him around.

In 1497 and 1498, during the time in which the festival known as Carnival occurred, Savonarola began to host a regular &quot;bonfire of the vanities&quot;. He collected and burned objects that he considered objectionable, including nude paintings, wigs and makeup, love poetry, games and dice, and music and musical instruments. Anyone who tried to object found their hands being forced by teams of Savonarola supporters. These supporters called themselves &quot;Piagnoni&quot; (&quot;Weepers&quot;) after a public nickname that was initially intended as an insult.

Savonarola&#x27;s influence did not go unnoticed by the higher church officials, and his actions came to the attention of Pope Alexander VI. He was excommunicated on 13 May 1497. He was charged with heresy and sedition at the command of Pope Alexander VI. Savonarola was executed by hanging on 23 May 1498, and his body was burnt. His death occurred in the Piazza della Signoria, where he had previously held his bonfires of the vanities. Then the papal authorities gave word that anyone in possession of the friar&#x27;s writings had four days to turn them over to a papal agent for destruction. Anyone who did not comply also faced excommunication.

=== Botticelli ===
Although some later sources reported that the Florentine artist Sandro Botticelli burned several of his paintings based on classical mythology in the great Florentine bonfire of 1497, the primary source on his life, Vasari&#x27;s biography, does not mention this, and no early record does either. Vasari asserts that Botticelli produced nothing after coming under the influence of Savonarola but that is not accepted by modern art historians, and several of his paintings are assigned dates after Savonarola&#x27;s death in 1498. The art historian Rab Hatfield says that one of Botticelli&#x27;s paintings, &quot;The Mystical Nativity&quot;, cryptically dated 1500, is based on the sermon Savonarola delivered on Christmas Eve, 1493. Writing several centuries later in 1851, Orestes Brownson, an apologist for Savonarola, vaguely mentions artworks by Fra Bartolomeo, Lorenzo di Credi, and &quot;many other painters&quot;, along with &quot;several antique statues&quot; being burnt in the bonfire.

==In popular culture==
The event has been represented or mentioned in varying degrees of detail in several works of historical fiction, including George Eliot&#x27;s &quot;Romola&quot; (1863), E. R. Eddison&#x27;s &quot;A Fish Dinner in Memison&quot; (1941), Irving Stone&#x27;s &quot;The Agony and the Ecstasy&quot; (1961), Chelsea Quinn Yarbro&#x27;s &quot;The Palace&quot; (1978), Michael Ondaatje&#x27;s &quot;The English Patient&quot; (1992), Roger Zelazny and Robert Sheckley&#x27;s &quot;If at Faust You Don&#x27;t Succeed&quot; (1993), Timothy Findley&#x27;s &quot;Pilgrim&quot; (1999), Ian Caldwell and Dustin Thomason&#x27;s &quot;Rule of Four&quot; (2004), Jeanne Kalogridis&#x27;s &quot;I, Mona Lisa&quot; (2006), Traci L. Slatton&#x27;s &quot;The Botticelli Affair&quot; (2013), and Jodi Taylor&#x27;s &quot;No Time Like the Past&quot; (2015), and in television dramas including the Showtime series &quot;The Borgias&quot;, &quot;The Sky&quot; (Italy) and the Netflix (North America) series &quot;Borgia&quot;, and the third season (2019) of the Netflix (North America) series &quot;Medici&quot; in the final episode titled &quot;The Fate of the City&quot;. Other references in popular culture include:

* As a metaphor, Tom Wolfe used the event and ritual as the title for his 1987 novel &quot;The Bonfire of the Vanities&quot; and its film adaptation.
* Vampires Marius and Armand visit the scene of Savonarola&#x27;s execution after his body has been cleared away in Anne Rice&#x27;s &quot;The Vampire Armand&quot; (1998)
* The Bonfire is depicted in the video game &quot;Assassin&#x27;s Creed II,&quot; in which Savonarola is one of the antagonists.
* Jordan Tannahill&#x27;s 2016 play &quot;Botticelli in the Fire&quot; is a fictional retelling of the events leading up to the bonfire of the vanities.

<doc id="464331" wikidata="Q287239" url="?curid=464331" title="Y-intercept">
<text>In analytic geometry, using the common convention that the horizontal axis represents a variable formula_1 and the vertical axis represents a variable formula_2, a formula_2-intercept or vertical intercept is a point where the graph of a function or relation intersects the formula_2-axis of the coordinate system. As such, these points satisfy formula_5.

==Using equations==
If the curve in question is given as formula_6 the formula_2-coordinate of the formula_2-intercept is found by calculating formula_9. Functions which are undefined at formula_5 have no formula_2-intercept.

If the function is linear and is expressed in slope-intercept form as formula_12, the constant term formula_13 is the formula_2-coordinate of the formula_2-intercept.

==Multiple formula_2-intercepts==
Some 2-dimensional mathematical relationships such as circles, ellipses, and hyperbolas can have more than one formula_2-intercept. Because functions associate formula_1-values to no more than one formula_2-value as part of their definition, they can have at most one formula_2-intercept.

==formula_1-intercepts==

Analogously, an formula_1-intercept is a point where the graph of a function or relation intersects with the formula_1-axis. As such, these points satisfy formula_24. The zeros, or roots, of such a function or relation are the formula_1-coordinates of these formula_1-intercepts.

Functions of the form formula_27 have at most one formula_2-intercept, but may contain multiple formula_1-intercepts. The formula_1-intercepts of functions, if any exist, are often more difficult to locate than the formula_2-intercept, as finding the formula_2-intercept involves simply evaluating the function at formula_33.

==In higher dimensions==
The notion may be extended for 3-dimensional space and higher dimensions, as well as for other coordinate axes, possibly with other names. For example, one may speak of the formula_34-intercept of the current–voltage characteristic of, say, a diode. (In electrical engineering, formula_34 is the symbol used for electric current.)

<text>Retinoblastoma (Rb) is a rare form of cancer that rapidly develops from the immature cells of a retina, the light-detecting tissue of the eye. It is the most common primary malignant intraocular cancer in children, and 80% of retinoblastoma cases are first detected in those under 3 years old.

Though most children in high income countries survive this cancer, they may lose their vision in the affected eye(s) or need to have the eye removed.

Almost half of children with retinoblastoma have a hereditary genetic defect associated with it. In other cases, retinoblastoma is caused by a congenital mutation in the chromosome 13 gene 13q14 (retinoblastoma protein).

Retinoblastoma is the most intrusive intraocular cancer among children. The chance of survival and preservation of the eye depends fully on the severity. Retinoblastoma is extremely rare as there are only about 200 to 300 cases every year in the United States. Globally, only 1 in about 15,000 children have this malignancy, though rates continue to increase.

Intraocular malignancies are relatively more frequently treated than extraocular malignancies, likely due to a relatively earlier detection and subsequent treatment. Pediatricians may screen infants with annual vision tests, in which anomalies can be detected. During a red reflex test, light from an ophthalmoscope goes through transparent parts of the eye and reflects off the ocular fundus. If retinoblastoma is present, it may partially or fully impede light transversing this path. This may result in an abnormal red reflex or leucocoria, which can be a common indicator of retinoblastoma (when light is reflected by the tumor, the regular view of the red retina is blocked). The retinoblastoma may be visible as a whitish, translucent mass. If the tumor has not spread and is contained within the eye, chances of successful treatment are favorable. If initial signs are ignored or diagnosis is significantly delayed, outcomes and prognosis worsen. The effects of retinoblastoma may spread outside the eye, sometimes resulting in proptosis. Retinoblastoma that has spread may be significantly more difficult to treat.

The most common and obvious sign of retinoblastoma is an abnormal appearance of the retina as viewed through the pupil, the medical term for which is leukocoria, also known as amaurotic cat&#x27;s eye reflex. Other signs and symptoms include deterioration of vision, a red and irritated eye with glaucoma, and faltering growth or delayed development. Some children with retinoblastoma can develop a squint, commonly referred to as &quot;cross-eyed&quot; or &quot;wall-eyed&quot; (strabismus). Retinoblastoma presents with advanced disease in developing countries and eye enlargement is a common finding.

Depending on the position of the tumors, they may be visible during a simple eye examination using an ophthalmoscope to look through the pupil. A positive diagnosis is usually made only with an examination under anesthetic (EUA). A white eye reflection is not always a positive indication of retinoblastoma and can be caused by light being reflected badly or by other conditions such as Coats&#x27; disease.

The presence of the photographic fault red eye in only one eye and not in the other may be a sign of retinoblastoma. A clearer sign is &quot;white eye&quot; or &quot;cat&#x27;s eye&quot; (leukocoria).

== Cause ==
Mutation of genes, found in chromosomes, can affect the way in which cells grow and develop within the body. Alterations in RB1 or MYCN can give rise to retinoblastoma.

=== RB1 ===
In children with the heritable genetic form of retinoblastoma, a mutation occurs in the &quot;RB1&quot; gene on chromosome 13.&quot; RB1&quot; was the first tumor suppressor gene cloned. Although&quot; RB1&quot; interacts with over 100 cell proteins, its negative regulator effect on the cell cycle principally arises from binding and inactivation of the transcription factor &quot;E2F&quot;, thus repressing the transcription of genes which are required for the S phase.

The defective &quot;RB1 &quot;gene can be inherited from either parent; in some children, however, the mutation occurs in the early stages of fetal development. The expression of the&quot; RB1 &quot;allele is autosomal dominant with 90% penetrance.

Inherited forms of retinoblastomas are more likely to be bilateral. In addition, inherited uni- or bilateral retinoblastomas may be associated with pineoblastoma and other malignant midline supratentorial primitive neuroectodermal tumors (PNETs) with a dismal outcome; retinoblastoma concurrent with a PNET is known as trilateral retinoblastoma. A 2014 meta-analysis showed that 5-year survival of trilateral retinoblastoma increased from 6% before 1995 to 57% by 2014, attributed to early detection and improved chemotherapy.

The development of retinoblastoma can be explained by the two-hit model. According to the two-hit model, both alleles need to be affected, so two events are necessary for the retinal cell or cells to develop into tumors. The first mutational event can be inherited (germline or constitutional), which will then be present in all cells in the body. The second “hit” results in the loss of the remaining normal allele (gene) and occurs within a particular retinal cell. In the sporadic, nonheritable form of retinoblastoma, both mutational events occur within a single retinal cell after fertilization (somatic events); sporadic retinoblastoma tends to be unilateral.

Several methods have been developed to detect the &quot;RB1&quot; gene mutations. Attempts to correlate gene mutations to the stage at presentation have not shown convincing evidence of a correlation.

=== MYCN ===

Not all retinoblastoma cases are with RB1 inactivation. There are cases reported with only one RB1 mutation or even two functional RB1 alleles, which indicates other oncogenic lesions of retinoblastoma. Somatic amplification of the &quot;MYCN&quot; oncogene is responsible for some cases of nonhereditary, early-onset, aggressive, unilateral retinoblastoma. MYCN can act as a transcription factor and promotes proliferation by regulating the expression of cell cycle genes. Although &quot;MYCN&quot; amplification accounted for only 1.4% of retinoblastoma cases, researchers identified it in 18% of infants diagnosed at less than 6 months of age. Median age at diagnosis for &quot;MYCN&quot; retinoblastoma was 4.5 months, compared with 24 months for those who had nonfamilial unilateral disease with two &quot;RB1 &quot;gene mutations.

==Diagnosis==

Screening for retinoblastoma should be part of a &quot;well baby&quot; screening for newborns during the first 3 months of life, to include:
* The red reflex: checking for a normal reddish-orange reflection from the eye&#x27;s retina with an ophthalmoscope or retinoscope from about 30 cm or 1 foot, usually done in a dimly lit or dark room
* The corneal light reflex or Hirschberg test: checking for symmetrical reflection of beam of light in the same spot on each eye when a light is shined into each cornea, to help determine whether the eyes are crossed
* Eye examination: checking for any structural abnormalities

===Classification===
The two forms of the disease are a heritable form and nonheritable form (all cancers are considered genetic in that mutations of the genome are required for their development, but this does not imply that they are heritable, or transmitted to offspring). Approximately 40% of patients have a heritable form of retinoblastoma, carrying a mutation in the &quot;RB1&quot; gene. If no history of the disease exists within the family, the disease is labeled &quot;sporadic&quot;, but this does not necessarily indicate that it is the nonheritable form. Bilateral retinoblastomas are commonly heritable, while unilateral retinoblastomas are commonly nonheritable.

In about two-thirds of cases, only one eye is affected (unilateral retinoblastoma); in the other third, tumors develop in both eyes (bilateral retinoblastoma). The number and size of tumors on each eye may vary. In certain cases, the pineal gland or the suprasellar or parasellar region (or in very rare cases other midline intracranial locations) is also affected (trilateral retinoblastoma). The position, size, and quantity of tumors are considered when choosing the type of treatment for the disease.

===Differential diagnosis===
:1. Persistent fetal vasculature is a congenital developmental anomaly of the eye resulting from failure of the embryological, primary vitreous, and hyaloid vasculature to regress, whereby the eye is shorter, develops a cataract, and may present with whitening of the pupil.
:2. Coats disease is a typically unilateral disease characterised by abnormal development of blood vessels behind the retina, leading to blood vessel abnormalities in the retina and retinal detachment to mimic retinoblastoma.
:3. Toxocariasis is a parasitic disease of the eye associated with exposure to infected puppies, which causes a retinal lesion leading to retinal detachment.
:4. Retinopathy of prematurity is associated with low-birth-weight infants who receive supplemental oxygen in the period immediately after birth, and it involves damage to the retinal tissue and may lead to retinal detachment.
:5. Congenital Cataract
:6. Norrie Disease

If the eye examination is abnormal, further testing may include imaging studies, such as computerized tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and ultrasound. CT and MRI can help define the structure abnormalities and reveal any calcium depositions. Ultrasound can help define the height and thickness of the tumor. Bone marrow examination or lumbar puncture may also be done to determine any metastases to bones or the brain.

===Morphology===
Gross and microscopic appearances of retinoblastoma are identical in both hereditary and sporadic types. Macroscopically, viable tumor cells are found near blood vessels, while zones of necrosis are found in relatively avascular areas. Microscopically, both undifferentiated and differentiated elements may be present. Undifferentiated elements appear as collections of small, round cells with hyperchromatic nuclei; differentiated elements include Flexner-Wintersteiner rosettes, Homer Wright rosettes, and fleurettes from photoreceptor differentiation.

=== Genetic testing ===
Identifying the &quot;RB1&quot; gene mutation that led to a child&#x27;s retinoblastoma can be important in the clinical care of the affected individual and in the care of (future) siblings and offspring. It may run in the family.
# Bilaterally affected individuals and 13-15% of unilaterally affected individuals, are expected to show an &quot;RB1&quot; mutation in blood. By identifying the &quot;RB1&quot; mutation in the affected individual, (future) siblings, children, and other relatives can be tested for the mutation; if they do not carry the mutation, child relatives are not at risk of retinoblastoma, so need not undergo the trauma and expense of examinations under anaesthetic. For the 85% of unilaterally affected patients found not to carry either of their eye tumor&quot; RB1&quot; mutations in blood, neither molecular testing nor clinical surveillance of siblings is required.
# If the &quot;RB1&quot; mutation of an affected individual is identified, amniotic cells in an at-risk pregnancy can be tested for the family mutation; any fetus that carries the mutation can be delivered early, allowing early treatment of any eye tumors, leading to better visual outcomes.
# For cases of unilateral retinoblastoma where no eye tumor is available for testing, if no &quot;RB1&quot; mutation is detected in blood after high-sensitivity molecular testing (i.e. &gt;93%&quot; RB1&quot; mutation detection sensitivity), the risk of a germline &quot;RB1&quot; mutation is reduced to less than 1%, a level at which only clinic examination (and not examinations under anaesthetic) is recommended for the affected individual and their future offspring (National Retinoblastoma Strategy, Canadian Guidelines for Care).

=== Imaging ===
Traditional ultrasound B scan can detect calcifications in the tumour while high-frequency ultrasound B scan is able to provide higher resolution than the traditional ultrasound and determine the proximity of the tumour with front portion of the eye. MRI scan can detect high-risk features such as optic nerve invasion; choroidal invasion, scleral invasion, and intracranial invasion. CT scan is generally avoided because radiation can stimulate the formation of more eye tumours in those with RB1 genetic mutation.

== Staging ==
In order to properly diagnose retinoblastoma, there must be guidelines to follow to properly classify the risk of the tumor. The &quot;Reese Ellsworth Classification System,&quot; by Dr. Algernon Reese and Dr. Robert Ellsworth, is universally used to determine the size, location, and multi-focality of the tumor. The system was originally used to decide the best treatment result by using external beam radiotherapy, as well as, the likeliness of salvaging the globe of the eye. Due to chemotherapy not being part of the &quot;Reese Ellsworth Classification System,&quot; there needed to be an updated classification system to foresee the treatment outcomes of chemotherapy. The International Classification for Intraocular Retinoblastoma is now the current system being used, and it was created by Murphree and associates. According to Reese and Ellsworth, there were different groups that had various features in order to classify the globe salvage as very favorable to the category of very unfavorable. In order to salvage the affected eye, the disc diameter had to be around 4DD and behind the equator to have higher favorability. If the tumor was around ten in disc diameter and involved roughly 50% of the retina, it was considered unfavorable to salvage the globe which could result in enucleation. According to Murphree, the different groups were classified from very low risk to very high risk which was determined by features of the given tumor. Very low risk means that the tumor has to be less than 3mm and there must be no seeding of the vitreous or sub-retinal area. When a patient is very high risk, the tumor presents itself with multiple features and is going to have to be treated with conservative treatment modalities or enucleation.

International Classification for Intraocular Retinoblastoma

==Treatment==
The priority of retinoblastoma treatment is to preserve the life of the child, then to preserve vision, and then to minimize complications or side effects of treatment. The exact course of treatment depends on the individual case and is decided by the ophthalmologist in discussion with the paediatric oncologist. Correct treatment also depends on the mutation type, whether it is a germline RB1 mutation, a sporadic RB1 mutation or MYCN amplification with functional RB1. Children with involvement of both eyes at diagnosis usually require multimodality therapy (chemotherapy, local therapies).

The various treatment modalities for retinoblastoma includes:
* Enucleation of the eye – Most patients with unilateral disease present with advanced intraocular disease, so usually undergo enucleation, which results in a cure rate of 95%. In bilateral Rb, enucleation is usually reserved for eyes that have failed all known effective therapies or without useful vision.
* External beam radiotherapy (EBRT) – The most common indication for EBRT is for the eye in a young child with bilateral retinoblastoma who has active or recurrent disease after completion of chemotherapy and local therapies. However, patients with hereditary disease who received EBRT therapy are reported to have a 35% risk of second cancers.
* Brachytherapy involves the placement of a radioactive implant (plaque), usually on the sclera adjacent to the base of a tumor. It used as the primary treatment, or more frequently, in patients with small tumors or in those who had failed initial therapy including previous EBRT therapy.
* Thermotherapy involves the application of heat directly to the tumor, usually in the form of infrared radiation. It is also used for small tumors.
* Laser photocoagulation is recommended only for small posterior tumors. An argon or diode laser or a xenon arc is used to coagulate all the blood supply to the tumor.
* Cryotherapy induces damage to the vascular endothelium with secondary thrombosis and infarction of the tumor tissue by rapidly freezing it. It may be used as primary therapy for small peripheral tumors or for small recurrent tumors previously treated with other methods.
* Systemic chemotherapy has become forefront of treatment in the past decade, in the search for globe-preserving measures and to avoid the adverse effects of EBRT therapy. The common indications for chemotherapy for intraocular retinoblastoma include tumors that are large and that cannot be treated with local therapies alone in children with bilateral tumors. It is also used in patients with unilateral disease when the tumors are small, but cannot be controlled with local therapies alone.
* Intra-arterial chemotherapy – Chemotherapeutic drugs are administered locally by a thin catheter threaded through the groin, through the aorta, and the neck, directly into the optic vessels.
* Nanoparticulate chemotherapy – To reduce the adverse effects of systemic therapy, subconjuctival (local) injection of nanoparticle carriers containing chemotherapeutic agents (carboplatin) has been developed, which has shown promising results in the treatment of retinoblastoma in animal models without adverse effects.
* Chemoreduction is a combined approach using chemotherapy to initially reduce the size of the tumor, and adjuvant focal treatments, such as transpupillary thermotherapy, to control the tumor.

== Prognosis ==
In the developed world, retinoblastoma has one of the best cure rates of all childhood cancers (95-98%), with more than 90% of sufferers surviving into adulthood. In the UK, around 40 to 50 new cases are diagnosed each year. Good prognosis depends upon early presentation of the child in health facility. Late presentation is associated with a poor prognosis. Survivors of hereditary retinoblastoma have a higher risk of developing other cancers later in life. About 5% of cases require enucleation.

==Epidemiology==
Retinoblastoma presents with cumulative lifetime incidence rate of one case of retinoblastoma per 18000 to 30000 live births worldwide. A higher incidence is noted in developing countries, which has been attributed to lower socioeconomic status and the presence of human papilloma virus sequences in the retinoblastoma tissue.

Almost 80% of children with retinoblastoma are diagnosed before three years of age and diagnosis in children above six years of age is extremely rare. In the UK, bilateral cases usually present within 14 to 16 months, while diagnosis of unilateral cases peaks between 24 and 30 months.

<doc id="464347" wikidata="Q1024207" url="?curid=464347" title="Positive airway pressure">
<text>Positive airway pressure (PAP) is a mode of respiratory ventilation used in the treatment of sleep apnea. PAP ventilation is also commonly used for those who are critically ill in hospital with respiratory failure, in newborn infants (neonates), and for the prevention and treatment of atelectasis in patients with difficulty taking deep breaths. In these patients, PAP ventilation can prevent the need for tracheal intubation, or allow earlier extubation. Sometimes patients with neuromuscular diseases use this variety of ventilation as well. CPAP is an acronym for &quot;continuous positive airway pressure&quot;, which was developed by Dr. George Gregory and colleagues in the neonatal intensive care unit at the University of California, San Francisco. A variation of the PAP system was developed by Professor Colin Sullivan at Royal Prince Alfred Hospital in Sydney, Australia, in 1981.

The main difference between BPAP and CPAP machines is that BPAP machines have two pressure settings: the prescribed pressure for inhalation (ipap), and a lower pressure for exhalation (epap). The dual settings allow the patient to get more air in and out of their lungs.
==Medical uses==

The main indications for positive airway pressure are congestive heart failure and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. There is some evidence of benefit for those with hypoxia and community acquired pneumonia.

PAP ventilation is often used for patients who have acute type 1 or 2 respiratory failure. Usually PAP ventilation will be reserved for the subset of patients for whom oxygen delivered via a face mask is deemed insufficient or deleterious to health (see retention). Usually, patients on PAP ventilation will be closely monitored in an intensive care unit, high-dependency unit, coronary care unit or specialist respiratory unit.

The most common conditions for which PAP ventilation is used in hospital are congestive cardiac failure and acute exacerbation of obstructive airway disease, most notably exacerbations of COPD and asthma. It is not used in cases where the airway may be compromised, or consciousness is impaired. CPAP is also used to assist premature babies with breathing in the NICU setting.

The mask required to deliver CPAP must have an effective seal, and be held on very securely. The &quot;nasal pillow&quot; mask maintains its seal by being inserted slightly into the nostrils and being held in place by various straps around the head. Some full-face masks &quot;float&quot; on the face like a hover-craft, with thin, soft, flexible &quot;curtains&quot; ensuring less skin abrasion, and the possibility of coughing and yawning. Some people may find wearing a CPAP mask uncomfortable or constricting: eyeglass wearers and bearded men may prefer the nasal-pillow type of mask. Breathing out against the positive pressure resistance (the expiratory positive airway pressure component, or EPAP) may also feel unpleasant to some patients. These factors lead to inability to continue treatment due to patient intolerance in about 20% of cases where it is initiated. Some machines have pressure relief technologies that makes sleep therapy more comfortable by reducing pressure at the beginning of exhalation and returning to therapeutic pressure just before inhalation. The level of pressure relief is varied based on the patient&#x27;s expiratory flow, making breathing out against the pressure less difficult. Those who have an anxiety disorder or claustrophobia are less likely to tolerate PAP treatment. Sometimes medication will be given to assist with the anxiety caused by PAP ventilation.

Unlike PAP used at home to splint the tongue and pharynx, PAP is used in hospital to improve the ability of the lungs to exchange oxygen and carbon dioxide, and to decrease the work of breathing (the energy expended moving air into and out of the alveoli). This is because:
* During inspiration, the inspiratory positive airway pressure, or IPAP, forces air into the lungs—thus less work is required from the respiratory muscles.
* The bronchioles and alveoli are prevented from collapsing at the end of expiration. If these small airways and alveoli are allowed to collapse, significant pressures are required to re-expand them. This can be explained using the Young–Laplace equation (which also explains why the hardest part of blowing up a balloon is the first breath).
* Entire regions of the lung that would otherwise be collapsed are forced and held open. This process is called recruitment. Usually these collapsed regions of lung will have some blood flow (although reduced). Because these areas of lung are not being ventilated, the blood passing through these areas is not able to efficiently exchange oxygen and carbon dioxide. This is called ventilation–perfusion (or V/Q) mismatch. The recruitment reduces ventilation–perfusion mismatch.
*The amount of air remaining in the lungs at the end of a breath is greater (this is called the functional residual capacity). The chest and lungs are therefore more expanded. From this more expanded resting position, less work is required to inspire. This is due to the non-linear compliance–volume curve of the lung.

==Disadvantages==
A major issue with CPAP is non-adherence. Studies showed that some users either abandon the use of CPAP, and/or use CPAP for only a fraction of the nights.

Prospective PAP candidates are often reluctant to use this therapy, since the nose mask and hose to the machine look uncomfortable and clumsy. Airflow required for some patients can be vigorous. Some patients will develop nasal congestion while others may experience rhinitis or a runny nose. Some patients adjust to the treatment within a few weeks, others struggle for longer periods, and some discontinue treatment entirely. However, studies show that cognitive behavioral therapy at the beginning of therapy dramatically increases adherence—by up to 148%. While common PAP side effects are merely nuisances, serious side effects such as eustachian tube infection, or pressure build-up behind the cochlea are very uncommon. Furthermore, research has shown that PAP side effects are rarely the reason patients stop using PAP. There are reports of dizziness, sinus infections, bronchitis, dry eyes, dry mucosal tissue irritation, ear pain, and nasal congestion secondary to CPAP use.

PAP manufacturers frequently offer different models at different price ranges, and PAP masks have many different sizes and shapes, so that some users need to try several masks before finding a good fit. These different machines may not be comfortable for all users, so proper selection of PAP models may be very important in furthering adherence to therapy.

Beards, mustaches, or facial irregularities may prevent an air-tight seal. Where the mask contacts the skin must be free from dirt and excess chemicals such as skin oils. Shaving before mask-fitting may be necessary in some cases. However, facial irregularities of this nature frequently do not hinder the operation of the device or its positive airflow effects for sleep apnea patients. For many people, the only problem from an incomplete seal is a higher noise level near the face from escaping air.

The CPAP mask can act as an orthodontic headgear and move the teeth and the upper and/or lower jaw backward. This effect can increase over time and may or may not cause TMJ disorders in some patients. These facial changes have been dubbed &quot;Smashed Face Syndrome&quot;.

==Mechanism of action==

===Continuous pressure devices===
====Fixed-pressure CPAP====
A continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) machine was initially used mainly by patients for the treatment of sleep apnea at home, but now is in widespread use across intensive care units as a form of ventilation. Obstructive sleep apnea occurs when the upper airway becomes narrow as the muscles relax naturally during sleep. This reduces oxygen in the blood and causes arousal from sleep. The CPAP machine stops this phenomenon by delivering a stream of compressed air via a hose to a nasal pillow, nose mask, full-face mask, or hybrid, splinting the airway (keeping it open under air pressure) so that unobstructed breathing becomes possible, therefore reducing and/or preventing apneas and hypopneas. It is important to understand, however, that it is the air pressure, and not the movement of the air, that prevents the apneas. When the machine is turned on, but prior to the mask being placed on the head, a flow of air comes through the mask. After the mask is placed on the head, it is sealed to the face and the air stops flowing. At this point, it is only the air pressure that accomplishes the desired result. This has the additional benefit of reducing or eliminating the extremely loud snoring that sometimes accompanies sleep apnea.

The CPAP machine blows air at a prescribed pressure (also called the titrated pressure). The necessary pressure is usually determined by a sleep physician after review of a study supervised by a sleep technician during an overnight study (polysomnography) in a sleep laboratory. The titrated pressure is the pressure of air at which most (if not all) apneas and hypopneas have been prevented, and it is usually measured in centimetres of water (cm). The pressure required by most patients with sleep apnea ranges between 6 and 14 cm. A typical CPAP machine can deliver pressures between 4 and 20 cm. More specialised units can deliver pressures up to 25 or 30 cm.

CPAP treatment can be highly effective in treatment of obstructive sleep apnea. For some patients, the improvement in the quality of sleep and quality of life due to CPAP treatment will be noticed after a single night&#x27;s use. Often, the patient&#x27;s sleep partner also benefits from markedly improved sleep quality, due to the amelioration of the patient&#x27;s loud snoring.

Given that sleep apnea is a chronic health issue which commonly doesn&#x27;t go away, ongoing care is usually needed to maintain CPAP therapy. Based on the study of cognitive behavioral therapy (referenced above), ongoing chronic care management is the best way to help patients continue therapy by educating them on the health risks of sleep apnea and providing motivation and support.

====Automatic positive airway pressure====
An automatic positive airway pressure device (APAP, AutoPAP, AutoCPAP) automatically &quot;titrates&quot;, or tunes, the amount of pressure delivered to the patient to the minimum required to maintain an unobstructed airway on a breath-by-breath basis by measuring the resistance in the patient&#x27;s breathing based on levels of airway blockage such as snore and apnea, thereby giving the patient the precise pressure required at a given moment and avoiding the compromise of fixed pressure.

===Bi-level pressure devices===

VPAP or BPAP (variable/bilevel positive airway pressure) provides two levels of pressure: inspiratory positive airway pressure (IPAP) and a lower expiratory positive airway pressure (EPAP) for easier exhalation. (Some people use the term BPAP to parallel the terms APAP and CPAP.) Often BPAP is incorrectly referred to as BiPAP. However, BiPAP is the trademarked name of a BPAP machine manufactured by Respironics Corporation; it is just one of many ventilators that can deliver BPAP.
* Modes
** S (Spontaneous) – In spontaneous mode the device triggers IPAP when flow sensors detect spontaneous inspiratory effort and then cycles back to EPAP. The sensors&#x27; level of responsiveness may be adjusted if needed.
** T (Timed) – In timed mode the IPAP/EPAP cycling is purely machine-triggered, at a set rate, typically expressed in breaths per minute (BPM).
** S/T (Spontaneous/Timed) – Like spontaneous mode, the device triggers to IPAP on patient inspiratory effort. But in spontaneous/timed mode a &quot;backup&quot; rate is also set to ensure that patients still receive a minimum number of breaths per minute if they fail to breathe spontaneously.

===Expiratory positive airway pressure devices===

Nasal expiratory positive airway pressure (Nasal EPAP) is a treatment for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and snoring.

Contemporary EPAP devices have two small valves that allow air to be drawn in through each nostril, but not exhaled; the valves are held in place by adhesive tabs on the outside of the nose. The mechanism by which EPAP may work is not clear; it may be that the resistance to nasal exhalation leads to a buildup in which in turn increases respiratory drive, or that resistance to exhalation generates pressure that forces the upper airway to open wider.

==Components==
* Flow generator (PAP machine) provides the airflow
* Hose connects the flow generator (sometimes via an in-line humidifier) to the interface
* Interface (nasal or full face mask, nasal pillows, or less commonly a lip-seal mouthpiece) provides the connection to the user&#x27;s airway

==Optional features==
* Humidifier adds moisture to low humidity air
** Heated: Heated water chamber that can increase patient comfort by eliminating the dryness of the compressed air. The temperature can usually be adjusted or turned off to act as a passive humidifier if desired. In general, a heated humidifier is either integrated into the unit or has a separate power source (i.e. plug).
** Passive: Air is blown through an unheated water chamber and is dependent on ambient air temperature. It is not as effective as the heated humidifier described above, but still can increase patient comfort by eliminating the dryness of the compressed air. In general, a passive humidifier is a separate unit and does not have a power source.
* Mask liners: Cloth-based mask liners may be used to prevent excess air leakage and to reduce skin irritation and dermatitis.
* Ramp may be used to temporarily lower the pressure if the user does not immediately sleep. The pressure gradually rises to the prescribed level over a period of time that can be adjusted by the patient and/or the DME provider.
* Exhalation pressure relief: Gives a short drop in pressure during exhalation to reduce the effort required. This feature is known by the trade name C-Flex or A-Flex in some CPAPs made by Respironics and EPR in ResMed machines.
* Flexible chin straps may be used to help the patient not breathe through the mouth (full-face masks avoid this problem), thereby keeping a closed pressure system. The straps are elastic enough that the patient can easily open his mouth if he feels that he needs to. Modern straps use a quick-clip instant fit. Velcro-type adjustments allow quick sizing, before or after the machine is turned on.
* Data logging records basic compliance info or detailed event logging, allowing the sleep physician (or patient) to download and analyse data recorded by the machine to verify treatment effectiveness.
* Automatic altitude adjustment versus manual altitude adjustment.
* DC power source versus AC power source.

Such features generally increase the likelihood of PAP tolerance and compliance.

==Care and maintenance==
As with all durable medical equipment, proper maintenance is essential for proper functioning, long unit life and patient comfort. The care and maintenance required for PAP machines varies with the type and conditions of use, and are typically spelled out in a detailed instruction manual specific to the make and model.

Most manufacturers recommend that the end user perform daily and weekly maintenance. Units must be checked regularly for wear and tear and kept clean. Poorly connected, worn or frayed electrical connections may present a shock or fire hazard; worn hoses and masks may reduce the effectiveness of the unit. Most units employ some type of filtration, and the filters must be cleaned or replaced on a regular schedule. Sometimes HEPA filters may be purchased or modified for asthma or other allergy clients. Hoses and masks accumulate exfoliated skin, particulate matter, and can even develop mold. Humidification units must be kept free of mold and algae. Because units use substantial electrical power, housings must be cleaned without immersion.

For humidification units, cleaning of the water container is imperative for several reasons. First, the container may build up minerals from the local water supply which eventually may become part of the air breathed. Second, the container may eventually show signs of &quot;sludge&quot; coming from dust and other particles which make their way through the air filter which must also be changed as it accumulates dirt. To help clean the unit, some patients have used a very small amount of hydrogen peroxide mixed with the water in the container. They would then let it stand for a few minutes before emptying and rinsing. If this procedure is used, it is imperative to rinse the unit with soap and water before reinstalling onto the machine and breathing. Anti-bacterial soap is not recommended by sellers. To reduce the risk of contamination, distilled water is a good alternative to tap water. If traveling in areas where the mineral content or purity of the water is unknown or suspect, an alternative is to use a water from a &quot;purifier&quot; such as Brita. In cold climates, humidified air may require insulated and/or heated air hoses. These may be bought ready-made, or built from commonly available materials.

Automated activated oxygen (ozone) cleaners are becoming more popular as a preferred maintenance method. However, the biological effects of using ozone as a PAP cleaning method has not scientifically been proven to provide a benefit to PAP users.

==Portability==
Since continuous compliance is an important factor in the success of treatment, it is of importance that patients who travel have access to portable equipment. Progressively, PAP units are becoming lighter and more compact, and often come with carrying cases. Dual-voltage power supplies permit many units to be used internationally - these units only need a travel adapter for the different outlet.

Long-distance travel or camping presents special considerations. Most airport security inspectors have seen the portable machines, so screening rarely presents a special problem. Increasingly, machines are capable of being powered by the 400-Hz power supply used on most commercial aircraft and include manual or automatic altitude adjustment. Machines may easily fit on a ventilator tray on the bottom or back of a power wheelchair with an external battery. Some machines allow power-inverter or car-battery powering.

A limited study in Amsterdam in January 2016 using an induced sleep patient and when awake whilst on CPAP stretched the pectoralis major frontal chest muscles to bring back the shoulders and expand the chest and noted an increase in blood oxygen levels of over 6% during the manual therapy and 5% thereafter. The conclusion by Palmer was that the manual stretching of the pectoralis major combined at the time of the maximum inflation of CPAP allowed the permanent increase in blood oxygen levels and reinflation of collapsed alveoli. Further studies are required.

Some patients on PAP therapy also use supplementary oxygen. When provided in the form of bottled gas, this can present an increased risk of fire and is subject to restrictions. (Commercial airlines generally forbid passengers to bring their own oxygen.) As of November 2006, most airlines permit the use of oxygen concentrators.

==Availability==

In many countries, PAP machines are only available by prescription. A sleep study at an accredited sleep lab is usually necessary before treatment can start. This is because the pressure settings on the PAP machine must be tailored to a patient&#x27;s treatment needs. A sleep medicine doctor, who may also be trained in respiratory medicine, psychiatry, neurology, paediatrics, family practice or otolaryngology (ear, nose and throat), will interpret the results from the initial sleep study and recommend a pressure test. This may be done in one night (a split study with the diagnostic testing done in the first part of the night, and CPAP testing done in the later part of the night) or with a follow-up second sleep study during which the CPAP titration may be done over the entire night. With CPAP titration (split night or entire night), the patient wears the CPAP mask and pressure is adjusted up and down from the prescribed setting to find the optimal setting. Studies have shown that split-night protocol is an effective protocol for diagnosing OSA and titrating CPAP. CPAP
compliance rate showed no difference between the split-night and the two-night protocols.

* In the United States, PAP machines are often available at large discounts online, but a patient purchasing a PAP personally must handle the responsibility of securing reimbursement from his or her insurance or Medicare. Many of the internet providers that deal with insurance such as Medicare will provide upgraded equipment to a patient even if he or she only qualifies for a basic PAP. In some locations a government program, separate from Medicare, can be used to claim a reimbursement for all or part of the cost of the PAP device.
* In the United Kingdom, PAP machines are available on National Health Service prescription after a diagnosis of sleep apnea or privately from the internet provided a prescription is supplied.
* In Australia, PAP machines can be bought from the Internet or physical stores. There is no general requirement for a doctor&#x27;s prescription, but many suppliers will require a referral. Low-income earners who hold a Commonwealth Health Care Card should enquire with their state&#x27;s health department about programmes that provide free or low-cost PAP machines. Those who have private health insurance may be eligible for a partial rebate on the cost of a CPAP machine and the mask. Superannuation may be released for the purchase of essential medical equipment such as PAP machines, on the provision of letters from two doctors, one of whom must be a specialist, and an application to the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA).
* In Canada, CPAP units are widely available in all provinces. Funding for the therapy varies from province to province. In the province of Ontario, the Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care&#x27;s Assistive Devices Program will fund a portion of the cost of a CPAP unit based on a sleep study in an approved sleep lab showing Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome and the signature of an approved physician on the application form. This funding is available to all residents of Ontario with a valid health card.

<text>Bandar Abbas (; ) is a city in the Central District of Bandar Abbas County, Hormozgan province, Iran, serving as capital of the province, the county, and the district. Bandar Abbas is a port on the southern coast of the country, on the Persian Gulf.

The city occupies a strategic position on the narrow Strait of Hormuz (just across from Musandam Governorate, Oman), and it is the location of the main base of the Iranian Navy.

== Etymology ==
Bandar Abbas has always been a port, and as such its various names have all reflected this function. The most common name over time was Gameroon, with various spellings. In Henry Yule&#x27;s dictionary of Anglo-Indian jargon two etymologies are given; the first derived from Turkish &quot;gümrük&quot;, &quot;customhouse&quot; (from Late Greek &quot;kommerkion&quot;, from Latin &quot;commercium&quot;, &quot;commerce&quot;). The second, which Yule found much more convincing, comes from Persian &quot;kamrūn&quot;, &quot;shrimp&quot; (in Portuguese: &quot;camarão&quot;, similar to the former Portuguese name). Its current name derives from that of Abbas the Great () paired with &quot;bandar&quot; – &quot;port&quot;, meaning &quot;Port of Abbas&quot;.

==History==
=== Pre-Islamic history ===
The earliest record of Bandar Abbas is during the reign of Darius the Great (between 522 and 486 BCE). Darius&#x27;s commander, Silacus, embarked from Bandar Abbas to India and the Red Sea. During Alexander&#x27;s conquest of the Achaemenid Empire, Bandar Abbas was known under the name of Hormirzad.

===Portuguese period===

By the 16th century, Bandar Abbas was known as Gamrūn to the Persians. In 1565, a European navigator called it Bamdel Gombruc (that is, &quot;Bandar Gümrük&quot;, or &quot;Customhouse Port&quot;), citing this as the Persian and Turkish name. Bandar Abbas was conquered by the Portuguese in 1514, and was an important location to protect their commerce in the Persian Gulf and India. They named the city Comorão, due to the presence of lobsters and crabs on its shores. In 1614, Comorão was taken by Shah Abbas the Great from the Portuguese and renamed Bandar-e Abbas (&quot;Port of Abbas&quot;). Backed by the English Navy, Abbas developed the city (known to the English-speaking world as Gombraun) into a major port. By 1622, the Portuguese and English names had been officially combined to form Combrù or Combu, although the inhabitants still called it Bandar-e Abbas. Sir Thomas Herbert said the official English name was Gumbrown, but pronounced [gŏmrōōn]. He wrote in 1630 that &quot;some (but I commend them not) write it Gamrou, others Gomrow, and othersome Cummeroon.&quot; By the 1670s, the city was known as Gameroon.

In 1622 CE, Abbas defeated Portuguese troops with the help of English troops and Iranian commander Imam Quli Khan. In honor of this victory Gumbroon was renamed Bandar Abbas Port. In the current division of Bandar Abbas in Hormozgan province and one of the most important strategic and commercial center is in the vicinity of the Persian Gulf and Oman Sea.


===Dutch and English period ===
In 1625, a combined Anglo-Dutch fleet attacked the Portuguese at Bandar Abbas and took control of the trade posts. Soon, the Dutch East India Company outcompeted its English counterpart and eventually, from 1654 onwards, was in complete control of the local spice and silk trade, due to multiple English ships being taken, and the Action of 29 January 1654. The Dutch remained in complete control until 1765.

===Omani period===
Between 1794 and 1868, Bandar Abbas was under the control of the Sultanate of Oman and Zanzibar through a lease agreement with Persia. The details of the original lease apparently differed between the Arabic and Persian versions. The Omanis controlled the coastal stretch of some 100 miles from Sadij to Khamir, and inland about 30 miles, as far as Shamil. They also controlled the islands of Hormuz and Qeshm. In 1823, the Persians attempted to oust the Omanis, but the sultan managed to keep his hold on Bandar through bribery and tribute of the governor of Shiraz. In 1845–1846, an army under the governor general of Fars menaced Bandar to extort tribute, while another army under the governor of Kerman besieged Minab. The Omanis threatened to blockade Persia, but the British resident at Bushir convinced them to back down.

The Persians recovered the city in 1854, while the sultan was in Zanzibar. Under British pressure following the Anglo-Persian War in 1856, Persia renewed Oman&#x27;s lease on favourable terms. It was clarified that the leased territory belonged to the province of Fars and that the Persian flag would fly over Bandar Abbas. The rental rate was also increased. Under British pressure the agreement was renewed in 1868, but at a higher rate of rent and for a shorter duration. Two months after its renewal, the lease was cancelled by the Persian government, citing a clause which permitted its termination if the sultan of Oman were overthrown.

===Contemporary history===
An earthquake in July 1902 damaged parts of the city, including the governor&#x27;s house and the customs office, and nearby Qeshm Island.

Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi paid particular attention to Bandar Abbas as a strategic port and during his time the government invested huge amounts of capital in the infrastructure.

Bandar Abbas serves as a major shipping point, mostly for imports, and has a long history of trade with India, particularly the port of Surat. Thousands of tourists visit the city and nearby islands including Qeshm and Hormuz every year.

Before initial plans to develop it as a major harbor, Bandar Abbas was a small fishing port with approximately 17,000 residents in 1955. By 2001, it had grown into a major city. It has a population of 450,000 (2011 estimate).

<text>Between the Sheets is a 2003 British television miniseries. This dramedy depicts the romantic and sexual challenges of several different couples who are all linked in some way.

==Plot==
Hazel Delany walks out on her husband, owner of a stripclub, hours after their daughter&#x27;s wedding; she&#x27;s upset with him because he has had a string of affairs, and he is dismayed by her disinterest in sex (and exasperated that his mother has a better relationship with her boyfriend than he and his wife do). Hazel and Peter eventually go to a sex therapist to overcome their difficulties. Peter is hiding a secret about one of his ex-mistresses, and Hazel has a sexual awakening in the arms of a younger man.

Hazel and Peter&#x27;s son, Simon, has left a long-term relationship. After the ex tells Hazel that she is pregnant, Hazel pushes him to reconcile with and marry his girlfriend, but he&#x27;s reluctant to do so, because he has fallen for one of his father&#x27;s nightclub hostesses.

Alona Cunningham works as a sex therapist yet finds her boyfriend, Paul, unenthusiastic in the bedroom. Paul works as a probation officer and reveals that he is being accused of having had sex with one of his 15-year-old clients. As Paul&#x27;s alleged misconduct is being investigated, Alona catches her teenage son sleeping with the au pair, and through the stress of all this considers having an affair. The couple end up seeing one of Alona&#x27;s colleagues for therapy.

<text>The DFS 40 was a tailless research aircraft designed by Alexander Lippisch as the Delta V in 1937. The DFS 40 was a more advanced design than the previous DFS 39 (Delta IV), and was built for comparison with that aircraft.

Where the DFS 39 had a pronounced fuselage with low-mounted wing, the DFS 40 was closer to a flying wing, with the wing-fuselage junction blended so that there was no clear dividing line.

The DFS 40 was flown for the first time by Heini Dittmar in 1938, shortly before Lippisch departed the DFS (&quot;Deutsche Forschungsanstalt für Segelflug&quot; - German Research Institute for Sailplane Flight) to begin work at Messerschmitt, taking much of his design team with him. Soon afterwards, without Lippisch there to supervise the project, the aircraft was crashed due to an error in center of gravity calculations that resulted in it entering a flat spin during flight. While the test pilot escaped by parachute, the DFS 40 was destroyed.

<doc id="464377" wikidata="Q667685" url="?curid=464377" title="List of sovereign states without armed forces">
<text>This is a list of [[sovereign state]]s without armed forces. Dependent territories (such as Bermuda, Guam, and the Northern Mariana Islands) whose defence is the responsibility of another country or an army alternative are excluded. The term &quot;armed forces&quot; refers to any government-sponsored defense used to further the domestic and foreign policies of their respective government. Some of the countries listed, such as Iceland and Monaco, have no standing armies but still have a non-police military force.

Many of the 21 countries listed here typically have had a long-standing agreement with a former colonial or protecting power; one example of the latter is the agreement between Monaco and France, which has existed for at least 300 years.
Similarly, the Compact of Free Association countries of the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM), the Marshall Islands, and Palau rely on the United States for their defence. They ensure their national security concerns are addressed through annual Joint Committee Meetings to discuss defence matters with the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command. Andorra has a small army, and can request defensive aid if necessary, while Iceland has a unique agreement since 1951 with the United States which requires them to provide defence to Iceland when needed, although permanent armed forces have not been stationed there since 2006.

The remaining countries are responsible for their own defence, and operate either without any armed forces, or with limited armed forces. Some of the countries, such as Costa Rica and Grenada, underwent a process of demilitarization. Other countries were formed without armed forces, such as Samoa over years ago; the primary reason being that they were, or still are, under protection from another nation at their point of independence.

<text>The prime minister of Malta () is the head of government, which is the highest official of Malta. The prime minister chairs Cabinet meetings, and selects its ministers to serve in their respective portfolios. The prime minister holds office by virtue of their ability to command the confidence of the Parliament, as such they sit as members of Parliament.

The prime minister is appointed by the president, in doing so, the president is of the opinion that the appointed individual is the most able to command the majority of the House of Representatives; typically, this individual is the leader of a political party or coalition of parties that hold the largest number of seats in the House of Representatives. 

The prime minister is &quot;ex officio&quot; an appointee to the grade of Companion of Honour - K.U.O.M. (&quot;Kumpanju tal-Unur&quot;) of the National Order of Merit.

==Establishment of the office and developments==

The office of &quot;Head of Ministry&quot; was created as soon as the Colony of Malta was granted autonomous government in 1921. The 1921 constitution was suspended twice before being revoked. On the first occasion (1930–33), the Head of Ministry (at the time, Lord Strickland) and his cabinet were retained. Following the second suspension in 1934, the cabinet was dismissed.

The constitution was revoked in 1936 and the post did not exist for as long as Malta was under direct colonial administration. The office was re-established with the grant of self-government in 1947 with the post being renamed as &quot;Prime Minister of Malta&quot;. The post was again suppressed when the 1947 constitution was again suspended, between 1958 and 1962, but was retained largely unchanged in the 1964 independence constitution and the subsequent amendments of 1974 which transformed the form of government into a republic.

==Assumption of office==
Before assuming office the nominee must take the oath of office before the House of Representatives of Malta.

The oath reads: &quot;I, (name of nominee), solemnly swear/affirm that I will faithfully execute the office of Prime Minister (perform the functions of the Prime Minister) of Malta, and will, to the best of my ability preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of Malta. (So help me God).&quot;

==Constitutional functions==
The president of Malta, who nominally heads the executive branch, appoints as prime minister the member of parliament who, in the opinion of the president, is best able to command a majority of the members of the House of Representatives. The prime minister advises the president on the appointment of the other ministers.

The prime minister is constitutionally obliged to keep the president fully informed on the general conduct of the government. Whenever the prime minister is away from Malta, the president may authorise any other member of the Cabinet to perform those functions and that member may perform those functions temporarily. It is usually the deputy prime minister who fills in this role as acting prime minister.

==Office of the Prime Minister of Malta (OPM)==
As minister in his own right, the prime minister is responsible for a number of departments of government. The Office of the Prime Minister (OPM) has been based at the Auberge de Castille in Valletta since 1972, playing a central role in decision-making apart from being the administrative headquarters of the government.

The OPM&#x27;s mission is to support the prime minister in providing leadership and direction for a stable and effective government. The core departments of OPM include the Cabinet Secretariat, the Management and Personnel Office and the Department of Information.

==Official residences==
Villa Francia, situated in the village of Lija is the official residence of the prime minister, while the Girgenti Palace, situated in Siġġiewi is the prime minister&#x27;s summer residence. They are predominantly used for public ceremonies, including receiving notable people, and are considered symbolic buildings.

==List of prime ministers==
As of 2022, there have been fourteen prime ministers of Malta, four of which are still living.

<doc id="464400" wikidata="Q21439067" url="?curid=464400" title="Aquificota">
<text>The Aquificota phylum is a diverse collection of bacteria that live in harsh environmental settings. The name &quot;Aquificota&quot; was given to this phylum based on an early genus identified within this group, &quot;Aquifex&quot; (“water maker”), which is able to produce water by oxidizing hydrogen. They have been found in springs, pools, and oceans. They are autotrophs, and are the primary carbon fixers in their environments. These bacteria are Gram-negative, non-spore-forming rods. They are true bacteria (domain Bacteria) as opposed to the other inhabitants of extreme environments, the Archaea.

==Taxonomy==
The &quot;Aquificota&quot; currently contain 15 genera and 42 validly published species. The phylum comprises three class with each of them having their respective order. Aquificales consists of the families Aquificaceae and Hydrogenothermaceae, while the Desulfurobacteriaceae are the only family within the Desulfurobacteriales. &quot;Thermosulfidibacter takaii&quot; is not assigned to a family within the phylum based on its phylogenetic distinctness from both orders. It is currently classified as a member of Aquificales, but it has shown more physiological similarity to the Desulfobacteriaceae.

==Molecular signatures and phylogenetic position==
Comparative genomic studies have identified several conserved signature indels (CSIs) that are specific for all species belonging to the phylum &quot;Aquificota&quot; and provide potential molecular markers. The order Aquificales can be distinguished from Desulfobacteriales by several CSIs across different proteins that are specific for each group. Additional CSIs have been found at the family level, and can be used to demarcate &quot;Aquificota&quot; and Hydrogenothermaceae from all other bacteria. In parallel with the observed CSI distribution, the orders within the &quot;Aquificota&quot; are also physiologically distinct from one another. Members of the Desulfurobacteriales are strict anaerobes that exclusively oxidize hydrogen for energy, whereas those belonging to the Aquificales are microaerophilic, and capable of oxidizing other compounds (such as sulfur or thiosulfate) in addition to hydrogen.

Several CSIs have also been identified that are specific for the species from the &quot;Aquificota&quot; and provide potential molecular markers for this phylum. Additionally, a 51-amino-acid insertion has been identified in SecA preprotein translocase which is shared by all members of the &quot;Aquificota&quot;, as well as all members of the order Thermotogales. Phylogenetic studies demonstrated that the presence of the same CSI within these two unrelated groups of bacteria is not due to lateral gene transfer, rather the CSI likely developed independently in these two groups of thermophiles due to selective pressure. The 51 amino acid insertion is located on the surface of SecA near the binding site of ADP/ATP. Molecular dynamic simulations revealed a network water molecules forming an intermediate interaction between residues of the 51 aa CSI and ADP molecules, which serves to stabilize the hydrogen bonds formed between ADP/ATP and the protein. It is suggested that the network of hydrogen bonds formed between the water molecules, CSI residues and ADP/ATP helps to maintain ATP/ADP binding to the SecA protein at high temperatures, which contributes to the bacteria’s overall thermostability. 

In the 16S rRNA gene trees, the &quot;Aquificota&quot; species branch in the proximity of the phylum Thermotogota (another phylum comprising hyperthermophilic organisms) close to the archaeal-bacterial branch point. However, a close relationship of the &quot;Aquificota&quot; to the Thermotogota and the deep branching of the &quot;Aquificota&quot; is not supported by some phylogenetic studies based upon other gene/protein sequences and also by CSIs in several highly conserved universal proteins 16S-23S-5S operons. In contrast to the very high G+C content of their rRNAs (i.e. more than 62%), which is required for stability of their secondary structures at high growth temperatures, the inference that the &quot;Aquificota&quot; do not constitute a deep-branch lineage is also independently strongly supported by CSIs in a number of important proteins (viz. Hsp70, Hsp60, RpoB, RpoB and AlaRS), which support its placement in the proximity of the phylum Proteobacteria, particularly the Campylobacterota. A specific relationship of the &quot;Aquificota&quot; to the Proteobacteria is supported by a two-amino-acid CSI in the protein inorganic pyrophosphatase, which is uniquely found in species from these two phyla. Cavalier-Smith has also suggested that the &quot;Aquificota&quot; are closely related to the Proteobacteria. In contrast to the above cited analyses that are based on a few indels or on single genes, analyses on informational genes, which appeared to be less often transferred to the &quot;Aquifex&quot; lineage than noninformational genes, most often placed the Aquificales close to the Thermotogales. These authors explain the frequently observed grouping of &quot;Aquificota&quot; with Campylobacterota as result of frequent horizontal gene transfer due to shared ecological niches.

Along with the Thermotogota, the &quot;Aquificota&quot; are thermophilic eubacteria.

<text>Nikoloz (Lasha) Janashia (Georgian: ნიკოლოზ (ლაშა) ჯანაშია; November 18, 1931 in Tbilisi – September 7, 1982 in Tbilisi) was a famous Georgian historian and public benefactor. 

Janashia born in Tbilisi, son of a noted Georgian historian Simon Janashia (1900–1947).

In 1954, Janashia graduated from the faculty of history of the Tbilisi State University.

He began as a research fellow at the Institute of History and Ethnology of the Georgian Academy of Sciences (GAS) in 1957. After he received his PhD in history in 1962, he came a senior research fellow at GAS, and from 1970 to 1982, he served as a deputy director of its Institute of Manuscripts. He was also hired as an associate professor at Tbilisi State University in 1965, a position he maintained until his death.

Janashia also served as a scientific secretary of the Historical Society of Georgia, a member of the Commission of the source studies of the history of Georgia of the Presidium of GAS.

The main fields of Janashia&#x27;s research were the history of Georgia of the 4th-5th centuries, and Georgian and Armenian sources of the history of Georgia.

<text>USS &quot;Volador&quot; (SS-490), a , was the second ship of the United States Navy to be named for the volador.

==Construction and commissioning==
The contract to build her was awarded to Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in Kittery, Maine, and her keel was laid down on 15 June 1945, but work on her construction was discontinued in January 1946. Her unfinished hulk remained on the ways until August 1947, when construction resumed, now including GUPPY II enhancements to the basic &quot;Tench&quot;-class design. &quot;Volador&quot; was launched on 21 May 1948, sponsored by Mrs. Harriet Rose Morton (&quot;née&quot; Nelson), widow of Commander Dudley W. Morton, and commissioned on 1 October 1948, with Lieutenant Commander Howard A. Thompson in command.

==Operational history==

===West Coast===

&quot;Volador&quot; completed her builder&#x27;s trials on 20 January 1949, left Portsmouth three days later, and stopped at Newport, Rhode Island, and New London, Connecticut, before sailing for the Gulf of Mexico on 5 February. &quot;Volador&quot; arrived at New Orleans, Louisiana, on 11 February and proceeded to the West Coast, via Galveston, Texas, and the Panama Canal, and arrived at San Diego, California, on 11 March. The submarine conducted local operations along the California coast between San Diego, California, and San Francisco, California, until she departed San Diego on 13 October, bound for Hawaii. She arrived at Pearl Harbor on 7 November but returned to San Diego on 18 November and spent the remainder of 1949 as well as most of the following year on the West Coast, conducting various training exercises. During that period, she also visited Portland, Oregon, Vancouver, Washington, and Pearl Harbor. In June 1950, &quot;Volador&quot; embarked reserves at Treasure Island, San Francisco, and proceeded on a two-week reserve cruise to Hawaii. En route, the Korean War broke out, and the submarine spent two months training in Hawaiian waters before returning to San Diego for operations on the West Coast that lasted into the summer of 1951.

===Korean War===

The submarine departed San Diego, California, on 21 July, bound, via Pearl Harbor, for Japan and arrived at Yokosuka on 15 August 1951. On 18 August, &quot;Volador&quot; got underway from Yokosuka for a period of special operations. Her orders directed the submarine to conduct an undetected reconnaissance patrol in the area of Hokkaidō, Japan, for a four-week period, in order to keep Commander, Naval Forces Far East, informed of any Soviet or People&#x27;s Republic of China&#x27;s seaborne and airborne activity in that area. Throughout her patrol, the submarine identified and photographed numerous radar contacts and made rendezvous with submarines and to exchange patrol reports and other valuable information. On 16 September, &quot;Volador&quot; held ceremonies commemorating her 1000th dive. After a 24-hour engineering run in Tsugaru Strait, she ended her patrol and arrived in Yokosuka on 22 September. From 11 to 15 November, &quot;Volador&quot; conducted ASW operations with destroyers , , and in the Atami area. From 16 November to 9 December, &quot;Volador&quot; participated in hunter/killer operations en route to Okinawa from Japan in company with Task Group (TG) 96.7. The submarine visited Buckner Bay, Okinawa, before heading home via Pearl Harbor.

&quot;Volador&quot; returned to San Diego, California, in January 1952 and conducted local operations until early summer. She then spent three months in the Juan de Fuca Strait and the Puget Sound area before entering the Mare Island Naval Shipyard in October. During the five-month overhaul which followed, a new battery and an Askania automatic depth control system were installed. Upon her return to San Diego, &quot;Volador&quot; provided services to ASW surface units, aircraft, and the Fleet Sonar School and participated in type training, Exercise &quot;Pacphibex&quot;, and hunter/killer exercises. She departed San Diego on 7 August 1953 and arrived at Pearl Harbor on 15 August, received briefings by members of the Commander in Chief, Pacific Fleet, and the Commander, Submarines, Pacific staffs on 17 and 18 August and tested experimental sonar equipment at sea on 20 August.

===Special operations===

On 22 August 1953, &quot;Volador&quot; began a period of special operations, departing Pearl Harbor for an Alaskan training cruise which kept her in northern waters until October 1953. Her patrol station was northeast of the St. Lawrence Bay, and, on 1 September, she made rendezvous with submarine off the southwest cape, St. Lawrence Island; the following day, she snorkeled to an area off Brook Bank, then proceeded to the Bering Strait area. &quot;Volador&quot; conducted a shipping reconnaissance patrol until the night of 27 September 1953 when she made rendezvous with and was relieved by submarine . &quot;Volador&quot; arrived at Pearl Harbor on 7 October 1953. During her second patrol, she contacted a total of 63 ships and identified and photographed the majority of them.

===Western Pacific===

Returning to San Diego, California, &quot;Volador&quot; rendered services and conducted type training there until May 1954, when she entered the Mare Island Naval Shipyard for overhaul. The yard work was completed in October 1954 and &quot;Volador&quot; returned to San Diego for local operations. Departing San Diego on 3 January 1955 for her second tour of duty in the Western Pacific (WestPac), &quot;Volador&quot; proceeded to Yokosuka, Japan, via Pearl Harbor. Upon arrival at Yokosuka on 26 January 1955, she conducted type training and furnished ASW services to a destroyer division and elements of the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force until 1 March 1955. She then completed two weeks of routine upkeep on 13 March, prior to departure for another period of special operations on 14 March.

&quot;Volador&quot; transited Tsugaru Strait and, on 19 March commenced a submerged patrol on the lane between Vladivostok and La Perouse Strait which lasted until 8 April. She then commenced a transit of Tsugaru Strait and set a course back to Yokosuka where she moored on 11 April 1955. After the completion of this patrol, &quot;Volador&quot; was commended for excellent photography, correct identification of contacts, and accurate reporting of identifying characteristics regarding the 33 ships contacted.

===West Coast===

Visiting Subic Bay, Hong Kong, and Pearl Harbor while en route, &quot;Volador&quot; returned to San Diego, California, on 1 July. The submarine operated along the West Coast for the next two years. In August 1957, &quot;Volador&quot; commenced another Far East deployment. She arrived at Pearl Harbor on 3 August and departed three days later for a 30-day patrol off Petropavlovsk, Kamchatka. Her mission was to gather intelligence information. Due to motor casualties nine days after arrival on station, she departed the Petropavlovsk area on 25 August and arrived at Yokosuka five days later. During this patrol &quot;Volador&quot; contacted 13 merchant ships and eight warships.

On 8 November 1957, the submarine arrived at Subic Bay for a scheduled upkeep and departed on 17 November for Yokosuka. &quot;Volador&quot; arrived at Yokosuka on 26 November; and, from 11 December through 4 January 1958, she conducted a special reconnaissance patrol in the Sea of Okhotsk. During this 17-day undetected special patrol, she completed her photographic mission in spite of severe ice and blizzard conditions. Returning to Japan, &quot;Volador&quot; departed Yokosuka on 9 January for Pearl Harbor. She arrived at Hawaii on 19 January and departed two days later for San Diego, arriving on 28 January 1958.

&quot;Volador&quot; remained at San Diego until 3 October, when she departed for Vancouver, Washington. Twenty guests of the Vancouver Navy League were embarked at Longview, Washington, for a ship&#x27;s visit and disembarked upon arrival at Vancouver. &quot;Volador&quot; was welcomed by a gathering of about 500 citizens, plus the local high school band, and was presented a plaque in a simple ceremony on board. She departed Vancouver on 5 October and visited Seattle, Washington, and Port Angeles, Washington, through the month of October. &quot;Volador&quot; visited Victoria, British Columbia, from 31 October through 3 November. Canadian frigate HMCS &quot;Antigonish&quot; was the host ship, and wardroom officers were entertained on board and in the homes of the host&#x27;s officers.

The submarine patrolled the areas of Esquimalt, Washington, Port Angeles, Washington, Tacoma, Washington, and Seattle, Washington until 22 November when she began her return trip to San Diego, California, arriving on 26 November. &quot;Volador&quot; operated in the San Diego-San Francisco area until 5 May 1959 when she entered the San Francisco Naval Shipyard at Hunters Point for overhaul.

Completing overhaul in October 1959, the submarine returned to San Diego, California, for local operations until leaving for WestPac in late December. While thus deployed, &quot;Volador&quot; participated in many operations including amphibious Exercise &quot;Blue Star&quot; and SEATO Exercise &quot;Sea Lion.&quot; Upon returning to San Diego, she participated in various local operations during the next 20 months.

In August 1960, &quot;Volador&quot; was assigned as a target submarine for the USS Kingfor the testing the new ASROC MK-44 torpedo system. While at periscope depth and being tracked by USS King&#x27;s SQS-23B sonar, King fired an ASROC. The MK-44 torpedo separated from the rocket motor hit the Volador&#x27;s sail after entering the water, leaving a hole in its sail.

===Conversion===

&quot;Volador&quot; spent the early months of 1962 in local operations in the San Diego area until she conducted a reserve cruise from 4 to 11 April. Upon her return, she was placed in commission, in reserve, while undergoing FRAM Mk 1 conversion to a GUPPY III configuration at the San Francisco Naval Shipyard. The submarine was saved from possible total destruction due to a spectacular pier fire at the shipyard on 9 and 10 November 1962 by the duty section led by the duty officer and the executive officer. In September 1962, &quot;Volador&quot; was returned to active service. The conversion was completed in February 1963. A hull section was installed in addition to a large amount of new electronic, fire control, and sonar equipment, making &quot;Volador&quot; one of the most modern diesel-electric submarines in the Fleet. After trials in Puget Sound, she returned to San Diego in April 1963 to take part in local operations.

===Vietnam era===

The submarine departed San Diego in September 1963 for another WestPac deployment. Near the conclusion of her tour, &quot;Volador&quot; conducted a special assignment which resulted in her receiving a commendation from the Commander, Submarine Force, United States Pacific Fleet, for &quot;a mission of great value to the government of the United States.&quot; After returning to San Diego, she was assigned to local and Pacific coast operations.

In late 1964, &quot;Volador&quot; again distinguished herself by sending the submarine hulk ex- to the bottom after firing one homing torpedo in a weapons system evaluation test, making her the only submarine in the Navy to claim two peace-time &quot;kills&quot;. Commander, Submarine Force, United States Pacific Fleet, awarded the &quot;E&quot; for overall performance &quot;and for being adjudged the outstanding submarine in Submarine Squadron 5 in fleet intra-type competition for fiscal year 1965.&quot;

&quot;Volador&quot; resumed operations on 3 January 1966 after a short period of holiday routine in San Diego alongside the submarine tender . The greater part of January was spent conducting weapons system accuracy trials at the Dabob Bay and Carr Inlet facilities in the Puget Sound area. &quot;Volador&quot; returned to San Diego on 3 February and conducted a week of refresher training commencing on 10 February. Following this, she began a three-week upkeep period during which she successfully underwent an administrative inspection and a nuclear weapons acceptance inspection. On 7 March 1966, &quot;Volador&quot; left port for a week of type training in the local operating areas during which time sound trials were conducted to investigate the problem of noisy propellers. She got underway on 4 April for a four-day restricted availability at the San Francisco Bay Naval Shipyard where new propellers were installed. The remainder of April and the period until 11 May were spent in the San Diego area conducting various tests and preparing for deployment to WestPac.

The submarine departed San Diego on 12 May and, after a four-day stopover in Pearl Harbor, reported to Commander, Seventh Fleet, for operational control on 3 June and arrived at Yokosuka, Japan, on 6 June 1966.

Following an eight-day upkeep period for voyage repairs, &quot;Volador&quot; departed Yokosuka on 14 June to provide ASW services to ships and aircraft of the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force. Throughout the summer, she continued to conduct exercises and provide services which were made more meaningful by the mutual exchange of officers. The submarine operated in the areas of Yokosuka and Iwakuni, Japan, and Buckner Bay, Okinawa.

&quot;Volador&quot; was in upkeep status at Yokosuka from 15 to 23 September. She got underway for Hong Kong on 26 September, after which she stopped at Kaohsiung and Midway Island and arrived at Pearl Harbor on 6 November. She departed two days later for San Diego. &quot;Volador&quot; arrived at her home port on 19 November and spent the remainder of 1966 in holiday leave and upkeep status. She was nominated for the Captain Edward F. Ney Memorial Award for the most outstanding general mess for 1966. On 1 July 1966, &quot;Volador&quot; was awarded the Squadron 5 award for fire control and weapons excellence.

Operations resumed on 15 January 1967 after a period of holiday routine alongside the Submarine Facility, Ballast Point, San Diego. The first half of 1967 was spent participating in various exercises, undergoing upkeep and repairs, and qualifying for a nuclear weapons technical proficiency inspection, a material inspection, and an operational readiness inspection.

&quot;Volador&quot; then departed San Diego on 24 July en route to Auckland, New Zealand. She made a two-day stop at Pago Pago, American Samoa, and arrived at Auckland on 15 August. The submarine participated in LONGEX 67, then departed for Subic Bay and arrived there on 10 September for five days of upkeep and voyage repairs. She participated in Exercise &quot;Gillnet&quot;, visited Buckner Bay, Okinawa, and arrived at Yokosuka, Japan, on 26 September. The remainder of the year was spent conducting various operations out of Yokosuka.

===USS &quot;Pueblo&quot; incident===

On 1 January 1968, &quot;Volador&quot; was en route to Hong Kong for a port visit. She arrived back at Yokosuka, Japan, on 24 January to learn that her deployment was being indefinitely extended because of mobilization response to the capture of &quot;environmental research ship&quot; by the North Koreans. &quot;Volador&quot; departed for sea on 31 January and returned 31 days later. The submarine left Japan and made a two-day stopover at Pearl Harbor before arriving in San Diego on 29 March. The period until 26 June was spent in post-deployment upkeep and local operations. On 27 June, &quot;Volador&quot; departed for a regular shipyard overhaul in the Mare Island Naval Shipyard at Vallejo, California at which time a Mk 48 fire control system was installed. Post-overhaul trials were conducted in the San Francisco, California, operating area on 20 and 22 December, and the submarine finished the year at the San Francisco Naval Shipyard, Hunters Point.

Throughout January and February 1969, &quot;Volador&quot; held sound and weapons trials in the Puget Sound area. The next two months were spent in upkeep and training before heading to the Pacific northwest for a quality assurance system test of the Mk 48 Astor torpedo. After the firings, while en route to home waters, a stop was made at Monterey, California, on 20 May and 21 May to provide familiarization cruises for students of the Naval Postgraduate School, local members of the Navy League, and city leaders. The trip was an outstanding success and received wide dissemination through the local press media.

The submarine returned to San Diego, California, and commenced an upkeep period and a final workup for deployment. &quot;Volador&quot; departed San Diego on 28 July 1969 for Yokosuka, Japan, via Pearl Harbor. During the Christmas holidays, &quot;Volador&quot; visited Bangkok, Thailand, enjoying the exotic sights and the Thai people and providing a week of services to the Royal Thai Navy. Leaving Bangkok on 26 December, the ship headed for Hong Kong and was en route as the year ended.

&quot;Volador&quot; left Hong Kong for two weeks of operations and liberty in Yokosuka, Japan, before returning to San Diego, California, on 12 February 1970. The next month was a period of upkeep and rest for the crew. On 17 January 1970 she was involved in a collision with the Japanese freighter MIYAHIME MARU at the entrance to Tokyo bay, with both suffering minor damage. The following three months were filled with numerous exercises and drills to retrain the crew and to prepare for interfleet transfer to the East Coast. &quot;Volador&quot; departed San Diego on 7 August for transit to the East Coast via the Panama Canal. She arrived at her new home port of Charleston, South Carolina, and spent the remainder of 1970 there.

===Mediterranean Sea===

During the first few months of 1971, &quot;Volador&quot; conducted exercises and drills and underwent upkeep in preparation for deployment to the Mediterranean Sea. On 19 April, she arrived at Rota, Spain, and commenced participation in Exercise &quot;Dawn Patrol with several NATO units on 23 April. Upon completion of this exercise on 12 May, &quot;Volador&quot; visited Piraeus, Greece; Augusta Bay, Sicily; Palma, Majorca; Villefranche, France; Gibraltar; Naples, Italy; and Málaga, Spain; and returned to Rota on 19 July for turnover. &quot;Volador&quot; departed for Charleston, South Carolina, on 21 July after spending three months in the Mediterranean Sea. On 1 August, she was diverted from her homeward transit to render assistance to the tanker M/T &quot;Lacon&quot;, a Liberian vessel which was on fire. &quot;Volador&quot; arrived at Charleston on 5 August and began a period of leave and upkeep until 20 September when she entered the Charleston Naval Shipyard, commencing a regular overhaul and battery renewal.

==&quot;Gianfranco Gazzana Priaroggia&quot; (S 502)==

On 18 August 1972, &quot;Volador&quot; was transferred to Italy. She was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 5 December 1977.

&quot;Volador&quot; and were transferred and commissioned into the Italian Navy at the same time. Some civilian sources disagree as which of them became and which became &quot;Gianfranco Gazzana Priaroggia&quot; (S 502). The United States Department of the Navy&#x27;s Naval Historical Center maintains that &quot;Pickerel&quot; became &quot;Primo Longobordo&quot; and &quot;Volador&quot; became &quot;Gianfranco Gazzana Priaroggia&quot;. &quot;Gianfranco Gazzana Priaroggia&quot; was stricken in 1981.

<text>USS &quot;Pickerel&quot; (SS-524), a &quot;Tench&quot;-class submarine, was the second ship of the United States Navy to be named for a young or small pike.

==Construction and commissioning==
The contract to build &quot;Pickerel&quot; was awarded to the Boston Navy Yard in Boston, Massachusetts, and her keel was laid down on 8 February 1944. She was launched without a christening ceremony on 15 December 1944. After being towed to the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in Kittery, Maine, for completion, she was simultaneously christened and commissioned on 4 April 1949, sponsored by Mrs. John R. Moore and commanded by Lieutenant Commander Paul R. Schratz.

==Early service==

After sea trials, &quot;Pickerel&quot; departed New London, Connecticut, on 10 August, and headed for Hawaii via East and Gulf coast ports, and the Panama Canal and arrived Pearl Harbor on 28 September where she joined SubDiv 11.

From 16 March to 5 April 1950, &quot;Pickerel&quot; completed a voyage from Hong Kong to Pearl Harbor in 21 days while completely submerged, probably the longest distance ever traveled by a submerged diesel-electric submarine. During her first deployment in the Western Pacific in 1950, &quot;Pickerel&quot; spent four months in the Korean War zone, one of the first submarines to enter the Korean War. Much of Pickerel&#x27;s early years are documented in Paul R. Schratz memoirs &quot;Submarine Commander: A Story of World War II and Korea&quot;, where Paul as Pickerel&#x27;s commissioning captain walks the readers through putting a new modernized GUPPY &quot;Tench&quot;-class Fleet submarine through its paces.

Returning to Pearl Harbor in the spring of 1951, &quot;Pickerel&quot; operated in the Hawaiian area undergoing tests of maximum capabilities, and conducting intensive training until she returned to the Far East in July 1953.

Upon returning to Hawaii early in 1954, &quot;Pickerel&quot; resumed service for our aircraft and surface anti-submarine forces there and, but for overhaul, continued this important duty until returning to the Western Pacific in June 1955. She returned to Hawaii 1 December.

==1960s==
&quot;Pickerel&quot; alternated North Pacific with WestPac duty through 1963 with the exception of a conversion period during 1962 for GUPPY III modernization.

&quot;Pickerel&quot; operated out of Pearl Harbor during 1964 until 28 December, when she departed en route Yokosuka to begin a WestPac tour as a unit of the Seventh Fleet. In the years that followed, she continued this pattern of alternating services in Hawaii with deployments in the Far East. In the fall of 1966, her duties in WestPac were broadened to include operations in the Vietnam combat zone on Yankee Station.

After a year in Hawaiian waters, &quot;Pickerel&quot; headed west once more on 16 January 1968. She visited various ports of the Orient before returning to Yankee Station on 8 May. Following service in the combat zone, she reached Pearl Harbor via Japan on 8 July. Her home port was changed to San Diego, California on 1 August and she headed for the West Coast and Naval Shipyard, Hunters Point, on 22 August.

After completing overhaul in the Spring of 1969, &quot;Pickerel&quot; spent several weeks in the Puget Sound, Washington, area undergoing weapons and sound trials. She headed for Pearl Harbor in late April/early May 1969(?). &quot;Pickerel&quot; was transferred to SUBLANT/SUBRON 4 and arrived in her new home port of Charleston, South Carolina, on 9 June 1969.

==1970s and after==
&quot;Pickerel&quot; circumnavigated South America as part of operation UNITAS XI with , , and , as part of a goodwill tour and ASW (Anti-Submarine Warfare) training exercise for the U.S Navy ships and the Navies of Venezuela, Brazil, Argentina, Chile and Peru. &quot;Pickerel&quot; transited the Strait of Magellan and Panama Canal as part of that deployment. The deployment started 23 August 1970 and was complete 4 December 1970.

&quot;Pickerel&quot; was transferred to Italy on 18 August 1972 and stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 5 December 1977.

==&quot;Primo Longobardo&quot; (S 501)==
&quot;Pickerel&quot; and were transferred and commissioned into the Italian Navy at the same time. Some civilian sources disagree as which of them became &quot;Primo Longobardo&quot; and which became . The United States Department of the Navy&#x27;s Naval Historical Center maintains that &quot;Pickerel&quot; became &quot;Primo Longobardo&quot; (S 501) and &quot;Volador&quot; became &quot;Gianfranco Gazzana Priaroggia&quot;. &quot;Primo Longobardo&quot; was stricken on either 31 January 1980 or 31 May 1981.
