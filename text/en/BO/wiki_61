<text>The IBM ThinkPad 701 is a subnotebook in the ThinkPad line by IBM. The 701 is colloquially known as the Butterfly due to its sliding keyboard, which was designed by John Karidis. It was developed from 1993 and sold from March 1995 until later that year and priced between and . The 701 was the most sold laptop in 1995 and has received 27 design awards. It was based on either the DX2 or the DX4 version of the Intel i486, combined with the CT-65545 graphics chip. The 701Cs version used a DSTN display, while the 701C used a TFT LCD. It was pre-installed with Windows 3.11 and for the DX4 models also with OS/2 Warp 3.0. The 701 was discontinued because the keyboard design was no longer a necessity after screen sizes increased.

== Development ==
The 701 was a collaboration project between the manufacturing facility at the Research Triangle Park near Raleigh, North Carolina, United States and the development facility at Yamato, Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan. The concept of the keyboard was first developed as a photocopy of a keyboard in spring 1993. In the summer, a plexiglass prototype was developed. The decision to fund the notebook was made in the fall of 1993, with the introduction planned a year later. Because the process was delayed, it used the Intel 486 instead of the faster Pentium when it was released. The keyboard was designed by with John Karidis, Sam Lucente and Robert Tennant. Richard Sapper has been responsible for the overall ThinkPad design. Other contributors include Lawrence Stone, Michael King, Martin Tucker and Gerard McVicker.

The 701 was codenamed butterfly internally at IBM, and engineers also wanted to use this name as the official one. The IBM legal department did not allow the name of living creatures for products. It was part of the subnotebook series like the ThinkPad 500, but they did not want to attach the same name to this model due to bad sales of the previous 500 model. The 600 series was a reserved name, so they used the 700 series which was intended for the high-end models.

&quot;PCMag&quot; noted that the LCD manufacturing by Sharp Corporation was a departure from Display Technologies, Inc. for the 700 series.

== Release ==
IBM bought advertising space in major newspapers, in the lower corner or on the upper right side of a page. They only used an image of a butterfly without anything else. Days later, they added the IBM logo with a butterfly icon. A couple of days later, the text &quot;Watch for the announcement&quot; was added.

After the announcement, IBM received a legal threat about the usage of the name &quot;butterfly&quot; by someone known only as George, as it violated their company&#x27;s trademark on a supercomputer product named Butterfly. IBM replied that they did not plan to use it as a brand name, and no legal action or further correspondence took place.

Initially, IBM failed to supply the demand for the 701.

Because of the high reward of the 701 design, model kits were developed so a souvenir version of the 701 could be made.

== Specifications ==

The subnotebook series was released in different variations, with either the Intel DX2 or Intel DX4, LCD with dual scan or TFT active matrix. They were sold with different disk sizes. They all contained the same graphics chips and preinstalled software, except for the DX4 versions which were dual booted with IBM OS/2. It was based on the AT bus and could be extended with a Dock II type. Pre-installed software included Lotus , Organizer, ScreenCam, PRODIGY, America Online, Video for Windows 1.1 Runtime and Audiofile TalkWorks. The operating system installed was IBM DOS 6.3, Windows 3.11, while DX4 machines included OS/2 Warp 3.0 in dual boot mode with selected BonusPack. The graphics processing unit (GPU) was a CT-65545, with 1MB DRAM by Chips and Technologies on VL-Bus 2.0. It supported an external SVGA display up to 1024x768 with 256 colors at 70 Hz.

=== Keyboard ===
The keyboard used in the 701 is officially known as the &quot;TrackWrite&quot;, but commonly known and code-named as the &quot;butterfly keyboard.&quot; The design allowed the 701 series to be both compact (when closed) and comfortable to use (when open), despite being just 24.6 cm (9.7 in) wide with a 26.4 cm (10.4 in) VGA LCD. The keyboard is split into two roughly right triangle pieces that slide as the laptop&#x27;s lid is opened or closed. As the lid is opened both pieces slide out to the sides, followed by one piece sliding downward. The two halves mesh to form a keyboard 29.2 cm (11.5 in) wide which overhangs the sides of the laptop body. Conversely, as the lid is closed one piece slides back, then both slide inward until the keyboard can be covered by the lid. The movement of the keyboard is driven by a cam on the lid&#x27;s hinge, so the motions of the keyboard parts are always synchronized with the movement of the lid.

== Reception ==
In a 1995 review of the 701C by InfoWorld the full-sized keyboard, large matrix screen and built-in multimedia features were positively noted. The nonstandard I/O ports were seen negatively. The ThinkPad 701 has received 27 design awards, including the &quot;Good Design Award&quot; from CES Innovation and &quot;1995 Product of the year&quot; in the subnotebook category from InfoWorld. Domus noted in a 2019 article that: &quot;Even today, this portable PC amazes anyone who sees it open and close, and more than twenty years have gone by.&quot;. The 701C was the top selling laptop of 1995. Walt Mossberg considered it the most unusual and clever laptop he ever reviewed. The laptop is still popular with collectors, 26 years after its release.

According to John Karidis, the IBM ThinkPad 700 succeeded because of the large screen size and full-sized keyboard, while other companies cramped their keyboards and failed. Karidis observed that the limiting factor in the laptop size was the keyboard width and that the screen and keyboard surface were equal with different aspect ratios.

The laptop is being displayed in the design collection of the Museum of Modern Art in Manhattan, New York, Die Neue Sammlung in Munich, Germany and in the Computer History Museum. The ThinkPad 701 was briefly shown in 1995 James Bond film &quot;GoldenEye&quot;, &quot;Blood Diamond&quot; and &quot;&quot;.

== Discontinuation and later history ==
The 701 was withdrawn per December 21, 1995, which IBM announced a month before. This was due to newer laptop models containing larger screens, so the laptop could contain a full sized keyboard without a folding mechanism. Other companies were also moving to Pentium processors. The 701 series has been described as a product that had innovative features that were well received in the market, but the total package missed the competitive mark. A few months after the release of the 701, the ThinkPad 760 was released which is based on the original Intel Pentium processor.

In 2003, &quot;ZDNet&quot; reported that the IBM Design Center was experimenting with new laptop models that included a butterfly keyboard. David Hill stated that he tried to bring back the butterfly design, but was not able to do so. In 2021, Lenovo has filed a patent for a keyboard that is similar to the one used in the 701.

In 2014 it was reported by &quot;Hackaday&quot; that it was possible to desolder the original Intel DX4 and replace it with a faster Am5x86. In 2023, hacker Karl Buchka retrofitted the mainboard of the Framework Laptop into the 701. The keyboard is controlled using the QMK firmware on a Teensy.

<doc id="458006" wikidata="Q821216" url="?curid=458006" title="Exile in Guyville">
<text>Exile in Guyville is the debut album by American singer-songwriter Liz Phair, released on June 22, 1993, by Matador Records. It was recorded at Idful Music Corporation in Chicago between 1992 and 1993 and produced by Phair and Brad Wood. The album received critical acclaim and in 2020, it was ranked 56 by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; in its 500 Greatest Albums of All Time list. It was certified gold in 1998.

==Background==
In the summer of 1991, Phair wrote and recorded songs on audio cassette tapes, which she circulated in Chicago using the moniker Girly-Sound. Initially, she sent out only two tapes, one to Tae Won Yu from the band Kicking Giant, and the other to Chris Brokaw of the bands Come and Codeine. The recipients of the Girly-Sound tapes circulated copies with other early fans.

John Henderson, owner of the Chicago indie label Feel Good All Over, heard the tapes and contacted Phair. Soon she moved into his apartment and started playing her songs to him. Henderson brought in producer Brad Wood to help develop the 4-track demos into full songs. Originally, Phair&#x27;s recordings were supposed to come out on Henderson&#x27;s label. However, the whole process was made difficult by the fact that he and Phair had opposite ideas regarding what direction to take in terms of sound. Henderson preferred a stripped-down but precise sound, possibly with outside musicians, while Phair wanted a fuller sound. Phair has stated, &quot;We both wanted something for me. He was projecting onto me what he wanted my music to come out like, which was wrong. So I blew him off.&quot; Eventually, Henderson stopped showing up at the studio, which made Phair move out of his apartment and start working exclusively with Brad Wood on what would become &quot;Exile in Guyville&quot;.

Eventually, a Girly-Sound tape had made it to the head of Matador Records. Despite the outcome of the recording sessions, Henderson tipped off Brad Wood that Matador was interested in Phair. As a consequence, Phair contacted Matador in 1992, and they signed her. Gerard Cosloy, co-president of Matador, stated that &quot;We usually don&#x27;t sign people we haven&#x27;t met, or heard other records by, or seen as performers. But I had a hunch, and I called her back and said okay.&quot;

===Packaging===
Phair was also responsible for a great part of the artwork design. Originally, the album cover was largely collage based and involved &quot;a fat lady in a pool&quot;. In 2008, Phair stated it was originally &quot;an orgy of Barbies floating in a pool&quot;, a concept that Matador rejected, stating that such artwork would not sell. The final cover design is a photo of Phair topless in a photo booth, taken and cropped by Nash Kato of Urge Overkill. The interior artwork is based on that of Lopez Tejera&#x27;s 1952 album &quot;The Joys and Sorrows of Andalusia&quot;. The booklet also features a collage of several Polaroid photos of Phair, Wood, Rice (and various other people), with a paraphrase from lines from the movie &quot;Dirty Harry&quot;.

==Meaning==
The term &quot;Guyville&quot; comes from a song of the same name by Urge Overkill. Liz Phair explained the concept of the album in a &quot;Billboard&quot; article, stating that &quot;For me, Guyville is a concept that combines the smalltown mentality of a 500-person Knawbone, KY.-type town with the Wicker Park indie music scene in Chicago, plus the isolation of every place I&#x27;ve lived in, from Cincinnati to Winnetka&quot;. When asked during an interview with Noah Adams on his radio show &quot;All Things Considered&quot; about the concept, she elaborated: &quot;It was a state of mind and / or neighborhood that I was living in. Guyville, because it was definitely their sensibilities that held the aesthetic, you know what I mean? It was sort of guy things - comic books with really disfigured, screwed-up people in them, this sort of like constant love of social aberration. You know what I mean? This kind of guy mentality, you know, where men are men and women are learning.&quot; Asked about what she sees in Guyville, Phair said that &quot;All the guys have short, cropped hair, John Lennon glasses, flannel shirts, unpretentiously worn, not as a grunge statement. Work boots.&quot;

Phair has also stated that most songs on the album were not about her. She commented, &quot;That stuff didn&#x27;t happen to me, and that&#x27;s what made writing it interesting. I wasn&#x27;t connecting with my friends. I wasn&#x27;t connecting with relationships. I was in love with people who couldn&#x27;t care less about me. I was yearning to be part of a scene. I was in a posing kind of mode, yearning to have things happen for me that weren&#x27;t happening. So I wanted to make it seem real and convincing. I wrote the whole album for a couple people to see and know me.&quot;

Phair commented in interviews that the album was a song-by-song reply to the Rolling Stones&#x27; 1972 album &quot;Exile on Main St.&quot; Some critics contend that the album is not a clear or obvious song-by-song response, although Phair sequenced her compositions in an attempt to match the songlist and pacing of the Rolling Stones album.

==Reception==

&quot;Exile in Guyville&quot; received critical acclaim. It was the No. 1 album in the year-end critics poll in &quot;Spin&quot; and the &quot;Village Voice&quot; Pazz &amp; Jop critics poll.

It was also a moderate commercial success. The videos for &quot;Never Said&quot; and &quot;Stratford-On-Guy&quot; received airplay on MTV. By the spring of 1994, it had sold over 200,000 units, peaking at No. 196 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and was Matador&#x27;s most successful release at the time. In 1998, it was certified gold by the RIAA.

Phair reacted to the reception of &quot;Guyville&quot;, saying &quot;I don&#x27;t really get what happened with &quot;Guyville&quot;. It was so normal, from my side of things. It was nothing remarkable, other than the fact that I&#x27;d completed a big project, but I&#x27;d done that before... Being emotionally forthright was the most radical thing I did. And that was taken to mean something bigger in terms of women&#x27;s roles in society and women&#x27;s roles in music... I just wanted people who thought I was not worth talking to, to listen to me.&quot; The sudden success of the album also generated a somewhat negative response from Chicago&#x27;s indie music scene. Phair commented, &quot;It&#x27;s odd... &quot;Guyville&quot; was such a part of indie. But at the same time... I was kind of at war with indie when I made that record.&quot; Another problem that arose from her success was also dealing with her stage fright.

Despite this, the album inspired a number of imitators, and the lo-fi sound and emotional honesty of Phair&#x27;s lyrics were frequently cited by critics as outstanding qualities. It frequently appears on many critics&#x27; best-of lists. It was ranked 15 in &quot;Spin&quot;″s &quot;100 Greatest Albums, 1985–2005&quot;. VH1 named &quot;Exile in Guyville&quot; the 96th Greatest Album Of All-Time. The album was ranked number 56 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s 2020 reboot of their The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time list (it was ranked number 328 in the original 2003 list and number 327 in the 2012 revision). In 1999, &quot;Pitchfork&quot; rated &quot;Exile in Guyville&quot; as the fifth best album of the 1990s. However, in its 2003 revision of the list, it moved to No. 30. Robert Christgau named it among his 10 best albums from the 1990s.

In 2013, &quot;The New Yorker&quot;″s Bill Wyman dubbed it &quot;patently one of the strongest rock albums ever made&quot;, feeling that each song &quot;reverberates powerfully&quot;. He described it as &quot;arguably the quintessential example&quot; of indie rock. &quot;PopMatters&quot;″ David Chiu wrote that &quot;Exile&quot; lay bedroom pop music&#x27;s groundwork. He noted that several indie bands and musicians had gained their &quot;musical DNA&quot; from the record, such as Frankie Cosmos, Jay Som, and more.

===Accolades===
==Reissues==

=== &quot;15th Anniversary Edition&quot; (2008) ===
In 2008, Phair signed to ATO Records and released a 15th-anniversary reissue of &quot;Exile in Guyville&quot; on June 14. It includes three previously unreleased tracks (&quot;Ant in Alaska&quot;, a cover of Lynn Taitt&#x27;s &quot;Say You&quot; and an instrumental listed on the disc as &quot;Standing&quot;) and a DVD documentary.

=== &quot;Girly-Sound to Guyville&quot; (2018) ===
On May 4, 2018, Matador reissued &quot;Exile in Guyville&quot; for its 25th anniversary. The reissue consists of the original album remastered and Phair&#x27;s three Girly-Sound demo tapes, marking the first time that the full set of demo tapes had been officially released. The reissue was released in four formats: the physical LP box set, the digital deluxe edition, as well as cassette and CD pressings. Absent from the reissue are the two Girly-Sound demos &quot;Shatter&quot; and &quot;Fuck or Die&quot;, as Phair was unable to get clearance for samples used in the songs.

On June 22, 2023, Phair released an outtake from the album titled &quot;Miss Lucy&quot;. The song was intended to appear on the album; however, it was ultimately replaced with &quot;Flower&quot;.

<doc id="458007" wikidata="Q1368122" url="?curid=458007" title="Hussein Kamel al-Majid">
<text>Colonel General Hussein Kamel Hassan al-Majid () (1954 – 23 February 1996) was an Iraqi military officer and the son-in-law and first cousin once removed of former Iraqi president Saddam Hussein. He defected to Jordan and assisted United Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM) and International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspection teams assigned to look for weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. He was killed the following year for betraying Saddam.

==Early life and military career ==
Hussein was born in Tel Al Thahab (in modern-day Balad District, Saladin Governorate). He rose through the military ranks to become the Supervisor of the Republican Guard, Iraq&#x27;s elite military force, in 1982. He later became the Minister of Industries, heading the Military Industrialisation Commission and supervising Iraq&#x27;s weapons development programs from 1987. Hussein became Oil Minister of Iraq in 1990.

Hussein married one of Saddam Hussein&#x27;s daughters, Raghad Saddam, and lived in Iraq until 1995. On 7 August of that year, he and his wife defected from Iraq, along with his brother, Saddam Kamel, and his brother&#x27;s wife, Rana Saddam, another of Saddam&#x27;s daughters. In a 21 September 1995 interview with CNN, Hussein Kamel explained:

This is what made me leave the country, the fact that Saddam Hussein surrounds himself with inefficient ministers and advisers who are not chosen for their competence but according to the whims of the Iraqi president. And as a result of this the whole of Iraq is suffering.

Jordan granted asylum to the Kamel brothers, and there they began to cooperate with UNSCOM and its director Rolf Ekéus, the American CIA and the British MI6. The initial promises of a wealth of information were, allegedly, not fulfilled. According to U.S. and Jordanian officials, the intelligence provided by Hussein Kamel on Iraqi secret weapons programs was of limited content and value.

Hussein confirmed what inspectors had been able to ascertain shortly before his defection: Iraq had operated a biological warfare program prior to the Gulf War, but had destroyed its entire stockpile of chemical and biological weapons and banned missiles. Hussein&#x27;s defection presented a major problem for those seeking to overthrow the Iraqi government based on the threat of its WMD program.

==Return to Iraq and death==
In February 1996, after intermediaries for Saddam Hussein had assured them that all would be forgiven, Hussein and Saddam Kamel were convinced to return to Iraq with their wives and children. Reportedly, immediately upon their return, they were ordered to divorce their wives and were denounced as traitors. Three days after their arrival, on 23 February, they refused to surrender to Saddam&#x27;s security forces and were killed in a 13-hour firefight at a safe house.

According to an alternative version of events, Kamel and his sons were killed less than 24 hours following the divorce decrees, in a gun battle with other cousins trying to regain their clan honor in the eyes of Saddam.

Another story of the event from the documentary Saddam&#x27;s tribe, which one of its producers had an interview with Raghdad Hussein, is that her husband and his brother, along with their family, were all killed under house arrest by Ali Hassan Al-Majid (also known as &quot;Chemical Ali&quot; in the west) after he and two Iraqi soldiers gunned them down.

==Aftermath==
In a 25 January 1999 report to the U.N. Security Council, UNSCOM declared that the history of the Iraqi weapons inspections &quot;must be divided into two parts, separated by the events following the departure from Iraq, in August 1995, of Lt. Gen. Hussein Kamel.&quot;

Hussein maintained that Iraq had destroyed its weapons of mass destruction and related programs after the end of the first Gulf War.

I ordered destruction of all chemical weapons. All weapons—biological, chemical, missile, nuclear—were destroyed.

A 3 March 2003 &quot;Newsweek&quot; report said that Hussein&#x27;s revelations were &quot;hushed up&quot; because inspectors &quot;hoped to bluff Saddam [Hussein] into revealing still more.&quot; Hussein&#x27;s version of events appear to have been borne out in the wake of the 2003 Invasion of Iraq.

In the build-up to the 2003 invasion, Bush administration figures—including George W. Bush, Dick Cheney, Donald Rumsfeld and Colin Powell—repeatedly cited Hussein&#x27;s testimony as evidence that Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction.

<text>Tartrazine is a synthetic lemon yellow azo dye primarily used as a food coloring. It is also known as E number E102, C.I. 19140, FD&amp;C Yellow 5, Yellow 5 Lake, Acid Yellow 23, Food Yellow 4, and trisodium 1-(4-sulfonatophenyl)-4-(4-sulfonatophenylazo)-5-pyrazolone-3-carboxylate.

Tartrazine is a commonly used coloring agent all over the world, mainly for yellow, and can also be used with brilliant blue FCF (FD&amp;C Blue 1, E133) or green S (E142) to produce various green shades. It serves as a dye for wool and silks, a colorant in food, drugs and cosmetics and an adsorption-elution indicator for chloride estimations in biochemistry.

== History ==
Tartrazine was discovered in 1884 by Swiss chemist Johann Heinrich Ziegler, who developed the yellow azo dye in the laboratories of the Bindschedler&#x27;sche Fabrik für chemische Industrie in Basel (CIBA). This was patented and produced in Germany by BASF in 1885 (DRP 34294). The process was first presented in 1887 in &quot;Chemische Berichte&quot;, the journal of the German Chemical Society. Although the structure proposed by Ziegler was not confirmed, he was able to develop an alternative synthesis of tartrazine based on the idea that a hydrazone is the tautomeric form of an azo compound (azo-hydrazo tautomerism). This production process was patented in 1893 (British Patent 5693).

== Products containing tartrazine ==
=== Foods ===

Many foods contain tartrazine in various proportions, depending on the manufacturer or person preparing the food. When in food, tartrazine is typically labelled as &quot;color&quot;, &quot;tartrazine&quot;, or &quot;E102&quot;, depending on the jurisdiction, and the applicable labeling laws (see Regulation below).

Products containing tartrazine commonly include processed commercial foods that have an artificial yellow or green color, or that consumers expect to be brown or creamy looking. It has been frequently used in the bright yellow coloring of imitation lemon filling in baked goods. The following is a list of foods that may contain tartrazine:

* Desserts and confectionery: ice cream, ice pops and popsicles, confectionery and hard candy (such as gummy bears, marshmallows, etc.), cotton candy, instant puddings and gelatin, cake mixes, pastries, custard powder, marzipan, biscuits, and cookies.
* Beverages: soft drinks, energy and sports drinks, powdered drink mixes, fruit cordials, and flavored/mixed alcoholic beverages.
* Snacks: flavored corn chips (such as nachos, etc.), chewing gum, popcorn (both microwave and cinema-popped), and potato chips.
* Condiments and spreads: jam, jelly (including mint jelly), marmalade, mustard, horseradish, pickles (and other products containing pickles such as tartar sauce and dill pickle dip), and processed sauces.
* Other processed foods: cereal (such as corn flakes, muesli, etc.), instant or &quot;cube&quot; soups, rices (like paella, risotto, etc.), noodles, pureed fruit and pickled peppers, bright-green-colored seaweed salad.

=== Personal care and cosmetics products ===
A number of personal care and cosmetics products may contain tartrazine, usually labelled as CI 19140 or FD&amp;C Yellow 5, including:

* Liquid and bar soaps, green hand sanitizer, moisturizers and lotions, mouth washes, perfumes, toothpastes, and shampoos, conditioners and other hair products.
* Cosmetics, such as eyeshadow, blush, face powder and foundation, lipstick, etc. – even those that are primarily pink or purple. (Usually make-up manufacturers use one label for all shades in a product line, placing the phrase &quot;may contain&quot; ahead of all colors that are used in that line, not necessarily that specific shade.)
* Nail polish, nail polish remover, temporary tattoos, and tanning lotions.

=== Medications ===
Various medications include tartrazine to give a yellow, orange or green hue to a liquid, capsule, pill, lotion, or gel, primarily for easy identification. Types of pharmaceutical products that may contain tartrazine include vitamins, antacids, cold medications (including cough drops and throat lozenges), lotions and prescription drugs.

Most, if not all, medication data sheets are required to contain a list of all ingredients, including tartrazine. Some include tartrazine in the allergens alert section.

The Canadian &quot;Compendium of Pharmaceuticals and Specialties&quot; (CPS), a prescribing reference book for health professionals, mentions tartrazine as a potential allergy for each drug that contains tartrazine.

=== Other products ===
Other products, such as household cleaning products, paper plates, pet foods, crayons, inks for writing instruments, stamp dyes, face paints, envelope glues, and deodorants, may also contain tartrazine.

==Chemistry==
Tartrazine is water-soluble and has a maximum absorbance in an aqueous solution at 425 nm. It is one of the oldest known members of the pyrazolone family of dyes.

== Potential health effects on humans ==
===Food intolerance, sensitivity, and allergies===

The prevalence of tartrazine intolerance is estimated at 360,000 U.S. Citizens affected, less than 0.12% of the general population. According to the FDA, tartrazine causes hives in fewer than 1 in 10,000 people, or 0.01%.

It is not clear how many individuals are sensitive or intolerant to tartrazine, but the University of Guelph estimates that it is 1 to 10 out of every ten thousand people (0.01% to 0.1% of the population).

=== Asthma ===

Tartrazine has been suspected of exacerbating asthma, but medical evidence does not confirm this.

=== Food intolerance and ADHD-like behavior===
Tartrazine is one of various food colors said to cause food intolerance and ADHD-like behavior in children. It is possible that certain food colorings may act as a trigger in those who are genetically predisposed, but the evidence for this effect is weak.

===Reproductive===
Rumors began circulating about tartrazine in the 1990s regarding a link to its consumption (specifically its use in Mountain Dew) and alleged adverse effects on male erectile function, testicle and penis size, and sperm count. The rumors likely began as the result of an &quot;in vitro&quot; study showing an effect on estrogen receptors; however this effect was disproven in later &quot;in vivo&quot; studies. Tartrazine may have a reproductive effect at extremely high dosages, however it has no reproductive effect at the levels found in one food product.

== Regulation ==
=== North America ===
==== Canada ====
Tartrazine is listed as a permitted food coloring in Canada. The majority of pre-packaged foods are required to list all ingredients, including all food additives such as color; however section B.01.010 (3)(b) of the Regulations provide food manufacturers with the choice of declaring added color(s) by either their common name or simply as &quot;colour&quot;. 

The maximum permitted level of tartazine is 300 ppm.

==== United States ====
The United States requires the presence of tartrazine to be declared on food and drug products (21 CFR 74.1705 (revised April 2013), 21 CFR 201.20) and also color batches to be preapproved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA). As part of these regulations, the FDA requires that the Precautions section of prescription drug labels include the warning statement, &quot;This product contains FD&amp;C Yellow No. 5 (tartrazine) which may cause allergic-type reactions (including bronchial asthma) in certain susceptible persons. Although the overall incidence of FD&amp;C Yellow No. 5 (tartrazine) sensitivity in the general population is low, it is frequently seen in patients who also have aspirin hypersensitivity.&quot;

The FDA regularly seizes products if found to be containing undeclared tartrazine, declared but not FDA-tested, or labeled something other than FD&amp;C yellow 5 or Yellow 5. Such products seized often include noodles.

=== Europe ===
==== European Union ====
The European Food Safety Authority allows for tartrazine to be used in processed cheese, canned or bottled fruit or vegetables, processed fish or fishery products, and wines and wine-based drinks.

The European regulatory community, with a stronger emphasis on the precautionary principle, required labelling and temporarily reduced the acceptable daily intake (ADI) for the food colorings; the UK FSA called for voluntary withdrawal of the colorings by food manufacturers. However, in 2009 the EFSA re-evaluated the data at hand and determined that &quot;the available scientific evidence does not substantiate a link between the color additives and behavioral effects.&quot;

Tartrazine is among six artificial colors for which the European Union requires products that contain them to be marked with the statement &quot;May have an adverse effect on activity and attention in children&quot;.

==== Austria and Germany ====
Yellow tartrazine (E102) was banned in Austria and Germany, before European Parliament and Council Directive 94/36/EC lifted the ban.

==== Norway ====
Yellow tartrazine (E102) was also banned in Norway several years ago, but the ban was likewise lifted due to the implementation of EU directive 94/36/EC. (Norway is not an E.U. member state, but has signed up to follow most EU regulations via the EEA agreement.)

==== United Kingdom ====
In response to concerns about the safety of certain food additives, the UK FSA commissioned a study by researchers at Southampton University of the effect of a mixture of six food dyes (Tartrazine, Allura Red, Ponceau 4R, Quinoline Yellow WS, Sunset Yellow and Carmoisine (dubbed the &quot;Southampton 6&quot;)) and sodium benzoate (a preservative) on children in the general population, who consumed them in beverages; the study published in 2007. The study found &quot;a possible link between the consumption of these artificial colours and a sodium benzoate preservative and increased hyperactivity&quot; in the children; the advisory committee to the FSA that evaluated the study also determined that because of study limitations, the results could not be extrapolated to the general population, and further testing was recommended. 

In 2008 Scotland asked for Scottish food producers voluntarily stop using these food dyes. A 2010 study found that one third of food producers were still using at least one of the Southampton Six.

== Other uses ==
===3D printing===
Tartrazine has been used as a biocompatible photoblocker for generating transparent hydrogels with complex inner structures.

<text>Rostov Veliky (, &quot;Rostov the Great&quot;), formerly Rostov, is a town in Yaroslavl Oblast, Russia, one of the oldest in the country and a tourist center of the Golden Ring. It is located on the shores of Lake Nero, northeast of Moscow. Population: 

The name of the town was officially changed to Rostov Veliky in December 2024. The name of the town railway station is Rostov Yaroslavsky, due to its location in Yaroslavl Oblast.

==History==
Rostov was preceded by Sarskoye Gorodishche, which some scholars interpret as the capital of the Finnic Merya tribe, while others believe it was an important Viking trade enclave and fortress guarding the Volga trade route. It is known from Norse sources as or . Scythians also settled there. These different ethnicities, such as the Vikings, Scyths, Slavs and Finns, were likely the ancestors of many of today&#x27;s people in that region. First mentioned in documents in the year 862 as an already important settlement, by the 10th century Rostov became the capital city of Vladimir-Suzdal, one of the most prominent principalities in Rus&#x27;. It was incorporated into the Grand Duchy of Moscow in 1474.

After losing its independent status, Rostov was still an ecclesiastic center – from 988 it was the see of the Diocese of Yaroslavl, one of the first Russian bishoprics. In the 14th century, the bishops of Rostov became archbishops, and late in the 16th century, metropolitans. In 1608 Rostov was completely destroyed by Poles during the Polish invasion. After that metropolitan Iona (Jonah) Sysoyevich (c. 1607–1690) commissioned the town&#x27;s main landmark: the Rostov Kremlin. This is regarded by some as the finest outside that of Moscow. Late in the 18th century, the metropolitan see was transferred to Yaroslavl.

Rostov is renowned for manufacturing enamels.

On August 24, 1953, the town was hit by an F3 tornado, causing severe damage. The tornado traveled 6 kilometers with a maximum width of up to 550 meters.

==Administrative and municipal status==
Within the framework of administrative divisions, Rostov serves as the administrative center of Rostovsky District, even though it is not a part of it. As an administrative division, it is incorporated separately as the town of oblast significance of Rostov—an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the districts. As a municipal division, the town of oblast significance of Rostov is incorporated within Rostovsky Municipal District as Rostov Urban Settlement.

==Main sights==
The architecture of the city shows many examples of early Russian Orthodox architecture. The central town square of Rostov is occupied by the Assumption Cathedral. It is unknown when the present building was erected, the mid-16th century being the most likely date. Lower parts of the cathedral walls are dated to the 12th century. The ponderous bell tower was constructed mostly in the 17th century. Its bells are among the largest and most famous in Russia - each has its own name. The largest bell, cast in 1688, weighs . It is named Sysoy to honor the city&#x27;s founding father. The church is home to the incorrupt body of Saint Leontius of Rostov.

An area situated between the cathedral square and the lake was chosen by Iona Sysoevich as a place for his fairy-tale residence. All the construction works were carried out between 1667 and 1694. Major buildings include the ornate Savior Church-na-Senyakh (1675), the sombre Church of St. Gregory (1670), and the barbican churches of St. John the Apostle (1683) and of the Resurrection of Christ (1670). The residence, often erroneously called kremlin, also includes eleven ornate tower bells, numerous palaces, several small belfries, and the diminutive baroque Church of Our Lady of Smolensk (1693). All the churches are elaborately painted and decorated.

The cathedral and four tall kremlin churches with their silver &quot;blind&quot; domes were imitated throughout the city. This is particularly evident in the Savior-on-the-Market church and the cathedral church of the Nativity convent, both dating from the 17th century and situated near the kremlin walls. The oldest church within the town center was consecrated to St. Isidore the Blessed in 1565. They say that Ivan the Terrible had the architect executed, because his church was so much smaller than its predecessor.

The kremlin is flanked by two monasteries, both facing the Lake Nero. To the right from the kremlin stands the Abraham monastery, founded in the 11th century and one of the oldest in Russia. Its cathedral, commissioned by Ivan the Terrible in 1553 to commemorate the conquest of Kazan, inspired numerous churches in the region, particularly in Yaroslavl.

Spaso-Yakovlevsky Monastery, situated to the left from the Kremlin on the town&#x27;s outskirts, has been venerated as the shrine of St. Dmitry of Rostov. Most of the monastery structures were built in the late 18th and early 19th centuries in the fine neoclassical style. There are also two 17th-century churches: the Conception of St. Anna, and the Transfiguration of Our Savior. Unlike most other churches in the town, the monastery belongs to the Russian Orthodoxy and houses a theological seminary.

==Surroundings==
The vicinity of Rostov is rich in old architecture. For example, an old wooden church (1687–1689) may be seen in Ishnya. One of the best preserved monasteries in Russia, named after the saints Boris and Gleb, is situated in Borisoglebsky, about west of the town. The monastery was favored by Ivan the Terrible, who personally supervised the construction of towered walls and bell-tower around an even more ancient cathedral. The only addition made to the monastery after Ivan&#x27;s death is a barbican church, commissioned by the metropolitan Iona Sysoyevich.

<doc id="458022" wikidata="Q2095984" url="?curid=458022" title="Tampa Stadium">
<text>Tampa Stadium (nicknamed The Big Sombrero and briefly known as Houlihan&#x27;s Stadium) was a large open-air stadium (maximum capacity about 74,000) located in Tampa, Florida, which opened in 1967 and was significantly expanded in 1974–75. The facility is most closely associated with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers of the National Football League, who played there from their establishment in 1976 until 1997. It also hosted two Super Bowls, in 1984 and 1991, as well as the 1984 USFL Championship Game. To meet the revenue demands of the Buccaneers&#x27; new owners, Raymond James Stadium was built nearby in 1998, and Tampa Stadium was demolished in early 1999.

Besides the Bucs, Tampa Stadium was home to the Tampa Bay Rowdies of the original North American Soccer League, the Tampa Bay Bandits of the United States Football League, the Tampa Bay Mutiny of Major League Soccer, and the college football programs of the University of Tampa and the University of South Florida. It also hosted many large concerts, and for a time, it held the record for the largest audience to ever see a single artist when a crowd of almost 57,000 witnessed a Led Zeppelin show in the facility in 1973.

==Origin and design==

===Pre-history and construction===
The land on which Tampa Stadium was situated had been the perimeter of Drew Field, a World War II-era airfield which was the precursor to Tampa International Airport. In 1949, the city of Tampa bought a grassy parcel between the airport and West Tampa from the federal government with the idea of eventually building a community sports complex. Al Lopez Field was the first phase of the project, opening in 1955. However, further development stalled for several years after that.

Though the city of Tampa already had a long history with amateur and minor league professional sports and had undergone tremendous growth after World War 2, it did not yet have a modern football stadium as the 1960s began. The two largest extant venues were both located across the Hillsborough River from downtown: Plant Field, which had been built in the 1890s and consisted of a single grandstand and a large open field, and Phillips Field, which had been built in the 1930s as the home of the University of Tampa&#x27;s football team. Some of Tampa&#x27;s civic leaders began to discuss plans for attracting an expansion or relocated professional football franchise to the area by the early 1960s and arranged an exhibition game between the American Football League&#x27;s Buffalo Bills and New York Jets at Phillips Field on August 8, 1964. Though temporary bleachers were installed to increase capacity to 17,000, actual attendance was less than 6000. Realizing that the venue was too small and primitive to support a professional football franchise, the city decided to construct a large modern football facility which could be used by the Tampa Spartans in the short term and could be expanded to serve as the home field for an NFL or AFL franchise in the future.

Construction of Tampa Stadium began in the fall of 1966 just beyond the left field wall of Al Lopez Field, which was by then the home of the Tampa Tarpons of the Florida State League and the spring training home of the Cincinnati Reds. The plot purchased by the city in 1949 was large enough to host separate football and baseball venues, training facilities for the Reds, and several acres of parking spaces.

===Original design===
When it opened in 1967, Tampa Stadium consisted of a matching pair of large arch-shaped concrete grandstands with open endzones. The seating consisted of long, backless aluminum benches that were accessed via short tunnels (vomitoria) which connected the seating area to wide, open concourses at the rear of the grandstands. The benches were arranged in two large tiers divided by a horizontal walkway about halfway up the grandstands. The slope of the grandstands was relatively steep, giving every seat a direct and unobstructed view of the field. The official capacity was 46,481, though temporary bleachers could be placed in one or both endzones if needed.

===Expansions and renovations===

Tampa Stadium underwent an extensive expansion project in 1974–1975 after the city was awarded an NFL expansion team. Over 27,000 seats were added by completely enclosing the open end zones with seating areas that blended into the existing two-tiered grandstands and created two walkways that completely encircled the seating bowl at ground level and about 40 rows up. The finished stadium had the largest capacity in the NFL (71,908) and was not in the shape of a simple bowl. The top of the stadium was in the shape of a wave which was highest at the center of the two sideline grandstands and gently sloped downward to a rounded corner where it met the endzone sections, which were a little more than half as tall. Much later, the stadium was dubbed &quot;The Big Sombrero&quot; by ESPN&#x27;s Chris Berman for the unique undulating hat / wave shape created by the 1975 expansion.

The last major renovation took place in the early 1980s when, in preparation for its first Super Bowl in January 1984, the press box atop the west grandstand was expanded and updated and a large new suite of luxury boxes was added atop the east grandstand. This configuration gave the facility its maximum seating capacity of 74,301.

For the 1990 season which culminated in the stadium&#x27;s second Super Bowl, large flagpoles were mounted on the upper rim of the stadium as part of a stadium update that included the addition of a JumboTron screen in the south end zone and smaller scoreboards above the field-level tunnels in two corners of the stadium. The poles were used to fly large flags for each of the NFL&#x27;s teams until 1997, when the Buccaneers adopted a uniform redesign featuring a red flag on their helmets. Large versions of the flag were hoisted on the stadium&#x27;s flagpoles when the Buccaneers penetrated their opponents&#x27; 20-yard line. The franchise continued this practice when it moved to Raymond James Stadium next door a year later.

===Playing surface===
Over the lifetime of Tampa Stadium, the natural grass turf consisted of several varieties of Bermuda grass, most notably Tifway 419. The playing surface was consistently one of the best in the NFL, and was regularly named a players&#x27; favorite in surveys conducted by the National Football League Players Association.

===Heat===
Tampa Stadium was built almost exclusively of concrete. Throughout its existence, exterior walls were painted light tan or white or left as bare concrete, as were the flooring surfaces. Seating consisted of long aluminum benches, and there was no roof or overhang of any kind over the field or seating areas.

While the stadium&#x27;s minimalist design allowed for very good sight lines, it also exposed both spectators and players to the full brunt of Tampa&#x27;s subtropical climate. This was especially true after the stadium was fully enclosed for the Buccaneers&#x27; 1976 inaugural season, cutting off breezes which had flowed through the open endzones. While fans could retreat under the grandstands to the shade of the wide concourses where concessions and restrooms were located, players and personnel on the field had no such recourse. Cooling equipment was usually placed near the sideline benches. The Buccaneers were also allowed to wear their white jerseys at home, forcing their opponents to suffer in their darker (and hotter) jerseys. During the summer and early autumn, events in the stadium were often scheduled in the evening hours to avoid the often oppressive afternoon heat and humidity. In another nod to local weather, the natural grass playing surface was highly crowned to provide rapid drainage during Tampa&#x27;s intense thunderstorms, with the sidelines almost 18 inches lower than the center of the field.

==Sporting history==
===First tenants===

==== University of Tampa Spartans ====

Tampa Stadium was completed just in time to host its first sporting event – a football game between the University of Tampa Spartans and the #3 ranked University of Tennessee Volunteers on November 4, 1967. While the Spartans lost that game 38-0, they would enjoy later success in their new home, moving up to Division I football in 1971, defeating several established programs, and sending several players to the NFL, including Freddie Solomon and John Matuszak. However, university officials were unsure of continued community support after Tampa was awarded an NFL expansion franchise. &quot;Tampa U&quot; president B. D. Owens ended the football program after the 1974 season, saying that the school would face bankruptcy if it had to subsidize the sport.

==== Tampa Bay Rowdies ====

The Tampa Bay Rowdies were the stadium&#x27;s first professional tenant, starting play in 1975 and winning their only (outdoor) championship in their inaugural season. (The team also won several indoor soccer championships playing at the Bayfront Center across Tampa Bay in St. Petersburg.)

The Rowdies played their home games in Tampa Stadium every summer until the original North American Soccer League disbanded in 1984. Subsequently, the Rowdies continued on, first as an independent team, then in other leagues (ASL, APSL) and used the stadium every year through 1990. In 1991 and 1992 they moved across town to the smaller USF Soccer Stadium, before returning to Tampa Stadium in 1993 for their final season of play in the APSL.

===NFL expansion===
====Exhibition games====
After the disappointing turnout at Phillips Field for an AFL preseason game back in 1964, the city was eager to showcase its new stadium in the hopes of attracting a professional franchise and organized a dozen exhibition games in Tampa Stadium in the late 1960s and early 1970s. The first of these was a preseason game between the NFL&#x27;s Atlanta Falcons and Washington Redskins in August 1968 that almost sold out the larger venue, and preseason matchups over subsequent seasons similarly drew large and enthusiastic crowds. In 1972, the Baltimore Colts trained at Leto High School, West of Tampa, in unincorporated Hillsborough County during the preseason and played all three of their exhibition games in Tampa Stadium to large crowds.

These preseason games gave NFL owners and officials ample opportunity to assess the Tampa Bay area and the stadium, and on April 24, 1974, Tampa was awarded an NFL expansion team to begin play in the 1976.

====Tampa Bay Buccaneers====

The Buccaneers&#x27; first regular season home game was held on September 19, 1976, when the Bucs lost to the San Diego Chargers 23-0. That would become a trend, as the team began their existence with an NFL-record 26-game losing streak. They would not win a game on their home field until defeating the St. Louis Cardinals on the last game of the following season, December 18, 1977. Jubilant fans swarmed the Tampa Stadium turf and tore down the goal posts.

The Buccaneers had improved enough by the 1979 season to host the NFC Championship Game, which they lost 9-0 to the Los Angeles Rams. The Bucs played 18 additional seasons in the facility but struggled through most of them. They would only host one more playoff game on their original home turf: an NFC Wild Card Game vs. the Detroit Lions on December 28, 1997, which they won 20-10. This would be the last game the team ever played in Tampa Stadium, as they moved next door to Raymond James Stadium in 1998.

====Krewe of Honor====
In 1991, the organization initiated the &quot;Krewe of Honor&quot;, which featured a mural of the first class of three members. Quarterback Doug Williams was inducted September 6, 1992 and owner Hugh Culverhouse on September 5, 1993. No additional members were added before Tampa Stadium was closed and demolished.

====Houlihan&#x27;s Stadium====
Malcolm Glazer also acquired naming rights to Tampa Stadium when he purchased the Buccaneers in 1995. In October of that year, he had the Houlihan&#x27;s restaurant chain, another business in his portfolio, pay the Bucs $10 million for those rights. This resulted in the official name of the facility being changed to &quot;Houlihan&#x27;s Stadium&quot; in 1996 and in Glazer being sued by Houlihan&#x27;s stockholders, who were not happy about purchasing stadium naming rights in an area in which the chain had no restaurants.

===Other tenants and events===
Tampa Stadium was the home field for several additional teams and hosted a wide variety of events during its lifetime.

====Home teams====

* From 1983 to 1985, the Tampa Bay Bandits, one of the 12 original USFL franchises, were the stadium&#x27;s third professional tenant. The Bandits enjoyed strong ticket sales and fan support and were one of only two USFL teams (the Birmingham Stallions being the other) to stay in their original city and stadium and have the same head coach (former Florida Gators and Bucs quarterback Steve Spurrier) for the league&#x27;s three seasons. However. the Bandits folded along with the USFL after the 1985 season.
* The University of South Florida Bulls football team played its initial season at the stadium in 1997, becoming the stadium&#x27;s second and final collegiate tenant. The Bulls would play the final football game at the stadium on September 12, 1998, defeating Valparaiso 51-0 before moving to Raymond James Stadium for their next home game on October 3, 1998.
* Major League Soccer placed one of its original teams in Tampa in 1996. The Tampa Bay Mutiny were the stadium&#x27;s fourth and final professional tenant. The Mutiny used the stadium as their home field for their first three seasons, and moved to Raymond James Stadium in 1999. They hosted the last sporting event at the stadium on September 13, 1998, when they defeated the New York MetroStars 2-1 in front of 27,957 people.

====Sporting events====
* Tampa Stadium hosted two Super Bowls. Super Bowl XVIII in which the Los Angeles Raiders defeated the Washington Redskins 38–9, took place on January 22, 1984. Super Bowl XXV, in which the New York Giants beat the Buffalo Bills 20–19 in what was the closest Super Bowl game ever, took place on January 27, 1991. Tampa Stadium is one of seven stadiums that had hosted a Super Bowl that are no longer standing (the other six are Tulane Stadium, demolished in 1980; Stanford Stadium, in 2006; the Orange Bowl, in 2008; the Metrodome, in 2014; the Georgia Dome, in 2017, the Pontiac Silverdome, in 2018, and Jack Murphy Stadium in 2021). Subsequent Super Bowls in Tampa have been played at Raymond James Stadium.
* The NFL Pro Bowl was held at Tampa Stadium on January 29, 1978, two years before the game began a 30-year residency in Honolulu, Hawaii.
* Though the University of Florida is approximately north in Gainesville, a strong local alumni base persuaded the Florida Gators football team to schedule nine regular season games in Tampa Stadium between 1968 and 1989. However, the Gators have not played a regular season contest in Tampa since a 1990 expansion made Florida Field the largest football facility in the state.
* In 1978 and 1979, the stadium hosted the Can-Am Bowl, which was a college all-star game pitting seniors from the United States against seniors from Canada. The contest used the rules of Canadian football, which required that the playing field be enlarged to the specifications of the Canadian game.
* From 1978 to 1996, Tampa Stadium hosted the Florida Classic rivalry game between the Bethune–Cookman University Wildcats and the Florida A&amp;M Rattlers, two in-state historically black colleges that play in the NCAA&#x27;s Football Championship Subdivision.
* On July 15, 1984, Tampa Stadium hosted the 2nd USFL Championship Game between the Philadelphia Stars and the Arizona Wranglers.
* From 1986 to 1998, college football&#x27;s Outback Bowl (previously held in Birmingham, Alabama as the Hall of Fame Bowl) was played in Tampa Stadium on New Year&#x27;s Day. The 1999 Outback Bowl and all subsequent editions have been played at Raymond James Stadium.
* Tampa Stadium hosted the USHRA monster truck rally Monster Jam in late January or early February (after football season, when turf damage wouldn&#x27;t matter) for many years. Its replacement venue, Raymond James Stadium continues to host Monster Jam in Tampa to this day.
* Beginning in 1971, Tampa Stadium served as host for the American Invitational show jumping competition each spring, which brought together the USEF&#x27;s top 30 ranked equestrians to compete for the sport&#x27;s largest purse. The event is now held in Raymond James Stadium.

====Concerts====
The stadium hosted concerts by many famous artists, including Deep Purple, The Who, Jethro Tull, Santana, Paul McCartney, David Bowie, U2, The Rolling Stones, Jimmy Buffett, The Eagles, Whitney Houston, Jonathan Butler, Genesis, Kenny G, George Michael, Pink Floyd, the Grateful Dead, and several big acts at the same time during the 1988 Monsters of Rock Tour, among others.

Two particularly memorable concerts were held there by the English rock band Led Zeppelin. On May 5, 1973, the band attracted 56,800 people, which at the time represented the largest audience for a single artist performance in history, breaking the record set by The Beatles at Shea Stadium in 1965. On June 3, 1977, the band returned to the venue, but the concert was paused and ultimately cut short due to a large thunderstorm. The crowd became unruly after the announcement of the cancellation, and the Tampa police ultimately dispersed the &quot;riot&quot; using tear gas and billy clubs. Much criticism was leveled at both the concert organizers&#x27; decision to cancel the performance and the aggressive tactics of law enforcement, resulting in a year-long pause of concerts at Tampa Stadium until security protocols were revised and shows were allowed to resume.

====Special events====
In March 1979, evangelist Billy Graham held a &quot;Florida West Coast Crusade&quot; at Tampa Stadium and drew a combined crowd of about 175,000 over five consecutive days.
==Demolition==

Immediately upon buying the Buccaneers in 1995, new owner Malcolm Glazer declared that Tampa Stadium was inadequate and threatened to move the franchise to another city unless a new stadium was built at taxpayers&#x27; expense. To accommodate these demands, Hillsborough County raised local sales taxes and built Raymond James Stadium just south of Tampa Stadium in 1997–98.

Demolition of Tampa Stadium proceeded soon after the Tampa Bay Mutiny&#x27;s final home game on September 13, 1998. Wrecking balls and long reach excavators were used for much of the process, and the last portion of the stadium (the east side luxury boxes built for the stadium&#x27;s first Super Bowl), was imploded on April 11, 1999. Tampa Stadium&#x27;s former site is now a parking and staging area for Raymond James Stadium, and its footprint can still be seen in a grassy area inside a roughly circular road that once ringed its perimeter.

<doc id="458025" wikidata="Q2303748" url="?curid=458025" title="The Master of Go">
<text>is a novel by the Nobel Prize winning Japanese author Yasunari Kawabata. First published in serial form in 1951, Kawabata considered it his finest work. Sharply distinct from the rest of his literary output, &quot;The Master of Go&quot; is the only one of Kawabata&#x27;s novels that the author considered to be finished.

==Plot==
The story itself is a semi-fictionalized account of a lengthy 1938 Go game between the respected master Honinbo Shūsai and the up-and-coming player Minoru Kitani (known as Otaké in the book). The match took almost six months to complete, and was the last of Shūsai&#x27;s career. In the novel, the game, as actually played in real life, lasts 237 moves, and is documented in the book by means of diagrams. Otaké (as his historical counterpart Kitani) wins by 5 points with the Black stones. Kawabata had reported on the match for the Mainichi newspaper chain, and some sections of the book are reworked versions of his original newspaper columns.

The novel follows the progress of the game as it moves from location to location, placing particular emphasis on the time between each player&#x27;s moves (often a matter of days). As Meijin, Shūsai is entitled to certain deference which he does not always receive. Thus the players regularly come into conflict with one another about the ritual and ceremonial aspect of the game. Finally, Shūsai dies from an illness, mirroring the death of the historical Shūsai just over a year after the end of his match.

==Themes==
Throughout the novel, Kawabata incorporates several themes. The novel&#x27;s central aspect, a struggle between an older player whose powers are fading and his younger challenger, is a common motif representing the cycle of life and conflict between generations. Kawabata suggests that part of the tension comes from the divide between old traditions and new pragmatism — for example, commenting on the rigid rules governing the contest, the author writes:

:&quot;From the way of Go, the beauty of Japan and the Orient had fled. Everything had become science and regulation.&quot;

Kawabata is often more interested in the internal conflict of the players than the conflicts between them: the book vividly describes the exhausting internal struggles of Shūsai and Otaké under the pressure of the game and their lives outside it. 

Finally, as a retelling of a climactic struggle, translator Edward Seidensticker considers the work a symbolic parallel to the defeat of Japan in World War II, an event which affected Kawabata deeply. Kawabata began work on the book during the war, but did not complete it until well after the end of it.

==Publication==
The book was translated into English () in 1972 by Seidensticker. His translation was based on a later revision of the work by Kawabata, which shortened the novel somewhat compared to the original Japanese book version. The book has been translated into more than a dozen other languages.

== Legacy ==
The book remains one of the most popular and critically successful of Kawabata&#x27;s novels. The novel has also served to increase the popularity of Go in the West, providing a description of the game which does not require already knowing the rules. The work has been used by Western Go players as a starting point to explore the place of Go in Japanese society, and the book is commonly recommended to younger players.

<doc id="458026" wikidata="Q1140884" url="?curid=458026" title="Great Seal of California">
<text>The Great Seal of the State of California was adopted at the California state Constitutional Convention of 1849 and has undergone minor design changes since then, the last being the standardization of the seal in 1937. The seal shows Athena in Greek mythology (alternately Minerva in Roman mythology), the goddess of wisdom and war, because she was born an adult, and California was never a territory; a California grizzly bear, the official state animal, feeding on grape vines, representing California&#x27;s wine production; a sheaf of grain, representing agriculture; a miner, representing the California Gold Rush and the mining industry; and sailing ships, representing the state&#x27;s economic power. The word &quot;Eureka&quot; ( in Greek), meaning &quot;I have found it&quot;, is the California state motto.

The original design of the seal was by U.S. Army major Robert S. Garnett and engraved by Albert Kuner. However, because of the friction then in existence between the military and civil authorities, Garnett was unwilling to introduce the design to the constitutional convention, so convention clerk Caleb Lyon introduced it as his own design, with Garnett&#x27;s approval. Garnett later became the first general to be killed in the Civil War, where he served as a Confederate.

==Overview ==

=== Legal definition ===
The legal definition of the Great Seal of the State of California is found in the California Government Code, Sections 399–405.

===Original 1849 description===


===The geography of the Seal===
Although the waters were described in 1849 as being &quot;of the Sacramento&quot; and the mountains in the background as being &quot;the snow-clad peaks of the Sierra Nevada&quot;, other, very early descriptions referred to the body of water as San Francisco Bay. In a letter to Lyon dated two days before the seal was approved by the convention, Garnett described the landscape as a &quot;view of the Bay of San Francisco and its vessels&quot;, and in 1899, Garnett&#x27;s brother referred to the mountain as Mount Diablo, supports Robert&#x27;s view, if Minerva is placed in San Francisco and &#x27;up&#x27; is toward the east.

In 1928, due to the number of incorrect details that had appeared in the seal over the years, with the earliest being pointed out as in 1914), state printer Carroll H. Smith was authorized to prepare a new and correct seal. This seal was drawn by Los Angeles heraldic artist Marc J. Rowe who, among other corrections, narrowed the growing break in the mountains so that it appeared to be the Sacramento River, &quot;fringed by snow-capped Sierra, and not an arm of San Francisco Bay, as the old seal made it appear&quot;. San Franciscans considered this change to be &quot;a slight on their city in favor of Los Angeles&quot;. His design was not adopted as the official seal, although it was used by the State Printing Office. Nine years later, the 1937 standardized seal once again featured a widened gap of Golden Gate proportions, although it did keep Rowe&#x27;s snow-capped Sierra Nevada that had replaced the barren foothills of previous editions of the seal. Both features have stayed in the official seal.

The 1937 standardization came about when state employees, wishing to print the seal on blotters for the State Fair, could not find any official design of the seal. This prompted a new law (Statutes of California, 1937, chapter 380), which &quot;established for the first time a definite pictured design with which the master die was &#x27;substantially&#x27; to conform, and at the same time established the legality of all previous seals which were essentially the same as this one.&quot;

The full color version, accepted as official, was created in 1978 by Jane Van Doren, Graphic Artist for the California State Printing Office (now the California Office of State Publishing). The location of the original painting is unknown.

==Popular Beliefs and Urban Legends==

===Depiction of Fort Point===
In the 1937 standardized seal there is a building on the far left rear hill that has been interpreted in a variety of ways. The building, along with the break in the mountains, may have been added to give San Francisco Bay a stronger claim on its location being the landscape portrayed in the seal. This building first appeared in unofficial versions of the seal as early as 1875, and in most of these, the building was clearly meant to represent Fort Point in San Francisco.

Interpretations as Fort Point
However, the structure was given an apparent dome in the 1895 edition of the &quot;California Blue Book&quot;, and it was in this configuration that the building appeared in the 1937 standardization of the official seal. Fort Point has no dome, and it is unknown what building the 1895 artist was attempting to portray. Two years later, Harold F. Wilson, in his interpretation created for the old State Building in Los Angeles (now located inside the Ronald Reagan State Building in that city), retained the dome. In 1952, the structure, again with dome, was cast in bronze in the large seal at the west steps of the California State Capitol in Sacramento.

Versions of the Building with a Dome
There is a widespread rumor that the building in the seal found in front of the State Capitol had never appeared in any previous incarnation of the seal, and was meant to represent the chapel at San Quentin State Prison. The rumor states it was added as a &quot;signature&quot; of the prison inmates who cast it, as their alleged request to add their actual signatures was supposedly refused. The unsanctioned addition, so the story goes, was not noticed until it was too late to do anything about it, and so was left as is. Although this 3,400 pound, nearly ten foot wide seal was created in the foundry at San Quentin, the building depicted is not the chapel. If the building is taken as San Quentin and if the break in the mountains is taken to be the Golden Gate, then the view must be of the San Francisco Bay Area, looking from east to west. That would the building on the wrong side of the Gate to be San Quentin. No building in this form, including the chapel, has ever existed at San Quentin. The building first appeared in artistic renditions of the seal as early as 1875, decades before this seal was cast in 1952, and was officially added in 1937. The configuration of the building on this seal is very similar to its appearance in the 1937 standardization, which itself was based on the 1895 &quot;Blue Book&quot; rendition. Four detailed, post-1952 accounts of the seal make no mention of the rumor. One of those, a 1959 newspaper article written more than seven years after the placement of the seal, reported that &quot;[t]he only criticism of the convicts&#x27; rendition of the seal is that they made the nose of [Minerva] too straight&quot; and that the work &quot;turned out so well it was planned to have the governor, Earl Warren, write the convicts commendations.&quot;

The source of this story is unknown, although it is possibly related to the large seal attached to the Resources Building in downtown Sacramento, placed in 1964, four years before the earliest known reference to the rumor in 1968. This seal features what appears to be two structures combined into one. The right half somewhat resembles the front gates of San Quentin State Prison has been said to resemble Folsom State Prison&#x27;s Greystone Chapel. It is unknown why the artist chose this depiction. If the artist did mean for the building to be San Quentin and Folsom prisons, the rumor being mistakenly attached to the seal in front of the Capitol may have stemmed from a confusion of the two seals, which are blocks away from each other. A postcard dated 2000 shows an image of the State Capitol at night, with an inset image of the seal. The seal used is the one on the Resources Building. The official color scheme for the seal (e.g., &quot;the spear of Minerva shall be Oakwood, Cable No. 70094 and the tip white&quot;), passed in 1967—thirty years after the structure was officially added—does not mention the building.

Other interpretations of the building
Because there is no official designation of the identity of the building, artists have interpreted the building in a number of ways.

=== Conflation with County Seal===

Another rumor associated with the Great Seal of the State of California is that it once featured a cross which had since been removed. The source of this story is most likely a confusion of the state seal and its supposed chapel with the Seal of Los Angeles County and its crossless view of Mission San Gabriel Arcángel. This county seal did include a cross from its creation in 1957 until 2004, when a threatened lawsuit by the American Civil Liberties Union encouraged the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors to remove the cross and make other design changes to the seal. (A similar lawsuit earlier in the year led to the removal of a cross from the seal of the city of Redlands.) The mistaken idea that there had once been a cross on the state seal itself quickly spread, appearing as near to Los Angeles as Long Beach and as far away as New Hampshire before the county seal had been officially changed.

===The steam vessel===
The real-life identity of the steam vessel, whether actual or not, shown at the far left of the seal is a subject of debate and other urban legends.

In 2004, the California State Legislature passed Assembly Concurrent Resolution 131, authored by Dave Cox. ACR 131 renamed part of U.S. Route 50 in Sacramento County in honor of multiethnic California pioneer William Alexander Leidesdorff Jr. It read, in part: &quot;WHEREAS, In 1847, William Alexander Leidesdorff, Jr. captained the first and only steamship in California prior to the Gold Rush of 1848, the &quot;Sitka&quot;. His maiden steam voyage up the Sacramento River is immortalized on the California State Seal and recognizes his vision for increased maritime transportation of California&#x27;s agricultural products to world markets.&quot; A vessel of thirty-seven feet length, nine feet breadth of beam, and eighteen inch draw, for her trial voyage on San Francisco Bay a very large passenger was repeatedly warned not to stir from his &quot;post of honor immediately over the boiler,&quot; and on her only voyage to Sacramento in November/December 1847 it was reported that the baby of one of her passengers needed to be passed around to keep the &quot;crank&quot; vessel trim. Her career as a steam vessel was short-lived, as she sank at anchorage in February of the next year during a gale in San Francisco. &quot;Thus perished the first steamer on the Bay, a mere toy, and a most dangerous one too,&quot; reported San Francisco&#x27;s &quot;Californian&quot;, &quot;Should she be resuscitated by the owner we sincerely hope that none of our citizens will trust themselves with a passage in her beyond the &#x27;flat&#x27; that she now rests upon.&quot; The pioneering and enterprising Leidesdorff did indeed have her raised and refitted as a schooner, the &quot;Rainbow&quot;, and she continued to run on the Sacramento River after the discovery of gold.

In his 2001 book, &quot;Maritime Tragedies on the Santa Barbara Channel&quot;, Justin Ruhge suggested that, &quot;When Major Garnett laid out the seal, he included a number of sailing ships and on the middle left side of the seal he also drew in a steam bark. It is likely that this is the U.S.S. &quot;Edith&quot;. The ship in the drawing is a steamer without side wheels. At that time only the U.S.S. &quot;Edith&quot; was such a ship. The only other steamer on the west coast at that time was the much larger steamer &quot;California&quot; that was driven by side wheels.&quot; The USS &quot;Edith&quot;, a screw steamer, was sent from San Francisco Bay to Santa Barbara and San Diego in August 1849 to pick up the delegates for the upcoming constitutional convention. On the second day out, the &quot;Edith&quot; ran aground in a heavy fog at about 10 p.m. south of Point Sal, at the north end of what would become Vandenberg Air Force Base. There was no loss of life and the captain and crew were later exonerated by a Court of Inquiry, but the ship and her cargo had to be abandoned. Garnett, a passenger, was left in charge of the salvage efforts. Sam Pollard reported that &quot;a few days after the wreck [Garnett] came to San Luis Obispo and was my guest for two weeks ... and showed me the work he was doing on [the State Seal] in my store at San Luis Obispo.&quot; Leidesdorff&#x27;s &quot;Sitka&quot; was a sidewheeler as well.

===The number of stars===
Seals found in government buildings have been known to contain errors: a thirty-eight star seal was on display at the San Diego County courthouse from 1889 until its demolition in 1959—seventy years—and the seal sculpted into the tympanum of the 1928 Stanley Mosk Library and Courts I building in Sacramento, where the Supreme Court of California sits while in the capital, shows twenty-one stars. Within the California State Capitol itself, the seals carved into the secretary&#x27;s desk on the Senate floor and the clerk&#x27;s desk on the Assembly floor, both in use since 1870, contain only thirteen stars. Twenty-nine star seals are attached to the B. F. Sisk Courthouse in Fresno, the Senator Alfred E. Alquist State Building in San Jose, the Justice Joseph A. Rattigan State Building in Santa Rosa, and the Van Nuys State Office Building in Van Nuys.

An incorrect number of stars had been a widespread problem for some time; &quot;Numerous reproductions of the seal are found in well-known books and other widely circulated printed matter which show thirty-two stars instead of thirty-one&quot;, wrote the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; in 1937. In 1914, seals were found to have as few as eleven, and as many as thirty-eight, stars. A version of the seal showing thirty-eight stars appeared on the title page of the 1887, 1889, 1893, 1895 (the 1895 edition also showed a thirty-two star on page 299), and 1899 editions of the &quot;California Blue Book&quot;, a publication of the Office of the Secretary of State, who is the custodian of the Great Seal. No seal appeared on the title page of the 1903 or 1907 editions. A thirty-one star seal was used in the 1909 edition, but the publication went back to thirty-eight stars in 1911 and 1915, then settled on thirty-one in 1924.

One notable occurrence of a seal with an incorrect number of stars being shown occurred in 2011, when live television coverage of the Conrad Murray trial went to break. A seal, most likely located in the courthouse where the trial took place, was shown, and it was soon discovered that this seal had thirty-two stars instead of the proper thirty-one. This error was interpreted by some as an intentional clue that the trial was a hoax, Michael Jackson was still alive, and had faked his own death.

Various numbers of stars on various seals
==Controversies and other issues==

===Vallejo&#x27;s, Lyon&#x27;s, and Garnett&#x27;s roles in the creation of the Seal===
During the 1849 Constitutional Convention debate on the design of the seal, the bear was added to satisfy Major J.R. Snyder and the men of the Bear Flag Revolt. This addition was objected to by native Californio Mariano Guadalupe Vallejo, former head of the Mexican military in California, but a friend of the United States. He introduced an amendment to remove the bear, or, if it were to remain, that it be held fast by a vaquero&#x27;s lasso. The amendment failed.

In February 1850, the &quot;Daily Alta California&quot; of San Francisco accused Lyon of taking the $1000 appropriated to him by the convention for the purpose of securing a die and press, but giving a marred design, a die sunk too shallow, and an insufficiently powerful press for the job in return. The editorial continued that Lyon &quot;received his money out of the civil fund, and is now conveying it to the sylvan retreats of Lyonsdale&quot; and quite vehemently stated that Lyon had &quot;no right or title to the honor of either designing or executing the seal any more than the Kha[n] of Tartary&quot; while still protecting the anonymity of Garnett. However, the fact that Garnett was chiefly responsible for the design was known by at least one observer of the convention at the time and generally known no later than December 1849.

Controversy arose again in 1899 with an article in the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; that claimed that Garnett&#x27;s design was not original, but in fact based upon the seal of the Independent Order of Odd Fellows&#x27; California Lodge No. 1, with a few changes. This article was soon followed by a defense of the originality of the design written by Major Garnett&#x27;s brother, Louis A. Garnett, who claimed that the timing of the creation of and differences between the two seals made it impossible for the state seal to have been based on the lodge seal. Despite this, the Grand Lodge of California continues to make this claim, and an I.O.O.F. historian has suggested that perhaps Garnett in fact designed both seals.

===Contention within the state government over the use and design of the Seal===
In 1855, conflict arose over the seal between Governor John Bigler and the Secretary of State James W. Denver. Denver, who had been elected to the United States Congress (and in whose honor the city of Denver, Colorado, was named), left for Washington, D.C., on October 5, but his resignation was not effective until November 5. Bigler asked for an immediate resignation and threatened to declare the office vacant and appoint a new Secretary of State if this request was refused. In the same letter, he also requested that the Great Seal be kept in the Governor&#x27;s Office. Denver refused the request, as it would be impossible for him to fulfill his duties without it, and cited the fact that the seal had always been kept in the possession of the Secretary of State. On October 6, Bigler appointed his private secretary, C.H. Hempstead, to the office, and, accompanied by two witnesses, went to the office of the Secretary of State to have the appointment certified. Denver&#x27;s deputy refused to certify, as he argued that the office would not be vacated until November 5, the effective date of Denver&#x27;s resignation. It was not until that date that Hempstead&#x27;s appointment was finally certified.

In 1958, a disagreement arose between Secretary of State Frank M. Jordan and State Architect Anson Boyd over the design of the seal being used on state buildings in Sacramento. One seal showed the Golden Gate Bridge crossing over the gap in the mountains, and another spelled &quot;Eureka&quot; in Greek letters. Assistant State Architect P.T. Poage explained that the Division of Architecture &quot;had considered making a model of the seal&quot; in order to &quot;keep the architects from making improvements.&quot; Jordan responded by promising to &quot;sponsor legislation in 1959 to provide greater protection on use of the seal.&quot;

===Symbols in the Seal and the Seal as a symbol===

A few days after the Symbionese Liberation Army&#x27;s Hibernia Bank robbery in San Francisco of April 15, 1974, an Associated Press wire photo and caption of the bronze seal on the west steps of the State Capitol showed a detail of Minerva&#x27;s shield. On the shield appeared the head of Medusa, with seven snakes for hair. The seven-headed cobra, the caption pointed out, was the symbol of the SLA. In 1994, after seeing Minerva and Medusa on the bronze seal at the west steps of the State Capitol, Pastor Margo Brown called it &quot;an affront to women and Christian faith.&quot; &quot;I was shocked and amazed to see a woman [Minerva] in a man&#x27;s uniform,&quot; the &quot;Sacramento Bee&quot; reported her saying, &quot;And there was a picture of Medusa with snakes on her head. I&#x27;m very proud of my gender and women need to be portrayed in a better light.&quot; She led a crusade at the Capitol to call for a redesign of the seal, but the seal remains unchanged.

Other protests on the Capitol steps have used the seal as a rallying point: in 1960, a group picketing the execution of Caryl Chessman gathered around the seal and said, &quot;blame our leaders,&quot; in 1967 signs reading &quot;I Protest&quot; and &quot;Thou Shalt Not Kill&quot; were left on the seal to protest the execution of Aaron Mitchell, later that year a black casket representing &quot;the living dead farm worker&quot; was the centerpiece of a &quot;funeral&quot; march and placed atop the seal for an all-night vigil, and in 1990 the seal was marked with handprints of red paint by members of ACT UP, protesting possible state health care cuts.

===Errors in the Seal===
An early 1900s envelope, reportedly sent by the state to a newspaper editor, bore a copy of the seal missing the bear.

In 1982, after a year-long probe, a $300,000-plus counterfeiting ring was busted in Los Angeles by Department of Motor Vehicles agents. The counterfeiters had been producing false pink slips and other identity papers using a fraudulent seal. The mistake the counterfeiters made that first tipped off investigators was the misspelling of &quot;Seal&quot; as &quot;Seat.&quot; The possibility of the use of fraudulent seals for unscrupulous gain had been discussed in the press as early as 1878.

This was followed in 1988 by the discovery that on a number of documents printed by the state printing office, Minerva&#x27;s face had taken on the look of Snoopy, the beagle of &quot;Peanuts&quot; cartoon fame. The error was first discovered in the Department of Corrections newsletter, printed by prison labor, and so it was first suspected to be a prank by the inmates. It was later revealed that the source of the error was a worn printing plate, and so was not intentional.

While most errors on the seal are unintentional, at least one was done &quot;on porpoise&quot;: the staff of Assemblyman Jerry Lewis once ordered a birthday cake for their boss with a California seal on it, but it was &quot;the kind that has flippers, swims in the ocean and eats fish.&quot;

==Examples of the Seal==

===Sacramento===
The seal can be seen in its various incarnations near the entrances of a number of state buildings in downtown Sacramento, including the State Capitol (as well as several inside of the Capitol, including an 1854 carving and a 1908 stained glass &quot;sky&quot; light), Stanley Mosk Library and Courts I (within the tympanum at 914 Capitol Mall), Department of Rehabilitation (721 Capitol Mall, not to be confused the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation), State Personnel Board (801 Capitol Mall), Employment Development Department (722/800 Capitol Mall), Resources Agency (1416 Ninth Street), Secretary of State (1500 Eleventh Street), CalTrans (1121 O Street), Office of the State Fire Marshal (1131 S Street), and the Department of Motor Vehicles (2415 First Avenue). A hand-painted seal which used to be on display at the old Oakland State Building (1111 Jackson Street) until its closure following the Loma Prieta earthquake of 1989 can today be seen just within the front entrance of the state building at 1304 O Street, Sacramento. In West Sacramento, on the opposite shore of the Sacramento River from Old Sacramento, near the entrance to the headquarters of the California Department of General Services in the distinctive Ziggurat building, is another seal. Near the base of the James W. Marshall monument at Marshall Gold Discovery State Historic Park in nearby Coloma, can be found an artistic rendition of the seal from 1890.

===San Francisco Bay Area===
It can also be seen in mosaic on the second floor of San Francisco&#x27;s Ferry Building, which opened in 1898. Three unusual seals can be seen at the San Francisco Civic Center. The 1894 James Lick Pioneer Monument features a seal where Minerva and the bear have &quot;escaped&quot; the seal and are sculpted in the round, leaving the remaining elements on Minerva&#x27;s shield in the space normally occupied only by the face of Medusa. So large that it was shipped via oyster shell barge from the artists&#x27; studio (a dairy barn) in Petaluma, a 1500-pound fiberglass seal hangs above the entrance to the California Public Utilities Commission building. A bright golden seal is on display in the auditorium of the Hiram Johnson State Building. There are two more, less spectacularly colored seals at the north and south entrances to that building. Joined by the seals of other western states, the seal of California hangs above one of the elevators in the lobby of the Hearst Building at Third and Market streets. A seal can also be found at Metropolitan Barber Shop, at 1018 Bush Street.

Around the Bay Area, other seals can be found at the Native Sons of the Golden West Parlor No. 62 in Napa (a six-foot wide stained glass), the historic plaza in Sonoma on the 1846 Bear Flag Revolt monument (1914), the Elihu M Harris State Office Building in Oakland, the San Mateo County History Museum in Redwood City (a mosaic dating to 1910), the Circle of Palms Plaza in San Jose, the site of California&#x27;s first state capitol, and in front of Colton Hall in Monterey, the site of the 1849 Constitutional Convention. Nearby is a 1957 monument to Robert S. Garnett which includes the seal.

===Southern California===
A large bronze seal, installed in 1939, was for many years located in front of the First Street entrance to the old State Building in Los Angeles until the structure was torn down in the 1970s. The seal in the atrium of the Ronald Reagan State Building in Los Angeles is most likely this seal. Also in downtown Los Angeles, at the Los Angeles County Law Library, a large Seal of California is joined by others representing the various court districts of the area. At the 1934 California State Fair, Los Angeles-based Helms Bakery won the gold medal for the best loaf of bread, topping 471 other entries. Large reproductions of this medal, showing the seal on one side, can be seen on the exterior of all three former locations in Culver City, Montebello, and San Bernardino. As part of his 1932 mural on the ceiling of the Fluor Gallery of the Bowers Museum in Santa Ana, artist Martin Syvertsen included a seal. Another seal is attached to the Family Law Court in Riverside.

Above the bench in Courtroom #1 of the San Diego Superior Court hangs a stained glass seal. This was one of forty-two state seals created in 1889 (one for each state then in the Union) by artist John Mallon for the courthouse at the time and saved from oblivion in 1978 by civic-minded San Diegans (the courthouse had been torn down in 1959, and the seals placed in storage). Not far from the Superior Court, just outside the entrance doors to the old central library location at 850 E Street, is another seal. Constructed as part of the Panama–California Exposition, held in San Diego&#x27;s Balboa Park from 1915 to 1917, the California Building features a stylized seal. A more standardized seal appears nearby, above the entrance to the San Diego Museum of Art. To celebrate the 1935–1936 California Pacific International Exposition, also held in Balboa Park, the United States Mint issued a commemorative half-dollar piece featuring a modified seal on the obverse. In 1907, the Native Daughters of the Golden West presented a large tablet to the officers and crew of the armored cruiser USS &quot;California&quot; (ACR-6). Both the commemorative coin and the tablet were designed by sculptor Robert Ingersoll Aitken, thus explaining the similarities among the two.

===Outside of California===
Artistic renditions of the seals of the seven states of the Colorado River basin are included in the Oskar J.W. Hansen-designed dedication plaza at Hoover Dam. California&#x27;s is in the center, directly below a large American bald eagle, and is the only seal with supporters: two California grizzly bears.

The historic Decatur House in Washington, D.C., once owned by prominent Californian Edward Fitzgerald Beale, features a seal, installed by Beale soon after he bought the house in 1871, made of twenty-two woods native to California. Although now in the collection of the California State Archives in Sacramento, an 1857 stained glass version of the seal, along with the seals of the several states, hung in an enormous iron skylight once located in the ceiling of the United States House of Representatives until a U.S. Capitol renovation in 1949. A similar collection of state seals, created by artist Herman T. Schladermundt in 1897, is on display in the main reading room of the Thomas Jefferson Building of the Library of Congress.

Along the north wall of the Memorial Building at the World War II Cambridge American Cemetery and Memorial, near Cambridge, England, are stained glass renditions of the state seals, including California&#x27;s. A similar collection of seals is carved into the limestone floors of the temple area at the Manila American Cemetery and Memorial in the Philippines, established in 1948.

==Other uses of the Seal==
In 1862, the California Legislature created the California State Normal School (now San Jose State University), and bestowed its Great Seal upon the school. Although the university&#x27;s version of the Seal still graces its Tower Hall and several other buildings on the San Jose State campus, its fate as the school&#x27;s official Seal is unclear. In recent years the school has also used a different seal depicting its Tower Hall building. The city of Eureka, California, uses the same seal, being the only U.S. location to use the state seal as its seal. The city&#x27;s name identically matches California&#x27;s motto. Minerva and the bear appear on the seal of the city of Long Beach. The seal of the County of Alpine is nearly an exact copy of the state seal, but with most of the elements reversed, as if reflected in a mirror. The Governor&#x27;s Flag features a modified seal at its center. The California Highway Patrol uses a modified state seal on its patch, replacing the wheat and grape vine with a cactus and adding a setting sun, and a seal as part of its shield that is nearly identical to the actual seal. Most state law enforcement agencies, along with many local and county agencies, display the state seal on their badges.

Because it is a misdemeanor to use any representation or facsimile of the Great Seal of the State of California for commercial purposes, Hollywood productions will often use a modified seal. A fictionalized version of the seal, missing the words &quot;California&quot; and &quot;Eureka&quot;, appeared on officers&#x27; shoulder patches used for the television series &quot;Highway Patrol&quot;, which, although filmed in southern California, was set in an unnamed western state. Another made-for-television seal, missing the bear and several ships, and with a wandering island, was used for an episode of the CBS series &quot;The Mentalist&quot;/ Above Judge Wright&#x27;s head in the NBC comedy &quot;Bad Judge&quot; hung an altered seal, missing the ships and a good number of stars. During Mr. Peanutbutter&#x27;s gubernatorial run on the Netflix series &quot;BoJack Horseman&quot;, a seal with an actual seal in place of Minerva was shown. In the 2016 FX production &quot;The People v. O. J. Simpson: American Crime Story&quot;, a twenty-seven star seal hung above the head of Judge Lance Ito.

In 1969, the appearance of the seal on state-owned cars parked in unexpected places was used by concerned Californians to identify public vehicles, financed by taxpayers, being used for non-official duties. Observed examples included a vehicle parked at a Lake Tahoe casino and &quot;a man, woman, and several children piling out of a state owned car and into a movie theatre at 3 p.m.&quot;

As the &quot;signature&quot; of California, the seal has also been used for less-than-solemn purposes, including poking fun at the state&#x27;s problems. In 1967, soon after Ronald Reagan&#x27;s inauguration as governor, the &quot;Sacramento Bee&quot; ran an editorial cartoon showing an overweight Minerva and bear, representing bloated state government, doing toe-touching exercises as Reagan, dressed as an athletics coach, calls out, &quot;Squeeze, Cut, Trim – Squeeze, Cut, Trim.&quot; In 2001, the &quot;Oakland Tribune&quot; printed a letter to the editor with a light-hearted suggestion of new imagery for the seal. The writer proposed replacing the sailing ships with Japanese car carriers, the wheat and grape vine with Central Valley subdivisions, obscuring the Sierra Nevada with smog, and giving California a new motto more appropriate for the time: &quot;I have lost it.&quot; Ross Mayfield, political cartoonist of the &quot;Santa Maria Sun&quot;, lampooned California&#x27;s economic situation with his &quot;The New State Seal for the Great Bankrupt State of California&quot; cartoon, which portrayed a worried Minerva holding signs that read &quot;Send Money&quot; and &quot;Need Cash,&quot; the miner in his (literal and figurative) hole with a &quot;We&#x27;re In Too Deep&quot; sign, and the ships flying &quot;Bail Us Out&quot; and &quot;We&#x27;re Sinking&quot; banners. A version of the seal with Conan the Barbarian in the place of Minerva and California spelled phonetically as &#x27;Kahlifoania&#x27; made the rounds soon after Austrian-born Arnold Schwarzenegger was elected governor in 2003.

<text>The Barmen Declaration or the Theological Declaration of Barmen 1934 (German: &quot;Die Barmer Theologische Erklärung&quot;) was a document adopted by Christians in Nazi Germany who opposed the German Christian movement. In the view of the delegates to the Synod that met in the city of Wuppertal-Barmen in May 1934, the German Christians had corrupted church government by making it subservient to the state and had introduced Nazi ideology into the German Protestant churches that contradicted the Christian gospel.

The Barmen Declaration includes six theses:
# The only source of revelation is the Word of God — Jesus Christ. Any other possible sources (earthly powers, for example) will not be accepted.
# Jesus Christ is the only Lord of all aspects of personal life. There should be no other authority.
# The message and order of the church should not be influenced by the current political convictions.
# The church should not be ruled by a leader (&quot;Führer&quot;). There is no hierarchy in the church (Mt 20, 25f).
# The state should not fulfill the task of the church and vice versa. State and church are both limited to their own business.
# Therefore, the Barmen Declaration rejects (i) the subordination of the Church to the state (8.22–3) and (ii) the subordination of the Word and Spirit to the Church.

&quot;8.27 We reject the false doctrine, as though the Church in human arrogance could place the Word and work of the Lord in the service of any arbitrarily chosen desires, purposes, and plans.&quot;

On the contrary, the Declaration proclaims that the Church &quot;is solely Christ&#x27;s property, and that it lives and wants to live solely from his comfort and from his direction in the expectation of his appearance.&quot; (8.17) Rejecting domestication of the Word in the Church, the Declaration points to the inalienable Lordship of Jesus Christ by the Spirit and to the external character of church unity which &quot;can come only from the Word of God in faith through the Holy Spirit. Thus alone is the Church renewed&quot; (8.01).

:8.04 Try the spirits whether they are of God! Prove also the words of the Confessional Synod of the German Evangelical Church to see whether they agree with Holy Scripture and with the Confessions of the Fathers. If you find that we are speaking contrary to Scripture, then do not listen to us! But if you find that we are taking our stand upon Scripture, then let no fear or temptation keep you from treading with us the path of faith and obedience to the Word of God, in order that God&#x27;s people be of one mind upon earth and that we in faith experience what he himself has said: &quot;I will never leave you, nor forsake you.&quot; Therefore, &quot;Fear not, little flock, for it is your Father&#x27;s good pleasure to give you the kingdom.

The Declaration was mostly written by the Reformed theologian Karl Barth but underwent modification, especially with the introduction of its fifth article (on the two kingdoms), as a result of input from several Lutheran theologians.

The document became the chief confessional document of the so-called Confessing Church. The ecumenical nature of the Declaration can be seen by its inclusion in the &quot;Book of Confessions&quot; of the Presbyterian Church (USA) and the &quot;Book of Order&quot; of the worldwide Moravian Unity, the Unitas Fratrum.

One of the main purposes of the Declaration was to establish a three-church confessional consensus opposing pro-Nazi &quot;German Christianity&quot;. These three churches were Lutheran, Reformed, and United.

<doc id="458036" wikidata="Q1442909" url="?curid=458036" title="Frank Ballance">
<text>Frank Winston Ballance Jr. (February 15, 1942 – February 22, 2019) was an American politician and attorney who was a Democratic member of the United States House of Representatives from 2003 to 2004, representing North Carolina&#x27;s 1st congressional district.

In 2004, Ballance pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit mail fraud and money laundering, and was sentenced to four years in prison, two years supervised release, and fined $10,000.

==Background==
Ballance was born in Windsor, North Carolina. He graduated from W. S. Etheridge High School in 1959 and attended North Carolina Central University, earning a bachelor&#x27;s degree in 1963 and a Juris Doctor degree in 1965.

After law school, Ballance briefly served as a faculty member of the South Carolina State University School of Law before entering private practice in 1966. He served in the North Carolina National Guard Reserve from 1968 to 1971.

==Political career==
Ballance was first elected to the House of the state legislature in 1983 and served until 1986. In 1988, he was elected to the North Carolina Senate; that same year, he had served as chair of the Guilford County chapter of the NAACP. Ballance served in the state senate until 2002, including as deputy president &quot;pro tempore&quot; from 1997 to 2002. He was appointed to the Board of Trustees for both North Carolina Central University and Elizabeth City State University.

==Criminal convictions==
On September 2, 2004, Ballance was indicted on federal charges including money laundering, mail fraud, and conspiracy to commit mail fraud.

On November 9, 2004, a plea agreement was reached under which Frank Ballance pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit mail fraud and money laundering. In January 2005, he was disbarred from the practice of law in the state of North Carolina.

He began serving his sentence at the medium-security federal prison in Butner, North Carolina, on December 30, 2005. According to the Federal Bureau of Prisons, he was released from prison in June 2009.

His son, Garey Ballance, a state district judge in Guilford County, North Carolina, was also charged. Garey Ballance was also charged in the indictment with income tax evasion. Garrey Ballance was convicted, served in prison and was disqualified from becoming a judge again.

<text>Bond (stylised as BOND; formerly often typeset as bond in deference to the owners of the 007 trademark) is an Australian/British string quartet that specialises in classical crossover and synth-pop music. The quartet has sold five million albums.

==Creation==
Bond was formed following initial conversations between Vanessa-Mae composer and record producer Mike Batt and her manager, promoter Mel Bush, after Batt suggested to Bush that the two of them should put together a quartet consisting of &quot;four beautiful, talented musicians&quot; Auditions were held at Baden Powell House in London, and violinist (Eos) and Cellist (Gay Yee) and a viola player were &quot;cast&quot; at that point, using as an audition piece &quot;Contradanza&quot; that Batt had written for Vanessa Mae. It was agreed between them that all was then required was to find the ideal first violinist. Some time later, Bush pushed ahead without Batt, recruiting Batt&#x27;s former engineer Gareth Cousins. This resulted in an initial four recordings the band made, leading to Bond being signed by Decca. Three of those original recordings, &quot;Duel&quot;, &quot;The 1812&quot; and &quot;Dalalai&quot;, were the backbone of the first album, &quot;Born&quot;, with producer Magnus Fiennes providing additional tracks and Mike Batt adding a re-arrangement and remix of &quot;Victory&quot;, which became the first single.

The quartet currently consists of Tania Davis (first violin, formerly viola, from Sydney, Australia), Eos Counsell (second violin, from Cardiff, Wales), Elspeth Hanson (viola, from Upper Basildon, England) and Gay-Yee Westerhoff (cello, from Hull, England). Hanson replaced original band member Haylie Ecker (formerly first violin and from Perth, Australia), who left in 2008 to have a child.

===Genre and success===
Their début album &quot;Born&quot; was removed from the UK classical chart, apparently owing to its &quot;sounding too much like pop music&quot;. &quot;Born&quot; later rose to #1 on 21 charts around the world. &quot;Shine&quot;, their second album, went gold in six countries. &quot;Remixed&quot; featured remixes from their first two albums as well as three new pieces. Their third studio album &quot;Classified&quot; went double platinum in Australia, reaching the number one spot on both the classical and pop charts. &quot;&quot; is a &quot;Best of&quot; that, again, included three unreleased pieces.

==Appearances and recent work==
The quartet spent much of 2003 touring, particularly throughout Asia, and participating in the Miss Universe 2003 held in Panama City, Panama. They also fitted in performing and filming a TV commercial for American department store chain Marshall Field&#x27;s and made a commercial in Los Angeles for the Japanese karaoke manufacturer Daiichi Kosho. The group made their movie debut playing themselves in a scene in Rowan Atkinson&#x27;s James Bond spoof &quot;Johnny English&quot; for which they also contributed the track &quot;Kismet&quot; (composed by Westerhoff) and played on the Main Theme. They also appeared as themselves in the film &quot;&quot;, performing &quot;Victory&quot;.

The classical violinist André Rieu and the Johann Strauss Orchestra performed live on New Year&#x27;s Eve in Vienna in a set that includes many Strauss favorites, as well as an appearance from Bond performing &quot;Victory&quot;.

In 2009, Peugeot commissioned Bond to record Vivaldi&#x27;s &quot;Four Seasons&quot; to advertise the 308CC. All four members of the band helped arrange these tracks. The tracks were available for download from Peugeot&#x27;s website free of charge, with &quot;Summer&quot; and &quot;Winter&quot; also appearing on Bond&#x27;s album &quot;Play&quot;.

In an interview with the &quot;Birmingham Mail&quot;, Davis revealed that Bond were currently working on their next studio album. She also noted that the next album would have Gypsy, folk, and Eastern European influences. In late 2010 the band started to perform new material from their new album &quot;Play&quot; at concerts in Mexico, including the new single &quot;Diablo&quot;.

Songs on the album include their first single, titled &quot;Diablo&quot;. It is characterized by an up-tempo beat, and features Bond&#x27;s own Eos Counsell as vocalist in the song. The string quartet also showcases Jai Ho, a huge hit from the movie Slumdog Millionaire. The album also features a few more recognizable hits, such as the song &quot;Pump It&quot;, a version of the Dick Dale and His Del Tones&#x27; hit song &quot;Miserlou&quot;, featured in the opening credits of &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot;. The song &quot;Last Time&quot; is an interpretation of the song Bitter Sweet Symphony by the band The Verve.

Members of Bond have also written their own tracks on the album. Gay-Yee Westerhoff wrote the song &quot;Beatroot&quot;, which is strongly Russian influenced (noticeable by a clarinet improvising over the strings).

According to the band&#x27;s webpage, the group recorded a medley of Lady Gaga hits at the request of its Japanese label. The Lady Gaga medley was available initially by phone download and was released digitally, soon after, as part of a special Japanese album release.

Bond also performed &quot;I Am the Walrus&quot; alongside Russell Brand at the 2012 Olympics Closing Ceremony. They returned to the Olympic Stadium in London in July 2013 to perform at The National Lottery Anniversary Run event.

A team consisting of the 4 remaining members of Bond, and composer David Arnold (according to the BBC, including because he has composed music for James Bond movies), competed in and won an episode of &quot;Celebrity Eggheads&quot; first aired on BBC2 on Thursday 1 June 2017, winning a £20,000 prize for charity as a result.

Bond performed the Australian National Anthem at the Australia versus New Zealand match of the 2013 Rugby Championship in Sydney,
17 August.

Bond performed &quot;Married Life&quot; from &quot;Up&quot; alongside the Cinematic Sinfonia at the Royal Albert Hall as part of &quot;Michael Giacchino At 50: A Birthday Gala Celebration&quot; on 20 October 2017.

<doc id="458042" wikidata="Q1540333" url="?curid=458042" title="Dovetail joint">
<text>A dovetail joint or simply dovetail is a joinery technique most commonly used in woodworking joinery (carpentry), including furniture, cabinets, log buildings, and traditional timber framing. Noted for its resistance to being pulled apart, also known as tensile strength, the dovetail joint is commonly used to join the sides of a drawer to the front. A series of pins cut to extend from the end of one board interlock with a series of &#x27;tails&#x27; cut into the end of another board. The pins and tails have a trapezoidal shape. Once glued, a wooden dovetail joint requires no mechanical fasteners.

==History==
The dovetail joint technique probably pre-dates written history. Some of the earliest known examples of the dovetail joint are in ancient Egyptian furniture entombed with mummies dating from First Dynasty, the tombs of Chinese emperors, and a stone pillar at the Vazhappally Maha Siva Temple in India. The dovetail design is an important method of distinguishing various periods of furniture.

The etymology of the name comes from the resemblance between the tenon or mortise of the joint to the shape of a dove&#x27;s tail . In Europe, the dovetail joint is sometimes called a swallowtail joint, a culvertail joint (&#x27; also means &#x27;dove&#x27;), or a fantail joint.

==Methods==
The dovetail joint is very strong because of the way the &#x27;tails&#x27; and &#x27;pins&#x27; are shaped. This makes it difficult to pull the joint apart and virtually impossible when glue is added. This type of joint is used in box constructions such as drawers, jewellery boxes, cabinets and other pieces of furniture where strength is required. It is a difficult joint to make manually, requiring skilled workmanship. There are different types of dovetail joints.

The angle of slope varies according to the wood used, purpose of joint and type of work. Typically the slope is 1:6 for softwoods, and a shallower 1:8 slope for hardwoods. Often a slope of 1:7 is used as a compromise. However, a different slope does not affect the strength of the joint in different types of wood.

==Types of dovetails==
===Through dovetail===

A &#x27;through dovetail&#x27; (also known as &#x27;plain dovetail&#x27;) joint leaves the end grain of both boards visible when the joint is assembled. Through dovetails are common in carcass and box construction. Traditionally, the dovetails would have often been covered by a veneer. However, dovetails have become a signature of craftsmanship and are generally considered a feature, so they are rarely concealed in contemporary work. When used in drawer construction, a through (or blind, mitred, or lapped) dovetail joint is sometimes referred to as an &quot;English dovetail.&quot;

===Half-blind dovetail===

Craftsmen use a &#x27;half-blind dovetail&#x27; when they do not want the end grain visible from the front of the joint. The tails fit into mortises in the ends of the board that is the front of the item, hiding their ends.

Half-blind dovetails are commonly used to fasten drawer fronts to drawer sides. This is an alternative to the practice of attaching false fronts to drawers constructed using through dovetails.

===Secret mitred dovetail===

The &#x27;secret mitred dovetail&#x27; joint (also called a &#x27;mitred blind dovetail&#x27;, &#x27;full-blind dovetail&#x27;, or &#x27;full-blind mitred dovetail&#x27;) is used in the highest class of cabinet and box work. It offers the strength found in the dovetail joint but is totally hidden from both outside faces by forming the outer edge to meet at a 45-degree angle while hiding the dovetails internally within the joint.

The mitred corner dovetail joint is very similar in design, but it has just a single dovetail and is used for picture frames and other similar joins.

===Secret double-lapped dovetail===
The secret double-lapped dovetail is similar to the secret mitred dovetail, but presents a very thin section of end grain on one edge of the joint. Used for carcass and box construction to hide the dovetails completely from view.

===Sliding dovetail===

The sliding dovetail is a method of joining two boards at right angles, where the intersection occurs within the field of one of the boards, that is not at the end. This joint provides the interlocking strength of a dovetail. Sliding dovetails are assembled by sliding the tail into the socket. It is common to slightly taper the socket, making it slightly tighter towards the rear of the joint, so that the two components can be slid together easily but the joint becomes tighter as the finished position is reached. Another method to implement a tapered sliding dovetail is to taper the tail instead of the socket. When used in drawer construction, a &quot;stopped sliding dovetail&quot; that does not extend across the full width of the board is sometimes referred to as a &quot;French dovetail&quot;.

Used for:
* Joining shelves to cabinet sides
* Joining cabinet bottoms to sides
* Joining horizontal partitions to shelves
* Joining adjacent sections of expandable table frames
* Joining drawer fronts to sides
* Joining front rails of web frames to cabinet sides
* Joining neck and body in violins and some guitars.

== Non-woodworking dovetails ==

Dovetails are most commonly, but not exclusively, used in woodworking. Other areas of use are:
*Dovetail slides, for example on a lathe, a milling machine or other machine tools.
*Attaching turbine blades to the shaft in jet engines and other applications.
*Clockmaking: dovetailing a new tooth, when replacing broken teeth in clock gears.
*Masonry: dovetail construction is regarded a major step forward in the design of lighthouses meant for particularly dangerous areas; the Eddystone Lighthouse and Fastnet Lighthouse are examples of the durable quality of dovetail masonry.
*3D printing: dovetail is commonly used to overcome physical object print size limitation of a 3D printer.
*Aiming devices such as iron sights or telescopic sights on firearms and airguns may be affixed via a dovetail rail to the receiver or slide. 11mm or 3/8 is the most common measurement frequently used in airguns and rimfire rifles and pistols.

<doc id="458044" wikidata="Q1335725" url="?curid=458044" title="Keuka Lake">
<text>Keuka Lake ( ) is one of the major Finger Lakes in the U.S. state of New York. It is unusual because it is Y-shaped, in contrast to the long and narrow shape of the other Finger Lakes. Because of its shape, it was referred to in the past as Crooked Lake. means &#x27;canoe landing&#x27; or &#x27;lake with an elbow&#x27; in the Seneca language. The first white settlers to the lake region came after the Sullivan Expedition during the American Revolutionary War. In 1833 the Crooked Lake Canal was completed, connecting Keuka Lake with Seneca Lake, connecting with the Erie Canal. Beginning in the first half of the 19th century many steamboats operated on the lake which largely functioned as transports between Penn Yan and Hammondsport, often in service of the wine industry. In 1872 the Bath &amp; Hammondsport Railroad, connecting to the Erie Railroad, went into operation, replacing the use of the canal. Beginning in the mid 19th century the lake has since been surrounded by vineyards and wineries which earned it the title, the &quot;Cradle of the Wine Industry&quot;, in New York. During the beginning of the 20th century the first water-craft airplanes were developed and tested on Keuka Lake by aviation pioneer Glenn Curtiss.

==Description==
The Y-shaped empties into another Finger Lake, Seneca Lake, at the village of Dresden, Yates County, New York through a stream called Keuka Lake Outlet at the lake&#x27;s northeastern end in Penn Yan.

==History==

The Indigenous people around Keuka Lake referred to the two-pronged lake as &quot;canoe landing.&quot; In the later 18th century, the first white settlers to the area named the lake Crooked Lake. In 1779, during the American Revolutionary War, the Sullivan Expedition clashed with and defeated the British who occupied the region, along with the various Iroquois tribes who were allied with them. Upon their return home, troops under the command of John Sullivan carried encouraging reports of the natural beauty and rich soils of the lake region to populations in the east. This encouraged many white settlers to migrate to the region and establish wheat farms about the lake, with grist mills along its outlet.

In 1788 the township of Jerusalem, New York was founded by a Quaker Evangelist preacher, Jemima Wilkinson, who, after recovering from a near-death illness, referred to herself as the &quot;Public Universal Friend&quot;. Wilkinson, with a following of twenty-five other settlers, began to clear twenty-five acres of forest and built a number of log cabins along the creek which led from Keuka Lake to Seneca Lake. As the surface elevation of Keuka Lake was more than 260 feet higher than Seneca Lake, it was considered an ideal location for a grist mill, with the outlet creek providing water power. By 1790 the religious congregation numbered two hundred and sixty. Together they built the first frame house on Keuka Lake Outlet for their leader. it was a large two-story structure that housed nine fireplaces about a central chimney. A thirty-foot-square log meeting house for religious services was also built. Wilkinson and her followers remained here from 1790 to 1794. In 1790 the first mill was established at the falls of the creek. In 1794 the first sawmill to emerge inside the village limits of Penn Yan was established by Lewis Birdsall, who commissioned Enoch Malin to oversee its construction on the outlet&#x27;s north bank. In the following years there was much growth along the length of the outlet. By 1820 there were 14 sawmills, 7 grist mills, several distilleries, an oil mill, 4 carding machines, all of which made use of local raw materials such as wheat, timber, flaxseed, wool and corn.

The New York State legislature, after many months of deliberation, approved the building of a canal in 1829, connecting Keuka Lake with Seneca Lake, which involved widening the northern outlet of Keuka Lake. The outlet was widened to accommodate the same size vessels used on the Erie Canal. Given the name the Crooked Lake Canal, it connected to nearby Seneca Lake and the Seneca Canal, where it connected to the Erie Canal, which connected to the Hudson River, making transports from Keuka Lake to New York City possible. The prospect of a canal, even before it was completed, inspired new business and considerable growth in the towns around Keuka Lake. In 1872 the Bath &amp; Hammondsport Railroad went into operation. As a branch line connecting to the Erie Railroad, it soon made the canal obsolete. In 1884 the Fall Brook Railroad line was completed, which largely followed the towpath and bed of the canal, while several paper mills were constructed whose goods were shipped by this railroad. The rail route is now a hiking and cycling trail named the Keuka Outlet Trail.

Keuka Lake has a long history of waterborne transport. Early in the 19th century, George McClure of Bath launched a sailboat, the schooner &quot;Sally&quot;, on Keuka Lake, then called Crooked Lake, which transported wheat and other goods between Hammondsport, located on the southern tip of Keuka Lake, and Penn Yan, located at the northern tip. Before long steamboats made the scene and were transporting grain and other produce, grown in the lake area, across the lake to Hammondsport, where it was transported by wagons to other points. By 1835 there were several steamboats running on the lake, which typically made runs between Hammondsport and Penn Yan. The first steamboat built was called the &quot;Keuka Maid&quot;, a sidewheeler of 85 feet in length, with a steam engine that was fueled by wood. The vessel remained in service until it grounded in mud and was subsequently dismantled in 1848. The second steamboat to appear was the &quot;Steuben&quot;, a side-wheeler, built in 1845, whose captain was John Gregg. In 1864 it caught fire while docked at Penn Yan. In 1847, Lemuel Hastings was the first to ship a large quantity of grapes and jelly via the canal to New York City. Following was the steamer the &quot;George R. Youngs&quot;, was launched in 1864. This vessel was 130 feet in length with an elaborate dining room. The vessel was rechristened the &quot;Steuben&quot; and remained in service until in 1879. Captain Allen Wood Keuka, introduced the &quot;Keuka&quot;, a screw steamer, to the lake in 1867. Shortly thereafter the &quot;Yates&quot;, a 115-foot side wheeler, operated on the lake from 1872 to 1883, until she caught fire from the furnace and her boiler, which became typical of many steamboats on the lake. In 1878, a new sidewheeler, the Lulu, made her maiden voyage down the 21 miles of lake. 
On Saturday, May 8, 1892, the steamer &quot;Mary Bell&quot; was launched into Keuka Lake. Referred to as &quot;The Queen of &quot;, with a 600-passenger capacity, the vessel was 150 feet in length with a beam that exceeded 20 feet, making it the largest vessel ever to cruise the lake. Built on the Hammondsport waterfront by the Union Dry Dock Company of Buffalo, the steamer cost $40,000. It achieved speeds in excess of 18 miles per hour, considered fast for a vessel of its size in those days. Judge Struble of Penn Yan delivered a speech to more than 5,000 spectators. After the speech the wife of the manager of the shipbuilding company had the honor of christening the ship, with the words, &quot;I Christen Thee Mary Bell&quot;. After some mechanical delays with the launching apparatus the ship slipped into at 7:30 pm amid the cheers of those who came to see the event. The trial run of the entire length of was made on June 22, as the ship cruised from Penn Yan to Hammondsport at the opposite end of the lake 20 miles to the south. The &quot;Mary Bell&quot; remained in operation for 30 years. She was the last steamboat to operate on the lake in 1922, ending 85 years of steamboat history on .

The wine industry got its start in 1830 when Episcopal Reverend Bostwick planted a small vineyard at his rectory in Hammondsport, which produced an exceptional vintage. He subsequently ascertained that the region around the lake would be ideal for growing imported grape vines and encouraged various farmers around the lake to pursue viticulture. Bostwick never went commercial with his viticulture, but others saw such an opportunity. In 1847 William Hastings, from a vineyard of less than an acre overlooking Keuka Lake sent the first shipment of Keuka grapes, some 50 pounds, to the market in New York City. The following year he shipped 200 pounds of Isabella grapes to New York. In 1857 J. M. Prentiss shipped a ton of grapes from his Pulteney farm on the west shore of. Many farmers were subsequently inspired and began planting vineyards along the hillsides of the lake. By I860 there were 200 acres of vineyards surrounding the lake. By 1870 there were thousands of acres of vineyards covering the countryside surrounding the lake, while numerous wineries also began to emerge around the lake. They were housed in structures typically made from the abundant flat rocks about the lakeside. With the subsequent development of the grape industry, a new prosperity to the region had been well established. As grapes and wines were becoming known around the world, Steamboats were needed to haul them from the ports along the lake and take them to Hammondsport. From there they were hauled first by wagons and later by railroads. By 1921, with the increased use of gasoline-powered trucks and cars, steamboat traffic on the lake began to diminish: The &quot;Mary Bell&quot; was the last large vessel to make the run between Hammondsport and Penn Yan on opposite ends of the lake. The hills around Keuka Lake was where many prominent vineyards took root.The oldest of the four important wineries was the Pleasant Valley Wine Company, founded in 1860, in Hammondsport In 1953 Konstantin Damien Frank, settled in Hammondsport. A grower of Vitis vinifera grapes, Frank encouraged other winemakers to grow this type of grape, which met both approval and disapproval from the other growers in the lake region 

Hammondsport was the birthplace and home of Glenn Curtiss, a pioneer of naval aviation, and is now the site of the Glenn H. Curtiss Museum. Early in the 20th century, the first watercraft airplanes invented by Curtiss were developed and tested on Keuka Lake. Several variations of the Curtiss Model H, the world&#x27;s first &quot;flying boat&quot;, made numerous take-offs and landings in Keuka Lake. During this time the Curtis Manufacturing Company was established in Hammondsport. Its great success and national notoriety is said to have &quot;put Hammondsport and Keuka Lake on the map&quot;.

==Ecology==

This body of water possesses large and healthy populations of lake trout, brown trout, rainbow trout, landlocked salmon, smallmouth bass, largemouth bass, and yellow perch. The productive fishery is supported by huge numbers of baitfish, most notably alewives (sawbellies), and is a very popular lake with area fishermen.

Humans, fish, and wildlife depend on the rich ecology of the lake habitat. The complex ecosystem is subject to contamination of the watershed, largely by stormwater runoff. The Keuka Lake Association (KLA) monitors the water of the lake to ensure that it is suitable for its many uses, such as drinking, fishing, and swimming. Tributary streams, groundwater, and the lake itself are regularly tested for water quality. Additionally, KLA collects and publishes data about the lake level.

The infestation of European zebra mussels, which has impacted many North American bodies of water, has also affected Keuka Lake and other Finger Lakes in New York. In addition to disrupting the lake&#x27;s ecosystem, zebra mussels can be a nuisance to lakeside homeowners. Their small size enables them to clog water intake pipes. Furthermore, their sharp shells can cause lacerations on the feet of bathers. Bathers may wish to wear water shoes when swimming in the lake.

==Surroundings==
The village of Penn Yan is at the northeastern tip of the lake, and Branchport is at the northwestern tip. Hammondsport lies at the south end of the lake. 

While the shore of the lake is primarily residential, Keuka College is located in Keuka Park on the western shore of the east branch and Keuka Lake State Park is located on the eastern side of the northwest branch of the lake. Camp Iroquois, run by the New York State Sheriffs Institute, is located on the eastern side of the bluff. YMCA Camp Cory is located on the eastern side of the northeast branch of the lake. Camp Good Days and Special Times is located on the western side of the northwest branch of the lake. Garrett Memorial Chapel is located near the tip of the bluff between the two branches.

An important component of the economy of this region is based on grape growing and wine production.

<doc id="458047" wikidata="Q1277349" url="?curid=458047" title="Earl of Malmesbury">
<text>Earl of Malmesbury is a title in the Peerage of Great Britain. It was created in 1800 for the diplomat James Harris, 1st Baron Malmesbury. The son of the grammarian and politician James Harris, he served as Ambassador to Spain, Prussia, Russia and France and also represented Christchurch in the House of Commons. Harris had been created Baron Malmesbury, of Malmesbury in the County of Wiltshire, in 1788. He was made Viscount FitzHarris, of Hurn Court in the County of Southampton, at the same time as he was given the earldom. The earldom and viscountcy were the last creations in the peerage of Great Britain, future titles being made in the peerage of the United Kingdom which took effect three days later.

He was succeeded by his eldest son, the second Earl. He sat as Member of Parliament for Helston, Horsham, Heytesbury and Wilton. His eldest son, the third Earl, was a prominent Conservative politician. He served as Foreign Secretary in 1852 and from 1858 to 1859 and was also Lord Privy Seal and Leader of the House of Lords. Lord Malmesbury died childless and was succeeded by his nephew, the fourth Earl. He was the son of Admiral the Hon. Sir Edward Harris, second son of the second Earl. His eldest son, the fifth Earl, served as a Lord-in-waiting (government whip in the House of Lords) from 1922 to 1924 in the Conservative administrations of Bonar Law and Stanley Baldwin and was later Chairman of the Hampshire County Council. He was succeeded by his only son, the sixth Earl. He was Lord Lieutenant of Hampshire from 1973 to 1982. As of 2010, the titles are held by his only son, the seventh Earl, who succeeded in 2000.

Two other members of the Harris family have also gained distinction. The aforementioned the Hon. Sir Edward Harris (1808–1888), second son of the second Earl, was an admiral in the Royal Navy, held several diplomatic posts and represented Christchurch in Parliament. The Right Reverend the Hon. Charles Amyand Harris (1813–1874), third son of the second Earl, was a clergyman and served as Bishop of Gibraltar from 1868 to 1873.

The present family seat is Greywell Hill House, near Odiham, Hampshire. The former seat was Heron Court (or Hern Court or Hurn Court) at Hurn, near Christchurch, Dorset (although within the historic county boundaries of Hampshire).

<doc id="458065" wikidata="Q5326387" url="?curid=458065" title="Earl of Westmeath">
<text>Earl of Westmeath is a title in the Peerage of Ireland. It was created in 1621 for Richard Nugent, Baron Delvin. During the Tudor era the loyalty of the Nugent family was often in question, and Richard&#x27;s father, the sixth Baron, died in prison while awaiting trial for treason, a crime for which other members of the family had already been condemned. Richard himself when young was suspected of plotting rebellion and was imprisoned, but in later life, he was a staunch supporter of the Crown, which rewarded him richly for his loyalty. The fifth Earl was a Major-General in the British Army. The sixth Earl was sworn of the Irish Privy Council in 1758. His son by his first wife, Richard Nugent, Lord Delvin, was killed in a duel at an early age. Lord Westmeath was succeeded by his second son by his second wife, the seventh Earl. He sat in the House of Lords as one of the original 28 Irish representative peers; he was also involved in a much-publicised divorce following an action for criminal conversation against his wife and her lover. He was succeeded by his son, the eighth Earl. He was created Marquess of Westmeath in the Peerage of Ireland in 1822. He had no surviving male issue and the marquessate became extinct on his death in 1871. He was succeeded in the barony and earldom by his kinsman, Anthony Francis Nugent, the ninth Earl, who was a claimant to the title Baron Nugent of Riverston. The eleventh Earl was an Irish Representative Peer from 1901 to 1933.

<doc id="458072" wikidata="Q1736850" url="?curid=458072" title="Katy Trail State Park">
<text>The Katy Trail State Park is a state park in the U.S. state of Missouri that contains the Katy Trail, the country&#x27;s longest continuous recreational rail trail. It runs , largely along the northern bank of the Missouri River, in the right-of-way of the former Missouri–Kansas–Texas Railroad. Open year-round from sunrise to sunset, it serves hikers, joggers, and cyclists. Its hard, flat surface is of &quot;limestone pug&quot; (crushed limestone).

The nickname &quot;Katy&quot; comes from the phonetic pronunciation of &quot;KT&quot;, a short form of the railroad&#x27;s abbreviated name, MKT. Sections of the Katy are also part of the Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail and the American Discovery Trail.

==History==
Conversion of right-of-way to a trail was made possible by the National Trails System Act of 1968. In 1982, the city of Columbia opened the MKT Trail on an abandoned spur of the Katy as one of the first rails-to-trails pilot projects in the United States.

On October 4, 1986, floodwater from the Missouri River severely damaged the track along the Missouri–Kansas–Texas Railroad&#x27;s route from Sedalia to Machens, Missouri. The route had been washed out and repaired many times, but this time, railroad officials decided not to return the tracks to service. Trains were re-routed, and the right-of-way was to be abandoned. The Missouri Department of Natural Resources purchased the right-of-way with a donation from Edward D. &quot;Ted&quot; Jones and Pat Jones of Williamsburg and St. Louis. In 1990, the first segment of the trail officially opened in Rocheport.

In 1991, the Union Pacific Railroad donated of right-of-way from Sedalia to Clinton.

The trail was initially planned for completion in 1994. However, the Great Flood of 1993 damaged of the original of the trail. The completed trail from St. Charles to Sedalia was finally opened in 1996; the section from Sedalia to Clinton opened in 1999.

In 2011, the trail was expanded to include the corridor from St. Charles to Machens.

== Trail networks ==
A new section of trail on the Rock Island railroad corridor opened in December 2016. The Rock Island Spur starts at Windsor, on the Katy Trail, and runs 47 miles northwest towards Kansas City. The trail, originally slated to be named Rock Island Trail State Park, extends the trail system to the suburbs of Kansas City at Pleasant Hill on rail banked right-of-way of the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad.

A settlement to allow the use of this portion of the Rock Island corridor was reached between Missouri Governor Matt Blunt and Ameren as partial compensation for a flood which devastated Johnson&#x27;s Shut-ins State Park after the failure of a dam owned by Ameren.

Efforts are being made to extend that trail from Pleasant Hill further into the center of the Kansas City metro area. A six-mile segment of that trail opened in the Lee&#x27;s Summit area in 2019.

Plans are underway to add another unused section of the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific to Rock Island Trail State Park, which, with the Katy, would create a trail network.

The extension would run from Windsor to Beaufort, near Washington. Preliminary plans are to then extend the trail into Washington from where it could cross the Missouri River to connect to the Katy Trail again, completing a cross-state loop.

A &quot;quad state&quot; proposal would connect the Katy and other existing trails in Missouri, Kansas, Iowa, and Nebraska.

==Route==
The Katy Trail currently begins at Machens (mile-marker 27) on the Missouri River and runs along the northern bank of the river for most of the trail&#x27;s length. The next major city along the trail is Jefferson City, the state capital. At mile-marker 169.9 (McBaine), the trail intersects the MKT Trail, which leads into downtown Columbia, the largest city along the trail. The Katy trail then deviates from the rail route, crossing the Missouri River at Boonville on the Boonslick Bridge instead of the original MKT Bridge, then running to its terminus in Clinton at mile-marker 264.6.

==MKT bridge at Boonville==

The Katy Trail is part of the U.S. railbank, which means it must remain connected to the national railway network so that it could be returned to active railway use. The segment of the trail between St. Charles and Sedalia was connected in two locations. One of these connections is in St. Charles and the other was provided by the Missouri–Kansas–Texas Bridge at Boonville. The Missouri Department of Natural Resources was granted the right to keep the bridge in place and to use it at the MDNR&#x27;s discretion as part of the trail under the Interim Trail Agreement of June 25, 1987. But on April 28, 2005, the Missouri Department of Natural Resources amended the agreement, abandoning its rights to the bridge and allowing Union Pacific to remove the bridge and thus creating two independent segments in the trail, east and west of Boonville. If the connection in St. Charles is destroyed or otherwise rendered unusable by rail (such as by natural disaster), the segment of the trail between St. Charles and Boonville would lose its railbanked status and ownership of the land would probably revert to its original owners from before the MKT Line was built. The same could happen to the segment east of Boonville if its connection is lost.

On February 4, 2010, Missouri Governor Jay Nixon announced that Union Pacific Railroad would give the bridge to the city of Boonville, ending a nearly six-year dispute over the bridge and the trail. The city announced it would restore the bridge and incorporate it back into the Katy Trail bicycle and hiking trail.

<doc id="458074" wikidata="Q1197656" url="?curid=458074" title="Empress Teimei">
<text>, posthumously honoured as , was the wife of Emperor Taishō and the mother of Emperor Shōwa. Her posthumous name, &quot;Teimei&quot;, means &quot;enlightened constancy&quot;. She was also the paternal grandmother of Emperor Emeritus Akihito, and the paternal great-grandmother of Emperor Naruhito.

==Biography==
Sadako Kujō was born on 25 June 1884 in Tokyo, as the fourth daughter of Duke Michitaka Kujō, head of Kujō branch of the Fujiwara clan. Her mother was Ikuko Noma (Concubinage).

She married then-Crown Prince Yoshihito (the future Emperor Taishō) on 10 May 1900, at the age of 15. The couple lived in the newly constructed Akasaka Palace in Tokyo, outside of the main Tokyo Imperial Palace complex. When she gave birth to a son, Hirohito, Prince Michi (the future Emperor Shōwa) in 1901, she was the first official wife of a Crown Prince or Emperor to have given birth to the official heir to the throne since 1750.

She became when her husband ascended to the throne on 30 July 1912 following the death of her father-in-law, Emperor Meiji. Given her husband&#x27;s weak physical and mental condition, she exerted a strong influence on imperial life, and was an active patron of Japanese Red Cross Society. The relations between the Emperor and Empress of Taishō period were very good, as evidenced by Emperor Taishō&#x27;s lack of interest in taking concubines, thus breaking with hundreds of years of imperial tradition, and by her giving birth to four sons.

After the death of Emperor Taishō on 25 December 1926, her title became that of (which means &quot;widow of the former emperor&quot;). She openly objected to Japan&#x27;s involvement in World War II, which might have caused conflict with her eldest son, Emperor Hirohito. From 1943, she also worked behind the scenes with her third son Nobuhito, Prince Takamatsu to bring about the downfall of Prime Minister Hideki Tōjō.

She was a Buddhist adherent who had faith in Nichiren Shoshu and prayed with the Shinto ritual ceremonies of the Tokyo Imperial Palace.

She died on 17 May 1951 at Omiya Palace in Tokyo, aged 66, and was buried near her husband, Emperor Taishō, in the &quot;Tama no higashi no misasagi&quot; (多摩東陵) at the Musashi Imperial Graveyard in Tokyo.

<doc id="458076" wikidata="Q2555601" url="?curid=458076" title="Chinatown, Los Angeles">
<text>Chinatown is a neighborhood in Downtown Los Angeles, California, that became a commercial center for Chinese and other Asian businesses in Central Los Angeles in 1938. The area includes restaurants, shops, and art galleries, but also has a residential neighborhood with a low-income, aging population of about 7,800 residents.

The original Chinatown developed in the late 19th century, and was demolished to make room for Union Station, the city&#x27;s major ground-transportation center. This neighborhood and commercial center, referred to as &quot;New Chinatown,&quot; opened for business in 1938.

==Geography and climate==
According to Community Redevelopment Agency of the City of Los Angeles (CRA/LA), borders of (the current) Chinatown neighborhood are:
*on the north: Stadium Way and Dodger Stadium/Chavez Ravine, which the L.A. Times includes as part of the Elysian Park neighborhood;
**in addition, there is a northern sliver along North Broadway between Radio Hill Gardens on the northwest and Los Angeles State Historic Park on the southeast
* to the west and northwest, Beaudry and Figueroa streets and the greater Echo Park neighborhood
* on the east, 
** according to CRA/LA: North Main Street, Los Angeles State Historic Park and industrial areas along the west bank of the Los Angeles River
** according to the L.A. Times: the Los Angeles River and Lincoln Heights neighborhood
* on the south, Cesar Chavez Avenue and the Civic Center and Los Angeles Plaza historic districts of Downtown Los Angeles

==History==

Chinatown can refer to one of three locations near downtown Los Angeles. What is now known as &quot;Old Chinatown&quot; refers to the original location on Alameda and Macy (1880s–1933). Old Chinatown was displaced by the construction of Union Station, and two competing Chinatowns were built in the late 1930s north of Old Chinatown to replace it: &quot;China City&quot; (1938–1948) and &quot;New Chinatown&quot; (1938–present). China City was rebuilt just one year after opening due to a suspicious fire, but another fire in 1948 put it out of business for good.

===Old Chinatown===
===China City===
China City was a short-lived China-themed district developed by Christine Sterling in 1938.

===Little Italy===
The neighborhood that has become Chinatown was formerly Sonoratown and then Little Italy. In the early 20th century, Italian immigrants settled in the area north of the Old Plaza. Many built businesses, including wineries (San Antonio Winery is still in existence). The Italian American Museum of Los Angeles in the El Pueblo de Los Ángeles Historical Monument opened in 2016.

===New Chinatown===

In the 1930s, under the efforts of Chinese-American community leader Peter Soo Hoo Sr., the design and operational concepts for a New Chinatown evolved through a collective community process, resulting in a blend of Chinese and American architecture. The neighborhood saw major development, especially as a tourist attraction, throughout the 1930s, with the development of the &quot;Central Plaza,&quot; a Hollywoodized version of Shanghai, containing names such as &quot;Bamboo Lane&quot;, &quot;Gin Ling Way&quot; and &quot;Chung King Road&quot; (named after the city of Chongqing in mainland China). Chinatown was designed by Hollywood film set designers, and a &quot;Chinese&quot; movie prop was subsequently donated by film director Cecil B. DeMille to give Chinatown an exotic atmosphere.
The Hop Sing Tong Society is situated in Central Plaza, as are several other Chinatown lodges and guilds. Near Broadway, Central Plaza contains a statue honoring Dr. Sun Yat-sen, the Chinese revolutionary leader who is considered the &quot;founder of modern China&quot;. It was erected in the 1960s by the Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Association. A 7-foot tall statue of martial artist Bruce Lee was unveiled at Central Plaza on June 15, 2013.
During the 1980s, many buildings were constructed for new shopping centers and mini-malls, especially along Broadway. Metro Plaza Hotel was opened in the southwest corner of Chinatown in the early 1990s. A large Chinese gateway is found at the intersection of Broadway and Cesar Chavez Avenue, funded by the local Teochew-speaking population.

In 1996, Academy Award-winning (for &quot;The Killing Fields&quot; in 1985) Cambodian refugee, physician and actor, Haing S. Ngor, was shot and killed in the Chinatown residential area in a bungled robbery attempt by members of an Asian gang.

By 2000 many people had left the Chinatown for the City of Monterey Park, which is a part of the larger Chinese community in the San Gabriel Valley. In 2000 &quot;AsianWeek&quot; said that the Los Angeles Chinatown was &quot;troubled.&quot;

On June 28, 2008, a celebration of the 1938 founding of New Chinatown was held with the L.A. Chinatown 70th Anniversary Party. &quot;Though lacking the hustle and bustle of San Francisco&#x27;s Chinatown, Los Angeles&#x27; version has charms of its own.&quot;

===Revitalization with new development===
The 2010s and 2020s have seen the completion of several large mixed-use and multifamily residential buildings like other neighborhoods in and around Downtown Los Angeles. Activists and city council members were concerned about rising rents and displacement of long time residents, many of them low-income as these revitalization projects were approved. City officials and housing activists have debated how much affordable housing should be included amidst the market rate apartments and condominiums. Since 2019, the neighborhood has lacked a centrally located grocery store with a large selection, affordable prices and consistently high quality that opens early and closes late.

==Demographics==
The 2020 U.S. census counted 7,798 residents, with a population density of 19,230 per square mile. 

The ethnic breakdown in 2010: Asian, 68.8%; Latino, 14.7%; blacks, 6.7%; whites, 8.7%; mixed race, 0.8%; and others, 2.3%.

The median household income in 2010 dollars ($29,000), was the third-lowest in Los Angeles County, preceded by Watts ($28,200) and Downtown ($24,300). The percentage of households earning $20,000 or less (53.6%) was the third-largest in Los Angeles County, preceded by Downtown (57.4%) and University Park (56.6%). The average household size of 2.8 people was just about the city norm. Renters occupied 91% of the housing units, and home- or apartment owners the rest.

== Economy ==
===Retail===
Small, specialized grocery stores are important to the aging population but few remain as gentrification impacts the neighborhood. The Chinese-Vietnamese residents own many bazaars. The stores sell products such as soap, toys, clothes, music CDs at low prices. Several restaurants in Chinatown serve mainly Cantonese cuisine but there are also various Asian cuisine restaurants such as Teochew Chinese, Vietnamese, Indonesian, and Thai, which reflects the diverse character of Chinatown. Few boba cafes have opened in Chinatown, but a large number are to be found in the Chinese enclaves in the San Gabriel Valley.

Dynasty Center, Saigon Plaza, and the Chinatown Phuoc Loc Tho Center feature many Vietnamese-style bazaars with people engaged in bargain shopping for items such as clothing, toys, Chinese-language CDs, pets, household items, funerary products, and so on. Its entrepreneurs are ethnic Chinese from Vietnam.

There are over 20 art galleries to see, mostly featuring non-Chinese modern art, with works from up and coming artists in all types of media. 

===Restaurants===

Chinatown is in the process of becoming an entirely new place. Chinatown at the height of popularity was filled with bustling Chinese restaurants that included barbecue delicatessens with glass displays of roast duck and suckling pig and Cantonese seafood restaurants with dim sum. As the action in Chinese cuisine became centered in the San Gabriel Valley, there were also places that offered Vietnamese pho noodle soup and banh mi. As downtown revives, Chinatown has been sparked into life by cheap rents, the gallery boom in the 2000s and deep-rooted sense of community. Chinese bakeries and other shops continue to serve the area. Traditional Chinese restaurants that have remained are being joined by a variety of new restaurants as the opportunities Chinatown offers is recognized by additional restaurateurs. The area is better served by transit than many areas with Union Station so close by. Even though low-income seniors remain, college graduates can find their first apartment here and condos are becoming available for the affluent. This economic diversity encourages a diversity of places to serve the area.

Two of Chinatown&#x27;s restaurants highlight the history and diversity of this neighborhood.
* Philippe&#x27;s has been located on the corner of Alameda Street, at the edge of Chinatown, in the Historical District of Los Angeles since 1951, and is known as one of the creators of the French Dip sandwich.
* Little Joe&#x27;s, demolished in January 2014, had long stood at the corner of Broadway and College Street. It closed in December 1998 due to the expense of retrofitting the building to meet earthquake standards. The interior was left unchanged and it has been used as a filming location.

== Parks and recreation ==
* Los Angeles State Historic Park, also known as the Cornfield, consists of a long open space between Spring Street and the tracks of the Metro A Line.
* Alpine Recreation Center, at 817 Yale Street, has a combined and multipurpose room with a capacity of 250. Two indoor gymnasiums have capacities of 450 each. There are also basketball courts (lighted/indoor/outdoor), a children&#x27;s play area and volleyball courts (lighted).

==Nomenclature==

The words Los Angeles Chinatown are written and pronounced as follows as () in Cantonese, () in Mandarin Chinese or officially known as ().

==Events==

Events that have been held or are planned in Los Angeles&#x27;s Chinatown include:

• Chinese New Year Parade

• Lantern festival at the Chinese American Museum

• The Firecracker Run and Fun Walk

• Mid-autumn Moon Festival

• Miss Los Angeles Chinatown Pageant

A midnight firecracker display occurs every Chinese New Year&#x27;s Eve at Thien Hau Temple and Xuan Wu San Buddhist Association.

==Education==

According to U.S. Census data, 20.2% of Chinatown residents aged 25 and older possessed a four-year degree in 2023. There are three schools operating within Chinatown. They are:
* Endeavor College Preparatory Charter School, middle, 126 Bloom Street
* Castelar Street Elementary School, LAUSD, 840 Yale Street; second oldest school in the district
* Cathedral High School, a private Catholic boys&#x27; school, just down the hill from Dodger Stadium, is located on the north side of Chinatown. 
* Evans Community Adult School - largest stand-alone ESL adult school in the nation
Los Angeles Public Library operates the Chinatown Branch.

==Transportation==

Chinatown is served by the A Line of the city&#x27;s Metro Rail. The station was formerly serviced by the, now defunct, L Line; parts of Old Chinatown were uncovered during excavation for another portion of the L.A. subway (the Red Line connection to Union Station). The Metro Rail station in Chinatown has been described as a spectacular pagoda-themed facility and as a cliché of neo-pagoda architecture by Christopher Hawthorne, the Los Angeles Times architecture critic.

==Filming==
Chinatown has served as the setting for many Hollywood films. The conclusion of the film &quot;Chinatown&quot; was filmed on Spring Street. The movie &quot;Rush Hour&quot; was filmed on location in Chinatown.

<text>Tholins (after the Greek (&quot;&quot;) &quot;hazy&quot; or &quot;muddy&quot;; from the ancient Greek word meaning &quot;sepia ink&quot;) are a wide variety of organic compounds formed by solar ultraviolet or cosmic ray irradiation of simple carbon-containing compounds such as carbon dioxide (), methane () or ethane (), often in combination with nitrogen () or water (). Tholins are disordered polymer-like materials made of repeating chains of linked subunits and complex combinations of functional groups, typically nitriles and hydrocarbons, and their degraded forms such as amines and phenyls. Tholins do not form naturally on modern-day Earth, but they are found in great abundance on the surfaces of icy bodies in the outer Solar System, and as reddish aerosols in the atmospheres of outer Solar System planets and moons. 

In the presence of water, tholins could be raw materials for prebiotic chemistry (i.e., the non-living chemistry that forms the basic chemicals of which life is made). Their existence has implications for the origins of life on Earth and possibly on other planets. As particles in an atmosphere, tholins scatter light, and can affect habitability.

Tholins may be produced in a laboratory, and are usually studied as a heterogeneous mixture of many chemicals with many different structures and properties. Using techniques like thermogravimetric analysis, astrochemists analyze the composition of these tholin mixtures, and the exact character of the individual chemicals within them.

==Overview==
The term &quot;tholin&quot; was coined by astronomer Carl Sagan and his colleague Bishun Khare to describe the difficult-to-characterize substances they obtained in his Miller–Urey-type experiments on the methane-containing gas mixtures such as those found in Titan&#x27;s atmosphere. Their paper proposing the name &quot;tholin&quot; said:
For the past decade we have been producing in our laboratory a variety of complex organic solids from mixtures of the cosmically abundant gases , , , , HCHO, and . The product, synthesized by ultraviolet (UV) light or spark discharge, is a brown, sometimes sticky, residue, which has been called, because of its resistance to conventional analytical chemistry, &quot;intractable polymer&quot;. [...] We propose, as a model-free descriptive term, &#x27;tholins&#x27; (Greek Θολός, muddy; but also Θόλος, vault or dome), although we were tempted by the phrase &#x27;star-tar&#x27;.

Tholins are not one specific compound but rather are descriptive of a spectrum of molecules, including heteropolymers, that give a reddish, organic surface covering on certain planetary surfaces. Tholins are disordered polymer-like materials made of repeating chains of linked subunits and complex combinations of functional groups. Sagan and Khare note &quot;The properties of tholins will depend on the energy source used and the initial abundances of precursors, but a general physical and chemical similarity among the various tholins is evident.&quot;

Some researchers in the field prefer a narrowed definition of tholins, for example S. Hörst wrote: &quot;Personally, I try to use the word &#x27;tholins&#x27; only when describing the laboratory-produced samples, in part because we do not really know yet how similar the material we produce in the lab is to the material found on places like Titan or Triton (or Pluto!).&quot; French researchers also use the term tholins only when describing the laboratory-produced samples as analogues. NASA scientists also prefer the word &#x27;tholin&#x27; for the products of laboratory simulations, and use the term &#x27;refractory residues&#x27; for actual observations on astronomical bodies.

==Formation==

===Artificially===
The key elements of tholins are carbon, nitrogen, and hydrogen. Laboratory infrared spectroscopy analysis of experimentally synthesized tholins has confirmed earlier identifications of chemical groups present, including primary amines, nitriles, and alkyl portions such as / forming complex disordered macromolecular solids. Laboratory tests generated complex solids formed from exposure of : gaseous mixtures to electrical discharge in cold plasma conditions, reminiscent of the famous Miller–Urey experiment conducted in 1952.

===Naturally===
As illustrated to the right, tholins are thought to form in nature through a chain of chemical reactions known as pyrolysis and radiolysis. This begins with the dissociation and ionization of molecular nitrogen () and methane () by energetic particles and solar radiation. This is followed by the formation of ethylene, ethane, acetylene, hydrogen cyanide, and other small simple molecules and small positive ions. Further reactions form benzene and other organic molecules, and their polymerization leads to the formation of an aerosol of heavier molecules, which then condense and precipitate on the planetary surface below.

Tholins formed at low pressure tend to contain nitrogen atoms in the interior of their molecules, while tholins formed at high pressure are more likely to have nitrogen atoms located in terminal positions.

Tholins may be a major constituent of the interstellar medium. On Titan, their chemistry is initiated at high altitudes and participates in the formation of solid organic particles. 

These atmospherically-derived substances are distinct from &quot;ice tholin II&quot;, which are formed instead by irradiation (radiolysis) of clathrates of water and organic compounds such as methane () or ethane (). The radiation-induced synthesis on ice are independent of temperature.

Models show that, even when far from UV radiation of a star, cosmic ray doses may be fully sufficient to convert carbon-containing ice grains entirely to complex organics in less than the lifetime of the typical interstellar cloud.

==Biological significance==
Some researchers have speculated that Earth may have been seeded by organic compounds early in its development by tholin-rich comets, providing the raw material necessary for life to develop. (See Miller–Urey experiment for discussion.) Tholins do not exist naturally on present-day Earth due to the oxidizing properties of the free oxygen component of its atmosphere ever since the Great Oxygenation Event around 2.4 billion years ago.

Laboratory experiments suggest that tholins near large pools of liquid water that might persist for thousands of years could facilitate the formation of prebiotic chemistry to take place, and has implications for the origins of life on Earth and possibly other planets. Also, as particles in the atmosphere of an exoplanet, tholins affect the light scatter and act as a screen for protecting planetary surfaces from ultraviolet radiation, affecting habitability. Laboratory simulations found derived residues related to amino acids as well as urea, with important astrobiological implications.

On Earth, a wide variety of soil bacteria are able to use laboratory-produced tholins as their sole source of carbon. Tholins could have been the first microbial food for heterotrophic microorganisms before autotrophy evolved.

==Occurrence==

Sagan and Khare note the presence of tholins through multiple locations: &quot;as a constituent of the Earth&#x27;s primitive oceans and therefore relevant to the origin of life; as a component of red aerosols in the atmospheres of the outer planets and Titan; present in comets, carbonaceous chondrites asteroids, and pre-planetary solar nebulae; and as a major constituent of the interstellar medium.&quot; The surfaces of comets, centaurs, and many icy moons and Kuiper-belt objects in the outer Solar System are rich in deposits of tholins.

===Moons===
====Titan====
Titan tholins are nitrogen-rich organic substances produced by the irradiation of the gaseous mixtures of nitrogen and methane found in the atmosphere and surface of Titan. Titan&#x27;s atmosphere is about 97% nitrogen, 2.7±0.1% methane and the remaining trace amounts of other gases. In the case of Titan, the haze and orange-red color of its atmosphere are both thought to be caused by the presence of tholins.

====Europa====

Colored regions on Jupiter&#x27;s satellite Europa are thought to be tholins. The morphology of Europa&#x27;s impact craters and ridges is suggestive of fluidized material welling up from the fractures where pyrolysis and radiolysis take place. In order to generate colored tholins on Europa there must be a source of materials (carbon, nitrogen, and water), and a source of energy to drive the reactions. Impurities in the water ice crust of Europa are presumed both to emerge from the interior as cryovolcanic events that resurface the body, and to accumulate from space as interplanetary dust.

====Rhea====

The extensive dark areas on the trailing hemisphere of Saturn&#x27;s moon Rhea are thought to be deposited tholins.

====Triton====
Neptune&#x27;s moon Triton is observed to have the reddish color characteristic of tholins. Triton&#x27;s atmosphere is mostly nitrogen, with trace amounts of methane and carbon monoxide.

===Dwarf planets===
====Pluto====
Tholins occur on the dwarf planet Pluto and are responsible for red colors as well as the blue tint of the atmosphere of Pluto. The reddish-brown cap of the north pole of Charon, the largest of five moons of Pluto, is thought to be composed of tholins, produced from methane, nitrogen and related gases released from the atmosphere of Pluto and transferred over about distance to the orbiting moon.

====Ceres====
Tholins were detected on the dwarf planet Ceres by the &quot;Dawn&quot; mission. Most of the planet&#x27;s surface is extremely rich in carbon, with approximately 20% carbon by mass in its near surface. The carbon content is more than five times higher than in carbonaceous chondrite meteorites analyzed on Earth.

====Makemake====
Makemake exhibits methane, large amounts of ethane and tholins, as well as smaller amounts of ethylene, acetylene and high-mass alkanes may be present, most likely created by photolysis of methane by solar radiation.

===Kuiper belt objects and Centaurs===
The reddish color typical of tholins is characteristic of many Trans-Neptunian objects, including plutinos in the outer Solar System such as 28978 Ixion. Spectral reflectances of Centaurs also suggest the presence of tholins on their surfaces. The &quot;New Horizons&quot; exploration of the classical Kuiper belt object 486958 Arrokoth revealed reddish color at its surface, suggestive of tholins.

===Comets and asteroids===
Tholins were detected &quot;in situ&quot; by the &quot;Rosetta&quot; mission to comet 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko. Tholins are not typically characteristic of main-belt asteroids, but have been detected on the asteroid 24 Themis.

===Tholins beyond the Solar System===

Tholins might have also been detected in the stellar system of the young star HR 4796A using the Near-Infrared Camera and Multi-Object Spectrometer (NICMOS) aboard the Hubble Space Telescope. The HR 4796 system is approximately 220 light years from Earth.

<text>Zurab Avalishvili (; 1876 – May 21, 1944) was a Georgian historian, jurist and diplomat in the service of the Democratic Republic of Georgia. 

==Biography==
Avalishvili was born in Tbilisi, Georgia (then part of the Russian Empire), into the family of Prince David Avalishvili. He graduated from St. Petersburg University in 1900 and, from 1900 to 1903, took post-graduate courses at the University of Paris Department of Law. He became a Docent at the St. Petersburg University in 1904 and a Professor of Public Law at the St. Petersburg Polytechnical Institute in 1907. He was an adviser to the Russian Ministry of Trade and Commerce for many years. 

After the February Revolution in Russia, Avalishvili was named a Senator by the Provisional Government in May 1917. However, when Georgia declared independence on May 26, 1918, Avalishvili returned to his homeland and entered the Georgian diplomatic service, becoming Georgia&#x27;s Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs. He conducted important diplomatic work for the country as a member of the Georgian delegation to the 1919 Paris Peace Conference. 

The Red Army invasion of Georgia forced Avalishvili into exile in March 1921. He lived thereafter in Germany, where he worked as a Professor at the University of Munich. He was one of the founding members of the Georgian Association in Germany and worked for the editorial boards of historical journals &quot;Georgica&quot; (London) and &quot;Byzantion&quot; (Brussels). He died in 1944, in Germany but was repatried and buried at the Didube Pantheon, Tbilisi, in 1994. 

==Academic workds==
Avalishvili’s main works focuses on the history of Georgia and the Caucasus, Georgian literature (e.g., the critical studies of Shota Rustaveli), international law and Georgia’s foreign relations. His &quot;The Independence of Georgia in International Politics, 1918-1921&quot; is a detailed and well-documented first-hand account of Georgia’s relations with its neighbors, the nation’s struggle for recognition and its international ramifications in the period of 1918 to 1921. Much of the works is in diary form, the author being judiciously critical of ineptitude of the Caucasian governments.

Some of the main works by Zurab Avalishvili include:
* &quot;Joining of Georgia to Russia&quot; (a monograph), St.Petersburg, 1901, 1906 (in Russian)
* &quot;The Independence of Georgia in the International Politics of 1918–1921&quot; (a monograph), Tbilisi, 1925

<text>Rattlesnakes are venomous snakes that form the genera &quot;Crotalus&quot; and &quot;Sistrurus&quot; of the subfamily Crotalinae (the pit vipers). All rattlesnakes are vipers. Rattlesnakes are predators that live in a wide array of habitats, hunting small animals such as birds and rodents.

Rattlesnakes receive their name from the rattle located at the end of their tails, which makes a loud rattling noise when vibrated that deters predators. Rattlesnakes are the leading contributor to snakebite injuries in North America, but rarely bite unless provoked or threatened; if treated promptly, the bites are seldom fatal.

The 36 known species of rattlesnakes have between 65 and 70 subspecies, all native to the Americas, ranging from central Argentina to southern Canada. The largest rattlesnake, the eastern diamondback, can measure up to in length.

Rattlesnakes are preyed upon by hawks, weasels, kingsnakes, and a variety of other species. Rattlesnakes are heavily preyed upon as neonates, while they are still weak and immature. Large numbers of rattlesnakes are killed by humans. Rattlesnake populations in many areas are severely threatened by habitat destruction, poaching, and extermination campaigns.

== Etymology ==

The scientific name &quot;Crotalus&quot; is derived from the Greek κρόταλον, meaning &quot;castanet&quot;. The name &quot;Sistrurus&quot; is the Latinized form of the Greek word for &quot;tail rattler&quot; (Σείστρουρος, &quot;seistrouros&quot;) and shares its root with the ancient Egyptian musical instrument the sistrum, a type of rattle.

== Ecology ==
=== Range and habitat ===

Rattlesnakes are native to the Americas from southern Canada to central Argentina, with the majority of species inhabiting arid regions. The large majority of species live in the American Southwest and Mexico. Four species may be found east of the Mississippi River, and two in South America. In the United States, the state with the most types of rattlesnakes is Arizona, with 13.

Rattlesnakes are found in almost every habitat type capable of supporting terrestrial ectothermic vertebrates, but individual species may have extremely specific habitat requirements, living where certain plant associations occur or within a narrow range of elevations. Most species live near open, rocky areas. Rocks offer them cover from predators, plentiful prey (e.g. rodents, lizards, insects, etc. that live amidst the rocks), and open basking areas. However, rattlesnakes can also be found in a wide variety of other habitats, including prairies, marshes, deserts, and forests. Rattlesnakes prefer a temperature range between , but can survive temperatures below freezing, recovering from brief exposure to temperatures as low as , and surviving for several days in temperatures as low as .

The most probable ancestral area of rattlesnakes is the Sierra Madre Occidental region in Mexico. The most probable vegetation or habitat of the ancestral area appears to be pine-oak forests.

=== Prey ===
Rattlesnakes typically consume mice, rats, rabbits, squirrels, small birds, and other small animals. They lie in wait for their prey, or hunt for it in holes. The rattlesnake&#x27;s defence and hunting mechanisms are bound to its physiology and its environment. More importantly environmental temperature can influence the ability of ectotherms. The prey is killed quickly with a venomous bite as opposed to constriction. If the bitten prey moves away before dying, the rattlesnake can follow it by its scent. When it locates the fallen prey, it checks for signs of life by prodding with its snout, flicking its tongue, and using its sense of smell. Once the prey has become incapacitated, the rattlesnake locates its head by odors emitted from the mouth. The prey is then ingested head first, which allows wings and limbs to fold at the joints in a manner that minimizes the girth of the meal. The gastric fluids of rattlesnakes are extremely powerful, allowing for the digestion of flesh and bone. Optimal digestion occurs when the snake maintains a body temperature between . If the prey is small, the rattlesnake often continues hunting. If the meal was adequate, the snake finds a warm, safe location in which to coil up and rest until the prey is digested. Feeding habits play an important ecological role by limiting the size of rodent populations, which prevents crop damage and stabilizes ecosystems.

===Hydration===
Rattlesnakes are believed to require at least their own body weight in water annually to remain hydrated. The method by which they drink depends on the water source. In larger bodies of water (streams, ponds, etc.), they submerge their heads and ingest water by opening and closing their jaws, which sucks in water. If drinking dew or small puddles, they sip the liquid either by capillary action or by flattening and flooding their lower jaws.

In desert environments, scientists observe that rattlesnakes have evolved to stay hydrated by coiling up and flattening so that their bodies can collect rain. In some instances, they aggregated in a carpet-like formation to make a larger rain-collecting platform.

=== Predators ===
Newborn rattlesnakes are heavily preyed upon by a variety of species, including cats, ravens, crows, roadrunners, raccoons, opossums, skunks, coyotes, weasels, whipsnakes, kingsnakes, and racers. Young of the smaller crotaline species are frequently killed and eaten by small predatory birds, such as jays, kingfishers, and shrikes. Some species of ants in the genus &quot;Formica&quot; are known to prey upon neonates, and &quot;Solenopsis invicta&quot; (fire ants) likely do, as well. On occasion, hungry adult rattlesnakes cannibalize neonates. The small proportion (often as few as 20%) of rattlesnakes that make it to their second year are heavily preyed upon by a variety of larger predators, including coyotes, eagles, hawks, owls, falcons, feral pigs, badgers, indigo snakes, and kingsnakes.

The common kingsnake (&quot;Lampropeltis getula&quot;), a constrictor, is immune to the venom of rattlesnakes and other vipers, and rattlesnakes form part of its natural diet. Rattlesnakes sense kingsnakes&#x27; presence by their odor. When they realize a kingsnake is nearby, they begin enacting a set of defensive postures known as &quot;body bridging&quot;. Unlike its normal erect and coiled defensive-striking posture, the rattlesnake keeps its head low to the ground in an attempt to prevent the kingsnake from gaining a hold on it (the head being the first part of the rattlesnake to be ingested). The rattlesnake jerks its body about, while bridging its back upwards, forming an elevated coil that faces the kingsnake. The elevated coil is used to strike the attacker, and is also used to shield the head from the kingsnake.

== Anatomy ==

=== Sensory organs ===
Like all pit vipers, rattlesnakes have two organs that can sense radiation; their eyes and a set of heat-sensing &quot;pits&quot; on their faces that enable them to locate prey and move towards it, based on the prey&#x27;s thermal radiation signature. These pits have a relatively short effective range of about but give the rattlesnake a distinct advantage in hunting for warm-blooded creatures at night.

==== Heat-sensing pits ====

Aside from their eyes, rattlesnakes are able to detect thermal radiation emitted by warm-blooded organisms in their environment. Functioning optically like a pinhole camera eye, thermal radiation in the form of infrared light passes through the opening of the pit and strikes the pit membrane located in the back wall, warming this part of the organ. Due to the high density of heat-sensitive receptors innervating this membrane, the rattlesnake can detect temperature changes of 0.003 °C or less in its immediate surroundings. Infrared cues from these receptors are transmitted to the brain by the trigeminal nerve, where they are used to create thermal maps of the snake&#x27;s surroundings. Due to the small sizes of the pit openings, typically these thermal images are low in resolution and contrast. Nevertheless, rattlesnakes superimpose visual images created from information from the eyes with these thermal images from the pit organs to more accurately visualize their surroundings in low levels of light. Research conducted recently on the molecular mechanism of this ability suggests the temperature sensitivity of these pit organs is closely linked to the activity of transient receptor potential ankyrin 1, a temperature-sensitive ion channel saturated in the pit membrane.

==== Eyes ====

Rattlesnake eyes, which contain many rod cells, are well adapted to nocturnal use. Rattlesnakes, though, are not exclusively nocturnal, and their vision is more acute during daylight conditions. Rattlesnakes also possess cone cells, which means they are capable of some form of color vision. The rattlesnake eye lacks a fovea, making vision of sharply defined images impossible. Instead, they mostly rely on the perception of movement. Rattlesnake eyes are capable of horizontal rotation, but they do not appear to move their eyeballs to follow moving objects.

==== Smell ====

Rattlesnakes have an exceptionally keen sense of smell. They can sense olfactory stimuli both through their nostrils and by flicking their tongues, which carry scent-bearing particles to the Jacobson&#x27;s organs in the roof of their mouths.

==== Auditory system ====

Like all snakes, rattlesnakes lack external ear openings, and the structures of their middle ear are not as highly specialized as those of other vertebrates, such as mammals. Thus, their sense of hearing is not very effective, but they are capable of sensing vibrations in the ground, passed by the skeleton to the auditory nerve.

=== Fangs ===
Rattlesnake fangs are connected by venom ducts to large venom glands near the outer edge of the upper jaw, towards the rear of the head. When the rattlesnake bites, muscles on the sides of the venom glands contract to squeeze the venom through the ducts and into the fangs. When the fangs are not in use, they remain folded against the palate.

Rattlesnakes are born with fully functioning fangs and venom, and are capable of killing prey at birth. Adult rattlesnakes shed their fangs every 6–10 weeks. At least three pairs of replacement fangs lie behind the functional pair.

=== Venom ===
Rattlesnake venom is hemotoxic, destroying tissue, causing necrosis and coagulopathy (disrupted blood clotting). In the U.S., the tiger rattlesnake (&quot;C. tigris&quot;) and some varieties of the Mojave rattlesnake (&quot;C. scutulatus&quot;) also have a presynaptic neurotoxic venom component known as Mojave type A toxin, which can cause severe paralysis. However, most North American rattlesnakes are not neurotoxic. Although it has a comparatively low venom yield, the venom toxicity of &quot;C. tigris&quot; is considered to be among the highest of all rattlesnake venoms, and among the highest of all snakes in the Western Hemisphere based on studies conducted on laboratory mice. &quot;C. scutulatus&quot; is also widely regarded as producing one of the most toxic snake venoms in the Americas, based on studies in laboratory mice.

Rattlesnake venom is a mixture of five to fifteen enzymes, various metal ions, biogenic amines, lipids, free amino acids, proteins, and polypeptides. More specifically, there are three main families of toxins in rattlesnakes: phospholipases A2 (PLA2s), snake venom metalloproteinases (SVMPs), and snake venom serine proteinases (SVSPs). It contains components meant to immobilize and disable the prey, as well as digestive enzymes, which break down tissue to prepare for later ingestion. The venom is very stable, and retains its toxicity for many years in storage.

Snake venom, in general, has a complex and ongoing evolutionary process, and rattlesnake venom is no different. The primary mechanisms of evolution are both gene duplication and gene loss events. The duplication events provided material for neofunctionalization to create the novel toxin genes, while gene loss influenced speciation and helped lead to such a wide variety of “chemical cocktails” in rattlesnake venoms. The prevailing theory for the driving force of this evolution is directional selection, where efficacy on prey is selected for. Diversity in prey leads to less specificity in toxins, while highly specialized toxins are more likely to develop when there are few key prey species. However, recently, balancing selection has been indicated to better explain the maintenance of adaptive genetic diversity in venom-related genes, potentially allowing for the rattlesnakes to better keep up in the evolutionary arms race with their prey.

Older snakes possess more potent venom, and larger snakes are frequently capable of storing larger volumes of it.

=== Rattle ===

The rattle serves as a warning for predators of the rattlesnake. The rattle is composed of a series of hollow, interlocked segments made of keratin, which are created by modifying the scales that cover the tip of the tail. The contraction of special &quot;shaker&quot; muscles in the tail causes these segments to vibrate against one another, thus making the rattling noise (which is amplified because the segments are hollow) in a behavior known as tail vibration. The muscles which cause rattling are some of the fastest known, firing 50 times per second on average, sustainable for a duration of up to three hours.

In 2016, Allf et al. published a paper proposing behavioral plasticity as the mechanism by which the rattling system evolved in rattlesnakes. In the case of rattlesnakes, Allf et al. proposed that tail vibration in response to predator threat could be the precursor for the rattling system in rattlesnakes, an example of behavioral plasticity. To investigate this hypothesis, the researchers analyzed tail vibration and relatedness to rattlesnakes among snakes in the families Viperidae and Colubridae. Their results demonstrated that the more closely related a species was to rattlesnakes, the more similar that species was to rattlesnakes in both duration and rate of tail vibration. These results strongly support the hypothesis that tail vibration preceded the rattling system as a behavior and allowed for the rattle to be selected for once developed. Even a small, underdeveloped rattle early in the evolution of the rattling system could have been advantageous if tail vibration was an ancestral behavior.

At birth, a &quot;prebutton&quot; is present at the tip of the snake&#x27;s tail; it is replaced by the &quot;button&quot; several days later when the first skin is shed. However, no sound can be made by the rattle until a second segment is added when the skin is shed again. A new rattle segment is added each time the snake sheds its skin, and the snake may shed its skin several times a year, depending on food supply and growth rate.

Rattlesnakes travel with their rattles held up to protect them from damage, but in spite of this precaution, their day-to-day activities in the wild still cause them to regularly break off end segments. Because of this, the number of rattles on its tail is not related to the age of a rattlesnake.

Compared to females, males have thicker and longer tails (because they contain the inverted hemipenes). Also, the tails of males taper gradually from the body, whereas the tails of females narrow abruptly at the vent.

=== Skin and circulation ===
Rattlesnakes, like other members of the Squamata order, have a circulatory system that is powered by a three-chambered heart composed of two atria and one ventricle. The right atrium receives deoxygenated blood from veins coming from the systemic circuit. The left atrium receives oxygenated blood from the lungs in the pulmonary circuit and pumps it to the ventricle and through the systemic circuit via capillaries and arteries.

Rattlesnake skin has a set of overlapping scales that cover the entire body, providing protection from a variety of threats, including dehydration and physical trauma. The typical rattlesnake, genus &quot;Crotalus&quot;, has the top of its head covered with small scales, except, with a few species, a few crowded plates directly over the snout. The skin of snakes is highly sensitive to contact, tension, and pressure; they are capable of feeling pain.

An important function of the skin is the sensation of changes in air temperature, which can guide the snakes towards warm basking/shelter locations. All snakes are ectotherms. To maintain a stable body temperature, they exchange heat with their external environments. Snakes often move into open, sunny areas to absorb heat from the sun and warmed earth, a behavior known as basking. Nerves in the skin regulate the flow of blood into the veins near the surface.

The skin of rattlesnakes is intricately patterned in a manner that camouflages them from their predators. Rattlesnakes do not generally have bright or showy colors (reds, yellows, blues, etc.), instead relying on subtle earth tones that resemble the surrounding environment.

Creases in the epidermal tissue connect the scales of rattlesnakes. When ingesting large prey, these creases can unfold, allowing the skin to expand to envelop a much greater volume. The skin appears to tightly stretch to accommodate the meal, but in reality, the skin is simply smoothing out from its creased state and is not under very high tension.

== Reproduction ==
Most rattlesnake species mate during the summer or fall, while some species mate only in the spring, or during both the spring and fall.

Females secrete small amounts of sex pheromones, which leave a trail the males follow using their tongues and Jacobson&#x27;s organs as guides. Once a receptive female has been located, the male often spends several days following her around (a behavior not common outside of the mating season), frequently touching and rubbing her in an attempt to stimulate her.

The males of some species, such as timber rattlesnakes (&quot;C. horridus&quot;), fight each other during the mating season, in competition over females. These fights, known as &quot;combat dances&quot;, consist of the two males intertwining the anterior portion of their bodies, often with their heads and necks held vertically. The larger males usually end up driving the smaller males away.

Although many kinds of snakes and other reptiles are oviparous (lay eggs), rattlesnakes are ovoviviparous (give birth to live young after carrying eggs inside). The female produces the ova (&quot;eggs&quot;) in her ovaries, after which they pass through her body cavity and into one of her two oviducts. The ova are arranged in a continuous chain in a coiled section of the oviduct, known as the &quot;tuba&quot;. Male rattlesnakes have sexual organs known as hemipenes, located in the base of the tail. The hemipenis is retracted inside of the body when mating is not occurring. The hemipenis is similar to the human penis. Females can store semen for months in internal recesses known as spermathecae, which permits them to mate during the fall, but not fertilize the ova until the following spring. The Arizona black rattlesnake (&quot;C. oreganus cerberus&quot;), has been observed to exhibit complex social behavior reminiscent of that in mammals. Females often remain with their young in nests for several weeks, and mothers have been observed co-operatively parenting their broods.

Rattlesnakes generally take several years to mature, and females usually reproduce only once every three years.

== Brumation ==
In the colder winter months, some rattlesnake species enter a period of brumation, which is dormancy similar to hibernation.
They often gather together for brumation in large numbers (sometimes over 1,000 snakes), huddling together inside underground &quot;rattlesnake dens&quot; or hibernacula. They regularly share their winter burrows with a wide variety of other species (such as turtles, small mammals, invertebrates, and other types of snakes).

Rattlesnakes often return to the same den, year after year, sometimes traveling several miles to get there. How the rattlesnakes find their way back to the dens each year is unknown, but may involve a combination of pheromone trails and visual cues (e.g., topography, celestial navigation, and solar orientation).

Species with long periods of brumation tend to have much lower reproductive rates than those with shorter brumation periods or those that do not brumate at all. Female timber rattlesnakes in high peaks in the Appalachian Mountains of New England reproduce every three years on average; the lance-headed rattlesnake (&quot;C. polystictus&quot;), native to the warm climate of Mexico, reproduces annually.

Like most other snakes, rattlesnakes aestivate during very hot or dry periods, which is why they are rarely seen during the hottest and driest months of summer.

== Conservation status ==
Rattlesnakes tend to avoid developed areas, preferring undisturbed, natural habitats. Rapid habitat destruction by humans, mass killings during events such as rattlesnake round-ups, and deliberate extermination campaigns all pose threats to rattlesnake populations in many areas. Several species, such as the timber rattlesnake, massasauga, and canebrake rattlesnake, are listed as threatened or endangered in many U.S. states.

Many rattlesnakes die from being run over by cars.

In more heavily populated and trafficked areas, reports have been increasing of rattlesnakes that do not rattle. This phenomenon is falsely attributed to selective pressure by humans, who often kill the snakes when they are discovered. However, snake experts have dismissed this theory, stating that snakes simply do not rattle as often as laymen expect them to, and that snakes that live near populated areas simply get used to people passing by, only rattling when a person lingers too long or gets too close.

== Safety and first aid ==
Rattlesnakes are the leading cause of snakebite injuries in North America and a significant cause in Central and South America.

=== Avoiding bites ===
Rattlesnakes tend to avoid wide-open spaces where they cannot hide from predators, and generally avoid humans if they are aware of their approach. Rattlesnakes rarely bite unless they feel threatened or provoked. A majority of victims (about 72%) are males. Around half of bites occur in cases where the victim saw the snake, yet made no effort to move away.

Harassing or attacking a rattlesnake, illegal in some jurisdictions, puts one at much higher risk of a bite. Rattlesnakes seek to avoid humans and other predators or large herbivores that themselves pose lethal danger. Dogs, often much more aggressive than humans, are much more likely to experience a snakebite, and are more likely to die of a rattlesnake bite although they can be vaccinated against them.

Caution is advised even when snakes are believed to be dead; rattlesnake heads can sense, flick the tongue, and inflict venomous bites reflexively for up to an hour after being severed from the body.

=== Effect of bites on humans ===

An estimated 7,000 to 8,000 people are bitten by venomous snakes in the United States each year, with about five deaths. The most important factor in survival following a severe envenomation is the time elapsed between the bite and treatment. Most deaths occur between 6 and 48 hours after the bite. If antivenom treatment is given within two hours of the bite, the probability of recovery is greater than 99%.

When a bite occurs, the amount of venom injected is under voluntary control by the snake. The amount released depends on a variety of factors, including the condition of the snake (e.g., having long, healthy fangs and a full venom sack) and its temperament (an angry, hungry snake that has just been stepped on vs. a satiated snake that was merely surprised by walking near it). About 20% of bites result in no envenomation at all. A lack of burning pain and edema away from the fang marks after one hour suggests either no or minimal envenomation occurred. A lack of edema or erythema in the area of the bite after eight hours indicates a lack of envenomation for most rattlesnake bites.

Common symptoms include swelling, severe pain, tingling, weakness, anxiety, nausea and vomiting, hemorrhaging, perspiration, and (rarely) heart failure. Local pain following envenomation is often intense, increasing with the ensuing edema. Children generally experience more severe symptoms because they receive a larger amount of venom per unit of body mass.

== Antivenom ==
Antivenom, or antivenin, is commonly used to treat the effects of local and systemic pit viper envenomations. The first step in the production of crotaline antivenom is collecting (&quot;milking&quot;) the venom of a live rattlesnake—usually from the western diamondback (&quot;Crotalus atrox&quot;), eastern diamondback (&quot;Crotalus adamanteus&quot;), South American rattlesnake (&quot;Crotalus durissis terrificus&quot;), or fer-de-lance (&quot;Bothrops atrox&quot;). The extracted venom is then diluted and injected into horses, goats, or sheep, whose immune systems produce antibodies that protect from the toxic effects of the venom. These antibodies accumulate in the blood, which is then extracted and centrifuged to separate the red blood cells. The resulting serum is purified into a lyophilized powder, which is packaged for distribution and later use by human patients.

Because antivenom is derived from animal antibodies, people generally display an allergic response during infusion, known as serum sickness.

=== Veterinary care ===
In the United States, more than 15,000 domesticated animals are bitten by snakes each year. Rattlesnake envenomations account for 80% of the deadly incidents.

Dogs are most commonly bitten on the front legs and head. Horses generally receive bites on the muzzle, and cattle on their tongues and muzzles. If a domesticated animal is bitten, the hair around the bite should be removed so the wound can be clearly seen. The crotaline Fab antivenom has been shown to be effective in the treatment of canine rattlesnake bites. Symptoms include swelling, slight bleeding, sensitivity, shaking, and anxiety.

== In human culture ==

=== Spirituality ===
==== Indigenous Americans ====
Aztec paintings, Central American temples, and the great burial mounds in the Southern United States are frequently adorned with depictions of rattlesnakes, often within the symbols and emblems of the most powerful deities.

The Feathered Serpent of Mesoamerican religion was depicted as having the combined features of the quetzal and rattlesnake. The Ancient Maya considered the rattlesnake to be a &quot;vision serpent&quot; that acted as a conduit to the &quot;otherworld&quot;.

Rattlesnakes are a key element in Aztec mythology and were widely represented in Aztec art, including sculptures, jewelry, and architectural elements.

==== Christian snake-handling sects ====

Members of some Christian sects in the Southern United States are regularly bitten while participating in &quot;snake handling&quot; rituals. Snake handling is when people hold venomous snakes, unprotected, as part of a religious service inspired by a literal interpretation of the Bible verses Mark 16:17–18, which reads, &quot;In my name ... They shall take up serpents ...&quot;

=== In traditional medicine ===
Meriwether Lewis of the Lewis and Clark Expedition described in 1805 how a hired interpreter, who lived for 15 years with the Mandan, used the rattlesnake&#x27;s rattle to speed up the delivery of Sacagewea‘s son Jean Baptiste Charbonneau:


=== As food ===
Journalist Alistair Cooke claimed that rattlesnake tastes &quot;just like chicken, only tougher&quot;. Others have compared the flavor to a wide range of other meats, including veal, frog, tortoise, quail, fish, rabbit, and even canned tuna. Methods of preparation include barbecueing and frying; author Maud Newton, following a recipe by Harry Crews, described the taste, &quot;at least when breaded and fried, like a sinewy, half-starved tilapia.&quot;

=== Symbolism ===

The rattlesnake became a symbolic animal for the Colonials during the Revolutionary War period, and is depicted prominently on the Gadsden Flag. It continues to be used as a symbol by the United States military, and political movements within the United States.

<text>Baron Barnard, of Barnard Castle in the Bishopric of Durham, is a title in the Peerage of England. It was created in 1698 for Christopher Vane, who had previously served as a member of parliament for County Durham and Boroughbridge. Vane was the son of Sir Henry Vane the Younger and grandson of Sir Henry Vane the Elder. His grandson, the third Baron, notably served as Paymaster of the Forces and as Lord Lieutenant of County Durham. In 1754 he was created Viscount Barnard (of Barnard Castle) and Earl of Darlington, both in the County Palatine of Durham. Lord Darlington was the husband of Lady Grace FitzRoy, daughter of Charles FitzRoy, 2nd Duke of Cleveland, the illegitimate son of King Charles II by his mistress Barbara Villiers, 1st Duchess of Cleveland.

== Succession ==
He was succeeded by his son, the second Earl. He sat as a member of parliament for Downton and County Durham and served as Lord Lieutenant of County Durham. On his death the titles passed to his son, the third Earl. He represented Totnes and Winchelsea in Parliament and served as Lord Lieutenant of County Durham. In 1827 the Cleveland title held by his great-grandmother was recreated when he was made Marquess of Cleveland, and in 1833 the dukedom of Cleveland was also revived when he was created Baron Raby, of Raby Castle in the County of Durham, and Duke of Cleveland. In 1839 the Duke was given the additional honour of being made a Knight of the Garter.

He was succeeded by his eldest son, the second Duke. He was a general in the army and also sat as a Whig Member of Parliament for County Durham, Winchilsea and Totnes and as a Tory for Saltash and South Shropshire. When he died the titles passed to his younger brother, the third Duke. He represented Winchelsea and County Durham in the House of Commons as a Whig and St Ives and Ludlow as a Tory. In 1813 he assumed by Royal Licence his mother&#x27;s maiden name of Powlett but in 1864, on succeeding to the dukedom, he resumed by Royal Licence his patronymic Vane. He was childless and was succeeded by his younger brother, the fourth Duke. He was in the Diplomatic Service and also a Liberal Member of Parliament for South Durham and Hastings. In 1864 he assumed by Royal Licence his mother&#x27;s maiden surname of Powlett in lieu of Vane. Like his two elder brothers he was childless and on his death 1891 the barony of Raby, the viscountcy, earldom, marquessate and dukedom became extinct,

However, he was succeeded in the barony of Barnard, according to a decision by the Committee for Privileges of the House of Lords in 1892, by his distant relative Henry de Vere Vane, who became the ninth Baron. He was the great-great-grandson of Morgan Vane, younger son of the second Baron. His second son, the tenth Baron, was Lord Lieutenant of County Durham. The latter&#x27;s son, the eleventh Baron, succeeded in 1964 and served as Lord-Lieutenant of County Durham from 1970 to 1988. the title is held by the latter&#x27;s son, the twelfth Baron.

<text>A money order is a directive to pay a pre-specified amount of money from prepaid funds, making it a more trusted method of payment than a cheque.

==History==
Systems similar to modern money orders can be traced back centuries. Paper documents known as &quot;flying cash&quot; were used in China from the 800s, while the Hawala practice of informal financial remittances through a widespread system of brokers can be traced to India in the 1300s and remains common in parts of Asia and Africa.

The modern western money order system was established by a private firm in Great Britain in 1762, though due to high costs was not very successful. Around 1836 it was sold to another private firm which lowered the fees, significantly increasing the popularity and usage of the system. The Post Office noted the success and profitability, and it took over the system in 1838. Fees were further reduced and usage increased further, making the money order system reasonably profitable. The only draw-back was the need to send an advance to the paying post office before payment could be tendered to the recipient of the order. This drawback was likely the primary incentive for establishment of the Postal Order System on 1 January 1881.

==Usage==
A money order is purchased for the amount desired. In this way it is similar to a cashier&#x27;s check. The main difference is that money orders are usually limited in maximum face value to some specified figure (for example, the United States Postal Service limits domestic postal money orders to US$1,000.00 ) while cashier&#x27;s check are not. Money orders typically consist of two portions: the negotiable check for remittance to the payee (the receiver), and a receipt or stub that the customer retains for record. The amount is printed by machine or checkwriter on both portions, and similar documentation, either as a third hard copy or in electronic form and retained at the issuer and agent locations.

==Drawbacks==
Money orders have limited acceptance in the insurance and brokerage industry because of concerns over money laundering. Because of provisions within the USA PATRIOT Act and the Bank Secrecy Act, money orders have far more regulatory processing requirements than personal cheques, cashier&#x27;s cheques, or certified cheques.

==National==

===India===
In India, a money order is a service provided by the Indian Postal Service. A payer who wants to send money to a payee pays the amount and a small commission at a post office and receives a receipt for the same. The amount is then delivered as cash to the payee after a few days by a postal employee, at the address specified by the payer. A receipt from the payee is collected and delivered back to the payer at their address. This is more reliable and safer than sending cash in the mail.

It is commonly used for transferring funds to a payee who is in a remote, rural area, where banks may not be conveniently accessible or where many people may not use a bank account at all. Money orders are the most economical way of sending money in India for small amounts.

===United States===

In the United States, money orders are typically sold by third parties such as the United States Postal Service, grocery stores, and convenience stores. Some financial service companies such as banks and credit unions may not charge for money orders to their clients. Money orders remain a trusted financial instrument. However, just because a particular business can issue a money order does not necessarily mean that they will cash them. The U.S. Postal Service issues money orders for a small charge at any location.

The United States Postal Service began selling money orders as an alternative to sending currency through the postal system in order to reduce post office robberies, an idea instituted by Montgomery Blair who was Postmaster-General 1861–1864. Money orders were later offered by many more vendors than just the postal service as a means to pay bills and send money internationally where there were not reliable banking or postal systems. Companies that now offer money orders include 7-11, QuikTrip, Cumberland Farms, Safeway, Western Union, MoneyGram, CVS, Wal-Mart, and 3T Solutions.

Obtaining a money order in the United States is simple, as they can be purchased at any post office, and are sold at many other locations.
The US Postal Service&#x27;s international money orders are accepted in 29 countries.

==International==
An international money order is very similar in many aspects to a regular money order except that it can be used to make payments abroad. With it, a buyer can easily pay a seller for goods or services if they reside in another country. International money orders are often issued by a buyer&#x27;s bank and bought in the currency that the seller accepts. International money orders are thought to be safer than sending currency through the post because there are various forms of identification required to cash an international money order, often including a signature and a form of photo identification.

When purchasing an international money order, it is important to ensure that the specific type of money order is acceptable in the destination country. Several countries are very strict that the money order be on pink and yellow paper and bear the words &quot;international postal money order.&quot; In particular, Japan Post (one of the largest banking institutions in the world) requires these features. Most other countries have taken this as a standard when there is any doubt of a document&#x27;s authenticity.

Foreign workers often use this method for reliably sending money &quot;home.&quot;

==Alternatives==
In the last decade, a number of electronic alternatives to money orders have emerged and have, in some cases, supplanted money orders as the preferred cash transmission method. Many of these alternatives use the ubiquitous Visa/MasterCard payment systems to settle transactions. In Japan, the konbini system enables cash to cash transfers and is available at many of the thousands of convenience stores located in the country. In Italy, the PostePay system is offered through the Italian post office. In Ireland, 3V is offered through mobile top-up locations. In the United States, PaidByCash is offered at 60,000 grocery and convenience stores. In Bangladesh, mobile banking services enable electronic transfer of money as well as retail transactions.
In the United Kingdom, a number of credit card providers have started to provide pre-paid credit cards. These cards can be &quot;topped-up&quot; at any location that uses the Pay-Point system and also at the Post Office for the Post Office card. PayPal has their own branded pre-paid card which can be &quot;topped-up&quot; using a PayPal account or Pay-Points.

<text>Simon Janashia (; July 13, 1900 – November 5, 1947) was a Georgian historian and public figure. He was a professor of history and one of the founding members of the Georgian Academy of Sciences.

Janashia was born in 1900, in Makvaneti in the southwestern Georgian province of Guria. His father, Nikoloz Janashia (1872-1918), was an educator and ethnographer, born in Abkhazia. In 1922, Simon Janashia graduated from the Tbilisi State University. From 1924 to 1947, he served as a lecturer (1924-1930), Associate Professor (1930-1935) and Professor (1935-1947) there. In 1941, he was one of the founders of the Georgian Academy of Sciences (GAS), and from 1941 to 1947, he was Vice-President of the Academy and Director of the Institute of History of the GAS. In 1943, Janashia was elected as a member of the Academy of Sciences of the Soviet Union (now the Russian Academy of Science). In the 1940s, he organized archaeological excavations in Mtskheta and Armazi in eastern Georgia.

Janashia&#x27;s main fields of his research were the ethnogenesis of the Georgians and other Caucasian peoples, the history of feudalism in Georgia and the Caucasus, the history and archaeology of ancient Georgia, the history of Colchis and Caucasian Iberia, the history of Christianity in Georgia, and source studies of the history of Georgia and the Caucasus. He was an author of more than 100 scholarly works, including about 10 monographs. A full collection of Janashia&#x27;s works was published in four volumes in Tbilisi between 1949 and 1968. Simon Janashia died in Tbilisi in 1947.

<text>Baron Berners is a barony created by writ in the Peerage of England.

==From creation to first abeyance (1455–1693) ==

The barony was created in 1455 for Sir John Bourchier, youngest son of William Bourchier, 1st Count of Eu, and younger brother of Henry Bourchier, 1st Earl of Essex and of William Bourchier, 9th Baron FitzWarin (from whom the Bourchier Earls of Bath descended). He married Margery Berners, daughter of Sir Richard Berners. The peerage is so ancient as to have been established by writ, and thus can descend through both male and female lines (in the absence of an official grant of remainder). He was succeeded by his grandson John Bourchier, 2nd Baron Berners, who served as Chancellor of the Exchequer between 1516 and 1527 and is well known in literature as &quot;Lord Berners&quot;, having made a well-regarded English translation of Froissart&#x27;s Chronicles.
He died without male progeny and was thus succeeded by his daughter Jane Bourchier, wife of Sir Edmund Knyvett and &quot;de jure&quot; 3rd Baroness Berners, although she never assumed the title. Her grandson Thomas Knyvett, the &quot;de jure&quot; 4th Baron, received a writ of summons in this title but died before obtaining the King&#x27;s confirmation. His great-great-grandson Sir Thomas Knyvett, the &quot;de jure&quot; 7th Baron Berners, sat as a Member of Parliament for Dunwich and Eyre. On his death in 1693 the peerage fell into abeyance between his two sisters, Elizabeth Knyvett, wife of Sir Thomas Glemham, and Katherine Knyvett, wife firstly of John Harris and secondly of Richard Bokenham.

==From restoration to death of 14th Baron (1711–1950)==
The barony by writ of summons remained in abeyance until 1711, when, on the death of Sir Thomas Glenham, only child of Elizabeth Glenham (&quot;see above&quot;), the peerage title devolved on the aforementioned Katherine Bokenham, who became the &quot;de jure&quot; eighth holder.

In 1720 she was confirmed by the House of Lords as 8th Baroness Berners. However, on her death in 1743 the barony again fell into abeyance, this time between the heirs of the sisters Elizabeth Knyvett (wife of Henry Wilson) and Lucy Knyvett (wife firstly of Thomas Holt and secondly of John Field), both great-granddaughters of Thomas Knyvett, younger brother of John Knyvett, 6th Baron Berners. This time the peerage remained in abeyance for 89 years, until the abeyance was terminated in 1832 in favour of Robert Wilson, who became the ninth Baron. He was the grandson of Elizabeth Knyvett. He was succeeded by his younger brother, the tenth Baron. When he died the title passed to his son, the eleventh Baron.

He died childless and was succeeded by his niece Harriet Tyrwhitt, the twelfth Baroness. She was the daughter of Hon. Robert Wilson, younger son of the tenth Baron, and wife of Sir Henry Thomas Tyrwhitt, 3rd Baronet (see below for earlier history of this title). She was succeeded by her son, the thirteenth Baron. In 1892 he assumed by Royal Licence the additional surname of Wilson and in 1894 succeeded his father as the fourth baronet, of Stanley Hall; he did not marry and was succeeded by his nephew, the fourteenth Baron, a writer, painter and composer of classical music. He also never married and on his death in 1950 the baronetcy became extinct.

==Tyrwhitt baronetcy==
The Tyrwhitt baronetcy, of Stanley Hall in the County of Shropshire, was created in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom on 3 October 1808 for Thomas Tyrwhitt Jones. He represented Weymouth and Melcombe Regis, Denbigh Boroughs, Athlone and Shrewsbury in the House of Commons. Born Thomas Tyrwhitt, he assumed by Royal Licence the additional surname of Jones in 1790. His son, the second baronet, was High Sheriff of Shropshire in 1816 and sat as a Member of Parliament for Bridgnorth (1818–1820). He was succeeded by his son, the aforementioned Sir Henry Thomas Tyrwhitt, 3rd Baronet, who married Harriet Wilson, 12th Baroness Berners. Their son Raymond Robert Tyrwhitt-Wilson succeeded in both the baronetcy and barony.

==Succession of the Berners barony==

However, he was succeeded in the barony of Berners by his first cousin Vera Ruby Tyrwhitt (1901–1992) (daughter of Hon. Rupert Tyrwhitt, fifth son of the 12th Baroness), who became the 15th Baroness Berners and married Harold Williams (d.1971). On her death in 1992 the barony again fell into abeyance between her two daughters, namely Hon. Pamela Vivien Williams, the eldest, wife of Michael Joseph Sperry Kirkham, and Hon. Rosemary Tyrwhitt Williams, wife of Kelvin Alexander Pollock. In 1995 the abeyance was terminated in favour of the elder daughter, Pamela Vivien Kirkham.

<text>The 40th Infantry Division (&quot;Sunburst Division&quot;) is a modular division of the California Army National Guard. Following the Army&#x27;s modularization in the mid-2000s, the division has become a modular unit consisting of three brigade combat teams, with National Guardsmen from throughout the Pacific and Western United States and Oceania. Its division headquarters is located at Los Alamitos Joint Forces Training Base in Los Alamitos, California.

After seeing service in World War I as a depot division, it was reorganized as the National Guard division for California, Nevada, and Utah, before seeing service in the Pacific Theatre of World War II. Later, the division served in Korea and some of its units were designated for Vietnam. The division was later reorganized redesigned as a National Guard unit completely within California. Later reorganizations included units from other states. The division was called up to quell civil disturbances and rioting that occurred during the Watts Riots in 1965, rioting during the Long, Hot Summer of 1967 and during the LA riots in 1992. Most recently, the division has been deployed overseas as part of the ongoing Global War on Terrorism, seeing service in Iraq and Afghanistan. As currently configured, the 40th Infantry Division has oversight and responsibility for the training and readiness of units in California, Oregon, Hawaii, Arizona, Washington, Alaska, New Mexico, Indiana, Nebraska, Nevada, Mississippi, Utah, Guam, and the Northern Mariana Islands.

== Service record ==
Constituted on 18 July 1917 following the American entry into World War I, the 40th Infantry Division was organized at Camp Kearny, near San Diego, California, on 16 September, originally designated as the 19th Division. It was composed of National Guard units from the states of Arizona, California, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, and Utah.

===World War I===
It was sent overseas on 3 August 1918 and redesignated as the 6th Depot Division; received, equipped, trained, and forwarded replacements. Major General Frederick S. Strong was assigned as commander on 25 August 1917, but was replaced less than a month later by Brigadier General G. H. Cameron on 18 September 1917.

The division then saw a rapid turnover of leaders – Brigadier General L. S. Lyon (19 November 1917), Brigadier General G. H. Cameron (23 November 1917), Brigadier General L. S. Lyon (6 December 1917) and then Major General F. S. Strong again on 8 December 1917.

When the division arrived in France in August 1918, the Imperial German Army had just completed a series of offensives that started on 21 March and ended on 15 July 1918. It was decided that the new divisions would be used as depot divisions, supplying fresh troops to the more experienced combat divisions. By the time the war was over in November 1918, due to the Armistice with Germany, the 40th Division had provided over 27,000 replacements to the 26th, 28th, 32nd, 77th, 80th, 81st, 82nd, and 89th Divisions. Thus the division as a whole did not serve in combat, but many division personnel fought, notably Captain Nelson Miles Holderman, who received the Medal of Honor for his actions in the Meuse–Argonne offensive while serving with the Lost Battalion of the 77th Division. The division returned to the United States on 30 June 1919 where it was deactivated.

=== Interwar period ===

The 40th Division headquarters arrived at the port of New York aboard the USS Artemis on 13 March 1919 after 6 months of overseas service and was demobilized on 20 April 1919 at Camp Kearny, California. In accordance with the National Defense Act of 1920, the division was allotted to the states of California, Utah, and Nevada, and assigned to the IX Corps. The division headquarters was reorganized and federally recognized on 18 June 1926 at Berkeley, California. The division headquarters was relocated on 1 October 1937 to Los Angeles, California. The designated mobilization training center for the “Sunburst” Division was Camp San Luis Obispo, where much of the division’s training activities occurred between the wars. The units of the 40th Division were called up by their state governors for various state emergencies and duties. The largest of these was a virtually statewide strike in California in May and June 1934 by longshoremen and other labor unions. Most of the division was called up to perform strike duty and crowd control. The division staff, composed of personnel from all three states, came together to conduct joint training for several summers before World War II. The staff conducted their training at numerous locations over the period to include the Presidio of San Francisco, Camp San Luis Obispo, and at the Presidio of Monterey. 

The division conducted summer camp every year at San Luis Obispo, 1923-1939, minus the Utah elements, which held their training at Camp W.G. Williams, Utah. Additionally, the division staff participated in the Fourth Army CPXs held at Fort Lewis, Washington, in 1935 and 1936, and at the Presidio of San Francisco in 1939. For the 1937 camp, the division participated in the Ninth Corps Area phase of the Fourth Army maneuvers at San Luis Obispo held 2–12 August. During that maneuver, the 40th Division operated against the 6th Infantry Brigade of the Regular Army&#x27;s 3rd Division. In April 1940, the 40th Division commanding general and his staff participated in the 3rd Division’s maneuver in the vicinity of Fort Ord, California. For the final phase of the exercise, the division commander and staff assumed control of the simulated combat actions of the 3rd Division. In August 1940, the “Sunburst” Division again participated in the Fourth Army Maneuvers, this time at Fort Lewis as part of the provisional IX Corps. The division was relieved from the IX Corps on 30 December 1940 and assigned to the III Corps. In early 1941, the personnel from Nevada’s 40th Military Police Company and 2nd Battalion, 115th Engineer Regiment were used to form the 121st Coast Artillery Battalion (Separate) (Antiaircraft), and the military police and engineer units were subsequently reorganized in California, removing Nevada from allocation to the division.

====Combat chronicle====

The 40th Infantry Division was ordered into federal service on 3 March 1941. In February 1942, the 40th Infantry Division was reorganized from a &#x27;square&#x27;, two-brigade, four-regiment division to a three-regiment division without any intermediate brigade headquarters. Thus, the 79th and 80th Infantry Brigades were inactivated.

The division departed for overseas service on 23 August 1942. The division&#x27;s first overseas assignment was the defense of the outer Hawaiian Islands, where it arrived in September 1942. Training continued as defensive positions were improved and maintained. In July 1943, the division was concentrated on Oahu, and relieved the 24th Infantry Division of the defense of the North Sector. Relieved of the North Sector in October 1943, the 40th entered upon a period of intensive amphibious and jungle training. On 20 December 1943, the first units left for Guadalcanal, and by mid-January 1944, movement was completed, and the division prepared for its first combat assignment. On 24 April 1944, it left Guadalcanal for New Britain. The regiments of the division took positions at Talasea on the northern side of the island, at Arawe on the southern side, and at near the western end. Neutralization of the enemy was effected by patrols. No major battle was fought. Heavy rain and mud were constant problems.

The 40th was relieved of missions on New Britain on 27 November 1944 by the Australian 5th Division, and began training for the Luzon landing. Sailing from Borgen Bay on 9 December 1944, the division made an assault landing at Lingayen, Luzon, under command of XIV Corps, on 9 January 1945. Seizing Lingayen airfield, the division occupied Bolinao Peninsula and San Miguel, and advanced toward Manila, include the Filipino regular and constable force of the Philippine Commonwealth Army and Philippine Constabulary were recaptured areas around in Luzon at the mainland, running into heavy fighting in the Fort Stotsenburg area and the Bambam Hills. Snake Hill and Storm King Mountain were taken in February and the 40th was relieved, 2 March. Leaving Luzon on 15 March 1945 to cut behind the Japanese, the division landed on Panay Island on the 18th and knocked out Japanese resistance within ten days, seizing airfields at Cabatuan and Mandurriao. On 29 March, it landed at Pulupandan, Negros Occidental, advanced through Bacolod toward Talisay, which it secured by 2 April 1945. After mopping up on Negros Island, the division returned to Panay in June and July 1945.

Lt. Col. Ryoichi Tozuka, the commander of the Imperial Japanese Army in Panay Island, signed the document of surrender at Cabatuan Airfield, located in Cabatuan, Iloilo, Panay Island, Philippines, on September 2, 1945, the same day as the surrender signing in Japan aboard the U.S.S. Missouri. This was accepted by Col. Raymond G. Stanton, comdg the 160th U.S. Infantry regiment, and was attended by Rear Admiral Ralph O. Davis, comdg the U.S. Navy&#x27;s 13th Amphibious Group, and by Brig. Gen. Donald J. Myers, comdg the 40th Infantry Division. The 13th Amphibious Group was tasked to transport the 40th U.S. Infantry Division to Korea.

In September 1945, the division moved to Korea for occupation duty. The division returned to the U.S. on 7 April 1946 and was reportedly inactivated the same day.

During the war, various regiments were assigned to the division, these included the 108th, 159th, 160th, 184th, 185th, and 503d, however no more than three regiments were assigned to the division at any one time. World War II honors for the division included three Distinguished Unit Citations. Awards to its men included 1 Medal of Honor, 12 Distinguished Service Crosses, 1 Distinguished Service Medal, 245 Silver Stars, 21 Legions of Merit, 30 Soldier&#x27;s Medals, 1,036 Bronze Stars, and 57 Air Medals.

====Combat chronicle====
On 1 September 1950, the 40th Infantry Division was again called into active federal service for the Korean War. Shipping out of Oakland and San Francisco, California in late March 1951, the division deployed to Japan for training. For the next nine months, they participated in amphibious, air transportability, and live fire training from Mount Fuji to Sendai. On 23 December, the division received alert orders to move to Korea. The division moved to Korea in January 1952. After additional training, the division moved north in February 1952, where it relieved the 24th Infantry Division on the battle line. At the time the division consisted of the 160th, 223rd, and 224th Infantry Regiments, and smaller non-regiment-sized units.

In Korea, the 40th Infantry Division participated in the battles of Sandbag Castle and Heartbreak Ridge. In these campaigns, the division suffered 1,180 casualties, including 311 who were killed in action, and 47 who later died from wounds received in action. Total division casualties in Korea included 376 killed in action, 1,457 wounded in action, and 47 dead of wounds. After the division was sent back to Japan, its time in Korea was commemorated by the commissioning of a punchbowl created by a local silversmith, by some accounts made up of the melted down Combat Infantryman Badges of the divisions veterans, with the geography of Heartbreak Ridge etched inside the bowl. It was used at ceremonial functions until it was stolen, and was subsequently bought at a garage sale by a married couple, who kept it for 18 years. It was then recovered and put on display at the division headquarters. It is now displayed at the California State Military Museum, and is registered in the National Archives.

Three members of the division&#x27;s 223rd Infantry Regiment were awarded the Medal of Honor for their actions during the Korean War: David B. Bleak, Gilbert G. Collier and Clifton T. Speicher. David Hackworth did a combat tour as company commander of E Company (Heavy Weapons) 1st Battalion 223rd Infantry Regiment and F Company 2nd Battalion 223rd Infantry Regiment in Korea with the division, when it was under the command of Major General Joseph P. Cleland.

After its return from the Korean War, the division was reorganized on 1 July 1954 as the 40th Armored Division. It had three combat commands (A, B, and C) in 1956.

=== Cold War ===
The 1st Battalion, 158th Infantry Regiment (1959–1967), 1st Battalion, 159th Infantry Regiment (1974–1976), 2–159th (1974–2000) and the 160th Infantry Regiment (1974–2000) were part of the division from 1959 until 2000. In 1960, the Division combat units were reorganized under the Combat Arms Regimental Systems (CARS), and then in 1963, was reorganized under the Reorganization Objective Army Divisions (ROAD) concept which changed the combat commands to brigades.

On 13 August 1965, Lieutenant Governor Glenn M. Anderson called out elements of the division to put down the Watts Riots, at the request of Los Angeles Police Chief William H. Parker. The absence of Governor Pat Brown meant Anderson had gubernatorial authority.

On 1 December 1967, a major reorganization of the National Guard reduced the Guard to eight combat divisions, the 40th Armored Division being one of the casualties. On 29 January 1968, the division was eliminated and the 40th Infantry Brigade and 40th Armored Brigade were organized.

On 13 January 1974, the California Army National Guard was reorganized. The 40th and 49th Infantry and the 40th Armored Brigades were inactivated and the 40th Infantry Division was reformed.

Like most reserve component units of the Army, the division sat out the Vietnam War, being left unmobilized, apart from its Aviation Company. In January 1968 the company had been redesignated the 40th Aviation Company, having been previously designated the 29th Aviation Company, part of the 29th Infantry Brigade homebased in Hawaii. The 40th Aviation Company did one tour in South Vietnam. It was in active federal service from May 1968 to December 1969.

In January 1974 Major General Charles A. Ott, Jr. was appointed commander of the division, and he served until accepting appointment as Director of the Army National Guard at the National Guard Bureau later that year.

On 30 September 1986, the division&#x27;s Aviation Brigade was organized and federally recognized at Fresno. In 1987 the division&#x27;s aviation units were reorganized, and the 140th Aviation Regiment was established.

From 1986 until 1995, the division&#x27;s CAPSTONE wartime organizational structure included the 140th Military Intelligence Battalion (CEWI) (HD). Allocated to the United States Army Reserve in peacetime, the mission of the battalion was to provide the division commander and G-2 with electronic warfare intelligence and analysis, as well limited counterintelligence/interrogation support and long range surveillance. The battalion&#x27;s long-range surveillance detachment was stripped from the battalion in peacetime and allocated to the California Army National Guard.

=== Post Cold War ===
The 40th Infantry Division was not deployed in the Persian Gulf War.

On 29 April 1992, Governor Pete Wilson ordered elements of the 40th Infantry Division to duty to put down the so-called &quot;Rodney King&quot; riots. The 40th ID responded quickly by calling up some 2,000 soldiers, but could not get them to the city until nearly twenty-four hours had passed, due to a lack of proper equipment, training, and available ammunition, which had to be picked up from Camp Roberts, California (near Paso Robles). Initially, they only secured areas previously cleared of rioters by police. Later, they actively ran patrols, maintained checkpoints, and provided firepower for law enforcement. By 1 May, the call-up had increased to 4,000 soldiers continuing to move into the city in Humvees, who were later federalized under Title 10 USC by President George H. W. Bush.

In 1994, the division was made of three brigades, an aviation brigade, an engineer brigade, a division artillery brigade, and other associated units. Associated regiments included the 160th Infantry, 185th Armor, 221st Armor (Nevada), 159th Infantry, 184th Infantry, 149th Armor, 18th Cavalry, 140th Aviation, 143d Field Artillery, and 144th Field Artillery.

On 17 January 1994, Governor Pete Wilson activated the 40th Infantry Division (M) to respond to the aftermath of the Northridge earthquake, and emergency services were up and running within five hours of the quake.

In November 1997, Battery F (TA), 144th Field Artillery Regiment, represented the state of California in Bosnia. During this deployment, Battery F conducted Firefinder counter-battery radar operations, convoys and base security all with little to no armor, with a high threat of mine strikes and ambushes. Most drivers exceeded 21,000 kilometres (13,000 miles) during the seven months in country.

In November 2000, Battery F was again called to duty for its expertise in the Kosovo region.

Until Battery F&#x27;s arrival in Afghanistan, radar operations were virtually unknown and uncared for. Nevertheless, the unit quickly became a very important resource and a leading factor in base defense operations.

===Operation Freedom&#x27;s Sentinel===
The 40th ID deployed to Afghanistan in September 2017 in support of Operation Freedom&#x27;s Sentinel. Members of the 40th ID form the headquarters staff of Train, Advise, and Assist Command South which was commanded by Brig. Gen. John W. Lathrop. This is the unit&#x27;s &quot;first combat deployment since the Korean War.&quot; In June 2018, authority of the command was transferred to Brig. Gen. Jeffrey Smiley who took command with a new group of 40th ID Soldiers; in October 2018, Smiley was injured during an insider attack, which resulted in the death of the police chief of Kandahar.

In July 2006, as part of the Army National Guard&#x27;s modularization process, the 40th Infantry Division reorganized into four brigade combat teams and one aviation brigade. National Guard units from California, Oregon, Hawaii, Arizona, Washington, Alaska, New Mexico, Indiana, Nebraska, Utah and Guam were part of the 40th Infantry Division. On 3 December 2016 the 81st Stryker Brigade Combat Team left the division and joined the 7th Infantry Division as an associate unit of the 2nd Infantry Division.

==Attached units==
* 65th Field Artillery Brigade (UT NG)
* 297th Battlefield Surveillance Brigade (AK NG)(Reorganized and redesignated as the 297th Regional Support Group)

== Symbols ==
*Nickname: Sunshine/Sunburst Division (official); Flaming Assholes (unofficial).
*Shoulder patch: A dark blue diamond on which, in yellow, is the sun with 12 rays; the patch is worn diagonally.
*Association: 40th Infantry Division Association

The semi-sunburst was suggested as the unit&#x27;s shoulder sleeve insignia, and represents the division&#x27;s home of Southern California. The demi fleur-de-lis symbolizes service in France during World War I. The outer rim of the sun rays refers to the Philippine Presidential Unit Citation award. The red arrowhead alludes to firepower of the division and represents their assault landing at Luzon in World War II. The Torri gate, a symbol of the Far East, refers to the award of the Republic of Korea Presidential Unit Citation.

The unofficial nickname came from the Korean War era when the unit was training in Japan. It was a combined result of disparaging remarks made by Army regulars about the National Guard division and the appearance of the unit shoulder sleeve insignia. The California Guardsmen took to their new nickname with a soldier&#x27;s sense of humor, and turned it into a rallying symbol.

==Heritage==
During the Korean War, members of the 40th Infantry Division raised funds for and built the School at Gapyeong County in 1952. 

Originally named the Kenneth Kaiser Middle School (in honor of Kenneth Kaiser, Jr., a Los Angeles sergeant who was the division’s first soldier killed in action in the Korean War), the school’s name was changed to Gapyeong Middle School and Gapyeong High School in 1972.

The 40th Infantry Division also built Kwanin Middle School and Kwanin High School at Kwanin Township, Pocheon in 1955. 
In addition to the schools, the 40th Infantry Division built hospitals and other public facilities at Kwanin Township in an area called &quot;Sunburst Village.&quot;

After the Korean War, former commander Joseph P. Cleland and other veterans of the 40th Infantry Division continued to support the schools through donations, have returned to attend graduations and present scholarships, and attended the opening of the Kaiser Hall Museum in 2008

<doc id="458111" wikidata="Q368961" url="?curid=458111" title="Dead or Alive (band)">
<text>Dead or Alive were an English pop band who released seven studio albums from 1984 to 2000. The band formed in 1980 in Liverpool and found success in the mid-1980s, releasing seven singles that made the UK Top 40 and three albums in the UK Top 30. At the peak of their success, the line-up consisted of Pete Burns (vocals), Steve Coy (drums), Mike Percy (bass), and Tim Lever (keyboards), with the core pair of Burns and Coy writing and producing for the remainder of the band&#x27;s career due to Percy and Lever exiting the group in 1989. Burns died in 2016; with the death of Coy in 2018, the band ended.

Two of the band&#x27;s singles reached the US Top 20 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100: &quot;You Spin Me Round (Like a Record)&quot; (No. 11 in August 1985), and &quot;Brand New Lover&quot; (No. 15 in March 1987). &quot;You Spin Me Round (Like a Record)&quot; peaked at No. 1 for two weeks in 1985 in the UK, then charted again in 2006 following Burns&#x27;s appearance on the television reality show &quot;Celebrity Big Brother&quot; and on season 4 of &quot;Stranger Things&quot;. It also became the first of two singles to top the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Dance Club Play chart. In December 2016, &quot;Billboard&quot; ranked them as the 96th most successful dance artist of all time.

==History==
===Formation and early career of band===

In 1977, Burns formed a punk band with contemporaries Julian Cope, Pete Wylie, and Phil Hurst, calling themselves &quot;the Mystery Girls&quot;. They only had one performance (opening for Sham 69 at Eric&#x27;s Club in Liverpool in November 1977) before disintegrating. Cope stated that Burns&#x27;s performing style drew from the transgender punk performer Wayne County and Wylie recalled that &quot;his head looked like someone had melted a load of black vinyl down into a kind of space quiff.&quot; 

Burns continued in early-1979 with a new band, &quot;Nightmares in Wax&quot; (originally called &quot;Rainbows Over Nagasaki&quot;), featuring a gothic post-punk sound, with backing from keyboardist Martin Healy, guitarist Mick Reid, bassist Rob Jones (who left to be replaced by Walter Ogden), and drummer Paul Hornby (who also exited after the band&#x27;s formation to be replaced by Phil Hurst).

The group played their first gig supporting Wire at Eric&#x27;s Club in July 1979, and recorded demos which included a cover of the Simon Dupree and the Big Sound song &quot;Kites&quot;, a feature of their early shows. Although signed to the Eric&#x27;s Records label, their only release, a three-track 7-inch EP entitled &quot;Birth of a Nation&quot;, appeared in March 1980 on Inevitable Records. A 12-inch single featuring two of the tracks from the EP, &quot;Black Leather&quot; and &quot;Shangri-La&quot;, was released in 1985. The EP featured &quot;Black Leather&quot;, which turned halfway into KC and the Sunshine Band&#x27;s &quot;That&#x27;s the Way (I Like It)&quot;.

The band went through several line-up changes over the next three years while recording a series of independent singles. In 1980, after replacing several members, Burns changed the band&#x27;s name to Dead or Alive. Dead or Alive&#x27;s singles started charting on the UK Indie Chart, beginning with 1982&#x27;s &quot;The Stranger&quot; reaching No. 7. This prompted major label Epic Records to sign the band in 1983. Their first release for Epic was the single &quot;Misty Circles&quot;, which appeared at No. 100 on the major UK Singles Chart in 1983. Two more singles co-produced by Zeus B. Held (&quot;What I Want&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;d Do Anything&quot;) were released but mainstream success continued to elude the band.

The band&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Sophisticated Boom Boom&quot;, was released in May 1984 and featured their first Top 40 UK single, &quot;That&#x27;s the Way (I Like It)&quot;, a cover of the 1975 hit by KC and the Sunshine Band. That song, along with &quot;Misty Circles&quot;, were also hits on the US Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart. The album was a minor success in the UK where it peaked at No. 29. As Burns and his band achieved greater media exposure, his eccentric and androgynous appearance often led to comparisons with Culture Club and its lead singer Boy George as well as &quot;Calling Your Name&quot; singer Marilyn. Burns would describe producing his first album as &quot;the most joyous experience of my life, full of happy memories, because there was no commercial pressure on us.&quot;

=== Chart success ===
The band released its second album &quot;Youthquake&quot; (US No. 31, UK No. 9) in May 1985, produced by the then-fledgling production team of Mike Stock, Matt Aitken, and Pete Waterman, known as Stock Aitken Waterman (SAW). &quot;You Spin Me Round (Like a Record)&quot; became the band&#x27;s only song to reach No. 1 on the UK Singles Chart after lingering outside the Top 40 for over two months. The track also hit No. 11 in the US and No. 1 in Canada.

Burns said that the record company was unenthusiastic about the single to such an extent that he had to take out a £2,500 loan to record it. Afterward, he recalled, &quot;the record company said it was awful&quot; and the band had to fund production of the song&#x27;s video themselves. Additionally, Burns said that 12-inch singles comprised over 70% of the original sales of &quot;You Spin Me Round&quot;, and because these were regarded by the record label as promotional tools rather than sales, the band had to threaten legal action against the label before they received the royalties on them.

Other album tracks released as singles included &quot;Lover Come Back To Me&quot; (No. 11), &quot;In Too Deep&quot; (No. 14), and &quot;My Heart Goes Bang (Get Me to the Doctor)&quot; (No. 23) which all reached the UK Top 30. Despite the international chart-topping success of &quot;Youthquake&quot; and its lead single, Burns said it was the album that he was &quot;most dissatisfied with&quot; and recalled that &quot;one of the unhappiest days of my life was when &quot;Spin Me&quot; reached No. 1 – and I mean really unhappy. Because I knew it would be downhill all the way after that.&quot; Burns had a fear of success and hoped that his singles would not chart highly. &quot;I didn&#x27;t want too high positions because I didn&#x27;t want to lose my life,&quot; he recalled. &quot;I thought, if it happens it happens, but if it doesn&#x27;t – phew!&quot;

In late 1986, Dead or Alive released their third album, &quot;Mad, Bad and Dangerous to Know&quot; (US No. 52, UK No. 27). Production of the album was marred by more fights between the band and SAW.

The lead single &quot;Brand New Lover&quot; became a modest UK hit, peaking at No. 31, but was more successful in the US where it reached No. 15 on the US Hot 100, and No. 1 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; dance chart. 

Three more singles from the album were released; the most successful in the UK was &quot;Something in My House&quot; (No. 12), with a sleeve depicting Burns in front of what appears to be a Satanic altar, featuring an inverted cross. 

Clashes between the band and the label continued over the song&#x27;s music video, with Epic Records reportedly objecting to a &quot;mildly suggestive&quot; sequence involving Burns and a banana. &quot;By the time we got to &#x27;Something in My House&#x27;, I felt I wanted to express myself on film, as well as record, amuse myself, show my sense of humour,&quot; Burns wrote on the liner notes to his &quot;Evolution: The Videos&quot; compilation DVD. &quot;Well apparently the manner in which I &#x27;peeled a banana&#x27; seemed to work against me/us! And, it was downhill all the way after that.&quot;

Recording of the song was also fraught, with Burns alleging that producer Mike Stock erased his original vocal take after objecting to the singer&#x27;s use of the phrase &quot;wicked queen&quot;, a lyrical double entendre implying reference to a gay relationship. &quot;We would butt heads so fucking badly; it was unbelievable,&quot; Burns told journalist James Arena in his book &quot;Europe&#x27;s Stars of 80s Dance Pop&quot;. &quot;That&#x27;s why we eventually walked away from them. For instance, there was a lyric from &#x27;Something in My House&#x27; where I make reference to a wicked queen. The actual producer, Mike Stock stopped me and said I couldn&#x27;t use that term because it would mean the record is about gay people. I was like, &#x27;Fuck this, it&#x27;s going on!&#x27; They actually wiped the original vocal, but then Pete Waterman came back and said, &#x27;Let him do it the way he wants to.&#x27;&quot; 

Despite the reservations of the label and producers, the track proved to be Dead or Alive&#x27;s biggest hit in the UK since &quot;Lover Come Back to Me&quot; and was the only single from their third album to earn a UK Top 20 placement. The song also proved to be the act&#x27;s final Top 40 hit with an original release in the UK, and their last Top 20 hit in Australia. A 12-inch version of the song, the &#x27;Mortevicar Mix&#x27;, featured scenes from Nosferatu and sampling of dialogue from the soundtrack of &quot;The Exorcist&quot; and a sampling from the George A. Romero American movie trailer from his film &quot;Day of the Dead&quot;. 

In 1987, &quot;Dead or Alive&quot; released their greatest hits album &quot;Rip It Up&quot;, and a concert tour of the same name with dates in Europe, the United States, and Japan. Film footage was recorded at two shows at Tokyo&#x27;s Nippon Budokan on 9 October and at Osaka&#x27;s Osaka-jō Hall on 11 October, and released on video cassette (VHS) and Laserdisc that same year under the title &quot;Rip It Up Live&quot;. The concert was eventually issued as bonus material for the first time on DVD as part of the 2003 compilation release.
In mid-1988, &quot;Dead or Alive&quot;, now pared down to a duo of Burns and Coy, released the self-produced &quot;Nude&quot; (US No. 106, UK No. 82). In 2021, &quot;RetroPop Magazine&quot; retrospectively described &quot;Nude&quot; as the &quot;perfect &quot;Dead or Alive&quot; album&quot; and &quot;their strongest offering overall&quot;. During the album&#x27;s production Tim Lever and Mike Percy were fired from the band. The pair later formed careers as mixers and producers; both owned and operated &quot;Steelworks Studios&quot; in Sheffield and experienced success writing and mixing songs for acts like S Club 7, Blue, and Robbie Williams. From the information booklet in Sophisticated Boom Box MMXVI, Burns stated:

The album featured the single &quot;Turn Around and Count 2 Ten&quot; which reached No. 2 in the US Hot Dance Club Songs chart and No. 1 for a record-breaking seventeen-weeks in Japan. It was followed by the singles &quot;Baby Don&#x27;t Say Goodbye&quot; which peaked at No. 6 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Dance Club Songs chart and &quot;Come Home with Me Baby&quot; which spent thirteen-weeks at No. 1 on the US Hot Dance Music/Club Play due to a popular remix by producer Lewis Martineé. However, &quot;Come Home with Me Baby&quot; and the other singles struggled in the UK. This was attributed to the lyrics of the song, which encouraged casual sex during the AIDs epidemic.

Additionally, despite strong customer demand, the US record company refused to release it as a proper single (claiming they objected to the male dancers in the music video) which prevented the song from becoming a major hit on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. In 1989, to support his &quot;Nude&quot; album and the release of its companion remix album &quot;Nude – Remade Remodelled&quot;, Burns toured with fellow Stock Aitken Waterman acts Sinitta and Kylie Minogue in Asia and Europe on the ensemble &quot;Disco in Dream&quot; concert tour. On 6 October, Burns gave a performance at the Tokyo Dome, the largest concert venue in Japan (with a seating capacity of 55,000 people), which was broadcast on the NHK television network.

=== 1990s and 2000s ===
In 1990, the band produced their next studio album, &quot;Fan the Flame (Part 1)&quot;, although their only successful record deal was in Japan where the album peaked at No. 27 on the Japanese Albums Chart. The band had begun to produce &quot;Fan the Flame (Part 2)&quot;, however the album was shelved until it was finished in 2021. An acoustic album &quot;Love, Pete&quot; was also made available during a US personal appearance tour in 1992 and was since widely bootlegged with the title &quot;Fan the Flame (Part 2): The Acoustic Sessions&quot;. Pete strongly criticized its subsequent distribution.

In 2000, &quot;Dead or Alive&quot; released &quot;Fragile&quot;, a collection of remakes with several new tracks and covers including U2&#x27;s &quot;Even Better Than the Real Thing&quot; and Nick Kamen&#x27;s &quot;I Promised Myself&quot;. The first song on the album, &quot;Hit and Run Lover&quot;, was a hit single peaking at No. 2 on the Japanese charts. A new remix album, &quot;Unbreakable: The Fragile Remixes&quot;, was released in 2001. This was followed in 2003 with a greatest hits album entitled &quot;&quot; along with a video compilation that was also released on DVD. &quot;You Spin Me Round (Like a Record)&quot; was re-released as a single to promote the album with it reaching No. 23 on the UK Singles Chart.

===2010s===
On 7 September 2010, Burns&#x27;s solo single &quot;Never Marry an Icon&quot;, produced and co-written by the Dirty Disco, was released to the iTunes Store. The single was released by fellow band member Steve Coy&#x27;s label, &quot;Bristar Records&quot;. Even though Burns stated Dead or Alive had ceased to exist in 2011, Coy later declared the moniker was still active and the band was not over. On 21 December 2012, Burns and Coy performed at the Pete Waterman concert Hit Factory Live at London&#x27;s O2 Arena. Burns died of a cardiac arrest on 23 October 2016, at the age of 57, ending the band. 

On 28 October 2016, a 19-disc box set titled &quot;Sophisticated Boom Box MMXVI&quot; was released by Edsel Records. The release was announced on September 8, via Demon Music Group as a &quot;personally curated [by Burns and Coy] 19 disc set, featuring the original album tracks plus a plethora of rarities, live recordings, alternate mixes, instrumental versions and more than 12 previously unreleased remixes and tracks from their vaults, bringing a unique collection together from the band’s internationally successful career for the very first time.&quot; Coy died on 4 May 2018 at the age of 56. Coy was in Italy to work on a new studio album before he died at his Bogliasco home following an eleven-month battle with cancer.

<text>Michael Eugene Misick (; born 2 February 1966) is a Turks and Caicos Islander politician who was the 7th Chief Minister of the Turks and Caicos Islands from 15 August 2003 to 9 August 2006 and was the 1st Premier of the Turks and Caicos Islands from 9 August 2006 to 23 March 2009. Misick is a member of the Progressive National Party (PNP) and became chief minister when his party, after eight years as the opposition party, gained two parliamentary seats in by-elections. In addition to being premier, he was also the minister for Civil Aviation, Commerce and Development, Planning, District Administration, Broadcasting Commission, Tourist Board, Turks and Caicos Investment Agency, and Tourism. Several other members of Misick&#x27;s family have been politicians in the Turks and Caicos Islands, and important leaders in the PNP. Washington Misick, his brother, is the current Premier, former Chief Minister and former Minister of Finance.

==Biography==
Born in Bottle Creek, North Caicos, Misick is one of 12 children of Mr and Mrs Charles Misick. He received his foundation education in North Caicos and then furthered it at the Turks and Caicos High School (Helena Jones Robinson High School), the Miami Lakes Technical Institute (where he graduated with a certificate in Business Studies), and the University of Buckingham (LLB, Hons. Bachelor of Law). Misick is a Barrister at Law of England and Wales and an Attorney at Law of Turks and Caicos Islands. He is a member of the Honourable Society of Lincoln’s Inn.

Misick spent several years in the private sector where he was sales manager for Prestigious Properties Ltd. from 1984 to 1986 and managing director from 1986 to 1988. From 1988 to 1991 he was chairman and CEO of Paramount Group of Companies, a property and financial services company. Misick was first elected to the Legislative Council in 1991, when he became Minister of Tourism, Transportation and Communications. He was re-elected in 1995. In March 2002 he was elected leader of the then opposition PNP thus succeeding Washington Misick. In the April 2003 general elections, Misick&#x27;s party won 6 out of the possible 13 seats in the legislature. The successful petitioning and winning of by-elections held in two constituencies resulted in Misick being sworn in as Chief Minister of the Turks and Caicos Islands on 15 August 2003, four months after the election.

==Personal==
Misick has six children with five different women.
His first marriage was to Yvette Marcelin, an attorney. In April 2006, Michael Misick married American actress LisaRaye McCoy. A statement released on 12 August 2008 to the press by Misick stated: &quot;I am announcing that I am separated from &quot;LisaRaye McCoy&quot;, I am committed to dissolving the marriage amicably. I believe that this is a private matter and will have no further comments. I hope that our privacy will be respected.”. The two were divorced in 2008.

In 2013 he became engaged to Netherlands native Tatjana van de Merwe of Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic. They married in August 2018.

==Political career==
===Corruption allegations===
In 2008, a Foreign Affairs Select Committee of British Members of Parliament conducting a routine review of the administration in British Overseas Territories received several reports of high-level official corruption in the Turks and Caicos. Their report charged that Misick, &quot;who is alleged to have built up a multi-million dollar fortune since he was elected in 2003 when he declared assets of only $50,000 (£25,000),&quot; enriched himself and fellow ministers &quot;by selling off Crown land to fund current investment.&quot; In response, the Governor of the Turks and Caicos Islands Richard Tauwhare announced the appointment of a Commission of Enquiry into corruption on 10 July 2008.

===Rape allegation===
On 7 January 2007, Misick called for general elections on 9 February. The PNP won 13 of the 15 seats, making it one of the most lopsided election results in the Turks and Caicos Islands.
Misick was accused of raping an American woman on 28 March 2008. The claim against Misick failed, and the woman subsequently brought proceedings against her employers in Florida.

===Resignation===
On 15 December 2008 Misick was asked to step down by nine members of his party. Misick, who has denied any wrongdoing, resigned on 23 March 2009 after an investigation found &quot;clear signs of corruption&quot; in Turks and Caicos. The UK Foreign Office said it would suspend the constitution and give control to Governor Gordon Wetherell. The departure of the premier occurred a week earlier than expected. While the investigations were underway, Governor Gordon Wetherell suspended self-government in the islands on 16 August 2009.

In June 2011 Misick&#x27;s assets were frozen by a court order. In September 2010 a report from the Turks and Caicos Islands 2008-9 Commission of Inquiry recommended criminal investigation of Misick of possible corruption and abuse of his former position. the end

===Arrest and trial===

On 7 December 2012, Michael Misick was arrested at Santos Dumont Airport, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, after being located by Interpol. He was arrested while trying to leave for São Paulo. The arrest warrant was issued by Minister Ricardo Lewandowski of the Supreme Federal Court of Brazil on 22 November, at the request of the government of the United Kingdom.

He was returned to Turks and Caicos on 7 January 2014 where he was questioned at the capital&#x27;s police headquarters. He was briefly remanded at Her Majesty’s Prison Grand Turk before being released on bail on 13 January 2014 ahead of his trial. He was charged with conspiracy to receive bribes, conspiracy to defraud the government and money laundering. His much-delayed trial began on 18 January 2016, and was still on-going a year later. The trial was continuing in 2019 and 2020 until the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in another postponement.

He is now set to stand trial commencing December 2024.

===Political comeback attempt===
In December 2016, Misick stood as an at-large candidate in the general elections in Turks and Caicos Island as an independent. However, he received only 5.57% of the vote and was not elected.

<text>The Windows key (also known as win, start, logo, flag or [[Windows key|super]] key) is a keyboard key which was originally introduced on Microsoft&#x27;s Natural Keyboard in 1994. Windows 95 used it to bring up the start menu and it then became a standard key on PC keyboards. On computers running the Microsoft Windows operating system, performs the same function, in case the keyboard lacks this key.

==History and usage==
Historically, the addition of two Windows keys and a menu key marked the change from the 101/102-key to 104/105-key layout for PC keyboards. Compared to the former layout, a Windows key was placed between the left and the left and another Windows key and the menu key were placed between the right (or ) and the right key. The Windows key was introduced with Microsoft&#x27;s Natural Keyboard in 1994. The key is predated by the key on Apple computers in the 1980s, and before that by the (or ) key on Lisp/Unix workstation computers in the 1970s.

Windows 95 required the key to be on a keyboard to get the &quot;Designed for Windows&quot; logo, and used it to bring up the Start Menu. It was quickly added by virtually all desktop keyboard manufacturers. The first laptop to bear Windows keys on its keyboard was the Gateway Solo.

In laptop and other compact keyboards it is common to have just one Windows key (usually on the left). On Microsoft&#x27;s Entertainment Desktop sets (designed for Windows Vista), the Windows key is in the middle of the keyboard, below all other keys (where the user&#x27;s thumbs rest).

Some keyboards during the Windows Vista and 7 era feature a circular bump surrounding the logo which distinguishes its feeling from the other buttons.

On Windows 8 tablet computers, hardware certification requirements initially mandated that the Windows key be centered on the bezel below the screen, except on a convertible laptop, where the button is allowed to be off-center in a tablet configuration. This requirement was relaxed in Windows 8.1, allowing the Windows key to be placed on any bezel or edge of the unit, though a centered location along the bottom bezel is still preferred.

== Licensing ==
Microsoft regulates the appearance of the Windows key logo picture with a specially crafted license for keyboard manufacturers (&quot;Microsoft Windows Logo Key Logo License Agreement for Keyboard Manufacturers&quot;). With the introduction of a new Microsoft Windows logo, first used with Windows XP, the agreement was updated to require that the new design be adopted for all keyboards manufactured after 1 September 2003. However, with the release of Windows Vista, Microsoft published guidelines for a new Windows Logo key that incorporates the Windows logo recessed in a chamfered lowered circle with a contrast ratio of at least 3:1 with respect to background that the key is applied to.

In Common Building Block Keyboard Specification, all CBB compliant keyboards were to comply with the Windows Vista Hardware Start Button specification beginning on 1 June 2007.

The Unicode character resembles the look of the key, .

== Use with Microsoft Windows ==
From the Windows 95 to Windows 7 releases of the operating system, tapping the Windows key by itself traditionally revealed Windows Taskbar (if not visible) and opened the Start menu. In Windows Server 2012 and Windows 8, this key launches the Start screen but does not show the taskbar. However, this feature was added back into Windows 10.

Pressing the key in combination with other keys allows invoking many common functions through the keyboard. Holding down will not substitute for the Windows key in these combinations. Which Windows key combinations (&quot;shortcuts&quot;) are available and active in a given Windows session depends on many factors, such as accessibility options, the type of the session (regular or Terminal Services), the Windows version, the presence of specific software such as IntelliType and Group Policy if applicable.

Below is a list of notable shortcuts which work natively. Unless otherwise noted, they are valid in the next version of Windows. Using aftermarket scripts, users can also make custom shortcuts.

== Use with other operating systems ==
The Windows key can also be used on other operating systems, though it usually carries a different name in them. Some cross-platform applications refer to the key as the OS key.

X/Wayland (used on Linux and similar) use the keysym &quot;Super&quot; for the Windows key(s), and toggles the codice_1 shift bit. Most Unix desktop environments use it much like Windows, with activating a primary menu similar to the Windows Start menu, and in combination with character keys performing actions such as run-command, often with the shortcuts and actions the same as Windows for familiarity. A common action that is &quot;not&quot; shared with Windows is for the Super key to allow dragging a window around from any location without raising it.

If one plugs a Windows keyboard into a macOS computer, the Windows key acts as the . As  or acts as , the physical locations of the keys that act as Command and Alt are swapped. Plugging a Macintosh keyboard into a Windows (or Linux) machine does the reverse mapping and thus also swaps the locations.

If one plugs a Windows keyboard into a computer running ChromeOS, the Windows key acts as the  key. A standard ChromeOS keyboard has this key in the location where Caps Lock usually is.

If one plugs a Windows keyboard into an Xbox 360, pressing the Windows key performs the same action as the Guide button on Xbox 360 Controller or remote controls, opening the Xbox Guide. Holding down the Windows key and pressing M opens a pop up conversation window over gameplay, if an instant message conversation is in progress. On an Xbox One or Xbox Series S/X, pressing the Windows key performs the same action as pressing the Xbox button on the controller.

On a PlayStation 3 console, pressing the Windows key performs the same action as the PS Button on the Sixaxis and DualShock 3, opening the XrossMediaBar.

<text>A gay–straight alliance, gender–sexuality alliance (GSA) or queer–straight alliance (QSA) is a student-led or community-based organization, found in middle schools, high schools, colleges, and universities. These are primarily in the United States and Canada. Gay–straight alliance is intended to provide a safe and supportive environment for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and all LGBTQ+ individuals, children, teenagers, and youth as well as their cisgender heterosexual allies. The first GSAs were established in the 1980s. Scientific studies show that GSAs have positive academic, health, and social impacts on schoolchildren of a minority sexual orientation and/or gender identity. Numerous judicial decisions in United States federal and state court jurisdictions have upheld the establishment of GSAs in schools, and the right to use that name for them.
== Terminology ==

* ally – In the context of the founding in 1988, an ally is a cisgender, heterosexual person who supports equal rights for gay people and challenges homophobia. The meaning later expanded to include rights for all LGBTQ+ individuals, orientations, and gender identities.
* Gay–Straight Alliance – name proposed by Meredith Sterling for the original club in 1988. Sometimes with slash instead of dash.
* Gay Straight Alliance – in title case, and without hyphen on the founder website.
* gay–straight alliances – in lowercase, a generalized term for any club of this nature
* Gay–Straight Alliance Network (GSA Network) – an organization founded in California in 1998 to support and promote GSAs.
* gender–sexuality alliance – updated name for gay–straight alliance, the old name appearing &quot;too binary&quot; for a later generation
* Genders &amp; Sexualities Alliance Network – new name (2016) for the Gay–Straight Alliance Network
* Gay, Lesbian &amp; Straight Education Network (GLSEN) – organization founded in 1990 in Boston
* GSA – originally, designated a gay–straight alliance club, later, a gender–sexuality alliance club
* QSA – is used for more inclusive use, as the community is more than &#x27;Gay&#x27;, the use of Queer being used allows other students that may fit the queer definition, like transgender or bisexual students, to be represented in these support groups.
* Sexuality And Gender Acceptance/Awareness/Alliance/Association (SAGA) – unspecific general term, used as an alternative to both LGBTQ and GSA.

== History ==

=== Founding ===

==== Concord Academy ====
The first gay–straight alliance was formed in November 1988 at Concord Academy in Concord, Massachusetts, when Kevin Jennings, a history teacher at the school who had just come out as gay, was approached by Meredith Sterling, a student at the school who was straight, but was upset by the treatment of gay students and others. Jennings recruited some other teachers at the school, thus forming the first gay–straight alliance. One of the first to join was Sterling&#x27;s classmate S. Bear Bergman. Jennings credits students for both the establishment of the club, as well as for setting the agenda of struggling against homophobia, and for changes to CA&#x27;s nondiscrimination policy. Jennings would go on to co-found the Gay, Lesbian &amp; Straight Education Network (GLSEN) in Boston in 1990.

According to a thirty-year retrospective about the history of the group, Concord Academy reported in 2018 that students at the academy had renamed the group &quot;a few years ago&quot; to &quot;&quot;. Faculty mentor Nancy Boutilier said, &quot;That gay–straight language was really important at the time. Times change, though. To students today, that sounds so binary.&quot;

==== Phillips Academy ====
A few months after Concord started the first Gay Straight Alliance club, another Massachusetts preparatory school north of Boston, Phillips Academy, started one of their own. It began with a meeting called by Phillips student Sharon Tentarelli for February 7, 1989, with little advance notice. A dozen people attended, including a mix of student, teachers, and staff. This was the second such group, after Concord Academy. The group was well-received, and some staff and faculty became supporters, both gay, and straight. Athletic director Kathy Henderson was one of the supporters, and she later went on to co-found the GLSEN two years later, along with Kevin Jennings of Concord Academy.

=== United States ===
Described as &quot;perhaps the most important precursor of the GSA movement,&quot; Los Angeles&#x27; Project 10 is seen as the start of the GSA movement. Founded in 1984, Project 10 was widely recognized as the first organized effort to provide support for LGBTQ youth in schools across the United States. The majority of its facilitators were heterosexual, and was named after the commonly-held statistic that 10 per cent of the adult male population is &quot;exclusively homosexual&quot;. Project 10 focused on issues such as substance use, and discussing issues of high-risk sexual behaviour.

The first GSA was started in 1988, in Concord, Massachusetts at Concord Academy by Kevin Jennings. The first public school gay–straight alliance was started at Newton South High School (Newton, Massachusetts) by teacher Robert Parlin. GSAs made headlines in 1999 with the Federal Court ruling in &quot;Utah–East High Gay/Straight Alliance v. Board of Education of Salt Lake City School District&quot;. This ruling found that denying access to a school-based gay–straight alliance was a violation of the Federal Equal Access Act giving students the right to use facilities for extra curricular activities at any school that receives public funding—regardless of private standing or religious affiliation.

On January 24, 2012, the United States Secretary of Education, Arne Duncan, released a video on YouTube commemorating GSA Day and endorsing GSA clubs in schools.

==== Inclusivity ====
Approximately 28 per cent of participants at GSA Network identify as heterosexual.

==== Opposition ====
Some students face opposition from school administrations, elected school boards, or local communities in starting a school GSA.

In 2015, students at Brandon High School in Rankin County, Mississippi, attempted to start a GSA, but the school board met and publicly stated they wanted to prevent the formation of &quot;gay clubs&quot; in the school district. They then created a policy requiring parents to provide written permission before a student can join any club. Students then protested with support from the ACLU.

Students at West Carteret High School in Morehead City, North Carolina tried to start a GSA but the Carteret County Board of Education turned it down. In 1999, the Orange Unified School District in Orange County, California moved to prohibit the formation of a GSA at El Modena High School. The students then sued the school board, claiming that their rights under the First Amendment and the 1984 Equal Access Act had been violated. In the first-ever ruling of its kind, Judge David O. Carter of the United States District Court for the Central District of California issued a preliminary injunction ordering the school to allow the GSA to meet.

The right of students to establish a GSA at school is guaranteed by both the First Amendment to the United States Constitution (with regard to every level of schooling) and the federal Equal Access Act (with regard to secondary schools as long as other student clubs are allowed, with the definition of secondary school for purposes of the federal law including middle schools and high schools).
==== Case law ====
In the United States, the right of students to establish a GSA at school is guaranteed by both the First Amendment to the United States Constitution (with regard to every level of schooling) and the federal Equal Access Act (with regard to secondary schools where other student clubs are allowed, with the definition of secondary school for purposes of the federal law including middle schools and high schools). Since 1998, there have been at least 17 federal court cases in which high school and middle school students have conclusively prevailed in defending the free exercise of their civil rights on this issue, with federal courts consistently ruling that students have both a right to establish a GSA at school and to use the name &quot;Gay–Straight Alliance&quot; instead of an alternative name. In 2000, the United States District Court for the Central District of California ruled in favour of high school students whose attempt to form a GSA had been blocked by the school board, in the case of &quot;Colin v. Orange Unified School District&quot;. In 2009, the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida ruled in favor of high school students whose attempt to form a GSA had been blocked by the school board, in the case of &quot;Gay–Straight Alliance of Yulee High School v. School Board of Nassau County&quot;, with the federal court also ruling that the school must allow the students to use the name &quot;Gay–Straight Alliance&quot; instead of an alternative name that excludes the term &quot;Gay&quot;. In 2016, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit unanimously ruled in favor of middle school students whose attempt to form a GSA had been blocked by the school board, in the case of &quot;Carver Middle School Gay–Straight Alliance v. School Board of Lake County, Florida&quot;.

=== Outside the United States ===
Worldwide, gay–straight alliances are not as common as the organizations are in the United States, but are beginning to spread, particularly in Canada.

==== Australia ====
As of July 2020, as reported by the media Star Observer, Australia has one gay–straight alliance set up within the Melbourne Grammar School. However, the United Kingdom, New Zealand, Canada and some parts of the United States have had gay–straight alliances within schools for decades.

In Australia, the group Safe Schools Coalition Victoria piloted a system of reducing homophobia though teacher training and student groups that promote inclusion of LGBTQ young people, which ran from 2014 to 2017. Started by The Foundation for Young Australians and Gay and Lesbian Health Victoria, along with La Trobe University, the program was expanded to run Australia wide. The program was supported by Beyondblue, Headspace, the University of Canberra, Macquarie University, University of Western Sydney, Curtin University, various family planning and HIV prevention groups, government bodies and Uniting Church organizations.

==== Bulgaria ====
In 2016, Bulgaria became the first country in the Balkans to open a gay–straight alliance in Sofia American College.

==== Canada ====
As Canada has two official languages, LGBTQ student clubs may be referred to as gay–straight alliances (GSA), queer-straight alliances (QSA), alliance allosexuelle-hétérosexuelle (AAH), or alliance gaie-hétéro (AGH).

In May 2010 Egale Canada launched MyGSA.ca, a website focused on GSAs and their role in making Canadian schools safer and more LGBTQ inclusive. Their website includes educational resources for GSAs and information about available bursaries and funding. While MyGSA previously included a directory of registered Canadian GSA, this feature is no longer available on their website. Prior to closing the public directory, more than 283 GSAs had registered with the website.

Currently there are no federal laws in Canada regarding GSAs. Any laws are specific to each province or territory.

===== British Columbia =====
The first GSA in Canada was started in 1998 at Pinetree Secondary School in Coquitlam, British Columbia. The start of the Pinetree GSA garnered national media attention, and its members continued to play a role in public affairs by meeting with successive provincial Ministers of Education, testifying before the B.C. Safe Schools Task Force on anti-bullying, and delivering workshops to students and educators about LGBT-sensitive inclusive language and how to start GSAs. In early 2002, the Pinetree GSA held the first Pride Day at a high school in Canada. The Pride Day included an information fair with booths from various local LGBTQ organizations, PrideTalk workshops delivered in numerous classes, and an assembly with a talk on transgender rights and a performance by G.L.A.S.S., a local LGBTQ youth choir.

As of 2011, 41% of schools in British Columbia were reported to have a GSA.

===== Alberta =====
The first GSA in Alberta was started in 2000 at the Lindsay Thurber Comprehensive High School in Red Deer. While members initially feared backlash, there was little-to-no negative reaction to the club.

In 2011, the Edmonton public school board introduced a policy which mandates that all school principals must establish a GSA if asked for one by students. The same year, the school board assigned a district consultant to provide support for GSAs within the city and host a monthly meeting for GSA members to network.

In 2017, the NDP government of Alberta introduced Bill 24, the &quot;Act to Support Gay–Straight Alliances&quot;, which mandated that all schools within the province allow student to create a GSA, allow them to explicitly name it a gay–straight alliance or queer-straight alliance, and prohibits school officials from notifying parents if their child joined a GSA. Schools that do not comply with the bill&#x27;s requirement are subject to lose government funding. Following the release of the bill, there was disapproval from some politicians and parents. In April 2018, the Justice Centre for Constitutional Freedoms (JCCF) filed a Court of Queen&#x27;s Bench challenge application claiming that prohibiting school officials from notifying parents when their child joins a GSA violates their constitutional rights.

The New Democratic Party of Alberta filibustered for changes to the Bill 8 (The Education Amendment Act) since the United Conservative Party (UCP) defeated all amendments that would protect LGBTQ teachers and staff over their sexual orientation and gender identity. The UCP have removed protections that were in the 2017 Bill 24, Bill 8 allows for students to be outed by school teachers, administration or staff if a student asks for there to be a GSA or QSA. Albertan schools are no longer compelled to act in an urgent manner in the student&#x27;s request for a GSA or QSA, allowing the school to take as much time as desired without facing penalties that were in Bill 24.

===== Saskatchewan =====
In Saskatchewan, Carlton Comprehensive High School houses one of the first GSA movements in the city of Prince Albert. The first GSA in the city of Saskatoon first met on March 18, 2003, at Mount Royal Collegiate. Since then, GSAs have been established at Nutana, Walter Murray, Evan Hardy, Marion Graham, Bedford Road and Aden Bowman Collegiates. The city of North Battleford Saskatchewan, had their first GSA in 2004 at Sakewew High School, a First Nations school.

Saskatchewan&#x27;s first GSA summit took place on April 15, 2016, in Saskatoon.

===== Manitoba =====
In 2013, the Manitoba government introduced Bill 18, &quot;The Public Schools Amendment Act (Safe and Inclusive Schools)&quot;. This act required school board to accommodate all student requests to form GSAs.

===== Ontario =====
The first elementary school GSA in Ontario was started in 2008 at the Sunnyside Public School in Kitchener.

In Ontario, Arnprior District High school, a small rural Ottawa Valley town started a GSA created by the students in 2009. This GSA won one of three Jer&#x27;s Vision &quot;Youth Role Model of The Year&quot; awards in April 2009. The next year a GSA was founded by students in 2010 at Renfrew Collegiate Institute in the town of Renfrew.

In December 2011, the government of the most populous Canadian province, Ontario, announced it would bring a legislation making it mandatory for all publicly funded schools to support the formation of &quot;tolerance clubs&quot; and student associations. Gay–straight clubs were to be specifically mentioned in that act. The main focus of that Bill 14 would be to counterattack bullying of students, particularly those of a racial or sexual minority.

Beyond a school group the Toronto District School Board has been committed to an unwritten alliance with their students. In addition to co-hosting the OUTShine GSA National Summit in 2013, they funded the Triangle Program at OASIS Alternative School, designed for gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender students who are at risk of dropping out or committing self-harm because of harassment in regular schools.

As of 2011, 37% of schools in Ontario were reported to have a GSA.

===== Quebec =====

===== New Brunswick =====
In 2008, the non-profit organization Pride in Education was founded to protect the safety and wellbeing of LGBTQ students in New Brunswick. In 2010, they held the first annual Pride in Education GSA Conference for students and teachers interested in creating GSAs.

The first GSA in New Brunswick was founded in 2013 at Woodstock High School following the suggestion of Svend Robinson.

===== Prince Edward Island =====
The University of Prince Edward Island&#x27;s Social Justice Studies program founded shOUT!, an annual conference aimed as GSAs but open to the public, in 2013.

===== Nova Scotia =====
In 1998, The Youth Project, a non-profit focused on LGBTQ youth in Nova Scotia, received funding from Health Canada to increase education about LGBTQ in schools. Through this initiative, the organization was able to found the first GSA in Nova Scotia at Millwood High School. The Youth Project currently hosts a list of all GSAs in the province on their website.

===== Newfoundland and Labrador =====
The first GSA conference in Newfoundland and Labrador was held at Corner Brook Regional High in 2013.&lt;ref name=&quot;Corner Brook High to host first gay/straight provincial conference&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Yukon =====
While the Yukon Department of Education does not have specific legislation regarding GSA, it does have a policy which mandates safety and inclusion for LGBTQ students which has been used in the justification for GSAs. Additionally, the territory mandates that all schools must appoint a staff member as a &quot;safe contact&quot; to provide support for LGBTQ students.

In 2013, a group of student requested to start a GSA at Vanier Catholic Secondary in Whitehorse. The school initially denied this request as it conflicted with the school&#x27;s Catholic, anti-gay policies. Students of the school protested the denial by wearing pink shirts and holding a sit-in at the Yukon legislative building and wearing rainbow socks to their graduation ceremony. Following the protests, the Yukon Department of Education overturned the school&#x27;s policy regarding GSAs as it did not meet the mandates outlines in the department&#x27;s Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity Policy

===== Northwest Territories =====

===== Nunavut =====
The only GSA in Nunavut is at Inuksuk High School in Iqaluit.

==== Hong Kong ====
In 2008, students at The University of Hong Kong founded Queer Straight Alliance (QSA), a registered society under Hong Kong laws. For several years it was the only GSA in the city, and it serves students in all campuses through social activities, career support and advocacy. In more recent years, university students in the city have formed other student LGBTQ groups. However, GSA efforts in secondary schools remain limited, if any.

==== India ====
The first GSA in India was started in Tagore International School in New Delhi in 2014 by a group of students and their mentor Shivanee Sen who had formed a pro-LGBTQ group initiative known as &#x27;Breaking Barriers&#x27; which was the first student-led campaign in India to address LGBTQI (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, intersex) issues. This group was first inspired to care and focus on the lives of oppressed students and hijras, a community of transgender women, intersex individuals, and eunuchs in India who are marginalized both socially and economically.

At Presidency University, Kolkata, around 100 students have formed a GSA group called Ardhek Akash, which also produces a magazine of the same name. In recent months the group has formed new chapters at Jadavpur University and St. Xavier&#x27;s College—also in Calcutta—and is looking to expand further.

==== Mexico ====
The first GSA in Mexico was begun by a group of students in 2004 at the American School Foundation, a private American school in Mexico City. The GSA was initially opposed by several school board members and a small group of religious conservative parents. But the students eventually won and formed the student club. The GSA&#x27;s co-advisor, Ian K. Macgillivray, wrote several articles detailing his students&#x27; experiences, as well as the book, &quot;Gay–Straight Alliances: A Handbook for Students, Educators, and Parents&quot; (2007, Harrington Park Press).

==== Netherlands ====
The first GSAs in the Netherlands were started in 2009. At the beginning of 2011, a nationwide campaign was started on television to promote GSAs in Dutch schools, featuring several well-known young actors and singers. A number of GSAs already exist in a wide variety of Dutch schools throughout the country, most of them at the university level, but increasingly popular on secondary school level.

==== New Zealand ====
Nelson College, the Nelson College for Girls, Nayland College and other schools have had GSAs set up, often with the support of youth mental health bodies. Kira Byrne, a GSA leader at Nelson College for Girls, says that the legalization of same-sex marriage in New Zealand in 2013 created shifts in attitudes towards LGBTQ people in New Zealand, but that boys at Nelson College were afraid to go to the GSA there because &quot;other boys would wait outside to beat up anyone that came out.&quot;

==== Portugal ====
ILGA Portugal, inspired by the gay–straight alliance model, introduced the Aliança da Diversidade (Diversity Alliance) project in the northern region of the country. The initiative, similar to GSA, aimed to establish secondary level student groups, including teachers, to enhance the safety and inclusivity of Portuguese schools. The focus was on fostering an environment that embraced diversity, particularly regarding sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, and sex characteristics (SOGIESC).

The primary objectives included integrating LGBTI students, eradicating the various forms of discrimination experienced related to SOGIESC within the school context. The overarching goals were aligned with promoting citizenship, human rights, and gender equality. The project received co-financing from the Programa Operacional de Inclusão Social e Emprego, Portugal 2020, and the European Social Fund.

As a complementary effort to ADD, a national school environment Study was initiated. This study aimed to gather insights into the experiences of LGBTI or questioning youth. Telmo Fernandes, the ADD project coordinator, highlighted that the collected responses underscored the persistent issues of isolation and discrimination, emphasizing the need for the intended change.

Alianças da Diversidade groups were established in various schools across the country, including locations such as Ovar municipality, Ramada parish and in the city of Ermesinde. The project officially ran from mid-2017 to February 2019, but the groups created during this period could continue independently, promoting the same objectives.

In addition to the ADD project, GSA-like groups have also been formed in universities, including those in Lisbon and Braga.

==== United Kingdom ====
In the UK, there has always been more of an emphasis on stand alone lesbian and gay youth groups that take place outside of the school setting, often funded by the local health authority or education service. The first GSA in the UK was founded in 2000 by CN Lester at Putney High School GDST, and led in part to the formation of Queer Youth Network. The second GSA in the UK was started in 2010 at Shimna Integrated College in Northern Ireland. Another GSA started in 2012 by Copland Community school in Wembley. The setting up of the club has subsequently resulted in the school being known for &quot;tackling homophobic prejudice&quot;. Acland Burghley school in Camden set up a gay–straight alliance in 2012 called &quot;Connected&quot;.

== Goal ==
The goal of most gay–straight alliances is to make their school community safe, facilitate activism on campus, and create a welcoming environment for LGBTQ students. They are part of the LGBT student movement and participate in national campaigns to raise awareness, such as the Day of Silence, National Coming Out Day, No Name Calling Week, Transgender Day of Remembrance, Harvey Milk Day, GSA day or locally organized campaigns, such as Take It Back: Anti-Slur Campaign, Beyond the Binary, LGBTQ-Inclusive Curriculum and others. Many GSAs work with local chapters of the Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network (GLSEN) or Gay–Straight Alliance Network, a national organization supporting youth leadership. The registered number of GSAs with GLSEN is over 4,000, as of 2008. In California, there are over 900 GSAs registered with GSA Network, representing over half of California&#x27;s high schools. Over half the states in the United States have one or more statewide groups that work with GSAs. Many of these state based groups and local chapters of GLSEN participate in the National Association of GSA Networks. GSA Networks have been formed to help local area students to network and connect to local resources, provide training for youth leaders, and sponsor local GSA efforts.

The inclusion of cisgender heterosexual allies in the missions of these groups &quot;is an important distinguishing factor from early support groups for LGBTQ teens, and recognizes the need for a comprehensive approach to youth safety&quot;, and attempts to build a network of support for non-heterosexual and transgender teens, as well as raise awareness of homophobia and heterosexism.

== Impact ==

=== Outcomes ===

==== Social ====
LGBTQ students routinely experience harassment in their schools. However, GSAs and other support clubs have been found to provide social support for LGBTQ students. Students have reported hearing homophobic remarks from both students and instructors in their schools. In addition, the more harassment students reported, the more likely the student also reported higher levels of depression and lower self-esteem. However, LGBTQ students attending a school with an active support club reported hearing less homophobic expressions and experienced less victimization than LGBTQ students attending a school without a GSA or support club. In addition, LGBTQ students with a GSA in their high school reported more positive outcomes when it came to high school belonging and school victimization.

In addition to the mere presence of a GSA on campus, level of participation in a GSA has also been linked to the amount of social support reported by LGBTQ students. A 2011 study by Toomey, Ryan, Diaz and Russell (2011) found that the presence of a GSA, participation in a GSA, and perceived effectiveness of a GSA were each individually associated with youth&#x27;s well-being. In certain cases, research showed these three factors protected youth&#x27;s well-being against victimization. Furthermore, youths who participated in a GSA reported lower levels of depression and higher self-esteem.

GSAs are important not only at the individual level, but also to promote the education of LGBTQ issues to school populations. GSA&#x27;s have been found to promote social activism. Researchers have argued that GSAs are a grassroots student initiated form of activism. The same researchers claimed that GSAs are important to challenge the status quo, confront discrimination, and reconceptualize gender.

==== Academic ====
LGBTQ youths in schools across the US are subject to serious obstacles that may impact their ability to perform in school. A 2011 study found that two thirds of LGBTQ students reported feeling unsafe at school. Some students felt so unsafe that they reported missing school due to safety concerns. The same study found that the GPA of LGBTQ children was, on average, half a grade lower than straight. This may be an indicator that LGBTQ youth face different barriers to education than straight youth.

LGBTQ youth&#x27;s school experience may impact their life decisions. LGBTQ youth in high school were less likely to report that they wanted to pursue further education than straight youth. These findings suggest that LGBTQ youths&#x27; negative experiences in primary education relate to their decision not to continue on in the education system. This then robs LGBTQ youth of all of the opportunities that advanced education offers.

However, an active GSA on a high school campus has been associated with better academic outcomes for LGBTQ students. LGBTQ youth attending schools with an active GSA were less likely to report feeling unsafe at school and were less likely to miss school due to a threat to their safety. Additionally, LGBTQ youths who had an active GSA at their high school reported higher educational attainment than LGBTQ youth who did not have a GSA on their high school campus.

==== Health ====
GSAs/QSAs are associated with better mental health outcomes, such as less depression, less general psychological distress, and higher self-esteem than students without a GSA at their high school. The positive impacts of GSAs/QSAs in students&#x27; lives include: increase in school attendance and attachment to the school, sense of empowerment and hope, new friendships, reduction in stress and isolation, increase in confidence and sense of pride. Students in schools that had an active GSA also reported less truancy). LGBTQ students with a support club in their school also reported lower levels of victimization and suicide attempts in comparison to schools without a support group).

GSAs have also been associated with other reduced health risk factors. LGBTQ students with a GSA in their high school reported more positive outcomes when it came to alcohol use and problems related to alcohol use. LGBTQ students with support groups in their schools reported half as much dating violence and less casual sex. Students with an active GSA in their high school were also less likely to be threatened or injured at school in comparison to students without an active GSA.

=== On students ===
GSAs are associated with benefits for LGBTQ students while they are attending school and beyond. The next important step is to understand why GSAs are associated with these benefits. One qualitative study found that the most beneficial aspect of a GSA was that it provides direct support to LGBTQ members and helps create a support network for LGBTQ students by connecting them. Another qualitative study found that GSAs were beneficial to LGBTQ students because they act as a protective factor for LGBTQ students&#x27; educational and social experience in school. The study further explained that GSAs provided LGBTQ students with a sense of identity within their school, improved their self-esteem, and even provided students with courage and support to come out to their families and peers.

One study investigated some of the possible factors within GSAs to discover which specific components of GSAs were associated with which beneficial outcomes. This study found that when GSA advisors served for longer periods of time, students had better health outcomes. In addition, LGBTQ students who perceived they had more control over their GSA experience and LGBTQ students who perceived their school to be more supportive had healthier outcomes. In addition, this study reported that &quot;students level of GSA advocacy also predicted students&#x27; sense of life purpose.&quot;

=== After secondary school ===
The relationship between having a GSA in a high school and attitudes towards LGBTQ individuals does not end after high school. The mere presence of a GSA, whether or not students participated in said GSA, is related to students&#x27; attitudes toward LGBTQ people beyond their time in their high school. University students who reported having a GSA in their high school were more likely to report positive attitudes towards LGBTQ individuals while attending their university. This was true for all students except students whom were raised in the southern U.S. where having a GSA in one&#x27;s high school actually correlated with less positive attitudes toward LGBTQ individuals.

=== Summary ===
GSAs are associated with positive social academic and health outcomes for LGBTQ students. The relationship between having a GSA in one&#x27;s high school and certain positive social outcomes is known to last beyond high school, however little beyond that is known about the long lasting associations with high school GSAs. Further research should be conducted on the lasting effects if GSAs for LGBTQ individuals. Researchers have also claimed that GSAs are important not only to LGBTQ students, but also to change the school climate as a whole to be more informed and respectful of LGBTQ issues. It has also been claimed that GSAs are important to get students involved in social activism. Researchers should investigate the relationship between having a GSA in a high school the school&#x27;s social climate. Due to the positive associations between GSAs and student outcomes, school faculty including school psychologists and counselors should become social justice advocates for LGBTQ students by supporting GSAs on their campuses.

=== Accomplishments ===
The various accomplishments since the founding of the GSAs include:
* GSAs have played a great leadership role in the grassroots by organizing the passage of many ground-breaking, statewide legislations, like the AB 537: The California Student Safety and Violence Prevention Act of 2000 which prohibits discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity.
* It has achieved a critical victory as the plaintiff in the first lawsuit filed under AB 537; which was a three-year settlement agreement which required the Visalia schools to enact sweeping reforms including mandatory teacher and student trainings that would be supportive to LGBTQ students.
* It also helped to pass 11 key laws to protect LGBTQ youth and create safer school environment.
* They also launched the National Association of GSA Networks in 2005 to unite statewide organizations to support GSAs and to accelerate the growth and impact of the GSA movement nationwide. To date, there are 40 states which have joined the National Association in the United States of America alone.

== GSA Network ==
The GSA Network is an LGBTQ rights organization founded in 1998 by Carolyn Laub to empower youth activists to start GSA clubs in their respective schools to motivate and inspire fellow students to fight against homophobia and transphobia. Laub initially started working with this movement in 40 GSA clubs in the San Francisco Bay area during 1988–99 and then gradually expanded to other cities and states. By 2001, The GSA Network became a statewide organization having branches in other schools in different parts of the state. In the year 2005, it began operating programs nationally. The year 2008 saw the GSA network become incorporated as its own independent 501(c)3 non-profit organization. Prior to that, it was a fiscally sponsored project of The Tides Center. In 2015, the network hired two long time staff to serve as Co-Executive Directors to replace outgoing founder and Executive Director Carolyn Laub. In 2016, the &quot;Gay–Straight Alliance Network&quot; formally changed its name to &quot;Genders &amp; Sexualities Alliance Network&quot; and continues to network organizations representing over 4000 GSA clubs across the nation.

The GSA Network organization is based in Oakland and has regional offices in Los Angeles, Fresno, Chicago, and Atlanta.

<text>The National Crime Syndicate was a multi-ethnic, closely connected, American confederation of several criminal organizations. It mostly consisted of and was led by the closely interconnected Italian American Mafia and Jewish Mob. It also involved, to a lesser extent, other ethnic criminal organizations such as the Irish Mob and African-American crime groups. Hundreds of murders were committed by Murder, Inc. on behalf of the National Crime Syndicate during the 1930s and 1940s.

==History==
According to writers on organized crime, the Syndicate was an idea of Johnny &quot;Fox&quot; Torrio, and was founded or established at a May 1929 conference in Atlantic City. It was attended by leading underworld figures throughout the United States, including Torrio, Charles &quot;Lucky&quot; Luciano, Al &quot;Big Al&quot; Capone, Benjamin &quot;Bugsy&quot; Siegel, Frank &quot;Prime Minister&quot; Costello, Meyer &quot;Little Man&quot; Lansky, Joe &quot;Joey A&quot; 
 Adonis, Dutch Schultz, Abner &quot;Longie&quot; Zwillman, Louis &quot;Lepke&quot; Buchalter, Gambino crime family head Vincent Mangano, Atlantic City Crime Syndicate boss Nucky Johnson, gambler Frank Erickson, Frank Scalice, and Albert &quot;Mad Hatter&quot; Anastasia. Others described the Atlantic City meeting as a coordination and strategy conference for bootleggers. According to the findings of the United States Senate Special Committee in the 1950s, chaired by Estes Kefauver, the National Crime Syndicate was a confederation of mainly Italian and Jewish organized crime groups throughout the United States.

The media dubbed the enforcement arm of the Syndicate &quot;Murder, Inc.&quot;, a gang of Brooklyn mafiosi who carried out murders in the 1930s and 1940s for various crime bosses. It was headed by Buchalter and Anastasia, who reported to commission members Lansky and Adonis, and included many infamous mobsters. 

Murder Inc. consisted of two factions. One was the Jewish Brownsville Boys headed by Abe &quot;Kid Twist&quot; Reles, who reported to Lepke Buchalter and Jacob &quot;Gurrah&quot; Shapiro. The other was the Italian Ocean Hill Hooligans led by Harry &quot;Happy&quot; Maione, who reported to Albert Anastasia. Bugsy Siegel was involved in many of Murder Inc.&#x27;s murders, but as a leading figure instead of a soldier.

In his biography of Meyer Lansky, &quot;Little Man&quot; (1991), journalist Robert Lacey argued that no National Crime Syndicate ever existed. &quot;The idea of a National Crime Syndicate is often confused with the Mafia. Yet they are not the same thing,&quot; probably referring to the American Mafia.

Although many of its members were imprisoned, and some were executed, the demise of the organization is as uncertain as its origins. By the late 1940s, Murder Inc. and most of its non-Italian components were defunct. Some individuals, such as Lansky, continued to operate as affiliates of Italian groups.

<doc id="458126" wikidata="Q14528" url="?curid=458126" title="Fine Young Cannibals">
<text>Fine Young Cannibals (FYC) were an English pop rock band formed in Birmingham, England, in 1984 by former The Beat band bassist David Steele and guitarist Andy Cox with singer Roland Gift (formerly of the Akrylykz). Their self-titled 1985 debut album contained &quot;Johnny Come Home&quot; and a cover of &quot;Suspicious Minds&quot;, two songs that were top 40 hits in the UK, Canada, Australia and Europe. Their 1989 album, &quot;The Raw &amp; the Cooked&quot;, topped the UK, US, Australian and Canadian album charts, and contained their two &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 number ones: &quot;She Drives Me Crazy&quot; and &quot;Good Thing&quot;.

In 1990, the band won two Brit Awards: Best British Group and Best British Album (for &quot;The Raw &amp; the Cooked&quot;).

== History ==
The group was formed in 1984 after the dissolution of The Beat, with whom Cox and Steele previously played. Their name came from the 1960 film &quot;All the Fine Young Cannibals&quot; starring Robert Wagner and Natalie Wood. The duo of Steele and Cox spent eight months listening to over 500 cassettes of potential singers before picking Gift. They had difficulty obtaining a record contract, but when a video of their song &quot;Johnny Come Home&quot; appeared on British TV show &quot;The Tube&quot;, recording contract offers flowed in immediately. The band&#x27;s eponymous debut album was released in 1985, spawning two UK hit singles, &quot;Johnny Come Home&quot; and a cover of Elvis Presley&#x27;s &quot;Suspicious Minds&quot; featuring additional vocals by Jimmy Somerville. The two songs also became hits internationally, charting in the top 40 in Europe, Canada, and Australia although they failed to make a significant impact on the US charts.

Fine Young Cannibals appeared as the house band in a nightclub in the 1987 comedy film &quot;Tin Men&quot; and also contributed songs to the film&#x27;s soundtrack, including &quot;Good Thing&quot;.

In the gap between their first and second albums, Steele and Cox released the instrumental house single &quot;Tired of Getting Pushed Around&quot; in 1987 as &quot;Two Men, a Drum Machine and a Trumpet&quot;, which reached No. 18 in the UK Singles Chart and was popular on the U.S. dance chart. During this time, Gift appeared in the movie &quot;Sammy and Rosie Get Laid&quot;.

The band continued their international success with the singles &quot;She Drives Me Crazy&quot; and &quot;Good Thing&quot;, from the 1989 album &quot;The Raw &amp; the Cooked&quot;. Both songs reached #1 in the United States. &quot;She Drives Me Crazy&quot; also topped the Australian chart for three non-consecutive weeks and peaked at #5 in the UK, while &quot;Good Thing&quot; peaked at #7 in both countries. &quot;The Raw &amp; the Cooked&quot; included three songs the band had recorded for &quot;Tin Men&quot; (including &quot;Good Thing&quot;), and their cover of the Buzzcocks&#x27; &quot;Ever Fallen in Love (With Someone You Shouldn&#x27;t&#x27;ve)&quot; recorded for the film &quot;Something Wild&quot;.

In 1990, the band contributed a version of Cole Porter&#x27;s &quot;Love for Sale&quot; to the AIDS research benefit album &quot;Red Hot + Blue&quot;, produced by the Red Hot Organization.

Fine Young Cannibals disbanded in 1992, although they briefly returned to the studio in 1996 to record a new single, &quot;The Flame&quot;, for the greatest hits compilation &quot;The Finest&quot;.

<doc id="458133" wikidata="Q1500069" url="?curid=458133" title="Thompson Twins">
<text>Thompson Twins were a British pop band, formed in 1977 in Sheffield. Initially a new wave group, they switched to a more mainstream pop sound and achieved considerable popularity during the early and mid-1980s, scoring a string of hits in the United Kingdom, the United States, and around the world. In 1993, they changed their name to Babble, to reflect their change in music from pop to dub-influenced chill-out. They continued as Babble until 1996, at which point the group permanently broke up.

The band&#x27;s name was based on the two bumbling detectives Thomson and Thompson (who are close doubles, not twins) in the English-language version of &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot; (). At various stages they had up to seven members, but their best known line-up was as a trio from 1982 to 1986. The band became a prominent act in the US during the Second British Invasion, and in 1985 performed at Live Aid in Philadelphia, where they were joined on stage by Madonna.

==Career==
===Early days===
In 1977, the original Thompson Twins line-up consisted of Tom Bailey on bass guitar and vocals, Pete Dodd on guitar and vocals, John Roog on guitar, and Jon Podgorski (known as &quot;Pod&quot;) on drums.

Arriving in London with little money, they lived as squatters in Lillieshall Road, Clapham. Future Thompson Twins member Alannah Currie lived in another squat in the same street, which is how she met Bailey. Their roadie at that time was John Hade, who lived in the same house, and who later became their manager.

As Podgorski had decided to stay in the north, the group auditioned for drummers at the Point Studio in Victoria, London. Andrew Edge joined them on drums for 18 months, and went on to join Savage Progress, who later toured with the Thompson Twins as the support act on the band&#x27;s 1984 UK tour.

In 1980, the band (now consisting of Bailey, Dodd, Roog and drummer Chris Bell, who had replaced Edge the previous year) released their first single, &quot;Squares and Triangles&quot;, on their own Dirty Discs label. A follow-up single, &quot;She&#x27;s in Love with Mystery&quot;, was issued later that year.

===Line-up changes===

In 1981, the line-up became Bailey, Dodd, Roog, Bell and two new members: former band roadie Joe Leeway on congas and percussion, and Jane Shorter on saxophone. This line-up recorded the debut Thompson Twins studio album &quot;A Product Of... (Participation)&quot;, documented in the film &quot;Listen to London&quot; (1981). Currie, who had been associated with the band for a few years, played and sang on their debut studio album, but was not yet a full member.

After their debut studio album, the band&#x27;s line-up shifted yet again. Saxophonist Jane Shorter left and was replaced by Currie (who also played percussion), and bassist Matthew Seligman, a former member of the Soft Boys and the Fallout Club, joined; leaving Bailey to switch to keyboards, with Leeway starting to handle lead vocals on some tracks.

The band signed a recording contract with Arista Records and released their second studio album &quot;Set&quot;. Thomas Dolby played some keyboards on &quot;Set&quot; and some live gigs, for Bailey at that time had little experience with synthesizers. &quot;Set&quot; contained the single &quot;In the Name of Love&quot;, sung and largely written by Bailey. It became a No. 1 dance club hit in the US, and an album titled &quot;In the Name of Love&quot; (consisting mainly of tracks from &quot;Set&quot;, with two others from &quot;A Product Of... (Participation)&quot;) was released in the US to capitalize on the song&#x27;s popularity. It entered the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200.

===Trio===

After the success of &quot;In the Name of Love&quot;, Bailey, Currie and Leeway, wanting to pursue the single&#x27;s different sound, toyed with the idea of starting a new band on the side, which they planned to call &#x27;The Bermuda Triangle&#x27;. When &quot;In the Name of Love&quot; (and its parent studio album &quot;Set&quot;) failed to make a substantial impact in the UK record charts, this plan was abandoned. However, at the same time, manager Hade convinced Bailey, Leeway and Currie to downsize the Thompson Twins to a core of the three in April 1982. Accordingly, the other four members of the band were notified that the band was breaking up; they were each paid £500 and were allowed to keep their instruments and equipment in exchange for an understanding not to perform together under the name &quot;Thompson Twins&quot;.

The remaining Thompson Twins, who had not in fact broken up, decided to go abroad to free themselves of any UK influence, as well as to combine the songwriting for their first studio album as a trio with a long holiday. They first went to Egypt and then to the Bahamas, where they recorded at Compass Point Studios in Nassau with record producer Alex Sadkin.

Bailey commented on the band&#x27;s reduction to a trio in a 1983 interview: &quot;When we reformed the band, we were making a statement. We weren&#x27;t going to be a rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll band, we weren&#x27;t going to have a guitar. We were going to move on. You know, Lou Reed said whenever he played live he ended up going back to heroin music. There are old associations, associations we don&#x27;t want because they don&#x27;t reflect the way we feel today. ... Right now, technology is what&#x27;s important, and that&#x27;s what our music tries to reflect.&quot;

===International success===
The band broke into the UK Singles Chart and the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart at the beginning of 1983 with &quot;Lies&quot; and &quot;Love On Your Side&quot;, which became the band&#x27;s first UK Top 10 single. They then released their third studio album, &quot;Quick Step &amp; Side Kick&quot; (called simply &quot;Side Kicks&quot; in the US), which peaked at number 2 in the UK and was later certified platinum. Further singles followed with &quot;We Are Detective&quot; (another Top 10 UK hit) and &quot;Watching&quot; (UK No. 33). All three band members worked collectively on songwriting with Currie providing lyrics and Bailey melodies. In addition Leeway was responsible for stagecraft, Currie for music videos and imagery and Bailey for musicianship and production. During 1983, the band had the opening spot on the Police&#x27;s concert tour in the US.

Following the band&#x27;s reduction to a trio, designer Andy Airfix created a logo consisting of outlines of their heads and respective hairstyles. It was voted fourth best out of 13 candidates by &quot;Classic Pop Magazine&quot; in May 2022.

&quot;Hold Me Now&quot; was released in late 1983. The song was an international chart success, peaking at No. 4 in their native UK where it became the band&#x27;s biggest seller earning a gold disc, and reached No. 3 in the US in the spring of 1984 becoming their biggest American hit. 

The band&#x27;s fourth studio album, &quot;Into the Gap&quot;, was released in February 1984 and became one of the year&#x27;s biggest sellers, selling five million copies worldwide. It topped the UK Albums Chart and was later certified double platinum there. Further hit singles from the album followed with &quot;Doctor! Doctor!&quot; (UK No. 3) and &quot;You Take Me Up&quot; (UK No. 2, their highest UK singles chart placing and which earned a silver disc). Other singles included a new version of the album track &quot;Sister of Mercy&quot; (UK No. 11), and &quot;The Gap&quot; (though this was not released in the UK). The band embarked on a world tour in support of the album, which had also made the US top ten.

A brand new single, &quot;Lay Your Hands on Me&quot;, was released in the UK in late 1984 and reached No. 13 on the UK Singles Chart. Following this, the band parted company with their producer Alex Sadkin and opted to produce their fifth studio album, &quot;Here&#x27;s to Future Days&quot;, by themselves in Paris. However, in March 1985, while promoting their new single &quot;Roll Over&quot; and the forthcoming studio album, Bailey collapsed in his London hotel room from nervous exhaustion. The &quot;Roll Over&quot; single was then cancelled at the last minute and the new album postponed. Though the band had chosen to produce themselves, the postponement caused them to rethink the project and producer Nile Rodgers was subsequently called in to rework the album with them. The album was eventually released in September 1985, reaching the UK Top 5 and US Top 20, though failed to come close to the success of &quot;Into the Gap&quot;. It was preceded by the single &quot;Don&#x27;t Mess with Doctor Dream&quot; (UK No. 15) and followed by the single &quot;King for a Day&quot;, which peaked at No. 22 in the UK, but reached No. 8 on the US chart. Other singles included a new US version of &quot;Lay Your Hands on Me&quot; (US No. 6), and a cover of the Beatles&#x27; 1968 hit &quot;Revolution&quot;, which failed to make the UK Top 40.

Prior to the album&#x27;s release, the Thompson Twins performed on the American leg of Live Aid in July 1985 and were joined onstage by Madonna. The planned summer 1985 tour of the UK (and a headlining appearance at the Glastonbury Festival) had to be cancelled due to Bailey&#x27;s health problems (fans with tickets received a free live album as compensation), though international dates were rescheduled and the latter half of 1985 saw sell out tours for the band in the US and Japan. A second planned tour of the UK in 1985 was also scrapped due to the promoter declaring bankruptcy.

===Duo===
Leeway left the band in 1986, and the remaining duo of Bailey and Currie carried on making music for another seven years. The act&#x27;s first release as a duo was the North America-only single &quot;Nothing in Common&quot;, released in July 1986. It peaked at No. 54 in the US, and No. 68 in Canada.

1987 saw the release of their sixth studio album &quot;Close to the Bone&quot; and the single &quot;Get That Love&quot;, which climbed to No. 31 in the US but only reached No. 66 in the UK. The album was a commercial flop. It spent only one week on the UK Albums Chart at No. 90 and yielded no further chart singles. 

&quot;In the Name of Love&quot; was given a new lease on life in 1988, after a remix by Shep Pettibone made the Top 50 in the UK. 1989 saw the release of another studio album, &quot;Big Trash&quot;, and a new recording contract with Warner Bros. Records. The single &quot;Sugar Daddy&quot; peaked at No. 28 in the US and would be their last brush with mainstream chart success. 1991&#x27;s &quot;Queer&quot; would be the band&#x27;s swansong, and was supported by various techno-inspired singles under the moniker of Feedback Max (in the UK) to disguise the identity of the band to club DJs. The single &quot;Come Inside&quot; reached No. 7 in the US Dance Chart and No. 1 in the UK Dance Chart.

Prior to this, Bailey and Currie (who were now a couple) had their first child together in 1988, and in the following years they spent a lot of time writing material for other artists including the hit single &quot;I Want That Man&quot; for Deborah Harry of Blondie in 1989. In 1990, Bailey and Currie contributed the song &quot;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?&quot; to the Cole Porter tribute album &quot;Red Hot + Blue&quot; produced by the Red Hot Organization. In 1991, Bailey and Currie were married in Las Vegas, US and the following year moved to New Zealand. In 1992, the Thompson Twins contributed the song &quot;Play with Me&quot; to the soundtrack of the Ralph Bakshi film &quot;Cool World&quot;; Bailey alone contributed a second track, &quot;Industry and Seduction&quot;. The following year, the duo teamed up with engineer Keith Fernley and changed their band name to Babble. They released two studio albums: &quot;The Stone&quot; (1993) and &quot;Ether&quot; (1996).

Thompson Twins declined to follow the example of many of their contemporaries and reform in order to tie in with a trend of nostalgia for the 1980s, although Bailey, Currie and Leeway appeared together on the UK Channel 4 show &quot;Top Ten Electro Bands&quot; in 2001. Thompson Twins were placed ninth.

==After the Twins==
Babble released two studio albums, &quot;The Stone&quot; (1993) and &quot;Ether&quot; (1996), with songs featured in the films &quot;Coneheads&quot; (1993) and &quot;With Honors&quot; (1994).

In the mid-1990s, Currie gave up the music business to set up her own glass-casting studio in Auckland and concentrated on raising her two children. In 2001, she founded and ran the anti-genetic engineering group called MAdGE (Mothers Against Genetic Engineering in food and the environment), and networked thousands of women across New Zealand in a resistance movement, aimed at keeping the biotech industry from using New Zealand as an experimental playground. Currie described this group as a &quot;rapidly growing network of politically non-aligned women who are actively resisting the use of genetically-engineered material in our food and on our land&quot;. During that time she designed a billboard to spark a debate on the ethics of genetically modifying cows with human genes to produce a new milk. The billboard, featuring a young woman with four breasts hooked up to a milking machine, caused huge controversy but won several international art awards. Bailey and Currie divorced in 2003, and both left New Zealand to live separately in the UK. Currie later married Jimmy Cauty (formerly of the KLF) and now lives and works in London. She is a visual artist who works under the pseudonym &quot;Miss Pokeno&quot;, as well as the Armchair Destructivists and The Sisters of Perpetual Resistance. As well as several solo shows in London her work has also been exhibited at both the Guildhall Art Gallery and the Geffrye Museum.

In 1999, Bailey produced and played keyboards on the studio album &quot;Mix&quot; by the New Zealand band Stellar, and won the Producer of the Year Award at the 2000 New Zealand Music Awards. He has also arranged soundtracks and has provided instrumental music for several films. He continues to make music under the moniker International Observer and has released the studio albums &quot;Seen&quot; (2001), &quot;All Played Out&quot; (2005), and &quot;Felt&quot; (2009). He also performs with the Holiwater group from India. He began performing live again as Thompson Twins&#x27; Tom Bailey in 2014 and has since toured the UK, North America and Japan. In 2016 he released his debut solo single, &quot;Come So Far&quot;. In 2018 Bailey released his debut solo studio album titled &quot;Science Fiction&quot;.

After leaving the Thompson Twins in 1986, Leeway briefly dabbled in acting and attempted a solo music career, though neither were successful. , he resides in Los Angeles, and works in the field of hypnotherapy. He is on the staff at the Hypnosis Motivation Institute (HMI) in the Los Angeles district of Tarzana, and is also a certified trainer in neuro-linguistic programming. 

The earlier members went on to do other things:
*Dodd and Roog formed a band called Big View (with Edge on drums) and recorded a single called, &quot;August Grass&quot;, which was released on Point Records (owned by Merton, the Thompson Twins publisher) in 1982. Dodd is now living back in Chesterfield working as a freelance journalist – and has released his own &quot;History of Rock&quot; album billed as Peter &amp; the Wolves. Dodd still sees Podgorski on a regular basis. Dodd and John Roog play in a band called &quot;The Flow&quot;
*Roog lives in Chesterfield, and was previously in a senior position in Tower Hamlets Adult Services, and the London Borough of Lambeth, until his retirement in 2011. He now plays in a band with Pete Dodd called the Flow.
*Seligman worked for a law firm in London and has played in the Soft Boys reunions as well as releasing his own studio albums. He had moved to Sendai, Japan with his Japanese wife and their daughter and, in 2009, contributed to the Thomas Dolby studio album &quot;A Map of the Floating City&quot;. In 2012, he collaborated with Jan Linton on the CD &quot;Sendai&quot;, a fundraiser for reconstruction after the 11 March Tōhoku earthquake. Seligman died in 2020 of complications from COVID-19.
*Bell moved from London to Bath, and played in or for Spear of Destiny, Gene Loves Jezebel and Hugh Cornwell of the Stranglers.
*Booth helped Chinese music artists in production and development. She is now a consultant and executive producer at RIBA since 9 February 2022.

==Tom Bailey solo shows==

Bailey performed Thompson Twins songs live for the first time in 27 years on 17 August 2014 at Temple Island Meadows, Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire, for the Rewind South Festival.

In 2014, Bailey also took part in the Retro Futura Tour in the US, along with Howard Jones, Midge Ure, China Crisis and Katrina Leskanich formerly of Katrina and the Waves.

He continues to tour internationally, under the moniker &quot;Thompson Twins&#x27; Tom Bailey,&quot; performing in the UK and also in North America in 2016.

In 2016, Bailey received the &quot;Classic Pop&quot; magazine&#x27;s &#x27;Best Live Show&#x27; award.

In 2018, Bailey toured the US with the B-52&#x27;s and Culture Club, dubbed The Life Tour.

On 3 September 2022, Bailey performed the entire &#x27;Into the Gap&#x27; studio album for the first time ever along with his band consisting of Alice Offley (bass guitar and backing vocals), Charlotte Raven (keyboards and cello) and Paulina Szczepaniak (drums and percussion) collectively known as &#x27;The Sisters of Mercy&#x27; in Aylesbury, UK (at the Aylesbury Waterside Theatre) to a sold out audience.

This performance also featured a surprise full live performance of Thompson Twins hit &quot;We Are Detective&quot;. Bailey had produced a reimagined purely instrumental version of the song that had served as the band&#x27;s walk-on music for live performances since 2014, but this was the first time the full song appeared as part of the actual set since Bailey&#x27;s return to performing Thompson Twins material. Alice Offley performed Alannah Currie&#x27;s vocal parts, in addition to playing bass.

<text>Jyoti Prakash Mishra (born 30 July 1966), better known by his stage name White Town, is a British-Indian singer, musician, and producer. He is best known for his 1997 hit song &quot;Your Woman&quot;.

==Early life==
Jyoti Prakash Mishra was born in Rourkela, India, on 30 July 1966, and emigrated to England with his family at the age of three. He grew up in Derby, England.

==Career==
White Town was originally the name of a band formed by Mishra in 1989, inspired by a Pixies concert he had attended. Initially, there were other members on guitar, bass, and drums; they played support gigs for various bands, most notably Primal Scream. In 1990, the project released its first self-financed record, &quot;White Town EP&quot;, on 7&quot; vinyl. This featured Nick Glyn-Davies on drums and Sean Deegan on bass, with Mishra on guitar and vocals. Sean Phillips, who is credited as a guitarist on the EP, joined the band shortly before the release. In time, Deegan and Glyn-Davies left and were replaced live by a drum machine and Leon Wilson on guitar. The rest of the band drifted away in 1990, and Mishra continued with the project as a one-man band from then on, occasionally collaborating with musicians such as Gary Thatcher of the Beekeepers on guitar.

The lead single from White Town&#x27;s second album, &quot;Women in Technology&quot;, titled &quot;Your Woman&quot;, reached No. 1 on the UK Singles Chart in January 1997. It also peaked at No. 1 in Spain and Iceland; No. 2 in Australia; No. 4 in Canada, Denmark, and Finland; and No. 23 on the U.S. Pop Airplay chart. After a troubled working relationship with EMI, Mishra was dropped from the label in 1997. Since then, he has gone back to working with indie labels such as Parasol Records. In 2006, he contributed the song &quot;The PNAC Cabal&quot; to the charity album &quot;Voyces United for UNHCR&quot;.

The EP &quot;A New Surprise&quot; was released in September 2006 by Swedish indie label Heavenly Pop Hits, and was followed by the album &quot;Don&#x27;t Mention the War&quot;, which launched Mishra&#x27;s own Bzangy Records label. A 7&quot; White Town single titled &quot;I Wanna Be Your Ex&quot;, with the B-side &quot;Rainy Day&quot;, was released by Golly Jane Records in November 2014. Mishra released the albums &quot;Deemab&quot; and &quot;Polyamory&quot; in 2019. As of March 2020, he accumulates over 500,000 Spotify streams per month; his work received a boost in popularity in 2020 when Dua Lipa sampled the same trumpet hook White Town sampled in &quot;Your Woman&quot; in her song &quot;Love Again&quot;.

==Artistry==
Mishra has said, &quot;I&#x27;m a mediocre singer, I&#x27;m a terrible guitarist, I&#x27;m a pretty good keyboardist, I&#x27;m a good producer, not amazing, but good.&quot; Noting his status as a one-hit wonder, he said it is &quot;better than a no-hit wonder&quot; and elaborated, &quot;To be a professional musician and to be entertaining people twenty years after my biggest hit, I feel like I&#x27;m the luckiest person alive. Just to have one song that connects with people—most musicians dream their entire lives of having that.&quot;

==Personal life==
Mishra became straight edge at the age of sixteen and is a radical Marxist; he has been outspoken about his beliefs.

<doc id="458143" wikidata="Q333643" url="?curid=458143" title="Satoshi Kon">
<text>was a Japanese film director, animator, screenwriter and manga artist from Sapporo, Hokkaido, and a member of the Japanese Animation Creators Association (JAniCA). He was a graduate of the Graphic Design department of the Musashino Art University. He is best known for his acclaimed anime films &quot;Perfect Blue&quot; (1997), &quot;Millennium Actress&quot; (2001), &quot;Tokyo Godfathers&quot; (2003), and &quot;Paprika&quot; (2006), and the TV series &quot;Paranoia Agent&quot; (2004).
In 2010, Kon died of pancreatic cancer at age 46.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Satoshi Kon was born on October 12, 1963. Due to his father&#x27;s job transfer, Kon&#x27;s education from the fourth elementary grade up to the second middle-school grade was based in Sapporo. Kon was a classmate and close friend of manga artist Seihō Takizawa. While attending Hokkaido Kushiro Koryo High School, Kon aspired to become an animator. Kon entered the Graphic Design course of the Musashino Art University in 1982.

===Early career===
While in college, Kon made his debut as a manga artist with the short manga &quot;Toriko&quot; (1984) and earned a runner-up spot in the 10th Annual Tetsuya Chiba Awards held by &quot;Young Magazine&quot; (Kodansha). Afterward, he found work as Katsuhiro Otomo&#x27;s assistant. After graduating from college in 1987, Kon authored the single-volume manga &quot;Kaikisen&quot; (1990) and wrote the script for Otomo&#x27;s live-action film &quot;World Apartment Horror&quot;.

In 1991, Kon worked in anime for the first time as an animator and on background design for the film &quot;Roujin Z&quot;, which was written by Otomo.

He began working around 1992 as a scriptwriter, layout artist and background designer for &quot;Magnetic Rose&quot; (directed by Koji Morimoto), one of three short films in Katsuhiro Otomo&#x27;s omnibus &quot;Memories&quot; (released in 1995). This was the first time he adopted &quot;the fusion of fantasy and reality&quot; as the theme of his work.

Kon worked as one of five layout artists on Mamoru Oshii&#x27;s &quot;Patlabor 2: The Movie&quot; in 1993, along with other animated films. He worked as a key animator on episode 2 of the 1993–1994 OVA &quot;JoJo&#x27;s Bizarre Adventure&quot;, and he worked as the writer and storyboard artist for episode 5.

Kon then worked with Mamoru Oshii on the manga &quot;Seraphim: Wings of 266,613,336&quot;, which was written by Oshii and drawn by Kon. The manga was serialized in the monthly anime magazine &quot;Animage&quot; starting in 1994. However, as the series progressed, the opinions of Kon and Oshii became divided, and the series went on hiatus and ended unfinished. After this work, Kon ended his career as a manga artist and devoted himself to making anime.

===Directing===
In 1997, Kon began work on his directorial debut &quot;Perfect Blue&quot; (based on Yoshikazu Takeuchi&#x27;s novel of the same name). It was the first film by Kon to be produced by Madhouse, and producer Masao Maruyama invited him because he was impressed in Kon&#x27;s work on &quot;JoJo&#x27;s Bizarre Adventure&quot;. A suspense story centered on a pop idol, Kon was initially unsatisfied with the first script based on the original and requested to make changes to it. With the permission of the original author, Yoshikazu Takeuchi, Kon was allowed to make any changes he wanted, except for keeping the three elements of the novel (&quot;idol,&quot; &quot;horror&quot; and &quot;stalker&quot;). The screenplay was written by Sadayuki Murai, who worked in the idea of a blurred border between the real world and imagination.

Following &quot;Perfect Blue&quot;, Kon considered adapting the 1993 Yasutaka Tsutsui novel &quot;Paprika&quot; into his next film. However, these plans were stalled when the distribution company for &quot;Perfect Blue&quot; (Rex Entertainment) went bankrupt. Coincidentally, Kon&#x27;s next work would also feature a film studio going bankrupt.

In 2002, Kon&#x27;s second film, &quot;Millennium Actress&quot;, was released to the public. The distribution company for the North American release was DreamWorks-affiliated Go Fish Pictures. The film centers on a retired actress who mysteriously withdraws from the public eye at the peak of her career. Having the same estimated budget as &quot;Perfect Blue&quot; (approximately 120 million yen), &quot;Millennium Actress&quot; garnered higher critical and financial success than its predecessor and earned numerous awards. The screenplay was written by Sadayuki Murai, who utilized a seamless connection between illusion and reality to create a &quot;Trompe-l&#x27;œil kind of film&quot;. &quot;Millennium Actress&quot; was the first Satoshi Kon film to feature Susumu Hirasawa, of whom Kon was a long-time fan, as composer.

In 2003, Kon&#x27;s third work, &quot;Tokyo Godfathers&quot;, was announced. The distribution company for the North American release was Sony Pictures-affiliated Destination Films. The film centers on a trio of homeless persons in Tokyo who discover a baby on Christmas Eve and set out to search for her parents. &quot;Tokyo Godfathers&quot; cost more to make than Kon&#x27;s previous two films (with a budget of approximately 300 million yen), and centered on the themes of homelessness and abandonment, with a comedic touch worked in. The screenplay was written by Keiko Nobumoto. This work also marked the transition from celluloid animation to digital animation.

In 2004, Kon released the 13-episode television series &quot;Paranoia Agent&quot;, in which Kon revisits the theme of the blending of imagination and reality, as well as working in additional social themes. The series was created from an abundance of unused ideas for stories and arrangements that Kon felt were good but did not fit into any of his projects.

In 2006, &quot;Paprika&quot; was announced, after having been planned out and materializing for several years. The story centers on a new form of psychotherapy that utilizes dream analysis to treat mental patients. The film was highly successful and earned a number of film awards. Kon summed up the film with —roughly, &quot;Everything but the fundamental story was changed.&quot; Much like Kon&#x27;s previous works, the film focuses on the synergy of dreams and reality.

He participated in the TV program &quot;Ani*Kuri15&quot; broadcast by NHK in 2007. His one-minute short film &quot;Ohayō&quot; was aired along with works by Mamoru Oshii, Makoto Shinkai and others. That same year, Kon helped establish and served as a member of the Japanese Animation Creators Association (JAniCA).

===Health deterioration and death===
Following &quot;Ohayō&quot;, Kon began work on his next film, &quot;Dreaming Machine&quot;. In May 2010, Kon was diagnosed with terminal pancreatic cancer. Given half a year to live, Kon chose to spend the remainder of his life in his home. Shortly before his death Kon composed a final message, which was uploaded to his blog by his family upon his death. As Kon explained in the message, he chose not to make news of his rapidly advancing illness public, in part out of embarrassment at how drastically emaciated and ravaged his body had become. The result was that the announcement of his death was met with widespread shock and surprise, particularly given that Kon had shown no signs of illness at relatively recent public events, as the cancer progressed to a terminal state in a matter of months after being diagnosed. Kon died on August 24, 2010, at the age of 46. After his death, Kon was mentioned among the &quot;Fond Farewells&quot; in &quot;Time&quot;″s people of the year 2010. Darren Aronofsky wrote a eulogy to him, which was printed in , a Japanese retrospective book of his animation career.

===&quot;Dreaming Machine&quot;===
In November 2010, Madhouse, the animation studio that had previously produced Kon&#x27;s works, officially announced that they would continue to produce the unfinished &quot;Yumemiru Kikai&quot;, and that the animation director Yoshimi Itazu would be acting as the director. According to Takeshi Honda, animator and frequent collaborator with Satoshi Kon, Kon disappeared in the middle of production on the movie. He had not informed most of the staff on the movie about his pancreatic cancer including producer Masao Maruyama. Maruyama recorded the script to the movie on Kon&#x27;s deathbed and promised to see the project to completion. However, the project was halted in 2011 due to financial reasons. As of 2013, the completion of &quot;Dreaming Machine&quot; remains uncertain due to funding difficulties, with only 600 of the 1,500 shots being animated.

At Otakon 2012, Madhouse founder Masao Maruyama, who was involved in all of Kon&#x27;s films from &quot;Perfect Blue&quot; to &quot;Paprika&quot; and was also his friend and collaborator, stated: &quot;Unfortunately, we still don&#x27;t have enough money. My personal goal is to get it within five years after his passing. I&#x27;m still working hard towards that goal.&quot;

In July 2015, Maruyama reported that &quot;Dreaming Machine&quot; remains in production but they are looking for a director to match Kon&#x27;s abilities and similar vision.

In August 2016, Mappa Producer Masao Maruyama said in an interview: &quot;For 4~5 years, I kept searching for a suitable director to complete Kon&#x27;s work. Before his death, the storyboard and script, even part of the keyframe film was already completed. Then I thought, even if someone can mimic Kon&#x27;s work, it would still be clear that it&#x27;s only an imitation. For example, if Mamoru Hosoda took the director&#x27;s position, the completed &quot;Dreaming Machine&quot; would still be a good piece of work. However, that would make it Hosoda&#x27;s movie, not Kon&#x27;s. &quot;Dreaming Machine &quot;should be Kon&#x27;s movie, him and only him, not someone else&#x27;s. That means we cannot and should not &quot;compromise&quot; only to finish it. I spent years to finally reach this hard conclusion. Instead, we should take only Kon&#x27;s &quot;original concept&quot;, and let somebody turn it into a feature film. By doing so, the completed piece could 100% be that person&#x27;s work, and I&#x27;m OK with that. I also considered about doing a documentary of Kon.&quot;

However, Maruyama has not completely given up on the production. He says, &quot;If a talented director from overseas is willing to take on the project, it is not entirely without possibility,&quot; suggesting that the project is not entirely without a chance of restarting.

==Themes==
The theme of &quot;mixture of fiction and reality&quot; is a keyword that symbolizes Kon Satoshi&#x27;s works, and he repeatedly depicts the relationship between &quot;fiction and reality&quot; with various approaches in each of his works. In &quot;Perfect Blue&quot;, &quot;Millennium Actress&quot;, &quot;Paranoia Agent&quot;, and &quot;Paprika&quot;, the boundary between fiction and reality gradually became blurred, and the characters were portrayed as going back and forth between fiction and reality. At first glance, &quot;Tokyo Godfathers&quot; does not seem to deal with the motif of &quot;fiction and reality,&quot; but it does have a device in which the &quot;fiction&quot; of &quot;miracles and coincidences&quot; is successively introduced into the realistic life of homeless people in Tokyo. Because of the character designs and the way they are expressed, Kon&#x27;s works seem to be aiming for realism. However, Kon&#x27;s goal is not to &quot;depict landscapes and people that look as if they are real&quot; but to &quot;depict the moment when landscapes and people that look as if they are real suddenly reveal themselves to be &#x27;fiction&#x27; or &#x27;pictures&#x27;. His ability to depict a realistic world, which he has demonstrated in order in the films he has participated in as a staff member, such as Otomo&#x27;s and Oshii&#x27;s works, is utilized in his own works to most effectively show the drop of &quot;transition from reality to fiction&quot;. The world that appears to be real in Kon&#x27;s works does not remain real, but is suddenly transformed into an unfamiliar world in order to disorient the audience. This is the reason why he insisted on animated films instead of live action.

When asked about his interest in female characters, Kon stated that female characters were easier to write because he is not able to know the character in the same way as a male character, and &quot;can project my obsession onto the characters and expand the aspects I want to describe.&quot; With a frame of reference up to &quot;Tokyo Godfathers&quot;, Susan J. Napier notes that while the theme of performance is the one obvious commonality in his works, she finds that the concept of the male gaze is the more important topic for discussion. Napier shows the evolution of Kon&#x27;s use of the gaze from its restrictive and negative aspects in &quot;Magnetic Rose&quot; and &quot;Perfect Blue&quot;, to a collaborative gaze in &quot;Millennium Actress&quot; before arriving at a new type of gaze in &quot;Tokyo Godfathers&quot; which revels in uncertainty and illusion.

Dean DeBlois said, &quot;Satoshi Kon used the hand-drawn medium to explore social stigmas and the human psyche, casting a light on our complexities in ways that might have failed in live action. Much of it was gritty, intense and, at times, even nightmarish. Kon didn&#x27;t shy away from mature subject matter or live-action sensibilities in his work, and his films will always occupy a fascinating middle ground between &#x27;cartoons&#x27; and the world as we know it.&quot;

==Influences==
Kon stated in 2007 that the music of Susumu Hirasawa had been the greatest influence on his expressive style.
Kon said that he has learned a lot from Hirasawa&#x27;s attitude towards music and production, and that he owes a lot of the stories and concepts he creates to his influence. Kon&#x27;s idea of fractal control of film comes from Susumu Hirasawa, who has applied fractal-generating programs to music production. Hirasawa&#x27;s lyrics sparked Kon&#x27;s interest in Jungian psychology and the writings of Hayao Kawai, Japan&#x27;s foremost expert on Jungian psychology, who has psychologically deciphered ancient myths and folktales, which greatly influenced his storytelling and direction. All of Kon&#x27;s works, from &quot;Perfect Blue&quot; to the suspended &quot;Dreaming Machine&quot;, have been inspired by Hirasawa&#x27;s lyrics and songs. Susumu Hirasawa&#x27;s &quot;Rotation (LOTUS-2)&quot;, which is the theme song of &quot;Millennium Actress&quot;, was played at Kon&#x27;s funeral.

Kon says that he is influenced by everything he has been exposed to in his life, including writing, painting, music, film, manga, anime, television and theater. He has learned a lot from Osamu Tezuka and Katsuhiro Otomo in manga, Hayao Miyazaki in animation, Akira Kurosawa and many other great Japanese and international directors in film.

He was familiarized with Tezuka&#x27;s manga and animation works such as &quot;Astro Boy&quot;, &quot;The Jungle Emperor&quot; and &quot;Princess Knight&quot; in his childhood.

He was an avid watcher of anime titles, such as &quot;Space Battleship Yamato&quot; (1974), &quot;Heidi, Girl of the Alps&quot; (1974), &quot;Future Boy Conan&quot; (1978), &quot;Galaxy Express 999&quot; (1978) and &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam&quot; (1979) during his junior and senior high school years, which Japanese anime fans of the time were crazy about.

Otomo had a strong influence on him, and his favorite works were &quot;&quot; and &quot;AKIRA&quot;, especially &quot;Domu&quot;, which he liked so much that he said if he could make a movie out of only one manga he had ever read, it would be that one.
He was also influenced by the movement in manga started by Otomo and others, and decided to not only read but also draw manga himself in his high school days. He was enlightened by the New Wave&#x27;s way of overwhelmingly depicting a story in which nothing in particular happens, focusing on a character who could never be the protagonist of the story. Kon has also said that his drawing style has been influenced by Otomo, as he used to work as Otomo&#x27;s assistant when he was a manga artist. After entering the animation industry, he was greatly influenced by animators Hiroyuki Okiura, Toshiyuki Inoue, Takeshi Honda, Masashi Ando and art setter Takashi Watabe.

He had been watching only live-action films since he started college. He watched most of the movies on video and made it a routine to draw manga based on the setting, format and direction of the scenes. Ninety percent of the films he watched were made in the U.S., and he said that he learned a lot about his own style of visual expression from Hollywood films. However, he was not influenced by any particular film or director, but by everything he had ever seen. For example, &quot;Millennium Actress&quot; has scenes that borrow images from Kurosawa&#x27;s &quot;Throne of Blood&quot;, Yasujiro Ozu&#x27;s films, the hero of the chambara film &quot;Kurama Tengu&quot;, or the great Japanese star &quot;Godzilla&quot;. The film that directly influenced &quot;Millennium Actress&quot; is George Roy Hill&#x27;s &quot;Slaughterhouse-Five&quot; (1972). When he was in college, it was not one film that influenced him the most, but the entire body of work of Terry Gilliam, including &quot;Time Bandits&quot; (1981), &quot;Brazil&quot; (1985) and &quot;The Adventures of Baron Munchausen&quot; (1989). However, the filmmaker whose works and books he had read the most is Akira Kurosawa.

As for novels, the works of Ryotaro Shiba, the Japanese historical novelist, had a great impact on Kon in terms of his own relationship with Japan. He was also very much inspired by Haruki Murakami, whose works have been translated into many foreign languages. He had seen the film &quot;Blade Runner&quot; (1982) before reading the novel and had not read all of his works, but Philip K. Dick was one of the authors he wanted to read and he became very interested in images of nightmares under his influence. He has been a long-time fan of Yasutaka Tsutsui since before he directed &quot;Paprika&quot;, and was especially influenced by reading Tsutsui&#x27;s works intensively when he was around 20 years old. It was such a fundamental influence that even he did not know how or where Tsutsui&#x27;s work influenced him. According to Kon, the appeal of Yasutaka Tsutsui&#x27;s work is &quot;deviation from common sense.&quot; What he learned from Tsutsui was &quot;doubt the framework of common sense.&quot;

==Legacy==
Kon has had a great influence on directors around the world even after his death, and artists and works have been influenced by his realistic visual expression and vivid editing. Kon&#x27;s influence on foreign filmmakers was more pronounced than in Japan, with directors such as Darren Aronofsky and Guillermo del Toro expressing their support.

American filmmaker Aronofsky is one of the directors greatly influenced by Kon, especially &quot;Perfect Blue&quot;. In an interview with Kon in 2001, he said that any scene in &quot;Requiem for a Dream&quot; that seems to be influenced by &quot;Perfect Blue&quot; is a homage to it, and that he still wants to make a live-action version of &quot;Perfect Blue&quot;. His 2010 film &quot;Black Swan&quot; was also pointed out by several critics for its similarity to &quot;Perfect Blue&quot;, but Aronofsky denied any direct influence.

Christopher Nolan&#x27;s 2010 film &quot;Inception&quot; was also noted by several critics and scholars to have many similarities with Kon&#x27;s &quot;Paprika&quot; (2006), including plot similarities, and similar scenes and characters.

<text>Monoplacophora , meaning &quot;bearing one plate&quot;, is a polyphyletic superclass of molluscs with a cap-like shell, inhabiting deep sea environments. Extant representatives were not recognized as such until 1952; previously they were known only from the fossil record, and were thought to have become extinct 375 million years ago.

Although the shell of many monoplacophorans is limpet-like in shape, they are not gastropods, nor do they have any close relation to gastropods.

== Definition ==
Discussion about monoplacophorans is made difficult by the slippery definition of the taxon; some authors take it to refer to all non-gastropod molluscs with a single shell, or all single-shelled molluscs with serially repeated units; whereas other workers restrict the definition to cap-shaped forms, excluding spiral and other shapes of shell. The inclusion of the gastropod-like Bellerophontoidea within the group is also contentious.

One attempt to resolve this confusion was to separate out the predominantly coiled helcionelloids from the traditional, cap-like tergomyans, this latter group containing extant Tryblidiids.

==Anatomy and physiology==

Monoplacophorans are univalved (though not gastropodal), limpet-shaped, and are untorted. They have a pseudometamerism of bilaterally symmetrical repeated organs and muscles. The extant members of the class live only in the deep ocean (the abyssal zone, the continental shelf, and the continental slope) at depths below . Cambrian forms predominately lived in shallow seas, whereas later Paleozoic forms are more commonly found in deeper waters with soft, muddy sea floors.

Although superficially resembling limpets when viewed dorsally, monoplacophorans are not anatomically similar to gastropods. Some similarities are shared with the chitons, such as having segmented anatomy (organs arranged in series). There are eight pairs of dorso-ventral muscles (shell muscles). The nervous system is relatively simple, with no true ganglion present.

The repeated organs include from three to six pairs of &quot;gills&quot; (actually ctenidia) located in a curved line along each side of the foot (though the number is not always considered definitive of a given species), and as many as six &quot;kidneys&quot; (actually nephridia). The tip or point of their low shells points forward rather than towards the back. The shell ranges from 3 mm to 37 mm in diameter depending on species. Like in chitons, the head is poorly defined, and there are no eyes. The mouth is located within the animal&#x27;s undeveloped head in front of its single large foot and contains a radula, a defining characteristic of the mollusca. Tentacles are situated behind the mouth. They also have a cone-shaped stomach with a single crystalline style though no gastric shield. The intestines are long and make between four and six loops before reaching the posteriorly-positioned anus. Monoplacophorans also have oesophageal pouches.

The sexes are separate with any given animal having two pairs of either ovaries or testes connected to either the third or fourth pair of kidneys. One genus, &quot;Micropilina&quot;, has apparently been recorded as brooding young in the distal oviduct and pallial groove, releasing the young when approximately 300 micrometers in diameter.

== Phylogenetic position ==
In 2006 a molecular study on &quot;Laevipilina antarctica&quot; suggested that extant Monoplacophora and Polyplacophora form a well-supported clade with the researched &quot;Neopilina&quot; closest to the chitons. The two classes in this new clade, with the proposed name Serialia, all show a variable number of serially repeated gills and eight sets of dorsoventral pedal retractor muscles.

This study contradicts the fossil evidence, which suggests that the Monoplacophora are the sister group to the remainder of the conchiferans, and that the cephalopods (squids, octopuses, and relatives) arose from within the monoplacophoran lineage. However, some authors dispute this view and do not necessarily see modern Monoplacophora as related to their presumed fossil ancestors.

The concept of Serialia is supported by other molecular studies.

The fossil record does indicate that the ancestral mollusc was monoplacophoran-like and that the Polyplacophora arose from within the Monoplacophora – not the other way around. This could be reconciled if a secondary loss of shells caused a monoplacophoran body form to re-appear secondarily, which is plausible: At the very least, modern monoplacophorans are not closely related to vent-dwelling representatives from the Silurian.

Cambrian monoplacophoran &quot;Knightoconus antarcticus&quot; is hypothesised to be an ancestor to the cephalopods.

== Fossil species ==

Living families:
* Tryblidiida
** Laevipilinidae
** Micropilinidae
** Monoplacophoridae
** Neopilinidae

Extinct families:
* Tryblidiida
** † Tryblidiidae 
* † Palaeacmaeidae (uncertain, as the Cambrian type species is a cnidarian. It is maintained here as a receptacle for the Paleozoic genus &quot;Parmophorella&quot;)
** † &quot;Palaeacmaea&quot; 
** † &quot;Parmophorella&quot; 
** † &quot;Knightoconus&quot;
*** † &quot;Knightoconus antarcticus&quot;
Many Cambrian-Devonian species have been described as &quot;monoplacophorans&quot;, but the only fossil members of the crown group date to the Pleistocene.

The Taxonomy of the Gastropoda (Bouchet &amp; Rocroi, 2005) also contains Paleozoic molluscs of uncertain systematic position. It is not known whether these were gastropods or monoplacophorans.

<text>&quot;Tench&quot;-class submarines were a type of submarine built for the United States Navy (USN) between 1944 and 1951. They were an improvement over the and es, only about 35 to 40 tons larger, but more strongly built and with a slightly improved internal layout. One of the ballast tanks was converted to carry fuel, increasing range from to . This improvement was also made on some boats of the previous two classes. Further improvements were made beginning with SS-435, which are sometimes referred to as the &quot;Corsair&quot; class. Initial plans called for 80 to be built, but 51 were cancelled in 1944 and 1945 when it became apparent that they would not be needed to defeat Japan. The remaining 29 were commissioned between October 1944 (&quot;Tench&quot;) and February 1951 (&quot;Grenadier&quot;). The last submarine of the &quot;Tench&quot; class, as well as the last submarine which served during World War II, remaining in service with the U.S. Navy was USS &quot;Tigrone&quot; (AGSS-419) which was decommissioned on 27 June 1975.

==Design==

The as-built diesel-electric propulsion layout was the same as the last few &quot;Balao&quot; class, with four Fairbanks-Morse or General Motors Cleveland Division two-stroke diesel engines supplying two low-speed double-armature direct-drive electric motors to drive two shafts. All except received the Fairbanks-Morse 38D 8-1/8 engine with 10 cylinders; &quot;Corsair&quot; had GM 16-278A engines. The direct-drive electric motors were much quieter than the reduction gear arrangement of previous classes, and they made the drive train much more reliable due to the fact that the gearing was an element prone to shock damage from depth charges. Two 126-cell -type lead-acid batteries provided submerged power to the electric motors.

A design weakness of earlier classes solved by the &quot;Tench&quot; re-design were the ballast tank vent riser pipes that passed through the interior of the boat in the forward and after torpedo rooms. These pipes allowed #1 and #7 Main Ballast Tanks (MBT) (located in the single hull sections of the boat) to vent air during diving, which allowed water to flood into them from below. The tops of these tanks formed the walking deck in the interior of both rooms and thus the normal location of the vent valves (the top of the tank) could not be used. The riser pipes allowed the tanks to vent, but when the tanks were full these pipes contained water at full submergence pressure &quot;inside&quot; the torpedo rooms. If these pipes ruptured during depth charge attack, catastrophic flooding would occur. Solving this problem initially proved quite difficult, but ultimately required the complete rearrangement of the ballast tanks. #1 MBT was moved to a location forward of the end of the pressure hull, thus allowing it to vent directly into the superstructure like the rest of the MBT&#x27;s. This move eliminated the riser pipes completely. #7 MBT, after stability and buoyancy calculations were run, was found to be redundant and was converted to a variable fuel oil/ballast tank, increasing the class&#x27;s surfaced range. These changes forced a rearrangement of the associated piping runs and locations of many of the other tanks. Being almost entirely internal, these changes resulted in a boat that was visually almost indistinguishable from the earlier &quot;Balao&quot; class, with the exception of a sharper angle (or knuckle) at the lower corner of the bow (only visible when the boat was drydocked). Another difference was the elimination of small bulges around the motor room that previously accommodated the reduction gears.

A significant benefit of the tank rearrangement was that these boats could carry four additional torpedoes in the forward torpedo room, for a total of 28. This was a change that had been asked for by submarine crews much earlier, but could not be accommodated in the earlier designs due to the lack of space in the torpedo rooms.

Many targets in the Pacific War were sampans or otherwise not worth a torpedo, so the deck gun was an important weapon. Due to war experience, most &quot;Tench&quot; class were armed with a /25 caliber gun, and some boats had two of these. Additional anti-aircraft guns included single 40mm Bofors and twin 20mm Oerlikon mounts, usually one of each.

=== Mine armament ===
Like the previous Tambor/Gar, Gato and Balao classes, the Tench class could substitute mines in place of torpedoes. For the Mk 10 and Mk 12 type mines used in World War II, each torpedo could be replaced by as many as two mines, giving the submarine a true maximum capacity of 56 mines. However, doctrine was to retain at least four torpedoes on mine laying missions, which further limits the capacity. The maximum is often stated as 40 mines in various publications because the authors simply used previous limitations of the Gato and Balao classes, and included the four torpedo doctrine. In practice, during the war, submarines went out with at least 8 torpedoes, and the largest minefields laid were 32 mines. Post-war, the Mk 49 mine replaced the Mk 12, while the larger Mk 27 mine was also carried which only allowed one mine replacing one torpedo. 

==Boats in class==
29 of these boats were built during and after World War II, commissioned from October 1944 through February 1951, with 11 commissioned postwar. None of this class were lost in World War II. &quot;Ghazi&quot; (ex-&quot;Diablo&quot; (SS-479)) was lost in Pakistani service on 4 December 1971 during the Indo-Pakistani Naval War of 1971, possibly due to a minelaying accident. Some of the class served actively in the US Navy through the middle 1970s, others served into the 1990s with foreign navies, and one (&quot;Hai Shih&quot; ex-USS Cutlass (SS-478)) is still active in Taiwan&#x27;s Republic of China Navy.

With one exception, these boats were all built at government owned shipyards; Portsmouth Naval Shipyard and Boston Navy Yard. Two boats, USS &quot;Wahoo&quot; (SS-516) and an unnamed boat designated SS-517 were laid down at Mare Island Navy Yard but canceled and broken up prior to completion. With the end of the war obviously near and due to a large construction backlog of &quot;Balao&quot;-class boats, the Electric Boat Company was only awarded contracts for three &quot;Tench&quot;-class boats, only one of which, , was completed. Electric Boat&#x27;s follow on yard, the Manitowoc Shipbuilding Company of Manitowoc, Wisconsin worked through its contracts for &quot;Balao&quot;s and was not awarded any &quot;Tench&quot; contracts. The Cramp Shipbuilding Company of Philadelphia, struggling with workforce problems and supply issues with its &quot;Balao&quot;s, was also not awarded any contracts.

===Cancellations===

A total of 125 U.S. submarines were cancelled during World War II, all but three between 29 July 1944 and 12 August 1945. The exceptions were USS &quot;Wahoo&quot; (SS-516), , and , cancelled 7 January 1946. References vary considerably as to how many of these were &quot;Balao&quot;s and how many were &quot;Tench&quot;es. Some references simply assume all submarines numbered after SS-416 were &quot;Tench&quot; class; however, and were completed as &quot;Balao&quot;s. This yields 10 cancelled &quot;Balao&quot;s, SS-353-360 and 379–380. The &quot;Register of Ships of the U. S. Navy&quot; differs, considering every submarine not specifically ordered as a &quot;Tench&quot; to be a &quot;Balao&quot;, and further projecting SS-551-562 as a future class. This yields 62 cancelled &quot;Balao&quot;- , 51 cancelled &quot;Tench&quot;-, and 12 cancelled &quot;SS-551&quot;-class boats. Two of the cancelled &quot;Tench&quot;-class boats, &quot;Unicorn&quot;, and &quot;Walrus&quot;, were launched incomplete, never commissioned, but listed with the reserve fleet until struck in 1958 and scrapped in 1959. The cancelled hull numbers, including those launched incomplete, were SS-353-360 (&quot;Balao&quot;), 379–380 (&quot;Balao&quot;), 427–434 (&quot;Balao&quot;), 436–437 (&quot;Tench&quot;), 438–474 (&quot;Balao&quot;), 491–521 (&quot;Tench&quot;), 526-529 (&quot;Tench&quot;), 530–536 (&quot;Balao&quot;), 537-550 (&quot;Tench&quot;), and 551-562 (future).

==Service==

Ten of the 29 &quot;Tench&quot;-class submarines were completed in time to conduct war patrols in World War II, entering service beginning in late 1944. They finished what the previous classes had largely accomplished: the near-total destruction of the Japanese merchant fleet. Another significant contribution was the rescue of downed aviators near Okinawa and Japan. Two additional boats (&quot;Cutlass&quot; and &quot;Diablo&quot;) entered Japanese waters on their first war patrols immediately after the 13 August 1945 cease-fire. Construction on the last four of the class was suspended, and they were completed 1948–1951.

Postwar, 24 of the 29 &quot;Tench&quot;es were modernized under the Fleet Snorkel and Greater Underwater Propulsion Power (GUPPY) programs, with most continuing in US service into the early 1970s. Fourteen were transferred to foreign navies for years of additional service, and the former remained active in Taiwan&#x27;s Republic of China Navy as &quot;Hai Shih&quot; as of July 2021, the last of the class in service with any navy.

===Naval Reserve trainer===

Interested in maintaining a ready pool of trained reservists, the Navy assigned at least 58 submarines from 1946 to 1971 to various coastal and inland ports (even in Great Lakes ports such as Cleveland, Detroit, and Chicago), where they served as training platforms during the Reservists&#x27; weekend drills. At least three &quot;Tench&quot;-class boats served in this capacity. In this role, the boats were rendered incapable of diving and had their propellers removed. They were used strictly as pierside trainers. These were in commission but classed as &quot;in commission in reserve&quot;, thus some were decommissioned and recommissioned on the same day to reflect the change in status.

===Foreign service===
The large numbers of relatively modern, but surplus U.S. fleet submarines proved to be popular in sales, loans, or leases to allied foreign navies. Fourteen &quot;Tench&quot;-class submarines were transferred to foreign navies, most after serving over 25 years in the US Navy. These included 2 to Turkey, 1 to Greece, 2 to Italy, 1 to Pakistan, 1 to Canada, 4 to Brazil, 1 to Venezuela, 1 to Peru, and 1 to Taiwan. The &quot;Tench&quot;-class submarine ex- was transferred along with the &quot;Balao&quot;-class ex- to the Republic of China Navy as &quot;Hai Shih&quot; and &quot;Hai Pao&quot; in 1973; as of 2015 they remained in commission as the last US-built World War II-era submarines in service. was sold to the Royal Canadian Navy in 1968, renamed , decommissioned in 1974, and returned to the US for scrapping in 1977. was leased to the Pakistan Navy in 1963 and then as PNS &quot;Ghazi&quot; participated in two further wars, finally sinking during a minelaying mission in the Bay of Bengal with the loss of all 92 hands, on 4 December 1971 during the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971. &quot;Diablo&quot; was thus the last &quot;Tench&quot;-class submarine to see action.

As of 2020 the Taiwanese Hai Shih-class had largest weapons load of any conventional submarines in the world.

==GUPPY and other conversions==

At the end of World War II, the US submarine force found itself in an awkward position. The 29 &quot;Tench&quot;-class submarines, designed to fight an enemy that no longer existed, were obsolescent despite the fact they were only one to three years old. The German Type XXI U-boat, with a large battery capacity, streamlining to maximize underwater speed, and a snorkel, was the submarine of the immediate future. The Greater Underwater Propulsion Power Program (GUPPY) conversion program was developed to give some &quot;Balao&quot;- and &quot;Tench&quot;-class submarines similar capabilities to the Type XXI. When the cost of upgrading numerous submarines to GUPPY standard became apparent, the austere &quot;Fleet Snorkel&quot; conversion was developed to add snorkels and partial streamlining to some boats. A total of 16 &quot;Tench&quot;-class submarines were converted to one of the GUPPY configurations, with 8 additional boats receiving Fleet Snorkel modifications. &quot;Diablo&quot;, one of the Fleet Snorkel boats, was converted immediately prior to transfer to Pakistan. Most of the converted submarines were active into the early 1970s, when many were transferred to foreign navies for further service and others were decommissioned and disposed of.

Although there was some variation in the GUPPY conversion programs, generally the original two &quot;Sargo&quot; batteries were replaced by four more compact Guppy (GUPPY I and II only) or Sargo II batteries via significant re-utilization of below-deck space, usually including removal of auxiliary diesels. All of these battery designs were of the lead-acid type. This increased the total number of battery cells from 252 to 504; the downside was the compact batteries had to be replaced every 18 months instead of every 5 years. The Sargo II battery was developed as a lower-cost alternative to the expensive Guppy battery. All GUPPYs received a snorkel, with a streamlined sail and bow. Also, the electric motors were upgraded to the direct drive double-armature type, along with modernized electrical and air conditioning systems. All &quot;Tench&quot;-class GUPPYs received sonar, fire control, and Electronic Support Measures (ESM) upgrades.
The Fleet Snorkel program was much more austere than the GUPPY modernizations, but is included here as it occurred during the GUPPY era. The GUPPY and Fleet Snorkel programs are listed in chronological order: GUPPY I, GUPPY II, GUPPY IA, Fleet Snorkel, GUPPY IIA, GUPPY IB, and GUPPY III.

===GUPPY I===
Two &quot;Tench&quot;-class boats, and , were converted as prototypes for the GUPPY program in 1947. They proved very successful, though not initially fitted with snorkels. &quot;Pomodon&quot; achieved while Odax made 18.2 Knots submerged on trials, though even the increased battery capacity only allowed one hour of operation at that speed. However, banking and depth control problems resulting from the high speed were noted and eventually compensated for. An advantage of streamlining was that active sonar detection range against a GUPPY was reduced by about 10%, and the higher submerged speed also severely impacted anti-submarine warfare efforts.

===GUPPY II===

This was the first production GUPPY conversion, with most conversions occurring in 1947–49. Eleven &quot;Tench&quot;-class boats received GUPPY II upgrades (, , , , &quot;Odax&quot;, , &quot;Pomodon&quot;, , , , and ), including the two GUPPY I prototypes in 1951. This was the only production conversion with Guppy batteries.

===GUPPY IA===
This was developed as a more cost-effective alternative to GUPPY II. &quot;Tench&quot; was converted in 1951. The less expensive Sargo II battery was introduced, along with other cost-saving measures.

===Fleet Snorkel===

The Fleet Snorkel program was developed as an austere, cost-effective alternative to full GUPPY conversions, with significantly less improvement in submerged performance. Eight &quot;Tench&quot;-class boats received this upgrade (, - immediately prior to foreign transfer to Pakistan as &quot;Ghazi&quot;, , , , , , and ). Most Fleet Snorkel conversions occurred 1951–52. Notably, the original pair of Sargo batteries was not upgraded. Each boat received a streamlined sail with a snorkel, along with upgraded sonar, air conditioning, and ESM. A few boats initially retained a 5-inch/25 caliber deck gun, but this was removed in the 1950s.

===GUPPY IIA===

This was generally similar to GUPPY IA, except one of the forward diesel engines was removed to relieve machinery overcrowding. Four &quot;Tench&quot;-class boats (, , , and ) received GUPPY IIA upgrades in 1952–54.

===GUPPY IB===

This was developed as an austere upgrade for two &quot;Gato&quot;-class and two &quot;Balao&quot;-class boats prior to transfer to foreign navies ( 2 each to Italy and The Netherlands ) in 1953–55. They lacked the sonar and electronics upgrades of other GUPPY conversions. No &quot;Tench&quot;-class boats were converted under this upgrade.

===GUPPY III===
Nine submarines, three of them belonging to the &quot;Tench&quot; class (&quot;Pickerel&quot;, &quot;Remora&quot;, and &quot;Volador&quot;), were upgraded from GUPPY II to GUPPY III in 1959–63 as part of the Fleet Rehabilitation and Modernization II (FRAM II) program. The three &quot;Tenches&quot; were lengthened by in the forward part of the control room to provide a new sonar space, berthing, electronics space, and storerooms. A taller &quot;Northern&quot; sail was included for improved surfaced operations in rough seas; this was also backfitted to some other GUPPY and Fleet Snorkel boats. The BQG-4 Passive Underwater Fire Control Feasibility Study (PUFFS) sonar system, with three tall &quot;Shark fin&quot; domes topside, was fitted. Additionally, fire control upgrades allowed the Mark 45 nuclear torpedo to be used.

===Radar picket===

The advent of the &quot;kamikaze&quot; demonstrated the need for a long range radar umbrella around the fleet. Radar picket destroyers and destroyer escorts were put into service, but they proved vulnerable in this role as they could be attacked as well, leaving the fleet blind. A submarine, though, could dive and escape aerial attack. Four submarines including the &quot;Tench&quot;-class boat &quot;Remora&quot; prototyped the concept at the end of World War II but were not used in this role. Ten fleet submarines were later converted for this role in 1946–53 and redesignated SSR as radar picket submarines. Three &quot;Tench&quot;-class boats (&quot;Requin&quot;, &quot;Spinax&quot;, and &quot;Tigrone&quot;) were among those converted, the first two in 1946 under Project Migraine I. &quot;Tigrone&quot; would be converted under Migraine II (aka project SCB 12) in 1948, and the other two would be upgraded to this standard with powerful air search and height finding radars installed on masts, and with the after torpedo room converted into an electronics space with torpedoes and tubes removed.

The SSRs proved only moderately successful, as the radars themselves proved troublesome and somewhat unreliable, and the boats&#x27; surface speed was insufficient to protect a fast-moving carrier group. The radars were removed and the boats reverted to general purpose submarines after 1959.

===Sonar test submarines===

 was fitted with Bottom Reflection Active Sonar System II (BRASS II) sonar equipment in 1961 and was redesignated as an auxiliary submarine (AGSS) in 1962. BRASS II led to the sonar sphere used on the &quot;Thresher&quot; class and all subsequent US attack submarines.

&quot;Tigrone&quot;, formerly a radar picket submarine, was redesignated as an AGSS and converted to a sonar test submarine in 1963–64. She was given a unique configuration to test developmental sonar for the Naval Underwater Sound Laboratory. This included the removal of all torpedoes and tubes to allow room for sonar-related electronics. A large upper bow sonar dome and a forward extension of the sail were included, with a side-facing square sonar rack eventually added aft of the sail. The bow and sail domes were for BRASS III equipment.

==Follow-on studies==

In late 1944, the Bureau of Ships consulted with a group of submarine officers chaired by COMSUBPAC Admiral Charles A. Lockwood on specifications for a future submarine. Several designs were considered. The submarine officers wanted a deeper test depth, more torpedo tubes, and a higher speed, but got only part of what they wanted. The final design merged ambition with realism. Known as Design B, it was developed by May 1945. It was to be long, surfaced displacement ( submerged), with larger engines (12-cylinder Fairbanks-Morse with two-stage supercharging) for a speed of surfaced. Armament was to be twelve  torpedo tubes (six forward, six aft), with six short external torpedo tubes in the superstructure for the swim-out Mark 27 acoustic homing anti-escort torpedo. The external tubes would be arranged with three each firing to port and starboard. Test depth would be increased to . The wind-down of submarine production in 1945 brought an end to this project. Had SS-551 through SS-562 not been cancelled, it is possible they would have been built to the new design.

<text>was a Japanese film director. His main interest as a filmmaker lay in the depiction of the lower strata of Japanese society. A key figure in the Japanese New Wave, who continued working into the 21st century, Imamura is the only director from Japan to win two Palme d&#x27;Or awards.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Imamura was born to an upper-middle-class doctor&#x27;s family in Tokyo in 1926. For a short time following the end of the war, Imamura participated in the black market selling cigarettes and liquor. He studied Western history at Waseda University, but spent more time participating in theatrical and political activities. He cited a viewing of Akira Kurosawa&#x27;s &quot;Rashomon&quot; in 1950 as an early inspiration, and said he saw it as an indication of the new freedom of expression possible in Japan in the post-war era.

Upon graduation from Waseda in 1951, Imamura began his film career working as an assistant to Yasujirō Ozu at Shochiku Studios on films like &quot;Early Summer&quot; and &quot;Tokyo Story&quot;. Imamura was uncomfortable with the image of Japanese society portrayed in Ozu&#x27;s films, as well as with his rigid directing of actors, although he later admitted that he profited from his apprenticeship for Ozu in terms of gaining technical knowledge. While Imamura&#x27;s films were to have a quite different style from Ozu&#x27;s, Imamura, like Ozu, was to focus on what he saw as particularly Japanese elements of society in his films. &quot;I&#x27;ve always wanted to ask questions about the Japanese, because it&#x27;s the only people I&#x27;m qualified to describe,&quot; he said. He expressed surprise that his films were appreciated overseas, even doubting that they could be understood.

===Studio director===
Imamura left Shochiku in 1954 to join the Nikkatsu studios, where he worked as an assistant director to Yūzō Kawashima. According to Donald Richie, Imamura shared with Kawashima an interest in depicting the &quot;real&quot; Japan with its &quot;uncivilized&quot;, amoral protagonists, in opposition to the &quot;official&quot; version as depicted in the films of Ozu, Mizoguchi Kenji, and late career Kurosawa. He also co-wrote the screenplay to Kawashima&#x27;s &quot;Sun in the Last Days of the Shogunate&quot;, and much later edited a book about Kawashima, entitled &quot;Sayonara dake ga jinsei da&quot;.

In 1958, Imamura made his directorial debut at Nikkatsu, &quot;Stolen Desire&quot;, about a travelling theater troupe which combines kabuki with striptease, a film which, according to Jonathan Rosenbaum, &quot;characteristically finds some vitality in vulgarity&quot;. He continued to direct films the studio had assigned him to, including &quot;Nishi Ginza Station&quot;, a comedy based on a Frankie Nagai pop song, and the black comedy &quot;Endless Desire&quot;. &quot;My Second Brother&quot;, which portrayed a community of zainichi in a poor mining town, was described by Alexander Jacoby as an &quot;uncharacteristically tender film&quot;.

His 1961 satire &quot;Pigs and Battleships&quot;, of which Imamura later said that it was the kind of film he always had wanted to make, depicted black market trades between the U.S. military and the local underworld at Yokosuka. Due to the film&#x27;s controversial nature and Imamura&#x27;s overrunning production time and costs, Nikkatsu did not allow Imamura to direct another project for two years, forcing him to concentrate on screenwriting. He followed this hiatus with the 1963 &quot;The Insect Woman&quot;, which was shown in competition at the Berlin International Film Festival, and the 1964 &quot;Unholy Desire&quot;. All three films presented female protagonists who were survivors, persevering despite misfortunes. Imamura disliked the self-sacrificing women portrayed in films like Mizoguchi&#x27;s &quot;The Life of Oharu&quot; and Mikio Naruse&#x27;s &quot;Floating Clouds&quot;, arguing that &quot;they don&#x27;t really exist...My heroines are true to life&quot;.

===Independent filmmaker===
In 1965, Imamura established his own production company, Imamura Productions. His first independent feature was a free adaptation of a novel by Akiyuki Nosaka, &quot;The Pornographers&quot; (1966), which is nowadays regarded as one of his best-known films in the West. In 1967, he followed with the pseudo-documentary &quot;A Man Vanishes&quot;, which, while following a woman searching for her missing fiancé, increasingly blurred the line between non-fiction and fiction. His 1968 film &quot;Profound Desires of the Gods&quot; investigated the clash between modern and traditional societies on a southern Japanese island. One of Imamura&#x27;s more ambitious and costly projects, this film&#x27;s poor box-office performance led to a retreat back into smaller productions, causing him to direct a series of documentaries over the next decade, often for Japanese television.

&quot;History of Postwar Japan as Told by a Bar Hostess&quot; and &quot;Karayuki-san, the Making of a Prostitute&quot; were two of these projects, both focusing on one of his favorite themes: Strong women who survive on the periphery of Japanese society. Two others followed Japanese ex-soldiers in Malaysia and Thailand reluctant to returning home, and speaking openly about their past war crimes on camera.

Imamura returned to fiction with the 1979 &quot;Vengeance Is Mine&quot;, based on the true story of serial killer Akira Nishiguchi. Two large-scale remakes followed, &quot;Eijanaika&quot; (1981), a re-imagining of &quot;Sun in the Last Days of the Shogunate&quot;, and &quot;The Ballad of Narayama&quot; (1983), a re-telling of Keisuke Kinoshita&#x27;s 1958 &quot;The Ballad of Narayama&quot;. For the latter, Imamura received his first Palme d&#x27;Or at the 1983 Cannes Film Festival. 

&quot;Black Rain&quot; (1989) portrayed the effect of the bombing of Hiroshima on a family years after the incident. Film scholar Alexander Jacoby discovered an uncommon, &quot;almost Ozu-like quietism&quot; in this film. &quot;The Eel&quot; (1997) again secured Imamura a Palme d&#x27;Or, this time shared with Abbas Kiarostami&#x27;s &quot;Taste of Cherry&quot;.

Starting with &quot;The Eel&quot;, Imamura&#x27;s eldest son Daisuke Tengan worked on the screenplays of his films, including Imamura&#x27;s contribution to the anthology film &quot;11&#x27;09&quot;01 September 11&quot; (2002), his last directorial effort. In 2002, Imamura played the role of a historian in the South Korean film &quot;2009: Lost Memories&quot;.

Imamura died on 30 May 2006, aged 79.

==Themes==
Seeing himself as a cultural anthropologist, Imamura stated, &quot;I like to make messy films&quot;, and &quot;I am interested in the relationship of the lower part of the human body and the lower part of the social structure... I ask myself what differentiates humans from other animals. What is a human being? I look for the answer by continuing to make films&quot;.

==Legacy==
Imamura founded the Japan Institute of the Moving Image () as the Yokohama Vocational School of Broadcast and Film (Yokohama Hōsō Eiga Senmon Gakkō) in 1975. While a student at this school, director Takashi Miike was given his first film credit as assistant director on Imamura&#x27;s 1987 film &quot;Zegen&quot;.

<doc id="458182" wikidata="Q1507838" url="?curid=458182" title="Minstrel in the Gallery">
<text>Minstrel in the Gallery is the eighth studio album by British rock band Jethro Tull, released in September 1975. The album sees the band going in a different direction from their previous work &quot;War Child&quot; (1974), returning to a blend of electric and acoustic songs, in a manner closer to their early 1970s albums such as &quot;Benefit&quot; (1970), &quot;Aqualung&quot; (1971) and &quot;Thick as a Brick&quot; (1972). Making use of a newly constructed mobile recording studio commissioned and constructed specifically for the band, the album was the first Jethro Tull album to be recorded outside of the UK, being recorded in tax exile in Monte Carlo, Monaco.

It was the last Jethro Tull album to feature bassist Jeffrey Hammond, who left the band upon completion of the album&#x27;s touring in late 1975 and was replaced by former Carmen bass player John Glascock.

==Background==
In late 1974, upon completion of touring for the band&#x27;s seventh album &quot;War Child&quot;, the band returned to the idea of recording outside of the UK with frontman Ian Anderson commissioning the creation of a mobile studio to allow the band to record anywhere they wished. The mobile studio, constructed by engineer Robin Black and Morgan Studios engineer Pete Smith, was christened the Maison Rouge Mobile Studio and was transported in April 1975 to Monte Carlo, Monaco, where the band would record the album in the Prince of Wales Hotel. Anderson rented a home in Los Angeles in December 1974 to finish writing of the album, where he was joined by orchestral arranger (and future Jethro Tull keyboardist) Dee Palmer to assist in finalizing string arrangements for the album.

==Recording==
Recording began on 15 May 1975, recording &quot;Minstrel in the Gallery&quot;, &quot;Cold Wind to Valhalla&quot;, &quot;Black Satin Dancer&quot; and &quot;One White Duck&quot; and ended on 7 June 1975, finishing &quot;Requiem&quot;. The majority of the album was recorded live by the whole band, with overdubs being added later. Many of the song&#x27;s backing tracks were completed in a single take. The band made use of novel technical recording developments on the album, such as the Eventide 1745 digital delay processor to create the illusion of double tracked instruments on various tracks. The band originally hired a local Monte Carlo orchestra to record the string material on the album; however, the orchestra&#x27;s unfamiliarity in working with a rock band made the recording difficult, and as a result a British string quartet which the band had previously worked with on the War Child Tour were used instead.

Anderson believed that the band were undergoing a tense period during the recording of the album and were not getting along well, a recollection that other band members have disagreed with. In particular, Anderson felt that the rest of the band was distracted by the seaside resort setting of Monaco: &quot;I was full of industry and activity, writing songs and working very hard. I think the others felt as though it was a holiday as well as a recording session.&quot; Challenging Anderson&#x27;s recollection, guitarist Martin Barre stated that &quot;However we behaved, we were in a very alien situation, so you can&#x27;t just think &#x27;we&#x27;re here to work, nothing else.&#x27; But the band got on great, and I don&#x27;t recall any great frictions at all. It&#x27;s just that Ian took it all very, very seriously.&quot; Drummer Barriemore Barlow agreed, describing the time in Monaco as &quot;happy days&quot;. Anderson found himself unhappy in Monaco, with his ire drawn mostly from the residents: &quot;It made me sick getting up in the morning and watching all these people lying on the beach with their amazing vanity. Most of them are really ugly people, physically grotesque; the women are unattractive and the men are obscene. And they do nothing. I get very aggressive in that sort of situation because I&#x27;ve got a lot of things to do.&quot;

==Musical styles and themes==
The album&#x27;s title refers to the use of a minstrel&#x27;s gallery in the great hall of castles or manor houses, inspired by a balcony in the recording space which is shown in a photo of the band on the back cover of the original LP. The minstrel analogy is used thematically in the lyrics of the title track and &quot;Baker St. Muse&quot;. &quot;Cold Wind to Valhalla&quot; is based on elements of Norse mythology, such as the afterlife hall of Valhalla mentioned in the song&#x27;s title and lyrics. The cover art of the album is an alteration of the 1838 oil painting &quot;Twelfth Night Revels in the Great Hall, Haddon Hall, Derbyshire&quot; by artist Joseph Nash, depicting a group of minstrels (altered from the original painting to represent the five members of the band) performing to a raucous crowd of revelers at the Haddon Hall country estate.

Critics have described &quot;Minstrel in the Gallery&#x27;s&quot; lyrics and subject matter as showing an introspective and cynical air, possibly the byproduct of Anderson&#x27;s recent divorce from first wife Jennie Franks. However, Anderson has denied the divorce as inspiration for the album, saying that the album&#x27;s subject matter is &quot;like everything else, you mix a bit of personal stuff with a bit of fantasy.&quot;

Stylistically the album is varied, exemplary of Jethro Tull&#x27;s progressive-influenced hard rock performances, with long instrumental passages, invested with elements of British folk and archaic, pre-Elizabethan sounds. Team Rock called &quot;Minstrel in the Gallery&quot;&#x27;s musical style a &quot;heavy metal take on the obsessively ornamented style of &quot;A Passion Play&quot;&quot;.

==Releases==
&quot;Minstrel in the Gallery&quot; was remastered with five additional bonus tracks in November 2002, including incomplete live-in-the-studio renditions of &quot;Minstrel in the Gallery&quot; and &quot;Cold Wind to Valhalla&quot;, some tracks that appeared only on maxi-singles (&quot;Pan Dance&quot;, &quot;March the Mad Scientist&quot;) and &quot;Summerday Sands&quot; which was the B-side of the &quot;Minstrel in the Gallery&quot; single.

In 2015, commemorating the 40th anniversary of &quot;Minstrel in the Gallery&quot;, it was released as a box set with two CDs and two DVDs, named &quot;La Grande Edition&quot;. The box contains rare and previously unreleased tracks (such as alternate takes from &quot;Requiem&quot;, &quot;Grace&quot; and &quot;One White Duck&quot;) including new stereo mixes by Steven Wilson and a live presentation, from 1975 in Palais des Sports, remixed by Jakko Jakszyk. Also, an 80-page booklet featuring track-by-track annotations by Ian Anderson, a history of the group and recollections of life on tour by road crew member Kenny Wylie, maintenance engineer Pete Smith and string section musician Liz Edwards. Heavyweight vinyl and standard CD editions of the album were also announced.

==Critical reception==
&quot;Rolling Stone&quot; gave a negative review to &quot;Minstrel in the Gallery&quot;, stating that &quot;The fact that Ian Anderson and the lads have once again plundered the British secular music tradition signifies little and delivers less.&quot; The review recalled the music in terms as &quot;a wash of lugubrious string passages&quot;, the &quot;anachronisms of Jeffrey Hammond-Hammond&#x27;s mechanical bass lines&quot; and &quot;Martin Barre&#x27;s hysterical electric guitar montages&quot;. They considered the lyrics &quot;contrary to the LP&#x27;s basic concept [...] instantly forgettable&quot;.

&quot;AllMusic&quot; ran a favourable retrospective review, stating that the album is the &quot;most artistically successful and elaborately produced album since &quot;Thick as a Brick&quot;&quot;. Analysing the music, it said: &quot;Martin Barre&#x27;s attack on the guitar is as ferocious as anything in the band&#x27;s history, and John Evan&#x27;s organ matches him amp for amp, while Barriemore Barlow and Jeffrey Hammond-Hammond hold things together in a furious performance. Anderson&#x27;s flair for drama and melody come to the fore in &quot;Cold Wind to Valhalla,&quot; and &quot;Requiem&quot; is perhaps the loveliest acoustic number in Tull&#x27;s repertoire, featuring nothing but Anderson&#x27;s singing and acoustic guitar, Hammond-Hammond&#x27;s bass, and a small string orchestra backing them&quot;. Paul Stump&#x27;s &quot;History of Progressive Rock&quot; called the album &quot;a searching and accomplished effort. Diffuseness was now distilled into a sprightly, idiosyncratic collection of powerful numbers.&quot; He suggested that Jethro Tull&#x27;s usage of additive rhythms on this album &quot;proceeds to a level unmatched elsewhere in rock.&quot; He also found the music had greater emotional intensity and approved of the use of folksy acoustic guitar throughout.

&quot;Cash Box&quot; said of the title track that it &quot;is a deft return to the density and meaty substance that characterized earlier works&quot; and that &quot;lots of heavy riffing effectively compliments Anderson’s vocal posturing while his unobtrusive flute runs stab at the periphery.&quot;

<text>Locomotor [[ataxia]] is the inability to precisely control one&#x27;s own bodily movements.
==Disease==
People afflicted with this disease may walk in a jerky, non-fluid manner. They will not know where their arms and legs are without looking (i.e., a failure of proprioception), but can, for instance, feel and locate a hot object placed against their feet. It is often a symptom of tabes dorsalis, which is a key finding in tertiary syphilis.

It is caused by degeneration of the posterior (dorsal) white column of the spinal cord.

==In popular culture==

The chilling effects of this condition and its connection to venereal disease are dramatized in the story &quot;Love O&#x27; Women&quot; by Rudyard Kipling.

Bram Stoker&#x27;s death certificate named the cause of death as &quot;Locomotor Ataxia 6 months&quot;, presumed to be a reference to syphilis.

<doc id="458196" wikidata="Q16821953" url="?curid=458196" title="Associate Minister of National Defence">
<text>The associate minister of national defence () is a member of the Canadian cabinet who is responsible for various files within the defence department as assigned by the prime minister or defence minister.

The position was created in 1940 during World War II under the &quot;War Measures Act&quot; along with the creation of a minister of defence for air and a minister of defence for naval services. These positions lapsed with the end of the war. The position of associate minister of defence was recreated in 1953 when the &quot;National Defence Act&quot; was amended to provide for the appointment in peacetime.

This post remained vacant under Prime Ministers Pierre Trudeau, Joe Clark and John Turner. Brian Mulroney revived the position but it was abolished under Kim Campbell when she decreased the size of the cabinet from 35 to 24 ministers. The post was also not used under Jean Chrétien.

This position reappeared on December 12, 2003, when Paul Martin chose his first cabinet and named Albina Guarnieri as the associate minister of national defence and minister of state for civil preparedness, and the portfolio passed to Mauril Bélanger in a subsequent reshuffle. Stephen Harper did not name anyone to the position until his May 18, 2011 reshuffle, when Julian Fantino was appointed to the portfolio. The position was left vacant by Harper in the July 15, 2013 cabinet shuffle.

Since forming government in 2015, Justin Trudeau has appointed the minister of veterans affairs as associate minister of national defence.

==List of associate ministers of national defence==
Cadieux and Hellyer were later appointed as minister of national defence.

<doc id="458198" wikidata="Q267531" url="?curid=458198" title="Desert Mounted Corps">
<text>The Desert Mounted Corps was an army corps of the British Army during the First World War, of three mounted divisions renamed in August 1917 by General Edmund Allenby, from Desert Column. These divisions which served in the Sinai and Palestine Campaign had been formed by Australian light horse, British yeomanry, and New Zealand mounted rifles brigades, supported by horse artillery, infantry and support troops. They were later joined by Indian cavalry and a small French cavalry detachment.

The Desert Mounted Corps (DMC) comprised the ANZAC Mounted Division, the Australian Mounted Division and the Yeomanry Mounted Division, with infantry formations attached when required, as had Desert Column. In the first month of its existence, the corps continued training and patrolling no man&#x27;s land preparing for manoeuvre warfare. Their first operations would be the attack, along with the XX Corps of the Battle of Beersheba. Having captured their objective they were involved in a series of battles, before the old Gaza to Beersheba line was finally broken a week later. During the pursuit they fought two Turkish armies at the Battle of Mughar Ridge before advancing to capture Jerusalem during the Battle of Jerusalem in December 1917.

In 1918, units of Desert Mounted Corps participated in the Capture of Jericho in February, the First Transjordan attack on Amman in March and the Second Transjordan attack on Shunet Nimrin and Es Salt in April, while occupying the Jordan Valley during the summer. As a result of the German spring offensive on the Western Front the corps went through a reorganisation, when the majority of the British yeomanry regiments were dismounted and sent as infantry reinforcements to France. The Yeomanry Mounted Division and the 5th Mounted Brigade were disbanded, to be replaced by Indian cavalry regiments, which formed the 4th Cavalry Division and 5th Cavalry Division. They arrived in the Jordan Valley in May to join the corps and in September with four divisions, participated in the major offensive operations of the Battle of Sharon, a section of the Battle of Megiddo. The subsequent pursuit to Damascus followed by the Pursuit to Haritan, advances of almost into Turkish territory, resulted in the capture of 107,000 prisoners and over 500 pieces of artillery. At the end of October, the Armistice of Mudros ended the war against the Ottoman Empire and the corps became an occupation force in Syria. By March 1919 units were patrolling Egypt during the Egyptian Revolution of 1919. The Desert Mounted Corps was disbanded in June 1919.

==Background==

The main responsibility of the British Empire forces in Egypt was the defence of the Suez Canal. Its passage greatly decreased the time at sea of men and materials from India, Australasia and the Far-East. The loss of the canal to the Ottoman Empire would be a huge propaganda coup for their opponents and increase the probability that Egypt would be reconquered by them.

After previously commanding the Cavalry Corps and the Third Army on the Western Front in France. General Edmund Allenby assumed command of the Egyptian Expeditionary Force on 28 June 1917. At the time the situation in the Middle Eastern theatre of World War I was not promising. The British forces had withdrawn in defeat from Gallipoli and in the campaign in Mesopotamia had been surrounded and forced to surrender after the siege of Kut. In the Sinai campaign, the Turks had demonstrated their willingness to take the battle to the British, with their attack on the Suez Canal. Then after some initial British success at Romani, Maghaba and Rafa, they had just suffered two comprehensive defeats in the first and second battle of Gaza. Following which they had remained on the defensive.

Allenby&#x27;s envisaged the employment of his mounted forces on a much larger scale than his predecessor had. So under the command of Lieutenant-General Harry Chauvel the Desert Mounted Corps was formed on 12 August 1917. It had been intended to use the name II Cavalry Corps, but the name was chosen in recognition of its predecessor the Desert Column. Chauvel outlined the reasons on 3 September 1920: &quot;The name of the original Desert Column was preserved as far as possible in the title of the new Cavalry Corps, as most of the troops composing it had fought throughout the Sinai Campaign, and by them much had already been accomplished.&quot; The corps initially had three divisions, the Australian and New Zealand Mounted Division (ANZ MTD DIV) with the 1st Light Horse, 2nd Light Horse and the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigades. The Australian Mounted Division (AUS MTD DIV) with the 3rd Light Horse, 4th Light Horse and the 5th Mounted Brigade. Finally the Yeomanry Mounted Division (YEO MTD DIV) with the 6th Mounted, 8th Mounted and the 22nd Mounted Brigades. Two other brigades the 7th Mounted and the Imperial Camel Corps were the corps reserve. However the dismounted strength of these brigades, of three regiments, was only the equivalent in rifle fire to an infantry battalion, as one men in every four was required to control their horses. Other components in the brigade were a horse artillery battery, a machine gun squadron, a signal troop, a field troop, a mobile veterinary section, a mounted field ambulance and an ammunition column.

===Reorganisation===
In April 1918 in response to the German spring offensive in France, every available man that could be spared was sent to reinforce the British Expeditionary Force on the Western Front. The Desert Mounted Corps lost the majority of its yeomanry regiments, who were dismounted and retrained to serve as infantry or machine-gun companies. This necessitated the disbandment of the Yeomanry Mounted Division. Which could have had serious consequences on the corps future operations. But the yeomanry were replaced in theatre by experienced British Indian Army cavalry regiments, that had been fighting in France since 1914. Allenby used these new regiments to raise two new divisions. The 4th Cavalry Division with the 10th Cavalry, 11th Cavalry and 12th Cavalry Brigades. The 5th Cavalry Division was slightly different having the 13th Cavalry, 14th Cavalry and the 15th (Imperial Service) Cavalry Brigades.
Each of the cavalry brigades had one yeomanry and two Indian regiments, except the 15th (Imperial Service) Cavalry Brigade which had three regiments of Indian Imperial Service Troops. With the move from the Sinai desert into southern Palestine there was now no need for a camel force. In June the Imperial Service Camel Brigade was also disbanded, its battalions were instead mounted on horses and used to form the 5th Light Horse Brigade. Which replaced the yeomanry 5th Mounted Brigade in the Australian Mounted Division, bringing that division back up to full strength. The corps now comprised four divisions but had lost its mounted reserve force, and there was no increase in the ten horse artillery batteries, it did however gain its own infantry sub unit, the 20th Indian Brigade.

===Formation===
Between General Murray&#x27;s recall in early June, and the arrival of Allenby late in June 1917, Chetwode as commander of Eastern Force gave Chauvel as commander of Desert Column, oversight for the establishment of the Yeomanry Mounted Division.

On 21 June, the Imperial Mounted Division became the Australian Mounted Division. On 26 June the 6th Mounted Brigade was transferred from the Australian Mounted Division, and the 22nd Mounted Brigade from the ANZAC Mounted Division, and along with the recently arrived 8th Mounted Brigade, formed the Yeomanry Mounted Division. The 7th Mounted Brigade with the Imperial Camel Corps Brigade were corps troops.

Desert Column was reorganised from two mounted divisions of four brigades, into three mounted divisions of three brigades: The ANZAC Mounted Division, Australian Mounted Division and the Yeomanry Mounted Division.

Allenby indicated to Robertson on 12 July, that he planned to reorganise the EEF into two infantry and a mounted corps, directly under General Headquarters. The structure of the EEF, would resemble the organisation of the force Allenby had commanded in France, which had reflected contemporary British combat doctrine, in the middle of 1917. Further, in order for him to directly command these corps in the field, Allenby created two EEF headquarters. His battle headquarters was established near Khan Yunis, while the remainder of his headquarters staff stayed in Cairo, so they could deal with the political and administrative aspects of control of Egypt and martial law.

On 12 August a conventional corps headquarters, designated the XX Corps and commanded by Lieutenant General P. W. Chetwode replaced Eastern Force. The headquarters of the XXI Corps commanded by Lieutenant General E. S. Bulfin (arrived from Salonika as officer commanding the 60th (London) Division) was formed, while the headquarters of Desert Column was renamed Desert Mounted Corps commanded by Lieutenant General H. G. Chauvel.

==Service history==
===1917===

The first operation planned for the Desert Mounted Corps was to break through the Turkish lines, in southern Palestine, which stretched for from Beersheba in the east to the Mediterranean coast at Gaza in the west. Once Beersheba was secured the mounted troops would be concentrated on the British right to cut off and destroy the retreating Turkish forces. Any mounted attack on Beersheba would require a march of over dry and unknown country. So prior to the attack a reconnaissance of the Turkish positions was carried out mapping tracks and wadi crossings. Chauvel deployed his corps, with one division forward occupying a lightly held line between Shellal and El Gamli. Which was also responsible for short patrols into no man&#x27;s land and longer patrols to reconnoitre the Turkish defences. A second division supported the front line based around Abasan el Kebir. While the third division was resting at Tel el Marrakeb. Each month the divisions moved around so no one division spent longer at the front than was necessary.

To prepare for the coming offensive each man was issued an officers-style saddle wallet, in which they could carry three days&#x27; rations and some spare clothing. Attached to the saddle were two nosebags with or two days of grain for the horse. A third day&#x27;s grain and two days&#x27; rations for the men were carried with the divisional train. Every two weeks the forward division would move &quot;en masse&quot; towards Beersheba; leaving in the afternoon they marched all night to be in a position on the high ground in front of town by dawn the next day. There they remained all day and returned to their base the following night. These long-range patrols got the men and horses used to desert travel, with no water available for the horses from the afternoon they left until they returned. These patrols were not without danger and they were often attacked by Turkish aircraft and artillery which had previously registered approach routes, wadi crossings and the high ground. The patrols accustomed the Turks to the appearance of British troops in front of Beersheba, without them taking any offensive action before withdrawing again. This patrol routine continued until the end of October when the corps moved forward for the coming offensive.

After dark 30 October the ANZ MTD DIV headed for Beersheba securing their first objectives by 08:00 the next morning. The 2nd Brigade moved on Tel el Sakaty hill, the New Zealand Brigade towards Tel el Saba, while the 1st LH Brigade was the reserve. At 10:00 the Australian Division reached their start point the Khashim Zanna hill overlooking Beersheba, sending patrols forward to reconnoitre a way into the town. At the same time the advancing 7th Brigade was forced to dismount in the face of heavy opposition from well constructed Turkish defences. Now the ANZ MTD DIV was also facing heavy resistance and it was not until 13:00 that the 2nd Brigade captured Tel el Sakaty and at 13:30 cut the road north to Jerusalem. Around the same time that XX Corps secured their objectives in the west.

By now the New Zealand Brigade was unable to proceed being pinned down by Turkish artillery and machine-gun fire. The 3rd LH Brigade with the divisional artillery were sent to assist the attack from the south. Major-General Edward Chaytor in command of the ANZ MTD DIV, committed his reserve 1st Light Horse Brigade to support the southern attack. The 2nd and 3rd Light Horse Regiments unable to approach their objectives under cover, charged in the open through artillery and machine-gun fire, until they reached a depression in the ground short of their target where they were able to dismount and fight forward on foot. At 14:00 the 2nd Light Horse Regiment captured their objective and relieved the pressure in front of the New Zealanders, who carried out a bayonet charge capturing their own objective, 120 prisoners and several machine-guns. The last defences in front of Beersheba had been taken, but there was still a large expanse of open ground to be crossed in front of the town itself.

The two divisions, less the 5th MTD Brigade, were ordered to mount up and capture Beersheba before dark. The 4th LH Brigade, away, which until then had seen no fighting received the order at 16:30. Brigadier-General William Grant in command of the brigade, realising that sunset was only half-an-hour away decided to charge the town from the south-east. Asking for artillery support he set out with his two available regiments. The 1/1st Nottinghamshire Royal Horse Artillery (RHA) and 1/A Battery, Honourable Artillery Company (HAC) galloped into the open, halted short of the town and opened fire. Which was the signal for Grants brigade to charge the Turkish defences. Jumping the two lines of trenches the brigade dismounted and within ten minutes had captured the position. Grant rallied his brigade, left a small guard force behind and charged into Beersheba and by 18:00 had secured the town, capturing 1,200 prisoners and fourteen artillery guns.

The AUS MTD DIV occupied the town while the ANZ MTD DIV put out a skirmish line to the north and north-west. With Beersheba secure phase two the attack on Gaza began at 23:00 1 November and by 06:30 the next morning the front line had been penetrated and the Turkish defenders withdrawing. Phase three was an attack on the open Turkish left flank, supported by the 53rd (Welsh) Division and the Camel Corps Brigade. The ANZ MTD DIV advanced to the Hebron road, near Bir el Makruneh, capturing 200 prisoners and several machine-guns en route. Operations were curtailed by lack of water in the region which necessitated the corps keeping the AUS MTD DIV in Beersheba. The town did originally have an ample water supply from seven wells but five of them had been destroyed by the Turks during the battle.

Over the next five days the ANZ MTD DIV, the 5th, 7th Mounted and the Camel Corps Brigades and the 53rd Division pushed northwards and held out at Tel Khuweilfeh against a Turkish counter-attack from the 3rd Cavalry Division, the 19th, 27th and part of the 16th Divisions. With all the Turkish reserves concentrated on the Desert Mounted Corps front, on 6 November when XXI Corps attacked in the west they captured all their first day objectives. That evening the AUS MTD DIV moved to the Sharia region in preparation for the expected breakthrough and pursuit of the retreating Turkish forces. The ANZ and AUS MTD DIVs were ordered to move into the Turkish rear area as soon as their path was clear, the ANZ MTD DIV on the right. The YEO MTD DIV would remain behind with the 53rd Division. In part the deployment was influenced by the available water supplies to their front.

On 7 November the AUS MTD DIV was fighting dismounted in support of the 60th (2/2nd London) Division and darkness had fallen before they could mount up and pursue the retreating Turks. The ANZ MTD DIV had better luck and had found a hole in the Turkish front and had advance to the train station at Umm el Ameidat on the Junction Station-Beersheba rail line, capturing 400 prisoners and a large quantity of ammunition and stores. By that night the division had moved forward a further east and engaged a strong Turkish rearguard position. Elsewhere on 7 November the XXI Corps had eventually succeeded in capturing Gaza.

===Pursuit from Gaza===

Over the night of 7/8 November there was a general Turkish withdrawal, the Desert Mounted Corps supported by the 60th Division were ordered to advance at dawn 8 November at their best speed to the north-west in an attempt to cut off the retreating Gaza garrison. The ANZ MTD DIV, with the 7th Mounted Brigade attached, were given the objective of Bureir, north-east of Gaza, to their left was the AUS MTD DIV then the 60th Division. The corps advance was met by pockets of resistance, varying in size from company to several regiments, but the speed of the British advance had prevented them forming any type of organised defences. At 11:00 the Turks managed to gather enough of a force together to counter-attack the 2nd LH Brigade at Tel el Nejile which brought the ANZ MTD DIV to a halt. Chaytor pushed the 7th MTD Brigade through his centre towards Bir el Jemameh, where it was known there was a supply of water. At 13:00 just before they reached the village they also were counter-attacked, which drove back their left flank. The brigade only being saved by the arrival of the 1st LH Brigade from the west, which forced the Turks back. The light horsemen continued into the village, capturing the water pumping station intact and the high ground to the north. The AUS MTD DIV and 60th Divisions were also successful and fought several small battles during which they captured a number of heavy howitzers by the simple tactic of going round and charging the position from the rear. At 15:00 the 60th Division came under heavy artillery fire from the area of Huj and requested help from some passing squadrons of the Warwickshire Yeomanry and Queen&#x27;s Own Worcestershire Hussars, part of the 5th MTD Brigade. Lieutenant-Colonel Hugh Cheape of the Warwicks led the force into dead ground to about from the Turkish guns unobserved. Huj was the location of the Turkish Headquarters, the terminus of their military rail line from the coast. The position consisted of a battery of field artillery another of mountain artillery and four machine-guns forward with another two artillery batteries and three heavy howitzers in a depth position at the rear. The yeomanry squadrons came out of the dead ground, charged the position from the flank and had almost reached it before the Turks managed to turn their guns around and opened fire at point blank range. The fight was over in minutes the Turkish gunners killed or wounded and the positions twelve guns captured. British loses were heavy of the 170 men that started the charge seventy-five were killed or wounded. With Huj captured the AUS MTD DIV were able to move in and water their horses, the successful charge also captured the main Turkish ammunition depot and their radio code books which were used to decipher Turkish signals until January 1918. That afternoon the 4th Brigade was ordered to turn left and try and link up with XXI Corps advancing along the coast. Moving at their best speed, at times going around instead of fighting through Turkish positions, the brigade linked up with the Imperial Service Cavalry Brigade just before dark near Beit Hanun. Also on 8 November the YEO MTD DIV had moved to the British left, to attack the Turkish right which would force them across the front of the 53rd Division and the Camel Corps Brigade at Tel KhuweiKeh. The 8th MTD Brigade began the attack but were dislodge the Turkish defenders before being ordered back to Sharia, to prepare for a pursuit of the Turkish forces withdrawing on the coastal plain.

The attempt to cut off the Gaza garrison had failed, their strong rearguard resistance and the scarcity of water had both played a part in stopping the corps from fulfilling their objective. The corps instead was ordered to pursue the retreating Turkish forces. The ANZ MTD DIV objectives would be Bureir and then El Mejdel. The AUS MTD DIV on their right had Arak el Menshiye and El Faluje as their objectives. The YEO MTD DIV would advance along the coast. Just after day break on 9 November the ANZ MTD DIV moved out, meeting only light opposition the 1st LH Brigade entered Bureir at 08:30. The 2nd LH Brigade was approaching El Huleikat about an hour later when they come upon a rearguard position on the high ground to the north-west of the village, dismounting the brigade attacked capturing 600 prisoners. The 1st LH Brigade reached El Mejdel at noon, defeating the Turkish defenders in a brief fight taking 170 prisoners and capturing the water supply intact. Orders were received to support the advance of XXI Corps, to do so the ANZ MTD DIV were ordered to press on to Beit Duras in the north-east. By nightfall the 1st LH Brigade had reached Esdud, and the 2nd LH Brigade after capturing a Turkish convoy and 350 prisoners en route captured another 200 prisoners at the villages of Suafir el Sharkiye and Arak Suweidan.

The AUS MTD DIV spent 9 November watering its horse and did not set out until that evening, for their objective Tel el Hesi, Arak el Menshiye and El Faluje. Travelling by night the 3rd LH Brigade with an artillery battery was in front with the 4th LH and 5th MTD Brigades following on behind. At 04:30 they stopped at Tel el Hesi to wait for daylight before continuing. They eventually linked up with the ANZ MTD DIV at 08:00. The YEO MTD DIV arrived some hours later, so by mid-afternoon 10 November the corps less the New Zealand Brigade was in a line from Arak el Menshiy to the coast. The corps had advanced but problems with supplies were becoming acute, the corps horses alone required over of fodder a day. The only supply line was an un-metalled road between Gaza and Junction Station, some of it through deep sand which the army&#x27;s trucks could not negotiate fully loaded. To continue the advance it was decided that some of the infantry would remain in their present positions. Only the 53rd Division from XX Corps and the 52nd (Lowland) and 75th Divisions from XXI Corps continued with the advance. The Desert Mounted Corps divisions were in a bad shape having fought for several days without any rest and were short of water, some of the horses had been without water for over eighty-four hours, food for the men and forage was also in short supply. The delay allowed the Turkish forces to consolidate and by 10 November they were constructing a new defence line from Tel el Murre on the coast, along the high ground on the right bank of the Nahr Sukereir river, through Burka to Kustine.

===Mughar Ridge===

On 10 November, the 1st LH Brigade out in front of the corps captured intact a bridge at Jisr Isdud, digging in on the north bank of the river, the brigade held out against a Turkish counter-attack supported by artillery. In the east the YEO and AUS MTD DIVs located Turkish defences from Kustine, to Bayt Jibrin. In order for the infantry to catch up with the corps, Allenby ordered them to hold firm until 13 November. His plan was to attack the centre with his infantry while the mounted troops moved around their open right flank. The YEO MTD DIV which was still in relatively good shape was ordered, along with the Camel Corps Brigade and the New Zealand Brigade, to move to the coast and relieve the Anzac Mounted Division, except the 1st LH Brigade holding the bridgehead. The AUS MTD DIV would remain in the east around Zeita, defending the British right flank. Brigadier-General Charles Cox in command of the 1st LH Brigade was ordered to enlarge their bridgehead. Unable to find a suitable ford, during the night of 11/12 November the 2nd Light Horse Regiment swam their horses across the river, then captured the Turkish position on the Tel el Murre hill with a bayonet charge. Later the same day the 52nd (Lowland) and 75th Divisions crossed the bridgehead and within ninety minutes had captured Burka.

On the right flank the patrolling by the AUS MTD DIV had convinced the Turks that they were confronted there by a much larger force. At 13:00 they sent a force of around 5,000 men in two pincer columns against Balin defended by the 5th MTD Brigade. The manoeuvre almost surrounded the British position, &#x27;B&#x27; Battery H.A.C. was forced to withdraw its guns by sections, firing at point blank range, to cover the section pulling back. The brigade had only just managed to extradite itself from the village, when the Turks turned on the 3rd LH Brigade at Berkusie. The situation was critical so Major General H Hodgson ordered the division to withdraw to Bir Summeil and Khurbet Jeladiyeh. As the order was going out a train loaded with Turkish reinforcements arrived and attacked the 5th MTD Brigade. But by now the divisions artillery was in position to intervene and broke up the Turkish attack allowing the 5th MTD and 3rd LH Brigades to withdraw to Summeil, where they were able to hold on against the Turkish offensive.

A new British assault began on 13 November, with the YEO MTD DIV on the left of the two infantry divisions and the AUS MTD DIV to their right. The 7th MTD Brigade replaced the exhausted 5th MTD Brigade in the AUS MTD DIV and the 2nd LH Brigade became the corps reserve. At 08:00 the 8th MTD Brigade had reached the village of Yebnah, which was only held by a small Turkish force. Fighting through they made for the villages of Zernuka and Kubeibe, the last Turkish positions on their right. Both villages were heavily defended with several machine-guns and the brigades progress faltered. Keeping the 6th MTD Brigade as the YEO MTD DIV reserve the 22nd MTD Brigade was dispatched to force a way between Zernuka and El Mughar and occupy Aqir in the Turkish rear, but the 22nd were also stopped by heavy machine-gun fire. The 52nd Division attempting to attack El Mughar were also stopped in their tracks and requested the YEO MTD DIV assist them by attacking the village from the east. The 6th MTD Brigade were given the task, Brigadier-General C.A.C. Godwin ordered the Royal Buckinghamshire Yeomanry and the Queen&#x27;s Own Dorset Yeomanry to charge across of open ground, supported by their own artillery and machine-guns, to assault the village. Within minutes the Buckinghamshire Yeomanry had charged through the Turkish lines securing the position. The Dorset&#x27;s had a more difficult approach but both regiments were successful, for the loss of 129 men and 265 horses killed and wounded, they had killed 600 Turkish soldiers, captured another 1,100 prisoners, three artillery guns and several machine-guns. The 22nd MTD Brigade then pushed on to assault Aqir but was held up by strong Turkish defences, but they did capture another seventy prisoners and some machine-guns.

The 75th Division had also secured their objective and held out against a Turkish night time counter-attack and on the right the AUS MTD DIV captured Tel el Turmus virtually unopposed. The next day the Turkish forces were withdrawing and the corps were once again order in pursuit. Early in the day the AUS MTD DIV captured El Tine train station with large quantities of ammunition and other stores. Pushing on they penetrated behind the previous Turkish front line to a position east of Junction Station. The YEO MTD DIV, leading the 52nd Division captured Aqir and Naane unopposed except for some artillery shelling. The British attack had divided the Turkish forces in two. The larger contingent headed inland over the hills towards Jerusalem, pursued by the YEO MTD and AUS MTD DIVs. While the smaller force headed up the coast followed by the ANZ MTD DIV. The 1st LH and New Zealand Brigades captured Kubeibe and Zernuka in the morning, and continued towards Ramleh and Khurbet Surafend. While the Camel Corps advanced up the sand dunes on the extreme left. At 14:00 the New Zealand Brigade encountered a Turkish force at Ayun Kara but defeated them without much difficulty. Then half an hour later the brigade was surprised and surrounded only holding out following a bayonet charge. Reinforced by the 1st Light Horse and Camel Corps Brigades the New Zealanders held out for the rest of the day. The advance continued and on 15 November the ANZ MTD DIV captured Ramleh and 350 prisoners with no opposition, followed the next day by the New Zealand Brigade entering Jaffa. By now the Turkish forces were entrenched along the north bank of the Nahr el Auja River and the ANZ MTD DIV was ordered to halt, while the army concentrated on capturing Jerusalem. Since Beersheba the Desert Mounted Corps had advanced captured 5,720 prisoners, sixty artillery guns, fifty machine guns and large stocks of ammunition and other equipment.

===Jerusalem===
On 17 November the YEO MTD DIV pursuing the retreating Turkish forces through the hills in front of Jerusalem, came upon a strong rearguard position, on the ridge line between the villages of Sidun and Abu Shusheh. A force of 4,000 men supported by artillery and machine-guns the majority of which around Abu Shusheh, with a depth position to its south. Major-General George de S. Barrow ordered the 22nd MTD Brigade to attack the position from the north, the Camel Corps Brigade from the north-west and the 6th MTD Brigade from the south-west. At 07:00 the 22nd MTD and Camel Corps Brigades attacked on foot. Goodwin in command of the 6th MTD Brigade decided to attack mounted. He dispatched half of his machine-gun squadron and a squadron from the Berkshire Yeomanry forward to provide covering fire assisted by the Berkshire Battery R.H.A. located south-west of the village. He ordered the Buckinghamshire Yeomanry to charge Abu Shusheh, the remainder of the Berkshire Yeomanry on their left would charge a spur to the north of the village. The Queen&#x27;s Own Dorset Yeomanry would be the brigade reserve, protecting the brigades right flank. The artillery and machine-guns opened fire as the Berkshire Yeomanry moved into the open towards the village, but confronted by heavy machine-gun fire were forced to take cover in a defile. At the same time the Dorset Yeomanry moved around to the south to take that position from the rear, attracting the attention of the machine-gunners. Seeing this the Buckinghamshire Yeomanry came out of cover and charged the village. The Buckinghamshire Yeomanry and the two squadrons of Berkshire Yeomanry reached the village around the same time as the Dorset Yeomanry charged home on the machine-gun position. The position was secured but while clearing up the brigade was counter-attacked, which was broken up, suffering heavy losses, by the brigades artillery. By 09:00 the position was secured with over 400 Turkish dead, 360 prisoners and several machine-guns captured, British losses were thirty-seven dead and wounded. The Turkish survivors were pursued north by the 22nd MTD Brigade, who caught some prisoners, but an unknown number escaped into the surrounding hills.

By now the corps had been operating for seventeen days, advanced without rest and had again outstripped it supply lines. The country they were now operating in was unsuitable for horses, but the army&#x27;s transport vehicles were insufficient to bring the infantry divisions forward quickly. Allenby hoped to surrounded Jerusalem cutting the city off from any reinforcements, forcing its leaders to surrender without a fight. On 18 November the Yeomanry Division then at Ludd, was directed to advance as fast as possible, on a line Berfilya, Beit Ur el Tahta, to Bire. In the difficult terrain the 8th Mounted managed to reach Beit Ur el Tahta and the 22nd Brigade Shilta by that night. At the same time the 3rd LH and 4th LH Brigades from the AUS MTD DIV lead the 52nd and 75th Divisions up the main Jerusalem road to Kuryet el Enab, intending to turn north-east to the Nablus road. The 5th MTD Brigade moved independently along the Wadi Surar, protecting their right flank. The 53rd Division left Hebron to the east of Jerusalem to cut the Jericho road. To ease the supply problem on 19 November, the 75th Division took over from the AUS MTD DIV, which withdrew to El Mejdel. The 8th MTD and 22nd MTD Brigades continued their advance to Beitunia and Ain Arik, but around midday were confronted by a large Turkish force. Unable to make any progress both brigades held firm waiting for the 6th MTD Brigade to catch up with them. The next day (20 November), the 6th MTD and 8th MTD Brigades tried to reach Beitunia but were again held by the Turkish force and had made no headway by nightfall. In a concentrated effort all three brigades tried to take Beitunia on 21 November. The 6th MTD and 8th MTD Brigades in a direct assault from the west, while the 22nd MTD Brigade tried from further north to get around the right flank. The Turkish defenders had been reinforced, and outnumbered the yeomanry by three to one, and the attack failed. Several more attempts to capture the position also failed and the division was finally forced back that afternoon by even more Turkish reinforcements. Their situation now untenable they were ordered to withdraw after dark back to Beit Ur el Foka. Two days later on 23 November a lack of forage forced the division to send all their horses back to Ramleh.

Away from the mountains the ANZ MTD DIV deployed in observation posts along the River Auja, and had located four crossing points across the river. A bridge at Khurbet Hadrah and three fords. One east of the bridge at Muannis, a second at Jerisheh and the third at the river mouth. On 24 November the division was ordered to establish one of more bridgeheads on the opposing bank. Chaytor decided to force a crossing at the river mouth with diversionary attacks at the other three crossings. The only force he had available was the New Zealand Brigade supported by two infantry battalions from the 54th (East Anglian) Division, that had just arrived at the front. The infantry made the diversionary attacks while the New Zealanders successfully crossed at the river mouth defeating the small guard force. They then turned and charged upriver clearing the Turkish defences. One of the infantry battalions crossed the river forming two bridgeheads at Muannis and at the Khurbet Hadrah bridge. Two New Zealand squadrons were pushed into the high ground to the north as a covering force while a third guarded the crossing at the river mouth. That night the divisions engineers built a pontoon bridge across the river at Jerisheh, which was defended by the second infantry battalion. In daylight the Turks responded with an attack in force driving back the two covering squadrons and attacking the bridgehead at Khurbet Hadrah. The New Zealand squadron holding the ford at the river mouth reinforced by a New Zealand regiment attacked the Turkish right flank, while the divisions third regiment moved to support the Khurbet Hadrah bridgehead. But by 08:30 the Turks had driven the bridgehead at Khurbet Hadrah back over the river, soon after followed by the other bridgeheads. The Turkish assault made no attempt to follow the retreating division back over the river.

By 27 November the YEO MTD DIV in the hills had been reduced to around 800 men, less than an infantry battalion. Unable to hold a strong defensive line the division commenced patrolling between a small number of defended posts. One post near Zeitun composed of three officers and sixty men was attacked that afternoon by a Turkish battalion, supported by artillery and machine-guns. By nightfall they had been reduced to twenty-eight men but still held out. Two understrength troops were sent to reinforce the position, which managed to hold on against several attacks but had to be withdrawn in the morning. The Turks occupied the village which gave them an observation point looking out over the surrounded countryside. The YEO MTD DIV had to withdraw to avoid being overlooked during which it was continuously attacked by the Turks and was in danger of being surrounded. To relieve the situation the reserve AUS MTD DIV Australian Division and 7th MTD Brigade were ordered to march through the night to their assistance. The 7th MTD Brigade arrived at Beit Ur el Tahta at 05:00 28 November just in time to break up an attack on the 22nd MTD Brigade. A brigade from the 52nd Division was sent to cover the yeomanry exposed left flank. Discovering that the Turks had broken through a gap in the yeomanry defences and cut their supply route, the infantry successfully attacked and drove them back but were unable to dislodge a larger force located at Saffa. The AUS MTD DIV arrived at Khurbet Deiran that morning after marching , the 4th LH Brigade relieved the 6th MTD at 17:00. The fighting continued on and off throughout the night, often at close range but the yeomanry now supported by the Australians held on. The next day both divisions were withdrawn and replaced by two infantry divisions, Allenbys plan worked Jerusalem surrounded surrendered on 9 December. Between 31 October and 9 December the corps had advanced , captured 9,500 prisoners and eighty artillery guns.

===1918===
===Amman===
January 1918 started with the British holding a line of trenches to the north of Jaffa and Jerusalem. The Desert Mounted Corps was withdrawn to Gaza to rest and refit. In February the ANZ MTD DIV and the 60th (London) Divisions were relocated to Bethlehem and on 18 February were given orders to move into the Jordan Valley and capture Jericho. The advance began the next morning and by nightfall the ANZAC Division had reached El Muntar, only south of the Jericho. Travelling by narrow tracks the 1st LH Brigade reached the Dead Sea at dusk. By dawn 21 February the New Zealand Brigade reached Nebi Musa without opposition, and the 1st LH Brigade entered a deserted Jericho at 08:00. The divisions patrols located the Turkish forces holding a bridgehead on the west bank of the River Jordan at El Ghoraniyeh, to the east of Jericho, and in a position along the Wadi el Auja to the north of the city.

The campaign had settled down into static trench warfare in the west, however in the east Allenby decided to raid the Hedjaz Railway at Amman, to destroy the viaduct and railway tunnel. The ANZ MTD DIV, with the Camel Corps Brigade and 60th Division would carry out the raid. The plan was for 60th Division would force a river crossing, then the mounted force would head for Amman blow up the viaduct, tunnel and as much of the rail line as possible then withdraw, the infantry would remain on the east bank holding the bridgehead. On 21 March by 08:00 the infantry had completed a pontoon bridge across the Jordan south of El Ghoraniyeh and by 12:00 had a brigade on the eastern bank. Attempts to cross at El Ghoraniyeh failed until 23 March when in the early morning a raft crossing was made and by 04:00 part of the New Zealand Brigade was across the river and heading north. Eight hours later they had seized the high ground above El Ghoraniyeh, capturing seventy prisoners and several machine-guns. By that night a second pontoon bridge had been constructed at Hajlah, and three more at Ghoraniyeh. The whole raiding force were across the river before daylight on 24 March. The 1st Light Horse Brigade moved to El Mandesi to the north, covering the 60th Divisions attack on El Haud and Shunet Nimrin. After heavy fighting El Haud was captured at 15:00, a New Zealand squadron supporting the infantry, then attacked the Turkish right who retired to Es Salt. The 2nd LH and Camel Corps Brigades advanced up the Wadi Kefrein reaching Rujm el Oshh by 15:30. The remainder of the New Zealand Brigade advanced up the Wadi Jofet to El Sir, but the infantry had only advanced by nightfall. Rain started that night turning what were marked as tracks on their maps into small rivers. Struggling against the weather the 2nd Brigade travelled all night and reached Ain el Hekr by 04:30, only having covered in twenty-fours hours. It was even worse for the Camel Corps Brigade following behind their last unit arrived at Ain el Hekr fifteen hours later. The advance continued and although still raining the terrain was easier to cross and the leading troops of the two brigades linked up with the New Zealand Brigade at 05:30 26 March to the east of El Sir. The three brigades had been marching for three nights and two days and Chaytor decided to rest, for twenty-four hours, instead of pressing on and assaulting Amman. During the rest period a patrol from the 2nd LH Brigade attacked a Turkish position capturing 170 prisoners while another destroyed thirty German trucks and a car that were stuck in mud. That evening the 1st LH Brigade and 60th Division reached a deserted El Salt. The infantry were as exhausted as the mounted troop having fought for three days and nights to reach their present position and they also rested for twenty-four hours. Overnight Chaytor despatched two small patrols to blow up the rail line to the north and south of Amman. The group from the 2nd LH Brigade heading north come upon a large body of Turkish cavalry and were forced to turn back. The New Zealand party were more successful and destroyed a length or track south of Amman.

The ANZ MTD DIV resumed the raid early on 27 March, with an infantry brigade and two mountain artillery batteries moving in support from Es Salt. The Turks in the meantime had used the respite to bring up reinforcements if their own. Chaytor ordered the New Zealand Brigade to cross the Wadi Amman, south-west of Amman and secure the high ground overlooking the town from the south. A battalion from the Camel Corps Brigade would accompany them to destroy the rail line located there. The 2nd LH Brigade were ordered to move around to the rail line north of Amman and destroy the line there. Once that was done the brigade would attack Amman from the north-west, the remainder of the Camel Corps Brigade would attack from the west, while the infantry would continue to advance in support from Es Salt. The mounted brigades set out at 09:00, struggling through the mud it was not until 15:00 that the New Zealanders reached their objective. Their camel battalion started their demolition work and engaged a Turkish train with their machine-guns forcing it to pull back. The 2nd LH Brigade by 11:00 had got within of their objective, when they were attacked by a large Turkish force with artillery support. The Camel Corps Brigade heading directly for Amann was engaged by several machine-guns and could make no progress and the New Zealand Brigade was also attacked by increasing numbers of Turkish troops. Chaytor ordered the three brigades to hold firm until the infantry could arrive and support them. That night a small group from the 2nd LH Brigade did manage to infiltrate the Turkish lines and destroyed a rail bridge near Khurbet el Raseife.

Daylight brought down Turkish artillery on the divisions positions, around noon two infantry battalions caught up with the division. Chaytor decided on an immediate attack, with the infantry positioned between the 2nd LH and Camel Corps Brigades. The assault started at 14:00 and got to within of the Turkish lines when the 2nd LH Brigade were counter-attacked. The whole British attack faltered and they withdrew a short distance into a night time defensive position. The remainder of the infantry brigade and two mountain artillery batteries arrived at midday the next day. Turkish reinforcements had also arrived during the day and continued their attack against the 2nd LH Brigades position. To their rear at Es Salt the 1st LH Brigade came under attack from the 3rd Turkish Cavalry Division and two infantry brigades. Chaytor planned a new attack that night, the New Zealand Brigade were tasked to capture a large hill south-east of Amman. The Camel Corps and infantry would attack the town while the 2nd Brigade was to carry out diversionary operations in the north. The assault started at 02:00 the New Zealanders reached the top of the hill without the Turks firing a shot. But were then engaged by heavy machine-gun fire, followed by an infantry counter-attack at dawn. The attack by the Camel Corps and infantry brigade was initially successful capturing the first line of trenches with 200 prisoners. By 09:00 the Camel Corps Brigade were about from the main Turkish position when it came under heavy machine-gun fire and an infantry counter-attack was launched against the infantry brigade. The counter-attack was defeated but the British infantry were under an almost constant threat from the Turks and were just able to hold where they were. More Turkish reinforcements arrived at 10:00 and attacked the New Zealanders, which was defeated with support from the Somerset Battery R.H.A which had just arrived after a thirty-hour march. Later in the morning the New Zealanders and Camel Brigade both fought off another direct attack on their positions. That afternoon the infantry tried once again to reach Amman, but machine-gun fire from both flanks forced them to withdraw. In the face of ever increasing Turkish reinforcement Chaytor decided they had no hope of taking Amman. The British were now being attacked at Es Salt and at Amman, with no reserves available Major-General John Shea of 60th Division but in overall command of the raiding force decided to call off the operation. That night the ANZ MTD DIV, Camel Corps Brigade and attached infantry pulled back reaching Ain el Sira the next evening. On 31 March the Turkish attacks at Es Salt continued all day until 23:00 when having made no progress they finally broke off the engagement. The last of the British troops crossed to the west bank of the Jordan late on 2 April. In the twelve days fighting 1,600 men had been killed, wounded or were reported missing. Turkish losses were 1,00 taken prisoner, the stores and ammunition at El Salt and an estimated 1,700 dead and wounded. The infantry had managed to hold a bridgehead at Ghoraniyeh and a second bridge was built further north at the mouth of the river Auja.

===Es Salt===
During April the Turkish forces on the east bank had increased to around 8,000 men based on Shunet Nimrin. Allenby proposed a raid in connection with their Arab allies to cut off and destroy them. The raids timing come during the corps reorganisation and the only forces available were the ANZ MTD and AUS MTD DIVs, two infantry brigades from 60th Division, and the Imperial Service Cavalry and Infantry Brigades. The raid commenced 29 April the AUS MTD DIV reinforced with the 1st LH and 2nd LH Brigade crossed the Jordan and moved into the mountains. The 5th MTD and 2nd LH Brigades made for El Haud, the 3rd LH Brigade headed towards El Salt, the 4th LH and the reserve 1st LH Brigade headed for the Turkish controlled bridge at Jisr el Damieh.

The 4th LH Brigade reached the Jisr el Damieh bridge at 06:00, the leading 11th Light Horse Regiment attempted to seize the bridge but the Turkish defenders were well dug in and the attempt failed. A second brigade attempt was also defeated by the strength of the Turkish defenders. Instead the brigade, with the divisions three R.H.A batteries, took up a defensive position covering the track from Jisr el Damieh to El Salt. That afternoon the batteries were used to disperse a large column of Turkish troops that were marching towards them. The infantry attacked the Turks at Shunet Nimrin, but could only occupy the forward positions. The large numbers of defenders preventing any further progress. At 15:00 the corps ordered the reserve 1st LH Brigade to follow the main force towards El Salt. Where the 3rd LH Brigade were already approaching the town but were engaged by a Turkish position to the north-west. A bayonet charge by the 9th and 10th Light Horse Regiments captured the position. The 8th Light Horse Regiment then galloped into the town which was full of Turkish soldiers. By 19:00 the town was secured with 300 prisoners, several machine-guns and the Fourth Army headquarters captured. The AUS MTD DIV, 1st LH, 2nd LH Brigades and two artillery batteries travelling through the night reached Es Salt early on 1 May. The force deployed brigades to the east, north, and west while the 5th MTD Brigade moved on Shunet Nimrin.

At 07:30 around 4,000 Turkish soldier appeared on the east bank of the Jordan and advanced on the 4th LH Brigade position from the east. At the same time another 1,000 infantry and 500 cavalry approached from the west. The three artillery batteries with the brigade opened fire on the approaching Turkish troops and Turkish artillery located on the west bank returned their fire. Around 10:00 they managed to overwhelm a small outpost the survivors from the two squadrons were pulling back to the main position when an all out Turkish assault on the brigade started. Outnumbered by about five to one the brigades right flank was turned. Grant in command of the brigade ordered an immediate withdrawal south. Some Turkish troops had got behind the brigade and were blocking the route south. Now fighting at close quarters the brigade was in danger of being overrun. The New Zealand Brigade away dispatched two of its regiments to assist the 4th LH Brigade. On the brigade right flank the 4th Light Horse Regiment was covering the retreat of the three artillery batteries. &#x27;A&#x27; Battery H.A.C. was on the right, the Nottinghamshire Battery R.H.A. in the centre and &#x27;B&#x27; Battery H.A.C. in the south. The two northern batteries &#x27;A&#x27; and the Notts attempted to withdraw by sections covering each other firing over open sights. Gradually the artillerymen and horses were shot down and the guns backed into a position with no exit. Forced to make a stand as the Turks had advanced to within on three sides, the batteries ammunition ran out. The last surviving gunners and light-horsemen abandoned the guns and escaped by climbing into the hills. &#x27;B&#x27; Battery H.A.C., less one gun that overturned, did escape being encircled and repositioned further south to cover the brigade withdrawal. By midday the brigade had found a new defensive position in a small wadi. Chaytor now arrived to find out for himself what the situation was and ordered the brigade to withdraw further, to a new position north of the Umm el Shert track. During which the two New Zealand regiments arrived and a new defence line was established from the Jordan to the foothills. The Turks attacked the new defence line three times during the day but were beaten back suffering heavy losses.

Elsewhere at dawn the 5th MTD Brigade had left Es Salt for El Howeij arriving at 13:00 but were unable to dislodge the large Turkish force guarding the road bridge into the town. To assist them the 1st LH Brigade were ordered to attack El Haud in the west. By the end of the day the Turkish defenders were still holding off both brigades. That night the 2nd LH Brigade was also sent to assist the 5th MTD and both were ordered to support 60th Divisions dawn attack on Shunet Nimrin and El Haud on 2 May. With the 4th LH Brigades position in danger the 1st LH Brigade were ordered to support them by defending the track from Umm el Shert. The whole British force was now in danger from the Turkish 3rd Cavalry Division and part of an infantry division moving towards El Salt from the north-west and another detachment heading towards Amman from the east. The attack on Shunet Nimrin by 60th Division began at dawn but they made little progress confronted by a strong Turkish force. At 08:00 5th Brigade attacked their right flank at El Howeij bridge, by 10:30 2nd LH Brigade were still en route to their objective El Hand. At the same time 3rd LH Brigade at Es Salt was attacked by a large Turkish Force. Under heavy pressure their lines were forced back a little and a regiment from the 1st LH Brigade was sent to their aid. This reinforcement made little difference and another 1st Brigade regiment was sent to support them an hour later. The fortunate arrival of a supply column with 100,000 rounds of small-arm ammunition and 300 artillery rounds assisted the 3rd LH Brigade defence. Their machine-guns which until then had been conserving ammunition were able to break up the Turkish assault.

The British advance was floundering the 2nd LH and 5th MTD Brigade commanders informed the divisional commander Major-General Hodgson that they could not reach their objectives by nightfall. He ordered them to continue as good as possible to assist the infantry attacking Shunet Nimrin.

<text>Semiheavy water is the result of replacing one of the protium (normal hydrogen, H) in normal water with deuterium (H; or less correctly, D). It exists whenever there is water with H and H in the mix. This is because hydrogen atoms (H) are rapidly exchanged between water molecules. Water with 50% H and 50% H, is about 50% HHO and 25% each of HO and HO, in dynamic equilibrium.
In normal water, about 1 molecule in 3,200 is HDO (HHO) (one hydrogen in 6,400 is H). By comparison, heavy water DO or HO occurs at a proportion of about 1 molecule in 41 million (i.e., 1 in 6,400). This makes semiheavy water far more common than &quot;normal&quot; heavy water.

The freezing point of semiheavy water is close to the freezing point of heavy water at 3.8°C compared to the 3.82°C of heavy water.

== Production ==
On Earth, semiheavy water occurs naturally in normal water at a proportion of about 1 molecule in 3,200; because 1 in 6,400 hydrogen atoms in water is deuterium, which is 1 part in 3,200 by weight. HDO may be separated from normal water by distillation or electrolysis, or by various chemical exchange processes, all of which exploit a kinetic isotope effect. Partial enrichment also occurs in natural bodies of water under certain evaporation conditions. (For more information about the distribution of deuterium in water, see Vienna Standard Mean Ocean Water and Hydrogen isotope biogeochemistry.)

<doc id="458204" wikidata="Q181007" url="?curid=458204" title="Hattusa">
<text>Hattusa, also Hattuşa, Ḫattuša, Hattusas, or Hattusha, was the capital of the Hittite Empire in the late Bronze Age during two distinct periods. Its ruins lie near modern Boğazkale, Turkey (originally Boğazköy) within the great loop of the Kızılırmak River (Hittite: &quot;Marashantiya&quot;; Greek: &quot;Halys&quot;).

Charles Texier brought attention to the ruins after his visit in 1834. Over the following century, sporadic exploration occurred, involving different archaeologists. In the 20th century, the German Oriental Society and the German Archaeological Institute conducted systematic excavations, which continue to this day. Hattusa was added to the UNESCO World Heritage Site list in 1986.

==History==

The earliest traces of settlement on the site are from the sixth millennium BC during the Chalcolithic period. Toward the end of the 3rd Millennium BC the Hattian people established a settlement on locations that had been occupied even earlier and referred to the site as Hattush. In the 19th and 18th centuries BC, merchants from Assyria, centered at Kanesh (Neša) (modern Kültepe) established a trading post there, setting up in their own separate quarter of the lower city.

A carbonized layer apparent in excavations attests to the burning and ruin of the city of Hattusa around 1700 BC. The responsible party appears to have been King Anitta from Kussara, who took credit for the act and erected an inscribed curse for good measure:

though in fact the city was rebuilt afterward, possibly by a son of Anitta.

In the first half of the second millennium BC, around the year 1650 BC the Hittite king Labarna moved the capital from Neša to Hattusa and took the name of Hattusili, the &quot;one/man from Hattusa&quot;. After the Kaskians arrived to the kingdom&#x27;s north, they twice attacked the city and under king Tudhaliya I, the Hittites moved the capital north to Sapinuwa. Under Muwatalli II, they moved south to Tarhuntassa but the king assigned his younger brother, the future Hattusili III as governor over Hattusa. In the mid-13th century BC Hittite ruler Mursili III returned the seat to Hattusa, where the capital remained until the end of the Hittite kingdom in the 12th century BC (KBo 21.15 i 11–12).
At its peak, the city covered and comprised an inner and outer portion, both surrounded by a massive and still visible course of walls erected during the reign of Suppiluliuma I (–1322 BC (short chronology)). The inner city covered an area of some and was occupied by a citadel with large administrative buildings and temples. The royal residence, or acropolis, was built on a high ridge now known as Büyükkale (Great Fortress). The city displayed over of walls, with inner and outer skins around of thick and of space between them, adding of the total thickness.

To the south lay an outer city of about , with elaborate gateways decorated with reliefs showing warriors, lions, and sphinxes. Four temples were located here, each set around a porticoed courtyard, together with secular buildings and residential structures. Outside the walls are cemeteries, most of which contain cremation burials. Modern estimates put the population of the city around 10,000; in the early period, the inner city housed a third of that number. The dwelling houses that were built with timber and mud bricks have vanished from the site, leaving only the stone-built walls of temples and palaces.

The city was destroyed, together with the Hittite state itself, around 1200 BC, as part of the Late Bronze Age collapse. Excavations suggest that Hattusa was gradually abandoned over a period of several decades as the Hittite empire disintegrated. It has been suggested that a regional drought occurred at that time. Still, signs of final destruction by fire have been noted. The site was subsequently abandoned until 800 BC, when a modest Phrygian settlement appeared in the area.

==Archaeology==

In 1833, the French archaeologist Félix Marie Charles Texier (1802–1871) was sent on an exploratory mission to Turkey, where in 1834 he discovered monumental ruins near the town of Boğazköy. Texier made topographical measurements, produced illustrations, and composed a preliminary site plan. The site was subsequently visited by a number of European travelers and explorers, most notably the German geographer Heinrich Barth in 1858. Georges Perrot excavated at the site in 1861 and at the nearby site of Yazılıkaya. Perrot was the first to suggest, in 1886, that Boğazköy was the Hittite capital of Hattusa. In 1882 German engineer Carl Humann completed a full plan of the site.

Ernest Chantre opened some trial trenches at the village then called Boğazköy, in 1893–94, with excavations being cut short by a cholera outbreak. Significantly Chantre discovered some fragments of clay tablets inscribed with cuneiform. The fragments contain text in both the Akkadian language and what later was determined to be the Hittite language. Between 1901 and 1905 Waldemar Belck visited the site several times, finding a number of tablets.

In 1905 Hugo Winckler conducted some soundings at Boğazköy on behalf of the German Oriental Society (DOG), finding 35 more cuneiform tablet fragments at the site of the royal fortress, Büyükkale. Winckler began actual excavations in 1906, focusing mainly on the royal fortress area. Thousands of tablets were recovered, most in the then unreadable Hittite language. The few Akkadian texts firmly identified the site as Hattusa. Winckler returned in 1907 (with Otto Puchstein, Heinrich Kohl, Ludwig Curtius and Daniel Krencker), and briefly in 1911 and 1912 (with Theodore Makridi). Work stopped with the outbreak of WWI. Tablets from these excavations were published in two series &quot;Keilschrifttexte aus Boghazkoi&quot; (KB0) and &quot;Keilschrift urkunden aus Boghazköi&quot; (KUB). Work resumed in 1931 under prehistorian Kurt Bittel with establishing stratigraphy as the major focus. The work was under the auspices of the DOG and German Archaeological Institute (Deutsches Archäologisches Institut) and lasted 9 seasons until being suspended due to the outbreak of WWII in 1939. Excavation resumed in 1952 under Bittel with Peter Neve replacing as field director in 1963 and as director in 1978, continuing until 1993. The focus was on the Upper City area. Publication of tablets was resumed in the KUB and KBo. In 1994 Jürgen Seeher assumed control of the excavation, leading there until 2005, with the focus on the Büyükkaya and non-monumental areas including economic and residential spaces. From 2006 on, while some archaeology continued under new director Andreas Schachner, activities have been more focused toward restoration and preparation for tourist operations.
During the 1986 excavations a large (35 × 24 cm, 5 kg in weight, with 2 attached chains) inscribed metal tablet was discovered 35 meters west of the Sphinx Gate. The tablet, from the 13th century BC, contained a treaty between Hittite Tudḫaliya IV and Kurunta, King of Tarḫuntašša. It is held at the Museum of Anatolian Civilizations in Ankara. During 1991 repair work at the site a Mycenae bronze sword was found on the western slope. It was inscribed, in Akkadian, &quot;As Duthaliya the Great King shattered the Assuwa-Country he dedicated these swords to the Storm-God, his lord&quot;. Another significant find during the 1990-91 excavation season in the &quot;Westbau&quot; building of the upper city, was 3400 sealed bullae and clay lumps dating from the 2nd half of the 13th century BC. They were primarily associated with land documents.

===Cuneiform royal archives===

Forty mercantile documents written in the Old Assyrian dialect of Akkadian were found in the early 2nd millennium BC karum. By the middle of the 2nd millennium a scribal community had grown up in Hattusa based on Syrian, Mesopotamian, and Hurrian input. This included the usual range of Akkadian and Sumerian language texts.

One of the most important discoveries at the site has been the cuneiform royal archives of clay tablets from the Hittite Empire New Kingdom period, known as the Bogazköy Archive, consisting of official correspondence and contracts, as well as legal codes, procedures for cult ceremony, oracular prophecies and literature of the ancient Near East. One particularly important tablet, currently on display at the Istanbul Archaeology Museum, details the terms of a peace settlement reached years after the Battle of Kadesh between the Hittites and the Egyptians under Ramesses II, in 1259 or 1258 BC. A copy is on display in the United Nations in New York City as an example of the earliest known international peace treaties.

Although the 30,000 or so clay tablets recovered from Hattusa form the main corpus of Hittite literature, archives have since appeared at other centers in Anatolia, such as Tabigga (Maşat Höyük) and Sapinuwa (Ortaköy).

===Sphinxes===

A pair of sphinxes found at the southern gate in Hattusa were taken for restoration to Germany in 1917. The better-preserved was returned to Turkey in 1924 and placed on display in the Istanbul Archaeology Museum, but the other remained in Germany where it was on display at the Pergamon Museum from 1934 until it was moved to the Boğazköy Museum outside the Hattusa ruins, along with the Istanbul sphinx reuniting the pair near their original location.

<text>The Battle of Maida, fought on 4 July 1806 was a battle between the British expeditionary force and a French force outside the town of Maida in Calabria, Italy during the Napoleonic Wars. John Stuart led 5,236 British troops to victory over about 5,400 troops under the command of French general Jean Reynier, inflicting significant losses while incurring relatively few casualties. Maida is located in the toe of Italy, about west of Catanzaro.

In early 1806, the French invaded and overran the Kingdom of Naples, forcing King Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies and his government to flee to Sicily. The Calabrians revolted against their new conquerors and Stuart&#x27;s expeditionary force tried to exploit the unrest by raiding the coast. While ashore, the British encountered Reynier&#x27;s division and the two sides engaged in battle. The 19th-century historians presented the action as a typical fight between French columns and British lines. This view of the battle has been called into doubt by at least one modern historian who argued that the French deployed into lines. Nobody questions the result which was a one-sided British victory.

After the battle, Stuart captured some isolated garrisons in Calabria and was transported back to Sicily by the Royal Navy. Two weeks after the battle, the city of Gaeta fell to the French after a long siege. While Stuart succeeded in preventing a French invasion of Sicily and sustained the revolt in Calabria, he missed an opportunity to assist the defenders of Gaeta.

== Background ==

Following the decision by King Ferdinand to side with the Third Coalition against Napoleon I of France, French forces had invaded the Kingdom of Naples in the spring of 1806, after the British and Russian forces supposedly defending the kingdom evacuated Italy altogether: the British to Sicily and the Russians to Corfu. The Neapolitan-Sicilian army was crushed at the Battle of Campo Tenese, forcing Ferdinand to flee to Sicily and concede the Neapolitan crown to the French. Napoleon then installed his brother Joseph Bonaparte on the Neapolitan throne.

By July 1806, the French had crushed all Neapolitan resistance except for the uprising in Calabria and a garrison at Gaeta. There, André Masséna&#x27;s force become embroiled in a lengthy siege. The British decided to organise an expedition into Calabria to further the insurrection against the French, and prevent any potential invasion of Sicily.

== Battle ==

A British force of over 5,000 men commanded by Major-General John Stuart sailed from Messina on 27 June, landing in the Gulf of Sant&#x27;Eufemia three days later. At the same time a French force under the command of General Jean Reynier, the only French force in Calabria, moved to confront them. The exact size of the French force is unknown. Contemporary French sources range between 5050 and 5450. Some later historians have suggested a force as large as 6400 but the most recent estimates are closer to 5400.

On the morning of 4 July, Reynier broke camp and advanced toward level terrain along the shallow Lomato River. Believing his army superior in numbers, Stuart marched toward the same location nearly parallel to the French column. As both forces deployed from march column, they ended up in echelon formation. On the French side, the left flank was leading, while on the British side the right flank was leading. On the French left, General of Brigade Louis Fursy Henri Compère was echeloned forward, with the 1st Light Infantry Regiment on the left and the 42nd Line Infantry Regiment to its right. The center, commanded by General of Brigade Luigi Gaspare Peyri, included two battalions of Poles and the 4th battalion of the 1st Swiss Regiment. On the right flank, General of Brigade Antoine Digonet trailed the other two formations. Digonet&#x27;s command comprised the 23rd Light Infantry and 9th Chasseurs à Cheval Regiments and the field guns. Opposing the French was Colonel James Kempt&#x27;s Advanced Guard on the British right flank, echeloned forward. To Kempt&#x27;s left rear was Colonel Wroth Palmer Acland&#x27;s 2nd Brigade. Well to Acland&#x27;s left rear marched Colonel John Oswald&#x27;s 3rd Brigade, which formed the center. Colonel Lowry Cole&#x27;s 1st Brigade deployed on the left flank with the artillery. Cole was closer to the French than Oswald. Off conducting diversionary actions was the 20th Foot, which would be late.
Only when the armies were nearly in contact did Stuart realize that he was outnumbered, but he allowed the battle to commence without changing any orders. Kempt detached the Royal Corsican Rangers and Royal Sicilian Volunteers as skirmishers. These got into a brawl with Compère&#x27;s &quot;voltigeurs&quot; (light companies) and fell back. Kempt sent the flankers of the 35th Foot and the light company of the 20th Foot to help. Once the British troops halted the French skirmishers, they rejoined Kempt. At this time, Compère launched the 1st Light at Kempt, while the 42nd Line aimed to strike Acland. Since it had a head start, 1st Light&#x27;s attack columns met Kempt&#x27;s troops first. At 150 yards, the Advanced Guard fired its first volley but the 1st Light continued to advance. Kempt&#x27;s second volley was fired at a range of 80 yards, wounding Compère, who nevertheless urged his men on. Though disordered by their losses, the French closed to 20 yards, where they absorbed a third volley. This fire completely broke up the 1st Light and its soldiers turned and fled. Compère, who literally rode into the British line, and others were captured in the brief melée that followed.

As the 1st Light&#x27;s attack collapsed, Kempt&#x27;s men charged their shaken enemies. As the French formation disintegrated, the Advanced Guard went out of control, chasing the fleeing French as far as Maida. Meanwhile, the 42nd advanced on Acland in two battalion columns. The British fired at a range of 300 yards and blazed away until the French attack ground to a halt. Aware that their neighboring regiment was fleeing from the battlefield, the 42nd also decamped. Seeing his left wing in rout, Reynier sent Peyri&#x27;s brigade to face Acland. After a brisk action, the Poles were routed at bayonet point. The Swiss, however, maintained order and gave a good account of themselves. After Stuart sent reinforcements into the fight, the Swiss battalion fell back to join Digonet&#x27;s brigade. Acland and Cole now advanced on Digonet and the Swiss. The 9th Chasseurs charged, forcing the British battalions to form square. Oswald&#x27;s brigade appeared on the scene, but Digonet still held his ground, supported by the cavalry and the guns. Finally, the 20th Foot arrived from the coast and began firing at the exposed right flank of the 23rd Light. At this, Digonet and the Swiss began an orderly retreat and the battle was over.

Stuart&#x27;s 5,196-man force suffered 45 killed and 282 wounded for a total of 327 casualties. Out of a total of 6,440 soldiers, Reynier lost 490 killed and 870 wounded. In addition, the British captured 722 French soldiers and four cannon. Another authority asserts that the French saved their guns. The 1st Light Infantry lost 50% of its strength between killed, wounded, and prisoners. The action involving the 1st Light Infantry lasted only fifteen minutes.

==Aftermath==

Stuart ordered Kempt&#x27;s Advanced Guard to observe Reynier&#x27;s withdrawal while he and Sidney Smith discussed future actions. On 6 July, they decided to move south and pick off Reynier&#x27;s garrisons. That day, a half-battalion of the Polish-Italian Legion in the town of Vibo Valentia (Monteleone di Calabria) surrendered to Stuart. On 7 July, three more companies of Poles laid down their arms in Tropea when summoned by Captain Edward Fellowes in the frigate . Reggio Calabria surrendered on 9 July to Brigadier General Broderick with 1,200 British and Neapolitan troops. The allies were transported from Sicily in the frigate under Captain William Hoste. On this occasion, 632 soldiers from the 1st Light and 42nd Line Infantry Regiments were captured.
Marching south, Stuart reached Reggio on 23 July. Before returning to Sicily, he and Smith mopped up all of Reynier&#x27;s garrisons in southern Calabria. On 24 July, the fortress of Scilla and 281 soldiers of the 23rd Light Infantry surrendered to Oswald. The British had one battalion each of the 10th Foot, 21st Foot, and Chasseurs Britanniques. The 3rd battalion of the Polish-Italian Legion, 500 strong, surrendered to Captain Hoste in the &quot;Amphion&quot; and the 78th Foot at Crotone on 28 July. Stuart received the Order of the Bath and an annuity of £1,000 a year from the British crown, and the title &quot;Count of Maida&quot; from King Ferdinand, for the victory.

The allies suffered a major setback on 18 July when the long Siege of Gaeta ended. After the French siege artillery breached Gaeta&#x27;s walls, the Neapolitan garrison capitulated. By marching south, Stuart and Smith missed a chance to intervene in the siege or to land at Naples and attempt to overthrow Joseph&#x27;s government. The surrender freed Masséna&#x27;s force for operations in Calabria. In Stuart&#x27;s defence, his expedition had successfully accomplished its main objective, which was to prevent any early invasion of Sicily. He also lengthened the revolt, which the French would not bring under control until 1807.

The political situation in southern Italy would remain unchanged until 1815, with the British and Sicilian troops guarding the Bourbon King Ferdinand in Sicily and the Napoleonic King of Naples controlling the mainland. The British failed to use their naval superiority around Italy and did little to harass the French on the mainland. In 1808, Joachim Murat became the King of Naples after Joseph Bonaparte was sent to govern Spain. Murat made various attempts to cross the Strait of Sicily, which all ended in failure, despite once managing to secure a foothold in Sicily. It was not until Austria defeated Murat in the Neapolitan War in 1815, that King Ferdinand was finally restored to the Neapolitan throne.

===Legacy===
Maida Hill and the suburbs of Maida Vale in London and Maida Vale in Perth, Western Australia, are all named after this battle.

The Royal Navy named the recently (in 1806) captured &quot;Jupiter&quot; HMS &quot;Maida&quot;.

==Orders of battle==
==Historical reanalysis==
It was traditionally (but wrongly) thought that in the Battle of Maida the British deployed in a line while the French attacked in columns, allowing the British to fire full strength volleys into the French columns, while only the first two ranks of the French could fire, similar to Crossing the T in naval combat. However, modern historians dispute this claim. The military historian James R. Arnold argues:

:&quot;The writings of Sir Charles Oman and Sir John Fortescue dominated subsequent English-language Napoleonic history. Their views [that the French infantry used heavy columns to attack lines of infantry] became very much the received wisdom. ... By 1998 a new paradigm seemed to have set in with the publication of two books devoted to Napoleonic battle tactics. Both claimed that the French fought in line at Maida and both fully explored French tactical variety. The 2002 publication of &quot;The Battle of Maida 1806: Fifteen Minutes of Glory&quot;, appeared to have brought the issue of column versus line to a satisfactory conclusion: &quot;The contemporary sources are...the best evidence and their conclusion is clear: General Compère&#x27;s brigade formed into line to attack Kempt&#x27;s Light Battalion.&quot; The decisive action at Maida took place in less than fifteen minutes. It had taken 72 years to rectify a great historian&#x27;s error about what transpired during those minutes.&quot;

The British fired volleys then charged with the bayonet, and the French, failing to withstand the onslaught, broke and fled, suffering heavily in the rout.

Arnold was cruel, if not incompetent, in his criticism. The military historian Charles Oman said in his 1913 book:

<text>The Battle of Rafa, also known as the Action of Rafah, fought on 9 January 1917, was the third and final battle to complete the recapture of the Sinai Peninsula by British forces during the Sinai and Palestine campaign of the First World War. The Desert Column of the Egyptian Expeditionary Force (EEF) attacked an entrenched Ottoman Army garrison at El Magruntein to the south of Rafah, close to the frontier between the Sultanate of Egypt and the Ottoman Empire, to the north and east of Sheikh Zowaiid. The attack marked the beginning of fighting in the Ottoman territory of Palestine.

After the British Empire victories at the Battle of Romani in August 1916 and the Battle of Magdhaba in December, the Ottoman Army had been forced back to the southern edge of Palestine as the EEF pushed eastwards supported by extended lines of communication. This advance depended on the construction of a railway and a water pipeline. With the railway reaching El Arish on 4 January 1917, an attack on Rafa by the newly-formed Desert Column became possible. During the day-long assault, the Ottoman garrison defended El Magruntein&#x27;s series of fortified redoubts and trenches on rising ground surrounded by flat grassland. They were eventually encircled by Australian Light Horsemen, New Zealand mounted riflemen, mounted yeomanry, cameliers and armoured cars. In the late afternoon, the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade captured the central redoubt and the remaining defences were occupied shortly afterwards.

==Background==

Following their victory at the Battle of Romani on 4 August 1916, the ANZAC Mounted Division with the 5th Mounted Brigade attached and infantry in support, went onto the offensive. Their advance depended on the construction of a railway and a water pipeline. With the railhead about away, on 23 December 1916, the ANZAC Mounted Division, less the 2nd Light Horse Brigade but with the Imperial Camel Corps Brigade attached, occupied El Arish during day-long fighting at the Battle of Magdhaba. Meanwhile, the 52nd (Lowland) Division, having marched from Romani, established a garrison at El Arish and began to fortify the town on the Mediterranean Sea, from the railhead.

El Arish was by road from the nearest British base, at Kantara, on the Suez Canal, initially making resupply difficult. The arrival of the Royal Navy on 22 December, quickly followed by the first stores on 24 December, meant that during the next fortnight the important Egyptian Expeditionary Force (EEF) forward base grew quickly as 1,500 tons of supplies arrived by ship. Supplies of all kinds were unloaded by the Egyptian Labour Corps and distributed by the Egyptian Camel Transport Corps. Vitally important, the supply activities at El Arish were protected by the infantry garrison and ground-based artillery, supported by the navy. On 4 January 1917, the first construction train arrived at El Arish, but it was some time before the railway, with its vast capacity to support the development of infrastructure and the supply of large garrisons, was fully developed.
General Sir Archibald Murray, the commander of the EEF, was keen to complete the advance across the north of the Sinai, to put pressure on the southern Ottoman army. Believing an attack would compel Ottoman forces to abandon their desert bases and outposts on the Egyptian Sinai Peninsula, he ordered an advance from El Arish to Rafa, a distance of , to begin as soon as possible.

==Prelude==

On 28 December, Major General Harry Chauvel, commander of the ANZAC Mounted Division, ordered the 1st Light Horse Brigade to reconnoitre Bir el Burj, along the road from El Arish towards Rafa. The road was found to be suitable for cars and artillery, and a further reconnaissance by the same brigade two days later to Sheikh Zowaiid, from El Arish, reported rolling stretches of pasture, crops and poppies. A small advance guard moved further, to within sight of the main Ottoman defences at El Magruntein, reporting &quot;great activity&quot; in the area.

The weather cleared on 5 January, allowing a patrol from No. 1 Squadron, Australian Flying Corps (AFC), to observe 2,000 to 3,000 Ottoman soldiers digging defences south of Rafa in the area of El Magruntein. Two days later, British air patrols found Ottoman garrisons in strength at El Kossaima and Hafir el Auja in central northern Sinai, which could threaten the right flank of the advancing EEF or reinforce Rafa. While the British air patrols were absent on 7 January, German airmen took advantage of the growing concentration of EEF formations and supply dumps, bombing El Arish during the morning and evening. The next day the patrols from No. 1 Squadron AFC were in the air all day, covering preparations for the attack on Rafa.

Lieutenant General Philip Chetwode, commanding the Desert Column, rode out of El Arish at 16:00 on 8 January towards Rafa where a 2,000-strong Ottoman garrison was based. Chetwode&#x27;s mounted force was the same one that Chauvel had commanded during the Battle of Magdhaba in December, with the addition of the 5th Mounted Brigade (which had been garrisoning El Arish) and the 7th Light Car Patrol consisting of four gun cars and three stores cars. Risking an aerial attack during daylight hours, the force began the journey before sunset to ensure there was enough time for the force to reach El Magruntein. For the first few miles they trekked over heavy sand dunes, which were difficult to negotiate for the doubled teams of horses pulling the guns and ammunition wagons. Once the great shallow trough, worn down by traffic since ancient times, along the Old Road or Pilgrims&#x27; Way appeared, the guns and ammunition wagons travelled on the firm middle way while the mounted units rode on either side. The vanguard of the column reached Sheikh Zowaiid at about 22:00; the Desert Column bivouacked near the crossroads to the west of the village. Here the first grass the horses had seen since leaving Australia was found on the edge of the fertile maritime plain, north of El Arish.

The plan for the attack at Rafa the next morning, 9 January, was a repetition of Chauvel&#x27;s successful encirclement attack at Magdhaba. The regiments and motor cars would surround the Ottoman garrison position, gallop up under fire, then dismount to attack the defenders in their treble system of trenches and field-works around the earthwork redoubts on the knoll.

===Attack force===
The mounted units of the Desert Column involved in the attack under Chetwode&#x27;s command were:
* ANZAC Mounted Division, commanded by Chauvel, composed of the 1st and 3rd light horse brigades, the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade, and the Inverness-shire, Leicestershire and Somerset Royal Horse Artillery territorial batteries
* 1st, 2nd and 3rd battalions Imperial Camel Corps Brigade with the Hong Kong and Singapore Mountain Battery
* 5th Mounted Brigade with B Battery, Honourable Artillery Company (HAC) (18-pounders)
* 7th Light Car Patrol consisting of six Ford light armoured motorcars (LAMs) equipped with machine-guns

No. 1 Squadron AFC, which had been based at Mustabig during the El Arish and Magdhaba operations, moved forward west of El Arish to support the attack.

===Ottoman defenders===
Rafa was defended by the Ottoman 31st Infantry Regiment (3rd Division), supported by one mountain gun battery. British aerial reconnaissance had reported this force was between 2,000 and 3,000 strong. They were well entrenched in four main positions on the high ground about Hill 255, known as El Magruntein. Their central redoubt, rising about to dominate the surrounding grassland, was supported by three systems of redoubts which the British called A, B and C. These redoubts were linked and supported by trenches on the slopes spreading out to the south-east, south and south-west. These strong, well prepared and sited redoubts and trenches provided all-round defence, with a clear view of the battlefield devoid of cover for some . The only weakness was to the rear of the position, in the north-east.

==Battle==
The Desert Column began the final approach to attack Rafa on 9 January 1917, without any reserve ammunition for the artillery, rifles or machine-guns. The column&#x27;s commander, Chetwode, had ordered all wheeled vehicles, excepting the guns, to remain at Sheikh Zowaiid. His brigadiers complied with the order, but only under protest. It had been the intention of Desert Column headquarters that the reserve ammunition would be sent onward after daylight, but during the battle the system broke down and this did not occur, resulting in a critical failure of the ammunition supply. In many cases, supplies were rushed forward, but failed to reach the units requiring them on the firing line.
At 01:00 the 1st Light Horse and the New Zealand Mounted Rifles brigades led the Desert Column. Half a mile (0.80 km) from Sheikh Zowaiid, they encountered a hostile Bedouin camel patrol which was captured. At 06:15 the Auckland Mounted Rifle Regiment (New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade) was first to reach the boundary pillars, crossing the Egyptian-Ottoman frontier. These two brigades rode to a position from which to attack the Rafa defences, from the south, east and north. They were followed at 02:30 by the remainder of the ANZAC Mounted Division, part of the 5th Mounted Brigade, the Imperial Camel Brigade, and six Ford motor cars of the 7th Light Car Patrol. Two troops of the Queen&#x27;s Own Worcestershire Hussars (5th Mounted Brigade) remained at Sheikh Zowaiid to protect the ammunition column, while a squadron followed the caravan road towards Rafa.

By 06:45 the ANZAC Mounted Division headquarters was established west of Karm Ibn Musleh on the frontier to the south of Rafa and El Magruntein. The 1st and 3rd light horse brigades and the artillery took up positions to the south to guard against the Ottoman garrison retreating to the south-east, with the Imperial Camel Corps Brigade located three-quarters of a mile (1.21 km) to the west. The New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade was about to the north with the 5th Mounted Brigade forming the Desert Column&#x27;s reserve. By 07:00 a patrol of the Wellington Mounted Rifles had cut the telegraph line running east from Rafa towards Shellal and Gaza, isolating the Rafa garrison, Chauvel had reconnoitred the El Magruntein defences and the British Empire horse artillery batteries had begun firing on the redoubts at El Magruntein.

Just after 08:00 the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade circled northwards, moving into position for their attacks on the C4 and C5 groups of redoubts and trenches, while the 1st Light Horse Brigade moved into position to attack the C3, C2 and C1 groups. After these objectives were captured, the two brigades were to attack the central redoubt. Meanwhile, three battalions of the Imperial Camel Brigade were ordered to attack the D group of fortifications. The 3rd Light Horse Brigade formed the ANZAC Mounted Division&#x27;s reserve. In preparation for the attack, the divisional artillery had pre-selected targets and at 09:30 the Leicestershire, Inverness-shire and Somerset batteries of the Royal Horse Artillery and B Battery, Honourable Artillery Company began a 30-minute preparatory barrage. Under cover of this, the attacking troops began their advance, and by 09:45 they had approached to within of the Ottoman entrenchments.

===Attack begins===

As the 1st Light Horse Brigade advanced from the direction of El Gubba, westward towards El Magruntein and the &quot;C&quot; group of redoubts, they encountered heavy machine-gun and shrapnel fire from German and Ottoman guns. To the south, the Imperial Camel Brigade advanced towards the B4 redoubt, and at 10:30 the 5th Mounted Brigade was ordered &quot;to demonstrate against the works further west.&quot; When they arrived at a plateau from El Magruntein, the Warwickshire Yeomanry on the right was ordered to attack the B1 and B2 redoubts, while the Royal Gloucestershire Hussars were &quot;sent to the left along the edge of the sand-dunes&quot; to attack the right of the A1 redoubt, the most westerly of the defences. The troops dismounted to begin their attack from their objectives, but were immediately engaged by heavy machine-gun fire and shrapnel from two guns.

By 10:00 the attack from the north, led by the Auckland Mounted Rifles and supported by two machine-guns, with the Canterbury Mounted Rifles Regiment on their right, had ridden into Rafa as they circled around El Magruntein. Here, they quickly captured the village along with six German and two Ottoman officers, 16 other ranks and 21 Bedouins. Two troops were sent to watch for the approach of Ottoman reinforcements; one troop to the north towards Khan Yunis and one to the east towards Shellal.

With the Ottoman garrison defending El Magruntein cut off from the north and east by the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade, orders were issued for all Desert Column reserves to be committed and the attack &quot;pressed home.&quot; By 11:00 the attacking force was deployed from right to left: the Canterbury and Auckland mounted rifles regiments, two squadrons of the 1st Light Horse Regiment, one squadron of the 2nd Light Horse Regiment, the 3rd Light Horse Regiment (1st Light Horse Brigade), the 10th Light Horse Regiment (3rd Light Horse Brigade), the 1st Battalion Imperial Camel Corps Brigade and the &quot;Warwick and Gloucester Yeomanry&quot;. They were supported by the Inverness-shire Battery covering the New Zealanders, the Leicestershire and Somerset batteries covering the Australians and the Hong Kong Battery covering the Camel Corps battalion, while the HAC battery shelled the &quot;C&quot; group of redoubts from a distance of three-quarters of a mile (1.21 km).

Brigadier General Edward Chaytor, commanding the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade, moved his headquarters up to the boundary post south-east of Rafa, immediately behind the Auckland Mounted Rifles. Half an hour later, the attack was seen to be steadily progressing all along the line. By 12:15 the Wellington Mounted Rifles Regiment had come up to the front line, between the Canterburys on the right, and the Aucklanders on the left, within of El Magruntein, while the 2nd Battalion of the Camel Brigade advanced to extend the line held by their 1st Battalion. Shortly afterwards, the Canterbury Mounted Rifles Regiment linked up with the left of the 5th Mounted Brigade, completing the cordon around the Ottoman Army entrenchments. To the left of the 5th Mounted Brigade, the 7th Light Car Patrol reached the Rafa road, where they found cover from which to direct fire on to the A1 and A2 redoubts away. Meanwhile, the batteries had pushed forward about from their previous positions and &quot;B&quot; Battery HAC stopped firing on the &quot;C&quot; group of redoubts. Switching targets to the A1 and A2 redoubts, it recommenced firing at a range of in support of the 5th Mounted Brigade.

===Ammunition shortages===

Despite the initial assault, the Ottoman defenders continued to hold very strong defensive positions, with each redoubt ideally placed to provide supporting fire for others. In most places the dismounted attackers were badly exposed to this fire. A constant stream of fire was maintained on the Ottoman parapets to suppress the defenders and prevent them from taking aim while the attack continued. Little by little the cordon drew tighter under intense fire over the bare, gently-sloping grasslands. However, between about 12:15 and 14:15 progress slowed.

By early to mid-afternoon supplies of ammunition began to run low. Although Chauvel called for further effort, the mistake of leaving the ammunition vehicles behind proved costly, as the attack wavered. The New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade ran out of ammunition for four of its machine-guns and the Inverness-shire Battery ran out of shells and had to withdraw.

At 14:30 Chauvel ordered a fresh effort against the C group of redoubts to begin at 15:30, while a sustained artillery barrage was to continue on these redoubts until then. However, 15 minutes later, an Ottoman machine-gun officer and three German soldiers, captured by the troop of the Wellington Mounted Rifles Regiment keeping watch towards Shellal, stated that their 160th Regiment had left Shellal on the Wadi Ghuzzeh when the attack had begun, to reinforce the Rafa garrison. Shellal was between or about three and a half hours away. This was confirmed when two battalions were seen advancing in artillery formation, over the ridges west of Shellal towards Rafa. An additional 500 soldiers were seen approaching Rafa from the direction of Khan Yunus by the same mounted rifle regiment&#x27;s northern guard.

===Final assaults===
The general assault, launched at 15:30, was supported by all available guns. It made slow progress against the stubborn Ottoman defenders, who were supported by bombing from German planes, while the advance guard of Ottoman reinforcements, from Khan Yunus in the north and Shellal in the east, were attacking the two troops of the Wellington Mounted Rifles Regiment. Four guns of the Canterbury Mounted Rifles Regiment, on the right flank, were moved to a trench before being moved forward to the sunken road. From there they maintained effective overhead covering fire, until the assaulting troops were within a few yards of the trenches. These guns were also well-positioned to provide cover if pressure by the Ottoman reinforcements from Khan Yunus and Shellal proved too strong for the two troops of Wellingtons, or if the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade was forced to retire to the coast.

After steady, methodical and persistent work, by 16:00 a cloud of smoke hung over the central redoubt from rifle and machine-gun fire. The covering fire was so effective that the Ottoman defenders had extreme difficulty aiming and firing their rifles and machine-guns. It then became possible for the attacking forces to cover the last of smooth grassy slope in two rushes. At about 16:30, the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade launched its final assault on the central redoubt from the north-west, the north and the north-east. Lacking artillery support, they made determined use of machine-guns on the firing line, crossing fire to get better targets, and co-operating with the machine-guns of the 1st Light Horse Brigade to cover the advance to within of the main Ottoman position. They captured the central redoubt in a final bayonet charge, at the run, many of the soldiers firing as they went. From their captured position in the dominating central redoubt, they were able to enfilade other redoubts still held by Ottoman defenders.

With the New Zealanders holding the dominant redoubt, the 1st and the 3rd light horse brigades were able to advance and capture the remaining redoubts on their fronts. As the 3rd Battalion of the Imperial Camel Brigade approached the B group of trenches, a white flag appeared, and the B2 and the central work of B group were occupied by 16:50. They captured five officers and 214 other ranks while the Warwickshire Yeomanry captured the B1 redoubt and another 101 prisoners. These successful attacks were supported by aircraft, which bombed the redoubts and trenches. The aircraft had recently been fitted with wirelesses, and during the afternoon reported the progress of the battle to the Desert Column&#x27;s headquarters, assisting in command and control. The New Zealanders remained close to the main redoubt system while prisoners were collected and sent to Sheikh Zowaiid and the four captured guns taken away. Chetwode reported to the commander of Eastern Force, Lieutenant General Charles Macpherson Dobell, that the work of all troops engaged had been excellent, and the part played by the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade had been outstanding.

===Casualties===

During the fighting the Desert Column suffered three times the losses endured at Magdhaba. The 487 casualties included 124 New Zealanders: 71 killed, 415 wounded and one missing. Against this, the mainly Ottoman prisoners, which included some German machine-gunners, totalled between 1,472 and 1,635, with 162 of them wounded. About 200 Ottoman soldiers were killed on the battlefield.

==Aftermath==

Following the battle, a strong rearguard position manned by two light horse regiments, commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Leslie Cecil Maygar, was established. Meanwhile, the bulk of the Desert Column returned to Sheikh Zowaiid for water and rations, arriving at about midnight. The two light horse regiments that had remained at Rafa stood guard, while the battlefield was cleared by the light horse field ambulances, whose stretcher bearers worked into the night. The 3rd Light Horse Field Ambulance, covered by the 8th Light Horse Regiment (3rd Light Horse Brigade), remained on the battlefield, as all available ambulance carts and empty wagons were sent up from Sheikh Zowaiid to help transport the wounded to hospital.

The ANZAC Mounted Division&#x27;s field ambulance units had been reorganised before the battle, and were equipped with 10 pairs of litters, 15 pairs of cacolets, 12 sand-carts, 12 cycle stretchers and six sledges. With this, they were able transport 92 patients at a time, and they set about the task of evacuating the wounded. The following morning, the 8th Light Horse Regiment was attacked by Ottoman cavalry and camel units. After a period of fighting, the attackers were forced to withdraw, leaving 14 prisoners behind. The whole of the 3rd Light Horse Brigade returned to the battlefield on 10 January with the 7th Light Car Patrol and wagons to collect captured material.

=== El Arish bombed ===
During the night of 19 January, with the benefit of a full moon, German and Ottoman aircraft carried out the biggest aerial bombing raid yet, inflicted on the EEF&#x27;s fast-growing and important forward base of El Arish. As well as dropping bombs, these aircraft, probably the powerful new Albatros D.IIIs, swooped down, firing their machine-guns into the camp. Casualties, particularly in the horse lines which were an obvious target from the air, were considerable.

===Murray&#x27;s plans===
The campaign across the Sinai desert, which had begun in August, ended with the expulsion of the Ottoman Empire from Egyptian territory. With the British victory at Rafa, the steady progress of the railway and the water pipeline, and the build-up of supplies at El Arish, the EEF was able to build a firm base from which it planned to advance into Ottoman territory. To do so, they needed to capture Gaza first and subsequently the First Battle of Gaza took place in March 1917.

On 19 January, British aerial reconnaissance found the Ottoman Army had evacuated El Kossaima and reduced the strength of their main desert base at Hafir el Auja. However, GHQ believed the Ottoman garrisons would continue to hold onto the Nekhl area in the centre of the Sinai Peninsula, including the villages of Bir el Hassana, Gebel Helal, Gebel Yelleg and Gebel el Heitan, to maintain control over the Arab population. To address the problem of Ottoman Army units in the rear of the advancing EEF, a raid was carried out by two columns of light horse and yeomanry at Nekhl. The two columns moved out from Serapeum, near Ismailia on the Suez Canal, with three aircraft in support to carry out the attack, to the east. However, as the columns were approaching the area on 17 February, the reconnaissance aircraft found the Ottoman garrisons had retired, and no fighting occurred.

<text>The Mars Surveyor 2001 project was a multi-part Mars exploration mission intended as a follow-up to Mars Surveyor &#x27;98. After the two probes of the 1998 project, Mars Climate Orbiter and Mars Polar Lander, were both lost, NASA&#x27;s &quot;better, faster, cheaper&quot; exploration philosophy was re-evaluated, with a particular eye on the two 2001 project probes. As a result, the mission, along with the launch of its lander and rover, were canceled in May 2000, but the decision was made to continue development with its orbiter counterpart. The orbiter launched as &quot;2001 Mars Odyssey&quot; in April 2001, in a mission independent of the Mars Surveyor project, and reached Mars in October 2001. After being placed in a cleanroom in 2001 and stored since, the nearly-completed lander component was eventually reused to fly the &quot;Phoenix&quot; mission, which launched in August 2007 and landed successfully on Mars in May 2008.

== Spacecraft ==
=== Orbiter ===
=== Lander ===
The 2001 Surveyor lander spacecraft was built under contract to NASA by the Lockheed Martin corporation. Except for the solar arrays, the basic lander design is identical to that of the Mars Polar Lander, which had been intended to be the first of a series of low-cost &quot;Mars Surveyor&quot; landers sent to Mars. The 2001 Surveyor lander was also intended to carry to Mars a test payload, MIP (Mars ISPP Precursor), that was to demonstrate manufacture of oxygen from the atmosphere of Mars, as well as test solar cell technologies and methods of mitigating the effect of Martian dust on the power systems. MIP&#x27;s overall external envelope is approximately 40 x 24 x 25 cm (15.7 x 9.4 x 9.8 inches), and its mass is 8.5 kg (18.7 lb). Most of the top surface was covered by various types of solar cells. MIP included five experiments :
* Mars Atmospheric Acquisition and Compression (MAAC): to selectively absorb and compress carbon dioxide from the Martian atmosphere; It might absorb ~ 4g over 1 to 3 nights, then release it on being heated.
* Oxygen Generator Subsystem (OGS): to produce propellant-grade, pure oxygen; a zirconia solid-oxide oxygen generator produces oxygen by electrolyzing at elevated temperatures (750 °C).
* Mars Array Technology Experiment (MATE): to measure the spectrum at the Mars surface and to test several advanced photovoltaic solar cells;
* Dust Accumulation and Repulsion Test (DART): to investigate the properties of dust and to test techniques (e.g. electrostatic repulsion) to mitigate the settling of dust on to solar arrays; 
* Mars Thermal Environment &amp; Radiator Characterization (MTERC): to measure the night sky temperature and to demonstrate the performance of high and low emissivity radiators

After the failure of the Mars Surveyor 98 mission, the launch of the Mars Surveyor 2001 lander was cancelled in May 2000, and the near-completed spacecraft was placed in an environmentally controlled cleanroom from 2001 by Lockheed Martin. The spacecraft was offered as government furnished property to investigators proposing missions to the Mars Scout Program, and the spacecraft was used as the lander on the &quot;Phoenix&quot; mission; it is currently on Mars in the north polar region. In addition to using the 2001 Surveyor Lander, three of the experiments flown on the &quot;Phoenix&quot; mission are instruments that were originally built for the Mars Surveyor 2001 Lander:

* the Microscopy, Electrochemistry, and Conductivity Analyzer (MECA);
* the never-used Mars Descent Imager (MARDI) camera;
* the Robotic Arm, which was modified for the &quot;Phoenix&quot; mission.

=== Rover ===
Prior to mission cancellation, cost overruns and technical problems caused the Lander design to be rescoped, and the planned large Athena rover was replaced by a small rover, named &quot;Marie Curie&quot;, that was a flight spare to the &quot;Sojourner&quot; which was a part of the Mars Pathfinder mission. (The Athena did later make it to Mars, however, with two such rovers making up the Mars Exploration Rover Mission of 2004. The second of these, MER-B &quot;Opportunity&quot;, landed at Mars Surveyor 2001 Lander&#x27;s target site, Meridiani Planum.)

<doc id="458214" wikidata="Q73961" url="?curid=458214" title="Johann Gerhard Oncken">
<text>Johann Gerhard Oncken (26 January 1800 - 2 January 1884) was a pioneer German Baptist preacher, variously referred to as the &quot;Father of Continental Baptists&quot;, the &quot;Father of German Baptists&quot; and the &quot;Apostle of European Baptists&quot;. Oncken, Gottfried Wilhelm Lehmann (1799–1882), and Julius Köbner (1806–1884) were known as the Baptist cloverleaf (). J. G. Oncken helped direct and guide the growth of Baptists throughout Germany and across much of Europe for half a century.

==Early life==
Johann Gerhard Oncken was born in Varel, a town in the Duchy of Oldenburg. His father was exiled for political reasons, his mother died, and his grandmother raised him. As a child, Oncken was baptized a Lutheran, and confirmed in 1814.

About that time, Oncken was apprenticed to a Scottish merchant. Oncken moved to Scotland and worked in the merchant&#x27;s business, later working as a tutor in Leith (now part of Edinburgh) and subsequently moving to London.

In Scotland Oncken first attended the &quot;Kirk&quot; (Church of Scotland), whilst also reading the writings of Anglican James Hervey. When he moved to London he attended worship in an Independent church (Congregationalist). He was converted at Great Queen Street Methodist Chapel in London in 1820.

By 1823 Oncken had returned to Germany as an agent of the British &quot;Continental society for the Diffusion of Religious Knowledge over the Continent of Europe&quot;. At the time, he was a member of the &quot;English Reformed Church&quot; under the care of T. W. Matthews. The first Sunday School in Germany was formed in 1825, through the work of Oncken and a Reverend Rautenberg. In 1828, Oncken received an appointment from the Edinburgh Bible Society. He spent over half a century distributing tracts and Bibles, and in 1879 he estimated he had given out over two million Bibles.

==Family==
Oncken married Sarah Mann of London on 19 May 1828. He and Sarah had seven children. She died in 1845, leaving five surviving children. In 1847, Oncken married a widow from Yorkshire named Ann Dogshun. Both Oncken&#x27;s children and the Hamburg congregation fully accepted her. Ann died in 1873. She and Oncken had no children. In 1875, Oncken married Jane Clark. Jane was a member of Spurgeon&#x27;s Tabernacle in London.

==Adoption of Baptist views==
Though Oncken lived in Scotland and was converted in London, there is no existing evidence of any contact with the English Baptists. The evangelical Christianity of Scotland was influenced by the Haldane brothers, and it is known that at least later Oncken made contact with them. Oncken apparently arrived at a Baptist position on believer&#x27;s baptism (and baptism by immersion) by degrees through personal Bible study. By 1829, though still a member of a church that taught infant baptism, he appears to have decided against it, for in that year he refused to present his child for the ceremony. He discussed the baptism issue with T. W. Matthews (his pastor), C. F. Lange (one of his first converts) and others. Matthews became convinced that he should be baptized by immersion, resigned from his church and traveled to England to be baptized. In 1829, Oncken corresponded with James Haldane of Scotland. Haldane recommended that Oncken baptize himself, as John Smyth had done. Oncken thought this was without Biblical authority, and said of Haldane&#x27;s advice, &quot;Even great men are able to err.&quot; Oncken also corresponded with Joseph Ivimey. Ivimey invited him to come to London and receive believer&#x27;s baptism.

Oncken had also told his story to Calvin Tubbs, a sea captain. Tubbs told Oncken&#x27;s story to the (American Baptist) Triennial Convention. In 1833, Barnas Sears, a professor at Hamilton College, visited Germany for studies. Having heard the story, he made it a point to find and speak to Oncken. By 1834, Oncken had made a final decision. Sears traveled from Halle, where he was studying, to Hamburg, and baptized Oncken, his wife and five others in the Elbe on 22 April. The baptism was performed at night. The next day, Sears founded the first Baptist church in Hamburg. The church quickly grew to 68 members by 1836, but after that year persecution temporarily halted its growth. Though the Baptists initially engaged in performing baptisms at night, in 1837 Oncken began to baptize openly. That year, he baptized fellow German Baptist pioneer Gottfried Wilhelm Lehmann on Pentecost Sunday. German authorities shared the traditional Christian opposition to rebaptism; they also felt that people being dipped in the river was an offence to public morals. The civil authorities gave them peace for a while after the Hamburg fire of 1842, due to the help the Baptists gave to the people of the city. 

In 1848, Oncken was involved in founding , the first Baptist paper published regularly in Europe. In 1849, he began to hold organized classes with his students, and in 1880 a four-year seminary was established in Hamburg. He was also influential in the German Baptist confession of faith issued in 1847, and the organization of the &quot;Union of Baptist Congregations&quot; in 1849.

Oncken also played a role in the conversion of Anders Wiberg, a key figure in the early Swedish Baptist movement, who came to agree with Baptist teachings regarding baptism after a visit with him.

==Relations with Mennonites==
While in Hamburg, Oncken became acquainted with Jacob Gysbert van der Smissen, a Mennonite deacon. Oncken visited Mennonite churches in Poland in 1833, preaching in the area for about six weeks. Under the encouragement of Abraham Unger, Oncken visited the Mennonite Brethren Church in the Chortitza colony in 1869, assisting in the ordinations of Abraham Unger as elder, Aaron Lepp as minister, and Benjamin Nickel and Cornelius Unger as deacons. After he left, Oncken continued to correspond with the group. A problem arose between Oncken and the Mennonite Brethren when the church banned tobacco use and excommunicated several members who used it. Oncken used tobacco and did not agree with the church action in this case.

==Last years==
By 1878, Oncken was growing physically weaker daily. In physical weakness and suffering, he drew comfort from knowing &quot;that Christ, having loved him, loved him to the end.&quot; He resigned as agent for the various tract and Bible societies that he was serving, but continued to pastor. The Scottish Bible Society gave him a pension. Late in 1879, Oncken suffered a stroke. His physical condition compelled him to retire in 1881. He moved to Zürich where he died peacefully on 2 January 1884. He told his family that his name &quot;was inscribed in Heaven&#x27;s roll, and that his hope was sure.&quot; His body was taken to Hamburg for interment. Köbner preached the funeral sermon from Psalm 73:24, &quot;Thou shalt guide me with Thy counsel, and afterwards receive me to glory.&quot; J. G. Oncken was then buried in the Reformed Church Cemetery in Hamburg. Two verses of Scripture were placed on his grave: &quot;One Lord, one faith, one baptism&quot; (Ephesians 4:5), and &quot;And they continued steadfastly in the apostles&#x27; doctrine and fellowship, and in breaking of bread and in prayers&quot; (Acts 2:42).

==Summary==
J. G. Oncken was truly an &quot;international&quot; man—converted in England, baptized by an American in Germany, he traveled across the European continent to preach the gospel and give out Bibles. He conducted &quot;preaching tours&quot; in the Balkans, France, Hungary, Prussia, Russia, and Switzerland, as well as visiting Britain and the United States. He was born a Lutheran, was converted at a Methodist meeting, adopted Baptist views and possessed a relationship with the Mennonites. During his ministry as a Baptist preacher, J. G. Oncken constituted over 280 Baptist churches and 1222 preaching stations. He founded over 170 churches in Scandinavia and the Slavic states. He also formed 771 Sunday Schools in Germany. His ministry even extended indirectly to places such as Australia. Several of the German Baptist settlers in Australia, influenced by Oncken and following in his footsteps, were active in sharing the Gospel with their fellow countrymen, thereby establishing the Baptist work among German immigrants. One such German Baptist minister in Australia was Hermann Windolf who in his memoirs records coming to Australia in 1878 but before doing so called on Oncken at his home in Hamburg.

Oncken&#x27;s theology can be described as conservative, Calvinistic, and evangelistic. He favored ministerial education, but not at the expense of spiritual preparation. He held spiritual gifts as a priority over academic preparation. His zealous methods of preaching and evangelism laid the foundation and set the example for many years to come. His work continues to leave a mark on the Baptists of Germany and Europe.

<text>Carole Penny Marshall (October 15, 1943 – December 17, 2018) was an American actress, film director, and producer. She is best known for her role as Laverne DeFazio on the television sitcom &quot;Laverne &amp; Shirley&quot; (1976–1983), receiving three nominations for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Television Series Musical or Comedy for her portrayal.

Marshall made her directorial debut with &quot;Jumpin&#x27; Jack Flash&quot; (1986) before directing &quot;Big&quot; (1988), which became the first film directed by a woman to gross more than $100 million at the U.S. box office. Her subsequent directing credits included &quot;Awakenings&quot; (1990), which was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture, &quot;A League of Their Own&quot; (1992), &quot;Renaissance Man&quot; (1994), &quot;The Preacher&#x27;s Wife&quot; (1996), and &quot;Riding in Cars with Boys&quot; (2001). She also produced &quot;Cinderella Man&quot; and &quot;Bewitched&quot; (both 2005), and directed episodes of the television series &quot;According to Jim&quot; and &quot;United States of Tara&quot;.

==Early life==
Carole Penny Marshall was born in Manhattan on October 15, 1943, to Marjorie Irene (née Ward), a tap dance teacher who ran the Marjorie Marshall Dance School, and Anthony W. Marshall (né Masciarelli), a director of industrial films and later a producer. She had a brother, actor/director/TV producer Garry Marshall; and a sister, television producer Ronny Hallin. Penny&#x27;s birth name, Carole, was selected because her mother&#x27;s favorite actress was Carole Lombard. Her middle name was selected because her older sister Ronny, wanting a horse, was saving pennies; their mother chose the middle name in an attempt to console Ronny.

Penny&#x27;s father was of Italian descent, his family having come from Abruzzo, and her mother was of German, English, and Scottish descent; Marshall&#x27;s father changed his surname from Masciarelli to Marshall before she was born. Religion played an odd role in the Marshall children&#x27;s lives. Garry was christened Episcopalian, Ronny was Lutheran, and Penny was confirmed in a Congregational Church, because &quot;[Mother] sent us anyplace that had a hall where she could put on a recital. If she hadn&#x27;t needed performance space, we wouldn&#x27;t have bothered.&quot;

She grew up at 3235 Grand Concourse, the Bronx, in a building which was also the childhood home of Neil Simon, Paddy Chayefsky, Calvin Klein, and Ralph Lauren. She began her career as a tap dancer at age three, and later taught tap at her mother&#x27;s dance school. She graduated from Walton High School, a public girls&#x27; high school in New York and then went to University of New Mexico for 2 years where she studied math and psychology. While at UNM, Marshall became pregnant with daughter Tracy Reiner (née Tracy Henry), and soon after married the father, Michael Henry, in 1963. The couple divorced three years later in 1966. During this period, Marshall worked various jobs to support herself, including working as a choreographer for the Albuquerque Civic Light Opera Association. In 1967, she moved to Los Angeles to join her older brother Garry, a writer whose credits at the time included TV&#x27;s &quot;The Dick Van Dyke Show&quot; (1961–1966).

==Career==

Marshall first appeared on a television commercial for Head and Shoulders beautifying shampoo. She was hired to play a girl with stringy, unattractive hair, and Farrah Fawcett was hired to play a girl with thick, bouncy hair. As the crew was lighting the set, Marshall&#x27;s stand-in wore a placard that read &quot;Homely Girl&quot; and Fawcett&#x27;s stand-in wore a placard that said &quot;Pretty Girl&quot;. Fawcett, sensing Marshall&#x27;s insecurity about her looks, crossed out &quot;Homely&quot; on the Marshall stand-in placard and wrote &quot;Plain&quot;. 

Marshall and Billie Hayes were the only actresses to audition for the role of Witchiepoo for &quot;H.R. Pufnstuf&quot;, produced by Sid and Marty Krofft. Marshall thought that she was not right for the part, and Hayes got the role.

In 1968 Marshall accepted an offer from her brother to appear in a movie he had written and was producing, a comedy called &quot;How Sweet It Is!&quot; (1968). She landed another small role in the biker film &quot;The Savage Seven&quot; (1968), as well as a guest appearance on the hit television series &quot;That Girl&quot;, starring Marlo Thomas. Marshall was considered for the role of Gloria Bunker Stivic on &quot;All in the Family,&quot; but lost the part to Sally Struthers.

In 1970, Garry Marshall became the executive producer of the television series &quot;The Odd Couple&quot;. The following year, Marshall was added to the permanent cast to play a secretary, Myrna, and held the role for four years. In Marshall&#x27;s final appearance on &quot;The Odd Couple&quot;, her character married her boyfriend, Sheldn (&quot;they left the &quot;o&quot; off the birth certificate&quot;, she explains), played by Rob Reiner, her real-life husband. The episode included Marshall&#x27;s real-life siblings, Garry and Ronny, as Myrna&#x27;s brother and sister.

While she was on &quot;The Odd Couple&quot;, Marshall played small roles in TV movies such as &quot;Evil Roy Slade&quot; (1972), starring John Astin and Mickey Rooney (and produced by brother Garry); &quot;The Crooked Hearts&quot; (1972) starring Douglas Fairbanks Jr. and Rosalind Russell, in which she played a waitress; &quot;The Couple Takes a Wife&quot;, starring Bill Bixby; and &quot;Wacky Zoo of Morgan City&quot; (1972). 

In 1974, James L. Brooks and Allan Burns cast Marshall as Janice Dreyfuss, sister-in-law to Paul Dreyfuss (played by actor Paul Sand) in the series &quot;Paul Sand in Friends and Lovers&quot;. It aired on CBS-TV Saturday nights beginning September 14, 1974. Despite good reviews and decent ratings, it was canceled mid-season. Brooks and Burns, along with studio head Grant Tinker, were so impressed with Marshall&#x27;s comedic talent that the following season, they hired Marshall and actress Mary Kay Place to play Mary Richards&#x27; new neighbors (Paula and Sally Jo) on &quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot;.

Garry Marshall, creator and then part-time writer for &quot;Happy Days&quot;, cast Marshall and Cindy Williams to guest appear on an episode of the show. The installment, titled &quot;A Date with Fonzie&quot;, aired on November 11, 1975, and introduced the characters Laverne DeFazio and Shirley Feeney (played by Marshall and Williams, respectively). In that episode, Laverne and Shirley were a pair of wisecracking brewery workers who were dates for Fonzie (Henry Winkler) and Richie (Ron Howard). The pair were such a hit with the studio audience that Garry Marshall decided to co-create and star them in a successful spinoff, &quot;Laverne &amp; Shirley&quot; (1976–1983). 

The characters of Laverne and Shirley appeared in five more episodes of &quot;Happy Days&quot;. In 1982 at the beginning of &quot;Laverne &amp; Shirley&quot;″s eighth season, Williams left the show due to her pregnancy. Marshall continued with the show, but it was canceled after that season&#x27;s final episode aired in May 1983.

In 1983, while still filming &quot;Laverne &amp; Shirley&quot;, Marshall resumed working with James L. Brooks when she guest starred on &quot;Taxi&quot; in a cameo appearance as herself. In the &quot;Taxi&quot; episode &quot;Louie Moves Uptown,&quot; Marshall is turned down for residency in a new high-rise condominium in Manhattan. The &quot;Laverne &amp; Shirley&quot; episode &quot;Lost in Spacesuits&quot; is referred to in the scene.

Marshall would again work with Brooks, who later became a co-producer for the animated series &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, when she lent her voice to Ms. Botz, a.k.a. Ms. Botzcowski, the &quot;babysitter bandit,&quot; on the first produced episode of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, making her the first official guest star to appear on the show. 

Marshall also played a cameo role as herself on the HBO series &quot;Entourage&quot;. She also made a cameo appearance alongside her brother Garry in the Disney Halloween-themed movie &quot;Hocus Pocus&quot; as husband and wife. She was reunited with her &quot;Laverne &amp; Shirley&quot; co-star, Cindy Williams, on a November 2013 episode of &quot;Sam &amp; Cat&quot;.

===Directing career===

With the encouragement of her brother, Marshall became interested in directing. While starring on &quot;Laverne and Shirley&quot;, she began her directing career with four episodes of that show. 

In 1979, she directed several episodes of the short-lived sitcom &quot;Working Stiffs&quot;, starring Michael Keaton and James Belushi. She soon moved on to theatrical films; her first film was going to be &quot;Peggy Sue Got Married&quot; (which at that point was scheduled to star Debra Winger in the leading role). Marshall and the writers of the film, however, had creative differences, and Marshall left the project, with Winger also leaving out of loyalty to Marshall.

Marshall was soon given the directorial job of the crime comedy &quot;Jumpin&#x27; Jack Flash&quot; (1986) starring Whoopi Goldberg after the original director dropped out of the project. She also gave her daughter Tracy and her brother Garry roles in the film. Marshall described her leap into directing feature films as very hard to learn, likening it to &quot;cramming four years of college into one semester.&quot; 

While on set all day, she spent her nights planning out the rest of the film, trying to get it finished on time. Marshall also added that Whoopi Goldberg would take her aside and calm her down if she was looking exhausted that day.

In 1999, Marshall&#x27;s Parkaway Productions company was transferred from Universal to Sony. Jessica Cox was hired to run the company in 2000.

Marshall directed several successful feature films from the mid-1980s onwards, including &quot;Big&quot; (1988) starring Tom Hanks (the first film directed by a woman to gross over US$100 million), &quot;Awakenings&quot; (1990) starring Robin Williams and Robert De Niro, &quot;A League of Their Own&quot; (1992) with Geena Davis, Tom Hanks, Madonna and Rosie O&#x27;Donnell, and &quot;The Preacher&#x27;s Wife&quot; (1996) starring Denzel Washington and Whitney Houston. In 1991, she was awarded the Women in Film Crystal Award.

In 1990, Jake Eberts hired her to direct &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot; (1993), but she was replaced by Rocky Morton and Annabel Jankel after Roland Joffé replaced Eberts as producer.

In 2010 and 2011, Marshall directed two episodes of the Showtime series &quot;United States of Tara&quot;. Women in Film and Video presented her with the Women of Vision Award in 2013. Marshall planned on developing a biopic on Effa Manley, but it never materialized.

==Personal life==
While at college, Marshall met Michael Henry, a football player, and left school at age twenty to marry him in 1963. They had one daughter named Tracy in 1964 (Tracy Reiner). The marriage lasted three years.

On April 10, 1971, Marshall married actor and director Rob Reiner, who later adopted Tracy. Her marriage to Reiner ended in 1981. The couple had five grandchildren.

Following her divorce from Reiner, Marshall dated actor Larry Breeding, who had made guest appearances on &quot;Laverne &amp; Shirley&quot;. Breeding was killed in a car accident in 1982. 

Marshall had a brief relationship with singer Art Garfunkel in the mid-1980s, and he credits her with helping him through his depression.

In 2010, it was reported that Marshall had been diagnosed with lung cancer that had metastasized to her brain, but two years later she was &quot;fine now&quot;. Following her recovery she published a memoir, &quot;My Mother Was Nuts.&quot;

==Death==
Marshall died in Los Angeles on December 17, 2018, at the age of 75. According to her death certificate, her death was attributed to cardiopulmonary failure, cardiac arrest, and type 1 diabetes.

Marshall was cremated and her ashes are interred at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Hollywood Hills, Los Angeles. An &#x27;L&#x27;, like those her Laverne character wore, is emblazoned at the bottom of her headstone.

==Works==
=== Central themes in Marshall&#x27;s films ===
Marshall&#x27;s films tend to address contemporary issues in society such as coming of age, women’s accomplishments, and oppression of the mentally disabled. For instance, the oppression of the mentally disabled is well elaborated in the film &quot;Awakenings&quot;. The film unites two big stars in a story about the plight of mentally disabled individuals and how a person who is not living with any life-threatening condition gets to learn a lesson about humanity after spending time with a mentally disabled person. Achievement of women has been elaborated well in the film &quot;A League of Their Own&quot;, a film that stars two blood sisters joining the women’s baseball league during World War II. In that time, many men in professional leagues joined the armed forces. The movie exposes exciting victories and personal conflicts on the field, while, at the same time, building sisterhood and strong bonds among teammates.

<text>Sprite is an experimental Unix-like distributed operating system developed at the University of California, Berkeley by John Ousterhout&#x27;s research group between 1984 and 1992. Its notable features include support for single system image on computer clusters and the introduction of the log-structured file system. The Tcl scripting language also originated in this project.

==Early work==

Early work on Sprite was based on the idea of making the operating system more &quot;network aware&quot;, and thereby at the same time make it invisible to the user. The primary area of work was the building of a new network file system which made heavy use of local client-side caching in order to improve performance. After opening the file and some initial reads, the network is only used on-demand, and most user actions occur against the cache. Similar utilities allow remote devices to be mapped into the local computer&#x27;s space, allowing for network printing and similar duties.

Many of the key Unix files are based on the network, including things like the password file. All machines in a network share the root directory as well. Other common Unix utilities such as codice_1 were re-written to make them network aware as well, listing all of the people logged on across the network. This makes a Sprite network appear as if it were a single large time-sharing system, or a single-system image.

Another key addition to Sprite is process migration, which allows programs to be moved between machines at any time. The system maintains a list of machines and their state, and automatically moves processes to idle machines to improve local performance. Processes can also be &quot;evicted&quot; from machines to improve their performance, causing the original starter to move it to another machine on the network, or take control of it locally again. Long tasks (like compiling the Sprite system) can appear very fast.

==Further development==

Work on the &quot;early&quot; Sprite outlined above ended around 1987, but was improved during the next year. Starting in 1990 Sprite was used as the basis for development of the first log-structured file system (LFS), development of which continued until about 1992. LFS dramatically increases the performance of file writes at the expense of read performance. Under Sprite, this tradeoff is particularly useful because most read access is cached anyway—that is, Sprite systems typically perform fewer reads than a normal Unix system. LFS-like systems also allow for much easier crash recovery, which became a major focus of the project during this period. Additional experimentation on striped file systems, both striped across different machines as well as clusters of drives, continued until about 1994.

==Discontinuation==

Sprite was not a microkernel system, and suffers the same sort of problems as other Unixes in terms of development complexity, becoming increasingly difficult to develop as more functionality was added. By the 1990s it was suffering and the small team supporting the project was simply not able to keep up with the rapid changes in Unix taking place during this time. The project was slowly shut down by 1994.
