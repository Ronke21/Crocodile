<text>In September 1999, a series of explosions hit four apartment blocks in the Russian cities of Buynaksk, Moscow, and Volgodonsk, killing more than 300, injuring more than 1,000, and spreading a wave of fear across the country. The bombings, together with the Invasion of Dagestan, triggered the Second Chechen War. The handling of the crisis by Vladimir Putin, who was prime minister at the time, boosted his popularity greatly and helped him attain the presidency within a few months.

The blasts hit Buynaksk on 4 September and Moscow on 9 and 13 September. Another bombing happened in Volgodonsk on 16 September. Chechen militants were blamed for the bombings, but denied responsibility, along with Chechen president Aslan Maskhadov.

A suspicious device resembling those used in the bombings was found and defused in an apartment block in the Russian city of Ryazan on 22 September. On 23 September, Vladimir Putin even praised the vigilance of the inhabitants of Ryazan and ordered the air bombing of Grozny, which marked the beginning of the Second Chechen War. Three Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) agents who had planted the devices at Ryazan were arrested by the local police. The next day, FSB director Nikolai Patrushev announced that the incident in Ryazan had been an anti-terror drill and the device found there contained only sugar, and freed the FSB agents involved.

The official investigation of the Buynaksk bombing was completed in 2001, while the investigations of the Moscow and Volgodonsk bombings were completed in 2002. In 2000, seven people were convicted of perpetrating the Buynaksk attack. According to the court ruling on the Moscow and Volgodonsk bombings, which was announced in 2004, the attacks were organized and led by Achemez Gochiyaev, who remains at large. All bombings, the court ruled, were ordered by Islamist warlords Ibn Al-Khattab and Abu Omar al-Saif, who have been killed. Five other suspects have been killed and six have been convicted by Russian courts on terrorism-related charges.

Attempts at an independent investigation faced obstruction from the Russian government. State Duma deputy Yuri Shchekochikhin filed two motions for a parliamentary investigation of the events, but the motions were rejected by the State Duma in March 2000. An independent public commission to investigate the bombings was chaired by Duma deputy Sergei Kovalev. The commission was rendered ineffective because of the government&#x27;s refusal to respond to its inquiries. Two key members of the Kovalev Commission, Sergei Yushenkov and Yuri Shchekochikhin, have since died in apparent assassinations. The commission&#x27;s lawyer and investigator Mikhail Trepashkin was arrested and served four years in prison &quot;for revealing state secrets&quot;.

Although the bombings were widely blamed on Chechen terrorists, their guilt was never conclusively proven. A number of historians and investigative journalists have instead called the bombings a false flag attack perpetrated by Russian state security services to win public support for a new war in Chechnya and to boost the popularity of Vladimir Putin prior to the upcoming presidential elections. Former FSB agent Alexander Litvinenko, who blamed the FSB for the bombings and was a critic of Putin, was assassinated in London in 2006. A British inquiry later determined that Litvinenko&#x27;s murder was &quot;probably&quot; carried out with the approval of Vladimir Putin and Nikolai Patrushev. Others argue that there is insufficient evidence to assign responsibility for the attacks.

== Preceding events ==
=== Advance warnings about the impending bombings ===
In July 1999, Russian journalist Aleksandr Zhilin, writing in the &quot;Moskovskaya Pravda&quot;, warned that there would be terrorist attacks in Moscow organised by the government. Using a leaked Kremlin document as evidence, he added that the motive would be to undermine the opponents of the Russian President Boris Yeltsin. These included Moscow mayor Yury Luzhkov and former prime minister Yevgeny Primakov. However, this warning was ignored.

According to Amy Knight, &quot;even more significant is the fact that a respected and influential Duma deputy, Konstantin Borovoi, was told on September 9, the day of the first Moscow apartment bombing, that there was to be a terrorist attack in the city. His source was an officer of the Russian military intelligence (GRU). Borovoy transmitted this information to FSB officials serving on Yeltsin&#x27;s Security Council, but he was ignored.&quot;

=== War in Dagestan ===

On 7 August 1999, an Islamist group, led by Shamil Basayev and Ibn al-Khattab, invaded the Russian republic of Dagestan. The war in Dagestan was allegedly planned in advance by the Russian government to justify starting the war in Chechnya. However, the initial plan included only a limited campaign to occupy the northern third of Chechnya up to the Terek River valley. After the apartment bombings, Putin approved a more ambitious campaign to subdue all of Chechnya.

== Bombings ==
=== Overview ===
Four apartment bombings took place and at least three attempted bombings were prevented. All bombings had the same &quot;signature&quot;, based on the nature and the volume of the destruction. In each case a powerful explosive was used, and the timers were set to go off at night and inflict the maximum number of civilian casualties. The explosives were placed to destroy the weakest, most critical elements of the buildings and force them to &quot;collapse like a house of cards&quot;. The individuals behind the bombings were able to obtain or manufacture several tons of powerful explosives and deliver them to numerous destinations across Russia.

=== Manezhnaya Square, Moscow ===
On 31 August 1999, at 20:00 local time, a bomb exploded in the amusement arcade of the Manezh Square shopping complex of Moscow. At least 29 people were injured. According to the FSB, the explosion had been caused by a bomb of about 300 grams of explosives.

On 2 September 1999, an unknown person called and claimed that the bombing was committed by the militant organization the &quot;Liberation Army of Dagestan&quot;.

=== Buynaksk, Dagestan ===
On 4 September 1999, at 22:00, a car bomb detonated outside a five-story apartment building in the city of Buynaksk in Dagestan, near the border of Chechnya. The building was housing Russian border guard soldiers and their families. Sixty-four people were killed and 133 were injured in the explosion.

On 4 September 1999, another bomb was discovered shortly after the explosion in the city of Buynaksk in Dagestan. The defused bomb was in a car containing of explosive material. It was discovered by local residents in a parking lot surrounded by an army hospital and residential buildings.

=== Moscow, Pechatniki ===

&lt;/mapframe&gt;On 9 September 1999, shortly after midnight at 20:00 GMT, a bomb detonated on the ground floor of an apartment building in southeast Moscow (19 Guryanova Street). The explosive power was equivalent to of TNT. The nine-story building was destroyed, killing 106 people inside (with early reports giving 93 dead) and injuring 249 others, and damaging 19 nearby buildings. A total of 108 apartments were destroyed during the bombing. An FSB spokesman announced that traces of RDX and TNT were found on items removed from the site of the explosion. Residents said a few minutes before the blast four men were seen speeding away from the building in a car.

The FSB declared the bombing a terrorist attack the following morning, 10 September 1999. That day, Vladimir Putin was due to fly to Auckland for the 1999 APEC summit; after a brief consultation with Boris Yeltsin, it was decided that the trip go ahead as planned. Yeltsin had originally intended to go himself, but reasoned to Bill Clinton that Putin would almost certainly be president himself by the year 2000, contrary to speculation over Yeltsin&#x27;s successor. Prior to his flight, Putin telephoned Clinton and claimed he had &quot;every reason to believe&quot; that Chechen extremists were not only behind the attacks but had links to the Al-Qaeda group which had perpetrated the bombings of the U.S. embassies in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam the previous year. Putin and Clinton would have their first face-to-face meeting in Auckland the following day, and Putin flew back shortly afterward.

Yeltsin ordered the search of 30,000 residential buildings in Moscow for explosives. He took personal control of the investigation of the blast. Putin declared 13 September a day of mourning for the victims of the attacks.

=== Moscow, Kashirskoye highway ===
On 13 September 1999, at 05:00, a large bomb exploded in a basement of an apartment block on Kashirskoye Highway in southern Moscow, about from the place of the last attack. This was the deadliest blast in the chain of bombings (because the apartment was built with brick), with 119 people killed and 200 injured. The eight-story building was flattened, littering the street with debris and throwing some concrete pieces hundreds of meters away.

=== Moscow, prevented bombings ===
On 13 September 1999, a local businessman Achemez Gochiyaev called to police and reported about bombs located in apartment blocks on Borisovskiye Prudy and Kapotnya in Moscow. The police found and defused two bombs.

Gochiyaev claimed that he was framed by his old acquaintance, an FSB officer who asked him to rent basements &quot;as storage facilities&quot; at four locations where bombs were later found. After the second explosion on Kashirskoye highway Gochiyaev realized he was set up, called the police and told them about the basements of two other buildings at Borisovskie Prudy and Kapotnya, where the explosives were actually found and explosions averted. In 2002 Felshtinsky and Litvinenko obtained a written testimony from Achemez Gochiyaev as well as a video recording and several photographs about it. The statement by Gochiyaev was also received by Prima News agency.

=== Announcement of a Volgodonsk bombing in the Russian Duma ===
On 13 September, just hours after the second explosion in Moscow, Russian Duma speaker Gennadiy Seleznyov of the Communist Party made an announcement, &quot;I have just received a report. According to information from Rostov-on-Don, an apartment building in the city of Volgodonsk was blown up last night.&quot; When the Volgodonsk bombing happened on 16 September, Vladimir Zhirinovsky questioned Seleznyov in the Duma the following day, but Seleznyov turned his microphone off. Later, Seleznyov said it was a misunderstanding, and he actually referred to an explosion organized by criminal gangs which took place in Volgodonsk on 12 September.

According to Philip Short, Seleznyov made an announcement based on a wire service message about an explosion which took place in Volgodonsk on 12 September and killed one person. At the time it was thought that this (smaller and eventually found to be unrelated) explosion was another in the same series as the preceding ones in Moscow and Buynaksk.

Alexander Litvinenko believed that someone had mixed up the order of the blasts, &quot;the usual &quot;Kontora&quot; mess up&quot;. According to Litvinenko, &quot;Moscow-2 was on the 13th and Volgodonsk on 16th, but they got it to the speaker the other way around&quot;. Investigator Mikhail Trepashkin said that the man who gave Seleznyov the note was indeed an FSB officer.

=== Volgodonsk, Rostov Oblast ===
A truck bomb exploded on 16 September 1999, outside a nine-story apartment complex in the southern Russian city of Volgodonsk, killing 17 people and injuring 69. The bombing took place at 5:57 am. Surrounding buildings were also damaged. The blast also happened from a nuclear power plant. Prime Minister Vladimir Putin signed a decree calling on law enforcement and other agencies to develop plans within three days to protect industry, transportation, communications, food processing centres and nuclear complexes.

=== Prevented bombings in Ryazan ===
At 20:30 on 22 September 1999, Alexei Kartofelnikov, a resident of an apartment building in the city of Ryazan noticed two suspicious men who carried sacks into the basement from a car. While the license plate indicated that the car was registered in Moscow, a sheet of paper was taped over the last two digits, and the number written on it implied that the car was local.

Kartofelnikov alerted the police, but by the time they arrived the car and the men were gone. The policemen found three sacks of white powder in the basement, each weighing . A detonator and a timing device were attached to the sacks. The detonator was reported by a Russian newspaper to be a 12-gauge shotgun shell filled with powder. The timer was set to 5:30 AM. Yuri Tkachenko, the head of the local bomb squad, disconnected the detonator and the timer. Reportedly, Tkachenko tested the three sacks of white substance with a &quot;MO-2&quot; gas analyser, which detected RDX vapors.

Inhabitants of the apartment building were evacuated. According to David Satter, residents of neighboring buildings fled their homes in terror, to the effect that nearly 30,000 residents spent the night on the street. Police and rescue vehicles converged from different parts of the city. As many as 1,200 local police officers were put on alert, the railroad stations and the airport were surrounded, and roadblocks were set up on highways leaving the city.

At 01:30 on 23 September 1999, explosive engineers of the Ryazan UFSB took a sample of substance from the suspicious-looking sacks to a firing ground located about away from Ryazan for testing. During the substance tests at that area they tried to explode it by means of a detonator, which was also made from a shotgun shell, but the substance failed to detonate. At 05:00, Radio Rossiya reported about the attempted bombing, noting that the bomb was set up to go off at 05:30. In the morning, Ryazan resembled a city under siege. Composite sketches of three suspected terrorists, two men and a woman, were posted everywhere in the city and shown on TV. At 08:00 Russian television reported the attempt to blow out the building in Ryazan and identified the explosive used in the bomb as RDX. Vladimir Rushailo announced later that police prevented a terrorist act. A news report at 16:00 reported that the explosives failed to detonate during their testing outside the city.&lt;ref name=&quot;politcom.ru/2002/aaa_skandal20.php&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

At 19:00, Vladimir Putin praised the vigilance of the inhabitants of Ryazan, and called for the air bombing of the Chechen capital Grozny in response to the terrorism acts. He said:
On 23 September Natalia Yukhnova, a telephone service employee in Ryazan, tapped into a suspicious phone call to Moscow and overheard the following instruction: &quot;Leave one at a time, there are patrols everywhere&quot;. The called number was traced to a telephone exchange unit serving FSB offices.

When arrested, the detainees produced FSB identification cards. They were soon released on orders from Moscow.

The position of Russian authorities on the Ryazan incident changed significantly over time. Initially, it was declared by the FSB and federal government to be a real threat. However, after the people who planted the bomb were identified, the official version changed to &quot;security training&quot;.

On 24 September, FSB director Nikolai Patrushev announced that it was an exercise that was being carried out to test responses after the earlier blasts.

The Ryazan FSB &quot;reacted with fury&quot; and issued a statement saying:
FSB also issued a public apology about the incident. In a show &quot;Independent Investigation&quot; on NTV, Evgeniy Savostyanov, former director of Moscow and Moscow Oblast regional FSB branch, has criticized the FSB for performing such exercise on residential buildings with inhabitants inside and without notifying local authorities.

In excerpts from the planned Ryazan operation, first published in 2002, it was stated that the exercise was overseen by the head of the FSB&#x27;s Center of Special Operations (CSO), Major General Alexander Tikhonov.

==== Detonator and explosives detection equipment ====
In February 2000, &quot;Novaya Gazeta&quot; journalist Pavel Voloshin published an essay entitled &quot;What happened in Ryazan: Sugar or Hexogen?&quot;, that was partly based on his two-hour long interview with Yuri Tkachenko, the police explosives expert who defused the Ryazan bomb. The essay noted that it&#x27;s well known that a gas analyser that tested the vapours coming from the sacks indicated the presence of RDX. Tkachenko said that he was completely certain that the instrument was in correct working order. The gas analyser was of world-class quality, cost $20,000, and was maintained by a specialist who worked according to a strict schedule, making frequent prophylactic checks, because the device contained a radioactive source. Meticulous care in the handling of the gas analyser was a necessity because the lives of the bomb squad experts depended on the reliability of their equipment. Speaking of the detonator, Voloshin noted that people who disarmed the device (Tkachenko and his bomb squad) claimed that the detonator attached to the sacks was not a dummy and had been prepared on a professional level. The police warrant officer who answered the original call and discovered the bomb insisted that there were no doubts it was a combat situation.

==== The case of Private Alexei Pinyaev ====
In March 2000, &quot;Novaya Gazeta&quot; journalist Pavel Voloshin reported the account of Private Alexei P. (later identified as Pinyaev) of the 137th Guards Airborne Regiment. Pinyaev guarded a storehouse with weapons and ammunition near the city of Ryazan. Together with a friend, he entered the storehouse to see the weapons. The friends were surprised to see that the storehouse contained sacks with the word &quot;sugar&quot; on them. Pinyaev and his friend were discouraged, but didn&#x27;t want to leave the storehouse empty-handed. The two paratroopers cut a hole in one of the bags and put some sugar in a plastic bag. They made tea with the sugar, but the taste of the tea was terrible. They became frightened because the substance might turn out to be saltpeter, and brought the plastic bag to a platoon commander. He consulted a sapper, who identified the substance as hexogen.

After the newspaper report, FSB officers descended on Pinyayev&#x27;s unit, accused them of divulging a state secret and told them, &quot;You guys can&#x27;t even imagine what serious business you’ve got yourselves tangled up in.&quot; The regiment later sued publishers of &quot;Novaya Gazeta&quot; for insulting the honour of the Russian Army, since there was no Private Alexei Pinyayev in the regiment, according to their statement.

A report aired by &quot;ORT&quot; in March 2000 and created by journalist Leonid Grozin and operator Dmitry Vishnevoy accused &quot;Novaya Gazeta&quot; of lying. According to Grozin and Vishnevoy, there is no storehouse at the test range of the 137th Regiment. Alexei Pinyaev has admitted meeting with Pavel Voloshin, but claimed that he was merely asked to confirm a pre-conceived story. At an FSB press conference in 2001, Private Pinyayev stated that there was no hexogen in the 137th Airborne Regiment and that he was hospitalised in December 1999 and no longer visited the test range.

===Explosives in the apartment bombings===
After the bombing at Guryanova Street on 9 September, the Moscow FSB reported that items removed from the scene showed traces of TNT and RDX (or &quot;hexogen&quot;) explosives. However, FSB has declared later that the explosives used in the bombings were a mixture of aluminium powder, ammonium nitrate, TNT and sugar prepared by the perpetrators in a concrete mixer at a fertiliser factory in Urus-Martan, Chechnya. Also, each bomb contained some plastic explosive used as an explosive booster.

RDX is produced in only one factory in Russia, in the city of Perm. According to David Satter, the FSB changed the story about the type of explosive, since it was difficult to explain how huge amounts of RDX disappeared from the closely guarded Perm facility.

===Impact on survivors===
Multiple survivors of the bombings have developed disabilities, with many of them diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder. In 2006, Irina Khalai, a survivor of the Volgodonsk bombing, founded the NGO &quot;Volga-Don&quot;, which promotes legislation for the legal recognition of victims of terrorist attacks.

== Claims and denials of responsibility for the blasts ==
On 9 September, an anonymous person, speaking with a Caucasian accent, phoned the Interfax news agency, saying that the blasts in Moscow and Buynaksk were &quot;our response to the bombings of civilians in the villages in Chechnya and Dagestan.&quot; On 15 September, an unidentified man, again speaking with a Caucasian accent, called the ITAR-TASS news agency, claiming to represent a group called the Liberation Army of Dagestan. He said that the explosions in Buynaksk and Moscow were carried out by his organisation. According to him, the attacks were a retaliation to the deaths of Muslim women and children during Russian air raids in Dagestan. &quot;We will answer death with death,&quot; the caller said. Russian officials from both the Interior Ministry and FSB, at the time, expressed scepticism over the claims and said there is no such organization. On 15 September 1999, a Dagestani official also denied the existence of a &quot;Dagestan Liberation Army&quot;.

In an interview published in Lidove Noviny on 9 September, Shamil Basayev denied responsibility for the bombings and said that it had been the work of Dagestanis. According to Basayev, the bombings were a retribution for the military operation of the Russian Army against &quot;three small villages&quot; in Dagestan. In subsequent interviews, Basayev said he did not know who perpetrated the bombings.

In a 12 September interview with Associated Press, Ibn al-Khattab said that &quot;From now on they will get our bombs everywhere! Let Russia await our explosions blasting through their cities! I swear we will do it!&quot; However, in a subsequent interview on 14 September to the Interfax agency in Grozny, Khattab denied responsibility for the bombings.

Chechen Foreign Ministry issued an official statement on 14 September condemning Moscow blasts, and affirming that &quot;Ichkeria stands firmly against terrorism in any manifestation&quot;.

In February 2000, the US Secretary of State Madeleine Albright stated they have not seen any evidence that ties the bombings to Chechnya.

== Official government investigations ==
=== Criminal investigation and court ruling ===
In 2000, investigation of the Buynaksk attack was complete and seven people were convicted of the bombing.

Russia&#x27;s pre-trial investigation of the Moscow and Volgodonsk bombings was finished in 2002. According to the Russian State Prosecutor office, all apartment bombings were executed under command of ethnic Karachay Achemez Gochiyayev and planned by Ibn al-Khattab and Abu Omar al-Saif, Arab militants fighting in Chechnya on the side of Chechen insurgents. Al-Khattab and al-Saif were killed during the Second Chechen War. According to investigators, the explosives were prepared at a fertiliser factory in Urus-Martan Chechnya, by &quot;mixing aluminium powder, nitre and sugar in a concrete mixer&quot;, or by also putting there RDX and TNT. From there they were sent to a food storage facility in Kislovodsk, which was managed by an uncle of one of the terrorists, Yusuf Krymshakhalov. Another conspirator, Ruslan Magayayev, leased a KamAZ truck in which the sacks were stored for two months. After everything was planned, the participants were organised into several groups which then transported the explosives to different cities.

According to investigators, the explosion in Moscow mall on 31 August was committed by another man, Magomed-Zagir Garzhikaev on the orders from Shamil Basayev, according to the FSB.

Court hearings on the Moscow and Volgodonsk attacks were held behind closed doors, and were completed in 2004. The process has produced 90 volumes of proceedings, five of which were classified.

==== Court rulings ====
According to the court ruling, Al-Khattab paid Gochiyayev $500,000 to carry out the attacks at Guryanova Street, Kashirskoye Highway, and Borisovskiye Prudy, and then helped to hide Gochiyayev and his accomplices in Chechnya. In early September 1999, Magayayev, Krymshamkhalov, Batchayev and Dekkushev reloaded the cargo into a Mercedes-Benz 2236 trailer and delivered it to Moscow. En route, they were protected from possible complications by an accomplice, Khakim Abayev, who accompanied the trailer in another car. In Moscow they were met by Achemez Gochiyayev, who registered in Hotel Altai under the fake name &quot;Laipanov&quot;, and Denis Saitakov. The explosives were left in a warehouse in Ulitsa Krasnodonskaya, which was leased by pseudo-Laipanov (Gochiyayev). The next day, the explosives were delivered in &quot;ZIL-5301&quot; vans to three addresses—Ulitsa Guryanova, Kashirskoye Shosse and Ulitsa Borisovskiye Prudy, where pseudo-Laipanov leased cellars. Gochiyayev supervised the placement of the bombs in the rented cellars. Next followed the explosions at the former two addresses. The explosion at 16 Borisovskiye Prudy was prevented.

According to the court, 4 September Buinaksk bombing was ordered by Al-Khattab. Reportedly, since the perpetrators have managed to explode only one truck bomb instead of the two, Khattab called it a &quot;botched job&quot; and paid $300,000 for it, which was a part of the sum he originally promised. One of the suspects confessed having loaded the trucks with sacks in Buynaksk, but claimed he did not know what they were intended for.

The explosion in the mall on Manezhnaya Square was the subject of a separate court process held in Moscow in 2009. The court accused Khalid Khuguyev () and Magumadzir Gadzhikayev () of organisation and execution of the 1999 explosions in the Manezhnaya Square mall and in hotel Intourist and sentenced them to 25 years and 15 years of imprisonment, correspondingly.

==== Sentences ====
 and have both been sentenced to life terms in a special regime colony. Both defendants have pleaded guilty only to some of the charges. Dekkushev acknowledged that he knew the explosives he transported were to be used for an act of terror. Dekkushev also confirmed Gochiyaev&#x27;s role in the attacks. Dekkushev was extradited to Russia on 14 April 2002 to stand trial. Krymshakhalov was apprehended and extradicted to Moscow. Achemez Gochiyaev, allegedly the head of the group that carried out the attacks, remains a fugitive, and is under an international search warrant.

==== Suspects and accused ====
In September 1999, hundreds of Chechen nationals (out of the more than 100,000 permanently living in Moscow) were briefly detained and interrogated in Moscow, as a wave of anti-Chechen sentiments swept the city. However, no Chechens were tried for the Buinaksk, Moscow or Volgodonsk attacks. Rather, it were Dagestani Wahhabis in the case of the Buinaksk bombing, and Karachay Wahhabis in the case of Moscow and Volgodonsk attacks.

According to the official investigation, the following people either delivered explosives, stored them, or harboured other suspects:

== Attempts at an independent investigation ==
The Russian Duma rejected two motions for a parliamentary investigation of the Ryazan incident. In the Duma a pro-Kremlin party Unity, voted to seal all materials related to the Ryazan incident for the next 75 years and forbade an investigation into what happened.

An independent public commission to investigate the bombings was chaired by Duma deputy Sergei Kovalyov. The commission started its work in February 2002. On 5 March Sergei Yushenkov and Duma member Yuli Rybakov flew to London where they met Alexander Litvinenko and Mikhail Trepashkin. After this meeting, Trepashkin began working with the commission.

However, the public commission was rendered ineffective because of government refusal to respond to its inquiries. Two key members of the commission, Sergei Yushenkov and Yuri Shchekochikhin, both Duma members, have died in apparent assassinations in April 2003 and July 2003, respectively. Another member of the commission, Otto Lacis, was assaulted in November 2003 and two years later, on 3 November 2005, he died in a hospital after a car accident.

The commission asked lawyer Mikhail Trepashkin to investigate the case. Trepashkin said he found that the basement of one of the bombed buildings was rented by FSB officer Vladimir Romanovich and that the latter was witnessed by several people. Trepashkin also investigated a letter attributed to Achemez Gochiyayev and found that the alleged assistant of Gochiyayev who arranged the delivery of sacks might have been Kapstroi-2000 vice president Alexander Karmishin, a resident of Vyazma.

Trepashkin was unable to bring the alleged evidence to the court because he was arrested in October 2003 (on charges of illegal arms possession) and imprisoned in Nizhny Tagil, just a few days before he was to make his findings public. He was sentenced by a Moscow military closed court to four years imprisonment on a charge of revealing state secrets. Amnesty International issued a statement that &quot;there are serious grounds to believe that Mikhail Trepashkin was arrested and convicted under falsified criminal charges which may be politically motivated, in order to prevent him continuing his investigative and legal work related to the 1999 apartment bombings in Moscow and other cities&quot;.

In a letter to Olga Konskaya, Trepashkin wrote that some time before the bombings, Moscow&#x27;s Regional Directorate against Organized Crimes (RUOP GUVD) arrested several people for selling the explosive RDX. Following that, Nikolai Patrushev&#x27;s Directorate of FSB officers came to the GUVD headquarters, captured evidence and ordered the investigators fired. Trepashkin wrote that he learned about the story at a meeting with several RUOP officers in the year 2000. They claimed that their colleagues could present eyewitness accounts in a court. They offered a video tape with evidence against the RDX dealers. Mr Trepashkin did not publicise the meeting fearing for lives of the witnesses and their families.

According to Trepashkin, his supervisors and the people from the FSB promised not to arrest him if he left the Kovalev commission and started working together with the FSB &quot;against Alexander Litvinenko&quot;.

On 24 March 2000, two days before the presidential elections, NTV Russia featured the Ryazan events of Fall 1999 in the talk show &quot;Independent Investigation&quot;. The talk with the residents of the Ryazan apartment building along with FSB public relations director Alexander Zdanovich and Ryazan branch head Alexander Sergeyev was filmed few days earlier. On 26 March, Boris Nemtsov voiced his concern over the possible shut-down of NTV for airing the talk. Seven months later, NTV general manager said at the JFK School of Government that Information Minister Mikhail Lesin warned him on several occasions. Malashenko&#x27;s recollection of Lesin&#x27;s warning was that by airing the talk show NTV &quot;crossed the line&quot; and that the NTV managers were &quot;outlaws&quot; in the eyes of the Kremlin. According to Alexander Goldfarb, Mr. Malashenko told him that Valentin Yumashev brought a warning from the Kremlin, one day before airing the show, promising in no uncertain terms that the NTV managers &quot;should consider themselves finished&quot; if they went ahead with the broadcast.

Artyom Borovik was among the people who investigated the bombings. He received numerous death threats and died in a suspicious plane crash in March 2000 that was regarded by Felshtinsky and Pribylovsky as a probable assassination.

Journalist Anna Politkovskaya and former security service member Alexander Litvinenko, who investigated the bombings, were killed in 2006.

Surviving victims of the Guryanova street bombing asked President Dmitry Medvedev to resume the official investigation in 2008, but it was not resumed.

In a 2017 discussion at the RFE/RL Sergei Kovalyov said: &quot;I think that the Chechen trace was skilfully fabricated. No one from the people who organized the bombings was found, and no one actually was looking for them&quot;. He then was asked by Vladimir Kara-Murza if he believes that several key members of his commission, and even Boris Berezovskiy and Boris Nemtsov who &quot;knew quite a few things about the bombings&quot; were killed to prevent the independent investigation. Kovalev responded: &quot;I cannot state with full confidence that the explosions were organized by the authorities. Although it&#x27;s clear that the explosions were useful for them, useful for future President Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin, because he had just promised to &quot;waste in the outhouse&quot; (as he said) everyone who had any relation to terrorism. It was politically beneficial for him to scare people with terrorism. That is not proven. But what can be stated with full confidence is this: the investigation of both the Moscow explosions and the so-called &quot;exercises&quot; in Ryazan is trumped up. There can be various possibilities. It seems to me, that Ryazan should have been the next explosion, but I cannot prove that.&quot;

== Alleged Russian government involvement ==
According to David Satter, Yuri Felshtinsky, Alexander Litvinenko, Vladimir Pribylovsky and Boris Kagarlitsky, the bombings were a successful false flag operation coordinated by the Russian state security services to win public support for a new full-scale war in Chechnya and to bring Putin to power. Some of them described the bombings as typical &quot;active measures&quot; practised by the KGB in the past. The war in Chechnya boosted Prime Minister and former FSB Director Vladimir Putin&#x27;s popularity, and brought the pro-war Unity Party to the State Duma and Putin to the presidency within a few months.

During the testimony of David Satter in the United States House of Representatives, he stated that:

With Yeltsin and his family facing possible criminal prosecution, however, a plan was put into motion to put in place a successor who would guarantee that Yeltsin and his family would be safe from prosecution and the criminal division of property in the country would not be subject to reexamination. For &quot;Operation Successor&quot; to succeed, however, it was necessary to have a massive provocation. In my view, this provocation was the bombing in September 1999 of the apartment building bombings in Moscow, Buinaksk, and Volgodonsk. In the aftermath of these attacks, which claimed 300 lives, a new war was launched against Chechnya. Putin, the newly appointed prime minister who was put in charge of that war, achieved overnight popularity. Yeltsin resigned early. Putin was elected president and his first act was to guarantee Yeltsin immunity from prosecution.
According to a reconstruction of the events by Felshtinsky and Pribylovsky:
* The bombings in Buynaksk were carried out by a team of twelve GRU officers who were sent to Dagestan and supervised by the head of GRU&#x27;s 14th Directorate General Nikolai Kostechko. That version was partly based on a testimony by Aleksey Galkin. The bombing in Buynaksk was conducted by the GRU to avoid an &quot;interagency conflict between the FSB and the Ministry of Defense&quot;.
* In Moscow, Volgodonsk and Ryazan, the attacks were organized by the FSB through a chain of command that included director of the counter-terrorism department General German Ugryumov, FSB operatives Maxim Lazovsky, Vladimir Romanovich, Ramazan Dyshekov and others. Achemez Gochiyayev, Tatyana Korolyeva, and Alexander Karmishin rented warehouses that received shipments of hexogen disguised as sugar and did not know that the explosives were delivered.
* Adam Dekkushev, Krymshamkhalov, and Timur Batchayev were recruited by FSB agents who presented themselves as &quot;Chechen separatists&quot; to deliver explosives to Volgodonsk and Moscow.
* Names and the fate of FSB agents who planted the bomb in the city of Ryazan remain unknown.

===Books and films on the subject===
The theory of Russian government involvement has been described in a number of books and movies on the subject.

David Satter, a senior fellow of the Hudson Institute, authored two books &quot;Darkness at Dawn: The Rise of the Russian Criminal State&quot; and &quot;The Less You Know, The Better You Sleep: Russia&#x27;s Road to Terror and Dictatorship under Yeltsin and Putin&quot; (published by Yale University Press in 2003 and 2016) where he scrutinized the events and came to the conclusion that the bombings were organized by Russian state security services.

In 2002, former FSB officer Alexander Litvinenko and historian Yuri Felshtinsky published a book &quot;Blowing up Russia: Terror from within&quot;. According to authors the bombings and other terrorist acts have been committed by Russian security services to justify the Second Chechen War and to bring Vladimir Putin to power.

In another book, &quot;Lubyanka Criminal Group&quot;, Litvinenko and Alexander Goldfarb described the transformation of the FSB into a criminal and terrorist organization, including conducting the bombings. Former GRU analyst and historian Viktor Suvorov said that the book describes &quot;a leading criminal group that provides &quot;protection&quot; for all other organized crime in the country and which continues the criminal war against their own people&quot;, like their predecessors NKVD and KGB. He added: &quot;The book proves: Lubyanka [the KGB headquarters] was taken over by enemies of the people. ... If Putin&#x27;s team can not disprove the facts provided by Litvinenko, Putin must shoot himself. Patrushev and all other leadership of &quot;Lubyanka Criminal Group&quot; must follow his example.&quot;

Alexander Goldfarb and Marina Litvinenko published a book &quot;Death of a Dissident&quot;. They asserted that the murder of Mr. Litvinenko was &quot;the most compelling proof&quot; of the FSB involvement theory. According to the book, the murder of Litvinenko &quot;gave credence to all his previous theories, delivering justice for the tenants of the bombed apartment blocks, the Moscow theater-goers, Sergei Yushenkov, Yuri Shchekochikhin, and Anna Politkovskaya, and the half-exterminated nation of Chechnya, exposing their killers for the whole world to see.&quot;

A PBS &quot;Frontline&quot; documentary on Vladimir Putin also mentioned the theory and FSB involvement, citing the quick removal of rubble and bodies from the bombing scenes before any investigation could take place, the discovery of the Ryazan bomb, the deaths of several people who had attempted to investigate the bombings, as well as the defused Ryazan bomb being made of Russian military explosives and detonators.

A documentary film &quot;Assassination of Russia&quot; was made in 2000 by two French producers who had previously worked on NTV&#x27;s &quot;Sugar of Ryazan&quot; program.

A documentary &quot;Nedoverie&quot; (&quot;Disbelief&quot;) about the bombing controversy made by Russian director Andrei Nekrasov was premiered at the 2004 Sundance Film Festival. The film chronicles the story of Tatyana and Alyona Morozova, the two Russian-American sisters, who had lost their mother in the attack, and decided to find out who did it. His next film on the subject was &quot;&quot;.

Yuli Dubov, author of &quot;The Big Slice&quot;, wrote a novel &quot;The Lesser Evil&quot;, based on the bombings. The main characters of the story are &quot;Platon&quot; (Boris Berezovsky) and &quot;Larry&quot; (Badri Patarkatsishvili). They struggle against an evil KGB officer, &quot;Old man&quot; (apparently inspired by the legendary Philipp Bobkov), who brings another KGB officer, &quot;Fedor Fedorovich&quot; (Vladimir Putin) to power by staging a series of apartment bombings.

=== Support ===
The view about the bombings being organized and perpetrated by Russian state security services was originally put forward by journalist David Satter and historians Yuri Felshtinsky and Vladimir Pribylovsky, in co-authorship with Alexander Litvinenko. It was later supported by a number of historians. Amy Knight, a historian of the KGB, wrote that it was &quot;abundantly clear&quot; that the FSB was responsible for carrying out the attacks and that Vladimir Putin&#x27;s &quot;guilt seems clear,&quot; since it was inconceivable that the FSB would have done so without the sanction of Putin, the agency&#x27;s former director and by then Prime Minister of Russia. In her book &quot;Putin&#x27;s Kleptocracy&quot;, historian Karen Dawisha summarized evidence related to the bombings and concluded that &quot;to blow up your own innocent and sleeping people in your capital city is an action almost unthinkable. Yet the evidence that the FSB was at least involved in planting a bomb in Ryazan is incontrovertible.&quot; According to Timothy Snyder, &quot;it seemed possible&quot; that the perpetrators of the apartment bombings were FSB officers. David Satter considered the bombings as a political provocation by the Russian secret services that was similar to the burning of the Reichstag.

This view has been also supported by investigative journalists. In 2008, British journalist Edward Lucas concluded in his book &quot;The New Cold War: Putin&#x27;s Russia and the Threat to the West&quot; that &quot;The weight of evidence so far supports the grimmest interpretation: that the attacks were a ruthlessly planned stunt to create a climate of panic and fear in which Putin would quickly become the country&#x27;s indisputable leader, as indeed he did.&quot; In the September 2009 issue of &quot;GQ&quot;, veteran war correspondent Scott Anderson wrote about on Putin&#x27;s role in the Russian apartment bombings, based in part on his interviews with Mikhail Trepashkin The journal owner, Condé Nast, then took extreme measures to prevent an article by Anderson from appearing in the Russian media, both physically and in translation.

Former Russian State Security Council chief Alexandr Lebed in his 29 September 1999 interview with &quot;Le Figaro&quot; said he was almost convinced that the government organised the terrorist acts. Andrei Illarionov, a former key economic adviser to the Russian president, said that FSB involvement &quot;is not a theory, it is a fact. There is no other element that could have organized the bombings except for the FSB.&quot; Later Lebed&#x27;s public relations staff claimed that he was quoted out of the context.

Russian military analyst Pavel Felgenhauer noted that &quot;The FSB accused Khattab and Gochiyaev, but oddly they did not point the finger at Chechen president Aslan Maskhadov&#x27;s regime, which is what the war was launched against.&quot;

Some US politicians have commented that they consider credible the allegations about Russian state security services as the actual organizers of the bombings. In 2003, U.S. senator John McCain said that &quot;It was during Mr. Putin&#x27;s tenure as Prime Minister in 1999 that he launched the Second Chechen War following the Moscow apartment bombings. There remain credible allegations that Russia&#x27;s FSB had a hand in carrying out these attacks. Mr. Putin ascended to the presidency in 2000 by pointing a finger at the Chechens for committing these crimes, launching a new military campaign in Chechnya, and riding a frenzy of public anger into office.&quot;

On 11 January 2017, senator Marco Rubio raised the issue of the 1999 bombings during the confirmation hearings for Rex Tillerson. According to senator Rubio, &quot;there&#x27;s [an] incredible body of reporting, open source and other, that this was all—all those bombings were part of a black flag operation on the part of the FSB.&quot; On 10 January 2018, senator Ben Cardin of the United States Senate Foreign Relations Committee released a report entitled &quot;Putin&#x27;s Asymmetric Assault on Democracy in Russia and Europe: Implications for U.S. National Security&quot;. According to the report, &quot;no credible evidence has been presented by the Russian authorities linking Chechen terrorists, or anyone else, to the Moscow bombings.&quot;

According to Satter, all four bombings that occurred had a similar &quot;signature&quot; which indicated that the explosives had been carefully prepared, a mark of skilled specialists. The terrorists were able to obtain tons of hexogen explosive and transport it to various locations in Russia; hexogen is produced in one plant in Perm Oblast for whose security the central FSB is responsible. The culprits would also have needed to organise nine explosions (the four that occurred and the five attempted bombings reported by the authorities) in different cities in a two-week period. Satter&#x27;s estimate for the time required for target plan development, site visits, explosives preparation, renting space at the sites and transporting explosives to the sites was four to four and a half months. Hexogen was however at this time also widely available in Dagestan.

In a speech to the Oxford Union on 12 March 2022, former MI6 officer Christopher Steele voiced support for the idea that the bombings were a false flag operation conducted by Russian security services in order to justify the war in Chechnya.

=== Criticism ===
According to Russian investigative journalist Andrei Soldatov, &quot;From the start, it seemed that the Kremlin was determined to suppress all discussion ... When Alexander Podrabinek, a Russian human rights activist, tried to import copies of Litvinenko&#x27;s and Felshtinsky&#x27;s &quot;Blowing up Russia&quot; in 2003, they were confiscated by the FSB. Trepashkin himself, acting as a lawyer for two relatives of the victims of the blast, was unable to obtain information he requested and was entitled to see by law&quot;. However, Soldatov believed that the obstruction might reflect &quot;&#x27;paranoia&#x27; rather than guilt on the part of the authorities&quot;. Consequently, Soldatov argued, that paranoia has produced the very conspiracy theories that the Russian Government intended to eradicate. In their book &quot;The New Nobility&quot;, Andrei Soldatov and Irina Borogan believe that the Ryazan incident had actually been a training exercise by Vympel, a counter-terrorism FSB unit. Soldatov and Borogan noted that, according to Russian state security services, Achemez Gochiyaev was not an innocent businessman, but a leader of a local Islamist group since the mid-1990s, together with Dekkushev and Krymshamkhalov. Soldatov and Borogan have also noted a partial admission of guilt by Dekkushev and Krymshamkhalov after their interrogations during a trial in 2003.

According to Robert Bruce Ware, the simplest explanation for the apartment block blasts is that they were perpetrated by Islamist extremists from North Caucasus who sought retribution for the attacks of the Federal forces against the Islamist enclave in the central Dagestan, known as the Islamic Djamaat. Ware points out that that would explain the timing of the attacks, and why there were no attacks after the date on which the insurgents were driven from Dagestan. It would also explain why no Chechen claimed responsibility. Also it would explain Basayev&#x27;s reference to responsibility of Dagestanis and it would be consistent with the initial vow of Khattab to set off the bombs blasting through Russian cities.

Political scientist Ronald R. Pope in his review of David Satter&#x27;s book &quot;Darkness at Dawn&quot; cited Kirill Pankratov&#x27;s criticism, published as a contribution to Johnson&#x27;s Russia List. Regarding the apartment bombings, Pankratov argued that the Russian authorities did not need an additional justification to wage a war against Chechnya, in view of high-profile kidnappings and the invasion of Dagestan.

Political scientist Brian Taylor believes that there is too little evidence to decide which version of the events is correct, as the available evidence is fragmentary and controversial. Taylor identifies several reasons to doubt the conspiracy version. First, while the bombings did propel Putin to power, that alone is not proof that this was the goal of the attacks. Second, there was a &quot;casus belli&quot; even without the bombings—namely, the invasion of Dagestan and multiple kidnappings in the region in the preceding years. Third, if the goal of the bombings was to justify a new war, one or two bombings in Moscow would be more than adequate; any subsequent bombings would be potentially dangerous, because they would increase the risk to expose the conspiracy. Fourth, a complex plot involving multiple players and a large number of FSB operatives could not be kept secret. According to Taylor, it is plausible that the FSB &quot;simulated&quot; an attack in Ryazan in order to claim credit for &quot;uncovering&quot; it; however, the plot was foiled by vigilant local denizens and law enforcement personnel, and the &quot;training exercise&quot; justification was improvised after the plot failed.

Max Abrahms, a researcher who is critical of the efficacy of terrorism in general, argued that the bombings were detrimental for the self-determination of Chechnya. He noted that the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria has achieved a de facto independence from Russia after the Khasavyurt Accord, with two thirds of Russian citizens favoring the separation of the breakaway republic. However, the public opinion in Russia has changed dramatically after the bombings. Most Russians started &quot;baying for blood&quot; and strongly supporting the war with Chechnya that became inevitable and led to the loss of the independence as a result of the bombings. According to Abrahms, this supports his theory that attacks by terrorist organizations have been always counterproductive for the perpetrators and therefore gave rise to conspiracy theories about alternative perpetrators who actually benefited from the events.

Philip Short in his biography of Putin said that while &quot;It cannot be conclusively proved that no one from the FSB was involved&quot; there is no &quot;factual evidence of Russian state involvement.&quot;

====Russian officials====
In March 2000, Putin dismissed the allegations of FSB involvement in the bombings as &quot;delirious nonsense.&quot; &quot;There are no people in the Russian secret services who would be capable of such crime against their own people. The very allegation is immoral,&quot; he said. An FSB spokesman said that &quot;Litvinenko&#x27;s evidence cannot be taken seriously by those who are investigating the bombings&quot;.

Yuri Luzhkov, Mayor of Moscow at the time of the bombings, believed that the bombings in Moscow were facilitated by new legislation that established freedom of movement within the country, which was restricted prior to 1993. According to Luzhkov, the law made it possible for Chechen terrorists to bring weapons to Moscow and store them there, as well as purchase vehicles and provide housing for their personnel who had arrived in Moscow. According to Luzhkov, &quot;for three months, after having arrived in Moscow, a terrorist could live wherever he wanted and stay with anyone, without notifying the police&quot;, which allowed the terrorists to prepare the bombings.

== Sealing information by the US government ==
On 14 July 2016, David Satter filed Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests with the State Department, the CIA and the FBI, inquiring about documents pertaining to the apartment bombings, the Ryazan incident and persons who tried to investigate the bombings and were killed. The agencies acknowledged receipt of the requests, but Satter received no other response within the statutory time limit. On 29 August 2016, Satter filed suit against the Department of Justice and other agencies involved. However, the CIA refused even to acknowledge the existence of any relevant records because doing so would reveal &quot;very specific aspects of the Agency&#x27;s intelligence interest, or lack thereof, in the Russian bombings.&quot;

The State Department responded with a redacted copy of a cable from the U.S. embassy in Moscow. According to the cable, on 24 March 2000, a former member of Russian intelligence services told a U.S. diplomat that the real story about the Ryazan incident could never be known because it &quot;would destroy the country.&quot; The informant said the FSB had &quot;a specially trained team of men&quot; whose mission was &quot;to carry out this type of urban warfare&quot;. The informant has also said that Viktor Cherkesov, the FSB&#x27;s first deputy director and an interrogator of Soviet dissidents was &quot;exactly the right person to order and carry out such actions.&quot;

David Satter made a renewed FOIA request, and on 22 March 2017, State Department responded that documents concerning the U.S. assessment of the bombings would remain secret. A draft Vaughn index, a document used by agencies to justify withholdings in FOIA cases, said that the release of that information had &quot;the potential to inject friction into or cause serious damage&quot; to relationships with the Russian government that were &quot;vital to U.S. national security&quot;.

On 16 March 2018, the case &quot;Satter v. Department of Justice&quot; was closed.

<doc id="465334" wikidata="Q949180" url="?curid=465334" title="Financial accounting">
<text>Financial accounting is a branch of accounting concerned with the summary, analysis and reporting of financial transactions related to a business. This involves the preparation of financial statements available for public use. Stockholders, suppliers, banks, employees, government agencies, business owners, and other stakeholders are examples of people interested in receiving such information for decision making purposes.

Financial accountancy is governed by both local and international accounting standards. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) is the standard framework of guidelines for financial accounting used in any given jurisdiction. It includes the standards, conventions and rules that accountants follow in recording and summarizing and in the preparation of financial statements.

On the other hand, International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) is a set of accounting standards stating how particular types of transactions and other events should be reported in financial statements. IFRS are issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). With IFRS becoming more widespread on the international scene, &quot;consistency&quot; in financial reporting has become more prevalent between global organizations.

While financial accounting is used to prepare accounting information for people outside the organization or not involved in the day-to-day running of the company, managerial accounting provides accounting information to help managers make decisions to manage the business.

==Objectives==
Financial accounting and financial reporting are often used as synonyms.

1. According to International Financial Reporting Standards: the objective of financial reporting is:

To provide financial information that is useful to existing and potential investors, lenders and other creditors in making decisions about providing resources to the reporting entity.

2. According to the European Accounting Association:

Capital maintenance is a competing objective of financial reporting.

Financial accounting is the preparation of financial statements that can be consumed by the public and the relevant stakeholders. Financial information would be useful to users if such qualitative characteristics are present. When producing financial statements, the following must comply: 
Fundamental Qualitative Characteristics:
* Relevance: Relevance is the capacity of the financial information to influence the decision of its users. The ingredients of relevance are the predictive value and confirmatory value. Materiality is a sub-quality of relevance. Information is considered material if its omission or misstatement could influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of the financial statements.
* Faithful Representation: Faithful representation means that the actual effects of the transactions shall be properly accounted for and reported in the financial statements. The words and numbers must match what really happened in the transaction. The ingredients of faithful representation are completeness, neutrality and free from error. It signifies that the accountants have acted in good faith during the process of representation.
Enhancing Qualitative Characteristics:
* Verifiability: Verifiability implies consensus between the different knowledgeable and independent users of financial information. Such information must be supported by sufficient evidence to follow the principle of objectivity. 
* Comparability: Comparability is the uniform application of accounting methods across entities in the same industry. The principle of consistency is under comparability. Consistency is the uniform application of accounting across points in time within an entity.
* Understandability: Understandability means that accounting reports should be expressed as clearly as possible and should be understood by those to whom the information is relevant.
* Timeliness: Timeliness implies that financial information must be presented to the users before a decision is to be made.

== Three components of financial statements ==

=== Statement of cash flows (cash flow statement)===
The statement of cash flows considers the inputs and outputs in concrete cash within a stated period. The general template of a cash flow statement is as follows:
&quot;Cash Inflow - Cash Outflow + Opening Balance = Closing Balance&quot;

Example 1: in the beginning of September, Ellen started out with $5 in her bank account. During that same month, Ellen borrowed $20 from Tom. At the end of the month, Ellen bought a pair of shoes for $7. Ellen&#x27;s cash flow statement for the month of September looks like this:
*Cash inflow: $20
*Cash outflow:$7
*Opening balance: $5
*Closing balance: $20 – $7 + $5 = $18

Example 2: in the beginning of June, WikiTables, a company that buys and resells tables, sold 2 tables. They&#x27;d originally bought the tables for $25 each, and sold them at a price of $50 per table. The first table was paid out in cash however the second one was bought in credit terms. WikiTables&#x27; cash flow statement for the month of June looks like this:
*Cash inflow: $50 - &quot;How much WikiTables received in cash for the first table. They didn&#x27;t receive cash for the second table (sold in credit terms).&quot;
*Cash outflow: $50 - &quot;How much they&#x27;d originally bought the 2 tables for.&quot;
*Opening balance: $0
*Closing balance: $50 – 2*$25 + $0 = $50–50=$0 - &quot;Indeed, the cash flow for the month of June for WikiTables amounts to $0 and not $50.&quot;

Important: the cash flow statement only considers the exchange of actual cash, and ignores what the person in question owes or is owed.

=== Statement of financial performance (income statement, profit &amp; loss (p&amp;l) statement, or statement of operations) ===
The statement of profit or income statement represents the changes in value of a company&#x27;s accounts over a set period (most commonly one fiscal year), and may compare the changes to changes in the same accounts over the previous period. All changes are summarized on the &quot;bottom line&quot; as net income, often reported as &quot;net loss&quot; when income is less than zero.

The net profit or loss is determined by:

Sales (revenue)

– cost of goods sold

– selling, general, administrative expenses (SGA)

– depreciation/ amortization

= earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT)

– interest and tax expenses

= profit/loss

=== Statement of financial position (balance sheet) ===
The balance sheet is the financial statement showing a firm&#x27;s assets, liabilities and equity (capital) at a set point in time, usually the end of the fiscal year reported on the accompanying income statement. The total assets always equal the total combined liabilities and equity. This statement best demonstrates the basic accounting equation:&lt;br&gt;
 &quot;Assets = Liabilities + Equity&quot;
&lt;br&gt; The statement can be used to help show the financial position of a company because liability accounts are external claims on the firm&#x27;s assets while equity accounts are internal claims on the firm&#x27;s assets. 

Accounting standards often set out a general format that companies are expected to follow when presenting their balance sheets. International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) normally require that companies report current assets and liabilities separately from non-current amounts. A GAAP-compliant balance sheet must list assets and liabilities based on decreasing liquidity, from most liquid to least liquid. As a result, current assets/liabilities are listed first followed by non-current assets/liabilities. However, an IFRS-compliant balance sheet must list assets/liabilities based on increasing liquidity, from least liquid to most liquid. As a result, non-current assets/liabilities are listed first followed by current assets/liabilities.

Current assets are the most liquid assets of a firm, which are expected to be realized within a 12-month period. Current assets include:
*cash - physical money
*accounts receivable - revenues earned but not yet collected
*Merchandise inventory - consists of goods and services a firm currently owns until it ends up getting sold
*Investee companies - expected to be held less than one financial period
*prepaid expenses - expenses paid for in advance for use during that year

Non-current assets include fixed or long-term assets and intangible assets: 

*&quot;fixed (long term) assets&quot;
**property
**building
**equipment (such as factory machinery) 
*&quot;intangible assets&quot;
**copyrights
**trademarks
**patents
**goodwill

Liabilities include:
*&quot;current liabilities&quot;
**trade accounts payable
**dividends payable
**employee salaries payable
**interest (e.g. on debt) payable
*&quot;long term liabilities&quot;
**mortgage notes payable 
**bonds payable

Owner&#x27;s equity, sometimes referred to as net assets, is represented differently depending on the type of business ownership. Business ownership can be in the form of a sole proprietorship, partnership, or a corporation. For a corporation, the owner&#x27;s equity portion usually shows common stock, and retained earnings (earnings kept in the company). Retained earnings come from the retained earnings statement, prepared prior to the balance sheet.

==== Statement of retained earnings (statement of changes in equity) ====
This statement is additional to the three main statements described above. It shows how the distribution of income and transfer of dividends affects the wealth of shareholders in the company. The concept of retained earnings means profits of previous years that are accumulated till current period. Basic proforma for this statement is as follows:

Retained earnings at the beginning of period

+ Net Income for the period

- Dividends

= Retained earnings at the end of period.

==Basic concepts==

===The stable measuring assumption===

One of the basic principles in accounting is &quot;The Measuring Unit principle&quot;: The unit of measure in accounting shall be the base money unit of the most relevant currency. This principle also assumes the unit of measure is stable; that is, changes in its general purchasing power are not considered sufficiently important to require adjustments to the basic financial statements.&quot;

Historical Cost Accounting, i.e., financial capital maintenance in nominal monetary units, is based on the stable measuring unit assumption under which accountants simply assume that money, the monetary unit of measure, is perfectly stable in real value for the purpose of measuring (1) monetary items not inflation-indexed daily in terms of the Daily CPI and (2) constant real value non-monetary items not updated daily in terms of the Daily CPI during low and high inflation and deflation.

===Units of constant purchasing power===

The stable monetary unit assumption is not applied during hyperinflation. IFRS requires entities to implement capital maintenance in units of constant purchasing power in terms of IAS 29 Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies.

Financial accountants produce financial statements based on the accounting standards in a given jurisdiction. These standards may be the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles of a respective country, which are typically issued by a national standard setter, or International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), which are issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB).

Financial accounting serves the following purposes:
* producing general purpose financial statements
* producing information used by the management of a business entity for decision making, planning and performance evaluation
* producing financial statements for meeting regulatory requirements.

==Objectives of financial accounting==

* Systematic recording of transactions: basic objective of accounting is to systematically record the financial aspects of business transactions (i.e. book-keeping). These recorded transactions are later on classified and summarized logically for the preparation of financial statements and for their analysis and interpretation.
* Ascertainment of result of above recorded transactions: accountant prepares profit and loss account to know the result of business operations for a particular period of time. If expenses exceed revenue then it is said that the business is running under loss. The profit and loss account helps the management and different stakeholders in taking rational decisions. For example, if business is not proved to be remunerative or profitable, the cause of such a state of affairs can be investigated by the management for taking remedial steps.
* Ascertainment of the financial position of business: businessman is not only interested in knowing the result of the business in terms of profits or loss for a particular period but is also anxious to know that what he owes (liability) to the outsiders and what he owns (assets) on a certain date. To know this, accountant prepares a financial position statement of assets and liabilities of the business at a particular point of time and helps in ascertaining the financial health of the business.
* Providing information to the users for rational decision-making: accounting as a &#x27;language of business&#x27; communicates the financial result of an enterprise to various stakeholders by means of financial statements. Accounting aims to meet the financial information needs of the decision-makers and helps them in rational decision-making.
* To know the solvency position: by preparing the balance sheet, management not only reveals what is owned and owed by the enterprise, but also it gives the information regarding concern&#x27;s ability to meet its liabilities in the short run (liquidity position) and also in the long-run (solvency position) as and when they fall due.

== Graphic definition ==
The accounting equation (Assets = Liabilities + Owners&#x27; Equity) and financial statements are the main topics of financial accounting.

The trial balance, which is usually prepared using the double-entry accounting system, forms the basis for preparing the financial statements. All the figures in the trial balance are rearranged to prepare a profit &amp; loss statement and balance sheet. Accounting standards determine the format for these accounts (SSAP, FRS, IFRS). Financial statements display the income and expenditure for the company and a summary of the assets, liabilities, and shareholders&#x27; or owners&#x27; equity of the company on the date to which the accounts were prepared.

Asset, expense, and dividend accounts have normal debit balances (i.e., debiting these types of accounts increases them).

Liability, revenue, and equity accounts have normal credit balances (i.e., crediting these types of accounts increases them).
&lt;br&gt;
 0 = Dr Assets Cr Owners&#x27; Equity Cr Liabilities 
 . _____________________________/\____________________________ .
 . / Cr Retained Earnings (profit) Cr Common Stock \ .
 . _________________/\_______________________________ . .
 . / Dr Expenses Cr Beginning Retained Earnings \ . .

 increased by debits increased by credits
 
 Crediting a credit 
 Thus -------------------------&gt; account increases its absolute value (balance)
 Debiting a debit 
 
 Debiting a credit 
 Thus -------------------------&gt; account decreases its absolute value (balance)
 Crediting a debit

When the same thing is done to an account as its normal balance it increases; when the opposite is done, it will decrease. Much like signs in math: two positive numbers are added and two negative numbers are also added. It is only when there is one positive and one negative (opposites) that you will subtract.&lt;br&gt;
However, there are instances of accounts, known as contra-accounts, which have a normal balance opposite that listed above. Examples include:
* Contra-asset accounts (such as accumulated depreciation and allowances for bad debt or obsolete inventory)
* Contra-revenue accounts (such as sales allowances)
* Contra-equity accounts (such as treasury stock)

==Financial accounting versus cost accounting==

#Financial accounting aims at finding out results of accounting year in the form of Profit and Loss Account and Balance Sheet. Cost Accounting aims at computing cost of production/service in a scientific manner and facilitate cost control and cost reduction.
#Financial accounting reports the results and position of business to government, creditors, investors, and external parties.
#Cost Accounting is an internal reporting system for an organisation&#x27;s own management for decision making.
# In financial accounting, cost classification based on type of transactions, e.g. salaries, repairs, insurance, stores etc. In cost accounting, classification is basically on the basis of functions, activities, products, process and on internal planning and control and information needs of the organization.
# Financial accounting aims at presenting &#x27;true and fair&#x27; view of transactions, profit and loss for a period and Statement of financial position (Balance Sheet) on a given date. It aims at computing &#x27;true and fair&#x27; view of the cost of production/services offered by the firm.

<doc id="465335" wikidata="Q6840281" url="?curid=465335" title="Microsoft Corp. v. Lindows.com, Inc.">
<text>Microsoft v. Lindows.com, Inc. was a court case brought by Microsoft against Lindows, Inc in December 2001, claiming that the name &quot;Lindows&quot; was a violation of its trademark &quot;Windows.&quot;

After two and a half years of court battles, Microsoft paid million for the Lindows trademark, and Lindows Inc. became Linspire Inc.

==The case==
In addition to the United States, Microsoft also sued Lindows in Sweden, France, Belgium, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Canada.

Lindows started off with a handicap of having to defend themselves from their own lawyers (from St. Paul Fire and Marine Insurance Company) who initially refused to defend Lindows. Judge Robert Takasugi found St. Paul Fire and Marine Insurance Company had breached their contract.

In response to these lawsuits, Lindows launched &quot;ChoicePC.com&quot;, which allowed people to purchase lifetime Lindows memberships that included a copy of LindowsOS, LindowsOS upgrades for life, and a ChoicePC.com T-shirt, for . All money from the memberships went towards helping Lindows in its legal battle against Microsoft.

Lindows had also retaliated against Microsoft&#x27;s lawsuits with &quot;Lin---s&quot; (pronounced &quot;Lindash&quot;) and the corresponding domain &quot;lin---s.com&quot; (now disused). Consumers and resellers from countries in which Microsoft had blocked the sale of Lindows products due to the trademark lawsuits were encouraged to visit the Lin---s website instead of Lindows.com to purchase the Lin---s software, which was identical to Lindows except for the name change.

As early as 2002, a court rejected Microsoft&#x27;s claims, stating that Microsoft had used the term &quot;windows&quot; to describe graphical user interfaces before the product, Windows, was ever released, and the windowing technique had already been implemented by Xerox and Apple many years before. Microsoft kept seeking retrial, but in February 2004, a judge rejected two of Microsoft&#x27;s central claims. The judge denied Microsoft&#x27;s request for a preliminary injunction and raised &quot;serious questions&quot; about Microsoft&#x27;s trademark. Microsoft feared a court may define &quot;Windows&quot; as generic and result in the loss of its status as a trademark.

==Settlement==
In July 2004, Microsoft offered to settle with Lindows. As part of this licensing settlement, Microsoft paid an estimated , and Lindows transferred the Lindows trademark to Microsoft and changed their name to Linspire.

<doc id="465341" wikidata="Q906930" url="?curid=465341" title="St. Paul's School (New Hampshire)">
<text>St. Paul&#x27;s School (also known as St. Paul&#x27;s or SPS) is a college-preparatory, coeducational boarding school in Concord, New Hampshire, affiliated with the Episcopal Church. The school&#x27;s , or 3.125 square mile, campus serves 540 students, who come from 37 states and 28 countries.

Established in 1856 to educate boys from upper-class families, St. Paul&#x27;s later became one of the first boys&#x27; boarding schools to admit girls and is now home to a diverse student body from all backgrounds. It is one of the only remaining boarding-only high schools in the United States. With a financial endowment of $759.3 million as of June 2024, St. Paul&#x27;s is one of the wealthiest boarding schools in New England on a per capita basis. U.S.-based students with annual household incomes of $150,000 or below &quot;generally qualify for full tuition support.&quot; Thirty-eight percent of students are on financial aid.

==History==

=== Early history ===
In 1856, Boston physician George Cheyne Shattuck, the future dean of Harvard Medical School, converted his summer home in Millville, New Hampshire (a satellite town of Concord) into a boarding school for boys. Inspired by the educational theories of Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi, who believed that classroom learning should be balanced with the &quot;direct experience of the senses,&quot; Shattuck wanted his two sons educated in the austere, bucolic countryside. He hoped that eventually, the school would &quot;educate the sons of [other] wealthy inhabitants of large cities.&quot;

For the first fifty years of St. Paul&#x27;s history, it was run by two brothers, Henry Augustus Coit (r. 1856-95) and Joseph Howland Coit (r. 1895-1906). An Anglophile, Henry Coit endeavored to make St. Paul&#x27;s an American equivalent of an English public school, importing Anglicisms such as &quot;forms,&quot; &quot;removes,&quot; &quot;evensong,&quot; and &quot;matins.&quot; The school&#x27;s religious services were Anglo-Catholic, and enrollment was initially limited to Episcopalians. In the 1890s, Coit also attempted to ban baseball in favor of cricket; the SPS cricket team toured New England and Canada.

SPS almost immediately attracted an upper-class clientele. Shattuck had attended Round Hill School, a short-lived experimental school that was &quot;the most famous American school of its time.&quot; Founded in 1823, Round Hill was one of Harvard College&#x27;s top feeder schools, and &quot;offered an excellent but very expensive education&quot; with &quot;an elegant lifestyle,&quot; including &quot;servants, stables, and tours of the estates of prominent Bostonians.&quot; Although it shut down in 1834, it left a strong impression on Shattuck, who believed that in the isolation of a boarding school, attentive teachers could better foster &quot;physical and moral culture&quot; in their students. Roughly 70 percent of Round Hill families eventually sent children to St. Paul&#x27;s.

The school started with just three students, but grew quickly. By the mid-1860s, it was already filled to capacity, leading an SPS parent to establish St. Mark&#x27;s School. Enrollment reached 204 students by 1878 and 345 students by 1895. Although the school (founded by Bostonians) was initially not associated with the New York upper class, SPS gradually extended its reach to New York and the Philadelphia Main Line. By 1894, there were only six students from Boston. In 1923, the school educated 199 students from New York and 26 from Massachusetts.

=== College feeder ===
The Coits&#x27; immediate successor, Henry Ferguson (r. 1906-11), left after just five years. In 1910, Samuel Drury (r. 1911-38) assumed control of the school. He presided over what the school historian called its &quot;Augustan age.&quot; Drury stayed at St. Paul&#x27;s for twenty-seven years. Along the way, he declined the rectorship of Manhattan&#x27;s Trinity Church—at the time the nation&#x27;s wealthiest congregation—and the bishopric of Pennsylvania.

Drury turned SPS into one of America&#x27;s most reliable feeder schools to Ivy League universities. Like other leading New England prep schools of the period, SPS was not founded as a college-preparatory school: of the first 70 graduates, only five went directly to college. However, times were changing. Ferguson had recognized that parents were increasingly interested in sending their sons to college, but was not able to implement his ideas. Although Drury shared some of Henry Coit&#x27;s skepticism about higher education—he once wrote in his annual report that a quarter of every St. Paul&#x27;s class should be encouraged to forego college —he significantly improved St. Paul&#x27;s academic reputation. He hired better teachers, tightened academic standards, and reestablished student discipline. Universities were attracted to the kind of well-schooled, upper-class young men that schools like St. Paul&#x27;s produced in large quantities. In 1934, 95% of St. Paul&#x27;s graduates matriculated at Harvard, Yale, or Princeton. In addition, in 1940 (shortly after Drury&#x27;s death), 77 students applied to Harvard from the &quot;St. Grottlesex&quot; schools (of which St. Paul&#x27;s was the largest member), and only one was rejected.

Drury also sought to democratize the student body and curtail snobbery among the richer students. Although St. Paul&#x27;s was heavily oversubscribed—in 1920 it received over 1,600 applications for just over 100 openings—Drury set aside 10 slots a year for the winners of a competitive examination, dryly explaining that &quot;we try to admit every son of an alumnus,&quot; but also &quot;wish to admit every boy with high marks.&quot; A capable fundraiser, Drury raised the school&#x27;s financial endowment from $1.1 million in 1920 to $3.6 million in 1930, and conducted a $1.6 million fundraising campaign that primarily went towards student financial aid. From 1920 to 1938, the share of SPS students on scholarship nearly tripled, from roughly 6% to 17%. Starting in 1922, Drury and his successors froze tuition at $1,400 for 22 consecutive years. 

=== Turbulence and reform ===
Norman Nash (r. 1939-47) guided the school through World War II before leaving to become the Bishop of Massachusetts. He was succeeded by Henry Kittredge (r. 1947-54), the first SPS rector who was not an Episcopal minister. Although Kittredge questioned colleges&#x27; increasing reliance on standardized tests in college admissions, he was generally able to sustain SPS&#x27; enviable college placement record. In 1953, SPS sent 78% of its students to Harvard, Yale, or Princeton, second among New England boarding schools.

Under Matthew Warren (r. 1954-70), the school underwent significant changes. Tuition was increased to $1,800; applications increased significantly despite rising tuition, aided by an improving economy; and the campus was substantially renovated. As competition for spots at SPS increased, Warren conciliated the alumni, many of whom wanted to send their own sons to SPS. He announced that under his watch, SPS would not &quot;use scholarship funds to entice the unusually able boy to our school.&quot; It was an ill-timed concession, as colleges were receiving the same flood of applications as boarding schools and took the opportunity to tighten their own standards for admission. By 1967 the proportion of SPS graduates going on to Harvard, Yale, or Princeton had nearly halved from 1953. Warren personally visited Yale president Kingman Brewster to ask him to reverse course. Brewster replied that Yale would accept students from the top 40% of the SPS class, but was no longer interested in bottom-half SPS students.

The school gradually opened its doors to a broader cross-section of America. The school scrapped its Episcopalians-only rule, although not without some hiccups. In 1939, Rose Kennedy withdrew Robert F. Kennedy from the school after just one month because she believed its culture was still anti-Catholic; in the late 1950s the school allowed John Kerry &#x27;62 to attend Mass off campus as long as he also attended the school&#x27;s Episcopal Sunday chapel services later that day; and by the end of the 1960s, Catholics were no longer required to attend Protestant services on campus. SPS&#x27; first black faculty member (John T. Walker) and student arrived in 1957 and 1959, respectively. Warren&#x27;s last major achievement was coeducation: in May 1970, shortly before he stepped down, the board of trustees agreed to begin admitting girls in 1971. Nonetheless, the tail end of Warren&#x27;s tenure marked the start of a turbulent period for St. Paul&#x27;s. In 1968, students wrote an acerbic manifesto describing the school administration as an oppressive regime, and issued demands for change.

St. Paul&#x27;s rode out the storm under Warren&#x27;s successor William Oates (r. 1970-82). According to Alex Shoumatoff &#x27;64, Oates applied &quot;the prevailing educational and developmental thinking of the day, that schools should not be repressive and that adolescents should be free to experiment and try out different identities.&quot; He conciliated the students by offering them the opportunity to participate in disciplinary decisions. He also accepted several of the demands that the students had made in 1968. In the following years, seated meals were reduced from three times a day to four times a week, courses were shortened to be terms (rather than years) long, mandatory (non-Sunday) chapel attendance was reduced to four times a week, and the school&#x27;s grading system was changed to ease student competition. Oates also expanded the arts program.

An excellent fundraiser, Oates doubled the size of the school&#x27;s endowment with an ambitious $30 million fundraising campaign, which left SPS the wealthiest boarding school in the United States (per capita) by a comfortable margin.

=== Emergence into modern era ===
By the 1980s and 1990s, the board of trustees wanted the administration to exercise a firmer hand over the school. They confronted St. Paul&#x27;s emerging image (warranted or not) as a &quot;party school&quot;—a poll found that 80% of the students were using drugs—and sought to restore faculty discipline over the students. In 1992, the board appointed David Hicks (r. 1992-96) as rector and ordered him to improve the school&#x27;s academic reputation, as &quot;[n]obody had gone to Harvard in five years, except for legacies.&quot; Hicks introduced an interdisciplinary humanities curriculum which the school still employs today. Although the faculty eventually forced him to resign, the school rebounded academically. In 2001, SPS ranked fifth among boarding schools and fifteenth in the nation in a study of which schools sent the most students to Harvard, Yale, and Princeton.

The succeeding rectors ushered in a relative period of calm, and the trustees and rectors have continued to modernize the campus. The new Ohrstrom Library, designed by Robert A. M. Stern and Carroll Cline, opened in 1991. A 95,000-square-foot athletic center opened in 2004. The Lindsay Center for Mathematics and Science opened in fall 2011. The former visual arts center, the Hargate Building, was renovated in 2017 to become the new Friedman Community Center. A replacement arts building was opened in 2017. However, the school has endured a series of controversies in the 21st century, primarily concerning sexual misconduct.

The modern-day St. Paul&#x27;s serves a diverse body of students from all backgrounds while still educating students drawn from the highest levels of American society and international elites. According to sociologist Shamus Khan (an alumnus), the school&#x27;s unparalleled financial resources allow it to cultivate &quot;an intentional diversity that few communities share or can afford.&quot; Financial aid students admitted to SPS receive, on average, an 87% discount on frontline tuition.

In 2019, Kathleen Giles became the fourteenth rector of St. Paul&#x27;s. She had previously served as the head of Middlesex School from 2003 to 2019. Before that, she was the dean of academic affairs at Groton School. Under her administration, St. Paul&#x27;s bills itself as &quot;one of the nation&#x27;s only 100% boarding high schools&quot;; nearly all of its competitors enroll some day students.

==Facilities==

The school&#x27;s rural campus is familiarly known as &quot;Millville,&quot; after a now-abandoned mill whose relic still stands in the woods near the Lower School Pond. When St. Paul&#x27;s was founded, its campus covered 50 acres. Today, the campus stretches over 2,000 acres, the overwhelming majority of which is undeveloped wildland and woodland. The campus itself includes four ponds and the upper third of the Turkey River. In 2018, &quot;Architectural Digest&quot; named St. Paul&#x27;s the most beautiful private high school campus in New Hampshire.

The centerpiece of the campus is the Chapel of St. Peter and St. Paul (informally the &quot;New Chapel&quot;), constructed between 1886 and 1888. It was designed by Henry Vaughan, and was one of the first American chapels to employ Perpendicular Gothic. Although Vaughan was the architect of Washington National Cathedral, an architecture critic at Princeton University called the New Chapel Vaughan&#x27;s masterpiece, as Vaughan died before the cathedral was completed. SPS preserved the smaller Old Chapel, which dates back to 1858 and was the school&#x27;s first building; it is now used for ceremonial events.

Overlooking the Lower School Pond, the Ohrstrom Library was remodeled in 2016 and is now home to 75,000 print books and almost half a million e-books in its digital archive. According to the alumni magazine, this &quot;put[s] the school archives on par with some of the country’s major universities.&quot; Lindsay Center, the science and math building, contains a greenhouse and an observatory. The school is currently building a 16,000-square-foot admissions center, scheduled to open in early 2025.

There are 19 dorms: nine boys&#x27;, nine girls&#x27;, and one all-gender. Each houses between 20 and 40 students, and every dorm has members of all four forms. The architecture of the dormitories varies from the Collegiate Gothic style of the &quot;Quad&quot; dorms (built in 1927) to the spare, modern style of the Kittredge building (built in the early 1970s).

== Finances ==

=== Tuition and financial aid ===

In the 2024-25 school year, St. Paul&#x27;s charged students $68,353 plus fees, of which financial aid covered, on average, $60,500. 

St. Paul&#x27;s offers need-based financial aid, and commits to meet 100% of demonstrated financial need for every admitted student. The school states that U.S.-based families with annual household incomes of $150,000 or below &quot;generally qualify for full tuition support.&quot; Thirty-eight percent of SPS students are on financial aid, and the school&#x27;s financial aid budget is roughly $12.6 million.

Although most financial aid at St. Paul&#x27;s is administered strictly on the basis of financial need, the school offers a limited number of regional scholarships for students from Alabama, California, New Jersey, New Mexico, Montana, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, and Wyoming, as well as Mexico.

=== Endowment and expenses ===

As of June 30, 2024, St. Paul&#x27;s disclosed in its 2023-24 Annual Report that its financial endowment stands at $759.3 million, equivalent to approximately $1.4 million per student. In its Internal Revenue Service filings for the 2021-22 school year, SPS reported total assets of $953.8 million, net assets of $854.6 million, investment holdings of $724.4 million, and cash holdings of $14.9 million. SPS also reported $64.7 million in program service expenses and $10.9 million in grants (primarily student financial aid).

St. Paul&#x27;s has historically been one of the wealthiest boarding schools in the United States. In 1978, &quot;Time&quot; magazine reported that St. Paul&#x27;s had an endowment per student of $92,555 ($440,524 in February 2024 dollars), nearly two-thirds more than second-placed Groton. A 2009 study found that Exeter ($987,000) had passed St. Paul&#x27;s ($827,000), and Andover ($722,000) and Hotchkiss ($716,000) were not far behind. However, in January 2019 St. Paul&#x27;s was once again the wealthiest boarding school in New England, with an endowment per student of $1.19 million.

== Admissions and student body ==

=== Admissions ===
In 2024, St. Paul&#x27;s welcomed 141 new students and reported an admissions rate of 13%. The new students came from 24 states and 22 countries. Based on 2023 data, 71.7% of accepted students chose to enroll at SPS. 

=== Diversity ===
In the 2023-24 school year, St. Paul&#x27;s reported that 48% of its students identified as people of color and 22% were international students. The student body represented 37 states and 28 countries. 

In the 2021-22 school year, St. Paul&#x27;s reported that 62.4% of its students were white, 15.1% were Asian, 7.9% were black, 7.7% were Hispanic, 0.2% were Native American/Alaska Native, and 6.6% were multiracial. The survey did not permit the school to identify one student in multiple categories. At the end of the 2021-22 school year, SPS announced that 47% of its 158 incoming students were non-Caucasian and 19% came from abroad. 

== Athletics ==

=== Notable sports ===
George Shattuck supported outdoors education, and St. Paul&#x27;s was &quot;perhaps the first school in which the deed of gift accented physical development.&quot;

St. Paul&#x27;s has a long tradition of ice hockey. The school, and the city of Concord more broadly, were early cradles for ice hockey in America.

* By some accounts, the first hockey game in the United States was played on the St. Paul&#x27;s Lower School Pond on November 17, 1883, after SPS teacher James Potter Conover visited Montreal for Christmas and watched Canadian skaters play the game.
* In 1885, America&#x27;s first written hockey rules were drafted at St. Paul&#x27;s by schoolboy Malcolm Gordon &#x27;87. Gordon would go on to coach hockey at SPS from 1888 to 1917. He is a member of the U.S. Hockey Hall of Fame.
* Under Gordon and his successors, the school was a prominent force in early 20th-century American hockey, playing and beating collegiate teams, including Harvard and Princeton. SPS alumni may have founded the hockey programs at Harvard and Yale.
* American college hockey&#x27;s award for the most outstanding male player is named after SPS alumnus Hobey Baker.

The first squash courts in the United States were built at St. Paul&#x27;s in 1884. In addition to bringing hockey to the United States, Conover introduced an early variant of squash (squash tennis) to SPS.

The St. Paul&#x27;s boys&#x27; and girls&#x27; crews have each won multiple titles in international competition. The boys&#x27; crew won the Princess Elizabeth Challenge Cup at the Henley Royal Regatta in 1980, 1994, and 2004. The girls&#x27; crew team won the Peabody Cup at the Henley Women&#x27;s Regatta in 1996, 1998, 2001, and 2019.

=== Conference affiliation ===
St. Paul&#x27;s is a member of the Lakes Region League, an athletic conference of prep schools in New Hampshire and Vermont. It was previously a member of the Boston-centered Independent School League, but withdrew in 2017 due to league bylaws surrounding merit scholarships. In addition, the athletic directors of St. Paul&#x27;s and the other members of the Eight Schools Association comprise the Eight Schools Athletic Council, which organizes sports events and tournaments among ESA schools.

==Daily life==
St. Paul&#x27;s conducts its Humanities classes using the Harkness method, which encourages discussion between students and the teacher, and between students.

=== Socialization ===

According to Shamus Khan, author of &quot;Privilege: The Making of an Adolescent Elite at St. Paul&#x27;s School&quot; (2010) and a sociologist who is a St. Paul&#x27;s alumnus, students are socialized to function as privileged holders of power and status in an open society. Privilege in meritocracy is acquired through talent, hard work, and a wide variety of cultural and social experiences. Economic inequality and social inequality are explained by the lack of talent, hard work, and limited cultural and social experience of the less privileged. Thus high status is earned, not based on entitlement. According to Khan, &quot;Today what is distinct among the elite is not their exclusivity but their ease within and broad acceptance of a more open world.&quot;

Hierarchy is embedded in the rituals and traditions of the school from the first day. According to Khan, the student advances up the ladder of the hierarchy embedded in the culture of the school.

===Traditions===
The annual Inter-House Inter-Club Race, known among students as the &quot;Dorm Run,&quot; but now officially named the &quot;Charles B. Morgan Run&quot;, takes place late in the fall term, usually in early to mid-November. Students are invited to earn points for their dorm and club by running in a cross country race. The current student record is 9:48, set in 2006 by Peter Harrison &#x27;07.

In the spring term, St. Paul&#x27;s holds a school-wide public speaking contest called the Hugh Camp Cup. The finalists&#x27; speeches are delivered before the entire school, and the student body votes on a winner, whose name is engraved on the prize. Alumnus John Kerry achieved this distinction during his sixth form year.

St. Paul&#x27;s students once had a close relationship with jam bands like the Grateful Dead. Some of the slang peculiar to St. Paul&#x27;s originated as the &quot;Pyramid Dialect&quot; among St. Paul&#x27;s students and alumni who followed the Grateful Dead&#x27;s 1978 shows in Egypt. Phish played in the Upper Dining Hall on May 19, 1990. electro house artist Steve Aoki performed in the school&#x27;s Athletic &amp; Fitness Center on April 9, 2015.

==Advanced Studies Program==
St. Paul&#x27;s School founded the summer Advanced Studies Program in 1957 to provide juniors from public and parochial New Hampshire high schools with challenging educational opportunities. The students live and study at the St. Paul&#x27;s campus for five and a half weeks and are immersed in their subject of choice. Recent offerings have included astronomy and Shakespeare. In addition to the course load, students choose a daily extracurricular activity or sport to participate in four afternoons per week. The program had a 37% admission rate in 2010. In 2014, 267 students from 78 high schools participated in the Advanced Studies Program.

==Controversies==
===1948-2009 sexual misconduct investigation===

In 2016, after the &quot;Boston Globe&quot; published an article implicating a former SPS teacher in sexual misconduct during his time at a different school, SPS issued a public invitation to its alumni to report incidents of sexual misconduct during their time on campus. It also retained the law firm of former Massachusetts Attorney General Scott Harshbarger to conduct an investigation. Harshbarger&#x27;s team issued an initial report in May 2017. It also published follow-up reports in September 2017 and August 2018 outlining additional allegations of sexual misconduct that SPS received after the publication of the May 2017 report. The initial report was limited to the period between 1948 and 1988, and the follow-up reports addressed allegations of misconduct through 2009.

All together, the three reports substantiated allegations of misconduct against twenty former SPS employees (including future politician Gerry Studds), which included assaults, harassment, and rape. The investigators concluded that allegations against fifteen other SPS employees were unsubstantiated, and lacked sufficient information to reach an conclusion with respect to thirteen other SPS employees.

Per the terms of a settlement with the New Hampshire Attorney General (see below), SPS has retained an independent monitor to review any further reports of sexual misconduct by SPS employees. In 2019, the school removed the names of two rectors from campus buildings, explaining that they had mishandled abuse claims during their respective tenures.

=== 1991 rape allegation ===
In July 2020, alumna Lacy Crawford wrote that she had been raped by multiple SPS students when she was fifteen, and accused SPS of a cover-up. The school issued a statement that it would &quot;honor her desire that the school acknowledge its failings, accept responsibility, and work, not just promise, to do better.&quot; Crawford later disclosed that the school had issued her a written apology and that she was pleased with its response.

===Mid-2000s IRS audit and investigation===

Rector Craig B. Anderson (r. 1997-2005) retired under pressure in May 2005 after a campaign by parents and alumni that criticized his management of school finances and investments. As alleged, Anderson had severely cut back on school expenses while simultaneously being quite liberal with his own compensation and perks. The state attorney general investigated the issue, resulting in a settlement agreement and an Internal Revenue Service audit.

===2015 &quot;Senior Salute&quot; rape conviction===

The &quot;Senior Salute&quot;, an alleged tradition in which seniors would proposition younger classmates for sexual encounters before graduation, was publicly revealed in 2015, when a former student, Owen Labrie, was charged with the rape of 15-year-old freshman Chessy Prout. Labrie was convicted on three counts of statutory rape, one count of endangering the welfare of a child, and one felony count of using a computer to lure a minor. The New Hampshire court system rejected Labrie&#x27;s appeals and new trial requests in 2018 and 2019. Labrie was released from prison in June 2019, having served eight months of his twelve-month sentence. He was also sentenced to five years of probation and was required to register as a sex offender.

In 2018, SPS confidentially settled a civil suit filed by Prout&#x27;s parents. Later that year, Prout published her memoir of the incident, titled &quot;I Have the Right To: A High School Survivor&#x27;s Story of Sexual Assault, Justice, and Hope&quot;.

===2017 criminal investigation===

In July 2017, the New Hampshire Attorney General, with assistance from Concord police and the New Hampshire State Police, started a criminal investigation into the school to determine whether administrators engaged in conduct that endangered the welfare of students. In 2018, the state AG reached a settlement agreement, which allowed the school to avoid criminal prosecution and required it to pay for an external compliance monitor.

In 2020, the monitor resigned, claiming that the school was obstructing his investigations and that an administrator had verbally abused him. The school eventually agreed to hire a new monitor, to add funding for an assistant monitor, and to hire the Rape, Abuse &amp; Incest National Network to conduct a study of the school&#x27;s anti-abuse policies. The school was not required to re-hire the original monitor. A replacement monitor released a report in 2021, noting that the school had hired an on-campus advocate to provide support for sexual assault survivors on a confidential basis. RAINN issued a report and recommendations in September 2022, noting that &quot;St. Paul&#x27;s leadership has made a number of process improvements in recent years.&quot;

<text>Timothy Pickering (July 17, 1745January 29, 1829) was an American politician who was the third United States Secretary of State under Presidents George Washington and John Adams. He also represented Massachusetts in both houses of Congress as a member of the Federalist Party. In 1795, he was elected a member of the American Philosophical Society.

Born in Salem in the Province of Massachusetts Bay, Pickering began a legal career after graduating from Harvard College. He won election to the Massachusetts General Court and served as a county judge. He also became an officer in the colonial militia and served in the siege of Boston during the early stages of the American Revolutionary War. Later in the war, he was Adjutant General and Quartermaster General of the Continental Army. After the war, Pickering moved to the Wyoming Valley of Pennsylvania and took part in the then colony&#x27;s 1787 ratifying convention for the United States Constitution.

President Washington appointed Pickering to the position of Postmaster General in 1791. After briefly serving as Secretary of War, Pickering became the Secretary of State in 1795, and remained in that office after President Adams was inaugurated. As Secretary of State, Pickering favored close relations with Britain. President Adams dismissed him in 1800 due to Pickering&#x27;s opposition to peace with France during the Quasi-War.

Pickering won election to represent Massachusetts in the United States Senate in 1803, becoming an ardent opponent of the Embargo Act of 1807. He continued to support Britain in the Napoleonic Wars, famously describing the country as &quot;The World&#x27;s last hope – Britain&#x27;s Fast-anchored Isle.&quot; He left the Senate in 1811 but served in the United States House of Representatives from 1813 to 1817. During the War of 1812, he became a leader of the New England secession movement and helped organize the Hartford Convention. The fallout from the convention ended Pickering&#x27;s political career. He lived as a farmer in Salem until his death in 1829.

==Early life==

Pickering was born in Salem, Massachusetts to Deacon Timothy and Mary Wingate Pickering. He was one of nine children and the younger brother of John Pickering (not to be confused with the New Hampshire judge) who would eventually serve as Speaker of the Massachusetts House of Representatives. He attended grammar school in Salem and graduated from Harvard College in 1763. Salem minister William Bentley noted on Pickering: &quot;From his youth his townsmen proclaim him assuming, turbulent, &amp; headstrong.&quot;

After graduating from Harvard, Pickering returned to Salem where he began working for John Higginson, the town clerk and Essex County register of deeds. Pickering was admitted to the Massachusetts Bar in 1768 and, in 1774, he succeeded Higginson as register of deeds. Soon after, he was elected to represent Salem in the Massachusetts General Court and served as a justice in the Essex County Court of Common Pleas. On April 8, 1766, he married Rebecca White of Salem.

In January 1766, Pickering was commissioned a lieutenant in the Essex County militia. He was promoted to captain three years later. In 1769, he published his ideas on drilling soldiers in the &quot;Essex Gazette&quot;. These were published in 1775 as &quot;An Easy Plan for a Militia.&quot; The manual was used as the Continental Army drill book until replaced by Baron von Steuben&#x27;s Regulations for the Order and Discipline of the Troops of the United States

==American Revolutionary War==

===Salem incident===
On February 26, 1775, men under Pickering&#x27;s command were involved in one of the earliest military engagements in the American Revolution, a confrontation locally referred to as &quot;Leslie&#x27;s Retreat.&quot; A detachment of British regulars under British Army Lt. Colonel Alexander Leslie was dispatched from Boston to search North Salem for contraband artillery. Leslie&#x27;s men were thwarted from crossing the North River bridge and searching the outlying farms by Pickering&#x27;s militia and citizens of Salem. Many of these &quot;citizens&quot; were members of Salem&#x27;s North Church, which was just a short distance from the North Bridge. Col. Leslie chose a Sunday morning to raid Salem knowing that the citizens would be attending church. They were, of course, but the Rev. Thomas Barnard Jr. of the North Church famously left his pulpit that morning to meet the British troops at the bridge. A fast rider from Marblehead had ridden ahead of the British to warn Mr. Barnard. Barnard is credited with convincing Col. Leslie to retreat in peace. If he had not, Pickering&#x27;s troops would have fired the &quot;shot heard &#x27;round the world&quot; and started the war. Two months later, Pickering&#x27;s troops marched to take part in the Battles of Lexington and Concord but arrived too late to play a major role. They then became part of the New England army assembling outside Boston to lay siege to the city.

===Adjutant general===
In December 1776, he led a well-drilled regiment of the Essex County militia to New York, where General George Washington took notice and offered Pickering the position of adjutant general of the Continental Army in 1777 with the rank of colonel. In this capacity he oversaw the building of the Great chain which was forged at the Stirling Iron Works. The chain blocked the Royal Navy from proceeding up the Hudson River past West Point and protected that important fort from attack for the duration of the conflict.

He was widely praised for his work in supplying the troops during the remainder of the conflict. In August 1780, the Continental Congress elected Pickering Quartermaster General.

==Rise to power==
After the end of the American Revolution, Pickering made several failed attempts at financial success. In 1783, he embarked on a mercantile partnership with Samuel Hodgdon that failed two years later. In 1786, he moved to the Wyoming Valley in Pennsylvania where he assumed a series of offices at the head of Luzerne County. When he attempted to settle a controversy generated by John Armstrong who was antagonizing Connecticut settlers living in the area, Pickering was captured and held hostage for nineteen days. In 1787, he was part of the Pennsylvania convention held to consider ratification of the United States Constitution.

After the first of Pickering&#x27;s two successful attempts to make money speculating in Pennsylvania frontier land, President Washington appointed him commissioner to the Iroquois; and Pickering represented the United States in the negotiation of the Treaty of Canandaigua with the Iroquois in 1794.

==Cabinet member==
Washington brought Pickering into the government as Postmaster General in 1791. He remained in Washington&#x27;s cabinet and then that of John Adams for nine years, serving as postmaster general until 1795, Secretary of War for a brief time in 1795, then Secretary of State from 1795 to 1800. As Secretary of State he is most remembered for his strong Federalist Party attachments to British causes, even willingness to wage war with France in service of these causes during the Adams administration. In 1799 Pickering hired Joseph Dennie as his private secretary.

In 1799 Pickering sailed to England on the merchantman &quot;Washington&quot;. On October 24 the French privateer &quot;Bellona&quot; attacked &quot;Washington&quot;, even though she was flying American colours. Despite the French vessel being better armed and much more heavily manned, &quot;Washington&quot; succeeded in repelling the attack.

==Middle years==

After a quarrel with President John Adams over Adams&#x27;s plan to make peace with France, Pickering was dismissed from office in May 1800. After an unsuccessful run for Congress in 1802, he was named to the United States Senate as a senator from Massachusetts in 1803 as a member of the Federalist Party. In 1804, Pickering and a band of Federalists, agitated at the lack of support for Federalists, attempted to gain support for the secession of New England and New York from the Jeffersonian United States. The plan was abandoned following Aaron Burr&#x27;s defeat in the 1804 New York gubernatorial election. The irony of a Federalist moving against the national government was not lost among his dissenters. Pickering opposed the American seizure and annexation of Spanish West Florida in 1810, which he believed was both unconstitutional and an act of aggression against a friendly power.

===Attacking Embargo policy===
Near the end of his only term as a senator, Pickering challenged Jefferson&#x27;s Embargo Act, reviving his plan for a convention of the New England states to oppose the act and potentially secede from the union. He held several conferences with the special British envoy George Rose and proposed the creation of a pro-British party in New England and urged Rose to persuade British Foreign Secretary George Canning to maintain his hard line against America with the hopes that Jefferson would resort to even more extreme measures, which would ultimately effect a political suicide for the Republicans. Pickering also published his open letter to the Massachusetts Republican governor, which he refused even to read; it contained harsh criticism of the Embargo Act, claimed that Jefferson had presented no real arguments for its enactment, and called for its nullification by the state legislators. Pickering was charged with reading confidential documents in an open Senate session before an injunction of secrecy had been removed. In response to that charge, the Senate censured Pickering by a vote of 20–7 on January 2, 1811.

===Member of Congress===
Pickering was later elected to the United States House of Representatives in the 1812 election, where he remained until 1817. His congressional career is best remembered for his leadership of the New England secession movement (see Essex Junto and the Hartford Convention). He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1815.

==Later years==
After Pickering was denied re-election in 1816, he retired to Salem, where he lived as a farmer until his death in 1829, aged 83.

==Legacy==

In 1799 Fort Pickering in Salem, Massachusetts was named for him.

In 1942, a United States Liberty ship named the SS &quot;Timothy Pickering&quot; was launched. She was lost off Sicily in 1943.

Until the 1990s, Pickering&#x27;s ancestral home, the circa 1651 Pickering House, was the oldest house in the United States to be owned by the same family continually.

<doc id="465355" wikidata="Q524772" url="?curid=465355" title="Paul Martin Sr.">
<text>Joseph James Guillaume Paul Martin (June 23, 1903 – September 14, 1992), often referred to as Paul Martin Sr., was a noted Canadian politician and diplomat. He was the father of Paul Martin, who served as 21st prime minister of Canada from 2003 to 2006.

==Early life==
Martin was born in Ottawa, Ontario, the son of Lumina (née Chouinard) and Joseph Philippe Ernest Martin. His Irish Catholic paternal grandfather&#x27;s family immigrated from County Mayo, and his mother and paternal grandmother were French Canadian with deep roots in the country.

Martin contracted polio in 1907, which left him permanently blind in one eye and with a severely weakened left arm.

Martin was raised in Pembroke, Ontario, in the Ottawa River Valley, although he attended high school at Collège Saint-Alexandre in Gatineau, Quebec. He completed his university education at the University of Toronto, and earned his law degree from Osgoode Hall Law School. Later, Martin studied at the Graduate Institute of International Studies, Geneva, on a scholarship.

Martin later opened a law practice in Windsor, Ontario. In 1939-1940, Martin defended the gangster Rocco Perri at his trial for the corruption of public officials. The trial ended on 1 February 1940, with Perri being acquitted.

==Politics==

===Member of Parliament===
A member of the Liberal Party of Canada, he was first elected to the House of Commons in 1935 and entered the cabinet in 1945. He went on to serve as a noted member of the cabinets of four Prime Ministers: William Lyon Mackenzie King, Louis St. Laurent, Lester B. Pearson and Pierre Trudeau.

Martin was viewed as one of the most left-wing members of the Liberal cabinet, and as Minister of National Health and Welfare from 1946 to 1957 he played an important role in the fight against polio and overseeing the creation of hospital insurance in Canada, and is sometimes recognized as a father of medicare. Martin served as Secretary of State for External Affairs in the Pearson government, and was instrumental in the acquisition of U.S. nuclear weapons for Canadian Forces.

===Liberal leadership bids===
He ran for the Liberal leadership three times, in 1948, in 1958 and 1968, but was defeated at all three Liberal leadership conventions, first by Louis St. Laurent, then by Lester B. Pearson, then by Pierre Trudeau.

===Senator and beyond===
Trudeau appointed him to the Senate in 1968. He served as Leader of the Government in the Senate until 1974 when he was appointed High Commissioner to the United Kingdom. He also served as chancellor of Wilfrid Laurier University from 1972 to 1977, as a result of which the university named the Paul Martin Centre in his honour. Until his death Paul Martin was an adjunct professor of political science at the University of Windsor.

His two volume memoirs, &quot;A Very Public Life&quot;, was published in 1983 () and 1986 ( ).

==Honours==
In 1976 he was made a Companion of the Order of Canada. In recognition of his accomplishments, Martin was granted the right to use the honorific Right Honourable in 1992, a rare honour for one who has never been Prime Minister, Governor-General or Chief Justice of Canada. He died on September 14, at the age of eighty-nine.

The University of Windsor has a Paul Martin Chair in law and political science, recently held by former Manitoba Premier Howard Pawley (until his retirement from the university), and the Paul Martin Law Library. The City of Windsor had also renamed their &quot;Post Office Building&quot; the Paul Martin Sr. Building in his honour on November 18, 1994.

<text>The 1968 Canadian federal election was held on June 25, 1968, to elect members of the House of Commons of Canada of the 28th Parliament of Canada.

In April 1968, Prime Minister Lester Pearson of the Liberal Party resigned as party leader as a result of declining health and failing to win a majority government in two attempts. He was succeeded by his Minister of Justice and Attorney General Pierre Trudeau, who called an election immediately after becoming prime minister. Trudeau&#x27;s charisma appealed to Canadian voters; his popularity became known as &quot;Trudeaumania&quot; and helped him win a comfortable majority. Robert Stanfield&#x27;s Progressive Conservatives lost seats whereas the New Democratic Party&#x27;s support stayed the same.

==Background==

Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson had announced in December 1967 that he would retire early in the following year, calling a new leadership election for the following April to decide on a successor. In February 1968, however, Pearson&#x27;s government nearly fell before the leadership election could even take place, when it was unexpectedly defeated on a tax bill. Convention dictated that Pearson would have been forced to resign and call an election had the government been defeated on a full budget bill, but after taking legal advice, Governor General Roland Michener decreed that he would only ask for Pearson&#x27;s resignation if an explicit motion of no confidence were called in his government. Ultimately, the New Democratic Party and &quot;Ralliement créditiste&quot; were not willing to topple the government over the issue, and even had they done so, Pearson would have been entitled to advise Michener not to hold an election until after the new Liberal leader had been chosen, but the incident made it clear that Pearson&#x27;s successor could not feasibly hope to hold out until the next statutory general election date of November 1970, and would in all likelihood be forced to call an election much sooner.

Pierre Trudeau, who was a relative unknown until he was appointed to the cabinet by Pearson, won a surprise victory over Paul Martin Sr., Paul Hellyer and Robert Winters in the party&#x27;s leadership election on April 6. He was sworn in as prime minister on April 20.

==Parties and campaigns==

===Liberals===

As had been widely expected, Trudeau called an immediate election after he was sworn in as prime minister. The charismatic, intellectual, handsome, single, and fully bilingual Trudeau soon captured the hearts and minds of the nation, and the period leading up to the election saw such intense feelings for him that it was dubbed &quot;Trudeaumania.&quot; At public appearances, he was confronted by screaming girls, something never before seen in Canadian politics. The Liberal campaign was dominated by Trudeau&#x27;s personality. Liberal campaign ads featured pictures of Trudeau inviting Canadians to &quot;Come work with me&quot;, and encouraged them to &quot;Vote for New Leadership for All of Canada&quot;. The substance of the campaign was based upon the creation of a &quot;just society&quot;, with a proposed expansion of social programs.

===Progressive Conservatives===

The principal opposition to the Liberals was the Progressive Conservative Party (PC Party) led by Robert Stanfield, who had previously served as premier of Nova Scotia. The PCs started the election campaign with an internal poll showing them trailing the Liberals by 22 points.

Stanfield proposed introducing guaranteed annual income, though failed to explain the number of citizens that would be covered, the minimum income level, and the cost to implement it. Due to concerns that the term &quot;guaranteed annual income&quot; sounded socialist, he eventually switched to using the term &quot;negative income tax&quot;. These mistakes made the policy impossible for voters to understand and harmed the PCs. What also damaged the PCs was the idea of &quot;deux nations&quot; (meaning that Canada was one country housing two nations - French Canadians and English-speaking Canadians). Marcel Faribault, the PCs&#x27; Quebec lieutenant and MP candidate, was unclear on whether he supported or opposed &quot;deux nations&quot; and Stanfield did not drop him as a candidate. This led to the Liberals positioning themselves as the party that supported one Canada. In mid-June, they ran a full-page newspaper advertisement that implied that Stanfield supported &quot;deux nations&quot;; Stanfield called the ad &quot;a deliberate lie&quot; and insisted he supported one Canada.

===New Democratic Party===

On the left, former long-time Premier of Saskatchewan Tommy Douglas led the New Democratic Party, but once again failed to make the electoral break-through that was hoped for when the party was founded in 1960. Douglas gained a measure of personal satisfaction - the ouster of Diefenbaker had badly damaged the PC brand in Saskatchewan, and played a major role in allowing the NDP to overcome a decade of futility at the federal level in Saskatchewan to win a plurality of seats there. Nevertheless, these gains were balanced out by losses elsewhere in the country. Under the slogan, &quot;&quot;You&quot; win with the NDP&quot;, Douglas campaigned for affordable housing, higher old age pensions, lower prescription drug prices, and a reduced cost of living. However, the NDP had difficulty running against the left-leaning Trudeau, who was himself a former supporter of the NDP. Douglas would step down as leader in 1971, but remains a powerful icon for New Democrats.

===Leaders&#x27; debate===

This was the first Canadian federal election to hold a leaders debate, on June 9, 1968. The debate included Trudeau, Stanfield, Douglas, and in the latter part Réal Caouette, with Caouette speaking French and Trudeau alternating between the languages. A.B. Patterson, leader of the Social Credit Party was not invited to this debate. The assassination of Robert F. Kennedy three days before cast a pall over the proceedings, and the stilted format was generally seen as boring and inconclusive.

==Electoral system==
In this election, for the first time since Confederation, all the MPs were elected as the single member for their district, through First past the post. Previously some had always been elected in multi-member ridings through Block Voting. From here on, single-winner First past the post would be the only electoral system used to elect MPs.

==National results==
The results of the election were sealed when on the night before the election a riot broke out at the St. Jean Baptiste Day parade in Montreal. Protesting the prime minister&#x27;s attendance at the parade, supporters of Quebec independence yelled &quot;Trudeau au poteau&quot; [Trudeau to the gallows], and threw bottles and rocks. Trudeau, whose lack of military service during World War II had led some to question his courage, firmly stood his ground, and did not flee from the violence despite the wishes of his security escort. Images of Trudeau standing fast to the thrown bottles of the rioters were broadcast across the country, and swung the election even further in the Liberals&#x27; favour as many English-speaking Canadians believed that he would be the right leader to fight the threat of Quebec separatism.

The Social Credit Party, having lost two of the five seats it picked up at the previous election via defections (including former leader Robert N. Thompson, who defected to the Tories in March 1967), lost its three remaining seats. On the other hand, the &quot;Ralliement des créditistes&quot; (Social Credit Rally), the Québec wing of the party that had split from the English Canadian party, met with great success. The &quot;créditistes&quot; were a populist option appealing to social conservatives and Québec nationalists. They were especially strong in rural ridings and amongst poor voters. Party leader Réal Caouette campaigned against poverty, government indifference, and &quot;la grosse finance&quot; (big finance). The Canadian social credit movement would never win seats in English Canada again.

Atlantic Canada bucked the national trend, with the Tories making large gains in that region and winning pluralities in all four Atlantic provinces. In that region, the Tory brand was strengthened by the leadership of former Nova Scotian premier Stanfield. Voters in Newfoundland, who were growing increasingly weary of their Liberal administration under founding Premier Joey Smallwood, voted PC for the first time since entering Confederation.

<text>In grammar, the terminative or terminalis case (abbreviated ) is a case specifying a limit in space and time and also to convey the goal or target of an action.

==Assamese==
In the Assamese language, the terminative case is indicated by the suffix :



==Bashkir==
In the Bashkir language, the terminative case is indicated by the suffix :

However, postpositions (), (), () &#x27;till, up to&#x27; are more frequently used in Bashkir to convey this meaning.

== Classical Hebrew ==
T.J. Meek has argued that &quot;the so-called locative &quot; in Classical Hebrew &quot;is terminative only and should be renamed terminative .&quot;

==Estonian==
In the Estonian language, the terminative case is indicated by the &#x27;-ni&#x27; suffix:

*: &#x27;to the river&#x27;/&#x27;as far as the river&#x27;
*: &#x27;until six o&#x27;clock&#x27;

==Hungarian==
The Hungarian language uses the &#x27;-ig&#x27; suffix.

*: &#x27;as far as the house&#x27;
*: &#x27;until six o&#x27;clock&#x27;

If used for time, it can also show how long the action lasted.

*: &#x27;for six hours&#x27;/&#x27;six hours long&#x27;
*: &#x27;for a hundred years&#x27;

It is not always clear whether the thing in terminative case belongs to the interval in question or not.

*: &#x27;I stayed until the concert (ended or started?)&#x27; Here it is more likely that the person only stayed there until the concert began.
*: &#x27;Say a number from 1 to (until) 10.&#x27; However here 10 can be said as well.

The corresponding question word is &quot;?&quot;, which is simply the question word &quot;?&quot; (&#x27;what?&#x27;) in terminative case.

==Sumerian==
In Sumerian, the terminative case not only was used to indicate end-points in space or time but also end-points of an action itself such as its target or goal. In this latter role, it functioned much like an accusative case.

==Finnish==
The use of the postposition &quot;&quot; (or synonymously &quot;&quot;) with the illative (or allative or sublative) case in Finnish very closely corresponds to the terminative. These same postpositions with the elative (or ablative) case also express the opposite of a terminative: a limit in time or space of origination or initiation.

The old Finnish terminative &quot;-ni&quot; is no longer productive, but it appears in the Kalevala: nominative &quot;se&quot; &quot;it, that&quot; ~ terminative &quot;sini&quot; &quot;up to where&quot; = modern &quot;siihen asti&quot;, and nominative &quot;kuka&quot; &quot;who, what (poetic)&quot; ~ terminative &quot;kuni&quot; &quot;up to where&quot; = modern &quot;kuhun asti&quot;. Also, the established phrase &quot;kaikki tyynni&quot; &quot;every, until completion&quot; contains the terminative &quot;tyynni&quot;, being derived from an older form &quot;kaikki tyvennik&quot; &quot;every, up to its base&quot;, where &quot;tyvi&quot; is &quot;foot, base&quot;.

The Japanese particle (&quot;made&quot;) acts like a terminative case.

<text>Earl of Antrim is a title that has been created twice, both times in the Peerage of Ireland and both times for members of the MacDonnell family, originally of Scottish origins.

==History==
The MacDonells of Antrim descended from Sorley Boy MacDonnell, who established the family in County Antrim. His fourth son Randal MacDonnell was created Viscount Dunluce, in the County of Antrim, in 1618, and Earl of Antrim in 1620. Both titles were in the Peerage of Ireland. His eldest son, the second Earl, fought as a Royalist in the Civil War and was created Marquess of Antrim in the Peerage of Ireland in 1645. He was childless and on his death in 1682 the marquessate became extinct.

He was succeeded in the viscountcy and earldom by his younger brother, the third Earl. He represented Wigan in the English House of Commons and also served as Lord Lieutenant of Antrim. Lord Antrim was attainted in 1689 for his support of King James II but was restored in 1697. His grandson, the fifth Earl, was Governor of County Antrim. He was succeeded by his son, the sixth Earl. He represented County Antrim in the Irish House of Commons. Lord Antrim had no sons, and as there were no other male heirs left of the first Earl, the titles were heading for extinction. However, in 1785 King George III created him Viscount Dunluce and Earl of Antrim in the Peerage of Ireland, with remainder to his daughters in order of seniority and the heirs male of their bodies. In 1789 he was further honoured when he was made Marquess of Antrim in the Peerage of Ireland, with normal remainder to the heirs male of his body.

On Lord Antrim&#x27;s death in 1791 the viscountcy of Dunluce of 1618, the earldom of Antrim of 1620 and the marquessate became extinct. He was succeeded in the viscountcy and earldom of 1785 according to the special remainders by his eldest daughter Anne Catherine, the second holder of the titles. She married as her first husband Sir Henry Vane-Tempest, 2nd Baronet, of Long Newton. Their daughter Lady Frances Anne Vane-Tempest married Charles William Vane, 3rd Marquess of Londonderry, and was the great-grandmother of Prime Minister Sir Winston Churchill. Lady Antrim had no sons and was succeeded by her younger sister Charlotte, the third holder. She was the wife of Vice Admiral Lord Mark Robert Kerr, third son of William John Kerr, 5th Marquess of Lothian.

She was succeeded by her eldest surviving son, the fourth Earl. He assumed in 1836 by Royal licence the surname of McDonnell in lieu of Kerr. He had no sons and was succeeded by his younger brother, the fifth Earl. On succeeding his brother in 1855, he too assumed by Royal licence the surname of McDonnell in lieu of Kerr. the titles are held by his great-great-great-grandson, the tenth Earl, who succeeded his father in that year. As a male-line descendant of the 5th Marquess of Lothian, he is also in remainder to that Scottish peerage and its subsidiary titles.

Angus McDonnell (1881–1966), second son of the sixth Earl of the second creation, was Member of Parliament for Dartford.

The family seat is Glenarm Castle, near Glenarm, County Antrim, in Northern Ireland.

The Dunluce Cup is awarded at the Larne Music Festival by the Viscount or Viscountess Dunluce, heir to the Earl of Antrim.

The McQuillan family held Dunluce before the McDonnells, but they were overthrown during the 1500s and were not granted any peerage.

<doc id="465375" wikidata="Q1332573" url="?curid=465375" title="Verbal arithmetic">
<text>Verbal arithmetic, also known as alphametics, cryptarithmetic, cryptarithm or word addition, is a type of mathematical game consisting of a mathematical equation among unknown numbers, whose digits are represented by letters of the alphabet. The goal is to identify the value of each letter. The name can be extended to puzzles that use non-alphabetic symbols instead of letters.

The equation is typically a basic operation of arithmetic, such as addition, multiplication, or division. The classic example, published in the July 1924 issue of &quot;The Strand Magazine&quot; by Henry Dudeney, is:

formula_1

The solution to this puzzle is O = 0, M = 1, Y = 2, E = 5, N = 6, D = 7, R = 8, and S = 9.

Traditionally, each letter should represent a different digit, and (as an ordinary arithmetic notation) the leading digit of a multi-digit number must not be zero. A good puzzle should have one unique solution, and the letters should make up a phrase (as in the example above).

Verbal arithmetic can be useful as a motivation and source of exercises in the teaching of elementary algebra.

==History== 
Cryptarithmic puzzles are quite old and their inventor is unknown. An 1864 example in The American Agriculturist disproves the popular notion that it was invented by Sam Loyd. The name &quot;cryptarithm&quot; was coined by puzzlist Minos (pseudonym of Simon Vatriquant) in the May 1931 issue of Sphinx, a Belgian magazine of recreational mathematics, and was translated as &quot;cryptarithmetic&quot; by Maurice Kraitchik in 1942. In 1955, J. A. H. Hunter introduced the word &quot;alphametic&quot; to designate cryptarithms, such as Dudeney&#x27;s, whose letters form meaningful words or phrases.

== Types of cryptarithms ==

Types of cryptarithm include the alphametic, the digimetic, and the skeletal division. 

;Alphametic
: A type of cryptarithm in which a set of words is written down in the form of a long addition sum or some other mathematical problem. The object is to replace the letters of the alphabet with decimal digits to make a valid arithmetic sum.
;Digimetic
: A cryptarithm in which digits are used to represent other digits.

;Skeletal division
: A long division in which most or all of the digits are replaced by symbols (usually asterisks) to form a cryptarithm.

==Solving cryptarithms==
Solving a cryptarithm by hand usually involves a mix of deductions and exhaustive tests of possibilities. For instance the following sequence of deductions solves Dudeney&#x27;s SEND+MORE = MONEY puzzle above (columns are numbered from right to left):

formula_2

#From column 5, M = 1 since it is the only carry-over possible from the sum of two single digit numbers in column 4.
#Since there is a carry in column 5, O must be less than or equal to M (from column 4). But O cannot be equal to M, so O is less than M. Therefore O = 0.
#Since O is 1 less than M, S is either 8 or 9 depending on whether there is a carry in column 4. But if there were a carry in column 4 (generated by the addition of column 3), N would be less than or equal to O. This is impossible since O = 0. Therefore there is no carry in column 4 and S = 9.
#If there were no carry in column 3 then E = N, which is impossible. Therefore there is a carry and N = E + 1.
#If there were no carry in column 2, then ( N + R ) mod 10 = E, and N = E + 1, so ( E + 1 + R ) mod 10 = E which means ( 1 + R ) mod 10 = 0, so R = 9. But S = 9, so there must be a carry in column 2 so R = 8.
#To produce a carry in column 2, we must have D + E = 10 + Y.
#Y is at least 2 so D + E is at least 12.
#The only two pairs of available numbers that sum to at least 12 are (5,7) and (6,7) so either E = 7 or D = 7.
#Since N = E + 1, E can&#x27;t be 7 because then N = 8 = R so D = 7.
#E can&#x27;t be 6 because then N = 7 = D so E = 5 and N = 6.
#D + E = 12 so Y = 2.
Another example of TO+GO=OUT (source is unknown):

formula_3

# The sum of two biggest two-digit-numbers is 99+99=198. So O=1 and there is a carry in column 3.
# Since column 1 is on the right of all other columns, it is impossible for it to have a carry. Therefore 1+1=T, and T=2.
# As column 1 had been calculated in the last step, it is known that there isn&#x27;t a carry in column 2. But, it is also known that there is a carry in column 3 in the first step. Therefore, 2+G≥10. If G is equal to 9, U would equal 1, but this is impossible as O also equals 1. So only G=8 is possible and with 2+8=10+U, U=0.

The use of modular arithmetic often helps. For example, use of mod-10 arithmetic allows the columns of an addition problem to be treated as simultaneous equations, while the use of mod-2 arithmetic allows inferences based on the parity of the variables.

In computer science, cryptarithms provide good examples to illustrate the brute force method, and algorithms that generate all permutations of &quot;m&quot; choices from &quot;n&quot; possibilities. For example, the Dudeney puzzle above can be solved by testing all assignments of eight values among the digits 0 to 9 to the eight letters S,E,N,D,M,O,R,Y, giving 1,814,400 possibilities. They also provide good examples for backtracking paradigm of algorithm design.

==Other information==
When generalized to arbitrary bases, the problem of determining if a cryptarithm has a solution is NP-complete. (The generalization is necessary for the hardness result because in base 10, there are only 10! possible assignments of digits to letters, and these can be checked against the puzzle in linear time.)

Alphametics can be combined with other number puzzles such as Sudoku and Kakuro to create cryptic Sudoku and Kakuro.

== Longest alphametics ==
Anton Pavlis constructed an alphametic in 1983 with 41 addends:

:SO+MANY+MORE+MEN+SEEM+TO+SAY+THAT+
:THEY+MAY+SOON+TRY+TO+STAY+AT+HOME+
:SO+AS+TO+SEE+OR+HEAR+THE+SAME+ONE+
:MAN+TRY+TO+MEET+THE+TEAM+ON+THE+
:MOON+AS+HE+HAS+AT+THE+OTHER+TEN
:=TESTS

(The answer is that MANYOTHERS=2764195083.)

<text>CISV International (&quot;formerly&quot; Children&#x27;s International Summer Villages) is an international non-governmental organisation based in England that hosts camp-based programmes and events for children that aim to promote hands-on learning and intercultural friendships with a focus on peace education. Founded in 1950 in Cincinnati, Ohio, the organisation currently serves 69 countries across its 200 local chapters.

CISV International is a UNESCO partner and a Non-Governmental Organization (NGO). It holds participatory status with the Council of Europe and is a candidate member of the European Youth Forum.

==History==
CISV was founded in 1950, after World War II, by Dr. Doris Twitchell Allen. Since then, the organisation has expanded into around 69 countries, and over 300,000 delegates have participated in more than seven thousand international CISV activities since its founding. 

The first village was held in 1951 in Glendale, Ohio; commissioned for its 50th anniversary, the sculpture &quot;How Alike I Am to You” was created in 2000 by Tim Werrell and erected on the property of the Harry Whiting Brown Community Center in Glendale.

==CISV programmes==
The CISV International delivers its education through its seven official programmes:

* Village: Delegations composed of four children and one adult &quot;leader&quot; from 12 countries come together for a four-week programme for 11-year-old children, who participate in activities based around simple activities that indirectly promote peace and understanding of each other. Each delegation consists of two boys, two girls, and an adult leader. Additionally, there are five or six Junior Counsellors (JCs, age 16–17), who help bridge the gap between the adults and youth. There is also a staff (usually a group of 5-6 adults) that oversee the delegations and facilitate each event.
* Step Up: A three-week programme for participants 14–15 years of age. Delegations include 4 participants—two boys and two girls—and an adult leader. In Step Ups, participants can propose new rules for the camp, which are discussed and voted on during camp meetings. The delegates are also largely responsible for putting together activities to promote social and leadership skills. 
* Interchange: A programme that can span up to two years for participants aged 12–14. A delegation of 6–12 youths is selected from each of two participating countries. In the programme, one delegation will travel to visit for two or four weeks with the other&#x27;s family. After those weeks and a little time in between, the delegations reciprocate. Each delegation has one adult leader, and may also have a Junior Leader.
* Youth Meeting: An 8 or 15 day programme for either 12–13, 14–15, 16–18 or 19+. This programme is based on a specific theme. For youth 12–15 each delegation consists of six young people, and an adult leader. People at the age 16+ travel alone.
* Seminar Camp: A three-week programme for youth 17–18 in which there is one or more (but not more than four) delegates from each participating country. Seminar Camps have a more direct educational approach, and youth are encouraged to form opinions on various world issues. Usually youth-directed, this program has only thirty participants in total.
* International People&#x27;s Project: CISV&#x27;s newest international programme is open to people aged 19+ and is three weeks long. Participants participate in hands-on work contributing to a local community project.
* Mosaic: Mosaic is a programme that consists of projects with educational content, developed by local CISV Chapters worldwide. These projects empower individuals to be agents of change, reach out, and involve as many people as possible.

CISV Chapters also hold activities that aim to share the CISV experience within their local community.

In addition to this CISV International delivers its education through:

* Junior Branch (JB): Junior Branch is an integral, but self-governing youth-based part of the structure of CISV. Junior Branch develops intercultural skills and attitude through educational and administrative activities consistent with CISV Goals.

== CISV International, National Associations and Chapters ==

The International Office of CISV is located in Newcastle upon Tyne, England. The Secretary General of the organization is based there, along with a small team of officers and administrative staff.

CISV International is an umbrella organization, with 68 countries or National Associations (NAs). Each NA oversees and supports its local branches or Chapters. CISV USA is the largest National Association with 27 chapters.

<doc id="465387" wikidata="Q2330404" url="?curid=465387" title="Post-nominal letters">
<text>Post-nominal letters, also called post-nominal initials, post-nominal titles, designatory letters, or simply post-nominals, are letters placed after a person&#x27;s name to indicate that the individual holds a position, an academic degree, accreditation, an office, a military decoration, or honour, or is a member of a religious institute or fraternity. An individual may use several different sets of post-nominal letters, but in some contexts it may be customary to limit the number of sets to one or just a few. The order in which post-nominals are listed after a name is based on rules of precedence and what is appropriate for a given situation. Post-nominal letters are one of the main types of name suffix. In contrast, pre-nominal letters precede the name rather than following it, such as addressing a physician or professor as &quot;Dr. Smith&quot;.

== List==

Different awards and post-nominal letters are in use in the English-speaking countries.

== Usage ==

=== Listing order ===
The order in which post-nominal letters are listed after a person&#x27;s name is dictated by standard practice, which may vary by region and context.

==== In Australia ====
Various University Style Guides, such as: the University of Sydney Style Guide and the Australian Government Style Manual and that of the various State Governments.

Outside of any specific academic or State or Federal Government requirement, then in the following order:

# Those Honours promulgated by the Governor-General in the Commonwealth Government Gazette, e.g. Current National and former Imperial honours
# Those Honours and Appointments promulgated by a State Governor or Territory Administrator in the relevant State Government Gazette, e.g. Fellows of the Royal Society of NSW (FRSN), King&#x27;s Counsels (KC).
# All honorary degrees included in an Australian university&#x27;s Annual Report to an Australian Parliament.
# Fellowships and memberships of professional bodies and learned societies incorporated by a statutory instrument i.e. a Royal Charter under the Australian (not a foreign) Crown (e.g. the Australian Academy of Science, the Australian Academy of the Humanities, the Institution of Engineers Australia, the Australian Institute of Building, and the Australian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy) or an Act of Parliament (such as the Bar Associations of some States)
# Parliamentary designations
# Foreign Honours where permitted by Australian Federal Minister for Foreign Affairs.
# Fellowships and memberships of other Australian Professional Institutions.
# Australian Qualifications, ideally with date and institution, in descending order (with the highest closest after the name).
# Foreign Professional Memberships.
# Foreign Qualifications.

====In Canada====
The Canadian government&#x27;s &quot;The Canadian Style&quot; specifies that no more than two sets of post-nominal letters should normally be given, unless all are to be given either for information or for reasons of protocol, and that these should be the two highest of different types. The types and the order in which they are given are:

# Distinctions conferred directly by the Crown
# University degrees
# Memberships of societies and other distinctions

==== In European fraternities ====
Going back to the mid 17th century, today&#x27;s classical European fraternities such as the German Student Corps have used post-nominal symbols and letters to allow their members to indicate their fraternity membership and honorary positions held in their signature.

==== Order of post-nominals in the UK ====
=====Civil usage in the UK=====

In the United Kingdom various sources have issued guidance on the ordering of styles and titles for British citizens, including the Ministry of Justice, Debrett&#x27;s and A &amp; C Black&#x27;s &quot;Titles and Forms of Address&quot;; these are generally in close agreement, with the exception of the position of MP, etc., in the listing:
# Bt/Bart or Esq;
#* In the UK, &quot;Esq.&quot; may refer to any gentleman in place of the pre-nominal Mr or Dr;
# British Orders and decorations (e.g. OBE; in descending order of precedence);
# Crown Appointments, i.e.:
# University degrees:
#* According to Debrett&#x27;s, DD, MD and MS degrees are always given; other doctorates, other medical degrees, and other divinity degrees are sometimes given; and other degrees are seldom shown, with BA and MA never used socially (although formal lists may include them);
#   
# According to Debrett&#x27;s and Black&#x27;s: Member of Parliament (MP), etc. (Black&#x27;s also includes Writers to the Signet here);
# Membership of the Armed Forces (e.g. RAF, RN, VR, RM, RMP) (not included by Black&#x27;s).

In addition, British citizens who have received honours from Commonwealth countries are usually given permission from the King to use the postnominals for that honour.

=====Academic usage in the UK=====

The Oxford University Style Guide and the University of Nottingham Style Guide give the alternative ordering:

# Civil honours
# Military honours
# KC
# Degrees in the order:
## Bachelor&#x27;s 
## Master&#x27;s 
## Doctorates
## Postdoctoral
# Diplomas
# Certificates
# Membership of academic or professional bodies

This differs from the civil ordering in that it omits appointments except for KC, includes diplomas and certificates in addition to degrees, merges medical qualifications, fellowships of learned societies, royal academicians, and membership of professional bodies into a single item, and omits membership of the armed forces.

Loughborough University gives a very similar ordering, but with &quot;Appointments (e.g MP, KC)&quot; replacing item 3 (KC) and &quot;Higher Education awards (in ascending order, commencing with undergraduate)&quot; replacing items 4–6 (degrees, diplomas and certificates). This restores the Appointments section from the civil list omitted by Oxford and Nottingham, although the other differences remain.

Nottingham Trent University gives essentially the same ordering as Oxford and Nottingham, but without specifying the order in which degrees should be given. Nottingham Trent, Oxford and Loughborough recommend degree abbreviations be given in mixed case without stops between the letters (e.g. BA, not B.A.; PhD, not Ph.D.), as does Cambridge. Imperial College London, however, uses all small caps for post-nominals (e.g. , not PhD).

Where all degrees are shown, as in university calendars, most universities will give these in ascending order. However, advice on the precise ordering varies:
* The Oxford University Calendar Style Guide places degrees in the order: bachelor&#x27;s degrees (including postgraduate bachelor&#x27;s degrees such as the Oxford BCL) and other first degrees; master&#x27;s degrees (including those that are first degrees, such as MPhys); doctorates; higher doctorates in order of academic precedence. Degrees at the same level are ordered alphabetically by awarding institution and multiple degrees from the same institution are grouped, with position determined by the lowest degree in the grouping. Certificates and diplomas are listed after degrees (no mention is made of foundation degrees). Oxford recommends giving institution names separated by a space from the degree, not enclosed in parentheses, and that degrees from the same institution be separated by spaces only, with commas between degrees from different institutions.
* Loughborough University advises listing all higher education awards in ascending order starting from undergraduate, so MPhys would come before BCL and postgraduate certificates and diplomas would come between undergraduate and postgraduate degrees. The examples given do not include institution names.

==== Order of post-nominals in the United States ====

In the United States, standard protocol is to list post-nominal letters in the following order:

# Religious institutions
# Theological degrees
# Military decorations
# Academic degrees
# Honorary degrees, honors, decorations
# Professional licenses, certifications and affiliations
# Retired uniformed service.

Active duty services personnel do not use any post-nominals other than, if applicable, Staff Corps affiliation (Navy only) followed by a comma and then their branch of service. Names are bracketed by the appropriate pre-nominal and post-nominal, e.g. LCDR John Q Public, MC, USN.

=== Etiquette for higher educational qualifications ===

==== Higher education qualifications in the UK ====

In the UK, it is usual to list only doctorates, degrees in medicine, and degrees in divinity. In particular, when a person has letters indicating Crown honours or decorations, only the principal degree would normally be given. The University of Oxford Style Guide advises writers: &quot;Remember that you do not need to list all awards, degrees, memberships etc held by an individual – only those items relevant to your writing.&quot;

In an academic context, or in formal lists, all degrees may be listed in ascending order of academic status, which may not be the same as the order in which they were obtained (although see notes on medical qualifications, below). The Oxford style is to list qualifications by their title starting with bachelor&#x27;s degrees, then master&#x27;s degrees, then doctorates. Postgraduate Certificates and Diplomas are listed after doctorates, but before professional qualifications, with a similar ordering being used by other universities. In this style, foundation degrees and other sub-bachelor qualifications are not shown. An alternative style is to give all higher education qualifications, starting from undergraduate, ordered by their level rather than their title. In this style, one might list a Certificate or Diploma of Higher Education first, then foundation degrees, first degrees at bachelor level, first degrees at master level (integrated master&#x27;s degrees and first degrees in medicine), postgraduate degrees at master level (including postgraduate bachelor&#x27;s degrees such the Oxford BCL), and doctorates. In this style, postgraduate certificates and diplomas could be shown either before postgraduate degrees at master&#x27;s level (as in the table given by Loughborough University) or before first degrees at master&#x27;s level (reflecting their position in the Frameworks for Higher Education Qualifications of UK Degree-Awarding Bodies). Strictly speaking, both the Debrett&#x27;s and Ministry of Justice lists only allow for the inclusion of degrees, not non-degree academic awards.

For someone with a substantive doctorate, it is usual either to give &quot;Dr&quot; as the title (without a stop per normal British usage) or to list their degrees post-nominally, e.g. &quot;Dr John Smith&quot; or &quot;John Smith, PhD&quot; but not &quot;Dr John Smith, PhD&quot;. Postnominals may be used with other titles, e.g. &quot;Mr John Smith, PhD&quot;, &quot;Sir John Smith, PhD&quot;, or &quot;The Rev John Smith, PhD&quot;.

In the case of a BA from Oxford, Cambridge or Dublin who proceeds to be an MA of those universities (which is taken without further study), the MA replaces the BA and thus only the MA should be listed. Oxford has said that there is no risk of confusion between their MA and &quot;earned&quot; MAs as the Oxford MA is denoted &quot;MA (Oxon)&quot; rather than simply MA. However, Debrett&#x27;s has advised using just &quot;MA&quot; to describe a Cambridge Master of Arts.

Graduates from British and Irish universities sometimes add the name of the university that awarded their degree after the post-nominals for their degree, either in parentheses or not, depending on preferred style. University names are often abbreviated and sometimes given in Latin, e.g.&quot;BA, MA (Dunelm), PhD (Ebor)&quot;; a list of abbreviations used for university names can be found at Universities in the United Kingdom#Post-nominal abbreviations. Where the same degree has been granted by more than one university, this can be shown by placing the names or abbreviations in a single bracket after the degree name, e.g. &quot;, Mus.D. (Oxon., Cantab., Dunelm. et Yale, U.S.A.), LL.D. (Leeds, Aberdeen, and W. University, Pennsylvania.)&quot;.

Honorary degrees, if shown, can be indicated either by &quot;Hon&quot; before the post-nominals for the degree or &quot;hc&quot; (for &quot;honoris causa&quot;) after the post-nominals, e.g. &quot;Professor Evelyn Algernon Valentine Ebsworth CBE, PhD, MA, ScD, DCL hc, FRSC, FRSE&quot; (emphasis added); &quot;Professor Stephen Hawking Hon.ScD, CH, CBE, FRS&quot; (emphasis added). The Oxford University Calendar Style Guide recommends not giving honorary degrees in post-nominals.

==== Higher education qualifications in the US ====
In academia and research, all degrees may be listed. In general, however, it is normal to only list those relevant to the circumstance. For example, if Jane Doe had a BS, MS, and PhD in computer science as well as an MBA, then if working in management in a retail company she would write &quot;Jane Doe, MBA&quot;, but if working in an IT company she might write &quot;Jane Doe, PhD&quot;, and if working in academia she could write &quot;Jane Doe, BS, MS, MBA, PhD&quot;.

The Gregg Reference Manual recommends placing periods between the letters of post-nominals (e.g., &quot;B.S.&quot;, &quot;Ph.D.&quot;); however, The Chicago Manual of Style recommends writing degrees without periods (e.g., &quot;BS&quot;, &quot;PhD&quot;). If post-nominals are given, the full name should be used, without Dr., Mr., Ms., Mrs., or Miss. Other prefixes (e.g., &quot;Professor&quot;) may be used.

=== Etiquette for medical qualifications===

====Medical qualifications in the UK====

In contrast to the style for academic qualifications, medical qualifications are listed in &quot;descending&quot; order, i.e.: doctorates, master&#x27;s degrees, bachelor&#x27;s degrees, postgraduate diplomas, and qualifying diplomas. Letters indicating doctorates, master&#x27;s degrees and fellowships of royal colleges are always given, while bachelor&#x27;s degrees, memberships and qualifying diplomas are only shown for people with no higher qualifications. In all but formal lists, only three medical qualifications are normally given.

Where someone holds qualifications in multiple fields, they are normally given in the order: medicine, surgery (except for MRCS, which is considered a qualifying diploma), obstetrics, gynaecology and other specialities. These are followed by qualifying diplomas and other diplomas.

The academic style guides do not have a separate section for medical qualifications, so if following one of these guides, medical degrees should be listed with other degrees, medical diplomas with other diplomas, and fellowships and memberships of royal colleges with other fellowships and memberships of professional bodies.

=== Etiquette for fellowships or memberships ===

==== Learned societies and professional bodies in Africa ====
In Africa, learned societies and professional bodies use designatory letters for their members and fellowships. For example:

* An Associate of the African Planning Society uses the post-nominal AAPS, e.g. &quot;George Kumba AAPS.&quot; A Member of the African Planning Society is entitled to use the post-nominal, MAPS, e.g. &quot;Archimedes Muzenda MAPS.&quot; A Fellow of the African Planning Society is entitled to use postnominals, FAPS, e.g. &quot;Innocent Chirisa FAPS.&quot;
* A Member of the Forestry Society of Kenya (FSK), a non-governmental professional membership organization of Kenyan Foresters, is entitled to use the post-nominal, MFSK, e.g. &quot;Charity Kosgei MFSK.&quot;

====Learned societies, royal academies and professional institutions in the UK====

In the UK there is, according to Debrett&#x27;s, no defined order of precedence for placing designatory letters for fellowships of learned societies and memberships of professional bodies within their respective groups. Debrett&#x27;s suggests that &quot;In practice, where one society is indisputably of greater importance than another the letters are usually placed in that order. Alternatively, the fellowship of the junior society may be omitted. If such precedence cannot be determined, the letters may be placed in order of conferment. Where this is not known, they may be placed in alphabetical order.&quot; Earlier guidance that &quot;Strictly speaking, they should be arranged according to date of foundation or incorporation of the societies concerned&quot; has now been removed.

Only postnominals indicating honorific fellowships (e.g., FRS, FBA, FREng) are normally used socially. For professional bodies it is usual to list those most relevant to a person&#x27;s profession first, or those most relevant to the particular circumstances. It is common to omit fellowships (except honorific fellowships) and memberships that are not relevant in a given situation.

Debrett&#x27;s notes that although Royal Academicians are listed after fellows of learned societies (and before members of professional bodies), they do not yield to them in precedence, &quot;In practice the two lists do not coincide.&quot;

The distinction between a learned society and a professional body is not well defined. Many organisations (e.g., the Royal Society of Chemistry) claim to be both learned societies and professional bodies. However, it is clear from both the Ministry of Justice and Debrett&#x27;s that only &quot;fellowships&quot; of learned societies are listed, while &quot;fellowships and memberships&quot; may be listed for professional bodies.

==Examples==

Examples of post-nominal letters:
* A Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire is authorised to use the post-nominal KBE, e.g. &quot;Sir Terry Wogan KBE DL&quot; (DL indicating he was Deputy Lieutenant of Buckinghamshire).
* A Fellow of the Royal Society uses the post-nominal FRS and a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh FRSE, e.g. &quot;Professor Malcolm Longair CBE, FRS, FRSE&quot; (CBE indicating he is also a Commander of the Order of the British Empire).
* A Doctor of Philosophy may use the post-nominal PhD or DPhil (according to the usage of the awarding institution), or the pre-nominals Dr or Dr., e.g. Indiana Jones could be styled &quot;Dr. Henry Walton Jones, Jr.&quot; or &quot;Henry Walton Jones, Jr., PhD&quot;, but not &quot;Dr. Henry Walton Jones, Jr., PhD&quot;.
* A Postgraduate Diploma is indicated by the post-nominals PgDip. Someone with a BA, MA and postgraduate diploma could write &quot;BA PgDip MA&quot; or (following the Oxford Calendar&#x27;s style) &quot;BA MA PgDip&quot;.
* Commonly seen postnominals for religious orders include OFM for the Franciscans (Order of Friars Minor), SJ for the Jesuits (Society of Jesus), e.g. &quot;Jorge Bergoglio, SJ, and OP for the Dominicans (Order of Preachers); most other Catholic religious institutes have specific post-nominal letters.
* A BA graduate of the Open University could indicate the university from which they got their degree using &quot;BA (Open)&quot; or &quot;BA Open&quot;.
* Someone with a BSc from Cardiff, an MSc from London and a PhD from Cardiff could write &quot;BSc PhD Card, MSc Lond&quot;, or &quot;BSc Card, MSc Lond, PhD Card&quot;; alternatively they could choose to omit the lower degrees and simply write &quot;PhD Card&quot; (&quot;London&quot; may be substituted for &quot;Lond&quot; and &quot;Cardiff&quot; for &quot;Card&quot;, and institution names could be enclosed in parentheses). If not indicating the awarding universities, they would write &quot;BSc MSc PhD&quot;, or simply &quot;PhD&quot;.
* A member of the British parliament may use the postnominals &quot;MP&quot;, e.g. &quot;Caroline Lucas MP&quot;. Note the post-nominals MP may not be used once someone ceases to be a Member of Parliament, including after Parliament has been dissolved for an election.
* A peer who is a member of the Privy Council may use the postnominals &quot;PC&quot;; for non-peers, the pre-nominal &quot;Right Honourable&quot;, abbreviated &quot;Rt Hon&quot;, identifies them as members. Thus: &quot;The Rt Hon David Cameron&quot;, but &quot;The Rt Hon Earl Grey KG PC&quot; (KG indicating he was also a Knight of the Garter).
* Chartered status is shown before the relevant professional membership, e.g. &quot;Prof. Dame Carole Jordan DBE FRS CPhys FInstP&quot;, where DBE indicates Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire, FRS Fellow of the Royal Society, CPhys Chartered Physicist, and FInstP Fellow of the Institute of Physics, the awarding body for CPhys.
* In the UK, someone who earned a BA, MA and BSc in that order would normally write &quot;BA, BSc, MA&quot;, but in Australia they would normally write &quot;BA, MA, BSc&quot;.
* &quot;Reverend Canon Mark Tanner MA (Oxon), BA (Hons), MTh&quot; demonstrates: 1) the use of &#x27;(Oxon)&#x27; to indicate an Oxbridge MA (to avoid confusion with an earned MA); 2) the use of &#x27;(Hons)&#x27; to indicate an honours degree; 3) ordering of degrees by date gained.
*In Belgium, the persons officially admitted to the Royal Association of Descendants of the Seven Noble Houses of Brussels are entitled to place the post-nominal initials PB (Patricius Bruxellensis) or - in case they hold a title of nobility - NBP (Nobilis Patricius Bruxellensis) behind their name.

<text>is a fighting game series originally released for the Neo Geo platform in the early 1990s. It is the second fighting game franchise created by SNK, following the &quot;Fatal Fury&quot; series, and is set in the same fictional universe. The original &quot;Art of Fighting&quot; was released in 1992, followed by two sequels: &quot;Art of Fighting 2&quot; in 1994 and &quot;Art of Fighting 3: The Path of the Warrior&quot; in 1996. A new &quot;Art of Fighting&quot; game is currently in development.

==Games==
===&quot;Art of Fighting&quot; (1992)===

Taking place in 1978, Ryo Sakazaki and Robert Garcia set out to find Ryo&#x27;s sister, Yuri, who has been kidnapped by Mr. Big. Mr. Big has taken the girl to entice Takuma Sakazaki, Ryo&#x27;s father and originator of the fictional form of karate known as Kyokugen Karate (&quot;Extreme style&quot;), and because Ryo refused to work for Big. After they defeat Mr. Big, Ryo and Robert face the enigmatic Mr. Karate. &quot;Art of Fighting&quot;″s story ends with a cliff-hanger; Yuri is about to disclose the true identity of Mr. Karate as their father Takuma.

Ryo and Robert are the only playable heroes in the single player story mode, although eight of the game&#x27;s ten fighters are playable by default in the two player versus mode. Mr. Big and Mr. Karate can be played in the Neo Geo MVS (arcade) version by reaching their respective stages in the game then having a second player join in, and in the Neo Geo AES (console) version through the use of cheat codes.

&quot;Art of Fighting&quot;″s events are referenced often in the wider SNK universe; &quot;The King of Fighters &#x27;97&quot;, for instance, parodies the events of the game in its ending.

In the United States, the &quot;RePlay&quot; arcade charts listed &quot;Art of Fighting&quot; as the top-grossing software conversion kit in December 1992.

A Sharp X68000 version of &quot;Art of Fighting&quot; was in development by Magical Company but it went unreleased for unknown reasons.

===&quot;Art of Fighting 2&quot; (1994)===
===&quot;Art of Fighting 3: The Path of the Warrior&quot; (1996)===

&quot;Art of Fighting 3: The Path of the Warrior&quot; was the first game in the series (and the first SNK fighting game) to use motion capture for its animation, often being noted as some of the best sprite-work SNK has produced. It features a new cast of characters with the exception of Ryo and Robert. Yuri Sakazaki is seen in the game, but only as a side character in Ryo and Robert&#x27;s story mode.
The story switched focus from the Sakazakis to Robert Garcia. Robert disappears to search for an old childhood friend, Freia Lawrence, and he tracks her to Glasshill Valley, Mexico. Freia is wanted by the game&#x27;s main antagonist, Tom Wyler, to complete a powerful elixir that was created by his and Freia&#x27;s fathers.

===Upcoming &quot;Art of Fighting&quot; game===
&quot;The King of Fighters&quot; game designer Toyohisa Tanabe wanted to worked on a new &quot;Art of Fighting&quot; after playing its third installment with &quot;The King of Fighters &#x27;96&quot; engine but was not given permission.

At Evo 2024, following similar revivals of the &quot;Samurai Shodown&quot; and &quot;Fatal Fury&quot; series, SNK announced they were developing a new entry in the &quot;Art of Fighting&quot; series, marking the series&#x27; first new entry in nearly 30 years.

===Ports and compilations===
The original trilogy were all released for the Neo Geo MVS arcade system, Neo Geo AES home console, and Neo Geo CD. &quot;Art of Fighting&quot; was ported to the PC Engine CD, SNES, and Sega Genesis/Mega Drive, while &quot;Art of Fighting 2&quot; was also ported to Super Famicom. Many of these ports made minor changes to the gameplay, story, or graphics.

The Neo Geo trilogy was compiled in for the PlayStation 2, while the original game was also included as part of &quot;SNK Arcade Classics Vol. 1&quot; and the NEOGEO Station service. The trilogy has also been digitally re-released via the Wii Virtual Console and the &quot;ACA Neo Geo&quot; series.

==Gameplay==
The &quot;Art of Fighting&quot; series follows the conventions of the time in the sense that the player faces a variety of opponents in best two-out-of-three matches. Each of the game&#x27;s characters have a unique fighting style and set of special techniques. The player has two basic attacks—punch and kick—as well as a utility button that switches between punches, kicks, and throws. A fourth button is used for taunting. &quot;Art of Fighting&quot;″s contribution to the genre was the inclusion of a &quot;spirit gauge&quot; underneath the character&#x27;s life bar. When characters perform special techniques, their spirit gauge is depleted and their special attacks become weaker. Players can also drain their opponent&#x27;s spirit gauge by taunting them.

The &quot;Art of Fighting&quot; series was also the first fighting series to allow players to perform a &quot;super attack&quot;. In the original &quot;Art of Fighting&quot;, the player&#x27;s character can learn a super attack (dubbed the &quot;super death blow&quot;) by completing one of the game&#x27;s bonus rounds (this technique is available by default in the 3rd game). All three games also feature &quot;Desperation Attacks&quot; that can only be performed when the player&#x27;s health is low and the life bar is flashing.

The series also introduced graphical scaling into the fighting game genre: as the characters move towards each other, the camera zooms in to maximize the level of detail. Character sprites in &quot;Art of Fighting&quot; change as the fight progresses to become more bruised and cut as damage is taken.

==Plot==

The &quot;Art of Fighting&quot; series serves as a prequel to the &quot;Fatal Fury&quot; series, with the three games taking place between 1978 and 1980, over a decade before the events of &quot;Fatal Fury: King of Fighters&quot;. The initial two games are set in South Town, the same setting as the &quot;Fatal Fury&quot; series, while the third takes place in the fictional Mexican town of Glasshill Valley.

Many characters from both &quot;Art of Fighting&quot; and &quot;Fatal Fury&quot; appear in &quot;The King of Fighters&quot; series, which is set in its own universe that ignores the continuity established in the &quot;Art of Fighting&quot; and &quot;Fatal Fury&quot; games so that the characters from both series could battle without having to age any of them.

==Reception and cultural impact==
Yuri has been well received by Japanese gamers, having been voted as the 19th favorite character in the 1997 character popularity poll on &quot;Neo Geo Freak&quot;&#x27;s website. In 1995, Japanese magazine &quot;Gamest&quot; ranked her as number seven in the list of the top characters of 1994. In 2018, Yuri was voted as the tenth most popular Neo Geo character. Tiago O. Frosi from Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul regarded Yuri as one of the most impactful female characters in fighting game history due to how she initially debuts as a damsel in distress only to become a playable character both in the sequel and SNK&#x27;s crossover video games. She was compared with &quot;Street Fighter&quot; character Sakura Kasugano for having similar archetypes as well as an imitated fighting style from veteran fighters.

Gavin Jasper of &quot;Den of Geek&quot; described her as adding to her family&#x27;s &quot;wonderful comedic existence&quot;, but felt she was more at place there than in King of Fighters as part of the Women&#x27;s Team. He added &quot;She&#x27;s not quite Sakura and she&#x27;s not quite Dan Hibiki, but she&#x27;s fine for what she is,&quot; and praised her departure from a damsel in distress to a full character as the games progressed.

==In other media==
===Video games===
Some of the &quot;Art of Fighting&quot; cast have continued appearing in other SNK fighting games since the last game in the &quot;Art of Fighting&quot; series was released. In the same way that Geese Howard appears as a secret boss in &quot;Art of Fighting 2&quot;, Ryo Sakazaki appears as a secret boss in &quot;Fatal Fury Special&quot; and &quot;Fatal Fury: Wild Ambition&quot;. Unlike the battle against Geese in &quot;Art of Fighting 2&quot;, the battles against Ryo in both games are depicted as &quot;dream matches&quot; and are not canonical to either series&#x27; storyline.

As a result of these crossover appearances between the two franchises, SNK produced &quot;The King of Fighters&quot; series, pitting characters from both series against each other. The series eschews the continuity of the &quot;Art of Fighting&quot; and &quot;Fatal Fury&quot; games for the purpose of having the &quot;Art of Fighting&quot; cast fight against everyone else without aging them. Ryo, Robert, Yuri, and King were introduced in the first installment and have appeared in nearly every entry, with Takuma and Kasumi frequently appearing as well. Eiji and Mr. Big also appear as playable characters in specific entries.

Characters from the series have also appeared in the &quot;SNK vs. Capcom&quot; series and in &quot;NeoGeo Battle Coliseum&quot;. Capcom&#x27;s &quot;Capcom vs. SNK: Millennium Fight 2000&quot; features Ryo, Yuri, and King while &quot;Capcom vs. SNK 2&quot; adds Ryuhaku Todoh to the lineup. &quot;SNK vs. Capcom: SVC Chaos&quot; features Ryo, Kasumi, and Takuma under his Mr. Karate guise. &quot;NeoGeo Battle Coliseum&quot; features Lee Pai Long, Mr. Big and an aged Robert Garcia along with the older Ryo Sakazaki from &quot;Buriki One&quot;. In &quot;&quot;, Ryuhaku Todoh drives the truck in one of the extra games.

The &quot;Street Fighter&quot; character Dan Hibiki is a parody of Ryo Sakazaki and Robert Garcia.

In &quot;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate&quot;, some elements from the &quot;Art of Fighting&quot; series appear as downloadable content; specifically, two music tracks from the series appear (and can be played on the King of Fighters Stadium stage), Ryo Sakazaki makes three cameos in the game (as a background character in King of Fighters Stadium, as a spirit, and as the basis for a Mii costume), and Yuri Sakazaki and King both have background cameos in King of Fighters Stadium.

===Film===
A Japanese animated television film, , was created and directed by Hiroshi Fukutomi, animated by Studio Comet and produced by NAS. It was the third animated co-production between SNK and NAS, following &quot;Fatal Fury: Legend of the Hungry Wolf&quot; and &quot;Fatal Fury 2: The New Battle&quot;. The special was produced by Kenji Shimizu and Yoshiro Kataoka, and features a script by Nobuaki Kishima and character designs by Kazunori Iwakura. The film follows follows Ryo and Robert, who must rescue Yuri from Mr. Big after he kidnaps her to learn the whereabouts of a valuable diamond. The film aired on Fuji TV on December 23, 1993, and received an English-language release from US Manga Corps in 1997.

The &quot;Art of Fighting&quot; film was negatively received by several western publications. It was billed as stupid, idiotic and plodding, and compared to a Saturday morning cartoon. It was said it had &quot;choppy animation, illogical perspectives, uninspired art, badly choreographed fight scenes, and most of all horrible voice acting&quot;, and none of the interest of the video game or its sequels translate into the anime. The film gathered a 14% rating at Meta Anime Reviews, placing it in the bottom 3% of the reviewed titles.

The 2010 live-action film &quot;The King of Fighters&quot; features an appearance by Mr. Big, played by Sam Hargrave. He is the only character from the &quot;Art of Fighting&quot; series to appear in the film.

<text>An opto-isolator (also called an optocoupler, photocoupler, or optical isolator) is an electronic component that transfers electrical signals between two isolated circuits by using light. Opto-isolators prevent high voltages from affecting the system receiving the signal. Commercially available opto-isolators withstand input-to-output voltages up to 10 kV and voltage transients with speeds up to 25 kV/μs.

A common type of opto-isolator consists of an LED and a phototransistor in the same opaque package. Other types of source-sensor combinations include LED-photodiode, LED-LASCR, and lamp-photoresistor pairs. Usually opto-isolators transfer digital (on-off) signals and can act as an electronic switch, but some techniques allow them to be used with analog signals.

==History==
The value of optically coupling a solid state light emitter to a semiconductor detector for the purpose of electrical isolation was recognized in 1963 by Akmenkalns, et al. (US patent 3,417,249). Photoresistor-based opto-isolators were introduced in 1968. They are the slowest, but also the most linear isolators and still retain a niche market in the audio and music industries. Commercialization of LED technology in 1968–1970 caused a boom in optoelectronics, and by the end of the 1970s the industry developed all principal types of opto-isolators. The majority of opto-isolators on the market use bipolar silicon phototransistor sensors. They attain medium data transfer speed, sufficient for applications like electroencephalography. The fastest opto-isolators use PIN diodes in photoconductive mode.

==Operation==
An opto-isolator contains a source (emitter) of light, almost always a near infrared light-emitting diode (LED), that converts electrical input signal into light, a closed optical channel (also called dielectrical channel), and a photosensor, which detects incoming light and either generates electric energy directly, or modulates electric current flowing from an external power supply. The sensor can be a photoresistor, a photodiode, a phototransistor, a silicon-controlled rectifier (SCR) or a triac. Since LEDs can sense light in addition to emitting it, construction of symmetrical, bidirectional opto-isolators is possible. An optocoupled solid-state relay contains a photodiode opto-isolator which drives a power switch, usually a complementary pair of MOSFETs. A slotted optical switch contains a source of light and a sensor, but its optical channel is open, allowing modulation of light by external objects obstructing the path of light or reflecting light into the sensor.

==Electric isolation==


Electronic equipment and signal and power transmission lines can be subjected to voltage surges induced by lightning, electrostatic discharge, radio frequency transmissions, switching pulses (spikes) and perturbations in power supply. Remote lightning strikes can induce surges up to 10 kV, one thousand times more than the voltage limits of many electronic components. A circuit can also incorporate high voltages by design, in which case it needs safe, reliable means of interfacing its high-voltage components with low-voltage ones.

The main function of an opto-isolator is to block such high voltages and voltage transients, so that a surge in one part of the system will not disrupt or destroy the other parts. Historically, this function was delegated to isolation transformers, which use inductive coupling between galvanically isolated input and output sides. Transformers and opto-isolators are the only two classes of electronic devices that offer &quot;reinforced protection&quot; — they protect both the equipment &quot;and&quot; the human user operating this equipment. They contain a single physical isolation barrier, but provide protection equivalent to double isolation. Safety, testing and approval of opto-couplers are regulated by national and international standards: IEC 60747-5-2, EN (CENELEC) 60747-5-2, UL 1577, CSA Component Acceptance Notice #5, etc. Opto-isolator specifications published by manufacturers always follow at least one of these regulatory frameworks.

An opto-isolator connects input and output sides with a beam of light modulated by input current. It transforms useful input signal into light, sends it across the dielectric channel, captures light on the output side and transforms it back into electric signal. Unlike transformers, which pass energy in both directions with very low losses, opto-isolators are unidirectional (see exceptions) and they cannot transmit &quot;power&quot;. Typical opto-isolators can only modulate the flow of energy already present on the output side. Unlike transformers, opto-isolators can pass DC or slow-moving signals and do not require matching impedances between input and output sides. Both transformers and opto-isolators are effective in breaking ground loops, common in industrial and stage equipment, caused by high or noisy return currents in ground wires.

The physical layout of an opto-isolator depends primarily on the desired isolation voltage. Devices rated for less than a few kV have planar (or sandwich) construction. The sensor die is mounted directly on the lead frame of its package (usually, a six-pin or a four-pin dual in-line package). The sensor is covered with a sheet of glass or clear plastic, which is topped with the LED die. The LED beam fires downward. To minimize losses of light, the useful absorption spectrum of the sensor must match the output spectrum of the LED, which almost invariably lies in the near infrared. The optical channel is made as thin as possible for a desired breakdown voltage. For example, to be rated for short-term voltages of 3.75 kV and transients of 1 kV/μs, the clear polyimide sheet in the Avago ASSR-300 series is only 0.08 mm thick. Breakdown voltages of planar assemblies depend on the thickness of the transparent sheet and the configuration of bonding wires that connect the dies with external pins. Real in-circuit isolation voltage is further reduced by creepage over the PCB and the surface of the package. Safe design rules require a minimal clearance of 25 mm/kV for bare metal conductors or 8.3 mm/kV for coated conductors.

Opto-isolators rated for 2.5 to 6 kV employ a different layout called &quot;silicone dome&quot;. Here, the LED and sensor dies are placed on the opposite sides of the package; the LED fires into the sensor horizontally. The LED, the sensor and the gap between them are encapsulated in a blob, or dome, of transparent silicone. The dome acts as a reflector, retaining all stray light and reflecting it onto the surface of the sensor, minimizing losses in a relatively long optical channel. In &quot;double mold&quot; designs the space between the silicone blob (&quot;inner mold&quot;) and the outer shell (&quot;outer mold&quot;) is filled with dark dielectric compound with a matched coefficient of thermal expansion.

==Types of opto-isolators==

===Resistive opto-isolators===
The earliest opto-isolators, originally marketed as &quot;light cells&quot;, emerged in the 1960s. They employed miniature incandescent light bulbs as sources of light, and cadmium sulfide (CdS) or cadmium selenide (CdSe) photoresistors (also called light-dependent resistors, LDRs) as receivers. In applications where control linearity was not important, or where available current was too low for driving an incandescent bulb (as was the case in vacuum tube amplifiers), it was replaced with a neon lamp. These devices (or just their LDR component) were commonly named &quot;Vactrols&quot;, after a trademark of Vactec, Inc. The trademark has since been genericized, but the original Vactrols are still being manufactured by PerkinElmer.

The turn-on and turn-off lag of an incandescent bulb lies in hundreds of milliseconds range, which makes the bulb an effective low-pass filter and rectifier but limits the practical modulation frequency range to a few Hertz. With the introduction of light-emitting diodes (LEDs) in 1968–1970, the manufacturers replaced incandescent and neon lamps with LEDs and achieved response times of 5 milliseconds and modulation frequencies up to 250 Hz. The name &quot;Vactrol&quot; was carried over on LED-based devices which are, as of 2010, still produced in small quantities.

Photoresistors used in opto-isolators rely on bulk effects in a uniform film of semiconductor; there are no p-n junctions. Uniquely among photosensors, photoresistors are non-polar devices suited for either AC or DC circuits. Their resistance drops in reverse proportion to the intensity of incoming light, from virtually infinity to a residual floor that may be as low as less than a hundred Ohms. These properties made the original Vactrol a convenient and cheap automatic gain control and compressor for telephone networks. The photoresistors easily withstood voltages up to 400 volts, which made them ideal for driving vacuum fluorescent displays. Other industrial applications included photocopiers, industrial automation, professional light measurement instruments and auto-exposure meters. Most of these applications are now obsolete, but resistive opto-isolators retained a niche in audio, in particular guitar amplifier, markets.

American guitar and organ manufacturers of the 1960s embraced the resistive opto-isolator as a convenient and cheap tremolo modulator. Fender&#x27;s early tremolo effects used two vacuum tubes; after 1964 one of these tubes was replaced by an optocoupler made of a LDR and a neon lamp. To date, Vactrols activated by pressing the stompbox pedal are ubiquitous in the music industry. Shortages of genuine PerkinElmer Vactrols forced the DIY guitar community to &quot;roll their own&quot; resistive opto-isolators. Guitarists to date prefer opto-isolated effects because their superior separation of audio and control grounds results in &quot;inherently high quality of the sound&quot;. However, the distortion introduced by a photoresistor at line level signal is higher than that of a professional electrically-coupled voltage-controlled amplifier. Performance is further compromised by slow fluctuations of resistance owing to light history, a memory effect inherent in cadmium compounds. Such fluctuations take hours to settle and can be only partially offset with feedback in the control circuit.

===Photodiode opto-isolators===

Diode opto-isolators employ LEDs as sources of light and silicon photodiodes as sensors. When the photodiode is reverse-biased with an external voltage source, incoming light increases the reverse current flowing through the diode. The diode itself does not generate energy; it modulates the flow of energy from an external source. This mode of operation is called photoconductive mode. Alternatively, in the absence of external bias the diode converts the energy of light into electric energy by charging its terminals to a voltage of up to 0.7 V. The rate of charge is proportional to the intensity of incoming light. The energy is harvested by draining the charge through an external high-impedance path; the ratio of current transfer can reach 0.2%. This mode of operation is called photovoltaic mode.

The fastest opto-isolators employ PIN diodes in photoconductive mode. The response times of PIN diodes lie in the subnanosecond range; overall system speed is limited by delays in LED output and in biasing circuitry. To minimize these delays, fast digital opto-isolators contain their own LED drivers and output amplifiers optimized for speed. These devices are called &quot;full logic opto-isolators&quot;: their LEDs and sensors are fully encapsulated within a digital logic circuit. The Hewlett-Packard 6N137/HPCL2601 family of devices equipped with internal output amplifiers was introduced in the late 1970s and attained 10 MBd data transfer speeds. It remained an industry standard until the introduction of the 50 MBd Agilent Technologies 7723/0723 family in 2002. The 7723/0723 series opto-isolators contain CMOS LED drivers and a CMOS buffered amplifiers, which require two independent external power supplies of 5 V each.

Photodiode opto-isolators can be used for interfacing analog signals, although their non-linearity invariably distorts the signal. A special class of analog opto-isolators introduced by Burr-Brown uses &quot;two&quot; photodiodes and an input-side operational amplifier to compensate for diode non-linearity. One of two identical diodes is wired into the feedback loop of the amplifier, which maintains overall current transfer ratio at a constant level regardless of the non-linearity in the second (output) diode.

A novel idea of a particular optical analog signal isolator was submitted on 3, June 2011. The proposed configuration consist of two different parts. One of them transfers the signal, and the other establishes a negative feedback to ensure that the output signal has the same features as the input signal. This proposed analog isolator is linear over a wide range of input voltage and frequency. However linear opto couplers using this principle have been available for many years, for example the IL300.

Solid-state relays built around MOSFET switches usually employ a photodiode opto-isolator to drive the switch. The gate of a MOSFET requires relatively small total charge to turn on and its leakage current in steady state is very low. A photodiode in photovoltaic mode can generate turn-on &quot;charge&quot; in a reasonably short time but its output &quot;voltage&quot; is many times less than the MOSFET&#x27;s threshold voltage. To reach the required threshold, solid-state relays contain stacks of up to thirty photodiodes wired in series.

===Phototransistor opto-isolators===

Phototransistors are inherently slower than photodiodes. The earliest and the slowest but still common 4N35 opto-isolator, for example, has rise and fall times of 5 μs into a 100 Ohm load and its bandwidth is limited at around 10 kilohertz - sufficient for applications like electroencephalography or pulse-width motor control. Devices like PC-900 or 6N138 recommended in the original 1983 Musical Instrument Digital Interface specification allow digital data transfer speeds of tens of kiloBauds. Phototransistors must be properly biased and loaded to achieve their maximum speeds, for example, the 4N28 operates at up to 50 kHz with optimum bias and less than 4 kHz without it.

Design with transistor opto-isolators requires generous allowances for wide fluctuations of parameters found in commercially available devices. Such fluctuations may be destructive, for example, when an opto-isolator in the feedback loop of a DC-to-DC converter changes its transfer function and causes spurious oscillations, or when unexpected delays in opto-isolators cause a short circuit through one side of an H-bridge. Manufacturers&#x27; datasheets typically list only worst-case values for critical parameters; actual devices surpass these worst-case estimates in an unpredictable fashion. Bob Pease observed that current transfer ratio in a batch of 4N28&#x27;s can vary from 15% to more than 100%; the datasheet specified only a minimum of 10%. Transistor beta in the same batch can vary from 300 to 3000, resulting in 10:1 variance in bandwidth.

Opto-isolators using field-effect transistors (FETs) as sensors are rare and, like vactrols, can be used as remote-controlled analog potentiometers provided that the voltage across the FET&#x27;s output terminal does not exceed a few hundred mV. Opto-FETs turn on without injecting switching charge in the output circuit, which is particularly useful in sample and hold circuits.

===Bidirectional opto-isolators===

All opto-isolators described so far are uni-directional. Optical channel always works one way, from the source (LED) to the sensor. The sensors, be they photoresistors, photodiodes or phototransistors, cannot emit light. But LEDs, like all semiconductor diodes, are capable of detecting incoming light, which makes possible construction of a two-way opto-isolator from a pair of LEDs. The simplest bidirectional opto-isolator is merely a pair of LEDs placed face to face and held together with heat-shrink tubing. If necessary, the gap between two LEDs can be extended with a glass fiber insert.

Visible spectrum LEDs have relatively poor transfer efficiency, thus near infrared spectrum GaAs, GaAs:Si and AlGaAs:Si LEDs are the preferred choice for bidirectional devices. Bidirectional opto-isolators built around pairs of GaAs:Si LEDs have current transfer ratio of around 0.06% in either photovoltaic or photoconductive mode — less than photodiode-based isolators, but sufficiently practical for real-world applications.

==Types of configurations==


Usually, optocouplers have a &quot;closed pair&quot; configuration. This configuration refers to optocouplers enclosed in a dark container wherein the source and sensor are facing each other.

Some optocouplers have a &quot;slotted coupler/interrupter&quot; configuration. This configuration refers to optocouplers with an open slot between the source and sensor that has the ability to influence incoming signals. The &quot;slotted coupler/interrupter&quot; configuration is suitable for object detection, vibration detection, and bounce-free switching.

Some optocouplers have a &quot;reflective pair&quot; configuration. This configuration refers to optocouplers that contain a source that emits light and a sensor that only detects light when it has reflected off an object. The &quot;reflective pair&quot; configuration is suitable for the development of tachometers, movement detectors and reflectance monitors.

The later two configurations are frequently referred to as &quot;optosensors&quot; or &quot;photoelectric sensors&quot;.

<doc id="465394" wikidata="Q5326234" url="?curid=465394" title="Earl of Clanwilliam">
<text>Earl of Clanwilliam is a title in the Peerage of Ireland. It was created in 1776 for John Meade, 1st Viscount Clanwilliam. The Meade family descends from Sir John Meade, who represented Dublin University and County Tipperary in the Irish House of Commons and served as Attorney-General to James, Duke of York. In 1703, he was created a Baronet, of Ballintubber in the County of Cork, in the Baronetage of Ireland. His eldest son, Pierce, the second Baronet, died unmarried at an early age and was succeeded by his younger brother Richard, the third Baronet. Richard represented Kinsale in the Irish Parliament.

He was succeeded by his son John, the fourth Baronet. He briefly represented Banagher in the Irish House of Commons. He married Theodosia, daughter and wealthy heiress of Robert Hawkins-Magill. Through this marriage the Gill Hall estate in Dromore in County Down came into the Meade family. However, Meade&#x27;s extravagance was in time to leave the family bankrupt. In 1766 Meade was raised to the Peerage of Ireland as Baron Gillford, of the Manor of Gillford in the County of Down, and Viscount Clanwilliam, of the County of Tipperary. In 1776, he was further honoured when he was made Earl of Clanwilliam, also in the Peerage of Ireland. His grandson, the third Earl (who succeeded his father in 1805), was a prominent diplomat. Lord Clanwilliam was private secretary to and a close associate of Foreign Secretary Lord Castlereagh and also served as Permanent Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and as Ambassador to Prussia. In 1828 he was created Baron Clanwilliam, of Clanwilliam in the County of Tipperary, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom.

He was succeeded by his eldest son, the fourth Earl. He was an Admiral of the Fleet. On his death, the titles passed to his second but eldest surviving son, the fifth Earl. His only son, the sixth Earl, was Lord Lieutenant of County Down from 1962 to 1979. He had six daughters but no sons and was succeeded by his first cousin, the seventh Earl. He was the second and youngest son of Admiral the Hon. Sir Herbert Meade-Fetherstonehaugh, third son of the fourth Earl. the titles are held by his son, the eighth Earl, who succeeded in 2009.

Several other members of the Meade family have also gained distinction. The Hon. Robert Meade, second son of the first Earl, had reached the rank of lieutenant general in the army by 1814 at the height of the Napoleonic Wars. The Hon. John Meade, third son of the first Earl, was a lieutenant-general in the army. The Venerable the Hon. Pierce Meade, fourth son of the first Earl, was Archdeacon of Dromore. The Hon. Sir Robert Henry Meade, second son of the third Earl, was Permanent Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies from 1892 to 1897. The aforementioned Hon. Sir Herbert Meade-Fetherstonhaugh, third son of the fourth Earl, was an admiral in the Royal Navy.

Christoph Cardinal &quot;Graf&quot; von Schönborn, Archbishop of Vienna, descends from The 2nd Earl of Clanwilliam. The cardinal heads the Catholic Church in Austria.

The family seat Is Meade Mews, in London, but during the tenure of the 6th Earl was at Montalto Estate, near Ballynahinch, County Down.

<text>Earl of Caledon, of Caledon in the County of Tyrone, is a title in the Peerage of Ireland. It was created in 1800 for James Alexander, 1st Viscount Caledon. He was a merchant who had made an enormous fortune in India. He also represented the constituency of Londonderry City in the Irish House of Commons. Alexander had already been created Baron Caledon in 1790 and Viscount Caledon, of Caledon in the County of Tyrone, in 1797, also in the Peerage of Ireland. In 1784, James Alexander purchased a city house in Dublin at Rutland Square (now Parnell Square) where he lived when serving as an MP for Derry.

He was succeeded by his son, the second Earl. He was the first Governor of the Cape Colony and sat in the House of Lords as an Irish representative peer from 1804 to 1839. His son, the third Earl, briefly represented County Tyrone in the House of Commons as a Tory and was an Irish Representative Peer between 1841 and 1855. His eldest son, the fourth Earl, sat in the House of Lords as an Irish Representative Peer from 1877 to 1898. He was succeeded by his eldest son, the fifth Earl. He never married and was succeeded by his nephew, the 6th Earl. He was the son of the Hon. Herbrand Charles Alexander, second son of the fourth Earl. Today the titles are held by his only son, the seventh Earl, who succeeded in 1980. Lord Caledon was made Lord Lieutenant of County Armagh in 1989.

The family&#x27;s lineage can be traced to Captain Andrew Alexander, of Errigal, County Donegal, who was granted lands at Ballyclose near Limavady, County Londonderry, in 1663 and was later attainted by the parliament called by James II in Dublin in 1689. He had a son, Jacob Alexander, who was the ancestor of the Alexanders of Ahilly (Donegal), by his first wife, a Miss Phillips, who was a relative of the Alexanders, and by his second wife, Miss Hillhouse, he had a son, John Alexander, who married Anne White, daughter of John White, of Cadyhill, County Londonderry, and had four children. His second son Nathaniel Alexander was born in 1689 and became an Alderman of the city of Derry in 1755 and died on 22 September 1761, having had with other children a third son, James Alexander, who became the 1st Earl of Caledon.

The style Viscount Alexander is used as a courtesy title for the Earl&#x27;s eldest son and heir apparent.

The family seat is Caledon House, also called Caledon Castle, near Caledon in County Tyrone, Northern Ireland.

<text>Earl of Mornington is a title in the Peerage of Ireland. It was created in 1760 for the Anglo-Irish politician and composer Garret Wellesley, 2nd Baron Mornington. On the death of the fifth earl in 1863, it passed to the Duke of Wellington; since that date, the title has generally been used by courtesy for the heir apparent to the heir apparent to the dukedom.

==History==
The first earl was the eldest son of Richard Wesley, the first Baron Mornington. Richard Wesley, born Richard Colley, was elevated to the Peerage of Ireland as Baron Mornington, of Mornington, in 1746. He had inherited the Dangan and Mornington estates in County Meath on the death of his first cousin Garret Wesley in 1728. In the same year he was granted by Royal licence the new surname of Wesley (see below for earlier history of the family).

His son, the second Baron, was made the first Earl of Mornington in 1760, and at the same time also became Viscount Wellesley, of Dangan Castle in the County of Meath, also in the Peerage of Ireland.

Four of the first earl&#x27;s sons gained distinction. The third son was Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington, who defeated Napoleon Bonaparte at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815 (see Duke of Wellington), while the fifth was the diplomat Henry Wellesley, 1st Baron Cowley (see Earl Cowley).

The first earl was succeeded by his eldest son, Richard, the second earl. He used the original family surname of Wellesley in lieu of Wesley. He was a prominent soldier, diplomat and politician. In 1797 he was created Baron Wellesley, of Wellesley in the County of Somerset, in the Peerage of Great Britain, which entitled him to a seat in the British House of Lords. In 1799 he was further honoured when he was made Marquess Wellesley, of Norragh, in the Peerage of Ireland. However, he was said to be bitterly disappointed at not receiving a dukedom or at least an English peerage of high rank. He referred to his Irish marquessate as a &quot;double-gilt potato&quot;. Lord Wellesley had several children by his French mistress, Hyacinthe-Gabrielle Roland (they were married in 1794 after the birth of their children). One of them, Anne, married as her second husband Lord Charles Bentinck. They were great-great-grandparents of Queen Elizabeth II.
As Lord Wellesley had no legitimate children, the English barony of 1797 and the marquessate became extinct on his death in 1842. He was succeeded in the other titles by his younger brother William Wellesley-Pole, 1st Baron Maryborough, who became the third Earl of Mornington. He was also a politician and notably served as Chief Secretary for Ireland between 1809 and 1812 and as Chancellor of the Irish Exchequer between 1811 and 1812. Born William Wesley, he assumed by Royal licence in 1781 the additional surname of Pole on succeeding to the estates of his cousin, William Pole. In 1798 he assumed by Royal licence the surname of Wellesley-Pole in lieu of Wesley-Pole. In 1821 he was raised to the Peerage of the United Kingdom as Baron Maryborough, of Maryborough in the Queen&#x27;s County. He was succeeded by his son, the fourth Earl. He married Catherine, daughter and coheir of Sir James Tylney-Long, 7th Baronet (see Tylney-Long Baronets). She was known in London society as &quot;The Wiltshire heiress&quot; and was believed to be the richest commoner in England. On his marriage he assumed by Royal licence the additional surnames of Tylney and Long. 

Lord Mornington is chiefly remembered for his dissipated lifestyle which brought about the destruction of the Tylney family estate of Wanstead House. He was succeeded by his eldest and only surviving son, the fifth Earl. He had been the subject of a bitter custody battle between his father and his two maternal aunts (who had wanted him to be placed under the guardianship of his great-uncle the Duke of Wellington) and later fought a legal battle with his father over the sale of contents of the family seat Draycot House. Lord Mornington died unmarried in 1863 when the barony of Maryborough became extinct. He left all his landed property to his father&#x27;s cousin Henry Wellesley, 1st Earl Cowley. He was succeeded in his Irish titles by his first cousin once removed, Arthur Wellesley, 2nd Duke of Wellington. The title Earl of Mornington is now used as a courtesy title by the heir apparent to the Marquess of Douro, himself the heir apparent to the Duke of Wellington. As of 2015, the title is held by courtesy by Arthur Wellesley, Earl of Mornington, son of Arthur Wellesley, Marquess of Douro and grandson of Charles Wellesley, 9th Duke of Wellington.
The Wesley or Wellesley family descended from Sir Richard de Wellesley (15th century). His grandson Sir William Wellesley (died 1602) lived at Dangan Castle, County Meath. The family estates passed down the male lines. One of Wellesley&#x27;s daughters, Alison, married John Cusack. Their son Sir Thomas Cusack served as Lord Chancellor of Ireland between 1551 and 1554. His daughter, Katherine, married Sir Henry Colley (or Cowley) (16th century), of Castle Carbery, County Kildare. Their grandson Sir Henry Colley represented County Monaghan in the Irish Parliament. One of Sir Henry&#x27;s sons, Dudley Colley (or Cowley), was a member of the Irish Parliament for Philipstown. His son Henry Colley (or Cowley) was the father of Henry Cowley, who represented Strabane in the Irish House of Commons, and of Garret Wesley, 1st Baron Mornington. The aforementioned Garret Wesley (died 1728) was a descendant of Sir William Wellesley (died 1602) as well as the son of Elizabeth, daughter of the aforementioned Dudley Colley, also the paternal grandfather of the first Baron Mornington.

The country seat of the Wellesley family was Dangan Castle, near Summerhill, County Meath. The Dublin residence of the family was Mornington House, Merrion Street.

<doc id="465415" wikidata="Q272830" url="?curid=465415" title="Sternocleidomastoid muscle">
<text>The sternocleidomastoid muscle is one of the largest and most superficial cervical muscles. The primary actions of the muscle are rotation of the head to the opposite side and flexion of the neck. The sternocleidomastoid is innervated by the accessory nerve.

==Etymology and location==
It is given the name &quot;sternocleidomastoid&quot; because it originates at the manubrium of the sternum (&quot;sterno-&quot;) and the clavicle (&quot;cleido-&quot;) and has an insertion at the mastoid process of the temporal bone of the skull.

==Structure==
The sternocleidomastoid muscle originates from two locations: the manubrium of the sternum and the clavicle. It travels obliquely across the side of the neck and inserts at the mastoid process of the temporal bone of the skull by a thin aponeurosis. The sternocleidomastoid is thick and narrow at its center, and broader and thinner at either end.

The sternal head is a round fasciculus, tendinous in front, fleshy behind, arising from the upper part of the front of the manubrium sterni. It travels superiorly, laterally, and posteriorly.

The clavicular head is composed of fleshy and aponeurotic fibers, arises from the upper, frontal surface of the medial third of the clavicle; it is directed almost vertically upward.

The two heads are separated from one another at their origins by a triangular interval (&quot;lesser supraclavicular fossa&quot;) but gradually blend, below the middle of the neck, into a thick, rounded muscle which is inserted, by a strong tendon, into the lateral surface of the mastoid process, from its apex to its superior border, and by a thin aponeurosis into the lateral half of the superior nuchal line of the occipital bone.

===Nerve supply===
The sternocleidomastoid is innervated by accessory nerve of the same side. It supplies only motor fibres. The cervical plexus supplies sensation, including proprioception, from the ventral primary rami of C2 and C3.

===Variation===
The clavicular origin of the sternocleidomastoid varies greatly: in some cases the clavicular head may be as narrow as the sternal; in others it may be as much as in breadth.

When the clavicular origin is broad, it is occasionally subdivided into several slips, separated by narrow intervals. More rarely, the adjoining margins of the sternocleidomastoid and trapezius are in contact. This would leave no posterior triangle.

The supraclavicularis muscle arises from the manubrium behind the sternocleidomastoid and passes behind the sternocleidomastoid to the upper surface of the clavicle.

==Function==
The function of this muscle is to rotate the head to the opposite side or obliquely rotate the head. It also flexes the neck. When both sides of the muscle act together, it flexes the neck and extends the head. When one side acts alone, it causes the head to rotate to the opposite side and flexes laterally to the same side (ipsilaterally).

It also acts as an accessory muscle of respiration, along with the scalene muscles of the neck.

===Contraction===
The signaling process to contract or relax the sternocleidomastoid begins in Cranial Nerve XI, the accessory nerve. The accessory nerve nucleus is in the anterior horn of the spinal cord around C1-C3, where lower motor neuron fibers mark its origin. The fibers from the accessory nerve nucleus travel upward to enter the cranium via the foramen magnum. The internal carotid artery to reach both the sternocleidomastoid muscles and the trapezius. After a signal reaches the accessory nerve nucleus in the anterior horn of the spinal cord, the signal is conveyed to motor endplates on the muscle fibers located at the clavicle. Acetylcholine (ACH) is released from vesicles and is sent over the synaptic cleft to receptors on the postsynaptic bulb. The ACH causes the resting potential to increase above -55mV, thus initiating an action potential which travels along the muscle fiber. Along the muscle fibers are t-tubule openings which facilitate the spread of the action potential into the muscle fibers. The t-tubule meets with the sarcoplasmic reticulum at locations throughout the muscle fiber, at these locations the sarcoplasmic reticulum releases calcium ions that results in the movement of troponin and tropomyosin on thin filaments. The movement of troponin and tropomyosin is key in facilitating the myosin head to move along the thin filament, resulting in a contraction of the sternocleidomastoid muscle.

===Anatomical landmark===
The sternocleidomastoid is within the investing fascia of the neck, along with the trapezius muscle, with which it shares its nerve supply (the accessory nerve). It is thick and thus serves as a primary landmark of the neck, as it divides the neck into anterior and posterior cervical triangles (in front and behind the muscle, respectively) which helps define the location of structures, such as the lymph nodes for the head and neck.

Many important structures relate to the sternocleidomastoid, including the common carotid artery, accessory nerve, and brachial plexus.

==Clinical significance==
Examination of the sternocleidomastoid muscle forms part of the examination of the cranial nerves. It can be felt on each side of the neck when a person moves their head to the opposite side.

The triangle formed by the clavicle and the sternal and clavicular heads of the sternocleidomastoid muscle is used as a landmark in identifying the correct location for central venous catheterization.

Contraction of the muscle gives rise to a condition called torticollis or &quot;wry neck&quot;, and this can have a number of causes. Torticollis gives the appearance of a tilted head on the side involved. Treatment involves physiotherapy exercises to stretch the involved muscle and strengthen the muscle on the opposite side of the neck. Congenital torticollis can have an unknown cause or result from birth trauma that gives rise to a mass or tumor that can be palpated within the muscle.

<doc id="465426" wikidata="Q3071844" url="?curid=465426" title="Los Lunas Decalogue Stone">
<text>The Los Lunas Decalogue Stone is a hoax associated with a large boulder on the side of Hidden Mountain, near Los Lunas, New Mexico, about south of Albuquerque, that bears a nine-line inscription carved into a flat panel. The stone is also known as the Los Lunas Mystery Stone or Commandment Rock. The stone has gained notoriety in that some claim the inscription is Pre-Columbian, and therefore proof of early Semitic contact with the Americas. Standard archeological evidence contradicts this, however.

==History==
The first recorded mention of the stone is in 1933, when professor Frank Hibben (1910–2002), an archaeologist from the University of New Mexico, saw it. According to a 1996 interview, Hibben was &quot;convinced the inscription is ancient and thus authentic. He report[ed] that he first saw the text in 1933. At the time it was covered with lichen and patination and was hardly visible. He claimed he was taken to the site by a guide who claimed he had seen it as a boy, back in the 1880s.&quot; However, Hibben&#x27;s testimony is tainted by charges that in at least two separate incidents, he fabricated some or all of his archaeological data to support his pre-Clovis migration theory.

The reported 1880s date of discovery is important to those who believe that the stone is pre-Columbian. However, the Paleo-Hebrew script, which is closely related to the Phoenician script, was known to scholars by at least 1870 - thus not precluding the possibility of a modern hoax.

Because of the stone&#x27;s weight of over 80 tons, it was never moved to a museum or laboratory for study and safekeeping. Many visitors have cleaned the stone inscriptions over the years, likely destroying any possibility for scientific analysis of the inscriptions&#x27; patina. Nevertheless, comparing it to a modern inscription nearby, geologist George E. Morehouse, a colleague of Barry Fell, estimated that the inscription could be between 500 and 2000 years old and explaining its freshness and lack of patina as being due to frequent scrubbing to make it more visible.

In April 2006, the first line of the unprotected inscription was obliterated by vandals.

Visitors to the site are required to purchase a $35 Recreational Access Permit from the New Mexico State Land Office.

==Controversy==

Archaeolinguist Cyrus Gordon has proposed that the Los Lunas Decalogue is a Samaritan mezuzah. The familiar Jewish mezuzah is a tiny scroll placed in a small container mounted by the entrance to a house. The ancient Samaritan mezuzah, on the other hand, was commonly a large stone slab placed by the gateway to a property or synagogue, and bearing an abridged version of the Decalogue. On historical and epigraphic grounds, Gordon regards the Byzantine period as the most likely for the inscription. The Samaritan alphabet is a direct descendant of the Paleo-Hebrew alphabet.

One argument against the stone&#x27;s antiquity is its apparent use of modern Hebrew (or otherwise atypical) punctuation, though amateur epigrapher Barry Fell argued that the punctuation is consistent with antiquity. Other researchers dismiss the inscription based on the numerous stylistic and grammatical errors that appear in the inscription.

According to archaeologist Kenneth Feder, &quot;the stone is almost certainly a fake.&quot; He points out that &quot;the flat face of the stone shows a very sharp, crisp inscription...&quot; His main concern however is the lack of any archaeological context. He argues that to get to the location of the stone would have required whoever inscribed it to have &quot;stopped along the way, encamped, eaten food, broken things, disposed of trash, performed rituals, and so on. And those actions should have left a trail of physical archaeological evidence across the greater American Southwest, discovery of which would undeniably prove the existence of foreigners in New Mexico in antiquity with a demonstrably ancient Hebrew material culture...&quot; and states that &quot;There are no pre-Columbian ancient Hebrew settlements, no sites containing the everyday detritus of a band of ancient Hebrews, nothing that even a cursory knowledge of how the archaeological record forms would demand there would be. From an archaeological standpoint, that&#x27;s plainly impossible.&quot;

British archaeologist Keith Fitzpatrick-Matthews has concluded that &quot;Viewed dispassionately, the Los Lunas inscription is a clear, but well constructed forgery (for its day). Despite the claims of high antiquity, there are features of the text (such as the mixing of letter forms between two separate alphabets) that are much more likely to derive from the work of a modern forger than from an ancient Hebrew or Samaritan scribe.&quot; Other speculative origin myths include the idea that members of a passing U.S. Army battalion made up primarily of Mormon soldiers during the Mexican-American War carved the stone.

==Similar landmarks==
The Los Lunas Decalogue Stone is often grouped with the Heavener Runestone, Kensington Runestone, Dighton Rock, and the Newport Tower as examples of American landmarks with disputed provenances. Other disputed American Hebrew inscriptions include the Smithsonian Institution&#x27;s Bat Creek Inscription and the Newark Ohio Decalogue Stone, Keystone, and Johnson-Bradner Stone.

<doc id="465427" wikidata="Q1860030" url="?curid=465427" title="Bagheera">
<text>Bagheera ( / &quot;Baghīrā&quot;) is a fictional character in Rudyard Kipling&#x27;s Mowgli stories in &quot;The Jungle Book&quot; (coll. 1894) and &quot;The Second Jungle Book&quot; (coll. 1895). He is a black panther (melanistic Indian leopard) who serves as friend, protector and mentor to the &quot;man-cub&quot; Mowgli. The word &quot;bagheera&quot; is Hindi for panther or leopard, although the root word &quot;bagh&quot; means any form of panthera and is nowadays mostly used to refer to the Royal Bengal tiger.

==Character history==
Born in captivity in the menagerie of the Raja of Udaipur, Rajasthan, India, Bagheera begins to plan for his freedom after his mother dies. Once he is mature and strong enough, he breaks the lock on his cage and escapes into the jungle, where cunning nature win him the respect of all its other inhabitants, except for Shere Khan the Tiger. Bagheera reveals all this to Mowgli later. None but Mowgli ever learn that Bagheera once wore a collar and chain, explaining the cat&#x27;s special insight concerning men. Because he had learned the ways of men, he was also more loving to the abandoned human child who came to be under his care and protection.

When Father Wolf and Mother Wolf of the Seeonee (Seoni) wolf pack adopt the human &quot;cub&quot; Mowgli and the pack demands that the new cub should be spoken for, Bagheera buys Mowgli&#x27;s life with a freshly killed bull and helps to raise him as one of the pack. Because his life has been bought by a bull, Mowgli is forbidden to eat cattle (coincidentally, just as the Hindu villagers of the region are also forbidden). Bagheera will frequently remind Mowgli of this debt by swearing an oath referencing his own previous captivity. As Bagheera swears, &quot;By the broken lock that freed me&quot;, so Mowgli answers back &quot;By the bull that bought me.&quot;

At one point, during one of Mowgli&#x27;s many lessons in the Laws of the Jungle under the tutelage of Baloo the Bear, Bagheera says &quot;I am more likely to give help than to ask it&quot;, as Mowgli learns the many sacred words needed to call on the assistance of all kinds of species of animals living in the jungle. Bagheera, having freed himself from the captivity of humans, is a proud animal aware of his own abilities, though he acknowledges Mowgli&#x27;s growing power over each of the animals as the boy grows older. Bagheera shows Mowgli that none of the animals may stare into his eyes, even those who love him.

Bagheera shares in many of Mowgli&#x27;s adventures as he grows, but eventually the time comes when the man-cub becomes a man and has to return to human society. Bagheera frees Mowgli of his debt to the wolf pack by killing another bull, and Mowgli returns to his adopted human mother Messua.

Bagheera is one of Mowgli&#x27;s mentors and best friends. He, Baloo and Kaa sing for Mowgli &quot;The Outsong&quot; of the jungle. He also calls out to Mowgli in farewell, &quot;Remember, Bagheera loved thee... Remember, Bagheera loved thee.&quot;

==Disney adaptations==
===1967 animated film===
Bagheera appears in the 1967 animated adaptation by Walt Disney Productions. His voice is provided by Sebastian Cabot. Early in the film&#x27;s development, Bill Peet suggested Howard Morris as the voice of Bagheera, but Disney did not approve of the choice, with Reitherman and other animators preferring either Karl Swenson or Sebastian Cabot. Cabot was the final choice.

As in the Kipling books, Bagheera is Mowgli&#x27;s rational guardian; however, while developing the film, Walt Disney chose to omit Bagheera&#x27;s past and scars and not let him spoil Mowgli more. Baloo in the film often calls Bagheera &quot;Baggy&quot; as a nickname.

Bagheera finds Mowgli as a baby and brings him to a pack of wolves to ensure his survival, knowing Mowgli will eventually need to return to the human world. When Shere Khan returns to the jungle, Bagheera offers to take Mowgli to a nearby human village for his safety. Bagheera conflicts with Baloo regarding Mowgli, but Bagheera reminds him of Shere Khan and convinces him to help him. When Mowgli runs away from Baloo, Bagheera tries to gain help from Hathi and his herd of elephants in finding him. Bagheera consoles Mowgli when he thinks Shere Khan has killed Baloo trying to defend him, but Baloo wakes much to Bagheera&#x27;s anger, having thought him dead. When Mowgli follows Shanti a human girl into the village, Bagheera encourages him and consoles Baloo, assuring him of Mowgli&#x27;s safety. He and Baloo walk off afterward singing &quot;The Bare Necessities&quot; as the film ends.

Though Bagheera is absent from the series &quot;TaleSpin&quot;, which uses several characters from the 1967 film, many of Shere Khan&#x27;s employees and military personnel are black panthers strongly resembling him.

Bagheera appears as a cub in the prequel series &quot;Jungle Cubs&quot;, where his friends often make fun of him. Like Shere Khan and Hathi, Bagheera has an American accent as opposed to his English accent in the 1967 film. Bagheera is voiced in &quot;Jungle Cubs&quot; by E.G. Daily and Dee Bradley Baker as a cub and by Jim Cummings as an adult on special animated segments.

Bagheera appears in &quot;The Jungle Book 2&quot;, voiced by Bob Joles. When Shere Khan returns to take revenge on Mowgli, Bagheera tries to stop Baloo from helping Mowgli, suspecting he wants to bring him back to the jungle. Bagheera fails despite gaining the aid of Hathi, and Baloo tricks him into thinking Mowgli is not with him, though Bagheera is unsure. Bagheera rushes to help Mowgli and his friend Shanti after Shere Khan attacks them but has to wait outside the temple where they are trapped, warning Baloo to be careful as he travels inside. Mowgli manages to trap Shere Khan, after which he introduces Shanti to Bagheera. At the end of the film, he is shown playing with Mowgli&#x27;s adoptive brother Ranjan.

===1994 live-action film===
In the 1994 live-action film, Bagheera is portrayed by a black leopard named Shadow. As opposed to other adaptations, Bagheera and the other animals in this film do not speak.

Bagheera finds Mowgli and his pet wolf, Grey Brother, after they are separated from civilization. Hearing Shere Khan&#x27;s roar, Bagheera leads them by his tail to a pack of wolves, who adopt them as Mowgli is kind to one of their species. When Mowgli is an adult and has learned the ways of men, he introduces Bagheera to his love interest Kitty Brydon, though he is hostile toward Kitty&#x27;s fiancé Captain Boone and his soldiers. Bagheera saves Mowgli from being shot by soldiers working for Boone, and later saves their friend Dr. Plumford from being killed by Buldeo and a caravan of bandits. When Mowgli is tied to a tree, Bagheera arrives and chews through the ropes, freeing him. At the end of the film Bagheera is seen crossing a bridge with a triumphant Mowgli and Kitty.

===1998 live-action film===
Bagheera appears in 1998 live-action film &quot;The Jungle Book: Mowgli&#x27;s Story&quot;, voiced by Eartha Kitt. This incarnation is female, but her role is similar to the 1967 animated version, in addition serving as Mowgli&#x27;s teacher (alongside Baloo) in which she teaches him how to hunt in the jungle and defend against Shere Khan.

===2016 live-action/CGI hybrid film===
Bagheera appears in the 2016 remake of the 1967 film as a computer-generated character, where he is voiced by Ben Kingsley. Bagheera&#x27;s role is largely similar to the 1967 animated version, serving as a mentor to Mowgli and a voice of reason to him and Baloo.

Bagheera rescues Mowgli after Shere Khan kills the boy&#x27;s father and raises him to be a creature of the jungle as part of Akela&#x27;s wolf pack. When Shere Khan threatens Mowgli&#x27;s life, Bagheera agrees to guide him to a human village, but Shere Khan ambushes them en route. Bagheera fights Shere Khan, buying Mowgli enough time to escape. He reunites with Mowgli after Baloo saves him from Kaa, and tries to have Baloo lie to Mowgli in order to ensure he stays in the village. Bagheera and Baloo help Mowgli escape King Louie and his gang of monkeys, but Mowgli is furious with them for failing to tell them Shere Khan has killed Akela. Bagheera helps Baloo and the wolf pack fight Shere Khan long enough to allow Mowgli to lure the tiger over a pit of fire, into which he falls to his death. Bagheera is seen sitting with Baloo and Mowgli as the film ends, Mowgli having found his true home in the jungle.

Kingsley described Bagheera in an interview as an adoptive parent to Mowgli whose personality was somewhat militaristic, saying that &quot;he&#x27;s instantly recognizable by the way that he talks, how he acts, and what his ethical code is&quot;. Kingsley&#x27;s voice acting was praised by Rotten Tomatoes as &quot;[bringing] the appropriate level of gravitas to the strait-laced Bagheera&quot;, and was ranked as the best animal performance in the film by Vox, who called Bagheera &quot;the concerned parent, worried about what his child will find around the next corner, the big cat who knows he has to let go just a little but can&#x27;t find it in himself to do so&quot;.

==Other media==
* In the 1967 animated Soviet film, &quot;Adventures of Mowgli&quot;, Bagheera () is portrayed as female. This may be related to the fact that the Russian word for &quot;panther&quot; (, &quot;pantera&quot;) is a feminine noun, and a name ending with &#x27;a&#x27; is considered to be a female name in the Russian language (a male panther would have been named Bagheer). As a matter of fact, Russian translators sometimes accidentally sought gender balance by changing the gender and name of fictional animals if they were behaving similar to local folklore trickster, e. g. there&#x27;s a female fox character in an adaptation/translation of Italian &quot;The Adventures of Pinocchio&quot; made by A. Tolstoy). Additionally, in the Russian translation of the book, Bagheera is female. In this version, she has three cubs, one black and two yellow with rosette patterns. Bagheera is portrayed as friendly, loyal, trustworthy, and protective, yet somewhat cunning and tricky. She is voiced by Lyudmila Kasatkina in the original Soviet Russian-language version, and by Dana Delany in the 1996 American English version.
* In a 1978 live-action sketch titled &quot;The Wonderful World of Ernie&quot; from &quot;Morecambe and Wise&quot;, which parodied &quot;I Wan&#x27;na Be Like You (The Monkey Song)&quot;, Bagheera is played by Derek Griffiths using a full costume, although lip-synching to Sebastian Cabot&#x27;s original recorded dialogue in the middle of the song.
* In the Japanese anime &quot;Jungle Book Shōnen Mowgli&quot;, Bagheera is one of Mowgli&#x27;s closest friends and strongest allies. He is voiced by Hiroya Ishimaru in the Japanese and Arthur Grosser in the English dub. Like in the literature, he was formerly a pet panther, but instead of breaking free on his own, he is set free on purpose, mainly to protect him as his owner was a cruel man, though the man&#x27;s daughter Linda was compassionate to him and even went as far as taking a gunshot for him to ensure his escape. Bagheera later told Mowgli about her and also mourns her.
* In the 1991 song &quot;Bagheera&quot; by Blues Traveler, Bagheera is depicted with blood-stained fur drinking at the bar, counseling a young man-cub about his choice to live as man or as a free creature. Mowgli remembers when he was in the midst of his decision to live with the world of Man or to return to the jungle and be free. The line says &quot;some say if you could have seen him then, you would have noticed a tear fall from his majestic eye&quot;.
* In the 1996 Hungarian play version, Bagheera is again a female panther. Her main role is bribing the wolf pack with a bull, so they accept Mowgli as Akela&#x27;s cub, teaching Mowgli with Baloo about the Rules of the Jungle, and advising him throughout the play.
* In the 2002 comic book series &quot;Fables&quot;, Bagheera appears as one of the characters living in exile on the Farm in upstate New York. He participates in the farm uprising and, along with the other &quot;Kipling&quot; fables, he assists Goldilocks in tracking down Reynard the Fox. Bagheera actually succeeds in tracking down Reynard, though the Fox manages to escape from him. It is implied that Bagheera&#x27;s primary motivation for capturing the Fox is to show up Shere Khan after Khan arrogantly rejects Bagheera&#x27;s offer of help. After the uprising is defeated, a remorseful Bagheera agrees to imprisonment rather than forced labor. However, as he reveals to Mowgli, he has the memory of urinating on the deceased Shere Khan&#x27;s grave to amuse himself.
* A 2007 Swedish play version of &quot;The Jungle Book&quot; spoofed the confusion of Bagheera&#x27;s sex in the media by portraying him as a transvestite.
* In the 2018 film &quot;&quot;, Christian Bale voiced Bagheera.

<text>Tenoch (or Tenuch, ) was a ruler of the Mexicas (Aztecas) during the fourteenth century during the Aztec travels from Aztlán to Tenochtitlan. The Tenochtitlan people were originally referred to as Tenochca, then the Mexica. He was a respected chief who was elected to power by the council of elders and died sometime between 1350 and 1375, depending on the source.

Tenoch was one of nine Mexica leaders who were told how Mexica could gain support from the forces of nature. After traveling southward for a span of 200 years, the Mexica found the sign. In honor of their leader, they named the small, reedy island in Lake Texcoco, Tenochtitlan. Tenochtitlan soon became the capital of the Aztec Empire. The Nahuatl symbols of his name are found in the Mexican flag: &quot;Tetl&quot;: &quot;rock&quot;, and &quot;Nochtli&quot;: &quot;prickly pear cactus&quot;.

There is disagreement whether Tenoch is a mythological person or a real Mexica leader who was later mythologized. According to one source, Tenoch&#x27;s father was Iztac Mixcoatl, who had a total of seven sons with two wives, six of them giants:

<text>Reader&#x27;s Digest is an American general-interest family magazine, published ten times a year. Formerly based in Chappaqua, New York, it is now headquartered in midtown Manhattan. The magazine was founded in 1922 by DeWitt Wallace and his wife Lila Bell Wallace. For many years, &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot; was the best-selling consumer magazine in the United States; it lost that distinction in 2009 to &quot;Better Homes and Gardens&quot;. According to Media Mark Research (2006), &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot; reached more readers with household incomes of over $100,000 than &quot;Fortune&quot;, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, &quot;Business Week&quot;, and &quot;Inc.&quot; combined.

Global editions of &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot; reach an additional 40 million people in more than 70 countries, via 49 editions in 21 languages. The periodical has a global circulation of 10.5 million, making it the largest paid-circulation magazine in the world.

It is also published in Braille, digital, and audio editions, and in a large-type edition called &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest Large Print.&quot; The magazine is compact: its pages are roughly half the size of most American magazines. With this in mind, in summer 2005, the company adopted the slogan &quot;America in your pocket” for the U.S. edition. In January 2008, however, it changed the slogan to &quot;Life well shared.&quot;

==History==
===Inception and growth===
In 1920, Dewitt Wallace married Lila Bell Wallace in Pleasantville, New York. Shortly thereafter, the two would launch &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot; in the basement below a Greenwich Village speakeasy. The idea for &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot; was to gather a sampling of favorite articles on many subjects from various monthly magazines, sometimes condensing and rewriting them, and to combine them into one magazine.

Since its inception &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot; has maintained a conservative and anti-Communist perspective on political and social issues. The Wallaces initially hoped the journal could provide $5,000 of net income. Wallace&#x27;s assessment of what the potential mass-market audience wanted to read led to rapid growth. By 1929, the magazine had 290,000 subscribers and had a gross income of $900,000 a year. The first international edition was published in the United Kingdom in 1938. By the 40th anniversary of &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot;, it had 40 international editions, in 13 languages and Braille, and at one point, it was the largest-circulating journal in China, Mexico, Spain, Sweden, Peru, and other countries, with a total international circulation of 23 million.

The magazine&#x27;s format for several decades consisted of 30 articles per issue (one per day), along with an &quot;It Pays to Increase your Word Power&quot; vocabulary quiz, a page of &quot;Amusing Anecdotes&quot; and &quot;Personal Glimpses&quot;, two features of funny stories entitled &quot;Humor in Uniform&quot; and &quot;Life in these United States&quot;, and a lengthier article at the end, usually condensed from a published book. Other regular features were &quot;My Most Unforgettable Character&quot; (since discontinued), the &quot;Drama in Real Life&quot; survival stories, and more recently &quot;That&#x27;s Outrageous&quot;. These were all listed in the table of contents on the front cover. Each article was prefaced by a small, simple line drawing. In more recent times, the format evolved into flashy, colorful, eye-catching graphics throughout, and many short bits of data interspersed with full articles. The table of contents is now contained inside. From 2003 to 2007, the back cover featured &quot;Our America&quot;, paintings of Rockwell-style whimsical situations by artist C. F. Payne. Another monthly consumer advice feature is &quot;What [people in various professions] won&#x27;t tell you,&quot; with a different profession featured each time.

The first &quot;Word Power&quot; column of the magazine was published in the January 1945 edition, written by Wilfred J. Funk. In December 1952, the magazine published &quot;Cancer by the Carton&quot;, a series of articles that linked smoking with lung cancer, and this topic was later repeated in other articles.

From 2002 to 2006, &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot; conducted a vocabulary competition in schools throughout the US called &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot; National Word Power Challenge. In 2007, the magazine said it would not have the competition for the 2007–08 school year: &quot;...but rather to use the time to evaluate the program in every respect, including scope, mission, and model for implementation.&quot;

In 2006, the magazine published three more local-language editions in Slovenia, Croatia, and Romania. In October 2007, the &quot;Digest&quot; expanded into Serbia. The magazine&#x27;s licensee in Italy stopped publishing in December 2007. The magazine launched in the People&#x27;s Republic of China in January 2008. It ceased publishing in China in 2012, due to a lack of sales caused by a relatively high price, a poorly defined audience and low-quality translated content.

For 2010, the US edition of the magazine reduced its publishing schedule to 10 times a year rather than 12, and to increase digital offerings. It also cut its circulation guarantee for advertisers to 5.5 million copies from 8 million. In announcing that decision, in June 2009, the company said that it planned to reduce its number of celebrity profiles and how-to features, and increase the number of inspiring spiritual stories and stories about the military.

Beginning in January 2013, the US edition was increased to 12 times a year.

Its current frequency of publication is 8 times a year. 

===Business organization and ownership===

In 1990, the magazine&#x27;s parent company, The Reader&#x27;s Digest Association, Inc. (RDA), became a publicly traded corporation. From 2005 through 2010, RDA reported a net loss each year.

In March 2007, Ripplewood Holdings LLC led a consortium of private-equity investors who bought the company through a leveraged buyout for US$2.8 billion, financed primarily by the issuance of US$2.2 billion of debt. Ripplewood invested $275 million of its own money, and had partners including Rothschild Bank of Zürich and GoldenTree Asset Management of New York. The private-equity deal tripled the association&#x27;s interest payments, to $148 million a year.

On August 24, 2009, RDA announced it had filed with the US Bankruptcy court an arranged Chapter 11 bankruptcy to continue operations, and to restructure the US$2.2 billion debt undertaken by the leveraged buyout transaction. The company emerged from bankruptcy with the lenders exchanging debt for equity, and Ripplewood&#x27;s entire equity investment was extinguished.

In April 2010, the UK arm was sold to its management. It has a licensing deal with the US company to continue publishing the UK edition. The closure of the UK edition was announced in April 2024.

On February 17, 2013, RDA Holding filed for bankruptcy a second time. The company was purchased for £1 by Mike Luckwell, a venture capitalist and once the biggest shareholder in WPP plc.

==Direct marketing==
RDA offers many mail-order products included with &quot;sweepstakes&quot; or contests. US &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot; and the company&#x27;s other US magazines do not use sweepstakes in their direct-mail promotions. A notable shift to electronic direct marketing has been undertaken by the company to adapt to shifting media landscape. In the mid-20th century, phonograph record albums of popular classical and easy-listening music, bearing the magazine&#x27;s name, were sold by mail. &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot; also partnered with RCA to offer a mail-order music club which offered discount pricing on vinyl records.

==Sweepstakes agreement==
In 2001, 32 states&#x27; attorneys general reached agreements with the company and other sweepstakes operators to settle allegations that they tricked the elderly into buying products because they were a &quot;guaranteed winner&quot; of a lottery. The settlement required the companies to expand the type size of notices in the packaging that no purchase is necessary to play the sweepstakes, and to:
# Establish a &quot;Do Not Contact List&quot; and refrain from soliciting any future &quot;high-activity&quot; customers unless and until &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot; actually makes contact with that customer and determines that the customer is not buying because they believe that the purchase will improve their chances of winning.
# Send letters to individuals who spend more than $1,000 in a six-month period telling them that they are not required to make purchases to win the sweepstakes, that making a purchase will not improve their chances of winning, and that all entries have the same chance to win whether or not the entry is accompanied by a purchase.

The UK edition of &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot; has also been criticized by the Trading Standards Institute for preying on the elderly and vulnerable with misleading bulk mailings that claim the recipient is guaranteed a large cash prize and advising them not to discuss this with anyone else. Following their complaint, the Advertising Standards Authority said they would be launching an investigation. The ASA investigation upheld the complaint in 2008, ruling that the &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot; mailing was irresponsible and misleading (particularly for the elderly) and had breached three clauses of the Committee of Advertising Practice code. &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot; was told not to use this mailing again.

==International editions==
International editions have made &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot; the best-selling monthly journal in the world. Its worldwide circulation including all editions has reached 17 million copies and 70 million readers. &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot; is currently published in 49 editions and 21 languages and is available in over 70 countries, including Slovenia, Croatia, and Romania in 2008.

Its international editions account for about 50% of the magazine&#x27;s trade volume. In each market, local editors commission or purchase articles for their own markets and share content with U.S. and other editions. The selected articles are then translated by local translators and the translations edited by the local editors to make them match the &quot;well-educated informal&quot; style of the American edition.

Over the 90 years, the company has published editions in various languages in different countries, or for different regions. Often, these editions started out as translations of the U.S. version of the magazine, but over time they became unique editions, providing material more germane to local readers. Local editions that still publish the bulk of the American &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot; are usually titled with a qualifier, such as the Portuguese edition, (&quot;Selections from Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot;), or the Swedish edition, (&quot;The Best of Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot;).

The list is sorted by year of first publication. Some countries had editions but no longer do; for example, the Danish version of &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot; () ceased publication in 2005 and was replaced by the Swedish version (&quot;Det Bästa&quot;); as a result, the Swedish edition covers stories about both countries (but written solely in Swedish).

=== United Kingdom edition ===
The United Kingdom edition first published in 1938. Decades later Reader&#x27;s Digest UK went into administration in 2010 due a £125 million pension fund deficit. Private equity fund Better Capital paid around £14 million for the brand and invested a further £9 million into the business. Better Capital sold Reader&#x27;s Digest UK in 2013 for a nominal fee to venture capitalist Mike Luckwell. The brand was sold again in 2018 to its former chief executive Gary Hopkins. The magazine ceased publication after 86 years in April 2024.

===Arabic editions===
The first &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot; publication in the Arab World was printed in Egypt in September 1943. The license was eventually withdrawn.

The second effort and the first &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot; franchise agreement was negotiated through the efforts of Frederick Pittera, in 1976, an American entrepreneur, who sold the idea to Lebanon&#x27;s former foreign minister, Lucien Dahdah, then son-in-law of Suleiman Frangieh, President of Lebanon. Dahdah partnered with Ghassan Tueni (former Lebanon ambassador to the United Nations, and publisher of newspaper, Beirut) in publishing &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot; in the Arabic language. It was printed in Cairo for distribution throughout the Arab world under title . In format, was the same as the U.S. edition with 75% of the editorial content. Philip Hitti, Chairman of Princeton University&#x27;s Department of Oriental Languages and a team of Arabic advisers counseled on what would be of interest to Arabic readers. The publication of ceased in April 1993.

=== Canadian edition ===
The Canadian edition first appeared in July 1947 in French and in February 1948 in English; today, the vast majority of its content is Canadian. Nearly all major and minor articles are locally produced or selected from Canadian publications that match the &quot;Digest&quot; style. Usually, there is one American article in each issue.

&quot;Life&#x27;s Like That&quot; is the Canadian name of &quot;Life in These United States&quot;. Most of the other rubrics are taken from the American publication.

On December 6, 2023, it was announced that Reader&#x27;s Digest Canada would cease publication in the spring of 2024.

===Indian edition===
The Indian edition was first published in 1954. Its circulation then was 40,000 copies. It was published for many years by the Tata Group of companies. Today, the magazine is published in India by Living Media India Ltd, and sold over 600,000. It prints Indian and international articles. According to the Indian Readership Survey Round II of 2009, the readership for &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot; was 3.94 million, second only to &quot;India Today&quot; at 5.62 million. That has since declined. In the 2017 Survey, the India edition had fallen to ninth position with a readership of 1.354 million, and in the latest Survey (Quarter 1 of 2019), it is not in the Top 10 list of English-language magazines published in India.

According to readership estimates by Roy Morgan, &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest Australia&quot; had an average readership per issue of 362,000 as at September 2023.

<doc id="465442" wikidata="Q300946" url="?curid=465442" title="Pacific white-sided dolphin">
<text>The Pacific white-sided dolphin (Lagenorhynchus obliquidens), also known as the hookfin porpoise, is an active dolphin found in the cool or temperate waters of the North Pacific Ocean.

==Taxonomy==
The Pacific white-sided dolphin was named by Smithsonian mammalogist Theodore Nicholas Gill in 1865. It is morphologically similar to the dusky dolphin, which is found in the South Pacific. Genetic analysis by Frank Cipriano suggests the two species diverged around two million years ago.

Though traditionally placed in the genus &quot;Lagenorhynchus&quot;, molecular analyses indicate they are closer to dolphins of the genus &quot;Cephalorhynchus&quot;, in the Lissodelphininae subfamily, than to both the Atlantic white-sided dolphin and the White-beaked dolphin. It has therefore been proposed to move the Pacific white-sided dolphin to the resurrected genus &quot;Sagmatias&quot; together with other southern hemisphere &quot;Lagenorhyncus&quot; species (hourglass dolphin, Dusky dolphin and Peale&#x27;s dolphin). However, the detailed phylogenetic relationships within this group of dolphins is still not fully elucidated.

==Description==

The Pacific white-sided dolphin has three colors. The chin, throat and belly are creamy white. The beak, flippers, back, and dorsal fin are a dark gray. Light gray patches are seen on the sides and a further light gray stripe runs from above the eye to below the dorsal fin, where it thickens along the tail stock. A dark gray ring surrounds the eyes.

The species is an average-sized oceanic dolphin. Females weigh up to and males with males reaching and females in length. Pacific white-sided dolphins usually tend to be larger than dusky dolphins. Females reach maturity at seven years. From 1990 to 1991, a study conducted by Richard C. Ferrero and William A. Walker revealed the vast majority of Pacific white-sided dolphins that fell victim to the drift nets were between the ages of 8.3 and 11 when they sexually matured. The gestation period usually last for one year. Individuals are believed to live up 40 years or more.

The Pacific white-sided dolphin is extremely active and mixes with many of the other North Pacific cetacean species. It readily approaches boats and bow-rides. Large groups are common, averaging 90 individuals, with supergroups of more than 300. Prey includes mainly hake, anchovies, squid, herring, salmon, and cod.

They have an average of 60 teeth.

==Range and habitat==
The range of the Pacific white-sided dolphin arcs across the cool to temperate waters of the North Pacific. Sightings go no further south than the South China Sea on the western side and the Baja California Peninsula on the eastern. Populations may also be found in the Sea of Japan and the Sea of Okhotsk. In the northern part of the range, some individuals may be found in the Bering Sea. The dolphins appear to follow some sort of migratory pattern – on the eastern side they are most abundant in the Southern California Bight in winter, but further north (Oregon, Washington) in summer. Their preference for off-shore deep waters appears to be year-round. The only known predator of the Pacific white-sided dolphin is the killer whale, but at least one case of predation by the great white shark has been recorded.

The total population may be as many as 1 million. However, the tendency of Pacific white-sided dolphins to approach boats complicates precise estimates via sampling.

==Behavior==

These dolphins keep close company. White-sided dolphins swim in groups of 10 to 100, and can often be seen bow-riding and doing somersaults. Members form a close-knit group and will often care for a sick or injured dolphin. Animals that live in such large social groups develop ways to keep in touch, with each dolphin identifying itself by a unique name-whistle. Young dolphins communicate with a touch of a flipper as they swim beside adults.

Studies conducted on Pacific white-sided dolphins, as well as Risso&#x27;s dolphin have revealed a multitude of things about how they communicate as a species, which was revealed to be vastly different from bottlenose dolphins and common dolphins. The studies have revealed that their notches and spectral peaks happen to be more low pitched when juxtaposed with the bottlenose dolphins and common dolphins as mentioned earlier. Other studies have revealed similar behaviors. Two studies conducted back in 2010 and 2011 revealed that the vocalizations of Pacific white-sided dolphins can range differently only from their behavioral states, indicating strong similarities between the acoustic and surface behavior for various foraging behaviors, including the possibility of an undescribed subspecies. The oceanographical data in the area can also effect the behavioral patterns of the dolphins. The studies also revealed that the different types of echolocations do vary based on the geographical locations; the first population of Pacific white-sided dolphins that were observed, inhabiting the waters near the Pacific United States seemed to more activity during the night while the second population of Pacific white-sided dolphins, that were also observed, inhabiting areas near Baja California, were observed to be more active during the day, possibly due the seasons and the dolphins&#x27; search for prey.

The first sighting of the species on Commander Islands involved a single dolphin to travel along with a pod of killer whales in 2013.

Pacific white-sided dolphins are known to sleep on average seven hours a night.

==Relation to humans==
===Protection===
Until the United Nations banned certain types of large fishing nets in 1933, many Pacific white-sided dolphins were killed in drift nets. Some animals are still killed each year by Japanese hunting drives.

===Captivity===
Although overshadowed in popularity by bottlenose dolphins, Pacific white-sided dolphins are also a part of some marine theme park shows. Roughly 100 reside in dolphinaria in North America and Japan. In captivity, they tend to consume less amounts of food when compared to their wild counterparts, this could be the case due to the fact of temperatures changing in the water based on the seasons. However, the condition in which the dolphins lives, most likely in an aquarium tank, will impact how much energy is required for a captive dolphin to thrive in captivity. Studies have also shown that the highest amount of food intake that a captive Pacific white-sided dolphin displays in autumn when the dolphin increase their food intake as well as their body mass.

<text>In cricket, a [[No-ball|no-ball]] (in the Laws and regulations: &quot;No ball&quot;) is a type of illegal delivery to a batter (the other type being a wide). It is also a type of extra, being the run awarded to the batting team as a consequence of the illegal delivery. For most cricket games, especially amateur, the definition of all forms of no-ball is from the MCC &quot;Laws of Cricket.&quot;

Originally &quot;no Ball&quot; was called when a bowler overstepped the bowling crease, requiring them to try again to bowl a fair ball.

As the game developed, &quot;No ball&quot; has also been called for an unfair ball delivered round-arm, over-arm or thrown, eventually resulting in today&#x27;s over-arm bowling being the only legal style.

Technical infringements, and practices considered unfair or dangerous, have been added for bowling, field placement, fielder and wicket-keeper actions. &quot;No-ball&quot; has become a passage of play.

The delivery of a no-ball results in one run – two under some regulations – to be added to the batting team&#x27;s overall score, and an additional ball must be bowled. In addition, the number of ways in which the batter can be given out is reduced to three. In shorter competition cricket, a batter receives a free hit on the ball after any kind of no-ball, which means the batter can freely hit that one ball with no danger of being out in most ways.

No-balls due to overstepping the crease are common, especially in short form cricket, and fast bowlers tend to bowl them more often than spin bowlers.

It is also a no-ball when the bowler&#x27;s back foot lands touching or wide of the return crease.

Any of the many no-ball cases is at least &#x27;unfair&#x27; to the extent that the batting team is given a fair ball and a penalty run in compensation. Some no-balls are given under Law 41 &#x27;Unfair Play&#x27; and hence have further repercussions: a fast short pitched delivery (a &quot;bouncer&quot;) may be judged to be a no-ball by the umpire (Law 41.6), and any high full-pitched delivery (a &quot;beamer&quot;, Law 41.7), or any deliberate front-foot fault (deliberate overstepping, Law 41.8), is inherently dangerous or unfair.

Any beamer is unfair and therefore a no-ball, but the umpire may judge that a particular beamer is not also dangerous, and does not warrant a warning or suspension.

For deliberate beamers and deliberate overstepping, the bowler may be suspended from bowling immediately, and the incident reported. For other dangerous and unfair no-balls, or for throwing, repetition will have additional consequences for the bowler and team. The bowler may be suspended from bowling in the game, reported, and required to undertake remedial work on their bowling action.

==Causes==
A no-ball may be called for several reasons, most commonly because the bowler breaks the first rule below (a &quot;front foot no-ball&quot;), and also frequently as a result of dangerous or unfair bowling.

Note that if a ball qualifies as both a no-ball and a wide, it is a no-ball.

The umpire will call a no-ball in any of the following situations:

===Illegal action by the bowler===
====Position of feet====
&quot;Overstepping&quot;
* If the bowler bowls without some part of the front foot behind the popping crease (either grounded or in the air) when it lands. If the front foot of a bowler lands behind the crease and slides beyond, then it is not a no-ball. If the foot lands beyond the crease, it is a no-ball. It &quot;is&quot; legal for a spin bowler, for example, to land with their toe spikes grounded wholly in front of the crease but to have their heel in the air behind that line. The bowler must satisfy the umpire that some part of the foot lands initially behind the line, and in big games this question is now subject to minute examination by television replay. Recent practice has been to allow the &quot;bowler&quot; the benefit of any residual doubt in this judgement. Note: &quot;the crease&quot; refers to the inside edge of the painted line, not the line itself.
&quot;Wide of the Crease&quot;
* If the bowler bowls with any part of the back foot wide of - i.e. on or outside the line of - the return crease when it lands. Any part of the back foot can legally be in the air outside of the crease, and it can be even be grounded after landing. It is legal for a spin bowler, for example, to land with their toe spikes grounded wholly within the return crease but to have their heel in the air wide of that line. The bowler must satisfy the umpire that no part of the foot lands initially on or outside the line, and again if it ever (rarely) arises in big games this question may now be subject to minute examination. In one example New Zealand slow bowler Glenn Phillips was shown on Umpire Review replay to have grounded almost his entire back foot wide of the return crease in the act of bowling a wicket-taking ball to Jos Buttler, but was adjudged to have grounded only the toe in the act of landing, and this wholly within the return crease, thus the ball was adjudged legal by the third umpire, and the batter given out. 

&quot;One side of the Wicket&quot;
*If the bowler bowls without some part of the front foot landing either grounded or in the air on the same side of the wicket as the back foot lands.

====Method of delivery====
* If the bowler throws, rather than bowls, the ball. (See bowling, bowling action and especially throwing for an explanation.)
* If the bowler breaks the non-striker&#x27;s wicket during the act of delivery (unless attempting to run out the non-striker).
* If the bowler changes the arm with which they bowl without notifying the umpire.
* If the bowler changes the side of the wicket from which they bowl without notifying the umpire.
* If the bowler bowls underarm unless this style of delivery is agreed before the match.
* If the ball bounces more than once, or rolls along the ground, before reaching the popping crease at the striker&#x27;s end.
* If the ball bounces not wholly within the 10 foot width of a full pitch, or bounces wholly or partly on an artificial surface next to the pitch, or bounces not wholly on the artificial surface in use.
* If the ball comes to rest in front of the line of the striker&#x27;s wicket.
* If the ball is so far from the pitch that the batter would be obliged to leave the pitch to play it

====Unfair / dangerous bowling====

* If the ball does not touch the ground in its flight between the wickets and reaches the batter &quot;on the full&quot; (this delivery is called a &quot;beamer&quot;) over waist height. &#x27;Waist&#x27; means the top of the trousers when the batter is standing upright at the popping crease. 
* If the bowler bowls any fast short pitch ball (bouncer) that, taking into account its trajectory and the skill of the batter, is dangerous. 
* If the bowler bowls a ball that bounces and passes the batter above head height 
* If the bowler repeatedly bowls balls that bounce and pass the batter above head height, the bowling can also be judged unfair by the umpire under Law 41, even if not dangerous as above, and incurs the same sanctions.

In professional cricket, the Laws of Cricket are often modified by a playing regulation that any ball over head height is a Wide ball, but a second fast ball above shoulder height in an over is a no-ball, e.g. in International T20 Cricket and IPLT20. But in International One-Day Cricket and in Test Cricket, two fast pitched short balls per over may pass over shoulder height before no-ball is called, and again any ball over head height is a Wide. Thus competition rules may both tone down the definition of &#x27;dangerous and unfair&#x27; (a Wide is a lesser sanction than a no-ball, and cannot be applied if the batter hits, or is hit by, the delivery) and put definite limits on repetition, intended not only to protect the batter but also to maintain a fair contest between bat and ball, preventing such bowling being used to limit the batter&#x27;s ability to score. There is presently some difference of opinion between the authorities that is evident in the differences between Law and regulation.

===Illegal action by a fielder===
* If the wicket keeper moves any part of their person in front of the line of the stumps before either a) the ball strikes the batter&#x27;s person or bat; or b) the ball passes the line of the stumps.
* If a fielder (not including bowler) has any part of their body grounded or in the air over the pitch.
* If a fielder intercepts the ball before it has hit the striker or their bat or passed their wicket. The ball also becomes dead immediately.
* If there are more than two fielders that are on the leg side and behind the batter&#x27;s crease.
* Under certain playing conditions, further restrictions apply to the placement of fielders. For example in One Day International cricket, there can be no more than five fielders a) on the on side; and b) outside the 30-yard circle. (The bowler is not a fielder when counting fielder placement).

==Umpire making the call of no-ball==
By default, it is the bowler&#x27;s end umpire who calls and signals no-ball. When judgement of ball height is required (for beamers and short balls), their colleague (the striker&#x27;s end umpire) may assist them with a signal.

Either umpire may call a bowler for throwing, although the striker&#x27;s end umpire is naturally better-placed, and so has the primary responsibility.

The striker&#x27;s end umpire calls no-ball for infringement by the wicket-keeper, and for position of the fielders, but the bowler&#x27;s end umpire calls no-ball for fielder encroachment on the wicket.

After what would have been a wicket-taking event, the umpire can call and signal a no-ball, and even call back a batter who has not left the field of play.

The bowler&#x27;s end umpire initially signals a foot-fault no-ball by holding one arm out horizontally and calling &quot;no-ball&quot;, which may give the batter some warning that the ball is an illegal delivery. Other reasons for a no-ball, e.g. illegal position of fielder, throwing the ball, or height of delivery, are initially judged by the striker&#x27;s end umpire, who indicates their judgement to the bowler&#x27;s end umpire.

When the ball is dead, the umpire will repeat the no-ball hand signal for the benefit of the scorers, and wait for their acknowledgement.

==Effects==

===Dismissal===
A batter may not be given out bowled, leg before wicket, caught, stumped or hit wicket off a no-ball. A batter may be given out run out, hit the ball twice or obstructing the field. Thus the call of no-ball protects the batter against losing their wicket in ways that are attributed to the bowler, but not in ways that are attributed to the batter&#x27;s running or conduct.

A batter may even be given out Run out not attempting a run, just as if the ball were legal, except for the case that would be stumped were it not a no-ball, i.e. it is not out if the batter is not attempting a run and the wicket keeper puts the wicket down without the intervention of another fielder. The keeper can still run out the batter if they move to attempt a run.

===Runs===
When a no-ball is bowled, runs are awarded to the batting team. In Test cricket, One Day International cricket and T20 International cricket, the award is one run; in some domestic competitions, particularly one-day cricket competitions, the award is two runs. All such runs are scored as extras and are added to the batting team&#x27;s total, but are not credited to the batter. For scoring, no-balls are considered to be the fault of the bowler (even if the infringement was committed by a fielder), and are recorded against the bowler&#x27;s record in their bowling analysis.

In addition, if the batter hits the ball they may also take runs as normal, which are credited to them. If they do not hit it, byes or leg byes may be scored. Depending on the reason for the umpire&#x27;s call of &#x27;no-ball&#x27; (and hence its timing), the speed of the call, the speed of the delivery and the batter&#x27;s reactions, the batter may be able to play a more aggressive shot at the delivery, safe in the knowledge that they cannot be dismissed by most methods.

===Additional delivery===
A no-ball does not count as one of the (usually six) legal deliveries in an over, and so another delivery must be bowled. That delivery may also be ruled a no-ball or Wide, in which case another delivery must be bowled, and so on until a legal delivery is effected, after which one ball is deemed to have been bowled towards the (usually six) legal balls required for one over, which then continues as normal.

====Free hit====

If this competition mandates a free hit for the type of no-ball adjudged, the bowler&#x27;s end umpire will signal that the additional delivery is a free hit by making circular movements in the air by extending one raised hand above their head. The next delivery is then the &quot;free hit delivery,&quot; and the batter is protected from the stated ways of being out from a no-ball, just as for the prior no-ball delivery that caused the free-hit delivery. Similarly to any no-ball, if this free hit delivery is a wide or a no-ball, the umpire is required to signal the free hit again, another free hit delivery is bowled, and so on until a legal ball is delivered.

===Other effects===

====Dangerous and unfair play====
As stated above, the effects of no-balls may be cumulative, and may reach beyond the completion of the game. Law 41 deals with dangerous and unfair play, and no-balls, in common with most transgressions of Law 41, may cause the umpires to initiate further sanctions. The bowler may be prevented from bowling for the rest of the innings, may face disciplinary action by bodies governing the game, and may be required to change the way they bowl. This is also the case for a bowler called under Law 21 for throwing. Sanctions now also apply for the deliberate bowling of front foot no-balls. Law 41 gives the umpires specific duties to ensure the safe conduct of the game in the case of unfair bowling.

Throughout cricket history, there have been occasions when the fielding team has needed to encourage the batting team to score freely and quickly, usually when enticing them not to settle for a draw, but sometimes to satisfy some competition rule. In some such cases, especially when the end of the match requires the completion of a specified number of overs, the fielding captain has encouraged the bowler to bowl deliberate no-balls by overstepping. Sometimes it has proved to be an ill-judged idea that risked both bringing the game into disrepute and losing the match, e.g. From Oct 2017, this specific resort is no longer available, as a side-effect of the fact that deliberate overstepping will immediately be ruled &quot;dangerous and unfair&quot; by the umpire, but no-balls that breach other parts of the Law might still be concocted deliberately without being ruled unfair.

====Umpire Decision Review System====
Special complications arise in the professional game when technology is used to assist the umpires, and overturn a decision made on the field. Video review by the third umpire may reveal that a no-ball should have been called (especially for overstepping or a beamer) when the batter has been given out. If so, the ball is deemed to be dead from the moment of the &#x27;dismissal event,&#x27; and any runs scored after that point (runs, byes or leg byes) will not count, but the batting team do get the no-ball penalty. It is now customary for a batter given out to stand at the edge of the playing area and wait to see if the video may discover a no-ball, in which case they are reinstated. If the batsmen have crossed in running, the batsmen do not return to their original ends. Video review may also reveal that a no-ball should NOT have been called, in which case the ball becomes dead at the time of the on-field call.

Further consequences can occur in cases when the on-field decision has been overturned. For example, the batter is given out LBW, but the ball runs away off the pads, for what would be 4 leg-byes that win the game. The bowling side is thought to have won. The review adjudges the bowler to have overstepped. The batting team are awarded only a 1 run penalty for the no-ball, and an extra ball or free hit, but fail to score off it, and the bowling side still win, even though the batting side would have won if the umpire&#x27;s decision had matched the video evidence discovered, although perhaps the fielding side might have tried harder to save the 4 leg byes had they known the match depended on it. For such complications and other reasons, including concern to control the amount of time used in review, the ICC is experimenting with &#x27;no-ball instant notification,&#x27; under which the umpire is immediately given the additional information to call no-ball while the ball is still live.

If a &#x27;Player Review&#x27; requested by the fielding side upholds a decision of &#x27;Not Out&#x27;, but a no-ball is discovered by the review, that review does not count as unsuccessful, and does not expend the reviews allocated to them.

====Relationship with Penalty Runs====
Unlike some breaches of Law 41, a no-ball only attracts the no-ball penalty (e.g. one run), there are no provisions in the Law or in common regulations for five penalty runs to be awarded to the batting team, and there are no incidents when five penalty runs are awarded that would require a no-ball to be called, although scenarios exist in which five penalty runs might be awarded when the ball is in play and would count in the over, were it not a no-ball for the reasons given here, for example: repeated damage to the wicket by the fielding team during a no-ball, or the ball hits a helmet on the ground during a no-ball.

==History==
The 1774 Laws of Cricket state &quot;The bowler must deliver the Ball with one foot behind the Crease even with the wicket ... If he delivers the Ball with his hinder foot over the Bowling crease the Umpire shall call no Ball (sic), though she be struck or the player is Bowled out; which he shall do without being asked, and no Person shall have any right to ask him.&quot;

In the 1788 MCC code this became &quot;The Bowler Shall deliver the Ball with one foot behind the Bowling Crease, and within the Return Crease...if the Bowler&#x27;s foot is not behind the Bowling Crease, and within the return Crease, when he delivers the Ball, [the Umpires] must, unasked, call &quot;No Ball&quot;.&quot;

The early Laws do not define any consequence of &quot;No Ball&quot;. It is implied that, when called &quot;No Ball&quot;, the ball was not in play, probably regarded as &#x27;dead,&#x27; and the batting team did not benefit. No &#x27;notch&#x27; was scored.

At some point before 1811, the batter was allowed to score runs from the no-ball, and was protected from being out, except by being run out. By this change the no-ball became a passage of play, and was probably intended to restrain the development of roundarm bowling. Further complicated modifications were made before 1817, then simplifications between 1825 and 1828 that expressly forbade roundarm.

In 1829 the one run penalty was introduced for a no-ball when no run was scored otherwise.

The 1835 code legitimised roundarm bowling, and prevented overarm bowling by penalty of no-ball (see also 1835 English cricket season). The previous Laws did not disbar either, but had been interpreted variously by umpires reflecting custom and practice, at some cost to the careers of the bowling innovators. Further changes were made in 1845, and in 1864 bowlers were finally free to bowl overarm, enshrined in the pithy phrase &quot;The ball must be bowled.&quot;

In 1835 The Umpire was required to call no-ball immediately the ball was delivered.

Under the 1884 code, a no-ball was called under Law 10 &quot;The ball must be bowled; if thrown or jerked the umpire shall call &quot;No ball.&quot;&quot; and Law 11 &quot;The bowler shall deliver the ball with one foot on the ground behind the bowling crease, and within the return crease, otherwise the umpire shall call &quot;No ball.&quot;&quot; Law 16 provided that &quot;if no run be made one run shall be added to that score.&quot; Other detail was codified by Laws 13 (not to count in over), 16 (scoring runs and protection from being out), 17 (scoring of extras), 35 (failed attempt at run out before delivery), 48A (umpire call of no-ball) and 48B (umpire to make call immediately) 

===1900s===

A 1912 revision ruled that the batter could not be stumped from a no-ball. This caused difficulty until 1947 when the distinction between &#x27;run out&#x27; and &#x27;stumped&#x27; was clarified.

The 1947 code removed the requirement for the bowler&#x27;s back foot to be on the ground behind the bowling crease at the moment of delivery. The change codified general umpiring practice, as the judgement had proved difficult to make.

Until 1963, a no-ball was called when the bowler&#x27;s back foot landed over the bowling crease (which is why the bowling crease was so called), exactly as in 1774. But it was felt that the tallest fast bowlers, able to bowl legally with their front foot well over the popping crease, were gaining too great an advantage. Bowlers also became skilled in dragging their back foot. The change in the Law led to an increase in no-balls: in the 1962–63 series between Australia and England there were 5 no-balls; in the series between the two teams three years later there were 25.

Until 1957, there was no limitation on fielders behind square on the leg side. The change is often attributed to the desire to thwart bodyline, but the Bodyline Controversy was in 1933. The conservative instincts of cricket, and the intervention of World War II, may have been factors in the delay, but as the bodyline article explains, there was more than one reason for the change. Initially a no-ball under &quot;Experimental Note 3 to Law 44&quot; was confined to first class cricket (including all international cricket) and became part of the Laws of Cricket as Law 41.2 in 1980.

In 1980, the main codification of no-ball Law became Law 24, with no-balls also called under Law 40 (the wicket-keeper), Law 41 (the fielder) and Law 42 (Unfair Play). The new code made encroachment onto the wicket by the wicket-keeper and fielders a no-ball. In old film footage, for example of Underwood&#x27;s Test in 1968, close fielders can be seen in positions that would nowadays cause a no-ball to be called . Previously the fielder could stand anywhere as long as they were still, did not distract the batter, nor interfere with their right to play the ball. Umpires would conventionally intervene if a player&#x27;s shadow fell on the pitch, which is still widely treated as a distraction, but not inherently a no-ball.

Prior to 1980, if the wicket keeper took the ball in front of the stumps the umpire would turn down any appeal for a stumping, but would not have called no-ball.

Since the mid 1980s, no-balls have been accounted against the bowler in calculating their statistics 

 The 1947 code explicitly provided, in Law 26 Note 4, that it was not a no-ball if the bowler broke the bowler&#x27;s end wicket. No such explicit words appear in the 1980 code.

===2000s===

From 30 April 2013 (ICC playing regulation) and 1 Oct 2013 (Law) a no-ball results when the bowler breaks the non-striker&#x27;s wicket during the act of delivery. For a short period prior to this, umpires had adopted the convention of calling &#x27;dead ball&#x27; when this happened. See Steven Finn for origins of the change.

The year 2000 Code was a major change, and added the no-ball sanction for waist-high fast beamers, balls bouncing over head height, and balls bouncing more than twice or coming to rest in front of the striker. It also removed the judgement of intent to intimidate on fast short pitched bowling.

Prior to 2000, one no-ball run penalty was only scored if no runs were scored otherwise.

From October 2007 all foot-fault no-balls bowled in One Day Internationals resulted in a free hit.

From 5 July 2015 &quot;all&quot; no-balls bowled in either One Day Internationals or Twenty20 Internationals resulted in a free hit.

From 2013 some competitions outlawed the double-bounce ball in order to thwart negative developments in bowling 

The change to a maximum of one single bounce became Law in all forms of cricket in the Oct 2017 Law code, which also outlawed a ball that bounced off the pitch even if it then became playable.

Between 2000 and 2017, a beamer was judged a no-ball under the Laws of Cricket if it passed the batter above waist height, when delivered by a fast bowler, or above the shoulder when delivered by a slow bowler. The professional regulations did not tolerate the slow shoulder-high beamer. The Oct 2017 changes set the limit for beamers in all cricket at waist height, regardless of delivery speed.

The Oct 2017 Law code changes also removed the need for repetition before calling a no-ball for dangerous short-pitched bowling (bouncers), introduced the judgement of repetition in head-high bouncers as unfair, and treated a deliberate front foot no-ball as &#x27;dangerous or unfair,&#x27; with immediate sanctions as for a deliberate beamer. The new code reduced the warning for throwing to one first and final, instead of the two warnings that had existed since 2000. An explicit penalty for underarm bowling was stipulated, although such bowling was deemed a no-ball in 2000. Interception of the ball by a fielder before reaching the batter became an explicit no-ball.

Laws were also renumbered so that no-balls are now called under Law 21 (was 24), with no-balls also called under Law 27 - the Wicket-Keeper (was 40), Law 28 - the Fielder (was 41) and Law 41 - Unfair Play (was 42).

Prior to 2017 any byes and leg byes taken from a no-ball were scored as no-ball extras, but are now scored as bye and leg bye extras.

From April 2019 any beamer is unfair and therefore a no-ball, but the Umpire can now judge that a particular beamer is not also dangerous, and does not warrant a warning or suspension. The 2019 code defines what &#x27;waist&#x27; means for the first time.

From 2022, Law 25.8 asserts the striker&#x27;s right to play the ball, but within limits to ensure they do not risk contact with the fielders. Thus any delivery that requires the striker to leave the pitch is immediately judged and called a dead ball, and a no-ball awarded in recompense.
 The new no-ball case is grouped together with &quot;ball coming to rest in front of striker&#x27;s wicket&quot; under existing no-ball Law 21.8.

Also from 2022 the rarely-exercised provision for the bowler throwing ball towards striker&#x27;s wicket before entering the &quot;delivery stride&quot; in an attempt to run out a striker is no longer a no-ball: if it is attempted the umpire should now just call dead ball. The old Law was said to be a source of confusion.

==Scoring notation==

The conventional notation for a no-ball is a circle, and it can be abbreviated &quot;nb&quot;. If the batter hits the ball and takes runs, a boundary 4 or boundary 6 off the delivery, then the runs are marked inside the circle. In practice it is easier to write down the number then encircle it. 
If the batsmen run byes following a no-ball, or the ball runs to the boundary for 4 byes, each bye taken is marked with a dot inside the circle. Again it is easier to encircle the dots.

==Capitalisation convention and grammar==
Both the MCC Laws of Cricket and the ICC Playing Conditions use the capitalisation convention &quot;No ball&quot; throughout, though most major news sources prefer &quot;no-ball&quot;, which is standard English usage.

The grammar is significant in the history and development of the game as outlined above: initially a no Ball is a non-event: when the Umpire calls &quot;no Ball&quot; they mean nothing has happened - there has been no Ball. It would have been inexplicable to hyphenate the phrase, or capitalise the &quot;No&quot; rather than the &quot;Ball,&quot; since there is initially no event called &quot;No ball,&quot; simply the absence of any Ball.

&quot;No ball&quot; evolved as a concept and sanction in the Law to prevent disruptive late Georgian innovation. A &quot;No ball&quot; is no longer just the absence of a &quot;Ball,&quot; it is the occurrence of an unacceptable practice for which legislation and consequence is provided. Eventually a &quot;No ball&quot; became an active passage of play in which runs are scored and batsmen can even be out.

The modern usage, &quot;no-ball&quot; as a compound phrase arises in part because finally a no-ball is a commonplace event in its own right, one that leads occasionally even to international diplomatic flurries or even imprisonment. It is used both as a noun-phrase and a verb-phrase, &quot;The Umpire will no-ball you ...&quot;

<text>A three-decker was a sailing warship which carried her principal carriage-mounted guns on three fully armed decks. Usually additional (smaller) guns were carried on the upper works (forecastle and quarterdeck), but this was not a continuous battery and so did not count as a &quot;fourth deck&quot;. Three-deckers were usually &quot;ships of the line&quot;, i.e. of sufficient strength to participate in the line of battle, and in the rating system of the Royal Navy were generally classed as first or second rates, although from the mid-1690s until the 1750s the larger of the third rates were also three-deckers.

Three-deckers also served in the naval forces of other European states, notably those of France, Russia and Spain. The French definition of a three-decker differed from that of the English Navy until 1690, as some ships that were officially termed &quot;three-deckers&quot; prior to this date had only a partially-armed third tier of guns, with a significant gap between the guns in the forward portion of that deck and the guns in the aft portion of that deck. In some of these nominal three-deckers this division constituted a structural gap separating the forward and aft sections of this deck, so that these vessels would have been described as &quot;two-deckers&quot; in equivalent English warships.

==Respect of a patriotic community==
Three-deckers held special respect among the local community and the troops who farewelled these ships when they left the harbour. Such patriotism was expressed when HMS &quot;Britannia&quot; left Portsmouth bound for active service in the Mediterranean, in October 1840:

<text>Trierarch () was the title of officers who commanded a trireme (&quot;triēres&quot;) in the classical Greek world. 

In Classical Athens, the title was associated with the trierarchy (τριηραρχία, &quot;triērarchia&quot;), one of the public offices or liturgies, which were filled by wealthy citizens for a year. As the name implies, the trierarch was responsible for the outfitting and crewing of a trireme, and for commanding it in battle. Trierarchs thus had to be men of considerable means, since the expenses incurred could run as high as a talent in the course of a year. As the cost of the office was great, co-trierarchs (&quot;syntriērarchoi&quot;) were also appointed. By the 4th century BC, trierarchies in Athens were assumed by navy boards (&quot;symmoriai&quot;), as the financial burden of the job had become too great.

Katzenberg had frequently suggested an animated adaptation of the 1956 film &quot;The Ten Commandments&quot; while working for The Walt Disney Company, and he decided to put the idea into production after leaving Disney and co-founding DreamWorks Pictures in 1994. To make the project, DreamWorks employed artists who had worked for Walt Disney Feature Animation and Amblimation, totaling a crew of 350 people from 34 countries. The film has a blend of traditional animation and computer-generated imagery, created using software from Toon Boom Technologies and Silicon Graphics.

&quot;The Prince of Egypt&quot; premiered at Royce Hall in Los Angeles on December 16, 1998, and was released in theaters on December 18, followed by a release on home video on September 14, 1999. Reviews were generally positive; critics particularly praised the visuals, songs, score, and voice acting. The film grossed $218 million worldwide in theaters, which made it the most successful non-Disney animated feature at the time. The film&#x27;s success led to the direct-to-video prequel &quot;&quot; (2000), and a stage musical adaptation which opened in London&#x27;s West End in 2020.

The song &quot;When You Believe&quot; became a commercially successful single in a pop version performed by Whitney Houston and Mariah Carey, and went on to win Best Original Song at the 71st Academy Awards, making it the first animated film independently outside of Disney and Pixar films, as well as the first DreamWorks Animation film to receive Academy Awards, succeeded by &quot;Shrek&quot; (2001) and &quot;Wallace &amp; Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit&quot; (2005). The film also won the inaugural Critics&#x27; Choice Movie Award for Best Animated Feature, in a tie with Disney and Pixar&#x27;s &quot;A Bug&#x27;s Life&quot;.

In the decades since its release, &quot;The Prince of Egypt&quot; has been widely acclaimed and regarded as one of DreamWorks&#x27; best films, and one of the greatest animated films of all time.

== Plot ==

In Ancient Egypt, the enslaved Hebrew people pray to God for deliverance. Pharaoh Seti, fearing that the growing numbers of Hebrews could lead to rebellion, orders a mass infanticide of all newborn Hebrew boys. Yocheved and her children, Miriam and Aaron, rush to the Nile River, where she places her newborn son in a basket on the water, bidding him farewell with a final lullaby. Miriam follows the basket as it floats to Seti&#x27;s palace and witnesses her brother safely adopted by Seti&#x27;s wife, Queen Tuya, who names him Moses. Before leaving, Miriam prays that Moses will return to free the Hebrews.

Years later, Moses and his adoptive brother Rameses, heir to the throne of Egypt, are scolded by Seti for accidentally destroying a temple. After Moses suggests that Rameses be given the opportunity to prove his responsibility, Seti names Rameses prince regent. High priests Hotep and Huy offer Rameses a beautiful but rebellious young Midianite woman, Tzipporah. Moses humiliates Tzipporah by letting her fall into a pond after she refuses to submit, appeasing the crowd but disappointing Tuya. Rameses gives Tzipporah to Moses and appoints him Royal Chief Architect.

Later that night, Moses follows Tzipporah as she escapes from the palace, choosing not to stop her. He runs into the now-adult Miriam and Aaron whom he does not recognize. He disbelieves their claims and almost has them arrested until Miriam sings their mother&#x27;s lullaby, triggering Moses&#x27;s memory. He flees in denial, but learns the truth of Seti&#x27;s genocide from a nightmare, then from Seti himself, who disturbs Moses by claiming the Hebrews were &quot;only slaves&quot;. The next day, Moses tries to stop an Egyptian slave driver from flogging an elderly Hebrew slave, accidentally pushing the slave driver to his death. Horrified and ashamed, Moses flees into the desert in exile, despite Rameses&#x27;s pleas that he stay.

Arriving at an oasis, Moses defends three girls from brigands, only to realize their older sister is Tzipporah. Moses is welcomed by Jethro, Tzipporah&#x27;s father and the high priest of Midian, who helps Moses gain a more positive outlook on life. Moses becomes a shepherd, falls in love with Tzipporah, marries her, and grows adjusted to life in Midian. Moses discovers a burning bush, through which God tells him to return to Egypt and free the Hebrews. God bestows Moses&#x27;s shepherding staff with his power and promises that he will tell Moses what to say. When Moses tells Tzipporah of his task, she decides to join him.

Arriving in Egypt, Moses is happily greeted by Rameses, who is now Pharaoh with a wife and son. Moses demands the Hebrews&#x27; release and transforms his staff into a snake to demonstrate God&#x27;s power. Hotep and Huy deceptively recreate this transformation, only to have their snakes eaten by Moses&#x27;s. Not wanting to have his actions cause the empire&#x27;s collapse and feeling betrayed by Moses, Rameses denies Moses&#x27;s demand and doubles the Hebrews&#x27; workload.

The Hebrews, including Aaron, blame Moses for their increased workload, discouraging Moses, but Miriam inspires Moses to persevere. Moses casts the first of the Ten Plagues of Egypt by changing the waters of the Nile into blood, but Rameses remains unmoved. God inflicts eight more plagues onto Egypt: frogs, lice, flies, livestock pestilence, boils, hailfire, locusts, and prolonged darkness, but still Rameses refuses to relent, vowing never to release the Hebrews. Disheartened, Moses prepares the Hebrews for the tenth plague, instructing them to sacrifice a lamb and mark their doorposts with its blood. That night, the final plague kills all the firstborn sons of Egypt, including Rameses&#x27;s young son, while passing over the Hebrews&#x27; marked homes. Grief-stricken, Rameses permits the Hebrews to leave. After leaving the palace, Moses collapses in anguish and remorse.

The following morning, Moses, Miriam, Aaron and Tzipporah lead the Hebrews out of Egypt. Once at the Red Sea, a vengeful Rameses pursues them with his army, intent on killing them. However, a pillar of fire blocks the army&#x27;s way, while Moses uses his staff to part the sea. The Hebrews cross the open sea bottom; the fire vanishes and the army gives chase, but the sea closes over and drowns the Egyptian soldiers, sparing Rameses alone. Moses mournfully bids Rameses farewell and leads the Hebrews to Mount Sinai, where he receives the Ten Commandments.

== Production ==
=== Development ===

Former Walt Disney Studios chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg had always wanted to produce a film adaptation of the life of Moses. Katzenberg once stated, &quot;It was the project I was pushing for us to make, because it&#x27;s so different for an animated feature. This is an idea I had to do while I was still working for Disney.&quot; In April 1994, Disney Studios president Frank Wells was killed in a helicopter crash. Katzenberg had assumed that Michael Eisner would appoint him as Wells&#x27;s successor, but he refused. (In 1995, Eisner instead hired Michael Ovitz to fill the position). In August 1994, Eisner called Katzenberg into his office and handed him a four-page memorandum about impending staffing changes, which included Katzenberg&#x27;s immediate resignation. Katzenberg resigned on August 23, though he remained at Disney until September 1994.

The idea for &quot;The Prince of Egypt&quot; was discussed at the formation of DreamWorks Pictures on October 12, 1994, when Katzenberg&#x27;s partners, Amblin Entertainment founder Steven Spielberg, and music producer David Geffen, were meeting in Spielberg&#x27;s living room. Katzenberg had wanted to tackle &quot;bigger-than-life stories&quot;, like &quot;Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom&quot;, &quot;The Terminator&quot; (both 1984) and &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot; (1962). Katzenberg recalls that Spielberg looked at him during the meeting and said, &quot;You ought to do &quot;The Ten Commandments&quot;&quot;.

&quot;The Prince of Egypt&quot; was &quot;written&quot; throughout the story process. Beginning with a starting outline, story supervisors Kelly Asbury and Lorna Cook led a team of fourteen storyboard artists and writers as they sketched out the entire film—sequence by sequence. Once the storyboards were approved, they were put into the Avid Media Composer digital editing system by editor Nick Fletcher to create a &quot;story reel&quot; or animatic. The story reel allowed the filmmakers to view and edit the entire film in continuity before production began, and also helped the layout and animation departments understand what is happening in each sequence of the film.

After casting of the voice talent concluded, dialogue recording sessions began. For the film, the actors recorded individually in a studio under guidance by one of the three directors. The voice tracks were to become the primary aspect as to which the animators built their performances. Because DreamWorks was concerned about theological accuracy, Katzenberg decided to call in Biblical scholars, Christian, Jewish, and Muslim theologians, and Arab American leaders to help his film be more accurate and faithful to the original story. After previewing the developing film, all these leaders noted that the studio executives listened and responded to their ideas, and praised the studio for reaching out for comment from outside sources.

=== Animation and design ===
Art directors Kathy Altieri and Richard Chavez and production designer Darek Gogol led a team of nine visual development artists in setting a visual style for the film that was representative of the time, the scale and the architectural style of Ancient Egypt. Part of the process also included the research and collection of artwork from various artists, as well as taking part in trips such as a two-week journey across Egypt by the filmmakers in December 1995, before the film&#x27;s production began. The film&#x27;s look was inspired by Claude Monet (backgrounds) and David Lean (composition).

Character designers Carter Goodrich, Carlos Grangel and Nico Marlet worked on setting the design and overall look of the characters. Drawing on various inspirations for the widely known characters, the team of character designers worked on designs that had a more realistic feel than the usual animated characters up to that time. Both character design and art direction worked to set a definite distinction between the symmetrical, more angular look of the Egyptians versus the more organic, natural look of the Hebrews and their related environments. The backgrounds department, headed by supervisors Paul Lasaine and Ron Lukas, oversaw a team of artists who were responsible for painting the sets/backdrops from the layouts. Within the film, approximately 934 hand-painted backgrounds were created. While Katzenberg took the rest of the crew members to Egypt, the background supervisors visited Death Valley, California to study the colors, textures and landscapes.

The animation team for &quot;The Prince of Egypt&quot;, including 350 artists from 34 different nations, was primarily recruited both from Walt Disney Feature Animation, which had fallen under Katzenberg&#x27;s auspices while at the Walt Disney Company, and from Amblimation, a defunct division of Spielberg&#x27;s Amblin Entertainment. As at Disney&#x27;s, character animators were grouped into teams by character: for example, Kristof Serrand, as the supervising animator of Older Moses, set the acting style of the character and assigned scenes to his team. Consideration was given to depicting the ethnicities of the ancient Egyptians, Hebrews, and Nubians properly. The filmmakers initially worked out of Amblin Entertainment&#x27;s main offices on the Universal Studios Lot, but quickly outgrew them. In March 1995, as a temporary solution to accommodate increases in crew members, the studio was moved into the Lakeside Plaza facility, nearby on the lot. As animation increased at the Lakeside building, in June 1996, construction of DreamWorks&#x27; new animation studio in Glendale, California began, under Katzenberg&#x27;s supervision.

There are 1,192 scenes in the film, and 1,180 contain work done by the special effects department, which animates everything in an animated scene which is not a character: blowing wind, dust, rainwater, shadows, etc. A blend of traditional animation and computer-generated imagery was used in the depictions of the ten plagues of Egypt and the parting of the Red Sea. The Red Sea scene was animated by twelve people and took three years to complete. The characters were animated with the digital paint software Animo by Cambridge Animation (now merged with Toon Boom Technologies), and the compositing of the 2D and 3D elements was done using the &quot;Exposure Tool&quot;, a digital solution developed for Alias Research by Silicon Graphics. Additional final line animation was outsourced to Bardel Entertainment, Fox Animation Studios and Heart of Texas Productions.

=== Creating the voice of God ===
The task of creating God&#x27;s voice was given to Lon Bender and the team working with the film&#x27;s music composer, Hans Zimmer. According to Bender: &quot;The challenge with that voice was to try to evolve it into something that had not been heard before. We did a lot of research into the voices that had been used for past Hollywood movies as well as for radio shows, and we were trying to create something that had never been previously heard not only from a casting standpoint but from a voice manipulation standpoint as well&quot;. It was decided that the voice of God would be provided by Val Kilmer, who portrayed Moses in the film, in order to indicate that God was communicating with Moses via the voice he would otherwise perceive in his mind, as opposed to the &quot;larger-than-life tones&quot; used to portray God in previous theatrical releases.

== Music ==

Composer and lyricist Stephen Schwartz began working on writing songs for the film from the beginning of its production. As the story evolved, he continued to write songs that would serve both to entertain and help move the story along. Composer Hans Zimmer arranged and produced the songs and then eventually wrote the film&#x27;s score. The film&#x27;s score was recorded entirely in London.

Three soundtrack albums were released simultaneously for &quot;The Prince of Egypt&quot;, each of them aimed towards a different target audience. While the other two accompanying records, the country-themed &quot;Nashville&quot; soundtrack and the gospel-based &quot;Inspirational&quot; soundtrack, functioned as film tributes, the official &quot;The Prince of Egypt&quot; soundtrack contained the actual songs from the film. This album combines elements from the score composed by Hans Zimmer and film songs by Stephen Schwartz. The songs were either voiced over by professional singers, such as Salisbury Cathedral Choir, or sung by the film&#x27;s voice actors, such as Michelle Pfeiffer and Ofra Haza. Various tracks by contemporary artists such as K-Ci &amp; JoJo and Boyz II Men were added, including the Mariah Carey and Whitney Houston duet &quot;When You Believe&quot;, a Babyface rewrite of the original Schwartz composition, sung by Michelle Pfeiffer and Sally Dworsky in the film.

== Release ==
&quot;The Prince of Egypt&quot; had its premiere at UCLA&#x27;s Royce Hall on December 16, 1998, with its wide release occurring two days later. Despite being the inaugural production by DreamWorks Animation, it wound up the second to get a theatrical release, as &quot;Antz&quot; was rushed to reach theatres in October. The international release occurred simultaneously with that of the United States, as according to DreamWorks&#x27; distribution chief Jim Tharp, opening one week prior to the &quot;global holiday&quot; of Christmas, audiences all over the world would be available at the same time.

The accompanying marketing campaign was aimed to appeal to adults, usually averse to animated films. Merchandising was limited to a line of collectable figures and books. Walmart served as a promotional partner and offered in stores a package featuring two tickets to &quot;The Prince of Egypt&quot;, a storybook and the film&#x27;s soundtrack. Burger King promotions were scrapped as both DreamWorks and Burger King felt it would be a &quot;terrible disservice&quot; to push any kind of merchandise that would trivialize the film. &quot;The Prince of Egypt: Classic Edition&quot; storybook, published by Dutton Children&#x27;s Books in 1998, was written by Jane Yolen and illustrated by Michael Koelsch. Koelsch received an honorable mention from the Society of Illustrators for this book&#x27;s illustrations.

A 4K restoration of the film, remastered from the original 35mm camera negative under the supervision of the film&#x27;s directors, premiered at the Annecy International Animation Film Festival in June 2018, to commemorate the film&#x27;s 20th anniversary.

=== Home media ===
&quot;The Prince of Egypt&quot; was released on DVD, VHS, and LaserDisc in the United States on September 14, 1999. It was released worldwide over a two month period, the fastest global rollout for a home media release at the time. The ownership of the film was assumed by DreamWorks Animation (DWA) when that company split from DreamWorks Pictures in 2004; as of July 2018, the rights to the film are now owned by Universal Pictures via its acquisition of DWA. A Blu-ray of the film was released on October 16, 2018. For the 25th anniversary of the film, a 4K Blu-ray utilizing the remastered print from the 2018 Annecy Film Festival screening, was released on March 14, 2023 and grossed $58,803, but every release of the film on home media prior to the 4K Blu-ray used a 35mm interpositive print of the film, rather than using the original files to encode the film directly to digital.

== Reception ==
=== Box office ===
&quot;The Prince of Egypt&quot; grossed in the United States and Canada, and in other territories, for a worldwide total of .

In its opening weekend, the film grossed $14.5 million (a $4,658 average) from 3,118 theaters, finishing second place at the box office, behind &quot;You&#x27;ve Got Mail&quot;. The opening was seen as somewhat disappointing given the film&#x27;s high production and promotional costs, as well as the studio&#x27;s faith in the project, and industry insiders had doubts it could leg out to $100 million domestically. Due to the holiday season, the film gained 4% in its second weekend, earning $15.1 million and finishing in fourth place. It would hold well in its third weekend, with only a 25% drop to $11.2 million for a $3,511 average from 3,202 theaters and once again finishing in fourth place.

=== Critical response ===
On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 80% based on 93 reviews and an average rating of 7.1/10. The website&#x27;s critics consensus reads: &quot;&quot;The Prince of Egypt&quot;″s stunning visuals and first-rate voice cast more than compensate for the fact that it&#x27;s better crafted than it is emotionally involving&quot;. Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 64 out of 100 based on 26 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;A&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; praised the film in his review saying that &quot;&quot;The Prince of Egypt&quot; is one of the best-looking animated films ever made. It employs computer-generated animation as an aid to traditional techniques, rather than as a substitute for them, and we sense the touch of human artists in the vision behind the Egyptian monuments, the lonely desert vistas, the thrill of the chariot race, the personalities of the characters. This is a film that shows animation growing up and embracing more complex themes, instead of chaining itself in the category of children&#x27;s entertainment&quot;. Richard Corliss of &quot;Time&quot; magazine gave a negative review of the film saying that the film lacks creativity and joy. Stephen Hunter from &quot;The Washington Post&quot; praised the film saying that &quot;the movie&#x27;s proudest accomplishment is that it revises our version of Moses toward something more immediate and believable, more humanly knowable&quot;.

Lisa Alspector from the &quot;Chicago Reader&quot; praised the film and wrote: &quot;The blend of animation techniques somehow demonstrates mastery modestly, while the special effects are nothing short of magnificent&quot;. &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot; Jeff Millar praised the animation of &quot;Prince of Egypt&quot; and called it &quot;an amalgam of Hollywood biblical epic, Broadway supermusical and nice Sunday school lesson&quot;. James Berardinelli from &quot;Reelviews&quot; praised the film highly, describing the animation as &quot;top-notch&quot; and able to match Disney films in that regard. Liam Lacey of &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; gave a somewhat negative review, writing that &quot;Prince of Egypt&quot; is spectacular but that the film takes itself too seriously. MovieGuide also reviewed the film favorably, saying that &quot;The Prince of Egypt&quot; took animated films to a new level of entertainment, also commenting that the &quot;magnificent&quot; art, music, story, and realization make &quot;The Prince of Egypt&quot; &quot;one of the most entertaining masterpieces of all time&quot;.

=== Retrospective reception ===
Since its release, the film continues to receive acclaim from critics and audiences alike. When the film reached its 20th anniversary, SyFy made a retrospective review of &quot;The Prince of Egypt&quot;, calling it the greatest animated film of all time, predominantly due to its voice cast, animation, characters, cinematography, and most importantly, its musical score. Lisa Laman of &quot;Collider&quot; wrote that it &quot;stands out&quot; among the other films in DreamWorks Animation&#x27;s catalog for its dark but inspirational and uplifting tone when compared to the studio&#x27;s later titles. Laman further noted that the film is &quot;content to let these kinds of dark moments simmer. Sadness is allowed to wash over the audience rather than get undercut by abrupt jokes&quot;, and he called it the studio&#x27;s best film.

Julia Polster of &quot;The Daily Pennsylvanian&quot; wrote that the film showcases &quot;complex emotions and history in ways even children can appreciate&quot; and positively compared its handling of the portrayal of Jews under oppression to Steven Spielberg&#x27;s film &quot;Schindler&#x27;s List&quot; (1993) and the stage musicals &quot;Fiddler on the Roof&quot; and &quot;Parade&quot;. She went on to explain how the film continues to remain relevant and essential in modern times, in part due to an increase of antisemitism and Holocaust denial in the United States during the early months of 2020, saying that &quot;this lack of security is why films like &quot;The Prince of Egypt&quot; and its more adult counterparts must exist: to teach in an accessible way&quot; and that &quot;The Prince of Egypt&quot; and other films carry on the history and legacy of Judaism.

For &quot;The Film Magazine&quot;, Katie Doyle in her 2015 retrospective called the film&#x27;s portrayal of Moses&#x27;s encounter with God&#x27;s voice coming through the burning bush as &quot;a masterpiece of animation&quot; and one of the best depictions of God shown in the film, and she wrote that, for younger viewers, it is &quot;a shining example of a children&#x27;s movie that delivers mature content to children in a manner that is not too frightening but still gets the deep message across&quot;.

It has appeared on many lists as among the best animated films of all time. Jackson Lockhart of &quot;Comic Book Resources&quot; ranked it first place on his list of the top 10 non-Disney animated musical films, writing that the &quot;songs and visuals are transcendent and packed with symbolism, such as God collapsing a statue of Amun-Ra, the Egyptian God of the sun, before inflicting his plague of darkness&quot;. Hannah Shortt of &quot;MovieWeb&quot; ranked it at number 8 on her list of the &quot;Best Animated Movies From the 1990s&quot;, commenting that placing Moses and Ramases&#x27; relationship as brothers at the forefront of the film&#x27;s focus helped make the story feel new and fresh for a modern audience. Jacob Oller of &quot;Paste&quot; named it the third-best DreamWorks Animation film of all time, calling it &quot;dark, beautiful, and filled with songs as epic as its visuals&quot;. It was also voted number 40 on the &quot;Top 100 Animated Features of All Time&quot; list by the Online Film Critics Society, published in March 2003.

=== Cultural impact ===
&quot;The Prince of Egypt&quot; saw a resurgence in visibility during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, most notably when Cynthia Erivo and Shoshana Bean, with piano accompaniment by Stephen Schwartz, performed a rendition of &quot;When You Believe&quot; during the virtual Saturday Night Seder that April, in response to the shutdown of Broadway and the film&#x27;s stage musical adaptation suspending performances in the West End. The performance was well-received and their rendition was released as a single on June 30, 2020 to benefit the Jews for Racial and Economic Justice organization. Erivo would go on to perform the song with her &quot;Wicked&quot; co-star Ariana Grande at the 2024 Met Gala and by herself at the 35th National Memorial Day Concert, both in May 2024. In November 2021, the &quot;River Lullaby&quot; leitmotif became the subject of a TikTok mash-up between that and Hans Zimmer&#x27;s &quot;Gom Jabbar&quot; score cue from the film adaptation of &quot;Dune&quot;, created by Nashville singer JADA. The video went viral on the platform within its first 24 hours, garnering 2.3 million views and over 500,000 likes.

In July 2023, to celebrate the film&#x27;s 25-year anniversary, many crew members who worked on the film, including directors Brenda Chapman, Steve Hickner and Simon Wells, songwriter Stephen Schwartz, and cast members Amick Byram and Eden Riegel, reunited by participating in a 3-hour livestream on YouTube on &quot;The Tammy Tuckey Show&quot;. The event had been organized ahead of time.

=== Censorship ===
&quot;The Prince of Egypt&quot; was banned in the Maldives, Malaysia and Egypt, and all state Islam countries, on the grounds that Islamic prophets (who include Moses) are not to be visually depicted. The film was also banned in Indonesia, but was later released in video CD format.

The Supreme Council of Islamic Affairs in the Maldives stated that &quot;all prophets and messengers of God are revered in Islam, and therefore cannot be portrayed&quot;. Following this ruling, the censor board banned the film in January 1999. In the same month, the Film Censorship Board of Malaysia banned the film &quot;so as not to offend the country&#x27;s majority Muslim population&quot;. The board&#x27;s secretary said that the censor body ruled the film was &quot;insensitive for religious and moral reasons&quot;.

=== Accolades ===
=== American Film Institute recognition ===
The film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists:
* 2004: AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Songs:
** &quot;When You Believe&quot; – Nominated

== Prequel ==

In November 2000, DreamWorks Animation released &quot;&quot;, a direct-to-video prequel based on the story of Joseph from the Book of Genesis. The project began during production of &quot;The Prince of Egypt&quot;, employing some of the same animation crew and featuring director Steve Hickner as an executive producer.

== Stage musical ==

A stage musical adaptation debuted at TheatreWorks in Mountain View, California on October 14, 2017. The show had an international premiere on April 6, 2018, in Denmark at the Fredericia Teater. It made its West End debut at the Dominion Theatre on February 5, 2020, with an official opening on February 25 and was to spend a 39-week engagement through October 31. Performances were then halted on March 17, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The show reopened on July 1, 2021, and ran through January 8, 2022. The production was filmed by Universal Pictures Content Group and STEAM Motion + Sound for a future broadcast, and was released in theaters on October 19, 2023. The recorded performance was released on BroadwayHD on November 15 and was followed by a digital release on December 5.

== Notes ==
# In July 2014, the film&#x27;s distribution rights were purchased by DreamWorks Animation from Paramount Pictures and transferred to 20th Century Fox. The rights were moved to Universal Pictures in 2018 after the buyout of DreamWorks Animation by Comcast/NBCUniversal.
# During the production of &quot;The Prince of Egypt&quot;, DreamWorks had hoped that the film would be a box office success, so they had been pressuring employees to work on the film, but if they were unable to work on the film, they were then forced to work on &quot;Shrek&quot;, which was expected to flop. Despite this, &quot;Shrek&quot; was the victor in the box office, as &quot;The Prince of Egypt&quot; was only a moderate success.

<doc id="465479" wikidata="Q554454" url="?curid=465479" title="John Langdon (politician)">
<text>John Langdon Jr. (June 26, 1741September 18, 1819) was an American politician and Founding Father from New Hampshire. He served as a delegate to the Constitutional Convention, signed the United States Constitution, and was one of the first two United States senators from New Hampshire.

As a member of the Continental Congress, Langdon was an early supporter of the Revolutionary War. He later served in the United States Congress for 12 years, including as the first president pro tempore of the Senate, before becoming president and later governor of New Hampshire. He turned down a nomination for U.S. vice presidential candidate in 1812.

==Ancestry and early life==

Although information about John Langdon&#x27;s specific ancestry is not widely available, it is known that his family had roots in England. His father, John Langdon Sr., was a descendant of English settlers who had come to the American colonies. The Langdon family was part of the early wave of European settlers who arrived in New England in the 17th century, seeking new opportunities and religious freedom.

The Langdon surname is of Anglo-Saxon origin and is believed to have originated from multiple places in England. In the 17th century, the Langdon last name was particularly common in the southwestern counties of England, specifically in Cornwall and Devon. The name is derived from Old English words &quot;lang&quot; (meaning long) and &quot;dūn&quot; (meaning hill). It is a locational surname, meaning it was likely given to individuals who lived near a long hill or a similar geographical feature.

One example of a Langdon coat of arms, particularly associated with the Langdons of Cornwall and Devon, is described as follows: &quot;Argent, a chevron between three escallops sable.&quot; In heraldic terms, this description indicates a silver or white shield (argent) featuring a black chevron (chevron sable) with three black scallop shells (escallops sable) placed above and below the chevron.

Langdon&#x27;s father was a prosperous farmer and local shipbuilder whose family had emigrated to America before 1660 from Sheviock, Caradon, Cornwall. The Langdons were among the first of New England&#x27;s major seaports. Langdon attended the local grammar school run by a veteran of the 1745 Siege of Louisbourg against the French at Fortress of Louisbourg in New France. After finishing his primary education, he and his older brother, Woodbury Langdon, rejected the opportunity to join in their father&#x27;s successful agricultural livelihood and apprenticed themselves to local naval merchants.

By age 22, Langdon was captain of the cargo ship &quot;Andromache,&quot; sailing to the West Indies. Four years later he owned his first merchantman and would continue over time to acquire a small fleet of vessels engaging in the triangle trade between Portsmouth, the Caribbean, and London. His older brother was even more successful in international trade, and by 1777 both young men were among Portsmouth&#x27;s wealthiest citizens.

==American Revolution==

British control of the shipping industries limited Langdon&#x27;s business, motivating him to become a vigorous and prominent supporter of the colonial American revolutionary movement in the 1770s. He served on the New Hampshire provincial committee of correspondence and a non-importation committee about British goods and also attended various Patriot assemblies. In 1774, he participated in the seizure and confiscation of British munitions from Fort William and Mary at Portsmouth harbor.

Langdon served as a member delegate of the Second Continental Congress from 1775 to 1776, serving as a member of its Marine Committee which supervised the beginnings of the Continental Navy. Eleven years later, he was also a delegate to the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia during the summer of 1787, and subsequently one of the signatories of the U.S. Constitution. He resigned from the Continental Congress in June 1776 to become an agent for the Continental naval forces against the British and superintended the construction of several new American warships including the &quot;Raleigh&quot;, the &quot;America&quot;, and the &quot;Ranger&quot;. The next year in 1777, he equipped an expedition against the British, participating in the Battle of Bennington further west in nearby Vermont, and commanding Langdon&#x27;s Company of Light Horse Volunteers at the Battles of Saratoga and at Rhode Island.

==Political career==

In 1784, he built at Portsmouth the mansion now known as the Governor John Langdon House. Langdon was elected to two terms as president of New Hampshire, once between 1785 and 1786 and again between 1788 and 1789. He was a member of the Congress of the Confederation in 1787 and became president of the Constitutional Convention in 1787, serving as a member of the New Hampshire delegation. Langdon was elected to the U.S. Senate and served from March 4, 1789, to March 3, 1801. He was elected the first president pro tempore of the Senate on April 6, 1789, and also served as president pro tempore during the Second Congress.

During the 1787 constitutional debates in Philadelphia, Langdon spoke out against James Madison&#x27;s proposed &quot;negative&quot; on state laws simply because he felt that should the Senate be granted this power and not the House of Representatives, it would &quot;hurt the feelings&quot; of House members. Langdon was an ardent supporter of the drive to ratify the Constitution of the United States in New Hampshire. On June 21, 1788, it was ratified by New Hampshire by a vote of 57-47. He immediately wrote to George Washington to inform him that New Hampshire had become the ninth state which he described as the &quot;Key Stone in the Great Arch. Joshua Atherton, who campaigned against ratification, accepted the result and stated, &#x27;It&#x27;s adopted. Let’s try it&#x27;”.

In April 1789, Langdon served as president pro tempore of the U.S. Senate, prior to John Adams&#x27; election as vice president, and counted the votes of the electoral college in the first presidential election.

In 1798, Langdon assisted Oney Judge to evade Burwell Bassett, the nephew of George and Martha Washington, who had intended to kidnap Judge and return her to slavery with the Washingtons. That July, he was one of four senators to oppose military force in the Quasi-War.

Langdon served as a member of the New Hampshire Legislature (1801–1805), with the last two terms as speaker; he served as governor of New Hampshire from 1805 to 1812, except for a year between 1809 and 1810 when he lost to Jeremiah Smith. Prior to again winning election as governor, Langdon unsuccessfully ran for governor in 1802, 1803, and 1804, losing each time to John Taylor Gilman, whom he defeated in 1805. In 1808, his niece, Catherine Whipple Langdon, married Edmund Roberts. Langdon declined the nomination to be a candidate for vice president with James Madison in 1812.

==Death and legacy==
Langdon died in Portsmouth in 1819 and was interred at the Langdon Tomb in the North Cemetery. The town of Langdon, New Hampshire, is named after him, as is Langdon Street in Madison, Wisconsin, a city with numerous streets named after Founding Fathers.

His nephew, Henry Sherburne Langdon, married Ann Eustis and had a son named John Agustine Langdon Eustis. The latter emigrated to Argentina and died in Buenos Aires in 1876. He had many descendants, who in turn married into the high society of Argentina, such as the Saenz Valiente, Pueyrredon, Obarrio and Beccar Varela families.

<doc id="465480" wikidata="Q548206" url="?curid=465480" title="Anime music video">
<text>An anime music video (AMV) is a fan-made music video consisting of clips from one or more Japanese animated shows or movies set to an audio track, often songs or promotional trailer audio. The term is generally specific to Japanese anime, however, it can occasionally include footage from other mediums, such as American animation, live action, or video games. AMVs are not official music videos released by the musicians, they are fan compositions which synchronize edited video clips with an audio track. AMVs are most commonly posted and distributed over the Internet through AnimeMusicVideos.org, video downloads and YouTube. Anime conventions frequently run AMV contests who usually show the finalists/winner&#x27;s AMVs.

AMVs should not be confused with music videos that employ original, professionally made animation (such as numerous music videos for songs by Daft Punk and Gorillaz, or Linkin Park’s song “Breaking the Habit” which was animated by Gonzo) or with such short music video films (such as Japanese duo Chage and Aska&#x27;s song &quot;On Your Mark&quot; that was produced by the film company Studio Ghibli). AMVs should also not be confused with fan-made &quot;general animation&quot; videos using non-Japanese animated video sources like Western animation, or with the practice of vidding in Western media fandom, which evolved convergently and has a distinct history and fan culture. Parallels can be drawn between AMVs and songvids, animated fan-made videos using footage from movies, television series, or other sources.

The first anime music video was created in 1982 by 21-year-old Jim Kaposztas. Kaposztas hooked up two videocassette recorders to each other and edited the most violent scenes from &quot;Star Blazers&quot; to &quot;All You Need Is Love&quot; by the Beatles to produce a humorous effect.

==Creation==
The creation of an AMV centers on using various video editing styles to create a feeling of synchronization and unity. Some examples include: 
* Raw Editing: Using basic zooming in and out &quot;effects&quot; along with simple transitions. 
* FX (Effects) Editing: This style consists of large amounts of visual effects. This can be accomplished in programs such as Sony Vegas or Adobe After Effects.
* Timing Editing: The editor edits the clips such that the anime footage is in sync with the lyrics or beats (from the song) to create a perfect harmony. (E.g. Matching beats to gunshot scenes or making an anime character&#x27;s lips move to make it seem like the character is saying or singing those words in the AMV)
* Flow Editing: This requires the editor to use transitions and to keep the AMV flowing as opposed to have it consist of rough cuts and choppy parts.
* Animation Editing: Although it sounds similar to the term AMV editing, it is a new style where editors take a still image and animate it (making it move) (This also applies to Manga Music Videos (MMVs) which are similar to AMVs, instead they use manga as the main source of footage).
* Masking: This style requires the editor to remove the background from the anime scene they would like to add effects to. It is a painstaking and time-consuming process.
* 3D: This style consist of using a built-in camera from the video editing software. Usually involves 3D texts or 3D anime characters.
* MMV: This style is mostly using manga as opposed to anime, with animation and compositing combined.
* HMV: This subgenre uses hentai clips instead, hence the name hentai music video. Unlike other AMVs, they are posted exclusively on pornography sites, due to explicit sexual content on the source clips which prevented them from being uploaded on most video sites.
* GMV: This style consists of footage from video games, Usually using gameplay footage and/or in-game cutscenes.

==Popularity==
John Oppliger of AnimeNation has noted that fan-produced AMVs are popular mostly with Western fans but not with Japanese fans. One reason he cited was that Western fans experience a &quot;more purely&quot; visual experience in as much as most Western fans cannot understand the Japanese language, the original language of most anime, and as a result &quot;the visuals make a greater impact&quot; on the senses. The second reason he cited was that Westerners are &quot;encouraged by social pressure to grow out of cartoons and comics during the onset of adolescence&quot; whereas Japanese natives grow up with animation &quot;as a constant companion&quot;; as a result, English-speaking fans tend to utilize and reconstruct existing anime to create AMVs whereas Japanese fans &quot;are more intuitively inclined&quot; to create or expand on existing manga and anime.

== Legal issues ==
Japanese culture is generally permissive with regard to the appropriation of ideas. Works such as , unauthorized comics continuing the story of an official comic series, are actually encouraged by many anime makers. These take an original copyrighted work and expand upon the story, allowing the characters to continue on after, before, or during the original story. Most anime producers encourage this practice, as it expands their series. Some see it as a tribute while others see it from a business viewpoint that it draws in more support for the anime than it would have had otherwise. Some manga artists create their own , such as Maki Murakami&#x27;s &quot;circle&quot; Crocodile Ave (&quot;Gravitation&quot;).

In an interview with site AnimeNewsNetwork, FUNimation Entertainment copyright specialist Evan Flournay said they generally see AMVs as a sort of free advertising. &quot;The basic thinking going into fan videos is thus: if it whets the audience&#x27;s appetite, we&#x27;ll leave it alone. But if it sates the audience&#x27;s appetite, it needs to come down,&quot; he says.

In recent years there has been an increased demand, primarily on the part of the record industry, for the removal of AMVs from sites like YouTube and AnimeMusicVideos.org, with particular regard to YouTube due to its relative popularity as well as its for-profit status. Public discussions and perspectives give varying accounts of exactly how widespread these actions have become. Most notably in November 2005, the administrator of AnimeMusicVideos.org (Phade) was contacted by Wind-up Records, requesting the removal of content featuring the work of the bands Creed, Evanescence, and Seether.

While music labels and corporations generally see AMVs in negative light, often the actual musical artists in question do not hold the same views. A number of AMV editors report to having had positive contact with various artists, including Trey Gunn and Mae. Japanese electronic duo Boom Boom Satellites teamed with site AMVJ Remix Sessions to sanction an AMV competition to help promote one of their singles, going so far as to provide the source material for editors to use. The winner&#x27;s video would be featured during one of the pair&#x27;s tours. The first of this competition took place in January 2008 using the song &quot;Easy Action&quot; and the anime movie Vexille. A second competition took place later that year in November using the song &quot;Shut Up and Explode&quot; and the anime &quot;Xam&#x27;d: Lost Memories&quot;.

In his book &quot;&quot; and a subsequent talk in Google&#x27;s AtGoogleTalks Author&#x27;s Series, Creative Commons founder Lawrence Lessig specifically mentions AMVs as an example when dealing with the legality and creative nature of digital remix culture.

<doc id="465487" wikidata="Q951847" url="?curid=465487" title="Ely S. Parker">
<text>Ely Samuel Parker (1828 – August 31, 1895), born Hasanoanda (Tonawanda Seneca), later known as Donehogawa, was an engineer, U.S. Army officer, aide to General Ulysses Grant, and Commissioner of Indian Affairs, in charge of the government&#x27;s relations with Native Americans. He was bilingual, speaking both Seneca and English, and became friends with Lewis Henry Morgan, who became a student of the Iroquois in Upstate New York. Parker earned an engineering degree in college and worked on the Erie Canal, and other projects. 

He was commissioned as a lieutenant colonel during the American Civil War, when he served as adjutant and secretary to General Ulysses S. Grant. He wrote the final draft of the Confederate surrender terms at Appomattox. Later in his career, Parker rose to the rank of brevet brigadier general. 

When General Grant became president in 1869, he appointed Parker as Commissioner of Indian Affairs, the first Native American to hold that post.

==Early life and education==
Ely Parker was born in 1828 as the sixth of seven children to Elizabeth and William Parker at Indian Falls, New York, which was then part of the Tonawanda Reservation. He was named &quot;Ha-sa-no-an-da&quot; and later baptized as Samuel Parker. Both of his parents were of prominent Seneca families; while his father was a miller by trade and a Baptist minister, he was also respected as a Tonawanda Seneca chief who had fought for the United States in the War of 1812. His mother was the granddaughter of &quot;Sos-he-o-wa&quot;, the successor of the great Haudenosaunee spiritual leader Handsome Lake.

His parents strongly supported education for all their children, whose Christian names were Spencer Houghton Cone, Nicholson Henry, Levi, Caroline (Carrie), Newton, and Solomon, all with the surname of Parker. One of his elder brothers, Nicholson Parker, also became a prominent Seneca leader, as he was a powerful orator, much like the family&#x27;s famous relation Red Jacket had been. Ely had a classical education at a missionary school, and was fully bilingual, speaking the Seneca language as well as English. He also studied in college. He spent his life bridging his identities as a Seneca and a resident of the United States.

Beginning in the 1840s, when Ely was a teenager, the Parker home became a meeting place of non-Indian scholars who were interested in the Haudenosaunee, including Lewis Henry Morgan, Henry Rowe Schoolcraft, and John Wesley Powell. They all played a role in the studies that formed ethnology and anthropology as an academic discipline.

As a young man, Parker worked in a legal firm, reading law for the customary three years with an established firm in Ellicottville, New York, before applying to take the bar examination. He was not permitted to take it because as a Seneca, he was not then considered a United States citizen. All American Indians were not considered citizens until passage of the Indian Citizenship Act of 1924, but by that time, some two-thirds were American citizens due to other circumstances, including having served in the U.S. military.

Parker encountered scholar Lewis Henry Morgan through a chance meeting in a bookstore. At the time Morgan was a young lawyer involved in forming &quot;The Grand Order of the Iroquois&quot;, a fraternity of young white men from Upstate New York who romanticized their image of the American Indian and wanted to model their group after &quot;Iroquois&quot; ideals. The two bridged their cultures to become friends, and Parker invited Morgan to visit the Tonawanda Reservation in New York state. Parker became Morgan&#x27;s main source of information and an entrée to others in the Seneca and other Haudenosaunee nations. Morgan later dedicated his book &quot;League of the Iroquois&quot;, published in 1851, to Parker, noting that, &quot;the materials are the fruit of our joint researches&quot;.

The relationship proved important for both men; as Parker helped Morgan become an anthropological pioneer, Morgan helped Parker make connections in the larger white-dominated society in which he later worked and lived. With Morgan&#x27;s help, Parker gained admission to study engineering at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, New York.

==Career==
Parker worked as a civil engineer until the start of the American Civil War. Parker was later appointed by President Ulysses S. Grant to Commissioner of Indian Affairs, a position that Morgan once aspired to hold.

Parker began his career in public service by working as an interpreter and diplomat for the Seneca chiefs in their negotiations with the United States government about land and treaty rights. In 1852, he was made &quot;sachem&quot; of the Seneca and given the name &quot;Donehogawa&quot;, &quot;Keeper of the Western Door of the Long House of the Iroquois&quot;.

As an engineer, Parker contributed to upgrades and maintenance of the Erie Canal, among other projects. As a supervisor of government projects in Galena, Illinois, he befriended Ulysses S. Grant, forming a strong and collegial relationship that was useful later.

===American Civil War===
Near the start of the American Civil War, Parker tried to raise a regiment of Iroquois volunteers to fight for the Union, but was turned down by New York Governor Edwin D. Morgan. He tried to enlist in the Union Army as an engineer, but was told by Secretary of War Simon Cameron that, as an Indian, he could not join. Parker contacted his colleague and friend Ulysses S. Grant, whose forces suffered from a shortage of engineers. Parker was commissioned a captain in May 1863 and ordered to report to Brig. Gen. John Eugene Smith. Smith appointed Parker as the chief engineer of his 7th Division during the siege of Vicksburg, and later said Parker was a &quot;good engineer&quot;.

When Ulysses S. Grant became commander of the Military Division of the Mississippi, Parker became his adjutant during the Chattanooga Campaign. He was subsequently transferred with Grant as the adjutant of the U.S. Army headquarters and served Grant through the Overland Campaign and the Siege of Petersburg. At Petersburg, Parker was appointed as the military secretary to Grant, with the rank of lieutenant colonel. He wrote much of Grant&#x27;s correspondence.

Parker was present when Confederate general Robert E. Lee surrendered at Appomattox Courthouse in April 1865. He helped draft the surrender documents, which are in his handwriting. At the time of surrender, General Lee &quot;stared at me for a moment&quot;, said Parker to more than one of his friends and relatives, &quot;He extended his hand and said, &#x27;I am glad to see one real American here.&#x27; I shook his hand and said, &#x27;We are all Americans.&#x27;&quot; Parker was brevetted brigadier general of United States Volunteers on April 9, 1865, and of United States Army March 2, 1867.

==Post-Civil War==
After the Civil War, Parker was commissioned as an officer in the 2nd United States Cavalry on July 1, 1866. He again became the military secretary to Grant, with the rank of colonel, as Grant completed his appointment as commanding general of the U.S. Army. Parker was a member of the Southern Treaty Commission, which renegotiated treaties with tribes who had sided with the Confederacy, were mostly from Indian Territory. On April 26, 1869, Parker resigned from the army with the rank of brevet brigadier general of the regular army.

He was elected a Veteran Companion of the New York Commandery of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States, a military society of officers of the Union armed forces and their descendants.

=== Appointment under Grant ===
Shortly after Grant took office as president in March 1869, he appointed Parker as Commissioner of Indian Affairs. He was the first Native American to hold the office. Parker became the chief architect of President Grant&#x27;s Peace Policy in relation to the Native Americans in the West. Under his leadership, the number of military actions against Indians were reduced, and there was an effort to support tribes in their transition to living on reservations. In 1871, however, a disaffected former Commissioner of Indian Affairs named William Welsh accused Parker of corruption. Although Parker was cleared of any significant wrongdoing by the House Committee on Appropriations, his position was stripped of much of its power and he resigned in 1871.

=== Post Commissioner of Indian Affairs ===
After leaving government service, Parker invested in the stock market. At first he did well, but in the Panic of 1873 he lost the fortune he had accumulated. 

Through his social connections, Parker received an appointment for an office job in the Committee on Supplies and Repairs of the Board of Commissioners of the New York Police Department. Parker received many visits from Jacob Riis, the photographer famous for documenting the lives of slum dwellers.

==Personal life==
After the war, in 1867 Parker married a white woman, Minnie Orton Sackett (1849–1932). They had one daughter, Maud Theresa Parker (1878–1956).

==Later life, death, and reinterment==
Parker lived his last years in poverty, dying in Fairfield, Connecticut, on August 31, 1895. He was buried, but the Seneca did not believe that this Algonquian territory was appropriate for his final resting place. They requested that his widow relocate his body. On January 20, 1897, his body was exhumed and reinterred at Forest Lawn Cemetery in Buffalo, New York. He was reinterred next to his ancestor Red Jacket, a famous Seneca orator, and other notables of Western New York.

<text>The First Australian Army was a field army of the Australian Army, during World War II. The formation&#x27;s headquarters was raised in April 1942 from the existing 1st Australian Corps headquarters, assuming command of all Allied troops in Queensland. Initially, the formation was assigned a defensive role in anticipation of a possible Japanese invasion; however, this threat subsided and eventually the army was deployed to Lae, in New Guinea, in late 1944, where it co-ordinated Australian offensives around Aitape, in New Guinea, on New Britain and Bougainville, and around Madang. The formation was disbanded in February 1946, when it was redesignated as the 8th Military District.

==History==
The First Australian Army&#x27;s headquarters was formed at Toowoomba, Queensland, on 15 April 1942 when its headquarters was raised from the former Headquarters (HQ) 1st Australian Corps, which had been formed in January 1940 in Melbourne, before deploying to the Middle East with the Second Australian Imperial Force. Under the command of Lieutenant General John Lavarack, the formation subsumed the previous Northern and Eastern Commands, and was based in Queensland and New South Wales. Split into two corps – 1st and 2nd – initially the First Army had seven Australian divisions: 1st Infantry, 2nd Infantry, 3rd Infantry, 5th Infantry, 7th Infantry, 10th Infantry and 1st Motor.

HQ First Australian Army controlled the 5th Infantry Division in Townsville, Queensland, the new 1st Australian Corps (ex HQ Southern Command) defending South Queensland, and 2nd Australian Corps (ex HQ Eastern Command) defending New South Wales. When the 1st Australian Corps was sent to New Guinea in August 1942 and became known as New Guinea Force, the 2nd Australian Corps moved to Esk, Queensland, and New South Wales came under the Second Australian Army. Two US infantry divisions – the 32nd and 41st – were also assigned to the First Australian Army for periods during this time, having been moved north and transferred from the Second Australian Army earlier in the year; nevertheless, these divisions were transferred to the US I Corps from September 1942, and were increasingly divorced from the First Australian Army&#x27;s control, with this separation being formalised in February 1943 when the US Sixth Army headquarters was established in Brisbane.

During 1942 and 1943, the units under the formation&#x27;s command varied, and by August 1943, they controlled the 11th Brigade at Merauke (Dutch New Guinea), Torres Strait Force at Thursday Island, the 4th Infantry Division at Townsville, the 3rd Armoured Division at Murgon, and the 2nd Australian Corps on the Atherton Tablelands, around Barrine, in Queensland. In late 1943, the First Australian Army consisted of 90,784 troops, with a further 41,871 personnel assigned to the Queensland line of communication area within the army&#x27;s assigned boundary. These troops came under the First Army for operational purposes, but were administered separately by Land Headquarters.

Upon formation, the First Australian Army&#x27;s role had been focused on defending against a possible Japanese invasion, and assumed the main operational responsibility for this over the Second Army, which over time became focused mainly on training and lesser command roles. But as this threat subsided, a more offensive role developed for the First Army. In May 1944, HQ First Australian Army moved to Mareeba, Queensland, to prepare for a more active role as Australian troops began relieving US troops in New Guinea to free them up for redeployment to the Philippines. While the main elements of the First Australian Army had been deployed forward to Mareeba, the formation had maintained a rear headquarters at Chermside, Queensland. This headquarters administered several minor units in Brisbane until September 1944, when they came under the control of the Second Australian Army. At this time the army&#x27;s rear headquarters rejoined headquarters main at Mareeba.

In October 1944, the main element of the army&#x27;s headquarters moved under Lieutenant General Vernon Sturdee, to Lae, in the Australian territory of New Guinea, where it was tasked with undertaking operations across a broad area including Bougainville, New Britain and Aitape. Here they controlled the 2nd Australian Corps on Bougainville, the 5th Infantry Division on New Britain, the 6th Infantry Division at Aitape and the 8th Infantry Brigade at Madang. On Bougainville, New Britain and around Aitape, the Australians undertook limited offensive operations. This saw them secure the northern part of the island up to the Bonis Peninsula, and advance south on Bougainville towards the main Japanese strong hold around Buin, while on New Britain they were able to establish a line across the base of the Gazelle Peninsula, isolating Rabaul. In northern New Guinea, they advanced from Aitape and by the end of the war had secured Wewak.

Meanwhile, a rear headquarters was left behind at Mareeba, where it assumed control of all forces not assigned for operations in the upcoming Borneo Campaign, while the 1st Australian Corps was placed under direct command of Land Headquarters for the operation. The rear headquarters remained in existence until January 1945, when the 11th Division&#x27;s headquarters assumed its duties. The HQ First Australian Army was disbanded in February 1946 when it was redesignated as the 8th Military District.

<text>David Roy Akers (; born December 9, 1974) is an American former professional football player who was a kicker in the National Football League (NFL) for 16 seasons, primarily with the Philadelphia Eagles. He began his career in 1998 with the Washington Redskins, after not making the main roster of the Atlanta Falcons and Carolina Panthers. The following year, he signed with the Eagles, where he spent 12 seasons. Akers was also a member of the San Francisco 49ers and Detroit Lions before retiring in 2013.

During his career, Akers was named to six Pro Bowls and twice received first-team All-Pro honors. He also tied the then-NFL record for the longest successful field goal when he converted a 63-yard field goal, which is the third-longest in league history. Akers is an inductee of the Philadelphia Eagles Hall of Fame and a member of the Philadelphia Eagles 75th Anniversary Team, along with being named to the second-team of the NFL 2000s All-Decade Team.

==Early life==
Akers attended Tates Creek High School in Lexington, Kentucky.

==College career==
Akers attended college at the University of Louisville and played for the Louisville Cardinals football team. During his four-year college career, Akers kicked a school-record 36 field goals (with a long of 51 yards against Texas A&amp;M University), and ranks second on Louisville&#x27;s all-time scoring list, with 219 points.

==Professional career==

===Atlanta Falcons and Carolina Panthers===
Between 1997 and 1998, as an undrafted free agent, Akers spent time trying to make the team with the Atlanta Falcons and Carolina Panthers.

===Washington Redskins===
Akers was signed by the Washington Redskins in 1998 and played in one game for them, making two extra points but missing two field goal attempts of 48+ yards each. He was waived by the Redskins during the 1999 season.

===Philadelphia Eagles===
After Washington cut Akers, the Philadelphia Eagles claimed him off waivers and allocated him to NFL Europe. A solid season with the Berlin Thunder helped him earn the kicking job for the Eagles in 2000.
Akers proved to be one of the biggest special teams surprises in all of the NFL that season. He made 29 out of 33 field goals (an 87.9% success rate), and had a team-record 121 points. Akers earned the NFC Special Teams Player of the Month award in November 2000. He made the Pro Bowl for the first time in 2001 as he went 26-for-31, making a team-record seventeen consecutive field goals during the season.

Akers&#x27; best statistical season was 2002 when he connected on 30 of 34 field goals (88.2%), scored a team-record 133 points, and made another Pro Bowl. He got fewer chances in 2003, but still made 24 of 29 field goals. He made the third-longest field goal in Eagles&#x27; history on September 14, 2003, a 57-yarder against the New England Patriots at the new Lincoln Financial Field. (The only longer field goals in Eagles&#x27; history have been Jake Elliott&#x27;s 61-yard field goal in 2017 and Tony Franklin&#x27;s 59-yard field goal in 1979.) In 2004, Akers continued his consistent kicking with an 84.4% field goal percentage, and he made his third Pro Bowl.

Injuries got to Akers in 2005 when he tore the hamstring in his non-kicking leg during the opening kickoff against the Oakland Raiders on September 25, 2005. Akers left the game, but returned in the second half with a heavily taped leg to make two extra points and then kick the game-winning 28-yard field goal before collapsing in pain as his teammates mobbed him. He missed the next four games and finished the season 16 for 22.

In 2006, Akers was injury-free, but made only 18 of 23 attempts (78.3%), his second-worst season statistically.

On December 16, 2007, in a 10–6 win over the Dallas Cowboys, Akers set the Philadelphia Eagles franchise record for most points and on Thanksgiving in 2008, Akers passed 1,000 career points during a 48–20 win over the Arizona Cardinals.

On December 7, 2008, Akers kicked a 51-yard field goal at Giants Stadium, his longest of the season. In the same game he had two field goals blocked, one of which was returned for a touchdown. At the end of the 2008 regular season, Akers again set the team single-season scoring record with an NFC-best 144 points. He connected on 33 of 40 field goals (82.5 pct), his best percentage since 2004.

On January 11, 2009, Akers kicked three field goals in three attempts during a divisional playoff win over the New York Giants. The second of these set an NFL record for consecutive field goals without a miss during the postseason, previously held by one-time Eagle Gary Anderson. Akers eventually ran his streak to a record 19 consecutive postseason field goal conversions; it was snapped the very next week against the Arizona Cardinals. Akers had a total of thirty-five postseason field goal conversions during his career.

Akers was selected to the 2010 Pro Bowl, his fourth. He was also named to the NFL All-Decade Team for the 2000s. After the 2010 season, he was selected to his fifth career Pro Bowl, and named Eagles Special Teams MVP.

===San Francisco 49ers===
Akers was signed by the San Francisco 49ers to a $9 million, three-year contract on July 29, 2011. He kicked a 59-yard field goal just before halftime in a preseason game against the New Orleans Saints on August 12, 2011. On September 18, 2011, he kicked a 55-yard field goal against the Dallas Cowboys, setting a record for the longest field goal made at Candlestick Park.

Akers broke the 49ers&#x27; record for most points scored in a season in a 20–3 win over the Pittsburgh Steelers in a Monday Night Football matchup on December 19, 2011. The record was formerly held by the 49ers&#x27; Hall of Fame wide receiver, Jerry Rice. In that same game against the Seahawks, Akers broke the all-time record for field goals in a season, surpassing Neil Rackers&#x27; 40 in 2005.

On January 1, 2012, Akers broke the NFL record for most points by a kicker in a single season against the St. Louis Rams; he finished with 166 points. In this game, he also extended his NFL record for most field goals made in a single season, finishing with 44, and threw for a touchdown on a fake field goal. Akers made his sixth Pro Bowl at the end of the season.

On September 9, 2012, Akers tied the NFL record for the longest field goal by kicking a 63-yard field goal off the crossbar against the Green Bay Packers at Lambeau Field, tying the overall, and now non-altitude-assisted record. It was the first non-altitude-assisted kick of that length since 1970. The non-assisted record was originally set by Tom Dempsey in 1970 and Graham Gano tied it in 2018. The overall record was shared with Jason Elam and Sebastian Janikowski (and later beaten by Justin Tucker of the Ravens in 2021 at Detroit, which was assisted as an indoor venue) until Broncos kicker Matt Prater broke the record with a 64-yard field goal on December 8, 2013, but those took place in Denver, Colorado, where altitude assistance on field goal kicks, similar to sprint running and throwing events, is known. Likewise, Tucker&#x27;s 66-yard (and Brandon Aubrey&#x27;s 65-yard field goal in 2024) field goals took place in retractable roof stadiums with the roof closed, which is similar to situations in athletics where for years the pole vault record was set indoors, where weather conditions (wind, et al.) do not affect the wind blowing the ball during attempts.

The long field goals by Elam, Janikowski, and Prater were all made in Denver, where the ball has the ability to travel slightly farther in thinner air. Elam kicked his 63-yard field goal at Mile High Stadium, while the 63-yarder by Janikowski and the 64-yarder by Prater were at Sports Authority Field at Mile High. In track and field, the IAAF denotes any records set 1,000 metres (about 3,937 feet) or more above sea level as altitude-assisted records, and the Dempsey (Tulane Stadium) and Akers (Lambeau Field) records were set below the 1,000m threshold.

The 49ers advanced to Super Bowl XLVII following the 2012 season, marking Akers&#x27; second appearance in the game. In the game, Akers went 3 for 3 in field goal attempts, but San Francisco narrowly lost to the Baltimore Ravens by a 34–31 score.

On March 6, 2013, Akers was released after two seasons with the 49ers.

===Detroit Lions===
On April 6, 2013, Akers signed with the Detroit Lions, three days after the retirement of 21-season Lions kicker Jason Hanson.

=== Retirement ===
On October 23, 2017, during a Monday Night Football matchup against the Washington Redskins, Akers was inducted into the Philadelphia Eagles Hall of Fame for his services during his 12 seasons with the team. Prior to the game, Akers signed a ceremonial contract with the team to retire as an Eagle.

==NFL career statistics==


==Personal life==
Akers and his wife, Erika, reside in Franklin, Tennessee, with their sons Luke and Sawyer and daughter Halley. He has maintained a summer residence in Ocean City, New Jersey. Luke is a punter for the Northwestern Wildcats.

Akers is a Christian.

In 2001, the Akers family formed the David Akers Kicks for Kids Foundation, which has established programs with the Children&#x27;s Hospital of Philadelphia to benefit sick children and their families. He has also trained in martial arts jiu-jitsu and Shaolin Kempo.

On April 27, 2018, Akers was selected to announce an Eagles second-round draft pick during the 2018 NFL draft, which took place at the Cowboys&#x27; AT&amp;T Stadium. Akers made a dramatic speech complete with trash talk directed at Cowboys fans, reminiscent to what Drew Pearson did the previous year in Philadelphia. Akers announced Dallas Goedert as the 49th overall pick.

<doc id="465495" wikidata="Q3925276" url="?curid=465495" title="Public Domain Enhancement Act">
<text>The Public Domain Enhancement Act (PDEA) ( (108th Congress), (109th Congress)) was a bill in the United States Congress, first introduced in the United States House of Representatives on June 25, 2003, which, if passed, would have added a tax for copyrighted works to retain their copyright status. The purpose of the bill was to make it easier to determine who holds a copyright (by determining the identity of the person who paid the tax), and to allow copyrighted works which have been abandoned by their owners, also known as orphan works, to pass into the public domain.

==Impact==
In the bill&#x27;s latest form, the tax would have been a multiple-time affair, a sum of US$1 per work charged 50 years after the date of first publication or on December 31, 2006, whichever occurs later, and every 10 years thereafter until the end of the copyright term, only on works first published within the United States (as charging it from foreigners would violate the Berne convention except in some interpretations of the Berne three-step test). Failure to pay the Copyright Office the copyright renewal fee on or before the date the fee is due or within a grace period of 6 months thereafter would allow the work to irreversibly lapse into the public domain in the United States and other countries and areas applying the rule of the shorter term of the Berne Convention. However, if payments are made in time, the copyright may be extended to the end of the normal maximum term, currently 95 years for a work made for hire. In practice, this would resemble copyright renewal under the Copyright Act of 1909, but the bill will create a 50-year term renewable five times for 45 years.

The problem that the law attempts to solve is that the cost of locating the owner of a work is often prohibitive. For works that are still in print, this is usually not a problem, but otherwise there is typically not a clear record of whether the original creator transferred the rights, died, or had a clear successor to its rights. The PDEA solves this problem by requiring a small tax to maintain copyright on a work. For works that the copyright owner no longer cares about, the copyright will lapse, and so copies and derivatives can be made freely. The Act would also require the Copyright Office to maintain an easily searchable database, so that for works that the original publisher still wishes to maintain copyright on, potential derivative creators can find out who paid the US$1 tax and negotiate with them for permission.

==Legislative history==
This bill was first introduced in the House on June 25, 2003, by representatives Zoe Lofgren (D-CA) and John T. Doolittle (R-CA) where it went to the House Committee on the Judiciary. On September 4, 2003, it moved to the House Subcommittee on Courts, the Internet, and Intellectual Property. On May 17, 2005, it was reintroduced by Lofgren as H.R. 2408, and was once again referred to the House Judiciary Committee.

==Opposition to PDEA==

Opposition to the Public Domain Enhancement Act comes from the entertainment industry sphere, particularly the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) and its lobbyists. In his book &quot;Free Culture&quot;, Lawrence Lessig lays out the reason for the MPAA opposition to the bill:

# Congress had already &quot;firmly rejected&quot; the concept of copyright renewal in the Copyright Act of 1976, which eliminated the need for registration and renewal of copyrighted works.
# The $1 fee would harm copyright owners, particularly those with large numbers of active and potentially commercially viable works.
# The extension fee would encourage copyright restoration, a process that re-asserts copyright over a public domain work that originated outside the US and for which US copyright was not renewed.
# The benefits would fail to justify the administrative costs needed to set up and fund a registration system.
# The MPAA expressed concern about the effects of a story that underlies a currently copyrighted film moving into the public domain (although this would not invalidate the copyright of the film).
# The MPAA argues that current law already allows for the creation of derivative works via licensing and release of rights.

Proponents such as Lessig have suggested that copyright holders may be motivated to oppose the PDEA by a competitive threat: a huge wave of abandoned works would spill into the public domain which could form the basis of new derived works that would compete commercially with established copyrighted works.

<doc id="465496" wikidata="Q88926185" url="?curid=465496" title="Deinococcota">
<text>Deinococcota (synonym, Deinococcus-Thermus) is a phylum of bacteria with a single class, Deinococci, that are highly resistant to environmental hazards, also known as extremophiles.
These bacteria have thick cell walls that give them gram-positive stains, but they include a second membrane and so are closer in structure to those of gram-negative bacteria.

==Taxonomy==
The phylum &quot;Deinococcota&quot; consists of a single class (&quot;Deinococci&quot;) and two orders:
* The &quot;Deinococcales&quot; include two families (&quot;Deinococcaceae&quot; and&quot; Trueperaceae&quot;), with three genera, &quot;Deinococcus&quot;, &quot;Deinobacterium&quot; and &quot;Truepera&quot;. &quot;Truepera radiovictrix&quot; is the earliest diverging member of the order. Within the order, &quot;Deinococcus&quot; forms a distinct monophyletic cluster with respect to &quot;Deinobacterium&quot; and &quot;Truepera species&quot;. The genus includes several species that are resistant to radiation; they have become famous for their ability to eat nuclear waste and other toxic materials, survive in the vacuum of space and survive extremes of heat and cold.
* The &quot;Thermales&quot; include several genera resistant to heat (&quot;Marinithermus&quot;, &quot;Meiothermus&quot;, &quot;Oceanithermus&quot;, &quot;Thermus&quot;, &quot;Vulcanithermus&quot;, &quot;Rhabdothermus&quot;) placed within a single family, &quot;Thermaceae&quot;. Phylogenetic analyses demonstrate that within the &quot;Thermales&quot;, &quot;Meiothermus&quot; and &quot;Thermus&quot; species form a monophyletic cluster, with respect to &quot;Marinithermus&quot;, &quot;Oceanithermus&quot;, &quot;Vulcanithermus&quot; and &quot;Rhabdothermus&quot; that branch as outgroups within the order. This suggests that &quot;Meiothermus&quot; and &quot;Thermus&quot; species are more closely related to one another relative to other genera within the order. &quot;Thermus aquaticus&quot; was important in the development of the polymerase chain reaction where repeated cycles of heating DNA to near boiling make it advantageous to use a thermo-stable DNA polymerase enzyme.

Though these two groups evolved from a common ancestor, the two mechanisms of resistance appear to be largely independent.

==Molecular signatures==
Molecular signatures in the form of conserved signature indels (CSIs) and proteins (CSPs) have been found that are uniquely shared by all members belonging to the &quot;Deinococcota&quot; phylum. These CSIs and CSPs are distinguishing characteristics that delineate the unique phylum from all other bacterial organisms, and their exclusive distribution is parallel with the observed differences in physiology. CSIs and CSPs have also been found that support order and family-level taxonomic rankings within the phylum. Some of the CSIs found to support order level distinctions are thought to play a role in the respective extremophilic characteristics. The CSIs found in DNA-directed RNA polymerase subunit beta and DNA topoisomerase I in &quot;Thermales&quot; species may be involved in thermophilicity, while those found in Excinuclease ABC, DNA gyrase, and DNA repair protein RadA in &quot;Deinococcales&quot; species may be associated with radioresistance. Two CSPs that were found uniquely for all members belonging to the &quot;Deinococcus&quot; genus are well characterized and are thought to play a role in their characteristic radioresistant phenotype. These CSPs include the DNA damage repair protein PprA the single-stranded DNA-binding protein DdrB.

Additionally, some genera within this group, including &quot;Deinococcus&quot;, &quot;Thermus&quot;, and &quot;Meiothermus&quot;, also have molecular signatures that demarcate them as individual genera, inclusive of their respective species, providing a means to distinguish them from the rest of the group and all other bacteria. CSIs have also been found specific for &quot;Truepera radiovictrix&quot; .

<text>A cricket bat is a specialised piece of equipment used by batters in the sport of cricket to hit the ball, typically consisting of a cane handle attached to a flat-fronted willow-wood blade. It may also be used by a batter who is making batter&#x27;s ground to avoid a run out, by holding the bat and touching the ground with it. The length of the bat may be no more than 38 inches (96.5 cm) and the width no more than 4.25 inches (10.8 cm). Its use is first mentioned in 1624. Since 1979, a law change has dictated that cricket bats can only be made from wood.

==Construction==

The &quot;blade&quot; of a cricket bat is a wooden block that is generally flat on the striking face and with a ridge on the reverse (back) which concentrates wood in the middle where the ball is generally hit. The bat is traditionally made from willow wood, specifically from a variety of white willow called cricket bat willow (&quot;Salix alba&quot; var. &quot;caerulea&quot;), treated with raw (unboiled) linseed oil, which has a protective function. This variety of willow is used as it is very tough and shock-resistant, not being significantly dented nor splintering on the impact of a cricket ball at high speed, while also being light in weight. The face of the bat is often covered with a protective film by the user. In 1900 Percy Stuart Surridge developed a reinforced toe.

The blade is connected to a long cylindrical cane &quot;handle&quot;, similar to that of a mid-20th-century tennis racquet, using a &quot;splice&quot;. The handle is usually covered with a rubber grip. Bats incorporate a wooden spring design where the handle meets the blade. The current design of a cane handle spliced into a willow blade through a &quot;tapered&quot; splice was the invention in the 1880s of Charles Richardson, a pupil of Brunel and the first Chief Engineer of the Severn Railway Tunnel. Spliced handles had been used before this but tended to break at the corner of the join. The taper provides a more gradual transfer of load from the bat&#x27;s blade to the handle and avoids this problem.

The edges of the blade closest to the handle are known as the &quot;shoulders&quot; of the bat, and the bottom of the blade is known as the &quot;toe&quot; of the bat.

Bats were not always this shape. Before the 18th century, bats tended to be shaped similarly to modern hockey sticks. This may well have been a legacy of the game&#x27;s reputed origins. Although the first forms of cricket are obscure, it may be that the game was first played using shepherd&#x27;s crooks.
The bat generally recognised as the oldest bat still in existence is dated 1729 and is on display in the Sandham Room at The Oval in London.

==Maintenance==
When first purchased, most bats are not ready for immediate use and require knocking-in to allow the soft fibres to strike a hard new cricket ball without causing damage to the bat, and allowing full power to be transferred to the shot. Knocking-in involves striking the surface with an old cricket ball or a special mallet. This compacts the soft fibres within the bat and reduces the risk of the bat snapping. The bat may also need raw linseed oil, which fills in the gaps between the fibres.

Raw linseed oil is used, rather than boiled linseed oil, as the raw form is also a drying oil but very slow &quot;drying&quot;, and so the surface remains tacky. Applied regularly, this has a protective effect on the wood and makes it less sensitive to humidity changes in the atmosphere, which could cause warping or splitting. Another important factor is that it increases the surface friction of the ball to the bat surface, giving better control of the shot. A worn surface can be noticed by the player, indicating that re-oiling is needed.

==Sizes of bats==
Law 5 of the Laws of Cricket state that the length of the bat may be no more than 38  in (965  mm), the width no more than 4.25  in (108  mm), the overall depth no more than 2.64  in (67  mm) and edge no more than 1.56  in (40  mm). Appendix B of the Laws of Cricket set out more precise specifications. This rule was introduced following the Monster Bat Incident 1771.

The 2017 update to the Laws saw no changes to the maximum length of the bat, which is still 38  inches/96.52  cm, but a new specification stated that the edge of the bat cannot be more than 1.56  inches / 4  cm while the depth cannot be more than 2.64  inches / 6.7  cm. The umpires are now given a bat gauge so they can check the legality of the bat at any time.

Bats are available in a range of sizes, with some manufacturers offering unique variations. Commonly found are children&#x27;s sizes 0 to 6, youth size Harrow and adult sizes. SH (Short Handle) is the most common adult size, whilst long handle and long blade options are also available. Children&#x27;s sizes increase in length and width as the size increase. Although most adult bats will be the maximum width permitted (4.25  inches), no generally available cricket bat is a maximum length of 38  very few exceed 35  inches.

== Variations ==
Various companies have over the years tried new shapes that come within the laws of the game to make a name for themselves and to improve sales. In the 1960s the first shoulderless bats appeared from Slazenger. This allowed more of the weight to be redistributed to the &quot;sweet spot&quot; of the blade providing more power to each stroke, whilst still having good balance and light &quot;pick up&quot;. This style of the bat was made famous by Lance Cairns&#x27;s six sixes in a match played in 1983.

The 1970s saw double-sided bats from Warsop Stebbing. With the advent of Twenty20 cricket, double-sided bats are experiencing renewed interest.

In 1974 the first GN100 Scoop was released; this was the first bat to turn to shape on its head by removing the wood from the centre of the rear of the bat. By removing this wood, the bat became lighter, its sweet spot grew and its pick-up improved. Even though there is less material, strong strokes are still possible if well-timed. It allows weaker players to play many strokes they would otherwise omit from their repertoire. This bat quickly became a big seller and various scooped bats such as the GN500, Dynadrive and Viper have been released by Gray-Nicolls ever since, including a re-release of the Scoop itself for the 2012 English season. The removal of wood from the rear has been copied by many other companies without much critical acclaim.

In 1979 Australian cricketer Dennis Lillee briefly used a ComBat aluminium bat. After some discussion with the umpires, and after complaints by the English team that it was damaging the ball, which was later proved untrue, he was urged by the Australian captain Greg Chappell to revert to a wooden bat as Chappell believed it was not delivering the same amount of power to the ball as a regulation wooden bat. The rules of cricket were shortly thereafter amended, stating that the blade of a bat must be made entirely of wood.

In the 1980s Stuart Surridge &amp; Co developed the Turbo. Designed by John Surridge, the bat was formed from two pieces of willow which reduced the flex and increased the transfer of power. The bat was used by Graham Gooch for his record 333 against India in 1990.

In 2005 Kookaburra released a new type of bat that had a carbon fibre-reinforced polymer support down the spine of the bat. It was put on the bat to provide more support to the spine and blade of the bat, thus prolonging the life of the bat. The first player to use this new bat in international cricket was Australian Ricky Ponting. Kookaburra withdrew it after advice was received by the ICC from MCC that it was illegal under Law 6.

In 2005 Newbery created a carbon fibre handle, the C6 and C6+, which weighed 3 ounces/85 grams less than a standard laminated cane and rubber handle. It was used by Newbery and Puma for three years before the concept was copied by Gray Nicolls with a hollow plastic tube. However, this provoked the MCC to change the law on materials in handles amid fears that the new technology would lead to an increase in the distance the ball was hit. Appendix B.2.3. in the Laws of Cricket concerns - Materials in handle and states that &quot;As a proportion of the total volume of the handle, materials other than cane, wood or twine are restricted to one-tenth&quot;.

In late 2008, SAFBats created a cricket bat with an offset edge. The edge offsetting allowed for an extended middle, better swing weight and increased performance without compromising the cricket bat&#x27;s balance. The production models were available in 2009, and the bat won awards in 2010 and 2012.

===Twenty20 bats===
In 2004, Newbery created the Uzi, with a truncated blade and elongated handle for the new Twenty20 format of the game. This change allowed more wood to be placed in the middle, as more attacking shots are played in the shorter version of the game. In 2009, an extreme version of the Newbery Uzi shape named the Mi3 was launched by Mongoose. The design is unusual in that the blade is 33% shorter than a conventional bat and the handle is 43% longer. Launched with a fanfare of publicity, it proclaimed the idea of not defending the ball in the T20 format and purely playing attacking shots.

On 11 March 2010, Mongoose launched its range in India with the announcement of Matthew Hayden as the brand ambassador. Stuart Law, the former Australian Test player, called it &quot;a half-brick on a stick&quot;. The bat was used by Hayden in the 2010 version of the IPL. Gareth Andrew, the Worcestershire all-rounder, scored his maiden 100 with an MMi3 in professional cricket when he hit 100 off 58 balls at the Oval in 2010 against Surrey.

In 2008, Lekka Cricket launched a T20 format bat, the Big Hitter. Black Cat Cricket then launched a T20 format bat, the Joker, in 2009. These worked on a similar principle to other T20 bats with the blade length reduced by one inch and an inch longer handle, but uniquely reduced the width of the bat to 4 inches in an adult bat.

==Manufacturing==

Modern bats are usually hand-made in the Indian sub-continent (India or Pakistan) due to the low cost of labour. However a few specialists in England, Australia, and New Zealand still make bats, mostly with use of a CNC lathe.

===Cricket bat industry of India===
Traditional Indian cricket bats are made in the regions of Jammu and Kashmir, Punjab, Haryana, Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan. In Kashmir they are made out of willow found in northern India. Some bats made in Kashmir are of international standards and are/were used by national players in India Sunil Gavaskar, Virender Sehwag and Yuvraj Singh.

==== Kashmir willow bats====


The willow used in making bats in Kashmir was brought in by the British, who ruled India, during the 1820s. The industry combines traditional tools with modern technology. Some of the districts where these bats are made in Kashmir are Anantnag, Baramula, and Pahalgam.

The species is identical (&quot;Salix alba&quot; var. &quot;caerulea&quot;) to English willow. Kashmir willow bats play well and no evidence has been presented that the wood or finished product has different properties or plays any differently. However, Kashmir willow bats sell for significantly lower prices than English willow, on the belief that the English willow bats are superior. Kashmir willow bats are widespread in social and amateur competitions, although English willow is seen as a more &quot;serious&quot; cricketer&#x27;s bat.

Much of the English Willow cricket bat market consists of bats that are made in India from imported English willow blanks. It would be virtually impossible to detect &quot;counterfeit&quot; English willow bats made from Kashmir willow. The marketing of English willow bats is, therefore, a trust exercise between the buyer and the brand, that the brand has not inflated their supply of &quot;English willow&quot; bats by sourcing blanks from India as well as England. This risk of substitution is a major hurdle for small brands looking to get bats manufactured in India. Resources are needed to ensure the integrity and custody of the English willow at all stages of production.

English willow bats with minor visual defects such as grains that are not perfectly straight, or discolourations, are also cheaper. Former England captain Geoffrey Boycott has stated that such bats will play just as well as better-looking ones and that players ought to buy the cheaper ones to get the same performance at a better price. It is unlikely that any difference in performance can be noted by most players from imperfections unless they are severe. Provided the willow has been handled and prepared competently after felling and during the bat&#x27;s creation, the much more important factor is the pickup (or weight distribution) of the bat, and its suitability to the player&#x27;s style. Different shaping techniques create a higher or lower centre of balance, and different &quot;sweet spot&quot; sizes and locations.

One issue presented as the case against Kashmir willow is the warmer growing region. The timber is said to be firmer, with less spring. However, this is a common issue for English willow bats, too. Due to the shortage of stock and demand for English willow, many small plantations on private property have been established in ideal conditions, with trees maturing as young as 10 to 12 years. This has meant a much wider grain in the wood, sometimes leading to bats with as few as 6 or even 4 grains. Bats with 8 or fewer grains are held to be harder and take longer to play well, but also to last longer. Bats with 16 or more grains are held to be softer and more playable immediately but with a reduced lifespan. 8 to 12 grains is commonly the desirable range.

Australia is another country growing &quot;Salix alba&quot; var. &quot;caerulea&quot; for cricket bats, with the entire Australian stock descended from staves sent to Australia in the 1930s from the then-England captain to his Australian counterpart. Australia grew its willow for decades until Slazenger bought the company which owned most of the plantations. Slazenger&#x27;s only interest was in apparel and the plantations were mostly sold and destroyed. In the 1990s a project was launched to again commercially grow cricket bat willow. There are now plantations in Victoria and New South Wales, but not Queensland, where all forms of willow cultivation are banned.

== Modern alternatives to willow ==
With the English willow (&quot;Salix alba&quot; var. &quot;caerulea&quot;) trees diminishing in numbers across England, researchers have tried to invent modern alternatives to cricket bats made of wood from the willow tree. According to a study published in &quot;The Journal of Sports Engineering and Technology&quot; by Dr Darshil Shah and Ben TInkler-Davies of the University of Cambridge, cricket bats made of wood from the bamboo plant provide higher strength than a traditional willow bat and hence, can be thinner and lighter than a willow bat, providing strength similar to a willow bat. The bamboo bat the researchers used was a specially made prototype laminated bat made by sticking layers of bamboo wood together. The sweet spot on the bamboo bat performed 19% better than that on a willow bat.

Alternatives to willow, such as bamboo can further drive cricket&#x27;s global expansion in regions where the willow tree does not grow, such as China and South-East Asia, where bamboo thrives. This would make cricket bats made of bamboo substantially cheaper than traditional willow bats and thus make the sport more accessible.

The Marylebone Cricket Club issued a statement saying that a bat made from bamboo would be illegal under the current set of laws, as Law 5.3.2 of the Laws of Cricket states that in a cricket bat, &quot;The blade shall consist solely of wood...&quot; Since bamboo is grass, this Law would need to be changed to allow bamboo bats. The statement further read that the issue of bamboo bats and other alternatives to willow would be discussed in the next Laws sub-committee meeting.

==Giant bats==
Several organisations have made giant cricket bats and claimed them as the largest bat in the world. According to the &quot;Laws of Cricket&quot;, a bat can have a maximum width of 4.25 inches (108  mm), so these bats cannot be used in an official game. , &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; state that the largest bat is long and was made by Classic Mall Development Company in Chennai, India.

Other giant bats include:
* A synthetic cricket bat high and wide is installed at Indira Gandhi Stadium in Vijayawada, India.
* LEMU Soft Drinks in Bangladesh created a long and wide bat to wish the Bangladesh cricket team good luck in the 2007 Cricket World Cup.
* LG Electronics presented a long, wide, deep bat to the South Africa national cricket team at their final warmup game prior to the 2003 Cricket World Cup. LG&#x27;s press release shows this bat is the largest ever constructed. 
* The Pasban Giant Cricket Bat was unveiled at Defense Stadium, Karachi, Pakistan in the lead up to the 1996 Cricket World Cup. The bat is in length.

<text>Geogaddi is the second studio album by Scottish electronic music duo Boards of Canada, released on 18 February 2002 by Warp Records. It was recorded between 1999 and 2001 at Hexagon Sun, their Pentland Hills studio. The album was intended to be—and has been described as—darker in tone than their debut studio album &quot;Music Has the Right to Children&quot;, released in 1998.

&quot;Geogaddi&quot; received critical acclaim upon release, in addition to being acclaimed by several publications as one of the year&#x27;s best albums. It was listed by music website &quot;Pitchfork&quot; as one of the best intelligent dance music albums of all time.

==Background and composition ==
&quot;Geogaddi&quot; is a psychedelic electronic album that has been categorized as IDM, downtempo, and hauntology, radically departing from the calmer and more subdued style of the duo&#x27;s previous album, &quot;Music Has the Right to Children&quot;. Compared with their previous releases, Boards of Canada aimed to record a project &quot;with more facets, more detail and a kind of concentrated recipe of chaotic little melodies&quot;, as well as &quot;more fuzzy and organic&quot;. The duo recorded over 90 tracks for the project from 1999 to 2001 at Hexagon Sun, their Pentland Hills studio, ultimately choosing 22 based on how well they fit the intended atmosphere of the album. Michael Sandison, half of the duo, stated that the album features acoustic instrumentation that was significantly manipulated and processed, inspired by the traditional folk style of the British group the Incredible String Band and the 1973 film &quot;The Wicker Man&quot;.

Sandison described the album as &quot;a record for some sort of trial-by-fire, a claustrophobic, twisting journey that takes you into some pretty dark experiences before you reach the open air again.&quot; The September 11 attacks drastically influenced the tone of the album during its production in 2001, with the duo &quot;glued to the TV for the whole day&quot; and Sandison saying that they had subsequently been pushed &quot;into making a darker record&quot;. Mark Richardson of &quot;Pitchfork&quot; wrote that &quot;the atmosphere on this album is a shade darker than on previous releases, and comparatively tense with a noticeable thread of paranoia.&quot; The album has been noted for featuring esoteric references, samples and subliminal messages, including references to numerology, Wicca and the Branch Davidians. Boards of Canada have claimed that the album&#x27;s title is made up of several words with a specific meaning, but left it up to the listener to interpret it.

== Release ==

&quot;Geogaddi&quot; was first released by Vivid in Japan on 8 February 2002 and by Warp Records on 18 February 2002 in Europe. The album has been released on compact disc, vinyl, digital download and as a limited edition compact disc.

==Reception==

&quot;Geogaddi&quot; received critical acclaim upon release. It currently holds a score of 84 out of 100 from review aggregate site Metacritic based on 21 critics&#x27; reviews, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;. John Bush of &quot;AllMusic&quot; drew comparisons between the album and &quot;Music Has the Right to Children&quot;, including both albums&#x27; cover art. He also praised the use of samples, as he felt that it fit the tone of the album. Critics at &quot;Q&quot; compared &quot;Geogaddi&quot; to the album &quot;Drukqs&quot; by Aphex Twin, saying that it was &quot;satisfying in every way that Aphex Twin&#x27;s &quot;Drukqs&quot; wasn&#x27;t&quot;. 

Pat Blashill of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; gave the album 3 stars out of 5, calling it &quot;marvelously vague&quot;. A later review of the album on &quot;the Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot; gave it 2 stars out of 5, writing, &quot;the contrast of evil undertones and electronic lullabies simply wasn&#x27;t as compelling.&quot; Kitty Empire of &quot;NME&quot; named it &quot;the electronic album of the year.&quot; Mark Richardson of &quot;Pitchfork&quot; wrote: &quot;While some will complain about Boards of Canada&#x27;s failure to cover new territory, [...] the rest of us will delight in what we see as a very accomplished album packed with great music.&quot;

&quot;Geogaddi&quot; was ranked on year-end lists of the best albums of 2002 by numerous publications, such as &quot;Mojo&quot;, &quot;NME&quot;, &quot;Uncut&quot; and &quot;The Wire&quot;. In 2017, &quot;Pitchfork&quot; placed &quot;Geogaddi&quot; at number five on its list of &quot;The 50 Best IDM Albums of All Time&quot;. It peaked at number 3 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top Dance/Electronic Albums chart.

<text>VGM (Video Game Music) is an audio file format for multiple video game platforms, such as Master System, Game Gear, Mega Drive/Genesis, MSX, Neo Geo, IBM compatibles (Adlib/SoundBlaster), and has expanded to a variety of arcade system boards since its release.

The standard filename extension is &quot;.vgm&quot;, but files can also be Gzip compressed into &quot;.vgz&quot; files. Technically &quot;.vgz&quot; files should be named &quot;.vgm.gz&quot;, but because some operating systems&#x27; file managers cannot handle file name suffixes that themselves contain a period (e.g. Microsoft Windows), &quot;.vgz&quot; is instead used in order to launch a VGM player and not a file archiver program such as WinZip or WinRAR.

The VGM format is different from formats like NSF or SID, which contain the game&#x27;s music code. Instead, the instructions sent to the sound chip are logged.

<doc id="465511" wikidata="Q609097" url="?curid=465511" title="Great Sand Dunes National Park and Preserve">
<text>Great Sand Dunes National Park and Preserve is a national park of the United States that conserves an area of large sand dunes on the eastern edge of the San Luis Valley, and an adjacent national preserve in the Sangre de Cristo Range, in south-central Colorado. The park was originally designated Great Sand Dunes National Monument on March 17, 1932, by President Herbert Hoover. The original boundaries protected an area of . A boundary change and redesignation as a national park and preserve was authorized on November 22, 2000, and then established on September 24, 2004. The park encompasses while the preserve protects an additional for a total of . The recreational visitor total was 527,546 in 2019.

The park contains the tallest sand dunes in North America, up to tall. The dunes cover an area of about and are estimated to contain over of sand. Sediments from the surrounding mountains filled the valley over geologic time periods. After lakes within the valley receded, exposed sand was blown by the predominant southwest winds toward the Sangre de Cristos, eventually forming the dune field over an estimated tens of thousands of years. The four primary components of the Great Sand Dunes system are the mountain watershed, the dune field, the sand sheet, and the sabkha. Ecosystems within the mountain watershed include alpine tundra, subalpine forests, montane woodlands, and riparian zones.

Evidence of human habitation in the San Luis Valley dates back about 11,000 years. The first historic peoples to inhabit the area were the Southern Ute Tribe; Apaches and Navajo also have cultural connections in the area. In the late 17th century, Diego de Vargas, a Spanish governor of Santa Fe de Nuevo México, became the first European on record to enter the San Luis Valley. Juan Bautista de Anza, Zebulon Pike, John C. Frémont, and John Gunnison all traveled through and explored parts of the region in the 18th and 19th centuries. The explorers were soon followed by settlers who ranched, farmed, and mined in the valley starting in the late 19th century. The park was first established as a national monument in 1932 to protect it from gold mining and the potential of a concrete manufacturing business.

Visitors must walk across the wide and shallow Creek to reach the dunes in spring and summer. The creek typically has a peak flow from late May to early June. From July to April, it is usually no more than a few inches deep, if there is any water at all. Hiking is permitted throughout the dunes with the warning that the sand surface temperature may reach in summer. Sandboarding and sandsledding are popular activities, both done on specially designed equipment that can be rented just outside the park entrance or in Alamosa. Visitors with street-legal four-wheel drive vehicles may continue past the end of the park&#x27;s main road to Medano Pass on of unpaved road, crossing the stream bed of Medano Creek nine times and traversing of deep sand. Hunting is permitted in the preserve in the autumn, but prohibited within national park boundaries at all times. The preserve encompasses nearly all of the mountainous areas north and east of the dune field, up to the ridgeline of the Sangre de Cristos.

==History==
===Native people===
The oldest evidence of humans in the area dates back about 11,000 years. Some of the first people to enter the San Luis Valley and the Great Sand Dunes area were nomadic hunter-gatherers whose connection to the area centered around the herds of mammoths and prehistoric bison. They were Stone Age people who hunted with large stone spears or dart points now identified as Clovis and Folsom points. These people only stayed when hunting and plant gathering was good, and avoided the region during times of drought and scarcity.

Modern American Indian tribes were familiar with the area when Spaniards first arrived in the 17th century. The traditional Ute phrase for the Great Sand Dunes is &quot;Saa waap maa nache&quot; (sand that moves). Jicarilla Apaches settled in northern New Mexico and called the dunes &quot;Sei-anyedi&quot; (it goes up and down). Blanca Peak, just southeast of the dunes, is one of the four sacred mountains of the Navajo, who call it &quot;Sisnaajini&quot; (White Shell Mountain). These various tribes collected the inner layers of bark from ponderosa pine trees for use as food and medicine. The people from the Tewa/Tiwa-speaking pueblos along the Rio Grande remember a traditional site of great importance located in the valley near the dunes: the lake through which their people emerged into the present world. They call the lake &quot;Sip&#x27;ophe&quot; (Sandy Place Lake), which is thought to be the springs or lakes immediately west of the dune field.

===Settler exploration===
In 1694, Don Diego de Vargas became the first European known to have entered the San Luis Valley, although herders and hunters from the Spanish colonies in present-day northern New Mexico probably entered the valley as early as 1598. De Vargas and his men hunted a herd of 500 bison in the southern part of the valley before returning to Santa Fe. In 1776, Juan Bautista de Anza and an entourage of men and livestock probably passed near the dunes as they returned from a punitive raid against a group of Comanches. At this time, the valley was a travel route between the High Plains and Santa Fe for Comanches, Utes, and Spanish soldiers. The dunes were likely a visible landmark for travelers along the trail.

The first known writings about Great Sand Dunes appear in Zebulon Pike&#x27;s journals of 1807. As Lewis and Clark&#x27;s expedition was returning east, U.S. Army Lt. Pike was commissioned to explore as far west as the Arkansas and Red Rivers. By the end of November 1806, Pike and his men had reached the site of today&#x27;s Pueblo, Colorado. Still pushing southwest, and confused about the location of the Arkansas River, Pike crossed the Sangre de Cristos just above the Great Sand Dunes.


In 1848, John C. Frémont was hired to find a railroad route from St. Louis to California. He crossed the Sangre de Cristos into the San Luis Valley in winter, courting disaster but proving that a winter crossing of this range was possible. He was followed in 1853 by Captain John Gunnison of the Corps of Topographical Engineers. Gunnison&#x27;s party crossed the dune field on horseback.

===19th &amp; 20th century settlement===
In the years that followed, the Rockies were gradually explored, treaties were signed and broken with resident tribes, and people with widely differing goals entered the San Luis Valley from the United States and Mexico. In 1852, Fort Massachusetts was built and then relocated to Fort Garland, about southeast of the Great Sand Dunes, to safeguard travel for settlers following the explorers into the valley. Although many settlers arrived via the trails from Santa Fe or La Veta Pass, several routes over the Sangre de Cristos into the valley were well-known to American Indians and increasingly used by settlers in the late 1800s. Medano Pass, also known as Sand Hill Pass, and Mosca Pass, also called Robidoux&#x27;s Pass, offered more direct routes from the growing front range cities and dropped into the valley just east of the Great Sand Dunes. Trails were improved into wagon routes and eventually into rough roads. The Mosca Pass Toll Road was developed in the 1870s and stages and the mail route used it regularly until about 1911, when the western portion was damaged in a flash flood. Partially rebuilt at times in the 1930s through the 1950s, the road was repeatedly closed due to flood damage and is now a hiking trail.
The Herard family—after whom Mount Herard is named—established a ranch and homestead along Medano Creek in 1875, using the old Medano Pass Road to travel to and from their home. The modern unpaved road follows the old route and is open only to four-wheel drive, and high-clearance vehicles as it passes through deep sand, rises to Medano Pass, and continues east into the Wet Mountain Valley. The Herards grazed and bred cattle in the mountain meadows, raised horses, and established a trout hatchery in the stream. Other families homesteaded near the dunes as well, including the Teofilo Trujillo family whose sheep and cattle ranch in the valley later became part of the Medano–Zapata Ranch, owned by the Nature Conservancy since 1999. The Trujillo&#x27;s extant homestead and the ruins of a destroyed one were declared a National Historic Landmark in 2004. Frank and Virginia Wellington built a cabin and hand-dug the irrigation ditch that parallels Wellington Ditch Trail located south of the park campground.

Gold and silver rushes occurred around the Rockies after 1853, bringing miners by the thousands into the state and stimulating mining businesses that are still in operation. Numerous small strikes occurred in the mountains around the San Luis Valley. People had frequently speculated that gold might be present in the Great Sand Dunes, and local newspapers ran articles in the 1920s estimating its worth at anywhere from 17 cents/ton to $3/ton (equivalent to $/ton to $/ton today). Active placer mining operations sprang up along Medano Creek, and in 1932 the Volcanic Mining Company established a gold mill designed to recover gold from the sand. Although minute quantities of gold were recovered, the technique was too labor-intensive, the stream too seasonal, and the pay-out too small to support any business for long.

===Preservation===
The idea that the dunes could be destroyed by gold mining or concrete manufacturing alarmed residents of Alamosa and Monte Vista. By the 1920s, the dunes had become a source of pride for local people, and a potential source of tourist dollars for local businesses. Members of the P.E.O. Sisterhood sponsored a bill to Congress asking for national monument status for Great Sand Dunes. Widely supported by local people, the bill was signed into law in 1932 by President Herbert Hoover. Similar support in the late 1990s resulted in the monument&#x27;s expansion into a national park and preserve in 2000–2004.

==Geology==

The park contains the tallest and widest sand dunes in North America, rising to a maximum height of from the floor of the San Luis Valley on the western base of the Sangre de Cristo Range. The dunes cover an area of about and are estimated to contain over of sand.

The creation of the San Luis Valley began when the Sangre de Cristo Range was uplifted in the rotation of a large tectonic plate. The San Juan Mountains to the west of the valley were created through extended and dramatic volcanic activity. The San Luis Valley encompasses the area between the two mountain ranges and is roughly the size of the state of Connecticut. Sediments from both mountain ranges filled the deep chasm of the valley, along with huge amounts of water from melting glaciers and rain. The presence of larger rocks along Medano Creek at the base of the dunes, elsewhere on the valley floor, and in buried deposits indicates that some of the sediment has been washed down in torrential flash floods.

In 2002, geologists discovered lakebed deposits on hills in the southern part of the valley, confirming theories of a huge lake that once covered much of the San Luis Valley floor. The body of water was named Lake Alamosa after the largest town in the valley. Lake Alamosa suddenly receded after it broke through volcanic deposits in the southern end of the valley. The water then drained through the Rio Grande, likely forming the steep Rio Grande Gorge near Taos, New Mexico. Smaller lakes still covered the valley floor, including two broad lakes on the northeastern side of the valley. Large amounts of sediment from the volcanic San Juan Mountains continued to wash down into these lakes, along with some sand from the Sangre de Cristo Range. Climate change later significantly reduced these lakes, leaving behind the sand sheet. Remnants of these lakes still exist in the form of sabkha wetlands.
Sand that was left behind after the lakes receded blew with the predominant southwest winds toward a low curve in the Sangre de Cristo Range. The wind funnels toward three mountain passes—Mosca, Medano, and Music Passes—and the sand accumulates in this natural pocket. The winds blow from the valley floor toward the mountains, but during storms, the winds blow back toward the valley. These opposing wind directions cause the dunes to grow vertically. Two mountain streams—Medano and Sand Creeks—also capture sand from the mountainside of the dune field and carry it around the dunes and back to the valley floor. The creeks then disappear into the sand sheet, and the sand blows back into the dune field. Barchan and transverse dunes form near these creeks. The combination of opposing winds, a huge supply of sand from the valley floor, and the sand-recycling action of the creeks are all part of the reason that these are the tallest dunes in North America.

Sufficient vegetation has grown on the valley floor and there is little sand blowing into the main dune field from the valley; however, small parabolic dunes continue to originate in the sand sheet and migrate across grasslands, joining the main dunefield. Some of these migrating dunes become covered by grasses and shrubs and stop migrating. The dune system is fairly stable as the opposing wind directions balance each other out over time. Also, the main dune field is moist beneath a thin layer of dry surface sand. While the top few inches of sand are blown around during windstorms, the moist sand remains largely in place.

Scientists estimate that Lake Alamosa disappeared about 440,000 years ago, but the dunes themselves apparently originate from sand deposits from later, smaller lakes. A relatively new dating process, optically stimulated luminescence (OSL), is still in development. This method takes core samples of sand from deep within a dune and attempts to measure how long quartz grains have been buried in the dark. If the deepest sand deposits can be accurately dated, the age of the dunes could be determined. Samples of sand from deep in the dunes have returned OSL dates varying between a few hundred years to tens of thousands of years old. The oldest dated deposits found so far would have accumulated in the late Pleistocene epoch, during the middle years of the current ice age&#x27;s third stage.

The dunes contain dark areas which are deposits of magnetite, a mineral that has eroded out of the Sangre de Cristo Range. Magnetite is both attracted to a magnet and can be magnetized to become a magnet itself; it is the most magnetic mineral in nature. Magnetite is an oxide of iron which is heavier than the surrounding particles of sand. When overlying sand is removed by wind, magnetite deposits stay in place and are visible as dark patches in the dune field.

==Geography==

Great Sand Dunes National Park and Preserve is located in Saguache and Alamosa Counties, Colorado at approximately 37.75° north latitude and 105.5° west longitude. The national park is located in the San Luis Valley while the national preserve is located to the east in an adjacent section of the Sangre de Cristo Range of the Rocky Mountains. Elevations range from in the valley west of the dunes, to at the summit of Tijeras Peak in the northern part of the preserve.

The dunes cover an area of about while the surrounding relatively flat sand sheet which feeds the large dunes is actually the largest component of the entire dunes system, containing about 90% of all the sand in the park. The forested and often snowcapped mountains exceeding to the east is the most prominent feature, towering over the high dunes. Other features include snow-fed creeks originating high in the mountains, and several alpine lakes. Two spring-fed creeks in the sand sheet along with a few small lakes in the valley&#x27;s sabkha section southwest of the dunes create a wetland that nurtures wildlife.

The main dune field measures roughly east-to-west and north-to-south, with an adjacent area to the northwest called the Star Dune Complex, for a total of about . The park and preserve together are approximately east-to-west at the widest point, and approximately north-to-south, also at the widest point. The park encompasses , while the preserve protects an additional for a total of .

The Rio Grande National Forest is located to the north and southeast while the remaining forested slopes directly to the east of the dunes were redesignated the Great Sand Dunes National Preserve. The San Isabel National Forest is located to the east of the preserve just beyond the ridge of the Sangre de Cristo Range. Private property abuts most of the southern boundary of the park. The San Luis Lakes State Wildlife Area lies adjacent to the southwestern corner of the park, while the Rio Grande flows through the valley farther to the southwest. The Baca National Wildlife Refuge lies adjacent to the west, and the slopes of the San Juan Mountains begin at the western edge of the valley. Private property of the Baca Grande subdivision of Crestone lies adjacent to the northwest.

The nearest city is Alamosa which is about away by road to the southwest. The nearest towns are Crestone to the north, Mosca and Hooper to the west, Blanca and Fort Garland to the south, and Gardner to the east. Colorado Springs and Denver are located a few hours away by car to the northeast. The major roads through the San Luis Valley are U.S. Route 160 on an east–west alignment passing south of the park, and U.S. Route 285 on a north–south alignment passing west of the park and generally parallel to Colorado State Highway 17, which is the closer of the two north–south roadways.

===Climate===

The Great Sand Dunes are located in the high elevation desert of the San Luis Valley at about , just west of the Sangre de Cristo Range. The dunefield&#x27;s Köppen climate classification type is cold semi-arid (&quot;BSk&quot;), while the mountainous preserve&#x27;s climate type is warm-summer humid continental (&quot;Dfb&quot;), at an average elevation of . Summer high temperatures are moderate with an average high temperature slightly above in July, which is the warmest month. The park&#x27;s large spread between high and low temperatures, about , is typical of a high desert climate. Low temperatures during winter nights can be extremely cold, with average low temperatures well below and record low temperatures below from November through April. Precipitation is very low on the dunes, averaging just of rainfall per year. A high evaporation rate on the dunes qualifies the area as a desert, even though precipitation exceeds .

Spring conditions vary greatly, from mild and sunny to cold and snowy, with occasional high winds in the afternoon. March is the snowiest month, though some days are above . In late spring, when Medano Creek usually has its peak flow, snow, and high winds are still possible. In summer, daytime high temperatures average ; however, sand surface temperatures can soar to on sunny afternoons. Summer nights are cool—the park is located above sea level—with nighttime temperatures often dropping below . Afternoon thundershowers are common in July and August with cool winds, heavy rain, and lightning. Fall is generally mild, with Indian summer days when temperatures reach or exceed , but nighttime temperatures drop below freezing. Occasional fall storms bring icy rain or snow. Cold temperatures well below freezing are typical in winter, although the sunshine is generally abundant and the dry air does not feel as cold as more humid areas. The average winter high temperatures are just above freezing even in January, which is the coldest month.

==Ecology==

The four primary components of the Great Sand Dunes system are the mountain watershed, the dune field, the sand sheet, and the sabkha. The mountain watershed receives heavy snow and rain which feeds creeks that flow down from alpine tundra and lakes, through subalpine and montane woodlands, and finally around the main dunefield. Sand that has blown from the valley floor is captured in streams and carried back toward the valley. As creeks disappear into the valley floor, the sand is picked up and carried to the dune field once again. The recycling action of water and wind, along with a 7% moisture content below the dry surface holding the sand together, contributes to the great height of the dunes.

The dune field is composed of reversing dunes, transverse dunes—also called crescentic or barchan dunes—and star dunes. The sand sheet is the largest component of the system, comprising sandy grasslands that extend around three sides of the dune field. Almost 90% of the sand deposit is found in the sand sheet, while the remainder is found in the dune field. Small parabolic dunes form in the sand sheet and then migrate into the main dunefield. Nabkha Dunes form around vegetation. The sabkha forms where sand is seasonally saturated by rising groundwater. When the water evaporates away in late summer, minerals similar to baking soda cement sand grains together into a hard, white crust. Areas of sabkha can be found throughout western portions of the sand sheet, wherever the water table meets the surface. Some wetlands in the sabkha are deeper with plentiful plants and animals, while others are shallow and salty.

===Flora===

There are hundreds of plant species in the park and preserve, adapted for environments as diverse as alpine tundra and warm water wetlands. Trees include aspen, Douglas fir, pinyon pine, ponderosa pine, Rocky Mountain juniper, three-leaf sumac, bristlecone pine, red osier dogwood, and narrow-leaf cottonwood.

Among the flowering plants are alpine phlox, dwarf clover, alpine forget-me-not, fairy primrose, alpine aven, paintbrush flowers, lousewort, blue-purple penstemon, aspen daisy, western paintbrush, elephantella, snow buttercups, scurfpea, Indian ricegrass, blowout grass, prairie sunflower, Rocky Mountain beeplant, rubber rabbitbrush, speargrass, small-flowered sand-verbena, narrowleaf yucca, prickly pear cactus, Rocky Mountain iris, and white water buttercup.

Inland saltgrass is the primary type of grass around the Sabkha wetlands in the park.

===Fauna===

Mammals include—from alpine tundra to low elevation grasslands—pika, yellow-bellied marmot, bighorn sheep, black bear, snowshoe hare, Abert&#x27;s squirrel, gray and red foxes, cougar, coyote, mule deer, water shrew, beaver, porcupine, kangaroo rat, badger, pronghorn, and elk. More than 2000 bison are ranched within park boundaries on private land, owned by The Nature Conservancy, that is closed to the public.

More than 250 species of birds have been documented in the park and preserve. Many species nest in the mountains, forests, grasslands, or wetlands during the summer. From higher to lower elevations, and dependent on season, some of the bird species include the brown-capped rosy finch, white-tailed ptarmigan, red-breasted nuthatch, peregrine falcon, mountain bluebird, northern pygmy owl, dusky grouse, hummingbird (four species), western tanager, burrowing owl, bald eagle, golden eagle, sandhill crane, American avocet, and great blue heron.

Various reptiles live in the park, such as the short-horned lizard, fence lizard, many-lined skink, bullsnake, and garter snake.

Fish living in the park&#x27;s streams include the Rio Grande cutthroat trout, Rio Grande sucker (Catostomus plebeius), and fathead minnow.

Amphibians include the tiger salamander, chorus frog, northern leopard frog, spadefoot toad, Great Plains toad, and Woodhouse&#x27;s toad.

The park harbors several endemic insects including the Great Sand Dunes tiger beetle, a circus beetle (&quot;Eleodes hirtipennis&quot;), Werner&#x27;s (&quot;Amblyderus werneri&quot;) and Triplehorn&#x27;s (&quot;Amblyderus triplehorni&quot;) ant-like flower beetle, as well as undescribed species of clown beetle, noctuid moth, and robber fly. More than a thousand different kinds of arthropods have been found at the Great Sand Dunes.

===Ecosystems===
Alpine tundra is the highest elevation ecosystem at Great Sand Dunes where the conditions are too harsh for trees to survive, but wildflowers, pikas, yellow-bellied marmots, ptarmigans, and bighorn sheep thrive. The tundra begins about and continues upward to the highest peaks in the park. At subalpine elevations near the tree line grow krummholz (meaning &quot;crooked wood&quot;)—trees that are stunted and twisted due to high winds, snow, ice, short growing seasons, and shallow, poorly developed soils. The transition zone between the subalpine forest and alpine tundra is an important refuge during storms for some mammals and birds who primarily live in the tundra. Bristlecone and limber pines grow at an extremely slow rate, with small statures that belie their true ages as some are more than a thousand years old.
Subalpine forests and meadows capture heavy snow in winter and soaking rains in summer. The highest diversity of Rocky Mountain species of plants and animals is found in this ecosystem. Subalpine forest extends from to tree line at . Montane forests and woodlands are found along the drier foothills at approximately to . Pinyon-juniper and ponderosa pine woodlands are found on open, drier slopes, while cottonwood and aspen trees are in drainages. Cougars hunt mule deer here at night. Owls, dusky grouse, turkeys, and bullsnakes all find habitat in these drier, open woodlands.

The riparian zone follows creeks through the subalpine and montane ecosystems at Great Sand Dunes. Cottonwood and aspen trees, red osier dogwood, and alder grow well in this wet environment, in turn providing shade and habitat for black bears, water shrews, and western tanagers. Rio Grande cutthroat trout are found in Medano Creek.

While the top few inches of the dune field are often dry, the dunes are moist year-round due to ongoing precipitation. The moisture content of 7% beneath the surface sand allows species such as Ord&#x27;s kangaroo rat, Great Sand Dunes tiger beetle, scurfpea, and blowout grass to survive here. Many animals visit the dunes from other habitats, including elk, pronghorn, bison, coyotes, bobcats, and raptors.
The sand sheet includes extensive grasslands and shrublands that surround the dune field on three sides, from to . The sand sheet varies from wet meadows to the cool-grass prairie to desert shrubland, depending on proximity to groundwater and soil type. Elk and pronghorn are common, while burrowing owls nest in the ground and other raptors float through the skies searching for mice, kangaroo rats, and short-horned lizards.

The sabkha is a wetland region where groundwater rises and falls seasonally, leaving white alkali deposits on the surface. Inland saltgrass is common in this area. Toads can reproduce in sabkha wetlands when they are seasonally filled with sufficient fresh water. Shore birds such as the American avocet hunt tadpoles and insects in the shallow water. Wetlands speckle the San Luis Valley and are important habitats for sandhill cranes, shore birds, amphibians, dragonflies, and freshwater shrimp. Grassland species such as elk also use these waters for drinking. The sabkha and wetlands are at approximately in elevation.

==Features==

The park preserves the tallest sand dunes in North America, as well as alpine lakes and tundra, mountain peaks over 13,000 feet (3,962 m) in elevation, mixed conifer forests, grasslands, and wetlands.

Medano Creek, which borders the east side of the dunes, never finds a permanent and stable streambed as fresh sand falls in the creek. Small underwater sand ridges that act like dams form and break down, creating surges of water that resemble waves. The surges occur at an average interval of about 20 seconds. In a high-water year, the surges can be as high as . The &quot;surge flow&quot; mainly occurs during the peak flow period from late May to early June in most years.

Big Spring Creek is a unique spring-fed creek formed by an unconfined aquifer that creates wetlands that support rare species and plant communities in a generally arid area. The creek was designated a National Natural Landmark in 2012.

==Recreation==

Accessing the dunes requires walking across the wide and shallow Medano Creek. The creek typically flows past the main dunes parking area from late April through late June, with peak flow occurring from late May to early June in most years. In other months, the creek is usually only a few inches deep, if there is any water at all. Hiking is permitted throughout the dunes, with the warning that the sand can get very hot in the summer, up to . Sand wheelchairs are available at the visitor center. Sandboards and sand sleds can be rented just outside the park entrance or in Alamosa which is the closest city.
Mosca Pass Trail is a roundtrip hike that follows a small creek through aspen and evergreen forests to Mosca Pass—elevation —in the Sangre de Cristo Range. American Indians and early settlers used this route for travel between the San Luis Valley and the Wet Mountain Valley to the east. Several trails located in the northeastern section of the park lead to alpine lakes high in the mountains. A trail to Medano Lake and the summit of Mount Herard is located off Medano Pass Road. A trail along Sand Creek leads to the Sand Creek Lakes and Music Pass—elevation —with a view of the Upper Sand Creek basin. Spur trails along Sand Creek lead to the four alpine lakes which feed the creek and to several peaks above the basin. The Sand Ramp Trail traverses between the dune field and the mountains, connecting the park&#x27;s campground to Medano Pass Road (follow the road up to Medano Lake and Pass), as well as the base of the Sand Creek Trail. Most of the park&#x27;s grasslands, shrublands and wetlands have no established trails but are generally open to hiking. The Nature Conservancy&#x27;s Medano Ranch property may only be visited on a guided tour. A fence surrounds the property to contain the Conservancy&#x27;s bison herd and demarcate the boundaries.

Medano Pass Road is a four-wheel drive (4WD) road that begins where the main park road ends. The unpaved road crosses Medano Creek nine times and traverses of deep sand. Only street-licensed 4WD motor vehicles or motorcycles, and bicycles are permitted. Fat tire bikes are the only type of bicycle recommended by the park service due to the deep sandy stretches. The road winds around the eastern side of the dune field, up through a forested mountain canyon inside the National Preserve, and then over Medano Pass—elevation —at the mark. The road then continues down into the Wet Mountain Valley and connects with Colorado State Highway 69. Travelers are advised that hunting is permitted in the National Preserve during the months of autumn.

Most of the national park and the entire national preserve are open to horseback riding and pack animals. Prohibited zones include all developed areas—such as the Pinyon Flats campground, picnic areas, and the visitor center—all paved roadways and many of the hiking trails, along with the dunes area from the parking lot to as far as the High Dune, which is for pedestrian use only. All national park horse camping areas are in the wilderness in designated backcountry campsites or other wilderness areas at least from roads or trails. Camping is permitted in most places in the national preserve and at designated sites along the Medano Pass Road, as long as minimum impact guidelines are followed. Permitted pack animals in the national park and the preserve include horses, mules, burros, donkeys, alpacas, and llamas. Overnight guests at the Zapata Ranch may take guided trips into the park; Zapata Partners is the only NPS-licensed provider of horseback riding in the Great Sand Dunes.

The national preserve adjacent to the national park is also managed by the National Park Service and seasonal hunting is permitted there. Sport hunting has regulations which include not pursuing a wounded animal if it leaves the preserve and enters the national park. Mountain lion hunting with dogs is also allowed in the preserve, but unless the dogs have spotted the lion and are pursuing it, they are required to be leashed. Other game species include turkey, bear, bighorn sheep, elk, and mule deer.

==Designations==
The dunes and surrounding area were designated a national monument in 1932 after a bill—sponsored by the P.E.O. Sisterhood and widely supported by local residents—was signed into law by President Herbert Hoover. The original monument boundaries protected an area of . Similar support in the late 1990s resulted in the monument&#x27;s redesignation as Great Sand Dunes National Park and Preserve in 2000. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) listed the Great Sand Dunes as a protected landscape (management category V) in 2000, including the national park, the preserve, and the adjacent Baca National Wildlife Refuge.
In 1976, the U.S. Congress designated the Great Sand Dunes Wilderness—a wilderness area encompassing within the monument. This wilderness is the only one in the U.S. that protects a saltbush-greasewood ecosystem and includes the entire dune field as well as much of the area west of the dunes. Congress also designated the Sangre de Cristo Wilderness in 1993, which contains a total of of mountainous terrain. Most of the Sangre de Cristo Wilderness is managed by the U.S. Forest Service while the National Park Service manages the area that has since been designated a national preserve. Mechanized transport and motorized equipment or vehicles are not permitted in wilderness areas, while ATVs are not permitted anywhere in the national park and preserve. The restrictions of a wilderness designation protect native wildlife such as the endemic Great Sand Dunes tiger beetle from potential extinction caused by human activities. Both of the wilderness area designations exclude the existing road corridors that pass through them, specifically the paved park road and the unpaved Medano Pass Road. The IUCN has included the same of dunes and surrounding sand sheets on their global list of wilderness areas (management category Ib) since 1976.

In 1999, the Nature Conservancy purchased surrounding state-owned land. The land is within the Medano–Zapata Ranch, located to the west and south. Some of the ranch lands are located within the current national park boundary in its southwestern corner, and includes a fenced area that contains a bison herd within —an area that can only be visited on a guided tour. The objective of the Nature Conservancy, as well as the federal and state governments, is to combine conservation and sustainable use of the ecosystem, like the protected area mosaic recommended in the early 1980s for parts of the Yukon in Canada.

The eventual redesignation as Great Sand Dunes National Park and Preserve was authorized on November 22, 2000, when President Bill Clinton signed the Congressionally-approved Great Sand Dunes National Park and Preserve Act. The act directed the Secretary of the Interior to &quot;establish the Great Sand Dunes National Park when sufficient land having sufficient diversity of resources has been acquired to warrant its designation.&quot; The new designation as a national park and preserve was made official in September 2004 after sufficient land had been acquired, quadrupling its size.
In 2002, the Nature Conservancy purchased the Baca Ranch—an area of —for $31.28 million. Financing was provided by the Department of the Interior, the Colorado State Land Board, and private donors. The Baca Ranch had property located in the valley and the adjacent mountains, ranging in elevation from west of the dunes to the summit of Kit Carson Peak. The purchase approximately tripled the size of the monument. The ranch was split into three sections: the Sangre de Cristos section east of Crestone became part of the Rio Grande National Forest; the section west of the dunes was designated the Baca National Wildlife Refuge and managed by the Fish and Wildlife Service; the section east of the dunes was transferred first to the Rio Grande National Forest and later redesignated a national preserve in 2004 managed by the National Park Service. The national preserve remains open to regulated seasonal hunting, as it was when designated national forest land, but is protected from logging and mining activities which are generally permitted in national forests.

In 2016, the federal government began negotiations toward purchasing of the Medano–Zapata Ranch from the Nature Conservancy. The plan is to complete the park, making it fully accessible to the public, by acquiring the final piece of privately-held land located within the current park boundaries. The land includes the area presently occupied by the bison herd, as well as adjacent meadows and wetland areas.

In May 2019, the Great Sand Dunes National Park and Preserve was designated an International Dark Sky Park by the International Dark-Sky Association.

<text>An inhibitory postsynaptic potential (IPSP) is a kind of synaptic potential that makes a postsynaptic neuron less likely to generate an action potential. The opposite of an inhibitory postsynaptic potential is an excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP), which is a synaptic potential that makes a postsynaptic neuron &quot;more&quot; likely to generate an action potential. IPSPs can take place at all chemical synapses, which use the secretion of neurotransmitters to create cell-to-cell signalling. EPSPs and IPSPs compete with each other at numerous synapses of a neuron. This determines whether an action potential occurring at the presynaptic terminal produces an action potential at the postsynaptic membrane. Some common neurotransmitters involved in IPSPs are GABA and glycine. 

Inhibitory presynaptic neurons release neurotransmitters that then bind to the postsynaptic receptors; this induces a change in the permeability of the postsynaptic neuronal membrane to particular ions. An electric current that changes the postsynaptic membrane potential to create a more negative postsynaptic potential is generated, i.e. the postsynaptic membrane potential becomes more negative than the resting membrane potential, and this is called hyperpolarisation. To generate an action potential, the postsynaptic membrane must depolarize—the membrane potential must reach a voltage threshold more positive than the resting membrane potential. Therefore, hyperpolarisation of the postsynaptic membrane makes it less likely for depolarisation to sufficiently occur to generate an action potential in the postsynaptic neuron.

Depolarization can also occur due to an IPSP if the reverse potential is between the resting threshold and the action potential threshold. Another way to look at inhibitory postsynaptic potentials is that they are also a chloride conductance change in the neuronal cell because it decreases the driving force. This is because, if the neurotransmitter released into the synaptic cleft causes an increase in the permeability of the postsynaptic membrane to chloride ions by binding to ligand-gated chloride ion channels and causing them to open, then chloride ions, which are in greater concentration in the synaptic cleft, diffuse into the postsynaptic neuron. As these are negatively charged ions, hyperpolarisation results, making it less likely for an action potential to be generated in the postsynaptic neuron. Microelectrodes can be used to measure postsynaptic potentials at either excitatory or inhibitory synapses.

In general, a postsynaptic potential is dependent on the type and combination of receptor channel, reverse potential of the postsynaptic potential, action potential threshold voltage, ionic permeability of the ion channel, as well as the concentrations of the ions in and out of the cell; this determines if it is excitatory or inhibitory. IPSPs always tend to keep the membrane potential more negative than the action potential threshold and can be seen as a &quot;transient hyperpolarization&quot;.

IPSPs were first investigated in motorneurons by David P. C. Lloyd, John Eccles and Rodolfo Llinás in the 1950s and 1960s.

== Components ==

===Types===
This system IPSPs can be temporally summed with subthreshold or suprathreshold EPSPs to reduce the amplitude of the resultant postsynaptic potential. Equivalent EPSPs (positive) and IPSPs (negative) can cancel each other out when summed. The balance between EPSPs and IPSPs is very important in the integration of electrical information produced by inhibitory and excitatory synapses.

===Factors===
The size of the neuron can also affect the inhibitory postsynaptic potential. Simple temporal summation of postsynaptic potentials occurs in smaller neurons, whereas in larger neurons larger numbers of synapses and ionotropic receptors as well as a longer distance from the synapse to the soma enables the prolongation of interactions between neurons.

== Inhibitory neurotransmitters ==
GABA is a very common neurotransmitter used in IPSPs in the adult mammalian brain and retina. Glycine molecules and their receptors work much in the same way in the spinal cord, brain, and retina.

== Inhibitory receptors ==
There are two types of inhibitory receptors:

===Ionotropic receptors===
Ionotropic receptors (also known as ligand-gated ion channels) play an important role in inhibitory postsynaptic potentials. A neurotransmitter binds to the extracellular site and opens the ion channel that is made up of a membrane-spanning domain that allows ions to flow across the membrane inside the postsynaptic cell. This type of receptor produces very fast postsynaptic actions within a couple of milliseconds of the presynaptic terminal receiving an action potential. These channels influence the amplitude and time-course of postsynaptic potentials as a whole. 

Ionotropic GABA receptors (GABAA receptors) are pentamers most commonly composed of three different subunits (α, β, γ), although several other subunits (δ,ε, θ, π, ρ) and conformations exist. The open channels are selectively permeable to chloride or potassium ions (depending on the type of receptor) and allow these ions to pass through the membrane. If the electrochemical potential of the ion is more negative than that of the action potential threshold then the resultant conductance change that occurs due to the binding of GABA to its receptors keeps the postsynaptic potential more negative than the threshold and decreases the probability of the postsynaptic neuron completing an action potential. 

Ionotropic GABA receptors are used in binding for various drugs such as barbiturates (Phenobarbital, pentobarbital), steroids, and picrotoxin. Benzodiazepines (Valium) bind to the α and γ subunits of GABA receptors to improve GABAergic signaling. Alcohol also modulates ionotropic GABA receptors.

===Metabotropic receptors===
Metabotropic receptors are often G-protein-coupled receptors such as GABAB receptors. These do not use ion channels in their structure; instead they consist of an extracellular domain that binds to a neurotransmitter and an intracellular domain that binds to G-protein. This begins the activation of the G-protein, which then releases itself from the receptor and interacts with ion channels and other proteins to open or close ion channels through intracellular messengers. They produce slow postsynaptic responses (from milliseconds to minutes) and can be activated in conjunction with ionotropic receptors to create both fast and slow postsynaptic potentials at one particular synapse. Metabotropic GABA receptors, heterodimers of R1 and R2 subunits, use potassium channels instead of chloride. They can also block calcium ion channels to hyperpolarize postsynaptic cells.

==Significance==

There are many applications of inhibitory postsynaptic potentials to the real world. Drugs that affect the actions of the neurotransmitter can treat neurological and psychological disorders through different combinations of types of receptors, G-proteins, and ion channels in postsynaptic neurons.

For example, studies researching opioid receptor-mediated receptor desensitizing and trafficking in the locus coeruleus of the brain are being performed. When a high concentration of agonist is applied for an extended amount of time (fifteen minutes or more), hyperpolarization peaks and then decreases. This is significant because it is a prelude to tolerance; the more opioids one needs for pain the greater the tolerance of the patient. These studies are important because it helps us to learn more about how we deal with pain and our responses to various substances that help treat pain. By studying our tolerance to pain, we can develop more efficient medications for pain treatment.

In addition, research is being performed in the field of dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area, which deals with reward, and the substantia nigra, which is involved with movement and motivation. Metabotropic responses occur in dopamine neurons through the regulation of the excitability of cells. Opioids inhibit GABA release; this decreases the amount of inhibition and allows them to fire spontaneously. Morphine and opioids relate to inhibitory postsynaptic potentials because they induce disinhibition in dopamine neurons.

IPSPs can also be used to study the input-output characteristics of an inhibitory forebrain synapse used to further study learned behavior—for example in a study of song learning in birds at the University of Washington. Poisson trains of unitary IPSPs were induced at a high frequency to reproduce postsynaptic spiking in the medial portion of the dorsalateral thalamic nucleus without any extra excitatory inputs. This shows an excess of thalamic GABAergic activation. This is important because spiking timing is needed for proper sound localization in the ascending auditory pathways. Songbirds use GABAergic calyceal synaptic terminals and a calcyx-like synapse such that each cell in the dorsalateral thalamic nucleus receives at most two axon terminals from the basal ganglia to create large postsynaptic currents.

Inhibitory postsynaptic potentials are also used to study the basal ganglia of amphibians to see how motor function is modulated through its inhibitory outputs from the striatum to the tectum and tegmentum. Visually guided behaviors may be regulated through the inhibitory striato-tegmental pathway found in amphibians in a study performed at the Baylor College of Medicine and the Chinese Academy of Sciences. The basal ganglia in amphibians is very important in receiving visual, auditory, olfactory, and mechansensory inputs; the disinhibitory striato-protecto-tectal pathway is important in prey-catching behaviors of amphibians. When the ipsilateral striatum of an adult toad was electrically stimulated, inhibitory postsynaptic potentials were induced in binocular tegmental neurons, which affects the visual system of the toad.

Inhibitory postsynaptic potentials can be inhibited themselves through a signaling process called &quot;depolarized-induced suppression of inhibition (DSI)&quot; in CA1 pyramidal cells and cerebellar Purkinje cells. In a laboratory setting step depolarizations the soma have been used to create DSIs, but it can also be achieved through synaptically induced depolarization of the dendrites. DSIs can be blocked by ionotropic receptor calcium ion channel antagonists on the somata and proximal apical dendrites of CA1 pyramidal cells. Dendritic inhibitory postsynaptic potentials can be severely reduced by DSIs through direct depolarization.

Along these lines, inhibitory postsynaptic potentials are useful in the signaling of the olfactory bulb to the olfactory cortex. EPSPs are amplified by persistent sodium ion conductance in external tufted cells. Low-voltage activated calcium ion conductance enhances even larger EPSPs. The hyperpolarization activated nonselective cation conductance decreases EPSP summation and duration and they also change inhibitory inputs into postsynaptic excitation. IPSPs come into the picture when the tufted cells membranes are depolarized and IPSPs then cause inhibition. At resting threshold IPSPs induce action potentials. GABA is responsible for much of the work of the IPSPs in the external tufted cells.

Another interesting study of inhibitory postsynaptic potentials looks at neuronal theta rhythm oscillations that can be used to represent electrophysiological phenomena and various behaviors. Theta rhythms are found in the hippocampus and GABAergic synaptic inhibition helps to modulate them. They are dependent on IPSPs and started in either CA3 by muscarinic acetylcholine receptors and within C1 by the activation of group I metabotropic glutamate receptors. When interneurons are activated by metabotropic acetylcholine receptors in the CA1 region of rat hippocampal slices, a theta pattern of IPSPs in pyramidal cells occurs independent of the input. This research also studies DSIs, showing that DSIs interrupt metabotropic acetylcholine-initiated rhythm through the release of endocannabinoids. An endocannabinoid-dependent mechanism can disrupt theta IPSPs through action potentials delivered as a burst pattern or brief train. In addition, the activation of metabotropic glutamate receptors removes any theta IPSP activity through a G-protein, calcium ion–independent pathway.

Inhibitory postsynaptic potentials have also been studied in the Purkinje cell through dendritic amplification. The study focused in on the propagation of IPSPs along dendrites and its dependency of ionotropic receptors by measuring the amplitude and time-course of the inhibitory postsynaptic potential. The results showed that both compound and unitary inhibitory postsynaptic potentials are amplified by dendritic calcium ion channels. The width of a somatic IPSP is independent of the distance between the soma and the synapse whereas the rise time increases with this distance. These IPSPs also regulate theta rhythms in pyramidal cells.
On the other hand, inhibitory postsynaptic potentials are depolarizing and sometimes excitatory in immature mammalian spinal neurons because of high concentrations of intracellular chloride through ionotropic GABA or glycine chloride ion channels. These depolarizations activate voltage-dependent calcium channels. They later become hyperpolarizing as the mammal matures. To be specific, in rats, this maturation occurs during the perinatal period when brain stem projects reach the lumbar enlargement. Descending modulatory inputs are necessary for the developmental shift from depolarizing to hyperpolarizing inhibitory postsynaptic potentials. This was studied through complete spinal cord transections at birth of rats and recording IPSPs from lumbar motoneurons at the end of the first week after birth.

Glutamate, an excitatory neurotransmitter, is usually associated with excitatory postsynaptic potentials in synaptic transmission. However, a study completed at the Vollum Institute at the Oregon Health Sciences University demonstrates that glutamate can also be used to induce inhibitory postsynaptic potentials in neurons. This study explains that metabotropic glutamate receptors feature activated G proteins in dopamine neurons that induce phosphoinositide hydrolysis. The resultant products bind to inositol triphosphate (IP3) receptors through calcium ion channels. The calcium comes from stores and activate potassium conductance, which causes a pure inhibition in the dopamine cells. The changing levels of synaptically released glutamate creates an excitation through the activation of ionotropic receptors, followed by the inhibition of metabotropic glutamate receptors.

<text>Frederick William MacMonnies (September 28, 1863 – March 22, 1937) was the best known expatriate American sculptor of the Beaux-Arts school, as successful and lauded in France as he was in the United States. He was also a highly accomplished painter and portraitist. He was born in Brooklyn Heights, Brooklyn, New York and died in New York City.

Three of MacMonnies&#x27;s best-known sculptures are &quot;Nathan Hale&quot;, &quot;Bacchante and Infant Faun&quot;, and &quot;Diana&quot;.

==Apprenticeship and education==
In 1880 MacMonnies began an apprenticeship under Augustus Saint-Gaudens, and was soon promoted to studio assistant, beginning his lifelong friendship with the acclaimed sculptor. MacMonnies studied at night with the National Academy of Design and The Art Students League of New York. In Saint-Gaudens&#x27; studio, he met Stanford White, who was turning to Saint-Gaudens for the prominent sculptures required for his architecture.

In 1884 MacMonnies traveled to Paris to study sculpture at the École des Beaux-Arts, twice winning the highest award given to foreign students. In 1888 he opened a studio in Paris and began to create some of his most famous sculptures, which he submitted annually to the Paris Salon. In his atelier, he mentored such notable artists as Janet Scudder and Mary Foote.
He was taught at the Académie Vitti in 1904.

==&quot;Nathan Hale&quot;==

The 8&#x27; tall Nathan Hale statue was the first major commission gained by MacMonnies. Erected in 1893 in New York City, it now stands near where the actual Nathan Hale was thought to have been executed by hanging. Copies are scattered in museums across the United States, since MacMonnies was one of the earliest American sculptors to supplement his fees from major commissions by selling reduced-size reproductions to the public. The Metropolitan Museum has a copy, as do the Art Museum at Princeton University, the National Gallery of Art, Phoenix Art Museum, Orlando Museum of Art, and the Mead Art Museum at Amherst College.

==Major commissions==

In 1888, the intervention of Stanford White gained MacMonnies two major commissions for garden sculpture for influential Americans, a decorative Pan fountain sculpture for Rohallion, the New Jersey mansion of banker Edward Adams, who opened for him a social circle of art-appreciating New Yorkers, and a work for ambassador Joseph H. Choate, at Naumkeag, in Stockbridge, Massachusetts.

In 1889 an Honorable Mention at the Paris Salon for his &quot;Diana&quot; led to further and more public American commissions, including spandrel reliefs for Stanford White&#x27;s permanent Washington Arch, New York, and the &quot;Nathan Hale&quot; memorial in City Hall Park, dedicated in 1893. Until the outbreak of World War I, when he gave up his grand household establishment in Paris, MacMonnies travelled annually to the United States to see dealers and patrons, returning to Paris to work on his commissions. His long-term residence was at Giverny.

In 1891, he designed the statue of James S. T. Stranahan in Brooklyn. That same year, he was awarded the commission for the &quot;Columbian Fountain&quot;, the centerpiece of the 1893 World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition in Chicago: the sculpture of Columbia in her Grand Barge of State, in the vast central fountain of the Court of Honor, was truly the iconic figure at the heart of the American Beaux-Arts movement. This large decorative fountain piece became the focal point at the Exposition and established MacMonnies as one of the important sculptors of the time.

In 1894, Stanford White brought another prestigious and highly visible commission, for three bronze groups for the Soldiers and Sailors Memorial Arch in Brooklyn&#x27;s Grand Army Plaza. The complicated figural groups occupied him for the next eight years.(Bogart, p. 35)

Around the turn of the century, MacMonnies was commissioned to design the equestrian statue of Henry Warner Slocum in Brooklyn, which was dedicated in 1905.

Due to fame gathered from the 1893 World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition, he was commissioned to produce a large public sculpture celebrating the pioneers of the American Old West, his only work on this subject. MacMonnies began the work in 1906, and the work was unveiled in 1911. The monument features a depiction of Kit Carson, and it marks the end of the Smoky Hill Trail, a popular route to Colorado Territory taken by gold-seekers, located near the Smoky Hill River. Meanwhile he was still creating portraits and his 1904 full length painting of his student Mabel Conkling was said to be his &quot;finest .. yet&quot;.

Commissioned in 1908, his Princeton Battle Monument, created in collaboration with architects Carrere &amp; Hastings, located in Princeton, New Jersey was not completed until 1922.(Clark 1984)

==Mid-career==
Returning to New York after 1915, he continued his stylish work with the colossal group, &quot;Civic Virtue&quot;, a fountain for New York City Hall (1909–22). It was the subject of considerable controversy because it depicts a man trampling several female figures, representing evil sirens. This resulted in considerable public criticism. The statue was moved in 1941 to distant Queens Borough Hall and subsequently in December 2013 to Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn.

===The American Monument===

In late 1917, MacMonnies was commissioned by a group of influential citizens of New York City, to work on a sculpture in honor of those who died in the First Battle of the Marne, as a gift to the French people in exchange for the Statue of Liberty. Called, in French, &quot;La Liberté éplorée&quot; (&quot;The Tearful Liberty&quot;) the statue, located in Meaux, France, is over seven stories tall, at . The architect was American neo-classicist Thomas Hastings. While work started on the statue in 1924, it was not finished until 1932. At the time of its dedication, it was the world&#x27;s largest stone monument.
In 2011, the Musée de la Grande Guerre du pays de Meaux opened next to the monument.

The World War I Memorial, in Atlantic City, New Jersey, houses a bronze version of the statue.

==Late career==
Selected to sculpt the fourth issue of the long running Society of Medalists in 1931, MacMonnies chose to celebrate Charles Lindbergh&#x27;s solo Trans-Atlantic flight of 1927. The powerful bust of Lindbergh on the obverse, combined with the reverse&#x27;s dramatic allegorical depiction of a lone eagle battling across the sea, mark this issue as one of the more popular of the series.

Frederick William MacMonnies died of pneumonia in 1937, aged 73.

==Honors==
At the Paris Salon, he was awarded the first Gold Medal ever given to an American sculptor. Elected to the rank of Chevalier in the French Légion d&#x27;honneur in 1896 MacMonnies was awarded grand prize at the Paris Exposition of 1900. This was a decade of enormous productivity and personal satisfaction. A second career as a painter got a good public start in 1901, when he received an honorable mention at the Paris Salon for the first painting he entered. He was selected for the &quot;Major General George B. McClellan&quot; statue in Washington, D.C., which was first exhibited at the Paris Salon of 1906. He was an early member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters. He also won a silver medal in the art competition at the 1932 Summer Olympics.

==Personal life==
In 1888 MacMonnies married a fellow American artist, Mary Louise Fairchild, who was living in Paris on a three-year study scholarship. When the scholarship was completed, she and MacMonnies were married (the scholarship had stipulated that it would be voided if she married during its term), and they continued living and working in Paris, although they frequently returned to the States. They shared the spotlight at the 1893 Chicago Exposition when he was commissioned to create the majestic Columbian fountain that was the centerpiece of the fair. Mary was asked to paint a giant mural, Primitive Woman, for the rotunda of the Woman&#x27;s Building. A facing work, Modern Woman, would come from painter Mary Cassatt.

As their fortunes improved, the couple bought a home in Giverny, the artists&#x27; colony established by Claude Monet. They had three children: Berthe (1895), Marjorie (1897), and Ronald (1899). But their lives increasingly diverged, as Frederick traveled to his Paris studio for large projects; he also had a long-running affair with another American artist (Alice Jones, daughter of Nevada Senator/Santa Monica, California cofounder John P. Jones; she bore his son). He filed for divorce in 1909 (they had three children, two of whom survived infancy), after which he married Jones (1910). In his absences, expatriate American artist Will Low, spending his summers in Giverny, had developed an interest in Mary. In 1909 Low&#x27;s wife died; at nearly the same time MacMonnies filed for divorce from Mary, and Mary and Low were married in 1909. They and her two daughters (Ronald died of meningitis in 1901) moved back to the States in early 1910, while MacMonnies remained in Giverny.

MacMonnies permanently relocated to the States in 1915, impelled by the outbreak of World War I. He lived in New York City until his death in 1937. He is interred in Ferncliff Cemetery, Hartsdale, Westchester County, New York. His grave is unmarked.

<text>In Irish mythology, Fragarach (or &quot;Freagarthach&quot;), known as &quot;The Whisperer&quot;, &quot;The Answerer&quot;, or &quot;The Retaliator&quot;, was the sword of Nuada, the first high king. The sword was forged by the gods and was meant to be wielded only by those who posed above the stone of destiny (the Lia Fail), which roared and the sword whispered to in response.

Nuada lost his arm in the first battle of Mag Tuired and, being mutilated, was no longer suitable to be high king. So, for the second battle of Mag Tuired, Nuada chose Lugh as provisional king. Using his spear and a sling given to him by Manannán mac Lir, Lugh defeated the Formorians and their king Balor. During the battle, Nuada gave Lugh his sword, as a symbol of the king. Neither the poems nor the Lebor Gabála Érenn say whether Lugh wielded the sword in the battle.

It was said that, with Fragarach at their throat, no one could move or tell a lie, thus the name &quot;Answerer&quot;. The sword was also said to place the wind at the user&#x27;s command and could cut through any shield or wall, and that it inflicted piercing wounds from which no man could recover.

<doc id="465526" wikidata="Q1207387" url="?curid=465526" title="Excitatory postsynaptic potential">
<text>In neuroscience, an excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) is a postsynaptic potential that makes the postsynaptic neuron more likely to fire an action potential. This temporary depolarization of postsynaptic membrane potential, caused by the flow of positively charged ions into the postsynaptic cell, is a result of opening ligand-gated ion channels. These are the opposite of inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs), which usually result from the flow of &quot;negative&quot; ions into the cell or positive ions &quot;out&quot; of the cell. EPSPs can also result from a decrease in outgoing positive charges, while IPSPs are sometimes caused by an increase in positive charge outflow. The flow of ions that causes an EPSP is an excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSC).

EPSPs, like IPSPs, are graded (i.e. they have an additive effect). When multiple EPSPs occur on a single patch of postsynaptic membrane, their combined effect is the sum of the individual EPSPs. Larger EPSPs result in greater membrane depolarization and thus increase the likelihood that the postsynaptic cell reaches the threshold for firing an action potential.

EPSPs in living cells are caused chemically. When an active presynaptic cell releases neurotransmitters into the synapse, some of them bind to receptors on the postsynaptic cell. Many of these receptors contain an ion channel capable of passing positively charged ions either into or out of the cell (such receptors are called ionotropic receptors). At excitatory synapses, the ion channel typically allows sodium into the cell, generating an excitatory postsynaptic current. This depolarizing current causes an increase in membrane potential, the EPSP.

==Excitatory molecules==
The neurotransmitter most often associated with EPSPs is the amino acid glutamate, and is the main excitatory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system of vertebrates. Its ubiquity at excitatory synapses has led to it being called &quot;the&quot; excitatory neurotransmitter. In some invertebrates, glutamate is the main excitatory transmitter at the neuromuscular junction. In the neuromuscular junction of vertebrates, EPP (end-plate potentials) are mediated by the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, which (along with glutamate) is one of the primary transmitters in the central nervous system of invertebrates.
At the same time, GABA is the most common neurotransmitter associated with IPSPs in the brain.
However, classifying neurotransmitters as such is technically incorrect, as there are several other synaptic factors that help determine a neurotransmitter&#x27;s excitatory or inhibitory effects.

==Miniature EPSPs and quantal analysis==
The release of neurotransmitter vesicles from the presynaptic cell is probabilistic. In fact, even without stimulation of the presynaptic cell, a single vesicle will occasionally be released into the synapse, generating miniature EPSPs 
(mEPSPs). Bernard Katz pioneered the study of these mEPSPs at the neuromuscular junction (often called miniature end-plate potentials) in 1951, revealing the quantal nature of synaptic transmission. &quot;Quantal size&quot; can then be defined as the synaptic response to the release of neurotransmitter from a single vesicle, while &quot;quantal content&quot; is the number of effective vesicles released in response to a nerve impulse. &quot;Quantal analysis&quot; refers to the methods used to deduce, for a particular synapse, how many quanta of transmitter are released and what the average effect of each quantum is on the target cell, measured in terms of amount of ions flowing (charge) or change in the membrane potential.

==Field EPSPs==

EPSPs are usually recorded using intracellular electrodes. The extracellular signal from a single neuron is extremely small and thus next to impossible to record in the human brain. However, in some areas of the brain, such as the hippocampus, neurons are arranged in such a way that they all receive synaptic inputs in the same area. Because these neurons are in the same orientation, the extracellular signals from synaptic excitation don&#x27;t cancel out, but rather add up to give a signal that can easily be recorded with a field electrode. This extracellular signal recorded from a population of neurons is the field potential. In studies of hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP), figures are often given showing the field EPSP (fEPSP) in stratum radiatum of CA1 in response to Schaffer collateral stimulation. This is the signal seen by an extracellular electrode placed in the layer of apical dendrites of CA1 pyramidal neurons. The Schaffer collaterals make excitatory synapses onto these dendrites, and so when they are activated, there is a current sink in stratum radiatum: the field EPSP. The voltage deflection recorded during a field EPSP is negative-going, while an intracellularly recorded EPSP is positive-going. This difference is due to the relative flow of ions (primarily the sodium ion) into the cell, which, in the case of the field EPSP is away from the electrode, while for an intracellular EPSPs it is towards the electrode. After a field EPSP, the extracellular electrode may record another change in electrical potential named the population spike which corresponds to the population of cells firing action potentials (spiking). In other regions than CA1 of the hippocampus, the field EPSP may be far more complex and harder to interpret as the source and sinks are far less defined. In regions such as the striatum, neurotransmitters such as dopamine, acetylcholine, GABA and others may also be released and further complicate the interpretation.

<text>A cricket ball is a hard, solid ball used to play cricket. A cricket ball consists of a cork core wound with string then a leather cover stitched on, and manufacture is regulated by cricket law at first-class level. The trajectory of a cricket ball when bowled, through movement in the air, and off the ground, is influenced by the action of the bowler and the condition of the ball and the pitch, while working on the cricket ball to obtain optimal condition is a key role of the fielding side. The principal method through which the batter scores runs is by hitting the ball, with the bat, into a position where it would be safe to take a run, or by directing the ball through or over the boundary. Cricket balls are harder and heavier than baseballs.

In Test cricket, professional domestic games that spread over a multitude of days, and almost the entirety of amateur cricket, the traditional red cricket ball is normally used. In many one day cricket matches, a white ball is used instead in order to remain visible under floodlights, and since 2010, pink has been introduced to contrast with players&#x27; white clothing and for improved night visibility during day/night Test matches. Training balls of white, red and pink are also common, and tennis balls and other similar-sized balls can be used for training or informal cricket matches. During cricket matches, the quality of the ball changes to a point where it is no longer usable, and during this decline its properties alter and thus can influence the match. Altering the state of the cricket ball outside the permitted manners designated in the laws of cricket is prohibited during a match, and so-called &quot;ball tampering&quot; has resulted in numerous controversies.

Injuries and fatalities have been caused by cricket balls during matches. The hazards posed by cricket balls were a key motivator for the introduction of protective equipment.

==Manufacture==
British Standard BS 5993 specifies the construction details, dimensions, quality and performance of cricket balls.

A cricket ball is made with a core of cork, which is layered with tightly wound string, and covered by a leather case with a slightly raised sewn seam. In a top-quality ball suitable for the highest levels of competition, the covering is constructed of four pieces of leather shaped similar to the peel of a quartered orange, but one hemisphere is rotated by 90 degrees with respect to the other. The &quot;equator&quot; of the ball is stitched with string to form the ball&#x27;s prominent seam, with six rows of stitches. On international level balls manufactured by Dukes, and SG, the two halves are hand stitched together using three seams on each half. On the ball made by Kookaburra only the inner two seams are used to hold the two halves together. The outer four seams are produced by machine and their only purpose is to provide additional grip for the bowlers fingers. The remaining two joins between the leather pieces are stitched internally forming the quarter seam. Lower-quality balls with a two-piece covering are also popular for practice and lower-level competition due to their lower cost.

The nature of the cricket ball slightly varies with its manufacturer. White Kookaburra balls are used in one-day and Twenty20 international matches, while red Kookaburras are used in test matches played in most of the twelve test-playing nations, except for the West Indies, Ireland and England, who use Dukes, and India, who use SG balls.

==Use==
===Colour===
Cricket balls are traditionally red, and red balls are used in Test cricket and First-class cricket but proposals to introduce other colours date back at least as early as 1937.

White balls were introduced when one-day matches began being played at night under floodlights, as they are more visible at night; all professional one-day matches are now played with white balls, even when they are not played at night. The white balls have been found to behave differently from the red balls: most notably, they swing a lot more during the first half of an innings than the red balls, and they deteriorate more quickly. Manufacturers claim that white and red balls are manufactured using the same methods and materials, other than the dyeing of the leather. Another problem associated with white cricket balls used in One Day Internationals is that they quickly become dirty or dull in colour, which makes it more difficult for batters to sight the ball after 30–40 overs of use. Since October 2012, this has been managed by the use of two new white balls in each innings, with a different ball used from each bowling end; the same strategy was used in the 1992 and 1996 Cricket World Cups. Between October 2007 and October 2012, the issue had been managed using one new ball from the start of the innings, then swapping it at the end of the 34th over with a &quot;reconditioned ball&quot;, which was neither new nor too dirty to see. Before October 2007, except during 1992 and 1996 World Cups, only one ball was used during an innings of an ODI and it was at the umpires&#x27; discretion to change the ball if it was difficult to see.

Pink balls were developed in the 2000s to enable Tests and first-class matches played at night. The red ball is unsuited to night tests due to poor visibility, and the white ball is unsuited to first-class cricket because it deteriorates rapidly and cannot be used for eighty overs as specified in the Laws, also the white ball colour would clash with the traditional white clothes worn. The pink ball was designed to provide a satisfactory compromise on these issues. It is still considered more difficult to see than a white ball; and the leather is more heavily dyed than a red ball, which better preserves its colour and visibility as it wears but also gives it slightly different wear characteristics. It has performed well enough in testing and first-class cricket to be approved for use in international cricket. A pink ball was used for the first time in an international match in July 2009 when the England Women&#x27;s team defeated Australia in a one-day match at Wormsley, and a pink ball was used in a day-night Test match for the first time in November 2015. Other colours were also experimented with, such as yellow and orange (glowing composite), for improved night visibility, but pink proved to be the preferred option.

===Current status===
As of 2014, the ball used in Test match cricket in England had a UK recommended retail price of £100. In test match cricket this ball is used for a minimum of 80 overs (theoretically five hours and twenty minutes of play), after which the fielding side has the option of using a new ball. In professional one day cricket of 50 overs per innings, at least four new balls are used for each match (two in each innings, one for each bowling end). T-20 cricket uses two new balls, one per innings. Amateur cricketers often have to use old balls, or cheap substitutes, in which case the changes in the condition of the ball may be different from professional cricket.

There are three main manufacturers of cricket balls used in international matches: Kookaburra, Dukes and SG. The manufacturer of the red (or pink) balls used for Tests varies depending on location: India uses SG; England, Ireland and the West Indies use Dukes; and all other countries use Kookaburra. The different manufacturers&#x27; balls behave differently: for instance Dukes balls have a prouder seam and will tend to swing more than Kookaburra balls – providing a home advantage when playing against a team unfamiliar with the ball. All limited overs international matches, regardless of location, are played with white Kookaburra balls. White Dukes balls were used at the 1999 Cricket World Cup, but the ball behaved more erratically than the Kookaburra and white Dukes have not been used since. Domestic competitions may use a domestic manufacturer: for example, Pakistan uses Grays balls in its first-class competitions.

Cricket balls can be bowled at over 160km/h (100mph) by pace bowlers and made to deviate from a straight course, both in the air (known as &#x27;swinging&#x27;) and off the ground (known as &#x27;seaming&#x27;). A spin bowler bowls at a slower speed, but imparts lateral revolutions on the ball at the point of delivery, so that when it bounces it deviates from a straight course more significantly than other methods. As cricket bats have become thicker, the ball can now be hit well over before touching the ground.

Cricket commentator and former Test bowler Simon Doull noted that cricket balls produced after Cricket World Cup 2015 produced a lot less swing regardless of manufacturer. This was said to be apparent in 2017 ICC Champions Trophy, even on traditionally swing-friendly British pitches, particularly with white balls, but the former West Indian bowler Ian Bishop was unwilling to support this.

==Condition of a cricket ball==

In Test cricket and T20 cricket, a new ball is used at the start of each innings in a match. In one-day cricket, two new balls, one from each end, are used at the start of each innings. A cricket ball may not be replaced except under specific conditions described in the &quot;Laws of Cricket&quot;:

* If the ball becomes damaged or lost.
* If the condition of the ball is illegally modified by a player.
* In Test cricket, after the ball currently in use becomes 80 overs old, the captain of the bowling side has the option to take a new ball.

The ball is not replaced if it is hit into the crowd – the crowd must return it. If the ball is damaged, lost, or illegally modified, it will be replaced by a &quot;used&quot; ball in a similar condition to the replaced ball. A &quot;new&quot; ball can only be used after the specified minimum number of overs have been bowled with the old one.

Because a single ball is used for an extended period of play, its surface wears down and becomes rough. The bowlers may polish it whenever they can, usually by rubbing it on their trousers, producing the characteristic red stain that can often be seen there. However, they will usually only polish one side of the ball, in order to create &#x27;swing&#x27; as it travels through the air. They may only apply sweat to the ball as they polish it. The practice of applying saliva has been banned by the ICC during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. In a June 2020 press release, the ICC announced that &quot;A team can be issued up to two warnings per innings but repeated use of saliva on the ball will result in a 5-run penalty to the batting side. Whenever saliva is applied to the ball, the umpires will be instructed to clean the ball before play recommences&quot;. The MCC conducted research during the period that shining the ball using saliva was banned, and they concluded that &quot;there was little or no impact on the amount of swing that bowlers were getting&quot;. Therefore, in March 2022, the practice of shining the ball using saliva was banned.

The seam of a cricket ball can also be used to produce different trajectories through the air, with the technique known as swing bowling, or to produce sideways movement as it bounces off the pitch, with the technique known as seam bowling.

Since the condition of the cricket ball is crucial to the amount of movement through the air a bowler can produce, the laws governing what players may and may not do to the ball are specific and rigorously enforced. The umpires will inspect the ball frequently during a match. If the ball is out of shape due to normal wear and tear due to batting and ball hitting the pitch, a ball of similar usage and condition will be used as a replacement: e.g. a ball about 30 overs old will be replaced by a ball about the same age.

It is illegal for a player to:
* rub any substance apart from sweat onto the ball
* rub the ball on the ground
* scuff the ball with any rough object, including the fingernails
* pick at or lift the seam of the ball.
* apply saliva on the ball

Despite these rules, it can be tempting for players to gain an advantage by breaking them. There have been a handful of incidents of so-called ball tampering at the highest levels of cricket.

A new cricket ball is harder than a worn one and is preferred by fast bowlers because of the pace and bounce of the ball off the pitch as well as the seam movement. Older balls tend to spin more as the roughness grips the pitch more when the ball bounces, so spin bowlers prefer to use a worn ball, though a ball of about 8–10 overs old is still useful to a spinner as it can get more drift in the air. Uneven wear on older balls may also make reverse swing possible. A captain may delay the request for a new ball if they prefer to have spin bowlers operating but usually asks for the new ball soon after it becomes available.

==Dangers of cricket balls==
Cricket balls are hard and potentially lethal, so most of today&#x27;s batters and close fielders often wear protective equipment. Cricket ball injuries are fairly frequent, including eye (with some players having lost eyes), head and face, finger and toe, teeth and testicular injuries.

Frederick, Prince of Wales (1707–1751) is often said to have died of complications after being hit by a cricket ball, although the connection between the incident and his actual cause of death is unproven. Glamorgan player Roger Davis was seriously injured by a ball in 1971 when he was hit on the head while fielding. The Indian batter Nariman &#x27;Nari&#x27; Contractor had to retire from the game after being hit on the head by a ball in the West Indies in 1962.

In 1998, Indian cricketer Raman Lamba died when a cricket ball hit his head in a club match in Dhaka. Lamba was fielding at forward short leg without a helmet when a ball struck by batter Mehrab Hossain hit him on the head and rebounded to wicket-keeper Khaled Mashud.

A cricket umpire, Alcwyn Jenkins, died in 2009 in Swansea, Wales after being hit on the head by a ball thrown by a fielder.

On 27 October 2013, South African cricketer Darryn Randall died after being hit on the head by the ball while batting. He collapsed immediately and was rushed to the Victoria Hospital in rural Alice, but the medical staff could not revive him.

In November 2014, Australia and South Australia batter Phillip Hughes died at the age of 25 at a Sydney hospital after he was hit on the side of the neck by a bouncer bowled by Sean Abbott during a Sheffield Shield game. The same week, Hillel Oscar, an umpire and former captain of Israel&#x27;s national cricket team, died after being hit in the neck by a ball.

On 14 August 2017, Zubair Ahmed died after being hit on the head while batting in a club match played in the Mardan District, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan.

==Alternatives to cricket balls==
Sometimes alternatives to a real cricket ball may be preferred for reasons of safety, availability and cost. Examples include a tennis ball and a plastic version of the cricket ball.

Many casual players use a tennis ball wrapped in layers of some type of adhesive tape (often electrical tape), which makes the relatively soft tennis ball harder and smoother. This is commonly referred to as a tape ball. A common variant is to tape only half the tennis ball, to provide two different sides and make it easy to bowl with prodigious amounts of swing.

Younger players often use either tennis balls or an air-filled plastic &#x27;windball&#x27; for safety reasons before using the &#x27;hard&#x27; cricket ball after a certain age: windball cricket is also a popular sport in its own right. They might also use an &#x27;IncrediBall&#x27; or an &#x27;Aeroball&#x27; whilst making the step between windballs and &#x27;hard&#x27; cricket balls. These balls are designed to mimic the feel, speed and bounce of a regular hard ball, but soften when coming in contact with objects at high speed, reducing the risk of injury.

<doc id="465541" wikidata="Q324127" url="?curid=465541" title="Mercedes-Benz E-Class">
<text>The Mercedes-Benz E-Class is a range of executive cars manufactured by German automaker Mercedes-Benz in various engine and body configurations. Produced since September 1953, the E-Class falls as a midrange in the Mercedes line-up, and has been marketed worldwide across five generations.

Before 1993, the &quot;E&quot; suffix in Mercedes-Benz model names referred to &quot;Einspritzmotor&quot; (German for fuel injection engine) when in the early 1960s fuel injection began to proliferate beyond its upper-tier luxury and sporting models. By the launch of the facelifted W124 in 1993 fuel injection was ubiquitous in Mercedes engines, and the &quot;E&quot; was adopted as a prefix (i.e., E 220). The model line is referred to officially as the &quot;E-Class&quot; (or &quot;E-Klasse&quot;). All generations of the E-Class have offered either rear-wheel drive or Mercedes&#x27; 4Matic four-wheel drive system.

The E-Class is Mercedes-Benz&#x27; best-selling model, with more than 13 million sold by 2015. The first E-Class series was originally available as four-door sedan, five-door station wagon, two-door coupe and two-door convertible. From 1997 to 2009, the equivalent coupe and convertible were sold under the Mercedes-Benz CLK-Class nameplate; which was based on the mechanical underpinnings of the smaller C-Class while borrowing the styling and some powertrains from the E-Class, a trend continued with the C207 E-Class coupe/convertible which was sold parallel to the W212 E-Class sedan/wagon. With the latest incarnation of the E-Class released for the 2017 model year, all body styles share the same W213 platform.

Due to the E-Class&#x27;s size and durability, it has filled many market segments, from personal cars to frequently serving as taxis in European countries, as well special-purpose vehicles (e.g., police or ambulance modifications) from the factory. In November 2020, the W213 E-Class was awarded the 2021 Motor Trend Car of the Year award, a first for Mercedes-Benz.

== Predecessors ==

=== W120 (1953) ===
The first modern midsize Mercedes was the W120 &#x27;Ponton&#x27; 180 of 1953 and was produced until 1962. Sharing its engineering with the R121 190 SL of 1955, the Ponton was a stylish sedan with a four-cylinder engine. A larger-engined W121 190 appeared in 1958.

=== W110 (1961) ===
Mercedes added tailfins to both the big S-Class and the new W110 &#x27;Fintail&#x27; 190 of 1962. In the 1965 230 model a Straight-6 engine appeared for the first time, and the four-cylinder engine grew in displacement.

=== W114, W115 (1968) ===
The midsize Mercedes was redesigned in 1968 as the W114/W115 &#x27;Stroke-8&#x27;. This time, the 6-cylinder models (The W114s) were most prevalent, with the W115 line making up the bottom of the company&#x27;s offerings with four- and five-cylinder power. Diesel engines joined the line-up, as did a coupé body.

=== W123 (1975) ===
The popular W123 quickly became a best-seller on its launch in 1976. Especially in diesel powered 200D and 240D (also the five-cylinder 300D) guises, the cars enhanced the company&#x27;s reputation for product quality. Over 2.6 million were produced until the end of production in 1986. Saloon/Sedan, Coupé, and Estate body configurations were offered.

=== W124 (1984) ===
The W124 was presented in November 1984 and introduced several new standards for a mid-size Mercedes. It was the third car to inherit the company&#x27;s new design theme since the late 1970s, following the flagship W126 and compact W201.

Similar to its predecessors, the W124 also offered a coupé and estate body styles. A new convertible (internally A124) was also available, making it the first mid-size Mercedes convertible.

== First generation (W124; 1984) ==

The &quot;E-Class&quot; name first appeared with the facelifted W124 in 1993 for the model year 1994 (the W124 was introduced in 1984 but continued with the older naming convention until 1993 when all Mercedes-Benz models switched to a new system, e.g. E 320 instead of 300 E). The diesel versions continued to be the fuel economy option over the four and six-cylinder gasoline engines, and the gasoline V8 engines (available after 1992) increased gasoline power outputs further. Four-cylinder gasoline models were not marketed in the United States. The V8-powered sedans/saloons were named 400 E/500 E from 1990 to 1993, and E 420/E 500 after 1993. Likewise, the 3.0-liter cars (e.g. 300 E) were also re-badged to E 320 with the new 3.2-liter &quot;M104&quot; engines and naming rationalization of 1994. For the diesel models, the name change was less elegant, with the 250 D becoming the E 250 Diesel for example.

Sedan (W124), Coupé (C124), Convertible (A124), and Estate (S124) body configurations were offered.

== Second generation (W210; 1994) ==
The W210 E-Class, launched in January 1995, brought the line firmly into the upper end of the mid-size luxury market.

The E-class made major changes compared to the earlier version of the E-class, including four large oval headlights, which gave Mercedes an updated image intended to attract more younger buyers and women. The new E-class was longer and wider and offered significantly more interior room but was still considered mid-size.

In September 1999, the W210 E-class was facelifted. This included visual, mechanical, and quality improvements over the earlier versions.

The Mercedes-Benz E-Class was &quot;Motor Trend&quot;″s Import Car of the Year for 1996.

While the W210 sedan was replaced by the W211 in 2002, the wagon version continued to be sold until March 2003 when the S211 wagon returned the S210 wagon.

== Third generation (W211; 2001) ==
Launched in 2002, the W211 E-Class was another evolution of the previous model.

The W211-based C219 CLS-Class 4-door coupe was introduced as a niche model in 2005, primarily to attract a younger demographic.

The W211 E-Class was facelifted in June 2006 for the 2007 model year to address quality and technical issues raised by earlier models, Sensotronic was dropped, while Pre-Safe (w/o brake support) was made standard. The largest factory-built engine in the E-class range is the E500, which had its engine size increased from 5 liters to 5.5 liters in 2006 along with the facelift. There are also AMG models badged E55 and E63, AMG as well as other tuning house installations.

== Fourth generation (W212; 2009) ==

=== Sedan and wagon (W212) ===

The W212 replaced the W211 in 2009 (as a 2010 model). Official photos of the W212 were leaked on the internet on 9 December 2008 ahead of its 2009 Geneva Motor Show unveiling. Scans of a leaked brochure were posted onto the internet in January 2009, detailing the whole E-Class range including the new E 200 CGI and E 230 CGI with direct injected forced induction engines. New features included a blind spot monitor, Lane Keeping Assist, Pre-safe with Attention Assist, and Night View Assist Plus. In the United States the E-Class was priced nearly US$4,600 less than the previous model. The W212 estate was also announced and available from November 2009.

In 2013, the E-Class had a comprehensive facelift, featuring significant styling changes, fuel economy improvements, and updated safety features. Daimler invested close to €1 billion into the development of the extensive refresh, making it likely the most expensive mid-life facelift in the history of the automobile. The biggest change was the singular front lights replacing the twin headlamp design (marking the end of Mercedes&#x27;s dual headlamps use) with integrated LED DRLs. Although not an all-new model, the W212 facelift was the only mid-cycle refresh featured on a family portrait of several generations of the E-Class side by side by Mercedes-Benz for the unveiling of the W213 E-Class. While the factory has rated the E63S model at 577 hp/590 lb-ft, there is significant real-world dynamometer testing that indicates the AMG-tuned S model exceeds 600 hp at the flywheel.

=== Coupe and convertible (C207/A207) ===
The coupé (C207) was first shown at the 2009 Geneva Motor Show, while the convertible (A207) was unveiled at the 2010 North American International Auto Show. Both models replaced the previous C209/A209 CLK-Class models. The C207/A207 E-Class is based on the W204 C-Class platform, and is produced alongside each other in the Bremen plant.
== Fifth generation (W213; 2016) ==
The fifth generation E-Class was unveiled at the 2016 North American International Auto Show. This generation E-Class has design cues from the larger W222 S-Class and the smaller W205 C-Class. While the W212 E-Class has tighter surface and harder edges, the new model is curvier and more flowing.

Engine options for the W213 E-Class saw a major update, thanks to the switch to inline six-cylinder engines from the previous V6 engines, along with a new generation of four-cylinder diesel engines, codenamed OM654, and existing four-cylinder petrol engines.

The W213 E-Class is the second-most technologically advanced Mercedes after the new S-Class. The E-Class received the latest in autonomous driving technology for use at highway speeds, capable of piloting itself up to speeds of for up to 2 minutes. The system uses a complex array of motion sensors, radars, and cameras to scan the road ahead, and requires the driver&#x27;s hands to be placed on the wheel at all times. This feature was also available on the fourth-generation Mercedes-AMG E 63 model.

In 2020, Mercedes-Benz introduced a facelift to the W213.

== Sixth generation (W214; 2023) ==

The sixth generation E-Class debuted on April 25, 2023. Starting from this generation, coupés and convertibles will no longer bear the E-Class name. E-Class and C-Class coupés and convertibles will be spun off into their own CLE vehicle.

<text>The British Salonika Army was a field army of the British Army during World War I. After the armistice in November 1918, it was disbanded, but component units became the newly formed Army of the Black Sea, and General Milne remained in command.

==First World War==


The Army was formed in Salonika under Lieutenant-General Sir Bryan Mahon to oppose Bulgarian advances in the region as part of the Macedonian front. The army arrived in Salonika (along with French troops) on 15 October 1915. In May 1916 Lieutenant-General George Milne replaced Mahon as commander of the Army. It eventually comprised two corps and as the Army of the Black Sea remained in place until 1921.

The dead of the British Salonika Army are commemorated by the Doiran Memorial.

<text>Gerhard Fieseler (15 April 1896 – 1 September 1987) was a German World War I flying ace, aerobatics champion, and aircraft designer and manufacturer.

==From birth to the 1918 armistice==
Born in Glesch (near Cologne), Fieseler joined the Air Service of the Imperial German Army in 1915. A crash during training hospitalized him until February 1916, but he had become an observation pilot by October 1916, flying first with &quot;Feldflieger Abteilung&quot; 243, then with &quot;Feldflieger Abteilung&quot; 41. In 1917 he qualified as a fighter pilot and was posted on 12 July to the Macedonian front, initially flying a Roland D.II with &quot;Jagdstaffel 25&quot;. Fieseler scored his first aerial victory on 20 August 1917. A serious illness removed him from active duty from 21 September until 5 November 1917.

Fieseler would not score his second success until 30 January 1918. He was eventually credited with nineteen confirmed aerial victories, with three others unconfirmed. Commissioned in October 1918, he was the highest-scoring German ace on the Eastern Front to survive World War I. He was awarded the Golden Military Merit Cross and the Iron Cross, first and second class.

==Between the World Wars==
Following the war, he returned to printing, but yearned to return to flying. In 1926, he closed his print shop in Eschweiler and became a flight instructor with the Raab-Katzenstein aircraft company in Kassel and continued to hone his flying skills, becoming an accomplished stunt pilot. In 1927, he performed a particularly daring routine in Zürich and started to command increasingly high fees for appearances. In 1928 while working at Raab-Katzenstein, he designed his own stunt plane, the Fieseler F1 (also known as the Raab-Katzenstein RK-26 Tigerschwalbe), which was offered and sold to a Swedish company called AB Svenska Järnvägverkstäderna (ASJ), which built 25 of the type for Swedish Air Force in the beginning of the 1930s.

In 1930, Raab-Katzenstien was bankrupt, and Fieseler decided to strike out on his own. Using money he had been saving from his aerobatics, he bought the Segelflugzeugbau Kassel sailplane factory and renamed it Fieseler Flugzeugbau. Although he continued with some sailplane manufacturing, from 1932, he set up to start manufacturing sports planes of his own design.

A NSDAP member, Fieseler won contracts to licence-build military aircraft for the new Luftwaffe in 1935. Real success came the following year, when his firm won a design contract against entries from Messerschmitt and Siebel for a STOL liaison/observation plane, that his firm then went on to produce as the Fieseler Fi 156 &quot;Storch&quot;.

==World War II==
&quot;Gerhard Fieseler Werke&quot; produced aircraft for the German military throughout World War II.

==Post World War II==
Following the war, Fieseler spent some time in US custody. When he was released, he re-opened part of this factory and spent some years building automotive components. He also published an autobiography, &quot;Meine Bahn am Himmel (My Road in the Sky)&quot;.

Fieseler died in Kassel, aged 91.

The aerobatic manoeuvre Fieseler is named after him.

<text>Joshua Gibson (December 21, 1911 – January 20, 1947) was an American baseball catcher primarily in the Negro leagues. In 1972, he became the second Negro league player to be inducted in the National Baseball Hall of Fame.

Gibson played for the Homestead Grays from 1930 to 1931, moved to the Pittsburgh Crawfords from 1932 to 1936, and returned to the Grays from 1937 to 1939 and 1942 to 1946. In 1937, he played for Ciudad Trujillo in Trujillo&#x27;s Dominican League and from 1940 to 1941, he played in the Mexican League for Azules de Veracruz. Gibson served as the first manager of the Cangrejeros de Santurce, one of the most historic franchises of the Puerto Rico Baseball League.

Gibson was known as a spectacular power hitter who, by some accounts, hit close to 800 career home runs. (In the Negro League statistical records, his career home run total was 166 and MLB.com recognizes 171.) He was known as the &quot;black Babe Ruth&quot;; in fact, some fans at the time who saw both Ruth and Gibson play called Ruth &quot;the white Josh Gibson&quot;. Gibson never played in the American League or the National League because of the unwritten &quot;gentleman&#x27;s agreement&quot; that prevented non-white players from participating. He stood and weighed at the peak of his career. He was the first player since Oscar Charleston to win consecutive batting Triple Crowns (leading the league in home runs, runs batted in, batting average) and no batter has achieved the feat since.

On May 28, 2024, Major League Baseball announced that it had integrated Negro league statistics into its records, giving Gibson the highest single-season major league batting average at .466 (1943) and the highest career batting average at .371.

==Early life==

Gibson was born in Buena Vista, Georgia, to Mark and Nancy (née Woodlock) Gibson and had a younger brother, fellow Negro leaguer Jerry, and sister. In 1923, Gibson moved to Pittsburgh, and his father found work at the Carnegie-Illinois Steel Company. Entering sixth grade in Pittsburgh, Gibson prepared to become an electrician, attending Allegheny Pre-Vocational School and Conroy Pre-Vocational School. His first experience playing baseball for an organized team came at age 16 when he played third base for an amateur team sponsored by Gimbels department store where he found work as an elevator operator. Shortly thereafter, he was recruited by the Pittsburgh Crawfords, which in 1928 were still a semi-professional team. The Crawfords, controlled by Gus Greenlee, were the top black semi-professional team in the Pittsburgh area and would advance to fully professional, major Negro league status by 1931.

In 1928, Gibson met Helen Mason, whom he married on March 7, 1929. When not playing baseball, Gibson continued to work at Gimbels after he had given up on his plans to become an electrician to pursue a baseball career.

In the summer of 1930, the 18-year-old Gibson was picked up by the Memphis Red Sox for a game in Scranton, Pennsylvania. Despite going 2 for 4, Red Sox manager Candy Jim Taylor was not impressed by Gibson and said afterward that he would never be a catcher.

He was then recruited by Cumberland Posey, owner of the Homestead Grays, which were the preeminent Negro league team in Pittsburgh; Gibson debuted with the Grays on July 31, 1930. On August 11, Gibson&#x27;s wife, pregnant with twins, went into premature labor and died while giving birth to a twin son, Josh Gibson Jr., and daughter, Helen, named after her mother. Helen&#x27;s parents raised the children.

==Baseball career==
The Negro leagues generally found it more profitable to schedule relatively few league games and allow the teams to earn extra money through barnstorming against semi-professional and other non-league teams. Thus, it is important to distinguish between records against all competition and records in league games only. For example, against all levels of competition, Gibson hit 69 home runs in 1934; the same year, in 52 league games, he hit 11 home runs.
In 1933, he hit .467 with 55 home runs in 137 games against all levels of competition. His lifetime batting average is said to be higher than .350, with other sources putting it as high as .384, the best in Negro league history. In 2021, it was announced by Major League Baseball that the Negro Leagues (1920–1948) would formally be recognized as a major league. Ongoing research by Baseball Reference tabulated that Gibson led his league three times in batting average and once for all major leagues, most notably hitting .417 in 1937. He also led six times in on-base percentage and slugging percentage eight times.

Gibson&#x27;s Hall of Fame plaque claims he hit &quot;almost 800 home runs in league and independent baseball during his 17-year career.&quot; This figure includes both semi-pro competition and exhibition games. According to the Hall&#x27;s official data, his lifetime batting average was .359. It was reported that he won nine home run titles and four batting championships playing for the Crawfords and the Grays. It is also believed that Gibson hit a home run in a Negro league game at Yankee Stadium that left the stadium. There is no published or film account to support this claim.

Washington Senators owner Clark Griffith once said that Gibson hit more home runs into Griffith Stadium&#x27;s distant left field bleachers than the entire American League. A 2020 article published by the Society for American Baseball Research provides the supporting details for his homers in major league parks.

===Statistics===
The true statistical achievements of Negro league players may be impossible to know as the Negro leagues did not compile complete statistics or game summaries. As of May 28, 2024, Negro league statistics have been integrated into Major League Baseball, and Gibson is now at the top of the leaderboard in many categories.

Based on the research of historical accounts performed for the Special Committee on the Negro Leagues, Gibson hit 224 homers in 2,375 at-bats against top black teams, two in 56 at-bats against white major-league pitchers, and 44 in 450 at-bats in the Mexican League. John Holway lists Gibson with the same home run totals and a .351 career average, plus 21-for-56 against white major-league pitchers. According to Holway, Gibson ranks third all-time in the Negro leagues in average among players with 2,000+ at-bats (trailing Jud Wilson by three points and John Beckwith by one). Holway lists him as being second to Mule Suttles in homers, though the all-time leader in HR/AB by a considerable margin — with a homer every 10.6 at-bats to one every 13.6 for runner-up Suttles.

Recent investigations into Negro league statistics, using box scores from newspapers from across the United States, have led to the estimate that, although as many as two-thirds of Negro league team games were played against inferior competition (as traveling exhibition games), Gibson still hit between 150 and 200 home runs in official Negro league games. Though this number appears very conservative next to the claims of &quot;almost 800&quot; home runs. This research also credits Gibson with a rate of one home run every 15.9 at-bats, which compares favorably with the rates of the top nine home run hitters in Major League history. The commonly cited home run totals in excess of 800 are not indicative of his career total in &quot;official&quot; games because the Negro league season was much shorter than the Major League season, typically consisting of fewer than 60 games per year. The additional home runs cited were most likely accomplished in &quot;unofficial&quot; games against local and non-Negro league competition of varying strengths, including the oft-cited &quot;barnstorming&quot; competitions.

In nine of his seasons played in the Negro Leagues, he was selected to the East–West All-Star Game twelve times, which included double duty appearances in 1939 (playing at Comiskey Park and Yankee Stadium), 1942 (Yankee Stadium and Griffith Stadium), and 1946 (Griffith and Comiskey).

==Death==
In early 1943, Gibson fell into a coma and was diagnosed with a brain tumor. After regaining consciousness, he refused the option of surgical removal and lived the next four years with recurring headaches. In 1944, Gibson was hospitalized in Washington, D.C., at Gallinger Hospital for mental observation. On January 20, 1947, Gibson died of a stroke at 35 years old in Pittsburgh. He was buried at the Allegheny Cemetery in the Lawrenceville neighborhood of Pittsburgh, where he lay in an unmarked grave until a small plaque was placed in 1975.

==Legacy==

Larry Doby, who broke the American League color barrier in July, felt that Gibson was the best black player in 1945 and 1946; over even Jackie Robinson, who became the first black player in modern Major League history in April 1947 playing in the National League. Doby said in an interview later, &quot;One of the things that was disappointing and disheartening to a lot of the black players at the time was that Jack was not the best player. The best was Josh Gibson. I think that&#x27;s one of the reasons why Josh died so early — he was heartbroken.&quot;

In 1972, Gibson and Buck Leonard became the second and third players, behind Satchel Paige, inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame based on their careers in the Negro leagues. Gibson&#x27;s Hall of Fame plaque claims &quot;almost 800&quot; home runs for his career, although this number cannot be substantiated.

Although validation of statistics continues to prove difficult for Negro league players, the lack of verifiable figures has led to various amusing tall tales about players such as Gibson. An example of such: in the bottom of the ninth at Pittsburgh, down a run, with a runner on base and two outs, Gibson hits one high and deep, so far into the twilight sky that it disappears, apparently winning the game. The next day, the same two teams are playing again, now in Washington. Just as the teams have positioned themselves on the field, a ball falls out of the sky, and a Washington outfielder grabs it. The umpire yells to Gibson, &quot;You&#x27;re out! In Pittsburgh, yesterday!&quot;

The U.S. Postal Service issued a 33-cent U.S. commemorative postage stamp which features a painting of Gibson and includes his name.

In 2000, he ranked 18th on &quot;The Sporting News&quot;&#x27; list of the 100 Greatest Baseball Players, the highest-ranking of five players to have played all or most of their careers in the Negro leagues. (The others were Satchel Paige, Buck Leonard, Cool Papa Bell and Oscar Charleston.) He was nominated as a finalist for the Major League Baseball All-Century Team in the same year.

At PNC Park, home of Pittsburgh&#x27;s Major League Baseball (MLB) franchise, the Pittsburgh Pirates, an exhibit honoring the city&#x27;s two Negro league baseball teams was introduced in 2006. Located by the stadium&#x27;s left field entrance and named Legacy Square, the display featured statues of seven players who competed for the Homestead Grays and Pittsburgh Crawfords, including Gibson. In 2015, without any public announcement, the Pirates removed all seven statues from the Legacy Square area. Ultimately, they were donated to the Josh Gibson Foundation and sold at auction to benefit the Foundation. Most of the statues that were originally located at Legacy Square in PNC Park, including Gibson&#x27;s, are now displayed at the Negro Leagues Baseball Museum in Kansas City, Missouri.

In 2009, a statue of Gibson was installed inside the center field gate of Nationals Park along with ones of Frank Howard and Walter Johnson.

He was named to the Washington Nationals Ring of Honor for his &quot;significant contribution to the game of baseball in Washington, D.C.&quot; as part of the Homestead Grays on August 10, 2010.

Ammon Field in Pittsburgh was renamed Josh Gibson Field in his honor and is the site of a Pennsylvania State Historical Marker.

His son, Josh Gibson, Jr., played baseball for the Homestead Grays. His son also was instrumental in the forming of the Josh Gibson Foundation.

An opera based on Josh Gibson&#x27;s life, &quot;The Summer King&quot;, by composer Daniel Sonenberg, premiered on April 29, 2017, in Pittsburgh.

== In popular culture ==

*In 1996, Gibson was played by Mykelti Williamson in the made-for-cable film &quot;Soul of the Game&quot;, which also starred Delroy Lindo as Satchel Paige, Blair Underwood as Jackie Robinson, Edward Herrmann as Branch Rickey, and Jerry Hardin as Commissioner Happy Chandler.
*The character of Leon Carter, played by James Earl Jones in the 1976 film &quot;The Bingo Long Traveling All-Stars &amp; Motor Kings&quot;, is based on Gibson.
*The character Josh Exley, played by Jesse L. Martin in the 1999 &quot;The X-Files&quot; episode &quot;The Unnatural&quot;, is based on Gibson.

==Miscellaneous==
* Gibson played baseball in the United States, Cuba, Puerto Rico, Dominican Republic, and Mexico, with a lifetime batting average of .354–.384, depending on which statistics are counted.
* Starting in 1932–1933, Gibson played in Puerto Rico. In 1941–1942, Gibson played for the Puerto Rican Professional Baseball League. Playing for the Cangrejeros de Santurce, Gibson won the batting title that season with an average of .480, recognized as the record for that league.
*Barry Bonds referred to &quot;Josh Gibson&#x27;s 800 home runs&quot; in his post-game press conference after hitting his 756th MLB home run.
*Gibson was said by Buck O&#x27;Neil to have created a particular sound like dynamite when he hit the ball that he had heard only three times during his lifetime in baseball. Babe Ruth was the first, when O&#x27;Neil was young, Gibson was the second, when his Homestead Grays came to play O&#x27;Neil&#x27;s Kansas City Monarchs, and Bo Jackson was the third, 50 years later, when Jackson was called up by the Kansas City Royals and O&#x27;Neil was a scout for the Chicago Cubs.

==Career statistics==
===Negro leagues===
According to the Macmillan &quot;Baseball Encyclopedia&quot;, Josh Gibson&#x27;s Negro official league stats were as follows: Total years played: 16. Total games played: 501. Total career at bats: 1679. Total career hits: 607. Total career 2B hits: 89. Total career 3B hits: 35. Total career HR: 146. Total career SB: 11. Career batting average: .362.

The first official statistics for the Negro leagues were compiled as part of a statistical study sponsored by the National Baseball Hall of Fame and supervised by Larry Lester and Dick Clark, in which a research team collected statistics from thousands of boxscores of league-sanctioned games. The first results from this study were the statistics for Negro league Hall of Famers elected prior to 2006, which were published in &quot;Shades of Glory&quot; by Lawrence D. Hogan. These statistics include the official Negro league statistics for Josh Gibson:

<text>Clark David Wissler (September 18, 1870 – August 25, 1947) was an American anthropologist, ethnologist, and archaeologist.

==Early life==
Clark David Wissler was born in Cambridge City, Indiana on September 18, 1870 to Sylvania (née Needler) and Benjamin Franklin Wissler. After graduating from Hagerstown High School, he taught in local schools between 1887 and 1892, and studied at Purdue University after the six-month school term ended. The following year in 1893 he was the principal of Hagerstown High School, and then he resigned his post and enrolled in Indiana University.

==Education==
Wissler received a BA in Experimental Psychology from Indiana University in 1897 and a MA in 1899. He continued his psychology graduate work under James McKeen Cattell at Columbia University. He received his doctorate in psychology from Columbia in 1901. From 1901 to 1903 Wissler performed research on individual mental and physical differences. Wissler&#x27;s doctoral dissertation used the new Pearson correlation coefficient formula to show that there was no correlation between scores on Cattell&#x27;s IQ tests and academic achievement. Wissler&#x27;s dissertation eventually led the psychology movement to lose interest in psychophysical testing of intelligence.

In 1929, he received a LLD from Indiana University.

==Career==
===Early career===
In 1897, he served as an instructor at Indiana University. From 1897 to 1899, he was an instructor at Ohio State University. In 1899 Wissler was appointed assistant in psychology at Columbia University. At Columbia, Wissler also served as an assistant professor of anthropology from 1903 to 1905 and as a lecturer from 1905 to 1909. Wissler was also an instructor at New York University from 1901 to 1902.

===American Museum of Natural History===
After Columbia, Wissler left the field of psychology to focus on anthropology. In 1902 he became an assistant in Ethnology at the American Museum of Natural History under Franz Boas. In 1904, Wissler was named Assistant Curator of Ethnology and in 1905, when Boas resigned, Wissler was named Acting Curator of Ethnology. The following year of 1906, he was named curator of the Department of Ethnology and in 1907 he was named curator of Anthropology when the Archaeology and Ethnology departments were recombined under the Department of Anthropology.

===Yale University===
In 1924 Wissler began teaching at Yale University as a psychological researcher until 1931 when he switched to an anthropology professor, which he held until 1941. Wissler held the position of Curator of the Department of Anthropology until 1942 when he retired.

===Other accomplishments===
He was division chairman of the National Research Council in 1920 and 1921. He was appointed as a member of the National Park Service Board by President Herbert Hoover. Wissler was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1920, the American Philosophical Society in 1924, and the United States National Academy of Sciences in 1929.

==Research==
Clark Wissler performed his field research from 1902 until 1905 on the Dakota, Gros Ventre, and the Blackfoot. Wissler&#x27;s fieldwork provided comprehensive ethnographies of each Native American culture, especially the Blackfoot. While Curator, Wissler funded ethnological and archaeological fieldwork of the Northern Plains and the Southwest. Wissler also &quot;encouraged physical anthropology, built up collections of worldwide scope, planned exhibitions, and oversaw the publication of about thirty-eight volumes of the Anthropological Papers of the American Museum of Natural History.&quot;

Wissler&#x27;s best contribution to anthropology is his culture area approach. &quot;He was the first anthropologist to perceive the normative aspect of culture, to define it as learned behavior, and to describe it as a complex of ideas, all characteristics of culture that are today generally accepted.&quot; Wissler wanted to compare different cultures, but in order to do that he first needed to define what a culture is. The concept of culture area had been around before Wissler, but he redefined the concept so it could be used analytically. Wissler revolutionized the study of culture to a theory of cultural change and as an alternative to the Boasian style of anthropology. Wissler shifted the analytical focus away from the culture and history of a specific social unit to &quot;a concern with the trait-complex viewed in cross cultural perspective.&quot; &quot;The correspondence of a well-defined geographical area with a group of cultures that share many features is the basis of the concept of the culture area.&quot; Wissler states that the principal barriers that preserve the distinctness of a culture area as physical: surface, climate fauna, and flora. Wissler was trying to make cultural anthropology more scientific by forming a definition of culture that could be used to compare similar or different cultures. With a set of parameters for what a culture can be based upon, variables such as climate, environment, resources, food, water, and population size etc., researchers could now compare their studies of Plains Indians to their studies of Great Basin Indians. Wissler also helped introduce statistics with the Pearson correlation coefficient formula which could be used to compare different artifacts in relations to their geological location. This could help understand where a certain artifact, piece of pottery, or type of tool originated by testing if there is a high correlation of a certain artifact with sites in certain areas.

Clark Wissler was the first anthropologist to perceive the normative aspect of culture, to define it as learned behavior, and to describe it as a complex of ideas, all characteristics of culture that are today generally accepted. Wissler was a specialist in North American ethnography, focusing on the Indians of the Plains. He contributed to the culture area and age-area ideology of the diffusionist viewpoint that is no longer popular in anthropology. Ball State University in Muncie, Indiana holds the papers of Clark Wissler. Furthermore, one hall of Indiana University&#x27;s Teter Living Center is known as &quot;Clark Wissler Hall&quot;.

Clark Wissler&#x27;s main area of research was on Native American cultures. His influence is overlooked because of other anthropologists like Franz Boas and Ruth Benedict. Wissler offered some new theories that were quite different from Boas, who was a leading cultural researcher. One of Wissler&#x27;s new concepts was the belief in cultural diffusion and that culture was biologically innate in humans. &quot;Wissler also came up with the age-area hypothesis that is a theory that the age of cultural traits may be determined by examining the distribution of these traits throughout the larger area where these traits are present.&quot; Wissler&#x27;s Influence is still felt in anthropology today and he is credited for helping make the fields of cultural anthropology and psychology more scientific with analytical and statistical testing.

==Views on Race and Eugenics==
Wissler was actively engaged in the American eugenics movement, a movement with the aim of purifying the American population of people with hereditary qualities deemed undesirable. He also was a proponent of a hierarchic racial theory that saw Africans as the lowest and Nordics as the highest rungs. This theory is today considered part and parcel of the early history of scientific racism.

==Personal life==
Wissler married Etta Viola Gebhart of Hagerstown, Indiana on June 14, 1899. Together, they had a son and a daughter, Stanley Gebhart Wissler and Mary Viola Wissler.

==Death==
Wissler died at Doctors Hospital in New York City on August 25, 1947.

<doc id="465563" wikidata="Q521834" url="?curid=465563" title="Arahitogami">
<text>is a Japanese word, meaning a &quot;kami&quot; (or deity) who is a human being. It first appeared in the &quot;Nihon Shoki&quot; () as the words of Yamato Takeru saying: &quot;I am the son of an Arahitokami.&quot;

In 1946, at the request of the GHQ, the Shōwa Emperor (Hirohito) proclaimed in the Humanity Declaration that he had never been an , divinity in human form, and claimed his relation to the people did not rely on such a mythological idea but on a historically developed family-like reliance. However, the declaration excluded the word &quot;arahitogami&quot;.

In Shinto it is somewhat common for a person to be revered as a god, especially after they died, examples include Sugawara no Michizane and Tokugawa Ieyasu.

It is also linked to the Chinese concept of Worship of the living.

==Overview==
 , also known as &quot;man-god&quot; or &quot;human deity,&quot; is a belief in Shinto in which humans are worshipped as gods during their lives or after their deaths. The term &quot;Hitogami&quot; is derived from the Japanese words &quot;hito,&quot; meaning &quot;human,&quot; and &quot;kami,&quot; meaning &quot;god.&quot; In Japan, this belief is also known as &quot;ikigami&quot; or &quot;arahitogami,&quot; especially when the deity is a living person. This concept is distinct from the ujigami (Japanese: &quot;guardian deity&quot;) belief system, which focuses on a deity&#x27;s connection to a specific family or geographic origin. In contrast, the hitogami belief system emphasizes personal faith as the basis for membership in the circle of believers.

People who become human deities include sorcerers, priests, and others who possess special and unusual magical powers, tribal chiefs, kings, and others with superior skills, such as outstanding dancers, soldiers, and others, as well as physically disabled people, Confucian scholars, and foreign aliens who are different from ordinary people. In Japanese folk beliefs, human deities are diverse and can be divided into those who are deified during life and those who are worshipped as human deities after death.

The practice of deifying humans after death is a way to put to rest the legacy of those who have died with a grudge. Examples of the former include toya (head priests), miko (shrine maidens), and masquerading deities in the rituals of the miya-za. Throughout Japanese history, the hitogami and ujigami belief systems have interacted with one another. Examples of the hitogami belief system can be seen in the deification of heroes like Hachiman (god of war) and Tenjin (god of calligraphy), as well as in the ecstatic singing and dancing of Japanese festival processions, and in the charismatic leadership of some of Japan&#x27;s &quot;new religions.&quot;

In ancient societies, it was common for aristocrats who were defeated in political disputes to manifest their grudge as a curse after death and to offer sacrifices to gods in order to quell the curse.

This belief is prevalent in Japan and is known by various names such as &quot;ikigami&quot; or &quot;arahitogami.&quot; People who become human deities include sorcerers, priests, kings, and others with special and superior skills, as well as physically disabled people, Confucian scholars, and foreign aliens who are different from ordinary people. The practice of deifying humans after death is a way to put to rest the legacy of those who have died with a grudge.

== People as Yorishiro ==
Persons can play the same role as a , and in that case are called or .
==Difference between &quot;akitsumikami&quot; and &quot;arahitogami&quot;==

&quot;Akitsumikami&quot; is often translated as &quot;divine&quot; or &quot;divinity&quot;, but some Western scholars (including John W. Dower and Herbert P. Bix) explained that its real meaning is &quot;manifest kami&quot; (or, more generally, &quot;incarnation of a god&quot;), and that therefore the emperor would still be, according to the declaration, an &quot;arahitogami&quot; (&quot;living god&quot;), although not an &quot;akitsumikami&quot; (&quot;manifest kami&quot;). Jean Herbert explains that, according to the Japanese tradition, the figure of the emperor would be &quot;the extension in time&quot; of the goddess Amaterasu and the previous emperors, representing a &quot;naka ima&quot; (中今?). Consequently, it would be inadmissible to deny its divine origin.

<text>Josef Paul Labor (29 June 184226 April 1924) was an Austrian pianist, organist, and composer of the late Romantic era. Labor was an influential music teacher. As a friend of some key figures in Vienna, his importance was enhanced.

==Biography==
Labor was born in the town of Hořovice in Bohemia to Josef Labor, an administrator of ironworks, and his wife Josefa Wallner, who came from a family of doctors. Both of his parents came from Viennese families. His father belonged to the circle of Schubert-Friends and had been in his younger years a composer himself. At the age of three, he was left blind due to contracting smallpox. He attended the Institute for the Blind in Vienna and the &quot;Konservatorium der Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde&quot; (Conservatory of the Society of Friends of Music) where he studied composition with Simon Sechter (teacher of Bruckner), and piano with (student of and Czerny).

He toured Europe as a pianist and, in the process, formed lasting friendships with King George V of Hanover, who was also blind, and with Joseph Joachim, whom he met at Hanover. George named him Royal Chamber Pianist in 1865. The following year, Labor followed the king&#x27;s exile and settled in Vienna, where he became a piano teacher, while continuing to compose and perform. In 1875 he also took organ lessons with and became a distinguished organist himself. In 1904, Labor received the title &quot;Kaiserlich und Königlich Hoforganist&quot; (Royal and Imperial Court Organist) and is today best known for his organ works. Labor took a serious interest in early music and wrote continuo elaborations for Heinrich Biber&#x27;s sonatas.

Labor gave piano lessons to many notable musical personalities including Alma Schindler (who married Gustav Mahler and others), Paul Wittgenstein, and Arnold Schoenberg. Alma Schindler studied with Labor for six years, beginning when she was 14, and her diaries contain numerous references to her esteemed teacher.

Labor was very close to Paul Wittgenstein&#x27;s family. He attended many musical evenings at the Wittgenstein home with such Viennese musicians of the day as Johannes Brahms, Clara Schumann, Gustav Mahler, Bruno Walter, and Richard Strauss. As a compositional teacher he gave private lessons to Julius Bittner and Rudolf Braun.

When Paul Wittgenstein lost his right arm in World War I, Josef Labor was the first person he asked to write a piece for piano left hand. They settled on a concerto for piano left hand and orchestra, something for which there was no precedent. The ground-breaking work was premiered on 12 December 1916 in the Musikverein, Vienna, with the Wiener Tonkünstler-Orchester conducted by Oskar Nedbal. Wittgenstein later commissioned works for the left hand from other composers including Strauss, Erich Wolfgang Korngold, Maurice Ravel, Sergei Prokofiev, Benjamin Britten, and Franz Schmidt (the finale of Schmidt&#x27;s A major Clarinet Quintetthe last of his Wittgenstein commissionsis a set of variations on a theme from Labor&#x27;s own clarinet and piano quintet, Op. 11, published in 1901).

Paul&#x27;s brother, the philosopher and writer Ludwig Wittgenstein, praised Josef Labor as one of &quot;the six truly great composers&quot; along with Mozart, Haydn, Beethoven, Schubert, and Brahms.

<text>The hammerhead turn, stall turn, or Fieseler is an aerobatics turn-around maneuver.

==Description==
Enter at full power and maximum airspeed. Pull the aircraft up through a quarter loop into a vertical climb. The speed will decay but before upward motion stops firmly apply full rudder to yaw the aircraft through a cartwheel of 180° until the nose is straight down. Dive vertically to the same altitude as the maneuver started, then pull out, exiting in the opposite direction.

==Flying technique==
The timing of applying full rudder is critical. If instigated too soon it results in a wingover. If instigated too late the plane will fall into a sideslip or else enter a tailslide which most aircraft are restricted from doing.

Performing the pivot requires sufficient airflow over the rudder. In planes with a suitably-positioned propeller, the propwash may provide this. Otherwise, rudder must be applied sooner while the plane still has forward airspeed.

This maneuver demands there be no rolling at all but when airflow is minimal ailerons become ineffective. So as soon as the yaw is established reduce throttle to prevent the aircraft from rolling due to engine torque. Do not open the throttle again until the dive when sufficient airspeed has been gained for aileron control. Reduced throttle will also prevent gyroscopic precession from pitching the nose up.

Higher lift from the faster moving outside right wing will roll the airplane to the left. To maintain attitude in addition to left rudder, holding forward right stick necessary throughout the pivot. Depending on the direction of the turn, the opposite may apply.

==SAR reversal==
This maneuver has also been called the search and rescue reversal. SAR helicopters fly this when hunting survivors or submarines, because it brings the aircraft directly back along the same course to verify the target. The maneuver doesn&#x27;t require visual meteorological conditions (VMC) if the pilot is proficient at maintaining altitude by keeping the lateral acceleration ball centered, as any uncoordinated lateral acceleration will induce spatial disorientation.
