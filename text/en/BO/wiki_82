<text>Truganini ( 1812 – 8 May 1876), also known as Lalla Rookh and Lydgugee, was a woman famous for being widely described as the last &quot;full-blooded&quot; Aboriginal Tasmanian to survive British colonisation. Although she was one of the last speakers of the Indigenous Tasmanian languages, Truganini was not the last Aboriginal Tasmanian. 

She lived through the devastation of invasion and the Black War in which most of her relatives died, avoiding death herself by being assigned as a guide in expeditions organised to capture and forcibly exile all the remaining Indigenous Tasmanians. Truganini was later taken to the Port Phillip District where she engaged in armed resistance against the colonists. She herself was then exiled, first to the Wybalenna Aboriginal Establishment on Flinders Island and then to Oyster Cove in southern Tasmania. Truganini died at Hobart in 1876, her skeleton later being placed on public display at the Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery until 1948. Her remains were finally cremated and laid to rest in 1976.

In being mythologised as &quot;the last of her people&quot;, Truganini became the tragic and triumphal symbol of the conquest of British colonists over an &quot;inferior race&quot;. In modern times, Truganini&#x27;s life has become representative of both the dispossession and destruction that was exacted upon Indigenous Australians and also their determination to survive the colonial genocidal policies that were enforced against them.

==Name and spelling==
Other spellings of her name include &quot;Trukanini&quot;, &quot;Trugernanner, Trugernena, Truganina, Trugannini, Trucanini, Trucaminni&quot;, and &quot;Trucaninny&quot;. Truganini was widely known by the nickname &quot;Lalla(h) Rookh&quot;, and also called &quot;Lydgugee&quot;.

In the Indigenous Bruny Island language, &quot;truganina&quot; was the name of the grey saltbush, &quot;Atriplex cinerea&quot;.

&quot;Lalla Rookh&quot; was an Orientalist romance by Irish poet Thomas Moore, published in 1817.

==Early life==
Truganini was born around 1812 at Recherche Bay (&quot;Lyleatea&quot;) in southern Tasmania. Her father was Manganerer, a senior figure of the Nuenonne people whose country extended from Recherche Bay across the D&#x27;Entrecasteaux Channel to Bruny Island (&quot;Lunawanna-alonnah&quot;). Truganini&#x27;s mother was probably a Ninine woman from the area around Port Davey.

At the time of Truganini&#x27;s birth, the British had already begun colonising the region around Nuenonne country, severely disrupting the ability of her people to live and practise their traditional culture. The violence directed at the Nuenonne, who were regarded as helpful to the colonists, was sustained and horrific. Around 1816, a group of British sailors raided the camp of Truganini&#x27;s family, stabbing her mother to death. In 1826, Truganini&#x27;s older sisters Lowhenune and Magerleede were abducted by a sealer and eventually sold to other sealers on Kangaroo Island, while in 1829 her step-mother was abducted by mutinous convicts and taken to New Zealand.

There is also an account that around 1828 Truganini&#x27;s uncle was shot by a soldier, and that she was abducted and raped by timber-cutters. The timber-cutters also brutally murdered and drowned two Nuenonne men, one of which was Truganini&#x27;s fiancé, by throwing them out of a boat and cutting off their hands with an axe as they tried to clamber back in.

By 1828 the British had established three whaling stations on Bruny Island. A relationship existed between the whalers and Nuenonne females, where flour, sugar and tea were exchanged for sex. Truganini participated in this trade. She also was an exceptional swimmer and provided further food for her people by diving for abalone and other shellfish.

==Association with George Augustus Robinson==
In 1828, the Lieutenant-Governor of Van Diemen&#x27;s Land, Colonel George Arthur, ordered the creation of an Aboriginal ration station on Bruny Island, which in 1829 was placed under the authority of an English builder and evangelical Christian named George Augustus Robinson. 
On arriving at Bruny Island, Robinson was immediately impressed by Truganini&#x27;s intelligence and decided to form a close association with her to facilitate other Nuenonne to come to the Aboriginal station which he established at Missionary Bay on the west side of the island. With the assistance of Truganini, Robinson initially had some success in attracting Nuenonne and Ninine people to his establishment. He even took Truganini and her cousin Dray to Hobart dressed in fine European dresses to display them to the Lieutenant-Governor as being examples of his ability to &quot;civilise the natives&quot;.

However, colonial violence and European diseases rapidly killed off most of the Indigenous people who visited the establishment, including Truganini&#x27;s father Manganerer. By October 1829, only a handful of Nuenonne and Ninine had survived, and to strengthen his father-like bonds with the survivors, Robinson oversaw the partnering of the young Truganini with an important surviving Nuenonne man named Woureddy.

==Guide for the &quot;friendly mission&quot;==
Realising that the Aboriginal station at Bruny Island was doomed, Robinson formulated a scheme to use Truganini, Woureddy and a few other captured Aboriginal people such as Kikatapula and Pagerly, to guide him to the clans residing in the uncolonised western parts of Van Diemen&#x27;s Land. Once contacted, Robinson would &quot;conciliate&quot; these clans to accept the British invasion and avoid conflict. Lieutenant-Governor Arthur approved Robinson&#x27;s plan and employed him to conduct this venture which was named the &quot;friendly mission&quot;.

The mission left Bruny Island in early 1830 with Truganini playing a very important role not only as an linguistic interpreter on local Aboriginal language and culture, but also by providing much of the seafood for the group. None of the men in the expedition could swim, so Truganini also did most of the work pushing the other group members on small rafts across the various rivers they encountered.
As they made their way up the west coast past Bathurst Harbour and Macquarie Harbour, the &quot;friendly mission&quot; made brief contacts with Ninine and Lowreenne clans. When Truganini and Woureddy were sent to obtain rations at the Macquarie Harbour Penal Station on Sarah Island, Robinson was abandoned by his other guides. Alone, starving and debilitated by skin and eye infections, Robinson was saved from death by being located by Truganini and Woureddy on their return from the penal colony.

By June 1830, the group had reached the north west tip of Van Diemen&#x27;s Land known as Cape Grim. Here they found that the Van Diemen&#x27;s Land Company had appropriated a massive area of land for farmland; displacing and massacring the local Tarkiner, Pennemukeer, Pairelehoinner, Peternidic and Peerapper clans in the process. Sealers on nearby Robbins Island were also found with women kidnapped from both local clans and elsewhere in Tasmania. On meeting Truganini, the kidnapped women cried with joy as Robinson negotiated their release. However, Robinson being informed that the government were offering a £5 bounty for every native captured, now sought financial gain from his &quot;friendly mission&quot;. He duplicitously used a Pairelehoinner youth named Tunnerminnerwait to gather some of the local people, who he shipped to Launceston to claim the bounty. Joseph Fossey, the superintendent for the Van Diemen&#x27;s Land Company, meanwhile took an interest in Truganini and wanted her as an &quot;evening companion&quot;. An experienced convict bushman attached to Robinson&#x27;s expedition named Alexander McKay also began a sexual relationship with Truganini at this time.

The expedition made its way east to Launceston where the settler population was preparing for the climax of the Black War. Called the Black Line, it was a 2,200 man strong chain of armed colonists and soldiers to sweep the settled areas looking to kill or trap any Aboriginal people they found. Robinson, Truganini and the other guides were allowed to continue their mission to the north-east, away from the direction of the Black Line.

They arrived at Cape Portland in October 1830 having rescued several Indigenous women from the slavery of the local sealers, and been joined by the respected warrior Mannalargenna and his small remnant clan. They were informed of the failure of the Black Line to capture or kill many Aboriginal people and it was decided by the government to use the nearby Bass Strait Islands as a place of enforced exile for those Indigenous Tasmanians collected by Robinson.

Robinson&#x27;s first choice of island to confine the approximately 20 Aboriginal Tasmanians in his charge was Swan Island. Exposed to powerful gales, the small island had poor access to water supply and was infested with tiger snakes. After not only coming close to being bitten by one of these deadly snakes, Truganini managed to escape a large shark when diving for crayfish. However, Robinson soon took Truganini and a few other guides off this island to accompany him to Hobart where he had a meeting with the Lieutenant-Governor in early 1831. For his &quot;friendly mission&quot; work, Robinson was rewarded with land grants and hundreds of pounds worth of pay increases. Truganini&#x27;s reward, in contrast, was a set of cotton dresses.

==Guide for further expeditions to capture the remaining Aboriginal Tasmanians==
While in Hobart, Robinson successfully negotiated a contract with the colonial authorities for him to lead further expeditions to capture all the remaining Aboriginal Tasmanians and transfer them to confinement in Bass Strait. Robinson firstly took Truganini, the other guides and around 25 Aboriginal people held in various hospitals and jails in Hobart and Launceston, and transported them to Swan Island where the others were still being held. The combined captive population swelled to over 50 and Robinson decided to move the place of exile to a former sealer&#x27;s camp on Gun Carriage Island.

===Expedition of 1831===
Gun Carriage Island proved little better than Swan Island and many of the exiled Aborigines started to sicken, with several dying in the first few weeks. Truganini was able to escape this disaster though as Robinson took her, Woureddy, Kikatapula, Pagerly, Mannalargenna, Woretemoeteryenner, Tunnerminnerwait and Maulboyheenner as guides to capture the remaining Aboriginal Tasmanians in the settled districts. They started off in July 1831 with the initial aim of finding the respected Tyerrernotepanner leader Eumarrah and his small clan, whom they captured in late August near the locality of Pipers Brook. They then continued on, looking to take captive the remaining members of the Oyster Bay and Big River tribes who had condensed into a single group taking refuge in the Central Highlands. Truganini and the other Indigenous guides frustrated Robinson by seeming to alert this group of their approach and it wasn&#x27;t until December that they were seized. This group which included the once-feared warriors Tongerlongeter and Montpelliatta, were paraded in Hobart before being transported to Gun Carriage Island.

===Expeditions of 1832 and 1833===
Truganini again avoided exile to the Bass Strait Islands by being a guide for Robinson&#x27;s expedition to capture the remaining Indigenous people of the west coast of Tasmania. Several other guides including Eumarrah and Kikatapula died early in the expedition, but Robinson still managed to apprehend through deceitful means most of the remaining tribespeople from the Cape Grim region. In September 1832, Truganini saved Robinson by swimming him across the Arthur River away from a group of Tarkiner people who intended to kill him.

In late 1832 and early 1833, Truganini assisted in several mostly unsuccessful expeditions in the west and south-west led by the colonist Anthony Cottrell, whom Robinson had delegated authority to while he was away.

In April 1833, Robinson returned to lead another expedition to seize the west coast clans, with Truganini, Woureddy and others again chosen as guides. Robinson captured the remaining Ninine by taking captive the child of a prominent man named Towterer which forced the clan to surrender. By July they had captured almost all of the remaining west coast people including the Tarkiner tribe led by a man named Wyne who had attempted to kill Robinson the previous year. Truganini was employed by Robinson to push the rafts carrying people across the rivers. The water in winter was very cold and Truganini performed this arduous task almost daily for weeks. She had a seizure after a particularly demanding day of ferrying captives. 

Robinson deposited his prisoners at the Macquarie Harbour Penal Station to await transportation to Flinders Island where the Wybalenna Aboriginal Establishment had been formed to replace the internment camp at Gun Carriage Island. The approximately 35 captives were held in terrible conditions at Macquarie Harbour, with around half dying from bacterial pneumonia and suicide within a couple of weeks. This included previously healthy young men, pregnant women and infants. Over 80% of the captured Tarkiner people perished. After shipping off the survivors to Wybalenna, Robinson returned with his guides to Hobart.

===Expedition of 1834===
Some Aboriginal people were still reported to be residing in the wilderness around Sandy Cape and the Vale of Belvoir, so in early 1834 Robinson set out again with Truganini and the other guides to find them. Before heading west, they firstly attempted to obtain two Aboriginal slaves that were in possession of John Batman at his Kingston estate along the Ben Lomond Rivulet. However, Batman, who at this stage had tertiary syphilis, refused to give them up saying they were his property.

From February to April, Robinson&#x27;s group located and captured twenty Tarkiner people on the west coast. This was despite Truganini and Woureddy temporarily refusing to act as guides for Robinson. However, crossing the Arthur River on the return journey, Truganini again saved Robinson&#x27;s life by swimming out to his raft and towing it to the bank after it was carried away by the swift current.

After sending these Tarkiner off to exile at Wybalenna, Robinson left the expedition, placing his sons in charge to find the remnant Tommigener clan located near the Vale of Belvoir. For months, Truganini and the others trudged through heavy winter snow and spring rains but finally located the last eight people of this tribe in December near the Western Bluff. In February 1835, these Tommigener were shipped off to Wybalenna from Launceston, leaving Robinson to claim his rewards for removing almost in entirety the remaining Aboriginal population from mainland Tasmania.

==Wybalenna and a final expedition==

With the completion of the removal of Aborigines from mainland Tasmania, Robinson brought his Indigenous guides to his house in Hobart for a few months of respite. During this period Truganini and Woureddy became celebrities and had their portraits painted by Thomas Bock and the sculptor Benjamin Law also created casts and busts of their profiles. However, in September 1835, they too were taken into exile at the Wybalenna Aboriginal Establishment with the other Indigenous Tasmanians.

Robinson became the superintendent at Wybalenna and began a program of Christianising the inmates. He changed their names, made them wear European clothes and attempted to prohibit their practising of Aboriginal culture and language. Illness and mortality rates were high. Although Truganini&#x27;s name was changed to Lalla Rookh, she remained otherwise resistant to the enforced changes, defiantly keeping her cultural practices.

In March 1836, she and eight others from Wybalenna were chosen as guides for a final expedition led by Robinson&#x27;s sons to locate a last Indigenous group in north-west Tasmania that had managed to avoid Robinson&#x27;s previous missions. For sixteen months, this relatively leisurely expedition provided an escape for Truganini from the death and misery of Wybalenna. They managed to locate a Tarkiner family group with four children (one of whom would later be known as William Lanne), but they refused to go to Flinders Island. By July 1837, Truganini and the other guides were taken back to Wybalenna.

==Port Phillip District==
In 1839, Robinson accepted the position of Protector of Aborigines in the newly colonised Port Phillip District in present-day Victoria. Robinson quit his role as manager of Wybalenna and took Truganini and sixteen other Aboriginal Tasmanians with him as servants. However, once in Melbourne, Robinson was soon not able to keep such a large number of assistants, and Truganini with most of the others were left to fend for themselves.

Truganini gained income from selling her traditional woven baskets and by offering her company to townsmen and shepherds. Oral histories claimed that she had a child named Louisa Esmai with John Strugnell at Point Nepean in Victoria, but anthropologist Diane Barwick later disproved those claims in 1974. 

In 1841, Truganini abandoned her husband Woureddy, and ran off with Maulboyheenner, a young Tasmanian Aboriginal man who had also come from Wybalenna. They were joined by another Tasmanian man named Tunnerminnerwait and two women called Plorenernoopner and Maytepueminer. The group decided to head to Westernport Bay to take revenge on a local colonist named William Watson, whom they believed shot dead Maytepueminer&#x27;s husband Lacklay.

The group stole some guns and staked out Watson&#x27;s beachside hut at the Powlett River. While Watson was away they plundered and set fire to the hut, causing his wife and daughter to flee. When Watson returned, they shot at him wounding him and his servant. The group then hid out in the bush while Watson went to get armed reinforcements.

A few days later, two whalers named Yankee and Cook, happened to be walking along the beach looking for provisions. They approached the hide-out of Truganini&#x27;s group, who mistook them for Watson and his man. Maulboyheenner and Tunnerminnerwait subsequently shot and beat the whalers to death.

As a result, the five Aboriginal Tasmanians became outlaws, triggering a long pursuit by the authorities around the Bass River and Tooradin regions. The group raided huts along the way, taking food, guns and ammunition. A party under the command of Commissioner Frederick Powlett was tasked with apprehending them. Powlett&#x27;s force consisted of 30 armed and mounted men, including soldiers, colonists, Border Police and Native Police troopers.

After a month at large, Powlett managed to surround and ambush the outlaws back at the Powlett River area. Thirty guns fired simultaneously at the Aboriginal Tasmanians only resulted in Maytepueminer receiving a slight graze to the head. Truganini and the others were then taken into custody.

The two men were charged with murder and Truganini with the two other women were charged with being accessories to the crime. At the trial in Melbourne, the three women including Truganini were exonerated, but Maulboyheenner and Tunnerminnerwait were found guilty. The two men were publicly hanged in what was the first legal execution conducted in Melbourne on 20 January 1842.

==Oyster Cove==

Truganini and Robinson&#x27;s other surviving Aboriginal guides were transported back to Wybalenna on Flinders Island several months later. Her first husband, Woureddy, died on the journey. At Wybalenna, Truganini refused to be bound by the rules and often ran away with the local sealers. The superintendent forced her into a marriage with Mannapackername, a detainee who was regarded as reliable man, but this did little to modify her rebelliousness, in fact Mannapackername himself became insubordinate under Truganini&#x27;s influence.

By 1847, many of the exiled Aboriginal Tasmanians at Wybalenna had died including Mannapackername and it was decided to shift the approximately 47 survivors to an abandoned convict settlement at Oyster Cove, south of Hobart.
Oyster Cove had been abandoned as a convict station due to its infertile soil and unhealthy dampness. The buildings had poor ventilation and were in disrepair, and the new Aboriginal detainees sickened as they did at Wybalenna. However, Oyster Cove was also located in Truganini&#x27;s home Nuenonne country and she was allowed to go on extensive hunting journeys across what was once her people&#x27;s land. She often used a boat to travel across to Bruny Island to dive for crayfish, hunt for swan eggs or collect small shells to make her distinctive necklaces.

Demoralisation though set in for the other inmates and the local British settlers encouraged prostitution and alcoholism to thrive at Oyster Cove. Death followed with detainees such as Mathinna dying miserably. According to &quot;The Times&quot; newspaper, quoting a report issued by the Colonial Office, by 1861 the number of survivors at Oyster Cove was only fourteen: ...14 persons, all adults, aboriginals of Tasmania, who are the sole surviving remnant of ten tribes. Nine of these persons are women and five are men. There are among them four married couples, and four of the men and five of the women are under 45 years of age, but no children have been born to them for years. It is considered difficult to account for this... Besides these 14 persons there is a native woman who is married to a white man, and who has a son, a fine healthy-looking child...The article, headed &quot;Decay of Race&quot;, adds that although the survivors enjoyed generally good health and still made hunting trips to the bush during the season, after first asking &quot;leave to go&quot;, they were now &quot;fed, housed and clothed at public expense&quot; and &quot;much addicted to drinking&quot;.

Truganini continued to survive and in the 1860s became involved in a relationship with a younger Tasmanian Aboriginal man, William Lanne (known as &quot;King Billy&quot;) who died in March 1869. 

By 1873, Truganini was the sole Aboriginal Tasmanian survivor at Oyster Cove. The government subsequently sold off the land and buildings, with Truganini being moved to Hobart to live in the family home of the last superintendent of the Oyster Cove facility.

==Death==
She died in May 1876 and was buried at the former Female Factory at Cascades, a suburb of Hobart. Before her death, Truganini had pleaded to colonial authorities for a respectful burial, and requested that her ashes be scattered in the D&#x27;Entrecasteaux Channel. She feared that her body would be mutilated for perverse scientific purposes as William Lanne&#x27;s had been.

Despite her wishes, within two years, her skeleton was exhumed by the Royal Society of Tasmania. It was placed on public display in the Tasmanian Museum in 1904 where it remained until 1947. Only in April 1976, approaching the centenary of her death, were Truganini&#x27;s remains finally cremated and scattered according to her wishes. In 2002, some of her hair and skin were found in the collection of the Royal College of Surgeons of England and returned to Tasmania for burial.

== Legacy ==
Truganini is often incorrectly referred to as the last speaker of a Tasmanian language. However, &quot;The Companion to Tasmanian History&quot; details three full-blood Tasmanian Aboriginal women, Sal, Suke and Betty, who lived on Kangaroo Island in South Australia in the late 1870s and &quot;all three outlived Truganini&quot;. There were also Tasmanian Aboriginal people living on Flinders and Lady Barron Islands. Fanny Cochrane Smith (1834–1905) outlived Truganini by 30 years and in 1889 was officially recognised as the last Tasmanian Aboriginal person, though there has been speculation that she was actually mixed-race. Smith recorded songs in her native language, the only audio recordings that exist of an indigenous Tasmanian language.

According to historian Cassandra Pybus&#x27;s 2020 biography, Truganini&#x27;s mythical status as the &quot;last of her people&quot; has overshadowed the significant roles she played in Tasmanian and Victorian history during her lifetime. Pybus states that &quot;for nearly seven decades she lived through a psychological and cultural shift more extreme than most human imaginations could conjure; she is a hugely significant figure in Australian history&quot;.

Truganini Place in the Canberra suburb of Chisholm is named in her honour. The suburb of Truganina in Melbourne&#x27;s outer western suburbs is believed to be named after her, as she had visited the area for a short time.

==Cultural depictions==
===Visual art===
In 1835 and 1836, settler Benjamin Law created a pair of busts depicting Truganini and Woureddy in Hobart Town that have come under recent controversy. In 2009, members of the Tasmanian Aboriginal Centre protested an auction of these works by Sotheby&#x27;s in Melbourne, arguing that the sculptures were racist, perpetuated false myths of Aboriginal extinction, and erased the experiences of Tasmania&#x27;s remaining indigenous populations. Representatives called for the busts to be returned to Tasmania and given to the Aboriginal community, and were ultimately successful in stopping the auction.

Artist Edmund Joel Dicks also created a plaster bust of Truganini, which is in the collection of the National Museum of Australia.

In 1997, the Royal Albert Memorial Museum, Exeter, England, returned Truganini&#x27;s necklace and bracelet to Tasmania.

<text>Teimour Boris oghlu Radjabov (also spelled Teymur Rajabov; , ; born 12 March 1987) is an Azerbaijani chess grandmaster.

A former child prodigy, he earned the title of Grandmaster in March 2001 at age 14, the second-youngest grandmaster in history at the time. In 2003, Radjabov gained international attention after beating the then-world No. 1 Garry Kasparov in the Linares tournament, followed by victories over former world champions Viswanathan Anand and Ruslan Ponomariov the same year. Radjabov continued his progress over the years to become an elite chess player. In November 2012, he achieved his peak rating of 2793 and was ranked as number 4 in the world. This made Radjabov the nineteenth-highest rated player in chess history.

He has thrice competed at the Candidates Tournament, in 2011, 2013, and 2022 (where he obtained third place); he also qualified for the 2020 edition but withdrew due to the coronavirus pandemic. He won the European Team Chess Championship with Azerbaijan in 2009, 2013, and 2017. His major individual achievements include joint first place in the 2007 Corus tournament, winning the 2008 Elista Grand Prix, 2017 Geneva Grand Prix, 2019 FIDE World Cup, and 2021 Airthings Masters.

==Early life==
Radjabov was born on 12 March 1987 in Baku, Azerbaijan SSR (now Azerbaijan), to Boris Sheynin, a Jewish petroleum engineer who attended the same chess school in Baku as Garry Kasparov, and Leyla Radjabova, an Azerbaijani English languages teacher. Radjabov started playing chess at age three and attended secondary school number 160 in Baku. He was coached by his father.

==Career==
Despite being the youngest of the participants, Radjabov in 1999 won the European Under 18 Championship, with the six years older Evgeny Postny in second place. While still 13 years old, the 2483-rated Radjabov finished in second place in the 2001 tournament Wijk aan Zee B, scoring +6−2=3. Mikhail Gurevich (2694) in first place was ½ point ahead and the player to qualify for next year&#x27;s Wijk aan Zee A. Radjabov became the second-youngest player, after Judit Polgar, to make it into the FIDE Top 100 players list. With a rating of 2599 in January 2002, he was ranked 93rd in the world while still 14 years old. In the FIDE Moscow Grand Prix rapid event in June, he won matches against Ivanchuk, Svidler, Beliavsky, and Akopian before losing the final to Kasparov ½–1½.

In 2003, Radjabov defeated Garry Kasparov, Viswanathan Anand, and Ruslan Ponomariov with the black pieces, making him the first player to beat three former and reigning FIDE World Chess Champions with black in one year. Hikaru Nakamura repeated the feat in 2011 by beating Ponomariov, Anand, and Vladimir Kramnik. Radjabov&#x27;s win against Ponomariov came in Wijk aan Zee, where Radjabov scored +3−3=7, while the one against Anand came in Dortmund, where he scored +2−2=6. The win against Kasparov in Linares was Radjabov&#x27;s only win in the tournament, where he ended up with a +1−4=7 score. Kasparov had been undefeated in five consecutive Linares tournaments before losing to Radjabov. He had not lost a rated game with white in seven years, and never lost one again. In an interview in 2005, Radjabov claimed that Kasparov used his influence to prevent him from being invited to top tournaments after he defeated him at Linares 2003.

Radjabov participated in 2004 Linares, where he scored +2−2=8 and shared fourth place with Veselin Topalov, one point behind winner Vladimir Kramnik, after drawing both his games against Garry Kasparov. He also reached the semifinals (earning a bronze medal) at the FIDE World Chess Championship 2004.

===Early wins===
Radjabov won Dos Hermanas in April 2005, ahead of, among others, Dreev and Azmaiparashvili. Later in the year, he finished second in the European Championship, behind Nisipeanu but with Karjakin, Ivanchuk, and Aronian in third to fifth place.

On February 22, 2006, Radjabov defeated FIDE World Champion Veselin Topalov (2801) with the black pieces and subsequently finished second in Linares/Morelia after scoring +4−2=8 in the tournament. In November that year Radjabov won the strong Cap d&#x27;Agde rapid tournament. He won all his games in quarterfinal and semifinal against Volokitin and Bacrot, and won the final against Sergey Karjakin (who had eliminated Magnus Carlsen in his semifinal) 1½–½. In December, during the Creativity Festival in Florence (Tuscany, Italy), Radjabov lost a rapid game against Deep Junior, the chess engine that won the Turin World Computer Chess Championship.

In January 2007, Radjabov shared first place at the Category 19 Corus Chess Tournament in Wijk aan Zee with Veselin Topalov and Levon Aronian, ahead of Kramnik and Anand. He scored five wins, one loss and seven draws. Radjabov was also to play the Morelia/Linares Tournament 2007, but due to a robbery of some of his belongings in Mexico, he withdrew from the tournament. His position was taken by Vassily Ivanchuk.
In January 2008, Radjabov won the ACP Rapid Cup in Odessa after beating Grischuk in the final 2½–1½. Later the same month he shared third in Wijk aan Zee together with World Champion Viswanathan Anand after beating him with white, finishing ½ from first (+3−1=9). Radjabov had an average Linares (+2−2=8), and a disappointing Baku (+2−3=8), but finished third in Sofia (+2−1=7), behind Ivanchuk and Topalov. In Sochi in August he finished second (+5−2=6) behind Aronian, and capped a very active tournament year by sharing first in Elista (+4−1=8).

In Wijk aan Zee Radjabov shared second place with Aronian and Sergei Movsesian, ½ behind winner Sergey Karjakin. He finished fifth on tiebreak in Linares after scoring his only win in the tournament against Aronian, and was undefeated in Bazna in June, even if he only won once, against Gata Kamsky. In October Radjabov led the Azerbaijani team to victory at the European Team Chess Championship in Novi Sad.

===Early 2010s===
In May Radjabov shared second place in Astrakhan, securing second place in the FIDE Grand Prix 2008–2010, thereby qualifying for the Candidates tournament for the World Chess Championship 2012. In Bazna the following month Radjabov shared second place with Boris Gelfand after beating him in both their individual games (Carlsen won the tournament). Radjabov finished in second place also in the World Blitz Championship, with 24/38. Aronian won with 24½ while Carlsen was third with 23½. In his 2011 Candidates quarterfinal in Kazan, Radjabov was eliminated by Vladimir Kramnik in the blitz tiebreak, after a controversial incident of chess clock malfunction.

Radjabov got married on October 7 after a spectacular performance rating of 3019 in the European Chess Cup Championships playing first board for the team SOCAR, with the team coming second overall. Later the same month, Radjabov led the Azerbaijani team to silver medal at the European Team Chess Championship in Porto Carras. In November, he reached a new peak rating of 2781.
In January, Radjabov competed in the Tata Steel Chess Tournament in Wijk aan Zee; the field included among others, world No. 1 Magnus Carlsen and world No. 2 Levon Aronian. The average rating of the field was 2755, making this thirteen-round event a category 21 tournament. Radjabov scored +3−0=10 and tied for second place with Magnus Carlsen and Fabiano Caruana, a point behind winner Levon Aronian. It was his fourth consecutive top three finishes in Wijk. In the even stronger Tal Memorial (category 22 with an average rating of 2776) he shared second place again (+2−1=6), behind winner Carlsen, and reached a new peak rating and ranking as No. 4 with 2788 on the July list. Radjabov also competed as first board in the 2012 Olympiad in Istanbul Turkey 2012, and as a result pushed his rating from 2788 to his personal all-time high of 2793, and received second-highest performance on the first board. On October 17th, Radjabov led the SOCAR chess team to a win in the European Chess Club Cup by playing on the first board, and again received the second-highest performance on his board.

Radjabov played in the 2013 Candidates Tournament, which took place in London, from 15 March to 1 April. He finished last, with +1−7=6.

Radjabov&#x27;s national team won at the European Team Chess Championship in November 2013 in Warsaw, Poland. Radjabov scored 4½/8 (+1−0=7) in the tournament.

===Return to top chess===
Radjabov returned to top chess at the inaugural Gashimov Memorial, also known as Shamkir Chess, commemorating the late Azeri grandmaster. Radjabov scored 5/10 and placed third behind Carlsen and Caruana, picking up 11 rating points. He defeated Magnus Carlsen in their individual game. Radjabov participated in the Tata Steel Chess Tournament and placed eighth out of 14 with 6/13 points. In the same year, he won the bronze medal at the World Rapid Chess Championship behind Carlsen and Ian Nepomniachtchi. In 2016, Radjabov played in numerous tournaments such as the Gashimov Memorial, European Club Cup, World Blitz and Rapid Championship and Chess Olympiad without winning any tournaments. In April, Radjabov competed in the annual Shamkir Chess tournament and finished 8th out of 10 players.

Radjabov competed in the FIDE Grand Prix 2017. He placed fourth out of 18 in the Moscow round in May. In July, Radjabov won clear first in the Geneva round by scoring 6/9 points. In the final of his three tournaments, he scored 5/9 points. This put Radjabov third in the overall Grand Prix ranking, meaning he narrowly missed qualifying for the 2018 Candidates Tournament; with an extra 1/2 point in the final tournament he would have finished in the Grand Prix top two, and qualified.

In the September 2017 ranking of FIDE, Radjabov was ranked as no. 19 in the world. This was the first time since October 2015 when Radjabov was able to enter the top 20 in the list. The following month, he climbed to no. 17, his highest ranking in more than four years. In November, Radjabov won the gold medals at the European Team Chess Championship with the Azerbaijan national team and earned an individual silver medal on the second board. In April 2018, Radjabov participated in the fifth edition of Shamkir Chess, finishing seventh with a score of 4½/9 (+0–0=9). He gained three rating points and reached #16 in the May FIDE world rankings, his highest ranking in more than 5 years. In the 43rd Chess Olympiad in Batumi, Radjabov played for Azerbaijan and scored +6−0=4 with a notable victory over Wesley So. Team Azerbaijan completed the tournament as #15 while Radjabov earned an individual bronze medal on board 2. He also earned six rating points and moved to #14 in the world rankings.
In January 2019, Radjabov returned to Tata Steel Chess Tournament and placed seventh by earning 6.5 points (+1−1=11). In April, Radjabov played in Shamkir Chess for the fifth time. He also continued his rally in the world rankings and reached #12. In May, Teimour played in the Moscow round of 2019 FIDE Grand Prix, and was eliminated from the Moscow Grand Prix tournament in the first round on tie-breaks by American grandmaster Hikaru Nakamura. During the Hamburg round in November, Radjabov was eliminated by Daniil Dubov in the first round tie-breaks. In December, Radjabov missed the Jerusalem round for health reasons.

In July, Teimour played in Dortmund Sparkassen Chess Meeting and placed joint second-fifth places with four points (+1−0=6). In September, Radjabov participated in and won the 2019 Chess World Cup in Khanty-Mansiysk. After eliminating Ziska, Sjugirov and Yuffa in the first three rounds, Radjabov faced fellow Azerbaijani grandmaster Shakhriyar Mamedyarov in round 4 and defeated him in the tie-break series. Radjabov then beat American grandmaster Jeffery Xiong in the quarterfinal, 1.5 to 0.5. In the semifinal, Radjabov defeated French grandmaster Maxime Vachier-Lagrave. The final took place on 4 October 2019, in which he drew against Ding Liren in the classical games (+1-1=2); in the tie-breaks, he drew the four games in the rapid section, then defeated him in the blitz section (+2-0=0).

As a result of reaching the final in the World Cup, Radjabov qualified for the 2020 Candidates tournament where he could have earned the right to play Magnus Carlsen in the World Chess Championship.

===Withdrawal from Candidates===
Citing concerns about the coronavirus pandemic and what he considered FIDE&#x27;s inadequate attempts to deal with it, Radjabov withdrew from the 2020 Candidates tournament on March 6, 2020. He was replaced by Maxime Vachier-Lagrave.

On March 26, the tournament was abruptly postponed as a result of new governmental policies aimed at containing the pandemic. This development prompted Radjabov to call for his reinstatement in the tournament. In an interview with Daniel Rensch and Robert Hess, he stated:

&quot;I think FIDE should take some action to include me back into the tournament, that&#x27;s what I think. I think it&#x27;s a fair decision. From my side, I think I have done everything possible. I just asked them, warned them, I also warned the chess community by expressing it openly. (...)&quot;. Members of the Azerbaijani national chess team signed an open letter in support of his reinstatement.

In November 2020, Radjabov participated in the Skilling Open rapid chess tournament, which was the first tournament as part of Champions Chess Tour 2021. Radjabov qualified to the quarterfinals by earning eight points in 15 games, and was eliminated by Wesley So. In December, Radjabov joined Airthings Masters, the second tournament of the Champions Chess Tour. Radjabov placed fifth among 12 players in the preliminary round by performing +1-0=10, and qualified to the play-offs. In the quarter-finals, he defeated Ian Nepomniachtchi on the Armageddon round after drawing all of their games. In the semifinals, Radjabov defeated Russian grandmaster Daniil Dubov, who had upset then-world chess champion and tournament favorite Magnus Carlsen in the quarter-finals. In the finals he defeated Levon Aronian in two sets, and was declared the winner of the Airthings Masters.

In May 2021, FIDE decided to give Radjabov direct entry into the Candidates Tournament 2022, where he obtained third place.

==Playing style==

Radjabov is almost single-handedly responsible for the current revival of the King&#x27;s Indian Defence. He even beat world No. 1, Magnus Carlsen, with this defense in 2014 at the Gashimov Memorial 2014. He is also the only top player to consistently employ the sharp Schliemann-Jaenisch Gambit in the Ruy Lopez, scoring +1−0=10 with it in top tournaments 2008–2011, drawing among others Carlsen, Anand, Topalov, Svidler, Ivanchuk and Karjakin, and beating Adams. Radjabov has been called an excellent counter-attacker, adept at seizing control after an opponent makes a minor mistake.

At the 2003 Linares chess tournament, Radjabov, who was 15 years old, defeated Kasparov with the black pieces. Radjabov had a bad position (diagram), but played a courageous piece sacrifice that disconcerted Kasparov. Faced suddenly with an unbalanced position that required calm defense, Kasparov blundered with 27. Rdf1??, losing a piece and the game. 

The game was controversially voted the most beautiful game of the tournament. Proponents praised Radjabov&#x27;s resiliency and courage against the reigning world No. 1; detractors argued that Radjabov was losing, and it was only because Kasparov blundered that he won the game. Radjabov&#x27;s knight sacrifice, 21...Ngxe5, was praised by several strong players for its bravery, including English grandmaster Nigel Short: Radjabov plays very imaginatively... he just won&#x27;t give up, he is extremely tenacious and will always find a way to muddy the waters to throw you off track. He is very good at finding disconcerting moves. Here he unbalances Kasparov completely, disturbing his rhythm of play... That was the point of Radjabov&#x27;s sacrifice – it was not sound but it gave him these practical chances. However, the sacrifice was called &quot;desperation&quot; by GM Miguel Illescas, and according to Chessbase.com, &quot;The Grandmasters we have talked to praised Radjabov&#x27;s resilience in a bad position but criticized the game as unworthy of a prize because it was based on blunders.&quot;

Radjabov became the first player born since Kasparov first became World Chess Champion in 1985, to defeat him. Radjabov is also the youngest player in history to defeat a reigning world No. 1 in a game at tournament time controls.

==UNICEF==
In May 2006, Radjabov was appointed as the UNICEF National Goodwill Ambassador for Azerbaijan. He advocates for the cause of the universal salt iodization in the country. UNICEF Representative in Azerbaijan Hanaa Singer stated that they were very pleased to have Radjabov in the work to improve the lives of children and young people in Azerbaijan. They were confident that Radjabov would become an outspoken and active advocate for the cause, using his great talents to inspire young people.

<text>Georgina McKee (born 14 April 1964) is an English actress. She won the 1997 BAFTA TV Award for Best Actress for &quot;Our Friends in the North&quot; (1996), and earned subsequent nominations for &quot;The Lost Prince&quot; (2003) and &quot;The Street&quot; (2007). She also starred on television in &quot;The Forsyte Saga&quot; (2002) and as Caterina Sforza in &quot;The Borgias&quot; (2011). Her film appearances include &quot;Notting Hill&quot; (1999), &quot;Phantom Thread&quot; (2017), and &quot;My Policeman&quot; (2022). On the stage, she has twice been nominated for the Laurence Olivier Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role for &quot;King Lear&quot; in 2011 and &quot;Dear England&quot; in 2024.

==Early life==
McKee was born in Peterlee, County Durham, in 1964, the daughter of a coal miner, and grew up there and in nearby Easington and Sunderland. Her first experience of acting occurred in her final year at primary school where her teacher finished the school week off with improvisations. Seeing a poster in a shoe-shop window for a new youth drama group, McKee and her friends decided to attend, initially not seriously but later becoming enthusiastic. It led to McKee&#x27;s first professional appearance, working on Tyne Tees children&#x27;s series, &quot;Quest of Eagles&quot;.

From the age of 15, McKee spent three summers in London with the National Youth Theatre. After completing her A-Levels at East Durham College, she decided, with her parents&#x27; blessing, to apply to drama schools rather than art colleges. However, she was rejected by Bristol Old Vic Theatre School, London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art and the Central School of Speech and Drama.

==Career==
McKee began her career in TV with several background roles including a part on &quot;The Lenny Henry Show&quot;. She made her film debut in 1988 when she had a small role in &quot;The Lair of the White Worm&quot;. In 1996, she played Mary in the BBC drama &quot;Our Friends in the North&quot;, a role for which she won three Best Actress awards in 1997: the British Academy Television Award, the Royal Television Society Award and the Broadcasting Press Guild Award. McKee appeared in several episodes of the Chris Morris spoof current affairs show, &quot;Brass Eye&quot; (1997, 2001), as reporter Libby Shuss.

McKee&#x27;s theatre credits include Harold Pinter&#x27;s &quot;The Lover&quot; and &quot;The Collection&quot; at the Comedy Theatre in London. In 2008, she appeared in the BBC drama &quot;Fiona&#x27;s Story&quot; and a West End revival of Chekhov&#x27;s &quot;Ivanov&quot;. In 2010, she appeared as Goneril in the Donmar Warehouse revival of &quot;King Lear&quot;, directed by Michael Grandage and starring Derek Jacobi. She received an Olivier Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress for her performance.

She played the mother of a deaf teenager in BBC TV&#x27;s thriller, &quot;The Silence&quot;, opposite Genevieve Barr. In 2018, she appeared in the highly successful BBC/Netflix drama series &quot;Bodyguard&quot; as Commander Anne Sampson.

==Personal life==
McKee has been married to Kez Cary since 1989; they live in East Sussex, England. She has been a vegetarian since 1982.

In 2002, McKee received an Honorary Doctorate of Arts from the University of Sunderland.

<doc id="462173" wikidata="Q2915859" url="?curid=462173" title="Fettuccine Alfredo">
<text>Fettuccine Alfredo () is a pasta dish consisting of fettuccine tossed with butter and Parmesan cheese, which melt and emulsify to form a rich cheese sauce coating the pasta. Originating in Rome in the early 20th century, the recipe is now popular in the United States and other countries. Outside of Italy, cream is sometimes used to thicken the sauce, and ingredients such as chicken, shrimp, salmon or broccoli may also be added when it is served as a main course.

The dish is named after Alfredo Di Lelio, a Roman restaurateur who is credited with its invention and popularisation. Di Lelio&#x27;s tableside service was an integral part of the recipe&#x27;s success. Fettuccine Alfredo is a variant of standard Italian &quot;fettuccine al burro&quot; () or &quot;pasta burro e parmigiano&quot; (). It is a kind of &quot;pasta in bianco&quot;, that is, without added sauce. Italian recipes do not include cream and are not topped with other ingredients, nor is the dish generally called &quot;Alfredo&quot; in Italy.

==History==

===Italian origins===
In Italy, the combination of pasta with butter and cheese dates to at least the 15th century, when it was mentioned by Martino da Como, a northern Italian cook active in Rome; this recipe for &quot;Roman macaroni&quot; () calls for cooking pasta in broth or water and adding butter, &quot;good cheese&quot; (the variety is not specified) and &quot;sweet spices&quot;.

===Roman creation===
Modern fettuccine Alfredo was created by Alfredo Di Lelio in Rome in the early 20th century. According to family lore, in 1892 Alfredo began to work in a restaurant located in Piazza Rosa that was run by his mother Angelina. He cooked his first &quot;fettuccine al triplo burro&quot; (—later called &quot;fettuccine all&#x27;Alfredo&quot;, and eventually fettuccine Alfredo) in 1907 or 1908, in what is said to have been an effort to entice his convalescent wife, Ines, to eat after giving birth to their first child Armando. Recipes attributed to Di Lelio include only three ingredients: fettuccine, &quot;young&quot; Parmesan cheese and butter. Yet there are various legends about the &quot;secret&quot; of the original Alfredo recipe: some say oil is added to the pasta dough; others that the pasta is cooked in milk.

Piazza Rosa was condemned to make way for the construction of the Galleria Colonna () and the restaurant was forced to close, after which, Di Lelio opened his own restaurant called &quot;Alfredo&quot; on the via della Scrofa (). Following a visit from the American actors Mary Pickford and Douglas Fairbanks (who was known as &quot;The King of Hollywood&quot;) in the early 1920s, Alfredo began to serve his signature dish using a golden fork and spoon bearing the inscription &quot;To Alfredo the King of the noodles&quot; (said to have been a gift from the famous Hollywood couple in gratitude for Alfredo&#x27;s hospitality). Di Lelio&#x27;s fame and success grew (he was knighted by the King of Italy, making him a &quot;Cavaliere dell&#x27;Ordine della Corona d&#x27;Italia&quot;) until war rationing made it increasingly difficult to obtain flour, eggs, and butter. He sold the restaurant to two of his waiters in 1943 and retired.

After the war, in 1950, Di Lelio opened a new restaurant in Piazza Augusto Imperatore with his son Armando. He vigorously promoted the restaurant by creating a celebrity wall of fettuccine themed photographs showing himself (in humorous poses, with his pasta and gold cutlery) serving dignitaries, politicians, famous musicians and film stars such as James Stewart, Bob Hope, Anthony Quinn, Bing Crosby, Gary Cooper, Jack Lemmon, Ava Gardner, Tyrone Power, Sophia Loren, Cantinflas, and many others. The dish was so well known that Di Lelio was invited to demonstrate it both in Italy and abroad. The fame of the dish, by this time called &quot;maestosissime fettuccine all&#x27;Alfredo&quot; () on Alfredo&#x27;s menus, was heightened by the tableside &quot;spectacle reminiscent of grand opera&quot; during its preparation, &quot;in a ritual of extraordinary theatricality&quot;. 
Both the original restaurant (now called Alfredo alla Scrofa), and the post-war iteration (known as Il vero Alfredo and still run by the Di Lelio family) serve &quot;fettuccine Alfredo&quot; and compete vigorously, with escalating puffery (e.g., &quot;the king of fettuccine&quot;, &quot;the real king of fettuccine&quot;, &quot;the magician of fettuccine&quot;, &quot;the emperor of fettuccine&quot;, &quot;the real Alfredo&quot;, etc.). In 1981, there were about 50 restaurants in Rome selling similar fettuccine dishes, mostly called &quot;fettuccine alla romana&quot;.

Fettuccine Alfredo, minus the spectacle, has now become ubiquitous in Italian-style restaurants outside Italy, although despite its worldwide renown, in Italy this dish is usually still called simply &quot;fettuccine al burro&quot;.

===American popularization===
The dish has long been popular with Americans, who, when in Rome, have often sought out its historical origins.
Alfredo&#x27;s noodles have been extolled in US newspapers, magazines, cookbooks and guidebooks since as early as the 1920s. In one of her popular travel guides, &quot;So You&#x27;re Going to Rome!&quot;, Clara Laughlin writes, &quot;Most travellers would blush to admit they had been in Rome and had not eaten Alfredo&#x27;s &quot;fettuccine al burro&quot;.&quot; Sinclair Lewis&#x27;s 1922 novel &quot;Babbitt&quot; makes reference to &quot;a little trattoria on the Via della Scrofa where you get the best fettuccine in the world&quot;.

In the late 1920s and early 1930s, the American food writer and restaurateur George Rector wrote about &quot;Alfredo&#x27;s noodles&quot;, describing in detail the restaurateur&#x27;s elaborate tableside preparation ceremony; he did not give the dish a specific name. In a later account, Rector mentions the addition of accompanying violin music and golden tableware. By the 1920s Alfredo was billing himself as &quot;Il Re delle Fettuccine&quot; (printed on his menus in both Italian and English), although when exactly the &quot;fettuccine Alfredo&quot; appellation came about is unclear. A 1925 Italian guidebook and its English translation uses &quot;fettuccine al burro&quot;; however, a 1927 article by Alice Rohe mentions &quot;noodles Alfredo&quot;. Throughout this period and beyond, restaurant reviews, advertisements, and recipes for &quot;noodles Alfredo&quot; (1927 and 1929), &quot;Alfredo&#x27;s spaghetti&quot; (1939), &quot;fettuccine all&#x27;Alfredo&quot; (1956), and eventually &quot;fettuccine Alfredo&quot; (1957 and 1964) began to crop up in various publications.

In 1966, the Pennsylvania Dutch Noodle Company started selling their dried &quot;fettuccine egg noodles&quot; with an &quot;Alfredo&quot; recipe on the package. In addition to the traditional Parmesan cheese and butter, this version also included Swiss cheese and cream.

In 1977, Armando Di Lelio (Alfredo&#x27;s son) and a partner opened a restaurant called &quot;Alfredo&#x27;s&quot; near Rockefeller Center in New York, and several years later, another in Epcot at Disney World—both of which have since closed. More recently, Ines Di Lelio (Alfredo&#x27;s granddaughter) has operated or licenced the &quot;Il Vero Alfredo&quot; name to restaurants in Mexico and Saudi Arabia.

The two largest full-service Italian-American restaurant chains, Olive Garden and Carrabba&#x27;s Italian Grill, both serve and advertise the dish widely. A smaller chain, Il Fornaio, which says that its goal is, to &quot;provide our guests with the most authentic Italian experience outside of Italy&quot;, does not serve fettuccine Alfredo.

Some American food writers recommend that home cooks follow Di Lelio&#x27;s three ingredient formula. Writing in &quot;Bon Appétit&quot;, the Italian-American chef Carla Lalli Music notes that &quot;American cooks added heavy cream or half-and-half to thicken and enrich the sauce. To each their own, but no authentic fettuccine Alfredo recipe should include cream (because it dulls the flavor of the cheese).&quot;

The dish has its enthusiasts and its detractors. In 2018, the restaurant critic Pete Wells said of one version, &quot;The Alfredo sauce, sweetly dripping from the fettuccine like rain from a leaf, hit me like a prescription opiate that had been specifically engineered for my opiate receptors. It&#x27;s been a long time since I&#x27;d had fettuccine Alfredo&quot;; In 1981, the travel writer Paul Hoffman called the Roman versions &quot;one of the most tempting and at the same time simplest pasta specialties&quot;. On the other hand, the food writer Gillian Riley says that the fettuccine of Rome &quot;hardly need Alfredo&#x27;s gross sauce of butter, cream [sic], and cheese&quot;.

The American nutrition advocate Michael Jacobson described fettuccine Alfredo as a &quot;heart attack on a plate&quot;.

==Alfredo sauce==

In the United States, shelf-stable Alfredo sauce is sold by brands such as Ragú, Trader Joe&#x27;s, Whole Foods Market, Bertolli, Kroger, Classico, Prego, Rao&#x27;s, Newman&#x27;s Own, Signature Select, and Saclà in glass jars for home cooks. Giovanni Rana and Buitoni sell fresh Alfredo sauces in plastic tubs that must be refrigerated. The Alaska Seasoning Company makes &quot;Alfredo sauce powder&quot;, a spice mix to which, according to the company, one &quot;simply [adds] cream [to] make a restaurant style Alfredo Sauce&quot;. These sauces are marketed at various price points and quality levels, and are often reviewed in food related publications.

The British retailer ASDA sells a version called &quot;New York creamy chicken Alfredo sauce&quot;.

Other Alfredo variants and formats such as pre-packaged fresh, boil-in-bag, or frozen meals are also widely available in the United States. In the late 1970s, McDonald&#x27;s experimented with a dinner menu that included fettuccine Alfredo, pizza, lasagna, and McSpaghetti. These options are no longer available in America.

In Italy, Alfredo alla Scrofa began offering its own version of &quot;salsa Alfredo&quot; in 2020. Sold in glass jars and promoted as using only the highest quality ingredients, the sauce contains Parmesan (43%), water, butter, rice flour, and sunflower seed oil—but no cream.

<text>Telegard is an early bulletin board system (BBS) software program written for IBM PC-compatible computers running MS-DOS and OS/2. Telegard was written in Pascal with routines written in C++ and assembly language, based on a copy of the WWIV source code.

Telegard has several features that make it attractive to BBS sysops, such as being free, having remote administration facilities built into the main program, and the ability to handle CD-ROMs internally. Telegard is still viable today as it can accept telnet connections by using a virtual modem/FOSSIL set up such as NetSerial, a virtual modem driver, and NetFoss, a freeware FOSSIL driver, both for Windows.

<text>In agriculture, polyculture is the practice of growing more than one crop species together in the same place at the same time, in contrast to monoculture, which had become the dominant approach in developed countries by 1950. Traditional examples include the intercropping of the Three Sisters, namely maize, beans, and squashes, by indigenous peoples of Central and North America, the rice-fish systems of Asia, and the complex mixed cropping systems of Nigeria. 

Polyculture offers multiple advantages, including increasing total yield, as multiple crops can be harvested from the same land, along with reduced risk of crop failure. Resources are used more efficiently, requiring less inputs of fertilizers and pesticides, as interplanted crops suppress weeds, and legumes can fix nitrogen. The increased diversity tends to reduce losses from pests and diseases. Polyculture can yield multiple harvests per year, and can improve the physical, chemical and structural properties of soil, for example as taproots create pores for water and air. Improved soil cover reduces soil drying and erosion. Further, increased diversity of crops can provide people with a healthier diet. 

Disadvantages include the skill required to manage polycultures; it can be difficult to mechanize when crops have differing needs for sowing depths, spacings, and times, may need different fertilizers and pesticides, and may be hard to harvest and to separate the crops. Finding suitable plant combinations may be challenging. Competition between species may reduce yields. 

Annual polycultures include intercropping, where two or more crops are grown alongside each other; in horticulture, this is called companion planting. A variant is strip cropping where multiple rows of a crop form a strip, beside a strip of another crop. A cover crop involves planting a species that is not a crop, such as grasses and legumes, alongside the crop. The cover plants help reduce soil erosion, suppress weeds, retain water, and fix nitrogen. A living mulch, mainly used in horticulture, involves a second crop used to suppress weeds; a popular choice is marigold, as this has cash value and produces chemicals that repel pests. In mixed cropping, all the seeds are sown together, mimicking natural plant diversity; harvesting is simple, with all the crops being put to the same use.

Perennial polycultures can involve perennial varieties of annual crops, as with rice, sorghum, and pigeon pea; they can be grown alongside legumes such as alfalfa. Rice polycultures often involve animal crops such as fish and ducks. In agroforestry, some of the crops are trees; for example, coffee, which is shade-loving, is traditionally grown under shade trees. The rice-fish systems of Asia produce freshwater fish as well as rice, yielding a valuable extra crop; in Indonesia, a combination of rice, fish, ducks, and water fern produces a resilient and productive permaculture system.

== Definitions ==

Polyculture is the growing of multiple crops together in the same place at the same time. It has traditionally been the most prevalent form of agriculture. Regions where polycultures form a substantial part of agriculture include the Himalayas, Eastern Asia, South America, and Africa. Other names for the practice include mixed cropping and intercropping. It may be contrasted with monoculture where one crop is grown in a field at a time. Both polycultures and monocultures may be subject to crop rotations or other changes with time (table).

== Historical and modern uses ==

=== Americas: the Three Sisters ===

A well-known traditional example is the intercropping of maize, beans, and squash plants in the group called &quot;the Three Sisters&quot;. In this combination, the maize provides a structure for the bean to grow on, the bean provides nitrogen for all of the plants, while the squash suppresses weeds on the ground. This crop mixture can be traced back some 3,000 years to civilizations in Mesoamerica. It illustrates how species in polycultures can sustain each other and minimize the need for human intervention. The majority of Latin American farmers continue to intercrop their maize, beans, and squash.

=== Asia: terrestrial and aquatic ===

In China, cereals have been intercropped with other plants for 1,000 years; the practice continues in the 21st century on some 28 to 34 million hectares. Polycultures involving fish and plants, have similarly been common in Eastern Asia for many centuries. In China, Japan, and Indonesia, traditional rice polycultures include rice-fish, rice-duck, and rice-fish-duck; modern aquaculture systems in the same region include shrimp and other shellfish grown in rice paddies.

=== Africa: cowpeas and complex mixed cropping ===

In Africa, polyculture has been practised for many centuries. This often involves legumes, especially the cowpea, alongside other crop plants. In Nigeria, complex mixed cropping can involve as many as 13 crops, with rice grown in between mounds holding cassava, cowpea, maize, peanut, pumpkin, &quot;Lagenaria&quot;, pigeon pea, melon, and a selection of yam species. 

=== Impact of development ===

The introduction of pesticides, herbicides, and fertilizers made monoculture the predominant form of agriculture in developed countries from the 1950s. The prevalence of polycultures declined greatly in popularity at that time in more economically developed countries where it was deemed to yield less while requiring more labor. Polyculture farming has not disappeared entirely, and traditional polyculture systems continue to be an essential part of the food production system, especially in developing countries. Around 15% to 20% of the world&#x27;s agriculture is estimated to rely on traditional polyculture systems. Due to climate change, polycultures are regaining popularity in more-developed countries as food producers seek to reduce their environmental and health impacts.

== Advantages ==

Polycultures can benefit from multiple agroecological effects. Its principal advantages, according to Adamczewska-Sowińska and Sowiński 2020, are:

* Diverse crops provide increased total yield, increased stability, and reduced risk of crop failure.
* More efficient resource usage, including of soil minerals, nitrogen fixing, land, and labour.
* Reduced inputs of fertilizers and pesticides.
* Intercrops suppress weeds.
* Reduced losses from pests, diseases, and weeds.
* Multiple harvests per year are possible.
* Physical, chemical, and structural properties of soil are improved, e.g. with combination of taproot and fibrous-rooted crops.
* Improved soil cover reduces soil drying and erosion.
* Better nutrition for people with varied crops.

=== Efficiency ===

A polyculture makes more efficient use of resources and produces more biomass overall than a monoculture. This is because of synergies between crops, and the creation of ecological niches for other organisms. However, the yield of each crop inside the polyculture is lower, not least because only part of the land area of the field is available to it. 

Interactions between crops are complex, but mainly competitive, as each species struggles to obtain room to grow, sunlight, water, and soil nutrients. Many plants exude substances from their roots and other parts that inhibit other plants (allelopathy); some however are beneficial to other plants. Other interactions are beneficial, providing complementarity (as with the provision of nitrogen by legumes to other plants) or facilitation. Interactions vary widely by pairs of species; many recommendations have been made for suitable and unsuitable companion plants. For example, maize is well accompanied by amaranth, legumes, squashes, and sunflower, but not by cabbage, celery, or tomato. Cabbage, on the other hand, is well accompanied by beans, carrot, celery, marigold, and tomato, but not by onion or potato.

=== Improving the soil ===

Polycultures can benefit the soil by improving its fertility, its structure, and its biological activity. Soil fertility depends both on inorganic nutrients and on organic matter or humus. Deep-rooted companion crops such as legumes can improve soil structure: when they decay, they leave pores in the soil, improving drainage and allowing air into the soil. Some such as white lupin help cereals like wheat to take up phosphorus, a nutrient that often limits crop growth. Polyculture benefits soil microorganisms; in some forms, such as living mulches, it may also encourage earthworms (which in turn benefit soil structure), most likely by increasing the amount of organic matter in the soil.

=== Sustainability ===

Polyculture can reduce the release of pesticides and artificial fertilizers into the environment. Environmental impacts such as eutrophication of fresh water are greatly reduced.

Tillage, which removes essential microbes and nutrients from the soil, can be avoided in some forms of polyculture, especially permaculture. Land is used more productively.

Polyculture increases local biodiversity. Increasing crop diversity can increase pollination in nearby environments, as diverse plants attract a broader array of pollinators. This is an example of reconciliation ecology, accommodating biodiversity within human landscapes, and may form part of a biological pest control program.

=== Weed management ===

Both the density and the diversity of crops affect weed growth in polycultures. Having a greater density of plants reduces the available water, sunlight, and nutrient concentrations in the environment. Such a reduction is heightened with greater crop diversity as more potential resources are fully utilized. This level of competition makes polycultures particularly inhospitable to weeds. When they do grow, weeds can help polycultures, assisting in pest management by attracting natural enemies of pests. Further, they can act as hosts to arthropods that are beneficial to other plants in the polyculture.

=== Pest management ===

Pests are less predominant in polycultures than monocultures due to crop diversity. The reduced concentration of a target species in a polyculture attracts fewer pests specific to that crop. These specialized pests often have more difficulty locating host plants in a polyculture. Pests with more generalized preferences spend less time on a polyculture crop, resulting in lower yield loss (associational resistance). Because polycultures mimic naturally diverse ecosystems, general pests are less likely to distinguish between polycultures and the surrounding environment, and may have a smaller presence in the polyculture. Natural enemies or predators of pests are often attracted to the diversity of plants in a polyculture, helping to suppress pest populations.

=== Disease control ===

Plant diseases are less predominant in polycultures than monocultures. The disease-diversity hypothesis states that a greater diversity of plants leads to a decreased severity of disease. Because different plants are susceptible to different diseases, if a disease negatively impacts one crop, it will not necessarily spread to another and so the overall impact on yield is contained. However, diseases and pests do not necessarily have a decreased effect on a specific crop. If targeted by a specialized pest or disease, a crop in a polyculture will likely experience the same yield loss as its monoculture counterpart.

=== Human health ===

Many of the crops consumed today are calorie-rich crops that can lead to illnesses such as obesity, hypertension, and type II diabetes. Because it encourages plant diversity, polycultures can help increase diet diversity and improve people&#x27;s nutrition by incorporating non-traditional foods into people&#x27;s diets.

== Disadvantages ==

=== Management ===

Polyculture&#x27;s principal disadvantages, according to Adamczewska-Sowińska and Sowiński 2020, are:

* Difficult to mechanize sowing and spraying of mixtures of crops which need different sowing depths, rates, and times, and different row spacings, as well as different fertilizers and pesticides, again at their own rates, times, and choice of substances. More manual labour may therefore be required.
* Difficult to harvest and separate crops.
* May not work well for cash crops and staple crops.
* May make herbicide use difficult, again suiting one crop but not another.
* Requires more management and farmer education.

=== Finding suitable combinations ===

The effects of competition can damage plants in certain polycultures. The diverse species chosen to grow together must have complementary needs. Due to the large number of cultivated plant species, finding and testing suitable combinations of plants is difficult; the alternative is to use an existing proven combination.

== Practices ==

The kinds of plants that are grown, their spatial distribution, and the time that they spend growing together determine the specific type of polyculture that is implemented. There is no limit to the types of plants or animals that can be grown together to form a polyculture. The time overlap between plants can be asymmetrical as well, with one plant depending on the other for longer than is reciprocated, often due to differences in life spans.

=== Annual ===

==== Intercropping ====

When two or more crops are grown in complete spatial and temporal overlap with each other, the approach is described in agriculture as intercropping, and in horticulture as companion planting. Intercropping is particularly useful in plots with limited land availability. Intercropping can be mixed, in rows, in multi-row strips, or in a relay with crops interplanted at different times.

Strip cropping involves growing different plants in alternating strips, often in rotation. These may be ploughed along the contours of a steep hillside, and are typically considerably wider than a single row of a cereal crop. While strip cropping does not involve the complete intermixing of plant species, it provides many of the same benefits such as reducing soil erosion and aiding with nutrient cycling.

Legumes are among of the most commonly intercropped crops, specifically legume-cereal mixtures. Legumes fix atmospheric nitrogen into the soil so that it is available for consumption by other plants in a process known as nitrogen fixation. The presence of legumes consequently eliminates the need for man-made nitrogen fertilizers in intercrops.

==== Cover cropping ====

When a crop is grown alongside another plant that is not a crop, the combination is a form of cover cropping. If the non-crop plant is a weed, the combination is called a weedy culture. Grasses and legumes are the most common cover crops. Cover crops are greatly beneficial as they can help prevent soil erosion, physically suppress weeds, improve surface water retention, and, in the case of legumes, provide nitrogen compounds as well. Single-species cover cropping, in rotation with cash crops, increases agroecosystem diversity; a cover crop polyculture further increases that diversity, and there is evidence, using a range of cover crop treatments with or without legumes, that this increases ecosystem functionality, in terms of weed suppression, nitrogen retention, and above-ground biomass.

==== Living mulches ====

A living mulch is a polyculture involving a second crop, used mainly in horticulture. A main crop is grown to harvest; a second crop is sown beneath it to cover the soil, reducing erosion, and to form a green manure. Living mulches have been popular under orchard trees, and beneath perennial vegetables such as asparagus and rhubarb. It is considered suitable also for annual crops which grow for a long period before harvest and where the harvest is late in the year, such as aubergine, cabbage, celery, leek, maize, peppers, and tomato. Marigolds have a special place among weed-suppressing living mulches as they produce thiophenes which repel pests such as nematodes, and provide a second cash crop.

Care is required to minimise competition between the living mulch crop and the main crop. Indirect methods include selecting sowing dates or applying water and fertilizer directly to the main crop, or by choosing fast-growing varieties for the main crop. Direct methods include mowing the living mulch to inhibit its root growth, or applying a sublethal amount of herbicide to the living mulch.

For arable use, cereals such as wheat and barley, or broadleaved crops like rapeseed, can grow with living mulches of clover, vetch, or other legumes. However, since the yield of the main crop is reduced, this approach is not widely adopted by cereal farmers. In particular, living mulches like clover compete with young seedlings of the main crop, and need to be suppressed appropriately.

==== Mixed cropping ====

Mixed cropping differs from intercropping in having all the seeds mixed and sown together. The result mimics natural plant diversity. Handling is simple, but there can be competition between the crops, and any pesticide or fertilizer applied goes on all the crops. Harvesting too is a single operation, all the crops then being put to the same use.

=== Perennial ===

==== Agroforestry ====

In many Latin American countries, a popular form of polyculture is agroforestry, where trees and crops are grown together. Trees provide shade for the crops alongside organic matter and nutrients when they shed their leaves or fruits. The elaborate root systems of trees also help prevent soil erosion and increase the presence of microbes in the soil. In addition to benefiting crops, trees act as commodities harvested for paper, medicine, timber, and firewood.

Coffee is a shade-loving crop, and is traditionally shade-grown. In India, it is often grown under a natural forest canopy, replacing the shrub layer. A different polyculture system is used for coffee in Mexico, where the &quot;Coffea&quot; bushes are grown under leguminous trees in the genus &quot;Inga&quot;.

==== Varieties of annual arable crops ====

Perennial crop varieties of traditional annual arable crops can increase sustainability. They require less tillage and often have longer roots, reducing soil erosion and tolerating drought. Such varieties are being developed for rice, wheat, sorghum, pigeon pea, barley, and sunflowers. These can be combined with a leguminous cover crop such as alfalfa to fix nitrogen, reducing fertilizer inputs.

==== Rice, fish, and duck systems ====

In South-East Asia and China, rice-fish systems on rice paddies have raised freshwater fish as well as rice, producing a valuable additional crop and reducing eutrophication of neighbouring rivers. 

Rice-duck farming is practised across tropical and subtropical Asia. A variant in Indonesia combines rice, fish, ducks and water fern for a resilient and productive permaculture system; the ducks eat the weeds that would otherwise limit rice growth, reducing labour and herbicides; the water fern fixes nitrogen; and the duck manure and fish manure reduce the need for fertilizer.

==== Integrated aquaculture ====

Integrated aquaculture is a form of aquaculture in which cultures of fish or shrimp are grown together with seaweed, shellfish, or micro-algae. Mono-species aquaculture poses problems for farmers and the environment. The harvesting of seaweed crops in mono-species aquaculture releases nitrates into the water and can lead to eutrophication. In seafood mono-species aquaculture, the greatest problem is the high cost of feed, more than half of which goes to waste, causing nitrogen release and eutrophication or algal blooms. Technological fixes such as bacterial bio-filters have proven costly. Integrated aquaculture uses plants both as food for the sea animals and for water filtration, absorbing nitrates and carbon dioxide. This reduces the need for chemical inputs. Plants such as seaweed grown alongside seafood have commercial value. Regenerative ocean farming sequesters carbon, growing a mix of seaweeds and shellfish for harvest, while helping to regenerate and restore local habitats like reef ecosystems.

<text>Augury was a Greco-Roman religious practice of observing the behavior of birds, to receive omens. When the individual, known as the augur, read these signs, it was referred to as &quot;taking the auspices&quot;. &quot;Auspices&quot; () means &quot;looking at birds&quot;. &quot;Auspex&quot;, another word for augur, can be translated to &quot;one who looks at birds&quot;. Depending upon the birds, the auspices from the gods could be favorable or unfavorable (&quot;&quot; or &quot;inauspicious&quot;). Sometimes politically motivated augurs would fabricate unfavorable auspices in order to delay certain state functions, such as elections. Pliny the Elder attributes the invention of auspicy to Tiresias the seer of Thebes.

This type of omen reading was already a millennium old in the time of Classical Greece: in the fourteenth-century BC diplomatic correspondence preserved in Egypt called the Amarna correspondence, the practice was familiar to the king of Alasia in Cyprus who needed an &quot;eagle diviner&quot; to be sent from Egypt. This earlier, indigenous practice of divining by bird signs, familiar in the figure of Calchas, the bird-diviner to Agamemnon, who led the army (&quot;Iliad&quot; I.69), was largely replaced by sacrifice-divination through inspection of the sacrificial victim&#x27;s liver—&quot;haruspices&quot;—during the Orientalizing period of archaic Greek culture. Plato notes that hepatoscopy held greater prestige than augury by means of birds.

One of the most famous auspices is the one which is connected with the founding of Rome. Once the founders of Rome, Romulus and Remus, arrived at the Palatine Hill, the two argued over where the exact position of the city should be. Romulus was set on building the city upon the Palatine, but Remus wanted to build the city on the strategic and easily fortified Aventine Hill. The two agreed to settle their argument by testing their abilities as augurs and by the will of the gods. Each took a seat on the ground apart from one another, and, according to Plutarch, Remus saw six vultures, after which Romulus saw twelve. The two clashed over whether the preference of the gods was indicated by Remus seeing vultures before Romulus did, or by Romulus seeing twelve vultures while Remus saw six. Vultures were pre-eminent in Roman augury, furnishing the strongest signs an augur could receive from a wild bird. They were subject to protective taboos and also called sacred birds.

==History==
According to unanimous testimony from ancient sources the use of auspices as a means to decipher the will of the gods was more ancient than Rome itself. The use of the word is usually associated with Latins as well as the earliest Roman citizens. Though some modern historians link the act of observing Auspices to the Etruscans, Cicero accounts in his text &quot;De Divinatione&quot; several differences between the auspicial of the Romans and the Etruscan system of interpreting the will of the gods. Cicero also mentions several other nations which, like the Romans, paid attention to the patterns of flying birds as signs of the gods&#x27; will but never mentions this practice while discussing the Etruscans.

Though auspices were prevalent before the Romans, Romans are often linked with auspices because of their connection to Rome&#x27;s foundation and because Romans established rules for the reading of auspices that helped keep it an essential part of Roman culture. Stoics, for instance, maintained that if there are gods, they care for men, and that if they care for men they must send them signs of their will. Even the Philistines practiced augury as far back as 740 BC and c. 686 BC as declared by Isaiah 2:6 in the Old Testament. Yet augury was first systematized by the Chaldeans according to the Jewish Encyclopedia.

==Position of the augur==

In ancient Rome, the appointment and inauguration of any magistrate, decisions made within the people&#x27;s assembly and the advancement of any campaign, always required a positive &quot;auspicium&quot;. During Octavian&#x27;s first consulship in 43 B.C.E., the positive &quot;auspicium&quot; corresponded to the spotting of twelve vultures, similar to Romulus. Unlike in Greece where oracles played the role of messenger of the gods, in Rome it was through birds that Jupiter&#x27;s will was interpreted. Auspices showed Romans what they were to do, or not to do; no explanation for the decision was given except that it was the will of the gods. It would be difficult to execute any public act without consulting the auspices.

It was believed that if an augur committed an error in the interpretation of the signs, or &quot;vitia&quot;, it was considered offensive to the gods and often was said to have disastrous effects unless corrected. Elections, the passing of laws, and initiation of wars were all put on hold until the people were assured the gods agreed with their actions. The men who interpreted these signs, revealing the will of the gods were called augurs. Similar to records of court precedents, augurs kept books containing records of past signs, the necessary rituals, prayers, and other resources to help other augurs, especially members of the ruling aristocracy, to understand the fundamentals of augury.

Although augurs had the power to interpret the signs, it was ultimately the responsibility of the magistrate to execute consequent decisions, or withhold or debate judgment as to future actions. The magistrates were also expected to understand the basic interpretations as they were often expected to take the auspices whenever they undertook any public business.

Until 300 BCE only patricians could become augurs. Plebeian assemblies were forbidden to take augury and hence had no input as to whether a certain law, war or festival should occur. Cicero, an augur himself, accounts how the monopoly of the patricians created a useful barrier to the encroachment of the &quot;populares&quot;. However, in 300 BCE a new law &quot;Lex Ogulnia&quot;, increased the number of augurs from four to nine and required that five of the nine be plebeians, for the first time granting the ability to interpret the will of the gods to lower classes. With this new power it was not only possible for plebeians to determine the gods&#x27; will in their favor but it was also now possible for plebeians to critique unfair interpretations by patricians.

==Types of auspices that include birds==

;ex avibus [&quot;from birds&quot;]: Though auspices were typically bird signs, not all birds in the sky were seen as symbols of the will of the gods. There were two classes of birds: Oscines, who gave auspices via their singing; and Alites, who gave auspices via how they flew. The Oscines included ravens, crows, owls and hens, each offering either a favorable omen (&quot;auspicium ratum&quot;) or an unfavorable depending on which side of the Augur&#x27;s designated area they appeared on. The birds of the Alites were the eagle, the vulture, the &quot;avis sanqualis&quot;, also called ossifraga, and the immussulus or immusculus. Some birds like the Picus Martius, the Feronius, and the Parrha could be considered among the oscines and the alites. Every movement and every sound made by these birds had a different meaning and interpretation according to the different circumstances, or times of the year when it was observed.

;ex tripudiīs [&quot;from the &quot;dance&quot; (of birds feeding)&quot;]: These auspices were read by interpreting the eating patterns of chickens, and were generally used on military expeditions. Cicero shows that at one point, any bird could perform the &quot;tripudium&quot; [sacred dance], but that as the practice progressed it soon began customary to use only chickens. The chickens were kept in a cage under the care of the &quot;pullarius&quot; (keeper of the chickens) who, when the time came, released the chickens and threw at them some form of bread or cake. If the chickens refused to come out or eat, or uttered a cry, or beat their wings, or flew away, the signs were considered unfavourable. Conversely, if the chicken left its cage to feast so that something fell from its mouth and landed on the ground, these signs were termed &quot;tripudium solistimum&quot; (or &quot;tripudium quasi terripavium solistimum&quot; [from &quot;solum&quot;, the ground], according to the ancient writers), and were considered to be a favourable sign. The chickens were often starved so that later the divination would be in accordance with the wishes of those interested.

the flight of birds

For the Romans, the high flight of birds (&quot;praepes&quot;) was an auspicious omen, the low flight was less happy (&quot;infera&quot;).

===Signs offered, requested or unsought===
There were two classifications of auspices; impetrative (&quot;impetrativa&quot;, sought or requested) and oblative (&quot;oblativa&quot;, unsought or offered). &quot;Impetrativa&quot; were signs given in response to the augur&#x27;s interpretation of the auspice. &quot;Oblativa&quot; were unexpected and unsought events which occurred either while the magistrate was either taking auspices, or while he debated their likely significance.

<doc id="462193" wikidata="Q7736003" url="?curid=462193" title="The Gaylords (American vocal group)">
<text>The Gaylords were an American singing trio, consisting of Ronald L. Fredianelli (June 12, 1930 – January 25, 2004), Bonaldo &quot;Burt&quot; Bonaldi (July 6, 1926 – May 10, 2017), and Don Rea (December 9, 1928 – June 30, 2017). Fredianelli joined the U. S. Army in the 1950s, and was replaced by Bill Christ (September 10, 1930 – October 30, 2017).

Fredianelli, Bonaldi and Rea were all born in Detroit, Michigan. Together they formed the Gaylords (originally The Gay Lords) in Detroit in 1949. The group&#x27;s name was decided upon after a chance encounter with Marcus Wren.

In the 1950s the group had a number of Italian-flavored hits on the Mercury Records label, often consisting of a song partly sung in Italian and partly in English. Their most successful release was &quot;Tell Me You&#x27;re Mine&quot;, which had sold over one million copies by 1958. &quot;Tell Me You&#x27;re Mine&quot; reached #3 on the US chart. They also recorded comedy-novelty material, like &quot;Love I You.&quot;

Fredianelli rejoined Mercury in 1954 after his military service, and, as Ronnie Gaylord, recorded as a solo artist (charting with his hit song &quot;Cuddle Me&quot;). Bonaldi, Rea, and Christ continued recording as The Gaylords for Mercury until 1964. After their recording contract lapsed, Rea and Christ left the group. Fredianelli and Bonaldi continued to perform as &quot;Gaylord and Holiday&quot;; Bonaldi used the professional name of Burt Holiday, and adopted it legally in 1976. The team stayed together until 2003, when Fredianelli&#x27;s failing health curtailed further work.

Fredianelli died on January 25, 2004, in Las Vegas, Nevada, at age 73.

Bonaldi still performed with Ron Gaylord, Jr., Ronnie Gaylord&#x27;s oldest son (the other son being rock guitarist Tony Fredianelli) until his death on May 10, 2017, in Carson City, Nevada, at age 90.

Donald &quot;Don&quot; Rea, keyboardist for The Gaylords, died in Reno, Nevada, on June 30, 2017, after a short battle with cancer, at age 88. Bill Christ, the last surviving member of the group, died on October 30, 2017, at the age of 87.

<text>Ronnie Gaylord (born Ronald Fredianelli; June 12, 1930, Detroit—January 25, 2004, Las Vegas) was an Italian-American musician, songwriter, pantomimer, and comedian best known as a member of the band The Gaylords and the music/comedy duo Gaylord and Holiday. Among their many hits are &quot;Tell Me You&#x27;re Mine&quot;, &quot;From the Vine Came the Grape&quot;, and &quot;The Little Shoemaker&quot;. He adopted the stage name Ronnie Gaylord in the 1950s after going by Ronnie Vincent for a brief period.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Gaylord was born Ronald L. &quot;Ronnie&quot; Fredianelli on June 12, 1930, in Detroit to Joseph and Florence (née Antico) Fredianelli. His mother died of pulmonary tuberculosis in 1932; his father remarried Frances (née Graziana) in 1937. Gaylord is Italian on both sides: his father was born in Boveglio and his mother&#x27;s parents were from Naples.

Gaylord grew up in the same east side Detroit neighborhood as Bonaldo Bonaldi (later known as Burt Holiday), purportedly his cousin, and they both attended the University of Detroit Mercy to study pre-law. In 1947, while still students, Bonaldi and Gaylord (then still known as Fredanelli) formed a musical group called the Gay Lords with classmate Don Rae. They performed on campus and in clubs around Detroit; a newspaper misprinted their name from the Gay Lords to the Gaylords, which they took on. Gaylord finished two years of law school before quitting to tour with the band.

===Career===
The first hit by the Gaylords was &quot;Tell Me You&#x27;re Mine&quot; which hit #2 on the music charts upon its release in 1952. The record sold more than 1.2 million copies and was a gold record. This was an Italian love song, &quot;Per un Bacio d&#x27;Amore&quot;, with English lyrics written by the band and &quot;an upbeat chorus&quot;. Singing popular Italian songs in English, and popular English songs in Italian, continued to be a part of the Gaylords&#x27; style throughout their career.

Not long after, Gaylord was drafted into the Korean War; he finished basic at Camp Atterbury and was subsequently assigned to the Special Services. He sang with the military band, did a number of singing commercials, and continued to produce music as a solo artist for Mercury Records. His hit song &quot;Cuddle Me&quot; was in the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top 20 Singles between March and May 1954. He guest starred on the Army-sponsored radio show &quot;Club 31&quot; and, in addition to &quot;Cuddle Me&quot;, recorded &quot;Coquette&quot; and &quot;Tell Me You Love Me Tonight&quot;.

He was discharged from the military in 1958 and returned to the Gaylords, where he had been temporarily replaced by Billy Christ. After a brief split between Gaylord and Holiday, they reunited and began rebuilding the band to its success before the war. The following year, Bonaldi and Gaylord moved to Nevada together to work on the lounge circuit, a gig that was quite popular at the time. In the 1960s, they began billing as both a music and comedy duo. Their sets variously included poking fun at the city (when they were traveling); taking up stereotypical Italian personas and putting them in improbable situations; and impressions of other musicians, including The Mills Brothers, Elvis Presley, and Sonny and Cher. Gaylord wrote &quot;I&#x27;ll Trade You Laughter For Love&quot; for fellow lounge circuit performer Don Rickles, who eventually used the song as his &quot;theme song&quot;. In 1966, they performed at Frank Sinatra&#x27;s wedding to Mia Farrow. Rae, who had been an accompanying part of the Gaylords for several years, officially left the band in 1975.

In the 1960s and 1970s, Gaylord appeared on a number of variety shows while the genre was at its peak, most of the time with Holiday but at times on his own. These appearances include &quot;The Glen Campbell Goodtime Hour&quot;, &quot;The Hollywood Palace&quot;, &quot;Moving Wheels&quot;, &quot;The Johnny Carson Show&quot;, &quot;Headline Hunters&quot;, &quot;Melodies and Money&quot;, &quot;The Flip Wilson Show&quot;, &quot;Jukebox Jury&quot;, and &quot;The Ford Show&quot;. In 1965, the two were working on a pilot for their own TV show, but it never came to fruition.
In 1985, they created &quot;Famiglia&quot;, described by Holiday as &quot;an Italian &quot;Fiddler on the Roof&quot;&quot;, written by Gaylord. The film was eventually converted into a musical for stage. It follows the lives of a three-generation Italian family, starring Gaylord as the middle generation; Holiday as his father; and Gaylord&#x27;s son Tony as his son. His wife Terry and son Ron Jr. also appear.

In addition to playing guitar, violin, bass, banjo, and mandolin, Gaylord was a talented songwriter who wrote a number of hits, including &quot;Cuddle Me&quot; (performed by Gaylord); &quot;Oh, Am I Lonely?&quot; (performed by Gaylord); &quot;I&#x27;ll Trade You Laughter For Love&quot; (performed by Don Rickles); &quot;I Will Never Pass This Way Again&quot; (performed by Glen Campbell), and &quot;Wondering!&quot; (performed by The Gaylords).

Gaylord continued performing until the end; his last gig was in Michigan just four months before his death in January 2004.

===Personal life===
Gaylord stayed in the Las Vegas/Reno area from the time he and Holiday moved there in 1959 until his death. He had two children, Ronald Jr. and Melissa, with his first wife, Teena, and three, Christopher, Anthony, and Tiffany, with his second wife, Terry, who he was with for 35 years.

Four of five children are or were involved in show business. Tony was the guitarist for Third Eye Blind until 2010 and previously played with heavy metal band Apocrypha and cover band Loveshack; Tiffany sang at Texas Station with Loveshack and at MGM Grand Las Vegas with Venus; Ron Jr. filled his father&#x27;s role in Gaylord and Holiday; and Chris is a musician. Melissa, his eldest daughter, is a teacher. He was also survived by his grandchildren Jaime Fredianelli-Lessig and Joseph Fredianelli, and great-grandchildren Jared Phillips and Kaylee Lessig.

When not performing, Gaylord enjoyed painting, sketching, sculpting, and collecting cars.

Gaylord died on January 25, 2004, in his Las Vegas home following an eight-year battle with cancer. He hid his diagnosis from everyone, including his wife Terry and partner Burt, for as long as he could so he could continue performing.

<doc id="462201" wikidata="Q1343925" url="?curid=462201" title="Sholem Schwarzbard">
<text>Samuel &quot;Sholem&quot; Schwarzbard (; ; ; 18 August 1886 – 3 March 1938) was a Russian-French Yiddish poet. He served in the French and Soviet military, was a communist and anarchist, and is known for organising Jewish community defense against pogroms in the pre-First World War era and the Russian Civil War era in Ukraine, and for the assassination of Ukrainian nationalist leader Symon Petliura in 1926. He wrote poetry in Yiddish under the pen name of &quot;Baal-Khaloymes&quot; ().

==Early life==
Schwarzbard was born in 1886 in Izmail, Bessarabia Governorate, Russian Empire to the Jewish family of Itskhok Shvartsbard and Khaye Vaysberger. His real given name was Sholem. After the proclamation of an order by the Russian Imperial government for all Jews to move out from the region within of the border, his family moved to the town of Balta, in the southern Podolia region, where he grew up. His three older brothers died as children and his mother died whilst he was a child. In 1900, at an early age of 14 he became an apprentice to a watchmaker, Israel Dik.

During his apprenticeship in 1903, he became interested in socialism and began agitating for a revolutionary group called &quot;Iskra&quot;, likely related to Lenin&#x27;s journal of the same name. At the time of the first Russian Revolution in 1905, he was based in Kruti, north of Balta, where he was employed, in his own words, &quot;fixing Cossack watches&quot;. A short time after participating in Jewish-run and -manned paramilitary activity while visiting his father in Balta, he was arrested and served a short stint in Proskurov and Balta prisons. He was released with the general amnesty granted as part of post-revolutionary tsarist &quot;leniency&quot;. Fearing further arrests, Schwarzbard fled across the border into Austria-Hungary, where he lived and worked in a number of cities and towns, including the capitals, Vienna and Budapest. There, he was converted to anarchism, a political philosophy, especially the teachings of Peter Kropotkin, to which he would remain loyal the rest of his life.

== France (1910–1917) ==
In January 1910, at age 23, he settled in Paris and found work with a series of watchmakers.

===First World War and injury===
The day before enlisting, he married his girlfriend of three years, Anna Render, a fellow immigrant from Odesa. On 24 August 1914, Schwarzbard and his brother enlisted in the French Foreign Legion. As a legionnaire, he was sent to the front in November 1914 and participated in the Second Battle of Artois, near Arras, in May 1915. On account of his excellent military record, in early 1915, he was moved to the regular French 363rd &quot;régiment d’infanterie&quot; and transferred south to the Vosges Forest. While there, he was shot through the left lung, fracturing his scapula and tearing his brachial plexus. The doctors gave him little hope of surviving the wound, but he slowly improved over the next year and a half until he was in good enough shape to return to Russia. His left arm was left virtually useless, and he was awarded the Croix de guerre for his courage in the World War.

== Russian Revolution (1917–1919) ==
He was demobilized in August 1917 and in September, traveled with his wife to the Russian Republic, established after the February Revolution. On the French boat &quot;Melbourne&quot;, he was arrested for communist agitation and was handed over to Russian authorities in Arkhangelsk. He later traveled to Petrograd, where he joined and served in the politically mixed Red Guards (1917–1920). Schwarzbard commanded a unit of 90 sabers in the brigade of Grigory Kotovsky.

During the occupation and in the chaos that ensued after the Germans left, Schwarzbard lay low, survived a serious bout of typhus and worked securing facilities and supplies for the newly forming Soviet school system. He had himself tried to establish independent anarchist schools, but was willing to work with the Bolsheviks as they increasingly centralized the school system. Hearing news of countless pogroms, Schwarzbard tried to volunteer as a Red Guard soldier. After many delays, he was finally accepted into an &quot;International Brigade&quot; in June 1919 and began his second revolutionary campaign. The next two months were perhaps the worst of his life. His unit suffered defeat from the combined forces of Petliura and Denikin, who were uneasy allies at the time. Schwarzbard was in Kyiv when both the Ukrainian and White Armies entered the city, his unit having been wiped out and disbanded. It was in this period, July–August 1919 that Schwarzbard witnessed first-hand the ruins and human devastation left by pogrom violence—images that would haunt him for the rest of his life. He again managed to take a train back to Odesa, where he was betrayed by a fellow anarchist to the White forces in control of the city. Before they could catch him, he learned that as a former French soldier, he was entitled to a passage to France. In late December 1919 he boarded the &quot;Nicholas I&quot; and sailed to Marseilles via Istanbul, Beirut and Port Said. He was back in Paris by 21 January 1920.

In the turmoil that transpired in the period of the Russian Civil War, fourteen members of his family perished in antisemitic pogroms, including his most beloved uncle, who was killed in Ananiv. The names of all fourteen were listed for his trial in 1926 and can be found in the YIVO Schwarzbard Archive.

== Return to France (1920–1927) ==
In 1920, disillusioned with the outcome of the revolution, Sholom moved back to Paris where he opened a clock-and-watch repair shop. There he was active in the French labor movement as an anarchist, and in 1925 became a French citizen. He was acquainted with prominent anarchist activists who had emigrated from Russia and Ukraine, including such figures as Volin, Alexander Berkman, Emma Goldman, as well as Nestor Makhno and his follower Peter Arshinov. In Paris Schwarzbard also became a member of the &quot;Union of Ukrainian citizens&quot;. He contributed a number of articles to New York&#x27;s anarchist daily &quot;Freie Arbeiter Stimme&quot; under the pseudonym &quot;Sholem&quot;—his first name, but also Yiddish for &quot;peace&quot;, a fact he was quite proud of as an avid fan of Count Tolstoy.

===Assassination of Petliura (1926)===
Symon Petliura, who was head of the Directorate of the Ukrainian National Republic in 1919, had moved to Paris in 1924 and was the head of the government-in-exile of the Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic. Sholom Schwarzbard, who had lost his family in the 1919 pogroms, held Symon Petliura responsible for them (see the discussion on Petliura&#x27;s role in the pogroms). According to his autobiography, after hearing the news that Petliura had relocated to Paris, Schwarzbard became distraught and started plotting Petliura&#x27;s assassination. Schwarzbard recognized Petliura from a picture. In 2006, Russian intelligence specialists stated, in a series of volumes on the Soviet secret services, that Schwarzbard worked as an agent of the Joint State Political Directorate (OGPU) at the time of Petliura’s assassination, and speculated that he may have been carrying out orders for the regime which benefitted from Petliura&#x27;s death.

On 25 May 1926, at 14:12, by the Gibert bookstore, he approached Petliura, who was walking on Rue Racine near Boulevard Saint-Michel of the Latin Quarter, Paris, and asked him in Ukrainian, &quot;Are you Mr. Petliura?&quot; Petliura did not answer but raised his cane. Schwarzbard immediately pulled out a gun and shot him five times. After Petliura fell to the pavement, he shot him twice more. When the police came and asked if he had done the deed, he reportedly said, &quot;I have killed a great assassin.&quot; Other sources state that he attempted to fire an eighth shot into Petliura, but his firearm jammed.

===Schwarzbard trial (1927)===

Schwarzbard was arrested and was put on trial by the Public Court Committee on 18 October 1927. His defense was led by Henri Torrès, a renowned French jurist who had previously defended anarchists such as Buenaventura Durruti and Ernesto Bonomini and who also represented the Soviet consulate in France.

The core of Schwarzbard&#x27;s defense was to attempt to show that he was avenging the deaths of victims of pogroms, whereas the prosecution (both criminal and civil) tried to show that Petliura was not responsible for the pogroms and that Schwarzbard was a Soviet agent.

Both sides brought on many witnesses, including several historians. A notable witness for the defence was Haia Greenberg (aged 29), a local nurse who survived the pogroms in Proskurov (now renamed Khmelnytskyi, Ukraine) and testified about the carnage. She never said that Petliura personally participated in the event, but rather some other soldiers who said that they were directed by Petliura. Several former Ukrainian officers testified for the prosecution, including a Red Cross representative who witnessed Semesenko&#x27;s report to Petliura.

After a trial lasting eight days the jury acquitted Schwarzbard.
After his acquittal in 1928, Schwartzbard decided to immigrate to the British Mandate of Palestine. The British authorities, however, refused him a visa. In 1933, he traveled the United States where he re-enacted his role in the murder on film. In 1937, Schwartzbard traveled to South Africa, where he died in Cape Town on 3 March 1938. In 1967, his remains were disinterred and transported to Israel, where he was reinterred.

==Writings==
Schwarzbard is the author of numerous books in Yiddish published under the pseudonym &quot;Bal Khaloymes&quot; (master of dreams): (Dreams and Reality, Paris, 1920), (At War with Myself, Chicago, 1933), (Over the Year, Chicago, 1934).

Sholom Schwarzbard&#x27;s papers are archived at YIVO Institute for Jewish Research in New York. They were rescued during World War II and smuggled from France by the historian Zosa Szajkowski.

<text>James Austin (March 6, 1813 – February 27, 1897) was a nineteenth century Toronto businessman and the owner of Spadina House, now a museum.

==Life and career==
He was born in Tandragee, County Armagh, Northern Ireland, to a Methodist family. He immigrated to Canada at age sixteen along with his parents and became apprenticed to a printer, William Lyon Mackenzie. While not directly involved, his close association with Mackenzie led Austin to flee to the United States following the Upper Canada Rebellion of 1837.

In 1843, those involved in the rebellion were granted amnesty, and Austin returned to Toronto. Entering business, he joined with Patrick Foy to found the Austin &amp; Foy Wholesale Company in the Daniel Brooke Building at the corner of King and Jarvis streets in Toronto. The wholesale company was successful, but Austin was interested in pursuing other ventures and it was dissolved in 1870, leaving Austin with a fair amount of money.

He then became a central player in the Toronto financial world. In 1871, he founded The Dominion Bank, ancestor of today&#x27;s Toronto-Dominion Bank. He remained president of that institution until his death, but he was also involved in many others. He became president of the Queen City and the Hand-to-Hand insurance companies, and chairman of the North of Scotland Canadian Mortgage Company. He also was involved in the Consumers&#x27; Gas Company, being one of its founding directors. In 1881, he increased his control over Consumers&#x27; Gas and became president of that company.

In 1844, he married Susan Bright, and they had five children. His eldest son Charles died at 13, and his second son James (Jim) died of pneumonia at 38. In 1866, he built Spadina House to house his family, which is now a museum.

He retained all of his positions up until his death, despite suffering from deafness late in life. He died after several months of illness at the age of eighty-four. At his death, he had a fortune of some $300,000, which was divided between his son and daughter. His business interests and his home passed on to his surviving son, Albert William Austin.

<doc id="462213" wikidata="Q1129342" url="?curid=462213" title="Convair YB-60">
<text>The Convair YB-60 was a prototype heavy bomber built by Convair for the United States Air Force in the early 1950s. It was a purely jet-powered development of Convair&#x27;s earlier mixed-power B-36 Peacemaker.

==Design and development==
On 25 August 1950, Convair issued a formal proposal for a swept-winged version of the B-36 with all-jet propulsion. The Air Force was sufficiently interested that on 15 March 1951, it authorized Convair to convert two B-36Fs (49-2676 and 49-2684) as the B-36G. Since the aircraft was so radically different from the existing B-36, the designation was soon changed to YB-60.

The YB-60 had 72% parts commonality with its piston-engined predecessor. The fuselages of the two aircraft were largely identical although the radar and bombing systems were located in a removable nose section as a result of the poor reliability of the B-36 installation. For initial flight testing a more streamlined nose with an instrumented boom was fitted; a wedge-shaped insert was added just outboard of the main landing gear to increase wing sweep and the tail surfaces were swept to match. The swept wings also used many B-36 parts. A steerable tail wheel was added to prevent the aircraft tipping backwards. It was not necessarily extended when on the ground but depended on how the aircraft was loaded.

The YB-60&#x27;s unofficial competitor for an Air Force contract was Boeing&#x27;s B-52 Stratofortress. Convair&#x27;s proposal was substantially cheaper than Boeing&#x27;s, since it involved modifying an existing design rather than starting from scratch. Like the B-52, it was powered by eight Pratt &amp; Whitney J57-P-3 turbojets mounted in pairs in four pods suspended below the wing. Prior to this engine configuration Convair had evaluated a six-turboprop design and one with 12 J47 engines.

The first YB-60 prototype&#x27;s crew numbered five; the second prototype&#x27;s numbered nine, as it did in the planned production B-60s. Production B-60s were to have defensive armament similar to those of the B-36.

The Convair YB-60, bearing serial number 49-2676, conducted its inaugural flight on April 18, 1952, under the command of Beryl Erickson. However, the Boeing YB-52 had beaten the Convair aircraft into flight by three days. The YB-60 was notably slower than the YB-52, cruising at about 100 mph (160 km/h) less, and encountered significant handling issues attributed to controls designed for slower speeds. Despite boasting a heavier bomb capacity—72,000 lb (33,000 kg) compared to the YB-52&#x27;s 43,000 lb (20,000 kg)—the Air Force concluded that the YB-60&#x27;s drawbacks outweighed the benefits of its increased payload. Modifications to the B-52, such as the &quot;big belly&quot; configuration, eventually raised its bomb load to 60,000 lb (27,000 kg). The flight test programs for the YB-60 were terminated on January 20, 1953, having accumulated 66 flying hours. While a second prototype was nearing completion, it never had its engines installed nor its other equipment fully integrated. Despite these challenges, Convair successfully fulfilled its prototype contract, leading to the formal acceptance of both YB-60s by the Air Force in 1954. Neither operational aircraft flew again, and both airframes were dismantled and scrapped by July.

The program cost was $14.3 million.

An airliner adaptation of the YB-60 was proposed by Convair, but its wingspan and weight would have required unacceptable airport infrastructure changes beyond those required for the upcoming Boeing 707. The company decided to pursue the Convair 880 series airliner instead.

<text>Spadina Museum (), also known as Spadina House, is a historic mansion at 285 Spadina Road in Toronto, Ontario, which is now a historic house museum operated by the City of Toronto&#x27;s Economic Development &amp; Culture division. The museum preserves the house much as it existed and developed historically. The art, decor and architecture of the house used to reflect the contemporary styles of the 1860s through the 1930s, including Victorian, Edwardian, Arts and Crafts, Art Nouveau, Art Deco and Colonial Revival styles. The museum closed for a year for extensive interior and exterior renovations. When it re-opened to the public on October 24, 2010, it was decorated in the style of the inter-war era of the 1920s and 1930s. The estate&#x27;s gardens reflect the landscape during the Austin family&#x27;s occupation of the house.

== History ==
The first house constructed on the site was built in 1818 by Dr. William Warren Baldwin. He named his property and estate &quot;Spadina&quot;, which derived from the Ojibwe word &quot;espadinong&quot;, which translates as &quot;hill&quot; or &quot;sudden rise of land&quot;; it is located at the top of an escarpment. Baldwin himself designed the two storey wood-frame house. The house burnt down in 1835, and owing to the three mile (5 km) trek from the estate into York, he moved to a house on Front Street. He built a smaller country estate on the property in 1836.

In 1866 the property was acquired by James Austin, founder of The Dominion Bank and Consumers Gas. By this time, parts of the property had been sold off, and what Austin purchased covered . In the 19th and early 20th century the area was the wealthiest in Toronto, with a number of Toronto&#x27;s leading families having large estates. Austin subdivided and sold off the land west of Spadina Road in 1889, which amounted to . In 1892, James Austin turned over the house, and of the property to his son, Albert William Austin. Albert Austin expanded the house in several renovations, including the addition of a third floor in 1912. He sold much of the property to the City of Toronto in 1913 for the construction of the St. Clair Reservoir. Albert Austin died in 1933.

The last member of the family to live in the house was Anna Kathleen Thompson, a daughter of Albert Austin, who lived there from 1942 until 1982. The aged house had outdated wiring and needed a thorough overhaul, that would have been far more expensive than rebuilding it. While the house could have been sold to private interests, the family decided instead to donate the house and all of its furnishings to the city. In 1984 it opened as a museum, jointly owned by the city and the Ontario Heritage Foundation and operated by the City of Toronto. The museum is especially known for its gardens.

== Museum operation ==

The Spadina historic house and gardens is one of ten historic museums operated and owned by the City of Toronto. The museum&#x27;s visitors learn and experience how Torontonians lived during the early 20th Century. Tours are scheduled at set times each day, that explore political, economic and social themes of that time period. The restoration process of the museum is also offered in “The restoration tour”. Other possible excursions available include “It’s a Kid’s Life” and “Meet the Austins: A Toronto Family in the 1920s and 1930s”. A seasonal excursion at the Spadina House is “Flashman versus Evil: A Grudge Match-recreated 1930’s Radio Play”. This excursion has been on exhibit four times, during the holiday season, and recreates 1930&#x27;s live radio shows for the visitors to experience Radio how the inhabitants of the Spadina House would have in the 1930s.

The Spadina Historic house is known as a desirable location for photography, film shots, weddings, and corporate functions.

== Description ==
The house is at the southern end of the northern section of Spadina Road, on top of Davenport Hill, an escarpment which was the shore of prehistoric Lake Iroquois. Immediately east was Sir John Craig Eaton and Lady Eaton&#x27;s massive Italianate palace and estate, Ardwold. Just around the corner on Austin Terrace, on the lot adjacent to Spadina House, is Casa Loma, a stately pile built in 1911 by Major-General Sir Henry Mill Pellatt.

The architecture of the Austin Home is inspired by the second empire architectural style combined with elements of later Victorian and Edwardian style. The exterior features that it is known for are its bay windows, its brick and stone terrace, the brick chimneys, and the botanically themed carved keystones. The estate ground&#x27;s oldest building is a wood stable from the mid-19th century, which was attached to the old coach house, and was once used as a gardener&#x27;s shed until the end of the 1920s. The interior of the house showcases the Victorian and Edwardian components through its floating staircase in the central hall, high baseboards, ceiling medallions, plaster crown mouldings and hardwood floors. This home is separated into 14 rooms and six common areas, in which various new art pieces and decorations are showcased.

The remodelling in 2010 added specific studied reproductions of the original family&#x27;s artefacts. The wallpaper, the kitchen, the bathroom, and bedroom closet were remodelled. Stuffed wolves found in the family&#x27;s archives are now placed at the entryway of the museum. Additionally, the artwork included in the remodel was a statue from France of a woman. Due to the blue and pink colors of the sculpture, the museum staff nicknamed it “Wonder Woman”. Another part of the remodelling was the addition of a mechanical chair used by Albert Austen when he lost mobility. The entirety of the chair moves and is kept as an artefact as it was designed by him for himself. This chair resembles a “La-Z-Boy chair&quot;. The City of Toronto invested about 600,000 dollars towards the revitalization of the Spadina House to present day.

The natural landscape of the Spadina House is protected by law under the “Ravine and Natural Feature Protection By-law”. This estate originally included 200 acres of farmland. There were 200 feet of trees between the house&#x27;s initial frame and the edge of the ridge in the south of the property, still providing an unbroken view of Downtown Toronto and Lake Iroquois. Spadina House&#x27;s landscape features include formal gardens, the old Orchard, the stone pergola, the fieldstone wall, and the Battery constructed by James and Susan. There are presently 6 acres of restored 1905 Gardens. These 6 acres hold more than 300 varieties of flowers and vegetables.

The name and pronunciation of the “Spadina House” is rooted from the Ojibway word “Espadinong” which signifies “Hill”. It was adopted as a name for the home and the street by Baldwin. Many Torontonians follow a convention of pronouncing Spadina Road with the &quot;i&quot; as as in &quot;mine&quot;, and Spadina House with the &quot;i&quot; as in as in &quot;ski.&quot; Occasionally, Spadina Road is pronounced the second way. South of Bloor Street, however, Spadina Road becomes Spadina Avenue, which is &quot;always&quot; pronounced the first way. The distinction between the two ways was once an economic class marker in Toronto with the upper classes favouring the second pronunciation. Now, however, even the official TTC stop announcements pronounce the &quot;i&quot; in Spadina as the one in &quot;mine&quot;.

== Awards ==
Spadina Museum was jointly awarded the Peggi Armstrong Public Archaeology Award along with the Ontario Heritage Trust in 2004.

Spadina Museum was awarded the Ontario Museum Association Award of Merit in conjunction with Dawn Roach Bowen for their Black History Month programme &quot;Meet Mrs. Pipkin&quot; in 2002. Mrs. Pipkin was a laundress at the Spadina house in the 1860s, where she came after escaping slavery in the United States.

“Spadina Museum was nominated for the 2013 Toronto Heritage Award in the William Greer Architectural Conservation and Craftsmanship category”

This award category was created to honor the owners who restored structures or buildings that, either have existed for 40 years or more, or are included in the inventory of “Toronto’s Heritage Properties”. The jury who decides on the winners of the award focus on several different aspects, such as: whether the new building or structure meets current needs, was restored using the appropriate materials, kept a significant portion of the original building&#x27;s design, use of sound conservation and of course quality of craftsmanship.

<text>The Eighth Army is a U.S. field army which commands all United States Army forces in South Korea. It is headquartered at the Camp Humphreys in the Anjeong-ri of Pyeongtaek, South Korea. Eighth Army relocated its headquarters from Yongsan to Camp Humphreys in the summer of 2017. It is the only field army in the U.S. Army. It is responsible to United States Forces Korea and United States Army, Pacific.

==History==

===World War II===

The unit first activated on 10 June 1944 in the United States, under the command of Lieutenant General Robert L. Eichelberger. The Eighth Army took part in many of the amphibious landings in the Southwest Pacific Theater of World War II, eventually participating in no less than sixty of them. The first mission of the Eighth Army, in September 1944, was to take over from the U.S. Sixth Army in New Guinea, New Britain, the Admiralty Islands and on Morotai, in order to free up the Sixth Army to engage in the Philippines Campaign (1944–45).

The Eighth Army again followed in the wake of the Sixth Army in December 1944, when it took over control of operations on Leyte Island on 26 December. In January, the Eighth Army entered combat on Luzon, landing the XI Corps on 29 January near San Antonio and the 11th Airborne Division on the other side of Manila Bay two days later. Combining with I Corps and XIV Corps of Sixth Army, the forces of Eighth Army next enveloped Manila in a great double-pincer movement. Eighth Army&#x27;s final operation of the Pacific War was that of clearing out the southern Philippines of the Japanese Army, including on the major island of Mindanao, an effort that occupied the soldiers of the Eighth Army for the rest of the war.

===Occupation of Japan===
Eighth Army was to have participated in Operation Downfall, the invasion of Japan. It would have taken part in Operation Coronet, the second phase of the invasion, which would have seen the invasion of the Kantō Plain on eastern Honshū. However, the Japanese surrender cancelled the invasion, and the Eighth Army found itself in charge of a peaceful occupation. Occupation forces landed on 30 August 1945, with its headquarters in Yokohama, then the HQ moved to the Dai-Ichi building in Tokyo. At the beginning of 1946, Eighth Army assumed responsibility for occupying all of Japan. Four quiet years then followed, during which the Eighth Army gradually transitioned from a combat-ready fighting force into a constabulary. Lieutenant General Walton H. Walker took command in September 1948, and he tried to re-invigorate the Army&#x27;s training, with mixed success.

===Korean War===


The peace of occupied Japan was shattered in June 1950 when 75,000 North Korean troops with Russian made tanks invaded South Korea, igniting the Korean War. U.S. naval and air forces quickly became involved in combat operations, and it was soon clear that U.S. ground forces would have to be committed. To stem the North Korean advance, the occupation forces in Japan were thus shipped off to South Korea as quickly as possible, but their lack of training and equipment was telling, as some of the initial U.S. units were destroyed by the North Koreans. However, the stage was eventually reached as enough units of Eighth Army arrived in Korea to make a firm front. The North Koreans threw themselves against that front, the Pusan Perimeter, and failed to break it. In the meantime, Eighth Army had reorganized, since it had too many divisions under its command for it to exercise effective control directly. The I Corps and the IX Corps were reactivated in the United States and then shipped to Korea to assume command of Eighth Army&#x27;s subordinate divisions.

The stalemate was broken by the Inchon landings of the X Corps (tenth corps, consisting of soldiers and Marines). The North Korean forces, when confronted with this threat to their rear areas, combined with a breakout operation at Pusan, broke away and hastily retired north.
Both South and North Korea were almost entirely occupied by United Nations forces. However, once U.S. units neared the Yalu River and the frontier between North Korea and China, the Chinese intervened and drastically changed the character of the war. Eighth Army was decisively defeated at the Battle of the Chongchon River and forced to retreat all the way back to South Korea. The defeat of the U.S. Eighth Army resulted in the longest retreat of any U.S. military unit in history. General Walker was killed in a jeep accident on 23 December 1950, and replaced by Lieutenant General Matthew Ridgway. The overstretched Eighth Army suffered heavily with the Chinese offensive, who were able to benefit from shorter lines of communication and with rather casually deployed enemy forces. The Chinese broke through the U.S. defenses despite U.S. air supremacy and the Eighth Army and U.N. forces retreated hastily to avoid encirclement. The Chinese offensive continued pressing U.S. forces, which lost Seoul, the South Korean capital. Eighth Army&#x27;s morale and &quot;esprit de corps&quot; hit rock bottom, to where it was widely regarded as a broken, defeated rabble.

General Ridgway forcefully restored Eighth Army to combat effectiveness over several months. Eighth Army slowed and ultimately halted the Chinese advance at the battles of Chipyong-ni and Wonju. It then counter-attacked the Chinese, re-took Seoul, and drove to the 38th parallel, where the front stabilized.

When General Ridgway replaced General of the Army Douglas MacArthur as the overall U.N. commander, Lieutenant General James Van Fleet assumed command of Eighth Army. After the war of movement during the first stages, the fighting in Korea settled down to a war of attrition. Ceasefire negotiations were begun at the village of Panmunjom in the summer of 1951, and they dragged on for two years. During the final combat operation of the war, Lieutenant General Maxwell D. Taylor (promoted to general 23 June 1953) commanded the Eighth Army. When the Military Demarcation Line was finally agreed to by the , South Korea and North Korea continued on as separate states.

=== Guarding Korea ===

During the aftermath of the Korean War, the Eighth Army remained in South Korea. By the 1960s, I Corps, consisting of the 7th Infantry Division and the 2nd Infantry Division, remained as part of the Eighth Army. Then, in 1971, the 7th Infantry Division was withdrawn, along with the command units of I Corps, which were moved across the Pacific Ocean to Fort Lewis, Washington. Later, in March 1977, a memo from President Jimmy Carter said &quot;...American forces will be withdrawn. Air cover will be continued.&quot; Bureaucratic resistance from the Executive Branch, with support in Congress, eventually saw the proposal watered down. Eventually one combat battalion and about 2,600 non-combat troops were withdrawn.

This left the 2nd Infantry Division at the Korean Demilitarized Zone to assist the South Korean Army. Besides forming a trip-wire against another North Korean invasion, the 2nd Infantry Division remained there as the only Army unit in South Korea armed with tactical nuclear weapons. (Otherwise, there is only the U.S. Air Force in South Korea and on Okinawa.) All nuclear weapons were taken from the Army to be under Air Force control. Later, in 1991, all U.S. nuclear weapons were removed from South Korea.

==== Recent times ====
In 2003, plans were announced to move the 2nd Infantry Division southward. The division, with 15 bases north of the Han River and just south of the DMZ, was to be the most important formation to be moved south of the Han River in two phases &quot;over the next few years&quot; a joint statement between the South Korean and U.S. governments said on June 5, 2003. As of 2015, it appears that one brigade of the 2nd Infantry Division will remain at Camp Casey, near Dongducheon.

The headquarters of the Eighth Army was Yongsan Garrison, but moved southward to Camp Humphreys by 2019. In April 2017 the Eighth Army headquarters began its move from Yongsan to Camp Humphreys and held a ceremony to relocate a statue of General Walton Walker.

===Specific units===
====8th Army Band====

The 8th Army Band is the official musical unit of the HQ 8th Army and supports United States Forces Korea and the United Nations Command. The 41-member band was founded in 1916 as the Band of the 35th Infantry Regiment. During World War II, the band, then known as the 25th Infantry Division Band based out of Hawaii, served in the Pacific Theater, being a participant in Central Pacific and Guadalcanal campaigns. It was reorganized in November 1950 and reassigned to the newly formed ROK, the same year the Korean War began.

<text>Fredrik Meltzer (29 September 1779 – 17 December 1855) was a Norwegian businessman and representative at the Norwegian Constitutional Assembly at Eidsvoll in 1814. He is perhaps best known for designing the flag of Norway.

==Biography==
Fredrik Meltzer was born in Bergen, Norway. Meltzer was from a merchant family with origins in Rödinghausen in the County of Ravensberg (in present-day Westphalia), Germany. Meltzer received a commercial education in London from 1796 to 1798. His education continued with trips during 1800 to 1801 in the Netherlands, France and Germany, after which he joined the family import and export company in Bergen.

He represented the city of Bergen as a member of the Norwegian Constitutional Assembly where he served as a member on several committees. He generally favored the independence Party (&quot;Selvstendighetspartiet&quot;). Meltzer was one of the signatories of the Norwegian Constitution at Eidsvoll in 1814. Later he represented the city of Bergen in the Norwegian Parliament from 1821 to 1828. From 1813 to 1829, he was also a member of the city council in Bergen and from 1837 to 1849 a member of the Municipal Council.

Meltzer designed the modern flag of Norway in 1821 to replace the modified Danish and Swedish flags then in use. He chose to use a Nordic cross to reflect Norway&#x27;s close ties with Sweden and Denmark, and the colours red, white and blue in order to symbolize the liberal ideals associated with more or less democratic countries, such as the Netherlands, United Kingdom, United States of America, and revolutionary France.

==Personal life==
Fredrik Meltzer married Margrethe Stub (1779–1832) in 1802; they had 13 children.

<text>The Revolutionary Communist League was a small Trotskyist group in Britain. It was founded in 1970 by two small groups, one who split from International Marxist Group, after failing to persuade the group to turn away from work in the student movement and towards the trade unions and entryism in the Labour Party, and one which had split from Militant.

The League promoted the &quot;Socialist Charter&quot; initiative of Tribunite Labour MPs which published the &quot;Chartist&quot; paper, and were consequently nicknamed the Chartists. They took over this initiative, and based their work around the Charter on a conception of transitional politics taken from Leon Trotsky. They were also active around The Soldiers&#x27; Charter, an attempt to influence the armed forces.

By 1973, most of the group were moving to the right, while others (including Al Richardson) had left. A split developed and the Right of the group kept the journal, which developed a politics influenced by Euro-Communism and were close to the Labour Co-ordinating Committee.

In 1978, the RCL started to collaborate with the journal Intervention, which was connected to the Revolutionary Marxist Tendency, British section of Michel Pablo&#x27;s International Revolutionary Marxist Tendency. Until 1980, the group moved away from Trotskyism towards a &quot;distinctly libertarian type of socialism&quot;, focusing on advancing Socialist politics through municipal activity.

In late 1980, the Chartist minority faction around figures such as Graham Bash and Keith Veness left the RCL to found the journal &quot;London Labour Briefing&quot;.

<text>The Honda Magna is a cruiser motorcycle made from 1982 to 1988 and 1994 to 2003 and was the second Honda to use their new V4 engine shared with the VF750S Sabre and a few years later a related engine was fitted to the VF750F &#x27;Interceptor&#x27;, the later models used a retuned engine from the VFR750F with fins added to the outside of the engine. The engine technology and layout was a descendant of Honda&#x27;s racing V4 machines, such as the NS750 and NR750. The introduction of this engine on the Magna and the Sabre in 1982, was a milestone in the evolution of motorcycles that would culminate in 1983 with the introduction of the Interceptor V4. The V45&#x27;s performance is comparable to that of Valkyries and Honda&#x27;s 1800 cc V-twin cruisers. However, its mix of performance, reliability, and refinement was overshadowed by the more powerful 1,098 cc &quot;V65&quot; Magna in 1983.

Though criticized for its long-distance comfort and lauded mainly for its raw acceleration, the Magna was the bike of choice for Doris Maron, a Canadian grandmother and accountant-turned-traveler who toured the world solo by motorcycle. She made the trek without the benefit of the support crew that usually accompanies riders in adventures depicted in such films as Long Way Round.

The Honda Magna of years 1982–1988 incorporated a number of unique features into a cruiser market dominated by V-twin engines. The V4 engine configuration provided a balance between torque for good acceleration and high horsepower. The 90-degree layout produced less primary vibration, and the four cylinders provided a much smoother delivery of power than a V-twin. Good engine balance, plus short stroke and large piston diameter allowed for a high redline and potential top speed.

Besides the engine configuration, the bike had water-cooling, a six-speed transmission for good economy at highway speed, and common on other middleweight bikes for Honda in the early 1980s, shaft drive. While the shaft drive is very convenient with virtually no maintenance required (and no oil getting slung around), it also robbed some power from where it was more evidently lacking on in town or lower speed riding. It also had features like twin horns, hydraulic clutch, and an engine temperature gauge. A coil sprung, oil bath, air preload front fork with anti-dive valving was an improvement, although the Magna did not benefit from the linkage based single shock that was on the Sabre and Interceptor.

The V-65 Magna and other large-displacement Hondas were assembled in the Marysville Motorcycle Plant in Ohio for US delivery and in Japan for other markets. In 2008, Honda announced plans to close the plant, their oldest in North America, in 2009, which had been still making Gold Wings and VTX cruisers.

== 1982–1984 V45 (VF750C) Magna, 1984–1986 V42 (VF700C) Magna ==



=== 1982–1984 VF750C and VF700C ===

The 1982 V45 Magna has a round chrome headlight and fenders. The headlight is a sealed beam type. The front disc brakes have straight grooves, dual piston calipers, and TRAC anti-dive. The speedometer reads 80 mph and the tachometer indicates a 10,000 rpm redline. The engine is a DOHC 16-valve liquid-cooled 90-degree V-4 linked to a six-speed transmission with a hydraulically actuated wet-plate clutch and shaft drive. The compression is 10.5:1. The 1982 V45 covered 1/4 mile in 12.08 seconds at 108.82 MPH.

The 1983 V45 Magna is the same as the 1982 model with few differences. Early in the model year, the headlight was changed to a non-sealed beam unit with a replaceable halogen bulb. The front disc brake grooves are curved. The speedometer reads to but the redline on the tachometer is unchanged. (1983 starting SN JH2RC071*DM100011)

The US government imposed tariff rate hikes for foreign-built motorcycles over 700 cc in order to combat their rise in sales in North America, and to aid the domestic motorcycle manufacturers, namely Harley-Davidson. So for 1984 Honda responded by reducing the engine size for the VF750s to 698 cc by decreasing stroke on all of their 750cc engines, so the Magna became the VF700C in the USA. A side effect of this change was a higher-revving engine (redline now 10,500rpm) with similar power figures as the 750s. In 1984 rev limiters within the CDI units were added as well to help prevent over-revving that was fairly common with the earlier 750 models. The headlight changed from round chrome to a rectangular chrome housing. The seats were changed to a wider &amp; lower 2 piece design in an attempt to improve rider comfort. The rear shocks also changed to eliminate the extra fluid reservoir. The wheels were different as well now being an &quot;open&quot; 5-spoke wheel like Honda&#x27;s VT500s but with chrome the way around the rim&#x27;s lip but were the same size. Honda only made the VF700 for 1984, 1985, 1986, and 1987, then back to the VF750 after that. In the first part of 1984, some Magnas were still VF750s though 1984 750s were more common with Interceptors (VF750F).

Models from 1982 to 1984 were unique in their use of a larger primary fuel tank and smaller sub-tank. The sub-tank is located directly behind the left side cover, well below the level of the carburetor banks and has a low-fuel sensor incorporated into the body. Owing to the low seat height (much lower than in a standard street bike) and cruiser styling of the bike, the main tank is relatively small. Because the bottom end of the sub-tank is so low, all bikes in this family have a fuel pump to get the fuel up into the carburetors. In practice, the fuel pump adds more complexity to a carbureted bike which otherwise doesn&#x27;t need pressure-fed fuel.

=== 1985–1986 VF700C ===

For the 1985 and 1986 models, the sub-tank was dropped in favor of a slightly larger and wider main tank. Again because the reserve level of the tank was below the carburetors, the requisite fuel pump and series of fuel lines – although changed – were kept. Also for 1985 and 1986 the previously chrome, round rear fender became a painted single-piece unit much wider and taller like more classic cruisers which allowed for a wider rear tire. 1985 and 1986 saw new wheels too. Some of the trim around the Magna was changed as well, like the addition of a passenger back rest, smaller side covers, slightly lower seat and footpeg positions, brighter instrument cluster, slightly larger airbox covers, lighter front brake rotors, an improved radiator (now with a shut-off valve to greatly ease servicing), new exhaust, and the engine had silver case covers instead of the black prior years had. These engines also had silver aluminum covers over the engine&#x27;s shaft-drive output while prior years used black plastic covers, the engines were otherwise the same VF700 as 1984 with identical gear ratios and all.

In 1986 some of the parts around the Magna now had the &quot;Magna Bird&quot; emblem present on the airbox covers, the driver seat, and the passenger backrest. For only 1986 the engines had unique cylinder heads, the rear heads now featured a new cosmetic bolt-on piece and while all previous VF700s/VF750s used head bolts and more square valve covers 1986s were revised with line-bored camshaft journals thus taking different camshafts and valve covers. The new valve covers allowed for easier valve-rocker adjustment which would normally be a difficult procedure, but because of the shape head bolts had to be replaced with head studs so 1986 models have chrome acorn nuts where zinc-plated headbolts once were. These were the only changes from 1985 to 1986, the following years of Magnas would be quite different.

== 1983–1986 V65 (VF1100C) Magna ==
The large displacement V65 Magna attracted attention as Honda&#x27;s entry in the 1/4 mile wars between manufacturers at the time, causing Suzuki to respond with the 1200 Madura (which had a 1/4 mile time of 11.66 s at 115.7 mph), and going up against such competition as the Suzuki GS1150E (10.47 s at 128 mph). The V65 lay somewhere between these two in performance, posting a quarter mile time of 11.29 s at .

The 1983 V65 Magna was tested at a top speed of . In a 1983 &quot;Popular Mechanics&quot; achieved a top speed of , ranking it third of four motorcycles tested, less than slower than the Kawasaki GPZ1100 and Suzuki GS1100s.

In spite of this, the V65 Magna appeared from 1986 to 1989 in the &quot;Guinness Book of World Records&quot; as the fastest production motorcycle with a &quot;design speed&quot; of . During this period the production motorcycle with the fastest tested speed was the Kawasaki GPZ900R.

== 1984–1985 V30 (VF500C) Magna ==

The Honda VF500 is one of Honda&#x27;s second generation V4 motorcycle engines produced in a series of motorcycles designated with VF and VFR initials. For 1984–1986, Honda produced the 498 cc, V4 DOHC VF500 for the VF500C Magna V30 (1984/85) and its sister bike, the VF500F (1984–86). This engine is an evolution of Honda&#x27;s original domestic market 400 cc engine, originally deemed too small and underpowered for certain markets - notably the United States and Europe. Focusing on adding power and versatility to its motorcycle offerings, Honda bored the original 400 cc motor and improved its power and performance. The engine is almost entirely identical to the version in the Interceptor VF500F sport bike, and while Honda sold the VF500C Magna in the United States, it advertised it as the &quot;most powerful midsize custom in the world&quot;.

This standard motorcycle was introduced as a balanced bike that was just as enjoyable yet easier to ride in town than its larger Magna siblings, with good power and a broad torque band. Thanks to its V4 design, power in the &quot;500&quot; engine is not peaky and ample torque can be found throughout the rev band, and the six-speed transmission ratio was unique to this bike versus the ratio on the VF500F. The engine produced between 64 and 68 horsepower, and combined with its low weight and low center of gravity, the bike was lauded by critics as an easy to ride and entertaining motorcycle.

The Magna had no shaft drive like its larger siblings, but a traditional chain drive.

=== Specifications ===

* Standing-start quarter mile - 12.9 sec at 103 mph
* 0–60 in 3.9 seconds
* 60–0 in 120.6 feet

==== Changes by year ====

Facts from Cycle Magazine, July 1984
== 1987–1988 Super Magna (1987 V42 (VF700C) Magna and 1988 V45 (VF750C) Magna) ==
Various mechanical and cosmetic changes were introduced over the years, but the basic core of the Magna remained the same. The second generation Magna of 1987–1988 was dubbed the Super Magna by aficionados of the bike, though it was not an official Honda name. In 1987, the 699 cc engine produced @ 9,500 rpm, with torque being @ 7,500 rpm. In 1988, the Magna grew back to its original size of 748 cc.

In countries other than the US, the Magna continued as a 750. The Magna V-four has endured through the first and second generations of the VF and VFR Interceptors - both come and gone by 1988. Like the original 750 Sabre and VF 750, this 750 Magna engine uses a 360-degree crankshaft and chain-driven double-overhead camshafts. Thus, the VF750C unit is technologically quite different from Honda&#x27;s last V-four sport bike engine, the VFR750 Interceptor, which had gear-driven overhead cams and a 180-degree crankshaft.

The Super&#x27;s cams are also line-bored (a feature first seen in the Euro 1985 VF1000F &amp; F-II, and 85/86 VF1000R, 1986 VF500F, 1986 VF700C Magna), which greatly reduced the premature cam wear that plagued the earlier models, together with changed oil ducts.

The 1987 V45 Magna was available in either Candy Wave Blue or Candy Bourgogne Red (1988 dropped Blue in favor of Black). For 1987, the fake airbox covers were wrinkle black with a &quot;Magna&quot; emblem. The fake airbox emblem changes to &quot;V45&quot; for the 1988 model.

The 1987 Super Magna had a silver, grey and black Honda &quot;wing&quot; tank decal on the Candy Wave Blue tanks, and a silver, black, and red decal on the Candy Bourgogne Red tanks. The 1988 model had a silver &quot;MAGNA&quot; tank decal.

The exhaust system was now an upswept 4-into-4 set of pipes, truly unique in the cruiser world. Although the exhaust pipes were a beautiful sight, they were not friendly to the use of saddlebags as they were too high. The rear wheel was a solid aluminum disc. The chin fairing was unfinished black plastic for the 87, and color-matched for the 88. The second generation was also the first to have the lower seat height of a mere , more than lower than its predecessor. The production numbers of 1987 and 1988 Magnas have never been released by Honda.
In 1987 the Super Magna came in red or blue - about 16,000 total were built
In 1988 the Super Magna came in red or black - about 3500 total were built
==1994–2003 (VF750C) Magna==

The Magna 750 was launched in 1993 as an early release 1994 model. Honda sought to capture the market for powerful cruisers by lifting the engine from the VFR750 and slotting it in a cruiser chassis. The engine itself was beautified by the addition of chrome and some extra fins, and by the chromed 4 into 4 exhaust. The seat was kept very low, at 28 inches, with the passenger seat being detachable. The all new frame was complemented by 41 mm forks, dual shocks, and a single disc on the front. A drum brake was used on the rear. A few internal changes were made to the VFR engine for use in the Magna, including a different crankshaft, a 5-speed transmission and chain driven cams. Smaller carbs were also utilized. The changes resulted in a stronger mid-range pull, and a very broad band of power.

The design of the 3rd-generation Magna remained relatively unchanged over its lifetime. The tank decal was changed in 1995, and a miniature fairing was available on 1995 and 1996 Deluxe models.

2004 saw the demise of the Magna, along with other Honda stablemates such as the V-Twin Shadow ACE and Shadow Spirit, as well as the 6-cylinder Valkyrie.

<text>Agnodice (Greek: Ἀγνοδίκη, pronounced [aŋnodíkɛː]; c. 4th century BCE) is a legendary figure said to be the first female midwife or physician in ancient Athens. Her story, originally told in the &quot;Fabulae&quot; (attributed to the Roman author Gaius Julius Hyginus), has been used to illustrate issues surrounding women in medicine and midwifery. Agnodice is not generally considered a historical figure, but her legend has influenced discussions about gender roles in medical professions.

According to Hyginus, Agnodice studied medicine under the famous physician Herophilus. Because Athenian laws prohibited women from practicing medicine, Agnodice disguised herself as a man to work as a physician. As her popularity grew among female patients, rival male physicians accused her of seducing her clients. During her trial, she revealed her identity by lifting her tunic in a gesture known as anasyrma, proving she was a woman. Although accused of illegally practicing medicine, Agnodice was defended by the women of Athens, who praised her skill and dedication. She was ultimately acquitted, and the law prohibiting female physicians was revoked.

==Life story==
The story of Agnodice is known from a single ancient source, the &quot;Fabulae&quot;, a Latin handbook of mythology attributed to the Roman author Gaius Julius Hyginus. It is told by Hyginus in a list of stories about inventions, following descriptions of the medical innovations of Chiron, Apollo, and Asclepius. Agnodice&#x27;s story is the longest in the section. It is one of only two featuring a female inventor – the other being the goddess Demeter, credited by Hyginus with the discovery of grain – and one of the few about a mortal rather than a god or child of a god.

According to Hyginus, Agnodice lived in ancient Athens, where at the time women were forbidden from studying medicine. In order to learn medicine, she disguised herself as a man, cutting her hair short, and studied under Herophilus in Alexandria. Having trained as a physician, Agnodice tried to assist women in labour, who would not consult with male practitioners out of shame. In one case, Agnodice therefore revealed her sex and was permitted to treat the woman. Other doctors, growing jealous of Agnodice&#x27;s success, accused her of seducing her patients. On trial before the Areopagus, Agnodice lifted her clothes, revealing that she was a woman. She was charged with breaking the law which forbade women from practising medicine, but was defended by the wives of important Athenians whom she had treated. In response to this, the law was changed to allow women to practice medicine.

Hyginus describes Agnodice as an . It is difficult to know how to translate this into English. Sarah Pomeroy has rendered it as &quot;obstetrician&quot;, arguing that midwives existed in Athens in Agnodice&#x27;s day but that Agnodice was distinguished by her formal education in medicine. However, Helen King notes that there was no &quot;formal licensing system&quot; for medics in the ancient world, and that it is anachronistic to divide ancient healers into the distinct categories of &quot;midwife&quot; and &quot;obstetrician&quot;. Instead, she argues that the Latin is etymologically comparable to the Anglo-Saxon .

==Historicity==

Modern scholars generally doubt that Agnodice was a real historical figure. Problems with accepting Agnodice as historical include questions over her date, and the implausibility of Hyginus&#x27; claim that there were no in Athens before Agnodice, when literary and epigraphic evidence shows that midwives were known. 

Hyginus claims that Agnodice was taught medicine by &quot;a certain Herophilus&quot; – generally identified with Herophilus of Chalcedon, an ancient physician known for his work on gynaecology who was credited with the discovery of the ovaries. If this is the case, Agnodice would have lived in the late fourth or early third century BCE. Some authors have historically denied that the Herophilus of the Agnodice story was Herophilus of Chalcedon, however, arguing that Hyginus&#x27; description of him as &quot;a certain Herophilus&quot; suggests that this was not the famous Herophilus, and that Herophilus of Chalcedon worked in Egypt while Agnodice was Athenian. Helen King notes that, given the historical Herophilus&#x27; association with midwifery, he was &quot;simply the most appropriate teacher possible for Agnodice&quot;.

Those who believe in the historicity of Agnodice have proposed two different explanations for the lack of midwives in Athens before her. The first theory is that there were no midwives prior to Agnodice; alternatively, it has been proposed that there were earlier midwives but they had been forbidden by law from practising. This second theory has been elaborated over time, with Kate Hurd-Mead, in 1938, proposing that women had been forbidden from practising medicine because they had been accused of performing abortions. This version of the story has been repeated by subsequent authors, such as Margaret Alic in 1986, and Elizabeth Oakes in her &quot;Encyclopedia of World Scientists&quot; in 2007.

The various elements of the story of Agnodice are paralleled in other Greco-Roman stories. For instance, in Hyginus&#x27; version of the myth of Procris and Cephalus, Procris disguises herself as a man and reveals herself to Cephalus by lifting her tunic. Groups of women lifting their skirts also appear in myth (as in Plutarch&#x27;s story of Bellerophon and the Lycian women) and history (in stories told by Herodotus and Diodorus Siculus). If the story of Agnodice is interpreted in this context rather than as historical fact, Helen King argues that the two occurrences of skirt-lifting in the story function first to emphasise Agnodice&#x27;s similarity with the women she treats, and second her difference from the men of Athens. The broad arc of Agnodice&#x27;s story – disguising herself as a man, being accused of immoral conduct, and exposing herself to prove her sex and her innocence – also parallels the legend of the early Christian martyr Eugenia.

==Influence on women in medicine==
The story of Agnodice has been invoked since the sixteenth century to provide precedents for a range of gender options within the medical profession. Thus she was used both in the peak of men-midwifery in the eighteenth century and in women&#x27;s struggle to enter the medical profession in the nineteenth century. Elizabeth Cellier, the seventeenth century &quot;Popish midwife&quot;, positioned herself as a modern Agnodice. Although she appears in a list of &#x27;Who discovered/invented what&#x27;, she is represented more as someone who bridges the gap between the knowledge of male doctors (&quot;a certain Herophilus&quot;) and the delivery of this knowledge to women who are embarrassed to show their bodies to a male doctor. 

However, others have taken the story of Agnodice as a negative example: Augustus Kinsley Gardner, for instance, in 1851 delivered a lecture arguing that &quot;literally, no improvement was made&quot; in the &quot;many centuries&quot; where midwifery was a women&#x27;s profession, comparing Agnodice to the 19th century abortionist Madame Restell.

<text>The black-crowned tchagra (Tchagra senegalus) is a bushshrike. This family of passerine birds is closely related to the true shrikes in the family Laniidae, and was once included in that group.

This species is found in the Arabian Peninsula and most of Africa in scrub, open woodland, semi-desert and cultivation.

==Taxonomy==
In 1760 the French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson included a description of the black-crowned tchagra in his based on a specimen collected in Senegal. He used the French name and the Latin . Although Brisson coined Latin names, these do not conform to the binomial system and are not recognised by the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature. When in 1766 the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus updated his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; for the twelfth edition, he added 240 species that had been previously described by Brisson. One of these was the black-crowned tchagra. Linnaeus included a brief description, coined the binomial name &quot;Lanius senegalus&quot; and cited Brisson&#x27;s work. The species is now placed in the genus &quot;Tchagra&quot; that was introduced by the French naturalist René Lesson in 1831. Nine subspecies are recognised.

==Description==

The black-crowned tchagra is a colourful and unmistakable species, 19–22 cm in length. It has a black crown and eye stripes separated by a broad white supercilium. The underparts are pale grey and the upperparts pale brown. The folded wings are chestnut and the tail is black, tipped white. The bill is black.

Sexes are similar, but young birds have a brown cap and a pale yellow bill. There are 14 subspecies, varying in size and the colour of the back, underparts and eyestripe.

Black-crowned tchagra has a descending whistling song, , and can be readily tempted into sight by imitating this call, presumably because the bird is concerned that there is an intruder in its territory. The male also has a switchback display flight.

==Behaviour==
Black-crowned tchagra lays two or three heavily marked white eggs in a cup nest in a tree or bush. Both sexes, but mainly the female, incubate for 12–15 days to hatching; the chicks fledge after another 15 days.

It is similar in habits to the shrikes, hunting insects and other small prey from a perch in a bush, although it sits less conspicuously than true shrikes.

<text>Yvan Serge Cournoyer (born November 22, 1943) is a Canadian former professional hockey right winger who played in the National Hockey League for the Montreal Canadiens for 16 seasons, from to , winning 10 Stanley Cups. In 1972, Cournoyer scored the tying goal in the deciding game eight of the Canada-USSR series with seven minutes remaining. Canada went on to win the game and the series on Paul Henderson&#x27;s dramatic goal with 34 seconds left in the game.

Cournoyer was born in Drummondville, Quebec. He was nicknamed &quot;The Roadrunner&quot; due to his small size and blazing speed, which he credited to longer blades on his skates. He was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1982. In 2017 Cournoyer was named one of the &#x27;100 Greatest NHL Players&#x27; in history.

== Playing career ==

In 1961, Cournoyer started his junior ice hockey with the Montreal Junior Canadiens of the Ontario Hockey Association. By the time he was 18 years old, his legs had become so muscular that he required specially tailored pants.

Cournoyer made his NHL debut in 1963 with the Montreal Canadiens and earned a full-time spot with the club in 1964 after just seven games with the American Hockey League&#x27;s Quebec Aces.

Cournoyer was initially regarded by Canadiens head coach Toe Blake as a defensive liability and undeserving of a regular shift, though he was still frequently used on the power play. That changed after Blake&#x27;s departure following the Canadiens&#x27; Stanley Cup Championship, when incoming coach Claude Ruel granted Cournoyer a full-time shift. Cournoyer went on to have his first 40-goal season in and was named to the NHL&#x27;s Second All-Star Team.

Cournoyer scored a career-high 47 goals in the . In the Stanley Cup playoffs, he had his best playoffs ever, scoring 15 goals and tallying 10 assists in 17 games, earning the Conn Smythe Trophy following the Canadiens&#x27; defeat of the Chicago Black Hawks in the Stanley Cup Finals.

Cournoyer was named captain of the Canadiens in 1975 following the retirement of Henri Richard, pushing him to play harder in his new leadership role. Cournoyer would become only one of the Habs&#x27; two captains to win Stanley Cups throughout his entire (2+ year) tenure as captain, the other one being Maurice Richard, Henri&#x27;s older brother. The speedy Cournoyer&#x27;s ability to stay true to his form in his older age was a favourite topic of discussion of the Montreal fans and hockey media, however, and he did slow down due to a disc in his back that was pressing on a nerve and causing him great pain. Cournoyer eventually had to have surgery on his back and missed the entire 1977 playoffs.

Cournoyer returned for the and played in 68 games, scoring 24 goals and collecting 29 assists to match his previous season&#x27;s total of 53 points, though it was evident his back still bothered him. He managed to perform in the playoffs again, however, with seven goals and four assists in 15 games en route to Montreal&#x27;s third consecutive Cup. However, he was forced to retire following the 1979 season after playing in just fifteen games. When he retired, he only trailed Maurice Richard, and Jean Beliveau on the Canadiens&#x27; all-time scoring list. Cournoyer won a total of 10 Stanley Cups as a player (tied with Beliveau), second only to Henri Richard&#x27;s 11. The Cournoyer legacy includes many Top 10 Canadien records - 7th in total games played (968), 4th in goals scored (428), 7th in assists (435) and 6th in total points scored (863).

Cournoyer played for Canada in the 1972 Summit Series and is part of the famous picture wherein Paul Henderson jumps into his arms after scoring the game (and series) winner. Cournoyer scored three goals during the series. Late in the third period of Game 8, his goal tied the score, making a win by Canada possible.

Cournoyer coached the Montreal Roadrunners during the 1994–95 season and was an assistant coach to the Canadiens during the . He serves as an official ambassador for the Montreal Canadiens.

<text>Eubulus (, &quot;Euboulos&quot;; c. 405 – c. 335 BC) was a statesman of ancient Athens, who was very influential in Athenian politics during the period 355 BC to 342 BC and was notable for his abilities in managing Athenian finances.

Eubulus&#x27; early life is unknown, other than that he was from the Anaphlystus deme. With the Athenian politician, Diophantus of Sphettus, as his patron, he became chief commissioner of the important Theoric Fund, which provided free seats at public spectacles. He used this position to gradually take control of the finances of Athens and is credited with bringing a degree of prosperity not seen in many years. As an example of his approach, he introduced a law making it difficult to use public money for minor military operations, which ensured that a surplus was available for public works.

Eubulus was generally considered a member of the &quot;peace party&quot;, in opposition to Demosthenes. During the Third Sacred War, Eubulus attempted to stop Philip of Macedon intervening in Greek affairs by forming a Common Peace, with the support of Meidias, Aeschines, and Phocion. The results of his policy included an expedition to Thermopylae in 352 BC and an intervention in Euboea in 348 BC. In 346 BC, however, during deliberations on the Peace of Philocrates, which Demosthenes and Philocrates had negotiated with Philip, he advised the Athenian people that they must accept the peace because the state of their finances meant that they could not afford to continue the war.

When Demosthenes wanted to renew the war after Philip went into Phocis, Eubulus and his supporters argued for peace. But from 344 BC on, Eubulus&#x27; influence was waning, and by 342 BC, Demosthenes&#x27; party was in control. After the Battle of Chaeronea no more is heard of Eubulus.

<text>Patricia Penn Anne Kemp (born 1944), better known simply as Penn Kemp, is a Canadian poet, novelist, playwright, and sound poet who lives in London, Ontario. Kemp has been publishing her writing since 1972 and was London&#x27;s first poet laureate, serving since 2010 to 2013.

== Early life and education ==
Kemp was born on August 4, 1944, in Strathroy, Ontario, to parents Anne Kemp and James &quot;Jim&quot; Kemp. She was raised in the nearby city of London. Her father was an advertising and publicity executive at London Life, painter, and war artist. Penn says she wrote her first poem when she was six years old.

She earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in English and literature from the University of Western Ontario in 1966 and received certification as a teacher in 1968. In 1988 she received an Ontario Graduate Scholarship to complete a Masters of Education degree at the University of Toronto.

== Career ==
Kemp taught high school English in Timmins and North York, Toronto for several years.

Kemp&#x27;s first book, &quot;Bearing Down&quot;, was published by Coach House in 1972. In 1973, it was performed as a radio show for four voices in Seattle. In 1984, Kemp was writer in residence for Niagara Erie Writers in New York State; for the Labrador School Board in 1986; for Flesherton Library in 1988 and &#x27;89; and at SNDT Women&#x27;s University in Mumbai in 1995. In 1994, Kemp&#x27;s play, &quot;What the Ear Hears Last&quot;, was produced by Theatre Passe Muraille in Toronto and, in the same year, she was featured on the CBC Radio show, &quot;Sounding Off.&quot; In 1995 the Indian Institute of Canadian studies sponsored her tour of Mumbai colleges and universities.

She was London&#x27;s inaugural Poet Laureate, serving from 2010 to 2013 and University of Western Ontario&#x27;s Writer-in-Residence (2009-2010). Kemp runs Pendas Productions.

In 2021, Kemp was commissioned by Brescia University College to deliver their inaugural Women&#x27;s Day Poem. During the university&#x27;s fourth annual Dr. Colleen Hanycz Leadership Lecture, Kemp performed her poem &quot;Choose to Challenge&quot; as a riff on the theme, &quot;Choose To Challenge: Finding Common Ground Through Dialogue.&quot;

== Personal life ==
Kemp&#x27;s left London, Ontario after graduating from Western University. She returned in 2001 and her mother had a stroke. She now lives in London and considers it her home. Her husband, Gavin Stairs, developed vascular dementia and died in fall 2021.

<doc id="462284" wikidata="Q696052" url="?curid=462284" title="Arnold Rothstein">
<text>Arnold Rothstein (January 17, 1882 – November 6, 1928), nicknamed &quot;The Brain&quot;, was an American racketeer, crime boss, businessman, and gambler who became a kingpin of the Jewish Mob in New York City. Rothstein was widely reputed to have organized corruption in professional athletics, including conspiring to fix the 1919 World Series. He was also a mentor of future crime bosses Lucky Luciano, Meyer Lansky, Frank Costello, Bugsy Siegel, and numerous others.

Rothstein &quot;transformed organized crime from a thuggish activity by hoodlums into a big business run like a corporation&quot;, and gained notoriety as the person who first realized that Prohibition was a business opportunity, a means to enormous wealth, who &quot;understood the truths of early 20th century capitalism (giving people what they want) and came to dominate them&quot;. His notoriety inspired several fictional characters based on his life, portrayed in contemporary and later short stories, novels, musical theater productions, television shows, and films, including the character Meyer Wolfsheim in &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot;.

Rothstein refused to pay a large debt resulting from a fixed poker game and was murdered in 1928. His illegal empire was broken up and distributed among a number of other underworld organizations and led in part to the downfall of Tammany Hall and the rise of reformer Fiorello La Guardia. Ten years after his death, his brother declared Rothstein&#x27;s estate was insolvent.

==Early life and education==
Arnold Rothstein was born into a comfortable life in Manhattan, the son of an affluent Ashkenazi Jewish businessman, Abraham Rothstein, and his wife, Esther. His father was a man of upright character, who had acquired the nickname &quot;Abe the Just&quot;. Arnold was highly skilled at mathematics, but was otherwise uninterested in school. 

Rothstein was known to be a difficult child, and he harbored a deep envy of his older brother Harry, who studied to become a rabbi. Abe Rothstein believed that Arnold always craved to be the center of attention and became frustrated when he was not.

As a child, Rothstein began to indulge in gambling, but no matter how often his father scolded him for shooting dice, Rothstein would not stop. In 1921, when asked how he became a gambler, Rothstein said: &quot;I always gambled. I can&#x27;t remember when I didn&#x27;t. Maybe I gambled just to show my father he couldn&#x27;t tell me what to do, but I don&#x27;t think so. I think I gambled because I loved the excitement. When I gambled, nothing else mattered.&quot;

==Illegitimate career==

By 1910, Rothstein, at age 28, had moved to the Tenderloin section of Manhattan, where he established an important casino. He also invested in a horse racing track at Havre de Grace, Maryland, where he was reputed to have fixed many of the races that he won.

Rothstein had a wide network of informants, very deep pockets from some among his father&#x27;s banker associates, and the willingness to pay a premium for good information, regardless of the source. His successes made him a millionaire by age 30.

==1919 World Series==

There is a great deal of evidence both for and against Rothstein being involved in the 1919 World Series fix. In 1919, Rothstein&#x27;s agents allegedly paid members of the Chicago White Sox to throw the World Series to the Cincinnati Reds. He bet against them and made a large profit in what was called the &quot;Black Sox Scandal&quot;.

Summoned to Chicago to testify before a grand jury investigating the incident, Rothstein said he was an innocent businessman, intent on clearing his name and his reputation. Prosecutors could find no evidence linking Rothstein to the affair, and he was never indicted. Rothstein testified:
In another version of the story, Rothstein was first approached by Joseph &quot;Sport&quot; Sullivan, a gambler, who suggested Rothstein help fix the World Series. Rothstein supposedly refused Sullivan&#x27;s proposal but when he received Attell&#x27;s offer, Rothstein reconsidered Sullivan&#x27;s first offer. He figured that the competition to fix the game made it worth the risk to get involved and still be able to conceal his involvement. David Pietrusza&#x27;s biography of Rothstein suggests that the gangster worked both ends of the fix with Sullivan and Attell. Michael Alexander concluded that Attell fixed the Series &quot;probably without Arnold Rothstein&#x27;s approval&quot;, which &quot;did not prevent Rothstein from betting on the Series with inside knowledge&quot;.

Leo Katcher said that &quot;all the records and minutes of the Grand Jury disappeared. So too did the signed confessions of Cicotte, Williams and Jackson... The state, virtually all of its evidence gone, sought to get the players to repeat their confession on the stand. This they refused to do, citing the Fifth Amendment.&quot; Eventually, the judge had no choice but to dismiss the case. Katcher went on, &quot;Thus, on the official record and on the basis of [State Attorney Maclay] Hoyne&#x27;s statement, Rothstein was never involved in the fixing of the Series. Also, on the official record, it was never proved that the Series had been fixed.&quot; Despite the legal case against the ballplayer defendants being dismissed, all eight White Sox players named as trial defendants were permanently banned from playing or participating as coaches in Major League Baseball (MLB) by the newly named first Commissioner, Kenesaw Mountain Landis. Despite all the denials, Katcher noted that &quot;while Rothstein won the Series, he won a small sum. He always maintained it was less than $100,000. It actually was about $350,000. It could have been much – very much – more. It wasn&#x27;t because Rothstein chickened out. A World Series fix was too good to be true – even if it was true.&quot;

==1921 Travers Stakes==
Under the pseudonym &quot;Redstone Stable&quot;, Rothstein owned a racehorse named Sporting Blood, a very popular racehorse in the early 20&#x27;s, which won the 1921 Travers Stakes under suspicious circumstances. Rothstein allegedly conspired with a leading trainer, Sam Hildreth, to drive up Sporting Blood&#x27;s odds. Hildreth entered an outstanding three-year-old, Grey Lag, on the morning of the race, causing Sporting Blood&#x27;s odds to rise to 3–1. Rothstein bet $150,000 through bookmakers, allegedly having been informed that the second favorite, Prudery, was off her feed. Just before post time and without explanation, Hildreth scratched Grey Lag from the starting list. Rothstein collected over $500,000 in bets plus the purse, but a conspiracy was never proved.

==Prohibition and organized crime==
With the advent of Prohibition, Rothstein saw the opportunities for bootlegging and narcotics. Liquor was smuggled along the Hudson River, as well as from Canada across the Great Lakes and into Upstate New York. Rothstein also purchased holdings in a number of speakeasies. He became the first to import illegal Scotch whisky in his own fleet of transatlantic freighters, knowing that high-end booze would be the &quot;chic thing to have.&quot;

With his banking support and high-level political connections, Rothstein soon managed to end-run Tammany Hall to the street gangs. Subsequently, his criminal organization included such underworld notables as Meyer Lansky, Jack &quot;Legs&quot; Diamond, Charles &quot;Lucky&quot; Luciano, and Dutch Schultz, whose combined gangs and double-dealing with their own respective bosses subverted the entire late 19th-century form of political gangsterism. Rothstein&#x27;s various nicknames were &quot;Mr. Big&quot;, &quot;The Fixer&quot;, &quot;The Man Uptown&quot;, &quot;The Big Bankroll&quot;, and &quot;The Brain&quot;.

Rothstein frequently mediated disputes among the New York gangs and reportedly charged a hefty fee for his services. His favorite &quot;office&quot; was Lindy&#x27;s, at Broadway and 49th Street in Manhattan. He often stood on the corner surrounded by his bodyguards and did business on the street. Rothstein made bets and collected debts from those who had lost the previous day. Meanwhile, he exploited his role as mediator with the city&#x27;s legitimate business world and soon forced Tammany Hall to recognize him as a necessary ally in its administration of the city. Many historians credit him as the first successful modern drug dealer.

By 1925, Rothstein was one of the nation&#x27;s most powerful criminals and had forged a large criminal empire. For a time he was the nation&#x27;s largest bootlegger, until the rise of George Remus. With a reported wealth of over $10 million (equivalent to $162 million in 2024), Rothstein was one of the wealthiest gangsters in U.S. history and is widely considered one of the founders of U.S. organized crime.

==Death==
On November 4, 1928, Rothstein was shot and wounded during a business meeting at Manhattan&#x27;s Park Central Hotel at Seventh Avenue near 55th Street. He died two days later at the New York Polyclinic Hospital.

The shooting was reportedly linked to debts owed from a three-day high-stakes poker game in October, for which Rothstein owed $320,000 (equivalent to $ million in ). He claimed the game was fixed and refused to pay, provoking his murder. Gambler George &quot;Hump&quot; McManus was arrested for homicide, but later acquitted for lack of evidence.

According to Kevin Cook, author of &quot;Titanic Thompson&quot;, the poker game was fixed by gambler Titanic Thompson (born Alvin Clarence Thomas) and his associate, Nate Raymond. Due to some complicated side bets, by the end Rothstein owed Raymond $319,000 (much of which Raymond, by secret agreement, was to pass on to Thompson); $30,000 to Thompson; and about $200,000 to the other gamblers present. McManus owed Rothstein $51,000. Rothstein stalled for time, saying he would not be able to pay until after the elections of November 1928, when he expected to win $550,000 for backing Herbert Hoover for president and Franklin D. Roosevelt for governor. Thompson testified at McManus&#x27;s trial, calling him &quot;a swell loser&quot; who would never have shot Rothstein. According to Cook, Thompson later told some of his acquaintances that the killer had not been McManus, but his bag man Hyman Biller, who fled to Cuba shortly afterward. 

In &quot;Kill the Dutchman!&quot;, a biography of Dutch Schultz published in 1971, the crime reporter Paul Sann suggested that Schultz murdered Rothstein. He says this was in retaliation for the murder of Schultz&#x27;s friend and associate Joey Noe by Rothstein&#x27;s protégé Jack &quot;Legs&quot; Diamond.

On his deathbed, Rothstein refused to identify his shooter, answering police inquiries with &quot;You stick to your trade. I&#x27;ll stick to mine&quot;, and &quot;Me mudder [my mother] did it.&quot; Rothstein was buried at Ridgewood&#x27;s Union Field Cemetery.

===Break-up of empire===
At the time of Rothstein&#x27;s death, Prohibition was in full swing, various street gangs were battling for control of liquor distribution, and the carefully constructed political boss structure of the late 19th century had collapsed. Frank Erickson, Meyer Lansky, Bugsy Siegel, and other former associates split up Rothstein&#x27;s criminal enterprises after his death. The already-weakened Tammany Hall had relied on Rothstein to control the new street gangs, and his death finished the corrupt political organization. With Tammany&#x27;s fall, reformer Fiorello La Guardia rose in prominence and was elected Mayor of New York City in 1933.

Ten years after his death, Harry Rothstein, Arnold&#x27;s brother, declared Rothstein&#x27;s estate insolvent and Arnold&#x27;s wealth disappeared.

==In popular culture==

===Theater===
* In 1930, Rothstein&#x27;s girlfriend, Inez Norton, to whom he had left a substantial sum in his will, appeared in the Broadway play &quot;Room 349&quot; by Mark Lindner, which claimed to represent the actual circumstances of his murder.

===Literature===
* Rothstein is referred to as &quot;The Brain&quot; in several of Damon Runyon&#x27;s short stories, including a fictional version of his death in &quot;The Brain Goes Home&quot;. As a newspaper reporter, Runyon came to know Rothstein personally and later covered the trial of his alleged killer. According to historian David Pietrusza, Rothstein was also the inspiration for the character Nathan Detroit, who appears in the short story &quot;Blood Pressure&quot; as well as the musical &quot;Guys and Dolls&quot;.

<doc id="462286" wikidata="Q282102" url="?curid=462286" title="Julius Schwartz">
<text>Julius &quot;Julie&quot; Schwartz ( ; June 19, 1915 – February 8, 2004) was an American comic book editor, and a science fiction agent. He was born in The Bronx, New York. He is best known as a longtime editor at DC Comics, where at various times he was primary editor over the company&#x27;s flagship superheroes, Superman and Batman.

He was inducted into the comics industry&#x27;s Jack Kirby Hall of Fame in 1996 and the Will Eisner Comic Book Hall of Fame in 1997.

==Early life==
Born on June 19, 1915, to Romanian-Jewish parents Joseph and Bertha who emigrated from a small town outside Bucharest, Romania. Julius and his parents resided at 817 Cauldwell Avenue in the Bronx. He graduated at age seventeen from Theodore Roosevelt High School in the Bronx.

==Career==
In 1932, Schwartz co-published (with Mort Weisinger and Forrest J. Ackerman) &quot;Time Traveller&quot;, one of the first science fiction fanzines. Schwartz and Weisinger also founded the Solar Sales Service literary agency (1934–1944) where Schwartz represented such writers as Alfred Bester, Stanley G. Weinbaum, Robert Bloch, Ray Bradbury, and H. P. Lovecraft, including some of Bradbury&#x27;s first published work and Lovecraft&#x27;s last. Schwartz helped organize the first World Science Fiction Convention in 1939. In 1944, while looking for work, he was encouraged by his client, Alfred Bester, who was writing &quot;Green Lantern&quot; at the time, to apply as an editor at All-American Publications, a subsidiary of DC Comics via editor-in-chief Sheldon Mayer, replacing Dorothy Roubicek.

In 1956, after the formation of the Comics Code Authority, Schwartz worked along with writer Robert Kanigher and artists Carmine Infantino and Joe Kubert on the company&#x27;s first attempt at reviving superheroes: an updated version of the Flash that would appear in &quot;Showcase&quot; #4 (October 1956). The eventual success of the new, science-fiction oriented Flash heralded the wholesale return of superheroes and the beginning of what fans and historians call the Silver Age of Comic Books. Schwartz also worked with writers John Broome and Gardner Fox and revived other superheroes such as Green Lantern in &quot;Showcase&quot; #22 (October 1959); Hawkman in &quot;The Brave and the Bold&quot; #34 (February–March 1961); and the Atom in &quot;Showcase&quot; #34 (Sept-Oct. 1961). A character Schwartz created himself, Adam Strange, debuted in &quot;Showcase&quot; #17 (Nov–Dec. 1958), and was unusual in that he used his wits and scientific knowledge, rather than superpowers, to solve problems.

Schwartz first thought the concept of the &quot;Justice League of America&quot; as an updating of the Justice Society and the idea was then developed by Gardner Fox and artist Mike Sekowsky. The new team debuted in &quot;The Brave and the Bold&quot; #28 (February/March 1960), and received its own title in October 1960. It became one of the most successful series of the Silver Age.

Schwartz oversaw the introduction of the Elongated Man in &quot;The Flash&quot; #112 (May 1960) by writer John Broome and artist Carmine Infantino.

In 1964, Schwartz was made responsible for reviving the faded Batman titles. Under his editorial instructions, Broome and Infantino jettisoned the sillier aspects that had crept into the series such as Ace the Bathound and Bat-Mite and gave the character a &quot;New Look&quot; that premiered in &quot;Detective Comics&quot; #327 (May 1964). During the rise in popularity of the Batman comics thanks to the Batman TV Series, William Dozier (producer of the show), pitched an initial concept for a female hero and Schwartz, Gardner Fox, and Carmine Infantino introduced Barbara Gordon as a new version of Batgirl in a story titled &quot;The Million Dollar Debut of Batgirl!&quot; in &quot;Detective Comics&quot; #359 (January 1967).

He helped writer Dennis O&#x27;Neil and artist Neal Adams come to prominence at DC Comics. The duo, under the direction of Schwartz, would revitalize the Batman with a series of stories reestablishing the character&#x27;s dark, brooding nature. Schwartz edited &quot;Detective Comics&quot; until issue #481 (Dec. 1978/Jan. 1979) and &quot;Batman&quot; until issue #309 (March 1979).

From 1971 to 1986 Schwartz was the editor of the &quot;Superman&quot; titles, helping to modernize the settings of the books and move them away from &quot;gimmick&quot; stories to stories with more of a character-driven nature. This included an attempt to scale back Superman&#x27;s powers while removing kryptonite as an overused plot device. This proved short-lived, with Schwartz bowing to pressure to restore both elements in the titles. Schwartz oversaw the launch of &quot;DC Comics Presents&quot; in 1978 and edited it throughout its 97 issue run.

As an editor, Schwartz was heavily involved in the writing of the stories published in his magazines. He worked out the plot with the writer in story conferences. The writer would then break down the plot into a panel-by-panel continuity, and write the dialogue and captions. Schwartz would in turn polish the script, sometimes rewriting extensively.

===Later career===
Schwartz retired from DC in 1986 after 42 years at the company, but continued to be active in comics and science fiction fandom until shortly before his death. As a coda to his career as a comic book editor, Schwartz edited seven releases in the &quot;DC Graphic Novel&quot; line adapted from classic science fiction works by Harlan Ellison, Robert Silverberg, Bradbury, and others. In 2000 he published his autobiography, &quot;Man of Two Worlds: My Life in Science Fiction and Comics&quot;, co-authored with Brian Thomsen.

He was a popular guest at comics and science fiction conventions, often attending 10–12 conventions a year.

==Personal life==
In 1952, Schwartz married Jean Ordwein who had been his secretary. She died in 1986 from emphysema. Schwartz&#x27;s relationship with Jean had been particularly close, and he never remarried or dated following her death. Not many years later, Schwartz&#x27;s stepdaughter Jeanne (Jean&#x27;s daughter from a previous marriage) died from the same illness.

Schwartz died at the age of 88, after being hospitalized for pneumonia. He was survived by his son-in-law, grandchildren and great-grandchildren. He remained a &quot;goodwill ambassador&quot; for DC Comics and an Editor Emeritus up until his death.

==Awards==
In 1998, Dragon*Con chairman Ed Kramer established the Julie Award, bestowed for universal achievement spanning multiple genres and selected each year by a panel of industry professionals. The inaugural recipient was science-fiction and fantasy Grand Master Ray Bradbury. Additional awards, presented by Schwartz each year, included Forrest J. Ackerman, Yoshitaka Amano, Alice Cooper, Will Eisner, Harlan Ellison, Neil Gaiman, Carmine Infantino, Anne McCaffrey, Peter David, Jim Steranko, and Micky Dolenz.

In addition to his induction into both of the comic-book industry&#x27;s halls of fame, Schwartz received a great deal of other recognition over the course of his career, including:

* 1962 Alley Award for Best Editor
* 1972 Shazam Award for Superior Achievement by an Individual in 1972, for bringing the Marvel Family back into print.
* 1981 Inkpot Award
* 1985 Named as one of the honorees by DC Comics in the company&#x27;s 50th anniversary publication &quot;Fifty Who Made DC Great&quot;.
* 1997 Raymond Z. Gallun Award for &quot;outstanding contributions in the genre of science fiction&quot; - co-recipient with Harlan Ellison

==Appearances in comics==
Schwartz has appeared as himself in a number of comics:

*&quot;The Flash&quot; #179 (May 1968)
::In the &quot;Flash — Fact Or Fiction&quot; story (reprinted in &quot;The Greatest Flash Stories Ever Told&quot;), the Flash finds himself on &quot;Earth Prime&quot; (the real Earth that we live on). He contacts the &quot;one man on Earth who might believe his fantastic story and give him the money he needs. The editor of that &quot;Flash&quot; comic mag!&quot; Schwartz helps the Flash build a cosmic treadmill so that he can return home.

*&quot;Justice League of America&quot; #123 (October 1975) and #124 (November 1975)
::In &quot;Where On Earth Am I?&quot; and &quot;Avenging Ghosts of the Justice Society&quot;, Schwartz tasks writers Cary Bates and Elliot S. Maggin with inventing a fresh plot for the &quot;Justice League of America&quot; comic book. Using the cosmic treadmill left behind by the Flash in &quot;Flash&quot; #179, Bates and Maggin are transported to Earth-Two and Earth-One, respectively, leaving Schwartz to cover for their absence when DC Publisher Carmine Infantino walks into his office.

*&quot;Superman&quot; #411 (1985)
::As a 70th birthday present, the staff at DC Comics made &quot;Superman&quot; #411 as a surprise tribute to Schwartz, who was involved in creating what he thought was #411. The cover shows Schwartz in his office being surprised by real-life co-workers just before Superman flies in the window with a birthday cake. The story features Schwartz playing himself as a down-and-out character with a modified version of his real history.

* &quot;Action Comics&quot; #583 (September 1986)
::The cover of part two of the two-part alternate-universe story &quot;Whatever Happened to the Man of Tomorrow?&quot;, written by Alan Moore and begun in the same month&#x27;s &quot;Superman&quot; #423, shows Superman flying away from a number of DC Comics staff, including Schwartz.

*&quot;Superman and Batman: World&#x27;s Funnest&quot; (2000)
::During Mister Mxyzptlk and Bat-Mite&#x27;s rampage in numerous DC Universe realities, they find the &quot;real&quot; Earth and Julie Schwartz working in the DC offices.
*&quot;DC Comics Presents&quot; (2004)
::After Schwartz&#x27;s death, DC Comics issued a series of eight standalone one-shot specials. Each issue featured two stories based on a classic DC cover from the mid-1950s and 1960s Silver Age of Comic Books, reflecting Schwartz&#x27;s frequent practice of commissioning a cover concept, then telling the writers to create a story about that cover. Schwartz or a doppelganger thereof appeared in all eight issues, serving various roles.
*Schwartz appeared as a character in the &quot;Ambush Bug&quot; titles by Keith Giffen, which Schwartz edited.

==Quotes==
Nick Cardy on the popular but apocryphal anecdote, told by Schwartz, about Carmine Infantino firing Cardy over not following a cover layout, only to rehire him moments later when Schwartz praised the errant cover art:

<text>Youlgreave or Youlgrave is a village and civil parish in the Peak District of Derbyshire, England, on the River Bradford south of Bakewell. The name possibly derives from &quot;yellow grove&quot;, the ore mined locally being yellow in colour.
The population in 1991 was 1,256; it is one of the largest villages in the Peak District National Park.

The village has three public houses (the George Hotel, Farmyard Inn and Bull&#x27;s Head Hotel), and a British Legion club.

==Geography==

The village is on the B5056 and the parish has an area of . Youlgrave is at an altitude of located on the southwestern edge of a Carboniferous plateau. It stands on the hillside above the confluence of Lathkill Dale and Bradford Dale. To the east, the geology is shale-like rather than limestone. The area is home to many mineral veins such as fluorspar, galena (lead ore) and calamine (zinc ore).

Three long-distance paths, the Alternative Pennine Way, the Limestone Way and the White Peak Way, pass through the village, swelling the number of walkers.

==History==
Youlgreave was mentioned in the Domesday Book as belonging to Henry de Ferrers and being worth sixteen shillings.

All Saints&#x27; Church, Youlgreave, has a 12th-century font. The main round bowl is carved with decorative motifs, and it has a second small bowl, supported by a salamander corbel. The font was moved to Youlgreave in the 19th century, from the church at Elton. The building is grade I listed.

There are also a number of historic buildings in the village, such as Old Hall Farm (1630), Thimble Hall and The Old Hall (c.1650).

Most of the village&#x27;s households get their water from Youlgreave Waterworks Limited, one of very few private water companies in Britain. It came about when Youlgreave Friendly Society for Women helped to set up a fund to pipe water from Mawstone springs into the village, terminating at the Grade II listed &quot;Conduit Head&quot; of 1829, in Fountain Square. In the 1930s, as new houses were built and older ones were modernised with bathrooms and toilets, water often became short. In 1932 the main underground pipe cracked after an explosion in Mawstone lead mine. Springs at Harthill were connected to the system in 1949 and other major improvements followed. Most homes in the village could be supplied with local water until there were just too many new houses to cope with. Extra supplies are purchased from larger water companies nowadays.

In 1932 five of six miners working on a ventilation fan at Mawstone Mine were killed after an explosion filled the gallery with carbon monoxide. The sixth miner was able to reach the surface and raise the alarm. A rescue party of two workers and the mine manager descended into the mine, but were themselves killed by the fumes. Although Mawstone Mine was eventually closed, a water supply for the village is still obtained from this site.

==Tourism==
Because of its scenic location in the Peak District, Youlgreave is a popular destination for hikers. The Limestone Way passes through Bradford Dale, immediately south of the village. Langley Park School for Boys owns a building in the village, which is used for school trips, students taking part in various local sporting activities and a visit to nearby Alton Towers.

A Guinness World Records Certificate names Thimble Hall in Youlgreave as &#x27;the world&#x27;s smallest detached house&#x27; at × and high. The property made national headlines in 1999 when sold at auction for £39,500. Each room is less than 8 feet square and there was a fixed ladder to the bedroom, a stone fireplace, exposed beams and exposed floorboards in the bedroom. It was home to a family of eight around a hundred years ago. It was last occupied as a dwelling in the early 1930s and is currently being converted into a craft gallery. It is a Grade II listed building.

The Youlgreave Festival, founded in 2001, offers local artists and musicians a chance to showcase their talents.

There are popular walking paths through the valley following the River Bradford.

==Media==
Local regional television is provided by BBC East Midlands Today and ITV News Central. 

Radio stations that broadcast to Youlgreave are BBC Radio Derby on 95.3 FM, Capital Midlands on 102.8 FM, and Peak FM 102.0 FM.

Youlgreave&#x27;s local newspapers are the &quot;Matlock Mercury&quot; and the &quot;Derbyshire Times&quot;.

==Sport==
===Football===
Youlgreave is home to Youlgrave United Football Club (est. 1886) who currently compete in the Hope Valley Amateur League. Their ground is based on Alport Lane Playing Fields, Youlgreave.

===Cricket===
Youlgrave Lodge Cricket Club and ground is based on Alport Lane Playing Fields, Youlgreave. The club have three senior teams: a 1st XI Saturday team that compete in the Yorkshire and Derbyshire Cricket League, a Sunday XI team that play friendly matches in and around the region, and a Midweek XI side.

==Notable people==
Bill Burgess (1872–1950) was the second person to successfully complete a swim of the English Channel after Matthew Webb. He performed the feat on 6 September 1911, his 16th attempt. He was born in Rotherham to Alfred Burgess, a blacksmith from Youlgreave, and Camilla Anna Peat, a cook from Harthill, South Yorkshire. He spent most of his life in France, and won a bronze medal with the French water polo team at the 1900 Olympics. In 1926 he coached Gertrude Ederle who became the first woman to swim the English Channel.

<doc id="462297" wikidata="Q647167" url="?curid=462297" title="Mystic River (novel)">
<text>Mystic River is a novel by Dennis Lehane that was published in 2001. It won the 2002 Dilys Award and was made into an Academy Award-winning film in 2003.

==Plot==
The novel&#x27;s plot revolves around three boys who grow up as friends in Boston — Dave Boyle, Sean Devine, and Jimmy Marcus. At the beginning of the story, Dave is abducted by child molesters while he, Sean, and Jimmy are horsing around on a neighborhood street. Dave escapes and returns home days later, emotionally shattered by his experience. The novel then moves forward twenty-five years: Sean has become a homicide detective, Jimmy is an ex-convict who currently owns a convenience store, and Dave is a shell of a man. Jimmy&#x27;s daughter disappears and is found brutally murdered in a city park, and that same night, Dave comes home to his wife, covered in blood. Sean is assigned to investigate the murder, and the three childhood friends are caught up in each other&#x27;s lives again.

==Film adaptation==
&quot;Mystic River&quot;, the Academy Award-winning adaptation of the novel, was released in 2003. The film was directed by Clint Eastwood and starred Sean Penn as Jimmy Markum (the character&#x27;s last name was changed from Marcus to Markum for the film), Tim Robbins as Dave, and Kevin Bacon as Sean. Sean Penn won the Best Actor in a Leading Role and Tim Robbins won the Best Supporting Actor for their respective performances. It was also nominated for four other Academy Awards: Best Picture, Best Director (Eastwood), Best Supporting Actress (Marcia Gay Harden), and Best Adapted Screenplay (Brian Helgeland).

==Awards and nominations==
&quot;Mystic River&quot; won the 2002 Dilys Award presented by the Independent Mystery Booksellers Association. The same year, it also won the Massachusetts Book Award.

<doc id="462299" wikidata="Q6777418" url="?curid=462299" title="Marty Gervais">
<text>Charles Henry &quot;Marty&quot; Gervais (born 1946) is a Canadian poet, photographer, professor, journalist, and publisher of Black Moss Press. He was born in Windsor, Ontario.

Gervais has also published plays, children&#x27;s books, non-fiction and, a book of photography, &quot;A Show of Hands: Boxing on the Border&quot; (2004). In 1998, he won the prestigious Toronto’s Harbourfront Festival Prize for his contributions to Canadian letters and to emerging writers. In 1996, he was awarded the Milton Acorn People&#x27;s Poetry Award for his book, &quot;Tearing into A Summer Day&quot;. That book was awarded the City of Windsor Mayor&#x27;s Award for literature. Gervais won this award again in 2003 for another collection, &quot;To Be Now: New and Selected Poems&quot;. Gervais has also been the recipient of 16 Western Ontario Newspaper Awards for journalism.

His first published novel, &quot;Reno&quot;, appeared in 2005 from Mosaic Press, and was nominated for the international Three-Day Novel Writing contest. Another book, &quot;Taking My Blood&quot;, charting his time in a hospital, and including photographs he took while he was there, came out in 2005.

In 2006 Gervais and his work were the subject of a TV Bravo episode of the television series Heart of a Poet produced by Canadian filmmaker Maureen Judge.

In May 2009, another book, &quot;Lucky Days: New Poems,&quot; appeared from Mosaic Press. This followed Gervais&#x27; 2006 book, &quot;Wait For Me&quot;, that was launched on the west coast at readings in Victoria, British Columbia, and Salt Spring Island.

In 2009, Biblioasis published &quot;The Rumrunners: The Expanded Edition&quot;. It was a bestseller, and appeared on the Globe and Mail&#x27;s top 10 in non-fiction titles. In 2010, Mosaic Press published another non-fiction title, this one about growing up Catholic. It is called &quot;Afternoons with the Devil.&quot;

In 2012, Gervais was named Windsor&#x27;s first poet laureate. One of his first moves was to invite the newly named parliamentary poet laureate, Fred Wah, to Windsor. Gervais also set up a poet laureate blog to feature the work of aspiring poets. He then visited Prince Edward Island&#x27;s Hugh Macdonald, the province&#x27;s poet laureate, and conducted workshops and readings. In 2012, Biblioasis released &quot;Ghost Road and Other Forgotten Stories from Windsor&quot;. The book brings together a collection of unusual stories from Windsor&#x27;s past. In the summer of 2012, Gervais joined the Windsor Symphony Orchestra to read a poem on stage at an outdoor theatre. It was written specifically to mark the 200th anniversary of the War of 1812. In 2013, Gervais wrote &quot;People of Faith: The Story of Hotel-Dieu Grace Hospital&quot;. At a book launch on the front lawn of the Windsor hospital, he autographed more than 500 copies in less than two hours for the throng who attended to celebrate the book and the founding of the institution.

In the fall of 2012, Gervais introduced what has become the most popular literary event in the city and area — &quot;Poetry at the Manor.&quot; This reading at Willistead Manor, the old Walkerville (Windsor, Ont.) mansion of the Hiram Walker family, proved to be the best setting for this event that brought poets laureate from all over the country to Windsor. The place was jammed with 250 people — standing room only. The event was held in October 2013 with Governor General&#x27;s Award winning poet laureate of Toronto, George Elliott Clarke, reading his work. He was joined by poets laureate from Barrie, Ontario, Edmonton, Alberta, as well as those from Hamilton, Kingston and Brantford.

Earlier that summer (2013), Gervais brought writers together for another reading on the &quot;Tall Ships&quot; that docked on the Detroit River at the foot of Ouellette Avenue in Windsor, Ont. Again, the reading – billed at $40 a person – filled the deck of the ship. Others stood on the shore listening to the readings. It was the highlight of the celebration for the War of 1812 festivities in Windsor that summer of 2013. Gervais&#x27; work was also featured in the spring of 2013 on the popular &quot;IDEAS&quot; program on CBC from readings he did at the Edmonton Poetry Festival, again with poets laureate from all over Canada. Gervais also published a chapbook, &quot;Modest Denials&quot; in 2013.

Marty Gervais was awarded the &quot;Queen&#x27;s Jubilee Medal&quot; in February 2013.

In 2017, Gervais led a group of six other writers as the poet laureate of Windsor to go out into Windsor and write poems about the city&#x27;s heritage. The group called itself &quot;The Group of Seven (Poets)&quot; because they saw themselves, like the famous Canadian painters, as being on a mission of redefining the collective identity of living south of the U.S. border in a border town. The poems, collected in an anthology called Because We Have All Lived Here, were premiered at the opening concert in September 2017of the Windsor Symphony Orchestra with readings from actors between movements of Brahms’ Variations on a Theme of Joseph Haydn. 

Marty Gervais finished out his term as Poet Laureate and was honoured by Mayor Drew Dilkens at Poetry at the Manor in October 2018 before a packed audience of more than 225 at Willistead Manor. Earlier that year in the spring, Gervais put on an event that drew more than 300 to launch new books from Black Moss Pfress, of which he is also the publisher. Black Moss Press is, one of Canada&#x27;s oldest literary publishing firms. It has published more than 600 titles, and has introduced more new authors to the literary scene than almost any other literary press. 

In 2018, Gervais came out with a book &quot;Five Days Walking Five Towns&quot; which records his trek across the five towns that make up Windsor&#x27;s history. It is a book that in the telling cites the historic of the city through storytelling. 

Gervais was Managing Editor of the Windsor Review, one of Canada&#x27;s oldest literary magazines, since 1998 but retired from that in December 2019.

Gervais released two new books of poetry in 2021, A New Dress Every Day, Poems in my Mother’s Voice and also Nothing More Perfect. The poems in A New Dress Every Day were staged virtually in a film made by Taylor Campbell. 

In 2020, Windsor Feminist Theatre produced a play by Gervais called Letters to Grace, based on actual letters from graduates of the former Grace Hospital in Windsor Ontario. These letters were written from leprosy colonies in India, missions in South Africa and from field hospitals in France in the Second World War. The play was also produced and performed in Windsor in August 2021 by the Windsor Feminist Theatre. 

Gervais authored the book Amazing Grace, the history of Grace Hospital. This book was published in 2020 and was launched at Hotel Dieu-Grace Hospital, and more than 200 former Grace Hospital nurses showed up for the gala event.

Gervais, who is married to Donna Wright, and has four children, lives in Windsor, Ontario.

<text>Norman Thelwell (3 May 1923 – 7 February 2004) was an English cartoonist well known for his humorous illustrations of ponies and horses. He was also active as a comic artist, drawing the series &quot;Penelope and Kipper&quot;. 

==Life and career==
Born in Birkenhead, Thelwell spent the Second World War in the East Yorkshire Regiment, having signed up at the age of 18 in 1941, and was art editor of an army magazine in New Delhi, India.

His first published cartoon, in the &quot;London Opinion&quot;, was an Indian subject.

In 1944, he took evening classes in art at Nottingham Art School. A fellow art student, Rhona, became his wife in 1949. They had one son and one daughter.

After Nottingham, he took a degree at Liverpool College of Art, then in 1950, he took up a post teaching design and illustration at Wolverhampton College of Art, but gave this up to work freelance in 1956.

He became a contributor to the satirical magazine &quot;Punch&quot;, who first published his work in 1952, beginning a 25-year relationship that resulted in more than 1,500 cartoons, of which 60 were used as front covers. He also worked as political cartoonist for the &quot;News Chronicle&quot; from 1956 until the paper closed in 1960.

His first collection of cartoons, &quot;Angels on Horseback&quot;, was published in 1957.

Known to many only as &quot;Thelwell&quot;, he found his true comic niche with Pony Club girls and their comic ponies, a subject for which he became best-known, and which led to a cartoon strip about such a pair, &quot;Penelope and Kipper&quot;. He also illustrated &quot;Chicko&quot; in the British boys&#x27; comic &quot;Eagle&quot;.

For the last quarter of a century of his life he lived in the Test Valley at Timsbury, near Romsey, gradually restoring a farm house and landscaping the grounds which gave rise in 1978 to his first factual book, &quot;A Plank Bridge by a Pool&quot;, which detailed the first two lakes he dug there. A third lake was later featured on the BBC&#x27;s &quot;South Today&quot; programme. Written much earlier, but published three years later, &quot;A Millstone Round My Neck&quot; described his experiences in re-building a Cornish water mill (Addicroft Mill at Liskeard, which he called Penruin), which was sold before the book was published. He always loved old buildings, and in his autobiography, &quot;Wrestling with a Pencil&quot;, wrote about his joy in the beauty of old cottages.

In the 1970s, Thelwell also illustrated the front covers of the first six James Herriot books in the series.

== Exhibitions ==
An exhibition of Thelwell&#x27;s drawings and cartoons was scheduled to be held at the Nature in Art gallery in Gloucester, England, from 30 July to 1 September 2019.

<doc id="462311" wikidata="Q29901740" url="?curid=462311" title="Axonometric projection">
<text>Axonometric projection is a type of orthographic projection used for creating a pictorial drawing of an object, where the object is rotated around one or more of its axes to reveal multiple sides.

==Overview==
&quot;Axonometry&quot; means &quot;to measure along the axes&quot;. In German literature, axonometry is based on Pohlke&#x27;s theorem, such that the scope of axonometric projection could encompass &quot;every&quot; type of parallel projection, including not only orthographic projection (and multiview projection), but also oblique projection. However, outside of German literature, the term &quot;axonometric&quot; is sometimes used only to distinguish between orthographic views where the principal axes of an object are &quot;not&quot; orthogonal to the projection plane, and orthographic views in which the principal axes of the object &quot;are&quot; orthogonal to the projection plane. (In multiview projection these would be called &quot;auxiliary views&quot; and &quot;primary views&quot;, respectively.) Confusingly, the term &quot;orthographic projection&quot; is also sometimes reserved only for the primary views.

Thus, in German literature, &quot;axonometric projection&quot; might be considered synonymous with &quot;parallel projection&quot;, overall; but in English literature, an &quot;axonometric projection&quot; might be considered synonymous with an &quot;auxiliary view&quot; (versus a &quot;primary view&quot;) in a &quot;multiview orthographic projection&quot;.

With an axonometric projection, the scale of an object does not depend on its location (i.e., an object in the &quot;foreground&quot; has the same scale as an object in the &quot;background&quot;); consequently, such pictures look distorted, as human vision and photography use perspective projection, in which the perceived scale of an object depends on its distance and location from the viewer. This distortion, the direct result of a presence or absence of foreshortening, is especially evident if the object is mostly composed of rectangular features. Despite this limitation, axonometric projection can be useful for purposes of illustration, especially because it allows for simultaneously relaying precise measurements.

== Three types ==


The three types of axonometric projection are &quot;isometric projection&quot;, &quot;dimetric projection&quot;, and &quot;trimetric projection&quot;, depending on the exact angle by which the view deviates from the orthogonal. Typically in axonometric drawing, as in other types of pictorials, one axis of space is shown to be vertical.

In isometric projection, the most commonly used form of axonometric projection in engineering drawing, the direction of viewing is such that the three axes of space appear equally foreshortened, and there is a common angle of 120° between them. As the distortion caused by foreshortening is uniform, the proportionality between lengths is preserved, and the axes share a common scale; this eases one&#x27;s ability to take measurements directly from the drawing. Another advantage is that 120° angles are easily constructed using only a compass and straightedge.

In dimetric projection, the direction of viewing is such that two of the three axes of space appear equally foreshortened, of which the attendant scale and angles of presentation are determined according to the angle of viewing; the scale of the third direction is determined separately. Dimensional approximations are common in dimetric drawings.

In trimetric projection, the direction of viewing is such that all of the three axes of space appear unequally foreshortened. The scale along each of the three axes and the angles among them are determined separately as dictated by the angle of viewing. Dimensional approximations in trimetric drawings are common, and trimetric perspective is seldom used in technical drawings.

== History ==
Axonometry originated in China. Unlike the linear perspective in European art whose perspective was objective, or looking from the outside, Chinese art used parallel projections within the painting that allowed the viewer to consider both the space and the ongoing progression of time in one scroll. The concept of isometry had existed in a rough empirical form for centuries, well before Professor William Farish (1759–1837) of Cambridge University was the first to provide detailed rules for isometric drawing.

Farish published his ideas in the 1822 paper &quot;On Isometric Perspective&quot;, in which he recognized the &quot;need for accurate technical working drawings free of optical distortion. This would lead him to formulate isometry. Isometry means &quot;equal measures&quot; because the same scale is used for height, width, and depth&quot;.

From the middle of the 19th century, according to Jan Krikke (2006) isometry became an &quot;invaluable tool for engineers, and soon thereafter axonometry and isometry were incorporated in the curriculum of architectural training courses in Europe and the U.S. The popular acceptance of axonometry came in the 1920s, when modernist architects from the Bauhaus and De Stijl embraced it&quot;. De Stijl architects like Theo van Doesburg used axonometry for their architectural designs, which caused a sensation when exhibited in Paris in 1923&quot;.

Since the 1920s axonometry, or parallel perspective, has provided an important graphic technique for artists, architects, and engineers. Like linear perspective, axonometry helps depict three-dimensional space on a two-dimensional picture plane. It usually comes as a standard feature of CAD systems and other visual computing tools. According to science author and Medium journalist Jan Krikke, axonometry, and the pictorial grammar that goes with it, has taken on a new significance with the introduction of visual computing and engineering drawing.

== Limitations ==
As with other types of parallel projection, objects drawn with axonometric projection do not appear larger or smaller as they lie closer to or farther away from the viewer. While advantageous for architectural drawings, where measurements must be taken directly from the image, the result is a perceived distortion, since unlike perspective projection, this is not how human vision or photography normally works. It also can easily result in situations where depth and altitude are difficult to gauge, as is shown in the illustration to the right.

This visual ambiguity has been exploited in optical art, as well as &quot;impossible object&quot; drawings. Though not strictly axonometric, M. C. Escher&#x27;s &quot;Waterfall&quot; (1961) is a well-known image, in which a channel of water seems to travel unaided along a downward path, only to then paradoxically fall once again as it returns to its source. The water thus appears to disobey the law of conservation of energy.

<text>The Qutb Minar complex are monuments and buildings from the Delhi Sultanate at Mehrauli in Delhi, India. Construction of the Qutub Minar &quot;victory tower&quot; in the complex, named after the religious figure Sufi Saint Khwaja Qutbuddin Bakhtiar Kaki, was begun by Qutb-ud-din Aibak, who later became the first Sultan of Delhi of the Mamluk dynasty (Gulam Vansh). It was continued by his successor Iltutmish (a.k.a. Altamash), and finally completed much later by Firoz Shah Tughlaq, a Sultan of Delhi from the Tughlaq dynasty (1320–1412) in 1368 AD. The Qubbat-ul-Islam Mosque (Dome of Islam), later corrupted into Quwwat-ul Islam, stands next to the Qutb Minar.

Many subsequent rulers, including the Tughlaqs, Alauddin Khalji and the British added structures to the complex. Apart from the Qutb Minar and the Quwwat ul-Islam Mosque, other structures in the complex include the Alai Darwaza gate, the Alai Minar and the Iron pillar.
Inside the complex lie the tombs of Iltutmish, Alauddin Khalji and Imam Zamin.

Today, the adjoining area spread over with a host of old monuments, including Balban&#x27;s tomb, has been developed by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) as the Mehrauli Archaeological Park, and INTACH has restored some 40 monuments in the Park. It is also the venue of the annual &#x27;Qutub Festival&#x27;, held in November–December, where artists, musicians and dancers perform over three days.

== Alai Darwaza ==
The Alai Darwaza is a main gateway from southern side of the qutub. It was built by the second Khalji Sultan of Delhi, Ala-ud-din Khalji in 1311 AD, who also added a court to the pillared to the eastern side. The domed gateway is decorated with red stone and inlaid white marble decorations, inscriptions in Naskh script, latticed stone screens and showcases the remarkable craftsmanship of the Turkish artisans who worked on it. This is the first building in India to employ Islamic architecture principles in its construction and ornamentation.

The Slave dynasty did not employ true Islamic architecture styles and used false domes and false arches. This makes the Alai Darwaza, the earliest example of first true arches and true domes in India. It is considered to be one of the most important buildings built in the Delhi sultanate period. With its pointed arches and spearhead of fringes, identified as lotus buds, it adds grace to the Quwwat-ul-Islam mosque to which it served as an entrance.

== Qutb Minar ==
The Qutb Minar is inspired by the Minaret of Jam in Afghanistan, it is an important example of early Afghan architecture, which later evolved into Indo-Islamic Architecture. The Qutb Minar is 72.5 metres (239 ft) high, making it the tallest minaret in the world built of bricks. It has five distinct storeys, each marked by a projecting balcony carried on muqarnas corbel and tapers from a diameter 14.3 metres at the base to 2.7 metres at the top, which is 379 steps away. It is listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site along with surrounding buildings and monuments.

Built as a Victory Tower, to celebrate the victory of Muhammad Ghori over the Rajput king, Prithviraj Chauhan, in 1192 AD, by his then viceroy, Qutb-ud-din Aibak, later the first Sultan of Mamluk dynasty. Its construction also marked the beginning of Muslim rule in India. It was built using red sandstone and marble. Inscriptions record that 27 Hindu and Jain temples were torn down and used for its creation. Even today the Qutb remains one of the most important &quot;Towers of Victory&quot; in the Islamic world. Aibak however, could only build the first storey, for this reason the lower storey is replete with eulogies to Muhammad Ghori. The next three floors were added by his son-in-law and successor, Iltutmish. The minar was first struck by lightning in 1368 AD, which knocked off its top storey, after that it was replaced by the existing two floors by Firoz Shah Tughlaq, a later Sultan of Delhi from 1351 to 1388, and faced with white marble and sandstone enhancing the distinctive variegated look of the minar, as seen in lower three storeys. Thus the structure displays a marked variation in architectural styles from Aibak to that of Tughlaq dynasty. The inside has intricate carvings of the verses from the Quran.

The minar made with numerous superimposed flanged and cylindrical shafts in the interior, and fluted columns on the exterior, which have a 40 cm thick veneer of red and buff coloured sandstone; all surrounded by bands of intricate carving in Kufic style of Islamic calligraphy, giving the minar the appearance of bundled reeds. It stands just outside the Quwwatul mosque, and an Arabic inscription suggests that it might have been built to serve as a place for the muezzin, to call the faithfuls for &quot;namaz&quot;. Also marking a progression in era, is the appearance of inscriptions in a bold and cursive Thuluth script of calligraphy on the Qutb Minar, distinguished by strokes that thicken on the top, as compared to Kufic in earlier part of the construction.

Inscriptions also indicate further repairs by Sultan Sikander Lodi in 1503, when it was struck by lightning once again. In 1802, the cupola on the top was thrown down and the whole pillar was damaged by an earthquake. It was repaired by Major R. Smith of the Royal Engineers who restored the Qutub Minar in 1823 replacing the cupola with a Bengali-style &quot;chhatri&quot; which was later removed by Governor General, Lord Hardinge in 1848, as it looked out of place, and now stands in the outer lawns of the complex, popularly known as Smith&#x27;s Folly.

After an accident involving school children, entry to the Qutub Minar is closed to public since 1981, while Qutub archaeological area remains open for public. In 2004, Seismic monitors were installed on the minar, which revealed in 2005 Delhi earthquake, no damage or substantial record of shakes. The reason for this has been cited as the use of lime mortar and rubble masonry which absorbs the tremors; it is also built on rocky soil, which further protects it during earthquakes.

== Quwwat-ul-Islam Mosque==
The Quwwat-ul-Islam () mosque, also known as the &quot;Qutub Mosque&quot; or the &quot;Great Mosque of Delhi,&quot; was commissioned by Qutb-ud-din Aibak, founder of the Mamluk or Slave dynasty and built using spolia from 27 temples. It was built near the site of a pre-demolished large temple located in the centre of a citadel.

It was the first mosque built in Delhi after the Islamic conquest of India and the oldest surviving example of Ghurids architecture in Indian subcontinent. The construction of this Jami Masjid (congregational mosque), started in the year 1193 AD, when Aibak was the commander of Muhammad Ghori&#x27;s garrison that occupied Delhi. To leave the imprint of his religion to the new territory, Aibak decided to erect a mosque epitomising the might of Islam and chose his site, the heart of the captured Rajput citadel of Qila Rai Pithora. The Qutub Minar was built simultaneously with the mosque but appears to be a stand-alone structure, built as the &#x27;Minar of Jami Masjid&#x27;, for the muezzin to perform adhan, call for prayer, and also as a &quot;qutub&quot;, an Axis or Pole of Islam. It is reminiscent in style and design of the &quot;Adhai-din-ka Jhonpra&quot; or Ajmer mosque at Ajmer, Rajasthan, also built by Aibak during the same time, also constructed by demolishing earlier temples and a Sanskrit school, at the site.
Of the site selected by Aibak for the construction of a mosque, Ibn Battuta, the 14th century Arab traveller, says, before the taking of Delhi it had been a Hindu temple, which the Hindus called &quot;elbut-khana&quot;, but after that event it was used as a mosque&#x27;. Archaeological Survey of India states that the mosque was raised over the remains of a temple and, in addition, it was also constructed from materials taken from other demolished temples, a fact recorded on the main eastern entrance. According to a Persian inscription still on the inner eastern gateway, the mosque was built by the parts taken by destruction of twenty-seven Hindu temples built previously during the reigns of the Tomaras and Prithviraj Chauhan, and leaving certain parts of the temple outside the mosque proper. Historical records compiled by Muslim historian Maulana Hakim Saiyid Abdul Hai attest to the iconoclasm of Qutb-ud-din Aibak. This pattern of iconoclasm was common during his reign. Some medieval Muslim historians and travellers often ascribed the construction of the complex to Mamluk Sultan Iltutmish, rather than to Qutb ud-Din Aibak as is commonly accepted. Ibn Batuta also states that near the eastern gate of the mosque were two very big idols of copper connected together by stones. Every one who left the mosque treaded over them.

The mosque is one of the earliest extant mosques in India. The original dimensions of the mosque had a courtyard measuring by . The prayer hall, located on the west measures by . The mosque has grey colonnades made of greystone with three bays in east and two bays deep on the north and the south. Extensions were made to the mosque during 1296 when its dimensions in north and south were extended by . The famous iron pillar is located on the stone pavement in front of it, while Qutub Minar is located west of the main entrance. The central arch of the mosque is ogee in shape and is wide and tall. The side arches are smaller in size. The screen is sculpted with religious texts and floral patterns. Desai believes that the mosque was not constructed in scientific style but in Corbel style as indicated by the variations in the pattern of the arches.

The mosque is built on a raised and paved courtyard, measuring × , surrounded by pillared cloisters added by Iltutmish between 1210 and 1220 AD. The stone screen between prayer hall and the courtyard, stood 16 mt at its highest was added in 1196 AD, the corbelled arches had Arabic inscriptions and motifs. Entrances to the courtyard, also uses ornate &quot;mandap&quot; dome from temples, whose pillars are used extensively throughout the edifice, and in the sanctuary beyond the tall arched screens. What survives today of the sanctuary on the western side are the arched screens in between, which once led to a series of aisles with low-domed ceilings for worshippers. Expansion of the mosque continued after the death of Qutb. Qutbuddin&#x27;s successor Iltutmish, extended the original prayer hall screen by three more arches. By the time of Iltutmish, the Mamluk empire had stabilised enough that the Sultan could replace most of his conscripted Hindu masons with Muslims. This explains why the arches added under Iltutmish are stylistically more Islamic than the ones erected under Qutb&#x27;s rule, also because the material used was not from demolished temples. Some additions to the mosque were also done by Alauddin Khalji, including the Alai Darwaza, the formal entrance to the mosque in red sandstone and white marble, and a court to the east of the mosque in 1300 AD.

The mosque is in ruins today but indigenous corbelled arches, floral motifs, and geometric patterns can be seen among the Islamic architectural structures. To the west of the Quwwat ul-Islam mosque is the tomb of Iltutmish which was built by the monarch in 1235.

== Iron pillar ==
The iron pillar is one of the world&#x27;s foremost metallurgical curiosities. The pillar, 7.21-metre high and weighing more than six tonnes, was originally erected by Chandragupta II Vikramaditya (375–414 AD) in front of a Vishnu Temple complex at Udayagiri around 402 AD, and later shifted by Anangpal in the 10th century CE from Udaygiri to its present location. Anangpal built a Vishnu Temple here and wanted this pillar to be a part of that temple.

The estimated weight of the decorative bell of the pillar is 646 kg while the main body weighs 5,865 kg, thus making the entire pillar weigh 6,511 kg. The pillar bears an inscription in Sanskrit in Brahmi script dating 4th century AD, which indicates that the pillar was set up as a &quot;Vishnudhvaja&quot;, standard of god, on the hill known as Vishnupada in memory of a mighty king named Chandra, believed to Chandragupta II. A deep socket on the top of this ornate capital suggests that probably an image of Garuda was fixed into it, as common in such flagpoles.

== Tombs ==
=== Tomb of Shams al-Din Iltutmish ===
The tomb of the Delhi Sultanate ruler, Iltutmish, a second Sultan of Delhi (r. 1211–1236 AD), built 1235 CE, is also part of the Qutb Minar Complex in Mehrauli, New Delhi. The central chamber is a 9 mt. sq. and has squinches, suggesting the existence of a dome, which has since collapsed. The main cenotaph, in white marble, is placed on a raised platform in the centre of the chamber. The facade is known for its ornate carving, both at the entrance and the interior walls. The interior west wall has a prayer niche (&quot;mihrab&quot;) decorated with marble, and a rich amalgamation of Hindu motifs into Islamic architecture, such as bell-and-chain, tassel, lotus, diamond emblems.

In 1914, during excavations by Archaeological Survey of India&#x27;s (ASI) Gordon Sanderson, the grave chamber was discovered. From the north of the tomb 20 steps lead down to the actual burial vault.

===Tomb of Imam Zamin===
The Tomb of Imam Zamin is a 16th-century tomb located in the Qutb Minar complex, Mehrauli, Delhi in India. It houses the tomb of Mohammad Ali (popularly known as Imam Zamin), an Islamic cleric who migrated from Turkestan to India during the reign of Sikandar Lodi. The tomb was built by Ali himself during the reign of Mughal emperor Humayun. This tomb has no relation with the other monuments of the complex.

== Ala-ud-din Khilji&#x27;s tomb and madrasa ==
At the back of the complex, southwest of the mosque, stands an L-shaped construction, consisting of Alauddin Khilji&#x27;s tomb dating ca 1316 AD, and a &quot;madrasa&quot;, an Islamic seminary built by him. Khalji was the second Sultan of Delhi from Khalji dynasty, who ruled from 1296 to 1316 AD.

The central room of the building, which has his tomb, has now lost its dome, though many rooms of the seminary or college are intact, and since been restored. There were two small chambers connected to the tomb by passages on either side. Fergusson in his book suggested the existence, to the west of the tomb, of seven rooms, two of which had domes and windows. The remains of the tomb building suggest that there was an open courtyard on the south and west sides of the tomb building, and that one room in the north served as an entrance.

It was the first example in India, of a tomb standing alongside a &quot;madrasa&quot;. Nearby stands the Alai Minar, an ambitious tower, he started constructing to rival the Qutb Minar, though he died when only its first storey was built and its construction abandoned thereafter. It now stands, north of the mosque.

The tomb is in a very dilapidated condition. It is believed that Ala-ud-din&#x27;s body was brought to the complex from Siri and buried in front of the mosque, which formed part of the madrasa adjoining the tomb. Firoz Shah Tughluq, who undertook repairs of the tomb complex, mentioned a mosque within the madrasa.

== Alai Minar ==

Alauddin Khalji started building the Alai Minar, after he had doubled the size of Quwwat ul-Islam mosque built before 1300AD. He conceived this tower to be two times higher than Qutb Minar in proportion with the enlarged mosque. The construction was however abandoned, just after the completion of the first-story core; soon after the death of Alauddin in 1316, and never taken up by his successors of Khalji Dynasty. The first storey of the Alai Minar, a giant rubble masonry core, still stands today, which was evidently intended to be covered with dressed stone later on. Noted Sufi poet and saint of his times, Amir Khusro in his work, &quot;Tarikh-i-Alai&quot;, mentions Ala-ud-din&#x27;s intentions to extend the mosque and also constructing another minar.

== Other monuments ==
A short distance west of the enclosure, in Mehrauli village, is the Tomb of Adham Khan who, according to legend drove the beautiful Hindu singer Roopmati to suicide following the capture of Mandu in Madhya Pradesh. When Mughal Emperor Jalaluddin Akbar became displeased with him due to allegations of corruption and political disagreements, Akbar personally struck him down and had him twice heaved off a terrace in the Agra Fort to ensure his death . Several archaeological monuments dot the Mehrauli Archaeological Park, including the Balban&#x27;s tomb, Jamali Kamali Mosque and Tomb.

There are some Mughal summer palaces in the area: the Zafar Mahal, the Jahaz Mahal next to Hauz-i-Shamsi lake, and the tombs of the later Mughal emperors of India, inside a royal enclosure near the dargah shrine of Sufi saint, Qutbuddin Bakhtiar Kaki. Here an empty space between two of the tombs, &quot;sargah&quot;, was intended for the last Mughal emperor of India, Bahadur Shah Zafar who died in exile in Rangoon, Burma, in 1862, following his implication in the Indian Rebellion of 1857. Also standing nearby is the Moti Masjid mosque in white marble.

<doc id="462319" wikidata="Q965795" url="?curid=462319" title="Stephen II, Ban of Bosnia">
<text>Stephen II () was the Bosnian Ban from 1314, but in reality from 1322 to 1353 together with his brother, Vladislav Kotromanić in 1326–1353. He was the son of Bosnian Ban Stephen I Kotromanić and Elizabeth, sister of King Stefan Vladislav II. Throughout his reign in the fourteenth century, Stephen ruled the lands from Sava to the Adriatic and from Cetina to Drina. He was a member of the Kotromanić dynasty. He was buried in his Franciscan church in Mile, near Visoko, Bosnia.

==Early life==
A member of the Kotromanićs, Stephen II was often labeled a &quot;patarene&quot;, as Bosnian Church &quot;krstjani&quot; were mistakenly identified in contemporary sources (see Bosnian Church).

When his father died in 1314 and Croatian Ban Mladen II Šubić emerged as &quot;Count of Zadar, Princeps of Dalmatia and Second Bosnian Ban&quot;, Stephen&#x27;s mother Elizabeth took him and his siblings and fled with them into exile to the Republic of Dubrovnik. Mladen was not popular in Bosnia and had fought bloody but losing wars against the Serbian Kingdom (under Stephen Uroš II Milutin), and the Venetians (to whom he lost Zadar in 1313), along with numerous internal opponents of his regime. Mladen came to the idea to impose Stephen Kotromanić as his vassal in Bosnia, for he was sure that he would be well accepted in Bosnia. The Šubić, vengeful enemies of the House of Kotromanić now became their protectors. Mladen decided to keep Stephen II under his firm grip and to use him to eradicate the Bosnian Church, so he arranged a marriage between Stephen and a Princess from the family of the Count Meinhard of Ortenburg that ruled in Carniola. The Pope was against the marriage since both families were related, but it would give Stephen certain advantages, so he convinced the Pope to allow it.

==Reign==
===Ascent===
Ban of Croatia, Mladen II, member of the Šubić noble family, became Ban of Bosnia in 1305, following his uncle, who was appointed Ban of Bosnia by his brother Paul I and was killed in fighting &quot;Bosnian heretics&quot; in 1304. Paul I referred to himself as Lord of all of Bosnia in a charter from 1305, but it is doubtful that he held all Bosnia at any time.

Until 1319 Mladen&#x27;s II army had already entirely retreated from Bosnia, as he had found himself stuck in numerous troubles and conflicts with revolting cities in Dalmatia. This disorder greatly helped Stephen II as he gained influence and the chance to rule on his own and build up his realm opened up, all the while his supreme liege, the Hungarian king Charles I Robert, had plans which required Ban&#x27;s help. Charles I went on a campaign to eradicate the Croatian magnates in order to become the sole ruler of the realm. He isolated Matthew III Csák and destroyed the Kőszegi family. The time had come for the Šubićs. Near the end of 1321, he ordered Stephen II to act from Bosnia supported by Ban Ivan Babonić from Slavonia, encircling and isolating Croatia. Stephen II now fell under King Charles Robert&#x27;s direct command. Due to the fact that he wanted to get revenge and get rid of the Šubićs, this was useful to him for the time being, since he could then rule Bosnia uninterrupted without incursions from Dalmatia, and practically entirely by himself as Charles I would be too far away to watch his every move. Besides that, he also got a chance to expand his influence in Croatia. The decisive battle happened near Mladen&#x27;s capital Skradin in 1322, where he was defeated decisively. Mladen II fell back to Klis Fortress and waited for Charles I to come, blindly believing that he would somehow retain his power because of Šubić&#x27;s loyal service during King&#x27;s ascension to tron. However, Charles I came to Knin and invited Mladen to meet him there where he was immediately arrested and sent to a dungeon in Hungary where he died.

===Early reign and other marriages===
Immediately after the death of Serbian King Stefan Uroš II Milutin in 1321, he had no problem in acquiring his lands of Usora and Soli, which he fully incorporated in 1324. He helped his uncle Vladislav of Syrmia to regain all Serbia, but after the fall of Ostrvica at Rudnik at the hands of Stefan Dečanski, there was no more point in supporting him during the struggles for the Serbian throne, so he took Usora and Soli for himself. The hostility caused by this between Bosnia and Serbia would lead to Stephen II Kotromanić&#x27;s war against Dečanski several years later.

When his uncle Vladislav died, he gained some parts of his realm of Syrmia. After this, Stephen II spent the first years of his reign in relative peace. He gave numerous privileges to the local nobility to increase popularity. One of the most famous was the edict in which he gave some &quot;župe&quot;) to Prince Vukoslav. In the edicts he refers to his brother Vladislav with the title &quot;Prince of Bosnia&quot; sharing equal rule with him since 1326, although Stephen had, being Ban, the real rule.

In 1323 Hungarian King Charles Robert wanted to increase influence over Ban Stephen II Kotromanić. He offered Stephen the hand of his wife&#x27;s distant relative, Elizabeth of Kuyavia, daughter of Duke Kazimierz III of Gniewków and received from the King as a gift with the marriage the lands to the west formerly held by Mladen I Šubić Bribirski and Usora and Soli in the north formerly held by Stephen Dragutin and his son, Vladislav II of the Nemanjić. The marriage was legalized by 1339. Up to 1339 Stephen was still married to the daughter of the Bulgarian tsar and had been previously married to a countess of Ortenburg.

===Conflicts in Dalmatia===

The Hungarian king Charles I Robert had asked Stephen II again, around 1323, to join the new Ban of Slavonia Nikola Omodijev and launch a joint offensive against Nelipić in Croatia. Nikola&#x27;s expedition eventually failed, but it did rise up Juraj II Šubić (brother of Mladen II Šubić) against Nelipić, and, eventually, Bosnian Ban Stephen II himself. The movement wanted to return the Šubić to power in Croatia with Juraj II on the throne. When an all-out war broke out between the armies of Prince Ivan Nelipić and Juraj II Šubić in the Summer of 1324, Ban Stephen II contributed considerable support to the Šubićs, without involving his forces into clashes. It turn out to be good move, because the Šubić&#x27;s party was massacred near Knin and Juraj II Šubić himself was captured by Prince Nelipac. Stephen II had attempted to liberate Juraj II from imprisonment, but without success.

Ivan Nelipić immediately pushed the fight against Ban Stephen II, and managed to capture city of Visuća, but Stephen&#x27;s shrewd politics and willingness to bestow his nobility with privileges had paid off, as Vuk of Vukoslavić family had helped him to retake the city. Although Stephen&#x27;s military ambitions were only relatively successful he continued to wage war against the enemies of the Šubić. His target was the city of Trogir which was one of the major supporters of Nelipić&#x27;s campaigning. Stephen adopted a harsh tactic. His forces raided Caravans from Trogir, which eventually forced its denizens to humbly sign a peace and addressed him as the &quot;high and mighty lord Stephen free ruler and master of Bosnia, Usora and Soli and many other places and Prince of the Hum&quot;. It is because of this that Stephen started a conflict with the Republic of Ragusa regarding trade. Stephen was shown as a very tough negotiator and the negotiations finally ended in 1326.

After seeing that Ban Nikola Omodejev was unable to weaken the position of Nelipić, Hungarian King Charles I deposed him. The new man for the job was one of his most trusted men, Ban Mikac Mihaljević. Ban Mikac advanced toward Croatia in the summer of 1325. Bosnian Ban Stephen II sent several squadrons to assist him in his offensive. In 1326, after taking Babonić family cities Mikac advanced deeper into Croatia, where he meet Stephen&#x27;s reinforcements. The expedition eventually had little success, so Mikac sent a portion of his army to Bihać which would serve as defence against Nelipić&#x27;s possible counterattacks and retreated to Hungary.

Ban Stephen II gained territories, expending his realm to the coast by annexing space between mouths of the Cetina and the Neretva rivers, and all in between Bosnia main proper and the coast, namely vast expanses of karst poljes of Livanjsko, Duvanjsko and Glamočko, which will from that point on be known as Završje (also &quot;Western Sides&quot;, ), until territorial reconfiguration under Ottomans. Ban also annexed towns and forts of Imotski, Livno, Duvno, Glamoč, Grahovo. In just a year from this point Stephen II will turn to Zahumlje and annex it for Bosnian realm as well.

===Conflict with Serbia===
By 1326 Ban Stephen II attacked Serbia in a military alliance with the Republic of Ragusa and conquered Zahumlje (or Hum), gaining more of Adriatic Sea coast, from mouth of the Neretva to Konavle, with areas significant Orthodox population under Serbian Orthodox Church and mixed Orthodox and Catholic population in coastal areas and around Ston. He also expanded into Završje, including the fields of Glamoč, Duvno and Livno.

These parts of the province of Hum, that Ban conquered and annexed for Bosnia, were ruled by the Serbian vassalage family the Branivojevićs and their overlord Crep, Stefan Dečanski&#x27;s viceroy for Trebinje and coastal areas around Ston, whom Branivojević attacked and killed. The King Stefan had no desire to defend this family and their lands from Ban Stephen&#x27;s forces claiming their past sins, but in reality he assessed Bosnians to strong for his forces. Bosnia controlled the coast from the border with Ragusa across Neretva to Omiš. Ban Stephen himself killed two members of the Branivojević, while Branko Branivojević fled to Serbia and sought help from King Stefan and then headed to Ragusa, from where he proceeded to Ston. Ban Stephen pursued the chase of Branko, but eventually the Ragusan forces caught the last of the four brothers from the Branivojević. The Bosnian titles included &quot;Lord of the Hum Land&quot; ever after. Ban Stephen became the ruler of all the lands from Cetina to Neretva with the exception of Omiš which was taken by the Hungarians.

In 1329, Ban Stephen II Kotromanić pushed another military attempt into Serbia, assaulting Lord Vitomir of Trebinje and Konavli, but the main portion of his force was defeated by the Young King Dušan who commanded the forces of King Stefan Dečanski at Priboj. The Ban&#x27;s horse was killed in the battle, and he would have lost his life if his vassal Vuk had not given him his own horse. By doing so, Vuk sacrificed his own life, and was killed by the Serbian troops in open battle. Thus the Ban managed to add Nevesinje and Zagorje to his realm.

Although the Zahumljans mostly accepted the Ban&#x27;s rule, some resisted, like Petar Toljenović who ruled the &quot;Seaside&quot; from his capital in Popovo; he was the grandson of the famous Andrija, Prince of Hum. Petar raised a rebellion, wishing either more autonomy or total independence and the eventual restoration of the conquered territories to Serbia. He lost a battle against Ban Stephen II and was imprisoned and put in irons. Stephen had him thrown with his horse off a cliff. Peter survived for a full hour after the fall.

The Ban&#x27;s vassal that governed Hum started to raid Ragusa&#x27;s trade routes, which worsened Bosnian-Ragusan relations that were very high during the conquest of Hum. To make matters worse, he (Ban&#x27;s vassal) asked Ragusa to pay him the old traditional mogorish tax that it traditionally paid to the Hum and Serbian rulers and even asked it to recognize his supreme rule. The Republic of Ragusa refused outright.

===Religious tensions in Bosnia===
The Pope was enraged by the religious tensions that grew in Bosnia, installed Fabian of the Franciscan Order as the Inquisitor in Slavonia and gave him the task of rooting out heresy in Bosnia. The Pope requested Stephen II&#x27;s full assistance. In 1327 the Dominicans and Franciscans argued over who would be granted the task of burning the heretics. Although Fabian eventually took over the leadership over the movement, he utterly failed. Then the Pope wrote to the Hungarian King for a military intervention in Bosnia.

In 1333, Stephen agreed with Stefan Dušan of Serbia to cede Ston and Pelješac to Ragusa in return for the so-called tribute of Ston.

In 1334, the Bosnian Bishop Peter died, and a huge dispute began over his successor. Hungarian King Charles Robert managed to replace his supporter, but it would take until 1336 for the final dispute to be resolved in the Catholic Church&#x27;s favour.

Pope Benedict XII lost all patience and eventually accepted the offer of Prince Nelipac of Croatia in 1337, who not only wanted to restore Bosnia under Croatian control, but also desired personal revenge on Stephen II Kotromanić for the past troubles that he had caused him. The still powerful Croatian Šubićs family protested Nelipac&#x27;s decision. An arranged marriage was made between Bosnian Ban Stephen II&#x27;s brother, Vladislav and the sister of Ban of Croatia Mladen III Šubić, Jelena Šubić in 1338 in Klis Fortress. Mladen III Šubić&#x27;s wife was Jelena Nemanjić, sister of the Serbian King Stefan Dušan, so this created a strong dynastic alliance of three families: the Kotromanić, the Šubić and the Nemanjić that strictly opposed Prince Nelipac&#x27;s reign. The first to fall to Nelipac&#x27;s hand were the Šubićs who were, despite constant help from Stephen II, were forced to sign a peace treaty with Nelipac and compensate him for the war. Charles Robert did not watch easily as his subjected lands were being war-torn. He was preparing to move to Croatia and depose Nelipac. Stephen II seized the opportunity and pushed against Nelipac, talking some of his lands for himself.

Soon, Ban Stephen II would finally stop the constant threat of the Western Crusades to the Bosnian Church. In 1339, during Franciscan General Gerard&#x27;s stay at the Hungarian Court of King Charles Robert, Gerard paid a visit to the Bosnian Ban to negotiate an arranged prosecution of Bosnia&#x27;s heretics. At first, Stephen II thought that it was time to bow to the Roman Catholic Church; but he realised that the neighboring Orthodox Christians might stand up to him if he moved against the Bosnian Church, their allies. In addition, Serbia wanted a reason to involve itself in a conflict, for its King desired revenge for the losses in the Bosnian war against the Serbs, so Ban Stephen abandoned the thought. Nevertheless, Stephen&#x27;s diplomatic efforts convinced the Pope that he was a loyal Catholic in February 1340, once again saving Bosnia.

After the final peace between the Bosnian Ban and the Papacy, the Catholic Church started to grow in influence rapidly throughout Bosnia in 1340–43. The Roman Catholic monks had constructed numerous monasteries in Usora and Hum and baptised a large number of Bosnia&#x27;s heretics on their way to Ston in the Republic of Ragusa. This process eventually brought on the demise of the Bosnian Church that held supremacy over the religious life in Bosnia.

===Changes in the throne===
In 1342, Hungarian King Charles Robert died and so did Stephen II&#x27;s past ally, Mikac of Slavonia in 1343. This gave rise to a new idea. The opportunity arose to detach Bosnia from the Kingdom of Hungary and for Ban Stephen II to rule it independently. He immediately sought help from Hungary&#x27;s greatest foe, the Republic of Venice. In the summer of 1343 he sent an emissary to Venice, proposing an alliance. The Venetians wanted to act only if victory was certain, so they wanted another member in their alliance; their traditional ally, Serbia. The Serbian King was, unfortunately for the Venetians, busy with other matters. Venice was just waging war against Prince Nelipac, so it only agreed to arm and help build up Bosnia&#x27;s military, but begged Stephen II not to move against Hungary without it. It became evident that the Venetians only wanted to push Ban Stephen II against Nelipac for additional support.

In 1344, Nelipac himself unexpectedly died, which prompted Hungarian nobility to ordered the new Slavonian Ban to seize Knin from Nelipac&#x27;s widow Vladislava and her son Ivan. She attempted to negotiate help from Venice, but the Croatian nobility cut off the negotiations. The Hungarian King became impatient, so he commanded Ban Nikola to move to Knin immediately and ordered Ban Stephen II of Bosnia to send help at once. Ban Stephen came leading his forces. A large 10,000 strong Army was amassed near Knin, and this was only the first wave as the main part of the Army was arriving headed by the Hungarian King himself. This time Princess Vladislava Nelipić had no choice but to accept demands. The Hungarian King planned the shape of his coastal territories in the new order that he would create. He annexed several cities from the Nelipić family of Croatia, but left them the two largest until Stephen II gave the Cetina region back. Bosnian ban Stephen II swore an Oath to respect the treaty in front of his &quot;Twelve Knights&quot;, whom he had just formed out of the most valiant and experienced of the Bosnian nobility to assist him in his reign. In the middle of 1345 the new order was ratified in Bihać. The Hungarian King subsequently issued a proclamation in Zagreb accepting Ban Stephen II as a member of his family and returned with his 30,000 men to Hungary before attempting to reconquer the coastal cities taken by the Venetians.

Upon the numerous changes, Zadar switched side from Venice back to Hungary, but their letter missed the Hungarian King during his stay in Bihać, so they had to seek alternative allies whom they found in the Šubić and the Serbian King Stefan Dušan. When it became evident that the Venetians were going to attack, Zadar asked Hungary directly to intervene. The Hungarian King ordered Ban Stephen II and Ban Nikola of Slavonia to move with their forces in assistance. The two Bans moved with their 10,000 man Army to Zadar, only to find out that the Venetians had constructed an improvised wooden fortification with 28 &quot;bastidas&quot; (towers), huge enough to man the entire Venetian army. Deciding not to move against the Venetians, the Bans accepted a bribe of 1,000 florins each, although Zadar had accused them of treason.

The Hungarian King was amassing forces for a new strike against the Venetian positions, but both parties had elected the new Serbian Emperor Stefan Dušan to assist Ban Stephen II and form a mediation party to decide a truce between the two warring sides. Eventually, all agreements failed. In the spring of 1346 the Hungarian King arrived with his vast Royal Army of 100,000 men of whom more than 30,000 were cavalry and men-at-arms and 10,000 soldiers under Ban Stephen II arrived. The Venetians had attempted to bribe several Hungarian generals, including Ban Stephen II, who gave away the positions of the Hungarian troops for a handsome sum of money, thereby earning the nickname &quot;Devil&#x27;s Student&quot;. On 1 July 1346 a fierce clash occurred, which the Hungarian side eventually won only due to numerical superiority and achieved a pyrrhic victory with more than 7,000 Hungarian troops killed in battle. The Hungarian King lost trust in Ban Stephen II and, losing confidence as well, returned to Hungary.

Ban Stephen II played Venice and Hungary against each other, slowly ruling Bosnia more and more independently and soon initiated a conspiracy with some members of the Croatian and Hungarian nobility against his Hungarian liege. In 1346 Zadar finally returned to Venice, and the Hungarian King, seeing that he had lost the war, made peace in 1348. Ban of Croatia Mladen II Šubić was greatly opposed to Stephen II&#x27;s policy, accusing him of treason and the relations between the two Bans worsened ever afterwards. Bosnian Ban Stephen II&#x27;s relations with Venice started to improve, as the Bosnian Bishop Peregreen was a notable Venetian member of the Franciscan Order.

===Continued conflict with Serbia===
The Serbian Emperor Stefan Dušan was constantly demanding that Ban Stephen II Kotromanić return the Hum area to the Nemanjić dynasty, but Stephen II always refused.

Ban Stepen&#x27;s Bosnia was weaker than the Serbian Empire, so he asked Venice, as a mutual ally, to act as a mediator. Eventually the Serbian Emperor accepted a three-year non-aggression pact because he was busy with his conflicts with the Byzantine Empire. The Bosnian Ban immediately proceeded with war preparations and went to construct a fortress in Hum, near the Neretva river. He also attempted to convince the Venetians to give him naval support in the case of war with the Tsar. The Venetians discouraged him from building a fort, but he constructed it anyway. The distant wars of Tsar Stefan Dušan gave Stephen II Kotromanić the chance to move first. In the Christmas of 1349 Bosnia&#x27;s Ban moved quickly, proceeding all the way across Konavli which he raided heavily until he reached the Bay of Kotor. Trebinje, Gacko, and Rudine were razed during his military operations. Venice attempted to make another peace between the warring sides, but the Serbian emperor agreed only to stall his counterattack a little.

In October 1350, Tsar Stefan Dušan crossed the river of Drina with 50,000 cavalry and 30,000 infantry. Ban Stephen II did not have the strength to meet his army in open battle, so he decided to use a guerrilla tactic. Using timber and rock he blockaded all major roads in Bosnia and slowly withdrew his forces to forests and mountains, using impervious topography of his realm and forts to defend against advancing invader. He planned the defense of Bosnia, splitting his forces enough to defend every possible entryway into his realm. His plan soon started to break, as Dušan was able to bribe several of Ban&#x27;s most trusted servants who abandoned their posts.

Losing control over the conflict, Ban Stephen II retreated with his most trusted men to the most unreachable mountains of Bosnia. He no longer knew whom he could trust, so he regularly dismissed and recruited new men to serve him. His older daughter Elizabeth hid from Dušan in Ban&#x27;s court and one of Bosnia&#x27;s strongest fortresses, Bobovac. Dušan&#x27;s forces easily defeated the scattered Bosnian squadrons and went on a campaign to slowly conquer Bosnia. Eventually, Bobovac was besieged, but Dušan failed to seize it which will prove detrimental to success of his campaign. But he proceeded by ordering his armies to raid Bosnia. After creating a strong foothold with forces in Bosnia, Dušan sent a portion of his army on raiding quests towards Cetina and the other to Croatia towards Krka, while he returned with the rest of his troops to Serbia to resolve new conflicts that the Byzantines stirred in Macedonia.

Both failed siege of Bubovac and attempt to catch up with Ban Stephen II eventually compelled Dušan to abandon Bosnia and order his troops to retreat. Ban Stephen II therefore won the war, even though he lost most of the battles. This encouraged the Ban to refuse all suggestions from Dušan to share Hum as joint rulers. Dušan forces that remained in Hum tried to keep at least this region, however Ban Stephen II soon launched a military campaign and reconquered all the territories that he had previously lost to Dušan. The Republic of Ragusa was enraged by the war over the Hum because it greatly damaged their trade, so, backed up by the Venetian Republic, Dubrovnik suggested a peace to Dušan that would constitute a marriage between the Emperor&#x27;s son King Stefan Uroš V and Stephen II&#x27;s daughter Elizabeth. The peace treaty also required the giving of the Hum area to Stephen II, but as a land of the Nemanjić. Stephen II had better plans for his daughter, so he refused the agreement. Ban reasoned that a large multi-ethnic Empire ruled autocratically by one man could not succeed. Politically and militarily savvy Ban, now proved himself foresighted too, as he will soon start witnessing first traces of Dušan&#x27;s Empire demise, while he regained full control over his realm, Bosnia.

===Last years===
The rest of Ban&#x27;s reign passed mostly in peace. The only conflict that he had was a dispute with the Republic of Venice and Dubrovnik since the Ban&#x27;s men had raided their trade caravan. The Ban managed to elevate his supporter, Monk Petergreen as the new Bosnian Bishop. After 1352 Stephen II referred to himself as &quot;Bosnia&#x27;s Herzeg&quot; (or &quot;herceg&quot;) in resemblance of the German title. The same year he gave his sister or niece, Marija, in marriage to Count Ulrich of Helfenstein, which was sanctioned by the Hungarian King. He sent his daughter Catherine (some sources describe Catherine as the daughter of Stephen&#x27;s brother Vladislav) to marry Count Hermann I of Celje, but the actual marriage happened long after Stephen II&#x27;s death.

Elizabeth of Poland, the mother of the King of Hungary, wanted to arrange a marriage between her son and Stephen&#x27;s daughter Elizabeth. She insisted immediately on bringing her to the Hungarian court for fosterage. Stephen was reluctant at first, but eventually dispatched Elizabeth. After three years of life at the Hungarian court, the King&#x27;s mother invited Stephen to Hungary for the wedding. The Bosnian Ban became gravely ill and could not be present at the ceremony.

Stephen II Kotromanić died in September 1353. He was ceremonially buried in his own foundation, the Roman Catholic Church of Saint Nicholas of the &quot;Little Brother&quot; in Mile, near Visoko. He was succeeded by his underage nephew Tvrtko, son of Stephen&#x27;s brother Vladislav Kotromanić, with Vladislav governing in Tvrtko&#x27;s name.

==Edicts==
Stephen withdrew all demands as can be seen in his edict to the Republic from 1332 in which he guaranteed future friendships between the Banate of Bosnia and the Republic of Ragusa. In the edict he called his people Bosnians (&quot;Bošnjani&quot;).

Ban Stephen II issued several edicts to Ragusa in 1333. There were four documents. Here is an excerpt of the documents edict&#x27; copies:


Of 60 words in the excerpt:
* 29 (&quot;48.3%&quot;) are completely the same in contemporary Bosnian — or, for that matter Croatian or Serbian
* 15 (&quot;25%&quot;) differ only in slightly changed sound of a letter (usually through iotation, or loss or it, or by transfer of &quot;ou&quot; to &quot;u&quot;)
* 8 (&quot;13.3%&quot;) differ in one phoneme
* * 8 (&quot;13.3%&quot;) differ more but are fully recognisable

==Title==
*&quot;Lord of all Bosnian lands, and Soli, and Usora, and Donji Kraji, and the Hum land&quot;

==Marriages and children==
He was married to:
* a Catholic lady, a cousin of some sort, dispensation requested in 1318. Possibly a daughter of Count Meinhard of Ortenburg in Carniola (concluded from sources, this remained an engagement only, the couple not having come to live together)
* daughter of Tsar Michael Shishman of Bulgaria, in 1329
* Elizabeth of Kuyavia, daughter of Duke Kazimierz III of Gniewkowo, nephew of Ladislaus the Short, king of Poland, since June 1335.

According to Dominik Mandić he had at least four children.
* Catherine (1336–21 March 1385), who married Herman I of Celje in 1361. She was the mother of Herman II, Count of Celje. Born out of the marriage with the Ortenburg countess (Mandić). She may have been his niece rather than daughter.
* Vuk, who died during his father&#x27;s lifetime. Born out of the marriage with the Ortenburg countess (Mandić).
* Stjepan. Born out of the marriage with Elizabeth (Mandić).
* Elizabeth (1340–1387), who married Hungarian King Louis I the Great on 20 June 1353. Having become the regent of Hungary, she was murdered. Born out of the marriage with Elizabeth (Mandić).

<text>Captain Henry Lockhart St John Fancourt (1 April 1900 – 8 January 2004) was a British pioneering naval aviator, and held important aviation commands with the Fleet Air Arm during the Second World War. When Fancourt died at the age of 103, he was one of the last, if not the last, survivor who had actively been involved in the Battle of Jutland.

== Early life and naval career ==
Fancourt was born in Birmingham, and was the son of general St John Fancourt. He joined the Royal Navy and entered the Royal Naval College, Osborne, in January 1913 at the age of 12. In 1914, at the outbreak of the First World War, like most of his classmates he was sent to sea—in his case, on the battlecruiser HMS &quot;Princess Royal&quot;.

== The Battle of Jutland, 1916 ==
On 31 May 1916, the &quot;Princess Royal&quot; was involved in the initial engagement of the Battle of Jutland. Two of her sister ships were lost (with nearly 2,000 men) and the &quot;Princess Royal&quot; was mistakenly reported as having been sunk. In reality she had been hit twice and was hit three more times later in the battle. Fancourt&#x27;s action station was in the rear gun turret so he did not see much of the battle.

Fancourt was mentioned in dispatches later in the war for his efforts on flotilla escort and patrol duties from Queenstown, Ireland. In June 1919, he was present at the scuttling of the German fleet at Scapa Flow.

== Interwar activities ==
After the war, Fancourt attended Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, to complete his interrupted education. On his return to the Navy he chose to specialise in aviation and qualified as a pilot in 1924 after attending No 1 Naval Pilots Course. The ongoing dispute between the Admiralty and the Air Ministry about naval aviation meant that he held the dual ranks of Flying Officer, Royal Air Force and Lieutenant, Royal Navy.

In 1927, while serving on HMS &quot;Argus&quot;, he took part in the western military buildup in the Far East when European interests in Shanghai were threatened by fighting between the forces of Chiang Kai-shek and the warlord Sun Chuan Fang.

After a tour in , he was assigned to HMS &quot;Courageous&quot; in 1929. In August of that year he took part in operations to restore order in Palestine. Working ashore with the RAF, he flew in support of the Army and Navy and made demonstration flights over Jerusalem.

In June 1931, Fancourt was involved in trials, aboard &quot;Courageous&quot;, of a new system of athwartships arrester cables to catch landing aircraft. He was the first to land using the new system which is now standard on aircraft carriers.

In April 1933, after promotion to Lieutenant-Commander, Fancourt became the first Commanding Officer of the newly formed 822 Squadron. The squadron, formed at Netheravon, flew Fairey IIIF biplanes.

After this assignment he worked in the Admiralty organising the recruitment and training of officers for the expanding Fleet Air Arm. In 1937 the Fleet Air Arm was handed back to the Navy from the Air Ministry. He later served as second in command of the cruiser HMS &quot;Neptune&quot;, then commanded the sloop HMS &quot;Weston&quot;.

== World War II ==
In December 1940 he was promoted Captain and given command of HMS &quot;Sparrowhawk&quot;, the naval air station at Hatston in the Orkney Islands. In January 1941, Fancourt was bady injured when German dive-bombers destroyed the control tower at Lee-on-the-Solent.

In May 1941, he was Mentioned in Despatches for his initiative in sending a Maryland aircraft to reconnoitre for the German battleship &quot;Bismarck&quot; after poor weather had prevented RAF reconnaissance. He also ordered 828 Naval Air Squadron&#x27;s Albacore torpedo bombers to Sumburgh, ready for a strike on &quot;Bismarck&quot; should she come within range, but she did not.

While at RAF Hatston in Orkney in April 1942 Fancourt, flying a Gloster Gladiator, is claimed to have made the first landing of the war by a British plane on an American aircraft carrier when the USS &quot;Wasp&quot; was passing through Scapa Flow, however Lt Basil Boulding of 812 Sqn has a better claim as he landed Swordfish P4219 aboard the USS Wasp from RAF North Front, Gibraltar, eventually disembarking at RNAS Macrihanish prior to the USS Wasp&#x27;s arrival at Scapa Flow and joining Force H.
In 1942, Fancourt had been assigned to take command of the escort carrier HMS &quot;Searcher&quot;, then under construction in the United States. This was cancelled, however, and he took command of the 4th Destroyer Flotilla which consisted of two destroyers, HMS &quot;Broke&quot; and HMS &quot;Malcolm&quot;, assigned to Operation &quot;Torch&quot;, the allied invasion of French North Africa. The destroyers were to land a detachment of American Rangers. The assignment was to enter Algiers harbour on 8 November, land the troops and prevent the Vichy French from scuttling their ships or wrecking the port installations (Operation &quot;Terminal&quot;).

This turned into a disaster when the commandos that landed on either side of Algiers failed to capture the Vichy artillery batteries. These heavily bombarded Fancourt&#x27;s destroyers and &quot;Malcolm&quot; had to withdraw after suffering engine room damage. &quot;Broke&quot;, with Fancourt, penetrated the defensive boom on her fourth attempt and landed her troops. &quot;Broke&quot; was sunk by French artillery later in the day but the crew and wounded were transferred to the destroyer HMS &quot;Zetland&quot;. Fancourt was awarded the DSO for his part in the battle.

In January 1943, Fancourt was placed in command of the &quot;Argus&quot;, now a training carrier. In September 1943, he was given command of the maintenance carrier , which sailed for the Indian Ocean in December 1943 with reinforcements for the Eastern Fleet, later transferring to the British Pacific Fleet.

== Post-war career ==
In April 1946, he was appointed deputy chief naval representative in the Ministry of Supply. He was retired from the Navy in 1951, not having been promoted to flag rank due to his lack of &quot;sea time&quot;, in other words insufficient experience aboard ship. He was embittered by being &quot;bunged out&quot; of the Navy (as he saw it), with just one month&#x27;s notice.

Fancourt joined the aircraft manufacturer Short Brothers and Harland in Belfast, where he worked until his retirement in 1965. While there, he was chief of staff to Admiral Sir Matthew Slattery, a colleague from No 1 Pilots Course.

The final entry in his flight logbook was in 1956, by which time he had logged 1,317 flying hours.

== Family ==
Fancourt married twice (Lillian Marion Osborne (née Parkin); in 1921, divorced in 1960) and Pauline Bettina Mosley (née Kimble; died 2001); he had two sons and two daughters. Both sons were in the Navy - Michael served in the Fleet Air Arm, and Rodney, who predeceased his father, was a captain in the Royal Naval Reserve and commanded London Division RNR. In 1943, Fancourt landed a Fairey Swordfish with Michael, then a 16-year-old Air Training Corps cadet, as a passenger, on HMS &quot;Argus&quot;. This was probably the first father-and-son deck landing.

<text>Saskatchewan Polytechnic (formerly the Saskatchewan Institute of Applied Science and Technology or SIAST ) is Saskatchewan&#x27;s primary public post-secondary institution for technical education and skills training, recognized nationally and internationally for its expertise and innovation. Through program and course registrations, Saskatchewan Polytechnic serves 26,000 distinct students with programs that touch every sector of the economy. It operates campuses in Moose Jaw, Prince Albert, Regina and Saskatoon; and provides a number of courses and programs through distance education.

Saskatchewan Polytechnic maintains reciprocal arrangements with partner institutions, including: Dumont Technical Institute, First Nations University of Canada, Saskatchewan Indian Institute of Technologies, University of Regina, and the University of Saskatchewan.

==Programs==
Saskatchewan Polytechnic offers over 150 programs in applied/visual media, aviation, basic education, business, community/human services, engineering technology, health services, hospitality/food services, industrial/trades, natural resources, nursing, technology, recreation and tourism, and science. In addition, Saskatchewan Polytechnic provides training to apprentices in several trades.

==Campus==

Saskatchewan Polytechnic comprises four campuses in Saskatchewan:
* Saskatoon (formerly SIAST Kelsey Campus), located on Treaty 6 territory. 
:Located at Idylwyld Drive North and 33rd Street East (southeast corner) in Saskatoon, the campus is named for Henry Kelsey, a famous fur trader and explorer. The institute in Saskatoon dates back to 1941 when The Canadian Vocational Training School was established to train veterans returning from the war. The campus contains over of instructional floor space.
* Moose Jaw (formerly SIAST Palliser Campus), located on Treaty 4 territory. 
* Regina (formerly SIAST Wascana Campus), also located on Treaty 4 territory.
* Prince Albert (formerly SIAST Woodland Campus), also located on Treaty 6 territory.

==History==
The four schools that make up Saskatchewan Polytechnic started off as four individual schools. The Moose Jaw Campus started off as the Saskatchewan Technical Institute in 1959. Saskatoon began as the Central Saskatchewan Technical Institute in 1963. Regina began as the Saskatchewan Institute of Applied Arts and Sciences in 1972. Prince Albert began as the Northern Institute of Technology in 1986. On January 1, 1988, &quot;The Institute Act&quot; and the &quot;Regional Colleges Act&quot; amalgamated Saskatchewan&#x27;s technical institutes, urban community colleges and the Advanced Technology Training Centre to form the Saskatchewan Institute of Applied Science and Technology (SIAST). The institution was named Saskatchewan Polytechnic on September 24, 2014.

==Scholarships==
Saskatchewan Polytechnic joined Project Hero, a scholarship program cofounded by General (Ret&#x27;d) Rick Hillier, for the families of fallen Canadian Forces members.

<doc id="462343" wikidata="Q6668674" url="?curid=462343" title="Loki (computer)">
<text>Loki was the code name for a cancelled home computer developed at Sinclair Research during the mid-1980s. The name came from the Norse god Loki, god of mischief and thieves. Loki was based on the ZX Spectrum, but intended to rival the Amiga for video games.

&quot;Loki&quot; followed two earlier, aborted research projects from Sinclair: the 68008-based SuperSpectrum home computer (cancelled in 1982) and the LC3 game console (cancelled in 1983).

== Design ==

According to an article published in &quot;Sinclair User&quot; magazine, Loki was to have a 7 MHz Z80H CPU, a minimum of 128 KiB of RAM and two custom chips providing much enhanced video and audio capabilities compared to the ZX Spectrum, but with a compatibility mode. The video chip, referred to as the &quot;Rasterop&quot; chip, would have blitter-type functionality and three different modes: 512×256 pixels with 16 colours, 256×212 with 256 colours, or 256×212 with 64 colours and two bits per pixel used for &quot;blitter objects&quot;. Comprehensive peripheral support was also claimed, including MIDI, lightpen, joystick and floppy disk. A version of the SuperBASIC language from the Sinclair QL was to be provided in place of the old Sinclair BASIC for the ZX Spectrum and support for the CP/M operating system was also intended. On top of this, the computer would cost as little as £200.

Another Spectrum magazine, &quot;Crash&quot;, poured scorn on the report in &quot;Sinclair User&quot;, dismissing the design as &quot;dreamware&quot; in the opinion of an ex-Sinclair designer they consulted, analysing the implied components and costs, and adding, &quot;It may be fun to dream about Loki, but the fact is that it won&#x27;t appear, and nor will anything like it.&quot; This was the rationale, according to Crash Technical Editor Simon Goodwin:

== History ==

In the aftermath of Amstrad buying out Sinclair&#x27;s computer business in 1986, some confusion arose as to which company had the rights to pursue the project further. Some reports indicated that Amstrad retained such rights, one claiming that &quot;the blueprint is now in Amstrad&#x27;s hands&quot;, whereas others asserted that the Amstrad deal had left the rights to products based on newer technology with Sinclair. Such contradictory interpretations were reconciled in an interview with Clive Sinclair himself, indicating that the design remained in Sinclair&#x27;s hands, but exploitation of the design remained subject to Amstrad&#x27;s control due to the product&#x27;s Spectrum compatibility features. Ultimately, the project was cancelled.

Martin Brennan and John Mathieson, two Sinclair engineers, took the &quot;Loki&quot; concept with them and founded Flare Technology. There they worked on the cancelled Konix Multisystem game console, then later worked with Atari Corporation on the Panther (cancelled) and Jaguar systems. According to Jaguar developer Andrew Whittaker, two other Sinclair employees, Bruce Gordon and Alan Miles, who went on to form Miles Gordon Technology, also used some of the designs in the SAM Coupé.

<doc id="462344" wikidata="Q333808" url="?curid=462344" title="Sir George Trevelyan, 2nd Baronet">
<text>Sir George Otto Trevelyan, 2nd Baronet, (20 July 1838 – 17 August 1928) was a British statesman and author. In a ministerial career stretching almost 30 years, he was most notably twice Secretary for Scotland under William Ewart Gladstone and the Earl of Rosebery. He broke with Gladstone over the 1886 Irish Home Rule Bill, but after modifications were made to the bill he re-joined the Liberal Party shortly afterwards. Also a writer and historian, Trevelyan wrote his novel &quot;The Competition Wallah&quot; in around 1864, and &quot;The Life and Letters of Lord Macaulay&quot;, his maternal uncle, in 1876.

==Background and education ==
Trevelyan was born in Rothley Temple, Leicestershire, the only son of Sir Charles Trevelyan, 1st Baronet, and Hannah, daughter of Zachary Macaulay and sister of the historian Lord Macaulay. He was educated at Harrow and Trinity College, Cambridge, where he was President of the Cambridge Union Society, and earned second place in the first class of the Classical Tripos in 1861. That same year he wrote his &quot;Horace at the University of Athens&quot;, a topical drama in verse, parts of which are said to have offended William Whewell and lost Trevelyan a fellowship. He was a Cambridge Apostle.

==Political career==

In 1862 Trevelyan went out as a civil servant to India, where he spent several years. In 1865 he was elected Liberal Member of Parliament (MP) for Tynemouth and North Shields. At the general election of 1868 he was returned for the Hawick Burghs, which he continued to represent until 1886. When the first Gladstone ministry was formed in December 1868, Trevelyan was appointed Civil Lord of the Admiralty, but resigned in July 1870 on a point of conscience connected with the government Education Bill. He advocated a sweeping reform of the army, including the abolition of the purchase of commissions, and both in and out of parliament he was the foremost supporter for many years of the extension of the county franchise. In the session of 1874 he brought forward his Household Franchise (Counties) Bill, which was lost on the second reading – it was not till ten years later that the agricultural labourer was enfranchised. Among other causes which he warmly supported were women&#x27;s suffrage, a thorough reform of metropolitan local government, and the drastic reform or abolition of the House of Lords. He was also in favour of the direct veto and other temperance legislation.

In 1880 Trevelyan was appointed Parliamentary Secretary to the Admiralty under Gladstone. He held this office until May 1882, when, after the assassination of Lord Frederick Cavendish, he became Chief Secretary for Ireland and sworn of the Privy Council. From November 1884 to June 1885 he was Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster with a seat in the cabinet. In February 1886 he became Secretary for Scotland and vice-president of the Scottish Education Department in Gladstone&#x27;s third administration, but resigned in March over Irish Home Rule. The same year he succeeded his father in the baronetcy.

At the general election of 1886 Trevelyan lost his seat for Hawick. As a representative of the Liberal Unionist Party he took part in the Round Table Conference, and, being satisfied with the changes made by Gladstone in his Home Rule scheme, he formally rejoined the Liberal Party. In August 1887 he re-entered the House of Commons as member for Glasgow Bridgeton. From 1892 to 1895 he was again Secretary for Scotland and vice-president of the Scottish Education Department. He resigned his seat in parliament in early 1897 and retired into private life. He was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1899. In 1911 he was appointed a member of the Order of Merit.

==Writings==

During his stay in India, Trevelyan contributed &quot;Letters of a Competition Wallah&quot; to &quot;Macmillan&#x27;s Magazine&quot; (republished 1864). &quot;Cawnpore&quot;, an account of the massacre there during the Indian Rebellion of 1857, was published in 1865. In 1867 he wrote &quot;The Ladies in Parliament&quot;, a humorous political brochure in verse. In 1876 he published &quot;The Life and Letters of Lord Macaulay&quot; (a second, enlarged edition appeared in 1908), and in 1880 he published &quot;The Early History of Charles James Fox&quot;. In 1899 he published the first volume of a &quot;History of the American Revolution&quot;, which was completed (three volumes) in 1905. In the latter year, as &quot;Interludes in Prose and Verse&quot;, he republished his early classical &quot;jeux d&#x27;esprit&quot; and Indian pieces. He published two volumes of his work &quot;George III and Charles Fox&quot; in 1912 and 1914.

==Family==
Trevelyan married Caroline, daughter of Robert Needham Philips, MP for Bury, in 1869. Their eldest son, Sir Charles Trevelyan, 3rd Baronet, also became a Liberal, and subsequently Labour, politician. Their second son R. C. Trevelyan was a poet and translator. The historian G. M. Trevelyan was their third son. Trevelyan died in August 1928, aged 90. He left unsettled property valued at £556,993 (gross) and £397,492 (net).

He was promoted to lieutenant on 8 March 1782 to serve aboard , taking part in the relief of Gibraltar under Lord Howe, and the subsequent battle of Cape Spartel in October. During the peace he travelled through France, but was recalled to serve aboard , , and then , the flagship of Sir Richard Hughes on the North American Station. On 22 November 1790 he was promoted to commander in the sloop , before finally returning to England in 1793.
Moore was promoted to post-captain on 2 April 1794, soon after the start of the Revolutionary War, with command of the 32-gun frigate , in the North Sea and the coast of France. He then commanded the 36-gun frigate from September 1795. In her he took part in the Battle of Tory Island on 12 October 1798, capturing the two days later. In February 1800 he went out to the West Indies, but was invalided home after eighteen months.

On the renewal of the war in 1803 he was appointed to (44), and with three other frigates – (32), (38) and (32) – under his command, captured a Spanish treasure fleet of four frigates – &quot;Medea&quot; (40), &quot;Clara&quot; (34), &quot;Fama&quot; (34) and &quot;Mercedes&quot; (36) – carrying bullion from the Caribbean back to Spain off Cadiz in the action of 5 October 1804.

Moore was then attached to Sir Robert Calder&#x27;s squadron blockading Ferrol. In 1808, he served as commodore, flying his broad pennant in the new ship assisting Admiral Sir Sidney Smith with the Portuguese royal family&#x27;s escape to Brazil, and was subsequently made a Knight of the Order of the Tower and Sword.

He later served as part of the North Sea fleet for several years. At the close of the Walcheren campaign in December 1809, he was entrusted with destroying the basin, arsenal, and sea defences of Flushing (Vlissingen).

Moore commanded from March 1812, until promoted to rear-admiral on 12 August 1812, and served as Commander-in-Chief in the Baltic for a short time, flying his flag in . In 1814 he served as captain of the fleet to Lord Keith in the Channel, and, having been appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath on 2 January 1815, he became second-in-command, Mediterranean Fleet in 1815. He joined the Board of Admiralty as First Naval Lord in the Liverpool ministry in May 1816.

He was Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean Fleet between 1820 and 1823 and was advanced to Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath on 11 March 1836. Promoted to full admiral on 10 January 1837, he served as Commander-in-Chief, Plymouth from 1839 to 1842 flying his flag in .
Moore died at his home, Brook Farm, Cobham, Surrey, on 25 November 1843, and was buried at St. Andrew&#x27;s Church.

==Family==
In 1812 he married Dora Eden, daughter of Thomas Eden, and niece of William Eden, 1st Baron Auckland; they had one son, Captain John Moore, RN (d. 1866).

==Diary==
Moore kept a detailed diary from 1784 until 1843, comprising thirty-four volumes, which provide a unique account of his service as a lieutenant, commander and captain. The diary is held at Cambridge University Library.

==Namesakes==
Several places were named in his honour: the Sir Graham Moore Islands, Cape Graham Moore, and Graham Moore Bay, in northern Canada were named by William Parry, while the Sir Graham Moore Islands, Western Australia, were named by Phillip Parker King.

<doc id="462355" wikidata="Q86203" url="?curid=462355" title="Peter C. Newman">
<text>Peter Charles Newman (born Petr Karel Neumann; May 10, 1929 – September 7, 2023) was a Canadian journalist, editor and author. He interviewed and wrote about every Canadian prime minister from Louis St. Laurent (1948–1957) to Paul Martin (2003–2006). His three-volume series on &quot;The Canadian Establishment&quot; helped set new standards for business reporting, while his three-volume history of the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company provided a comprehensive account of Canada&#x27;s early beginnings as an international fur-trading nation.

Newman served as editor-in-chief at both the &quot;Toronto Star&quot; and &quot;Maclean&#x27;s,&quot; the latter of which he transformed from a money-losing monthly magazine into a lively newsweekly that published some of the country&#x27;s most talented journalists.

His half-dozen literary awards include the Drainie-Taylor Biography Prize for his 2004 autobiography &quot;Here Be Dragons: Telling Tales of People, Passion and Power&quot;.

In 1990, when Newman was promoted to the rank of Companion of the Order of Canada, his citation read: &quot;Chronicler of our past and interpreter of our present, his popular histories and biographies continue to capture the imagination, bringing to life people, places and events that have shaped our great country.&quot;

==Early life==
Born in Vienna, Austria, in 1929, Newman immigrated to Canada from Nazi-occupied Czechoslovakia Oskar Karel Neumann, a wealthy self-made factory owner. The family escaped German dive bombing at Biarritz in France as they left Europe and U-boat attacks on their convoy before they arrived at Pier 21 in Halifax in September 1940. He was educated at Upper Canada College, where he was a member of Seaton&#x27;s House, and the University of Toronto. Newman joined the Royal Canadian Navy reserve in 1947 as an ordinary seaman and later reached the rank of captain, having served in the naval reserve for 50 years.

==Career==
Newman was a reporter for the &quot;Financial Post&quot;, served as editor of the &quot;Toronto Star&quot;, and was the long-time editor of &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot;, stewarding its transformation from a general interest magazine to a weekly news magazine. In 1978 he was made an Officer of the Order of Canada (OC), and was promoted to the rank of Companion (CC) in 1990.

Newman was widely respected for his intimate knowledge and understanding of Canadian business leaders. Newman made his name as an author in the 1960s with the publication of two books: &quot;Renegade in Power: The Diefenbaker Years&quot; (1963), a study of the government of John Diefenbaker that some say helped destroy the Tory leader&#x27;s career, and &quot;The Distemper of Our Times&quot; (1968), an examination of Canadian politics during the era of Lester Pearson. His 1975 book &quot;The Canadian Establishment&quot; was widely acclaimed.

On September 12, 2005, Newman announced the publication of &quot;The Secret Mulroney Tapes: Unguarded Confessions of a Prime Minister&quot;, a biography of former Canadian prime minister Brian Mulroney, whom he considered a friend. The information released to the press contained several surprising revelations, including an allegation by Mulroney that Pierre Trudeau&#x27;s contribution &quot;was not to build Canada but to destroy it.&quot; Later the same day, Mulroney issued a press release stating he felt &quot;devastated&quot; and &quot;betrayed&quot; by the publication of information he had understood to be confidential. Shortly after the publication of &quot;The Secret Mulroney Tapes&quot;, both Mulroney and Conrad Black filed suit against Newman. The lawsuit was settled the following year.

In 1973, Newman described his &quot;ideological swing… away from a blind acceptance of the &#x27;small-l&#x27; liberalism of the Fifties to a strongly-felt nationalism.&quot;

He was appointed visiting professor of distinction at Ryerson University in Toronto in December 2009. In October 2012, he joined the faculty of the Royal Military College of Canada as its first journalist-in-residence. In this role, he was involved with RMC&#x27;s graduate and undergraduate programs and gave lectures on topics relating to business, politics and history.

==Personal life==
Newman was married four times, once to writer Christina McCall. He lived with his fourth wife, Alvy (Bjorklund) Newman, in Belleville, Ontario. He died from complications of Parkinson&#x27;s disease and a stroke at a hospital in Belleville on September 7, 2023, at the age of 94.

<text>The silvereye or wax-eye (Zosterops lateralis), also known by its Māori name tauhou, is a very small omnivorous passerine bird of the south-west Pacific. In Australia and New Zealand its common name is sometimes white-eye, but this name is more commonly used to refer to all members of the genus &quot;Zosterops&quot;, or the entire family Zosteropidae.

In New Zealand, the silvereye was first recorded in 1832. It arrived in greater numbers in 1856, and it is assumed that a migrating flock was swept eastwards by a storm. As an apparently self-introduced bird it is protected as a native New Zealand species. Its Māori name, , means &quot;stranger&quot; or more literally, &quot;new arrival&quot;.

==Taxonomy==
The silvereye was first described by the English ornithologist John Latham in 1801 under the binomial name &quot;Sylvia lateralis&quot;.
There are 17 subspecies:

* &quot;Z. l. chlorocephalus&quot; A. J. Campbell &amp; S. A. White, 1910 (Capricorn silvereye)– Capricorn and Bunker Group, central Queensland, Australia
* &quot;Z. l. chloronotus&quot; Gould, 1841 (western silvereye) – south-west Western Australia from Carnarvon southwards coastally and subcoastally to South Australia at the head of the Great Australian Bight
* &quot;Z. l. cornwalli&quot; Mathews, 1912 – east-central and south-east Queensland to north-east New South Wales
* &quot;Z. l. flaviceps&quot; Peale, 1848 – Fiji
* &quot;Z. l. griseonota&quot; G. R. Gray, 1859 – New Caledonia
* &quot;Z. l. lateralis&quot; (Latham, 1801) – Flinders Island, Tasmania; Norfolk Island; New Zealand and Chatham Islands; also a non-breeding migrant to continental south-eastern Australia
* &quot;Z. l. macmillani&quot; Mayr, 1937 – Tanna and Aniwa Islands (southern Vanuatu) 
* &quot;Z. l. melanops&quot; G. R. Gray, 1860 – Lifou, Loyalty Islands, New Caledonia
* &quot;Z. l. nigrescens&quot; F. Sarasin, 1913 – Loyalty Islands, New Caledonia
* &quot;Z. l. ochrochrous&quot; Schodde &amp; Mason, 1999 – King Island, Tasmania
* &quot;Z. l. pinarochrous&quot; Schodde &amp; Mason, 1999 – south-east South Australia, south-west New South Wales and western Victoria
* &quot;Z. l. tephropleurus&quot; Gould, 1855 (Lord Howe silvereye) – Lord Howe Island
* &quot;Z. l. tropicus&quot; Mees, 1969 – Torres Islands and Banks Islands (except Mota Lava), and Malo and Espíritu Santo, north-west Vanuatu
* &quot;Z. l. valuensis&quot; Murphy &amp; Mathews, 1929 – Mota Lava, Banks Islands, Vanuatu
* &quot;Z. l. vatensis&quot; Tristram, 1879 – central and southern Vanuatu
* &quot;Z. l. vegetus&quot; E. J. O. Hartert, 1899 – north-east Queensland
* &quot;Z. l. westernensis&quot; (Quoy &amp; Gaimard, 1830) – south-east New South Wales to eastern Victoria

==Description==

A small bird 11 to 13 cm in length and around 10 g in weight, it has a conspicuous ring of white feathers around its eye. There are a number of plumage variations depending on the sub-species. Generally it has olive-green wings and either a grey or olive-green back, a lighter coloured throat - yellow or grey, flanks that range from chestnut to pale buff, and an undertail that may be white or yellow. Within Australia there are seasonal migrations and the ranges of the sub-species overlap. The other islands within its range tend to host only a single sub-species each so only one plumage variant is seen.

The sperm of &quot;Zosterops lateralis&quot; exhibits a head measuring 13.01 μm, a midpiece of 52.75 μm, a flagellum extending to 56.69 μm, resulting in a total length of 69.71 μm.

==Distribution and habitat==

The silvereye is native to Australia, New Zealand and the south-west Pacific islands of Lord Howe, New Caledonia, Loyalty Islands, Vanuatu, and Fiji. It is common to abundant throughout the relatively fertile south-west and south-east parts of Australia (including Tasmania and the Bass Strait islands), and through the well-watered coastal zone of tropical Queensland, including Cape York Peninsula

The silvereye is liable to be found in any vegetated area, apart from open grasslands, within its distribution range, including forest, scrub, horticultural blocks and urban gardens.

== Feeding ==
The silvereye feeds on insect prey and large amounts of fruit and nectar, making them occasional pests of commercial orchards.

==Behaviour==

Silvereyes breed in spring and early summer (mainly between September and December), making a tiny cup of grass, moss, hair, spiderweb, and thistledown, suspended from a branch fork in the outer reaches of small trees or shrubs. They lay two to four pale blue eggs, and two (or sometimes three) broods may be raised during each breeding season. The eggs hatch after about 11 days, and the young fledge after another 10 days. The juveniles are independent at 3 weeks and able to breed at 9 months.

In late summer silvereyes gather into flocks and many Australian birds migrate, making their way north along the coast and ranges, foraging busily during the day with much calling and quick movement through the shrubbery, then flying long distances through the night. Partial migration in the silvereye might be partly controlled by genetics, as allelic variation at the CLOCK gene is associated with migratory status.

Most of the Tasmanian population crosses the Bass Strait (an astonishing feat for 12 cm birds weighing only a few grams) and disperses into Victoria, New South Wales, and south-eastern Queensland. The populations of these areas tend to head further north; while the northernmost birds remain resident all year round. In western Australia they have been recorded moving between the mainland and offshore islands.

Silvereyes are omnivorous with a diet that includes insects, berries, fruit and nectar. In New Zealand they take fruit from native trees including kahikatea, and rimu. When food is scarce in winter they will take a wide variety of foods from bird tables, ranging from sugar water through bread and cooked meats, to solid lumps of fat.

==Relationship with humans==

===Horticulture===
They perform a valuable service in gardens and orchards, eating insects harmful to produce, including aphids, scale insects, and the diamondback moth. However, some orchardists, grape growers and home gardeners regard them as a serious pest particularly as, being so small, they simply ignore bird nets, popping in and out through the netting at will. They are attracted to a wide range of fruit species, including apples, citrus, feijoas, figs, grapes, pears and persimmons.

===In literature===
A silvereye features as the main character, Honey, in the illustrated children&#x27;s books &quot;Honey and Bear&quot;, &quot;Special Days with Honey and Bear&quot; and &quot;The Honey and Bear Stories&quot;, by Ursula Dubosarsky and illustrated by Ron Brooks. In Brooks&#x27; 2010 memoir &quot;Drawn from the Heart&quot; he describes how he was inspired by a silvereye he saw in his Tasmanian garden - &quot;those large silver rings with a fine black line around the outer edge, right round the eyes ... She&#x27;s perfect, I thought. That&#x27;s her! That&#x27;s Honey.&quot;

<doc id="462365" wikidata="Q611487" url="?curid=462365" title="Bullfrog Productions">
<text>Bullfrog Productions Limited was a British video game developer based in Guildford, England. Founded in 1987 by Peter Molyneux and Les Edgar, the company gained recognition in 1989 for their third release, &quot;Populous&quot;, and is also well known for titles such as &quot;Theme Park&quot;, &quot;Theme Hospital&quot;, &quot;Magic Carpet&quot;, &quot;Syndicate&quot; and &quot;Dungeon Keeper&quot;. Bullfrog&#x27;s name was derived from an ornament in the offices of Edgar&#x27;s and Molyneux&#x27;s other enterprise, Taurus Impact Systems, Bullfrog&#x27;s precursor where Molyneux and Edgar were developing business software. Bullfrog Productions was founded as a separate entity after Commodore mistook Taurus for a similarly named company.

Electronic Arts, Bullfrog&#x27;s publisher, acquired the studio in January 1995. Molyneux had become an Electronic Arts vice-president and consultant in 1994, after EA purchased a significant share of Bullfrog. Molyneux&#x27;s last project with Bullfrog was &quot;Dungeon Keeper&quot;, and as a result of his dissatisfaction of the corporate aspects of his position, he left the company in July 1997 to found Lionhead Studios. Others would follow him to Lionhead, and some founded their own companies, such as Mucky Foot Productions. After Molyneux&#x27;s departure, Electronic Arts&#x27; control over Bullfrog caused several projects to be cancelled. Bullfrog was merged into EA UK in 2001 and ceased to exist as a separate entity. Bullfrog titles have been looked upon as a standard for comparison and have spawned numerous spiritual sequels.

== History ==

=== Background, founding, and early years (1982–1989) ===
In 1982, entrepreneur Peter Molyneux met Les Edgar at an audio electronics shop called PJ Hi-Fi. When Molyneux left the company where he was working, Edgar suggested that they start a new one, which would later develop business software for the Commodore 64 as Taurus Impact Systems (also known as Taurus Software). The new company was named after Molyneux and Edgar&#x27;s shared astrological sign, the Taurus. At some point, Molyneux accepted a deal to export money systems to Switzerland and baked beans to the Middle East.

One day, Taurus received a call from the head of Commodore Europe, wanting to discuss the future of the Amiga and Taurus&#x27; software&#x27;s suitability for the system. Molyneux was invited to Commodore Europe&#x27;s headquarters, where he was offered several Amiga systems and a space at a show in Germany. When Molyneux was told that they were anticipating getting his network running on the Amiga, he realised that they had mistaken his company for one called Torus, a producer of networking systems. Molyneux wanted the Amiga systems, so he did not inform Commodore of this error. He received them and began writing a database program called Acquisition. Commodore kept asking about the database, and Molyneux gave them excuses because they were threatening to shut Taurus down. When Acquisition was finished, it was shown at the exhibition in Germany, and won product of the year. 2,000 copies were sold to a company in the United States, giving Molyneux and Edgar funds to sustain Taurus.

Another program Taurus wrote was a computer-aided design (CAD) package called X-CAD. They knew the Amiga was becoming a gaming machine, and a friend of Molyneux&#x27;s asked him to convert &quot;Druid II: Enlightenment&quot; from the Commodore 64 to the Amiga. According to Edgar, it was around this time Bullfrog was founded in preparation for the day when Acquisition was no longer important and they could focus on games. Bullfrog was originally a brand of Taurus; Molyneux explained that this was because they wanted to avoid confusion over business software and money-making opportunities.

The name came from an ornament of a bullfrog located in the office: when asked by &quot;Joystick&quot; why the name &quot;Bullfrog&quot; was chosen, Molyneux stated that they wanted &quot;an idiotic name&quot; without having to find one, and there happened to be a sculpture of a colourful frog on a pedestal labelled &quot;Bull Frog by Leonardo&quot; on the table. Afterwards, Molyneux and Edgar were running out of money, and Edgar suggested they close the company down. It was at this point when Molyneux came up with the idea of &quot;Populous&quot;. The conversion of &quot;Druid II: Enlightenment&quot;, &quot;Populous&quot;, and a shoot &#x27;em up game called &quot;Fusion&quot; were the first games developed under the Bullfrog brand.

=== Early success (1989–1995) ===
&quot;Populous&quot; was difficult to publish at first due to a lack of recognition—the god genre was, according to Bullfrog, &quot;misunderstood by everyone&quot;. Despite this, Electronic Arts was willing to publish the game. Molyneux did not expect it to be successful, yet in 1989, the game received 10 awards, and another 12 the following year, with sales reaching one million copies. It ultimately sold four million copies. Edgar took note of the game&#x27;s success and gave developers such as Imagineer licences to create ports for platforms such as the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES) and Sega Mega Drive, which enabled the game to gain traction in Japan.

After &quot;Populous&quot;, Bullfrog moved into the Surrey Research Park in Guildford and had around 20 employees. Bullfrog was starting to gain a reputation, so people started to want to work for the company. Molyneux searched for staff himself, and employed artists and programmers. He travelled to universities, including Cambridge, where he offered computer scientists and banks the chance to come to the gaming industry.

Bullfrog&#x27;s &quot;Powermonger&quot; was developed as a result of pressure from Electronic Arts for a follow-up to &quot;Populous&quot;. and was released in 1990. The game won multiple Best Strategy Game awards, including one from &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; (as did &quot;Populous&quot;). The direct sequel to &quot;Populous&quot;, &quot;Populous II: Trials of the Olympian Gods&quot;, was released the following year and sold over a million copies. In late 1993, Bullfrog worked with researchers from the University of Surrey, who were nearby their offices, to study the movement and behaviour of underwater life so Bullfrog could reproduce it in the game &quot;Creation&quot;.

By the mid-1990s, Bullfrog had become well known for innovation and quality. A 1995 article in &quot;GamePro&quot; stated that &quot;Bullfrog&#x27;s work has been termed some of the most innovative by industry leaders, and it&#x27;s pioneered different genres of software.&quot; The same year, &quot;Next Generation&quot; similarly asserted that &quot;Bullfrog has earned a reputation as one of the most consistently innovative and imaginative development teams in the world.&quot; In July 1995, &quot;Edge&quot; stated that Bullfrog had &quot;an unparalleled reputation for quality and innovation&quot;, and by that year, Bullfrog were &quot;rightly considered one of the most innovative in the world&quot;, according to &quot;GamesTM&quot;.

In 1994, three games were in development: &quot;Creation&quot;, &quot;Theme Park&quot;, and &quot;Magic Carpet&quot;. Bullfrog focused on implementing multiplayer in all three games; Molyneux believed that multiplayer was more important than the compact disc (CD) format. &quot;Theme Park&quot; and &quot;Magic Carpet&quot; were released that year, the latter being the best-selling CD game that Christmas and winning Game of the Year awards in the United Kingdom and Germany. &quot;Theme Park&quot; proved popular in Japan and was a best-seller in Europe. During the development of &quot;Theme Park&quot;, artist Gary Carr left Bullfrog following a disagreement with Molyneux on the game: Molyneux wanted gaily coloured graphics that would appeal to the Japanese market, but Carr disapproved, believing it would not work. Carr joined The Bitmap Brothers, returning to Bullfrog in 1995 to work on &quot;Dungeon Keeper&quot;, although he ended up working as the lead artist on &quot;Theme Hospital&quot; instead.

In November 1994, Bullfrog began development for &quot;Dungeon Keeper&quot;. By then, the company had been approached many times to develop games around film licences. McDonald&#x27;s approached Bullfrog at some point for a joint game venture. By mid-1995, Bullfrog was focused on artificial intelligence (AI) and had a dedicated AI team working at its offices. Two AI techniques, Personality Mapping and Skeletal Mapping, were developed.

=== Acquisition by Electronic Arts and Molyneux&#x27;s departure (1995–1998) ===
According to Edgar, Bullfrog began merger talks with Electronic Arts in 1993. To get the best deal, he believed Bullfrog should also talk with other companies such as Sony and Virgin. He explained that Electronic Arts was the obvious choice as Bullfrog already had a positive relationship with them. According to Molyneux, Bullfrog received numerous offers expressing interest in purchasing the company. The offers were not taken seriously until major companies, such as Electronic Arts and Philips, made contact; it was then thought that the acquisition by one of these companies would be inevitable. Bullfrog was bought by Electronic Arts in early January 1995. The rumored price of the acquisition was $44 million(£29 million). By this time, the studio&#x27;s staff count had risen from 35 to 60 and the acquisition allowed it to grow to 150 people within months. Molyneux became a vice-president of Electronic Arts and head of their European branch. Edgar became the vice-president of the European branch and Bullfrog&#x27;s chairman. He described Bullfrog becoming part of a multinational company as &quot;a very big change&quot; and worked for Electronic Arts to assist with the transition. Although Molyneux had said that Bullfrog&#x27;s products would not suffer as a result of Electronic Arts&#x27; purchase, the number of games in development meant that there was less time to refine them (despite the company&#x27;s growth rate), affecting their quality.

After the release of &quot;Magic Carpet&quot; in 1994, seven games were in development: &quot;Magic Carpet 2&quot;, &quot;Theme Hospital&quot;, &quot;The Indestructibles&quot;, &quot;Syndicate Wars&quot;, &quot;Gene Wars&quot;, &quot;Creation&quot;, and &quot;Dungeon Keeper&quot;. After Electronic Arts&#x27; purchase, Molyneux was told to release a game, namely &quot;Magic Carpet 2&quot; or &quot;Dungeon Keeper&quot;, within six weeks. Neither was near completion, so to appease Electronic Arts, &quot;Hi-Octane&quot; was created. It had a rushed development and no name by July 1995. Molyneux explained that Bullfrog&#x27;s games were normally original, and they were not concerned about them being copied, but the project was &quot;a little derivative&quot;, which was why it was kept secret—even Edgar was not informed of the project at first. Around this time, Bullfrog had a reputation for having largely ignored 16-bit game consoles, and &quot;Syndicate Wars&quot; was the company&#x27;s first title originally developed for a console—the PlayStation.

As Molyneux had been made vice-president of Electronic Arts, his corporate role and responsibility increased considerably and he began making frequent trips to San Francisco. Over time, he grew increasingly frustrated with the position and wished to return to game development. In July 1996, Molyneux decided to resign from Bullfrog to focus on game design, rather than become a mere employee. In response, Electronic Arts banned him from its offices, forcing him to move development of &quot;Dungeon Keeper&quot; to his house. Molyneux speculated that this was because Electronic Arts feared that he would take people with him. He decided to leave as soon as &quot;Dungeon Keeper&quot; was finished and commented: &quot;My last day will be the day that this game goes into final test. I&#x27;m very, very, very sad, but also very relieved.&quot; He also said that Electronic Arts had been &quot;unbelievably patient&quot; and thanked vice-president Mark Lewis for campaigning for &quot;Dungeon Keeper&quot;″s completion. Molyneux&#x27;s planned departure was his motivation to make &quot;Dungeon Keeper&quot; good. He believed that he would enjoy being an executive but said that it was &quot;an utter nightmare&quot;. Shortly after his departure, Molyneux said he still had feelings for Bullfrog and wished them success. Despite his dissatisfaction with the corporate aspects of being vice-president, Molyneux said that he had learned &quot;an enormous amount&quot;. In 2017, he revealed that his resignation was the consequence of his, and technical director Tim Rance&#x27;s, drunkenness. He said he would take his resignation email back if he could.

Around this time, as Electronic Arts increased control over Bullfrog. Mark Healey (the lead artist for &quot;Dungeon Keeper&quot;) stated that the company &quot;felt more like a chicken factory&quot; after Electronic Arts&#x27; takeover and compared it to being assimilated by the Borg. Glenn Corpes (an artist for &quot;Fusion&quot; and &quot;Populous&quot;) stated that he was not surprised at Molyneux&#x27;s departure. Another employee believed that working for Bullfrog had become &quot;a job&quot; and that the company had lost its innovation. In 2008, Electronic Arts&#x27; president John Riccitiello corroborated these sentiments by admitting that their &quot;dictatorial managerial approach&quot; had suppressed Bullfrog&#x27;s creativity. Sean Cooper (the designer of &quot;Syndicate&quot;) said that if he could travel back in time, he would probably force Molyneux to refrain from selling Bullfrog to Electronic Arts. He described the period of resignations following Molyneux&#x27;s departure as &quot;such a horrible time&quot;. Molyneux believed that Electronic Arts had good intentions for Bullfrog, saying that &quot;they just wanted to make it nicer&quot; and putting the company&#x27;s effects on Bullfrog down to &quot;love abuse&quot;.

When &quot;Dungeon Keeper&quot; was nearing its completion in 1997, Molyneux, Rance, and Mark Webley (the project leader for &quot;Theme Hospital&quot;) founded a new company, Lionhead Studios, that July. By the time the studio&#x27;s first game, &quot;Black &amp; White&quot;, was released, Bullfrog employees such as Healey, Andy Bass (an artist who had worked on &quot;Theme Hospital&quot;), Russell Shaw (the composer for various titles), James Leach (Bullfrog&#x27;s script writer), Paul McLaughlin (who worked on &quot;Creation&quot;), and Jonty Barnes (a programmer who had worked on &quot;Dungeon Keeper&quot;) had joined Lionhead. Healey stated that, because of his dissatisfaction at Bullfrog, he was happy to follow Molyneux and became Lionhead&#x27;s first artist. Also in 1997, Mike Diskett (the project leader, lead programmer, and lead designer of &quot;Syndicate Wars&quot;), Finn McGechie (the lead artist for &quot;Magic Carpet&quot;), and Guy Simmons left to found Mucky Foot Productions, with Carr joining them the following year.

Other notable people at Bullfrog around the mid-1990s include Simon Carter (the lead programmer for &quot;Dungeon Keeper&quot;), Richard Reed (the project leader for &quot;Gene Wars&quot;), Mike Man (the lead artist for &quot;Syndicate Wars&quot;), Alan Wright (the project leader and lead programmer for &quot;Magic Carpet 2&quot;), and Eoin Rogan (the lead artist for &quot;Magic Carpet 2&quot;).

=== Post-Molyneux, final years, and closure (1998–2001) ===
In 1998, two games were released: &quot;Theme Aquarium&quot;, and &quot;Populous: The Beginning&quot;. &quot;Theme Aquarium&quot; was an attempt to &quot;cross barriers&quot; between the United Kingdom and Japan. Edgar explained that Bullfrog was more successful than most western game developers in Japan due to &quot;Populous&quot; and &quot;Theme Park&quot;, and wondered about the possibilities of having a game designed in the United Kingdom and implemented in Japan by Japanese development teams. A small group was set up to do this. &quot;Theme Aquarium&quot; was released as a &quot;Theme&quot; game in Japan only; western releases removed the Bullfrog branding. As of 2012, many ex-Bullfrog employees were unfamiliar with the game. Shortly before Molyneux&#x27;s departure, Bullfrog announced that the games then in development may be the final ones released for MS-DOS. It was &quot;quite likely&quot; that all future games would be Windows-only. The reason for the change in platform focus was so Bullfrog could create games with Windows in mind and use &quot;powerful features&quot; (such as 3D acceleration), which were difficult to use with MS-DOS.

In 1999, &quot;Theme Park World&quot; and &quot;Dungeon Keeper 2&quot; were released. Most of &quot;Theme Park World&quot;″s development team came from Mindscape—they were brought to Bullfrog wholesale. Bullfrog worked with its sister company Maxis to release &quot;Theme Park World&quot; in North America under their &quot;Sim&quot; brand as &quot;Sim Theme Park&quot; to further establish itself in the region. &quot;Theme Resort&quot;, a &quot;Theme&quot; game based around holiday islands, was cancelled and its team reallocated to &quot;Theme Park World&quot;. &quot;Dungeon Keeper 2&quot; had a new development team led by Nick Goldsworthy, previously an assistant producer for &quot;Theme Park&quot; at Electronic Arts. During the development, Colin Robinson was interviewed for the role of Bullfrog&#x27;s chief technical officer, and helped the project succeed. In 2016, Glenn Corpes speculated that Electronic Arts did not understand Molyneux&#x27;s role at Bullfrog and thought he was in charge of everything and that Electronic Arts&#x27; response to his departure would be to install managers. In fact, he focused on one game at a time, and let others carry out their work.

In mid-1999, Edgar stepped down as chairman. He was succeeded as managing director by Bruce McMillan of Electronic Arts&#x27; Canadian studios. Corpes left to found the studio Lost Toys with Jeremy Longley (who had worked on &quot;Theme Hospital&quot;, &quot;Syndicate Wars&quot;, and &quot;Populous III&quot;) and Darren Thomas (who had worked on &quot;Dungeon Keeper&quot; and &quot;Magic Carpet 2&quot;, and was the lead artist on &quot;Theme Park World&quot;), which Edgar supported financially. Corpes stated that he was inspired by Mucky Foot Productions running its own affairs and that it was &quot;quite embarrassing to still be working for the Borg&quot;. He also said that Lost Toys was partially his take on what Bullfrog was. Alex Trowers (a designer who had worked on &quot;Syndicate&quot; and &quot;Powermonger&quot;) believed that Bullfrog had become too corporate after Electronic Arts&#x27; takeover and left for Lost Toys to return to &quot;making games for the sake of making games&quot;, rather than to satisfy shareholders.

In August 1999, Electronic Arts appointed Ernest Adams as the lead designer of the fourth instalment in the &quot;Populous&quot; series, &quot;Genesis: The Hand of God&quot;. Bullfrog&#x27;s management had concerns about its similarity to Lionhead Studios&#x27; &quot;Black &amp; White&quot; and cancelled the project. Adams then became the lead designer on &quot;Dungeon Keeper 3&quot;. As &quot;Dungeon Keeper 2&quot; did not perform as well as hoped, the team were instructed to make the third game more accessible. Development began in November 1999, but Electronic Arts&#x27; focus was changing. It was in negotiation with J. K. Rowling and New Line Cinema for licences to &quot;Harry Potter&quot; and &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, respectively. Electronic Arts saw a profitable opportunity and, in March 2000, cancelled &quot;Dungeon Keeper 3&quot; in favour of those franchises, although its cancellation was not officially announced until August. Bullfrog moved to Chertsey in 2000 and went through &quot;a quiet patch&quot; for the remainder of the year.

The final game under the Bullfrog brand, &quot;Theme Park Inc&quot;, was released in 2001. By the time the game was in development, most of the Bullfrog teams had become part of EA UK and much of the development was handled by another company. What remained of Bullfrog was then merged into EA UK. Molyneux stayed with Lionhead Studios until the formation of 22cans in 2012. Edgar had some involvement with the gaming industry since Bullfrog but eventually left for the automotive industry. In August 2009, Electronics Arts were considering revising some of Bullfrog&#x27;s games for modern-day systems.

== Legacy ==
Several employees founded their own companies after leaving Bullfrog. These include:
* Lionhead Studios – Founded by Peter Molyneux, Mark Webley, and Tim Rance (as well as Steve Jackson, the co-founder of Games Workshop and co-author of the &quot;Fighting Fantasy&quot; books), Lionhead is best known for their &quot;Black &amp; White&quot; and &quot;Fable&quot; series. The company was acquired by Microsoft and closed down on 29 April 2016.
* Mucky Foot Productions – Founded by Mike Diskett, Fin McGechie, and Guy Simmons. Gary Carr joined shortly afterwards. A deal with Eidos Interactive was signed and Mucky Foot Productions developed three games: &quot;Urban Chaos&quot;, &quot;Startopia&quot;, and &quot;Blade II&quot;. The company closed in 2003.
* Lost Toys – Founded by Glenn Corpes, Jeremy Longley, and Darran Thomas. The studio created two games—Ball Breakers/Moho and Battle Engine Aquila—before shutting down.
* Media Molecule – Best known for &quot;LittleBigPlanet&quot;, Media Molecule was established by Mark Healey, Alex Evans, Dave Smith, and Kareem Ettouney.
* Intrepid Computer Entertainment – This company was started by Joe Rider and Matt Chilton, and signed by Microsoft as a first-party developer. Intrepid closed in 2004, and its employees moved to Lionhead Studios.
* Big Blue Box Studios – Founded by Bullfrog programmers Simon and Dene Carter, and Ian Lovett (who worked on &quot;Magic Carpet&quot; and &quot;Dungeon Keeper&quot;), Big Blue Box Studios were &quot;very close&quot; to Lionhead Studios, and the two companies merged.
* 22cans – Founded in 2012 by Molyneux after he left Lionhead. 22cans is known for &quot;Godus&quot;, which took inspiration from &quot;Populous&quot; and &quot;Dungeon Keeper&quot;, as well as Lionhead&#x27;s &quot;Black &amp; White&quot;.
* Two Point Studios – Founded in 2016 by Gary Carr and Mark Webley, Two Point Studios signed a publishing deal with Sega in May 2017.

Several Bullfrog games have spawned spiritual successors or have been used as a base for comparison. &quot;Dungeon Keeper&quot; has influenced &quot;War for the Overworld&quot; and Mucky Foot&#x27;s &quot;Startopia&quot;, the former being described as &quot;a true spiritual successor to Dungeon Keeper&quot;. DR Studios&#x27; &quot;Hospital Tycoon&quot; has been compared to &quot;Theme Hospital&quot;. &quot;Satellite Reign&quot; (programmed by Mike Diskett) has been labelled a spiritual successor to the &quot;Syndicate&quot; series. &quot;Two Point Hospital&quot;, developed by Two Point Studios, is considered to be a spiritual successor to &quot;Theme Hospital&quot;. In October 2013, Jeff Skalski of Mythic Entertainment, which produced a free-to-play remake of &quot;Dungeon Keeper&quot; for mobile platforms, said he would like to remake other Bullfrog titles, and described the company as &quot;unstoppable&quot;. &quot;Theme Park&quot; also received a freemium remake in December 2011.

== Games developed ==
=== Cancelled projects ===
Bullfrog cancelled several projects. According to Molyneux, the most common reason games were abandoned in the company&#x27;s earlier days was because the game testers did not like them. That being the case, his theory was that customers would not either. Cancelled games include:
* &quot;Ember&quot; – Players would have piloted a speeder craft to repair a microprocessor chip, competing against a rival trying to undo the player&#x27;s repairs.
* &quot;Colony&quot; – An arcade-adventure-puzzle game in which players would have attempted to save the passengers and crew of a cryogenic ship by repairing the cryogenic suspension system, using video cameras to monitor activity on the ship.
* &quot;Hell&quot; – A scrolling shoot &#x27;em up based in the underworld and based on &quot;Joust&quot;.
* &quot;The Indestructibles&quot; – Described as &quot;an action-beat-&#x27;em-up-strategy-everything game&quot;, &quot;The Indestructibles&quot; would have involved creating superhumans to defend cities from invaders.
* &quot;Creation&quot; – Set in the same reality as &quot;Syndicate&quot;, &quot;Creation&quot; would have had the player battling to transform an alien water world.
* &quot;Void Star&quot; – This was to be a 3D real-time strategy game set in space, but was cancelled it was believed that there would be no interest in the concept.
* &quot;Theme Resort&quot;, &quot;Theme Prison&quot;, &quot;Theme Ski Resort&quot;, and &quot;Theme Airport&quot; – These were &quot;talked about&quot; after the release of &quot;Theme Hospital&quot; but never materialised due to Mark Webley and Gary Carr leaving for other companies. &quot;Theme Resort&quot; was in development (according to Webley, its team were trying to have a trip to Club Med for research), and its team joined &quot;Theme Park World&quot; after cancellation. Webley stated that Bullfrog intended to explore other possibilities for its &quot;Designer Series&quot; (of which &quot;Theme Park&quot; and &quot;Theme Hospital&quot; are part of), but Electronic Arts had it shut down.
* &quot;Genesis: The Hand of God&quot; – Intended to be the next instalment in the &quot;Populous&quot; series but was cancelled due to similarities to Lionhead&#x27;s &quot;Black &amp; White&quot;.
* &quot;Dungeon Keeper 3&quot; – Project was cancelled in favour of film franchises such as &quot;Harry Potter&quot; and &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;. Bullfrog also decided to cease developing real-time strategy games.
* &quot;Theme Movie Studio&quot; – Did not make it past the concept stage.

<text>Richard Henry Bolt (April 22, 1911 – January 13, 2002) was an American physics professor at MIT with an interest in acoustics. He was one of the founders of the company Bolt, Beranek and Newman, which built the ARPANET, a forerunner of the Internet.

==Early life==
Bolt was born in Peking, China, where his parents were medical missionaries. His family returned to the U.S. in 1916 and settled in California.

Bolt graduated from Berkeley High School, California in 1928 and went to college and graduate school at the University of California, Berkeley.

Although he initially expected to major in either music or graphical design, he decided on architecture, in which he attained a BA in 1933. At that time, he had already developed an interest in acoustics, combining his interests for music, design and architecture.

After his marriage to Katherine Mary Smith, right after his graduation in 1933, they made a honeymoon to Europe, where he became acquainted with a number of scientists from Berlin, and the honeymoon was extended to ten months while Bolt learned German and studied acoustics.

==Berkeley==
Returning to Berkeley in 1934, he entered the graduate physics program, and, earning an M.A. in 1937 and qualifying for Berkeley&#x27;s Physics Ph.D. program, which he completed in 1939. He performed his research at UCLA, given the fact that Berkeley had no acoustics research facilities at that time. After attaining his PhD in 1939 he worked at MIT for a year on the transmission of sound in various shapes of rooms. Excluding a brief period at the University of Illinois and a stationing in London during WWII, he remained associated with the MIT until his retirement.

==MIT and BBN==
Bolt started a consulting firm with another MIT professor, Leo Beranek, in 1948, and worked on such projects as doing an audio analysis of the JFK assassination, the &quot;18.5 minute gap&quot; in Nixon&#x27;s White House tapes, and improving the sound in concert halls. In later years, after the addition of one of his former students, Robert Newman, the firm of Bolt, Beranek and Newman, better known as BBN, designed the first modem in 1963, helping computers communicate with each other. This led to work on the ARPANET, which became the Internet. BBN helped develop e-mail and, in 1971, one of BBN&#x27;s researchers, Ray Tomlinson, chose the &quot;@&quot; sign for e-mail addresses. Bolt retired in 1976.

<doc id="462384" wikidata="Q310295" url="?curid=462384" title="Dick Van Dyke">
<text>Richard Wayne Van Dyke (born December 13, 1925) is an American actor, entertainer and comedian. His work spans screen and stage, and his awards include six Emmy Awards, a Grammy Award and a Tony Award. He was inducted into the Television Hall of Fame in 1995 and the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1993, and has been honored with the Screen Actors Guild Life Achievement Award in 2013, the Kennedy Center Honors in 2020, and was recognized as a Disney Legend in 1998.

Van Dyke began his career as an entertainer on radio, television and in nightclubs. He made his Broadway debut in the musical revue &quot;The Girls Against the Boys&quot; (1959). The following year he starred as Albert F. Peterson in the original production of &quot;Bye Bye Birdie&quot; (1960), a role which earned him the Tony Award for Best Featured Actor in a Musical. He returned to Broadway playing Harold Hill in a revival of &quot;The Music Man&quot; (1980).

On television, Van Dyke became a household name in the United States and Canada portraying Rob Petrie in the CBS sitcom &quot;The Dick Van Dyke Show&quot; (1961–1966), which also earned him three Primetime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series. He guest-starred on shows such as &quot;Columbo&quot; (1974) and &quot;The Carol Burnett Show&quot; (1977), and starred in &quot;The New Dick Van Dyke Show&quot; (1971–1974), &quot;&quot; (1993–2001), and &quot;Murder 101&quot; (2006–2008).

Van Dyke is also known for his role as Bert, the cockney chimney sweep in the Disney movie musical &quot;Mary Poppins&quot; (1964), for which he was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in a Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy. He starred in the movie musicals &quot;Bye Bye Birdie&quot; (1963) and &quot;Chitty Chitty Bang Bang&quot; (1968), as well as the comedy-drama &quot;The Comic&quot; (1969). In his later years, Van Dyke has taken supporting roles in films such as &quot;Dick Tracy&quot; (1990), &quot;Curious George&quot; (2006), &quot;Night at the Museum&quot; (2006), its 2014 sequel, and &quot;Mary Poppins Returns&quot; (2018).

==Early life and education==
Richard Wayne Van Dyke was born on December 13, 1925, in West Plains, Missouri, to Hazel Victoria (née McCord), a stenographer, and Loren Wayne &quot;Cookie&quot; Van Dyke, a salesman. He grew up in Danville, Illinois. He is the older brother of actor Jerry Van Dyke, who appeared as his brother in &quot;The Dick Van Dyke Show&quot;. Van Dyke is a Dutch surname, although he also has English, Irish, and Scottish ancestry. His family line traces back to &quot;Mayflower&quot; passenger John Alden.

Van Dyke attended Danville High School in 1944, where he participated in the &quot;a cappella&quot; choir and dramatic club. His involvement in the drama program convinced him to become a professional entertainer, although he also considered a career in the ministry.

Van Dyke left high school during his senior year to join the United States Army Air Forces for pilot training during World War II. Denied enlistment several times for being underweight, he was eventually accepted for service as a radio announcer before transferring to the Special Services and entertaining troops in the continental United States. He was discharged in 1946. Van Dyke received his high school diploma in 2004.

== Career ==
=== 1940–1959: Early work and Broadway debut ===

During the late 1940s, Van Dyke was a radio DJ on WDAN in Danville, Illinois. In 1947, Van Dyke was persuaded by pantomime performer Phil Erickson to form a comedy duo called &quot;Eric and Van—the Merry Mutes.&quot; The team toured the West Coast nightclub circuit, performing a mime act and lip synching to 78 rpm records. They moved to Atlanta, Georgia, in the early 1950s and performed on a local television show featuring original skits and music called &quot;The Merry Mutes&quot;.

Van Dyke&#x27;s start in television was with WDSU-TV New Orleans Channel 6 (NBC), first as a single comedian and later as emcee of a comedy program. Van Dyke&#x27;s first network TV appearance was with Dennis James on James&#x27; &quot;Chance of a Lifetime&quot; in 1954. He later appeared in two episodes of &quot;The Phil Silvers Show&quot; during its 1957–58 season. He also appeared early in his career on ABC&#x27;s &quot;The Pat Boone Chevy Showroom&quot; and NBC&#x27;s &quot;The Polly Bergen Show&quot;. During this time a friend from the Army was working as an executive for CBS television and recommended Van Dyke to that network. Out of this came a seven-year contract with the network. During an interview on NPR&#x27;s &quot;Wait Wait... Don&#x27;t Tell Me!&quot; program, Van Dyke said he was the anchorman for the CBS Morning Show during this period with Walter Cronkite as his newsman.

In November 1959, Van Dyke made his Broadway debut in &quot;The Girls Against the Boys&quot; which ran at the Alvin Theatre. The production was a revue in two acts and featured performances from Van Dyke, Shelley Berman, Bert Lahr, Nancy Walker among many others. The production ran on Broadway for 16 performances from November 2 to November 14, 1959.

=== 1960–1968: Career stardom ===
==== &quot;Bye Bye Birdie&quot; (1960–1963) ====
He played the lead role of Albert Peterson in &quot;Bye Bye Birdie&quot;, which ran from April 14, 1960, to October 7, 1961. Van Dyke starred alongside Chita Rivera, Barbara Doherty, and Paul Lynde. The production received mixed reviews from critics, such as from Brooks Atkinson of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, who praised Van Dyke as &quot;likable&quot; but opined, &quot;As a production it&#x27;s neither fish fowl nor good musical comedy. It needs work.&quot; Despite this, the musical won four Tony awards, including for Van Dyke, who won the Tony Award for Best Featured Actor in a Musical in 1961.

Van Dyke began his film career by playing the role of Albert J. Peterson in the film version of &quot;Bye Bye Birdie&quot; (1963). Despite his unhappiness with the adaptation—its focus differed from the stage version in that the story now centered on a previously supporting character—the film was a success. The film starred Ann-Margret, Janet Leigh, and Maureen Stapleton with Van Dyke and Lynde reprising their roles. &quot;Variety&quot; wrote of Van Dyke&#x27;s performance, &quot;Van Dyke displays a showbiz knowhow far more extensive than his television outings communicate&quot;.

==== &quot;The Dick Van Dyke Show&quot; (1961–1966) ====

From 1961 to 1966, Van Dyke starred in the CBS sitcom &quot;The Dick Van Dyke Show&quot;, in which he portrayed a comedy writer named Rob Petrie. Carl Reiner conceived the program and cast himself as the lead in the pilot, but CBS insisted on recasting, and Reiner chose Van Dyke to replace him in the role. Complementing Van Dyke was a veteran cast of comic actors including Rose Marie, Morey Amsterdam, Jerry Paris, Ann Morgan Guilbert, Richard Deacon, and Carl Reiner (as Alan Brady), as well as 24-year-old Mary Tyler Moore, who played Rob&#x27;s wife Laura Petrie. Van Dyke won three Emmy Awards as Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series, and the series received four Emmy Awards as Outstanding Comedy Series.

&quot;The Dick Van Dyke Show&quot; received positive reviews from its start, with &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; praising Van Dyke&#x27;s comedic performance writing, &quot;Sure to catch on as a new personality is Dick Van Dyke who, though he can play it straight when need be, proves a master of the double take, juicing up to solid laughs what would possibly be just amusing lines with his physical reactions. Yet, he doesn&#x27;t over-mug. In this one, his &quot;drunk husband&quot; bit was a masterpiece of timing and ingenuity.&quot;

Ken Tucker of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; reviewed the series following its Blu-ray boxset release in 2012 writing, &quot;The Dick Van Dyke Show certainly wasn&#x27;t the first sitcom featuring a lead character who presided over a TV-show-within-the-TV-show — Jack Benny&#x27;s &quot;The Jack Benny Program&quot;, among others, had beaten Van Dyke to that. But this was the first sitcom to meld the workplace sitcom with the domestic sitcom so seamlessly. The episodes themselves move with the same smoothness and grace that Van Dyke and Moore did, whether the Petries were clowning, dancing, or romancing&quot;.

The series had a reunion in 2004 and was aired on CBS as &quot;The Dick Van Dyke Show Revisited&quot; with Ray Romano serving as host and Van Dyke, Mary Tyler Moore, Rose Marie, Jerry Van Dyke and Carl Reiner returning. Morey Amsterdam and Richard Deacon appeared in archival footage, both having died.

==== &quot;Mary Poppins&quot; (1964) ====

In 1964, Van Dyke was cast in two roles in Walt Disney&#x27;s &quot;Mary Poppins&quot;: as Bert, a man who goes through multiple odd jobs, ultimately and memorably becoming a chimney sweep; and as bank chairman Mr. Dawes Senior. For his scenes as the chairman, he was heavily costumed to look much older and was credited in that role as &quot;Navckid Keyd&quot;. At the end of the credits, the letters unscramble into &quot;Dick Van Dyke&quot;, which was repeated in &quot;Mary Poppins Returns&quot;. Van Dyke&#x27;s attempt at a cockney accent has been lambasted as one of the worst accents in film history, cited by actors since as an example of how not to sound. In a 2003 poll by &quot;Empire&quot; magazine of the worst-ever accents in film, he came in second (to Sean Connery in &quot;The Untouchables&quot;, despite Connery winning an Academy Award for that performance).

According to Van Dyke, his accent coach—veteran actor J. Pat O&#x27;Malley—was Irish and &quot;didn&#x27;t do an accent any better than I did&quot;, and no one alerted him to how bad it was during the production. Still, &quot;Mary Poppins&quot; was successful on release and its appeal has endured. &quot;Chim Chim Cher-ee&quot;, one of the songs that Van Dyke performed in &quot;Mary Poppins&quot;, won the Academy Award for Best Original Song for the Sherman Brothers, the film&#x27;s songwriting duo.
Van Dyke received a Grammy Award in 1964, along with Julie Andrews, for his performance on the soundtrack to &quot;Mary Poppins&quot;. 

Many of the comedy films Van Dyke starred in throughout the 1960s were relatively unsuccessful at the box office, including &quot;What a Way to Go!&quot; with Shirley MacLaine, &quot;Lt. Robin Crusoe, U.S.N.&quot;, &quot;Fitzwilly&quot;, &quot;The Art of Love&quot; with James Garner and Elke Sommer, &quot;Some Kind of a Nut&quot;, &quot;Never a Dull Moment&quot; with Edward G. Robinson, and &quot;Divorce American Style&quot; with Debbie Reynolds and Jean Simmons. But he also starred as Caractacus Potts (with his native accent, at his own insistence, despite the English setting) in the successful musical version of Ian Fleming&#x27;s &quot;Chitty Chitty Bang Bang&quot; (1968), which co-starred Sally Ann Howes and featured the same songwriters (the Sherman Brothers) and choreographers (Marc Breaux and Dee Dee Wood) as &quot;Mary Poppins&quot;.

=== 1968–1980: Established star ===

In 1968, it was reported that Albert R. Broccoli had offered Van Dyke the chance to replace Sean Connery as James Bond. Van Dyke declined the offer, asking Broccoli: &quot;Have you heard my British accent?&quot;. In 1969, Van Dyke appeared in the comedy-drama &quot;The Comic&quot;, written and directed by Carl Reiner. Van Dyke portrayed a self-destructive silent film era comedian who struggles with alcoholism, depression, and his own rampant ego. Reiner wrote the film especially for Van Dyke, who often spoke of his admiration for silent film era comedians such as Charlie Chaplin and his hero Stan Laurel.

Also in 1969, Van Dyke played Rev. Clayton Brooks, a small-town minister who leads his Iowa town to quit smoking for 30 days in order to win $25 million (equal to $ today) from a tobacco company. The film, &quot;Cold Turkey&quot;, was not released until 1971. In 1970, he published &quot;Faith, Hope and Hilarity: A Child&#x27;s Eye View of Religion&quot; a book of humorous anecdotes based largely on his experiences as a Sunday School teacher. Van Dyke was principal in &quot;KXIV Inc.&quot; and owned 1400 AM KXIV in Phoenix from 1965 to 1982.

From 1971 to 1974, Van Dyke starred in an unrelated sitcom called &quot;The New Dick Van Dyke Show&quot; in which he portrayed a local television talk show host. Although the series was developed by Carl Reiner and starred Hope Lange as his wife, and he received a Golden Globe nomination for his performance, the show was less successful than its predecessor, and Van Dyke pulled the plug on the show after just three seasons.
In 1973, Van Dyke voiced his animated likeness for the October 27, 1973, installment of Hanna-Barbera&#x27;s &quot;The New Scooby-Doo Movies&quot;, &quot;Scooby-Doo Meets Dick Van Dyke&quot;, the series&#x27; final first-run episode. In 1974, he received an Emmy Award nomination for his role as an alcoholic businessman in the television movie &quot;The Morning After&quot; (1974). Van Dyke revealed after its release that he had recently overcome a real-life drinking problem; he admits he was an alcoholic for 25 years. That same year he guest-starred as a murderous photographer on an episode of &quot;Columbo&quot;, &quot;Negative Reaction&quot;. Van Dyke returned to comedy in 1976 with the sketch comedy show &quot;Van Dyke and Company,&quot; on which Andy Kaufman made his prime time debut. Despite being canceled after three months, the show won an Emmy Award for Outstanding Comedy-Variety Series. After a few guest appearances on the long-running comedy-variety series &quot;The Carol Burnett Show&quot;, Van Dyke became a regular on the show, in the fall of 1977. However, he appeared in only half of the episodes of the final season.

In 1980, Van Dyke appeared in the title role in a United States tour and Broadway revival of &quot;The Music Man&quot;.

=== 1981–2001: &quot;Diagnosis Murder&quot; ===

For the next decade he appeared mostly in TV movies, including a made-for-cable remake of &quot;The Country Girl&quot; (1982) with Faye Dunaway. One atypical role was as a murdering judge on the second episode of the TV series &quot;Matlock&quot; in 1986 starring Andy Griffith. In 1987, he guest-starred in an episode of &quot;Airwolf&quot;, with his son Barry Van Dyke, who was the lead star of the show&#x27;s fourth and final season on USA Network. In 1989, he guest-starred on the NBC comedy series &quot;The Golden Girls&quot; portraying a lover of Beatrice Arthur&#x27;s character. This role earned him his first Emmy Award nomination since 1977.

On &quot;Larry King Live&quot;, Van Dyke mentioned that he turned down the lead role in &quot;The Omen&quot; which was played by Gregory Peck. He also mentioned that his dream role would have been the Scarecrow in &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;. Twenty-one years later in 1990, Van Dyke, whose usual role had been the amiable hero, took a small but villainous turn as crooked DA Fletcher in Warren Beatty&#x27;s film &quot;Dick Tracy&quot;.

Van Dyke&#x27;s film work affected his TV career: the reviews he received for his role as D.A. Fletcher in &quot;Dick Tracy&quot; led him to star as the character Dr. Mark Sloan first in an episode of &quot;Jake and the Fatman&quot;, then in a series of TV movies on CBS that became the foundation for his popular television drama &quot;.&quot; The series ran from 1993 to 2001 with son Barry Van Dyke co-starring in the role of Dr. Sloan&#x27;s son Lieutenant Detective Steve Sloan. Also starring on the same show was daytime soap actress Victoria Rowell as Dr. Sloan&#x27;s pathologist/medical partner, Dr. Amanda Bentley, and Charlie Schlatter in the role of Dr. Sloan&#x27;s student, Dr. Jesse Travis.

Van Dyke became a computer animation enthusiast after purchasing an Amiga in 1991. He is credited with the creation of 3D-rendered effects used on &quot;Diagnosis: Murder&quot; and &quot;The Dick Van Dyke Show Revisited&quot;. Van Dyke has displayed his computer-generated imagery work at SIGGRAPH, and continues to work with LightWave 3D.

As an a cappella enthusiast, Van Dyke has sung in a group called &quot;Dick Van Dyke and The Vantastix&quot; since September 2000. The quartet has performed several times in Los Angeles as well as on &quot;Larry King Live&quot;, The First Annual TV Land Awards, and sang the national anthem at three Los Angeles Lakers games including a nationally televised NBA Finals performance on NBC. Van Dyke was made an honorary member of the Barbershop Harmony Society in 1999.

=== 2002–present: Later career and television resurgence ===

Van Dyke continued to find television work after &quot;Diagnosis: Murder&quot; ended, including a dramatically and critically successful performance of &quot;The Gin Game&quot;, produced for television in 2003 that reunited him with Mary Tyler Moore. In 2003, he portrayed Doctor Doug Townshend on &quot;Scrubs&quot;. A 2004 special of &quot;The Dick Van Dyke Show&quot; titled &quot;The Dick Van Dyke Show Revisited&quot; was heavily promoted as the first new episode of the classic series to be shown in 38 years. Van Dyke and his surviving cast members recreated their roles; although nominated for a Primetime Emmy, the program was roundly panned by critics.

In 2006 he guest-starred as college professor Dr. Jonathan Maxwell for a series of &quot;Murder 101&quot; mystery films on the Hallmark Channel. Van Dyke returned to motion pictures in 2006 with &quot;Curious George&quot; as Mr. Bloomsberry and as villain Cecil Fredericks in the Ben Stiller film &quot;Night at the Museum&quot;. He reprised the role in a cameo for the sequel, &quot;Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian&quot; (2009), but it was cut from the film. It can be found in the special features on the DVD release. He also played the character again in the third film, &quot;Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb&quot; (2014).
In 2010, Van Dyke appeared on a children&#x27;s album titled &quot;Rhythm Train,&quot; with Red Hot Chili Peppers drummer Chad Smith and singer Leslie Bixler. Van Dyke raps on one of the album&#x27;s tracks. In 2017, Van Dyke released his first solo album since 1963&#x27;s &quot;Songs I Like&quot;. The album, &quot;Step (Back) In Time&quot;, was produced by Bill Bixler (who also played sax), with arrangements by Dave Enos (who also played bass) and features noted musicians John Ferraro (drums), Tony Guerrero (trumpet &amp; vocal duet), Mark LeBrun (piano), Charley Pollard (trombone) and Leslie Bixler (vocals). &quot;Step (Back) In Time&quot; was released by BixMix Records and showcases Van Dyke in a jazz and big band setting on classic songs from the 1920s, 1930s and 1940s. Van Dyke recorded a duet single for Christmas 2017 with actress Jane Lynch. The song, &quot;We&#x27;re Going Caroling&quot;, was written and produced by Tony Guerrero for Lynch&#x27;s KitschTone Records label as a digital-only release.

In 2018, Van Dyke portrayed Mr. Dawes Jr. in &quot;Mary Poppins Returns&quot;. He had previously portrayed both Bert and Mr. Dawes Sr. (Mr. Dawes, Jr.&#x27;s late father), in the original film. For the Marvel Cinematic Universe television series, &quot;WandaVision&quot;, Van Dyke was consulted by the producers on how to emulate &quot;The Dick Van Dyke Show&quot;.

In 2023, Van Dyke competed in season nine of &quot;The Masked Singer&quot; as &quot;Gnome&quot; and was the first to be eliminated. The episode had been promoted as &quot;the most legendary, decorated and beloved unmasking in history&quot;. After Van Dyke revealed his identity, he received a lengthy standing ovation from the audience and judges. Before departing the stage, Van Dyke sang as an encore of his part in the song &quot;Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious&quot; from &quot;Mary Poppins&quot;, in which he starred. At age 97, Van Dyke became the oldest person ever to compete on the series. In April of the same year, it was announced Van Dyke would guest-appear on &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot; for several episodes. On December 21, 2023, he was honored with a CBS special, &quot;Dick Van Dyke: 98 Years of Magic&quot;, celebrating his 98th birthday.

In December 2024, Van Dyke starred in the music video for the Coldplay song &quot;All My Love&quot;. He produced the video with his wife, actress Arlene Silver.

==Influences==
Van Dyke has often cited Stan Laurel, Buster Keaton, and Carl Reiner as his comedy influences and idols. Van Dyke stated on &quot;Conan&quot; that he called Laurel and admitted to him that he had stolen from him over the years, and Laurel replied, &quot;Yes, I know&quot;. Entertainers who have cited Van Dyke as an influence include Steve Martin, Chevy Chase, Conan O&#x27;Brien, Jim Carrey, and Bryan Cranston.

==Personal life==
On February 12, 1948, while appearing at the Chapman Park Hotel on Wilshire Boulevard in Los Angeles, Van Dyke and the former Margerie Willett were married on the radio show &quot;Bride and Groom&quot;. They had four children: Christian, Barry, Stacy and Carrie Beth. They divorced in 1984 after a long separation. In 1976, Van Dyke began his relationship with longtime companion Michelle Triola Marvin. They lived together for more than 30 years, until her death in 2009. Their affair, which left Van Dyke &quot;writhing in guilt,&quot; contributed to the breakup of Van Dyke and Willett&#x27;s marriage. On February 29, 2012, at the age of 86, Van Dyke married make-up artist Arlene Silver, 46 years his junior. They had met six years earlier at the SAG awards.

Van Dyke included his children and grandchildren in his TV shows. Son Barry Van Dyke, grandsons Shane Van Dyke and Carey Van Dyke, and other Van Dyke grandchildren and relatives appeared in episodes of &quot;&quot;. Van Dyke has seven grandchildren. His son Chris was district attorney for Marion County, Oregon, in the 1980s and prosecuted the I-5 Killer, Randall Woodfield. In 1987, Van Dyke&#x27;s granddaughter, Jessica Van Dyke, died from Reye syndrome, which led him to do a series of commercials to raise public awareness of the danger of aspirin to children.

Throughout his acting career Van Dyke continued to teach Sunday school in the Presbyterian Church where he was an elder, and he continued to read such theologians as Martin Buber, Paul Tillich, and Dietrich Bonhoeffer. On August 19, 2013, it was reported that the 87-year-old Van Dyke was rescued from his Jaguar by a passerby after the car had caught fire on the US 101 freeway in Calabasas, Los Angeles County. He was not injured in the fire, although the car burned down to its frame.

Van Dyke endorsed Bernie Sanders in the 2016 Democratic Party presidential primaries. In July 2016, while campaigning for Sanders, Van Dyke said of Donald Trump, &quot;I haven&#x27;t been this scared since the Cuban Missile Crisis. I think the human race is hanging in a delicate balance right now, and I&#x27;m just so afraid he will put us in a war. He scares me.&quot; Van Dyke again endorsed and campaigned for Sanders in the 2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries. Van Dyke endorsed Kamala Harris for president in the 2024 U.S. presidential election.

In December 2024, during the California wildfires, Van Dyke had to evacuate from his home in Malibu. He said, &quot;I was trying to crawl to [my] car. I had exhausted myself. I couldn&#x27;t get up. Three neighbors came and carried me out.&quot; His home survived the wildfires. Soon afterward, Van Dyke evacuated his home again due to the January 2025 Palisades Fire.

=== Health ===
Van Dyke is sober after struggling with alcoholism for years, and he checked in to a hospital for three weeks in 1972 to be treated for his addiction. Van Dyke was a heavy smoker for most of his adult life. In a January 2013 interview with the London &quot;Daily Telegraph,&quot; he said he had been using Nicorette gum for the past decade. In April 2013, Van Dyke revealed that for seven years he had been experiencing symptoms of a neurological disorder, in which he felt a pounding in his head whenever he lay down. Despite his undergoing tests, no diagnosis had been made. He had to cancel scheduled appearances owing to fatigue from lack of sleep because of the medical condition. In May 2013, Van Dyke tweeted that it seemed his titanium dental implants might have been responsible.

In 1961 he won the Tony Award for Best Featured Actor in a Musical for his performance in &quot;Bye Bye Birdie&quot;.

<text>Adam Warlock is a character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The character first appeared in &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; #66–67 (cover-dates September 1967 and October 1967) created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby, originally named Him. The character would later be significantly developed by Roy Thomas and Jim Starlin. Debuting in the Silver Age of Comic Books, the character has appeared over several decades of Marvel publications, and starred in the titles &quot;Marvel Premiere&quot; and &quot;Strange Tales&quot; as well as five eponymous volumes and several related limited series.

The character is a cosmic being artificially created on Earth by the Enclave, genetically engineered to be perfect and the next evolution of humanity. Privy to their intentions, the being originally known only as &quot;Him&quot; rebelled against his creators and sought a new destiny. Eventually coming across the High Evolutionary, the rechristened Adam Warlock eventually is recognized as a hero of the universe, chiefly protecting it from threats such as Thanos, the Universal Church of Truth, and his evil counterpart, the Magus. He is also frequently the bearer of the Soul Stone, one of the fabled Infinity Gems (now called Infinity Stones). The character also serves as the leader of the Infinity Watch and a member of the Guardians of the Galaxy, specializing as the group&#x27;s cosmic sorcerer and occult expert in the latter.

Adam Warlock has been adapted in various forms of media, including animated television series and video games, and was portrayed by Will Poulter in his live-action debut in the Marvel Cinematic Universe film &quot;Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3&quot; (2023).

==Publication history==

===1960s to 1970s===
The character&#x27;s origin was shown in &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; #66 (September 1967) in a story written by Stan Lee and pencilled and co-plotted by Jack Kirby. The character also appeared in &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; #67 (October 1967) and &quot;Thor&quot; #163–166 (April–July 1969). Because his role in the &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; story was minor, sources disagree on which issue is the character&#x27;s true first appearance. Writer and then editor-in-chief Roy Thomas and penciler Gil Kane significantly revamped Him as Adam Warlock in &quot;Marvel Premiere&quot; #1 (April 1972).

In 2009, Thomas explained he had been a fan of the soundtrack to the musical &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot; and sought to bring the story to comic books in a superhero context: &quot;Yes, I had some trepidation about the Christ parallels, but I hoped there would be little outcry if I handled it tastefully, since I was not really making any serious statement on religion... at least not overtly.&quot;

Choosing to use a preexisting character while keeping the series locale separate from mainstream Marvel Earth, Thomas created Counter-Earth, a new planet generated from a chunk of Earth and set in orbit on the opposite side of the sun. Thomas and Kane collaborated on the costume, with the red tunic and golden lightning bolt as their homage to Fawcett Comics&#x27; 1940s–1950s character Captain Marvel.

The story continued in the series &quot;The Power of Warlock&quot;, which ran eight issues (August 1972October 1973), with some plotlines concluded in &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot; vol. 2, #176–178 (June–August 1974).

In a 2009 retrospective survey of the character, writer Karen Walker said the series

Writer-artist Jim Starlin revived Warlock in &quot;Strange Tales&quot; #178–181 (February–August 1975). Warlock&#x27;s adventures became more cosmic in scope as Starlin took the character through an extended storyline referred to as &quot;The Magus Saga&quot;.

The reimagined title continued the numbering of &quot;The Power of Warlock&quot; and began with &quot;Warlock&quot; #9 (October 1975) and ran seven issues. The bimonthly series was initially written and drawn by Starlin, but was eventually co-penciled and inked by Steve Leialoha. Some plot threads were concluded in &quot;Marvel Team-Up&quot; #55 (March 1977), &quot;Avengers Annual&quot; #7 (November 1977) and &quot;Marvel Two-in-One Annual&quot; #2 (December 1977).

Starlin, in a 2009 interview, recalled,
Artist Alan Weiss recalled in a 2006 interview there was a &quot;lost&quot; Adam Warlock story, which if completed would have been reminiscent of the Jonathan Swift novel &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot;. Portions of it were printed in the second volume of &quot;Marvel Masterworks: Warlock&quot;. The remainder of the artwork was lost in a New York City taxicab in 1976.

Warlock&#x27;s adventures were reprinted, with new Starlin covers, in the six-issue &quot;Special Edition&quot; limited series &quot;Warlock&quot; vol. 2 (December 1982May 1983). This reprint series was itself reprinted, with yet another set of new Starlin covers, as &quot;Warlock&quot; vol. 3 (May–October 1992).

Although regarded as deceased at the time, Warlock made a brief appearance in &quot;Marvel Two-in-One&quot; #63 (May 1980).

===Modern iterations===
Eleven years later, Starlin revived the character and two members of his supporting cast in the miniseries &quot;The Infinity Gauntlet&quot; #1–6 (July–December 1991). This plot development was a continuation of a larger storyline that began with the resurrection of Thanos in &quot;Silver Surfer&quot; vol. 3 #34 (February 1990).

Following the events of &quot;The Infinity Gauntlet&quot;, Warlock and several compatriots starred in the series &quot;Warlock and the Infinity Watch&quot;. Initially written by Starlin and drawn by Angel Medina, it ran 42 issues (February 1992August 1995). Its plots tied directly into the limited series &quot;Infinity War&quot; (June–November 1992) and &quot;Infinity Crusade&quot; (June–December 1993).

Warlock starred in several limited series, including &quot;Silver Surfer/Warlock: Resurrection&quot; #1–4 (March–June 1993); &quot;The Warlock Chronicles&quot; #1–8 (July 1993February 1994); and &quot;Warlock&quot; vol. 4, #1–4 (November 1998February 1999), by writer-penciler Tom Lyle. The character was featured in the intercompany crossovers between Marvel Comics and the Malibu Comics &quot;Ultraverse&quot; in the one-shot &quot;Rune / Silver Surfer&quot; (April 1995 in indicia, June 1995 on cover); &quot;Rune&quot; vol. 2, #1–7 (September 1995April 1996), and the two-issue &quot;Ultraverse Unlimited&quot; (June and September 1996).

A version of the character starred in the four-issue limited series &quot;Warlock&quot; vol. 6 (November 2004February 2005), by writer Greg Pak and artist Charlie Adlard. After appearances in &quot;Annihilation Conquest: Quasar&quot; #1–4 (September–December 2007) and &quot;&quot; #1–6 (November 2007April 2008), he was a key character in &quot;Guardians of the Galaxy&quot; vol. 2, #1–25 (July 2008April 2010), &quot;The Thanos Imperative&quot; #1 (June 2010) and the &quot;Ignition&quot; one-shot (May 2010).

===Timeline===
Timeline of comics starring Warlock or wrapping up storylines from his ended series.

==Fictional character biography==

===First incarnation: Him, Counter Earth, and first death===
Scientists on Earth calling themselves the Enclave created an artificial, perfect human who initially calls himself &quot;Him&quot;. After rebelling against his creators, and having a conflict with Thor, Him decides to leave Earth and travels into space. He encounters the High Evolutionary who gives him the name &quot;Warlock&quot;. The High Evolutionary requests Warlock&#x27;s help in saving the artificially created planet Counter-Earth from the evil Man-Beast and gives Warlock the green Soul Gem (also referred to as the &quot;Soul Jewel&quot;), which allows Warlock to capture souls of other beings. When he arrives on Counter-Earth, Warlock is given the name &quot;Adam&quot; by four teenagers who befriend him. After the Man-Beast&#x27;s defeat, Warlock leaves Counter-Earth to find a new purpose.

In his travels through space, Warlock encounters the Universal Church of Truth, an intergalactic religious organization led by the corrupt Magus. Warlock allies with Pip the Troll, the assassin Gamora, and Thanos of Titan to oppose the Magus. Eventually, Warlock discovers that the Magus is a future version of himself who traveled back in time after being driven insane by the Soul Gem&#x27;s use. Warlock chooses to alter his timeline by visiting himself a few months into the future and steals his own soul to prevent the Magus from ever existing. Warlock then continues his journeys, knowing he has seen his own death but not knowing exactly when it will happen.

When the Stranger attempts to steal Warlock&#x27;s Soul Gem, Warlock learns about five other related gems. Thanos gains possession of these gems with the intention of destroying Earth&#x27;s sun. When Thanos causes mortal harm to Pip and Gamora, Warlock takes their souls to end their suffering. Warlock then enlists the aid of the Avengers, Captain Marvel and Moondragon to stop Thanos. During the battle, Warlock&#x27;s younger self appears and takes the older Warlock&#x27;s soul. Inside the gem, Adam is reunited with Pip, Gamora and others in a utopia known as Soul World. Warlock&#x27;s soul is temporarily freed from the Soul Gem, allowing him to turn Thanos to stone and save Earth.

=== Second incarnation: Infinity Watch and second death ===
Thanos (after being resurrected) once again collects the Infinity Gems into the Infinity Gauntlet, capturing the Silver Surfer and Drax the Destroyer in the Soul Gem for opposing him. In Soul Gem&#x27;s world, the Silver Surfer meets Adam Warlock and convinces him that his help is needed again to defeat Thanos. Warlock agrees and Pip and Gamora decide to accompany him. Warlock transmits himself and his two friends into new bodies and leads a group of Earth&#x27;s superheroes, defeating Thanos. Warlock obtains the Infinity Gauntlet, being a near-supreme being of the universe. The cosmic Living Tribunal decides that Warlock cannot be trusted to keep the Infinity Gauntlet and instructs him to divide the gems among other beings of Warlock&#x27;s choosing. Warlock keeps the Soul Gem for himself and gives one gem each to Pip, Gamora, Drax the Destroyer, Moondragon, and the reformed Thanos. Warlock dubs the group the Infinity Watch.

During Warlock&#x27;s temporary possession of the Infinity Gauntlet, he purged good and evil from his being, leaving him entirely a creature of logic. His good and evil aspects take on lives as two new physical beings — the evil half is a new incarnation of the Magus, while the good half is a woman calling herself the Goddess. When they threaten the universe, Warlock defeats them with the aid of the Watch and other superheroes, absorbing them into the Soul Gem.

The Infinity Watch disbands when the Infinity Gems are stolen by Rune, a vampire from a parallel universe. Warlock pursues Rune, recovering the gems and returning to his native universe.

Warlock plays a role in protecting the universe several more times, including threats from clones of Thanos, the Heart of the Universe, and the interdimensional being Hunger.

=== Third Incarnation: Annihilation Conquest, Guardians of Galaxy, Infinity Revelation, etc. ===

==== &quot;Annihilation: Conquest&quot; ====
In the 2007-2008 &quot;&quot; storyline, Moondragon and Phyla-Vell later seek Warlock&#x27;s help to free the alien Kree from the invading Phalanx. Once the Phalanx is defeated, Warlock joins the newly formed Guardians of the Galaxy. While with the Guardians, Warlock attempts to repair damage to the spacetime continuum, which causes him to be the Magus again. Once again leading the Universal Church of Truth, the Magus allies himself with Lord Mar-Vell, but is killed when he fails a mission. The Universal Church of Truth resurrects the Magus as a child, but he is quickly captured and imprisoned by the Annihilators. His cocoon remains under the Annihilators&#x27; watch.

==== The Infinity Revelation ====
While on a new quest, Thanos encounters Warlock&#x27;s soul in Death&#x27;s domain. It follows Thanos back to the living world, where it regains human form. Warlock accompanies Thanos on a journey as their universe merges with another one. Due to the convergence, Warlock is retroactively replaced by his counterpart from the other universe.

Extremely disgruntled by the experience, the new Warlock left Thanos to ponder his situation, and he eventually ended up on &quot;New Krall&quot; acting as a gladiator in a fighting pit. Thanos receives a message through time/space from his omnipotent former self to seek this new Adam Warlock who is now unnaturally more powerful than before. Agreeing, Thanos first seeks Pip the Troll to teleport to New Krall and then contacts Gamora to also go to Adam, as they both are his closest friends and can keep him from doing any damage to the universe. During this time Annihilus begins a re-invasion of the Positive Zone searching for an immense power source that turns out to be Adam himself and launches a devastating siege on New Krall. The Shi&#x27;ar, led by Gladiator (also looking for the power source), appear and Annihilus, now with the power of the Hulk and a new fear projection ability, defeats them. Pip swiftly teleports Adam, Gamora, the Guardians of the Galaxy, and himself back to the Guardians&#x27; ship to safety and are joined by Thanos, where they discover the universe that Adam created was not destroyed, but became a part of him and has given him the power of Eternity and Infinity.

Thanos enhances Pip&#x27;s abilities to teleport the ship to Annihilus&#x27; empire to stop Annihilus once and for all, but are overwhelmed by Annihilus, who teleports Thanos into limbo and takes Adam prisoner (by placing a neural disruptor on him), forcing the Guardians to retreat. Pip stays behind, stating Adam is his only friend and he will not abandon him. The comatose Adam is placed into Annihilus&#x27; ship&#x27;s power source to use him as battery. Pip, after hiding on Annihilus&#x27; ship for three months, finds the comatose Adam and launches a rescue mission, killing his guards and striking Adam repeatedly to waken him. Finally awakening, Adam unconsciously destroys the universe and is left floating in a void. Panicking, Adam calls out for Thanos and wills him back into existence. Thanos then proposes to Adam a plan to beseech the One Above All to recreate the universe. The One Above All agrees, on the condition Adam act as the universe&#x27;s new Living Tribunal. Adam and Thanos restore the universes and immediately kill Annihilus and his fleet, ending his threat once and for all. Finally, on Thanos&#x27; request, the &quot;new&quot; Living Tribunal resurrects the original Adam Warlock from the point he was killed moments before the convergence took place.

The true Adam, alive again, decides to take Thanos&#x27; advice to go back to &quot;the existence that is his&quot;. He immediately goes to Pip the Troll, who runs to his friend with open arms, and they return to their old life of adventure.

==== Infinity Quest ====
For reasons unknown, Adam finds himself within the Soul World where he is approached by an aspect of himself that reveals that the Infinity Stones are coming together once more which will ensure a calamity. This encounter is soon revealed to be one of many nightmares that are plaguing Adam so he travels to the Soul World again where he meets an aspect of Gamora&#x27;s soul that remained trapped there after she left long ago. Despite her pleas for him to release her from it, Adam denied being capable of doing so claiming he does not recognize her altogether and that he no longer possesses the Soul Gem. Escaping the Soul World, Warlock emerged from his cocoon in the world of the living, where he was greeted by Kang the Conqueror.

==== Infinity Conflict ====
In &quot;Thanos: The Infinity Conflict&quot;, when Adam senses that something is not right, he and Pip go to confront Thanos who then kills Adam in the blink of an eye. After reviving in Chandilar, Adam and Pip go to an abandoned ancient planet containing old temples. Here Adam is again killed by a rocket launched by Thanos. After another resurrection he and Pip go to Titan and encounter Eros. However, he is yet again killed by Thanos via another missile. He is then revived in the presence of the Living Tribunal who informs Adam that Thanos has gotten his universe&#x27;s Astral Regulator and used it to absorb the various Cosmic Beings to become reality. The Living Tribunal tasks Adam to follow the necessary steps to stop Thanos. While travelling to the Astral Plane, Adam encountered his past versions who warns Adam about the result of what he is about to do. He confronts Eros and Pip who were about to kill the infant Thanos and warns them that if Thanos died then Magus would be able to take over reality. They then return to the present where he kills Eros who then returns to life after being rejected by Mistress Death now existing outside the norm, just like Adam and Thanos, which is essential to defeat Thanos.

In &quot;Thanos: The Infinity Ending&quot;, after the future omnipotent Thanos absorbed the Living Tribunal and the Above-All-Others, Adam, Starfox and Pip realizing that they were too late escape, except for Adam who confronts Thanos before being banished by the omnipresent being within himself. Adam went to Kang the Conqueror&#x27;s ship where he sought to use his time-traveling technology to find a way to defeat Thanos, and realized that Thanos&#x27; inexperience is the key to his defeat. After waking Kang from the stasis he was put by Thanos, Adam decides to enter Thanos&#x27; psyche. However, before he could proceed he is confronted by his past selves who did not want Adam to sacrifice himself. Being unwilling to let Thanos kill himself and take all existences with him, Adam battles his past selves, eventually using the Soul Stone of one of the Adams to kill them. After that he enters Thanos&#x27; psyche where he saw different memories through portals, and eventually came across Hunger and manipulates the being into attacking the past future omnipotent Thanos. Still travelling through different portals, he finally came across the present Thanos who had been trapped within his future omnipotent self and Eros with Pip who try to free Thanos, but were discovered. After that Adam tells Thanos that the only way to defeat his future omnipotent self and get free was trust. Then as the future omnipotent Thanos was about to end everything, Adam had Kang prevent Eros to proceed with his plan allowing Eros to evade capture. This causes present Thanos to take control of his powers and reset everything prior to the machinations of his future self who ceases to exist. Finding himself outside everything Adam was rescued by Kang and informed the Conqueror on what had transpired. Before returning to normality, Adam asked Kang to go on one final time travel to retrieve the green soul stone.

==== Infinity Countdown ====
During the &quot;Infinity Countdown&quot; storyline, Adam Warlock realizes that he is at an unspecified time with Kang the Conqueror, who, with some convincing, shows a recap of Warlock&#x27;s history until finally revealing that the Infinity Stones are once more being gathered and shows a vision of the future – which Kang calls &quot;Infinity&#x27;s End&quot;in which an unseen calamity has befallen the universe after the Infinity Stones were reunited. Kang also reveals to Adam that they had tried to prevent the current outcome 112 times, but now Kang decides another course of action: he will send Warlock to retrieve the Soul Stone in exchange for Warlock giving him the Time Stone. Warlock reluctantly agrees as he explains that he hopes keeping the two gems apart will prevent disaster. Warlock arrives in ancient Egypt, where he meets the pharaoh Rama Tut, an earlier version of Kang. Rama Tut shows Warlock where he can find the Soul Stone in the future, in the hands of Warlock&#x27;s &quot;dark reflection&quot; the Magus. Rama Tut then seals Warlock in a tomb where he will awaken thousands of years in the future with a chance to claim the Soul Stone. Rama Tut&#x27;s guards, under his orders, commit suicide by poisoning, as Rama Tut claims that no one can know of the plot. Adam Warlock and Kang the Conqueror ambush the Guardians of the Galaxy during their trip to the planet Oblitus. Gamora attempted to take the Soul Gem from Adam Warlock. When Drax the Destroyer held onto the Soul Gem, he discovered that the Soulworld inside is corrupted. Drax knocked out Gamora and made off with Adam Warlock and Kang the Conqueror. As the rest of the Guardians of the Galaxy do not want to help Gamora pursue Adam Warlock and Kang the Conqueror, she went off on her own. Adam Warlock is among the Infinity Gem holders contacted by Doctor Strange, who states that they must reform the Infinity Watch to safeguard the Infinity Gems from such calamities like Thanos.

==== Infinity Wars ====
During the &quot;Infinity Wars&quot; storyline, Adam Warlock senses the corruption of the Soulworld and enlists Doctor Strange to help deal with the corruption in Soulworld. While dealing with a Souleater, it is revealed that Doctor Strange has the Time Infinity Stone. Doctor Strange tries to get Adam Warlock to give up the Soul Infinity Gem. Before leaving, Adam Warlock warns Doctor Strange that Kang the Conqueror is not the only person looking for the Infinity Gems. Adam Warlock saves a cyclist during a time freeze when he, Drax the Destroyer, and Iron Lad show up. Doctor Strange gathers Star-Lord, Adam Warlock, Black Widow&#x27;s clone, Captain Marvel, and Turk Barrett (who has Bullseye, Sandman, Spot, Tombstone, and Typhoid Mary in his company) in Central Park where Doctor Strange discovers that Thanos is dead. As Gamora in her Requiem alias uses the Reality Gem to partially fuse Captain America and Doctor Strange to get the Mind Gem and the Time Gem, Gamora beheads Adam Warlock. As Loki, Emma Frost, Hulk, Ant-Man, Ms. Marvel, and Kang the Conqueror gather together, they find Adam Warlock and suggest they exit the Soulworld only for Adam Warlock to declare that they need to defeat Devondra first. This causes them to round up Arachknight (a combination of Spider-Man and Moon Knight), Ghost Panther (a combination of Ghost Rider and Black Panther), Green Widow (a combination of Black Widow and She-Hulk), Iron Hammer (a combination of Iron Man and Thor), Man-Thing-Thang-Thoom (a combination of Man-Thing and Fin Fang Foom), Moon Squirrel (a combination of Moon Girl and Squirrel Girl) and Tippysaurus (a combination of Tippy Toe and Devil Dinosaur), Soldier Supreme (a combination of Captain America and Doctor Strange), Weapon Hex (a combination of Scarlet Witch and X-23), and Fantastic Two members Mister Invisible (a combination of Mister Fantastic and Invisible Woman) and Hot Rocks (a combination of Human Torch and Thing) as well as a saxophone-playing version of Drax the Destroyer.

Loki&#x27;s group and the warped heroes are fighting Devondra as Adam Warlock and Soldier Supreme arrive with the latter stating that he does not want to be unmade. Adam Warlock states that if they can defeat Devondra, Warp World will still exist, though Loki&#x27;s group will have to use the Infinity Gems to confront Gamora outside. Soldier Supreme notices that Devondra keeps regenerating as Adam Warlock finds that Gamora and the alternate Phylla-Vel and Moondragon are now in the Soul Gem. After some talking with Soldier Supreme, Adam Warlock plans to copy the souls in Warp World to bring them and Devondra into the real world as Hulk punches Devondra into the hole leading to the real world. Adam Warlock returns the Guardians of the Galaxy to their normal state while separating Drax&#x27;s Destroyer half from his Arthur Douglas half. Once the copies are made with the help of the Infinity Gems, Emma Frost begins to wipe the memories of the incident to avoid unrest as Drax meets the alternate version of his daughter. After Devondra is defeated, Adam Warlock grabs the Time Gem, freezes time, and states that the Infinity Gems must decide the outcome. After time resumes, Star-Lord notices that Gamora is gone as Adam Warlock sent her to a location so that she can redeem herself. Later on, Adam Warlock is staring at the stars in the desert and draws a symbol in the sand claiming that a part of him is missing.

==Powers and abilities==
Adam Warlock is regarded as an artificially created cosmic being whose existence represents a potential pinnacle of human evolution and cosmic origins influenced by greater powers. Within the Marvel Multiverse, he is recognized as belonging to the higher echelons of powerful beings. As a significant cosmic being, the character possesses recuperative powers that manifest through the creation of a cocoon. This cocoon serves to preserve the character, regenerate injuries, and facilitate his resurrection. Furthermore, he possesses immortality, although he can be physically killed, his soul and spirit cannot be permanently extinguished or claimed by the entity known as Death. Warlock is recognized as an astral outsider, rendering his actions, presence, and future impervious to perception by others through magical or cosmic methods.

In all his incarnations, Warlock consistently possesses artificial genetic structure that results in bone and muscle tissue denser than that of a typical human, granting him superhuman strength, stamina, durability, agility, and reflexes. Additionally, his multi-compartmental brain provides him with ultra senses, which grant him heightened levels of both cosmic and mystical awareness. Warlock&#x27;s body can also tap into cosmic energies to enhance his physical abilities.

=== Energy manipulation ===
One of the prominent abilities possessed by Adam Warlock is the manipulation of various forms of energy. As the character evolves, his energy manipulation powers grow stronger with each resurrection, granting him access to new energies to manipulate over time. In one of his more recent versions, the character&#x27;s manipulation abilities underwent a substantial increase, granting him the capacity to directly absorb energies from others and manipulate the energies within their bodies, effectively neutralizing their abilities. These formidable powers played a crucial role in his triumph over both Quasar and Silver Surfer on one occasion.

* Metaphysical quantum energy: In the character&#x27;s incarnation that followed the &quot;Annihilation: Conquest&quot; storyline, he is recognized for his manipulation of a unique form of energy, commonly referred to as Quantum Magic and Cosmic Sorcery (in other media). Referred to as a &quot;Quantum Mage,&quot; this magical practice allows him to manifest magical effects by utilizing the available energies and power in his surroundings, as well as employing &quot;conjured psi-llables.&quot; This grants him spell-casting abilities, energy manipulation abilities, time manipulation powers, and various other capabilities. These abilities were bestowed upon him to address the task of repairing reality in response to the future predicament caused by the expansion of the Fault into the Cancerverse, an event that occurred during his appearance in the &quot;Guardians of the Galaxy (2008)&quot; series. 

* Cosmic energy: In most incarnations, Warlock can manipulate cosmic energies, utilizing them for a range of purposes including healing, projecting energy blasts, and decreasing gravity to facilitate flight. These abilities are later facilitated by the character&#x27;s employment of &quot;quantum magic&quot;.
* Magical energies: In line with his name, Warlock acquired proficiency in magic, bestowing upon him spiritual powers. He possesses spiritual abilities that are distinct from the Soul Gem, enabling him to revive himself and other beings by transforming deceased bodies. Additionally, the character demonstrates the capability to conduct exorcisms, perceive the aura and soul of individuals, and display a high level of resistance against soul-manipulating powers employed by others. These magical abilities were later replaced by the character&#x27;s employment of &quot;quantum magic&quot;, which allowed for the same powers at a wider breadth.

=== Equipment ===

* Soul Gem: The Soul Gem possesses a consciousness of its own and demonstrates a vampiric hunger for the life energies of organic beings. It contains an idyllic pocket universe that hosts all the souls the Gem has ever taken. Using the Gem, Adam Warlock has demonstrated the power to devolve the followers of Man-Beast into the animals from which they evolved, as well as revert the Brute into Counter-Earth Reed Richards.

==Reception==
Throughout the character&#x27;s publication history, Warlock has garnered a dedicated following and achieved cult favorite status. This recognition can be attributed to his notable presence and the revamp of his character by Jim Starlin in the 1970s, as well as his significant involvement in the Infinity Gauntlet storyline.

==Other versions==
===The Magus===
There have been three incarnations of the Magus (), all of whom are the dark aspect of Adam Warlock.

The original Magus is an older, evil Adam Warlock who has traveled to the past and rules a religious empire called the Universal Church of Truth. To ensure his own creation, he guides his younger self through a series of actions that will result in him becoming the Magus. With the aid of Thanos, Warlock alters his future by killing his future self before he can evolve into the Magus, destroying the Magus&#x27;s timeline and erasing him from existence.

When Warlock acquires the Infinity Gauntlet, he expels good and evil from his soul, unintentionally giving them corporeal forms. The evil half names himself the Magus and attempts to gain the Infinity Gauntlet for himself. He fails when the Infinity Watch trick him into claiming the Gauntlet when the Reality Gem has been replaced by a powerless replica, creating a subtle flaw in the Gauntlet&#x27;s powers that allows his enemies to overpower him, leaving the Magus to be sealed away in the Soul Gem by Warlock. Since he is only part of a soul, he cannot interact with the other inhabitants of Soul World and exists only as a phantom. The Magus escapes the Soul Gem in an immaterial form, absorbing the life energies of others to regain tangibility. He is defeated by Genis-Vell and reverts to an ethereal entity. The Magus retaliates by wounding Genis&#x27; friend Moondragon and claiming she is destined to become his slave.

Warlock becomes a third version of Magus when he repairs damage to the spacetime continuum. This Magus works for the evil Lord Mar-Vell and is killed when he fails a mission. The Universal Church of Truth resurrects him as a child, who is then imprisoned by the Annihilators.

The Magus later seeks to gather the Infinity Stones with the intention of destroying the universe, but is killed during his search. During the &quot;Infinity Wars&quot; storyline, Gamora finds a younger version of Magus inside, who tells her he was sent by a &quot;friend&quot;.

===The Goddess===
The Goddess is the embodiment of Adam Warlock&#x27;s goodness, created when he uses the Infinity Gauntlet to remove the quality from himself. She appears as a central figure in the 1993 limited series &quot;Infinity Crusade&quot;. She assembles a collection of Cosmic Cubes and forges them into a Cosmic Egg. Using its power, she recreates Counter-Earth, dubbing it Paradise Omega. Embarking on a crusade to eliminate sin, the Goddess uses telepathy to control spiritual beings across the universe, recruiting them to her cause. When Warlock and Earth&#x27;s other heroes learn of her plan to destroy all sin by destroying anything capable of sin, they rally against her. She is defeated when her followers learn her true goal, and is absorbed into the soul gem.

===Earth X===
In the &quot;Earth X&quot; limited series, Mar-Vell is reincarnated as the child of the synthetic Adam Warlock/Him and Kismet/Her.

===Earth-19141===
This alternate reality is similar to that of Earth-616, up to the point when a cosmic event of great proportions took place and destroyed Earth-19141 which was then replaced by a new reality commanded by Thanos until it was eventually restored by Adam Warlock, who defeated Thanos and absorbed this reality&#x27;s energies into himself moments before being merged into Earth-616. Adam Warlock was then able to resurrect the original version of himself, and proceeded to become the new Living Tribunal as part of the deal he struck with the One-Above-All.

Following Ayesha&#x27;s death, Warlock attempts to destroy the High Evolutionary&#x27;s ship, but succumbs to his injuries and fails, though Groot rescues him. Inspired by Groot&#x27;s observation that everyone deserves a second chance, Warlock later saves Star-Lord and joins a new iteration of the Guardians under Rocket&#x27;s leadership.

<text>&lt;section begin=head /&gt;
In addition to the show&#x27;s regular cast of voice actors, celebrity guest stars have been a staple of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, an American animated television sitcom created by Matt Groening for the Fox Broadcasting Company, since its first season. &quot;The Simpsons&quot; focuses on the eponymous family, which consists of Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa and Maggie. The family was initially conceived by Groening for a series of animated shorts, which originally aired as a part of &quot;The Tracey Ullman Show&quot; between 1987 and 1989. The shorts were developed into a half-hour prime time series which began in December 1989. The series&#x27; 36th season premiered on September 29, 2024, and 782 episodes of &quot;The Simpsons&quot; have aired. A feature film adaptation of the series called &quot;The Simpsons Movie&quot;, was released in 2007.

Guest voices have come from a wide range of professions, including actors, athletes, authors, musicians, artists, politicians and scientists. In the show&#x27;s early years most guest stars voiced original characters, but as the show has continued the number of those appearing as themselves has increased.

The first credited guest star was Marcia Wallace who appeared in &quot;Bart the Genius&quot; in her first stint as Bart&#x27;s teacher Edna Krabappel. Singer Tony Bennett was the first guest star to appear as himself, appearing briefly in the season two episode &quot;Dancin&#x27; Homer&quot;. Several guest stars have featured as recurring characters on the show, including Phil Hartman, Joe Mantegna and Kelsey Grammer. After Wallace, Hartman made the most appearances, guest starring 52 times. Mantegna has appeared over forty times, Grammer, Maurice LaMarche, Jon Lovitz and Frank Welker have appeared twenty times or more; Albert Brooks, Glenn Close and Jackie Mason have appeared ten or more times, while Michael Dees, Dana Gould, Terry W. Greene, Valerie Harper, Jan Hooks, Jane Kaczmarek, Stacy Keach, Kipp Lennon, J. K. Simmons, Sally Stevens, George Takei and Michael York have made over five appearances.

Three guest stars, Ricky Gervais, Seth Rogen and Pete Holmes, earned writing credits for the episodes in which they appeared. Grammer, Mason and three-time guest star Anne Hathaway all won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance for guest voice roles on the show. The show was awarded the Guinness World Record for &quot;Most Guest Stars Featured in a TV Series&quot; in 2010. As of February 12, 2025, there have been 1010 guest stars on the show, with this figure rising to 1013 if &quot;The Simpsons Movie&quot; is included.

== History ==
Guest stars have appeared on &quot;The Simpsons&quot; since its first season, in addition to the show&#x27;s main cast of Dan Castellaneta, Julie Kavner, Nancy Cartwright, Yeardley Smith, Hank Azaria and Harry Shearer and supporting cast of Tress MacNeille, Maggie Roswell, Chris Edgerly, Dawnn Lewis, Grey DeLisle, Alex Désert, Jenny Yokobori, Kimberly D. Brooks, Tony Rodríguez and Jonathan Lipow and former supporting cast members Jo Ann Harris, Russi Taylor, Christopher Collins, Susan Blu, Lona Williams, Doris Grau, Marcia Mitzman Gaven, Karl Wiedergott, Melanie Minchino, Eric Lopez and Pamela Hayden. Kevin Michael Richardson started as a recurring guest star in the twenty first season, but joined the supporting cast in the twenty eighth, starting with the episode &quot;The Last Traction Hero&quot;.

Guest voices have come from a wide range of professions, including actors, athletes, authors, musicians, artists, politicians, scientists, historians, film producers, film directors, and animators. In the earlier seasons, most of the guest stars voiced characters, but eventually more started appearing as themselves. The first male guest star was actor Sam McMurray, who voiced a worker at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant in &quot;Homer&#x27;s Odyssey&quot;, the show&#x27;s third episode, and Marcia Wallace was the first female guest star on the show starting from &quot;Bart the Genius&quot; as Edna Krabappel and Ms. Melon. Singer Tony Bennett was the first guest star to appear as himself, appearing in the season two episode &quot;Dancin&#x27; Homer&quot; while Aerosmith were the first band with their cameo in the third season&#x27;s &quot;Flaming Moe&#x27;s&quot;.

Several guest stars have made multiple appearances on the show, often as recurring characters. Actress Marcia Wallace guest starred 176 times, making her the most recurring female guest star on the show, until her death in 2013. Edna Krabappel was then retired from the show, but sometimes appears as a ghost, and actor Phil Hartman guest-starred in 52 episodes, more than any other male actor, although his initial role in the second season episode &quot;Bart Gets Hit by a Car&quot; in 1991 was intended to be a one-off. He voiced the recurring characters Troy McClure and Lionel Hutz as well as numerous other one-time characters, until his death in 1998. McClure and Hutz were subsequently retired from the show. Actor Kelsey Grammer first appeared as Sideshow Bob in the first-season episode &quot;Krusty Gets Busted&quot; while actor Joe Mantegna made his first appearance as Fat Tony in the third season episode &quot;Bart the Murderer&quot;. The two have appeared in 21 and 28 episodes respectively; Mantegna also appeared in the film. Both roles were originally written for other actors: Bob was originally to be voiced by James Earl Jones, who later guest starred three times on the show, while Fat Tony was written for Sheldon Leonard. Other repeat guest stars include Albert Brooks, Glenn Close, Jan Hooks, Maurice LaMarche, Jon Lovitz, Jane Kaczmarek, Jackie Mason, Charles Napier and Frank Welker.

According to Groening, guest star choices &quot;come from the writers saying, &#x27;Wouldn&#x27;t it be cool to have [such a person on the show]?, while showrunner Al Jean has stated the reasoning is &quot;we want to meet our heroes.&quot; Bill Oakley and Josh Weinstein, showrunners of the seventh and eight seasons, favored guest stars with what they felt were unique and interesting voices such as actors R. Lee Ermey, Donald Sutherland, Kirk Douglas and Lawrence Tierney. In 2014, Jean stated that fewer people would be appearing as themselves, as the staff did not want it to become a &quot;crazy roster&quot;.

Many guest stars come into the show&#x27;s recording studio to record their parts, although some are recorded over the telephone. Three guest stars have been credited with writing the episode in which they guest starred. Comedian Ricky Gervais wrote the episode &quot;Homer Simpson, This Is Your Wife&quot;, while actor Seth Rogen co-wrote the episode &quot;Homer the Whopper&quot; with Evan Goldberg, and comedian Pete Holmes wrote the two-part &quot;Warrin&#x27; Priests&quot; episodes. Two guest stars were credited with pseudonyms. Actor Dustin Hoffman was credited as &quot;Sam Etic&quot; for the episode &quot;Lisa&#x27;s Substitute&quot; while musician Michael Jackson was credited as &quot;John Jay Smith&quot; for the episode &quot;Stark Raving Dad&quot;. After the latter episode, the producers decided that if a celebrity wished to guest star on the show, they had to be willing to be credited under their real name.

Numerous people have rejected the chance to appear on the show. Actor William Shatner has been described as the first person to reject the show. The producers have consistently failed to persuade any former President of the United States to appear. Musicians Bruce Springsteen and Bob Dylan have also rejected multiple invitations to guest star on the series. Other people to turn the show down include actors Michael Caine, Tom Cruise, Clint Eastwood and Anthony Hopkins and director Quentin Tarantino. Musician Prince turned down a role in a sequel to &quot;Stark Raving Dad&quot;, which meant the script was never produced.

Others have accepted the offer, but have been unable to record a role. Musician Frank Zappa and actor Anthony Perkins both became too ill to record their parts, while Jim Carrey had to drop out due to time constraints, and Faye Dunaway cancelled. Christopher Walken originally agreed to appear as himself in &quot;Insane Clown Poppy&quot;. However, he then decided to demand a lot more money than the producers were willing to pay. Instead, Jay Mohr provided the voice of Walken. The end credits state &quot;Jay Mohr as Christopher Walken&quot;. This is the first time this has ever been done.

Robby Krieger of The Doors recorded a cameo for the episode &quot;The Great Money Caper&quot;, but his part was cut because the writers felt his appearance seemed too forced. The scene was later included on the season&#x27;s DVD release. Similarly, actress Catherine O&#x27;Hara recorded the voice of Colette the waitress in &quot;Flaming Moe&#x27;s&quot;, but was redubbed with Jo Ann Harris who the producers felt was a better fit. Ron Howard, in what would have been his third appearance on &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, was advertized as guest starring on &quot;Children of a Lesser Clod&quot;. However, he did not appear for any recording sessions. Similarly, Werner Herzog was advertized as guest starring in &quot;Thanksgiving of Horror&quot;, in what would have been his third appearance as Walter Hotenhoffer, but did not appear in the final episode.

Mason, Grammer and Anne Hathaway have each won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Voice-Over Performance for their guest voice roles on the show. The show was awarded the Guinness World Record for &quot;Most Guest Stars Featured in a TV Series&quot; on May 23, 2010, with Guinness estimating that the show has featured &quot;at least 555 as of series 21&quot;. As of February 12, 2025, there have been 1010 guest stars on the show, totalling 1692 guest spots. These figures rise to 1013 and 1700 respectively if &quot;The Simpsons Movie&quot; is counted as well.

== Guest stars ==

* The color of the season number in the first column corresponds to the color of that season&#x27;s DVD boxset or digital purchase image for the seasons which have not been released in physical format.
* In the No. column:
** The first number refers to the order it aired during the entire series.
** The second number refers to the episode number within its season: i.e. 1506 would be the sixth episode of the fifteenth season.
* The production code refers to the code assigned to the episode by the production team. The first two characters refer to the season the episode was made for. The first season is 7Gxx, the second is 7Fxx, the third is 8Fxx and the fourth is 9Fxx. After that, the fifth season started with 1F and continued in order until season nine (which was 5F). Starting with season ten, the production codes started with AABF, with the first letter changing for each season (i.e. BABF, CABF, etc.). The number at the end of the code is the order in which that episode was produced during that production run.
* Guests with &quot;(archival)&quot; after their names refer to cases where roles were not recorded specifically for the episode, but instead archival audio and/or footage from independent sources was used in the episode. In most cases these appearances have been uncredited and are usually not considered as proper guest stars given the circumstances.

<text>The olfactory bulb (Latin: &quot;bulbus olfactorius&quot;) is a neural structure of the vertebrate forebrain involved in olfaction, the sense of smell. It sends olfactory information to be further processed in the amygdala, the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and the hippocampus where it plays a role in emotion, memory and learning.

The bulb is divided into two distinct structures: the main olfactory bulb and the accessory olfactory bulb. The main olfactory bulb connects to the amygdala via the piriform cortex of the primary olfactory cortex and directly projects from the main olfactory bulb to specific amygdala areas. The accessory olfactory bulb resides on the dorsal-posterior region of the main olfactory bulb and forms a parallel pathway.

Destruction of the olfactory bulb results in ipsilateral anosmia, while irritative lesions of the uncus can result in olfactory and gustatory hallucinations.

==Structure==
In most vertebrates, the olfactory bulb is the most rostral (forward) part of the brain, as seen in rats. In humans, however, the olfactory bulb is on the inferior (bottom) side of the brain. The olfactory bulb is supported and protected by the cribriform plate of the ethmoid bone, which in mammals separates it from the olfactory epithelium, and which is perforated by olfactory nerve axons. The bulb is divided into two distinct structures: the main olfactory bulb and the accessory olfactory bulb.

===Layers===
The main olfactory bulb has a multi-layered cellular architecture. In order from surface to the center the layers are:
*Glomerular layer
*External plexiform layer
*Mitral cell layer
*Internal plexiform layer
*Granule cell layer
The olfactory bulb transmits smell information from the nose to the brain, and is thus necessary for a proper sense of smell. As a neural circuit, the glomerular layer receives direct input from afferent nerves, made up of the axons from approximately ten million olfactory receptor neurons in the olfactory mucosa, a region of the nasal cavity. The ends of the axons cluster in spherical structures known as glomeruli such that each glomerulus receives input primarily from olfactory receptor neurons that express the same olfactory receptor. The glomeruli layer of the olfactory bulb is the first level of synaptic processing.

The glomeruli layer represents a spatial odor map organized by chemical structure of odorants like functional group and carbon chain length. This spatial map is divided into zones and clusters, which represent similar glomeruli and therefore similar odors. One cluster in particular is associated with rank, spoiled smells which are represented by certain chemical characteristics. This classification may be evolutionary to help identify food that is no longer good to eat. The spatial map of the glomeruli layer may be used for perception of odor in the olfactory cortex.

The next level of synaptic processing in the olfactory bulb occurs in the external plexiform layer, between the glomerular layer and the mitral cell layer. The external plexiform layer contains astrocytes, interneurons and some mitral cells. It does not contain many cell bodies, rather mostly dendrites of mitral cells and GABAergic granule cells are also permeated by dendrites from neurons called mitral cells, which in turn output to the olfactory cortex. Numerous interneuron types exist in the olfactory bulb including periglomerular cells which synapse within and between glomeruli, and granule cells which synapse with mitral cells. The granule cell layer is the deepest layer in the olfactory bulb. It is made up of dendrodendritic granule cells that synapse to the mitral cell layer.

== Function ==
This part of the brain receives sensations of smell.
As a neural circuit, the olfactory bulb has one source of sensory input (axons from olfactory receptor neurons of the olfactory epithelium), and one output (mitral cell axons). As a result, it is generally assumed that it functions as a filter, as opposed to an associative circuit that has many inputs and many outputs. However, the olfactory bulb also receives &quot;top-down&quot; information from such brain areas as the olfactory cortex, amygdala, neocortex, hippocampus, locus coeruleus, and substantia nigra.
Its potential functions can be placed into four non-exclusive categories:

*discriminating among odors
*enhancing sensitivity of odor detection
*filtering out many background odors to enhance the transmission of a few select odors
*permitting higher brain areas involved in arousal and attention to modify the detection or the discrimination of odors.

While all of these functions could theoretically arise from the olfactory bulb&#x27;s circuit layout, it is unclear which, if any, of these functions are performed exclusively by the olfactory bulb. By analogy to similar parts of the brain such as the retina, many researchers have focused on how the olfactory bulb filters incoming information from receptor neurons in space, or how it filters incoming information in time. At the core of these proposed filters are the two classes of interneurons; the periglomerular cells, and the granule cells. Processing occurs at each level of the main olfactory bulb, beginning with the spatial maps that categorize odors in the glomeruli layer.

Interneurons in the external plexiform layer are responsive to pre-synaptic action potentials and exhibit both excitatory postsynaptic potentials and inhibitory postsynaptic potentials. Neural firing varies temporally, there are periods of fast, spontaneous firing and slow modulation of firing. These patterns may be related to sniffing or change in intensity and concentration of odorant. Temporal patterns may have effect in later processing of spatial awareness of odorant. For example, synchronized mitral cell spike trains appear to help to discriminate similar odors better than when those spike trains are not synchronized. A well known model is that the bulbar neural circuit transforms the odor information in the receptors to a population pattern of neural oscillatory activities in the mitral cell population, and this pattern is then recognized by the associative memories of olfactory objects in the olfactory cortex. Top-down feedback from the olfactory cortex to the olfactory bulb modulates the bulbar responses, so that, for example, the bulb can adapt to a pre-existing olfactory background to single out a foreground odor from an odor mixture for recognition, or can enhance sensitivity to a target odor during odor search. Destruction to the olfactory bulb results in ipsilateral anosmia while irritative lesion of the uncus can result in olfactory and gustatory hallucinations.

=== Lateral inhibition ===
;External plexiform layer
The interneurons in the external plexiform layer perform feedback inhibition on the mitral cells to control back propagation. They also participate in lateral inhibition of the mitral cells. This inhibition is an important part of olfaction as it aids in odor discrimination by decreasing firing in response to background odors and differentiating the responses of olfactory nerve inputs in the mitral cell layer. Inhibition of the mitral cell layer by the other layers contributes to odor discrimination and higher level processing by modulating the output from the olfactory bulb. These hyperpolarizations during odor stimulation shape the responses of the mitral cells to make them more specific to an odor.

There is a lack of information regarding the function of the internal plexiform layer which lies between the mitral cell layer and the granule cell layer.

;Granule cell layer
The basal dendrites of mitral cells are connected to interneurons known as granule cells, which by some theories produce lateral inhibition between mitral cells. The synapse between mitral and granule cells is of a rare class of synapses that are &quot;dendro-dendritic&quot; which means that both sides of the synapse are dendrites that release neurotransmitter. In this specific case, mitral cells release the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate, and granule cells release the inhibitory neurotransmitter Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). As a result of its bi-directionality, the dendro-dendritic synapse can cause mitral cells to inhibit themselves (auto-inhibition), as well as neighboring mitral cells (lateral inhibition). More specifically, the granule cell layer receives excitatory glutamate signals from the basal dendrites of the mitral and tufted cells. The granule cell in turn releases GABA to cause an inhibitory effect on the mitral cell. More neurotransmitter is released from the activated mitral cell to the connected dendrite of the granule cell, making the inhibitory effect from the granule cell to the activated mitral cell stronger than the surrounding mitral cells. It is not clear what the functional role of lateral inhibition would be, though it may be involved in boosting the signal-to-noise ratio of odor signals by silencing the basal firing rate of surrounding non-activated neurons. This in turn aids in odor discrimination. Other research suggest that the lateral inhibition contributes to differentiated odor responses, which aids in the processing and perception of distinct odors. There is also evidence of cholinergic effects on granule cells that enhance depolarization of granule cells making them more excitable which in turn increases inhibition of mitral cells. This may contribute to a more specific output from the olfactory bulb that would closer resemble the glomerular odor map.
Olfaction is distinct from the other sensory systems where peripheral sensory receptors have a relay in the diencephalon. Therefore, the olfactory bulb plays this role for the olfactory system.

=== Accessory olfactory bulb ===
In vertebrates, the accessory olfactory bulb (AOB), which resides on the dorsal-posterior region of the main olfactory bulb, forms a parallel pathway independent from the main olfactory bulb. The vomeronasal organ sends projections to the accessory olfactory bulb making it the second processing stage of the accessory olfactory system. As in the main olfactory bulb, axonal input to the accessory olfactory bulb forms synapses with mitral cells within glomeruli. The accessory olfactory bulb receives axonal input from the vomeronasal organ, a distinct sensory epithelium from the main olfactory epithelium that detects chemical stimuli relevant for social and reproductive behaviors, but probably also generic odorants. It has been hypothesized that, in order for the vomernasal pump to turn on, the main olfactory epithelium must first detect the appropriate odor. However, the possibility that the vomeronasal system works in parallel or independently from generic olfactory inputs has not been ruled out yet.

Vomeronasal sensory neurons provide direct excitatory inputs to AOB principle neurons called mitral cells which are transmitted to the amygdala and hypothalamus and therefore are directly involved in sex hormone activity and may influence aggressiveness and mating behavior. Axons of the vomeronasal sensory neurons express a given receptor type which, differently from what occurs in the main olfactory bulb, diverge between 6 and 30 AOB glomeruli. Mitral cell dendritic endings go through a dramatic period of targeting and clustering just after presynaptic unification of the sensory neuron axons. The connectivity of the vomernasal sensorglomery neurons to mitral cells is precise, with mitral cell dendrites targeting the glomeruli. There is evidence against the presence of a functional accessory olfactory bulb in humans and other higher primates.

The AOB is divided into two main subregions, anterior and posterior, which receive segregated synaptic inputs from two main categories of vomeronasal sensory neurons, V1R and V2R, respectively. This appears as a clear functional specialization, given the differential role of the two populations of sensory neurons in detecting chemical stimuli of different type and molecular weight. Although it doesn&#x27;t seem to be maintained centrally, where mitral cell projections from both sides of the AOB converge. A clear difference of the AOB circuitry, compared to the rest of the bulb, is its heterogeneous connectivity between mitral cells and vomeronasal sensory afferents within neuropil glomeruli. AOB mitral cells indeed contact through apical dendritic processes glomeruli formed by afferents of different receptor neurons, thus breaking the one-receptor-one-neuron rule which generally holds for the main olfactory system. This implies that stimuli sensed through the VNO and elaborated in the AOB are subjected to a different and probably more complex level of elaboration. Accordingly, AOB mitral cells show clearly different firing patterns compared to other bulbar projection neurons. Additionally, top down input to the olfactory bulb differentially affects olfactory outputs.

=== Further processing===
The olfactory bulb sends olfactory information to be further processed in the amygdala, the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and the hippocampus where it plays a role in emotion, memory and learning. The main olfactory bulb connects to the amygdala via the piriform cortex of the primary olfactory cortex and directly projects from the main olfactory bulb to specific amygdala areas. The amygdala passes olfactory information on to the hippocampus. The orbitofrontal cortex, amygdala, hippocampus, thalamus, and olfactory bulb have many interconnections directly and indirectly through the cortices of the primary olfactory cortex. These connections are indicative of the association between the olfactory bulb and higher areas of processing, specifically those related to emotion and memory.

==== Amygdala ====
Associative learning between odors and behavioral responses takes place in the amygdala. The odors serve as the reinforcers or the punishers during the associative learning process; odors that occur with positive states reinforce the behavior that resulted in the positive state while odors that occur with negative states do the opposite. Odor cues are coded by neurons in the amygdala with the behavioral effect or emotion that they produce. In this way odors reflect certain emotions or physiological states. Odors become associated with pleasant and unpleasant responses, and eventually the odor becomes a cue and can cause an emotional response. These odor associations contribute to emotional states such as fear. Brain imaging shows amygdala activation correlated with pleasant and unpleasant odors, reflecting the association between odors and emotions.

==== Hippocampus ====
The hippocampus aids in olfactory memory and learning as well. Several olfaction-memory processes occur in the hippocampus. Similar to the process in the amygdala, an odor is associated with a particular reward, i.e. the smell of food with receiving sustenance. Odor in the hippocampus also contributes to the formation of episodic memory; the memories of events at a specific place or time. The time at which certain neurons fire in the hippocampus is associated by neurons with a stimulus such as an odor. Presentation of the odor at a different time may cause recall of the memory, therefore odor aids in recall of episodic memories.

==== Olfactory coding in Habenula ====
In lower vertebrates (lampreys and teleost fishes), mitral cell (principal olfactory neurons) axons project exclusively to the right hemisphere of Habenula in an asymmetric manner. It is reported that dorsal Habenula (Hb) are functional asymmetric with predominant odor responses in right hemisphere. It was also shown that Hb neurons are spontaneous active even in absence of olfactory stimulation. These spontaneous active Hb neurons are organized into functional clusters which were proposed to govern olfactory responses. (Jetti, SK. et al. 2014, Current Biology)

;Depression models 
Further evidence of the link between the olfactory bulb and emotion and memory is shown through animal depression models. Olfactory bulb removal in rats effectively causes structural changes in the amygdala and hippocampus and behavioral changes similar to that of a person with depression. Researchers use rats with olfactory bulbectomies to research antidepressants. Research has shown that removal of the olfactory bulb in rats leads to dendrite reorganization, disrupted cell growth in the hippocampus, and decreased neuroplasticity in the hippocampus. These hippocampal changes due to olfactory bulb removal are associated with behavioral changes characteristic of depression, demonstrating the correlation between the olfactory bulb and emotion. The hippocampus and amygdala affect odor perception. During certain physiological states such as hunger a food odor may seem more pleasant and rewarding due to the associations in the amygdala and hippocampus of the food odor stimulus with the reward of eating.

==== Orbitofrontal cortex ====
Olfactory information is sent to the primary olfactory cortex, where projections are sent to the orbitofrontal cortex. The OFC contributes to this odor-reward association as well as it assesses the value of a reward, i.e. the nutritional value of a food. The OFC receives projections from the piriform cortex, amygdala, and parahippocampal cortices. Neurons in the OFC that encode food reward information activate the reward system when stimulated, associating the act of eating with reward. The OFC further projects to the anterior cingulate cortex where it plays a role in appetite. The OFC also associates odors with other stimuli, such as taste. Odor perception and discrimination also involve the OFC. The spatial odor map in the glomeruli layer of the olfactory bulb may contribute to these functions. The odor map begins processing of olfactory information by spatially organizing the glomeruli. This organizing aids the olfactory cortices in its functions of perceiving and discriminating odors.

===Adult neurogenesis===
The olfactory bulb is, along with both the subventricular zone and the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, one of only three structures in the brain observed to undergo continuing neurogenesis in adult mammals. In most mammals, new neurons are born from neural stem cells in the sub-ventricular zone and migrate rostrally towards the main and accessory olfactory bulbs. Within the olfactory bulb these immature neuroblasts develop into fully functional granule cell interneurons and periglomerular cell interneurons that reside in the granule cell layer and glomerular layers, respectively. The olfactory sensory neuron axons that form synapses in olfactory bulb glomeruli are also capable of regeneration following regrowth of an olfactory sensory neuron residing in the olfactory epithelium. Despite dynamic turnover of sensory axons and interneurons, the projection neurons (mitral and tufted neurons) that form synapses with these axons are not structurally plastic.

The function of adult neurogenesis in this region remains a matter of study. The survival of immature neurons as they enter the circuit is highly sensitive to olfactory activity and in particular associative learning tasks. This has led to the hypothesis that new neurons participate in learning processes. No definitive behavioral effect has been observed in loss-of-function experiments suggesting that the function of this process, if at all related to olfactory processing, may be subtle.

==Clinical significance==
The olfactory lobe is a structure of the vertebrate forebrain involved in olfaction, or sense of smell. Destruction of the olfactory bulb results in ipsilateral anosmia.

==Other animals==

===Evolution===

Comparing the structure of the olfactory bulb among vertebrate species, such as the leopard frog and the lab mouse, reveals that they all share the same fundamental layout (five layers containing the nuclei of three major cell types; see &quot;Anatomy&quot; for details), despite being dissimilar in shape and size. A similar structure is shared by the analogous olfactory center in the fruit fly &quot;Drosophila melanogaster&quot;, the antennal lobe. One possibility is that vertebrate olfactory bulb and insect antennal lobe structure may be similar because they contain an optimal solution to a computational problem experienced by all olfactory systems and thus may have evolved independently in different phyla – a phenomenon generally known as convergent evolution.

&quot;The increase of brain size relative to body size—encephalization—is intimately linked with human evolution. However, two genetically different evolutionary lineages, Neanderthals and modern humans, have produced similarly large-brained human species. Thus, understanding human brain evolution should include research into specific cerebral reorganization, possibly reflected by brain shape changes. Here we exploit developmental integration between the brain and its underlying skeletal base to test hypotheses about brain evolution in &quot;Homo&quot;. Three-dimensional geometric morphometric analyses of endobasicranial shape reveal previously undocumented details of evolutionary changes in &quot;Homo sapiens&quot;. Larger olfactory bulbs, relatively wider orbitofrontal cortex, relatively increased and forward projecting temporal lobe poles appear unique to modern humans. Such brain reorganization, beside physical consequences for overall skull shape, might have contributed to the evolution of &quot;H. sapiens&quot;&#x27; learning and social capacities, in which higher olfactory functions and its cognitive, neurological behavioral implications could have been hitherto underestimated factors.&quot;

<doc id="462394" wikidata="Q221341" url="?curid=462394" title="Jason Kidd">
<text>Jason Frederick Kidd (born March 23, 1973) is an American professional basketball coach and former player who is the head coach for the Dallas Mavericks of the National Basketball Association (NBA). Widely regarded as one of the greatest point guards ever, Kidd was a 10-time NBA All-Star, a six-time All-NBA Team member, and a nine-time NBA All-Defensive Team member. He won an NBA championship in 2011 as a member of the Dallas Mavericks and was a two-time gold medal winner in the Olympics with the U.S. national team in 2000 and 2008. In 2018, he was inducted as a player into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame along with Steve Nash and Grant Hill. And in 2021, Kidd was honored as one of the league&#x27;s greatest players by being named to the NBA 75th Anniversary Team.

Kidd played college basketball for the California Golden Bears and was selected by the Dallas Mavericks in the first round of the 1994 NBA draft as the second overall pick. He was named co-NBA Rookie of the Year in his first season with the Mavericks, along with Grant Hill. Then, from 1996 to 2001, Kidd played for the Phoenix Suns and later for the New Jersey Nets from 2001 to 2008. He led the Nets to two consecutive NBA Finals appearances in 2002 and 2003. In the middle of the 2007–08 season, Kidd was traded back to Dallas. At age 38, Kidd won his only NBA championship when Dallas defeated the Miami Heat in the 2011 finals. He finished his playing career in 2013 with the New York Knicks. The following season, he became the head coach of the Nets, who had relocated from New Jersey to Brooklyn. After one season, he was traded to the Milwaukee Bucks, where he coached for four seasons until he was fired mid-season in 2018. After a season off, he was an assistant coach for the Los Angeles Lakers, with whom he won an NBA championship in 2020; he reunited with the Mavericks organization in 2021 to become the franchise&#x27;s head coach, reaching the Western Conference finals in his first season and later the 2024 NBA Finals in his third season.

Kidd&#x27;s ability to pass and rebound made him a regular triple-double threat, and he retired ranked third for a career in the NBA for regular season triple-doubles with 107 and third in playoff triple-doubles with a career total of 11. He ranks third on the NBA all-time list in career assists and second on the NBA all-time list in career steals.

==Early life==
Kidd was born in San Francisco, and raised in an upper middle class section of Oakland. His father, Steve, is African-American, and his mother, Anne, is Irish-American. As a youth, Kidd was highly scouted for AAU teams and tourneys, garnering various all-star and MVP awards. He attended the East Oakland Youth Development Center and frequented the city courts of Oakland, where he often found himself pitted against future Basketball Hall of Famer Gary Payton.

At St. Joseph Notre Dame High School in Alameda, under the guidance of coach Frank LaPorte, Kidd led the Pilots to consecutive state championships, averaging 25 points, 10 assists, 7 rebounds and 7 steals his senior season. During that year, he also received a host of individual honors, including the Naismith Award as the nation&#x27;s top high school player, and was named Player of the Year by &quot;PARADE&quot; as well as &quot;USA Today&quot;. The all-time prep leader in assists (1,155) and the state&#x27;s seventh-highest career scorer (2,661 points), Kidd was voted California Player of the Year for the second time and also a McDonald&#x27;s All-American. On January 31, 2012, Kidd was honored as one of the 35 Greatest McDonald&#x27;s All Americans.

After a highly publicized recruiting process, Kidd shocked many fans and pundits alike by choosing to attend the nearby University of California, Berkeley—a school that was coming off a 10–18 season and had not won a conference title since 1960—over a number of top-ranked collegiate programs including the University of Arizona, University of Kentucky, University of Kansas, and Ohio State University.

==College career==
In his first year playing for the Golden Bears, Kidd averaged 13.0 points, 7.7 assists, 4.9 rebounds, and 3.8 steals per game which earned him national Freshman of the Year honors and a spot on the All-Pac-10 team. His 110 steals set an NCAA record for most steals by a freshman and set a school record for most steals in a season, while his 220 assists that season was also a school record. His play was also a key factor in the resurgence of Cal basketball and helped the Golden Bears earn an NCAA Tournament bid, where they upset two-time defending national champion Duke in the second round of that tournament before losing to Kansas in the Sweet 16.

Kidd continued his success as a sophomore, tallying averages of 16.7 points, 6.9 rebounds, 3.1 steals and 9.1 assists, breaking his previous school record for most assists in a season with 272, while also leading the nation in that category. He was also selected a First Team All-American, the first Cal player to be so named since 1968, as well as Pac-10 Player of the Year, becoming the first sophomore to receive that honor. The Golden Bears made the NCAA Tournament again as a fifth seed, but was upset in the first round by Dick Bennett&#x27;s Wisconsin–Green Bay team 61–57. Kidd was also named a finalist for both the Naismith and Wooden Awards as college basketball&#x27;s top player and subsequently opted to enter the NBA draft in 1994. In 2004, Cal retired Kidd&#x27;s number 5 jersey.

==Professional career==
===Dallas Mavericks (1994–1996)===
====1994–1995: Co-Rookie of the Year and instant impact====
Kidd was selected as the second overall pick by the Dallas Mavericks, behind Glenn Robinson of Purdue, and just ahead of Duke&#x27;s Grant Hill. In his first year, he averaged 11.7 points, 5.4 rebounds, and 7.7 assists, and led the NBA in triple doubles, sharing 1995 NBA Rookie of the Year honors with Hill of the Detroit Pistons. The year before the Mavericks drafted Kidd, they finished the season with the worst record in the NBA at 13–69. After Kidd&#x27;s first season with the Mavericks, their record improved to 36–46 which, at 23 games, was the largest improvement in the NBA.

====1995–1996: First All-Star appearance and &quot;Three J&#x27;s&quot;====
In the following season Kidd was voted a starter in the 1996 All-Star Game. In his first two years with the Mavericks, the move most people associated him with was &quot;the baseball pass&quot;. Kidd was a member of the &quot;Three J&#x27;s&quot; in Dallas along with Jim Jackson and Jamal Mashburn. After promising beginnings, things turned sour among the trio. Mashburn&#x27;s injury combined with deteriorated personal relations between the immature leaders of the team resulted in the Mavericks taking a step backwards instead of further development. Kidd&#x27;s continued problems with the coaches affected the Mavericks&#x27; decision to trade their young star just in his third season in the league.

===Phoenix Suns (1996–2001)===
====1996–1998: First playoff appearances====
Kidd was traded to the Phoenix Suns with Tony Dumas and Loren Meyer for Michael Finley, A.C. Green, and Sam Cassell during the 1996–97 season. In his first full season with the Suns in 1997–98, the team&#x27;s win total improved by 16 games. The Suns, who finished the season with a 56–26 record, had been recognized for their fast-paced style of play with Kidd frequently leading a small lineup of four guards (Kidd, Kevin Johnson, Rex Chapman and Steve Nash) being on the floor at the same time together with Antonio McDyess playing at center. In the playoffs, Phoenix was eliminated in the first round by the San Antonio Spurs led by their Twin Towers duo, David Robinson and Tim Duncan.

====1998–2001: First All-NBA selections and leading the NBA in assists====
In the 1998–99 season, Kidd averaged 10.8 assists per game to dethrone Washington&#x27;s Rod Strickland as the league&#x27;s assists leader. He also led the NBA with seven triple-doubles (the rest of the league had just 11) and was second in the NBA with 41.2 minutes per game (behind Allen Iverson&#x27;s 41.5 mpg). Kidd averaged career highs in points (16.9 ppg), field goal percentage (.444), rebounds (6.8 rpg, best among NBA guards) and steals (2.28 spg, fourth in the NBA) and was the only player to be ranked among the top 50 in the NBA in 10 different statistical categories. The Suns won all seven of the games in which he had triple-doubles.

The Suns acquired Penny Hardaway from the Orlando Magic before the start of the 1999–00 season in hope of creating the best backcourt duo in the league. The combination of Kidd and Hardaway in the starting lineup was often labeled as the &quot;BackCourt 2000&quot;. Despite a decent 53–29 record, the Suns&#x27; season was spoiled by injuries to both of their superstars. Kidd, who broke his ankle late in the regular season, returned during the playoffs to help his team to beat the defending champion San Antonio Spurs and advance to the second round for the first time in his career. The Spurs were missing Tim Duncan because he injured his meniscus shortly before the end of the regular season and was unable to play in the playoffs.

The 2000–01 season was affected by Kidd&#x27;s personal problems as he was charged with domestic abuse of his wife. The Suns, who struggled in the middle part of the season, finished strongly with a 15–6 record to secure another 50-win season. Kidd took on more of the offensive load after his teammates encouraged him to be more selfish. He recorded 30-plus points six times on the year and five times in the last 19 games. In one particular hot stretch, he scored 36, 32, and 31 in three consecutive games in mid-March, prior to which he had never recorded consecutive 30-point games.

During his stay in Phoenix, Kidd made the All-Star Game in 1998, 2000, and 2001 (in 1999 it was not held because of a lockout) and led the NBA in assists for three consecutive years (1999–2001). It was also with the Suns that Kidd rose to the status of the league&#x27;s best playmaker as he was voted to the All-NBA First Team and NBA All-Defensive Team three years in a row (1999–2001).

===New Jersey Nets (2001–2008)===

====2001–2003: MVP runner-up and NBA Finals appearances====

On June 28, 2001, after five seasons in Phoenix in which the team made the playoffs each year, Kidd was traded, along with Chris Dudley, to the New Jersey Nets for Stephon Marbury, Johnny Newman, and Soumaila Samake. Kidd joined the franchise as the team was constructed around a sophomore Kenyon Martin, veterans Kerry Kittles and Keith Van Horn, along with rookies Richard Jefferson, Jason Collins, and Brandon Armstrong coming from the draft-day trade for the seventh pick Eddie Griffin. The 2001–02 season saw Kidd lead the Nets to a 52–30 finish, a 26-game improvement from the season before and the first 50-win season in the franchise&#x27;s NBA history. He was voted to the All-NBA First Team and finished second to the Spurs&#x27; Tim Duncan in MVP voting.

Under Kidd&#x27;s guidance, the young Nets team prospered through the playoffs, won the Eastern Conference title and advanced to the franchise&#x27;s first-ever appearance in the NBA Finals. Along the way, they had some memorable moments including a double overtime victory against the Indiana Pacers in the decisive Game 5. Indiana&#x27;s Reggie Miller forced the first overtime with a 35-foot three-pointer at the buzzer and the second one with a two-handed dunk, but the Nets eventually survived and beat Indiana 120–109. Kidd scored 20 of his then playoffs-best 31 points in the fourth quarter and overtimes. After defeating the Charlotte Hornets 4–1 in the second round, the Nets then faced the Boston Celtics in the conference finals. In that series Kidd and the Nets experienced the biggest fourth quarter collapse in the playoffs&#x27; history, when the Celtics came back from a 21-point deficit to win the pivotal Game 3, taking a 2–1 series lead. However, the Nets then won three consecutive games, while Kidd averaged a triple double for the entire series. In the NBA Finals, the Nets were swept in four games by Shaquille O&#x27;Neal and Kobe Bryant&#x27;s Los Angeles Lakers.

New Jersey enjoyed another stellar season under Kidd&#x27;s leadership in the 2002–03 season, during which the team finished 49–33 and reached the NBA finals once again. Kidd had his highest scoring season with 18.7 points per game and led the league in assists with 8.9 per game. This time Kidd was selected to the All-NBA Second Team. In the playoffs after splitting the first four games with the Milwaukee Bucks, the Nets recorded a 10-game winning streak, while sweeping the Celtics and the Detroit Pistons on the way to their second consecutive NBA Finals. In the Finals, New Jersey lost to Tim Duncan&#x27;s San Antonio Spurs in six games, even though the series was tied after the first four games.

====2003–2006: Coming up short, injury and surgery====
As an unrestricted free agent in the 2003 offseason, there was speculation that Kidd would join the defending champion Spurs and replace Tony Parker as their starting point guard. Parker, then young and unproven, was perceived to have &quot;limitations&quot; in his game that Kidd did not. However, Kidd decided to stay with the Nets on a 6-year, $99 million deal. In the 2003–04 season, Kidd averaged 15.5 points, 6.4 rebounds, and 9.2 assists (leading the league in assists for the second year in a row). The Nets led by Kidd finished the season 47–35 as their leader was voted to the All-NBA First Team for the fifth time in his career. In the playoffs however, they lost in the conference semifinals in a seven-game series against the Detroit Pistons, the eventual champions. Kidd went scoreless in the decisive Game 7 while playing with a serious knee injury.

On July 1, 2004, Kidd underwent microfracture surgery to repair a damaged knee. He made a full recovery and returned to the court for the 2004–05 season in December, during which the Nets acquired star swingman Vince Carter from the Toronto Raptors. With the Nets hanging on the prospect of missing the playoffs for the first time since 2001 and with Jefferson injured, Carter and Kidd combined to fuel the team to a late regular season surge that enabled them to inch past the Cleveland Cavaliers for the eighth and final playoff berth in the East. The Nets were eliminated in four games to the top-seeded Miami Heat in the first round.

In the 2005–06 season, Kidd averaged 13.3 points, 7.3 rebounds, and 8.4 assists. He and Carter led the Nets to a third-place finish in the East with a 49–33 record to clinch their fourth Atlantic Division title in the last five seasons. In April the Nets recorded NBA season-best winning streak, which was ended by the Cleveland Cavaliers at 14 wins in a row. Kidd was named to the NBA All-Defensive First Team for the fourth time in his career. In the playoffs the Nets beat the Indiana Pacers in six games in the first round, but later in the conference semifinal they were defeated again by the Miami Heat, the eventual champions.

====2006–2008: Triple-double postseason and final year in New Jersey====
Kidd was named a reserve for the NBA All-Star game along with teammate Vince Carter during the 2006–07 season. However, Kidd missed the game because of a strained back and was replaced on the roster by Joe Johnson. On April 7, 2007, Kidd and Carter became the first teammates to record triple-doubles in the same game since Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen did it in 1989 for the Chicago Bulls. In the first round of the 2006–07 postseason Kidd averaged 14.0 points, 13.2 assists, 10.0 rebounds, and 2.0 steals, as the Nets defeated the Toronto Raptors in six games. He joined Wilt Chamberlain and Magic Johnson as the only players in NBA history to average a triple-double in multiple playoff series. For the postseason, Kidd averaged 14.6 points, 10.9 assists and 10.9 rebounds in twelve playoff games. He became the second player in NBA history to average a triple-double for an entire postseason. Despite Kidd&#x27;s efforts the Nets were eliminated in six games in the Eastern Conference semifinals by the Cleveland Cavaliers.

In the 2007–08 season, Kidd became the third player to get a triple-double in three straight games since 1989. He did so after he logged his 97th career triple-double in a 115–99 loss to the Charlotte Bobcats. Kidd was voted by the fans to start in the 2008 All-Star game in New Orleans as a guard along with Dwyane Wade. During that season Kidd had been mentioned in trade rumors, notably to the Los Angeles Lakers, but the deal fell through when the Lakers refused to give up their young center Andrew Bynum. On January 28, 2008, Kidd revealed that his agent had been talking to the Nets&#x27; front office about a trade. On February 19, 2008, Kidd was traded to the Dallas Mavericks, the team that originally drafted him.

===Return to Dallas (2008–2012)===
====2008–2010: Final All-Star appearances and playoff upsets====

On February 13, 2008, the Dallas Mavericks and New Jersey Nets reached an agreement on a trade to send Kidd and Malik Allen to Dallas for Devin Harris, Devean George, Jerry Stackhouse, DeSagana Diop, Maurice Ager, two first-round drafts picks (in 2008 and 2010), and $3 million, but the trade fell through when George invoked his (Early) Bird rights, as was stipulated in his contract at the time. The trade was retooled, with Trenton Hassell replacing George, and Keith Van Horn, who had agreed to come out of retirement, replacing Stackhouse, because NBA officials informed the Mavericks that if Stackhouse were to be included in the deal, he could not re-sign with the team if the Nets chose to buy out his contract. Antoine Wright was also added to the retooled trade proposal (the two teams originally agreed on a separate deal that would have sent Wright to the Mavericks for a 2008 second-round pick, but were ultimately able include him in the Kidd deal). On February 19, 2008, Kidd was traded to the Mavericks along with Allen and Wright for Van Horn (via a sign and trade deal), Harris, Diop, Hassell, Ager, $3 million, and first round picks in 2008 and 2010.
The Mavericks hoped that Kidd would provide leadership to the team that for years had been labelled as weak mentally and help Dallas and its franchise-player Dirk Nowitzki win their first ever NBA championship. The Mavericks made a strong playoff push following the trade, but despite a 51–31 record, they were only able to secure the seventh seed in the highly competitive Western Conference. In the playoffs, they faced Chris Paul&#x27;s New Orleans Hornets, and were eliminated in five games in the first round.

The following 2008–09 season saw Kidd and the Mavericks stumble out to a rocky start, losing eight out of the first 15 games; however, the team finished the season strong to earn the sixth seed in the playoffs with a 50–32 record. Kidd finished the season ranked third in the league in steals with 2.0 per game, his best average in six years. In the playoffs, the Mavericks upset the San Antonio Spurs, with Kidd leading the team in assists in all but one game; the Mavericks reached the conference semifinals for the first time since 2006. Kidd&#x27;s season ended there as the Mavs lost to the Denver Nuggets in five games.

On July 5, 2009, Kidd verbally committed to re-signing with the Mavericks after being pursued heavily by the New York Knicks. The three-year deal reportedly was worth more than $25 million, all of it fully guaranteed. In the first year of Kidd&#x27;s new contract in the 2009–10 season the Mavericks finished second in the Western Conference with a 55–27 record during the regular season. However, the season ended with another disappointment as the Mavericks lost in six games to the San Antonio Spurs in the first round of the 2010 NBA playoffs. It was rumored that Kidd had gone through a flu just before the series began which might have affected his physical condition. He did not speak to reporters after Games 5 and 6 and skipped the team&#x27;s final meeting.

====2010–2012: NBA championship and Sportsmanship Award====
Kidd won the NBA championship with the Dallas Mavericks on June 12, 2011, defeating NBA All-Stars LeBron James, Dwyane Wade, and Chris Bosh and the Miami Heat. After appearing and losing in two different NBA finals, it was the first and only championship in his career. Despite a mid-season injury to Dirk Nowitzki, and a season-ending surgery to their starting small forward Caron Butler, the 2010–11 season turned out to be the best for the Mavs in Kidd&#x27;s era as they finished the regular season with a 57–25 record. On February 4, Kidd hit a three-pointer with 2.5 seconds remaining in the fourth quarter to give the Mavs a win in Boston over the Celtics, extending their winning streak to seven games.

Kidd sparked the Mavericks&#x27; impressive run with a total of 42 points in the first two playoff games against the Portland Trail Blazers. Dallas won the series 4–2. The Mavs then swept the two-time defending champion Los Angeles Lakers, with Kidd successfully guarding Kobe Bryant in decisive moments of close games 1 and 3. In the Western Conference finals against the Oklahoma City Thunder, Kidd was partly responsible for guarding young and athletic superstars Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook. Kidd hit a tie-breaking three-pointer late in overtime in a Game 4 victory at Oklahoma City to give his team a 3–1 lead. Dallas defeated Oklahoma in five games. In the NBA Finals, the Mavericks defeated the Miami Heat in six games, despite trailing the Heat two games to one at one point. At various points, Kidd was called upon to defend superstars Dwyane Wade and LeBron James. Kidd averaged 9.3 points, 7.3 assists, 4.5 rebounds, and 1.9 steals per game during the Mavericks&#x27; 21-game championship run. At 38 years of age, he became the oldest starting point guard ever to lead his team to the championship.

Shortened by a lockout, the 2011–12 season turned out to be the last for Kidd in the Mavericks uniform. With 39-year-old Kidd averaging career lows in minutes, points and assists for the regular season, the defending champions were swept by the Oklahoma City Thunder in the first round of the 2012 NBA playoffs. On May 3, 2012, Kidd won his first NBA Sportsmanship Award.

===New York Knicks (2012–2013)===

On July 12, 2012, Kidd signed with the New York Knicks. After making a verbal commitment to re-sign with the Mavericks, Kidd changed his mind and decided to sign a 3-year deal with the Knicks. Kidd was expected to act as a mentor to Jeremy Lin but after Lin left to the Houston Rockets, it was assumed that Kidd would serve as a backup to Raymond Felton at the point guard position. During the preseason however, the Knicks head coach Mike Woodson decided to start the season with both playmakers in the starting lineup and Kidd adjusting more to the shooting guard role.

With the new backcourt duo in the lineup, the Knicks opened the 2012–13 season with an 18–5 record while Kidd averaged 9.0 points per game on 44 percent three-point shooting in the first two months of the season. Nearly 40 years old, Kidd was asked to play almost 33 minutes per game in December. New York finished the season with 54 wins, an 18-game jump from the previous season. It was their first 50-win season since 1999–2000. The Knicks advanced to the second round of the playoffs, but lost to the Indiana Pacers in six games. Kidd struggled during the playoffs, when he was held without a field goal in his last 10 playoff games. It was believed that overworking Kidd during the regular season had strongly affected his performance in the second half of the season and left him burned out for the playoffs. Kidd retired on June 3, 2013, after one season with the Knicks and 19 seasons in the NBA. His announcement came two days after 1995 co-Rookie of the Year Grant Hill retired.

==Coaching career==
===Brooklyn Nets (2013–2014)===
On June 12, 2013, Kidd was named head coach of the Brooklyn Nets, replacing interim coach P. J. Carlesimo. He is the third person since the ABA–NBA merger to debut as an NBA head coach the season after he retired as a player. In September 2013, Kidd bought a minority ownership stake in the team (from Jay-Z).

On October 17, 2013, the Nets retired and raised his number 5 jersey to the rafters before a preseason game against the Miami Heat.

Kidd was suspended for the first two games of the season after pleading guilty to a misdemeanor DWI charge stemming from an incident in July 2012. Joe Prunty served as acting head coach for the team&#x27;s season opener in Cleveland and their home opener against Miami. He made his debut as head coach on November 3 in a loss to the Orlando Magic. On November 5, Kidd had his first victory as head coach in a 104–88 win over the Utah Jazz. On November 28, Kidd was fined $50,000 by the NBA for instructing his player Tyshawn Taylor to bump into him and intentionally spilling a cup of soda on the court in order to stop the game so his team could draw up a last-second offensive play against the Lakers.

After a loss to the Chicago Bulls on Christmas Day, the Nets dropped to a disappointing 9–19 record. Many critics started to question Kidd&#x27;s ability to manage a group of veterans that included Kevin Garnett, Paul Pierce, and Joe Johnson and there even appeared to be rumors that Kidd might be on his way out before the end of the season. However, the Nets were able to turn things around at the beginning of 2014 and finished the season with a 44–38 record, while Kidd began to get recognition for his coaching skills.

On February 3, 2014, Kidd was named the Eastern Conference Coach of the Month for January. On April 1, 2014, he was named Eastern Conference Coach of the Month a second time for March. He became the fourth coach overall to win both Player of the Month and Coach of the Month honors. He also became the second coach, after Jeff Hornacek of the Phoenix Suns, to win both honors with the same team.

In the first round of the 2014 NBA playoffs, the Brooklyn Nets eliminated the Toronto Raptors in a 7-game series. Kidd is the 19th rookie head coach in the league&#x27;s history to coach his team in a decisive Game 7 on the road, and became the first one to win it. In the semifinals, the Nets faced the Miami Heat and lost the series 4–1.

===Milwaukee Bucks (2014–2018)===

On July 1, 2014, the Milwaukee Bucks secured Kidd&#x27;s coaching rights from the Brooklyn Nets in exchange for two second-round draft picks in 2015 and 2019. The move did not come without controversy, as it was reported that Kidd had been seeking more management power over the Nets&#x27; general manager Billy King and after being denied began talks with the Bucks even though they still had a coach under contract in Larry Drew. He later stated that he felt the Nets truly did not want him nor were they committed to building a contender. In his return to Brooklyn on November 19, 2014, he was greeted with heavy boos and jeers.

The Bucks were one of the biggest surprises of the 2014–15 season. Under Kidd&#x27;s guidance, the young team improved from franchise-worst 15 wins in the previous season, finishing with a 41–41 record to advance to the playoffs as the 6th seed in the Eastern Conference. Milwaukee achieved that feat despite losing their 2nd draft pick overall Jabari Parker in December to a knee injury and trading star guard Brandon Knight to the Phoenix Suns in February. Kidd is the first coach in NBA history to lead two franchises to the playoffs in his first two years as a head coach. Kidd finished third in voting for the Coach of the Year Award behind Mike Budenholzer and Steve Kerr.

The 2015–16 season was less successful for Kidd, as the Bucks finished with a 33–49 record and did not qualify to the playoffs. On December 20, 2015, it was reported that Kidd would be out indefinitely as he would undergo hip surgery on December 21. While Kidd was recovering, his assistant Joe Prunty was acting as an interim coach. On a positive note, Kidd moved rising 21-year old Giannis Antetokounmpo into a point guard position, which helped the young player to record five triple doubles in the season and make progress in most statistical categories. Despite the disappointing season, the Bucks owners issued Kidd a vote of confidence and mentioned a possible contract extension, which was set to expire after the next season.

The following season Kidd led the Bucks to a winning record as they qualified to the playoffs for the second time in three years. Kidd had his projected starting unit available for just several minutes during the season. On February 9, the same day the shooting guard Khris Middleton was making his season debut after recovering from a hamstring injury, the power forward Jabari Parker went down with an ACL injury. Despite the setback, Kidd had the Bucks finishing the season strong with a 42–40 record. In the first round of the playoffs against the Toronto Raptors, the Bucks took a 2–1 lead after game 3, but went on to lose the series in six games. On January 22, 2018, the Bucks fired Kidd after the team posted a 23–22 record midway through the 2017–18 season.

===Los Angeles Lakers (2019–2021)===
On July 31, 2019, Kidd was hired as an assistant coach by the Los Angeles Lakers. Kidd would go on to win his second NBA championship when the Lakers defeated the Miami Heat in 6 games in the 2020 NBA Finals. It was his first championship as a coach at any level.

===Dallas Mavericks (2021–present)===

On June 28, 2021, Kidd was hired as the head coach of the Dallas Mavericks following longtime head coach Rick Carlisle&#x27;s resignation. During the 2021–22 season, Kidd helped lead the Mavericks to a regular season record of 52–30, which earned them the fourth seed in the Western Conference standings. This was the Mavericks&#x27; highest win total since the 2014–15 season when they finished 50–32, and their highest standings finish since the 2010–11 season, when Kidd was a player for the Mavericks team that finished as the third seed. In his first season as head coach, Kidd oversaw a defensive renaissance in Dallas, transforming a team that was among the worst defenses in the league prior to his tenure, into one of the top units in the NBA. Under Kidd, the Mavericks won their first two playoff series since their 2011 NBA championship when they defeated the Utah Jazz in six games in the first round of the 2022 NBA playoffs and the Phoenix Suns in seven games in the second round, advancing to the Western Conference finals. Kidd, along with Mavericks general manager Nico Harrison has been credited with improving the organizational culture and creating an environment more favorable to players than was present under former coach Rick Carlisle. Dallas&#x27; run was halted in the Western Conference finals as they fell short to the Golden State Warriors in five games.

The 2022–23 season was less successful for Kidd, as the Mavericks finished with a 38–44 record and failed to qualify for the playoffs. However, Kidd was instrumental in bringing Kyrie Irving to Dallas from the Brooklyn Nets, further improving the team for future success. On May 6, 2024, Mavericks signed Kidd to a multi-year contract extension. In 2024, following a season where the Mavericks failed to reach the playoffs, Kidd led the Mavericks to their first NBA finals appearance since their 2011 championship-winning playoff run, where they beat the fourth-seed Los Angeles Clippers 4–2 in the first round, top-seed Oklahoma City Thunder 4–2 in the second round, and the third-seed Minnesota Timberwolves 4–1 in the Western Conference Finals. In the Finals, the Mavericks lost to the Boston Celtics in five games.

==National team career==

Kidd&#x27;s first participation in USA basketball came after his first season in college. He was the only freshman chosen to take part in Team USA&#x27;s 10-member team. The team played five games in Europe and finished with a record of 3–2. Kidd tied for team highs in assists per game with 4.0, and steals per game with 1.4. He also had averages of 8.4 points per game, and 4.2 rebounds per game.

Kidd&#x27;s next stint with USA basketball came in 1999 where he participated in the USA Olympic Qualifying Tournament. The team finished with an undefeated record of 10–0 resulting in a gold medal and earning a berth at the 2000 Olympics. Kidd averaged 7.4 ppg, 6.8 apg, 4.4 rpg, 2.7 spg, and again led the team in APG and SPG.

In 2000, Kidd was appointed as one of Team USA&#x27;s tri-captains for the 2000 Olympics at Sydney. Kidd again led the team to an undefeated record of 8–0 which resulted in team USA winning the gold medal at the Olympic Games. Kidd had averages of 6.0 ppg, 5.3 rpg, and had team highs of 4.4 apg, and 1.1 spg. Kidd also had a FG% of 51.6 and shot 50 percent from three-point range.

In November 2002, Kidd was selected to participate in the 2002 USA Basketball Men&#x27;s World Championship Team. However, he had to withdraw from the team due to an injury.

Kidd came back the next year and participated at the 2003 FIBA Americas Olympic Qualifying Tournament in Puerto Rico. Kidd again led the team to a record of 10–0, bringing home the gold medal and a berth at the 2004 Olympics. Kidd started all 10 games and had averages of 3.4 ppg, 2.7 rpg, 5.9 apg, and 1.2 spg.

However, Kidd again had to withdraw from the 2004 Olympic team due to another injury.

Kidd had averages of 1.8 ppg, 3.3 rpg, 4.6 apg, and 1.3 spg. He also shot 60% from the field and 62.5% from three-point distance. Kidd led the entire tournament with an assist-to-turnover ratio of 9.20. With Kidd&#x27;s help team USA averaged 116.7 ppg, and defeated their opponents by a margin of 39.5 ppg.

In 2008, Kidd participated in the 2008 Olympics where the team yet again went undefeated in winning their first gold medal since the 2000 Olympics. The team, given the &quot;Redeem team&quot; moniker because of failures in the 2002 FIBA World Championship, 2004 Summer Olympics and 2006 FIBA World Championship, were once again crowned to be the best team in world basketball.

Overall, Kidd brought home five gold medals as member of the national team: three from Olympic qualifying tournaments, one from the 2000 Sydney Olympics, and one from the 2008 Beijing Olympics.

==Player profile==

Kidd retired second all-time in NBA history in both assists and steals behind John Stockton. He led the NBA in assists five times. His 107 career triple-doubles are sixth all-time, trailing Russell Westbrook, Oscar Robertson, Magic Johnson, Nikola Jokić, and LeBron James. Kidd finished his career with averages of 12.6 points, 8.7 assists, 6.3 rebounds, and 1.9 steals in 1,391 regular season games. He impacted games with his accurate passes and by involving his teammates; scoring was not his focus. He is considered by many to be one of the best rebounding guards ever to play in the league, and ESPN called him &quot;one of the best passing and rebounding point guards in NBA history.&quot; In 2021, to commemorate the NBA&#x27;s 75th Anniversary &quot;The Athletic&quot; ranked their top 75 players of all time, and named Kidd as the 36th greatest player in NBA history.

Although Kidd was considered a poor outside shooter when he began his pro career, he retired ranked third all-time in the NBA in three-point field goals made. &quot;The New York Times&quot; called his improvement as a shooter &quot;perhaps Kidd&#x27;s biggest, and most surprising, transformation&quot;. He considered his NBA championship with Dallas and his two gold medals in the Olympics as tied for the top highlights of his career, followed by the co-Rookie of the Year he shared with Grant Hill.

==Personal life==
Kidd married his first wife, Joumana, in 1997. In January 2001, he was arrested and pled guilty to a domestic abuse charge for assaulting her. As part of his plea, Kidd was ordered to attend anger management classes for six months. Kidd completed the mandatory counseling and continued to attend on his own. On January 9, 2007, Kidd filed for divorce, citing &quot;extreme cruelty&quot; during their relationship. He contended intense jealousy, paranoia and the threat of &quot;false domestic abuse claims&quot; to the police as reasons for the divorce. On February 15, 2007, Joumana Kidd filed a counterclaim for divorce, claiming that Jason, among instances of abuse, &quot;broke her rib and damaged her hearing by smashing her head into the console of a car.&quot; The couple has three children.

On September 10, 2011, Kidd married Porschla Coleman, a former model.

On July 15, 2012, Kidd was arrested by police in Southampton Town, New York and charged with the misdemeanor of driving while intoxicated. According to police, around 2 a.m. Kidd&#x27;s vehicle struck a telephone pole a few blocks away from his home and ended up in the woods, where officers determined him to be under the influence.

<doc id="462395" wikidata="Q7979392" url="?curid=462395" title="Week Ending">
<text>Week Ending was a satirical radio current affairs sketch show broadcast on BBC Radio 4 between 1970 and 1998. It was devised by writer-producers Simon Brett and David Hatch and was originally hosted by &quot;Nationwide&quot; presenter Michael Barratt.

The show&#x27;s title was always announced as &quot;Week Ending...&quot; followed by the broadcast date, although the ellipsis was dropped from its billed title in &quot;Radio Times&quot; during the mid-1970s. The show was written and recorded shortly before the first broadcast (which was usually on a Friday evening) and satirised events of the week. Each show concluded with &quot;And now here is Next Week&#x27;s News&quot;, although this collection of one-liners was abandoned in the early 1990s. Short gags were thereafter scattered throughout the show. Relatively few editions survive in the BBC archives, and they are rarely repeated.

==Contributors and cast==

&quot;Week Ending&quot; was considered a &quot;training ground&quot; for a large number of comedy writers, performers and producers. Many young BBC production recruits were given the programme for a month or so in order to get to grips with scripted comedy and working with performers. The programme also accepted material by post, fax and e-mail. This open door policy, which it shared with Radio 2&#x27;s long-running &quot;News Huddlines&quot;, made it a point of entry for writers who went on to have successful careers in British radio and television.

Script contributors included Andy Hamilton, Mark Burton, John O&#x27;Farrell, Guy Jenkin, Andy Riley, Kevin Cecil, Richard Herring, D. A. (Debbie) Barham, Peter Baynham, Julian Dutton, Harry Hill, Al Murray, Ben Moor, Tony Lee, Rich Johnston, David Baddiel, Rob Newman, Graeme Sutherland, Kim Morrissey, Barry Pilton, Paddy Murray, Ivan Shakespeare, Barry Atkins, Stewart Lee, Colin Bostock-Smith and Martin Curtis.

Regular performers during the run included David Jason, Bill Wallis, Nigel Rees, David Tate, Jon Glover, Sheila Steafel, Alison Steadman, Tracey Ullman, Toby Longworth, Chris Emmett and Sally Grace.

For several months during 1997, &quot;Week Ending&quot; carried a musical number written by Gerard Foster and performed by Richie Webb. This broke a lengthy hiatus for musical content, which until 1982 had involved Bill McGuffie, David Firman and Steve Brown.

Amongst the producers were John Lloyd, Douglas Adams, David Tyler, Jimmy Mulville, Harry Thompson, Gareth Edwards, Armando Iannucci, Jon Magnusson, Geoffrey Perkins, Griff Rhys Jones, Sarah Smith and Adam Tandy.

==Broadcast==

Until 1983, &quot;Week Ending&quot; was taken off the air during election campaigns. As sensitivities eased, it was allowed to remain on air during the 1987, 1992 and 1997 elections, albeit with rigid levels of political balance.

During the 1980s and 1990s, the BBC World Service broadcast a highlights programme once a month. This would include sketches from &quot;Week Ending&quot; episodes transmitted during the previous four weeks, more usually the items that could easily be understood by an international audience. This was broadcast by the World Service, usually on the last Friday of the month, under the title of &quot;Two Cheers for &quot;[month]&quot; &quot;. For many years, there was also an annual highlights show, akin to &quot;Year Ending&quot;, called &quot;Two Cheers for 1982&quot; (etc.).

From the early 1980s, the theme tune was a loop of the instrumental section of The Associates&#x27; 1982 hit &quot;Party Fears Two&quot;, which replaced the original &#x27;whistled&#x27; flute piece, &quot;Smokey Joe&quot;. Over the years, the tune changed a number of times – totalling four pieces, the third debuting in 1993 and the fourth in 1997 – but the final edition in 1998 finished with the original (each of the others having been heard briefly in sketches set in earlier decades).

==Tie-ins==

Series writers Ian Brown and James Hendrie wrote a book based on the series in 1985, &quot;The Cabinet Leaks&quot;. &quot;Ten Years With Maggie&quot;, a cassette compilation of sketches written during Thatcher&#x27;s tenure as Prime Minister, emerged in 1989 and was reissued on CD as &quot;Week Ending with Maggie&quot; in April 2009.

<doc id="462396" wikidata="Q790454" url="?curid=462396" title="Baryogenesis">
<text>In physical cosmology, baryogenesis (also known as baryosynthesis) is the physical process that is hypothesized to have taken place during the early universe to produce baryonic asymmetry, the observation that only matter (baryons) and not antimatter (antibaryons) is detected in universe other than in cosmic ray collisions.
Since it is assumed in cosmology that the particles we see were created using the same physics we measure today, and in particle physics experiments today matter and antimatter are always symmetric, the dominance of matter over antimatter is unexplained. 

A number of theoretical mechanisms are proposed to account for this discrepancy, namely identifying conditions that favour symmetry breaking and the creation of normal matter (as opposed to antimatter). This imbalance has to be exceptionally small, on the order of 1 in every (≈) particles a small fraction of a second after the Big Bang. After most of the matter and antimatter was annihilated, what remained was all the baryonic matter in the current universe, along with a much greater number of bosons. Experiments reported in 2010 at Fermilab, however, seem to show that this imbalance is much greater than previously assumed. These experiments involved a series of particle collisions and found that the amount of generated matter was approximately 1% larger than the amount of generated antimatter. The reason for this discrepancy is not yet known.

Most grand unified theories explicitly break the baryon number symmetry, which would account for this discrepancy, typically invoking reactions mediated by very massive X bosons or massive Higgs bosons (). The rate at which these events occur is governed largely by the mass of the intermediate or particles, so by assuming these reactions are responsible for the majority of the baryon number seen today, a maximum mass can be calculated above which the rate would be too slow to explain the presence of matter today. These estimates predict that a large volume of material will occasionally exhibit a spontaneous proton decay, which has not been observed. Therefore, the imbalance between matter and antimatter remains a mystery.

Baryogenesis theories are based on different descriptions of the interaction between fundamental particles. Two main theories are electroweak baryogenesis, which would occur during the electroweak phase transition, and the GUT baryogenesis, which would occur during or shortly after the grand unification epoch. Quantum field theory and statistical physics are used to describe such possible mechanisms.

Baryogenesis is followed by primordial nucleosynthesis, when atomic nuclei began to form.

== Background ==
The majority of ordinary matter in the universe is found in atomic nuclei, which are made of neutrons and protons. There is no evidence of primordial antimatter. In the universe about 1 in 10,000 protons are antiprotons, consistent with ongoing production due to cosmic rays. Possible domains of antimatter in other parts of the universe is inconsistent with the lack of measurable of gamma radiation background. 

Furthermore, accurate predictions of Big Bang nucleosynthesis depend upon the value of the baryon asymmetry factor (see ).
The match between the predictions and observations of the nucleosynthesis model constrains the value of this baryon asymmetry factor. In particular, if the model computed with equal amounts of baryons and antibaryons, they annihilate each other so completely that not enough baryons are left to create nucleons.

There are two main interpretations for this disparity: either the universe began with a small preference for matter (total baryonic number of the universe different from zero), or the universe was originally perfectly symmetric, but somehow a set of particle physics phenomena contributed to a small imbalance in favour of matter over time. The goal of cosmological theories of baryogenesis is to explain the baryon asymmetry factor using quantum field theory of elementary particles.

== Sakharov conditions ==

In 1967, Andrei Sakharov proposed a set of three necessary conditions that a baryon-generating interaction must satisfy to produce matter and antimatter at different rates. These conditions were inspired by the recent discoveries of the cosmic microwave background and CP-violation in the neutral kaon system. The three necessary &quot;Sakharov conditions&quot; are:
* Baryon number formula_1 violation.
* C-symmetry and CP-symmetry violation.
* Interactions out of thermal equilibrium.

Baryon number violation is a necessary condition to produce an excess of baryons over anti-baryons. But C-symmetry violation is also needed so that the interactions which produce more baryons than anti-baryons will not be counterbalanced by interactions which produce more anti-baryons than baryons. CP-symmetry violation is similarly required because otherwise equal numbers of left-handed baryons and right-handed anti-baryons would be produced, as well as equal numbers of left-handed anti-baryons and right-handed baryons. Finally, the last condition, known as the out-of-equilibrium decay scenario, states that the rate of a reaction which generates baryon-asymmetry must be less than the rate of expansion of the universe. This ensures the particles and their corresponding antiparticles do not achieve thermal equilibrium due to rapid expansion decreasing the occurrence of pair-annihilation. The interactions must be out of thermal equilibrium at the time of the baryon-number and C/CP symmetry violating decay occurs to generate the asymmetry.

== In the Standard Model ==

The Standard Model can incorporate baryogenesis, though the amount of net baryons (and leptons) thus created may not be sufficient to account for the present baryon asymmetry. There is a required one excess quark per billion quark-antiquark pairs in the early universe in order to provide all the observed matter in the universe. This insufficiency has not yet been explained, theoretically or otherwise.

Baryogenesis within the Standard Model requires the electroweak symmetry breaking to be a first-order cosmological phase transition, since otherwise sphalerons wipe out any baryon asymmetry that happened up to the phase transition. Beyond this, the remaining amount of baryon non-conserving interactions is negligible.

The phase transition domain wall breaks the P-symmetry spontaneously, allowing for CP-symmetry violating interactions to break C-symmetry on both its sides. Quarks tend to accumulate on the broken phase side of the domain wall, while anti-quarks tend to accumulate on its unbroken phase side. Due to CP-symmetry violating electroweak interactions, some amplitudes involving quarks are not equal to the corresponding amplitudes involving anti-quarks, but rather have opposite phase (see CKM matrix and Kaon); since time reversal takes an amplitude to its complex conjugate, CPT-symmetry is conserved in this entire process.

Though some of their amplitudes have opposite phases, both quarks and anti-quarks have positive energy, and hence acquire the same phase as they move in space-time. This phase also depends on their mass, which is identical but depends both on flavor and on the Higgs VEV which changes along the domain wall. Thus certain sums of amplitudes for quarks have different absolute values compared to those of anti-quarks. In all, quarks and anti-quarks may have different reflection and transmission probabilities through the domain wall, and it turns out that more quarks coming from the unbroken phase are transmitted compared to anti-quarks.

Thus there is a net baryonic flux through the domain wall. Due to sphaleron transitions, which are abundant in the unbroken phase, the net anti-baryonic content of the unbroken phase is wiped out as anti-baryons are transformed into leptons. However, sphalerons are rare enough in the broken phase as not to wipe out the excess of baryons there. In total, there is net creation of baryons (as well as leptons).

In this scenario, non-perturbative electroweak interactions (i.e. the sphaleron) are responsible for the B-violation, the perturbative electroweak Lagrangian is responsible for the CP-violation, and the domain wall is responsible for the lack of thermal equilibrium and the P-violation; together with the CP-violation it also creates a C-violation in each of its sides.

== Relation to Big Bang nucleosynthesis ==
The central question to baryogenesis is what causes the preference for matter over antimatter in the universe, as well as the magnitude of this asymmetry. An important quantifier is the &quot;asymmetry parameter&quot;, given by
formula_2
where and refer to the number density of baryons and antibaryons respectively and is the number density of cosmic background radiation photons.

According to the Big Bang model, matter decoupled from the cosmic background radiation (CBR) at a temperature of roughly kelvin, corresponding to an average kinetic energy of / () = . After the decoupling, the &quot;total&quot; number of CBR photons remains constant. Therefore, due to space-time expansion, the photon density decreases. The photon density at equilibrium temperature is given by
formula_3
with as the Boltzmann constant, as the Planck constant divided by and as the speed of light in vacuum, and as Apéry&#x27;s constant. At the current CBR photon temperature of , this corresponds to a photon density of around 411 CBR photons per cubic centimeter.

Therefore, the asymmetry parameter , as defined above, is &quot;not&quot; the &quot;best&quot; parameter. Instead, the preferred asymmetry parameter uses the entropy density ,
formula_4
because the entropy density of the universe remained reasonably constant throughout most of its evolution. The entropy density is
formula_5
with and as the pressure and density from the energy density tensor , and as the effective number of degrees of freedom for &quot;massless&quot; particles at temperature (in so far as holds),
formula_6
for bosons and fermions with and degrees of freedom at temperatures and respectively. At the present epoch, .

== Other models ==
=== B-meson decay ===
Another possible explanation for the cause of baryogenesis is the decay reaction of B-mesogenesis. This phenomenon suggests that in the early universe, particles such as the B-meson decay into a visible Standard Model baryon as well as a dark antibaryon that is invisible to current observation techniques. 
=== Asymmetric Dark Matter ===
The asymmetric dark matter proposal investigates mechanisms that would explain the abundance of dark matter but lack of dark antimatter as the consequence of the same effect as would explain baryogenesis.
