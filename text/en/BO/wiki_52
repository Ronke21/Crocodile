<text>The University of Genoa, known also with the acronym UniGe (), is a public research university. It is one of the largest universities in Italy and it is located in the city of Genoa, on the Italian Riviera in the Liguria region of northwestern Italy. The original university was founded in 1481.

==Campuses==
The University of Genoa is organized in several independent campuses located in different city areas:

*The Balbi campus: includes the Rectorate, the central administration offices, the departments of Economics, Humanities, Philosophy, Languages, Law and Political Science;
* The Sarzano campus: includes the departments of Education Sciences and Architecture;
* The Albaro campus: comprises the departments of Engineering;
* The Valletta Puggia campus: comprises the Departments of Mathematics, Physics and Chemistry;
* The San Martino campus: comprises the Departments of Medicine and Earth Sciences;
Of great historical and artistic interest are the buildings in Via Balbi and in particular: the main university premises (via Balbi, 5) designed by the architect Bartolomeo Bianco and built in 1640, Palazzo Balbi Cattaneo (via Balbi, 2), and Palazzo Balbi Senarega (via Balbi, 4). Also of major historical interest is the complex of Albergo dei Poveri (piazza Emanuele Brignole).

The university&#x27;s botanical garden, the Orto Botanico dell&#x27;Università di Genova, occupies one hectare in the city center, just above the university&#x27;s main building.

University of Genoa also has a number of regional campuses in Savona, Imperia, Ventimiglia and La Spezia. In particular,

* The Savona campus: hosts courses in Engineering, Medicine and Communication Sciences;
* The La Spezia campus: hosts courses in Engineering, Design, Economics and Law;
* The Imperia campus: hosts courses in Law and Economics.
Near Ventimiglia, the University of Genoa operates the Hanbury Botanical Garden, a Protected Area and candidate for UNESCO World Heritage status within the &quot;Mediterranean Alps&quot; project. 

== History ==

In the 13th century in Genoa there were already Colleges which conferred degrees in law, theology, medicine and arts.

The College of Theology was established officially in 1471 with a papal bull of Sixtus IV (Francesco della Rovere). Some years after dates the promulgation of a Statute of the College of Medicine by the Council of the Elders in 1481.

In 1569, by a decree of the Senate of Republic of Genoa, the Colleges were incorporated into the schools run by the Jesuits. The Jesuits settled near the old Church of San Girolamo Del Rosso, and enlarged their premises by buying some land on which to house their College and schools. The building, which is now the main university premises, was designed by the architect Bartolomeo Bianco, and began to be used in 1640.

After the suppression of the Society of Jesus in 1773, a special committee reorganized the various courses of study, dividing them in higher education (Canon Law, Philosophy, Civil Law, Theology, Logic and Metaphysics, Physics) and primary education (courses in Rhetoric, Reading and Writing).

After the establishment of the French Empire, which absorbed the Republic of Genoa, higher education was subdivided into different special schools: Law, Medicine, Physical and Mathematical Sciences, Commerce, Language and Literature, Chemistry. The University of Genoa was affiliated to the Imperial University of Paris. It was reinstated as a separate university in 1812.

After the fall of Napoleon, the provisional Government of the Republic appointed a new Committee in charge of higher education, and at the Congress of Vienna in 1815, it was decided that the University of Genoa be entrusted to the Kingdom of Sardinia, enjoying the same privileges as those granted to the University of Turin. The university was closed owing to political disturbances between 1821 and 1823 and again between 1830 and 1835.

In 1870, two first technical institutes of higher education were established: the Royal Naval School and the Royal School of Economic Studies, that in 1936, were absorbed by the Royal University of Genoa, becoming the Faculties of Engineering and Economics respectively.

In the late 20th century, the university expanded rapidly, with new regional campuses. In 1996, some departments were established in Savona within a remodeled Army Barrack area. That campus hosts the Department of Engineering and also courses in Business. New laboratories have been made in Simulation, Logistics &amp; Industrial Engineering, among others.

<doc id="456122" wikidata="Q6141187" url="?curid=456122" title="USS Snook (SS-279)">
<text>USS &quot;Snook&quot; (SS-279), a &quot;Gato&quot;-class submarine, was the first ship of the United States Navy to be named for the common snook, an Atlantic marine fish that is bluish-gray above and silvery below a black lateral line.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Snook&quot;″s keel was laid down by the Portsmouth Navy Yard in Kittery, Maine, on 17 April 1942. She was launched on 15 August 1942, sponsored by Mrs. Audrey Emanuel Dempsey, wife of Lieutenant James C. Dempsey, who had been awarded the Navy Cross for heroism as commanding officer of the submarine . &quot;Snook&quot; was commissioned on 24 October 1942.

==Patrols==

===First patrol===
After shakedown training off the New England coast, &quot;Snook&quot; departed New London on 3 March 1943 and set sail for the Pacific. Following a 12-day stopover at Pearl Harbor, the submarine put to sea on 11 April and headed for the Yellow Sea and East China Sea for her first war patrol. Upon completion of mine planting in the Shanghai area, &quot;Snook&quot; continued on up the coast of China to the Yellow Sea. On the afternoon of 5 May, she sighted two freighters standing out of Dairen and took up the chase. She trailed both until after nightfall, then fired a spread of three torpedoes that quickly sank &quot;Kinko Maru&quot;. The lead freighter continued, unaware of the attack, until someone on the sinking ship sounded a whistle. At that point, the freighter began a series of frantic maneuvers to dodge two of &quot;Snook&quot;″s torpedoes, then opened fire with her guns, forcing the submarine to withdraw out of range, returning shortly after and firing three torpedoes, one of which hit &quot;Daifuku Maru&quot; amidships and sank her. &quot;Snook&quot; then resumed patrol.

Early on the morning of 7 May, &quot;Snook&quot; began quickly closing in on a convoy. Upon overtaking the enemy cargo ships, she launched four torpedoes, followed by three others five minutes later. The 4,363-ton cargo ship &quot;Hosei Maru&quot; was destroyed and several other ships possibly damaged. After destroying two armed trawlers in actions on 13 May and 16 May, &quot;Snook&quot; terminated her first patrol at Midway Island on 23 May.

===Second patrol===
&quot;Snook&quot; set sail from Midway Island for her second war patrol on 9 June and headed for the waters off the Ryukyu Islands. In the morning twilight of 24 June, the submarine closed on a six-ship convoy escorted by two destroyers, launched two torpedoes at a large tanker, and heard two hits as she went deep and rigged for silent running to avoid the patrolling escorts. Coming back up to periscope depth, she found a destroyer guarding the crippled ship and was prevented from a second try by overhead aircraft.

Shortly before midnight on 3 July &quot;Snook&quot; made radar contact with another enemy convoy. Early the following morning, she fired a spread of six torpedoes, sinking cargo ships &quot;Koki Maru&quot; and &quot;Liverpool Maru&quot; and severely damaging &quot;Atlantic Maru&quot;. &quot;Snook&quot; returned to Pearl Harbor from her second patrol on 18 July.

===Third patrol===
&quot;Snook&quot; left Pearl Harbor for her third war patrol on 18 August and arrived off Marcus Island on 30 August to take reconnaissance photographs and stand lifeguard duty for the carrier air strikes of 1 September. Following the air strikes, the submarine resumed patrol and headed for the East China Sea where, in the early morning darkness of 13 September, she torpedoed and sank the 9,650-ton transport &quot;Yamato Maru&quot;. On 22 September, &quot;Snook&quot; intercepted and sank 715-ton Japanese cargo ship &quot;Katsurahama Maru&quot; departing from Dairen. On 29 September, the submarine conducted a surface attack on a 500 ton vessel. The vessel was damaged and as the submarine moved closer to finish it off, returned fire was received. Four of the submarine&#x27;s crew members were injured. The submarine turned away at high speed and the vessel was last seen settling in the water. The submarine terminated her third patrol at Pearl Harbor on 8 October.

===Fourth patrol===
&quot;Snook&quot; spent her fourth war patrol in a coordinated attack group with sister ships and in the waters off the Mariana Islands. On 29 November, the submarine sank the passenger-cargo ship with four torpedo hits, and the cargo ship &quot;Shiganoura Maru&quot;, as well as damaging an escort ship. &quot;Snook&quot; returned to Midway Island on 7 December and was routed on to Pearl Harbor.

===Fifth patrol===
On 6 January 1944, &quot;Snook&quot; cleared Pearl Harbor and headed for the western coast of Kyūshū and her fifth war patrol. While off the Bonin Islands on 23 January, the submarine torpedoed and sank the 3,120-ton converted gunboat &quot;Magane Maru&quot;. On 8 February, she attacked a 13-ship convoy, firing a spread of four torpedoes for three hits before diving to evade the escort ships. In this action, she sank the troopship &quot;Lima Maru&quot;, with the massive loss of life of 2,765 dead,(the 11th worst loss of life by ship sunk by a submarine in history), and heavily damaged the freighter &quot;Shiranesan Maru&quot;. On 14 February, she quickly sank freighter &quot;Nittoku Maru&quot;, with one torpedo hit amidships and, on the following day, sank cargo ship &quot;Hoshi Maru Number Two&quot;. On 23 February, while returning to Midway Island, she spotted an enemy convoy eight miles away, made a daring approach through a screen of 11 enemy escort ships, and fired five torpedoes, with two hits which sank the passenger-cargo ship, &quot;Koyo Maru&quot;. The submarine terminated her fifth patrol at Pearl Harbor on 6 March and continued to Hunters Point Navy Yard for a major overhaul.

===Sixth patrol===
On her sixth patrol &quot;Snook&quot; attacked and missed two freighters on 12 July, but found no other worthwhile targets, and returned to Midway Island on 14 August.

===Seventh patrol===
&quot;Snook&quot;″s seventh war patrol was conducted in Luzon Strait and the South China Sea. After stopping at Saipan for repairs from 25 September to 4 October the submarine continued her patrol and contacted an enemy convoy on 23 October. She sank passenger-cargo ship &quot;Shinsei Maru Number 1&quot;, then evaded two escorts and resumed the chase, sinking the tanker &quot;Kikusui Maru&quot; with a torpedo which disintegrated the entire aft end. After again escaping the escorts, &quot;Snook&quot; returned and fired five bow torpedoes, sinking cargo ship, or &quot;hell ship&quot;, , killing about 1,773 American prisoners of war (the 23rd worst loss of life by ship sunk by a submarine in history), one of the greatest losses of life in American maritime history. After rescuing a downed airman on 3 November, the submarine returned to Pearl Harbor on 18 November.

===Eighth patrol===
&quot;Snook&quot;″s eighth war patrol was conducted off the Kuril Islands from 25 December 1944 to 17 February 1945. Her only sightings during this patrol were two friendly Soviet vessels and a momentary contact with a small patrol craft.

===Final patrol===
&quot;Snook&quot; was lost while conducting her ninth war patrol, in the South China Sea and Luzon Strait. On 8 April, she reported her position to submarine and when she did not acknowledge messages sent from &quot;Tigrone&quot; the next day, it was presumed that she had headed toward Luzon Strait. On 12 April, she was ordered to take lifeguard station in the vicinity of Sakishima Gunto in support of British carrier air strikes. On 20 April, the commander of the British carrier task force reported that he had a plane down in &quot;Snook&quot;″s assigned area, and that he could not contact the submarine by radio. &quot;Snook&quot; was ordered to search the area and to acknowledge the order. When she failed to make a transmission, submarine was sent to make the search and rendezvous with &quot;Snook&quot;. Although &quot;Bang&quot; arrived and rescued the downed aviators, she saw no sign of the missing submarine; on 16 May, &quot;Snook&quot; was presumed lost due to unknown causes. It is believed that she was sunk by kaibokans , &quot;CD-8, CD-32&quot; and &quot;CD-52&quot;. It has also been suggested that &quot;Snook&quot; may have been lost in combat with one of five Japanese submarines which were also lost in April–May 1945. One candidate is the Japanese Type B3 submarine , however it remains a hypothesis due to it not being confirmed by a single Japanese source.

&quot;Snook&quot; was credited with sinking 17 enemy vessels in her two and one-half years of active service. She earned seven battle stars for World War II service.

===Possible discovery===
The actual whereabouts of &quot;Snook&quot; may have been discovered during a deep-sea dive in 1995. The possibility exists that a U.S. submarine lies in about of water off the coast of Iriomote Island, the far southwest island in the Okinawa chain. During operations with an Okinawan company using a U.S. made &quot;SCORPIO&quot; ROV in 1995, a group of divers encountered a sonar contact with what appeared to be a metal structure, about in girth and about in length (exposed) at roughly an angle of 20-30 degrees. The SONAR image of a large unexpected obstruction to the operations prompted the divers to command evasive maneuvers and avoid the area for the safety of the ROV.

The divers, thinking they would have another opportunity to work in the area at a later date, left the area and never returned to that site. Their ROV was lost in 1997 off Yonaguni Island, the last island belonging to the Okinawa chain off the east coast of Taiwan. They were fairly certain that the object was a submarine, and quite possibly the &quot;Snook&quot;. No further dives in the area were ever attempted.

<text>German submarine &quot;U-2513&quot; was a Type XXI U-boat of Nazi Germany&#x27;s &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot;, that was operated by the United States Navy for several years after World War II.

==Design==
Like all Type XXI U-boats, &quot;U-2513&quot; had a displacement of when at the surface and while submerged. She had a total length of (o/a), a beam of , and a draught of . The submarine was powered by two MAN SE supercharged six-cylinder M6V40/46KBB diesel engines each providing , two Siemens-Schuckert GU365/30 double-acting electric motors each providing , and two Siemens-Schuckert silent running GV232/28 electric motors each providing .

The submarine had a maximum surface speed of and a submerged speed of . When running on silent motors the boat could operate at a speed of . When submerged, the boat could operate at for ; when surfaced, she could travel at . &quot;U-2513&quot; was fitted with six torpedo tubes in the bow and four C/30 anti-aircraft guns. She could carry twenty-three torpedoes or seventeen torpedoes and twelve mines. The complement was five officers and fifty-two men.

==Service history==

===&quot;Kriegsmarine&quot;===
Her keel was laid down on 19 July 1944 by Blohm &amp; Voss of Hamburg. She was commissioned on 12 October 1944 with &quot;Kapitänleutnant&quot; Hans Bungards in command. Bungards was relieved on 27 April 1945 by &quot;Fregattenkapitän&quot; Erich Topp, who commanded the boat for less than two weeks.

&quot;U-2513&quot; conducted no war patrols. On 9 May 1945, Topp surrendered his command at Horten Naval Base, Norway. &quot;U-2513&quot; was taken to Oslo on 18 May, then to Lishally, Northern Ireland, which she reached on 9 June. In August 1945, the U-boat was transferred to the United States.

===United States Navy===
A year later, August 1946, &quot;U-2513&quot; began an extensive overhaul in Charleston, South Carolina, which was completed late in September. On 24 September, she departed Charleston and headed for Key West, Florida. The following day, she began six months of duty which included both evaluation tests of the U-boat&#x27;s design and duty in conjunction with the development of submarine and antisubmarine tactics. The Greater Underwater Propulsion Power Program (GUPPY) would be initiated because of the results of these tests.

On 21 November 1946 President Harry S. Truman became the second American President (after Theodore Roosevelt) to travel on a submarine when he visited &quot;U-2513&quot;. The sub went below the surface with the President on board, and a demonstration was made to him of the German schnorchel (a specialized submarine snorkel).

On 15 March 1947, &quot;U-2513&quot; headed north from Key West, Florida, bound for the New England coast, and arrived at Portsmouth, New Hampshire, on 22 March. She remained there until 8 September when she began six weeks of operations from Portsmouth and New London, Connecticut, under the auspices of the Commander, Submarines, Atlantic Fleet. She concluded that duty on 15 October and departed New London to return to Key West. &quot;U-2513&quot; resumed her old duties at Key West five days later and continued them until the summer of 1949.

In mid-June 1949, the submarine moved from Key West north via Norfolk, Virginia, to Portsmouth, New Hampshire, where she was placed out of service in July 1949. She remained at Portsmouth until August 1951 at which time she returned to Key West. On 2 September 1951, the Chief of Naval Operations ordered that the boat be sunk by gunfire. &quot;U-2513&quot; was sunk west of Key West, Florida during rocket tests by the destroyer on 7 October 1951.

The final resting place of &quot;U-2513&quot; is about northwest of the Dry Tortugas, west of Key West) in about of water at . She is reachable only by divers experienced in decompression diving at that depth. The site is rarely dived on due to its depth and remote location.

<text>Idar-Oberstein () is a town in the Birkenfeld district in Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany. As a &quot;Große kreisangehörige Stadt&quot; (large city belonging to a district), it assumes some of the responsibilities that for smaller municipalities in the district are assumed by the district administration. Today&#x27;s town of Idar-Oberstein is the product of two rounds of administrative reform, one in 1933 and the other in 1969, which saw many municipalities amalgamated into one. The various &quot;Stadtteile&quot; have, however, retained their original identities, which, aside from the somewhat more urban character encountered in Idar and Oberstein, tend to hark back to each centre&#x27;s history as a rural village. Idar-Oberstein is known as a gemstone town, and also as a garrison town. It is also the largest town in the Hunsrück.

==Geography==
The town lies on the southern edge of the Hunsrück on both sides of the river Nahe.

===Constituent communities===
The following are the divisions within the town of Idar-Oberstein as of 31 December 2015:

====Centres merged in 1933 administrative reform====
* Oberstein (7,834 inhabitants)
* Idar (7,897 inhabitants)
* Tiefenstein (2,489 inhabitants)
* Algenrodt (1,846 inhabitants)
Total population: 20,066

====Centres merged in 1969 administrative reform====
* Göttschied (2,928 inhabitants)
* Weierbach (2,536 inhabitants; area 751.6 ha)
* Nahbollenbach (1,899 inhabitants; area 821.7 ha)
* Mittelbollenbach (1,060 inhabitants; area 360.9 ha)
* Kirchenbollenbach (787 inhabitants; area 227.5 ha)
* Regulshausen (874 inhabitants)
* Enzweiler (686 inhabitants)
* Georg-Weierbach (661 inhabitants)
* Hammerstein (504 inhabitants; area 217.5 ha)
Total population: 11,935

===Climate===
Yearly precipitation in Idar-Oberstein amounts to 774 mm, falling into the middle third of the precipitation chart for all Germany. At 57% of the German Weather Service&#x27;s weather stations, lower figures are recorded. The driest month is April. The most rainfall comes in December. In that month, precipitation is 1.6 times what it is in April. Precipitation hardly varies at all and is evenly spread throughout the year. At only 13% of the weather stations are lower seasonal swings recorded.

==History==

The territorial history of Idar-Oberstein&#x27;s individual centres is marked by a considerable splintering of lordly domains in the local area. Only in Napoleonic times, beginning in 1794, with its reorganization and merging of various territorial units, was some order brought to the traditional mishmash of local lordships. However, shortly thereafter, the Congress of Vienna brought the future town division once again, as the river Nahe became a border, and the centres on its north bank were thereby grouped into the Principality of Birkenfeld, an exclave of the Grand Duchy of Oldenburg, most of whose territory was in what is now northwest Germany, with a coastline on the North Sea.

The towns of Idar and Oberstein belonged to the Barons of Daun-Oberstein (who later became the Counts of Falkenstein) until 1670. In 1865, both Idar and Oberstein were granted town rights, and finally in 1933, they were forcibly united (along with the municipalities of Algenrodt and Tiefenstein) by the Nazis to form the modern town of Idar-Oberstein.

===History up to French reorganization beginning in 1794===
The constituent community of Oberstein grew out of the Imperially immediate Lordship of Oberstein. The &quot;Herren vom Stein&quot; (“Lords of the Stone”) had their first documentary mention in 1075. Their seat was at Castle Bosselstein, now known as the &quot;Altes Schloss&quot; (“Old Palatial Castle”), above the cliff where the &quot;Felsenkirche&quot; (“Rock Church”) - itself mentioned as early as the 12th century - would later be built. The core of the area over which the lordship held sway was framed by the rivers Nahe, Idarbach, Göttenbach and Ringelbach. After 1323, the Lords of the Stone styled themselves “von Daun-Oberstein”, and managed to considerably expand their domain even into lands south of the Nahe and into the Idarbann. As the lordly seat with its castle and fortifications – remnants of the old town wall built about 1410 can still be seen – Oberstein developed the characteristics of a town, however without ever earning the legal status of a market town (&quot;Flecken&quot;). In 1682, the Counts of Leiningen-Heidesheim, and in 1766 the Counts of Limburg-Styrum, became the owners of the Lordship of Oberstein, which largely shrank back to the above-mentioned lordly core after the Idarbann was ceded to the “Hinder” County of Sponheim in 1771. In 1776, the Margraves of Baden became the owners of the Lordship after the “Hinder” County of Sponheim was partitioned.

It is known from archaeological finds that human settlement in what is now Idar goes back to the very earliest times. The constituent community of Idar on the Nahe&#x27;s right bank belonged, as did the villages of Enzweiler, Algenrodt, Mackenrodt, Hettenrodt, Hettstein, Obertiefenbach and Kirschweiler, to the Idarbann. This area belonged mostly to the Lords of Oberstein, and it therefore shares a history with Oberstein; however, in some centres, notably Tiefenbach and Kirschweiler, some estates and rights were held by other lords, such as the Waldgraves and Rhinegraves and Tholey Abbey.

The constituent community of Tiefenstein arose from the merger of the villages of Tiefenbach and Hettstein in 1909. This Idarbann community&#x27;s territorial history is the same as Idar&#x27;s and Oberstein&#x27;s. Tiefenbach was mentioned as an estate in a 1283 document; a further documentary mention from 1051 cannot be related to the village with any certainty. Hettstein was mentioned as &quot;Henzestein&quot; or &quot;Hezerten&quot; in 1321 and had among its inhabitants Waldgravial subjects.

The village of Algenrodt had its first certain documentary mention as &quot;Alekenrod&quot; in a 1321 Oberstein enfeoffment document. In 1324, the Lords of Oberstein pledged it to the Waldgraves and Rhinegraves of Kyrburg. But for this, Algenrodt shares a history with the other Idarbann communities.

Enzweiler boasts traces of human habitation going back to Roman times. In 1276, Tholey Abbey owned a mill near Enzweiler. The village itself might have arisen in the 14th century, and it was always part of the Idarbann.

The village of Georg-Weierbach north of the Nahe, built in a way resembling terraces on land that falls steeply towards the river, likely goes back to the foundation of a church by Archbishop of Mainz Hatto II in the 10th century. In the 11th century, the village was mentioned in connection with the Lords of Wirebach (that is, Weierbach). In 1327, the village, which was for a short time held by the Lords of Randeck, was largely sold off to the Waldgraves and Rhinegraves and grouped into the &quot;Amt&quot; of Kyrburg. The form “Georg-Weierbach” stems from the church&#x27;s patron saint.

Göttschied, which had its first documentary mention in 1271, belonged together with Regulshausen, Gerach and Hintertiefenbach to Mettlach Abbey. These four villages were therefore known as the &quot;Abteidörfer&quot; (“abbey villages”), and in 1561, they were sold to the “Hinder” County of Sponheim.

Hamerzwiller (nowadays called Hammerstein) was mentioned in 1438 in a taxation book kept by the County of Sponheim, and had been held by the “Hinder” County of Sponheim as early as 1269, when that county enfeoffed the Counts of Schwarzenberg with it.

Regarded as the origin of the village of Kirchenbollenbach is the foundation of a church by Archbishop of Mainz Willigis sometime after 975. The earliest documentary evidence of the village goes back to 1128 when it was called &quot;Bolinbach&quot;. It is first known to have been a fief held by the Lords of Schwarzenberg from the Counts of Zweibrücken, whereafter it passed in 1595 to the Waldgraves and Rhinegraves of Kirn. One local peculiarity here was that a Catholic sideline of the otherwise mainly Protestant Rhinegraves ended up holding sway in Kirchenbollenbach, and under Prince Johann Dominik of Salm-Kyrburg, this line not only founded a new Catholic parish but also introduced a simultaneum at the local church.

The foundation stone of today&#x27;s village of Mittelbollenbach is said to be the estate of Bollenbach, which was mentioned in 1283 as a holding of the Lords of Oberstein in the area of the Winterhauch woodland. In 1432, the Dukes of Lorraine were enfeoffed with Nahbollenbach and Mittelbollenbach, which in the wake of the death of the last Lord of Oberstein led to bitter arguments over the complicated inheritance arrangements. Only in 1778 did Lorraine finally relinquish its claims in Electoral Trier&#x27;s favour.

Until 1667, Nahbollenbach and Mittelbollenbach shared the same history. Then, Nahbollenbach was acknowledged by Lorraine as an allodial holding of Oberstein, although beginning in 1682 it was an Electoral-Trier fief held by Oberstein.

The “abbey village” of Regulshausen belonged to Mettlach Abbey, who sold it in 1561 to the “Hinder” County of Sponheim. The oldest documentary mention comes from 1491.

The village of Weierbach – not to be confused with Georg-Weierbach mentioned above – had its first documentary mention in 1232 as &quot;Weygherbach&quot;, and belonged to the &quot;Amt&quot; of Naumburg in the “Further” County of Sponheim, which itself was later held by the Margraves of Baden, which gave the village its onetime alternative name, Baden-Weierbach. The oft-used other alternative name, Martin-Weierbach, stems from the church&#x27;s patron saint.

===French, Oldenburg and Prussian times===
After the French dissolved all the old lordships, they introduced a sweeping reorganization of territorial (and social) structure beginning in 1794. The whole area belonged to the arrondissement of Birkenfeld in the Department of Sarre. Until 1814, this was French territory. The introduction of the &quot;Code civil des Français&quot;, justice reform and, foremost, the abolition of the noble and clerical classes with the attendant end to compulsory labour and other duties formerly owed the now powerless lords quickly made French rule popular. However, there was quite a heavy tax burden imposed by the new rulers, and there was also continuing conscription of men into the French army. Both of these things weighed heavily on France&#x27;s Rhineland citizens.

After Napoleonic rule ended, the area was restructured. On the grounds of Article 25 of the concluding acts of the Congress of Vienna, the northern part of the Department of Sarre was at first given to the Kingdom of Prussia in June 1815.

Since Prussia was obliged under the terms of the 1815 Treaty of Paris to cede an area out of this parcel containing 69,000 inhabitants to other powers – 20,000 souls each to Saxe-Coburg and Gotha and the Duke of Oldenburg, along with smaller cessions to smaller princes – and since this had also been reconfirmed in Article 49 of the concluding acts of the Congress of Vienna, the region underwent further territorial division.

The villages south of the Nahe – Hammerstein, Kirchenbollenbach, Mittelbollenbach, Nahbollenbach and Martin-Weierbach – were therefore transferred in 1816 to the Principality of Lichtenberg, held by the Dukes of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. The Dukes were not satisfied with this territorial gain, and for their part, the people in the territory were not satisfied with their new rulers. In 1834, the area was sold for two million &quot;Thaler&quot; to Prussia and made into the Sankt Wendel district. Later, after the First World War, the Treaty of Versailles stipulated, among other things, that 26 of the Sankt Wendel district&#x27;s 94 municipalities had to be ceded to the British- and French-occupied Saar. The remaining 68 municipalities then bore the designation “Restkreis St. Wendel-Baumholder”, with the first syllable of &quot;Restkreis&quot; having the same meaning as in English, in the sense of “left over”. The Prussians were themselves not well liked leaders, as they sometimes imposed their order with military might. They were known, and hated, for, among other things, putting a protest rally of the Hambach Festival in Sankt Wendel in May 1832, complete with a liberty pole in the Napoleonic tradition, to an end using military force, after Coburg had called on Prussia for help in the matter.

Idar, Oberstein, Tiefenstein, Algenrodt, Enzweiler, Georg-Weierbach, Göttschied, Enzweiler and Regulshausen became on 16 April 1817 part of the newly created Principality of Birkenfeld. They also became the &quot;Amt&quot; of Oberstein, which comprised the &quot;Bürgermeistereien&quot; (“Mayoralties”) of Herrstein, Oberstein and Fischbach. French law was allowed to stand. The Duke did, however, issue a &quot;Staatsgrundgesetz&quot; (“Basic State Law”) with which the people were not in agreement, because they would rather have stayed with Prussia. This continued work on the patchwork quilt of little states covering Germany was judged very critically in Idar and Oberstein, whereas Birkenfeld, which had as a result of the new political arrangement been raised to residence town, found little to complain about. The jewellery industry there, which even by this time had become national, perhaps international in scope, and indeed the jewel dealers themselves, who now found themselves living in a little provincially oriented town, perceived the new arrangement, though, as a backward step, particularly so after the years that France had ruled. It had had its worldly metropolis of Paris with its good business. The dealers, therefore, tried energetically, but without success, to have their land reannexed to Prussia. On the other hand, the Oldenburgers quickly managed to make themselves popular among the people by installing an unselfish government that established an independent judiciary and introducing various programmes that favoured farmers and the economy. A well regulated school system – in 1830, a public school was built in Oberstein – and the temporary suspension of military conscription only helped to support this positive picture. Roads were expanded and a postal coach service (for persons, bulk mailings and bulky goods) was set up. A further economic upswing was brought by the building of the Nahe Valley Railway, especially when the stretch from Bad Kreuznach to Oberstein opened on 15 December 1859.

===Since the First World War===
When the First World War ended, Grand Duke Friedrich August of Oldenburg abdicated, whereupon the &quot;Landesteil&quot; (literally “country part”) of Birkenfeld in the Free State of Oldenburg arose from the old principality. This &quot;Landesteil&quot;, along with the whole Rhineland, was occupied by the French on 4 December 1918. They did not withdraw until 30 June 1930.

At the Oldenburg &quot;Landtag&quot; elections in 1931, the NSDAP received more than 37% of the votes cast, but could not form the government. After the Nazis had first given up a declaration of tolerance for the existing government, they were then soon demanding that the &quot;Landtag&quot; be dissolved. Since this was not forthcoming, the Nazis filed suit for a referendum, and they got their way. This resulted in dissolution on 17 April 1932. In the ensuing new elections on 20 May, the Nazis won 48.38% of the popular vote, and thereby took 24 of the 46 seats in the &quot;Landtag&quot;, which gave them an absolute majority. In Idar, which was then still a self-governing town, the National Socialists received more than 70% of the votes cast. They could thereby already govern, at least in Oldenburg, with endorsement by the German National People&#x27;s Party, which had two seats at its disposal, even before Adolf Hitler’s official seizure of power in 1933. One of the new government’s first initiatives was administrative reform for Oldenburg, which was followed on 27 April 1933 by the similar &quot;Gesetz zur Vereinfachung und Verbilligung der Verwaltung&quot; (“Law for simplifying administration and reducing its cost”) for the &quot;Landesteil&quot; of Birkenfeld. Through this new law, 18 formerly self-administering municipalities were amalgamated; this included the self-administering towns (having been granted town rights in 1865) of Idar and Oberstein, which were amalgamated with each other and also with the municipalities of Algenrodt and Tiefenstein to form the new town of Idar-Oberstein. The law foreshadowed what was to come: It would be applied within a few weeks, without further discussion or participation, to the exclusion of the public and against the will of municipalities, who had not even been asked whether they wanted it, to places such as Herrstein and Oberwörresbach, Rötsweiler and Nockenthal, or Hoppstädten and Weiersbach. The restructuring also afforded the Nazis an opportunity to get rid of some “undesirables”; under &quot;Kreisleiter&quot; (district leader) Wild from Idar, all significant public positions were held until Hitler&#x27;s downfall by Nazis.

In 1937, on the basis of the Greater Hamburg Act, the &quot;Landesteil&quot; of Birkenfeld was dissolved and transferred together with the “Restkreis St. Wendel-Baumholder” to the Prussian district of Birkenfeld, a deed which put all of what are today Idar-Oberstein&#x27;s constituent communities in the same district.

After the Second World War, along with the whole district, the town&#x27;s whole municipal area passed to the then newly founded state of Rhineland-Palatinate.

On 1 April 1960, the town of Idar-Oberstein was declared a &quot;Große kreisangehörige Stadt&quot; (large town belonging to a district) by the state government, after the town itself had applied for the status.

===Amalgamations===
In the course of administrative restructuring in Rhineland-Palatinate, nine surrounding municipalities were amalgamated with Idar-Oberstein. On 7 June 1969, the municipalities of Enzweiler, Göttschied, Hammerstein and Regulshausen were amalgamated, and on 7 November 1970 they were followed by Georg-Weierbach, Kirchenbollenbach, Mittelbollenbach, Nahbollenbach and Weierbach.

Before the administrative restructuring, there were extensive, sometimes behind-closed-doors talks by the then mayor of Idar-Oberstein, Dr. Wittmann, with offers of negotiation to all together 22 municipalities in the surrounding area. One of the reasons for this was a tendency that had been noted for people from Idar-Oberstein to move out of town to the surrounding municipalities, which were opening up extensive new building areas – among others Göttschied, Rötsweiler-Nockenthal and Kirschweiler – whereas within the town itself, given the problematic lie of the land, there were hardly any. The same problem saw to it that there was a dearth of land for industrial location. Surprising was the desire expressed by Weierbach, which came without one of Idar-Oberstein&#x27;s initiatives, to join the new greater town, for at the time, Weierbach did not even border on the town, and Weierbach itself was then foreseen as the future nucleus of its own greater municipality, or perhaps even town, together with the municipalities of Fischbach, Georg-Weierbach and Bollenbach, which would have been amalgamated with this municipality had the original plan come about.

With the exception of Georg-Weierbach, the proposal to amalgamate these villages with the town of Idar-Oberstein had notable majorities, either in the villages themselves or on their councils, in favour of dissolving their respective municipalities and then merging with the town. Nevertheless, bitter discussions and even administrative legal disputes arose in the former &quot;Amt&quot; of Weierbach, which was now bereft of its core municipalities. In April 1970, the &quot;Amt&quot; of Weierbach lodged a constitutional grievance with the &quot;Verfassungsgerichtshof Rheinland-Pfalz&quot; (Rhineland-Palatinate Constitutional Court), which ruled on 8 July 1970 that the state law for administrative simplification in Rhineland-Palatinate was in parts unconstitutional. The right to self-administration of the &quot;Amt&quot; of Weierbach, it furthermore ruled, was being infringed, and the municipal league&#x27;s vitality was being jeopardized. Thus, Weierbach, Georg-Weierbach, Nahbollenbach, Mittelbollenbach and Kirchenbollenbach were, with immediate effect, demerged from the town and reinstated as self-administering municipalities. After bitter arguments between the town of Idar-Oberstein together with the amalgamation supporters on the one side and the &quot;Amt&quot; of Weierbach together with the amalgamation opponents on the other, who promoted their views in demonstrations, at gatherings and in letter duels in newspaper correspondence pages, a poll was taken in early September 1970 with a vote in the &quot;Amt&quot; of Weierbach. The results favoured the state of affairs that had existed before the constitutional court&#x27;s ruling with almost 80% of the vote in favour of amalgamation, whereas the remaining municipalities in the &quot;Amt&quot; of Weierbach, namely Sien, Sienhachenbach, Schmidthachenbach, Fischbach, Zaubach (a village that vanished in the late 20th century) and Dickesbach, returned a vote of roughly 95% in favour of keeping the &quot;Amt&quot; of Weierbach.

With this expansion of the town, the centres of gravity in the Birkenfeld district had been shifted considerably. Idar-Oberstein could further grow as a middle centre: the educational facilities were expanded (Realschule, Heinzenwies-Gymnasium), new building developments could be opened up (especially in Göttschied, Regulshausen and Weierbach), land was available for a new hospital building and there was room, too, for industrial and commercial operations to locate.

Since Idar-Oberstein had not only a good general infrastructure but also, after the Steinbach Reservoir was brought into service, a more than adequate water supply, the option of amalgamating themselves with the town became attractive to many further municipalities. On the initiative of Mayor Wittmann, who had a survey done by an Osnabrück planning bureau on the town&#x27;s relationship with 25 other neighbouring municipalities, town council decided to promote the “unconditional amalgamation” of the municipalities of Fischbach, Dickesbach, Zaubach, Mittelreidenbach, Oberreidenbach, Schmidthachenbach, Sienhachenbach, Sien, Hintertiefenbach and Vollmersbach. The municipalities of Rötsweiler-Nockenthal, Siesbach, Gerach, Veitsrodt, Kirschweiler, Hettenrodt and Mackenrodt were each to receive an offer of amalgamation. The district administration in Birkenfeld then got involved, and it was decided by the district assembly (&quot;Kreistag&quot;) that Idar-Oberstein&#x27;s amalgamation policy, which was deemed to be reckless, should be censured. Since a certain disenchantment with all these amalgamations had meanwhile set in both in the outlying centres and in the town of Idar-Oberstein itself, all further initiatives either got nowhere or were shelved.

===Schinderhannes===
Idar-Oberstein has its connections with the notorious outlaw Johannes Bückler (1777–1803), commonly known as Schinderhannes. His parents lived in Idar around 1790, and Oberstein was the scene of one of his earliest misdeeds in 1796. He spent a whole Louis d&#x27;or on drinks at an inn. He had stolen it from an innkeeper named Koch from Veitsrodt who had meant to use it to buy brandy.

Schinderhannes&#x27;s sweetheart, Juliana Blasius (1781–1851), known as “Julchen”, came from Idar-Oberstein&#x27;s outlying centre of Weierbach. She spent her childhood with her father and elder sister Margarethe as a “bench singer” and a fiddler at markets and church fêtes. At Easter 1800, Schinderhannes saw “Julchen” for the first time at the Wickenhof, a now vanished hamlet near Kirn, where the 19-year-old danced. Their relationship yielded a daughter and a son, Franz Wilhelm. After Schinderhannes was beheaded for his crimes in 1803, Juliana married first a gendarme, with whom she had seven children, and then after his death a livestock herder and day labourer.

===The legend of the &quot;Felsenkirche&quot; (“Crag Church”)===

According to legend, there were two noble brothers, Wyrich and Emich, who both fell in love with a beautiful girl named Bertha. The brothers lived at Castle Bosselstein, which stood atop a 135 m-high hill. Bertha was from a noble line that occupied the nearby Lichtenburg Castle.

Neither brother was aware of the other&#x27;s feelings for Bertha. When Wyrich, the elder brother, was away on some unknown business, Emich succeeded in securing Bertha&#x27;s affections and, subsequently, married her. When Emich announced the news to his brother, Wyrich&#x27;s temper got the better of him. In the heat of the moment, he hurled his brother out of a window of the castle and sent him to his death on the rocks below.

Wyrich was almost immediately filled with remorse. With the counsel of a local abbot, he began a long period of penance. At this time, Bertha disappears from the historical record. Many romantics feel that she died of a broken heart.

As Wyrich waited for a heavenly sign showing that he was forgiven, the abbot suggested that he build a church on the exact place where his brother died. Wyrich worked and prayed himself into exhaustion. However, the moment the church was completed, he received his sign: a miraculous spring opened up in the church.

Wyrich died soon after this. When the local bishop came to consecrate the new church, he found the noble lord dead on its steps. Wyrich was later placed in the same tomb with his brother.

===Emigration and gemstones===
Idar-Oberstein is known as a gemstone centre. Until the 18th century, the area was a source for agate and jasper. A combination of low-cost labour and energy helped the gemstone-working industry flourish. The river Nahe provided free water power for the cutting and polishing machines at the mills.

In the 18th century, though, gemstone finds in the Hunsrück were dwindling, making life harder for the local people. Many left to try their luck abroad. Some went as far as Brazil, where they found that gemstones could be recovered from open-pit mines or even found in rivers and streams. The locally common tradition of preparing meat over an open fire, churrasco, was also adopted by the newcomers and even found its way back to their homeland by way of gemstone shipping. Agate nodules were shipped back as ballast on empty vessels that had offloaded cargo in Brazil. The cheap agates were then transported to Idar-Oberstein.

In the early 19th century, many people were driven out of the local area by hunger and also went to South America. In 1827, emigrants from Idar-Oberstein discovered the world&#x27;s most important agate deposit in Brazil&#x27;s state of Rio Grande do Sul. As early as 1834, the first delivery of agate from Rio Grande do Sul had been made to Idar-Oberstein. The Brazilian agate exhibited very even layers, much more even than those seen in the local agates. This made them especially good for making engraved gems. Using locals’ technical knowledge of chemical dyes, the industry grew bigger than ever at the turn of the 20th century.

After the Second World War, the region had to redefine itself once more, and it developed into a leading hub in the trade of gemstones from Brazil and Africa. That in turn provided local artists with a large selection of material and the region experienced a “third boom” as a gemstone centre. More recently, however, competition from Thailand and India has hit the region hard.

==Politics==

===Town council===
The council is made up of 40 honorary council members, who were elected by proportional representation at the municipal election held on 25 May 2014, and the full-time mayor (&quot;Oberbürgermeister&quot;) as chairman.

The municipal election held on 25 May 2014 yielded the following results:
===Mayors===
Ever since the state government declared the town of Idar-Oberstein a &quot;Große kreisangehörige Stadt&quot; (large town belonging to a district) on 1 April 1960, the town&#x27;s mayor has borne the official title of &quot;Oberbürgermeister&quot;.

===Coat of arms===
The German blazon reads: &quot;Im halbrunden silbernen Schild befindet sich ein aufgerichteter roter Forsthaken, begleitet im rechten Obereck von einer sechsblättrigen roten Rose mit goldenem Kelch und grünen Kelchblättern, links unten von einer roten Eichel.&quot;

The town&#x27;s arms might in English heraldic language be described thus: Argent a cramp palewise sinister with a crossbar gules between in dexter chief a rose foiled of six of the second barbed and seeded proper and in sinister base an acorn slipped palewise of the second.

The charges are drawn from coats of arms formerly borne by both Idar and Oberstein before the two towns were merged in 1933. The current arms were approved by the Oldenburg Ministry of State for the Interior. The arms have been borne since 10 July 1934.

==Twin towns – sister cities==

===Mediaeval buildings===

====&quot;Felsenkirche&quot;====
The famous &quot;Felsenkirche&quot; (“Crag Church”) is the town&#x27;s defining landmark. It came to be through efforts by Wirich IV of Daun-Oberstein (about 1415–1501), who in 1482 built the now Protestant church on the foundations of the &quot;Burg im Loch&quot; (“Castle in the Hole”).

As far as is now known, this castle was the first defensive position held by the Lords of Stein and a refuge castle for the dwellers of the village down below that was built into the great cave in the crag, the “Upper Stone” (or in German, &quot;Oberer Stein&quot;) on the river Nahe. This, of course, explains the origin of the name “Oberstein”.

The “Castle in the Hole” was the only cave castle on the Upper Nahe. The &quot;Felsenkirche&quot; can nowadays be reached by visitors through a tunnel that was built in modern times.

====Castle Bosselstein====

Up above the small church, on a knoll (&quot;Bossel&quot;) stands Castle Bosselstein, or rather what is left of it. The whole complex was forsaken in 1600, and all that stands now is a tower stump and remnants of the castle wall. In the Middle Ages, it was a stronghold to be reckoned with, with its two crescent moats and its two baileys.

Somewhat farther up, not far from Castle Bosselstein, the third castle arose about 1325, the one now known as Schloss Oberstein. Until 1624, it was the residence of the Counts of Daun-Oberstein. In 1855 it burnt down. In the years 1926 to 1956, the castle was used as a youth hostel, and thereafter as an inn.

In 1961, part of the east wall fell in. The castle club, &quot;Schloss Oberstein e. V.&quot;, that was founded shortly thereafter, in 1963, has been worrying ever since about maintaining the acutely endangered building materials that make up this former four-tower complex. In 1998, the town of Idar-Oberstein became the castle&#x27;s owner. Today there is once again a small inn, the Wyrich-Stube, and there are also now a few rooms restored by the castle club, which can be hired for festive occasions or cultural events.

===&quot;St. Peter and Paul&quot;===
&quot;St. Peter und Paul&quot; is the Catholic in the constituent community of Idar. It was built in 1925 as a wooden church for the then town of Idar. Since the 17th century, the town&#x27;s Catholics had had to make do with ecclesiastical services from Oberstein. By 1951, the church had fallen into such disrepair that it was extensively converted and expanded with stone.

===Theatre===
Besides the Town Theatre in the constituent community of Oberstein, there is also a cabaret stage. With Schloss Oberstein as the backdrop, the &quot;Theatersommer Schloss Oberstein&quot; (“Schloss Oberstein Theatre Summer”) is held each year.

===Museums===

Since the early 1960s tourism has grown in importance for Idar-Oberstein. Today it boasts a number of modern facilities such as the Steinkaulenberg, a gemstone mine open to visitors, and the German Gemstone Museum, as well as several recreational resorts. 
Nationally known is the &quot;Deutsches Edelsteinmuseum&quot; (German Gemstone Museum) in the constituent community of Idar, which boasts many gemstone exhibits.

The &quot;Museum Idar-Oberstein&quot; in the constituent community of Oberstein right below the famous &quot;Felsenkirche&quot; devotes itself to the specialized theme of “minerals”, and accordingly shows not only local places where gems were discovered, but also worldwide discovery places. The Idar-Oberstein jewellery industry and gemstone processing, too, and especially the agate-cutting operation, are presented in an impressive way.

Insights into the production of Art Deco jewellery as it was done about the turn of the 20th century are offered by the &quot;Industriemuseum Jakob Bengel&quot; in the constituent community of Oberstein. It is open the year round.

At the Steinkaulenberg gemstone mines, the only gemstone mine in Europe open to visitors, and at the &quot;Historische Weiherschleife&quot; – a gemstone-grinding mill – one can learn a few things about gemstone processing and Idar-Oberstein&#x27;s history. Jasper is also featured there, for Idar-Oberstein is also an important centre for that semiprecious stone.

===Sport===
The town&#x27;s best known sport club is SC 07 Idar-Oberstein.

Idar-Oberstein has an indoor swimming pool and, since September 2005 an outdoor swimming pool fed by natural water. On the town&#x27;s outskirts, a Friends of Nature house has been established, offering cyclists, hikers and tourists meals and lodging. Also, in nearby Kirschweiler is a golf course.

The &quot;Schleiferweg&quot; (&quot;Schleifer&quot; is German for “grinder” or “polisher”, a reference to the town&#x27;s fame as a gem-processing centre; &quot;Weg&quot; simply means “way”) is a 22 km-long signposted hiking trail round Idar. The path leads around the constituent communities of Idar, Oberstein, Göttschied, Algenrodt and Tiefenstein. Especially for sophisticated hikers, the &quot;Schleiferweg&quot; offers a special hiking experience with a high section of path through thick forest. The trail leads by various tourist attractions, such as the &quot;Weiherschleife&quot;, the Steinkaulenberg, the Kammerwoog (lake) or even the &quot;Wäschertskaulen&quot; spit roast house. With the good links to the town transport network, the trail can be broken up into as many shorter stretches as the hiker chooses.

===Regular events===
* The New Year&#x27;s Gala Concert of the Symphonisches Blasorchester Obere Nahe e. V. (wind orchestra) has been seeing the town into the New Year culturally since 1991.
* The International Trade Fair for Gemstones, Gemstone Jewellery and Gemstone Objects is held yearly in September and October (&quot;see also below&quot;).
* The regional consumer fair, better known as &quot;Idar-Obersteiner Wirtschaftstage&quot;, was created by the &quot;Wirtschaftsjunioren Idar-Oberstein 2003&quot;, and is growing into a true success story. It was organized and staged from 2003 to 2005 by the &quot;Wirtschaftsjunioren&quot;.
* The &quot;Deutsche Edelsteinkönigin&quot; (“German Gemstone Queen”) is chosen every other year from the region of the &quot;Deutsche Edelsteinstraße&quot; (“German Gem Road”).
* The &quot;Spießbratenfest&quot; (“Spit Roast Festival”) has been held since 1967 each year from the Friday to Tuesday that includes the last Sunday in June. It is said to be the biggest folk festival on the Upper Nahe.
* The &quot;Kinderkulturtage&quot; (“Children’s Cultural Days”) have been being held for several years now as a successor festival to the &quot;Kinderliederfestival&quot; (“Children’s Song Festival”). There are 15 to 20 events for children, youth and those who are young at heart.
* Each year in early June, the &quot;Jazztage&quot; (“Jazz Days”) are held. Appearing here are regional and national jazz greats on several stages in the Idar pedestrian precinct.
* Diamond grinders, facet and surface grinders and agate grinders demonstrate the most varied working techniques within the framework of the &quot;Deutscher Edelsteinschleifer- und Goldschmiedemarkt&quot; (“German Gemstone Grinders’ and Goldsmiths’ Market”). Goldsmiths and jewellery designers allow a look at their creative work in Oberstein&#x27;s historic town centre below the &quot;Felsenkirche&quot;.
* The &quot;Kama Festival&quot; was held from 1991 to 2007 on the lands of the Kammerwoog Conservation Area at Whitsun. It was the biggest open-air festival in Idar-Oberstein. The last festival took place in much reduced form in 2008.

===Culinary specialities===

====&quot;Spießbraten&quot; (spit roast)====
A distinction is made between &quot;Idarer Spießbraten&quot; and &quot;Obersteiner Spießbraten&quot;. The former is a kind of &quot;Schwenkbraten&quot;, whereas the latter is a kind of rolled roast. &quot;Spießbraten&quot; is rooted fast among Idar-Oberstein&#x27;s and the surrounding region&#x27;s culinary and cultural customs.

When making the more often consumed &quot;Idarer Spießbraten&quot;, the meat – originally prime rib, today often also roast beef or pork neck – is laid the day before cooking in raw onions, salt and pepper. The onions are good to eat while cooking at the fire with a beer. Locals favour beechwood for the fire, to give the roast its traditional flavour.

The variations on the &quot;Spießbraten&quot; recipe are also the subject of the town&#x27;s slogan, which bears witness to a patronizing cosmopolitanism: &quot;Rossbeff fa die Idarer, Kamm fa die Uwersteener und Brot für die Welt&quot; – dialectal German for “Roast beef for the Idarers, pork neck for the Obersteiners and bread for the world.”

====&quot;Fillsel&quot;====
This is toast, minced meat, diced bacon, leek, eggs, salt and pepper.

====&quot;Gefillte Klees&quot; (filled dumplings)====
This is coarse potato dumplings (made from raw potatoes) filled with &quot;Fillsel&quot; with a bacon sauce.

====&quot;Kartoffelwurst&quot; (potato sausage)====
Also dialectally called &quot;Krumbierewurscht&quot;, this was formerly “poor people’s food”, but today it is a speciality. Potatoes, pork, beef and onions are put through the mincer and seasoned with savoury, pepper and salt. It can be fed into the traditional gut, preserved in a jar or even eaten straightaway.

====&quot;Murde on Klees&quot; (carrots and dumplings)====
This is raw potato dumplings cooked and served together with carrots (sometimes known in German as &quot;Mohrrüben&quot;, or dialectally in Idar-Oberstein as &quot;Murde&quot;) and pickled or smoked pork.

====&quot;Riewe on Draehurjel&quot;====
This is beetroots with roast blood sausage.

====&quot;Dibbelabbes&quot;====
This is made by roasting &quot;Kartoffelmasse&quot; (potatoes, bacon, eggs, flour, salt and pepper) in a &quot;Dibbe&quot; (cast-iron roasting pan).

====&quot;Schaales&quot;====
This is &quot;Kartoffelmasse&quot; (the same as for &quot;Dibbelabbes&quot;) baked in a &quot;Dibbe&quot; in the oven with dried meat.

==Economy and infrastructure==
All together, Idar-Oberstein has roughly 219.3 ha of land given over to commerce. Three other areas in town, Dickesbacher Straße, Finkenberg Nord and Am Kreuz, hold a further 28 ha in reserve for economic expansion. The town also has at its disposal the rezoning area &quot;Gewerbepark Nahetal&quot; in the outlying centre of Nahbollenbach, comprising 23 ha.

The &quot;Bundesverband der Diamant- und Edelsteinindustrie e. V.&quot; (“Federal Association of the Diamond and Gemstone Industry”) has its seat in Idar-Oberstein. It represents the industry&#x27;s interests in dealings with lawmakers as well as federal, state and municipal representatives. It advises members in areas such as environmental protection, problems in competition, questions of nomenclature and so forth, and makes the necessary contacts as needed. To promote the designing and quality of jewellery and gemstones, the Association created the international competition revolving about the German Jewellery and Gemstone Prize.
The &quot;Deutsche Diamant- und Edelsteinbörse e. V.&quot; (“German Diamond and Gemstone Exchange”) was opened in 1974 as the world&#x27;s first combined exchange for diamonds as well as coloured gemstones. It is one of the 25 exchanges in the World Federation of Diamond Bourses.

The firm Klein &amp; Quenzer was among the best known producers of costume jewellery before it rose to become the biggest manufacturer of German medals and decorations during the two world wars.

The &quot;Wirtschaftsjunioren Idar-Oberstein&quot; were founded in 1972. Entrepreneurs and senior management join in this organization for economic, cultural and social purposes in the region.

The cookware manufacturer Fissler has its headquarters in town. The company became well known for its invention of the mobile field kitchen in 1892. Giloy und Söhne, one of Europe&#x27;s biggest diamond jewellery manufacturers, has its headquarters here, too.

For more than 20 years now, the International Trade Fair for Gemstones, Gemstone Jewellery and Gemstone Objects (“Intergem”) has been held in Idar-Oberstein. The fair takes place at the &quot;Jahnhaus&quot; in the constituent community of Algenrodt, although as of 2008, a move to the planned exhibition hall in the new Nahetal commercial park (former US Army storage depot Nahbollenbach) was being considered.

The &quot;Idar-Obersteiner Wirtschaftstage&quot; (“Economy Days”), initiated by the Idar-Oberstein Economic Promotional Association, are regarded in and around Idar-Oberstein as a regional fair.

===Natural gemstone deposits===
Gemstones from throughout the world are to be found in Idar-Oberstein, but the whole industry was begun by finds in the local area. These include agate, jasper and rock crystal.

===Garrison===

Since 1938, Idar-Oberstein has been a garrison town. During the 19th and 20th centuries, French and German soldiers in turn were stationed here. With the coming of the Wehrmacht, new barracks were built. After the Second World War, the &quot;Straßburgkaserne&quot; (“Strasbourg Barracks”) were at first used by the United States Army. French troops were stationed at the &quot;Klotzbergkaserne&quot;, and then as of 1956, the Bundeswehr artillery school. This moved in the late 1960s to the newly built &quot;Rilchenbergkaserne&quot;. Since that time, thousands of artillerymen have undergone their basic and advanced military training here. In September 2003, new boarding school buildings and teaching rooms were dedicated so that today&#x27;s artillery school has at its disposal both up-to-date lodging capacity and a training centre with all the modern equipment. Included among the teaching methods are audio, video and simulation techniques. Stationed at the &quot;Klotzbergkaserne&quot; until 31 March 2003 was the &quot;Beobachtungspanzerartillerielehrbataillon&quot; (“Observational Armoured Artillery Teaching Battalion”) 51, after whose dissolution in the course of Bundeswehr reform, the language training centre for officer cadets moved in. For businesses in Idar-Oberstein and environs, the Bundeswehr is a major economic factor as both an employer and a client. Since 1988, there has been a “sponsorship” between the town of Idar-Oberstein and the artillery school, and to highlight the relationship, town council decided in 1988 to put up a second roadsign that read “&quot;Hauptstadt der deutschen Artillerie&quot;” (“German Artillery Capital”). After objections from local business, among others the local chamber of commerce, and from some of the townsfolk, too, it was decided that the town would not go to the trouble of installing such signs after all. In 2006, the officer cadet battalion was disbanded.

===Transport===
Idar-Oberstein station, as a Regional-Express and Regionalbahn stop, is linked by way of the Nahe Valley Railway (Bingen–Saarbrücken) to the Saarland and the Frankfurt Rhine Main Region. The &quot;Rhein-Nahe-Express&quot; running the Mainz-Saarbrücken route serves the station hourly. Every other one of these trains goes through to the main railway station in Frankfurt with a stop at Frankfurt Airport. Formerly, fast trains on the Frankfurt-Paris route had a stop at Idar-Oberstein.

Local transport in Idar-Oberstein was run from 1900 to 1956 by trams, and from 1932 to 1969 by trolleybuses. Today&#x27;s network is made up of six bus routes run by the &quot;Verkehrsgesellschaft Idar-Oberstein GmbH&quot;, which belongs to the Rhenus Veniro Group. Furthermore, Idar-Oberstein is the starting point for Regio bus routes to Baumholder and Birkenfeld. There is also a direct bus link to Frankfurt-Hahn Airport. The most important road link in town is &quot;Bundesstraße&quot; 41; although there is no direct Autobahn link, the A 62 (Kaiserslautern–Trier) can be reached through interchanges at Birkenfeld (B 41) or Freisen.

==== Highway over the Nahe ====

In the 1980s, the river Nahe was covered over with a four-lane highway, &quot;Bundesstraße&quot; 41, mentioned above, putting the river underground, beneath the town. This is unique in Germany and has greatly changed the town&#x27;s appearance in this area. The first plans for this development (officially the &quot;Nahehochstraße&quot;) lay before planners as early as 1958, but they set off a wave of criticism that was felt far beyond the town&#x27;s limits. On the theme of “Highway over the Nahe – yes or no”, Südwestfunk broadcast a talk show in the 1980s. The project was meant to relieve traffic congestion in the inner town on the B 41, which at the time ran through what is now a narrow pedestrian precinct through the middle of the Old Town. Work on the project began in 1980, and lasted five years, after which the &quot;Nahehochstraße&quot; was at last completed. The Nahe had thus been channelled into a two-kilometre-long tunnel. A timber-frame house nearby, the &quot;Sachsenhaus&quot;, was torn down and put into storage, its pieces numbered. Its reconstruction has been indefinitely postponed. In 1986, the &quot;Naheüberbauung&quot;, as it is commonly known, was opened to traffic. For its 20th anniversary, there was an exhibition at the Idar-Oberstein &quot;Stadthaus&quot; (civic centre) with photo galleries about the planning, building and completion of the project.

For its efforts, Idar-Oberstein won an award in 1988 in a contest staged by German town planners: First Prize for Most Consequential Blighting of an Historic Townscape.

====I-O/Göttschied Airfield====
Idar-Oberstein/Göttschied Airfield lies north of the town between the constituent community of Göttschied and the municipalities of Gerach and Hintertiefenbach at an elevation of 480 m above sea level (1,575 feet). Its ICAO location indicator is EDRG. The grass landing strip&#x27;s orientation is 06/24, and it is 650 m long and 50 m wide. The allowable landing weight is 2 000 kg; however, with PPR (“prior permission required”), aircraft of up to 3 700 kg may land. The airport is designed for helicopters, motor gliders, gliders, ultralights and, also with PPR, skydivers.

Offered here on weekends are sightseeing flights by motorized aircraft, motor glider, glider and ultralight.

===Education===
Idar-Oberstein is home to every kind of educational institution, and since 1986, it has been a &quot;Hochschule&quot; location. The internationally renowned programme of Gemstone and Jewellery Design of the Faculty of Design at the University of Applied Sciences Trier is the only place in Europe where artistically-scientifically oriented studies in design in the field of gemstones and jewellery can be undertaken. It is found together with the professional school centre and the town&#x27;s only Realschule at the &quot;Schulzentrum Vollmersbachtal&quot;. There are several Hauptschulen throughout the town. There are moreover four Gymnasien: the Göttenbach-Gymnasium and the Gymnasium an der Heinzenwies can be attended beginning at the fifth class, while the Technisches Gymnasium and the Wirtschaftsgymnasium only admit students beginning in the eleventh class.

* The University of Mainz maintains the &quot;Institut für Edelsteinforschung&quot; (Institute for Gemstone Research) in Idar-Oberstein. The Gemstone Research Department belongs to the subject area of mineralogy in the Faculty of Earth Sciences.
* The University of Applied Sciences Trier offers at its Idar-Oberstein location a programme in Gemstone and Jewellery Design.
* The Deutsche Gemmologische Gesellschaft e. V. (“DGemG”, German Gemological Association) was founded in 1932 and developed into an internationally renowned institution of technical-scientific gemmology. Successful participation in the DGemG courses in gemmology and diamond studies leads to diploma certification of performance on examinations that qualify the graduate to apply for membership in the DGemG (F. G. G. – the F is for the German word &quot;Fachmitgliedschaft&quot;, or “professional membership”). Thus far, more than 30,000 participants from 75 countries have attended the DGemG programme, which is designed with the demands of the gemstone and jewellery industry in mind.
* The Forschungsinstitut für mineralische und metallische Werkstoffe Edelsteine/Edelmetalle GmbH (FEE; Research Institute for Mineral and Metallic Materials Gemstones/Precious Metals), too, has its seat in Idar-Oberstein. The FEE specializes in growing crystals and manufacturing optical elements for lasers.
* The Deutsche Diamantprüflabor GmbH (DPL; German Diamond Testing Laboratory) has been assessing since 1970 the quality of cut diamonds. As the first laboratory of its kind in Germany (and second in the world), the DPL has been officially certified by the German Testing Accreditation System in Berlin as being able to carry out competent quality assessment of diamonds with regards to colour, size, cut and proportion in accordance with internationally recognized standards.

In 1997, a Lufthansa Airbus A319-114 (registration number D-AILN) was christened “Idar-Oberstein”. It entered service on 12 September of that year. The aircraft was for a time leased to the firm Germanwings, but has since been reincorporated into Lufthansa&#x27;s fleet.

<text>496 (four hundred [and] ninety-six) is the natural number following 495 and preceding 497.

==In mathematics==
496 is most notable for being a perfect number, and one of the earliest numbers to be recognized as such. 496 is also a harmonic divisor number.

The group &quot;E&quot;8 has real dimension 496.

==In physics==
The number 496 is a very important number in superstring theory. In 1984, Michael Green and John H. Schwarz realized that one of the necessary conditions for a superstring theory to make sense is that the dimension of the gauge group of type I string theory must be 496. The group is therefore SO(32). Their discovery started the first superstring revolution. It was realized in 1985 that the heterotic string can admit another possible gauge group, namely E8 x E8.

==Telephone numbers==
The UK&#x27;s Ofcom reserves telephone numbers in many dialing areas in the 496 local block for fictional purposes, such as 0114 496-1234.

<doc id="456141" wikidata="Q2225977" url="?curid=456141" title="Beautiful sunbird">
<text>The beautiful sunbird (Cinnyris pulchellus), formerly placed in the genus &quot;Nectarinia&quot;, is a small passerine bird in the sunbird family Nectariniidae. It is native to tropical Africa, its range extending from Senegal and Guinea in the west to Sudan, South Sudan, Ethiopia, Tanzania and Kenya in the east. It was formerly considered to be conspecific with the gorgeous sunbird (&quot;Cinnyris melanogastrus&quot;).

==Taxonomy==
The beautiful sunbird was formally described in 1766 by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in the twelfth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; under the binomial name &quot;Certhia pulchella&quot;. Linnaeus based his account on &quot;Le grimpereau à longue queue du Sénégal&quot; that had been described and illustrated in 1760 by the French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson. The specific epithet is from Latin &quot;pulchellum&quot; meaning &quot;very pretty&quot; or &quot;beautiful little&quot;. Formerly placed in the genus &quot;Nectarinia&quot;, the beautiful sunbird is now one of 64 sunbirds placed in the genus &quot;Cinnyris&quot; that was introduced in 1816 by the French naturalist Georges Cuvier. It was previously considered to be conspecific with the gorgeous sunbird (&quot;Cinnyris melanogastrus&quot;) but the species were split based on the differences in morphology. The beautiful sunbird is monotypic: no subspecies are recognised.

==Description==
Beautiful sunbirds are tiny, only long, although the breeding male&#x27;s long tail adds another . They have medium-length thin down-curved bills and brush-tipped tubular tongues, both of which are adaptations to their nectar feeding. The male has a black head, bright metallic green upper parts, scarlet breast bordered with yellow and black belly. The central feathers of the teal are greatly elongated. The female is brown above with yellowish underparts.

==Distribution and habitat==
The beautiful sunbird occurs in Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Côte d&#x27;Ivoire, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Kenya, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone, South Sudan, Sudan, Tanzania, Togo and Uganda. This species is found in a variety of open habitats with some trees, including savannah, riverside thickets, mangroves, beachsides and gardens.

==Behaviour and ecology==
The sunbirds are a group of very small Old World passerine birds which feed largely on nectar, although they will also take insects, especially when feeding young. Flight is fast and direct on their short wings. Most species can take nectar by hovering like a hummingbird, but usually perch to feed most of the time. The beautiful sunbird is a common breeder across sub-Saharan tropical Africa. One or two eggs are laid in a suspended nest in a tree. It is a seasonal migrant within its range.

==Status==
The beautiful sunbird has a wide range and a large total population. It is a common bird and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed its conservation status as being of &quot;least concern&quot;.

<text>The manananggal () is a mythical creature in the Philippines that is able to separate its upper torso from the lower part of its body. Their fangs and wings give them a vampire-like appearance.

==Mythology==
The word &quot;manananggal&quot; comes from the Tagalog word &quot;tanggal&quot;, which means &quot;to remove&quot; or &quot;to separate&quot;, which literally translates as &quot;remover&quot; or &quot;separator&quot;. In this case, &quot;one who separates itself&quot;. The name also originates from an expression used for a severed torso.
The &quot;manananggal&quot; is described as scary, often hideous, usually depicted as female, and always capable of severing its upper torso with its intestines trailing out and sprouting huge bat-like wings to fly into the night in search of its victims. 

The &quot;manananggal&quot; is said to favor preying on sleeping, pregnant women, using an elongated proboscis-like tongue to suck out fetuses, or the blood of someone who is sleeping. It also haunts newlyweds or couples in love and sometimes newborn children. Due to being left at the altar, grooms-to-be are one of its main targets. The severed lower torso is left standing, and is the more vulnerable of the two halves. Sprinkling salt, smearing crushed garlic, lighting it on fire, or smearing ash on top of the standing torso is fatal to the creature. The upper torso then would not be able to rejoin itself and would perish by sunrise.

The myth of the &quot;manananggal&quot; is popular in the Visayan regions of the Philippines, especially in the western provinces of Capiz, Iloilo, Bohol and Antique. There are varying accounts of the features of a &quot;manananggal&quot;. Like vampires, Visayan folklore creatures, and &quot;aswangs&quot;, &quot;manananggals&quot; are also said to abhor garlic, salt and holy water. They were also known to avoid daggers, light, vinegar, spices and the tail of a stingray, which can be fashioned as a whip. Folklore of similar creatures can be found in the neighbouring nations of Indonesia and Malaysia. The province of Capiz is the subject or focus of many &quot;manananggal&quot; stories, as with the stories of other types of mythical creatures, such as ghosts, goblins, ghouls generically referred to as &quot;aswangs&quot;. Sightings are purported here, and certain local folk are said to believe in their existence despite modernization. The &quot;manananggal&quot; shares some features with the vampire of Balkan folklore, such as its dislike of garlic, salt, and vulnerability to sunlight.

<text>The Defense Switched Network (DSN) is a primary information transfer network for the Defense Information Systems Network (DISN) of the United States Department of Defense. The DSN provides the worldwide non-secure voice, secure voice, data, facsimile, and video teleconferencing services for DOD Command and Control (C2) elements, their supporting activities engaged in logistics, personnel, engineering, and intelligence, as well as other federal agencies.

In 1982, the DSN was designated by the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) and the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) as the provider of long-distance communications service for the DOD. The DSN is designated as a primary system of communication during peacetime, periods of crisis, preattack, non-nuclear, and post-attack phases of war. The network assures nonblocking service for users with &quot;flash&quot; and &quot;flash override&quot; precedence capabilities. Key users include the National Command Authorities, Commanders of the Combatant Commands, and subordinate component commanders. DSN replaced the older Autovon system.

The DSN consists of four subsystems:
*Switching,
*Transmission,
*Timing and Synchronization, and
*Network Administration and Management.
The DSN Switching Subsystem consists of multifunction, stand-alone tandem, end office, and remote switching units. Using the transmission, timing, and control elements of the DISN, they interconnect all military locations worldwide and provide end-to-end long-distance common user and dedicated voice, secure voice, data, and video services worldwide.

In addition to nonsecure voice, data, and video services, the DSN will provide transmission, switching, and support services for Secure Telephone Units, Third Generation (STU-IIIs, now obsolete), the Secure Terminal Equipment (STE), the Defense Red Switch Network (DRSN), the dial-up alternative routing for the Unclassified but Sensitive Internet Protocol (IP) Router Network (NIPRNet), and the Secret IP Router Network (SIPRNet). The DSN can also provide access to the Government Emergency Telephone System (GETS).

==Area codes==
Eight area codes are used to cover certain geographical areas for regular voice communications:
*311 for AFRICOM
*312 for the Continental United States (NORTHCOM) and Puerto Rico
*313 for the Caribbean
*314 for EUCOM
*315 for INDOPACOM
*317 for Alaska
*318 for CENTCOM
*319 for Canada (Canadian Switched Network (CSN))

Other area codes are assigned to functional areas:
*20x for interface with the United Kingdom&#x27;s Defence Fixed Telecommunications Service (DFTS)
*606 for interface with NATO&#x27;s Core Network (NCN)
*7xx for interface with Australia&#x27;s Defence Voice Network (DVN)
*715 for interface with New Zealand&#x27;s Defence Telephone Network (DTelN)

<doc id="456147" wikidata="Q11682006" url="?curid=456147" title="Speargun">
<text>A speargun is a ranged underwater fishing device designed to launch a tethered spear or harpoon to impale fish or other marine animals and targets. Spearguns are used in sport fishing and underwater target shooting. The two basic types are &quot;pneumatic&quot; and &quot;elastic&quot; (powered by rubber bands). Spear types come in a number of varieties including threaded, break-away and lined. Floats and buoys are common accessories when targeting larger fish.

==Components==
The basic components of a speargun are a spear, a stock or barrel, and a handle or grip containing a trigger mechanism. Spearguns are usually from long, round or roughly rectangular from in diameter/width.

==Types of spearguns==
Spearguns are, most often, divided according to propulsion method, with the two common variants being rubber (or band) powered, and air powered (pneumatic).

Band-powered spearguns, which are the simplest and cheapest to maintain, with rubber being the predominant material, come in two types: those made from wood (often referred to as a Hawaiian sling), and those of sealed tubing metal or composite and/or a combination of these materials construction: referred to as the stock or barrel respectively.

Spearguns of the tubular barrel variety have separate &quot;muzzles&quot; fitting in or over one end of the tube, for attaching the rubber bands; while others (usually those made of wood), mainly have the bands passing through a horizontal slot in the stock.

A rubber-powered speargun, besides the barrel, has the following parts:
*A spear (being a steel shaft slightly longer than the stock/barrel of from in diameter, which lies on top of the barrel or in a track or groove on the top), and a trigger mechanism to engage the spear (usually in or near a handle or grip at or near the rear) to keep the gun in a loaded state of readiness when it is loaded.
*Such loading is from one or more latex rubber bands (usually tubing) which provide the propelling force and are about one third of the barrel length and from in diameter, being attached to the front of the gun.
*The ends of these bands have ‘bridles’ or &#x27;wishbones&#x27;, (which are usually metal or synthetic cord) fitted to them and when these bands are pulled by the diver to engage the &#x27;wishbones&#x27; in notches in the spear or &#x27;fins&#x27; welded on the top at the rear just before the trigger, the gun is loaded.

A pneumatic gun differs from a rubber model in that it has a thicker spear that goes inside a sealed internal barrel encased in a hollow sealed outer casing that contains the air which is at ambient pressure until it is pumped up by hand to a pressure usually equal to one strong rubber band. The trigger mechanism (which is at the back of the gun) has a handle/grip below it or midway up the gun. Once at the required pressure the spear is forced down the barrel to engage the trigger mechanism and is then loaded and ready. There will usually be a strong line at least twice the length of the gun connecting the spear to the front of the gun. When loaded great caution must be exercised as the speargun is now a dangerous weapon. Without a trigger, rubber bands or air pressure the speargun cannot be loaded and therefore cannot function.

==Uses of spearguns==

* In tropical seas, some natives spearfish for a living, often using a home-made snorkelling kit
* Underwater target shooting

All spearguns have a trigger mechanism that holds a spear in place along the barrel.

Traditionally, rear-handle spearguns are popular in Europe and mid-handle guns were used in North America, however as spearfishing has developed as an international sport these distinctions have blurred.

South African speargun manufacturers have improved speargun designs with the use of a rail along the barrel that prevents the spear from flexing under pressure from the rubber bands.

===Improper uses===
* Spearguns have also been used as a weapon in a manner similar to a crossbow, usually far from water, and by assailants who use them in desperation to avoid the regulation of traditional firearms or the requirements of an archery or crossbow license; nominally, only a spearfishing license is required to possess one. 
** The planned hijacking of Federal Express Flight 705.
** The 2004 Sharpe family murders in Australia.

===Accessories===
The speargun can have:

* Buoy or float, tethered to the speargun or directly to the spear. It helps to subdue large fish. It can also assist in storing fish, but is more importantly used as a safety device to warn boat drivers there is diver in the area.
* Floatline, connecting the buoy to the speargun. Often made from woven plastic, they can also be a mono-filament encased in an airtight plastic tube, or made from stretchable bungee cord.

==Spear shaft types==
===Threaded===
Threaded shafts allow for different tips to be used by having them screw on or off. Some tips include a basic short tip with a folding flopper and others use longer tips with a rotating feature, usually with multiple floppers. When larger fish are targeted a break-away tip is recommended (not to be confused with the break-away setup below) as it allows some portion, usually , of the tip to &quot;break-away&quot; from the main shaft after it penetrates a fish allowing the shaft to &quot;fall out&quot; of the fish but maintain the fish connection by either a small steel cable or high-strength spectra or kevlar line.

===Hawaiian===
Hawaiian shafts are the simplest shaft as the tip is shaped on the end and a folding barb installed directly behind the tip to keep the fish from sliding off. There are different length barbs and sometimes multiples (sometimes referred to as a Florida rig).

==Speargun setups==
===Line rig===
In this setup, the most common, the speargun is attached to the shaft by a line. The line is usually a heavy monofilament ( test), spectra, or other spectra-like material (braided line) with 180–270+ kg (400–600+ lb) rating. The line wraps around the bottom or side of the gun upon loading and releases via a mechanical release or tension release to allow the line to travel with the spear after firing. There are typically two different methods of connecting the line to the spear shaft, either a slide ring that travels up and down the shaft to machined stopping points or via a hole drilled through some portion of the shaft (usually the rear). This is the most common method for taking fish by speargun and the majority of the other types of setups use the mentioned connection options to the shaft. Some newer setups offer an option to quickly attach line to, or disconnect from, a shaft making for a line or free shaft option on a single speargun.

===Speed rig===
Here the spear gun is connected to a buoy via a float rope. After spearing a fish, the spearfisher detaches the float rope and uses a speed stick (a metal spike) attached to the float rope to thread the fish onto the float rope through its gills. The fish will then gradually slide up the float rope as the diver swims until it rests underneath the buoy. When shooting larger fish, the diver can let go of his gun and play the fish from the float line, giving the fish more room to tire and preventing it from tearing off the spear or dragging the spearfisher under the water.

===Break-away rig===
Here the spear shaft is connected directly to the buoy. It is loosely fitted to the gun as well while hunting, but after the spear is fired its force of movement detaches the line from the gun. The spearfisher is then able to subdue the fish from the buoy or float line while retaining possession of his gun. This is for two reasons. Firstly, the gun can be used to push off sharks or signal the boat driver, and secondly to prevent loss of the gun should the fish break the line, or should the spearfisher lose grip on the buoy. This setup can be used in conjunction with elastic bungee-style rope and a body board style float with locking cleats. This respectively maintains constant pressure on the fish and allows the spearfisher to rest while being towed around. They can then gather the bungee line as the fish tires and lock it off in order to gradually pull the fish closer.

===Reel on gun===
Here the gun has a line reel like on a fishing rod. After spearing a fish, the reel unwinds, allowing the spearfisher room to play the fish. Reel setups are useful when ocean structures such as built up reef or kelp gardens prevent the spearfisher from towing a buoy.

===Free-shafting===
Here the spear shaft is not connected to a gun or buoy. This is more commonly associated with spearfishing on scuba where excess cable or line can be problematic. Also it can be used in the areas with exceptionally clear water, where underwater hunter can track his shaft after firing it. It is not used in turbid waters with poor visibility.

===Riding rig===
Here, the spear shaft is connected to monofilament or other small high strength line, which is wrapped around the speargun, then connected to a larger, easier to handle rope which the diver holds in his hand. On the larger rope there is a loop on the end big enough for the divers thumb. The rope is placed on the thumb, then wrapped around the back of the hand. In this setup the spear is also totally free from the gun, allowing the diver to work the fish using the large rope, while keeping his gun safe. If the fish is too large to hang on to, the diver can tie it off or release it, only losing his spear and rope. This is used usually when fishing around oil rigs, or other hazardous diving such as hunting larger fish or in poor visibility.

<text>CoolWebSearch (also known as CoolWWWSearch or abbreviated as CWS) is a spyware or virus program that installs itself on Microsoft Windows based computers. It first appeared in May 2003.

== Effects ==
CoolWebSearch has numerous capabilities when it is successfully installed on a user&#x27;s computer. The program can change an infected computer&#x27;s web browser homepage to &#x27;coolwebsearch.com&#x27;, and though originally thought to only work on Internet Explorer, recent variants affect Mozilla Firefox as well as Google Chrome, and others. Infected computers can create pop-up ads which redirect to other websites, including pornography sites, collect private information about users, and slow the connection speed.

CoolWebSearch uses various techniques to evade detection and removal, which many common spyware removal programs are unable to properly remove the software. Since CoolWebSearch is bundled with other potentially unwanted software or add-ons, users need to uninstall those unwanted programs first, or CoolWebSearch can return, even after the user has changed their home page and primary search engine.

Some versions of CoolWebSearch are installed through what&#x27;s known as &#x27;drive-by installation&#x27;, in which browsing an infected webpage can automatically install CoolWebSearch without the user&#x27;s knowledge. CoolWebSearch attempts to evade detection by not labelling the ads it presents as such, nor does it provide a EULA, nor any data about itself nor is there a website directly associated with it. Certain variants insert links on random text, leading to advertisements. Others attempt to access websites which are redirected to pay-per-click search engines which may install more malware display ads. Some variants of CoolWebSearch also add links to pornography, and gambling sites to the user&#x27;s Desktop, Internet Explorer&#x27;s bookmarks and history. Certain versions attempt to edit users&#x27; trusted sites and modify security settings as well as to hide from removal programs. Variants are often named for the effects they have such as msconfig, Msoffice, Mupdate, Msinfo and Svchost32.

== Possible creators ==
The website claims that they are not responsible for the browser hijacking. They run an affiliate program that pays affiliates to direct others to their site with paid advertising links. Coolwebsearch.com&#x27;s terms of service use the laws of Quebec, Canada, whilst their DNS registration lists an address in the British Virgin Islands, and their web server appears to be run by HyperCommunications in Massachusetts, USA. CoolWebSearch is also linked to CoolWebSearch.org and appears to be related to webcoolsearch.com. Investigation connected Stanislav Avdeyko, the Koobface hacker, with CoolWebSearch.

<doc id="456150" wikidata="Q630312" url="?curid=456150" title="Arbor Low">
<text>Arbor Low is a well-preserved Neolithic henge in the Derbyshire Peak District, England. It lies on a Carboniferous Limestone plateau known as the White Peak area. The monument consists of a stone circle surrounded by earthworks and a ditch.

== Description ==

The monument includes about 50 large limestone blocks, quarried from a local site, which form an egg-shaped circle. There were probably 41–43 stones originally, but some are now in fragments. They range in size from , with monoliths of between . One stone is partially upright; the rest are lying flat. Although it is often stated that the stones have never stood upright, it is possible that they had originally been set upright in shallow stone holes.

In the centre of the circle lie at least six smaller blocks known as the cove, originally believed to have been set in a rectangle.

The stones are surrounded by an earth bank, approximately at the outside edges and high, with an interior ditch about 2 metres deep and wide. There are two causeway entrances breaching both the bank and ditch; a north-west entrance wide, and a south-east entrance wide. The inner bank encloses an area of .

Few henge monuments in the British Isles are as well preserved.

== Finds ==
Human skeletal remains were discovered close to the cove during excavations between 1901 and 1902. Other finds have included flint scrapers, arrowheads, and bone and antler tools.

== Surrounding landscape ==
A large Bronze Age round cairn or barrow was built later, to the east of the henge, using material taken from the earth bank. It was excavated in 1845 and found to contain a cremation burial, flint and bone artefacts, and two pots similar to Late Neolithic Peterborough ware now in the care of Weston Park Museum.

Arbor Low is part of a larger complex, and is linked by an earth ridge to the earlier Neolithic oval barrow of Gib Hill 320m away.

== Construction and usage ==
The bank and ditch of the henge, as well as its two entrances, were probably established in the Late Neolithic period, with the stones added later, sometime before 2000 BCE. The site seems to have been in use until the Bronze Age, when the outer bank was reconstructed so that the round barrow could be erected. Both the earthworks and the stoneworks are probably later than the nearby Gib Hill.

== Statutory protection ==
Arbor Low was one of the first ancient monuments to be given statutory protection, on 18 August 1882. Small stone markers engraved VR and GR (for &quot;Victoria Regina&quot; and &quot;Georgius Rex&quot;) still stand around the henge, demarcating the protected area. One of the VR stones, having been damaged, has been replaced by one bearing CR (for &quot;Charles Rex&quot; – meaning Charles III).

== Access ==
The henge stands on private farmland but is accessible to the public. As of September 2020, an entrance fee of £1 per adult is requested. Children can enter free of charge.

<doc id="456161" wikidata="Q135712" url="?curid=456161" title="Tropical climate">
<text>Tropical climate is the first of the five major climate groups in the Köppen climate classification identified with the letter A. Tropical climates are defined by a monthly average temperature of or higher in the coolest month, featuring hot temperatures and high humidity all year-round. Annual precipitation is often abundant in tropical climates, and shows a seasonal rhythm but may have seasonal dryness to varying degrees. There are normally only two seasons in tropical climates, a wet (rainy/monsoon) season and a dry season. The annual temperature range in tropical climates is normally very small. Sunlight is intense in these climates.

There are three basic types of tropical climates within the tropical climate group: tropical rainforest climate (Af), tropical monsoon climate (Am) and tropical savanna or tropical wet and dry climate (Aw for dry winters, and As for dry summers), which are classified and distinguished by the precipitation levels of the driest month in those regions.

== Köppen climate classification ==
The Köppen climate classification is the most widely used climate classification system. It defines a tropical climate as a region where the mean temperature of the coldest month is greater than or equal to and does not fit into the criteria for B-group climates, classifying them as an A-group (tropical climate group). A-group regions are usually found in the tropics, below 23.5 latitude in both the southern and northern hemisphere; they include areas around the Equator, Central America, North-central portions of South America, central Africa, southern portions of Asia and parts of North Australia and the Pacific Ocean islands.

In Group A, there are three types of this climate: the tropical rainforest climate (Af), tropical monsoon climate (Am) and tropical wet and dry or savanna climate (Aw or As). All of the three climates are classified by their Pdry (short for precipitation of the driest month). Tropical rainforest climate&#x27;s Pdry should be greater than or equal . Tropical monsoon climate&#x27;s Pdry should be in the range from formula_1 to 60 mm. Tropical wet and dry or savanna climate&#x27;s Pdry should be less than formula_1.
== Tropical climate biome ==

Tropical climates normally have only two seasons, a wet season and a dry season. Depending on the location of the region, the wet and dry seasons can have varying duration. Annual temperature changes in the tropics are small. Due to the high temperatures and abundant rainfall, much of the plant life grows throughout the year. High temperature and humidity is the most suitable environment for epiphytes to grow. In many tropical climates, vegetation grow in layers: shrubs under tall trees, bushes under shrubs and grasses under bushes. Tropical plants are rich in resources, including coffee, cocoa and oil palm. Listed below are the types of vegetation unique to each of the three climates that make up the tropical climate biome.

=== Natural vegetation ===
Tropical rainforest vegetation including: Bengal bamboo, bougainvillea, curare, coconut tree, durian and banana.

Tropical monsoon vegetation including: teak, deodar, rosewood, sandalwood and bamboo.

Tropical wet and dry or savanna vegetation including: acacia senegal, elephant grass, jarrah tree, gum tree eucalyptus and whistling thorn.

== Tropical rainforest climate ==
The Köppen classification identifies tropical rainforest climates (Zone Af: f = &quot;feucht&quot;, German for moist) as usually having north and south latitudinal ranges of just 5-10 degrees from the equator. Tropical rainforest climates have high temperatures: the yearly average temperature is normally between . The precipitation can reach over 100 inches a year. The seasons are evenly distributed throughout the year, and there is almost no drought period here. Regions that contain tropical rainforest climate mainly include the upper Amazon basin of South America, the Northern Zaire (Congo) basin of Africa, and the islands of the East Indies.

The tropical rainforest climate differs from other subtypes of tropical climates as it has more kinds of trees due to its precipitation. The large number of trees contribute back to the humidity of the climate because of the transpiration, which is the process of water evaporated from the surface of living plants to the atmosphere. The warmth and abundant precipitation heavily contributes to the diversity and characteristics of vegetations under the tropical rainforest climate. The vegetations develop a vertical stratification and various growth forms to receive enough sunlight, which is unusual under other types of climate.

== Tropical monsoon climate ==

The Köppen classification tool identifies tropical monsoon climate as having small annual temperature ranges, high temperatures, and plentiful precipitation. This climate also has a short dry season which almost always occurs in the winter. The tropical monsoon climate is often found within countries in the south and southeast Asia region between the latitude of 10 degrees north and the Tropic of Cancer. It can also be found in West Africa and South America. The annual temperature of regions under tropical monsoon climate is also stable.

The tropical monsoon climate has the following main characteristic. The average annual temperature is around and has an average annual temperature range of about . Distinction between wet and drought seasons, the tropical monsoon climate is different from other tropical climates because of its uneven precipitation throughout the year.

There are three main seasons of tropical monsoon climate: the cool dry season is from fall to late winter, the hot dry season is in the spring and the rainy or monsoon season is near or during the summer months.

The tropical monsoon forest mainly consists of three layered structures. The first layer is the surface layer which is a very dense layer of shrubs and grasses. The second layer is the understory layer with trees about 15 meters tall. The top layer is called the canopy tree layer which has trees from 25 to 40 meters tall and those trees grow closely while above is the emergent layer with sporadic trees taller than 35 meters.

== Tropical savanna or wet and dry climate ==

Tropical savanna climates, or tropical wet and dry climates, are mainly located between the 10° and 25° north-south latitudes, and often occur at the outer margins of the tropics. Typical regions include central Africa, parts of South America, as well as northern and eastern Australia. The temperature range of savanna climate is between . In summer, the temperature is between 25 °C and 30 °C, while in winter the temperature is between 20 °C and 30 °C, but still stays above an 18 °C mean. The annual precipitation is between 700 and 1000 mm. The driest months are generally in the winter and they have less than 60 mm of rainfall (often much less).

Regions under the savanna climate usually have lands covered with flat grassland vegetation with areas of woodlands. Those grassland biomes cover almost 20% of the Earth&#x27;s surface. The grassland vegetation types include Rhodes grass, red oats grass, star grass and lemongrass.

<text>Ignaz Maybaum (2 March 1897 – 12 June 1976) was a rabbi and 20th-century liberal Jewish theologian.

== Life ==
Maybaum was born in Vienna in 1897. His uncle was the rabbi Sigmund Maybaum. He studied in Berlin at the Hochschule für die Wissenschaft des Judentums, where he was ordained as a rabbi in 1926. He took rabbinic posts in Bingen, Frankfurt an der Oder and Berlin. He was a disciple of Franz Rosenzweig.

In 1935 he was arrested by the Gestapo, spending six weeks in prison before being released. Leaving Germany in 1938, Maybaum was given work in the United Synagogue by the British Chief Rabbi, Joseph Hertz. His mother and sisters were killed in the Holocaust.

In 1949 he became rabbi of Edgware and District Reform Synagogue. From 1956 until his retirement in 1963, he lectured in homiletics and theology at Leo Baeck College. He was also active in inter-religious dialogue. His students include Nicholas de Lange.

== Holocaust theology ==
Maybaum wrote many reflections on Judaism, Christianity, the Holocaust and Zionism. He also wrote on Islam. He is most frequently remembered for his controversial view in &quot;The Face of God After Auschwitz&quot; (1965) that the suffering of Jews in the Holocaust was vicarious atonement for the sins of the rest of the world. He was connecting the Jewish people to the figure of the &quot;suffering servant&quot; of Isaiah 52 and 53 in the Tanakh (the Christian Old Testament). In the same work he employed Christian imagery, speaking of Auschwitz as the new Golgotha and the gas chambers as replacing the cross.

<doc id="456168" wikidata="Q15072754" url="?curid=456168" title="Mark Lamarr">
<text>Mark Lamarr (born Mark Jones; 7 January 1967) is an English comedian, radio disc jockey and television presenter. He was a team captain on &quot;Shooting Stars&quot; from 1995 to 1997, and hosted &quot;Never Mind the Buzzcocks&quot; from 1996 to 2005.

==Career==

===Television===
Lamarr first came to the public&#x27;s attention as a co-presenter of the early 1990s late night variety show &quot;The Word&quot;. The magazine format of the series allowed for interviews, live music, features and even game shows. The flexible late-night format meant that guests could do just about anything to be controversial. Talking about his TV career to Jo Brown of &quot;Cheers Magazine&quot;, Lamarr said &quot;The Word&quot; was:

After leaving &quot;The Word&quot;, Lamarr was an outside presenter on &quot;The Big Breakfast&quot; from 1992 to 1996. Between 1995 and 1997 he appeared as a team captain in the surreal panel show &quot;Shooting Stars&quot;, where he displayed a mixture of dour boredom and contempt towards hosts Vic Reeves and Bob Mortimer who, in turn, mocked his &quot;50s throw-back&quot; appearance. Lamarr declined to return for the fourth series in 2002, claiming he did not want to be typecast for appearing on panel shows. He said of his experience on the show:

Lamarr was host of &quot;Never Mind the Buzzcocks&quot; when the show launched in 1996 and continued in this role for 17 series until 2005. Under Lamarr, the show gained a reputation for scornful treatment of the boy bands and the pop music that had dominated the music scene since the early 1990s, a position that was maintained by his successor. Lamarr left the show in 2005 and initially claimed he intended to return after one series away. However, Lamarr later confirmed via Twitter in 2022 that he said that to avoid questions about leaving the show. He was ultimately replaced by Simon Amstell from the 19th series.

The second series of the sitcom &quot;15 Storeys High&quot; was co-written by Lamarr with comedians Sean Lock and Martin Trenaman, although Lamarr was credited under his original name, Mark Jones. Lamarr made a cameo appearance in the fourth episode of series two.

===Radio===
Lamarr has previously presented shows on BBC GLR, BBC Radio 5 and BBC Radio 1. He also often guest presented the late night BBC Radio 2 show, sitting in for Mark Radcliffe.

On 20 July 1998, Lamarr launched a new show on BBC Radio 2 called &quot;Shake, Rattle and Roll&quot;, where he played tracks from his own record collection of obscure rock and roll. He also presented &quot;The Reggae Show&quot; series and &quot;Mark Lamarr&#x27;s Alternative Sixties&quot;, playing lesser known tracks from the 1960s.

On 22 April 2006, Lamarr started a new Radio 2 show called &quot;God&#x27;s Jukebox&quot;. The show aired from midnight to 3.00am on Saturdays and featured a wide variety of music from the previous 70 years including soul, ska, reggae, country, gospel and rap. He also, with Jo Brand, regularly covered the Jonathan Ross Saturday morning show on Radio 2 when Ross was away. His final God&#x27;s Jukebox show was broadcast on Christmas Eve/Day, 2010. At the end of 2010 Lamarr left Radio 2, claiming the station had lost interest in non-mainstream music. In a 2013 interview with music website “Famous Last Words”, Lamarr stated that he would return to radio in the future. 

Lamarr presented a music show for British Airways on-board listeners as part of their in-flight entertainment. In this show he presented a mix of rock and roll, blues, reggae, soul and R&amp;B.

===Post-radio career===
Lamarr has continued to produce compilation albums for several record labels, with an emphasis on lesser-known rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll tracks. He produced a compilation for Vee-Tone Records in 2015. Lamarr joined Twitter in 2018 and uses the platform to showcase lesser known music.

Lamarr made a return to comedy in September 2020, appearing in an episode of the BBC Radio 4 sitcom &quot;Phil Ellis Is Trying&quot; as the voice of Billy Bonker, the reclusive owner of a Cup-a-Soup factory.

<doc id="456169" wikidata="Q410759" url="?curid=456169" title="Sodalite">
<text>Sodalite ( ) is a tectosilicate mineral with the formula , with royal blue varieties widely used as an gemstone. Although massive sodalite samples are opaque, crystals are usually transparent to translucent. Sodalite is a member of the sodalite group with hauyne, nosean, lazurite and tugtupite.

The people of the Caral culture traded for sodalite from the Collao altiplano. First discovered by Europeans in 1811 in the Ilimaussaq intrusive complex in Greenland, sodalite did not become widely important as an ornamental stone until 1891 when vast deposits of fine material were discovered in Ontario, Canada.

== Structure ==

The structure of sodalite was first studied by Linus Pauling in 1930. It is a cubic mineral of space group P3n (space group 218) which consists of an aluminosilicate cage network with Na+ cations and chloride anions in the interframework. (There may be small amounts of other cations and anions instead.) This framework forms a zeolite cage structure. Each unit cell has two cavities, which have almost the same structure as the borate cage found in the zinc borate , the beryllosilicate cage , and the aluminate cage in ), and as in the similar mineral tugtupite () (see Haüyne#Sodalite group). There is one cavity around each chloride ion. One chloride is located at the corners of the unit cell, and the other at the centre. Each cavity has chiral tetrahedral symmetry, and the cavities around these two chloride locations are mirror images one of the other (a glide plane or a four-fold improper rotation takes one into the other). There are four sodium ions around each chloride ion (at one distance, and four more at a greater distance), surrounded by twelve tetrahedra and twelve tetrahedra. The silicon and aluminum atoms are located at the corners of a truncated octahedron with the chloride and four sodium atoms inside. (A similar structure called &quot;carbon sodalite&quot; may occur as a very high pressure form of carbon — see illustration in reference.) Each oxygen atom links between an tetrahedron and an tetrahedron. All the oxygen atoms are equivalent, but one half are in environments that are enantiomorphic to the environments of the other half. The silicon atoms are at the location formula_1 and symmetry-equivalent positions, and the aluminum ions at the location formula_2and symmetry-equivalent positions. The three silicon atoms and the three aluminum atoms listed above closest to a given corner of the unit cell form a six-membered ring of tetrahedra, and the four in any face of the unit cell form a four-membered ring of tetrahedra. The six-membered rings can serve as channels in which ions can diffuse through the crystal.

The structure is a crumpled form of a structure in which the three-fold axes of each tetrahedron lie in planes parallel to the faces of the unit cell, thus putting half the oxygen atoms in the faces. As the temperature is raised the sodalite structure expands and uncrumples, becoming more like this structure. In this structure the two cavities are still chiral, because no indirect isometry centred on the cavity (i.e. a reflexion, inversion, or improper rotation) can superimpose the silicon atoms onto silicon atoms and the aluminum atoms onto aluminum atoms, while also superimposing the sodium atoms on other sodium atoms. A discontinuity of the thermal expansion coefficient occurs at a certain temperature when chloride is replaced by sulfate or iodide, and this is thought to happen when the framework becomes fully expanded or when the cation (sodium in natural sodalite) reaches the coordinates formula_3 (et cetera). This adds symmetry (such as mirror planes in the faces of the unit cell) so that the space group becomes Pmn (space group 223), and the cavities cease to be chiral and take on pyritohedral symmetry.
Natural sodalite holds primarily chloride anions in the cages, but they can be substituted by other anions such as sulfate, sulfide, hydroxide, trisulfur with other minerals in the sodalite group representing end member compositions. The sodium can be replaced by other alkali group elements, and the chloride by other halides. Many of these have been synthesized.

The characteristic blue color arises mainly from caged and clusters.

== Properties ==

A light, relatively hard yet fragile mineral, sodalite is named after its sodium content; in mineralogy it may be classed as a feldspathoid. Well known for its blue color, sodalite may also be grey, yellow, green, or pink and is often mottled with white veins or patches. The more uniformly blue material is used in jewellery, where it is fashioned into cabochons and beads. Lesser material is more often seen as facing or inlay in various applications.

Although somewhat similar to lazurite and lapis lazuli, sodalite rarely contains pyrite (a common inclusion in lapis) and its blue color is more like traditional royal blue rather than ultramarine. It is further distinguished from similar minerals by its white (rather than blue) streak. Sodalite&#x27;s six directions of poor cleavage may be seen as incipient cracks running through the stone.

Most sodalite will fluoresce orange under ultraviolet light, and hackmanite exhibits tenebrescence.
== Hackmanite ==

Hackmanite is a variety of sodalite exhibiting tenebrescence. When hackmanite from Mont Saint-Hilaire (Quebec) or Ilímaussaq (Greenland) is freshly quarried, it is generally pale to deep violet but the color fades quickly to greyish or greenish white. Conversely, hackmanite from Afghanistan and the Myanmar Republic starts off creamy white but develops a violet to pink-red color in sunlight. If left in a dark environment for some time, the violet will fade again. Tenebrescence is accelerated by the use of longwave or, particularly, shortwave ultraviolet light.

== Occurrence ==
Sodalite was first described in 1811 for the occurrence in its type locality in the Ilimaussaq complex, Narsaq, West Greenland.

Occurring typically in massive form, sodalite is found as vein fillings in plutonic igneous rocks such as nepheline syenites. It is associated with other minerals typical of silica-undersaturated environments, namely leucite, cancrinite and natrolite. Other associated minerals include nepheline, titanian andradite, aegirine, microcline, sanidine, albite, calcite, fluorite, ankerite and baryte.

Significant deposits of fine material are restricted to but a few locales: Bancroft, Ontario (Princess Sodalite Mine), and Mont-Saint-Hilaire, Quebec, in Canada; and Litchfield, Maine, and Magnet Cove, Arkansas, in the US. The Ice River complex, near Golden, British Columbia, contains sodalite. Smaller deposits are found in South America (Brazil and Bolivia), Portugal, Romania, Burma and Russia. Hackmanite is found principally in Mont-Saint-Hilaire and Greenland.

Euhedral, transparent crystals are found in northern Namibia and in the lavas of Vesuvius, Italy.

&quot;Sodalitite&quot; is a type of extrusive igneous rock rich in sodalite. Its intrusive equivalent is &quot;sodalitolite&quot;.

==History==
The people of the Caral culture traded for sodalite from the Collao altiplano.

==Synthesis==

The mesoporous cage structure of sodalite makes it useful as a container material for many anions. Some of the anions known to have been included in sodalite-structure materials include nitrate, iodide, iodate, permanganate, perchlorate, and perrhenate.

<doc id="456180" wikidata="Q1339874" url="?curid=456180" title="Genius loci">
<text>In classical Roman religion, a genius loci (: &quot;genii locorum&quot;) was the protective spirit of a place. It was often depicted in religious iconography as a figure holding attributes such as a cornucopia, patera (libation bowl), or snake. Many Roman altars found throughout the Western Roman Empire were dedicated to a particular &quot;genius loci&quot;. The Roman imperial cults of the Emperor and the imperial house developed in part in connection with the sacrifices made by neighborhood associations &quot;(vici)&quot; to the local &quot;genius&quot;. These 265 local districts had their cult organised around the &quot;Lares Compitales&quot; (guardian spirits or &quot;lares&quot; of the crossroads), which the emperor Augustus transformed into &quot;Lares Augusti&quot; along with the &quot;Genius Augusti&quot;. The emperor&#x27;s &quot;genius&quot; is then regarded as the &quot;genius loci&quot; of the Roman Empire as a whole.

Roman examples of these &quot;genii&quot; can be found, for instance, at the church of St. Giles, Tockenham, Wiltshire, England, where the &quot;genius loci&quot; is depicted as a relief in the wall of a Norman church built of Roman material. This shows &quot;a youthful and curly-haired Roman Genius worked in high relief, holding a cornucopia in his left hand and a &quot;patera&quot; in his right&quot;, which previously has been &quot;erroneously identified as Asclepius&quot;.

==Asian usage==
The numinous spirits of places in Asia are still honored today in city pillar shrines, outdoor spirit houses and indoor household and business shrines. 

==Western usage==
In contemporary usage, &quot;genius loci&quot; usually refers to a location&#x27;s distinctive atmosphere or a &quot;spirit of the place&quot; rather than necessarily a guardian spirit. An example of contemporary usage might be &quot;Light reveals the &quot;genius loci&quot; of a place.&quot; 

==Art and architecture==
Alexander Pope made the &quot;genius loci&quot; an important principle in garden and landscape design with the following lines from &quot;Epistle IV, to Richard Boyle, Earl of Burlington&quot;:

Pope&#x27;s verse laid the foundation for one of the most widely agreed principles of landscape architecture, that landscape designs should always be adapted to the context in which they are located.

A priori, archetype, and &quot;genius loci&quot; are the primary principals of Neo-Rationalism or New Rationalism. Pioneered by the Italian architect Aldo Rossi, Neo-Rationalism developed in the light of a re-evaluation of the work of Giuseppe Terragni and gained momentum through the work of Giorgio Grassi. Characterized by elemental vernacular forms and an adaptation to the existing environment, the Neo-Rationalist style has adherents beyond architecture in the greater world of art.

In the context of modern architectural theory, &quot;genius loci&quot; has profound implications for place-making, falling within the philosophical branch of phenomenology. This field of architectural discourse is explored most notably by the theorist Christian Norberg-Schulz in his book, &quot;Genius Loci: Towards a Phenomenology of Architecture&quot;.

==Modern fantasy==
Adaptations of the original concept of the &quot;genius loci&quot; appear in some modern fantasy works.

Tom Bombadil in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; has been described by Tolkien scholar Tom Shippey as the &quot;genius loci&quot; of the Old Forest, a wooded land bordering the Shire.

In the &quot;Dungeons and Dragons&quot; 3.0 edition book the Epic Level Handbook, the &quot;genius loci&quot; is a malign, powerful ooze that mimics the landscape and has no intelligence of its own. It can magically enslave a visitor whose mind affects the &quot;genius loci&quot;&#x27;s behaviour. It is spontaneously generated when a place is undisturbed for a long time.

In &quot;The Dresden Files&quot;, a &quot;genius loci&quot; is an elemental spirit of a place. The island of Demonreach has a &quot;genius loci&quot;, also named Demonreach, which is omniscient regarding the island. Wizards can form a spiritual connection with a &quot;genius loci&quot; and the place it represents.

The Rivers of London series of novels by Ben Aaronovitch feature many beings described as &quot;genii locorum&quot;, primarily those of the River Thames and its tributaries.

<text>The collared sunbird (Hedydipna collaris) is a bird species of the family Nectariniidae. The sunbirds are a group of very small Old World passerine birds which feed largely on nectar, although they will also take insects, especially when feeding young. The collared sunbird is in fact mainly insectivorous.

Sunbird flight is fast and direct on their short wings. Most species can take nectar by hovering like a hummingbird, but usually perch to feed most of the time.

The collared sunbird is a common breeder across most of sub-Saharan Africa. Two or three eggs are laid in a suspended nest in a tree. It is a seasonal bird migrant within its range.

Collared sunbirds are tiny, only long. They have short thin down-curved bills and brush-tipped tubular tongues, both adaptations to nectar feeding.

The adult male has glossy green upperparts and head with a yellow belly and narrow purple breast band. The female is a duller green above and entirely yellow below.

This species inhabits forests near water.

<text>Beaverton is a community in Brock Township in the Regional Municipality of Durham, Ontario, Canada. It is located on the eastern shore of Lake Simcoe at the mouth of the Beaver River.

==History==
Beaverton was first settled in 1822. It was called Calder&#x27;s Mills (after an early miller Duncan Miller and Alexander Calder), Mill Town and Milton until it was renamed Beaverton when the post office was opened in 1835.

By 1869, Beaverton was a village with a population of 700 in the Township of Thorah Township in Ontario County. It was the terminus of the Port Hope, Lindsay and Beaverton Railway in 1858. The steamer Emily May plied daily between Beaverton and Bell Ewart station of the Northern Railroad. There were stages daily to Whitby and Oshawa. In 1884, Beaverton separated from the Township and was incorporated as a Village.

As part of the creation of Durham Region in 1974, Beaverton was amalgamated with Thorah Township, the original Brock Township and the Villages of Cannington and Sunderland to create the newly expanded Township of Brock.

Today, Beaverton is the largest community in Brock. There are three elementary schools in Beaverton and area, as well as an arena, curling club, public library, small harbour and yacht club. The local economy is based on the provision of services to the surrounding area, supplemented by some manufacturing (car parts manufacturer Flex N Gate See burn). Tourism also plays a role; the Trent-Severn Waterway connects with Lake Simcoe a few kilometres north of Beaverton and the area attracts cottagers from other regions of the Province.

Beaverton&#x27;s downtown core has many stores, services, and two bars, attracting people from around the local area.

Beaverton is the home of The Strand Theatre. The Old Stone Church, built in 1853 and a National Historic Site of Canada, is also located in Beaverton.

The local post office services the town with lock boxes and rural routes.

==Notable people==
* Ron Baird – Sculptor.
* Lieutenant William John Gillespie – World War I flying ace.
* Foster Hewitt – NHL broadcaster.
* Tim McCaskell – educator, writer, and activist.
* Basil and Chris McRae – NHLers.
* John Ritchie MacNicol – Member of Parliament.
* Duncan Macpherson – Editorial cartoonist.
* Richard McMillan – Shakespearean actor.

==In popular culture==
* The 1973, Canadian horror classic, &quot;Cannibal Girls&quot;, was filmed in the downtown of Beaverton. Sections of the downtown (The Strand Theatre, King&#x27;s Bishop Tavern, the library and the bridge) can all be seen. In the movie, the fictitious town that Beaverton filled in for was called &quot;Farnhamville&quot;.
* The 1984 comedy, &quot;Oddballs&quot;, was also shot in the area just north along Lake Simcoe, and also at the Trent-Severn Waterway&#x27;s bridge entry into the lake.
* &quot;The Story of Life&quot; starring a young girl on a mission to find her lost father was filmed here.
* The movie &quot;Jasper, Texas&quot; was partially filmed in and around Beaverton, as was the 1987 thriller &quot;Dead of Winter&quot;.
* In 2012 the Canadian music group The Strumbellas filmed the music video for the song &quot;Sheriff&quot; here.

<doc id="456204" wikidata="Q2274700" url="?curid=456204" title="Organic geochemistry">
<text>Organic geochemistry is the study of the impacts and processes that organisms have had on the Earth. It is mainly concerned with the composition and mode of origin of organic matter in rocks and in bodies of water. The study of organic geochemistry is traced to the work of Alfred E. Treibs, &quot;the father of organic geochemistry.&quot; Treibs first isolated metalloporphyrins from petroleum. This discovery established the biological origin of petroleum, which was previously poorly understood. Metalloporphyrins in general are highly stable organic compounds, and the detailed structures of the extracted derivatives made clear that they originated from chlorophyll.

==Applications==
===Energy===
====Petroleum====

The relationship between the occurrence of organic compounds in sedimentary deposits and petroleum deposits has long been of interest. Studies of ancient sediments and rock provide insights into the origins and sources of oil and petroleum, as well as the biochemical antecedents of life. Oil spills in particular have been of interest to geochemists in regards to the impact of petroleum and oil on the current geological environment. Following the Exxon Valdez Oil Spill, organic geochemistry knowledge on oil-spill chemistry bloomed with the analyses of samples from the spill.

Geochemists study petroleum-inclusions in geological samples to compare present-day fluid-inclusions to dated samples. This analysis provides insight into the age of the petroleum samples and the surrounding rock. Spectrographic, optical, destructive, and nondestructive methods are used to analyze samples via mass spectrometry or Raman spectroscopy. The discovered differences in samples, such as oil-to-gas ratio or viscosity are typically attributed to the rock source of the sample. Other characteristics typically noted are pressure/volume/temperature properties, sample texture, and sample composition. Complications in analysis arise when the source rock is near or in a water source.
Petroleum is also studied via carbon isotope analysis. Carbon isotopes provide insight into the Earth&#x27;s carbon cycle and geological processes. Geochemists are able to discern the composition of petroleum deposits by examining the ratio of carbon isotopes and comparing this ratio to known values for carbon based structures of which the petroleum could be composed.

====Coal====
Vast knowledge about coal has been attained since the inception of its use as an energy source. However, modern geochemists are still studying how plant material changes into coal. They have determined coalification results from a selective degradation of plant materials, while other plant material is preserved. Coal macromolecules are usually made up of these degradation-resistant biopolymers contained in algae, spores, and wood. Geochemists have unraveled the mysteries behind coal formation by comparing properties of the biopolymers to properties found in existing coal macromolecules. The analytical methods of Carbon NMR and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) combined with flash pyrolysis has greatly enhanced the ability of organic geochemists to analyse the minute structural units of coal. 

Further knowledge into the age of coal sediments has been attained via isochron dating of uranium in the coalified samples. Examination of the parent to daughter ratio of uranium isotopes has led to the dating of select samples to the Late Cretaceous Period. 

===Environmental===
Modern organic geochemistry includes studies of recent sediments to understand the carbon cycle, climate change, and ocean processes. In connection with petroleum studies, petroleum-focused geochemists also examine the impact of petroleum on the geological environment. Geochemistry also examines other pollutants in geological systems, such as metabolites formed from the degradation of hydrocarbons. Organic geochemistry analytical techniques, such as GC-MS, allow chemists to determine the intricate effects of organic metabolites and human-derived waste products on the geological environment. 
Of specific concern are the human-derived pollutants stemming from agricultural work. The use of animal manure, in combination with general municipal and sewage waste management, has changed many physical properties of the agricultural soil involved and the surrounding soils.

Organic geochemistry is also relevant to aqueous environments. Pollutants, their metabolites, and how both enter bodies of water are of particular importance in the field. This organic matter can also be derived from geological processes in or near bodies of water, similarly influencing nearby lifeforms and protein production. Fluorescence spectroscopy has been introduced as a technique to examine organic matter in bodies of water, as dissolved organic matter is typically fluorescent.
The study of organic geochemistry also extends to the atmosphere. Particularly, geochemists in this field study the makeup of insoluble material in the lower atmosphere. They have defined certain consequences of organic aerosols including physiological toxicity, direct and indirect climate forcing, smog, rain acidification, and incorporation into the natural carbon cycle.

<text>Impressment, colloquially &quot;the press&quot; or the &quot;press gang&quot;, is a type of conscription of people into a military force, especially a naval force, via intimidation and physical coercion, conducted by an organized group (hence &quot;gang&quot;). European navies of several nations used impressment by various means. The large size of the British Royal Navy in the Age of Sail meant impressment was most commonly associated with Great Britain and Ireland. It was used by the Royal Navy in wartime, beginning in 1664 and during the 18th and early 19th centuries as a means of crewing warships, although legal sanction for the practice can be traced back to the time of Edward I of England. The Royal Navy impressed many merchant sailors, as well as some sailors from other, mostly European, nations. People liable to impressment were &quot;eligible men of seafaring habits between the ages of 18 and 55 years&quot;. Non-seamen were sometimes impressed as well, though rarely. In addition to the Royal Navy&#x27;s use of impressment, the British Army also experimented with impressment from 1778 to 1780.

Impressment was strongly criticised by those who believed it to be contrary to the British constitution. Though the public opposed conscription in general, impressment was repeatedly upheld by the courts, as it was deemed vital to the strength of the navy and, by extension, to the survival of the British realm and influence.

Impressment was essentially a Royal Navy practice, reflecting the sheer size of the British fleet and its substantial manpower demands. While other European navies applied forced recruitment in times of war, this was generally done as an extension of the practice of formal conscription applied by most European armies from the Napoleonic Wars on.

The impressment of seamen from American ships caused serious tensions between Britain and the Thirteen Colonies in the years leading up to the Revolutionary War. One of the 27 colonial grievances enumerated in the Declaration of Independence directly highlights the practice. It was again a cause of tension leading up to the War of 1812. After the defeat of Napoleon in 1815, Britain formally ended the practice; later conscription was not limited to the Royal Navy but covered all British armed forces.

==Royal Navy recruiting and desertion==
Working and living conditions for the average sailor in the Royal Navy in the 18th century were very harsh by modern standards. Naval pay was attractive in the 1750s, but towards the end of the century its value had been steadily eroded by rising prices. Sailors&#x27; pay on merchant ships was somewhat higher during peacetime, and could increase to double naval pay during wartime.

Until 19th-century reforms improved conditions, the Royal Navy was additionally known to pay wages up to two years in arrears. The Navy always withheld six months&#x27; pay as a standard policy, in order to discourage desertion. Naval wages had been set in 1653, and were not increased until April 1797 after sailors on 80 ships of the Channel Fleet based at Spithead mutinied.

Despite this, there were still many volunteers for naval service.
The work for individual sailors was less than on merchant ships, since the naval crew size was determined by the number needed to man guns – around four times more than the number of crew needed to simply sail the ship. Furthermore, the food supplied by the Navy was plentiful, regular, and of good quality by the standards of the day. In the late 18th and early 19th centuries, it was not at all unusual for impressed men to view life in the navy, hard though it was, as still preferable to their previous lives on shore, and to volunteer for further service when the opportunity came to leave the ship. For major voyages, shipowners and governments routinely estimated that 50% of the sailors would die due to scurvy.

The main problem with naval recruitment was a shortage of qualified and experienced seamen during wartime; for example, when the Navy had to quickly recruit an extra 20,000 men in the early 18th century, and 40,000 men in the late 18th century. Privateers, the Royal Navy, and the Merchant Navy all competed for a small pool of ordinary and able seamen in wartime, and all three groups were usually short-handed. The recruitment figures presented to Parliament for the years 1755–1757 list 70,566 men, of whom 33,243 were volunteers (47%), 16,953 pressed men (24%), while another 20,370 were listed as volunteers separately (29%).

Although there are no records that explain why volunteers were separated into two groups, it is likely these were pressed men who became &quot;volunteers&quot; to get the sign-up bonus, two months&#x27; wages in advance and a higher wage. It is known that large numbers did this. Volunteering also protected the sailor from creditors, as the law forbade collecting debts accrued before enlistment. A disadvantage was that volunteers who deserted were liable to execution if captured, whereas pressed men were simply returned to service. Other records confirm similar percentages throughout the 18th century.

Average annual recruitment 1736–1783
All three groups also suffered high levels of desertion. In the 18th century, British desertion rates on naval ships averaged 25% annually, with slight difference between volunteers and pressed men. The rate of desertion started high, then fell heavily after a few months on board a ship, and generally became negligible after a year—because Navy pay ran months or years in arrears, desertion might mean not only abandoning companions in the ship&#x27;s company, but also the loss of a large amount of money already earned. If a naval ship had taken a prize, a deserting seaman would forfeit his share of the prize money. In a report on proposed changes to the RN written by Admiral Nelson in 1803, he noted that since 1793 more than 42,000 sailors had deserted.

==The Impress Service and impressment at sea==
The Impress Service, colloquially called the &quot;press-gang&quot;, was formed to force sailors to serve on naval vessels. There was no concept of &quot;joining the navy&quot; as a fixed career-path for non-officers at the time, since seamen remained attached to a ship only for the duration of its commission. They were encouraged to stay in the Navy after the commission but could leave to seek other employment when the ship was paid off. Impressment relied on the legal power of the King to call men to military service, as well as to recruit volunteers, who were paid a bounty upon joining, unlike pressed men. Seamen were not covered by Magna Carta and &quot;failure to allow oneself to be pressed&quot; was punishable by hanging, although the punishment became less severe over time.

In Elizabethan times a statute regulated impressment as a form of recruitment, and with the introduction of the Vagabonds Act 1597, men of disrepute (vagrants) found themselves drafted into service. In 1703, an act of Parliament passed limiting the impressment of boys under 18 years of age to those who were not apprenticed. A further act of Parliament in 1740 raised the maximum age to 55. Although no foreigner could normally be pressed, they lost their protection if they married a British woman or had worked on a British merchant ship for two years. Some governments, including Britain, issued &quot;protections&quot; against impressment that protected men had to carry on their person at all times, but in times of crisis the Admiralty would order a &quot;hot press&quot;, which meant that no-one remained exempt.

The Royal Navy also impressed seamen from inbound British merchant ships at sea, though this was done by individual warships, rather than by the Impress Service. Impressment, particularly &quot;press gangs&quot;, became consistently unpopular with the British public (as well as in the American colonies), and local officials often acted against them, to the point of imprisoning officers from the Impress Service or opposing them by force of arms.

==Basis==
At the time of the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805, over half the Royal Navy&#x27;s 120,000 sailors were pressed men. The power of the Impressment Service to conscript was limited by law to seafarers, including merchant seamen, longshoremen, collier crews and fishermen. There is little basis to the widespread impression that civilians without any seafaring background were randomly seized from home, country lane or workplace by press gangs or that the latter were employed inland away from coastal ports; notably Portsmouth, Plymouth, Harwich and Yarmouth.

However, convicted petty criminals were often given the option of volunteering for naval service as unskilled &quot;quota men&quot; by parish constables and inland courts (see below).


There were occasions when the local populace would band together to oppose the activities of the press where these exceeded legal bounds. One such incident, the Easton Massacre in 1803 (see caption at right), resulted in a press gang firing on a crowd, killing four people in the village of Easton on the Isle of Portland, where they were trying to impress the quarrymen. 

In 1808, Thomas Urquhart was saved from a press gang of three or four men when a London passersby intervened. Urquhart complained to local officials, identified at least one of the men involved and successfully sued for damages in the Court of King&#x27;s Bench. He went on to lobby for changes in law and practice, publishing &quot;Letters on the evils of impressment: with the outline of a plan for doing them away, on which depend the wealth, prosperity, and consequence of Great Britain&quot; in 1816.

Patrolling in or near sea ports, the press gang would try to find men aged between 15 and 55 with seafaring or river-boat experience, but this was not essential. Potential crewmen with no experience were called &quot;landsmen&quot;. From 1740, landsmen were legally exempt from impressment, but this was on occasion ignored in wartime unless the person seized was an apprentice or a &quot;gentleman&quot;. Two landsmen were considered by captains to be the equivalent of one able seaman. If a landsman was able to prove his status to the Admiralty he was usually released. Court records do, however, show fights breaking out as people attempted to avoid what was perceived as wrongful impressment, and the London &quot;Times&quot; reported occasions when press gangs instituted a &quot;hot press&quot; (ignoring protections against impressment) in order to man the navy.

Merchant seamen ashore from their ships (and usually conspicuous by their clothing, rolling stride, tattoos and generally weathered appearance) were however another matter. Anyone with seafaring experience encountered in the street would first be asked to volunteer for naval service. If the potential recruit refused he was often plied with alcohol or simply seized and taken. A commonly held belief is that a trick was used in taverns, surreptitiously dropping a King&#x27;s shilling (&quot;prest money&quot;) into a man&#x27;s drink, as by &quot;finding&quot; the shilling in his possession he was deemed to have volunteered, and that this led to some tavern owners putting glass bottoms in their tankards. However, this is a legend; press officers were subject to fines for using trickery and a volunteer had a &quot;cooling-off&quot; period in which to change his mind.

The great majority of men pressed were taken from merchant ships at sea, especially those homeward bound for Britain. This was legal as long as the Navy replaced the man they took, and many naval captains would take the best seamen, replacing them with malcontents and landsmen from their own ship. It was also common for &quot;trusted&quot; volunteers to act as substitutes; they would then desert as soon as the merchant ship docked, and return to their Navy ship.

Outbound merchant ships, officers and apprentices were exempt from impressment. When war broke out, the Navy would deploy frigates and vessels off the coast to intercept inbound merchantmen. Reportedly some merchant captains redirected their ships to Irish ports to offload favoured crewmen, before making final landfall in England. In 1740, a merchantman fired on a cruiser that was attempting to impress its crew; threats of similar violence to avoid sailors being pressed were supposedly not uncommon, especially with the East India ships whose crews had been away from their families and England for a considerable time. In times of an extreme shortage of men, the Navy would &quot;embargo&quot; the coast for a short time; merchantmen had to supply a portion of their crew in exchange for permission to sail. Many merchant ships had hiding places constructed where their best crew could hide when approached by a Naval vessel.

The owners of British whalers, because of the Press, often appointed a master to them whilst the vessels were in port in order to protect the whalers&#x27; crews. Otherwise the Press could take the men for naval service. The owners would then appoint an actual master to replace the placeholder masters.

In addition to impressment, Britain also used the Quota System (or &quot;The Quod&quot;) from 1795 to 1815, whereby each county was required to supply a certain number of volunteers, based on its population and the number of its seaports. Unlike impressment, the Quota System often resulted in criminals serving on board ships as counties who failed to meet their quota offered prisoners the option of completing their sentence or volunteering. Apart from the probably lower quality of recruits taken by this means, another downside of the Quota System was the frequent introduction of disease, especially typhus, to healthy ships.

==In Ireland==
Ireland formed a separate but subordinate state, the Kingdom of Ireland, between 1534 and 1800. All of Ireland was united to Great Britain to form the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland between 1801 and 1922. The Royal Navy recruited heavily in Ireland during these periods, including using impressment. For example, in 1734, impressment took place in Wicklow. Impressment was also common during the Napoleonic wars, although poverty in Ireland made sure that volunteers were usually available.

==British North America==

The Royal Navy also used impressment extensively in British North America from during the 18th and 19th centuries. Navy press gangs sparked resistance, riots, and political turmoil in seaports such as Halifax, St John&#x27;s, and Quebec City. One of the largest impressment operations occurred in the spring of 1757 in New York City, when 3,000 Royal Navy sailors under the command of Sir Charles Hardy entered the city and scoured the taverns and other sailors&#x27; gathering places. &quot;All kinds of tradesmen and Negroes&quot; were hauled in, nearly eight hundred in all. Four hundred were retained in the service

The Royal Navy extended the reach of its press gangs into coastal areas of British North America by the early 19th century. In response, sailors and residents fought back with a range of tactics. They sometimes reacted violently. The riots in St John&#x27;s in 1794 and Halifax in 1805 led to a prohibition on impressment on shore for much of the Napoleonic Wars. The protest came from a wide swath of the urban community, including elites, rather than just sailors, and had a lasting negative impact on civil–military relations in what became Canada. The local communities did not encourage their young men to volunteer for Royal Navy service.

==Continental Navy==
The American Continental Navy impressed men into its service during the American Revolutionary War. The Continental Congress authorized construction of thirteen frigates, including in 1775. The senior captain of the Continental Navy, James Nicholson, was appointed to command &quot;Virginia&quot;. When it was fitted out in 1777, Nicholson received orders to sail to Martinique. Many of Nicholson&#x27;s crew had deserted to sign on as privateers, for higher pay at less risk. Therefore, Nicholson impressed about thirty citizens of Baltimore, an act expressly forbidden by Maryland law. Maryland governor Thomas Johnson demanded immediate release of the impressed men and Congress convinced Nicholson to release them all. Nicholson avoided impressment on land and instead stopped two American merchant ships at sea in 1780, to impress men from their crews.

The individual states did not deny the concept of impressment for their own navies, but were reluctant to grant the right to the Continental Congress. The concept of drafting men into armed service remained contentious, even after adoption of the federal constitution.

There is one documented case of a British seaman impressed by the US Navy in 1810.

==Conflict with the United States==

In 1795, the Jay Treaty went into effect, addressing many issues left unresolved after the American Revolution, and averting a renewed conflict. However, the treaty&#x27;s neglect to address British impressment of sailors from American ships and ports became a major cause of complaint among those who disapproved of it. While non-British subjects were not impressed, at this point Britain did not recognize naturalised American citizenship and treated anyone born a British subject as still &quot;British&quot;; as a result, the Royal Navy impressed over 9,000 sailors who claimed to be American citizens.

During the wars with France (1793 to 1815), the Royal Navy aggressively reclaimed British deserters on board ships of other nations, both by halting and searching merchant ships, and, in many cases, by searching American port cities. Although these impressments violated American law, Jefferson ignored them so as to remain on good terms with Britain as he was negotiating to obtain Florida from the Spanish. This changed in 1805 when the Royal Navy began seizing American merchantmen violating British law by trading with the West Indies, condemning the ships and their cargoes as prizes and impressing their crews. Under the Rule of 1756, in times of war direct trade between a neutral state and a British colony was forbidden if such trade had not existed in time of peace. American merchants found a way around this policy by &quot;landing&quot; cargoes from Europe in the United States and issuing certificates that duty had been paid. The ship would then sail, with the cargo never having been offloaded or duty actually paid, as now bona fide commerce between neutral America and the West Indies. The British became aware of the practice during the court case involving the seizure of the &quot;Essex&quot;. The court ruled that the cargo of the &quot;Essex&quot; had never been intended for American markets, so the voyage had not been &quot;broken&quot; and could thus be considered continuous. The result was the blockade of New York Harbor by two British frigates, the &quot;Cambrian&quot; and the &quot;Leander&quot;, which provoked public demonstrations.

For the next year scores of American ships found violating the Rule of 1756 were condemned in admiralty courts and their crews were impressed with increasing frequency until, in the early summer of 1807, when three deserters from the British frigate lying in Chesapeake Bay enlisted on the American frigate . After searching &quot;Chesapeake&quot;, the deserters, David Martin, John Strachan, and William Ware, were found to be native-born Americans who had been wrongly impressed. The search also established that another crew member, listed as Jenkin Ratford, was actually a British deserter; however, he could not be found. Admiral Berkeley issued an order to all commanders in the North Atlantic Squadron to search &quot;Chesapeake&quot; if encountered on the high seas. Eight miles southeast of Cape Henry a boat from the British frigate intercepted her but Commodore James Barron declined to permit his crew to be mustered. &quot;Leopard&quot; began approaching and the commander shouted a warning to which Barron replied &quot;I don&#x27;t hear what you say&quot;. &quot;Leopard&quot; then fired two shots across the bow and almost immediately poured a broadside into &quot;Chesapeake&quot;. The &quot;Chesapeake&quot; did not return fire but &quot;Leopard&quot; fired another two broadsides; three sailors onboard &quot;Chesapeake&quot; were killed and eighteen were wounded. The boarding party from &quot;Leopard&quot; arrested Martin, Strachan, Ware and Ratford. The &quot;Chesapeake&quot;–&quot;Leopard&quot; affair provoked an outcry for war from all parts of the United States and Jefferson later wrote: &quot;The affair of the &quot;Chesapeake&quot; put war into my hand, I had only to open it and let havoc loose&quot;. He ordered the state governors to ready their militias, but the Embargo Act of 1807 that he eventually passed only ordered all British armed vessels out of American waters and forbade all contact with them if they remained.

As a cause of the War of 1812, the impressment and ship seizures caused serious diplomatic tension, and helped to turn American public opinion against Britain. Impressment was widely perceived as humiliating and dishonoring the U.S. because it was unable to protect its ships and sailors.

==End of impressment==
Britain fought the war against Napoleon on the high seas, enlarging its Royal Navy from 135 ships in 1793 to 584 in 1812, and expanding personnel from 36,000 seamen in 1793 to 114,000 in 1812. In spring 1814 Napoleon surrendered, the allies restored the Bourbon kings to the throne, and France was no longer an enemy of Great Britain. The naval war was over and Britain could now sharply reduce its Royal Navy. It had no need to impress sailors, and never again used that means of forced recruitment, although it did not officially renounce the practice. By the time of Britain&#x27;s next major war, against Russia in 1853, a new system of fixed-term engagements had given the Royal Navy a sufficient number of volunteer recruits to meet its manpower needs. Throughout the remainder of the 19th century changes in manpower needs and improved conditions of service permitted the Royal Navy to rely on voluntary enlistment to meet its requirements, augmented by the recall of reservists when necessary. This continued to be the case until World War I, when organised conscription was introduced in 1916 for all the military services.

==English and later British naval impressment laws==

The first act of Parliament legalising this practice was passed in the reign of Queen Elizabeth in 1563 and was known as &quot;An Act touching political considerations for the maintenance of the navy&quot;. It was renewed many times until 1631. In the Vagabonds Act 1597, several lists of persons were subject to impressment for service in the fleet. Following the execution of King Charles I, the Rump Parliament passed several acts in 1649 and 1650 concerning the encouragement of officers, mariners and for the impressment of seamen (e.g. 22 February 1648/9). In 1695, an act of Parliament was passed to build a permanent register of 30,000 men for ready call-up by the navy, &quot;without having recourse to the barbarous and unconstitutional practice of pressing&quot;. The act also established basic rules and benefits for all types of seamen, including access to Greenwich Hospital.

With wars raging in Europe and in America the Navigation Act 1703 (2 &amp; 3 Ann. c. 6) was passed &quot;for the of Seamen and better Encouragement of Navigation, and the Protection of the Coal Trade&quot;. This act gave parish authorities the power to indenture and apprentice boys to the sea, from as young as 10, until age 21; it also reaffirmed that rogues and vagabonds were subject to be pressed into the navy. The act establishes administration and regulations for the act, including youth who volunteer for the indenture and certain seamen engaged in the coal trade supplying cities, are exempt from impressment for three years. This act was followed by the Recruiting Act 1703 (2 &amp; 3 Ann. c. 13), which allows impressing able-bodied men into the army and navy who did not have visible means of subsistence; also as a wartime measure the act relaxes English crewing requirements under the Navigation Acts, to make experienced English seamen more available to serve on ships of war. In 1740, impressment was limited to men between 18 and 45, and it also exempted foreigners.

As part of a wider effort to build colonial capability and harass its enemies, Parliament passed the Trade to America Act 1707 (6 Ann. c. 64). Section 9 mandated that mariners serving on board privateers and trading ships in any part of America, and those on shore, are not liable for impressment. Lingering questions remained whether the law applied only to the navy, or to civil authorities as well, and whether it applied only to the current war or to all future wars. Two attorneys-general of Great Britain, one in 1716, and another in 1740, issued opinions that the 1707 act was no longer in effect, but many American colonists disagreed.

Despite doubts over the continuing legality of impressment in continental waters, but for similar reasons, Parliament passed the Sugar Trade Act 1746 (19 Geo. 2. c. 30) stating that impressment was forbidden in the West Indies, but it added certain exceptions and made no specific mention of America. This would lead to the Knowles Riot in Boston the following year, and continuing colonial questions, particularly in heavily maritime New England.

The last law was passed in 1835, in which the power to impress was reaffirmed. This limited the length of service of a pressed man to five years, and added the provision that a man could not be pressed twice. Although Britain abandoned the practice of impressment in 1815, impressment remained legal until the early 1900s, and the various laws authorising impressment have never been repealed.

==British army impressment laws==

Starting in 1645, the New Model Army raised by Oliver Cromwell to overthrow Charles I during the English Civil War was largely manned by impressment. After the restoration of the monarchy, impressment into the army was discontinued.

During the American Revolutionary War, after the losses at the Battle of Saratoga and the impending hostilities with France, the existing voluntary enlistment measures were judged to be insufficient. Between 1775 and 1781, the regular army increased from 48,000 to 110,000. Two acts were passed, the Recruiting Act 1778 and the Recruiting Act 1779, for the impression of individuals into the British Army. The chief advantages of these acts was in the number of volunteers brought in under the apprehension of impressment. To avoid impressment, some recruits incapacitated themselves by cutting off the thumb and forefinger of the right hand, making it impossible to use a musket or sword. The Recruiting Act of 1779 was repealed on 26 May 1780, and army impressment was permanently discontinued.

During the experiment, the British government allowed army impressment under severely restricted circumstances — both acts emphasized volunteering over impressment, and offered strong incentives to volunteers as a &quot;carrot and stick&quot; tactic, to encourage the men to volunteer lest they be pressed instead. The impressment portion of the 1778 Act applied only to Scotland and the area around London, excluding Wales and the rest of England, to avoid interfering with harvesting. The 1779 Act applied to all of Great Britain, but was initially suspended everywhere except the area around London, and actually applied to all of Great Britain for only six months, until the 1779 act was repealed in May 1780, and army impressment ceased in Britain.

Unlike naval impressment, army impressment applied only to &quot;able-bodied idle, and disorderly Persons, who could not, upon Examination, prove themselves to exercise and industriously follow some lawful Trade or Employment, or to have some Substance sufficient for their Support and Maintenance&quot;, as well as smugglers, according to the 1778 law, but excluding from that any men who were voters, or harvest workers. The 1779 law extended impressment also to &quot;incorrigible rogues&quot; who had abandoned their families, and left them as expenses on the parish. Impressed apprentices were released under appeal from their masters, and impressed foreigners were released when requested by their countries&#x27; embassies.

==In popular culture==
Literature
*&quot;Poor Jack&quot; (1840) by Frederick Marryat, features a scene in which a press-gang board a merchantman and collar a young sailor below decks. When brought on deck he finds he has been impressed by his own brother.
*The events in Elizabeth Gaskell&#x27;s novel &quot;Sylvia&#x27;s Lovers&quot; (1863) take place against the background of the practice of impressment during the early phases of the Napoleonic Wars. Charlie Kinraid is forcibly enlisted in the Royal Navy by a press gang and later Sylvia Robson&#x27;s father is executed for leading a revengeful raid on press-gang collaborators.
*In Herman Melville&#x27;s novel &quot;Billy Budd, Sailor&quot;, first published in 1924, and in the opera and film based on it, Billy is impressed to service on a British warship from the &quot;Rights-of-Man&quot;, a merchant ship.
* In &quot;A Ship of the Line&quot; by C. S. Forester, Captain Horatio Hornblower is depicted, when urgently needing sailors to make up his crew, as stopping a ship of the British East India Company and impressing a large part of its sailors – the sailors being very reluctant, since conditions in the Royal navy ships were far worse than in those of the civilian Company.
*In China Miéville&#x27;s 2002 novel &quot;The Scar&quot;, many members of The Armada society are pressganged from various ships to live on the floating colony. Miéville favours the word &quot;pressganged&quot; and has used it in numerous works of fiction to refer to people compelled to join some organisation or faction against their wills for political purposes.
Poetry
* Elizabeth Barrett Browning&#x27;s first published poem, &quot;On the Cruelty of Forcement to Man&quot; (c. 1812, when she was six years old), addressed impressment.

<doc id="456212" wikidata="Q1492262" url="?curid=456212" title="Gallarus Oratory">
<text>The Gallarus Oratory () is a chapel on the Dingle Peninsula, County Kerry, Ireland. It has been presented variously as an early-Christian stone church by antiquary Charles Smith, in 1756; a 12th-century Romanesque church by archaeologist Peter Harbison in 1970; a shelter for pilgrims by the same in 1994. The local tradition prevalent at the time of Charles Smith attributed it to one Griffith More, being a funerary chapel built by him or his family at their burial place.

The oratory overlooks the harbour at Ard na Caithne (formerly also called Smerwick) on the Dingle Peninsula. Saints road (&quot;Cosán na Naomh&quot;), an old pilgrimage road less than 300 metres away, leads to the summit of Mount Brandon, which can be seen in the background of the oratory.

== Name ==
There exist several interpretations as to the origin and meaning of the placename &quot;Gallarus&quot;. Archaeologist Peter Harbison ventures the meaning to be something like &#x27;the house or shelter for foreigner(s)&#x27; (&quot;Gall Aras&quot;), the said foreigners being possibly &quot;these pilgrims that have come from outside the Peninsula.&quot;

However, according to lexicologist Pádraig Ó Siochfhradha (aka &quot;An Seabhac&quot;), the name does not refer to a foreign settlement but to a rocky headland (&quot;Gall-iorrus&quot;).

== Discovery ==
As the oratory is the only intact specimen of its type, it has attracted considerable attention, starting from antiquarians in the mid-18th century. The first account we have of the oratory is Charles Smith&#x27;s description of 1756 in &quot;The Antient and Present State of the County of Kerry (Dublin)&quot;, p. 191.

== Architecture ==
=== Masonry ===
The oratory is built of large cut stones from the Dingle Beds of the Upper Silurian Old Red Sandstone. Charles Smith, who discovered the edifice in 1756, described the stone as &quot;a brown free-stone, brought from the cliffs of the sea shore, which cuts readily and is very durable.&quot;

The stones are cut on every side and end so as to fit perfectly together. They exhibit smoothly finished outside facings that follow the slant of the wall.

The edifice is usually thought to be of dry-stone walling - built without mortar as a structural medium, but there is evidence that even if mortar &quot;was never visible in the wall facings it was used as a structural medium for the interior of the wall at least.&quot; A thin layer of lime mortar is used to bond the stones together and to fill in small hollows in the inner faces.

=== Morphology ===
The oratory’s shape has been compared to that of an upturned boat because of its sloping side walls. The edifice uses corbel vaulting. The stones are positioned on each course with their edges projecting inward by a small increment as the walls rise. Besides, they are laid at a slight angle, lower on the outside than on the inside, thus allowing rainwater to run off. Both techniques can still be seen in the modern agricultural clocháns of the Dingle peninsula.

The edifice has two side walls and two end walls, sloping and converging at the top, each of one piece, playing a dual role as load-bearing wall and corbelled half-vault. The walls are 4 feet (1.20m) thick at the lowest point of the building. Some slight sagging has occurred across the length of the northern roof slope.

The interior room is approximately by , a size that befits more an oratory or a small chapel than a church.

It is dimly lit, with only a tiny round-headed window in the east wall, opposite the entrance door. The window splays more widely towards the inside of the wall.

The doorway is 1.67 m (5.5 ft) high. It has a flat lintel. On the inside over the lintel, two holed stones project out from the wall, possibly for the attachment of a wooden door.

== Interpretations as to dates and uses ==
Antiquarian Charles Smith is the originator of the claim that the building is an early Irish stone church although no historical information is available prior to 1756 regarding its use.

In 1970, archaeologist Peter Harbison argued that the oratory might have been built as late as the 12th century for a number of reasons, mainly because the east window has a rounded top made of two carved stones (not a true arch).

Harbison produced some evidence pointing to a later date and a different use: a letter by English traveller Richard Pococke who visited the oratory in 1758, two years after it was discovered by Charles Smith: &quot;Near this building they show a grave with a head at the cross of it and call it the tomb of the Giant; the tradition is that Griffith More was buried there, &amp; as they call&#x27;d [it] a chapel, so probably it was built by him or his family at their burial place.&quot;

In 1994 and 1995, Harbison gave up the hypothesis of a 12th-century church and claimed that the placename Gallarus meant &#x27;the house or shelter of foreigner(s)&#x27; (&quot;Gall Aras&quot;), the said &quot;foreigner(s)&quot; being pilgrims from outside the peninsula. However, this does not accord with lexicologist Pádraig Ó Siochfhradha&#x27;s translation of the name as &quot;rocky headland&quot; (&quot;Gall-iorrus&quot;).

== Archaeological evidence ==
Minor trial cuttings carried out at Gallarus in November 1970 yielded no finds or evidence of features or activity which might shed light on the period of construction and use of the oratory.

<text>William Egan Colby (January 4, 1920 – May 6, 1996) was an American intelligence officer who served as Director of Central Intelligence (DCI) from September 1973 to January 1976.

During World War II, Colby served with the Office of Strategic Services. After the war, he joined the newly created Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). Before and during the Vietnam War, Colby served as chief of station in Saigon, chief of the CIA&#x27;s Far East Division, and head of the Civil Operations and Rural Development effort and oversaw the Phoenix Program. After the war, Colby became Director of Central Intelligence (DCI) and during his tenure, under intense pressure from the Congress and the media, adopted a policy of relative openness about U.S. intelligence activities to the Senate Church Committee and the House Pike Committee. Colby served as DCI under Presidents Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford until January 30, 1976 and was succeeded at the CIA by George H. W. Bush.

==Early life and family==
Colby was born in Saint Paul, Minnesota, in 1920. His father, Elbridge Colby, who came from a New England family with a history of military and public service, was a professor of English, an author, and a military officer who served in the U.S. Army and in university positions in Tianjin, China; Georgia; Vermont; and Washington, D.C. Though a career officer, Elbridge Colby&#x27;s professional pursuits focused less on strictly military activities and more on intellectual and scholarly contributions to military and literary subjects. Elbridge&#x27;s father, Charles Colby, had been a professor of chemistry at Columbia University but had died prematurely and left his family largely without money.

Colby&#x27;s mother, Margaret Egan, was from an Irish family in St. Paul active in business and Democratic politics. With his Army father, William Colby had a peripatetic upbringing before attending public high school in Burlington, Vermont. He then attended Princeton University and graduated with an A.B. in politics in 1940 after completing a 196-page long senior thesis, &quot;Surrender – French Policy toward the Spanish Civil War,&quot; in which he sharply criticized France for failing to support for Second Spanish Republic in the civil war. He then studied at Columbia Law School the following year. Colby recounted that he took from his parents a desire to serve and a commitment to liberal politics, Catholicism, and independence, exemplified by his father&#x27;s career-damaging protest in &quot;The Nation&quot; magazine regarding the lenient treatment of a white Georgian who had murdered a black U.S. soldier who was also based at Fort Benning.

Colby was for his entire life a staunch Roman Catholic. He was often referred to as &quot;the warrior–priest.&quot; The Catholic Church played a &quot;central role&quot; in his family&#x27;s life, with Colby&#x27;s two daughters receiving their First Communion at St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica.

He married Barbara Heinzen (1920–2015) in 1945 and they had five children. His daughter, Christine, was presented as a debutante to high society in 1978 at the International Debutante Ball at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York City. In 1984, he divorced Barbara and married the Democratic diplomat Sally Shelton-Colby.

==Career==
===Office of Strategic Services===

Following his first year at Columbia, in 1941 Colby volunteered for active duty with the United States Army and served with the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) as a &quot;Jedburgh,&quot; or special operator, who was trained to work with resistance forces in occupied Europe to harass German and other Axis forces. During World War II, he parachuted behind enemy lines twice and earned the Silver Star as well as commendations from Norway, France, and Great Britain. In his first mission he deployed to France as a Jedburgh commanding Team BRUCE, in mid-August 1944, and operated with the Maquis until he joined up with Allied forces later that fall. In April 1945, he led the NORSO Group Operasjon Rype into Norway on a sabotage mission to destroy railway lines in an effort to hinder German forces in Norway from reinforcing the final defense of Germany.

After the war, Colby graduated from Columbia Law School and then briefly practiced law in William J. Donovan&#x27;s New York firm, Donovan, Leisure, Newton &amp; Irvine. Bored by the practice of law and inspired by his liberal beliefs, he moved to Washington to work for the National Labor Relations Board.

===Central Intelligence Agency===
====Post-war Europe====

Then, an OSS friend offered him a job at the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), and he accepted. Colby spent the next 12 years in the field, first in Stockholm, Sweden. There, he helped set up the stay-behind networks of Operation Gladio, a covert paramilitary organization organized by the CIA to make any Soviet occupation more difficult, as he later described in his memoirs.

Colby then spent much of the 1950s based in Rome under the cover as a State Department officer, where he led the Agency&#x27;s covert political operations campaign to support anti-communist parties in their electoral contests against left wing Soviet–associated parties. The Christian Democrats and allied parties won several key elections in the 1950s, preventing a takeover by the Communist Party. Colby was a vocal advocate within the CIA and the United States government for engaging the non-Communist left wing parties in order to create broader non-Communist coalitions capable of governing fractious Italy. That position first brought him into conflict with James J. Angleton.

====Southeast Asia====
In 1959 Colby became the CIA&#x27;s deputy chief and then chief of station in Saigon, South Vietnam, where he served until 1962. Tasked by CIA with supporting the government of South Vietnamese President Ngô Đình Diệm, Colby established a relationship with Diem&#x27;s family and with Ngô Đình Nhu, the president&#x27;s brother, with whom Colby became close. While in Vietnam, Colby focused intensively on building up Vietnamese capabilities to combat the Viet Cong insurgency in the countryside. He argued that &quot;the key to the war in Vietnam was the war in the villages.&quot; In 1962, he returned to Washington to become the deputy and then chief of CIA&#x27;s Far East Division, succeeding Desmond Fitzgerald, who had been tapped to lead the Agency&#x27;s efforts against Fidel Castro&#x27;s Cuba. During those years, Colby was deeply involved in Washington&#x27;s policies in East Asia, particularly with respect to Vietnam, as well as Indonesia, Japan, Korea, and China. He was deeply critical of the decision to abandon support for Diem, and he believed that played a material part in the weakening of the South Vietnamese position in the following years.

In 1968, while Colby was preparing to take up the post of chief of the Soviet Bloc Division of the Agency, U.S. President Lyndon Johnson instead sent Colby back to Vietnam as deputy to Robert Komer, who had been charged with streamlining the civilian side of the American and South Vietnamese efforts against the Communists. Shortly after arriving Colby succeeded Komer as head of the U.S./South Vietnamese rural pacification effort named CORDS. Part of the effort was the controversial Phoenix Program, an initiative designed to identify and attack the &quot;Viet Cong Infrastructure.&quot; There is considerable debate about the merits of the program, which was subject to allegations that it relied on or was complicit in assassination and torture. Colby, however, consistently insisted that such tactics were not authorized by or permitted in the program.

More broadly, along with Ambassador Ellsworth Bunker and Military Assistance Command, Vietnam (MACV) commander General Creighton Abrams, Colby was part of a leadership group that worked to apply a new approach to the war designed to focus more on pacification (winning hearts and minds) and securing the countryside, as opposed to the &quot;search and destroy&quot; approach that had characterized General William Westmoreland&#x27;s tenure as MACV commander. Some, including Colby later in life, argue that approach succeeded in reducing the Communist insurgency in South Vietnam, but that South Vietnam, without air and ground support by the United States after the 1973 Paris Peace Accords, was ultimately overwhelmed by a conventional North Vietnamese assault in 1975. The CORDS model and its approach influenced U.S. strategy and thinking on counterinsurgency in the 2000s in Iraq and Afghanistan.

====CIA HQ: Director====

Colby returned to Washington in July 1971 and became executive director of CIA. After long-time DCI Richard Helms was dismissed by President Nixon in 1973, James Schlesinger assumed the helm at the Agency. A strong believer in reform of the CIA and the intelligence community more broadly, Schlesinger had written a 1971 Bureau of the Budget report outlining his views on the subject. Colby, who had had a somewhat unorthodox career in the CIA focused on political action and counterinsurgency, agreed with Schlesinger&#x27;s reformist approach. Schlesinger appointed him head of the clandestine branch in early 1973. When Nixon reshuffled his agency heads and made Schlesinger secretary of defense, Colby emerged as a natural candidate for DCI, apparently on the basis of the recommendation that he was a professional who would not make waves. Colby was known as a media-friendly CIA director. His tenure as DCI, which lasted two-and-a-half tumultuous years, was overshadowed by the Church and Pike congressional investigations into alleged US intelligence malfeasance over the preceding 25 years, including 1975, the so-called Year of Intelligence.

Colby&#x27;s time as DCI was also eventful on the world stage. Shortly after he assumed leadership, the Yom Kippur War broke out, an event that surprised the American intelligence agencies but also those of Israel. The intelligence surprise reportedly affected Colby&#x27;s credibility with the Nixon administration. Colby participated in the National Security Council meetings that responded to apparent Soviet intentions to intervene in the war by raising the alert level of U.S. forces to DEFCON 3 and defusing the crisis. In 1975, after many years of involvement, South Vietnam fell to Communist forces in April 1975, a particularly difficult blow for Colby, who had dedicated so much of his life and career to the American effort there. Events in the arms-control field, Angola, Australia, the Middle East, and elsewhere also demanded attention.

Colby also focused on internal reforms within the CIA and the intelligence community. He attempted to modernize what he believed to be some out-of-date structures and practices by disbanding the Board of National Estimates and replacing it with the National Intelligence Council. In a speech from 1973 addressed to NSA employees, he emphasized the role of free speech in the U.S. and 
the moral role of CIA as a defender, not a preventer, of civil rights, an attempt to rebut the then emerging revelations of CIA and NSA domestic spying. He also mentioned a number of reforms intended to limit excessive classification of governmental information.

President Gerald Ford, advised by Henry Kissinger and others concerned by Colby&#x27;s controversial openness to Congress and distance from the White House, replaced Colby late in 1975 with George H. W. Bush during the so-called Halloween Massacre in which Secretary of Defense Schlesinger was also replaced (by Donald Rumsfeld). Colby was offered the position of United States Permanent Representative to NATO but turned it down.

===Later career===

In 1977 Colby founded a D.C. law firm, Colby, Miller &amp; Hanes, with Marshall Miller, David Hanes, and associated lawyers, and worked on public policy issues. In consonance with his long-held liberal views, Colby became a supporter of the nuclear freeze and of reductions in military spending. He practiced law and advised various bodies on intelligence matters.

During that period, he also wrote two books, both of which were memoirs of his professional life, combined with discussions of history and policy. One was titled &quot;Honorable Men: My Life in the CIA&quot;; the other, on Vietnam and his long involvement with American policy there, was called &quot;Lost Victory&quot;. In the latter book, Colby argued that the U.S.–South Vietnamese counterinsurgency campaign in Vietnam had succeeded by the early 1970s and that South Vietnam could have survived if the U.S. had continued to provide support after the Paris Accords. The topic remains open and controversial, but some recent scholarship, including by Lewis &quot;Bob&quot; Sorley, supports Colby&#x27;s arguments.

Colby also lent his expertise and knowledge, along with Oleg Kalugin, to the Activision game &quot;&quot;, which was released shortly before his death. Both Colby and Kalugin played themselves in the game.

Colby was a member of the National Coalition to Ban Handguns. His name appears on a note to Senator John Heinz dated July 5, 1989, as a &quot;National Sponsor.&quot;

At the time of the Senate hearings to confirm his appointment, Colby was relentlessly grilled about The Family Jewels, a secret 693-page report ordered by Schlesinger, directed by Colby, and compiled by CIA&#x27;s own Inspector General&#x27;s Office. It dealt with what Colby calls &quot;some mistakes,&quot; specifically CIA abuses ranging from assassination plans to dosing people with mind-control drugs to domestic spying.

==Death==
On April 27, 1996, Colby set out from his weekend home in Rock Point, Maryland, on a solo canoe trip. His canoe was found the following day on a sandbar in the Wicomico River, a tributary of the Potomac, about from his home. On May 6, Colby&#x27;s body was found in a marshy riverbank lying face down not far from where his canoe was found. After an autopsy, Maryland&#x27;s Chief Medical Examiner John E. Smialek ruled his death to be accidental. Smialek&#x27;s report said that Colby was predisposed to having a heart attack or stroke from &quot;severe calcified atherosclerosis&quot; and that Colby likely &quot;suffered a complication of this atherosclerosis which precipitated him into the cold water in a debilitated state and he succumbed to the effects of hypothermia and drowned.&quot;

Colby&#x27;s death triggered conspiracy theories that his death had been caused by . 

In his 2011 documentary &quot;The Man Nobody Knew&quot;, Colby&#x27;s son Carl suggested that his father suffered from guilt over his failings as a father to one of his daughters and so committed suicide. Carl&#x27;s step-mother and siblings, as well as Colby&#x27;s biographer Randall Woods, criticized Carl&#x27;s portrayal of Colby and rejected the allegation that the former CIA director killed himself and said that it was inconsistent with his character.

==Legacy==
Colby was the subject of a biography, &quot;Lost Crusader&quot;, by John Prados, published in 2003. His son, Carl Colby, released a documentary on his father&#x27;s professional and personal life, &quot;The Man Nobody Knew&quot;, in 2011. In May 2013, Randall B. Woods, Distinguished Professor of History at the J. William Fulbright School at the University of Arkansas, published his biography of Colby, titled &quot;Shadow Warrior: William Egan Colby and the CIA&quot;.
Norwich University hosts an annual writers symposium named in his honor.

His grandson, Elbridge A. Colby, served as Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Strategy and Force Planning from 2017 to 2018 and is a co-founder of the Marathon Institute.

<doc id="456234" wikidata="Q28784" url="?curid=456234" title="Colligative properties">
<text>In chemistry, colligative properties are those properties of solutions that depend on the ratio of the number of solute particles to the number of solvent particles in a solution, and not on the nature of the chemical species present. The number ratio can be related to the various units for concentration of a solution such as molarity, molality, normality (chemistry), etc. The assumption that solution properties are independent of nature of solute particles is exact only for ideal solutions, which are solutions that exhibit thermodynamic properties analogous to those of an ideal gas, and is approximate for dilute real solutions. In other words, colligative properties are a set of solution properties that can be reasonably approximated by the assumption that the solution is ideal. 

Only properties which result from the dissolution of a nonvolatile solute in a volatile liquid solvent are considered. They are essentially solvent properties which are changed by the presence of the solute. The solute particles displace some solvent molecules in the liquid phase and thereby reduce the concentration of solvent and increase its entropy, so that the colligative properties are independent of the nature of the solute. The word colligative is derived from the Latin &quot;colligatus&quot; meaning &quot;bound together&quot;. This indicates that all colligative properties have a common feature, namely that they are related only to the number of solute molecules relative to the number of solvent molecules and not to the nature of the solute.

Colligative properties include: 
* Relative lowering of vapor pressure (Raoult&#x27;s law)
* Elevation of boiling point
* Depression of freezing point
* Osmotic pressure
For a given solute-solvent mass ratio, all colligative properties are inversely proportional to solute molar mass.

Measurement of colligative properties for a dilute solution of a non-ionized solute such as urea or glucose in water or another solvent can lead to determinations of relative molar masses, both for small molecules and for polymers which cannot be studied by other means. Alternatively, measurements for ionized solutes can lead to an estimation of the percentage of dissociation taking place.

Colligative properties are studied mostly for dilute solutions, whose behavior may be approximated as that of an ideal solution. In fact, all of the properties listed above are colligative only in the dilute limit: at higher concentrations, the freezing point depression, boiling point elevation, vapor pressure elevation or depression, and osmotic pressure are all dependent on the chemical nature of the solvent and the solute.

==Relative lowering of vapor pressure==
A vapor is a substance in a gaseous state at a temperature lower than its critical point. Vapor Pressure is the pressure exerted by a vapor in thermodynamic equilibrium with its solid or liquid state. The vapor pressure of a solvent is lowered when a non-volatile solute is dissolved in it to form a solution.

For an ideal solution, the equilibrium vapor pressure is given by Raoult&#x27;s law as
formula_1
where formula_2 is the vapor pressure of the &quot;pure&quot; component (i= A, B, ...) and formula_3 is the mole fraction of the component in the solution.

For a solution with a solvent (A) and one non-volatile solute (B), formula_4 and formula_5.

The vapor pressure &quot;lowering&quot; relative to pure solvent is formula_6, which is proportional to the mole fraction of solute.

If the solute dissociates in solution, then the number of moles of solute is increased by the van &#x27;t Hoff factor formula_7, which represents the true number of solute particles for each formula unit. For example, the strong electrolyte MgCl2 dissociates into one Mg2+ ion and two Cl− ions, so that if ionization is complete, i = 3 and formula_8, where formula_9 is calculated with moles of solute i times initial moles and moles of solvent same as initial moles of solvent before dissociation. The measured colligative properties show that &quot;i&quot; is somewhat less than 3 due to ion association.

== Boiling point and freezing point ==

Addition of solute to form a solution stabilizes the solvent in the liquid phase, and lowers the solvent&#x27;s chemical potential so that solvent molecules have less tendency to move to the gas or solid phases. As a result, liquid solutions slightly above the solvent boiling point at a given pressure become stable, which means that the boiling point increases. Similarly, liquid solutions slightly below the solvent freezing point become stable meaning that the freezing point decreases. Both the boiling point elevation and the freezing point depression are proportional to the lowering of vapor pressure in a dilute solution.

These properties are colligative in systems where the solute is essentially confined to the liquid phase. Boiling point elevation (like vapor pressure lowering) is colligative for non-volatile solutes where the solute presence in the gas phase is negligible. Freezing point depression is colligative for most solutes since very few solutes dissolve appreciably in solid solvents.

=== Boiling point elevation (ebullioscopy) ===

The boiling point of a liquid at a given external pressure is the temperature (formula_10) at which the vapor pressure of the liquid equals the external pressure. The &quot;normal boiling point&quot; is the boiling point at a pressure equal to 1 atm.

The boiling point of a pure solvent is increased by the addition of a non-volatile solute, and the elevation can be measured by ebullioscopy. It is found that 
:formula_11 

Here &quot;i&quot; is the van &#x27;t Hoff factor as above, &quot;K&quot;b is the ebullioscopic constant of the solvent (equal to 0.512 °C kg/mol for water), and &quot;m&quot; is the molality of the solution.

The boiling point is the temperature at which there is equilibrium between liquid and gas phases. At the boiling point, the number of gas molecules condensing to liquid equals the number of liquid molecules evaporating to gas. Adding a solute dilutes the concentration of the liquid molecules and reduces the rate of evaporation. To compensate for this and re-attain equilibrium, the boiling point occurs at a higher temperature.

If the solution is assumed to be an ideal solution, &quot;K&quot;b can be evaluated from the thermodynamic condition for liquid-vapor equilibrium. At the boiling point, the chemical potential μA of the solvent in the solution phase equals the chemical potential in the pure vapor phase above the solution.

:formula_12

The asterisks indicate pure phases. This leads to the result formula_13, where R is the molar gas constant, M is the solvent molar mass and Δ&quot;H&quot;vap is the solvent molar enthalpy of vaporization.

=== Freezing point depression (cryoscopy)===

The freezing point (formula_14) of a pure solvent is lowered by the addition of a solute which is insoluble in the solid solvent, and the measurement of this difference is called &quot;cryoscopy&quot;. It is found that 
:formula_15 (which can also be written as formula_16)

Here &quot;Kf&quot; is the cryoscopic constant (equal to 1.86 °C kg/mol for the freezing point of water), &quot;i&quot; is the van &#x27;t Hoff factor, and &quot;m&quot; the molality (in mol/kg). This predicts the melting of ice by road salt.

In the liquid solution, the solvent is diluted by the addition of a solute, so that fewer molecules are available to freeze. Re-establishment of equilibrium is achieved at a lower temperature at which the rate of freezing becomes equal to the rate of liquefying. At the lower freezing point, the vapor pressure of the liquid is equal to the vapor pressure of the corresponding solid, and the chemical potentials of the two phases are equal as well. The equality of chemical potentials permits the evaluation of the cryoscopic constant as formula_17, where Δfus&quot;H&quot; is the solvent molar enthalpy of fusion.

== Osmotic pressure ==

The osmotic pressure of a solution is the difference in pressure between the solution and the pure liquid solvent when the two are in equilibrium across a semipermeable membrane, which allows the passage of solvent molecules but not of solute particles. If the two phases are at the same initial pressure, there is a net transfer of solvent across the membrane into the solution known as osmosis. The process stops and equilibrium is attained when the pressure difference equals the osmotic pressure.

Two laws governing the osmotic pressure of a dilute solution were discovered by the German botanist W. F. P. Pfeffer and the Dutch chemist J. H. van’t Hoff:

# The osmotic pressure of a dilute solution at constant temperature is directly proportional to its concentration.
# The osmotic pressure of a solution is directly proportional to its absolute temperature.

These are analogous to Boyle&#x27;s law and Charles&#x27;s law for gases. Similarly, the combined ideal gas law, formula_18, has as an analogue for ideal solutions formula_19, where formula_20 is osmotic pressure; &quot;V&quot; is the volume; &quot;n&quot; is the number of moles of solute; &quot;R&quot; is the molar gas constant 8.314 J K−1 mol−1; &quot;T&quot; is absolute temperature; and &quot;i&quot; is the Van &#x27;t Hoff factor.

The osmotic pressure is then proportional to the molar concentration formula_21, since

:formula_22

The osmotic pressure is proportional to the concentration of solute particles &quot;ci&quot; and is therefore a colligative property.

As with the other colligative properties, this equation is a consequence of the equality of solvent chemical potentials of the two phases in equilibrium. In this case the phases are the pure solvent at pressure &quot;P&quot; and the solution at total pressure (&quot;P&quot; + formula_20).

==History==
The word colligative (Latin: co, ligare) was introduced in 1891 by Wilhelm Ostwald. Ostwald classified solute properties in three categories: 
# &quot;colligative&quot; properties, which depend only on solute concentration and temperature and are independent of the nature of the solute particles
# &quot;additive&quot; properties such as mass, which are the sums of properties of the constituent particles and therefore depend also on the composition (or molecular formula) of the solute, and 
# &quot;constitutional&quot; properties, which depend further on the molecular structure of the given solute.

<text>Leonard Joseph Rose (July 27, 1918 – November 16, 1984) was an American cellist and pedagogue.

== Biography ==
Rose was born in Washington, D.C. His parents were Jewish immigrants, his father from Bragin, Belarus, and his mother from Kyiv, Ukraine. Rose started taking piano lessons when he was eight years old before switching to the cello when he was ten years old at the suggestion of his father. His cello teachers were Walter Grossman, Frank Miller and Felix Salmond. After completing his studies at Philadelphia&#x27;s Curtis Institute of Music at age 20, he joined Arturo Toscanini&#x27;s NBC Symphony Orchestra, and almost immediately became associate principal. At 21 he was principal cellist of the Cleveland Orchestra and at 26 became the principal of the New York Philharmonic.

He made many recordings as a soloist after 1951, including concertos with conductors such as Leonard Bernstein, Eugene Ormandy, George Szell and Bruno Walter among others. Rose also joined with Isaac Stern and Eugene Istomin in a celebrated piano trio.

Rose&#x27;s legacy as a teacher remains to this day: his students from the Juilliard School, Curtis Institute and Ivan Galamian&#x27;s Meadowmount Summer School fill the sections of many American orchestras, notably those of the Boston Symphony Orchestra, Cleveland Orchestra, Philadelphia Orchestra, and the New York Philharmonic. His pupils include Lori Singer, Raymond Davis, Desmond Hoebig, Peter Stumpf, Fred Sherry, Christopher von Baeyer, Myung-wha Chung, Patrick Sohn, Thomas Demenga, Stephen Kates, Lynn Harrell, Yehuda Hanani, Hans Jørgen Jensen, Steven Honigberg, Eric Kim, Roger Drinkall, Robert deMaine, Bruce Uchimura, Donald Whitton, Yo-Yo Ma, Ronald Leonard, Steven Pologe, Sara Sant&#x27;Ambrogio, Matt Haimovitz, Mats Lidström, Richard Hirschl, John Sant’Ambrogio, and Marijane Carr Siegal. 

Rose died in White Plains, New York, of leukemia. In November 2009, a memorial marker was placed for Rose in the Mt. Ararat Cemetery in Farmingdale, New York, next to the grave of his first wife, Minnie Knopow Rose, who died in 1964. Minnie and Leonard met at Curtis, where she studied viola. His second wife was Xenia Petschek, whom he married in January 1965. Rose played an Amati cello dated 1662, played today by Gary Hoffman.

<text>Ferdinando Angelo Maria Provesi (1770 – 1833) was a native of Parma, Italy. He was regarded as one of the greatest Italian opera composers of the era . Provesi is best known as being an early tutor of Giuseppe Verdi when he was the &quot;Maestro di cappella&quot; (master of music) at the St. Bartolomeo cathedral in Busseto (the town very close to Le Roncole, the village where Verdi was born.) Provesi was also director of the municipal music school and local Philharmonic Society. He began teaching Verdi in 1824 when the future composer was 11 years old.

When he died in Busseto in 1833, it opened the way for the young Verdi to apply to take over his post in the town, a post which he held for two-and-a-half years after which Verdi returned to Milan.

<doc id="456251" wikidata="Q5029303" url="?curid=456251" title="Canada After Dark">
<text>Canada After Dark was Canada&#x27;s first late-night comedy/variety talk show. It was hosted by Paul Soles and aired on CBC Television from September 18, 1978, to January 26, 1979.

The show was repackaged from the failed, more informational &quot;90 Minutes Live&quot;. Executive producer Alex Frame and producer Bob Ennis decided to try a show that would be comparable to &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; instead, changing the name of the show to &quot;Canada After Dark&quot; and replacing host Peter Gzowski with veteran comedic actor Soles. The new show would last for less than half a season.

The Royal Canadian Air Farce parodied the show with skits called &quot;Clark In The Dark&quot;, featuring then-Prime Minister Joe Clark (played by Don Ferguson) acting as &quot;host&quot; from the gallery of an empty House Of Commons. The skits were revived after Clark returned to politics in the late 1990s.

<doc id="456252" wikidata="Q163042" url="?curid=456252" title="David Duke">
<text>David Ernest Duke (born July 1, 1950) is an American politician, neo-Nazi, conspiracy theorist, and former grand wizard of the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan. From 1989 to 1992, he was a member of the Louisiana House of Representatives for the Republican Party. His politics and writings are largely devoted to promoting conspiracy theories about Jews, such as Holocaust denial and Jewish control of academia, the press, and the financial system. In 2013, the Anti-Defamation League called Duke &quot;perhaps America&#x27;s most well-known racist and anti-Semite&quot;.

Duke unsuccessfully ran as a Democratic candidate for state legislature during the 1970s and 1980s, culminating in his campaign for the 1988 Democratic presidential nomination. After failing to gain any traction within the Democratic Party, he gained the presidential nomination of the minor Populist Party. In December 1988, he became a Republican and claimed to have become a born-again Christian, nominally renouncing antisemitism and racism. He soon won his only elected office, a seat in the Louisiana House of Representatives. He then ran unsuccessful but competitive campaigns for several more offices, including United States Senate in 1990 and governor of Louisiana in 1991. His campaigns were denounced by national and state Republican leaders, including President George H. W. Bush. He mounted a minor challenge to President Bush in 1992.

By the late 1990s, Duke had abandoned his pretense of rejecting racism and antisemitism, and began to openly promote racist and neo-Nazi viewpoints. He then began to devote himself to writing about his political views, both in newsletters and later on the Internet. In his writings, he denigrates African Americans and other ethnic minorities, and promotes conspiracy theories about a Jewish plot to control America and the world. He continued to run for public office through 2016, but after his reversion to open neo-Nazism, his candidacies were not competitive.

During the 1990s, Duke defrauded his political supporters by pretending to be in dire financial straits and soliciting money for basic necessities. At the time, he was in fact financially secure and used the money for recreational gambling. In December 2002, Duke pleaded guilty to felony fraud and subsequently served a 15-month sentence at Federal Correctional Institution, Big Spring, in Texas.

==Early life==

Duke was born on July 1, 1950, in Tulsa, Oklahoma, to Maxine (née Crick) and David Hedger Duke, the younger of two children. As the son of an engineer for Shell Oil Company, Duke frequently moved with his family around the world. During 1954, they lived a short time in the Netherlands before settling in an all-white area of New Orleans, Louisiana, in 1955. His mother was an alcoholic; his father permanently left the family in 1966 for Laos taking a job with United States Agency for International Development (USAID). While in New Orleans, Duke attended the Clifton L. Ganus School, a conservative Church of Christ-sponsored school. He said his segregationist awakening started during his research for an eighth-grade project at this school. After his freshman year, Duke transferred to Warren Easton Senior High in New Orleans. For his junior year, he attended Riverside Military Academy in Gainesville, Georgia. His senior year, he attended John F. Kennedy High School, and by the time he graduated was already a member of the Ku Klux Klan.

In 1964, Duke began his involvement in radical right politics after attending a Citizens&#x27; Councils (CCA) meeting and reading Carleton Putnam&#x27;s pro-segregation books, later citing &quot;Race and Reason: A Yankee View&quot; as responsible for his &quot;enlightenment&quot;. Putnam&#x27;s book asserted the genetic superiority of whites. Also during his adolescence, Duke began to read books about Nazism and the Third Reich, and his speeches at CCA meetings became more explicitly pro-Nazi. This was enough to gain him disapproval from some members, who were more anti-black racists than antisemitic. While attending Riverside Military Academy, his class was disciplined after Duke was found to be in possession of a Nazi flag and, in public school, he vociferously protested against the lowering of the flag after the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. In the late 1960s, Duke met William Luther Pierce, the leader of the neo-Nazi and white nationalist National Alliance, who became an influence on him. Duke joined the Ku Klux Klan (KKK) in 1967.

In 1968, Duke enrolled at Louisiana State University (LSU) in Baton Rouge. In 1970, he formed a white student group called the White Youth Alliance that was affiliated with the National Socialist White People&#x27;s Party. He appeared at a demonstration in Nazi uniform carrying a sign reading &quot;Gas the Chicago 7&quot; (a group of left-wing anti-war activists William Kunstler had defended) and &quot;Kunstler is a Communist Jew&quot; to protest Kunstler&#x27;s appearance at Tulane University in New Orleans. Picketing and holding parties on the anniversary of Adolf Hitler&#x27;s birth, he became known on the LSU campus for wearing a Nazi uniform. While a student at LSU, Duke took a road trip to an American Nazi Party conference in Virginia with white supremacists Joseph Paul Franklin (later convicted of multiple acts of racial and antisemitic terrorism and executed for serial murder) and Don Black.

Duke says that he spent nine months in Laos, calling it a &quot;normal tour of duty&quot;. He joined his father, who remained working there, and had asked his son to visit during the summer of 1971. His father helped him gain a job teaching English to Laotian military officers, from which he was dismissed after six weeks when he drew a Molotov cocktail on the blackboard. He also claimed to have gone behind enemy lines 20 times at night to drop rice to anti-communist insurgents in planes flying off the ground, narrowly avoiding a shrapnel wound. Two Air America pilots who were in Laos at that time said that the planes flew only during the day and no less than from the ground. One pilot suggested that it might have been possible for Duke to have gone on a safe &quot;milk run&quot; once or twice but no more than that. Duke was unable to recall the name of the airfield he had used.

=== 1972 arrest in New Orleans ===
In January 1972, Duke was arrested in New Orleans for inciting a riot. Several racial confrontations broke out that month in the city, including one at the Robert E. Lee Monument involving Duke, Addison Roswell Thompson—a perennial segregationist candidate for governor of Louisiana and mayor of New Orleans—and his 89-year-old friend and mentor, Rene LaCoste. Thompson and LaCoste dressed in Klan robes for the occasion and placed a Confederate flag at the monument. The Black Panthers began throwing bricks at the two men, but police arrived in time to prevent serious injury.

In 1972, Duke was charged with soliciting campaign funds for presidential candidate George Wallace and keeping the proceeds. He was also charged with filling glass containers with a flammable liquid, banned under a New Orleans ordinance. Both charges were eventually dropped.

=== Knights of the Ku Klux Klan ===

In 1974, Duke founded the Louisiana-based Knights of the Ku Klux Klan (KKKK), shortly after graduating from LSU. He became the KKKK&#x27;s &quot;grand wizard&quot; in 1976. Duke first received broad public attention during this time, as he endeavored to market himself in the mid-1970s as a new brand of Klansman: well-groomed, engaged, and professional. He also reformed the organization, promoting nonviolence and legality; also, for the first time in the Klan&#x27;s history, women were accepted as equal members and Catholics were encouraged to apply for membership. Duke repeatedly insisted that the Klan was &quot;not anti-black&quot; but rather &quot;pro-white&quot; and &quot;pro-Christian&quot;. He told the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; newspaper that he left the Klan in 1980 because he disliked its associations with violence and could not stop members of other Klan chapters from doing &quot;stupid or violent things&quot;. In April 1992, Julia Reed wrote in &quot;The New York Review of Books&quot; that Duke was forced to leave the Klan after selling a copy of its membership records to a rival Klan leader who was a Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) informer.

==Political and ideological activities==
===Early campaigns===

Duke first ran for a seat in the Louisiana State Senate as a Democrat from a Baton Rouge district in 1975. During his campaign, he was allowed to speak on the college campuses of Vanderbilt University, Indiana University, the University of Southern California, Stanford University, and Tulane University. He received 11,079 votes, one-third of those cast.

Duke ran for a seat in the state senate again in 1979, losing to the incumbent, Joe Tiemann.

In the late 1970s, several Klan officials accused Duke of stealing the organization&#x27;s money. &quot;Duke is nothing but a con artist&quot;, Jack Gregory, Duke&#x27;s Florida state leader, told the &quot;Clearwater Sun&quot; after Duke allegedly refused to turn over proceeds from a series of 1979 Klan rallies to the Knights. Another Klan official under Duke, Jerry Dutton, told reporters that Duke had used Klan funds to purchase and refurbish his home in Metairie. Duke later justified the repairs by saying most of his home was used by the Klan.

He ran for the Democratic presidential nomination during the 1980 presidential election. Despite being six years too young to be president, Duke attempted to place his name on the ballot in 12 states, saying he wanted to be a power broker who could &quot;select issues and form a platform representing the majority of this country&quot; at the Democratic National Convention. In 1979, he pleaded guilty to disturbing the peace when he led 70 to 100 Klansmen to surround police vehicles in a Metairie hotel parking lot in September 1976, and was fined $100 and given a three-month suspended sentence. Duke and James K. Warner had originally been convicted on that charge in 1977, but the Louisiana Supreme Court had reversed the ruling because the state had introduced inadmissible evidence. Duke was arrested for illegally entering Canada in order to discuss third-world immigration into Canada on a talk show.

He left the Ku Klux Klan in 1980, after he was accused of trying to sell the organization&#x27;s mailing list for $35,000. He founded the National Association for the Advancement of White People and served as its president after leaving the Klan. Using the group&#x27;s newsletter, he promoted Holocaust denial literature for sale such as &quot;The Hoax of the Twentieth Century&quot; and &quot;Did Six Million Really Die?&quot;

Duke allegedly conducted a direct-mail appeal in 1987, using the identity and mailing-list of the Georgia Forsyth County Defense League without permission. League officials described it as a fundraising scam.

=== 1988 presidential campaign ===
In 1988, Duke ran initially in the Democratic presidential primaries. His campaign had limited impact, with one minor exception — as the only candidate on the ballot, he won the little-known New Hampshire vice presidential primary. Duke, having failed to gain much traction as a Democrat, then sought and gained the presidential nomination of the Populist Party, an organization founded by Willis Carto. He appeared on the ballot for president in 11 states and was a write-in candidate in some other states, some with Trenton Stokes of Arkansas for vice president, and on other state ballots with Floyd Parker, a physician from New Mexico, for vice president. He received just 47,047 votes, for 0.04% of the national popular vote.

=== 1989: Successful run in special election for Louisiana House seat ===
In December 1988, Duke changed his political affiliation from the Democratic Party to the Republican Party.

In 1988, Republican state representative Chuck Cusimano of Metairie resigned his District 81 seat to become a 24th Judicial District Court judge, and a special election was called early in 1989 to select a successor. Duke entered the race to succeed Cusimano and faced several opponents, including fellow Republicans John Spier Treen, a brother of former governor David C. Treen; Delton Charles, a school board member; and Roger F. Villere Jr., who operates Villere&#x27;s Florist in Metairie. Duke finished first in the primary with 3,995 votes (33.1%). As no one received a majority of the vote in the first round, a runoff election was required between Duke and Treen, who polled 2,277 votes (18.9%) in the first round of balloting. Treen&#x27;s candidacy was endorsed by U.S. president George H. W. Bush, former president Ronald Reagan, and other prominent Republicans, as well as Democrats Victor Bussie (president of the Louisiana AFL–CIO) and Edward J. Steimel (president of the Louisiana Association of Business and Industry and former director of the &quot;good government&quot; think tank, the Public Affairs Research Council). Duke criticized Treen for a statement he had made indicating willingness to entertain higher property taxes, anathema in that suburban district. With 8,459 votes (50.7%), Duke defeated Treen, who polled 8,232 votes (49.3%). He served in the House from 1989 until 1992.

Freshman legislator Odon Bacqué of Lafayette, a No Party member of the House, stood alone in 1989 when he attempted to deny seating to Duke on the grounds that the incoming representative had resided outside his district at the time of his election. When Treen failed in a court challenge in regard to Duke&#x27;s residency, the latter was seated. Lawmakers who opposed Duke said that they had to defer to his constituents, who narrowly chose him as representative.

===As state representative===
Duke took his seat on the same day as Jerry Luke LeBlanc of Lafayette Parish (who won another special election, held on the same day as the Duke-Treen runoff, to choose a successor to Kathleen Blanco, the future governor who was elected to the Louisiana Public Service Commission). Duke and LeBlanc were sworn in separately.

Colleague Ron Gomez of Lafayette stated that Duke, as a short-term legislator, was &quot;so single minded, he never really became involved in the nuts and bolts of House rules and parliamentary procedure. It was just that shortcoming that led to the demise of most of his attempts at lawmaking.&quot;

One legislative issue pushed by Duke was the requirement that welfare recipients be tested for the use of narcotics. The recipients had to show themselves to be drug-free to receive state and federal benefits under his proposal. Gomez, in his 2000 autobiography, said that he recalls Duke obtaining the passage of only a single bill, legislation which prohibited movie producers or book publishers from compensating jurors for accounts of their court experiences.

Duke launched unsuccessful campaigns for the U.S. Senate in 1990 and governor in 1991.

=== 1990 campaign for U.S. Senate ===

Though Duke had first hesitated about entering the Senate race, he made his announcement of candidacy for the nonpartisan blanket primary held on October 6, 1990. Duke was the only Republican in competition against three Democrats, including incumbent U.S. senator J. Bennett Johnston, Jr., of Shreveport, whom Duke derided as &quot;J. Benedict Johnston&quot;.

Former governor David Treen, whose brother, John Treen, Duke had defeated for state representative in 1989, called Duke&#x27;s senatorial platform &quot;garbage. ... I think he is bad for our party because of his espousal of Nazism and racial superiority.&quot;

The Republican Party officially endorsed state senator Ben Bagert of New Orleans in a state convention on January 13, 1990, but national GOP officials in October, just days before the primary election, concluded that Bagert could not win. To avoid a runoff between Duke and Johnston, the GOP decided to surrender the primary to Johnston. Funding for Bagert&#x27;s campaign was halted, and after initial protest, Bagert dropped out two days before the election. With such a late withdrawal, Bagert&#x27;s name remained on the ballot, but his votes, most of them presumably cast as absentee ballots, were not counted. Duke received 43.51% (607,391 votes) of the primary vote to Johnston&#x27;s 53.93% (752,902 votes).

Duke&#x27;s views prompted some of his critics, including Republicans such as journalist Quin Hillyer, to form the Louisiana Coalition Against Racism and Nazism, which directed media attention to Duke&#x27;s statements of hostility to blacks and Jews.

In a 2006 &quot;Financial Times&quot; editorial, Gideon Rachman recalled interviewing Duke&#x27;s 1990 campaign manager, who said, &quot;The Jews just aren&#x27;t a big issue in Louisiana. We keep telling David, stick to attacking the blacks. There&#x27;s no point in going after the Jews, you just piss them off and nobody here cares about them anyway.&quot;

=== 1991 campaign for governor of Louisiana ===
Despite repudiation by the Republican Party, Duke ran for governor of Louisiana in 1991. In the primary, he finished second to former governor Edwin W. Edwards; thus, he faced Edwards in a runoff. In the initial round, Duke received 32% of the vote. Incumbent governor Buddy Roemer, who had switched from the Democratic to the Republican Party during his term, came in third with 27% of the vote. Although Duke had a sizable core constituency of devoted supporters, many voted for him as a &quot;protest vote&quot; to register dissatisfaction with Louisiana&#x27;s establishment politicians. In response to criticism for his past white supremacist activities, Duke&#x27;s stock response was to apologize for his past and declare that he was a born-again Christian. During the campaign, he said he was the spokesman for the &quot;white majority&quot; and, according to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;equated the extermination of Jews in Nazi Germany with affirmative action programs in the United States&quot;.

The Christian Coalition of America, which exerted considerable impact on the Republican State Central Committee, was led in Louisiana by its national director and vice president, Billy McCormack, then the pastor of University Worship Center in Shreveport. The coalition was accused of having failed to investigate Duke in the early part of his political resurgence. But by the 1991 gubernatorial election, its leadership had withdrawn support for Duke. Despite Duke&#x27;s status as the only Republican in the runoff, incumbent president George H. W. Bush opposed his candidacy and denounced him as a charlatan and a racist. White House chief of staff John H. Sununu said, &quot;The president is absolutely opposed to the kind of racist statements that have come out of David Duke now and in the past.&quot;

The Louisiana Coalition Against Racism and Nazism rallied against Duke&#x27;s gubernatorial campaign. Elizabeth Rickey, a moderate member of the Louisiana Republican State Central Committee and niece of Branch Rickey, began to follow Duke to record his speeches and expose what she saw as instances of racist and neo-Nazi remarks. For a time, Duke took Rickey to lunch, introduced her to his daughters, telephoned her late at night, and tried to convince her of his beliefs, including that the Holocaust was a myth, Auschwitz physician Josef Mengele was a medical genius, and that blacks and Jews were responsible for various social ills. Rickey released transcripts of their conversations to the press and also provided evidence establishing that Duke sold Nazi literature (such as &quot;Mein Kampf&quot;) from his legislative office and attended neo-Nazi political gatherings while he held elective office.

Between the primary and the runoff, called the &quot;general election&quot; under Louisiana election rules (in which all candidates run on one ballot, regardless of party), white supremacist organizations from around the country contributed to Duke&#x27;s campaign fund.

Duke&#x27;s rise garnered national media attention. While he gained the backing of former Alexandria mayor John K. Snyder, Duke won few serious endorsements in Louisiana. Celebrities and organizations donated thousands of dollars to former governor Edwin Edwards&#x27; campaign. Referencing Edwards&#x27; long-standing problem with accusations of corruption, popular bumper stickers read: &quot;Vote for the Crook. It&#x27;s Important&quot;, and &quot;Vote for the Lizard, not the Wizard.&quot; When a reporter asked Edwards what he needed to do to triumph over Duke, Edwards replied with a smile: &quot;Stay alive.&quot;

The runoff debate, held on November 6, 1991, received significant attention when journalist Norman Robinson questioned Duke. Robinson, who is African American, told Duke that he was &quot;scared&quot; by the prospect of Duke winning the election because of his history of &quot;diabolical, evil, vile&quot; racist and antisemitic comments, some of which he read to Duke. He then pressed Duke for an apology and when Duke protested that Robinson was not being fair to him, Robinson replied that he did not think Duke was being honest. Jason Berry of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; called it &quot;startling TV&quot; and the &quot;catalyst&quot; for the &quot;overwhelming&quot; turnout of black voters who helped Edwards defeat Duke.

Edwards received 1,057,031 votes (61.2%), while Duke&#x27;s 671,009 votes represented 38.8% of the total. Duke nevertheless claimed victory, saying, &quot;I won my constituency. I won 55% of the white vote&quot;, a statistic confirmed by exit polls. Duke, rather than Edwards, was on network television the following day; his rival refused to appear with him.

=== 1992 Republican Party presidential candidate ===

Duke ran as a Republican in the 1992 presidential primaries, although Republican Party officials tried to block his participation. He received 119,115 (0.94%) votes in the primaries, but no delegates to the 1992 Republican National Convention.

A 1992 documentary film, &quot;Backlash: Race and the American Dream&quot;, investigates Duke&#x27;s appeal among some white voters. It explores the demagogic issues of Duke&#x27;s platform, examining his use of black crime, welfare, affirmative action and white supremacy, and tying Duke to a legacy of other white backlash politicians, such as Lester G. Maddox and George Wallace, and the use in the successful 1988 presidential campaign of George H. W. Bush of these same racially themed hot buttons.

=== 1996 campaign for U.S. Senate ===
When Johnston announced his retirement in 1996, Duke ran again for the U.S. Senate. He polled 141,489 votes (11.5%). Former Republican state representative Woody Jenkins of Baton Rouge and Democrat Mary Landrieu of New Orleans, the former state treasurer, went into the general election contest. Duke was fourth in the nine-person, jungle primary race.

=== 1999 campaign for U.S. House ===
A special election was held in Louisiana&#x27;s First Congressional District following the sudden resignation of Republican incumbent Bob Livingston in 1999. Duke sought the seat as a Republican and received 19% of the vote. He finished a close third, thus failing to make the runoff. His candidacy was repudiated by the Republicans. Republican Party chairman Jim Nicholson remarked: &quot;There is no room in the party of Lincoln for a Klansman like David Duke.&quot; Republican state representative David Vitter (later a U.S. senator) defeated former governor Treen. Also in the race was the New Orleans Republican leader Rob Couhig.

=== New Orleans Protocol ===
Duke organized a weekend gathering of &quot;European Nationalists&quot; in Kenner, Louisiana. In an attempt to overcome the splintering and division in the white nationalist movement that had followed the 2002 death of leader William Luther Pierce, Duke presented a unity proposal for peace within the movement and a better image for outsiders. His proposal was accepted and is now known as the New Orleans Protocol (NOP). It pledges adherents to a pan-European outlook, recognizing national and ethnic allegiance, but stressing the value of all European peoples. Signed by and sponsored by a number of white supremacist leaders and organizations, it has three provisions: 1. Zero tolerance for violence. 2. Honorable and ethical behavior in relations with other signatory groups. This includes not denouncing others who have signed this protocol. In other words, no enemies on the right. 3. Maintaining a high tone in our arguments and public presentations.

Those who signed the pact on May 29, 2004, include Duke, Don Black, Paul Fromm, Willis Carto (whose Holocaust-denying &quot;The Barnes Review&quot; helped sponsor the event), Kevin Alfred Strom, and John Tyndall (signing as an individual, not on behalf of the British National Party).

The Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) said that the NOP&#x27;s &quot;high tone&quot; contrasts with statements at the event where the pact was signed, such as Paul Fromm&#x27;s calling a Muslim woman &quot;a hag in a bag&quot; and Sam Dickson (from the Council of Conservative Citizens, another sponsor) speaking about the &quot;very, very destructive&quot; effect of opposing the Nazis in World War II—opposition that caused people to view Hitler&#x27;s &quot;normal, healthy racial values&quot; as evil. The SPLC called the NOP a &quot;smokescreen&quot;, saying that &quot;most of the conference participants&#x27; ire was directed at what they consider to be a worldwide Jewish conspiracy to destroy the white race through immigration and miscegenation&quot;.

=== Political activity (1999–2012) ===
Duke joined the Reform Party in 1999. He left the party after the 2000 election.

In 2004, Duke&#x27;s bodyguard, roommate, and longtime associate Roy Armstrong ran for the U.S. House of Representatives as a Democrat, to serve Louisiana&#x27;s First Congressional District. In the open primary, Armstrong finished second in the six-candidate field with 6.69% of the vote to Republican Bobby Jindal&#x27;s 78.40%. Duke was the head advisor of Armstrong&#x27;s campaign.

Duke claimed that thousands of Tea Party movement activists had urged him to run for president in 2012, and that he was seriously considering entering the Republican Party primaries. He did not contest the primaries, which Mitt Romney won.

===Donald Trump advocacy===
In 2015, it was reported by the media that Duke endorsed then presidential nominee Donald Trump. Duke later clarified in an interview with &quot;The Daily Beast&quot; in August 2015 that while he viewed Trump as &quot;the best of the lot&quot;, due to his stance on immigration, Trump&#x27;s support for Israel was a deal-breaker for him, saying, &quot;Trump has made it very clear that he&#x27;s 1,000 percent dedicated to Israel, so how much is left over for America?&quot; In December 2015, Duke said Trump speaks more radically than he does, advising that Trump&#x27;s radical speech is both a positive and a negative.

In February 2016, Duke urged his listeners to vote for Trump, saying that voting for anyone but Trump &quot;is really treason to your heritage&quot;. Trump, Duke believed, was &quot;by far the best candidate&quot;. When asked whether he renounced Duke&#x27;s support, Trump responded: &quot;I don&#x27;t know anything about David Duke. Okay?...I know nothing about white supremacists. And so you&#x27;re asking me a question that I&#x27;m supposed to be talking about people that I know nothing about.&quot; In March 2016, Trump disavowed Duke and the Klan, saying, &quot;David Duke is a bad person&quot; and &quot;I disavowed him in the past. I disavow him now.&quot;

For the 2020 presidential election, Duke again expressed his preference for Donald Trump over Joe Biden, which was widely interpreted as an endorsement. Duke urged Trump to replace his vice president, Mike Pence, with talk show host Tucker Carlson, asserting that such a ticket was the only way to &quot;stop the commie Bolsheviks&quot;.

=== 2016 campaign for U.S. Senate ===
On July 22, 2016, Duke announced that he was planning to run for the Republican nomination for the United States Senate seat in Louisiana being vacated by Republican David Vitter. He said he was running &quot;to defend the rights of European Americans&quot;. He claimed that his platform had become the Republican mainstream, adding, &quot;I&#x27;m overjoyed to see Donald Trump and most Americans embrace most of the issues that I&#x27;ve championed for years.&quot; But Trump&#x27;s campaign reaffirmed that Trump disavows Duke&#x27;s support, and Republican organizations said they will not support him &quot;under any circumstances&quot;. On August 5, 2016, National Public Radio (NPR) aired an interview of Duke by Steve Inskeep in which Duke claimed that there is widespread racism against European Americans, that they have been subject to vicious attacks in the media, and that Trump&#x27;s voters were also his voters.

A Mason-Dixon poll released on October 20, 2016, showed Duke receiving support from 5.1% of voters in the state, barely clearing the 5% requirement for a candidate to be allowed to participate in a November 2 debate.

Duke received 3% of the vote on Election Day, with a total of 58,581 votes out of nearly 2 million cast. He came in 7th place in Louisiana&#x27;s open primary.

Those who made donations to the campaign were publicly outed in several states in 2017, leading to boycotts, lost business, and one restaurant to close entirely.

=== 2020 United States presidential election endorsement ===
In February 2019, the media reported Duke had endorsed Tulsi Gabbard for the Democratic nomination for president and changed his Twitter banner to a picture of Gabbard. He tweeted: &quot;Tulsi Gabbard for President. Finally a candidate who will actually put America First rather than Israel First!&quot; Gabbard refused Duke&#x27;s support: &quot;I have strongly denounced David Duke&#x27;s hateful views and his so-called &#x27;support&#x27; multiple times in the past, and reject his support.&quot; After Gabbard&#x27;s defeat, Duke endorsed Trump for reelection.

=== 2024 United States presidential election endorsement ===
In October 2024, Duke endorsed Green Party nominee Jill Stein for president of the United States, criticizing what he viewed as &quot;Trump&#x27;s subservience to the Jewish lobby&quot; and praising Stein&#x27;s opposition to the Israel-Hamas war. Stein campaign manager Jason Call disavowed Duke&#x27;s endorsement, and Stein&#x27;s official Twitter account described Duke as a &quot;racist troll.&quot;

==Antisemitism==
=== Racial theories ===
In 1998, Duke self-published the autobiographical &quot;My Awakening: A Path to Racial Understanding&quot;. The book details Duke&#x27;s social philosophies, including his advocacy of racial separation: &quot;We [Whites] desire to live in our own neighborhoods, go to our own schools, work in our own cities and towns, and ultimately live as one extended family in our own nation. We shall end the racial genocide of integration. We shall work for the eventual establishment of a separate homeland for African Americans, so each race will be free to pursue its own destiny without racial conflicts and ill will.&quot;

A book review by Abraham Foxman, then the national director of the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), describes &quot;My Awakening&quot; as containing racist, antisemitic, sexist, and homophobic opinions.

Duke promotes the white genocide conspiracy theory and claims that Jews are &quot;organizing white genocide&quot;. In 2017, he accused Anthony Bourdain of promoting white genocide; in response, Bourdain offered to &quot;rearrange&quot; Duke&#x27;s kneecaps.

An ADL profile of Duke states: &quot;Although Duke denies that he is a white supremacist and avoids the term in public speeches and writings, the policies and positions he advocates state clearly that white people are the only ones morally qualified to determine the rights that should apply to other ethnic groups.&quot;

=== Claims of &quot;Jewish supremacy&quot; ===
In 2001, Duke promoted his book &quot;Jewish Supremacism: My Awakening to the Jewish Question&quot; in Russia. In it, he purports to &quot;examine and document elements of ethnic supremacism that have existed in the Jewish community from historical to modern times&quot;. The book is dedicated to Israel Shahak, a critical author of what Shahak saw as supremacist religious teachings in Jewish culture. Former Boris Yeltsin press minister Boris Mironov wrote an introduction to the Russian edition, printed under the title &quot;The Jewish Question Through the Eyes of an American&quot;. The work draws on the writings of Kevin B. MacDonald, including multiple uses of the same sources and citations.

The Anti-Defamation League office in Moscow urged the Moscow prosecutor to open an investigation into Mironov. The ADL office initiated a letter from Alexander Fedulov, a prominent member of the Duma, to Prosecutor General Vladimir Ustinov, urging a criminal case be opened against the author and the Russian publisher of Duke&#x27;s book. In his letter, Fedulov described the book as antisemitic and a violation of Russian anti-hate crime laws. Around December 2001, the prosecutor&#x27;s office closed the investigation of Boris Mironov and &quot;Jewish Supremacism&quot;. In a public letter, Yury Biryukov, First Deputy of the Prosecutor General of the Russian Federation, stated that a psychological examination, which was conducted as a part of the investigation, concluded that the book and the actions of Boris Mironov did not break Russian hate-crime laws.

The ADL has described the book as antisemitic. At one time, the book was sold in the main lobby of the building of the Russian State Duma (lower house of parliament).

After the March 2006 publication of a paper on the Israel lobby by John Mearsheimer and Stephen Walt, Duke praised the paper in a number of articles on his website, in his broadcasts, and on MSNBC&#x27;s March 21 &quot;Scarborough Country&quot; program. According to &quot;The New York Sun&quot;, Duke wrote in an email that he was &quot;surprised how excellent [the paper] is. It is quite satisfying to see a body in the premier American university essentially come out and validate every major point I have been making since even before the war [in Iraq] even started. ...The task before us is to wrest control of America&#x27;s foreign policy and critical junctures of media from the Jewish extremist Neocons that seek to lead us into what they expectantly call World War IV.&quot; Walt said: &quot;I have always found Mr. Duke&#x27;s views reprehensible, and I am sorry he sees this article as consistent with his view of the world&quot;.

In 2015, after 47 Senate Republicans warned Iran that agreements made with the U.S. that were not ratified by the Senate were liable to be repudiated by a future president, Duke told Fox News&#x27; Alan Colmes that the signatories &quot;should become a Jew, put on a yarmulke, because they are not Americans. They have sold their soul to the Jewish power in this country and the Jewish power overseas&quot;. His website has hosted articles by authors claiming that Jewish loan sharks own the Federal Reserve Bank and that Jews own Hollywood and the U.S. media.

=== Supposed &quot;Zionist control&quot; ===
In the post-9/11 issue of his newsletter, Duke wrote that &quot;reason should tell us that even if Israeli agents were not the actual provocateurs behind the operation [on 9/11], at the very least they had prior knowledge. ...Zionists caused the attack America endured just as surely as if they themselves had piloted those planes. It was caused by the Jewish control of the American media and Congress.&quot;

In an interview for the Iranian Press TV on September 11, 2012, Duke said: &quot;There are Israeli fingerprints all over the whole 9/11 aspect. ...Israel has a long record of terrorism against America... there are a lot of reasons that Israel wanted 9/11 to happen. Of the Iraq War, Duke said, &quot;The Zionists orchestrated and created this war in the media, the government, and international finance.&quot; In another appearance on Press TV the next year, Duke said Congress &quot;is totally in the hands of the Zionists. The Zionists control the American government, lock, stock, and barrel.&quot; According to him, Jews&#x27; supposed control of the U.S. is &quot;the world&#x27;s greatest single problem&quot;.

=== Holocaust denier Ernst Zündel ===
Duke has made a number of statements supporting Holocaust denier Ernst Zündel, a German emigrant in Canada. Zündel was deported from Canada to Germany and imprisoned in Germany on charges of inciting the masses to ethnic hatred. After Zündel died in August 2017, Duke called him a &quot;very heroic and courageous European preservationist&quot;.

=== Activities in Ukraine and Russia (2005–2006) ===
In the 1990s, Duke traveled to Russia several times, meeting antisemitic Russian politicians such as Vladimir Zhirinovsky and Albert Makashov.

In September 2005, the Ukrainian private university Interregional Academy of Personnel Management (MAUP), described by the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) as a &quot;University of Hate&quot;, gave Duke a non-accredited PhD in history. His doctoral thesis was titled &quot;Zionism as a Form of Ethnic Supremacism&quot;. MAUP&#x27;s PhD program was not accredited by Ukraine&#x27;s Higher Attestation Commission or its successor, the Ministry of Education and Science of Ukraine, so the Ukrainian state does not recognize its PhD diplomas as real academic degrees. The ADL has said that MAUP is the main source of antisemitic activity and publishing in Ukraine, and its &quot;anti-Semitic actions&quot; were condemned by Foreign Minister Borys Tarasyuk and various organizations. Duke has taught an international relations course and a history course at MAUP. On June 3, 2005, he co-chaired a conference named &quot;Zionism As the Biggest Threat to Modern Civilization&quot; sponsored by MAUP and attended by several Ukrainian public figures and politicians and Israel Shamir, described by the ADL as an anti-Semitic writer.

On the weekend of June 8–10, 2006, Duke attended and spoke at the international &quot;White World&#x27;s Future&quot; conference in Moscow, which was coordinated and hosted by Pavel Tulayev.

=== Iranian Holocaust conference ===
On December 11–13, 2006, at the invitation of then Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, Duke took part in the International Conference to Review the Global Vision of the Holocaust, an event held in Tehran questioning the Holocaust. &quot;The Zionists have used the Holocaust as a weapon to deny the rights of the Palestinians and cover up the crimes of Israel&quot;, Duke told a gathering of nearly 70 participants. &quot;This conference has an incredible impact on Holocaust studies all over the world&quot;, said Duke, adding, &quot;The Holocaust is the device used as the pillar of Zionist imperialism, Zionist aggression, Zionist terror and Zionist murder.&quot;

=== 2024 ===
In June 2024, David Duke participated in an antisemitic rally in Detroit alongside others including Nick Fuentes and Jake Shields. The group aimed to protest a Turning Point USA convention but was denied entrance to the event. Duke had expressed his support for Fuentes and others who opposed a purported &quot;Jewish supremacism&quot;.

== Other affiliations and associations ==
=== &quot;Stormfront&quot; ===
In 1995, Don Black and Chloê Hardin, Duke&#x27;s ex-wife, began a bulletin board system (BBS) called &quot;Stormfront&quot;. The website has become a prominent online forum for white nationalism, white separatism, Holocaust denial, neo-Nazism, hate speech, and racism. Duke is an active user of &quot;Stormfront&quot;, where he posts articles from his website and polls forum members for opinions and questions. He has worked with Black on numerous occasions, including on Operation Red Dog (the attempted overthrowing of Dominica&#x27;s government) in 1980. Duke continued to be involved with the website&#x27;s radio station in 2019.

=== British National Party ===
In 2000, Nick Griffin (then leader of the British National Party in the United Kingdom) met with Duke at a seminar with the American Friends of the British National Party. Griffin said: &quot;instead of talking about racial purity, we talk about identity … that means basically to use the saleable words, as I say, freedom, security, identity, democracy. Nobody can criticize them. Nobody can come at you and attack you on those ideas. They are saleable.&quot;

This was widely reported in the media of the United Kingdom, as was the meeting between Duke and Griffin, following the party&#x27;s electoral successes in 2009.

===Alt-right===
Duke has written in praise of the alt-right, calling one broadcast &quot;fun and interesting&quot; and another a &quot;great show&quot;. People for the American Way reported Duke championing the alt-right. Duke described them as &quot;our people&quot; when describing their role in Donald Trump&#x27;s election as president.

There are also claims that while he is not an active member of the alt-right, Duke is an inspiration for the movement. The &quot;International Business Times&quot; wrote that he had &quot;&#x27;Zieg-heiling acolytes in the so-called &#x27;alt-right&#x27;&quot;. &quot;The Forward&quot; has said that Duke &quot;paved the way&quot; for the alt-right movement.

== Legal difficulties and felony conviction ==
===Tax fraud conviction and defrauding followers===
On December 12, 2002, Duke pleaded guilty to the felony charge of filing a false tax return under and mail fraud under According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;: &quot;Mr. Duke was accused of telling supporters that he was in financial straits, then misusing the money they sent him from 1993 to 1999. He was also accused of filing a false 1998 tax return... Mr. Duke used the money for personal investments and gambling trips... [T]he [supporter] contributions were as small as $5 and [according to the United States attorney, Jim Letten] there were so many that returning the money would be &#x27;unwieldy.&#x27;&quot;

Four months later, Duke was sentenced to 15 months in prison. He served the time in Big Spring, Texas. He was also fined $10,000 and ordered to cooperate with the Internal Revenue Service and pay money still owed for his 1998 taxes. After his release in May 2004, Duke said his decision to take the plea bargain was motivated by bias he perceived in the United States federal court system, not his guilt. He said he felt the charges were contrived to derail his political career and discredit him to his followers, and that he took the safe route by pleading guilty and receiving a mitigated sentence rather than pleading not guilty and potentially receiving the full sentence.

The mail fraud charges stemmed from what prosecutors described as a six-year scheme to dupe thousands of his followers by asking for donations. Using the postal service, Duke appealed to his supporters for funds by falsely saying he was about to lose his house and life savings. Prosecutors alleged that Duke raised hundreds of thousands of dollars this way. Prosecutors also stipulated that in contrast to what he wrote in the mailings, he sold his home at a hefty profit, had multiple investment accounts, and spent much of his money gambling at casinos.

=== 2009 arrest in the Czech Republic ===

In April 2009, Duke traveled to the Czech Republic on an invitation from a Czech neo-Nazi group, &quot;Národní Odpor&quot; (&quot;National Resistance&quot;) to deliver three lectures in Prague and Brno promoting the Czech translation of his book &quot;My Awakening&quot;.

He was arrested on April 23 on suspicion of &quot;denying or approving of the Nazi genocide and other Nazi crimes&quot; and &quot;promotion of movements seeking suppression of human rights&quot;, which are crimes in the Czech Republic punishable by up to three years&#x27; imprisonment. At the time of his arrest, Duke was reportedly guarded by members of the &quot;Národní Odpor&quot;. The police released him early on April 25 on condition that he leave the country by midnight that day.

Duke&#x27;s first lecture had been scheduled at Charles University in Prague, but it was canceled after university officials learned that neo-Nazis were planning to attend. Some Czech politicians, including Interior Minister Ivan Langer and Human Rights and Minorities Minister Michael Kocáb, had previously expressed opposition to allowing Duke into the Czech Republic.

In September 2009, the office of the District Prosecutor for Prague dropped all charges, explaining that there was no evidence that Duke had committed any crime.

=== 2013 expulsion from Italy; Schengen Area ban ===
In 2013, an Italian court ruled in favor of expelling Duke from Italy. Then 63, Duke was living in the mountain village Valle di Cadore in northern Italy. Although he had been issued a visa to live there by the Italian embassy in Malta, Italian police later found that Switzerland had issued a residence ban against Duke that applied throughout Europe&#x27;s Schengen Area.

== Other publications ==
To raise money in 1976, Duke (using the double pseudonym James Konrad and Dorothy Vanderbilt) wrote a self-help book for women, &quot;Finders-Keepers: Finding and Keeping the Man You Want&quot;. The book contains sexual, diet, fashion, cosmetic and relationship advice, and was published by Arlington Place Books, an offshoot of the National Socialist White People&#x27;s Party. Tulane University history professor Lawrence N. Powell, who read a rare copy of the book given to him by journalist Patsy Sims, wrote that it includes advice on vaginal exercises and oral and anal sex and advocates adultery. The Klan was shocked by Duke&#x27;s writing. According to journalist Tyler Bridges, &quot;The Times-Picayune&quot; obtained a copy and traced it to Duke, who compiled the content from women&#x27;s self-help magazines. Duke has admitted using the pseudonym Konrad.

In the 1970s, under the pseudonym Mohammed X, Duke wrote &quot;African Atto&quot;, a martial arts guide for black militants; he claimed it was a means of developing a mailing list to keep watch over such activists.

==Personal life==
While working in the White Youth Alliance, Duke met Chloê Eleanor Hardin, who was also active in the group. They remained companions throughout college and married in 1974. Hardin is the mother of Duke&#x27;s two daughters. The Dukes divorced in 1984, and Chloe moved to West Palm Beach, Florida, in order to be near her parents. There, she became involved with Duke&#x27;s Klan friend Don Black, whom she later married, and they began a small bulletin board system (BBS) called Stormfront, which has become a prominent online forum for white nationalism, Neo-Nazism, hate speech, racism, and antisemitism in the early 21st century.

Duke rented an apartment in Moscow beginning around 1999. He lived in Russia for five years. He now resides in Mandeville, Louisiana.

== In the media ==
Topher Grace portrays Duke in Spike Lee&#x27;s 2018 film &quot;BlacKkKlansman&quot;. Duke was banned from Facebook in 2018, over a year after his participation in the Unite the Right rally. Duke was banned from YouTube in 2020 for repeatedly violating its policies against hate speech, along with Richard Spencer and Stefan Molyneux. Duke&#x27;s Twitter account was permanently suspended in 2020 for violating the company&#x27;s rules on hateful conduct.

== Early life ==
Wong was born on January 21, 1922, and raised in San Francisco; she was the fifth daughter of an immigrant family from Guangdong, China, which grew to have nine children. She was raised with the traditional beliefs and customs of Chinese culture which her family and her elders imposed upon her.

Wong first attended San Francisco Junior College, and later Mills College, where she majored in economics and sociology in the hopes of becoming a social worker in Chinatown. Wong graduated from Mills College in 1942 with a Phi Beta Kappa key. While at Mills, she discovered a talent for ceramics in a summer course and joined a Ceramics Guild associated with the college. Wong also worked as a secretary during World War II.

==Artistic work ==

Wong&#x27;s career in pottery took off after she convinced a merchant on Grant Avenue in Chinatown, San Francisco, to allow her to put her workshop in his store window. Artist Win Ng (1936–1991) had studied under Wong when he was a teenager.

Her ceramics were later displayed in art museums across the United States, including a 2002 exhibition at the Chinese Historical Society of America. They were also displayed at the M. H. de Young Memorial Museum in San Francisco, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, Art Institute of Chicago (a one-woman show), the Museum of Modern Art in New York City, the Smithsonian American Art Museum in Washington, D.C., and the Cincinnati Art Museum, as well as shows in Omaha, Nebraska, and Portland, Oregon. 

In addition to these shows across the United States, Wong&#x27;s ceramics have also been placed in the permanent collections of New York’s Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Detroit Institute of Arts, the Oakland Museum of California, the Joslyn Art Museum, and the International Ceramic Museum in Italy.

== Literary work==
In 1950, Wong published the first of her two autobiographical volumes, &quot;Fifth Chinese Daughter&quot;. The book described her troubles balancing her identity as an Asian American woman and her Chinese traditions. The book was translated into several Asian languages by the U.S. State Department, which sent her on a four-month speaking tour of Asia in 1953. &quot;I was sent,&quot; Wong wrote, &quot;because those Asian audiences who had read translations of &quot;Fifth Chinese Daughter&quot; did not believe a female born to poor Chinese immigrants could gain a toehold among prejudiced Americans.&quot; Her second volume, &quot;No Chinese Stranger,&quot; was published in 1975. The book described her trip across Asia during her speaking tour and her visits to the People’s Republic of China.

== Personal life ==

Wong married the artist Woodrow Ong in 1950; they worked together on their art and later managed a travel agency together. Throughout her lifetime, Wong worked with many organizations including the San Francisco Public Library, the Asian Art Museum of San Francisco, the Chinese Cultural Center, the Chinese Historical Society of America, and Mills College. Wong was recognized and awarded by Mills College with an Honorary Doctorate of Humane Arts in 1976. 
Wong died on March 16, 2006, at the age of 84 of cancer; she was survived by her two daughters, two sons, and four grandchildren.

==Diplomatic life==
As mentioned above in &quot;Literary Work&quot;, during the Cold War Period of the 1950s, Wong was chosen as to go on a diplomatic tour (&quot;good will mission&quot;) in Asia to exemplify the cultural and racial diversity of the U.S. democracy. The U.S. government chose her in part because she exemplified both Chinese and American values that would appeal to the overseas public, and had achieved the pinnacle of success in her career in the eyes of Americans. She attended under the Leaders&#x27; and Specialists&#x27; Exchange Program, created under the Smith-Mundt Act. She went in January 1953 for four months to visit Asian countries like Japan, Malaya, Thailand, and more. 

==In popular culture==
In 1976, PBS made a half-hour special for public television based on Wong’s first volume &quot;Fifth Chinese Daughter&quot;, called &quot;Jade Snow&quot;, in which she was played by actress Freda Foh Shen.

<doc id="456259" wikidata="Q5500864" url="?curid=456259" title="Freed–Hardeman University">
<text>Freed–Hardeman University is a private university associated with the Churches of Christ and located in Henderson, Tennessee. It is primarily undergraduate and residential. The university also serves some commuting, part-time and adult students on-campus and through distance-learning programs.

The university is governed by a board of trustees, all of whom are required to be members of Churches of Christ. Courses are offered by 12 academic departments in 5 colleges: Arts and Sciences, Biblical Studies, Business, Education and Behavioral Sciences, and the Honors College.

==History==

Freed–Hardeman traces its origin to the 1869 charter of a private high school and college for Henderson, the Henderson Male Institute. It was known at various times as the Henderson Masonic Male and Female Institute, West Tennessee Christian College, or Georgie Robertson Christian College. It was named Georgie Robertson Christian College after George Ann &quot;Georgie&quot; Robertson.

In the 1907 spring term Georgie Robertson Christian College closed. N. B. Hardeman, a Georgie Robertson Christian College alumnus, and A. G. Freed worked together to establish a new institution, the National Teachers&#x27; Normal and Business College to fill the educational void created in Henderson by the closing. The NTNBC was incorporated on May 21, 1907, but classes did not start until the fall of 1908. In 1919, it was renamed Freed–Hardeman College in honor of its founders. In February 1990, it became Freed–Hardeman University.

The college did not accept African-American students until 1964, when its president, Hubert A. Dixon, stated that black students would be admitted in response &quot;to the mistake of accepting federal funds&quot;. The first black graduate was Elizabeth Saunders in 1967.

The university offers courses outside of the Henderson area in Memphis, Tennessee. It also offers European study abroad programs based at the FHU facility in Verviers, Belgium. Other opportunities include programs in Spain, Israel, Costa Rica, New York City, Canada, and Seoul.

The university was granted an exception to Title IX in 2016 allowing discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity where conflict exists with religious tenets.

During the 2019–2020 academic year, the university celebrated its 150th anniversary and a volume of university history, &quot;By the Grace of God: The Story of Freed–Hardeman University&quot;, was published.

==Campus buildings==

Loyd Auditorium is the main auditorium on campus and is used for Daily Chapel, FHU Lectureships, sports banquets, and the annual Homecoming Play.

The Hope Barber Shull Academic Resource Center, opened in 2016, houses the Loden-Daniel Library, a café, and other resources. 

Opposite Old Main is Crews Colbert Activity Center. It has two theaters, &quot;Maroon Theater&quot; and &quot;Gold Theater&quot;, and a large activity room used for activities and meetings.

==Student life==
Freed–Hardeman does not have fraternities and sororities in the traditional sense. Instead, the university has co-educational social clubs. These are local only to Freed–Hardeman and have no connection to any national Greek system. Students participate in intramural sports, club meetings and devotionals with their respective clubs.
Social Clubs: Sigma Rho (ΣΡ), Phi Kappa Alpha (ΦΚΑ), Omega Chi (ΩΧ), Chi Beta Chi (ΧΒΧ), Xi Chi Delta (ΞΧΔ)

==Rankings==
&quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; included the university in its affordability ranking (&quot;Great Schools, Great Prices&quot;), listing it 13th among Southern master&#x27;s degree-granting universities. The university reported a 44% acceptance rate of applicants for the fall 2012 semester.

The university is ranked among the &quot;Absolute Worst Campuses for LGBTQ Youth&quot; by &quot;Campus Pride&quot;.

==Athletics==
The Freed–Hardeman sports teams are called the &quot;Lions&quot; and &quot;Lady Lions&quot;. The university is a member of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA), primarily competing in the Mid-South Conference (MSC) since the 2020–21 academic year. The Lions and Lady Lions previously competed in the American Midwest Conference from 2013–14 to 2019–20, in the TranSouth Athletic Conference (TranSouth or TSAC) from 1996–97 to 2012–13 and in the Tennessee Collegiate Athletic Conference (TCAC) from 1986–87 to 1995–96.

Freed–Hardeman competes in 16 intercollegiate varsity sports. Men&#x27;s sports include baseball, basketball, cross country, golf, soccer, tennis and track &amp; field. Women&#x27;s sports include basketball, cheerleading, cross country, golf, soccer, softball, tennis, track &amp; field and volleyball.

===Men&#x27;s basketball===

<text>Bernardino de la Trinidad González Rivadavia (May 20, 1780 – September 2, 1845) was the first President of Argentina, then called the United Provinces of the Río de la Plata, from February 8, 1826 to June 27, 1827.

He was educated at the Royal College of San Carlos, but left without finishing his studies. During the British Invasions he served as Third Lieutenant of the Galicia Volunteers. He participated in the open Cabildo on May 22, 1810 voting for the deposition of the viceroy. He had a strong influence on the First Triumvirate and shortly after he served as Minister of Government and Foreign Affairs of the Province of Buenos Aires.

Although there was a General Congress intended to draft a constitution, the beginning of the War with Brazil led to the immediate establishment of the office of President of Argentina; with Rivadavia being the first to be named to the post. Argentina&#x27;s Constitution of 1826 was promulgated later, but was rejected by the provinces. Strongly contested by his political party, Rivadavia resigned and was succeeded by Vicente López y Planes.

Rivadavia retired to Spain, where he died in 1845. His remains were repatriated to Argentina in 1857, receiving honors as Captain General. His remains are in a mausoleum in Plaza Miserere, adjacent to Rivadavia Avenue, named after him.

==Biography==
=== Early life ===
Rivadavia was born in Buenos Aires on May 20, 1780, the fourth son of Benito Bernardino González de Rivadavia, a wealthy Spanish lawyer, and his first wife, María Josefa de Jesús Rodríguez de Rivadeneyra. Both parents were born in the Galician town of Monforte de Lemos. Because of his dark appearance it has been alleged Rivadavia had African ancestry. On December 14, 1809, Bernardino Rivadavia married Juana del Pino y Vera Mujica, daughter of the viceroy of the Río de la Plata, Joaquín del Pino and his second wife, the vicereine Rafaela Francisca de Vera Mujica y López Pintado. His military appointment was rejected by Mariano Moreno.

=== Career ===
Rivadavia was active in both the Argentine resistance to the British invasion of 1806 and in the May Revolution movement for Argentine Independence in 1810. In 1811, Rivadavia became the dominant member of the governing triumvirate as Secretary of the Treasury and Secretary of War. Until its fall in October 1812, this government focused on creating a strong central government, moderating relations with Spain, and organizing an army.

By 1814 the Spanish King Ferdinand VII had returned to the throne and started the Absolutist Restoration, which had grave consequences for the governments in the Americas. Manuel Belgrano and Rivadavia were sent to Europe to seek support for the United Provinces from both Spain and Britain. They sought to promote the crowning of Francisco de Paula, son of Charles IV of Spain, as regent of the United Provinces, but in the end he refused to act against the interests of the King of Spain. The diplomatic mission was a failure, both in Spain and in Britain. He visited France as well, and returned to Buenos Aires in 1821, at their friends&#x27; request.

During his stay in Britain, Rivadavia saw the growing development of the Industrial Revolution, and the rise of Romanticism. He sought to promote a similar development in Buenos Aires, and invited many people to move to the city. He convinced Aimé Bonpland to visit the country, but few other invitations were accepted.

In June 1821, he was named minister of government to Buenos Aires by governor Martín Rodríguez. Over the next five years, he exerted a strong influence, and focused heavily on improving the city of Buenos Aires, often at the expense of greater Argentina. To make the former look more European, Rivadavia constructed large avenues, schools, paved and lighted streets. He founded the University of Buenos Aires, as well as the Theatre, Geology, and Medicine Academies and the continent&#x27;s first museum of natural science.

He persuaded the legislature to authorize a one-million pound loan for public works that were never undertaken. The provincial bonds were sold in London through the Baring Brothers Bank, local and Buenos Aires-based British traders also acting as financial intermediaries. The borrowed money was in turn lent to these businessmen, who never repaid it. Of the original million pounds the Buenos Aires government received only £552,700. The province&#x27;s foreign debt was transferred to the nation in 1825, its final repayment being made in 1904.

A strong supporter of a powerful, centralized government in Argentina, Rivadavia often faced violent resistance from the opposition federalists. In 1826, Rivadavia was elected the first President of Argentina. During his term he founded many museums, and expanded the national library.

===Presidency===
His government had many problems, primarily an ongoing war with Brazil over territory in modern Uruguay and resistance from provincial authorities. Faced with the rising power of the Federalist Party and with several provinces in open revolt, Rivadavia submitted his resignation on June 27, 1827. He was succeeded by Vicente López y Planes. At first he returned to private life, but fled to exile in Europe in 1829.

Rivadavia returned to Argentina in 1834 to confront his political enemies, but was immediately sentenced again to exile. He went first to Brazil and then to Spain, where he died on September 2, 1845. He asked that his body would never be brought back to Buenos Aires. However, his remains were repatriated to Argentina in 1857, receiving honors from Captain General. At present they rest in a mausoleum located in the Plaza Miserere, in Buenos Aires, adjacent to Rivadavia Avenue, named in their honor.

==Legacy==

Rivadavia is recognized as the first president of Argentina, even though his rule was accepted only in Buenos Aires, he did not complete a full mandate, there was no constitution for more than half of his rule, and did not start a presidential succession line. The chair of the President of Argentina is known as the &quot;chair of Rivadavia&quot;, but only metaphorically: Rivadavia took everything when he left office, including the chair, which could never be retrieved.

Liberal historians praise Rivadavia as a great historical man, for his work improving education, culture and separation of church and state. Revisionist authors condemn his Anglophilia, the weak customs barriers that allowed the entry of big British imports, harming the weak Argentine economy of the time, and the Baring Brothers loan that started the Argentine external debt.

<doc id="456266" wikidata="Q16973802" url="?curid=456266" title="Direct-drive turntable">
<text>A direct-drive turntable is one of the three main phonograph designs currently being produced. The other styles are the belt-drive turntable and the idler-wheel type. Each name is based upon the type of coupling used between the platter of the turntable and the motor.

Direct-drive turntables are currently the most popular phonographs, due to their widespread use for turntablism in DJ culture. Panasonic&#x27;s Technics series were the first direct-drive turntables, and remain the most popular series of turntables.

== Design ==
In a direct-drive turntable the motor is located directly under the center of the platter and is connected to the platter directly. It is a significant advancement over older belt-drive turntables for turntablism, since they have a slower start-up time and torque, and are prone to wear-and-tear and breakage, as the belt would break from backspinning or scratching. A direct-drive turntable eliminates belts, and instead employs a motor to directly drive a platter on which a vinyl record rests. This makes scratching possible, as the motor would continue to spin at the correct RPM even if the DJ wiggles the record back and forth on the platter.

On the other hand, direct-drive turntables may suffer from vibration due to the motor, which is less of an issue for belt-drive turntables. However, in recent years, shock-absorbing (less dense) material, placed between the motor and platter, has been used to cut back on vibrations. The torque on direct-drive turntables is usually much higher than on belt drive models. This means the platter speed is less susceptible to outside forces (stylus, hand). Higher torque also means the platter will accelerate to its proper speed faster so less distortion is heard when the record begins to play.

Some direct-drive turntables further reduce the separation of motor and platter by using the platter itself as the rotor in the turntable&#x27;s synchronous motor. This means that there is no motor, per se, in the turntable - the platter is entirely driven by the magnetic field induced by the turntable&#x27;s stator.

In all turntables a motor spins a metal disk at a constant speed. On top of the rotating disk (platter) is a mat and on top of the mat records are placed to be played. Traditionally rubber mats were used to hold the record in place so that it would not rotate independently of the platter. To allow for easy scratching and more tricks DJs use slipmats to reduce the friction between the spinning platter and record. The slipmat is often made of a felt-like material. This way a DJ can scratch the record while the platter continues to spin underneath. In direct-drive turntables, the slipmat also helps isolate the record from motor vibrations that would be picked up by the stylus.

Turntables for DJ use also include a pitch control, for fine tuning to the correct speed, used in conjunction with a strobe light, plus it also allows a DJ to mix using a technique known as beatmatching. From the late 1990s onwards manufacturers such as Vestax started to include other electronic controls such as reverse, and &quot;nudge&quot;.

DJs and turntablists use all the above functions to assist them in musical performances.

==History==
The first direct-drive turntable was invented by Shuichi Obata, an engineer at Matsushita (now Panasonic), based in Osaka, Japan. It eliminated belts, and instead employed a motor to directly drive a platter on which a vinyl record rests. In 1969, Matsushita released it as the SP-10, the first direct-drive turntable on the market, and the first in their influential Technics series of turntables. In 1971, Matsushita released the Technics SL-1100. Due to its strong motor, durability, and fidelity, it was adopted by early hip hop artists.

A forefather of turntablism was DJ Kool Herc, an immigrant from Jamaica to New York City. He introduced turntable techniques from Jamaican dub music, while developing new techniques made possible by the direct-drive turntable technology of the Technics SL-1100, which he used for the first sound system he set up after emigrating to New York. The signature technique he developed was playing two copies of the same record on two turntables in alternation to extend the b-dancers&#x27; favorite section, switching back and forth between the two to loop the breaks to a rhythmic beat.

The most influential turntable was the Technics SL-1200, which was developed in 1971 by a team led by Shuichi Obata at Matsushita, which then released it onto the market in 1972. It was adopted by New York City hip hop DJs such as Grand Wizzard Theodore and Afrika Bambaataa in the 1970s. As they experimented with the SL-1200 decks, they developed scratching techniques when they found that the motor would continue to spin at the correct RPM even if the DJ wiggled the record back and forth on the platter. Since then, turntablism spread widely in hip hop culture, and the SL-1200 remained the most widely used turntable in DJ culture for the next several decades.

Technics also introduced the first direct-drive tangential-arm turntable, the model SL-10, in 1981.

<text>Stellar dynamics is the branch of astrophysics which describes in a statistical way the collective motions of stars subject to their mutual gravity. The essential difference from celestial mechanics is that the number of body formula_1

Typical galaxies have upwards of millions of macroscopic gravitating bodies and countless number of neutrinos and perhaps other dark microscopic bodies. Also each star contributes more or less equally to the total gravitational field, whereas in celestial mechanics the pull of a massive body dominates any satellite orbits.

== Connection with fluid dynamics ==
Stellar dynamics also has connections to the field of plasma physics. The two fields underwent significant development during a similar time period in the early 20th century, and both borrow mathematical formalism originally developed in the field of fluid mechanics.

In accretion disks and stellar surfaces, the dense plasma or gas particles collide very frequently, and collisions result in equipartition and perhaps viscosity under magnetic field. We see various sizes for accretion disks and stellar atmosphere, both made of enormous number of microscopic particle mass,

*formula_3 at stellar surfaces,
*formula_4 around Sun-like stars or km-sized stellar black holes, 
*formula_5 around million solar mass black holes (about AU-sized) in centres of galaxies.

The system crossing time scale is long in stellar dynamics, where it is handy to note that

formula_6

The long timescale means that, unlike gas particles in accretion disks, stars in galaxy disks very rarely see a collision in their stellar lifetime. However, galaxies collide occasionally in galaxy clusters, and stars have close encounters occasionally in star clusters.

As a rule of thumb, the typical scales concerned (see the Upper Portion of P.C.Budassi&#x27;s Logarithmic Map of the Universe) are formula_2
*formula_8 for M13 Star Cluster, 
*formula_9 for M31 Disk Galaxy, 
*formula_10 for neutrinos in the Bullet Clusters, which is a merging system of &quot;N&quot; = 1000 galaxies.

At a superficial level, all of stellar dynamics might be formulated as an N-body problem
by Newton&#x27;s second law, where the equation of motion (EOM) for internal interactions of an isolated stellar system of N members can be written down as,
formula_11
Here in the N-body system, any individual member, formula_12 is influenced by the gravitational potentials of the remaining formula_13 members.

In practice, except for in the highest performance computer simulations, it is not feasible to calculate rigorously the future of a large N system this way. Also this EOM gives very little intuition. Historically, the methods utilised in stellar dynamics originated from the fields of both classical mechanics and statistical mechanics. In essence, the fundamental problem of stellar dynamics is the N-body problem, where the N members refer to the members of a given stellar system. Given the large number of objects in a stellar system, stellar dynamics can address both the global, statistical properties of many orbits as well as the specific data on the positions and velocities of individual orbits.

== Concept of a gravitational potential field ==
Stellar dynamics involves determining the gravitational potential of a substantial number of stars. The stars can be modeled as point masses whose orbits are determined by the combined interactions with each other. Typically, these point masses represent stars in a variety of clusters or galaxies, such as a Galaxy cluster, or a Globular cluster. Without getting a system&#x27;s gravitational potential by adding all of the point-mass potentials in the system at every second, stellar dynamicists develop potential models that can accurately model the system while remaining computationally inexpensive. The gravitational potential, formula_14, of a system is related to the acceleration and the gravitational field, formula_15 by:
formula_16
whereas the potential is related to a (smoothened) mass density, formula_17, via the Poisson&#x27;s equation in the integral form 
formula_18
or the more common differential form 
formula_19

=== An example of the Poisson Equation and escape speed in a uniform sphere ===

Consider an analytically smooth spherical potential
formula_20
where formula_21 takes the meaning of the speed to &quot;escape to the edge&quot; formula_22, and formula_23 is the speed to &quot;escape from the edge to infinity&quot;. The gravity is like the restoring force of harmonic oscillator inside the sphere, and Keplerian outside as described by the Heaviside functions.

We can fix the normalisation formula_24 by computing the corresponding density using the spherical Poisson Equation
formula_25
where the enclosed mass 
formula_26

Hence the potential model corresponds to a uniform sphere of radius formula_27, total mass formula_28 with
formula_29

=== Key concepts ===
While both the equations of motion and Poisson Equation can also take on non-spherical forms, depending on the coordinate system and the symmetry of the physical system, the essence is the same: 
The motions of stars in a galaxy or in a globular cluster are principally determined by the average distribution of the other, distant stars. The infrequent stellar encounters involve processes such as relaxation, mass segregation, tidal forces, and dynamical friction that influence the trajectories of the system&#x27;s members.

== Relativistic Approximations ==

There are three related approximations made in the Newtonian EOM and Poisson Equation above.

=== SR and GR ===
Firstly above equations neglect relativistic corrections, which are of order of 
formula_30 as typical stellar 3-dimensional speed, formula_31 km/s, is much below the speed of light.

=== Eddington Limit ===
Secondly non-gravitational force is typically negligible in stellar systems. For example, in the vicinity of a typical star the ratio of radiation-to-gravity force on a hydrogen atom or ion,
formula_32
hence radiation force is negligible in general, except perhaps around a luminous O-type star of mass formula_33, or around a black hole accreting gas at the Eddington limit so that its luminosity-to-mass ratio formula_34 is defined by formula_35.

=== Loss cone ===
Thirdly a star can be swallowed if coming within a few Schwarzschild radii of the black hole. This radius of Loss is given by formula_36

The loss cone can be visualised by considering infalling particles aiming to the black hole within a small solid angle (a cone in velocity). 
These particle with small formula_37 have small angular momentum per unit mass formula_38 Their small angular momentum (due to ) does not make a high enough barrier near formula_39 to force the particle to turn around.

The effective potential 
formula_40 is always positive infinity in Newtonian gravity. However, in GR, it 
nosedives to minus infinity near formula_41 if formula_42

Sparing a rigorous GR treatment, one can verify this formula_43 by computing the last stable circular orbit, where the effective potential is at an inflection point formula_44 using an approximate classical potential of a Schwarzschild black hole 
formula_45 
== Tidal disruption radius ==

A star can be tidally torn by a heavier black hole when coming within the so-called Hill&#x27;s radius of the black hole, inside which a star&#x27;s surface gravity yields to the tidal force from the black hole, i.e.,

formula_46

For typical black holes of formula_47 the destruction radius formula_48 where 0.001pc is the stellar spacing in the densest stellar systems (e.g., the nuclear star cluster in the Milky Way centre). Hence (main sequence) stars are generally too compact internally and too far apart spaced to be disrupted by even the strongest black hole tides in galaxy or cluster environment.

== Radius of sphere of influence ==
A particle of mass formula_49 with a relative speed V will be deflected when entering the (much larger) cross section formula_50 of a black hole. This so-called sphere of influence is loosely defined by, up to a Q-like fudge factor formula_51, 
formula_52
hence for a Sun-like star we have, 
formula_53
i.e., stars will neither be tidally disrupted nor physically hit/swallowed in a typical encounter with the black hole thanks to the high surface escape speed formula_54 from any solar mass star, comparable to the internal speed between galaxies in the Bullet Cluster of galaxies, and greater than the typical internal speed formula_55 inside all star clusters and in galaxies.

== Connections between star loss cone and gravitational gas accretion physics ==
First consider a heavy black hole of mass formula_56 is moving through a dissipational gas of (rescaled) thermal sound speed formula_57 and density formula_58, then every gas particle of mass m will likely transfer its relative momentum formula_59 to the BH when coming within a cross-section of radius formula_60 
In a time scale formula_61 that the black hole loses half of its streaming velocity, its mass may double by Bondi accretion, a process of capturing most of gas particles that enter its sphere of influence formula_62, dissipate kinetic energy by gas collisions and fall in the black hole. The gas capture rate is 
formula_63 
where the polytropic index formula_64 is the sound speed in units of velocity dispersion squared, and the rescaled sound speed formula_65 allows us to match the Bondi spherical accretion rate, formula_66 for the adiabatic gas formula_67, compared to formula_68 of the isothermal case formula_69.

Coming back to star tidal disruption and star capture by a (moving) black hole, setting formula_70, we could summarise the BH&#x27;s growth rate from gas and stars, 
formula_71 with, 
formula_72 
because the black hole consumes a fractional/most part of star/gas particles passing its sphere of influence.

== Gravitational dynamical friction ==
Consider the case that a heavy black hole of mass formula_56 moves relative to a background of stars in random motion in 
a cluster of total mass formula_74 with a mean number density formula_75 within a typical size formula_76.

Intuition says that gravity causes the light bodies to accelerate and gain momentum and kinetic energy (see slingshot effect). By conservation of energy and momentum, we may conclude that the heavier body will be slowed by an amount to compensate. Since there is a loss of momentum and kinetic energy for the body under consideration, the effect is called dynamical friction.

After certain time of relaxations the heavy black hole&#x27;s kinetic energy should be in equal partition with the less-massive background objects. The slow-down of the black hole can be described as
formula_77
where formula_78 is called a dynamical friction time.

=== Dynamical friction time vs Crossing time in a virialised system ===
Consider a Mach-1 BH, which travels initially at the sound speed formula_79, hence its Bondi radius formula_62 satisfies 
formula_81
where 
the sound speed is formula_82 
with the prefactor formula_83 fixed by the fact that for a uniform spherical cluster of the mass density formula_84, half of a circular period is the time for &quot;sound&quot; to make a oneway crossing in its longest dimension, i.e., 
formula_85
It is customary to call the &quot;half-diameter&quot; crossing time formula_86 the dynamical time scale.

Assume the BH stops after traveling a length of formula_87 with its momentum formula_88 deposited to formula_89 stars in its path over formula_90 crossings, then 
the number of stars deflected by the BH&#x27;s Bondi cross section per &quot;diameter&quot; crossing time is
formula_91

More generally, the Equation of Motion of the BH at a general velocity formula_92 in the potential formula_93 of a sea of stars can be written as 
formula_94
formula_95 and the Coulomb logarithm modifying factor formula_96 discounts friction on a supersonic moving BH with mass formula_97. As a rule of thumb, it takes about a sound crossing formula_98 time to &quot;sink&quot; subsonic BHs, from the edge to the centre without overshooting, if they weigh more than 1/8th of the total cluster mass. Lighter and faster holes can stay afloat much longer.

=== More rigorous formulation of dynamical friction ===

The full Chandrasekhar dynamical friction formula for the change in velocity of the object involves integrating over the phase space density of the field of matter and is far from transparent.

It reads as
formula_99
where 
formula_100
is the number of particles in an infinitesimal cylindrical volume of length formula_101 and a cross-section formula_102 within the black hole&#x27;s sphere of influence.

Like the &quot;Couloumb logarithm&quot; formula_103 factors in the contribution of distant background particles, here the factor formula_104 also 
factors in the probability of finding a background slower-than-BH particle to contribute to the drag. The more particles are overtaken by the BH, the more particles drag the BH, and the greater is formula_105. Also the bigger the system, the greater is formula_103.

A background of elementary (gas or dark) particles can also induce dynamical friction, which scales with the mass density of the surrounding medium, formula_107; the lower particle mass m is compensated by the higher number density n. The more massive the object, the more matter will be pulled into the wake.

Summing up the gravitational drag of both collisional gas and collisionless stars, we have 
formula_108
Here the &quot;lagging-behind&quot; fraction for gas and for stars are given by 
formula_109
where the factor formula_110 is the number of handshakes between a pair of stars without double-counting, the mean pair separation formula_111 is only about 40\% of the radius of the uniform sphere.
Note also the similarity of the formula_112

=== Mean free path ===
The mean free path of strong encounters in a typically formula_113 stellar system is then
formula_114
i.e., it takes about formula_115 radius crossings for a typical star to come within a cross-section formula_116 to be deflected from its path completely. Hence the mean free time of a strong encounter is much longer than the crossing time formula_117.

=== Weak encounters ===
Weak encounters have a more profound effect on the evolution of a stellar system over the course of many passages. The effects of gravitational encounters can be studied with the concept of relaxation time. A simple example illustrating relaxation is two-body relaxation, where a star&#x27;s orbit is altered due to the gravitational interaction with another star.

Initially, the subject star travels along an orbit with initial velocity, formula_118, that is perpendicular to the impact parameter, the distance of closest approach, to the field star whose gravitational field will affect the original orbit. Using Newton&#x27;s laws, the change in the subject star&#x27;s velocity, formula_119, is approximately equal to the acceleration at the impact parameter, multiplied by the time duration of the acceleration.

The relaxation time can be thought as the time it takes for formula_119 to equal formula_118, or the time it takes for the small deviations in velocity to equal the star&#x27;s initial velocity. The number of &quot;half-diameter&quot; crossings for an average star to relax in a stellar system of formula_122 objects is approximately 
formula_123
from a more rigorous calculation than the above mean free time estimates for strong deflection.

The answer makes sense because there is no relaxation for a single body or 2-body system. A better approximation of the ratio of timescales is formula_124, hence the relaxation time for 3-body, 4-body, 5-body, 7-body, 10-body, ..., 42-body, 72-body, 140-body, 210-body, 550-body are about 16, 8, 6, 4, 3, ..., 3, 4, 6, 8, 16 crossings. There is no relaxation for an isolated binary, and the relaxation is the fastest for a 16-body system; it takes about 2.5 crossings for orbits to scatter each other. A system with formula_125 have much smoother potential, typically takes formula_126 weak encounters to build a strong deflection to change orbital energy significantly.

=== Relation between friction and relaxation ===
Clearly that the dynamical friction of a black hole is much faster than the relaxation time by roughly a factor formula_127, but these two are very similar for a cluster of black holes, 
formula_128

For a star cluster or galaxy cluster with, say, formula_129, we have formula_130. Hence encounters of members in these stellar or galaxy clusters are significant during the typical 10 Gyr lifetime.

On the other hand, typical galaxy with, say, formula_131 stars, would have a crossing time formula_132 and their relaxation time is much longer than the age of the Universe. This justifies modelling galaxy potentials with mathematically smooth functions, neglecting two-body encounters throughout the lifetime of typical galaxies. And inside such a typical galaxy the dynamical friction and accretion on stellar black holes over a 10-Gyr Hubble time change the black hole&#x27;s velocity and mass by only an insignificant fraction
formula_133

if the black hole makes up less than 0.1% of the total galaxy mass formula_134. Especially when formula_135, we see that a typical star never experiences an encounter, hence stays on its orbit in a smooth galaxy potential.

The dynamical friction or relaxation time identifies collisionless vs. collisional particle systems. Dynamics on timescales much less than the relaxation time is effectively collisionless because typical star will deviate from its initial orbit size by a tiny fraction formula_136. They are also identified as systems where subject stars interact with a smooth gravitational potential as opposed to the sum of point-mass potentials. The accumulated effects of two-body relaxation in a galaxy can lead to what is known as mass segregation, where more massive stars gather near the center of clusters, while the less massive ones are pushed towards the outer parts of the cluster.

=== A Spherical-Cow Summary of Continuity Eq. in Collisional and Collisionless Processes ===

Having gone through the details of the rather complex interactions of particles in a gravitational system, it is always helpful to zoom out and extract some generic theme, at an affordable price of rigour, so carry on with a lighter load.

First important concept is &quot;gravity balancing motion&quot; near the perturber and for the background as a whole 
formula_137 
by consistently &quot;omitting&quot; all factors of unity formula_138, formula_139, formula_140 etc for clarity, &quot;approximating&quot; the combined mass formula_141 and 
being &quot;ambiguous&quot; whether the &quot;geometry&quot; of the system is a thin/thick gas/stellar disk or a (non)-uniform stellar/dark sphere with or without a boundary, and about the &quot;subtle distinctions&quot; among the kinetic energies from the local Circular rotation speed formula_142, radial infall speed formula_143, globally isotropic or anisotropic random motion formula_144 in one or three directions, or the (non)-uniform isotropic Sound speed formula_145 to &quot;emphasize of the logic&quot; behind the order of magnitude of the friction time scale.

Second we can recap &quot;very loosely summarise&quot; the various processes so far of collisional and collisionless gas/star or dark matter by Spherical cow style &quot;Continuity Equation on any generic quantity Q&quot; of the system:
formula_146 
where the formula_147 sign is generally negative except for the (accreting) mass M, and the Mean free path formula_148 or the friction time formula_61 can be due to direct molecular viscosity from a physical collision Cross section, or due to gravitational scattering (bending/focusing/Sling shot) of particles; generally the influenced area is the greatest of the competing processes of Bondi accretion, Tidal disruption, and Loss cone capture,
formula_150

E.g., in case Q is the perturber&#x27;s mass formula_151, then we can estimate the Dynamical friction time via the (gas/star) Accretion rate 
formula_152 
where we have applied the relations motion-balancing-gravity.

In the limit the perturber is just 1 of the N background particle, formula_153, this friction time is identified with the (gravitational) Relaxation time. Again all Coulomb logarithm etc are suppressed without changing the estimations from these qualitative equations.

For the rest of Stellar dynamics, we will consistently work on &quot;precise&quot; calculations through primarily &quot;Worked Examples&quot;, by neglecting gravitational friction and relaxation of the perturber, working in the limit formula_154 as approximated true in most galaxies on the 14Gyrs Hubble time scale, even though this is sometimes violated for some clusters of stars or clusters of galaxies.of the cluster.

A concise 1-page summary of some main equations in Stellar dynamics and Accretion disc physics are shown here, where one attempts to be more rigorous on the qualitative equations above.

== Connections to statistical mechanics and plasma physics ==
The statistical nature of stellar dynamics originates from the application of the kinetic theory of gases to stellar systems by physicists such as James Jeans in the early 20th century. The Jeans equations, which describe the time evolution of a system of stars in a gravitational field, are analogous to Euler&#x27;s equations for an ideal fluid, and were derived from the collisionless Boltzmann equation. This was originally developed by Ludwig Boltzmann to describe the non-equilibrium behavior of a thermodynamic system. Similarly to statistical mechanics, stellar dynamics make use of distribution functions that encapsulate the information of a stellar system in a probabilistic manner. The single particle phase-space distribution function, formula_155, is defined in a way such that
formula_156
where formula_157 represents the probability of finding a given star with position formula_158 around a differential volume formula_159 and velocity formula_160 around a differential velocity space volume formula_161. The distribution function is normalized (sometimes) such that integrating it over all positions and velocities will equal N, the total number of bodies of the system. For collisional systems, Liouville&#x27;s theorem is applied to study the microstate of a stellar system, and is also commonly used to study the different statistical ensembles of statistical mechanics.

=== Convention and notation in case of a thermal distribution ===
In most of stellar dynamics literature, it is convenient to adopt the convention that the particle mass is unity in solar mass unit formula_162, hence a particle&#x27;s momentum and velocity are identical, i.e.,
formula_163

formula_164

For example, the thermal velocity distribution of air molecules (of typically 15 times the proton mass per molecule) in a room of constant temperature formula_165 would have a Maxwell distribution
formula_166
formula_167

where the energy per unit mass formula_168 where formula_169

and formula_170 is the width of the velocity Maxwell distribution, identical in each direction and everywhere in the room, and the normalisation constant formula_171 (assume the chemical potential formula_172 such that the Fermi-Dirac distribution reduces to a Maxwell velocity distribution) is fixed by the constant gas number density formula_173 at the floor level, where 
formula_174
formula_175

=== The CBE ===
In plasma physics, the collisionless Boltzmann equation is referred to as the Vlasov equation, which is used to study the time evolution of a plasma&#x27;s distribution function.

The Boltzmann equation is often written more generally with the Liouville operator formula_176 as
formula_177
formula_178
where formula_179 is the gravitational force and formula_180 is the Maxwell (equipartition) distribution (to fit the same density, same mean and rms velocity as formula_181). The equation means the non-Gaussianity will decay on a (relaxation) time scale of formula_182, and the system will ultimately relaxes to a Maxwell (equipartition) distribution.

Whereas Jeans applied the collisionless Boltzmann equation, along with Poisson&#x27;s equation, to a system of stars interacting via the long range force of gravity, Anatoly Vlasov applied Boltzmann&#x27;s equation with Maxwell&#x27;s equations to a system of particles interacting via the Coulomb Force. Both approaches separate themselves from the kinetic theory of gases by introducing long-range forces to study the long term evolution of a many particle system. In addition to the Vlasov equation, the concept of Landau damping in plasmas was applied to gravitational systems by Donald Lynden-Bell to describe the effects of damping in spherical stellar systems.

A nice property of f(t,x,v) is that many other dynamical quantities can be formed by its moments, e.g., the total mass, local density, pressure, and mean velocity. Applying the collisionless Boltzmann equation, these moments are then related by various forms of continuity equations, of which most notable are the Jeans equations and Virial theorem.

=== Probability-weighted moments and hydrostatic equilibrium ===
Jeans computed the weighted velocity of the Boltzmann Equation after integrating over velocity space formula_183 and obtain the Momentum (Jeans) Eqs. of a formula_184opulation (e.g., gas, stars, dark matter):

formula_185

The general version of Jeans equation, involving (3 x 3) velocity moments is cumbersome. 
It only becomes useful or solvable if we could drop some of these moments, especially drop the off-diagonal cross terms for systems of high symmetry, and also drop net rotation or net inflow speed everywhere.

The isotropic version is also called 
Hydrostatic equilibrium equation where balancing pressure gradient with gravity; the isotropic version works for axisymmetric disks as well, after replacing the derivative dr with vertical coordinate dz. It means that we could measure the gravity (of dark matter) by observing the gradients of the velocity dispersion and the number density of stars.

== Applications and examples ==

Stellar dynamics is primarily used to study the mass distributions within stellar systems and galaxies. Early examples of applying stellar dynamics to clusters include Albert Einstein&#x27;s 1921 paper applying the virial theorem to spherical star clusters and Fritz Zwicky&#x27;s 1933 paper applying the virial theorem specifically to the Coma Cluster, which was one of the original harbingers of the idea of dark matter in the universe. The Jeans equations have been used to understand different observational data of stellar motions in the Milky Way galaxy. For example, Jan Oort utilized the Jeans equations to determine the average matter density in the vicinity of the solar neighborhood, whereas the concept of asymmetric drift came from studying the Jeans equations in cylindrical coordinates.

Stellar dynamics also provides insight into the structure of galaxy formation and evolution. Dynamical models and observations are used to study the triaxial structure of elliptical galaxies and suggest that prominent spiral galaxies are created from galaxy mergers. Stellar dynamical models are also used to study the evolution of active galactic nuclei and their black holes, as well as to estimate the mass distribution of dark matter in galaxies.

=== A unified thick disk potential ===

Consider an oblate potential in cylindrical coordinates 
formula_186
where formula_187 are (positive) vertical and radial length scales. 
Despite its complexity, we can easily see some limiting properties of the model.

First we can see the total mass of the system is formula_188 because 
formula_189
when we take the large radii limit 
formula_190, so that formula_191 which implies formula_192, and formula_193 between zero and formula_24.

To verify the above formula_195 being constants of motion in our spherical potential, we note
formula_196

formula_197 for any &quot;steady state&quot; potential.

formula_198 which reduces to formula_199 around the z-axis of any axisymmetric potential, where formula_200.

Likewise the x and y components of the angular momentum are also conserved for a spherical potential. Hence formula_201.

So for any time-independent spherical potential (including our uniform sphere model), 
the orbital energy E and angular momentum J and its z-component Jz along every stellar orbit satisfy
formula_202

Hence using the chain rule, we have
formula_203
i.e., formula_204, so that CBE is satisfied, i.e., our 
formula_205
is a solution to the Collisionless Boltzmann Equation for our static spherical potential.

=== A worked example on moments of distribution functions in a uniform spherical cluster ===

We can find out various moments of the above distribution function, reformatted as with the help of three Heaviside functions, 
formula_206
as required by the Virial Theorem. For this self-gravitating sphere, we can also verify that the virial per unit mass equals the averages of half of the potential 
formula_207
Hence we have verified the validity of Virial Theorem for a uniform sphere under self-gravity, i.e., the gravity due to the mass density of the stars is also the gravity that stars move in self-consistently; no additional dark matter halo contributes to its potential, for example.

=== A worked example of Jeans Equation in a uniform sphere ===

Jeans Equation is a relation on how the pressure gradient of a system should be balancing the potential gradient for an equilibrium galaxy. In our uniform sphere, the potential gradient or gravity is
formula_208

The radial pressure gradient
formula_209

The reason for the discrepancy is partly due to centrifugal force
formula_210
and partly due to anisotropic pressure
formula_211
so formula_212 at the very centre, 
but the two balance at radius formula_213, and then 
reverse to formula_214 at the very edge.

Now we can verify that
formula_215
Here the 1st line above is essentially the Jeans equation in the r-direction, which reduces to the 2nd line, the Jeans equation in an anisotropic (aka formula_216) rotational (aka formula_217) axisymmetric (formula_218 ) sphere (aka formula_219) after much coordinate manipulations of the dispersion tensor; similar equation of motion can be obtained for the two tangential direction, e.g., formula_220, which are useful in modelling ocean currents on the rotating earth surface or angular momentum transfer in accretion disks, where the frictional term formula_221 is important. 
The fact that the l.h.s. formula_222 means that 
the force is balanced on the r.h.s. for this uniform (aka formula_223) spherical model of a galaxy (cluster) to stay in a steady state (aka time-independent equilibrium formula_224 everywhere) statically (aka with zero flow formula_225 everywhere). Note systems like accretion disk can have a steady net radial inflow formula_226 everywhere at all time.

=== A worked example of Jeans equation in a thick disk ===

Consider again the thick disk potential in the above example. 
If the density is that of a gas fluid, then the pressure would be zero at the boundary formula_227. To find the peak of the pressure, we note that 
formula_228

So the fluid temperature per unit mass, i.e., the 1-dimensional velocity dispersion squared would be 
formula_229

formula_230

Along the rotational z-axis, 
formula_231
formula_232
which is clearly the highest at the centre and zero at the boundaries formula_227. Both the pressure and the dispersion peak at the midplane formula_234. In fact the hottest and densest point is the centre, where formula_235

=== A recap on worked examples on Jeans Eq., Virial and Phase space density ===

Having looking at the a few applications of Poisson Eq. and Phase space density and especially the Jeans equation, we can extract a general theme, again using the Spherical cow approach.

Jeans equation links gravity with pressure gradient, it is a generalisation of the Eq. of Motion for single particles. While Jeans equation can be solved in disk systems, the most user-friendly version of the Jeans eq. is the spherical anisotropic version for a static formula_236 frictionless system formula_237, hence the local velocity speed 
formula_238 everywhere for each of the three directions formula_239.
One can project the phase space into these moments, which is easily if in a highly spherical system, which admits conservations of energy formula_240 and angular momentum J. The boundary of the system sets the integration range of the velocity bound in the system.

In summary, in the spherical Jeans eq., 
formula_241
which matches the expectation from the Virial theorem formula_242, 
or in other words, the formula_243 kinetic energy of an equilibrium equals the average kinetic energy on circular orbits with purely transverse motion.

<text>The New York City Department of Parks and Recreation, also called the Parks Department or NYC Parks, is the department of the government of New York City responsible for maintaining the city&#x27;s parks system, preserving and maintaining the ecological diversity of the city&#x27;s natural areas, and furnishing recreational opportunities for city&#x27;s residents and visitors.

NYC Parks maintains more than 1,700 public spaces, including parks, playgrounds and recreational facilities, across the city&#x27;s five boroughs. It is responsible for over 1,000 playgrounds, 800 playing fields, 550 tennis courts, 35 major recreation centers, 66 pools, of beaches, and 13 golf courses, as well as 7 nature centers, 6 ice skating rinks, over 2,000 greenstreets, and 4 major stadiums. NYC Parks also cares for park flora and fauna, community gardens, 23 historic houses, over 1,200 statues and monuments, and more than 2.5 million trees. The total area of the properties maintained by the department is over . The largest single component of parkland maintained by the department is the Pelham Bay Park in the Bronx. Other large parks administered by NYC Parks include Central Park in Manhattan, Prospect Park in Brooklyn, Van Cortlandt Park in the Bronx, Flushing Meadows–Corona Park in Queens, and the Staten Island Greenbelt.

NYC Parks produces many special events, including concerts and movie premieres. In the summer, the busiest season, the agency organizes free carnivals and concerts, and sends mobile recreation vans to travel throughout the five boroughs providing free rental equipment for skating, baseball, and miniature golf.

The symbol of the department is a cross between the leaf of the London plane and a maple leaf. It is prominently featured on signs and buildings in public parks across the city. The London plane tree is on NYC Parks&#x27; list of restricted use species for street tree planting because it constitutes more than 10% of all street trees.

==Agency==
The department is a mayoral agency, headed by a commissioner who reports to the Deputy Mayor of Operations. The current Parks Commissioner is Susan Donoghue, who was appointed on February 4, 2022. The current chair of the New York City Council Committee on Parks &amp; Recreation is Shekar Krishnan.

The department is allocated an expense budget and a capital budget. The expense budget covers the total expenses incurred by the agency, including salaries. The capital budget is dedicated solely for new construction projects, as well as major repairs in parks that have a useful life of more than five years and cost at least $35,000.

Its regulations are compiled in Title 56 of the &quot;New York City Rules&quot;.

===History===
The original Parks Commission was formed in 1856 and was responsible only for Central Park. In 1870 the Tweed Charter gave it jurisdiction for all the parks in Manhattan. In addition, each borough had its independent Park Commission.

The history of the Park Enforcement Patrol Officers can be traced back to 1919, when the concept of the Parks Enforcement Patrol was first thought of by Bronx Parks Commissioner Joe Hennessy, who reported in the &quot;1919 Annual Report of the Department of Parks&quot; the &quot;necessity of a proper protective force&quot; to be established. The following year in his 1920 annual report to the mayor, Commissioner Hennessy once again pushed for a full-time park police force. On page 16 of the 1920 annual report, he wrote that &quot;Vandalism is ever present. It can never be checked until the Parks Department has a force of keepers with police authority&quot; and he recommended that the &quot;Park protectors should be under control of Park Commissioners absolutely&quot;. In 1920, legislature was passed for the creation of a force of park keepers for NYC parks but the city refused to approve it and authorize funding.

In an effort to show the mayor the effectiveness of a park patrol force in hopes of having a full-time force established, Commissioner Hennessy created volunteer park inspectors (later called &quot;Auxiliary Park Inspectors&quot;) to patrol the Bronx parks during the day. According to his &quot;1919 annual report of the Department of Parks&quot;, the first park inspector he appointed was Inspector William Blackie. Inspector Blackie was injured on Columbus Day 1919 while attempting to arrest two men poaching song birds in Van Cortlandt Park.

Despite the objection of the New York City Police Department, Commissioner Hennessy established the first Park Patrol Harbor unit when he obtained two small motor boats from the Navy which he immediately put into service and had park staff patrol the waterways of the Hutchinson River.

In 1922, Commissioner Henessy (through his annual report) requested the mayor to establish special magistrates to deal with park related violations the same day the violator was arrested, provide police authority to the parks commissioners (each borough had a commissioner), and provide funding for a park patrol unit because the New York City Police officers &quot;detailed to the Bronx parks in the summer on Saturdays, Sundays and holidays are not anxious to serve summonses or enforce the ordinances&quot;

A unified citywide New York City Parks Department was formed in 1934 with Robert Moses as the commissioner, a position he held until 1960. In 1968 it was reorganized as the &quot;Parks, Recreation &amp; Cultural Affairs Administration. In 1976 it was given its current name.

In 2001, the department underwent an investigation after the U.S. Attorney&#x27;s Office received complaints from employees that they had suffered employment discrimination. The lawsuit alleged that NYC Parks violated the Civil Rights Act of 1964; according to the complaint, the NYC Parks&#x27; senior managers sought out and promoted whites to management positions without announcing job openings for those positions or conducting any formal interview processes. The complaint also said that since at least 1995, minorities have been significantly under-represented in NYC Parks&#x27; managerial ranks. In 2008, the City of New York agreed to pay a $21 million settlement to avoid going to trial.

==Parks Enforcement Patrol==

The department maintains an enforcement division, called the Parks Enforcement Patrol (PEP), responsible for maintaining safety and security within the parks system. Parks Enforcement Patrol officers are employed as NYC special patrolmen and have very limited peace officer status under NYS Penal Law. They are empowered through this status to make arrests and issue summons for park related offenses at new york city parks only. PEP officers patrol land, waterways and buildings under the jurisdiction of the Department of Parks and Recreation on foot, bicycle, horseback, boat and marked patrol trucks. PEP officers are also responsible for physical site inspections of NYC park concession facilities to assure the concessionaires compliance with state laws.

The New York City Police Department (NYPD) is the primary law enforcement agency whose mission is to provided police patrol service and investigate all crimes that occur within New York City, which includes parks areas and facilities.

=== Ranks ===
There are seven ranks of officers in the New York City Department of Parks &amp; Recreation, Parks Enforcement Patrol:
=== Power, authority and equipment ===
New York City park enforcement officers are special patrolmen in connection with special duties of employment. They have very limited Peace Officers authority pursuant to New York State Criminal Procedure Law § 2.10(27) as listed in Chapter 13 subsection (C): Special Patrolmen.

=== Mounted auxiliary unit ===
Formed in 1996, the NYC Parks Enforcement Patrol Mounted Auxiliary Unit is a volunteer unit within the department. This unit is made up of private citizens who volunteer their time by working with officers of the Parks Enforcement Patrol.

Auxiliary officers patrol in uniform and on horseback in various NYC parks, and &quot;ensure the preservation of the natural and living resources in the city&#x27;s parks, as well as the safety of those utilizing the parks, by maintaining a clearly visible presence. They monitor areas that are not accessible by vehicle; they deter, identify and report illegal or unsafe activities that require Parks Enforcement Patrol or police attention; and they advise the public on park rules and regulations.&quot;

As an IRS 501C Corporation, the Auxiliary solicits funding to purchase horses, tack and provide training for both the Volunteers and the Professional Officers. Since inception it has provided several hundred thousand dollars towards the operation of the Mounted Unit, including the Capital Construction of a new barn. Former Parks Commissioner Adrian Benepe was quoted as saying &quot;there is some doubt that the Parks Department could afford to run a mounted unit without the Mounted Auxiliary.&quot;

Auxiliary officers do not have powers beyond a citizen and cannot make arrests. For this reason a typical patrol will include a PEP Officer and an Auxiliary Officer. By combining the two, the manpower of the Parks Enforcement Patrol is significantly increased at no cost to the city. Should the team come upon a situation requiring enforcement, the PEP Officer can deal with it while the Auxiliary Officer covers the Officer&#x27;s back and radios the situation to Parks Central and if needed will ask for additional help. 

== Union representation ==
Urban Park Rangers and Associate Urban Park Rangers (Sergeants) are represented by DC37 Local 983, a civil service employees union. The union is currently headed by President Joseph Puleo.

===Park Security Service===
The PEP also have a security trained service that provide participants with experience needed for future employment in the private sector.

==Urban Park Rangers==
The Urban Park Rangers was founded as a pilot program in 1979 by then Parks Commissioner Gordon J. Davis, with the support and encouragement of Mayor Ed Koch. The program provides many free programs year-round, such as nature walks and activities. They also operate programs such as &quot;The Natural Classroom&quot; for class trips and the general public alike. &quot;Explorer&quot; programs are available for activities such as canoeing in the city&#x27;s flagship parks in all five boroughs. NYC Urban Park Rangers are easily identified by their uniforms.

Although NYC Park Rangers possess peace officer status, their primary mission is environmental education, protection of park resources, and visitor safety. Law enforcement in city parks is the responsibility of the New York City Police Department, and Parks Enforcement Patrol officers.

==Community Parks Initiative==
The Community Parks Initiative was launched in 2014 and is providing $318 million of capital funding to improve more than 60 parks mainly located in densely populated neighborhoods where there are significant rates of poverty. The park improvements, such as Ranaqua Park in the South Bronx, consist of playground equipment, lighting, seating areas, water fountains, synthetic turn fields, trees and greenery, and rain gardens to collect storm water. The Longfellow Park renovation, also in the Bronx, is budgeted at $3.25 million and includes tree houses for children, bike racks, a sprinkler system for summer recreation, and a mini-state.

==Public-private partnerships==
The New York City Department of Parks and Recreations maintains facilities and provides services through a network of public service workers, volunteers, and partnerships with private organizations.

The momentum for private partnerships increased dramatically during the mayoralty of Michael Bloomberg. Often the initiatives of Parks Commissioner Adrian Benepe were controversial.

===Concessions===
Most businesses that operate or generate revenue on New York City parkland are considered concessions and must obtain a permit or license from the Revenue Division of Parks. Pursuant to the City&#x27;s Concession Rules, these licenses and permits are generally awarded through a public solicitation process, such as a Request for Bids (RFB) or Request for Proposals (RFP). Yorkville Sports Association (YSA) for three years operated the New City Parks Softball Concession that contributed hundreds of thousands of dollars to the City&#x27;s General Fund.

Approximately 500 concessions currently operate in parks throughout the five boroughs, and they generally fall into two categories: food service and recreation. The food service concessions range from pushcarts selling hot dogs to restaurants such as Tavern on the Green and Terrace on the Park. Recreational concessions include facilities such as ice rinks, stables, marinas, and golf courses. In fiscal year 2009, NYC Parks&#x27; Revenue Division helped collect over $110 million in revenue from various sources including concessions, lease agreements, like those for Citi Field and Yankee Stadium, special events, and dockage.

===Private partnerships===
At the turn of the 20th century most of the staffing of New York City parks were patronage jobs. In the 1950s and 1960s, public sector unions organized most park workers which was considered at the time the first major political defeat of Robert Moses. During the city&#x27;s fiscal crisis in the 1970s, the Department of Parks and Recreation City adapted practices such as using welfare recipients and volunteers to do work previously completed by unionized workers and to forge partnerships with nonprofit organizations and local sports leagues. Yorkville Sports (YSA) was one of those that helped maintain athletic fields prior to use and assumed responsibilities previously handled by the public sector. 
During this time the Central Park Conservancy and the Prospect Park Alliance were formed.

==GreenThumb==

GreenThumb was created in 1978 to utilize vacant city owned land as garden spaces. By 1989 there were over 1,000 gardens. In the 1990s the program contracted as gardens were repurposed to build housing. Currently, there are over 550 gardens supported by GreenThumb.

==List of Park Commissioners==
Since 1934, when New York City Parks Department Commissioners were unified, the directors have been:

<doc id="456280" wikidata="Q4531117" url="?curid=456280" title="Belt-drive turntable">
<text>There are three main types of phonograph turntable drives being manufactured today: the belt-drive, idler-wheel and direct-drive systems; the names are based upon the type of coupling used between the platter of the turntable and the motor. 
In a belt-drive turntable the motor is located off-center from the platter, either underneath it or entirely outside of it, and is connected to the platter or counter-platter by a drive belt made from elastomeric material.

The design of the belt-drive turntable allows the use of a less expensive motor than the direct-drive turntable. Also, the elastomeric belt absorbs motor vibrations which would otherwise be picked up by the stylus.

==Rotational stability==
Rotational stability is a key goal for turntable design that produces quality output. 

Many belt-drive turntables with multiple speeds have mechanical devices or rely on manual effort to move the belt between different-sized pulleys on the motor shaft. Due to difficulties in designing multiple-speed synchronous motors whose speed can be controlled electronically, such turntables frequently have DC servomotors. The disadvantage of DC servomotors is that they rotate in steps rather than continuously – the resulting &quot;cogging&quot; can add noise during playback. Helical armature motors can be used to overcome this. Problems with belt instability and deterioration in the past have largely been solved by use of modern elastic polymers. 

Since the 1970s, DC motors have declined in popularity; high end audiophile turntable designs use the synchronous motor, which are smoother running and lower noise. Due to the existence of instabilities of mains electricity, manufacturers might try to ensure pitch stability by generating its own sinusoidal waveform to power their AC motor. Other methods at achieving stability include using optical sensors on the platter which feed back to the electronics; or use of fly wheel assemblies. Some manufacturers use mass to deal with the problem. Heavy platters, which have higher inertia, are thus less susceptible to minute speed variations. However, mass stores energy that may be difficult to control. Heavier platter also increases wear on the bearing.

==Belt-drive types==
Some turntables, such as the newer versions of the Rega Planar series, use a fixed plinth with a low vibration motor and bearing attached to the same flat surface, usually constructed of wood, metal or acrylic, without suspension. Others, such as the Linn Sondek LP12, have a suspension. 

===Suspended-sub-chassis===
The three-point &quot;suspended sub-chassis&quot; was a design by renowned audio pioneer Edgar Villchur. It became the basis upon which his company created the Acoustic Research XA turntable that was launched in 1961. The principle behind it is that the turntable is an inert platform that allows the stylus to track the surface of the record accurately whilst being protected from external vibrations. The platter, sub-chassis, armboard and tonearm mechanically form a closed loop, and sit on top of dampers (usually three springs) which isolate the sub-assembly from its motor and its base. The motor, mounted (directly or indirectly) on the top plate, drives the turntable platter &quot;via&quot; a belt. The compression spring system of the XA was much improved upon, and popularised in the Linn Sondek LP12. A variation can be found in the Oracle Delphi, where the spring is extended; another variant is the Roksan Xerxes, whose top plate is isolated from the motor bearing assembly by compliant rubber dampers.

The main platter bearing may be upright or inverted, it is mounted on the sub-chassis along with the arm fixture. Bearings generally use an oil film to lubricate between a metal ball-bearing and the thrust-plate of the bearing&#x27;s housing. More esoteric designs use an air bearing, where the spindle is supported by a high pressure flow of air.

The tonearm is usually sold separately, allowing for buyer choice and upgrades.

==Disadvantages==
The main disadvantage of belt-drive turntables is the fact that they &quot;ramp&quot; to tempo; they do not instantly play the record at 33 1/3 revolutions per minute, but rather build up to this speed over the course of about one second. This creates an undesirable slurring of the record.

Furthermore, over time the drive belt can wear or lose elasticity, and begin to slip, causing variations in the platter speed. In addition, belt-drive turntables have much lower torque; the belt can also slip off the motor and/or platter spindle, and are thus not suitable for turntablism. DJs who scratch or mix generally prefer to use direct-drive turntables.

<doc id="456291" wikidata="Q2117649" url="?curid=456291" title="Theodore Hook">
<text>Theodore Edward Hook (22 September 1788 – 24 August 1841) was an English man of letters and composer and briefly a civil servant in Mauritius. He is best known for his practical jokes, particularly the Berners Street hoax in 1809. The world&#x27;s first postcard was received by Hook in 1840; he likely posted it to himself.

== Biography ==

=== Early life ===
Hook was born in Charlotte Street, Bedford Square, London. His father, James Hook (1746–1827), was a composer; his elder brother, also called James Hook, became Dean of Worcester.

He spent a year at Harrow School and subsequently matriculated at the University of Oxford. His father took delight in exhibiting the boy&#x27;s musical and metrical gifts, and the precocious Theodore became a pet of the green room. At the age of 16, in conjunction with his father, he scored a dramatic success with &quot;The Soldier&#x27;s Return&quot;, a comic opera, and it followed up with a series of popular ventures with John Liston and Charles Mathews, including &quot;Tekeli&quot;.

Hook then became a playboy and practical joker best known for the Berners Street hoax in 1810 in which he arranged for dozens of tradesmen, and notables such as the Lord Mayor of London, the Governor of the Bank of England, the Chairman of the East India Company and the Duke of Gloucester to visit Mrs Tottenham at 54 Berners Street to win a bet that he could transform any house in London into the most talked-about address within a week.

Another notable prank of Hook&#x27;s was played on the actor Robert (&quot;Romeo&quot;) Coates, a few years later. The Prince Regent was at the time holding &quot;a fête of surpassing magnificence&quot; at Carlton House, and Coates &quot;in his glory- murdering Shakespeare at the Haymarket&quot;; imitating the Chamberlain&#x27;s handwriting, Hook produced a ticket &quot;commanding the presence of Signor Romeo&quot; and, dressing himself in fine scarlet livery, delivered this flattering but fake invitation to Coates in person. Hook waited to watch Coates embark for the event in his carriage, &quot;bedizened in all his finery, with a diamond-hilted sword and the air of Louis le Grand&quot;. Coates was invited in, but on examination of the ticket he was &quot;politely informed that a mistake had occurred&quot;, and turned away. Having sent off his carriage, he was obliged to wait at the Hackney carriage stand. The Prince, unwittingly involved in Hook&#x27;s prank, regretted that Coates had been turned away, observing him to be an &quot;inoffensive gentleman&quot;, and noting that &quot;his presence might have amused many of the guests, and could have done harm to no one.&quot; The Prince sent his secretary the next day, inviting Coates to come and look at the &quot;arrangements and ornaments&quot; which were still all in place; Coates duly went. It was observed that, &quot;to do him justice&quot;, Hook, in retelling it, &quot;never told the story without some signs of compunction.&quot;

=== Career ===
He took up residence at St Mary Hall, Oxford University, leaving after two terms to resume his former life. His gift of improvising songs charmed the Prince Regent into a declaration that something must be done for Hook, who was appointed accountant-general and treasurer of Mauritius with a salary of £2,000 a year (£142,325; US$194,771 in 2021 terms). He was the life and soul of the island from his arrival in October 1813, but a serious deficiency was discovered in the treasury accounts in 1817, and he was arrested and brought to England on a criminal charge. A sum of about £12,000 (£1,054,500; US$1.44 million in 2021 terms) had been extracted by a deputy official, and Hook was held responsible.
During the scrutiny of the audit board, he lived obscurely and maintained himself by writing for magazines and newspapers. In 1820, he launched the newspaper &quot;John Bull&quot;, the champion of high Toryism and the virulent detractor of Queen Caroline. Witty criticism and pitiless invective secured it a large circulation, and Hook derived, for the first year at least, an income of £2,000. He was, however, arrested for the second time on account of his debt to the state, which he made no effort to defray.

While he was confined in a sponging-house from 1823 to 1825, he wrote the nine volumes of stories afterwards collected under the title of &quot;Sayings and Doings&quot; (1824–1828). In the early 1820s, he helped the singer Michael Kelly compile his &quot;Reminiscences&quot;, which include details of working with Mozart. In the remaining 23 years of his life, he poured forth 38 volumes besides articles, squibs and sketches. His novels have frequent passages of racy narrative and vivid portraiture. They include &quot;Maxwell&quot; (1830), a portrait of his friend the Reverend E. Cannon; &quot;Love and Pride&quot; (1833); the autobiographical &quot;Gilbert Gurney&quot; (1835) and &quot;Gurney Married&quot; (1838); &quot;Jack Brag&quot; (1837) and &quot;Peregrine Bunce&quot; (1842). He did not finish a biographical work on Charles Mathews. His last novel was &quot;Births, Marriages and Deaths&quot; (1839).

The world&#x27;s oldest postcard was sent to Hook in 1840, bearing a penny black stamp. Hook probably created and posted the card to himself as a practical joke on the postal service, since the image is a caricature of workers in the post office. In 2002, the postcard sold for a record £31,750.

=== Later life and death ===
Work had already begun to tell on his health when Hook returned to his old habits and a prolonged attempt to combine industry and dissipation resulted in the confession that he was done up in purse, in mind and in body, too, at last. He died at home in Fulham on 24 August 1841. His estate was seized by the Treasury. He never married but lived with Mary Anne Doughty; they had six children.

Hook is remembered as one of the most brilliant figures of Georgian times. He inspired the characters of Lucian Gay in Benjamin Disraeli&#x27;s novel &quot;Coningsby&quot; and Mr Wagg in Thackeray&#x27;s &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;. His style was parodied by the Smith brothers in Rejected Addresses (1812). Coleridge praised him as being &quot;as true a genius as Dante&quot;.

<text>Dean Edwards Smith (February 28, 1931 – February 7, 2015) was an American men&#x27;s college basketball head coach. Called a &quot;coaching legend&quot; by the Basketball Hall of Fame, he coached for 36 years at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Smith coached from 1961 to 1997 and retired with 879 victories, which was the NCAA Division I men&#x27;s basketball record at that time. Smith had the ninth-highest winning percentage of any men&#x27;s college basketball coach (77.6%). During his tenure as head coach, North Carolina won two national championships and appeared in 11 Final Fours. Smith played college basketball at the University of Kansas, where he won a national championship in 1952 playing for Hall of fame coach Phog Allen.

Smith was best known for running a clean program and having a high graduation rate, with 96.6% of his athletes receiving their degrees. While at North Carolina, Smith helped promote desegregation by recruiting the university&#x27;s first African-American scholarship basketball player, Charlie Scott, and pushing for equal treatment for African Americans by local businesses. Smith coached and worked with numerous people at North Carolina who achieved notable success in basketball, as players, coaches, or both. Smith retired in 1997, saying that he was not able to give the team the same level of enthusiasm that he had given it for years. After retiring, Smith used his influence to help various charitable ventures and liberal political activities, but in his later years he suffered from advanced dementia and ceased most public activities.

==Biography==

===Early years===
Smith was born in Emporia, Kansas, on February 28, 1931. Both of his parents were public school teachers. Smith&#x27;s father, Alfred, coached the Emporia High Spartans basketball team to the 1934 state title in Kansas. This 1934 team was notable for having the first African American basketball player in Kansas tournament history. While at Emporia High School for two years and then at Topeka High School, Smith lettered in basketball all four years and was named all-state in basketball as a senior. Smith&#x27;s interest in sports was not limited to basketball. Smith also played quarterback for his high school football team and catcher for the high school baseball team.

===College years===
After graduating from high school, Smith attended the University of Kansas on an academic scholarship. He majored in mathematics and joined Phi Gamma Delta fraternity. While at Kansas, Smith continued his interest in sports by playing varsity basketball, varsity baseball, and freshman football. He was also a member of the Air Force ROTC detachment. During his time on the varsity basketball team, Kansas won the national championship in 1952. In 1953, the team was an NCAA tournament finalist. Smith&#x27;s basketball coach during his time at Kansas was Phog Allen, who had been coached at the University of Kansas by the inventor of basketball, James Naismith. After graduation, Smith served as assistant coach at Kansas in the 1953–54 season.

===Coaching career===

====Early years in basketball coaching====
Smith was commissioned as a second lieutenant on June 7, 1954, in the U.S. Air Force and was stationed at Fürstenfeldbruck Air Base in Germany where he was on a team that won the Air Force championship for Europe. He later worked as a head coach of United States Air Force Academy&#x27;s baseball and golf teams. Yet, Smith&#x27;s big break would come in the United States. In 1958, North Carolina coach Frank McGuire asked Smith to join his staff as an assistant coach. Smith served under McGuire for three years until 1961, when McGuire was forced to resign by Chancellor William Aycock in the wake of a major recruiting scandal, and consequently, an NCAA mandated probation.
Years later, Aycock recalled that McGuire came to his office on a Saturday and told him he was resigning. Smith was waiting in McGuire&#x27;s car outside South Building (UNC&#x27;s main administration building), so Aycock called him in and asked him if he wanted to take over as head coach. Smith accepted, and the hiring was formally announced the following Monday. When Aycock named Smith as head coach, he told the 30-year-old Smith that wins and losses didn&#x27;t matter as much as running a clean program and representing the university well.

The Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) had canceled the Dixie Classic, an annual basketball tournament in Raleigh, North Carolina, due to a national point-shaving scandal including a North Carolina player (Lou Brown). As a result of the scandal, North Carolina de-emphasized basketball by cutting their regular-season schedule. In Smith&#x27;s first season, North Carolina played only 17 games and went 8–9. This was the only losing season he endured during his career. In 1965, he was famously hanged in effigy on the university campus following a disappointing loss to Wake Forest. After that game, UNC would win nine of their last eleven games, and Smith would subsequently go on to turn the program into a consistent success. From 1965 onward, Smith&#x27;s teams never finished worse than tied for third in the ACC. For the first 21 of those years, they did not finish worse than a tie for second. By comparison, during that time the ACC&#x27;s other charter members each finished last at least once.

Smith&#x27;s first major successes came in the late 1960s, when his teams won consecutive regular-season and ACC tournament championships, and went to three straight Final Fours, going all the way to the national championship game in 1968. They would appear in either the NCAA or NIT in every one of Smith&#x27;s final 31 years in Chapel Hill. However, this run occurred in the middle of UCLA&#x27;s stretch of 10 titles in 12 years, and in fact Smith lost to UCLA&#x27;s John Wooden in the 1968 title game.

=====First national championship=====

Smith won his first national championship with his 1981–82 team, which was composed of future NBA players such as Michael Jordan, James Worthy and Sam Perkins. After winning the NCAA tournament, North Carolina had a record of 32–2. The other teams that advanced with North Carolina were Georgetown, Houston and Louisville. The Tar Heels actually finished in a tie for first in the ACC regular season with the Ralph Sampson-led Virginia Cavaliers. In the semifinals, North Carolina defeated Houston 68–63 in New Orleans, while Georgetown defeated Louisville 50–46.

The national title game against Georgetown was evenly matched throughout. However, with 17 seconds left on the clock, and the Tar Heels behind by 1 point, Jordan made what ended up being the game-winning shot to put the Tar Heels up 63–62. On Georgetown&#x27;s ensuing possession, Hoya guard Fred Brown inexplicably passed the ball directly to Worthy with no Georgetown player anywhere near the pass. Worthy attempted to dribble out the clock, but was fouled with 2 seconds left. He missed both free throws, but Georgetown had no timeouts left. The Hoyas missed a halfcourt shot as time expired, giving Smith his first national championship in his seventh appearance in the Final Four.

===Second national championship===
Dean Smith&#x27;s 1992–93 squad featured George Lynch, Eric Montross, Brian Reese, Donald Williams, and Derrick Phelps. The Tar Heels started out with an 8–0 record and were ranked #5 in the country when they met #6 Michigan in the semi-finals of the Rainbow Classic. The Wolverines, led by the Fab Five in their sophomore season, won 79–78 on a last-second shot. North Carolina bounced back with nine straight wins before losing back-to-back road games against unranked Wake Forest and #5 Duke. After seven more straight wins, the Tar Heels were ranked #1 heading into the last week of the regular season (their first #1 ranking since the start of the 1987–88 season). North Carolina beat #14 Wake Forest and #6 Duke to close out the regular season and clinch the top seed in the ACC tournament. North Carolina reached the tournament final, but they lost 77–75 to Georgia Tech without Derrick Phelps, who was injured. Nonetheless, North Carolina was awarded the top seed in the east regional of the 1993 NCAA tournament, defeating #16-seed East Carolina (85–65), #8-seed Rhode Island (112–67), #4-seed Arkansas (80–74) and #2-seed Cincinnati (75–68) to reach the Final Four in New Orleans.

In the national semifinals, Smith&#x27;s Tar Heels defeated his alma mater Kansas (coached by future North Carolina coach Roy Williams) 78–68. In 1991, the same two teams also met in the national semifinals with Kansas prevailing and Dean Smith being ejected. The 1993 victory for UNC set up a rematch from earlier that season with #3 ranked Michigan in the Finals.

The 1993 national title game was a see-saw battle throughout, but is remembered best for Chris Webber calling a time-out while trapped against the sideline by two defenders. Michigan did not have any timeouts remaining and trailed by two points. Michigan was assessed a technical foul and North Carolina ended up winning 77–71, giving Smith his second national championship. After a six-year investigation by the NCAA, Webber&#x27;s association and financial dealings with Ed Martin determined that there had been a series of violations and direct payments to players and was termed &quot;the University of Michigan basketball scandal&quot; and resulted in Michigan pulling down all of its banners and titles from that era.

====Retirement====
Smith abruptly announced his retirement on October 9, 1997. He had said that if he ever felt he could not give his team the same enthusiasm he had given it for years, he would retire. His announcement was unexpected, as he had given little warning that he was considering retirement. With such short notice of Smith&#x27;s retirement, Bill Guthridge, who had been his assistant for 30 years, succeeded him as head coach.

During his retirement, Smith had a large influence on the North Carolina basketball program. In 2003 Smith talked to Roy Williams regarding his decision about whether or not to replace a struggling Matt Doherty as head coach. Williams had previously declined the head coaching position three years earlier when Guthridge retired.

In July 2010, journalist John Feinstein disclosed that he had planned to write a biography of Smith, but had to shelve it due to Smith&#x27;s deteriorating memory. Shortly after, Smith&#x27;s family released a letter stating that he had a &quot;progressive neurocognitive disorder&quot;, which had not been publicly disclosed as Alzheimer&#x27;s or anything else. He had trouble remembering the names of some of his players, the letter said, but he could not forget what his relationships with those players meant. He also remembered words to hymns and jazz standards, but did not go to concerts. He had difficulty with traveling but continued to watch his former team on TV. Williams said, &quot;He does have his good days and bad.&quot;

====Coaching profile====
Smith-coached teams varied in style, depending on the players Smith had available. But they generally featured a fast-break style, a half-court offense that emphasized the passing game, and an aggressive trapping defense that produced turnovers and easy baskets. From 1970 until his retirement, his teams featured a shooting percentage of over 50% in all but four years.

Smith was credited with creating or popularizing the following basketball techniques: The &quot;tired signal&quot;, in which a player would use a hand signal (originally a raised fist) to indicate that he needed to come out for a rest, huddling at the free throw line before a foul shot, encouraging players who scored a basket to point a finger at the teammate who passed them the ball, in honor of the passer&#x27;s selflessness, instituting a variety of defensive sets in one game, having the point guard call out the defense set for the team, and creating a number of defensive sets, including the point zone, the run-and-jump, and double-teaming the screen-and-roll.
Strategically, Smith was most associated with his implementation of John McLendon&#x27;s four corners offense, a strategy for stalling with a lead near the end of the game. Smith&#x27;s teams executed the four corners set so effectively that in 1985 the NCAA instituted a shot clock to speed up play and minimize ball-control offense. Although fellow Kansas alum McLendon actually invented the four corners offense, Smith got credit for utilizing it in games. Smith was also the author of &quot;Basketball: Multiple Offense and Defense&quot;, which is the best-selling technical basketball book in history.

Smith also instituted the practice of starting all his team&#x27;s seniors on the last home game of the season (&quot;Senior Day&quot;) as a way of honoring the contributions of the substitutes as well as the stars. In a season when the team included six seniors, he put all six on the floor at the beginning of the game – drawing a technical foul – rather than leave one of them out.

During the 1993 run for the national title, Smith used a method that was introduced to him at a conference in Switzerland. At the conference, Smith was presented a tape by a lecturer who used doctored images to achieve his goal of losing weight. The photos showed the lecturer what he would look like if he were thinner as motivation to reach his weight-loss goals. Smith took a picture of the scoreboard from the 1982 Championship, modified it to read 1993 and erased the name Georgetown, leaving that space blank. He proceeded to place copies of the doctored photo in all of the players&#x27; lockers.

Student athletes under Smith achieved a graduation rate of 96.6% at North Carolina, and he established a reputation for running a clean program.

==Personal life==
Smith married Ann Cleavinger in 1954, shortly before his deployment overseas with the United States Air Force. They had three children: daughters Sharon and Sandy, and son Scott. Smith and Cleavinger divorced in 1973. Smith married psychiatrist Linnea Weblemoe Smith on May 21, 1976. They have two adult daughters, Kristen and Kelly. Weblemoe Smith would battle &quot;Playboy&quot; over college all-star teams, &quot;campaigning for an end of all sports associations with &quot;Playboy&quot;, to include all interviews as well as the regular picture-taking of top college basketball and football stars&quot;.

==Death==
Smith died on the evening of February 7, 2015, at age 83, at his Chapel Hill home surrounded by his family. A private funeral was held on February 12 at Binkley Baptist Church in Chapel Hill, with burial following at Old Chapel Hill Cemetery on the UNC campus. A public memorial service was held at the Dean Smith Center on February 22.

Michael Jordan, who had played with the North Carolina Tar Heels with Dean Smith as coach, stated that Smith had been the most influential person in his life other than his parents and that he was &quot;more than a coach — he was a mentor, my teacher, my second father.&quot;

Smith willed a $200 check to each of the lettermen he&#x27;d coached during his 36 years at North Carolina, which included the message &quot;Enjoy a dinner out compliments of Coach Dean Smith.” The estate&#x27;s trustee told ESPN that checks were sent out to about 180 ex-players.

===Recognition===
Smith received a number of personal honors during his coaching career. He was named the National Coach of the Year four times (1977, 1979, 1982, 1993) and ACC Coach of the Year eight times (1967, 1968, 1969, 1971, 1976, 1977, 1979, 1988, 1993). Smith was also inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame on May 2, 1983, two years after being enshrined in the North Carolina Sports Hall of Fame.

Smith was the first recipient of the Mentor Award for Lifetime Achievement, given by the University of North Carolina Committee on Teaching Awards for &quot;a broader range of teaching beyond the classroom.&quot; He has also been awarded honorary doctorates by Eastern University and Catawba College.

In 1982, Smith was the recipient of the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement presented by Awards Council member Coach Tom Landry.

The basketball arena at North Carolina, the Dean Smith Center, was named for Smith. It is also widely referred to as the &quot;Dean Dome.&quot; Smith coached the last 11.5 years of his career in the arena, making him one of the few college coaches to have coached in an arena or stadium named for him. In 1997, upon his retirement, Smith was named Sportsman of the Year by the magazine &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;. ESPN named Smith one of the five all-time greatest American coaches of any sport. In 1998, he won the Arthur Ashe Courage Award, presented at the annual ESPY Awards hosted by ESPN.

On November 17, 2006, Smith was recognized for his impact on college basketball as a member of the founding class of the National Collegiate Basketball Hall of Fame. He was one of five, along with Oscar Robertson, Bill Russell, John Wooden and Dr. James Naismith, selected to represent the inaugural class. In 2007, he was enshrined in the FIBA Hall of Fame.

On November 20, 2013, President Barack Obama awarded Smith the Presidential Medal of Freedom.

On December 8, 2021, the North Carolina State Board of Transportation approved naming Interstate 40 between U.S. 15-501 and North Carolina Highway 54 &quot;Dean Smith Highway&quot;.

==Political activities==
A longtime Democrat, Dean Smith was one of the most prominent liberals in North Carolina politics. Politically, he was best known for promoting desegregation. In 1964, Smith joined a local pastor and a black North Carolina theology student to integrate The Pines, a Chapel Hill restaurant. He also integrated the Tar Heels basketball team by recruiting Charlie Scott as the university&#x27;s first black scholarship athlete. In 1965, Smith helped Howard Lee, a black graduate student at North Carolina, purchase a home in an all-white neighborhood. He opposed the Vietnam War and, in the early 1980s, famously recorded radio spots to promote a freeze on nuclear weapons. He was a prominent opponent of the death penalty. In 1998, he appeared at a clemency hearing for a death-row inmate and pointed at then-Governor Jim Hunt: &quot;You&#x27;re a murderer. And I&#x27;m a murderer. The death penalty makes us all murderers.&quot; As head coach, he periodically held North Carolina basketball practices in North Carolina prisons.

While coach, he was recruited by some in the Democratic Party to run for the United States Senate against incumbent Jesse Helms. He declined. But in retirement, he continued to speak out on issues such as the Iraq War, death penalty, and gay rights. Although a staunch Democrat, Smith did support one of his former players, Richard Vinroot, a Republican who ran for governor of North Carolina in 2000. In 2006, Smith became the spokesperson for Devout Democrats, an inter-faith, grassroots political action committee designed to convince religious Americans to vote for Democrats. Smith was featured in an ad that ran in newspapers across North Carolina and was featured in an Associated Press article. On October 13, 2008, he endorsed Senator Barack Obama&#x27;s candidacy for President of the United States.

<text>Blake Babies were an American college rock band formed in 1986 in Boston, Massachusetts. The three primary members were Freda Love, Juliana Hatfield and John Strohm. They recorded three albums before splitting up in 1991. They reformed to record a new album in 1999, and again in 2016.

==History==
The band formed in 1986, while Hatfield was studying at Berklee College of Music. The name &quot;Blake Babies&quot; was provided by the poet Allen Ginsberg; following a reading at Harvard University, the group (which had just begun to play together) raised their hands and asked him to name their band. Their first release was the &quot;Nicely, Nicely&quot; album, released on their own Chewbud label in 1987.

In 1989 they released the mini-LP &quot;Slow Learner&quot; on Billy Bragg&#x27;s Utility label, Evan Dando of the Lemonheads (who Strohm had previously played with) joining as a temporary bassist. The band then signed to the then-independent North Carolina–based record label Mammoth Records, who issued &quot;Earwig&quot; in 1989 and &quot;Sunburn&quot; in 1990, the latter described by Allmusic as &quot;the last great college rock album&quot;. Their final UK tour included several sold-out shows, and the band looked on the verge of a breakthrough, but they went on hiatus in 1991, with the &quot;Rosy Jack World&quot; EP released in June and Hatfield rumored to be on the brink of signing with a major label as a solo artist. The band&#x27;s split was finally confirmed in early 1992.

The Blake Babies toured the United States and Europe, eventually achieving a moderate amount of notice, particularly among listeners of college age who were appreciative of the group&#x27;s &quot;intelligent&quot; brand of rock music. The band&#x27;s music received little airplay on commercial radio, instead being played primarily on college radio stations.

Andrew Mayer, Seth White, Anthony DeLuca (who played drums in place of Freda for the group&#x27;s last European tour in early 1992), and Mike Leahy each also performed as members of the band at times.

Strohm and Love continued to perform together in the Indiana-based group Antenna.

The group reunited in late 1999 to record a new album, performing a few shows in 1999 and 2000 and embarking on one last US tour in 2001. The result of these recording sessions, &quot;God Bless the Blake Babies&quot;, was released in 2001 by Rounder Records.

Hatfield and Love joined up again in 2003 in the band Some Girls along with fellow musician Heidi Gluck.

In March 2016, the band announced that an album of demos recorded in March 1988 would be released (&quot;Earwig Demos&quot;), and they reunited again for three live shows that year.

==Musical style==
The group were compared to R.E.M. and Throwing Muses. &quot;The Washington Post&quot;&quot; described them as &quot;punkish folk-rock&quot;.

<text>John Liston (c. 1776 – 22 March 1846), English comedian, was born in London.

He made his public debut on the stage at Weymouth as Lord Duberley in &quot;The Heir at Law&quot;. After several dismal failures in tragic parts, some of them in support of Mrs Siddons, he discovered accidentally that his forte was comedy, especially in the personation of old men and country boys, in which he displayed a fund of drollery and broad humour. An introduction to Charles Kemble led to his appearance at the Haymarket on 10 June 1805 as Sheepface in &quot;The Village Lawyer&quot;, and his association with this theatre continued with few interruptions until 1830.

&quot;Paul Pry&quot;, the most famous of all his impersonations, was first presented on 13 September 1825 and soon became, thanks to his creative genius, a real personage. Liston remained on the stage until 1837; during his last years his mind failed, and he died on 22 March 1846. He had married in 1807 Sarah Liston, formerly Tyrer, (1781–1854), a singer and actress.

In the January 1825 of the London Magazine there appeared a Memoir of John Liston written by his close friend Charles Lamb. This was said by Lamb to be &quot;pure invention&quot; and intended as a humorous essay. Liston himself replied to this Memoir in the following edition of the London Magazine suggesting that the same writer pen a short life of Byron.

Several pictures of Liston in character are in the Garrick Club, London, and as Paul Pry in the South Kensington Museum and the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland archives.

<text>Andrew Peter Telegdi, PC (born András Telegdi; May 28, 1946 – January 23, 2017) was a Canadian politician. He was a Liberal Member of Parliament in the House of Commons of Canada from 1993 to 2008, representing Waterloo and the successor riding of Kitchener—Waterloo.

== Early life and career ==
Telegdi was born in Budapest, Hungary. He emigrated to Canada with his family in 1957 as a refugee following the Hungarian Revolution of 1956. He attended the University of Waterloo in the 1970s. He served two terms as president of the Federation of Students, UW&#x27;s student union, from 1973 to 1974. After graduating, he became executive director of &quot;Youth in Conflict with the Law&quot;, and was a board member of the Working Centre (St. John&#x27;s Soup Kitchen). Telegdi was also appointed to the board of governors of Wilfrid Laurier University.

Telegdi was a city councillor for Waterloo City Council from 1985 to 1993. In this office he also sat as a city representative as a regional councillor for the Regional Municipality of Waterloo.

== Career in federal politics ==
As member of the Ontario Liberal Party he ran for the Legislative Assembly of Ontario in the riding of Waterloo North in the 1990 provincial election. He finished a poor third against Progressive Conservative Elizabeth Witmer thus becoming the first Liberal to lose that riding in over 23 years. He won an easy victory to the House of Commons of Canada three years later and was subsequently re-elected four times, all by comfortable margins.

Telegdi was appointed parliamentary secretary to the Minister and Citizenship of Immigration on July 16, 1998, but resigned the position on May 18, 2000, as he objected to certain provisions in the government&#x27;s proposed Citizenship Act. He was concerned with a clause that gave Canada&#x27;s parliament, rather than the courts, the right to remove a person&#x27;s citizenship, and in particular 
Helmut Oberlander&#x27;s
who was a constituent of the riding he then represented. Commenting on this issue, he said &quot;For me, my citizenship comes before my party.&quot;

During this controversy, Telegdi argued that placing parliament above the courts on citizenship issues was similar to &quot;what Hitler used to do&quot;. Telegdi was widely criticized for this comment and the Canadian Jewish Congress and called for Telegdi&#x27;s removal from the Liberal caucus. In response, Telegdi noted that his stepfather was a Jewish refugee from Romania, and claimed his comments had been reported out of context in a sensational manner. He also issued the following statement: &quot;What I have said is that a liberal democratic state such as Canada should never remove citizenship lightly. That is what Hitler did to Jews, Gypsies and many others. That is what Stalin did to millions. All totalitarian regimes have engaged in these practices.&quot;
 
He also issued an apology for his comments to the House of Commons.

Telegdi also engaged in a public dispute with Liberal Party activist Warren Kinsella during this period. After Kinsella criticized Telegdi&#x27;s comments on the Citizenship Act, Telegdi wrote a letter calling on Kinsella to resign as Jean Chrétien&#x27;s spokesperson.

Telegdi was a liberal on most social issues. He was a strong supporter of gay rights and same-sex marriage. He also opposed the 2003 invasion of Iraq, expressing concern that the American approach of &quot;pre-emptive strikes&quot; would create new problems and undermine multilateral institutions.

For several years, Telegdi was a supporter of Paul Martin in his bid to succeed Jean Chrétien as leader of the Liberal Party. Soon after Martin succeeded Chrétien as Liberal leader and Prime Minister, Telegdi was appointed parliamentary secretary to the Prime Minister with special emphasis on Aboriginal Affairs. He held this position until just after the 2004 election and prior to the 2008 election was vice-chair of the Standing Committee on Citizenship and Immigration.

He lost to Conservative candidate Peter Braid by an initial count of 48 votes in the 2008 federal election. A judicial recount was ordered, as the margin of victory was less than 0.1%. The final validated count, showing errors in two polls, confirmed his opponent had won the seat by 17 votes, the smallest margin of victory in the 2008 federal election. He campaigned again in the 2011 federal election and lost to Braid by 2,114 votes.

==Post-federal career==
In 2014, Telegdi ran and lost in the 2014 Waterloo Regional Elections. He came in third place to become one of two councillors for Waterloo on the Waterloo Regional Council.

Telegdi died on January 23, 2017, in Waterloo, Ontario, aged 70.

The city has 28,000 acres (113 km2) of municipal parkland and 14 miles (22 km) of public municipal beaches. Major municipal parks include Central Park, Prospect Park, Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, and Forest Park. The largest is Pelham Bay Park, followed by the Staten Island Greenbelt and Van Cortlandt Park. There are also many smaller but historically significant parks in New York City, such as Battery Park, Bryant Park, Madison Square Park, Union Square Park, and Washington Square Park. 

Additionally, some parks, most notably Gramercy Park, are privately owned and managed. Access to these private parks may be restricted.

The City Parks Foundation offers more than 1200 free performing arts events in parks across the city each year, including Central Park Summerstage, the Charlie Parker Jazz Festival and dance, theater, and children&#x27;s arts festivals.

<text>Tikhon Nikolayevich Khrennikov (; – 14 August 2007) was a Russian and Soviet composer, pianist, and General Secretary of the Union of Soviet Composers (1948–1991), who was also known for his political activities. He wrote three symphonies, four piano concertos, two violin concertos, two cello concertos, operas, operettas, ballets, chamber music, incidental music and film music.

During the 1930s, Khrennikov was already being hailed as a leading Soviet composer. In 1948, Andrei Zhdanov, the leader of the anti-formalism campaign, nominated Khrennikov as Secretary of the Union of Soviet Composers. He held this influential post until the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991.

== Biography ==

===Early years===
Tikhon Khrennikov was the youngest of ten children, born into a family of horse traders in the town of Yelets, Oryol Governorate, Russian Empire (now in Lipetsk Oblast in central Russia).

He learned guitar and mandolin from members of his family and sang in a local choir in Yelets. There he also played in a local orchestra and learned the piano. As a teenager he moved to Moscow. From 1929 to 1932, he studied composition at the Gnessin State Musical College under Mikhail Gnessin and Yefraim Gelman. From 1932 to 1936, he attended the Moscow Conservatory. There he studied composition under Vissarion Shebalin and piano under Heinrich Neuhaus. As a student, he wrote and played his &quot;Piano Concerto No. 1&quot;, and his graduation piece was the &quot;Symphony No. 1&quot;. His first symphony was conducted by Leopold Stokowski. He became popular with the series of songs and serenades that he composed for the 1936 production of &quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot; at the Vakhtangov Theatre in Moscow.

By the 1930s, Khrennikov was already treated as a leading Soviet composer. Typical was his speech during a discussion in February 1936 concerning &quot;Pravda&quot; articles &quot;Muddle Instead of Music&quot; and &quot;Balletic Falsity&quot;:

The resolution on 23rd April 1932 appealed to the consciousness of the Soviet artist. Soviet artists had not withstood scrutiny. After 23rd April, youth was inspired to study. The problem was, we had to master the skills and techniques of composition. We developed an enthusiasm for modern western composers. The names of Hindemith and Krenek came to be symbols of advanced modern artists. [...] After the enthusiasm for western tendencies came an attraction to simplicity, influenced by composing for the theatre, where simple, expressive music was required. We grew, our consciousness also grew, as well as the aspiration to be genuine Soviet composers, representatives of our epoch. Compositions by Hindemith satisfied us no more. Soon after that Prokofiev arrived, declaring Soviet music to be provincial and naming Shostakovich as the most up-to-date composer. Young composers were confused: on the one hand, they wanted to create simpler music that would be easier for the masses to understand; on the other hand, they were confronted with the statements of such musical authorities as Prokofiev. Critics wrote laudatory odes to Shostakovich. […] How did young composers react to &quot;Lady Macbeth&quot; [&quot;of Mtsensk&quot;]? This opera contains several large melodic fragments which opened some creative perspectives to us. But the entre‘actes and other things aroused complete hostility.
Together with other representatives of Soviet culture (Nikolay Chelyapov, Nikolai Myaskovsky, Nikolay Chemberdzhi, Sergei Vasilenko, Victor Bely, Alexander Veprik, Aram Khachaturian, Boris Shekhter, M. Starodokamsky, Georgy Khubov, Vano Muradeli, Vladimir Yurovsky and Lev Kulakovsky), Khrennikov signed the statement welcoming &quot;a sentence of the Supreme Court of the Soviet Union, passed on traitors against the motherland, fascist hirelings, such as Tukhachevsky, Yakir and others&quot;.

Having &quot;adopted the optimistic, dramatic and unabashedly lyrical style favored by Soviet leaders&quot;, Khrennikov shot to fame in 1941, with the &quot;Song of Moscow&quot; (, meaning &quot;Swineherd and Shepherd&quot;) from his music score for the popular Soviet film &quot;They Met in Moscow&quot;, for which he was awarded the Stalin Prize. In 1941, Khrennikov was appointed Music Director of the Central Theatre of the Red Army, a position he would keep for 25 years.

In February 1945 Khrennikov was officially posted by the Political Authority (Politupravlenie) of the Red Army from Sverdlovsk, where he and his family had been evacuated, to the First Belorussian Front, and the Army commanded by General (later Marshal) Chuikov.

In 1947 he joined the CPSU and became a deputy of the Supreme Soviet.

===General Secretary of the Union of Soviet Composers===
On 10 January 1948, more than 70 composers, musicians and music lecturers were summoned to a three-day conference in the Kremlin, to be lectured by the communist party&#x27;s chief ideologist Andrei Zhdanov on how to write music. As one of the main speakers, Khrennikov backed the party line, and attacked all three of the greatest composers present, Dmitri Shostakovich, Sergei Prokofiev and Khachaturian. Years later, he defended his behaviour by telling a BBC correspondent: &quot;They told me - they forced me - to read out that speech attacking Shostakovich and Prokofiev. What else could I have done? If I had refused, it would have been curtains for me.&quot;

In 1948, Joseph Stalin appointed Khrennikov General Secretary of the Union of Soviet Composers, a position he would keep until the union was disbanded with the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991.

In an interview with pianist Jascha Nemtsov on 8 November 2004 in Moscow, Khrennikov asserted that composer Mieczysław Weinberg, when arrested, had been discharged immediately because of Khrennikov&#x27;s protection. According to Khrennikov the same had happened to Alexander Veprik. Extant evidence demonstrates that Veprik spent four years in a prison camp and Mieczysław Weinberg was released in June 1953 because of Stalin&#x27;s death.

In 1949, Khrennikov officially attacked the composer Alexander Lokshin, using formulations of one of Stalin&#x27;s ideologists, Pavel Apostolov. In his speech Khrennikov contrasted Lokshin&#x27;s &quot;modernist&quot; style with the bylina &quot;Stepan Razin&#x27;s Dream&quot; by Galina Ustvolskaya, which he considered an ideal example of true national art.

Khrennikov&#x27;s speech aroused great indignation in Mikhail Gnessin, who accused him of duplicity: not daring to criticise Lokshin in a professional environment, Khrennikov attacked him ideologically from his position as a leading Soviet official. After this ideological campaign Lokshin was excluded from academic circles.

Khrennikov did not prevent Prokofiev&#x27;s first wife, Lina Codina, from being charged as a &quot;spy&quot; following her arrest by the NKVD on 20 February 1948. As head of the Composers&#x27; Union, Khrennikov made no attempt to have the sentence against Lina Prokofieva quashed or reduced. The Composers&#x27; Union did not help Prokofiev&#x27;s sons, who were compulsorily evicted from their apartment. After Codina returned from the Gulag, the Union of Soviet Composers did nothing to improve the extremely bad living conditions of her family; it was the prominent singers Irina Arkhipova and Zurab Sotkilava who protected Prokofiev&#x27;s first family. Afterwards, the family was exposed to regular official humiliations. According to Prokofiev&#x27;s first son, Sviatoslav, the Union refused Codina permission to go to Paris, even though she had been personally invited by the French culture minister to the opening of Prokofiev&#x27;s memorial board. Instead, Khrennikov took part at that ceremony with his whole family. The Union also refused Lina Prokofieva permission to go to the opening of the Sydney Opera House. At the same time, Sviatoslav Prokofiev noted the typical logic of the Soviet functionary: sometimes Khrennikov could help if it was not dangerous for his own position and career.

The ideological campaigns of 1948–49 against musical formalism were directly connected with the offensive against &quot;rootless cosmopolitans,&quot; which formed a part of the state anti-Semitism in the Soviet Union that flourished after the Second World War. The leadership of the Union of Soviet Composers branded certain composers as &quot;zionist aggressors&quot; or &quot;agents of world imperialism&quot;, and made accusations of &quot;ideologically vicious&quot; and &quot;hostile&quot; phenomena in Soviet musical culture. An accusation of Zionism was often used as a weapon against people of different nationalities, faiths and opinions, such as Nikolai Roslavets. &quot;Struggle against formalists&quot; was pursued in other countries too. According to György Ligeti, after Khrennikov&#x27;s official visit to Budapest in 1948, &quot;The Miraculous Mandarin&quot; by Béla Bartók was removed from the repertoire and paintings by French impressionists and others were removed from display in museums.

Khrennikov and other functionaries of the Union of Soviet Composers constantly attacked the heritage of the Russian avant-garde as well as its researchers. For example, the East German musicologist (1934–2008) was persecuted because of his promotion in the West of modern Soviet music of the 1920s. Gojowy was proclaimed to be an &quot;anti-Soviet writer&quot; – until 1989 he was forbidden to visit the Soviet Union and some of his publications that he sent to Soviet colleagues were intercepted by customs. At the same time, Soviet musicologists engaged in developing a Russian avant-garde tradition were officially prohibited from going abroad. Once again, Nicolai Roslavets was an example.

Khrennikov was a Member of Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union from the 1950s on. From 1962, he was a representative in the Supreme Soviet of the USSR.

===Later years===
In his last years, Khrennikov publicly stated his disapproval of Perestroika, its leaders, and the fall of the Soviet Union:

It was a betrayal by our leaders. I consider Gorbachev and his henchmen, who deliberately organised persecution of Soviet art, to be traitors to the party and the people [...]&quot;.

In another interview given to the same newspaper &quot;Zavtra&quot; (meaning &quot;Tomorrow&quot;) he described Stalin as a &quot;genius&quot;, an &quot;absolutely normal person&quot;, tolerant of criticism:
Stalin, in my opinion, knew music better than any of us. […] As in classical Ancient Greece, so too in the Soviet Union music was of the greatest importance to the state. The spiritual influence of the greatest composers and artists in the formation of intelligent and strong-willed people, first of all through radio, was huge.

Khrennikov&#x27;s memoirs were published in 1994. He died in Moscow aged 94 and is buried in the garden of the house where he was born in Yelets.

== Interviews ==
Some of Khrennikov&#x27;s statements mentioned above are included in the 2004 documentary &quot;Notes interdites: scènes de la vie musicale en Russie Soviétique&quot; (English title: &quot;The Red Baton&quot;) by Bruno Monsaingeon.

Khrennikov was interviewed by former BBC correspondent Martin Sixsmith for the BBC&#x27;s 2006 radio show &quot;Challenging the Silence&quot;. In it Khrennikov denied the suggestion that he was at the heart of the criticism of composers such as Prokofiev and Shostakovich, though he expressed pride that he &quot;was Stalin&#x27;s Commissar. When I said No! (he shouts), it meant No.&quot;

<doc id="456310" wikidata="Q467886" url="?curid=456310" title="Italian training ship Amerigo Vespucci">
<text>The Amerigo Vespucci is a tall ship of the Italian Navy (&quot;Marina Militare&quot;) named after the explorer Amerigo Vespucci. Her home port is La Spezia, Italy, and she is in use as a training ship.

==History==
In 1925, the Regia Marina ordered two training ships to a design by General Lieutenant Francesco Rotundi of the Italian Navy Engineering Corps, inspired by the style of large late 18th century 74-cannon ships of the line (like the Neapolitan ship &quot;Monarca&quot;). The first, the &quot;Cristoforo Colombo&quot;, was put into service in 1928 and was used by the Italian Navy until 1943. After World War II, this ship was handed over to the USSR as part of the war reparations and was shortly afterwards decommissioned.

The second ship was the &quot;Amerigo Vespucci&quot;, built in 1930 at the (formerly Royal) Naval Shipyard of Castellammare di Stabia (Naples). She was launched on 22 February 1931, and put into service in July of that year.

The vessel is a full-rigged three-masted steel hull long, with an overall length of including the bowsprit and a maximum width of . She has a draught of about and a displacement at full load of 4146 tons. Under auxiliary diesel-electric propulsion the &quot;Amerigo Vespucci&quot; can reach and has a range of 5450 nm at 6.5 knots.

The three steel masts are 50, 54 and 43 metres high, and carry sails totaling . The &quot;Amerigo Vespucci&quot; has 26 sails – square sails, staysails, and jibs: all are traditional canvas sails. When under sail in severe sea and wind conditions she can reach . The rig, some 30 km of ropes, uses only traditional hemp ropes; only the mooring lines are synthetic, to comply with port regulations.

The hull is painted black with two white stripes, harking back to the two gun decks of the ships her design is based on, but she carries only two 6pdr saluting guns in pivot mountings on the deck, forward of the mainmast. The deck planks are of teak wood and must be replaced every three years. Bow and stern are decorated with intricate ornaments; she has a life-size figurehead of Amerigo Vespucci. The stern gallery is accessible only through the Captain&#x27;s saloon.

The standard crew of the &quot;Amerigo Vespucci&quot; is 16 officers, 70 non-commissioned officers and 190 sailors. In summer, when she embarks the midshipmen of the Naval Academy (&quot;Accademia Navale&quot;), the crew totals some 450.

In 1964, the ship was fitted with two 4-stroke, 8-cylinder FIAT B 308 ESS diesel engines, which replaced the original 2-stroke 6-cylinder FIAT Q 426 engines. These engines generated electric power for one electric propulsion motor that produced up to about .

After update works, between 2013 and 2016, the ship has been fitted with two 4-stroke, 12-cylinder MTU, 1,32 MW each diesel engine generators and two 4-stroke, 8-cylinder MTU, 760 kW each diesel engine generators, and one NIDEC (Ansaldo Sistemi Industriali) electric engine. During the same work, the ship has been fitted with new radar GEM Elettronica AN/SPS-753(V)5, new satellite antenna ORBIT AL-7103.

When carrying cadets, the ship is usually steered from the manual stern rudder station, which is operated by four steering wheels with two men each. At other times, the hydraulically assisted steering on the bridge is used. Except for the anchor winch, the winches aboard are not power operated. The bridge is equipped with modern electronic navigation instruments.

Other than during World War II, the &quot;Amerigo Vespucci&quot; has been continually active. Most of her training cruises are in European waters, but she has also sailed to North and South America, and navigated the Pacific. In 2002, she undertook a voyage around the world.

In 1960, &quot;Vespucci&quot; carried the Olympic torch from Piraeus to Syracuse for the Summer Olympics in Rome.
While sailing the Mediterranean Sea in 1962, the American aircraft carrier USS &quot;Independence&quot; flashed the &quot;Amerigo Vespucci&quot; with the light signal asking: &quot;Who are you?&quot; The full-rigged ship answered: &quot;Training ship &quot;Amerigo Vespucci&quot;, Italian Navy.&quot; The &quot;Independence&quot; replied: &quot;You are the most beautiful ship in the world.&quot; In 2022, the &quot;Amerigo Vespucci&quot; sailed by the American aircraft carrier USS &quot;George H.W. Bush&quot;, which saluted the ship and commented: &quot;You are still, after 60 years, the most beautiful ship in the world.&quot;

The &quot;Amerigo Vespucci&quot; often takes part in sailing parades and Tall Ships&#x27; Races, where she is in amicable rivalry with the &quot;Gorch Fock&quot;. When she is berthed in port, public tours of the vessel are usually offered. The ship circumnavigated the globe in 2003. Starting from 2013, the &quot;Vespucci&quot; depends directly on the Commander in Chief Naval Fleet.
The ship received major modernization works from 2013 to 2016.

On 22 November 2024, &quot;Amerigo Vespucci&quot; conducted a joint sailing exercise with the INS &quot;Taringi&quot; of the Indian Navy off the coast of Kochi, India. As of 30 November 2024, the ship is docked at Mumbai for a five-day stopover as a part of its circumnavigation that started in 2023 and includes 36 ports and 32 countries. Mumbai marks its 27th stop. The ship&#x27;s crew including 270 crew 150 cadets for seamanship training sailed for 16 days across the Indian Ocean from Phuket to Mumbai.

On 9 January 2025, archbishop Santo Marcianò of the Military Ordinariate of Italy designated ship as a 2025 Jubilee church and site “for sacred pilgrimages and for pious visits among its missions at sea.”

<text>John Mudge (1721 – 26 March 1793) was a British physician and amateur creator of telescope mirrors. He won the Copley Medal in 1777 for a paper on reflecting telescopes.

==Life==
He was the fourth and youngest son of the Rev. Zachariah Mudge, by his first wife, Mary Fox, and was born at Bideford, Devon. He was educated at Bideford and Plympton grammar schools, and studied medicine at Plymouth Hospital.

Several invitations were made to Mudge to try his fortunes in London. But he preferred to remain at Plymouth, where he practised for the remainder of his life, first as surgeon, and, after 1784, when he received the degree of M.D. from King&#x27;s College, Aberdeen, as a physician.

Mudge inherited a friendship with the family of Sir Joshua Reynolds, and when in 1762 Samuel Johnson accompanied Reynolds on his visit to Plymouth, Johnson became a friend and consulted Mudge as a physician. Another intimate friend was John Smeaton. Other allies and guests of Mudge were James Ferguson, the astronomer, and James Northcote, originally a chemist&#x27;s assistant, who owed him his position in Reynolds&#x27;s studio.

==Telescopes==
On 29 May 1777 Mudge was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society, and in the same year was awarded the Copley medal for his ‘Directions for making the best Composition for the Metals for reflecting Telescopes; together with a Description of the Process for Grinding, Polishing, and giving the great Speculum the true Parabolic Curve,’ which were communicated by the author to the society, and printed in the &quot;Philosophical Transactions&quot; (1777, lxvii. 296). The ‘Directions’ were also issued separately by Bowyer (London, 1778). Sir John Pringle, the president, in making the presentation, remarked that Isaac Newton had predicted the role of mechanical devices in making parabolic mirrors.

The manufacture of telescopes continued to occupy much of his spare time. He made two large ones with a magnifying power of two hundred times; one of these he gave to Hans Moritz von Brühl, and it passed to the Gotha Observatory, the other descended to his son William Mudge.

==Medical works==

In 1777 he published a work on smallpox representing an advance on the previous treatises by Richard Mead and others.

In 1778 he published ‘A Radical and Expeditious Cure for recent Catarrhous Cough,’ with a drawing of a remedial inhaler, which obtained wide acceptance. He wrote some further small medical treatises.

==Family==
Mudge was married three times, and had ten children. By Mary Bulteel, his first wife, he had eight children. His second wife, Jane, was buried on 3 February 1766 in St. Andrew&#x27;s. He married thirdly, 29 May 1767, Elizabeth Garrett, who survived him, dying in 1808, aged 72. His sons included William Mudge and Zachary Mudge, by his second and third wives respectively.

<doc id="456318" wikidata="Q1518382" url="?curid=456318" title="Alberta Social Credit Party">
<text>Alberta Social Credit was a provincial political party in Alberta, Canada, that was founded on social credit monetary policy put forward by Clifford Hugh Douglas and on conservative Christian social values. The Canadian social credit movement was largely an out-growth of Alberta Social Credit. The Social Credit Party of Canada was strongest in Alberta, before developing a base in Quebec when Réal Caouette agreed to merge his Ralliement créditiste movement into the federal party. The British Columbia Social Credit Party formed the government for many years in neighbouring British Columbia, although this was effectively a coalition of centre-right forces in the province that had no interest in social credit monetary policies.

The Alberta Social Credit party won a majority government in 1935, in the first election it contested, barely months after its formation. During its first years, when led by William Aberhart, it was a radical monetary reform party, at least in theory if not in effect. After Aberhart&#x27;s death in 1943 and the rise to leadership of Ernest Manning, followed quickly by the discovery of oil in north-central Alberta and its accompanying wealth for many, Social Credit took on a more conservative hue. Its policies were pro-business and anti-union, and largely opposed to government intervention in the economy. It stayed in power until 1971, one of the longest unbroken runs in government at the provincial level in Canada. However, it held no seats after 1982, and finished a distant seventh in the 2012 and 2015 general elections, before the party&#x27;s name change.

In May 2017, the party changed its name to Pro-Life Alberta Political Association (or Prolife Alberta, for short) following the election of anti-abortion activist Jeremy Fraser as leader. The change in name reflected the change in direction from the comprehensive political platform of Social Credit with aims of forming government, to the Party&#x27;s new, and sole, focus of promoting pro-life public policy.

==History==
===Origins===
William Aberhart, a Baptist lay-preacher and evangelist in Calgary, was attracted to social credit theory while Alberta (and much of the western world) was in the depths of the Great Depression. He soon began promoting it through his radio program on CFCN in Calgary, adding a heavy dose of fundamentalist Christianity to the Social Credit theories of C.H. Douglas. The basic premise of social credit is that all citizens should be paid a dividend as capital and technology replace labour in production; this was especially attractive to farmers sinking under the weight of the Depression. Many study groups devoted to the theory sprang up across the province, which united into the Social Credit League of Alberta.

===Rise to power===

From 1932 to 1935, Aberhart tried to get the governing United Farmers of Alberta (UFA) to adopt social credit. However, the 1935 UFA convention voted against adopting social credit and UFA Premier Richard Reid rejected the proposals as being outside the province&#x27;s constitutional powers, so Aberhart entered Social Credit candidates in that year&#x27;s provincial election. There was widespread discontent with the overly cautious behaviour of the UFA government, and in some cases, local UFA chapters openly supported Social Credit candidates. The UFA government was also reeling from a scandal that had forced Reid&#x27;s predecessor, John Brownlee, to resign a year earlier. This, in particular, caused some socially conservative UFA members to transfer their allegiance to the Christian-based Social Credit movement. The Social Credit Party campaigned on price controls, and social dividends of $25 a month to Albertan adults.

In the 22 August 1935 election, much to its own surprise, Social Credit won a landslide victory, taking 54% of the vote and winning 56 of the 63 seats in the Legislative Assembly. The only elected opposition was five Liberals and two Conservatives. The UFA lost all of its seats in the worst defeat for a sitting provincial government in Canadian history. Alberta thus elected the first Social Credit government in the world. The Social Credit Party&#x27;s success is largely attributed to the charisma of Aberhart, who brought together a broad coalition ranging from social credit supporters to moderate socialists.

Not even the Socreds had expected to win the election. Indeed, they hadn&#x27;t even named a leader during the campaign. The Socreds now found themselves having to choose a formal leader who would become the province&#x27;s new premier. Aberhart was the obvious choice, having been the party&#x27;s driving force from the beginning. He didn&#x27;t want the office, but was persuaded to take power. He was elected as leader and premier-designate at the party&#x27;s first caucus meeting, and was sworn in on 3 September. He became a Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) a year later in a by-election.

The first year and a half in power was a period of adjustment for the newly elected Socred MLAs and their premier. Certain historians believe that much of the Social Credit Party&#x27;s leadership, and many of its members, didn&#x27;t understand Douglas&#x27; teachings. Negotiations between Aberhart and Douglas, who had been hired by the UFA as a financial advisor, were colourful but unproductive. Aberhart, consumed with details of governance and administration, made little progress along the social credit monetary reform road. After election he hired an orthodox financial expert named Magor, much to Douglas&#x27;s displeasure, thus forestalling radical monetary reform. In March 1937 many Socred MLAs revolted against Aberhart&#x27;s leadership, refusing to pass the provincial budget until Aberhart promised serious reform of the banking system.
====Not &quot;funny money&quot;====
Following the 1937 revolt, the government made a serious attempt to implement social credit policies. It passed several pieces of radical populist legislation, such as the issuance of prosperity certificates to Alberta residents (dubbed &quot;funny money&quot; by detractors) in accordance with the theories of Silvio Gesell. Douglas, the main leader of the Social Credit movement, did not like the idea of prosperity certificates, which depreciated in value the longer they were held, and openly criticized Gesell&#x27;s theories.

The Socreds also passed bills that would have placed the province&#x27;s banks under government control. However, Lieutenant-Governor John C. Bowen refused to grant Royal Assent to the bills. The Supreme Court of Canada sided with Bowen and struck down the bills because only the federal government can legislate on banking. Thwarted in its attempt to gain control of Alberta&#x27;s private banks, Aberhart&#x27;s government gained a foothold in the province&#x27;s financial sector by creating the Alberta Treasury Branches (ATB) in 1938. ATB has become a lasting legacy of Social Credit Party policies in Alberta, operating as an orthodox financial institution and crown corporation. It is today the only government-owned financial institution in Canada that provides commercial banking to the public.

Bowen also refused Royal Assent to the government&#x27;s &quot;Accurate News and Information Act&quot;, which would have forced newspapers to print government rebuttals to stories to which the Executive Council (cabinet) objected. The government&#x27;s relationship with Bowen became so acrimonious that in 1938, Bowen threatened to use his reserve power to dismiss Aberhart. In the end, Bowen chose not to take this extraordinary action. Had Bowen sacked Aberhart, it would have triggered a new election, and the Socreds were so popular that they would have almost certainly been re-elected.

==== Labour policies ====
Though Aberhart&#x27;s government initially enjoyed widespread support from Alberta&#x27;s working class, labour unions viewed his government with suspicion, and believed that Aberhart was authoritarian. A number of labour leaders took issue with the party&#x27;s campaign to control prices, fearing that this would also lead to strict wage controls. Aberhart&#x27;s administration legislated the right to organize, although labour leaders viewed these protections as too weak to be meaningful.

In 1937, the administration created the Board of Industrial Relations, which was tasked with enforcing maximum working hours, minimum wages, and certifying workers&#x27; bargaining agents. The creation of the board, and its enforcement, won the praise of the Alberta Federation of Labour. The Alberta Federation of Labour also praised the administration&#x27;s Workmen&#x27;s Compensation Board, although many unions affiliated with the Canadian Congress of Labour, including the province&#x27;s largest union, the 18th District of the United Mine Workers of America, took issue with the Workmen&#x27;s Compensation Board&#x27;s leadership.

==== Other policies ====

To uphold its election promise of democratizing Alberta&#x27;s government, Aberhart passed a law allowing for the recall of members of the Legislative Assembly by petition of constituents. However, he repealed the legislation when he himself became the target of a recall drive.

Continuing the UFA government&#x27;s conservatism (which verged on prohibition) on the matter of drinking, Aberhart&#x27;s government enacted several socially conservative laws, notably one restricting the sale and serving of alcohol. It was one of the strictest such laws in Canada. Well into the 1960s, commercial airlines could not serve alcohol while flying over Alberta.

As well, the government passed stronger labour legislation, such as a minimum wage law for male workers (female workers already coming under legislation passed by the UFA government), and centralized the province&#x27;s school system.

===Manning era===

The latter years of Aberhart&#x27;s government saw a decline in popularity, with party membership falling from 41,000 in 1938 to just 3,500 in 1942. The Albertan public recognized that the party&#x27;s initial campaign promises, such as price controls and social dividends, were failing to materialize. Social Credit was elected with a slightly reduced mandate in 1940. &quot;Bible Bill&quot; Aberhart died in 1943, and was replaced by his Provincial Secretary and Minister of Trade and Industry, Ernest Manning.

For the 1944 election, Manning campaigned on the labour protections that the party had implemented, using support from the Alberta Federation of Labour to fend off left-wing challenges from the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation and the Labor-Progressive Party. Though other unions, particularly those affiliated with the Canadian Congress of Labour, took issue with the Social Credit Party&#x27;s workers&#x27; protections, divisions within these unions and their leadership prevented any effective endorsement of the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation. During the campaign, Manning engaged in red-baiting on a number of instances, likening the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation to &quot;the socialism of Germany&quot;. In the election, Manning led the Alberta Social Credit Party to retain a solid majority in the Legislative Assembly.

As a result of an oil boom in the late 1940s,&quot;&quot; Alberta received high amounts of oil royalties during much of Manning&#x27;s term as premier,&quot;&quot; enabling large amounts of spending on education and healthcare.&quot;&quot; Under Manning&#x27;s leadership, the party largely abandoned social credit monetary theories, though it did issue prosperity certificates from oil royalties in 1957 and 1958. Manning moved to purge anti-Semites from the party. While anti-Semitism had been part of the party&#x27;s Christian populist rhetoric for years, it had become far less fashionable after World War II. Several socially conservative laws remained in place for years, such as the ban on airlines serving alcohol over provincial airspace.

Manning led Social Credit to seven consecutive election victories. He governed with very large majorities for virtually his entire tenure, winning well over 50 percent of the popular vote and rarely facing more than ten opposition MLAs. For most of the next two decades, Alberta was virtually a one-party state.

He wielded considerable influence over the party&#x27;s federal counterparts as well. For example, he let it be known that his province would never accept francophone Catholic Real Caouette, leader of the party&#x27;s Quebec wing, as the party&#x27;s leader—even though Caouette headed the party&#x27;s third-strongest faction (behind the Alberta and British Columbia Socreds). This led to rumours that Caouette had defeated Robert N. Thompson for the federal party&#x27;s leadership in 1961, only to have his win vetoed by Manning and the Alberta Socreds.

==== Anti-communism ====
In 1946, Manning&#x27;s government began a Red Scare, censoring &quot;communist propaganda films&quot; in the hopes of &quot;eliminating communist thought from Alberta-shown movies&quot;. Alberta&#x27;s government quickly began banning films, including films produced by the British government which supported the United Nations, as well as Hollywood films such as &quot;The Wild One&quot; and &quot;Blackboard Jungle.&quot; The government&#x27;s attempts at film censorship continued through the 1960s.&quot;&quot; Censoring films sympathetic to international cooperation due to allegations of communism,&quot;&quot; greatly weakening workers&#x27; protections,&quot;&quot; and seeking to create a welcoming environment for oil investors.&quot;&quot;

Ernest Manning&#x27;s government was starkly right-wing, attacking a number of unions with charges of communism,&quot;&quot; censoring films sympathetic to the New Left, and international cooperation due to allegations, and its connection to communism. Manning engaged in red-baiting on a number of instances, likening the CCF to &quot;the socialism of Germany&quot;. Saying in one &quot;letter to a CCFer, who... had naively written to suggest CCF-Social Credit electoral co-operation: &quot;it&#x27;s an insult to suggest to the Canadian people who are sacrificing their sons to remove the curse which the socialism of Germany has brought in the world that their own social and economical security can be attained only by introducing some form of socialism in Canada. the premise embodied in your proposed resolution, namely, that there is such a thing as democratic socialism, contradicts itself in that it attempts to associate two concepts of life which are diametrically opposed and opposite.&quot;&quot; And that socialists were trying to &quot;enslave the ordinary people of the world, whose only real salvation lay in the issuance of Social Credit.&quot; Censoring films sympathetic to international cooperation due to allegations of communism,&quot;&quot; greatly weakening workers&#x27; protections,&quot;&quot; and seeking to create a welcoming environment for oil investors.&quot;&quot;

The former social credit board chairman Alfred Hooke who became provincial secretary in 1943 &quot;came even closer than Manning in negating the differences among democratic socialism, communism, and the socialism of national socialism. Durning the Throne debate in February 1944, Hooke said: &quot;I wonder if this is what our boys are fighting for? They are being told today by many spokesmen in Canada that socialism is the answer to their problems. If this is true, Mr Speaker, why send them to Europe to fight against it? Why don&#x27;t we tell them that international finance, their worst enemy, is backing the philosophy of socialism.&quot;&quot;

Manning also fought against the media and education system, believing that they were full of Marxists and sympathetic to the communist cause. Stating that it is &quot;evident, in my view, in the news media, which are very heavily slanted, as a general rule favorably slanted, to socialist philosophy. This isn&#x27;t by chance, it&#x27;s because communism has been smart enough to see... that there are always a goodly number of men in that field who are sympathetic to the socialistic and even communistic philosophy. You even have the same thing, to varying degrees, in the field of education. It isn&#x27;t by chance that you find these agitations of Marxism and so forth in many of our universities. It isn&#x27;t by chance.&quot;

===== Red Scare =====
The Manning administration now re-elected with a resounding majority of seats as a result of the 1944 election, devoted itself to an anti-socialist crusade.&quot;&quot; In 1946, Manning&#x27;s government began a Red Scare, censoring communist propaganda films in the hopes of &quot;eliminating communist thought from Alberta-shown movies&quot;.

Manning&#x27;s administration also sought to disrupt labour strikes, denouncing them as communist, totalitarian, and anti-Christian.&quot;&quot; Labour unions subsequently defended themselves as non-communist, or simply refused to respond to these charges in the hopes of maintaining good relationships with the government.&quot;&quot; In January 1948 a coal miners&#x27; strike broke out. With thousands of miners, threatening the provincial Electrical grid, as most electricity was generated from coal. With this one strike alone accounting for 30% of all time lost to strikes in Canada in 1948. In Alberta, the time lost was even worse. With it being responsible for well over 99% of all person-lost days due to strikes for the entire year. Manning acted swiftly to avert the crisis. Rewriting the province&#x27;s labour laws in March to allow the government to shut down the strike. Greatly weakened by charges of communism, and Manning&#x27;s Stallworth defiance of union threats caused the unions to attempt to persuade legislators instead of protesting using strikes, or violence. Manning&#x27;s steadfast defiance in the face of union threats halted the rise of militant unionism in Alberta, as it did in other areas like Quebec and the rust belt.

In 1945 the Wetaskiwin MP Norman Jaques &quot;spoke for most of the party establishment when he charged... that communists had infiltrated the CBC &#x27;as they have every other organization.&#x27;&quot; In 1951, the province&#x27;s Minister of Municipal Affairs, C.F. Gerhart, claimed that there were hundreds of communist spies among Albertan workers.

==== Oil production ====
Manning prided his administration&#x27;s good relations with oil investors,&quot;&quot; which the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation attempted to use against him in the 1948 election.&quot;&quot;

Beginning in 1947, Alberta experienced a major oil boom, aiding Manning in fending off political challenges.&quot;&quot; In campaigning for the 1948 election, the Alberta Social Credit Party purported that the development of the province&#x27;s petroleum industry was the main issue at stake, and touted the newfound prosperity resulting from this oil to win another strong majority in the Legislative Assembly.&quot;&quot; During the campaign, the party used such prosperity to fervently denounce the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation&#x27;s calls for public ownership of the oil industry.&quot;&quot;

By the mid-1950s, oil royalties provided the Albertan government with the majority of its total revenue, and the province enjoyed significantly higher per capita revenue than its Canadian counterparts.&quot;&quot; This enabled the government to spend large amounts on education and healthcare,&quot;&quot; which some historians view as partially responsible for Manning&#x27;s high levels of popular support.&quot;&quot;

===Decline===
Manning&#x27;s last election win in 1967 demonstrated a weaker standing of the Alberta Social Credit Party. While the New Democratic Party emerged as a new challenger to the Social Credit Party, they were wary of the strong anti-communist and anti-union sentiments formed in Alberta, and ran a modest campaign alleging corruption within Manning&#x27;s administration.&quot;&quot; However, historians suggest that a number of other problems were brewing during Manning&#x27;s later years, such as the province&#x27;s poor mental health system, the poor conditions of the native Albertan peoples, high housing and land prices, and relatively low royalty prices on oil.&quot;&quot; Despite winning 55 of the 65 seats in the legislature, it received less than 45% of the popular vote—its lowest share of the popular vote since 1940. This was a significant drop from 1963, when it took all but six seats.

More importantly, the once-moribund Progressive Conservatives, led by young lawyer Peter Lougheed, won six seats, mostly in Calgary and Edmonton. Despite having long-standing support in Calgary and Edmonton (Manning himself represented an Edmonton riding), Social Credit was at bottom an agrarian-based party, and never really lost this character. The party didn&#x27;t react nearly fast enough to the changes in Alberta as Calgary and Edmonton gained more influence.

Manning retired in 1968 and was replaced by Agriculture Minister Harry Strom at the party&#x27;s first leadership election. However, Strom soon was eclipsed by Lougheed, whose modern and urbane image contrasted sharply with that of the dour Strom. His cause was not helped when the Tories picked up an additional four seats during the term.

In the 1971 election, Lougheed&#x27;s PCs ended Social Credit&#x27;s 36-year hold on power. The Socred share of the popular vote decreased slightly, but still they finished only five points behind the PCs and won a record number of votes (due in part to Alberta&#x27;s larger population). While they mostly held their own in their rural heartlands, their support in Edmonton and Calgary plummeted from 1968. The PCs took every seat in Edmonton, and all but five in Calgary. The Socreds lost a number of ridings by a small margin. However, due to the first past the post system, which awards seats to the candidate with the most votes in a district, even if they do not get a majority of votes (and awards power based on seats won), Social Credit&#x27;s caucus was cut almost in half. It was cut down to 25 seats, and was consigned to the opposition benches for the first time in party history.

Strom led the Socreds into opposition, but resigned as party leader in 1973. Former Health Minister James Douglas Henderson became interim leader, and hence Leader of the Opposition. In the 1973 leadership election, Werner Schmidt, vice-president of Lethbridge Community College, who didn&#x27;t hold a seat in the Legislative Assembly, ran against former Highways Minister Gordon Taylor, former Education Minister Robert Curtis Clark, and John Ludwig, dean of business education at Alberta College.

Clark, who had the support of half of the party&#x27;s MLAs, led Schmidt on the first ballot, 583 votes to 512 votes. But in an upset victory, Schmidt won on the second ballot with 814 votes, defeating Clark by 39 votes.

First ballot
*Clark 583
*Schmidt 512
*Taylor 406
*Ludwig 71
(Ludwig eliminated, Taylor withdraws)

Second ballot
*Schmidt 814
*Clark 775

Social Credit sank into near-paralysis in opposition. Having spent all but a few months of its history before the 1971 government, it was unable to get the better of the Tories. It didn&#x27;t help matters that Schmidt was never able to get into the legislature; he lost a by-election shortly after taking the leadership. Henderson remained parliamentary leader until September when Clark succeeded him.

The party&#x27;s support collapsed in the 1975 election, when it fell to four seats—just barely holding onto official party status—and lost half of the popular vote it had received in 1971. Schmidt failed to win a seat and resigned as party leader, leaving Clark to take the leadership unopposed. Under Clark, the party staved off a total collapse in the 1979 election, holding onto its four seats.

===Dormancy in the 1980s===
Clark returned to the backbench a little more than a year after the election. On 29 November 1980, former Calgary mayor Rod Sykes became the party&#x27;s new leader, defeating Edmonton alderman Julian Kinisky 538–292. Again without its leader in the legislature, the party continued to sag in the polls.

The beginning of the end for Social Credit came when Clark retired from politics in 1981. His seat of Olds-Didsbury, a longstanding Social Credit bastion (parts of the riding had been in Social Credit hands for all but one month since 1935), was resoundingly lost to Western Canada Concept. In the process, Social Credit lost official status in the legislature. Unable to resolve the party&#x27;s internal and financial problems, Sykes quit as leader in March 1982.

On 31 March 1982, Social Credit parliamentary leader Raymond Speaker, the leader of the opposition in the Legislative Assembly, announced that Social Credit would sit out that year&#x27;s election. In his press release, he said it would be useless for Social Credit to fight the next election since there were not enough Social Credit voters left in the province.

The Social Credit Party council quickly distanced itself from Speaker&#x27;s statement. There was wide speculation at the time that Speaker would cross the floor to Western Canada Concept. Unable to attract a new leader, the Social Credit membership held an emergency meeting 18 September 1982. A resolution was put forward that would have dissolved the party. This was soundly rejected by the attending delegates and a new president was elected.

As soon as the writs were dropped in October, Speaker and Walt Buck left the party to become independent candidates for the legislature. The party&#x27;s third MLA, Fred Mandeville announced his retirement. For the first time since 1935, the party had no incumbents. George Richardson was named acting leader.

Social Credit went into the 1982 election in a precarious position. Not only was it without a full-time leader or incumbents, but it had been unable to get its leader elected to the legislature at any point during the parliamentary term. The party ran only 23 candidates and garnered only 0.8 percent of the vote. It was shut out of the Legislative Assembly altogether for the first time, and has never elected another MLA.

In 1986, Social Credit, Western Canada Concept and the Heritage Party of Alberta joined to form the Alberta Alliance Political Association. The Alliance fell apart when the WCC left, followed by Social Credit. The AAPA became the present-day Alberta Party. Social Credit sat out the 1986 election. Most of its remaining supporters joined and ran for the Representative Party, which had been formed by Speaker after he and Buck were denied funding normally reserved to opposition parties.

===Rebirth in the 1990s and decline===
Interim leadership of the party was given to Martin Hattersley, an Edmonton lawyer, and later to Harvey Yuill of Barrhead. What remained of the party ran six candidates in the 1989 election. The party was rekindled under the leadership of Robert Alford from 1990 to 1992. In 1991, Randy Thorsteinson, a Reform Party of Canada activist, was elected as party president. In 1992, Thorsteinson was elected as leader, and Robert Alford as president. Social Credit improved its performance in the 1993 election, but won no seats. In the 1997 election, the party nominated 70 candidates, and won 64,667 votes, over 7% of the popular vote.

After the 1997 election, polling revealed that the Social Credit Party was poised for a break-through: an estimated 150,000 Albertans would have been ready to once again support Social Credit as an alternative. This could have meant eight seats in the Legislature. However, in April 1999, Thorsteinson, a devout member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, resigned to protest an internal party proposal to limit Mormon involvement within the party. Social Credit&#x27;s fortunes quickly faded.

In November 1999, James Albers was elected over Jon Dykstra and Norm Racine to lead the party in a hotly contested race. Wiebo Ludwig was disqualified. During the election of 2001, the right wing vote fractured between the newly formed Alberta First Party and Social Credit. Most right-wing voters went back to supporting the Progressive Conservatives, who had experienced a resurgence in popularity.

Thorsteinson founded the Alberta Alliance Party in October 2002.

Lavern Ahlstrom was appointed Social Credit leader in February 2001. Under Ahlstrom&#x27;s leadership, the party made moves toward re-embracing elements of social credit monetary theory.

The party nominated 12 candidates in the 2001 election (down from 70 in 1997) and received 5,361 votes (0.5% of the popular vote), down from 64,667. The party nominated 42 candidates for the 2004 election, and won 10,874 votes (1.2% of the popular vote, an increase of 0.7% from 2001.) It polled well in a few ridings, most notably Rocky Mountain House where Lavern Ahlstrom tied for second place.

In late 2005, the party entered discussion about merging with the Alberta Party and the Alberta Alliance. Despite cooperation and successful merger talks between the party leaders, the Social Credit Party membership voted down the motion to merge at the 2006 Social Credit Convention.

In the Drumheller-Stettler by-election on 12 June 2007, the party&#x27;s candidate Larry Davidson placed third with 11.7% of the vote.

===Alberta Social Credit in the 21st century===
In early November 2007, Len Skowronski replaced Lavern Ahlstrom as leader of the party.

The party fielded eight candidates for the 2008 general election on 3 March. The party received 0.22% of the total or 2,051 votes, a decline of 1.0% from the previous election. The best individual riding result, and the only result over 3.0 percent, was for Wilf Tricker in Rocky Mountain House, who received 6.4% of the vote, finishing fifth in a field of seven candidates, just 0.62% behind the Green candidate and well ahead of the NDP and Separation Party of Alberta candidates.

It fielded three candidates in the 2012 election, and garnered 0.023% of the total vote. Its six nominated candidates won 832 votes in the 2015 election, 0.056% of the total vote—an increase of 0.033% over its 2012 result.

===Pro-Life Alberta Political Association===

In 2016, pro-life activist Jeremy Fraser won the Social Credit Party&#x27;s leadership. Bearing no resemblance to its predecessor, the Party changed its registered name with Elections Alberta to the Pro-Life Alberta Political Association (or Prolife Alberta, for short). The change in name reflected the change in direction from the comprehensive political platform of Social Credit, to the singular focus of promoting pro-life public policy. Whereas Alberta Social Credit had aims of forming government, Prolife Alberta is a single-issue political association solely focused on promoting right-to-life issues, and anti-abortion efforts, in the province of Alberta.

Prolife Alberta advertises itself as &quot;...a group of women and men committed to promoting pro-life public policy in Alberta, through politics.&quot;

<text>David Jay Bercuson (born 1945) is a Canadian labour, military, and political historian.

== Career ==
Born on 31 August 1945 in Montreal, Quebec, he attended Sir George Williams University, graduated there in 1965 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in history, and was awarded the Lieutenant-Governor&#x27;s Silver Medal for the highest standing in history. He continued his studies at the University of Toronto under Ken McNaught and Ramsay Cook and received Master of Arts and Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) degrees in history in 1967 and 1971, respectively. His doctoral thesis was &quot;Labour in Winnipeg: The Great War and the General Strike&quot;. In 1970–1971, he was a visiting assistant professor at the University of Calgary. After he had received his PhD, he was appointed assistant professor. He is now a full professor at the University of Calgary and the director of the university&#x27;s Centre for Military and Strategic Studies. He is also the Director of Programs at the Canadian Defence and Foreign Affairs Institute, based in Calgary.

Bercuson has published academic and commercial books on a range of subjects, focusing primarily in modern Canadian politics, Canadian defence and foreign policy, and Canadian military history. He has written, coauthored, or edited more than thirty books. He also writes regular columns for &quot;Legion Magazine&quot;, the &quot;Calgary Herald&quot;, and the &quot;National Post&quot;, among other publications. He periodically does political and military commentary for CBC and CTV television. In 1991, he wrote with Barry Cooper &quot;Deconfederation: Canada without Quebec&quot; in which he argued that Canada would benefit from Quebec separation.

In 2001, Bercuson became Vice President of Research of the newly formed Canadian Defence and Foreign Affairs Institute, a Calgary-based think tank.

== Honours ==
Bercuson was elected as a fellow of the Royal Society of Canada in 1988. He received the J. B. Tyrrell Historical Medal in 2002 and in 2003 he was made an Officer of the Order of Canada. He was a recipient of the Vimy Award, which recognizes a Canadian who has made a significant and outstanding contribution to the defence and security of the Canadian nation and the preservation of its democratic values. Between 2002 and 2010, he was the Honorary Lieutenant Colonel of 41 Combat Engineer Regiment of the Canadian Forces. In 2012, he was awarded the Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee Medal.
In 2016, Bercuson was awarded an honourary Doctor of Laws from the Royal Military College of Canada

<doc id="456324" wikidata="Q5187624" url="?curid=456324" title="Cromniomancy">
<text>Cromniomancy is divination by onions. It is usually done by interpreting their sprouting behavior, after some kind of ritual to state the topic of the divination. This often involves inscribing the onions, dedicating them on an altar or something similar. But cromniomancy is/was also done in idiosyncratic way not involving sprouting them.

It is not known why the onion was chosen for that kind of divination, as opposed to other fast-sprouting plants. Comparing other divination methods shows that plants used for divination have or had some significance as important food source and/or as medicinal herbs. The onion is rich in vitamin C and was important because of this, and it was widely used as medicinal herb against colds and other infections.

==Etymology==
The word is derived from the Ancient Greek word for onion = κρόμμυον(phonetically crom-mee-on) and oracle = μαντεία (phonetically man-dee-ah). 

==History==
Cromniomancy was historically performed across Europe, Africa and northern Asia. The sphere within a sphere of the onion made it a much-revered symbol of spirituality and eternity, to the extent that the ancient Egyptians took their sacred oaths with their right hand on an onion. There are many forms of cromniomancy, from divining the weather by the thickness of the skin, to gaining inside information.

The earliest written mention occurs in Burton&#x27;s The Anatomy of Melancholy, referring to cromniomancies as a custom of laying onions on an altar on Christmas Eve in order to divine when someone will be married.

==Specific methods==
One method is to place onions on a sacred altar to learn about friends and family far away and out of contact. The names of the beloved are inscribed on individual onions and left undisturbed until they began to sprout. The faster the sprouting, the better health and happiness was enjoyed by the friend named on the onion.

Onions also provided romantic advice for the love-lorn. A woman trying to choose between lovers would carve out their names on separate onions. According to tradition, the onion that sprouted first was believed to unveil the suitor deemed most deserving of her affections. The one that sprouted first would reveal the suitor most worthy of her affections. Some sources have it that this should best be done on December 1.

Answers to any question could be sought by inscribing yes and no on two separate onions and planting them to see which sprouted first.

A method practiced in southern Germany to predict the weather for the following year goes like this: At Silvester evening twelve big, sphere-like pieces of onion are taken and put on a wooden board in a row. They represent the months from January to December. Then a grain of salt is put into every piece of onion, and the whole thing is left overnight in a room without heating, but without frost. The amount of liquid in every onion piece tells how much rain/snow there will be in the respective month.

<text>ITV plc is a British media company that holds 13 of the 15 regional television licences that make up the ITV network (Channel 3), the oldest and largest commercial terrestrial television network in the United Kingdom.

ITV plc is listed on the London Stock Exchange and is a constituent of the FTSE 250 Index.

==History==
===Pre-acquisition===
ITV plc was the result of Granada purchasing Carlton following the various mergers and acquisitions between the companies of the ITV network that had taken place from 1994 when the ownership rules were relaxed.

The first wave of mergers began with Yorkshire Television acquiring Tyne Tees Television in 1992, forming a parent group called Yorkshire-Tyne Tees Television. In 1994, Carlton Communications – which had owned a 20% stake in Central Independent Television – acquired the remainder of the company and, because of Central&#x27;s shareholdings, inherited a 20% stake in Meridian Broadcasting. Later that year, Granada acquired London Weekend Television through a hostile takeover worth in the region of £750 million. MAI, which controlled Meridian Broadcasting, acquired Anglia Television; MAI became United News &amp; Media after merging with United Newspapers – owners of &quot;The Daily Express&quot; in 1996. Ownership rules, that previously restricted ownership of ITV licences by one company to two outright, plus 20% in a third, were relaxed, and so Carlton went on to acquire Westcountry Television (later re-branding it Carlton, along with Central), Granada acquired Yorkshire-Tyne Tees Television (with the parent group becoming Granada Media, later simply Granada) and United acquired HTV.
The idiosyncrasies and business model of the future ITV plc operation can be found in the way these new conglomerates operated their licences. Carlton re-branded all of its stations with its own name, creating a single identity across the whole expanse of its territory. By contrast, Granada and United, while keeping the licencees&#x27; names, centralised their continuity departments – Granada in Leeds and United in Southampton. All three, however, merged the network production operations of their franchises, creating Carlton Productions, Granada Content and United Productions.

By the end of the 1990s, there were three dominating owners of the ITV franchises in England and Wales: Carlton Communications, Granada plc and United News and Media. In 2000, after an aborted merger attempt with Carlton, UNM decided to leave ITV and Granada bought all the UNM franchises, but sold HTV to Carlton in order to comply with the permitted audience percentage covered by a single broadcasting interest. It kept the production arm of HTV, however, renaming it Granada Bristol and moving it out of Bath Road to a new, smaller office in Whiteladies Road (near the BBC). This arm of the company closed in 2006, following later rationalisation of ITV&#x27;s production operations. The last remaining independent ITV franchise in England and Wales, Border Television, had been bought by Capital Group in 2000, and was sold on to Granada in 2001, with Border&#x27;s radio assets being retained by Capital Radio plc.

===The acquisition===

In 2004, Granada purchased Carlton and renamed itself ITV plc, a single company for all ITV franchises in England and Wales. One of the consequences of the merger was (according to the company) an over-capacity of studio facilities and production units around the country, which had previously been rivals, but were now all part of the same group. In order to make cost savings, several large regional headquarters, studio sites and programme departments closed and merged. Among the casualties were network production and studio facilities of Tyne Tees in Newcastle upon Tyne, Meridian in Southampton, Central in Nottingham and Anglia in Norwich. In all cases, ITV moved the regional franchisee to a new location complete with hi-tech facilities for news production, but with a minimal number of (physically smaller) studios and the loss of many jobs. Tyne Tees&#x27; factual department merged with Yorkshire&#x27;s in Leeds (which has since closed and re-emerged as Shiver Productions); Meridian&#x27;s factual and sport production moved to London; all network production in Nottingham was re-allocated to London, Manchester or Leeds (and the local &quot;Central News&quot; studio moved to Birmingham), and Anglia Factual, reduced to a satellite operation of ITV Studios and primarily producing output for the international market or occasionally third parties in the UK, was eventually closed in January 2012.

===Post-acquisition===
Prior to the acquisition, and despite being rivals within ITV, Granada and Carlton had already been involved in several joint ventures, including the digital terrestrial television operator ITV Digital that went bankrupt, and collapsed in 2002. They also owned the digital channel ITV2, which had launched in December 1998, and 65% of the (re-branded) ITV News Channel, previously owned by ITN and was originally launched as the ITN News Channel. As well as consolidating its (now 40%) shareholding in ITN itself, the newly merged company was able to buy the final 35% stake in the ITV News Channel from ITN&#x27;s original partners NTL in April 2004. In November the same year, and following a frantic last-minute deal with BSkyB to buy its half of the Granada Sky Broadcasting joint venture, they launched the digital channel ITV3, replacing Granada Plus which ITV plc closed down on satellite and cable. A year later they launched ITV4. However, due to multiplex issues (and the fact that it was losing money) the ITV News Channel controversially had its hours on Freeview reduced, and was finally closed down on 23 December 2005, with its Freeview space being taken over by replacements ITV4 and CITV, which launched in November 2005 and March 2006, respectively.

On 27 April 2005, ITV plc bought SDN, the digital terrestrial franchise holder of Multiplex A (now transmitting ten channels) from its shareholders, S4C and UBM for £134 million.

In April 2006, the participation channel ITV Play was launched. It was also an overnight block on ITV1. Following a series of scandals surrounding participation TV, the dedicated ITV Play channel was closed down in March 2007, followed by the late-night phone-in quiz shows on the ITV Network in December 2007, however the brand continued to be used for a time for part of the gaming section of itv.com.

In August 2006, the company sold its 45% shareholding in TV3 Ireland, which had been bought by Granada in 2001, to Doughty Hanson &amp; Co.

===Reorganisation===

There were rumours of take-over and merger bids during 2006. For example, on 9 November 2006, NTL announced that it had approached ITV plc about a proposed merger. The merger was effectively blocked by British Sky Broadcasting on 17 November 2006 when it bought a 17.9% stake in ITV plc for £940 million, a move that attracted anger from NTL shareholder Richard Branson and an investigation from media and telecoms regulator Ofcom. On 6 December 2006, NTL announced that it had complained to the Office of Fair Trading about BSkyB&#x27;s move. NTL stated that it had withdrawn its attempt to buy ITV plc, citing that it did not believe that there was any possibility to make a deal on favourable terms. At the same time as the NTL bid, RTL, the then-owner of Channel 5, was also rumoured to be preparing a bid for ITV plc, with the possibility of a stock-swap with BSkyB; the plan would have seen RTL acquiring BSkyB&#x27;s stake in ITV plc (with the aim of further acquisitions of shares in the future) in exchange for BSkyB taking full control of Channel 5.
In the end, no movement was made on this possible deal and RTL sold Channel 5 to Richard Desmond&#x27;s Northern &amp; Shell Network in July 2010.

The company then entered into a series of disposals of non-core activities: in March 2009 the company sold its investment in Friends Reunited (a website dedicated to reunited former school friends or colleagues in a number of countries) which it had acquired in December 2005. Also in May 2009 the company sold Carlton Screen Advertising (the largest cinema advertising business in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland and now known as Wide Eye Media).

In 2010, a large-scale business reorganisation, called the &quot;five-year Transformation Plan&quot; was launched. Thanks to stringent working capital management and cost management some of the set goals were already achieved in 2012. These include a ranking upgrade (from BB− to BB+), an increase in audience share and reduction of debt (from net debt of £730 million at the end of 2008, to a positive net cash position of £16 million at the end of the first quarter 2012).
In December 2013 the company sold its remaining shareholding in STV Group plc (owner of the Scottish and Grampian ITV licences) which had been bought by Carlton in 1999.

On 17 July 2014, BSkyB&#x27;s 6.4% stake in ITV was sold to Liberty Global, valued at £481 million.

On 19 October 2015, ITV purchased UTV for £100m ensuring that 13 out of the 15 licences (it does not hold the two wholly in Scotland) were in its control.

In July 2016 the company sold UTV Ireland to Virgin Media.

In August 2016, it was revealed that ITV had made an offer to acquire Canadian multinational film and television distributor Entertainment One for around £1 billion. On 10 August 2016, it was announced that eOne had rejected the offer, considering it to be &quot;fundamentally undervalued&quot;.

In 2017, it was announced that ITV plc had acquired a majority stake in British Production company World Productions, behind the hit BBC series &quot;Line of Duty&quot;. As a result of the deal, World Productions is now part of ITV Studios.

In 2022, the company announced the arrival of ITVX, which it said would be Britain&#x27;s first integrated advertising and subscription funded streaming platform, and would complement its catch-up service, ITV Hub, and would include access to BritBox.

On 1 June 2022, it was announced that it will be demoted from the FTSE 100, and became a constituent of the FTSE 250 Index on 20 June.

On 28 February 2024, ITV plc revealed a corporate brand refresh, reinforcing its three strategic pillars of expanding Studios, supercharging streaming and optimising broadcast. The new logo is a new coloured version of the logo introduced in 2013. The colours of the logo represent the streaming service, (ITVX) The main channel, (ITV 1) and ITV Studios.

On 23 November 2024, Sky News reported that CVC Capital Partners, TF1, RedBird Capital Partners, All3Media, Mediawan and KKR had been linked to a potential takeover bid for ITV plc and a possible break-up of core assets such as ITV Studios and ITVX.

On 30 January 2025, Reuters reported that RedBird IMI were in early-stage talks with ITV plc to merge the All3Media and ITV Studios production businesses.

==Operations==
===Organisation===
ITV plc is divided into two divisions:
* Media and entertainment, which operates the TV networks (including the ITV News Group, which runs the ITV regional licensees)
*ITV Studios, which comprises both UK and international production, ITV&#x27;s facilities businesses and Global Entertainment which exploits programme rights.

===Network licences===

Through ITV Broadcasting Ltd, ITV plc holds 13 of a total 15 ITV network licences, with STV holding two ITV licences in Scotland. ITV plc holds all licences in England and Wales, and the single ones in both the Channel Islands and Northern Ireland:

* Owned by Granada plc until 2004:
** North West England: Granada Television. Service now named ITV Granada.
** London (on weekends): London Weekend Television. Now part of the ITV London service.
** North East England: Tyne Tees Television. Service now named ITV Tyne Tees.
** East of England: Anglia Television. Service now named ITV Anglia.
** Yorkshire, Lincolnshire and North Norfolk: Yorkshire Television. Service now named ITV Yorkshire.
** English-Scottish border and Isle of Man: Border Television. Service now named ITV Border (broadcasting for the Isle of Man was taken over by ITV Granada).
** South and South East England: Meridian Broadcasting. Service now named ITV Meridian.
* Owned by Carlton Communications plc until 2004:
** London (on weekdays): Carlton Television. Now part of the ITV London service.
** Midlands: Central Independent Television. Service now named ITV Central.
** South West England: Westcountry Television. The service was renamed ITV Westcountry until 2009, before it was merged with ITV West to form the new non-franchise ITV West &amp; Westcountry region (rebranded as ITV West Country shortly after). This service became a licence in its own right from 1 January 2014 when it split from Wales and has an opt-out for the western sub-region (formerly the Westcountry region).
** West of England and Wales: HTV (Harlech Television). The franchise was renamed ITV Wales &amp; West, since it has traditionally held a &quot;dual-region&quot; licence for two areas, each one with its own service: ITV West (now the eastern sub-region of ITV West Country) and ITV Cymru Wales. From 1 January 2014 the dual-region licence was split into two separate licences for Wales and South West England (combining the former West and Westcountry regions).
* Owned by UTV Media plc until 2016:
** Northern Ireland: UTV
* Former independently owned:
** Channel Islands: Channel Television, service now named ITV Channel Television (since 2011).

ITV plc is also the sole owner of the ITV national breakfast television franchise ITV Breakfast, formerly known as GMTV, which airs and produces &quot;Good Morning Britain&quot;, and &quot;Lorraine&quot;.

===Channels===
ITV plc wholly owns all of its channels through ITV Digital Channels apart from ITV1. ITV plc also operates timeshift services and HD feeds for ITV1, ITV2, ITV3, ITV4 and ITVBe.

===Children&#x27;s television blocks===
ITV plc runs children&#x27;s programming through children&#x27;s television blocks. First is the long running children&#x27;s block CITV (formerly known as Children&#x27;s ITV) that launched 3 January 1983 on ITV. Currently the block is broadcast on ITV2 after being moved 2 September 2023, the morning after the closure of the CITV Channel. It is currently being broadcasts between 5am and 9am everyday. 
The second is the dedicated preschool block, LittleBe that launched on 3 September 2018, and ended on 31 May 2024. It was broadcast between 9am and 12am everyday on ITVBe. The launch of this block was to be a replacement for its predecessor called Mini CITV, originally launched 7 January 2014 on the CITV Channel. Mini CITV ended 7 January 2014 when the CITV Channel removed all preschool programming from both its weekday and weekend schedules with the exception of &quot;Sooty&quot;.

===Streaming===
ITV Catch Up was rebranded as the ITV Player on 5 December 2008. On 23 November 2015, the app and website were rebranded as ITV Hub. A paid subscription service allows users to watch ad-free and download content.

In November 2022, ITV announced a new streaming service to replace ITV Hub called ITVX. Launching on 8 December 2022, ITVX provides archive programming for which ITV plc owns the license, live events, and exclusive programming. There will be a free ad-supported tier and a premium subscription which will be ad-free and allow access to BritBox.

<text>The Naval Undersea Warfare Center (NUWC) is the United States Navy&#x27;s full-spectrum research, development, test and evaluation, engineering and fleet support center for submarines, autonomous underwater systems, and offensive and defensive weapons systems associated with undersea warfare. It is one of the corporate laboratories of the Naval Sea Systems Command. NUWC is headquartered in Newport, Rhode Island and has two major subordinate activities: Division Newport and Division Keyport in Keyport, Washington. NUWC also controls the Fox Island facility and Gould Island. It employs more than 4,400 civilian and military personnel, with budgets over $1 billion.

The current entity is composed of many elements of Navy undersea research, particularly acoustics and acoustic systems with weapons research and development history dating to the 19th century. Two major laboratories, in Newport and New London composed the largest elements of what is now Division Newport. Those laboratories were themselves made up of consolidated older laboratories and facilities dating from World War I.

==Early history==
===Newport, Rhode Island===
In 1869, the U.S. Naval Torpedo Station was founded in Newport, Rhode Island on Goat Island, the site of Fort Wolcott which was built in 1702 and served as an Army fort from 1794 to 1835. During the 1890s, Charles Munroe and John Bernadou worked at Newport, patenting a formulation of nitrocellulose colloided with ether and alcohol which was used as smokeless powder for naval artillery through the two World Wars. The Army adopted the Navy formulation in 1908 and began manufacture at Picatinny Arsenal.

A factory was built in 1907 to manufacture steam torpedoes for the Navy. The torpedo factory became a major employer in the Newport area, as Rhode Island congressmen protected it from competition. The Torpedo Station designed the Mark VI magnetic influence fuze for torpedoes during the 1920s. The Naval Torpedo Station researched and tested underwater weaponry through World Wars I and II, creating additional facilities on Rose Island, Fox Island, and Gould Island. In 1951, the station on Goat Island was reorganized:

For the next 15 years, it was the Underwater Ordnance Station, and then the Underwater Weapons Research and Engineering Station until 1970. That year, the Underwater Sound Laboratory from New London, Conn. was combined with the Newport facility to form the Naval Underwater Systems Center or NUSC. In 1992, the command was reorganized as the Naval Undersea Warfare Center, Division Newport.

===New London, Connecticut===

New London, Connecticut had been the site of World War I sound research since the establishment of the Naval Experimental Station there as a result of meetings between Navy and the Submarine Signal Company, manufacturer of submarine signals as navigation aids and active in underwater acoustics since establishment in 1901, the Western Electric Company and the General Electric Company. The companies, under naval supervision had established an acoustical research station at East Point, Nahant, Massachusetts. The Navy, under one of its officers involved in the corporate effort, established the Naval Experimental Station at Fort Trumbull where physicists and engineers, including scientists from nearby universities, worked under the direction of the Special Board on Antisubmarine Devices.

Though that laboratory had closed with the end of that war the same criteria and some of the same people advising made New London the logical place to site the East Coast laboratory in response to the Chief, Bureau of Ships, now Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA), April 10, 1941 request to the National Defense Research Committee to establish both an East and West coast antisubmarine warfare research laboratory. On July 1, 1941 the New London laboratory&#x27;s establishment got approval with management by Columbia University for a wide range of antisubmarine warfare work including, passive sonar, ocean acoustics and recording of underwater sounds for that work.

In 1944 the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) directed reorganization of the Underwater Sound Laboratory at New London for peacetime operation consolidating the Harvard Underwater Sound Laboratory, which had focused on physics of underwater sound, surface ship sonar and weapons systems, in Cambridge, Massachusetts with the New London laboratory. After recruiting scientists from both efforts the new Navy Underwater Sound Laboratory was established on March 1, 1945.

Significant accomplishments during World War II included the development of greatly improved surface ship and submarine sonar systems, acoustic homing torpedoes, sonobuoys, and acoustic mines. This work contributed greatly to the success against U-boats in the Battle of the Atlantic and the near-total destruction of the Imperial Japanese Navy and merchant fleets in the Pacific War.

==Predecessor organizations==
===Navy Underwater Sound Laboratory (NUSL) 1945—1970===
In July 1945 the Harvard facility&#x27;s equipment and many of its personnel were moved to the new Navy Underwater Sound Laboratory, New London. NRL oversaw NUSL until turning over direction to the Bureau of Ships. Navy laboratories were reorganized in 1966 under Director of Naval Laboratories, Naval Material Command, to consolidate expertise and decrease competition among laboratories.

The Bermuda Research Detachment, Tudor Hill Laboratory after formation of Naval Underwater Systems Center in 1970, and its Argus Island offshore tower and support/research vessel &quot;Erline&quot; were field detachments of NUSL. The laboratory was unique in that it was the only one in the Atlantic to be located adjacent to and have access to an operational Naval Facility of the Sound Surveillance System (SOSUS).

Research intensified during the Cold War, which was as much a technology race with the Soviets as it was an arms race. The Sound Lab&#x27;s efforts were key to the further development of both submarine and anti-submarine warfare.

===Naval Underwater Systems Center (NUSC) 1970—1992===
On July 1, 1970 the Naval Material Command independent laboratories, Navy Underwater Sound Laboratory at New London and the Naval Underwater Weapons Research and Engineering Station (NUWS) at Newport, were administratively combined to form the Naval Underwater Systems Center (NUSC) with headquarters in Newport.

The Bermuda Research Detachment, formed by NUSL in 1961, became the NUSC Tudor Hill Laboratory, a major field detachment on formation of NUSC in 1970. In July the next year the Atlantic Undersea Test and Evaluation Center (AUTEC) located in the Tongue of the ocean with the main facility on Andros Island, Bahamas, with a logistics component located at the Palm Beach International Airport became a detachment of NUSC. Among the smaller facilities and detachments were the underwater ranges at Narragansett Bay and Rhode Island Sound, field activities at Seneca Lake Facility, New York, Dodge Pond at Niantic, Connecticut, the Central Test and Evaluation Activity (CTEA), Fort Lauderdale, Florida.

NUSC was the lead laboratory in partnership with eight North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) nations to for the instrumented Azores Fixed Acoustic Range (AFAR) in the Azores based on Santa Maria Island. The range features three bottom fixed towers high by across set approximately in an equalateral triangle. Two towers are receive only and one is transmit and receive. The principle studies are in acoustic propagation, reverberations and ambient noise.

Much of the work involved sonar suites for both submarines and surface vessels; however, other work ranged from improved periscopes, computing, combat control systems, and communications. Illustrating the wide variety of work are some examples:

* NUSC continued work begun by its NUSL predecessor on Extremely Low Frequency (ELF) radio commendations with submarines proving communication with in 1963. That system went operational with first use on an attack submarine with in 1976 and for ballistic missile submarines with two years later.
* NUSC became the responsible for design of the MARK 113 fire control systems for Polaris/Poseidon ballistic missile submarines after its design proposal for the MARK 113 MOD 9 Conversion Program was chosen over that of the Naval Ordnance Laboratory. System development had begun at Newport in 1968 and continued after the formation of NUSC with successful introduction and selection of NUSC for oversight in 1971.
* Beginning in 1970 NUSC began work for the Naval Electronics Systems Command (NAVELEX) on tactical towed arrays for use by faster surface ships. That work led to NAVELEX sponsorship of research and development of towed surveillance arrays to augment the fixed bottom SOSUS arrays. That work, in cooperation with the NAVELEX Naval Undersea Center (consolidated with Naval Electronics Laboratory Center in 1977 to become Naval Ocean Systems Center (NOSC)), San Diego, to develop what became the Surveillance Towed Array Sensor System.

On 2 January 1992 a major consolidation of Navy laboratories resulted in NUSC becoming a part of the Naval Undersea Warfare Center.

===Naval Undersea Warfare Engineering Station (NUWES) Keyport===
In 1992 Naval Undersea Warfare Engineering Station (NUWES) at Keyport, Washington, became Naval Undersea Warfare Center (NUWC), Division Keyport. The station originated with realization that the only torpedo facility was on the Atlantic coast as the Navy increasingly began operating in the Pacific following the Spanish–American War. The Pacific Coast Torpedo Station was established on Puget Sound in 1914. In 1930 the name was changed to Naval Torpedo Station Keyport and in 1978 to Naval Undersea Warfare Engineering Station.

Keyport focused on torpedoes and other undersea weapons and in later decades undersea vehicles. Aside from the ranges at Keyport the station operated ranges in California and Hawthorne, Nevada and Hawaii.

===Other elements===
In the early 1940s a need for calibration and testing of sonar transducers was met by establishing the Underwater Sound Reference Laboratory (USRL). It was headquartered in New York with two field stations. One was at Orlando, Florida and the other was at Mountain Lakes, New Jersey. All activities were transferred to Orlando after the war under the Office of Naval Research. In 1966 the organization was renamed the Underwater Sound Reference Detachment (USRD) until its closure in 1997. The functions were transferred to Naval Undersea Warfare Center Division Newport, Underwater Sound Reference Division.

The Orlando lab was built on the archeological site of Fort Gatlin on the shore of Lake Gem Mary because the sinkhole-formed lake is very deep. The Orlando lab closed in 1997 due to the Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) with all its functions moving to Newport. The Leesburg, Florida deep-water facility at Bugg Spring, established in 1965, remained open. The Orlando building was turned over to civil administration thereafter.
