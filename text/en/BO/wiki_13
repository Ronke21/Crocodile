<text>East Cambridgeshire (locally known as East Cambs) is a local government district in Cambridgeshire, England. Its council is based in the city of Ely. The district also contains the towns of Littleport and Soham and surrounding rural areas, including parts of the Fens.

Since 2017 the district has been a constituent member of the Cambridgeshire and Peterborough Combined Authority, led by the directly elected Mayor of Cambridgeshire and Peterborough.

The neighbouring districts are South Cambridgeshire, Huntingdonshire, Fenland, King&#x27;s Lynn and West Norfolk and West Suffolk.

==History==
The district was formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972. The new district covered the area of three former districts, which were all abolished at the same time:
*Ely Rural District
*Ely Urban District
*Newmarket Rural District
The new district was named East Cambridgeshire, reflecting its position within the wider county.

==Governance==
East Cambridgeshire District Council provides district-level services. County-level services are provided by Cambridgeshire County Council. The whole district is also covered by civil parishes, which form a third tier of local government.

===Political control===
The council has been under no overall control since a change in allegiance in August 2024, which left the Conservatives with exactly half the council&#x27;s seats. They continue to form the council&#x27;s administration by virtue of holding the chair&#x27;s casting vote.

The first election to the council was held in 1973, initially operating as a shadow authority alongside the outgoing authorities until the new arrangements came into effect on 1 April 1974. Political control of the council since 1974 has been as follows:
===Leadership===
The leaders of the council since 2011 have been:
===Composition===
Following the 2023 election and a by-election in April 2024 and change of allegiance in August 2024, the composition of the council was:
The next election is due in 2027.

===Elections===

Since the last full review of boundaries in 2019 the council has comprised 28 councillors, representing 14 wards. Elections are held every four years.

===Premises===
The council is based at The Grange on Nutholt Lane in Ely. The building was originally a large Victorian house. It served as a maternity hospital from the 1940s until the 1970s. The building was acquired around the time East Cambridgeshire was created in 1974 and converted to offices. Several large extensions have since been added.

==Archaeology==
The Fenland Survey of archaeological finds carried out in the 1980s mentions an enumeration of findings made between 1884 and 1994 in the region to the north of Devil&#x27;s Dyke and Cambridge, from the Stone Age, the Bronze Age and the Iron Age (the region south of Devil&#x27;s Dyke is not yet included in the survey). By far the greatest quantities of bronze objects found in England were discovered in East Cambridgeshire.

The most important Bronze Age finds were discovered in Isleham (more than 6500 pieces), Stuntney, Soham, Wicken, Chippenham, Coveney, Mepal and Wilburton. These findings include swords, spear-heads, arrows, axes, palstaves, knives, daggers, rapiers, armour, decorative equipment (in particular for horses) and many fragments of sheet bronze. The greater part of these objects have been entrusted to the Moyse&#x27;s Hall Museum in Bury St Edmunds while other items are in the University of Cambridge Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology in Cambridge. Other finds include traces of cremations and barrows, golden torques, an extensive ditch system and a wooden track-way between Fordey Farm (Barway) and Little Thetford. Bronze razors have also been found and it is well known that Celts shaved their cheeks.

==Parishes==

The whole district is divided into civil parishes. The parish of Ely holds city status, and the parish councils for Soham and Littleport take the style &quot;town council&quot;.

<text>Fenland is a local government district in Cambridgeshire, England. It was historically part of the Isle of Ely. The district covers around of mostly agricultural land in the extremely flat Fens. The council is based in Fenland Hall, in March. Other towns include Chatteris, Whittlesey and Wisbech, the largest of the four.

Since 2017 the district has been a constituent member of the Cambridgeshire and Peterborough Combined Authority, led by the directly-elected Mayor of Cambridgeshire and Peterborough.

The neighbouring districts are East Cambridgeshire, Huntingdonshire, Peterborough, South Holland and King&#x27;s Lynn and West Norfolk. 

==History==
The district was formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972. The new district covered the area of six former districts, which were all abolished at the same time:
*Chatteris Urban District
*March Urban District

*Wisbech Municipal Borough
*Wisbech Rural District
*Whittlesey Urban District
The new district was named Fenland, referencing its position within the Fens.

==Governance==
Fenland District Council provides district-level services. County-level services are provided by Cambridgeshire County Council. The whole district is also covered by civil parishes, which form a third tier of local government.

===Political control===
The council has been under Conservative control since 1999.

The first election to the council was held in 1973, initially operating as a shadow authority alongside the outgoing authorities until the new arrangements came into effect on 1 April 1974. Political control of the council since 1974 has been as follows:
===Leadership===
The leaders of the council since 2014 have been:

===Composition===

The next election is due in 2027.

===Elections===

Since the last boundary changes in 2023, the council has comprised 43 councillors representing 18 wards, with each ward electing one, two or three councillors. Elections are held every four years.

In the 2019 election, twelve councillors – all Conservative – were returned unopposed to Fenland District Council, which topped the Electoral Reform Society&#x27;s list of &#x27;rotten boroughs&#x27;.

===Premises===
The council is based at Fenland Hall in March. The original building had been built in 1909 as the county hall for the former Isle of Ely County Council.

==Parishes==
The whole district is divided into 16 civil parishes. The parish councils for Chatteris, March, Whittlesey and Wisbech take the style &quot;town council&quot;.

==Economy==
The local economy has traditionally been built upon farming and food related industry. The food industry is now well established, and related processing, storage, packaging and distribution has become more sophisticated and diverse. The predominantly rural economy of the area also includes a strong industrial tradition, including brewing, brick making, can making, pet food production, printing and engineering, and many local residents commute outside the district to work or study.
The River Nene provides access to the sea via the Port of Wisbech. Other waterways provide opportunities for angling and other water based activities. Marinas are located in Wisbech and March.

The council run markets in three of the towns (the market in Wisbech is run by Wisbech Town Council) and a number of festivals and other events.

A proposal for a new Fenland rail link was agreed in June 2020.

Fenland council gave £370,400 to its chief executive Tim Pilsbury when he took early retirement in 2010–11.

== Awareness and promotion ==
The term &quot;Fen Tiger&quot; is associated with the Fens. A flag with a tiger is now linked with this part of the county.

A number of organisations such as the Fenland Archaeological Society (FenArch) and publications such as the &quot;Fenland Citizen&quot; and &quot;The Fens&quot; magazine cover much or all of the district. The Wisbech &amp; Fenland Museum for many years was the only museum covering the area, the district council ceased funding the museum in 2016.

<text>Penwith (; ) is an area of Cornwall, England, located on the peninsula of the same name. It is also the name of a former local government district, whose council was based in Penzance. The area is named after one of the ancient administrative hundreds of Cornwall which derives from two Cornish words, &quot;penn&quot; meaning &#x27;headland&#x27; and &quot;wydh&quot; meaning &#x27;at the end&#x27;.

Natural England have designated the peninsula as national character area 156 and named it West Penwith. It is also known as the Land&#x27;s End Peninsula.

==Geography==

The Penwith peninsula sits predominantly on granite bedrock that has led to the formation of a rugged coastline with many fine beaches. The contact between the granite and the adjoining sedimentary rock (mostly shales) is most clearly seen forming the cliffs at Land&#x27;s End, the most westerly point in the district and this geology has resulted in the mining that has made Cornwall famous. Tin and copper have been mined in the area since pre-Roman times and the landscape is dotted with ruined mine buildings. Inland, the peninsula is primarily granite with a thin top soil. This combined with Cornwall&#x27;s exposed position and the prevailing weather systems from the Atlantic Ocean means that, with the exception of the high moor areas, much of the area is a semi-bare plateau standing around 130 m above sea level. This is most evident on the north coast between St Just and Zennor where the remains of the ancient seabed of the Pliocene era are visible. Its highest point is Watch Croft (252 m).

There are several deep valleys cut into this plateau such as Lamorna on the south coast, where sufficient shelter from the weather is gained for trees to establish and grow. The shelter of these valleys and the mild climate gives Penwith a flora not seen anywhere else in the UK. Penzance&#x27;s Morrab Gardens is able to grow bananas. Penwith also contains an artificial lake, Drift Reservoir, which is located approximately 3 miles west of Penzance. In addition to Penwith&#x27;s status as a Heritage coastline, west Penwith, an area of 90 square kilometres, is considered an Environmentally Sensitive Area. Penwith lies within the Cornwall Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB).

The principal towns in Penwith are Penzance, the port town and seat of local government, and St Ives, one of the county&#x27;s most popular seaside resorts. The district is largely rural, and contains many villages, principal amongst them being Botallack, Carbis Bay, Crowlas, Drift, Gulval, Gwithian, Hayle, Lamorna, Lelant, Long Rock, Ludgvan, Madron, Marazion, Morvah, Mousehole, Nancledra, Newlyn, Paul, Penberth, Pendeen, Porthcurno, Sancreed, Sennen, St Buryan, St Erth, St Hilary, St Just in Penwith, Treen and Zennor.

As a small peninsula at the tip of a larger peninsula, the district is somewhat isolated from the rest of the UK. Two major transport routes terminate in the district, the A30 road and the Great Western Main Line railway. The St Ives Bay Line provides local transport between St Ives, and the main line at St Erth. A ferry to the Isles of Scilly, 28 miles (45 km) west-south-west of the district, is based in Penzance.

==History==
Penwith contains a great concentration of Bronze Age, Iron Age, and Celtic British archaeological remains. The most significant of them are described in a field guide first published in 1954. Tewdwr Mawr ( or &quot;&quot;) ruled over the area from Carnsew in the mid-6th century before returning to his patrimony in Cornouaille in Brittany around 577.

Penwith&#x27;s population has remained broadly static for the last one hundred and fifty years.

Penwith is believed to be the last part of Cornwall where Cornish was spoken as a community language. Dolly Pentreath, known as the last recorded speaker (but arguably not the very last) came from Paul in Penwith. A year following the death of Dolly Pentreath in 1777 Daines Barrington received a letter, written in Cornish and accompanied by an English translation, from a fisherman in Mousehole named William Bodinar stating that he knew of five people who could speak Cornish in that village alone. Barrington also speaks of a John Nancarrow from Marazion who was a native speaker and survived into the 1790s.

Chesten Marchant, d. 1676, a woman from Gwithian, is believed to have been the last &quot;monoglot&quot; Cornish speaker.

Canon Doble&#x27;s &quot;Cornish Saints Series&quot; included saints from this area: nine of these were reissued in 1960.

==Demographics==
Penwith had a population of 65,000 in the mid-2007 estimates. 96.4% of Penwith residents were born in the UK.

72% of people in the district gave Christianity as their religion, whilst nearly 18% of people stated that they are non-religious, compared to 15 per cent nationally.

Penwith has the 6th highest rate of divorce of any district in England and Wales at 13.4% of the over 16 population, and correspondingly also has one of the lowest percentages of married couple households.

Penwith district has one of the lowest levels of home ownership in the country (280th/376) and is ranked 4th for those without central heating. The district also has one of the lowest rates of second car ownership and is ranked 300 out of 376 districts in England and Wales.

The district has some of the highest indicators of bad health in the country and is ranked 28th and 41st for those described as having long term illness and general poor health respectively.

Penwith has one of the highest unemployment rates of any district, ranked 51st out of 376 districts, and also one of the lowest rates of degree level education at 16%, compared to the national average of 20% (244th/376). Penwith is also ranked as the district having the 28th largest retired population in England and Wales.

==Economy==
Penwith is an area of extreme economic deprivation. It is ranked as the 25th most deprived district in England, and it is located in Cornwall, the poorest county in England. It has been suggested that in fact this ranking understates the extent of the problem due to the difficulties of assessing deprivation in dispersed rural populations, and the socially and economically polarised nature of rural communities.

Deprivation manifests itself in the form of high youth unemployment, an above average proportion of workers in manual occupations, low mean income and a low percentage of people with higher degrees. High educational attainment up to GCSE and A-level demonstrates the depth of local talent, however, poor job opportunities and the absence, until recently, of a university in Cornwall has meant that much of this young talent leaves the area and never returns. As such Penwith was listed as an Objective 1 area by the European Social Fund, however, this status expired in 2006 with the programme closing on 31 December 2008. Traditionally, like much of the rest of Cornwall, Penwith&#x27;s economy relied heavily on mining and fishing and was badly affected by the decline of these industries. Although the district has tried to stimulate employment through tourism, many of these jobs are by definition seasonal or part-time and do not replace the skilled jobs lost by the closure of the mines.

===Mining===
Tin mining once played an important part in the economy of Penwith, with mines across the district including Levant, Botallack, Cape Cornwall, Ding Dong and Wheal Hope. Tin mines gradually became economically mined out through the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, as the easier seams were exhausted and more amenable sources of metal were discovered in South America. The collapse of the world tin cartel in 1985 finished what remained of the industry.

The last working mine in the district and one of the last in Cornwall was at Geevor which is now a heritage site and museum following grants totalling nearly £4 million from various sources including the Heritage Lottery Fund. The north of the district has arguably suffered the worst from the closure of the mines as there have been few jobs available to replace what was lost to mining. This is most notably the towns of St. Just and Pendeen which have very high levels of unemployment. Many miners from the district have emigrated over the last century in order to find mining jobs abroad.

===Fishing===
Despite the decline in the number of people employed in the fishing industry, it still plays an important part in the district&#x27;s economy. Newlyn harbour is the largest deep sea fishing port in England in terms of the value of fish landed (turnover &gt;£18 million 2004) and contributes 2% of the region&#x27;s GDP. The Newlyn fleet utilises a variety of catching methods, however, the vessels are comparatively small and mostly owned by their skippers in comparison with the large factory boats of Spain and France with whom they share their fishing grounds. Accusations of illegal overfishing by the French and Spanish fleets is a source of local friction. Until the 1960s, pilchards were the major catch landed at Newlyn, which were processed at the nearby pilchard works, before the fish fell out of favour with the public. A revival of pilchard fishing in Penwith in recent years occurred after a rebranding exercise as &quot;Cornish sardines&quot; (sardines are actually small pilchards). This has been helped by investment from the Objective One programme. Much of the catch is sold abroad in Spain and Italy.

===Farming===
Like much of the rest of the country, farmers in Penwith have in recent years been put under financial pressure, due to a withdrawal of subsidies from the EU Common Agricultural Policy, pressure from supermarkets and crises such as foot and mouth in 2001. Agriculture in Penwith is predominantly dairy with some arable crops such as potatoes, cauliflower and broccoli (confusingly these are locally called broccoli and calebrese, respectively). Cornwall&#x27;s mild climate and an absence of hard winter frosts mean that these cold-sensitive crops can be produced much earlier than in the rest of the country, and early Cornish new potatoes are a lucrative source of income. Unfortunately this cash crop has come under pressure in recent years due to globalization, which means competition with cheap imports from Egypt.

In 2002 the Farm Business Centre was set up to help farmers and farm businesses across Penwith. The centre aims to expand the local agricultural sector and provide advice and funding for farmers in the transition from intensive farming toward more sustainable agriculture. This encourages farmers to seek out novel sources of income such as set-aside and organic and small scale specialist produce such as meat from rare breed animals. A priority 4.6 grant from Objective One, plus funding from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs totalling more than £300,000 have ensured the centre’s future until September 2008.

===Tourism===
Penwith&#x27;s scenery makes it a popular holiday destination. Local attractions including the Minack Theatre, South West Coast Path, Land&#x27;s End and the Blue Flag beach at Sennen Cove ensure that tourism plays a major part in Penwith&#x27;s economy. Additionally, St. Ives has in recent years become a popular New Year&#x27;s Eve venue. Penwith also has the highest concentration of Neolithic sites in Europe, including monuments at The Merry Maidens, Lanyon Quoit, Chûn Quoit and an Iron Age village at Chysauster. Tourism accounts for 25% of Cornwall&#x27;s GDP and 19% of households in Penwith derive their income from this activity.

==Media==
Since 1878, Penwith has had a weekly newspaper, &quot;The Cornishman&quot;, based in Penzance. As well as Penwith, the paper covers the Isles of Scilly.

Penwith has its own community radio station, Coast FM (formerly Penwith Radio), which was launched on 5 November 2016 and broadcasts in West Cornwall on 96.5 and 97.2 FM.

== Penwith District Council ==

The district was created on 1 April 1974, under the Local Government Act 1972, as a merger of Penzance and St. Ives boroughs, St Just urban district, and West Penwith Rural District, and was abolished and replaced by the Cornwall Unitary Council on 31 March 2009.

From 1972 until 1974, a shadow Penwith authority existed where sitting members of the above-mentioned authorities acted in an advisory manner. With the abolition of the predecessor authorities in 1974 St Ives, Hayle, Marazion and St Just obtained Town Council status and from within their ranks began to elect Town Mayors. Penzance failed to obtain parish status for the former borough and Charter Trustees were appointed to continue elections for the position of Mayor of the town. Charter Trustees being the sitting members of Penwith District Council within the former borough area.

Penzance Town Council was finally created in 1980 initially electing 15 members, this was expanded to 20 members in 1999. From 1974 to the mid-1980s, Penwith District Council was dominated by independent members, only 4 out of the 34 councillors in 1981 held any political allegiance (a situation reflected in other Cornish Authorities at this time). By the late 1980s, however, the council became increasingly party politicised with the Conservative Party being the major political force on the council often forming coalitions with Conservative supporting independents to ensure the day-to-day operation of the Council. With the general down turn nationally for the Conservatives in 1990s, the Labour Party and to a lesser extent the Liberal Democrats began to make gains at the expense of Conservatives and at the high point of anti-conservative sentiment there remained only four Conservative councillors within the authority. The Conservatives recovered their support from the mid-1990s to regain their position as the largest party on the Council with the Liberal Democrats now forming the largest opposition group. Despite this, the council remained hung with no overall control. The final political composition, at the 2007 elections, being: Conservatives 17, Liberal Democrats 12,
Labour 1 (sits with Independent group) and Independent 5.

The district was abolished as part of the 2009 structural changes to local government in England.

==Twinning==
Since 1974 and until abolition the district of Penwith was twinned with

<text>Kerrier () was a local government district in Cornwall, England, United Kingdom. It was the most southerly district in the United Kingdom, other than the Isles of Scilly. Its council was based in Camborne (). Other towns in the district included Redruth and Helston. The district also contained the Lizard Peninsula.

&quot;Kerrier&quot; is named after one of the ancient administrative Hundreds of Cornwall, Kerrier, which covered broadly the same area, but did not have a coast on the north.

The district was formed on 1 April 1974, as a merger of the borough of Helston, the urban district of Camborne-Redruth and Kerrier Rural District. On 25 July 2007, Cornwall County Council&#x27;s bid for unitary authority status was accepted by the government. Kerrier District Council was abolished on 1 April 2009 as part of structural changes to local government in England.

Cornish musician Luke Vibert has released a number of albums and singles under the alias Kerrier District, as a nod to New York musicians Metro Area and a tribute to the place where he grew up.

<doc id="448988" wikidata="Q1756244" url="?curid=448988" title="Restormel">
<text>Restormel () was a borough of Cornwall, England, one of the six administrative divisions that made up the county. Its council was based in St Austell; its other towns included Newquay.

The borough was named after Restormel Castle. It was formed on 1 April 1974, under the Local Government Act 1972, by a merger of the borough of St. Austell with Fowey, Newquay urban district and St Austell Rural District. The name &quot;Restormel&quot; comes from Cornish, meaning the &quot;king&#x27;s tower hill&quot;.

The motto of the borough, in Cornish, is &quot;Ro an mor hag an tyr&quot;, meaning &quot;From the sea and from the land&quot;. It recognises the borough&#x27;s connection with the sea (fishing and tourism) and the land (china clay and agriculture). St Austell, the largest settlement in Cornwall, did not have a Parish/Town Council.

The district was abolished as part of the 2009 structural changes to local government in England on 1 April 2009.

==Twinning==
Restormel is twinned by oath, which used to be accessible to view in the council offices in St Austell, with Kreis Dithmarschen. This used to be part of the borough council; however, in recent years it has become a separate organisation.

==Council investments==
In March 2009, Restormel Borough Council was accused by spending watchdog the Audit Commission of &quot;negligence&quot; for putting money into Icelandic banks days before they went bust in October 2008.

<doc id="448990" wikidata="Q1924659" url="?curid=448990" title="List of Pinus species">
<text>Pinus, the pines, is a genus of approximately 111 extant tree and shrub species. The genus is currently split into two subgenera: subgenus Pinus (hard pines), and subgenus Strobus (soft pines). Each of the subgenera have been further divided into sections based on chloroplast DNA sequencing and whole plastid genomic analysis. Older classifications split the genus into three subgenera – subgenus &quot;Pinus&quot;, subgenus &quot;Strobus&quot;, and subgenus &quot;Ducampopinus&quot; (pinyon, bristlecone and lacebark pines) – based on cone, seed and leaf characteristics. DNA phylogeny has shown that species formerly in subgenus &quot;Ducampopinus&quot; are members of subgenus &quot;Strobus&quot;, so &quot;Ducampopinus&quot; is no longer used.

The species of subgenus &quot;Ducampopinus&quot; were regarded as intermediate between the other two subgenera. In the modern classification, they are placed into subgenus &quot;Strobus&quot;, yet they did not fit entirely well in either so they were classified in a third subgenus. In 1888 the Californian botanist John Gill Lemmon placed them in subgenus &quot;Pinus&quot;. In general, this classification emphasized cone, cone scale, seed, and leaf fascicle and sheath morphology, and species in each subsection were usually recognizable by their general appearance. Pines with one fibrovascular bundle per leaf, (the former subgenera &quot;Strobus&quot; and &quot;Ducampopinus&quot;) were known as &quot;haploxylon pines&quot;, while pines with two fibrovascular bundles per leaf, (subgenus &quot;Pinus&quot;) were called &quot;diploxylon pines&quot;. Diploxylon pines tend to have harder timber and a larger amount of resin than the haploxylon pines. The current division into two subgenera (&quot;Pinus&quot; and &quot;Strobus&quot;) is supported with rigorous genetic evidence.

Several features are used to distinguish the subgenera, sections, and subsections of pines: the number of leaves (needles) per fascicle, whether the fascicle sheaths are deciduous or persistent, the number of fibrovascular bundles per needle (2 in &quot;Pinus&quot; or 1 in &quot;Strobus&quot;), the position of the resin ducts in the needles (internal or external), the presence or shape of the seed wings (absent, rudimentary, articulate, and adnate), and the position of the umbo (dorsal or terminal) and presence of a prickle on the scales of the seed cones.

Both subgenera are thought to have a very ancient divergence from one another, having diverged during the late Jurassic.

==Subgenus &quot;Pinus&quot; ==
Subgenus &quot;Pinus&quot; includes the yellow and hard pines. Pines in this subgenus have one to five needles per fascicle and two fibrovascular bundles per needle, and the fascicle sheaths are persistent, except in &quot;P. leiophylla&quot; and &quot;P. lumholtzii&quot;. Cone scales are thicker and more rigid than those of subgenus &quot;Strobus&quot;, and cones either open soon after they mature or are serotinous.

===Section &quot;Pinus&quot;===
Section &quot;Pinus&quot; has two or three needles per fascicle. Cones of all species have thick scales, and all except those of &quot;P. pinea&quot; open at maturity. Species in this section are native to Europe, Asia, and the Mediterranean, except for &quot;P. resinosa&quot; in northeastern North America and &quot;P. tropicalis&quot; in western Cuba.

==Subgenus &quot;Strobus&quot; ==

Subgenus &quot;Strobus&quot; includes the white and soft pines. Pines in this subgenus have one to five needles per fascicle and one fibrovascular bundle per needle, and the fascicle sheaths are deciduous, except in &quot;P. nelsonii&quot;, where they are persistent. Cone scales are thinner and more flexible than those of subgenus &quot;Pinus&quot;, except in some species like &quot;P. maximartinezii&quot;, and cones usually open soon after they mature.

===Section &quot;Parrya&quot;===
Section Parrya has one to five needles per fascicle. The seeds either have articulate (jointed) wings or no wings at all. In all species except for &quot;P. nelsonii&quot;, the fascicle sheaths curl back to form a rosette before falling away. The cones have thick scales and release the seeds at maturity. This section is native to the southwestern United States and Mexico.

<text>Caradon was a local government district in Cornwall, England, United Kingdom. It contained five towns: Callington, Liskeard, Looe, Saltash and Torpoint, and over 80 villages and hamlets within 41 civil parishes. Its District Council was based in Liskeard .

The district was formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, by the merger of the boroughs of Liskeard and Saltash with the urban districts of Looe and Torpoint, along with Liskeard Rural District and St Germans Rural District.

The district was named after Caradon Hill, the principal landmark of the area, and formerly the site of important copper mines. The district was abolished as part of the 2009 structural changes to local government in England on 1 April.

==History==

===Hundreds of East and West Wivelshire===
All of Caradon is included in one of these two hundreds. East Wivelshire and West Wivelshire (usually known merely as East and West) are two of the ancient Hundreds of Cornwall. East and West (Wivelshire) must have originally had a Cornish name but it is not recorded (Wivel arises from the misdivision of Twivelshire, i.e. Two-fold shire). There are also Anglican deaneries by the same names but the modern boundaries do not correspond exactly. The area must have formed one hundred originally but had already been divided into two before the Norman Conquest: they are grouped in Domesday under the head manors of Rillaton (East) and Fawton (West). The Cornish names are: East (Ryslegh); West (Fawy).

<text>North Cornwall () is an area of Cornwall, England, United Kingdom. It is also the name of a former local government district, which was administered from Bodmin and Wadebridge . Other towns in the area are Launceston, Bude, Padstow, and Camelford.

North Cornwall is an area of outstanding natural beauty that is of great geological and scientific interest. It includes the only part of Cornwall that is formed of carboniferous rocks, the northern area of North Cornwall District. The rest of the district lies on Devonian sedimentary strata and the granite of Bodmin Moor. A similar area is covered by the North Cornwall parliamentary constituency.

==Geography==


North Cornwall has a stretch of coastline that borders the Celtic Sea to the north. The Carboniferous sandstone cliffs that surround Bude (and stretch down as far south as Crackington Haven) were formed during the Carboniferous period, around 300 million years ago. They are part of what are known to geologists as the Culm Measures which continue eastwards across north Devon. The folded and contorted stratification of shale and sandstone is unique in southern England. During the Variscan Orogeny, which affected the entire Cornish coast, the cliffs were pushed up from underneath the sea, creating the overlapping strata. As the sands and cliffs around Bude contain calcium carbonate (a natural fertiliser), farmers used to take sand from the beach, for spreading on their fields. The cliffs around Bude are the only ones in Cornwall that are made of Carboniferous sandstone, as most of the Cornish coast is geologically formed of Devonian slate, granite and Precambrian metamorphic rocks). The stratified cliffs of Bude gave their name to a geological event called the Bude Formation. Many formations can be viewed from the South West Coast Path which passes through the town.

The larger harbours are at Padstow and Bude and on the intervening coast Port Isaac, Port Gaverne, Port Quin, Port William, Tintagel, Bossiney and Boscastle have all been used either for fishing or the export of slate. There are good beaches at Polzeath, Trebarwith Strand and Bude. At Delabole the large Delabole Quarry has been worked for many centuries and there were once in the parish of Tintagel many other slate quarries. Granite and elvan have also been important minerals: there are major granite quarries in the parish of St Breward and also some china clay works on the edges of Bodmin Moor e.g. at Stannon near Camelford.

Most of the lowland areas have good agricultural land used either for mixed or dairy farming. At Davidstow much of the milk is processed into Davidstow cheese.

<text>South Lakeland was a local government district in Cumbria, England, from 1974 to 2023. Its council was based in Kendal. The district covered the southern part of the Lake District region, as well as northwestern parts of the Yorkshire Dales. At the 2011 Census, the population of the district was 103,658, an increase from 102,301 at the 2001 Census.

The district was created on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972. It was formed from the Kendal borough, Windermere urban district, most of Lakes urban district, South Westmorland Rural District, from Westmorland, Grange and Ulverston urban districts and North Lonsdale Rural District from Lancashire, and Sedbergh Rural District from the West Riding of Yorkshire.

In April 2023, Cumbria was reorganised into two unitary authorities. South Lakeland District Council was abolished and its functions were transferred to the Westmorland and Furness unitary authority.

==Governance==

Elections to the district council were held in three out of every four years, with one third of the 51 seats on the council being elected at each election. No political party held a majority on the council from the first election in 1973 to 2006. However, after winning a majority at the 2006 election the Liberal Democrats controlled the council. After a set of by-elections in 2021 the council was composed of the following councillors:-

The council was fined £120,000 in February 2015 after two women were killed in separate incidents by reversing rubbish lorries. An investigation by the Health and Safety Executive found they had failed to tackle the risks from reversing vehicles.

<doc id="448997" wikidata="Q1131007" url="?curid=448997" title="Borough of Copeland">
<text>The Borough of Copeland was a local government district with borough status in western Cumbria, England. Its council was based in Whitehaven. It was formed on 1 April 1974 by the merger of the Borough of Whitehaven, Ennerdale Rural District and Millom Rural District. The population of the Non-Metropolitan district was 69,318 according to the 2001 census, increasing to 70,603 at the 2011 Census.

The name was derived from an alternative name for the Cumberland ward of Allerdale above Derwent, which covered roughly the same area.

There are different explanations for the name. According to a document issued at the time of the borough&#x27;s grant of arms, the name is derived from &quot;kaupland&quot;, meaning &quot;bought land,&quot; referring to an area of the Forest bought from the estate of St Bees Priory.

In July 2021 the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government announced that in April 2023, Cumbria would be reorganised into two unitary authorities. On 1 April 2023, Copeland Borough Council was abolished and its functions were transferred to the new unitary authority Cumberland, which also covers the former districts of Allerdale and Carlisle.

==Demographics==
In 2014 the borough of Copeland was found to have the fattest population in England with a percentage of 75.9% being either overweight or obese (BMI greater than 25) according to official PHE statistics.

In 2018 Copeland had the third highest median income of UK local authorities, after the City of London and Tower Hamlets. However this median hides the wide differences in income between those who work at the Sellafield nuclear reprocessing site and elsewhere in the borough, leading to Copeland being described as &#x27;a community of two-halves&#x27;.

==Governance==

Elections to the borough council were held every four years, with 51 councillors being elected at each election. From the first election in 1973 the council had been under Labour control, apart from between 1976 and 1979 when it was under no overall control. At the time of the final election in 2019 the council was composed of the following councillors:

==Directly elected mayor==

On 22 May 2014 a referendum was carried out in the borough to change the style of governance in Copeland to a directly elected mayor, after campaigners from the &quot;Time For Change&quot; team successfully obtained enough signatures from 5% of the electorate in a petition. The referendum result was: For: 12,671; Against: 5,489.

The first election for mayor was held on 7 May 2015 and Mike Starkie (elected as an Independent candidate, but later joining the Conservative Party) was elected by 15,232 votes to the Labour Party candidate Steve Gibbon&#x27;s 14,259 votes.

<text>The Cherwell School is a secondary school with academy status on the Marston Ferry Road in Oxford, England. The current school site was built in 1963 as a secondary modern school, later becoming the main comprehensive school for North Oxford, with a catchment area extending down to the city centre, Grandpont, and New Hinksey. Along with later expansions, in 2003, and as part of a citywide reorganisation, it merged with the Frideswide Middle School, and is now a split site school of 2,000 pupils aged between 11 and 18. The Cherwell School is part of River Learning Trust.

==Recent changes==
The North site has recently undergone construction work, with the extension of the Sixth form common room. The original design, to accommodate only 100 pupils in years 12 and 13, became inadequate in recent years for the 300 or more pupils currently in the sixth form.

The main building work was construction of a new building alongside the existing block, and then removing the internal wall to create a much larger space. On the second floor of the structure, the school library has been extended to include quiet study areas, each with computer and desk facilities.

==Notable alumni==
Cherwell School alumni are called Cherwellians:

*Tom Bateman, actor.

<doc id="449001" wikidata="Q1532953" url="?curid=449001" title="Allerdale">
<text>Allerdale was a non-metropolitan district of Cumbria, England, with borough status. Its council – Allerdale Borough Council – was based in Workington, and the borough had a population of 96,422 at the 2011 census.

The District of Allerdale was formed under the Local Government Act 1972, on 1 April 1974 by the merger of the municipal borough of Workington, the urban districts of Maryport, Cockermouth and Keswick; and the rural districts of Cockermouth and Wigton, all of which were within the administrative county of Cumberland. In 1995 Allerdale was granted borough status.

The name derives from the ancient region of Allerdale, represented latterly by the two wards of Cumberland, called Allerdale-above-Derwent and Allerdale-below-Derwent, the present borough corresponding largely to the latter with parts of the former. Much of the area during the medieval period was a royal forest subject to forest law.

In July 2021 the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government announced that in April 2023, Cumbria would be reorganised into two unitary authorities. On 1 April 2023, Allerdale Borough Council was abolished and its functions transferred to the new unitary authority known as Cumberland, which also covers the former districts of Carlisle and Copeland.

==Settlements==

Workington was the largest settlement in the borough, and was the seat of the borough council. Allerdale House in Workington was the meeting place and primary office space used by the council. The building is known locally as &quot;Perry&#x27;s Palace&quot; after former council chief executive Tony Perry, who was responsible for its construction. Other settlements in the borough included: Abbeytown, Allonby, Aspatria, Bolton Low Houses, Bothel, Brigham, Broughton, Great Clifton, Cockermouth, Crosby, Dean, Dearham, Fletchertown, Flimby, Ireby, Keswick, Kirkbride, Maryport, Mawbray, Plumbland, Seaton, Silloth, Tallentire, Thursby, Waverton, Westnewton, and Wigton.

==Freedom of the Borough==
The following people and military units have received the Freedom of the Borough of Allerdale.


===Individuals===
* Malcolm Wilson: 28 March 2018.
* Ben Stokes: 25 September 2019.

==Politics==

Elections to the borough council were held every four years with 49 councillors being elected from 23 wards. No party had a majority on the council since Labour lost their majority at the 2003 election. From the 2019 election until abolition in 2023, the council was jointly administered by the Conservative Party and independents. From March 2021 to March 2023 the leader of the council was Mark Johnson, a Conservative.

==Derwent 7 parishes==
The Derwent 7 Community Led Planning Group was set up in 2007 by the town and parish councils of Above Derwent, Bassenthwaite, Borrowdale, Keswick, St John&#x27;s, Castlerigg and Wythburn, Threlkeld and Underskiddaw, with funding from Allerdale Borough Council, and was still in existence in 2017. It had four subgroups including one on transport, and a co-ordinating &quot;Cluster group&quot;.

The term &quot;Derwent Seven Parishes&quot; is used in defining the collecting scope of Keswick Museum, as Keswick is at the heart of the area covered by these parishes.

A map illustrating the area of the parishes is included in an appendix to a document produced by Sustainable Keswick.

<doc id="449004" wikidata="Q301637" url="?curid=449004" title="Eden District">
<text>Eden was a local government district in Cumbria, England, based at Penrith Town Hall in Penrith. It was named after the River Eden, which flowed north through the district toward Carlisle. Its population of 49,777 at the 2001 census, increased to 52,564 at the 2011 Census. A 2019 estimate was 53,253. In July 2021 it was announced that, in April 2023, Cumbria would be divided into two unitary authorities. On 1 April 2023, Eden District Council was abolished and its functions transferred to the new authority Westmorland and Furness, which also covers the former districts of Barrow-in-Furness and South Lakeland.

==Extent==
The Eden District area of 2,156 sq. km (832 square miles) made it, after 2009, the eighth largest in England and the largest non-unitary district. It also had the lowest population density of any district in England and Wales, with a mean of 25 persons per square kilometre.

In 2011, the population was 5 per cent above its 2001 level.

The district council was created on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, from Penrith Urban District, Alston with Garrigill Rural District and Penrith Rural District, all in Cumberland, and Appleby Municipal Borough, part of Lakes urban district and North Westmorland Rural District, all in Westmorland. The district included parts of the Lake District and Yorkshire Dales national parks.

==Green space==
It was shown in a national detailed Land Use Survey by the Office for National Statistics in 2005 that Eden District had the second lowest proportion of land taken up by roads of any district in England: 0.8 per cent, fractionally greater than Craven in North Yorkshire, which also adjoins the Pennines. This compares with a maximum of over 20 per cent in four London boroughs and the City of London.

In that detailed survey (to the nearest square metre) it was shown that Eden District had the greatest proportion of green space (which excludes domestic gardens) of any district, 97.9 per cent, as shown by the following extract:

==Wards==
Below is a list of the wards that formed Eden (with numbers of councillors):
==Map==

==Amenities==
Eden included King George&#x27;s Fields, named after King George V, at Appleby and Patterdale.

The council owned the Penrith Leisure Centre, which is run by a private company under contract. The council also owned a number of playing fields and recreation grounds elsewhere in the district, notably the sports grounds at Frenchfield near Carleton on the outskirts of Penrith. It
also owned and ran Penrith and Eden Museum and the Penrith Tourist Information Centre.

<text>East Devon is a local government district in Devon, England. Its council is based in the town of Honiton, although Exmouth is the largest town. The district also contains the towns of Axminster, Budleigh Salterton, Cranbrook, Ottery St Mary, Seaton and Sidmouth, along with numerous villages and surrounding rural areas.

The district borders Teignbridge and the City of Exeter to the west, Mid Devon to the north, Somerset to the north-east, and Dorset to the east.

Two parts of the district are designated as Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty: the Blackdown Hills in the north of the district and the East Devon AONB along the district&#x27;s coast and adjoining areas. The East Devon coastline from Exmouth to the border with Dorset is also part of the designated World Heritage Site of the Jurassic Coast; the designated area continues into Dorset as far as the Old Harry Rocks near Swanage.

==History==
The district was formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, covering the whole area of eight former districts and part of a ninth, which were all abolished at the same time:

*Axminster Rural District
*Budleigh Salterton Urban District
*Exmouth Urban District
*Honiton Municipal Borough
*Honiton Rural District
*Ottery St Mary Urban District
*St Thomas Rural District (parts north-east of Exeter, rest went to Teignbridge)
*Seaton Urban District
*Sidmouth Urban District

The new district was named East Devon, reflecting its position in the wider county.

==Governance==
East Devon District Council provides district-level services. County-level services are provided by Devon County Council. The whole district is also covered by civil parishes, which form a third tier of local government.

===Political control===
The council has been under no overall control since 2019. From May 2020 to May 2023, it was run by a political grouping composed of Liberal Democrats, Greens and Independents. Since the 2023 election the council has again been run by a coalition of the Liberal Democrats, Greens and some of the independent councillors. Paul Arnott was re-appointed leader of the council after the election, this time as a Liberal Democrat, having previously led as a member of the East Devon Alliance, which did not stand any candidates in 2023.

The first election to the council was held in 1973, initially operating as a shadow authority before coming into its powers on 1 April 1974. Political control of the council since 1974 has been held by the following parties:
===Leadership===
The leaders of the council since 2001 have been:

===Composition===
Following the 2023 election, subsequent changes of allegiance up to June 2024 and a by-election in May 2024, the composition of the council was:

The Liberal Democrats, Greens and eleven of the independent councillors sit together as the &quot;Democratic Alliance Group&quot;, which forms the council&#x27;s administration. Of the other independent councillors, ten form the &quot;Independent Group&quot;, one sits with the single Liberal councillor as the &quot;Independent Councillor Group&quot; and the other does not belong to a group. The next election is due in 2027.

===Elections===

Since the last boundary changes in 2019 the council has comprised 60 councillors representing 30 wards, with each ward electing one, two or three councillors. Elections are held every four years.

East Devon is covered by two parliamentary constituencies: Exmouth and Exeter East and Honiton and Sidmouth.

===Premises===

In 2019 the council moved to new purpose-built offices called Blackdown House in Honiton. The building was officially opened on 27 February 2019. Prior to 2019 the council was based at Knowle, a large converted house in Sidmouth which had been the offices of the old Sidmouth Urban District Council since the 1960s, having previously been a hotel.

==Transport==
Exeter International Airport is located in East Devon. A small stretch of the M5 motorway passes through the district, as does a section of the West of England line.

==Towns and parishes==

East Devon is entirely divided into civil parishes. The parish councils for Axminster, Budleigh Salterton, Cranbrook, Exmouth, Honiton, Ottery St Mary, Seaton and Sidmouth take the style &quot;town council&quot;.

<text>Mid Devon is a local government district in Devon, England. The council is based in the district&#x27;s largest town of Tiverton. The district also contains the towns of Bampton, Bradninch, Crediton and Cullompton, along with numerous villages and surrounding rural areas. Part of the district lies within the Blackdown Hills, an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty.

The neighbouring districts are East Devon, Teignbridge, West Devon, Torridge, North Devon and Somerset.

==History==
The district was formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, covering the area of four former districts which were all abolished at the same time:
*Crediton Rural District
*Crediton Urban District
*Tiverton Municipal Borough
*Tiverton Rural District
The new district was initially named Tiverton, after its largest town. The district was renamed Mid Devon with effect from 6 February 1978 by resolution of the district council.

==Geography==
Mid Devon shares borders with several other Devon districts as well as the county of Somerset. Neighbouring districts include Exeter, East Devon, North Devon, Teignbridge, West Devon and Torridge. The area of Mid Devon, according to the Office for National Statistics Census table KS101EW is 91293.48 hectares, or 912.9348 sq kilometres, or 352.5 square miles.

===Rivers===
The Exe, the Culm, the Yeo, the Dalch, the Little Dart, the Taw, the Dart, the Brockley, the Creedy and the Spratford Stream flow through the district.

===Raddon Top===
Raddon Top (772 ft.) is the highest point of the Raddon Hills. Excavations at the summit in 1994 uncovered traces of Early Iron Age settlement.

==Governance==
Mid Devon District Council provides district-level services. County-level services are provided by Devon County Council. The whole district is also covered by civil parishes, which form a third tier of local government.

===Political control===
The council has been under Liberal Democrat majority control since the 2023 election.

The first election to the council was held in 1973, initially operating as a shadow authority alongside the outgoing authorities until the new arrangements came into effect on 1 April 1974. Political control of the council since 1974 has been as follows:
===Leadership===
The leaders of the council since 2008 have been:

===Composition===
Following the 2023 election and subsequent by-elections and changes of allegiance up to July 2024, the composition of the council was:
The next election is due in 2027.

===Elections===

Since the last boundary changes in 2023 the council has comprised 42 councillors, representing 22 wards, with each ward electing one, two or three councillors. Elections are held every four years.

===Premises===
Since January 2004 the council has been based at a modern office building called Phoenix House on Phoenix Lane in Tiverton.

==Tourism==
===Grand Western Canal===
The Grand Western Canal stretches from Canal Hill in Tiverton to just before the county boundary, near to Greenham, Somerset. It no longer operates for trade purposes, but is a popular tourist location. Visitors are able to walk along its banks or take a trip down the canal in a horse drawn barge. A static barge at the Canal Hill end of the canal offers refreshments. The site is one of two tourism spots owned by Devon County Council.

===Devon Railway Centre===
The Devon Railway Centre is located at Bickleigh in Mid Devon, in a restored Victorian railway station on the closed Great Western Railway branch from Exeter to Dulverton. The centre operates a 2 ft (610mm) gauge passenger railway and has a large collection of narrow gauge rolling stock, a miniature railway and a collection of model railways.

===Coldharbour Working Wool Museum===
Coldharbour Mill is a Grade II* listed Georgian mill complex in Uffculme, close to junction 27 (Tiverton turnoff) of the M5. The mill has the largest working waterwheel in the south west, and steams up its stationary steam engines most Bank Holidays. It has a number of other collections, such as dolls&#x27; houses, a large tapestry showing five local parishes, and a wide range of worsted wool spinning and weaving machines.

==Towns and parishes==

Mid Devon is entirely divided into civil parishes. Some of the smaller parishes have a parish meeting rather than a parish council, whilst the three parishes of Clayhanger, Hockworthy and Huntsham share a grouped parish council called Borden Gate Parish Council. The parish councils for Bampton, Bradninch, Crediton, Cullompton and Tiverton take the style &quot;town council&quot;.

<text>North Devon is a local government district in Devon, England. Its council is based just outside Barnstaple, the district&#x27;s largest town. The district also includes the towns of Ilfracombe, Lynton and Lynmouth and South Molton along with numerous villages, seaside resorts and surrounding rural areas.

The east of the district includes part of the Exmoor National Park, and the district&#x27;s coast is also recognised for its natural beauty, forming part of the North Devon Coast, an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty.

The district borders Torridge to the south-west, Mid Devon to the south-east, and the neighbouring county of Somerset to the east.

The term &quot;North Devon&quot; can also be used to describe a wider geographic area than the local government district, often including neighbouring Torridge District, based in Bideford.

==History==
The district was formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972. The new district covered the area of five former districts, which were all abolished at the same time:
*Barnstaple Municipal Borough
*Barnstaple Rural District
*Ilfracombe Urban District
*Lynton Urban District
*South Molton Rural District
The new district was named North Devon, reflecting its position within the wider county. Since 2009 the council has styled itself &quot;North Devon Council&quot; rather than its full formal name of &quot;North Devon District Council&quot;.

==Governance==
North Devon Council provides district-level services, including the administration of council tax and local benefits, the provision of car parking services, the collection of refuse and the recycling of waste, planning and building control, housing services, the provision of sport and leisure facilities, environmental services, business-related services and contingency planning. The council also runs and maintains the North Devon Crematorium. County-level services are provided by Devon County Council. The whole district is also covered by civil parishes, which form a third tier of local government.

In the parts of the district within the Exmoor National Park, town planning is the responsibility of the Exmoor National Park Authority. The district council appoints two of its councillors to serve on the 22-person National Park Authority.

===Political control===
The council has been under Liberal Democrat majority control since 2019.

The first election to the council was held in 1973, initially operating as a shadow authority before coming into its powers on 1 April 1974. Political control of the council since 1974 has been as follows:
===Leadership===
The leaders of the council since 1991 have been:

===Composition===
Following the 2023 election, the composition of the council was:

The independent councillors and Greens sit together as the &quot;North Devon Independent Group&quot;. The next elections are due in 2027.

===Premises===
The council&#x27;s main offices are at the Brynsworthy Environment Centre near Barnstaple (the building is in the parish of Fremington). The council moved there in 2015, having previously been based at the Civic Centre on North Walk in Barnstaple, which had been built in 1969 as joint offices for two of North Devon&#x27;s predecessor councils, Barnstaple Town Council and Barnstaple Rural District Council. The council&#x27;s main customer service centre is located at Lynton House, Commercial Road, Barnstaple, and it also maintains area offices in Ilfracombe and South Molton.

==Elections==

Since the last boundary changes in 2019, the council has comprised 42 councillors representing 25 wards, with each ward returning between one and three councillors. Some wards are coterminous with civil parishes, though most consist of multiple parishes or parts of parishes. Elections are held every four years. The following table lists the electoral wards of North Devon and the associated civil parishes.

==Towns and parishes==
The whole district is covered by civil parishes. The parish councils for Barnstaple, Ilfracombe, Lynton and Lynmouth, and South Molton are styled &quot;town councils&quot;. Some of the smaller parishes have a parish meeting rather than a parish council.

==Demography==
North Devon is popular with retired people. The 2011 census showed that 18% of residents were aged 15 years and under, 60% were aged 16–64 and 23% were aged 65 and over. This compares to the 20% of the population who were aged 65 and over when the 2001 census was taken. For comparison, the same age distributions across England were 19%, 64% and 17% respectively. Life expectancy for men, at 77.7, is close to the English average. Female life expectancy is good at 83.1, around 1 year above the English average. 

There is a gap of six years in the life expectancy of men in the least deprived fifth of wards and the most deprived fifth. The region has one of the most ethnically homogenous populations in England, with 97.9% reporting their ethnicity as &#x27;white&#x27; in the 2011 census of the population. However, this is a decrease on the 99.0% of the population who declared themselves to be white on the 2001 census.

==Transport==
Along with its neighbours to the east, West Somerset, and west, Torridge, North Devon has fairly sparse transport links. The Beeching cuts in the mid-sixties left the branch line to Exeter as the area&#x27;s only railway service. Despite being served by only one railway line, the district is served by 5 railway stations, which is a large number, comparable with more urbanised boroughs such as Plymouth and Mid Devon. However sizeable settlements of Braunton and Ilfracombe as well as Bideford are cut off from the Network Rail system.

The district is served by three &quot;A&quot; roads. The primary link is the A361 (known locally as the &quot;Link Road&quot;) which was constructed between 1986 and 1989. It heads north-west from the M5 motorway, past South Molton, to Barnstaple. From here the A361 classification continues northwards along older roads to Ilfracombe, and the modern &quot;Link Road&quot; continues westwards from Barnstaple as the A39 where it is designated the &quot;Atlantic Highway&quot;, and runs via Bideford into Cornwall. The eastern section of the A39 links Barnstaple to Lynton, then crosses the northern coastal hills of Exmoor into Somerset.

The other two &quot;A&quot; roads in North Devon are the A399, a minor local route between Ilfracombe and South Molton (used as a &quot;de facto&quot; Barnstaple-bypass to Ilfracombe and Woolacombe), and the A377, which is the main road between Barnstaple and the county town of Devon, Exeter.

Due to significant peak time traffic delays in Barnstaple, and severe congestion at both peak and non-peak times in the summer when tourist traffic is at its busiest, the Barnstaple Western Bypass was opened in 2007.

==Economy==
North Devon is some distance from the UK&#x27;s traditional areas of industrial activity and population yet boasts some major manufacturing sites that export around the world, among them TDK Lambda and Pall Europe in Ilfracombe, Eaton Aerospace and Norbord in South Molton, Perrigo in Braunton and multiple businesses in Barnstaple. Due to the historically agricultural nature of the economy alongside a strong tourism industry employment can be seasonal. As a result, some areas of North Devon are considered deprived. The overall average income for the district is 80% of the average for the United Kingdom as a whole. 

The 1989 opening of the new Link Road connection to the motorway network helped to promote trade, but it had a temporary detrimental effect on a number of distribution businesses. The latter had previously viewed the town as a base for local distribution networks, a need that was removed with an approximate halving of travelling time to the M5 motorway. The region adapted: in 2005 unemployment in North Devon was 1.8–2.4% but in 2018 unemployment in North Devon had come down significantly since its 2010 high to 1.1%. Median weekly full-time pay is £440 per week, the average house price is £230,000 and the number of businesses registered has increased to 4895, up 370 from 2010. 2018 has seen significant Government investment in the area through Coastal Community grants and Housing Infrastructure funds, as well as £83 million to further upgrade the North Devon Link Road.

Barnstaple is the main shopping area for North Devon. There are many chain stores in the town centre and in the Roundswell Business Park, on the western fringe of the town. The multimillion-pound redevelopment of the former Leaderflush Shapland works at Anchorwood Bank, and the surrounding area, is creating a conservation area near the River Taw, hundreds of new homes, a commercial retail area with new shops, restaurants and leisure facilities. 

The largest employer in the region is local and central Government. The two main government employers in the area are the Royal Marines Base Chivenor, west of the town, and North Devon District Hospital, to the north.

==Barnstaple==
Barnstaple is on the River Taw estuary, and functions as the main service centre for North Devon. The parish of Barnstaple had a population of 97,214 at the 2011 census. The wider Barnstaple Built-Up Area was estimated to have a population of 32,411 in 2018, whilst the Barnstaple Town Area, which contains satellite settlements such as Bishop&#x27;s Tawton, Fremington and Landkey, has a population of 46,619 (as of 2020).

<text>Baron Hastings is a title that has been created three times. The first creation was in the Peerage of England in 1290, and is extant. The second creation was in the Peerage of England in 1299, and became extinct on the death of the first holder in c. 1314. The third creation was in the Peerage of England in 1461, and has been in abeyance since 1960.

==1290 creation==
John Hastings was summoned to Parliament as Lord Hastings in 1290. He was the son of Henry de Hastings, who had been created &quot;Baron Hastings&quot; by Simon de Montfort in 1263. Since the first Baron&#x27;s title does not appear to have been recognised by the King, although his son John Hastings is sometimes referred to as the second Baron Hastings, the majority of historians enumerate John as 1st Baron Hastings. John Hastings&#x27;s grandson, the third Baron Hastings, was created Laurence Hastings, 1st Earl of Pembroke in 1339. The latter&#x27;s son, the second Earl of Pembroke, married as his second wife Anne Hastings, 2nd Baroness Manny. Their son, the third Earl and fifth Baron Hastings, succeeded his mother as third Baron Manny.

On his death in 1389 the earldom and barony of Manny became extinct, while the barony of Hastings became dormant. It then became the subject of a bitter-fought lawsuit, nominally over the right to the Hastings arms but including the right to the family honours. The barony was claimed by Hugh Hastings (1377–1396) (later deemed the &quot;de jure&quot; 7th Baron Hastings; see below). He was the eldest son of Sir Hugh Hastings, grandson of Sir Hugh Hastings (c. 1307–1347), son of the second Baron by his second wife. Hugh claimed the title as &quot;heir of the half blood&quot;. However, the claim was contested by Reginald Grey, 3rd Baron Grey de Ruthyn, as &quot;heir of the whole blood&quot;. Lord Grey de Ruthyn claimed the Barony in right of his grandmother Elizabeth, daughter of the second Baron Hastings by his first wife. On the early death of Hugh Hastings in 1396 the claim passed to his younger brother Edward Hastings (1382–1438) (later deemed the &quot;de jure&quot; 8th Baron Hastings; see below). In 1410 a court decided in favour of Grey. Hastings immediately appealed, and at the coronation of Henry V in 1413, he claimed the right to carry the spurs before the King, which Lord Grey de Ruthyn had done undisputed in 1399 at the coronation of Henry IV. Hastings was later ordered to pay the costs of the trial. When he refused, he was imprisoned in 1417. He remained imprisoned until 1433, but refused to buy his release by abandoning his claims. No final decision regarding the Barony was made at the time, but both families continued to claim the title. The Greys finally abandoned their claim in 1639.
After the title had been dormant for 452 years, in 1841 the House of Lords decided that the rightful successor to the third Earl of Pembroke and fifth Baron Hastings was his kinsman John Hastings, &quot;de jure&quot; 6th Baron Hastings. He was the eldest son of Sir Hugh Hastings, younger son of the first Baron. His successor should have been his great-nephew, the aforementioned Hugh Hastings, &quot;de jure&quot; 7th Baron Hastings. The next holder should have been his younger brother, the aforementioned Edward Hastings, &quot;de jure&quot; 8th Baron Hastings. On the death of the latter&#x27;s great-great-great-grandson, the &quot;de jure&quot; 15th Baron, the peerage technically fell into abeyance between the Baron&#x27;s sisters Anne and Elizabeth. The House of Lords decision meant that there were three co-heirs to the barony. The decision was in favour of Sir Jacob Astley, 6th Baronet, who was summoned to the House of Lords the same year as Lord Hastings. He was a descendant of the aforementioned Elizabeth, sister of the &quot;de jure&quot; 15th Baron. Lord Hastings had previously represented West Norfolk in the House of Commons.

 the titles are held by his great-great-great-grandson, the twenty-third Baron and thirteenth Baronet, who succeeded his father in 2007. The twenty-second Baron served in the Conservative administrations of Harold Macmillan and Sir Alec Douglas-Home as a government whip from 1961 to 1962 and as Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Housing and Local Government from 1962 to 1964.

The Astley Baronetcy, of Hillmorton in the County of Warwick, had been created in the Baronetage of England on 25 June 1660 for Jacob Astley. He represented Norfolk in House of Commons for many years. His great-grandson, Edward Astley, also represented Norfolk in Parliament. He married Rhoda Delaval, daughter of Francis Blake Delaval, of Seaton Delaval Hall in Northumberland, and sister of John Delaval, 1st Baron Delaval. Through this marriage the Seaton Delaval estate came into the Astley family when Rhoda&#x27;s brother did not produce a male heir. Their son, Sir Jacob Henry Astley, was also Member of Parliament for Norfolk. The latter was the father of the sixth Baronet, who succeeded as Baron Hastings in 1841.

The family seat was Seaton Delaval Hall, now in the possession of the National Trust.

==1299 creation==

Edmund Hastings of Inchmahome (anciently &quot;Inchmacholmok&quot;) in Perthshire, Scotland, was the younger son of Henry de Hastings (c. 1235–c. 1268) of Ashill, Norfolk, (who was summoned to Parliament by Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester as Lord Hastings in 1263, but the title was not recognized by King Henry III). He was thus the younger brother of John Hastings, 1st Baron Hastings (title created 1290). On 29 December 1299 Edmund Hastings was summoned to Parliament as Lord Hastings. The title became extinct on his death without issue at the Battle of Bannockburn in 1314. His wife (given to him in marriage by King Edward I) was Isabel, &quot;suo jure&quot; Countess of Menteith, a Scottish title, and on his seal appended to the Barons&#x27; Letter of 1301 he displayed the arms of the early Earls of Menteith: &quot;Barry wavy of six or and gules&quot;.

==1461 creation==

Sir William Hastings (c. 1430–1483) served as Lord Chamberlain and as Ambassador to France. He was summoned to Parliament as Lord Hastings on 26 July 1461. He was a great friend and confidant of King Edward IV and one of the wealthiest and most powerful men of his time. Lord Hastings was summarily beheaded on Tower Hill in 1483 following an accusation of treason by Richard of Gloucester during the events that led to the latter&#x27;s coronation. However, as he was not attainted for treason the title was passed to his son, Edward, the second Baron, who married Mary, granddaughter of Robert Hungerford, 3rd Baron Hungerford, who had been attainted in 1461. Mary managed to obtain a reversal of the attainders of the Barony of Hungerford, Barony of Botreaux and Barony of De Moleyns. Their son, George, inherited the Barony of Hastings from his father and the Baronies of Hungerford, Botreaux and De Moleyns from his mother; in 1513, he was created Earl of Huntingdon.

Cokayne in &quot;The Complete Peerage&quot; distinguishes two baronies by writ — Baron Hastings de Hastings and Baron Hastings de Hungerford — based on the respective titles used in the writs of summons for the 1st and 2nd barons to the 1461 and 1482 Parliaments. In this scheme, the &quot;n&quot;th Baron Hastings is actually &quot;n&quot;th Baron Hastings de Hastings and &quot;(n–1)&quot;th Baron Hastings de Hungerford. 

On the death of the tenth Earl in 1789 the earldom became dormant, while the baronies of Hastings, Hungerford, Botreaux and De Moleyns passed on to his sister Elizabeth, the wife of John Rawdon, 1st Earl of Moira. Their son, the second Earl of Moira, inherited the four baronies on his mother&#x27;s death in 1808. In 1816 he was created Marquess of Hastings. Lord Hastings married Flora Mure-Campbell, 6th Countess of Loudoun. Their son, the second Marquess, also inherited the Earldom of Loudoun from his mother. He married Barbara, 20th Baroness Grey de Ruthyn. On the death in 1868 of their younger son, the fourth Marquess (who had also succeeded his mother as Baron Grey de Ruthyn), the marquessate became extinct, the Scottish earldom of Loudoun passed on to his eldest sister, while the Baronies of Hastings, Hungerford, Botreaux, De Moleyns and Grey de Ruthyn fell into abeyance between the sisters.

In 1871 the Baronies of Botreaux, Hungerford, Moleyns and Hastings were called out of abeyance in favour of Edith, Countess of Loudoun (but not the Barony of Grey de Ruthyn, which was called out of abeyance in 1885 in favour of a different heir). Cokayne regards the 1871 change as applying to Baron Hastings de Hastings, leaving Baron Hastings de Hungerford still in abeyance. On the death of the Countess of Loudoun&#x27;s son, the 11th Earl, in 1920, the earldom passed to his eldest niece, Elizabeth, while the four Baronies fell into abeyance between Elizabeth and her younger sisters.

In 1921 the Baronies of Hastings and Botreaux were called out of abeyance in favour of Elizabeth (and the Barony of Stanley was called out of abeyance in her favour at the same time). However, the barony of De Moleyns and the barony of Hungerford were called out of abeyance in favour of a different heir (see the Viscount St Davids). On Elizabeth&#x27;s death in 1960 the baronies of Hastings, Stanley and Botreaux fell into abeyance between her daughters. As of 2021, they remain in abeyance.

<doc id="449019" wikidata="Q3251260" url="?curid=449019" title="Oberon-2">
<text>Oberon-2 is an extension of the original Oberon programming language that adds limited reflective programming (reflection) and object-oriented programming facilities, open arrays as pointer base types, read-only field export, and reintroduces the codice_1 loop from Modula-2.

It was developed in 1991 at ETH Zurich by Niklaus Wirth and Hanspeter Mössenböck, who is now at Institut für Systemsoftware (SSW) of the University of Linz, Austria. Oberon-2 is a superset of Oberon, is fully compatible with it, and was a redesign of Object Oberon.

Oberon-2 inherited limited reflection and single inheritance (&quot;type extension&quot;) without the interfaces or mixins from Oberon, but added efficient virtual methods (&quot;type bound procedures&quot;). Method calls were resolved at runtime using C++-style virtual method tables.

Compared to fully object-oriented languages like Smalltalk, in Oberon-2, basic data types and classes are not objects, many operations are not methods, there is no message passing (it can be emulated somewhat by reflection and through message extension, as demonstrated in ETH Oberon), and polymorphism is limited to subclasses of a common class (no duck typing as in Python, and it&#x27;s not possible to define interfaces as in Java). Oberon-2 does not support encapsulation at object or class level, but modules can be used for this purpose.

Reflection in Oberon-2 does not use metaobjects, but simply reads from type descriptors compiled into the executable binaries, and exposed in the modules that define the types and/or procedures. If the format of these structures are exposed at the language level (as is the case for ETH Oberon, for example), reflection could be implemented at the library level. It could thus be implemented almost entirely at library level, without changing the language code. Indeed, ETH Oberon makes use of language-level and library-level reflection abilities extensively.

Oberon-2 provides built-in runtime support for garbage collection similar to Java and performs bounds and array index checks, etc., that eliminate the potential stack and array bounds overwriting problems and manual memory management issues inherent in C and C++. Separate compiling using symbol files and namespaces via the module architecture ensure fast rebuilds since only modules with changed interfaces need to be recompiled.

The language Component Pascal is a refinement (a superset) of Oberon-2.

== Example code ==
The following Oberon-2 code implements a simple binary tree:
MODULE Trees;

TYPE
 Tree* = POINTER TO Node;
 Node* = RECORD
 name-: POINTER TO ARRAY OF CHAR;
 left, right: Tree
 END;

PROCEDURE (t: Tree) Insert* (name: ARRAY OF CHAR);
 VAR p, father: Tree;
BEGIN p := t;
 REPEAT father := p;
 IF name = p.name^ THEN RETURN END;
 IF name &lt; p.name^ THEN p := p.left ELSE p := p.right END
 UNTIL p = NIL;
 NEW(p); p.left := NIL; p.right := NIL; NEW(p.name, LEN(name)+1); COPY(name, p.name^);
 IF name &lt; father.name^ THEN father.left := p ELSE father.right := p END
END Insert;

PROCEDURE (t: Tree) Search* (name: ARRAY OF CHAR): Tree;
 VAR p: Tree;
BEGIN p := t;
 WHILE (p # NIL) &amp; (name # p.name^) DO
 IF name &lt; p.name^ THEN p := p.left ELSE p := p.right END
 END;
 RETURN p
END Search;

PROCEDURE NewTree* (): Tree;
 VAR t: Tree;
BEGIN NEW(t); NEW(t.name, 1); t.name[0] := 0X; t.left := NIL; t.right := NIL; RETURN t
END NewTree;

END Trees.
== Oberon-2 extensions to Oberon ==

=== Type-bound procedures ===
Procedures can be bound to a record (or pointer) type. They are equivalent to instance methods in object-oriented terminology.

=== Read-only export ===
The use of exported variables and record fields can be restricted to read-only access. This is shown with a &quot;-&quot; visibility flag.

=== Open arrays ===
Open arrays which formerly could only be declared as formal parameter types may now be declared as pointer base types.

=== FOR statement ===
The codice_1 statement of Pascal and Modula-2 was not implemented in Oberon. It is reintroduced in Oberon-2.

=== Runtime type checking ===
Oberon-2 provides several mechanisms for checking the &quot;dynamic&quot; type of an object. For example, where a Bird object might be instantiated to either a Duck or a Cuckoo, Oberon-2 allows the programmer to respond to the actual type of the object at runtime.

The first, most conventional, approach is to rely on the &quot;type binding system&quot;. The second approach is to use the &quot;codice_3 statement&quot;, which allows the dynamic subtype of a variable to be checked directly. In both cases, once the subtype has been identified, the programmer can make use of any type-bound procedures or variables that are appropriate to the subtype. Examples of these approaches are shown below.

Note that the form of codice_3 statement used in Oberon-2 is unrelated to the Pascal and Modula-2 WITH statement. This method of abbreviating access to record fields is not implemented in Oberon or Oberon-2.

==== codice_7 operator ====
A third approach is possible using the codice_7 operator. This is a relation operator with the same precedence as equals (codice_9), greater (codice_10), etc. but which tests dynamic type. Unlike the two other approaches, however, it does not allow the programmer access to the subtype that has been detected.

== Syntax ==
The development of the ALGOL → Pascal → Modula-2 → Oberon → Component Pascal language family is marked by a &quot;reduction&quot; in the complexity of the language syntax. The entire Oberon-2 language is described (&quot;Mössenböck &amp; Wirth, March 1995&quot;) using only 33 grammatical productions in the extended Backus–Naur form, as shown below.

== Implementations ==
Oberon-2 compilers maintained by ETH include versions for Windows, Linux, Solaris, macOS.

The Oxford Oberon-2 compiler compiles to native machine code and can use a JIT on Windows, Linux, and macOS. It is created and maintained by Mike Spivey and uses the Keiko Virtual Machine.

There is an Oberon-2 Lex scanner and Yacc parser by Stephen J. Bevan of Manchester University, UK, based on the one in the Mössenböck and Wirth reference. It is at version 1.4.

There is a release named &quot;Native Oberon&quot; which includes an operating system, and can directly boot on PC class hardware.

A .NET implementation of Oberon with the addition of some minor .NET-related extensions has been developed at ETHZ.

Programmer&#x27;s Open Workbench (POW!) is a very simple integrated development environment, which is provided with editor, linker, and Oberon-2 compiler. This compiles to Windows executables. Full source code is provided; the compiler is written in Oberon-2.

The Java to Oberon Compiler (JOB) was written at the University of Vologda in Russia. It produces object code in the form of Java class files (bytecode). Some JOB-specific classes are provided which are Java compatible, but which use a more Oberon-like component hierarchy.

The Optimizing Oberon-2 Compiler compiles to C, using the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) toolchain for program generation.

Oberon Script is a compiler that translates the full Oberon language into JavaScript. The compiler is written in JavaScript and can thus be called from Web pages to process scripts written in Oberon.

XDS Modula2/Oberon2 is a development system by Excelsior LLC, Novosibirsk, Russia. It contains an optimizing compiler for Intel Pentium, or &quot;via-C&quot; translator for cross-platform software development. Available for Windows and Linux. The compiler is written in Oberon-2 and compiles itself.

Oberon Revival is a project to bring Oberon 2 and Component Pascal (BlackBox Component Builder) to Linux and Win32. The Linux port of BlackBox was unavailable before and it originally ran on only Microsoft Windows.

XOberon is a real-time operating system for PowerPC, written in Oberon-2.

The Portable Oberon-2 Compiler (OP2) was developed to port the Oberon System onto commercially available platforms.

== Keiko bytecode ==

Oberon-2 can target the Keiko Virtual machine.
For example, like some other language compilers (see O-code, p-code, etc.),
the Oxford Oberon-2 compiler first compiles to an intermediate bytecode (Keiko bytecode) which can be interpreted with a byte-code interpreter or use just-in-time compilation.

<text>The Maxim restaurant bombing was a Palestinian suicide bombing which occurred on October 4, 2003, in the beachfront restaurant Maxim in Haifa, Israel. Twenty-one civilians were killed and 60 were injured. Among the victims were two families and four children, including a two-month-old baby.

The restaurant, which is located at the seafront near the southern boundary of the city of Haifa, was frequently attended by both Arab and Jewish local populations, and was widely seen as a symbol of peaceful coexistence in Haifa.

The militant organization Islamic Jihad claimed responsibility for the attack. It was condemned by Palestinian President Yasser Arafat. The restaurant&#x27;s interior was destroyed by the blast, and was completely rebuilt seven months after the attack.

== Background ==
The Maxim restaurant is a beachfront restaurant located near the south entry to Haifa. It is co-owned by Jews and Christian Arabs, and is known for being a symbol of co-existence.

== The attack ==
On October 4, 2003, at 14:10 pm, the 28-year-old Palestinian suicide bomber Hanadi Jaradat detonated the explosive belt she was wearing inside the Arab-Jewish Maxim restaurant in Haifa. 21 Israelis (18 Jews and 3 Arabs) were killed, and 60 others were wounded.
The bomb included metal fragments packed around the explosive core, that sprayed around the restaurant, maximizing lethal effect. According to Haifa police sources, the aftermath was gruesome, with some of the dead still sitting upright at their tables, while others, including children and babies, were slammed against the walls. Due to the force of the explosion, all that remained of Jaradat was her head.

Among the victims were two families and four children, including a two-month-old baby. Three Maccabi Haifa officials were lightly injured in the bombing.

== The assailant ==

The suicide bomber, 28-year-old Hanadi Jaradat () from Jenin, was the sixth female suicide bomber of the Al-Aqsa Intifada and the second woman recruited by Islamic Jihad.

When she was 21, her fiancé had been killed by Israeli security forces. At the time of her suicide bombing, Jaradat was a law student due to qualify as a lawyer in a few weeks. According to a story in &quot;Ha&#x27;aretz&quot;, based on Arab media and interviews with Israeli and Arab sources, she agreed to the bombing after Israel Defense Forces undercover operatives in Jenin killed her cousin (Salah, 34), and her younger brother (Fadi, 25), both of whom were accused by Israeli forces of being Islamic Jihad operatives, with her cousin being considered to be a senior member of the Al-Quds Brigades group.

== Israeli response ==
The day following the suicide bombing, the Israeli Army demolished the home of Jaradat&#x27;s family, and the homes of two neighbors who were uninvolved in the bombing. In response to the attack, which Israel claimed was planned in the Damascus headquarters of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad, an alleged terrorist training camp in Ain es-Saheb, Syria, was bombed by four Israeli Air Force jets. One person was injured, and munitions were allegedly destroyed during the strike.

Jamal Mahadjne, an Israeli-Arab from Umm al-Fahm, was arrested within hours of the attack for driving Jaradat to her destination. Mahadjne had regularly taken fees for illegally driving Palestinians to Israel, taking advantage of his Israeli identity card to cross the border without difficulty. He confessed his actions to Shin Bet agents, and was indicted before the Haifa District Court for being an accessory to murder and for other crimes relating to his illegal activities on November 10.

On November 7, Israel Defense Forces troops arrested senior Islamic Jihad militant Amjad Abeidi, who planned the attack, along with a number of other suicide bombings, during an operation in Jenin. During the operation, Jenin was placed under curfew as soldiers searched homes. One Palestinian teenager was shot dead while climbing a tank, and three Palestinians were wounded. The complex in which Abeidi was hiding was located and searched, and a weapons cache was found. After a grenade was thrown into the cache, Abeidi was lightly wounded and surrendered. As the soldiers left Jenin with Abeidi, Palestinian militants opened fire at them, and the soldiers returned fire. One militant, a member of the Al-Aqsa Martyrs&#x27; Brigades, was killed. Abeidi was handed over to Shin Bet for interrogation.

In 2017 Oran Almog, one of the victims of the attack, addressed the United Nations Security Council to demand that the Palestinian Authority cease incentivizing terrorism by paying stipends to terrorists.

==Official reactions==
Israeli prime minister Ariel Sharon stated that Israel held Palestinian President Yasser Arafat responsible for the attack. Arafat condemned the bombing. U.S. President George W. Bush condemned the attack, calling it a &quot;murderous action&quot; and a &quot;despicable attack&quot;.

==Aftermath==

In response to his daughter&#x27;s actions, her father Taisir declined all condolences, instead saying that he was proud of what his daughter had done, and that &quot;I will accept only congratulations for what she did. This was a gift she gave me, the homeland and the Palestinian people.&quot;

In October 2012, the Arab Lawyers Union awarded their top award to Hanadi Jaradat, and sent a delegation to her family to present them with the award. Ayman Abu Eisheh, who is a member of the Palestine Committee at the Arab Lawyers Union, explained that the lawyers were proud of Jaradat, saying that suicide bombing was &quot;in defense of Palestine and the Arab nation.&quot;

Although the interior of the restaurant was destroyed in the attack, it was quickly rebuilt and reopened within several months. A monument was erected near the restaurant in memory of the victims killed in the attack.

Sami Jaradat, one of the perpetrators and one of the heads of The Islamic Jihad in Jenin, is planned to be released from prison as part of Israel-Hamas hostage release agreement.

<doc id="449021" wikidata="Q1752488" url="?curid=449021" title="Torridge District">
<text>Torridge is a local government district in north-west Devon, England. Its council is based in the town of Bideford. The district also includes the towns of Great Torrington, Holsworthy and Northam, along with numerous villages and surrounding rural areas. The island of Lundy forms part of the district. The district is named after the River Torridge.

The district&#x27;s coast is recognised for its natural beauty, forming part of the North Devon Coast, an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. The South West Coast Path runs through the area.

The neighbouring districts are North Devon, Mid Devon, West Devon and Cornwall.

==History==
The district was formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972. The new district covered the area of six former districts, which were all abolished at the same time, plus Lundy Island:
*Bideford Municipal Borough
*Bideford Rural District
*Great Torrington Municipal Borough
*Holsworthy Rural District
*Lundy Island
*Northam Urban District
*Torrington Rural District
The new district was named after the River Torridge which flows through the area.

==Governance==
Torridge District Council provides district-level services. County-level services are provided by Devon County Council. Most of the district is also covered by civil parishes, which form a third tier of local government.

===Political control===
The council has been under no overall control since the 2023 election.

The first election to the council was held in 1973, initially operating as a shadow authority alongside the outgoing authorities until the new arrangements took effect on 1 April 1974. Political control of the council since 1974 has been as follows:
===Leadership===
The leaders of the council since 2004 have been:

===Composition===
Following the 2023 election and a by-election in May 2024, the composition of the council was:

Of the sixteen independent councillors, thirteen form the &quot;Independent Group&quot; and the other three are non-aligned. The next election is due in 2027.

===Premises===

Council meetings are usually held at Bideford Town Hall, which had been built in 1851 for the old Bideford Corporation. The council&#x27;s main offices are at Riverbank House in Bideford, which had been built as the headquarters of the Western Counties Building Society, before being bought by Torridge District Council in 1988.

===Elections===

Since the last boundary changes in 2019, the council has comprised 36 councillors representing 16 wards, with each ward electing one, two or three councillors. Elections are held every four years.

==Towns and parishes==

Most of Torridge is covered by civil parishes. The exception is Lundy, which is an unparished area. Some of the smaller parishes have a parish meeting rather than a parish council. The parish councils for Bideford, Great Torrington, Holsworthy and Northam take the style &quot;town council&quot;.

==Torridge CVS==
Torridge CVS is a charitable organisation providing vulnerable people across the Torridge district with day-to-day living assistance. It provides advice, befriending schemes, support for carers, help to older people and help with charitable fund-raising, liaising with voluntary and community groups where necessary. It offers placements for individuals who want to get more involved in their local communities and relies on local volunteers, with over 2000 volunteers registered. It has been in operation since 1988 and is a member of NAVCA, the National Association for Voluntary and Community Action, being largely funded by Devon County Council and Torridge District Council.

<doc id="449022" wikidata="Q4862373" url="?curid=449022" title="Baron FitzWalter">
<text>Baron FitzWalter is an ancient title in the Peerage of England. It was created on 24 June 1295 for Robert FitzWalter. The title was created by writ, which means that it can descend through both male and female lines.

==History==
One of the oldest titles in the English Peerage, the barony of FitzWalter has a long history. The fourth baron was an Admiral of the Fleet. The fourth baron&#x27;s grandson, the sixth baron, died from dysentery at the siege of Harfleur. He was succeeded by his brother, the seventh baron, who was the last known male line descendant of Rollo of Normandy, and was succeeded by his daughter and only child, Elizabeth. She was the wife of John Radcliffe. Their son, the ninth baron, was attainted for treason in 1495 with his title forfeited. However, his son Robert Radcliffe obtained a reversal of the attainder by Act of Parliament in 1509 and later served as Lord Lieutenant of Lancashire. He was created by Viscount FitzWalter in 1525 and Earl of Sussex in 1529. His grandson, the third earl, was summoned to the House of Lords through a writ of acceleration in 1553 in his father&#x27;s junior title of Baron FitzWalter. Lord Sussex later served as Lord Deputy of Ireland. He was succeeded by his younger brother, the fourth earl. He had earlier represented Maldon, Hampshire and Portsmouth in the House of Commons and also served as Lord Lieutenant of Hampshire. When he died the titles passed to his only child, the fifth earl. He was Lord Lieutenant of Essex.

On his death in 1629, the barony of FitzWalter separated from the viscountcy and earldom. The latter titles were inherited by the late earl&#x27;s cousin and heir male, the sixth earl, who notably sat as a Member of Parliament for Petersfield, Bedford and Portsmouth. When he died in 1643 the viscountcy and earldom became extinct. The claim to the barony of FitzWalter was passed on to the fifth earl&#x27;s cousin and heir-general Henry Mildmay, &quot;de jure&quot; fifteenth baron. He was the son of Lady Frances, the only daughter of the second earl of Sussex by his second wife, Anne Calthorpe. He claimed the barony in 1641 and 1645 but was unsuccessful both times and was never summoned to the House of Lords. His grandson Henry Mildmay, &quot;de jure&quot; sixteenth baron, successfully claimed the title in 1660. However, his younger brother Benjamin Mildmay successfully petitioned for the peerage in 1667 and was summoned to the House of Lords as the seventeenth baron. In 1730 his younger son, the nineteenth baron, was created Viscount Harwich, in the County of Essex, and Earl FitzWalter, in the Peerage of Great Britain. Lord FitzWalter later served as President of the Board of Trade and was also Lord Lieutenant of Essex.

However, on his death in 1756, the viscountcy and earldom became extinct while the barony of FitzWalter fell into abeyance between the daughters of Mary, only sister of the sixteenth and seventeenth barons. The peerage remained in abeyance for 168 years, until it was called out of abeyance in 1924 (after a petition to the House of Lords) in favour of Henry Fitzwalter Plumptre, who became the twentieth baron. He was the son of John Bridges Plumptre and grandson of Eleanor, wife of Reverend Henry Western Plumptre and daughter of Sir Brook William Bridges, 4th Baronet, of Goodneston, a descendant of the aforementioned Mary, sister of the sixteenth and seventeenth barons. Sir Brook William Bridge&#x27;s eldest son Sir Brook William Bridges, 5th Baronet, of Goodneston, had unsuccessfully claimed the barony in 1842, but was instead created Baron FitzWalter, of Woodham Walter in the County of Essex, in 1868 (for more information on this creation, which became extinct in 1875, see Bridges baronets of Goodneston).

The twentieth baron died childless in 1932 when the peerage once again fell into abeyance. The abeyance was terminated in 1953 in favour of Fitzwalter Brook Plumptre, the twenty-first Baron. He was the son of George Beresford Plumptre, the younger brother of the twentieth baron. , the title is held by his son, the twenty-second Baron, who succeeded in 2004.

The family seat is Goodnestone Park. The house was built in 1704 by Sir Brook Bridges, 1st Baronet, of Goodneston. The house came into the Plumptre family through the marriage of the aforesaid Eleanor Bridges, daughter of Sir Brook William Bridges, 4th Baronet, of Goodneston, to Reverend Henry Western Plumptre, whose son John Bridges Plumptre inherited it upon the death of the last Bridges baronet of Goodneston in 1899.

The FitzWalters were of the same line as the de Clare. Presuming they were from an unbroken male line, the seventh baron was the last agnate of the House of Normandy. Through de Balliol they also have a connection to the old Saxon line in England.

<doc id="449029" wikidata="Q2081735" url="?curid=449029" title="Haddon Sundblom">
<text>Haddon Hubbard &quot;Sunny&quot; Sundblom (June 22, 1899 – March 10, 1976) was an American artist of Swedish and Finnish descent and best known for the images of Santa Claus he created for The Coca-Cola Company. Sundblom&#x27;s friend Lou Prentice was the original model for the illustrator&#x27;s Santa.

==Background==
Sundblom was born in Muskegon, Michigan, to a Swedish-speaking family. His father, Karl Wilhelm Sundblom, was of the Swedish-speaking population of Finland and came from the farm Norrgårds in the village of Sonnboda in Föglö, Åland Islands, then part of the Russian Grand Duchy of Finland now Finland, while his mother Karin Andersson was from Sweden. Sundblom studied at the American Academy of Art.

==Career==
Sundblom is best remembered for his advertising work, specifically the Santa Claus advertisement. It was he who depicted Santa Claus in a red suit when he painted for The Coca-Cola Company, starting in 1931. Sundblom&#x27;s Claus firmly established the larger-than-life, grandfatherly Claus as a key figure in American Christmas imagery. So popular were Sundblom&#x27;s images of Claus (Sundblom&#x27;s images are used by Coca-Cola to this day) that Sundblom is often wrongly credited as having &quot;created&quot; the modern image of Santa Claus.

According to the Coca-Cola company: &quot;For inspiration, Sundblom turned to Clement Clarke Moore&#x27;s 1823 poem &quot;A Visit From St. Nicholas&quot; (commonly called &quot;&#x27;Twas the Night Before Christmas&quot;). Moore&#x27;s description of St. Nick led to an image of Santa that was warm, friendly, pleasantly plump and human. For the next 33 years, Sundblom painted portraits of Santa that helped to create the modern image of Santa – an interpretation that today lives on in the minds of people of all ages, all over the world&quot;. Sundblom&#x27;s family most likely also got Christmas greetings sent from Sweden and Finland, Åland. The cards in Sweden and Swedish-speaking Finland had motifs painted by Jenny Nyström of a friendly and charming &quot;jultomte&quot; (Santa) dressed in red and white.

In 1942 Sundblom created Coke&#x27;s mascot Sprite Boy, who appeared in print ads during the 1940s and 1950s.

Also in 1942 he was the artist for an iconic WWII United States Marine Corps recruitment poster. In it, a Marine Sergeant stands at parade rest with a headline that reads, &quot;Ready - Join U.S. Marines Land Sea Air&quot; and the copy continues at the bottom with, &quot;Apply, or write, to nearest recruiting station.&quot;

Quaker Oats asked Sundblom to update their logo in 1957. He provided the colorful head-and-shoulders version which was on their packaging until 1969, when it was made over in blue and white by Saul Bass.

Sundblom is recognized as a major influence on many well known pin-up artists, such as Harold W. McCauley, Gil Elvgren, Andrew Loomis, Edward Runci, Joyce Ballantyne, Art Frahm, and Harry Ekman. In the mid-1930s, he began to paint pin-ups and glamour pieces for calendars. Sundblom&#x27;s last assignment, in 1972, was a cover painting for Playboy&#x27;s Christmas issue which included a short bio with his photo.

Sundblom died at Edgewater Hospital in Chicago in 1976.

<doc id="449031" wikidata="Q3822475" url="?curid=449031" title="Aviion">
<text>Aviion (styled AViiON) was a series of computers from Data General that were the company&#x27;s main product from the late 1980s until the company&#x27;s server products were discontinued in 2001. Earlier Aviion models used the Motorola 88000 CPU, but later models moved to an all-Intel solution when Motorola stopped work on the 88000 in the early 1990s. Some versions of these later Intel-based machines ran Windows NT, while higher-end machines ran the company&#x27;s flavor of Unix, DG/UX.

==History==
Data General had, for most of its history, essentially mirrored the strategy of DEC with a competitive (but, in the spirit of the time, incompatible) minicomputer with a better price/performance ratio. However, by the 1980s, Data General was clearly in a downward spiral relative to DEC. With the performance of custom-designed minicomputer CPU&#x27;s dropping relative to commodity microprocessors, the cost of developing a custom solution no longer paid for itself. A better solution was to use these same commodity processors, but put them together in such a way to offer better performance than a commodity machine could offer.

With Aviion, DG shifted its sight from a purely proprietary minicomputer line to the burgeoning Unix server market. The new line was based around the Motorola 88000, a high performance RISC processor with some support for multiprocessing and a particularly clean architecture. The machines ran a System V Unix variant known as DG/UX, largely developed at the company&#x27;s Research Triangle Park facility. DG/UX had previously run on the company&#x27;s family of Eclipse MV 32-bit minicomputers (the successors to Nova and the 16-bit Eclipse minis) but only in a very secondary role to the Eclipse MV mainstay AOS/VS and AOS/VS II operating systems. Also, some Aviion servers from this era ran the proprietary Meditech MAGIC operating system.

From February 1988 to October 1990, Robert E. Cousins was the Department Manager for workstation development. During this time they produced the Maverick project and several follow-ons including the 300, 310 and 400 series workstations along with the 4000 series servers.

Aviion were released in a variety of sizes beginning in the summer of 1989. They debuted as a pizza box workstation (codenamed &quot;Maverick&quot;) and a server in both roller-mounted and rackmount flavors (&quot;Topgun&quot;). Speed-bumped and scaled-up versions followed, culminating in, first, the 16-CPU AV/9500 server and then the up to 32-way AV 10000 server in 1995, DG&#x27;s first implementation of a Non-Uniform Memory Access (NUMA) design. Workstations remained part of the line for a time, but the emphasis increasingly shifted towards servers.

In 1992, Motorola joined the AIM alliance to develop &quot;cut down&quot; versions of the IBM POWER CPU design into a single-chip CPU for desktop machines, and eventually stopped further development of the 88000. Because of this, DG gave up working with Motorola, and decided instead to align its efforts with what was soon to become the clear winner in volume microprocessors, and used i386 architecture CPUs from Intel instead.

This resulted in a second series of Aviion machines based first on the Pentium, and later on faster Pentium Pro, Pentium II and Pentium III Xeon CPUs. This more commoditized hardware approach also led DG to develop NUMA servers that added a memory-coherent interconnect (Scalable Coherent Interconnect (SCI)) to &quot;standard high-volume&quot; x86 motherboards sourced from Intel. Sequent Computer Systems, now part of IBM, was following a similar strategy at the time. A system codenamed &quot;Manx&quot; was an earlier NUMA effort based on the original Pentium and Zenith hardware, but it was never brought to market. The AV 20000 (&quot;Audubon&quot;) connected to 32 Pentium Pro processors (on up to eight quad-processor building blocks) in this manner; the later AV 25000 (&quot;Audubon 2&quot;) upgrade expanded this to 64 Pentium II (later Pentium III) Xeons.

Based on the burgeoning popularity of Windows NT, Intel-based Aviion servers also added Windows to their OS roster across the Aviion x86 line. It ended up contributing a significant percentage of revenues at the low-end, especially among existing DG customers who had made a decision to switch to NT. However, at the high-end, although Windows NT could run efficiently on single-block (i.e. quad-processor) building blocks in NUMA servers, it did not at the time have the processor and memory affinity optimizations that are required to achieve high performance on larger systems. As a result, Windows on DG NUMA servers was always more of a marketing story than a technical reality.

Around the same time, DG was also aggressively working towards an &quot;industry standard&quot; Unix operating system with the Santa Cruz Operation and others. However, first with SCO&#x27;s Data Center Acceleration Program (DCAP), and then Project Monterey, this never came to pass. Ultimately, DG&#x27;s NUMA servers ended up as just another large-scale proprietary Unix server at a time when the industry was coalescing around the Unix platform variants of just a few large vendors — Compaq (later acquired by HP), HP, IBM, and Sun Microsystems.

In 1999, EMC purchased Data General for 1.2 billion dollars primarily to gain access to its CLARiiON line of disk array storage products and associated software. Under the terms of the &quot;pooling of interests merger,&quot; EMC maintained the server line for two years, but discontinued it as soon as the terms of the deal allowed, at which point Aviion disappeared.

==Notes==
The name &quot;AViiON&quot; has often been claimed to be an anagram of &quot;Nova II&quot;, the Nova being one of DG&#x27;s most successful products. An employee competition was held to choose a name for the new line, but none of the suggestions was found to be acceptable for trademarking purposes. Given that early codenames for Eclipse systems included The Bird and The Big Bird, a reference to flight seemed appropriate. &quot;Avion&quot; had been suggested, but lacked the ability to be trademarked. At that time, two European companies had created a naming trend using repeated vowels - Baan and BiiN. Avion was modified by repeating the &#x27;i&#x27; and making the rest of the word uppercase as AViiON. (&quot;Avion&quot; (or &quot;avión&quot;) is the word for &quot;aircraft&quot; in French and Spanish.)

The use of the &quot;ii&quot; was carried through to the CLARiiON and THiiN Line product lines.

<text>West Devon is a local government district with borough status in Devon, England. Its council is based in Tavistock, the borough&#x27;s largest town. The borough also includes the towns of Hatherleigh, North Tawton and Okehampton, along with numerous villages and surrounding rural areas.

A large area in the south-east of the borough lies within the Dartmoor National Park, and part of the south-west of the borough lies within the Tamar Valley Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty.

The neighbouring districts are Torridge, Mid Devon, Teignbridge, South Hams and Cornwall.

==History==
The district was formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, covering the area of three former districts which were all abolished at the same time:
*Okehampton Municipal Borough
*Okehampton Rural District
*Tavistock Rural District
The new district was named West Devon, reflecting its location within the wider county.

On 27 April 1982 the district was awarded borough status, allowing the chair of the council to take the title of mayor.

==Governance==
West Devon Borough Council provides district-level services. County-level services are provided by Devon County Council. The whole borough is also covered by civil parishes, which form a third tier of local government.

In the parts of the borough within the Dartmoor National Park, town planning is the responsibility of the Dartmoor National Park Authority. The borough council appoints two of its councillors to serve on the 19-person National Park Authority.

===Political control===
The council has been under no overall control since the 2023 election, being led by a coalition of the independent councillors, Greens, Liberal Democrats and Labour.

The first election to the council was held in 1973, initially operating as a shadow authority alongside the outgoing authorities until the new arrangements came into effect on 1 April 1974. Political control of the council since 1974 has been as follows:
===Leadership===
The role of mayor is largely ceremonial in West Devon. Political leadership is instead provided by the leader of the council. The leaders since 2012 have been:

===Composition===
Following the 2023 election and subsequent by-elections in June 2023 and May 2024, the composition of the council was:

The independent councillors, Greens, Liberal Democrats and Labour sit together as the &quot;West Devon Alliance&quot; group, which forms the council&#x27;s administration. The next election is due in 2027.

===Elections===

Since the last boundary changes in 2015, the council has comprised 31 councillors representing 18 wards, with each ward electing one, two or three councillors. Elections are held every four years.

In the EU referendum of 2016, the majority of voters in West Devon voted to leave the European Union (18,937 to 16,658, that is 53.2% to 46.8%). The turnout was 81.25%.

The borough straddles the constituencies of Central Devon and Torridge and West Devon.

===Premises===
The council is based at Kilworthy Park in Tavistock, being a modern office built on the site of the goods yard of the old Tavistock North railway station.

==Towns and parishes==

The whole borough is divided into civil parishes. The parishes councils for Hatherleigh, North Tawton, Okehampton and Tavistock take the style &quot;town council&quot;. The small parish of Kelly has a parish meeting rather than a parish council.

==Town Twinning==
West Devon has been twinned with Wesseling, Germany since 1983.

<text>Teignbridge is a local government district in Devon, England. Its council is based in the town of Newton Abbot. The district also includes the towns of Ashburton, Buckfastleigh, Dawlish, Kingsteignton and Teignmouth, along with numerous villages and surrounding rural areas. Teignbridge contains part of the south Devon coastline, including the Dawlish Warren National Nature Reserve. Some of the inland western parts of the district lie within the Dartmoor National Park. It is named after the old Teignbridge hundred.

The neighbouring districts are Torbay, South Hams, West Devon, Mid Devon, East Devon and Exeter.

==History==
The district was formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, covering the whole area of six former districts and part of a seventh, which were all abolished at the same time:
*Ashburton Urban District
*Buckfastleigh Urban District
*Dawlish Urban District
*Newton Abbot Rural District
*Newton Abbot Urban District
*St Thomas Rural District (parts south-west of Exeter, rest went to East Devon)
*Teignmouth Urban District
The new district was named Teignbridge after the medieval hundred of that name which had covered some of the area. The hundred in turn had been named after the bridge over the River Teign on Exeter Road west of Kingsteignton, where there had been a number of bridges since Roman times.

==Governance==
Teignbridge District Council provides district-level services. County-level services are provided by Devon County Council. The whole district is also covered by civil parishes, which form a third tier of local government.

In the parts of the district within the Dartmoor National Park, town planning is the responsibility of the Dartmoor National Park Authority. The district council appoints two of its councillors to serve on the 19-person National Park Authority.

===Political control===
The council has been under Liberal Democrat majority control since the 2023 election.

The first election to the council was held in 1973, initially operating as a shadow authority alongside the outgoing authorities before coming into its powers on 1 April 1974. Political control of the council since 1974 has been as follows:

The next election is due in 2027.

===Elections===

Since the last boundary changes in 2019 the council has comprised 47 councillors representing 24 wards, with each ward electing one, two or three councillors. Elections are held every four years.

===Premises===

The council is based at Forde House on Brunel Road in Newton Abbot.

The council bought the Forde House estate in 1978 for £60,000. The estate comprised a Tudor mansion and its grounds. A modern office building was built in the grounds to serve as the council&#x27;s headquarters, being formally opened on 27 April 1987. The new office building now takes the name Forde House, with the old mansion now called Old Forde House.

==Parishes and settlements==
The district is entirely divided into civil parishes. Some of the smaller parishes have a parish meeting rather than a parish council. The parish councils for Ashburton, Buckfastleigh, Dawlish, Kingsteignton, Newton Abbot and Teignmouth take the style &quot;town council&quot;.

<text>Weymouth and Portland was a local government district with borough status in Dorset, England from 1974 to 2019. It consisted of the resort of Weymouth and the Isle of Portland, and includes the areas of Wyke Regis, Preston, Melcombe Regis, Upwey, Broadwey, Southill, Nottington, Westham, Radipole, Chiswell, Castletown, Fortuneswell, Weston, Southwell and Easton; the latter six being on the Isle of Portland.

In Portland Harbour is the Weymouth and Portland National Sailing Academy, where the sailing events at the 2012 Olympics took place. The main reason that the resort was chosen to be an Olympic venue was that the Sailing Academy had only recently been built, so no new venue would need to be provided. Weymouth and Portland&#x27;s waters have also been credited by the Royal Yachting Association as the best in Northern Europe.

Weymouth and Portland have been twinned with the town of Holzwickede in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany, since 1986, and the French town of Louviers, in the department of Eure in Normandy, since 1959.

== Politics ==

The district of Weymouth and Portland was formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, which merged the borough of Weymouth and Melcombe Regis and the Portland urban district. The district was divided into 15 wards for elections—12 of those in Weymouth, and three in Portland. Elections took place in a four-year cycle; one third of the councillors in all but three wards retire or seek re-election in years one, two and three, and county council elections were held in year four. In its final term the District Council was a multi-party administration under the leadership of the Conservatives.
For most of its existence, the council had its main offices at the Municipal Offices (later renamed the Council Offices) on North Quay, which had been completed in 1971 for the Weymouth and Melcombe Regis Borough Council, one of the council&#x27;s predecessors.

Weymouth and Portland and Purbeck districts were in the South Dorset parliamentary constituency, created in 1885. It was in the South West England constituency of the European Parliament.

The borough and its council was abolished on 1 April 2019 and, together with the other 4 districts outside the greater Bournemouth area, formed a new Dorset unitary authority. At the same time, a town council serving only Weymouth and its suburbs was formed, called Weymouth Town Council.

<text>West Dorset was a local government district in Dorset, England. The district was formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, and was a merger of the boroughs of Bridport, Dorchester and Lyme Regis, along with Sherborne urban district and the rural districts of Beaminster, Bridport, Dorchester and Sherborne. Its council was based in Dorchester. 

The district and its council were abolished on 1 April 2019 and, together with the other four districts outside the greater Bournemouth area, replaced by a new Dorset unitary authority.

==Demography==

At the 2001 census, West Dorset registered a population of 92,350. The population structure reflected the rural nature of the district. The area was a popular retirement area which also exported young people due to the lack of career options. This was reflected in the age structure, with 12.3% of the population over 75, compared to 7.5% in the whole of England; 51.7% were between 15 and 59, compared to 59.1% in England. 34.4% of dwellings were pensioner households, compared to 23.8% in England.

The district was an example of the low ethnic minority populations in rural areas, with 96.7% white British ethnicity, compared to 87.0% in England.

The district had a high level of car ownership, at 83.1% of households compared to 73.2% in England.

==Westminster constituencies==
Almost all of the West Dorset area fell within the West Dorset constituency; a small part was in South Dorset.

==Settlements==
The main settlements in West Dorset were Dorchester, Sherborne and Bridport. Dorchester, in the south of the district, is the county town of Dorset and has been an important settlement since Roman times. Sherborne, in the north, is an important market town which was, for a time, the capital of Wessex. Bridport, in the west, is popular with tourists visiting the Jurassic Coast, as is the smaller coastal town of Lyme Regis at the county border with Devon.

<text>East Dorset was a local government district in Dorset, England. Its council met in Wimborne Minster between 2016 and 2019.

The district (as Wimborne) was formed on 1 April 1974 by merging Wimborne Minster Urban District with Wimborne and Cranborne Rural District, plus the parish of St Leonards and St Ives transferred from the Ringwood and Fordingbridge Rural District in Hampshire. The district was renamed East Dorset with effect from 1 January 1988. The district was abolished in 2019 at the same time that Dorset County Council and the other districts in the county were abolished, with the area becoming part of the Dorset unitary authority on 1 April 2019.

The popularity of the area, being close to the New Forest, Bournemouth and the Dorset coast saw a rapid expansion in housing from the 1970s with the Verwood, Ferndown, West Moors and Corfe Mullen populations more than quadrupling. Rural landscape prevailed in the north and west of the area. Wimborne Minster retained its identity as a historic market town.

The most notable geography is lowland heath, managed by East Dorset Countryside Management Services in partnership with the Forestry Commission. The expansion of housing has led to a massive decrease in the area of this unusual and unique habitat, which once covered 500 km2 but now covers only 15% of that.

Statistics released by the Office for National Statistics show that life expectancy at birth for males in East Dorset was 80.1 years in 2001–2003, the highest in the United Kingdom. Female life expectancy at birth for the same period was 83.4 years, ranking seventh in the UK. The figures for East Dorset during 1991-1993 were 77.9 years for males and 82.5 for females.

==Governance==

East Dorset District Council was elected every four years, with latterly 36 councillors being elected at each election. After 1976 the Conservative party held a majority on the council apart from a period between the 1995 and 1999 elections when the Liberal Democrats had control. Following the 2015 election the council&#x27;s politicians were:-

The district and its council were abolished on 1 April 2019 and, together with the other 4 Dorset districts outside the greater Bournemouth area, formed a new Dorset unitary authority.

==Premises==

Woodleaze had previously served as the headquarters of Wimborne and Cranborne Rural District Council. In 2016 the council moved to Allenview House on Hanham Road in the town centre of Wimborne Minster.

<text>North Dorset was a local government district in Dorset, England, between 1974 and 2019. Its area was largely rural, but included the towns of Blandford Forum, Gillingham, Shaftesbury, Stalbridge and Sturminster Newton. Much of North Dorset was in the River Stour valley, known as the Blackmore Vale. The economy of North Dorset was largely based on dairy agriculture.

The district was formed on 1 April 1974, under the Local Government Act 1972, from the municipal boroughs of Blandford Forum, Shaftesbury, Blandford Rural District, Shaftesbury Rural District and Sturminster Rural District. The district and its council were abolished on 1 April 2019 and, together with the other four Dorset districts outside the greater Bournemouth area, incorporated into a Dorset unitary authority.

At the 2001 UK census North Dorset had a population of 61,905, a rise of 8,300 from 1991, with 25,248 households.

North Dorset is home to North Dorset Rugby Football Club.

== District Council ==
North Dorset District Council had its main offices at a large converted house called Nordon on Salisbury Road, Blandford Forum, which had previously been the offices of the Blandford Rural District Council, one of the council&#x27;s predecessors. Councillors were elected every four years; the final election before abolition was held in 2015.

<doc id="449050" wikidata="Q949312" url="?curid=449050" title="Purbeck District">
<text>Purbeck was a local government district in Dorset, England. The district was named after the Isle of Purbeck, a peninsula that forms a large proportion of the district&#x27;s area. However, it extended significantly further north and west than the traditional boundary of the Isle of Purbeck which is the River Frome. The district council was based in the town of Wareham, which is itself north of the Frome.

The district was formed under the Local Government Act 1972 on 1 April 1974, from the former municipal borough of Wareham, Swanage urban district and Wareham and Purbeck Rural District.
The district and its council were abolished on 1 April 2019, together with the other four districts outside the greater Bournemouth area, to form a new Dorset unitary authority.

Its name is recorded in 948 AD as Anglo-Saxon &quot;Purbicinga&quot;, meaning &quot;of the people of Purbic&quot;, where Purbic may be a former Celtic name, or may contain a supposed Anglo-Saxon word *&quot;pur&quot; or &quot;male lamb&quot;.

<doc id="449053" wikidata="Q1778302" url="?curid=449053" title="Teesdale (district)">
<text>Teesdale was, from 1974 to 2009, a local government district in County Durham, England. Its council was based in Barnard Castle and it was named after the valley of the River Tees.

That part of the district south of the River Tees is historically part of the North Riding of Yorkshire, and made up Startforth Rural District before the Local Government Act 1972 came into effect in 1974. The other predecessors to the district were Barnard Castle Urban District and Barnard Castle Rural District.

Much of the area had before 1894 constituted a single Teesdale rural sanitary district.

The district was the least-populous ordinary district in England (with a population of 24,457 in 2001), with only the City of London and the Isles of Scilly being smaller. It also had the third-lowest population density in England, after the former districts of Eden in Cumbria and Tynedale in Northumberland.

The district was abolished as part of the 2009 structural changes to local government in England.

== Electoral divisions ==

*&quot;Barnard Castle East&quot; Barnard Castle East ward; Barnard Castle North ward; Eggleston ward; Gainford and Winston ward; Ingleton ward; Staindrop ward; Streatlam and Whorlton ward
*&quot;Barnard Castle West&quot; Barnard Castle West ward; Barningham and Ovington ward; Cotherstone with Lartington ward; Greta ward; *Middleton-in-Teesdale ward; Romaldkirk ward; Startforth ward
*&quot;Evenwood&quot; Cockfield ward; Etherley ward; Evenwood, Ramshaw and Lands ward; Hamsterley and South Bedburn ward; Lynesack ward

==Energy policy==
In May 2006, a report commissioned by British Gas showed that housing in Teesdale produced the 2nd highest average carbon emissions in the country at 7,731 kg of carbon dioxide per dwelling.

==Crime==
In 2009, a league table of burglary &quot;hotspots&quot; in England and Wales was published. In it, it was revealed that Teesdale has some of the lowest burglaries than any other part of the country. In 2008, only 14 burglaries were committed, or 1.2 for every 1,000 homes.

<doc id="449056" wikidata="Q1200417" url="?curid=449056" title="Derwentside">
<text>Derwentside was, from 1974 to 2009, a local government district in County Durham, England.

The district took its name from the River Derwent, which made up part of the northern border of the district. Its main towns were Consett and Stanley, with the district council offices on Consett&#x27;s Medomsley Road. The rest of the district was semi-rural, with numerous former pit villages running into one another.

==Formation==
The district was formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, which reorganised local administration throughout England and Wales. The district was a merger of three abolished districts:
*Consett Urban District
*Stanley Urban District
*Lanchester Rural District

Derwentside was one of eight districts into which County Durham was divided in 1974. It was bounded on the east by Chester-le-Street District, to the south-east by the City of Durham and to the south and west by Wear Valley District. To the north the district was bounded by the Metropolitan County of Tyne and Wear and to the north west by Northumberland.

==Economy==
Derwentside&#x27;s economy was traditionally based on the steel industry and coal mining. With the loss of these industries, the district struggled with unemployment, although European Union funding provided a boost to local businesses and visitor attractions.

==Elections and political control==

The first election to Derwentside District Council took place on 7 June 1973, with the 55 councillors elected forming a shadow authority until 1 April 1974. Elections of the whole council were next held in 1976, and every four years thereafter. Throughout the council&#x27;s existence it was controlled by the Labour Party, initially with very large majorities. The main opposition group were the Derwentside Independents. At the final election prior to abolition, held in 2007, Labour&#x27;s majority was reduced to only three seats.

==Coat of arms==
Derwentside District Council were granted armorial bearings by the College of Arms in 1975. The letters patent were dated 8 May 1975, and the arms were blazoned as follows:

Barry wavy of eight Argent and Azure an Eagle displayed wings inverted Or gorged with a Mural Crown proper pendent therefrom by a ring a Cross of St. Cuthbert and charged on each wing with a like Cross Azure. 
Crest: On a wreath of the colours In front of Flames a Miner&#x27;s Pick head upwards in pale and two Swords points upwards in Saltire proper hilts and pomels Or pendent from the Pick by a Chain Argent a Roman Shield Sable charged with a Thunderbolt and on a Bordure Or ten Pellets.

Badge:A Fountain charged with an Eagle as in the Arms.

The shield had a field of silver and blue waves, representing the Rivers Derwent, Deerness and Browney. On top of this was placed a Roman eagle, for the Roman settlements at Ebchester, Lanchester, Dere Street and Stanley. About the eagle&#x27;s neck was a mural crown representing a city wall, and thus local government. On the eagle&#x27;s breast and wings were three crosses of Saint Cuthbert, patron saint of Durham: these suggested the union of three County Durham councils in one.

Upon a helm with torse and mantling was the crest. The swords and flames stood for the steel industry and the pickaxe for coalmining. Hanging from the axe was a Roman shield bearing a thunderbolt for the broadcasting station at Pontop Pike.

The Latin motto was &quot;Donec Defluet Amnis&quot; or &quot;Until the river ceases to flow&quot;. It was adapted from the writings of the Roman poet Horace.

== Town Twinning ==
Derwentside district was twinned with Werdohl in Germany.

== Abolition ==

The district was abolished as part of the 2009 structural changes to local government in England. On 1 April 2009 the two-tier system of administration in County Durham was replaced, with a unitary Durham County Council replacing both the existing county council and district councils.

In 2009, Durham County Council unveiled plans for the regeneration of Consett. These plans involved the demolition of the former headquarters of Derwentside District Council at Consett Civic Centre and the relocation of Consett AFC to Crookhall. The site was to be redeveloped and the new Consett Academy built there.

On 5 July 2010, the Secretary of State for Education announced plans for the overhaul of England&#x27;s school building programme. The announcement stated that it would be &quot;irresponsible to carry on regardless with an inflexible, and needlessly complex programme.&quot; Many building programmes that had not commenced were cancelled but the plans for Consett Academy and an academy at nearby Stanley were &quot;for discussion.&quot;

Local opponents to the building of an academy on the Belle Vue site in Consett launched an application to have the land registered as a village green. This would prohibit the development of the land. A public inquiry was held at Consett Civic Centre during the week commencing 12 July 2010.

<doc id="449058" wikidata="Q1049506" url="?curid=449058" title="Castle Point">
<text>Castle Point is a local government district with borough status in south Essex, England, lying around east of London. The borough comprises the towns of South Benfleet, Hadleigh and Thundersley (where the council is based) on the mainland, and the adjoining Canvey Island in the Thames Estuary, which is connected to the mainland by bridges.

The borough borders the City of Southend-on-Sea to the east, Rochford District to the north, the Borough of Basildon to the west, and the Thurrock unitary authority area to the south-west, across Holehaven Creek.

==History==
Castle Point was formed on 1 April 1974, under the Local Government Act 1972, as one of 14 non-metropolitan districts within Essex. The new district covered the areas of the former urban districts of Benfleet and Canvey Island, both of which were abolished at the same time.

The district was named &quot;Castle Point&quot;, combining references to landmarks in both of the former urban districts: Hadleigh Castle in Benfleet and Canvey Point at the eastern tip of Canvey Island.

The district was granted borough status with effect from 1 February 1992, allowing the chair of the council to take the title of mayor.

==Governance==
Castle Point Borough Council provides district-level services. County-level services are provided by Essex County Council. Canvey Island is a civil parish with a town council, forming a third tier of local government in that part of the borough. The mainland part of the borough (the former Benfleet Urban District) is an unparished area. In December of 2024 the Regulator of Social Housing issued a downgrade from a C3 to a C4 (the lowest consumer grade ) after the council was found to not be able to demonstrate mitigation of fire risk, failed to survey the majority of their properties over the last 5 years, lacked up to date electrical assessments for 40% of communal areas, a lack of domestic abuse policy and being unable to demonstrate its response to hate crime. 

===Political control===
Following the 2024 election, a majority of the seats on the council were held by local party the People&#x27;s Independent Party, which won all the seats on the mainland part of the borough, but did not contest any seats on Canvey Island. All the seats on Canvey Island were won by another local party, the Canvey Island Independent Party. The two parties had been running the council as coalition since the 2022 election, when the council had been under no overall control. Despite holding all the council&#x27;s seats between them following the 2024 election, the two parties agreed to continue to form a joint administration.

The first election to the council was held in 1973, initially operating as a shadow authority alongside the outgoing authorities until the new arrangements came into effect on 1 April 1974. Political control of the council since 1974 has been as follows:
===Leadership===
The role of mayor is largely ceremonial in Castle Point. Political leadership is instead provided by the leader of the council. The leaders since 2014 have been:

===Composition===
Following the 2024 election the composition of the council was:

Notably, Castle Point is currently the only council in England where no seat is held by the Labour Party, the Conservatives, the Liberal Democrats or the Green Party. The next election is due in May 2028.

===Premises===
The council is based at the Council Offices on Kiln Road in Thundersley. The building was built in 1962 as the headquarters of the former Benfleet Urban District Council.

==Elections==

Since the last boundary changes in 2024, the council has comprised 39 councillors representing 13 wards, with each ward electing three councillors. Elections are held every four years.

==Geography==

The national land use tables published by MHCLG show that in 2017, 56.6% of the borough was covered by green spaces including agriculture, forest and open land, water and outdoor recreation spaces. Close to one-fifth (18.2%) was accounted for by residential gardens. 

===Climate===
Climate in this area has mild differences between highs and lows, but despite adequate rainfall all year-round it is on average the driest part of the UK. The Köppen Climate Classification subtype for this climate is &quot;Cfb&quot; (Marine West Coast Climate/Oceanic climate).
==Demography==
The median age of Castle Point&#x27;s residents at the 2011 census was 45, compared to a regional average of 39 and national average of 40.

Castle Point has several estates laid out as seaside resorts for retirement, which is reflected in 7% of its population at the time of the 2011 census being aged 75 to 84, compared to 5.5% nationally.

==Transport==

The A13 crosses Castle Point and the A127 skirts it to the north, providing direct links to both Southend and London.

The only station in the borough is Benfleet railway station on the London, Tilbury and Southend line from London Fenchurch Street to Shoeburyness, operated by c2c.

Castle Point has an extensive bus network operated by the First Essex and Arriva Shires &amp; Essex, with services across the borough and to Southend, Basildon, Lakeside Shopping Centre and Rayleigh. Weekday services by Stephensons of Essex also travel to London, Southend and Thurrock College and Regal Busways offers a six-day-a-week service to Chelmsford.

==Sport and community facilities==
Waterside Farm Sports Centre, on Canvey Island is set in of parkland and has a range of indoor and outdoor facilities, including a 25-metre swimming pool, a learner pool and facilities for badminton, squash, netball, basketball, trampolining and gymnastics. The centre also includes an outdoor 6 lane, 400-metre athletics track. Opposite the sports centre is the Castle Point Golf Course, an 18-hole par 71 public pay-and-play course with a 17-bay floodlit driving range.

Runnymede Pool is situated behind the Council Offices in Kiln Road. It has a 25-metre pool and a learner pool and is home to Runnymede Swimming Club.

==Twinning==
Castle Point is twinned with three towns and counties: 
* Romainville, a north-eastern Paris suburb, since 30 March 1962.
* Cologne District, Germany. Formally since 19 June 1971 when Lövenich (now part of Cologne) was an independent town.
* County Roscommon, Republic of Ireland. Twinned with Castle Point council in April 1998.

==Places of interest==

Hadleigh Castle is preserved as an ancient monument from the 13th century, forming the most important historic site in the borough and the most important late medieval castle in Essex. The Dutch Cottage Museum contains a variety of exhibits that illustrate the history of Canvey Island, and the Castle Point Transport Museum, also situated on Canvey in the retired District bus depot, features a display of over thirty old buses, coaches and commercial vehicles.

<doc id="449061" wikidata="Q442643" url="?curid=449061" title="Simon Singh">
<text>Simon Lehna Singh, (born 19 September 1964) is a British popular science author, theoretical and particle physicist. His written works include &quot;Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem&quot; (in the United States titled &quot;Fermat&#x27;s Enigma: The Epic Quest to Solve the World&#x27;s Greatest Mathematical Problem&quot;), &quot;The Code Book&quot; (about cryptography and its history), &quot;Big Bang&quot; (about the Big Bang theory and the origins of the universe), &quot;Trick or Treatment? Alternative Medicine on Trial&quot; (about complementary and alternative medicine, co-written by Edzard Ernst) and &quot;The Simpsons and Their Mathematical Secrets&quot; (about mathematical ideas and theorems hidden in episodes of &quot;The Simpsons&quot; and &quot;Futurama&quot;). In 2012 Singh founded the Good Thinking Society, through which he created the website &quot;Parallel&quot; to help students learn mathematics.

Singh has also produced documentaries and works for television to accompany his books, is a trustee of the National Museum of Science and Industry, a patron of Humanists UK, founder of the Good Thinking Society, and co-founder of the Undergraduate Ambassadors Scheme.

==Early life and education==
Singh was born in a Sikh family to parents who emigrated from Punjab, India to Britain in 1950. He is the youngest of three brothers, his eldest brother being Tom Singh, the founder of the UK New Look chain of stores. Singh grew up in Wellington, Somerset, attending Wellington School, and went on to Imperial College London, where he studied physics. He was active in the student union, becoming President of the Royal College of Science Union. Later he completed a PhD in particle physics at the University of Cambridge as a postgraduate student of Emmanuel College, Cambridge while working at CERN, Geneva.

==Career==
In 1983, he was part of the UA2 experiment in CERN.
In 1987, Singh taught science at The Doon School, an independent all-boys&#x27; boarding school in India. In 1990 Singh returned to England and joined the BBC&#x27;s Science and Features Department, where he was a producer and director working on programmes such as &quot;Tomorrow&#x27;s World&quot; and &quot;Horizon&quot;. Singh was introduced to Richard Wiseman through their collaboration on &quot;Tomorrow&#x27;s World&quot;. At Wiseman&#x27;s suggestion, Singh directed a segment about politicians lying in different mediums, and getting the public&#x27;s opinion on whether the person was lying or not.
After attending some of Wiseman&#x27;s lectures, Singh came up with the idea to create a show together, and &quot;Theatre of Science&quot; was born. It was a way to deliver science to normal people in an entertaining manner. Richard Wiseman has influenced Singh in such a way that Singh states:
Singh directed his BAFTA award-winning documentary about the world&#x27;s most notorious mathematical problem entitled &quot;Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem&quot; in 1996. The film was memorable for its opening shot of a middle-aged mathematician, Andrew Wiles, holding back tears as he recalled the moment when he finally realised how to resolve the fundamental error in his proof of Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem. The documentary was originally transmitted in January 1996 as an edition of the BBC &quot;Horizon&quot; series. It was also aired in America as part of the NOVA series. &quot;The Proof&quot;, as it was re-titled, was nominated for an Emmy Award.

The story of this celebrated mathematical problem was also the subject of Singh&#x27;s first book, &quot;Fermat&#x27;s Last Theorem&quot;. In 1997, he began working on his second book, &quot;The Code Book&quot;, a history of codes and codebreaking. As well as explaining the science of codes and describing the impact of cryptography on history, the book also contends that cryptography is more important today than ever before. &quot;The Code Book&quot; has resulted in a return to television for him. He presented &quot;The Science of Secrecy&quot;, a five-part series for Channel 4. The stories in the series range from the cipher that sealed the fate of Mary, Queen of Scots, to the coded Zimmermann Telegram that changed the course of the First World War. Other programmes discuss how two great 19th-century geniuses raced to decipher Egyptian hieroglyphs and how modern encryption can guarantee privacy on the Internet.
On his activities as author he said in an interview to Imperial College London:
In October 2004, Singh published a book entitled &quot;Big Bang&quot;, which tells the history of the universe. It is told in his trademark style, by following the remarkable stories of the people who put the pieces together.
He made headlines in 2005 when he criticised the Katie Melua song &quot;Nine Million Bicycles&quot; for inaccurate lyrics referring to the size of the observable universe. Singh proposed corrected lyrics, though he used the value of 13.7 billion light years; accounting for expansion of the universe, the comoving distance to the edge of the observable universe is 46.5 billion light years. BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Today&quot; programme brought Melua and Singh together in a radio studio where Melua recorded a tongue-in-cheek version of the song that had been written by Singh.

Singh was part of an investigation about homeopathy in 2006. This investigation was made by the organization Sense about Science.
In the investigation, a student asked ten homeopaths for an alternative to her preventive malaria medication. All ten homeopaths recommended homeopathy as a substitute.
This investigation was reported by the BBC.

Singh is a member of the Advisory Council for the Campaign for Science and Engineering.

Singh has been involved in television and radio programmes, including &quot;Five Numbers&quot; (BBC Radio 4, 11 March 2002 to 20 September 2005).&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc.co.uk/p00cl73s&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Honorary degrees==
In 2003 Singh was awarded an honorary degree of &quot;Doctor of Letters (honoris causa)&quot; by Loughborough University, and in 2005 was given an honorary degree in mathematics by the University of Southampton.

In 2006, he was awarded an honorary Doctor of Design degree by the University of the West of England &quot;in recognition of Simon Singh&#x27;s outstanding contribution to the public understanding of science, in particular in the promotion of science, engineering and mathematics in schools and in the building of links between universities and schools&quot;. This was followed up by his receipt of the Kelvin Medal from the Institute of Physics in 2008, for his achievements in promoting Physics to the general public. In July 2008, he was also awarded a degree of Doctor of Science (&quot;Honoris Causa&quot;) by Royal Holloway, University of London.

In July 2011, he was awarded another degree of Doctor of Science (&quot;Honoris Causa&quot;) by the University of Kent at Canterbury for services to Science. In June 2012, Singh was awarded the Honorary Degree of Doctor of Science (&quot;honoris causa&quot;) for his contribution to science communication, education and academic freedom by The University of St Andrews.

==Other awards and honours==
In 2003, Singh was made a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) for services to science, technology and engineering in education and science communication.

In 2010 he became the inaugural recipient of the Lilavati Award.

In February 2011 he was elected as a Fellow of the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry.

Singh was awarded the 2022 IMA-LMS Christopher Zeeman Medal in recognition of his &quot;excellence in the communication of mathematics&quot;. The award citation mentioned his work in television, his published books, and his work in mathematics education.

==Chiropractic lawsuit ==
On 19 April 2008, &quot;The Guardian&quot; published Singh&#x27;s column &quot;Beware the Spinal Trap&quot;, an article that was critical of the practice of chiropractic and which resulted in Singh being sued for libel by the British Chiropractic Association (BCA).
The article developed the theme of the book that Singh and Edzard Ernst had published, &quot;Trick or Treatment? Alternative Medicine on Trial&quot;, and made various statements about the lack of usefulness of chiropractic &quot;for such problems as ear infections and infant colic&quot;:

When the case was brought against him, &quot;The Guardian&quot; supported him and funded his legal advice, as well as offering to pay the BCA&#x27;s legal costs in an out-of-court settlement if Singh chose to settle.
A &quot;furious backlash&quot; to the lawsuit resulted in the filing of formal complaints of false advertising against more than 500 individual chiropractors within one 24-hour period, with one national chiropractic organisation ordering its members to take down their websites, and &quot;Nature Medicine&quot; noting that the case had gathered wide support for Singh, as well as prompting calls for the reform of English libel laws. On 1 April 2010, Simon Singh won his court appeal for the right to rely on the defence of fair comment. On 15 April 2010, the BCA officially withdrew its lawsuit, ending the case.

To defend himself for the libel suit, Singh&#x27;s out-of-pocket legal costs were tens of thousands of pounds. The trial acted as a catalyst. The outrage over the initial ruling brought together several groups to support Singh and acted as a focus for libel reform campaigners, resulting in all major parties in the 2010 general election making manifesto commitments to libel reform.

On 25 April 2013 the Defamation Act 2013 received Royal Assent and became law. The purpose of the reformed law of defamation is to &#x27;ensure that a fair balance is struck between the right to freedom of expression and the protection of reputation&#x27;. Under the new law, claimants must show that they suffer serious harm before the court will accept the case. Additional protection for website operators, defence of &#x27;responsible publication on matters of public interest&#x27; and new statutory defences of truth and honest opinion are also part of the key areas of the new law.

<doc id="449063" wikidata="Q57314" url="?curid=449063" title="Robert Michels">
<text>Robert Michels (; 9 January 1876 – 3 May 1936) was a German-born Italian sociologist who contributed to elite theory by describing the political behavior of intellectual elites.

He belonged to the Italian school of elitism. He is best known for his book &quot;Political Parties&quot;, published in 1911, which contains a description of the &quot;iron law of oligarchy.&quot; He was a friend and disciple of Max Weber, Werner Sombart and Achille Loria.

Politically, he moved from the Social Democratic Party of Germany to the Italian Socialist Party, adhering to the Italian revolutionary syndicalist wing and later to Italian Fascism, which he saw as a more democratic form of socialism. His ideas provided the basis of moderation theory which delineates the processes through which radical political groups are incorporated into the existing political system.

==Early life and education==
Michels was born to a wealthy German family in Cologne, Germany on January 9, 1876.

He studied in England, Paris (at the Sorbonne), and at universities in Munich, Leipzig (1897), Halle (1898), and Turin. He became a socialist while teaching at the Protestant University of Marburg and became active in the Social Democratic Party of Germany for whom he was an unsuccessful candidate in the 1903 German federal election. In Italy, he associated with Italian revolutionary syndicalism, a leftist branch of the Italian Socialist Party (PSI). He left both parties in 1907.

==Career==

He achieved international recognition for his historical and sociological study, &quot;Zur Soziologie des Parteiwesens in der modernen Demokratie. Untersuchungen über die oligarchischen Tendenzen des Gruppenlebens&quot;, which was published in 1911; its title in English is &quot;Political Parties: A Sociological Study of the Oligarchical Tendencies of Modern Democracy&quot;. In it, he presented his theory of the &quot;iron law of oligarchy&quot; that political parties, including those considered socialist, cannot be democratic because they quickly transform themselves into bureaucratic oligarchies.

Michels attended the First International Eugenics Congress in 1912 where he delivered a paper entitled &quot;Eugenics in Party Organization&quot;.
Michels was considered a brilliant pupil of Max Weber, who began publishing his writings in the &quot;Archiv für Sozialwissenschaft und Sozialpolitik&quot; in 1906 and appointed him as co-editor in 1913, but they disagreed over Michels&#x27; opposition to World War I.

Michels criticized what he perceived to be Karl Marx&#x27;s materialistic determinism. Michels borrowed from Werner Sombart&#x27;s historical methods. Because Michels admired Italian culture and was prominent in the social sciences, he was brought to the attention of Luigi Einaudi and Achille Loria. They succeeded in procuring for Michels a professorship at the University of Turin in 1907, where he taught economics, political science and socioeconomics until 1914. He then became professor of economics at the University of Basel, Switzerland, a post he held until 1928. He also taught at the University of Messina in 1921.

In 1924, he joined the Fascist Party, led by Benito Mussolini, former director of the Italian Socialist Party&#x27;s newspaper &quot;&quot;Avanti!&quot;&quot;. Michels was convinced that the direct link between Benito Mussolini&#x27;s charisma and the working class was in some way the best means to realize a real lower social class government without political bureaucratic mediation. In 1928, he became professor of economics and the history of doctrines at the University of Perugia and occasionally lectured in Rome.

He caught an illness in Bordeaux and died shortly thereafter in Rome on May 3, 1936.

<doc id="449064" wikidata="Q1496198" url="?curid=449064" title="Uttlesford">
<text>Uttlesford is a local government district in Essex, England. Its council is based in the town of Saffron Walden. The district also includes the town of Great Dunmow and numerous villages, including Stansted Mountfitchet, Takeley, Elsenham, Thaxted, and Newport. The district covers a largely rural area in the north-west of Essex. London Stansted Airport lies within the district.

The neighbouring districts are Braintree, Chelmsford, Epping Forest, East Hertfordshire, North Hertfordshire and South Cambridgeshire.

==History==
The district was formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972 as one of 14 districts within Essex. The new district covered the area of three former districts, which were all abolished at the same time:
*Dunmow Rural District
*Saffron Walden Municipal Borough
*Saffron Walden Rural District
The new district was named after the ancient hundred of Uttlesford, which had covered much of the area.

The hundred had been named after a ford on the London Road (now the B1383, formerly the A11) at Wendens Ambo, since replaced by a bridge. The ford appears to derive its name from &quot;Udel&#x27;s ford&quot;. The stream at the ford is sometimes informally called the River Uttle as a back-formation from the name of the ford.

Hundreds gradually lost their functions to other bodies from the seventeenth century onwards, with their final administrative function ceasing in 1886. The name Uttlesford continued to have occasional use in the area between then and 1974, such as the Uttlesford Orchestra, founded in 1956, which played in and around Saffron Walden.

==Governance==

Uttlesford District Council provides district-level services. County-level services are provided by Essex County Council. The whole district is also covered by civil parishes, which form a third tier of local government.

===Political control===
The council has been controlled by local party Residents for Uttlesford (R4U) since the 2019 election.

The first election to the council was held in 1973, initially operating as a shadow authority alongside the outgoing authorities until the new arrangements came into effect on 1 April 1974. Political control of the council since 1974 has been as follows:

===Leadership===
The leaders of the council since 1995 have been:

===Composition===
Following the 2023 election, the composition of the council was:
The next election is due in 2027.

===Premises===
The council is based at the Council Offices on London Road in Saffron Walden. When the council was created in 1974 it inherited offices at 46 High Street, Dunmow from the Dunmow Rural District Council, at 5 Hill Street, Saffron Walden from Saffron Walden Borough Council and at 52 Debden Road, Saffron Walden from the Saffron Walden Rural District Council. In 1988 the former Saffron Walden General Hospital on London Road closed and the site was bought by the council. The original hospital building of 1865 was renovated and a large extension built to its west to become a new headquarters for the council, which opened in May 1990.

==Elections==

Since the last full review of boundaries in 2015 the council has comprised 39 councillors representing 22 wards, each electing one, two or three councillors. Elections are held every four years.

==Parishes==
The district is entirely covered by civil parishes. The parish councils for Great Dunmow and Saffron Walden are styled &quot;town councils&quot;.

The two parishes of Elmdon and Wenden Lofts share a parish council called &quot;Elmdon, Duddenhoe End and Wenden Lofts&quot;, and the two parishes of Great Easton and Tilty also share a grouped parish council. Great Sampford and Little Sampford share a parish council called &quot;The Sampfords&quot;. The parishes are:

*Arkesden

National Cycle Route 16 runs east-west between Stansted Mountfitchet and Braintree, via Great Dunmow town centre. The route runs for much of its length on segregated cycle track converted from the course of the former Bishop&#x27;s Stortford to Braintree railway, and it runs unbroken through the district, mostly parallel to the A120.

National Cycle Network 50 runs north-south between Takeley and Quendon in Uttlesford. The route ultimately runs between Quendon and Ulting (near Maldon) running entirely on country lanes.

==Unique features==
The district is the only British local authority (excluding parishes) to begin with the letter &#x27;u&#x27;. The only other initial letter used by only one UK local authority is &#x27;y&#x27; for York.

<doc id="449066" wikidata="Q1752638" url="?curid=449066" title="Tendring District">
<text>Tendring District is a local government district in north-east Essex, England. Its council is based in Clacton-on-Sea, the largest town. Other towns are Brightlingsea, Harwich, Frinton-on-Sea and Walton-on-the-Naze.

The district borders the City of Colchester to the west and the Babergh District of Suffolk, across the estuary of the River Stour, to the north. To the east and south, it faces the North Sea, with the estuary of the River Colne to the south-west. The area is sometimes referred to as the &quot;Tendring Peninsula&quot;.

The modern local government district was formed in 1974. The name &quot;Tendring&quot; comes from the ancient Tendring Hundred which was named after the small village of Tendring.

==History==

The district was formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, covering the whole area of five former districts, which were all abolished at the same time:
*Brightlingsea Urban District
*Clacton Urban District
*Frinton and Walton Urban District
*Harwich Municipal Borough
*Tendring Rural District

The new district was named Tendring after the ancient Tendring Hundred, which was in turn named after the small village of Tendring at the centre of the area. 

The 1086 Domesday Book records the name as &quot;Tenderinga&quot; and in 1242 the Pipe Rolls mention it as &quot;Terring&quot;.

The Tendring Poor Law Union, established in 1835, had covered the same area as the present district.

During the English Civil War, the self-appointed Witchfinder General Matthew Hopkins carried out many trials throughout this and the surrounding area, especially in the town of Manningtree and village of Mistley on the River Stour.

==Governance==
Tendring District Council provides district-level services. County-level services are provided by Essex County Council. Much of the district is also covered by civil parishes, which form a third tier of local government.

===Political control===
The council has been under no overall control since the 2023 election, being led by a coalition of independent councillors, Labour and the Liberal Democrats.

The first election to the council was held in 1973, initially operating as a shadow authority alongside the outgoing authorities until the new arrangements came into effect on 1 April 1974. Political control of the council since 1974 has been as follows:
===Leadership===
The leaders of the council since 2009 have been:

===Composition===

Since the last boundary changes in 2019 there have been 48 councillors representing 32 wards, with each ward electing one, two or three councillors. Elections are held every four years.

Following the 2023 election, a by-election in January 2024 and changes of allegiance up to June 2024, the composition of the council was:

Of the independent councillors, eleven sit with the Tendring First councillor as the &quot;Tendring Independents&quot; group, five sit as the &quot;Independent Group&quot;, three form the &quot;Tendring Residents&#x27; Alliance&quot; and two do not belong to any group. The council&#x27;s administration is a coalition of the Tendring Independents, the Independent Group, Labour and the Liberal Democrats. The next election is due in 2027.

===Premises===
The council has its main offices and meeting place at Clacton Town Hall on Station Road. The building had been built for the former Clacton Urban District Council in 1931.

==Geography==

The highest part of the district is a low (115 feet; 35 metres) ridge running west to east only 2 miles (3 km) south of the River Stour. The greater part of the district is undulating land sloping very gently to the south which is traversed by a number of streams.

In the extreme east of the district is an area formerly known as the Soken which was granted special privileges in Saxon times. It is remembered in the place names Kirby-le-Soken, Thorpe-le-Soken and Walton-le-Soken (an older name for Walton-on-the-Naze).

==Demography==

Tendring district contains the most deprived part of England, in the Jaywick area. This area was ranked as the most deprived are in the government&#x27;s indices of deprivation in 2010, 2015 and 2019 (being the most recent survey as at 2022).

==Media==
In terms of television, the district is served by BBC East and ITV Anglia with television signals received from the Sudbury TV transmitter.

Radio stations for the area are:
*BBC Essex
*BBC Radio Suffolk
*Heart East
*Greatest Hits Radio Essex 
*Actual Radio

Local newspapers are the &quot;Colchester Gazette&quot;, &quot;Essex County Standard&quot;, the Clacton, Frinton and Walton Gazette, and the Harwich and Manningtree Standard.

==Parishes==
There are 27 civil parishes in the district. The former Clacton Urban District is an unparished area. The parish councils of Brightlingsea, Frinton and Walton, Harwich, and Manningtree take the style &quot;town council&quot;.

<text>East Hampshire is a local government district in Hampshire, England. Its council is based in the town of Petersfield, although the largest town is Alton. The district also contains the town of Bordon along with many villages and surrounding rural areas.

Parts of the district lie within the South Downs National Park. The neighbouring districts are Havant, Winchester, Basingstoke and Deane, Hart, Waverley and Chichester.

==History==
East Hampshire was created on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, covering the area of four former districts which were all abolished at the same time:
*Alton Rural District
*Alton Urban District
*Petersfield Rural District
*Petersfield Urban District
The district was originally proposed to be called Petersfield. The shadow authority elected in 1973 to oversee the transition to the new system requested a change of name to East Hampshire, which was confirmed by the government on 8 October 1973, before the new district formally came into being.

Between 2009 and 2022 the council shared a chief executive with neighbouring Havant Borough Council.

==Governance==
East Hampshire District Council provides district-level services. County-level services are provided by Hampshire County Council. The whole district is covered by civil parishes, which form a third tier of local government.

In the parts of the district within the South Downs National Park, town planning is the responsibility of the South Downs National Park Authority. The district council appoints one of its councillors to serve on the 27-person National Park Authority.

===Political control===
The council has been under no overall control since the 2023 election, being led by a coalition of the Conservatives and local party the Whitehill and Bordon Community Party.

The first election to the council was held in 1973, initially operating as a shadow authority alongside the outgoing authorities until the new arrangements took effect on 1 April 1974. Political control of the council since 1974 has been as follows:
===Leadership===

===Composition===
Following the 2023 election, the composition of the council was:
The next election is due in 2027.

<doc id="449071" wikidata="Q1299608" url="?curid=449071" title="Iron law of oligarchy">
<text>The iron law of oligarchy is a political theory first developed by the German-born Italian sociologist Robert Michels in his 1911 book &quot;Political Parties&quot;. It asserts that rule by an elite, or oligarchy, is inevitable as an &quot;iron law&quot; within any democratic organization as part of the &quot;tactical and technical necessities&quot; of the organization.

Michels&#x27; theory states that all complex organizations, regardless of how democratic they are when started, eventually develop into oligarchies. Michels observed that since no sufficiently large and complex organization can function purely as a direct democracy, power within an organization will always get delegated to individuals within that group, elected or otherwise. As he put it in &quot;Political Parties&quot;, &quot;It is organization which gives dominion of the elected over the electors. [...] Who says organization, says oligarchy.&quot;

According to Michels, all organizations eventually come to be run by a leadership class who often function as paid administrators, executives, spokespersons or political strategists for the organization. Far from being servants of the masses, Michels argues this leadership class, rather than the organization&#x27;s membership, will inevitably grow to dominate the organization&#x27;s power structures. By controlling who has access to information, those in power can centralize their power successfully, often with little accountability, due to the apathy, indifference and non-participation most rank-and-file members have in relation to their organization&#x27;s decision-making processes. Democratic attempts to hold leadership positions accountable are prone to fail, since with power comes the ability to reward loyalty, the ability to control information about the organization, and the ability to control what procedures the organization follows when making decisions. All of these mechanisms can be used to strongly influence the outcome of any decisions made &#x27;democratically&#x27; by members.

In 1911 using anecdotes from the histories of political parties and trade unions struggling to operate democratically, Michels considered his argument applicable to representative democracy at large. He believed that &quot;[h]istorical evolution mocks all the prophylactic measures that have been adopted for the prevention of oligarchy.&quot;

== History ==
In 1911, Robert Michels argued that, paradoxically, the socialist parties of Europe, despite their democratic ideology and provisions for mass participation, seemed to be dominated by their leaders just like traditional conservative parties. Michels&#x27; conclusion was that the problem lay in the very nature of organizations. The more liberal and democratic modern era allowed the formation of organizations with innovative and revolutionary goals, but as such organizations become more complex, they became less and less democratic and revolutionary. Michels formulated the &quot;iron law of oligarchy&quot;: &quot;Who says organization, says oligarchy.&quot;

He later became an important ideologue of Benito Mussolini&#x27;s fascist regime in Italy, teaching economics at the University of Perugia.

== Reasons ==
Michels stressed several factors that underlie the iron law of oligarchy. Darcy K. Leach summarized them briefly as: &quot;Bureaucracy happens. If bureaucracy happens, power rises. Power corrupts.&quot; Any large organization, Michels pointed out, has to create a bureaucracy in order to maintain its efficiency as it becomes larger—many decisions have to be made daily that cannot be made by large numbers of disorganized people. For the organization to function effectively, centralization has to occur and power will end up in the hands of a few. Those few—the oligarchy—will use all means necessary to preserve and further increase their power.

According to Michels, this process is further compounded as delegation is necessary in any large organization, as thousands—sometimes hundreds of thousands—of members cannot make decisions via participatory democracy. This has to date been dictated by the lack of technological means for large numbers of people to meet and debate, and also by matters related to crowd psychology, as Michels argued that people feel a need to be led. Delegation, however, leads to specialization—to the development of knowledge bases, skills and resources among a leadership—which further alienates the leadership from the rank and file and entrenches the leadership in office. Michels also argued that for leaders in organizations, &quot;The desire to dominate [...] is universal. These are elementary psychological facts.&quot; Thus, they were prone to seek power and dominance.

Bureaucratization and specialization are the driving processes behind the iron law. They result in the rise of a group of professional administrators in a hierarchical organization, which in turn leads to the rationalization and routinization of authority and decision-making, a process described first and perhaps best by Max Weber, later by John Kenneth Galbraith, and to a lesser and more cynical extent by the Peter principle.

Bureaucracy by design leads to centralization of power by the leaders. Leaders also have control over sanctions and rewards. They tend to promote those who share their opinions, which inevitably leads to self-perpetuating oligarchy. People achieve leadership positions because they have above-average political skill (see Charismatic authority). As they advance in their careers, their power and prestige increases. Leaders control the information that flows down the channels of communication, censoring what they do not want the rank-and-file to know. Leaders will also dedicate significant resources to persuade the rank-and-file of the rightness of their views. This is compatible with most societies: people are taught to obey those in positions of authority. Therefore, the rank and file show little initiative, and wait for the leaders to exercise their judgment and issue directives to follow.

== Implications ==
The &quot;iron law of oligarchy&quot; states that all forms of organization, regardless of how democratic they may be at the start, will eventually and inevitably develop oligarchic tendencies, thus making true democracy practically and theoretically impossible, especially in large groups and complex organizations. The relative structural fluidity in a small-scale democracy succumbs to &quot;social viscosity&quot; in a large-scale organization. According to the &quot;iron law&quot;, democracy and large-scale organization are incompatible.

== Examples and exceptions ==
An example that Michels used in his book was Germany&#x27;s Social Democratic Party.

=== Labour unions and Lipset&#x27;s &quot;Union Democracy&quot; ===
One of the best known exceptions to the iron law of oligarchy is the now defunct International Typographical Union, described by Seymour Martin Lipset in his 1956 book, &quot;Union Democracy&quot;. Lipset suggests a number of factors that existed in the ITU that are supposedly responsible for countering this tendency toward bureaucratic oligarchy. The first and perhaps most important has to do with the way the union was founded. Unlike many other unions (e.g., the CIO&#x27;s United Steel Workers of America (USWA), and numerous other craft unions) which were organized from the top down, the ITU had a number of large, strong, local unions who valued their autonomy, which existed long before the international was formed. This local autonomy was strengthened by the economy of the printing industry which operated in largely local and regional markets, with little competition from other geographical areas. Large locals continued to jealously guard this autonomy against encroachments by international officers. Second, the existence of factions helped place a check on the oligarchic tendencies that existed at the national headquarters. Leaders that are unchecked tend to develop larger salaries and more sumptuous lifestyles, making them unwilling to go back to their previous jobs. But with a powerful out faction ready to expose profligacy, no leaders dared take overly generous personal remuneration. These two factors were compelling in the ITU case.

Lipset and his collaborators also cite a number of other factors which are specific to craft unions in general and the printing crafts in particular, including the homogeneity of the membership, with respect to their work and lifestyles, their identification with their craft, their more middle class lifestyle and pay. For this latter point he draws upon Aristotle who argued that a democratic polity was most likely where there was a large, stable middle class, and the extremes of wealth and poverty were not great. Finally, the authors note the irregular work hours which led shop mates to spend more of their leisure time together. These latter factors are less persuasive, since they do not apply to many industrial forms of organization, where the greatest amount of trade union democracy has developed in recent times.

=== University student unions ===
Titus Gregory uses Michels &quot;iron law&quot; to describe how the democratic centralist structure of the Canadian Federation of Students, consisting of individual student unions, encourages oligarchy.

Titus Gregory argues that university students&#x27; unions today &quot;exhibit both oligarchical and democratic tendencies&quot;. Unlike trade unions they have an ideologically diverse membership, and frequently have competitive democratic elections covered by independent campus media who guard their independence. These factors are strongly democratizing influences, creating conditions similar to those described by Lipset about the ITU. However, Gregory argues student unions can also be highly undemocratic and oligarchical as a result of the transient membership of the students involved. Every year between one quarter and one half of the membership turns over, and Gregory argues this creates a situation where elected student leaders become dependent on student union staff for institutional memory and guidance. Since many students&#x27; unions extract compulsory fees from their transient membership, and many smaller colleges and/or commuter campus can extract this money with little accountability, oligarchical behaviour becomes encouraged. For example, Gregory points out how often student union election rules &quot;operate under tyrannical rules and regulations&quot; that are used frequently by those in power to disqualify or exclude would-be election challengers. Gregory concludes that students&#x27; unions can &quot;resist the iron law of oligarchy&quot; if they have &quot;an engaged student community&quot;, an &quot;independent student media&quot;, a &quot;strong tradition of freedom of information&quot;, and an &quot;unbiased elections authority&quot; capable of administrating elections fairly.

=== Participatory subgroups and countervailing power ===
Jonathan Fox&#x27;s 1992 study of Mexican peasant organizations focuses on how participatory subgroups within a membership organization can generate a degree of countervailing power that can at least temporarily mitigate the &quot;iron law of oligarchy.&quot;

=== Wikipedia ===
Research by Piotr Konieczny from 2009, a case study of the evolution of Wikipedia&#x27;s policy on verifiability, argued that Wikipedia is not significantly affected by the iron law. However, a 2016 study by Bradi Heaberlin and Simon DeDeo has found that the evolution of Wikipedia&#x27;s network of norms over time is consistent with the iron law of oligarchy. Their quantitative analysis is based on data-mining over a decade of article and user information. It shows the emergence of an oligarchy derived from competencies in five significant &quot;clusters&quot;: administration, article quality, collaboration, formatting, and content policy. Heaberlin and DeDeo note: &quot;The encyclopedia&#x27;s core norms address universal principles, such as neutrality, verifiability, civility, and consensus. The ambiguity and interpretability of these abstract concepts may drive them to decouple from each other over time.&quot;

== Adolf Gasser&#x27;s proposed solution ==
In his book , published in 1943 (first edition in German) with a second edition in 1947 (in German), Adolf Gasser stated the following requirements for a representative democracy in order to remain stable, unaffected by Michels&#x27; iron law of oligarchy:
* Society has to be built up from bottom to top. As a consequence, society is built up by people, who are free and have the power to defend themselves with weapons.
* These free people join or form local communities. These local communities are independent, which includes financial independence, and they are free to determine their own rules.
* Local communities join together into a higher unit e.g. a canton.
* There is no hierarchical bureaucracy.
* There is competition between these local communities e.g. on services delivered or on taxes.

== Reception ==
In 1954, Maurice Duverger expressed general agreement with Michels&#x27;s thesis. In a 1953 study, C. W. Cassinelli argued that Michels&#x27;s main thesis has &quot;a high degree of general credibility&quot;, but argued that the statement of the theory was &quot;inadequate&quot; and that Michels&#x27;s evidence for the theory was &quot;inconclusive&quot;. In a 1966 article, political scientist Dankwart Rustow described Michels&#x27;s thesis as &quot;a brilliantly fallacious argument &quot;a fortiori&quot;&quot;. Rustow stated that the experience of the social democratic parties of Europe could not be generalized for other political parties. Josiah Ober argues in &quot;Democracy and Knowledge&quot; that the experience of ancient Athens shows Michels&#x27;s argument does not hold true; Athens was a large participatory democracy, yet it outperformed its hierarchical rivals.

According to a 2000 article, &quot;To the extent that contemporary scholars ask at all about social movement organizations, they tend to reinforce Michels’s claim that bureaucratized, established organizations are more conservative in goals and tactics, though usually without explicitly engaging the iron law debate.&quot; The study however found that the iron law was malleable, and that established labor unions could under certain circumstances revitalize and experience radical change in line with its members&#x27; desires.

According to a 2005 study, &quot;Despite almost a century of scholarly debate on this question ... there is still no consensus about whether and under what conditions Michels’s claim holds true.&quot; One criticism is that power does not necessarily corrupt the leadership of organizations, and that the structure of organizations can check leaders. Another criticism is that Michels does not outline the conditions under which his thesis could be falsified nor a clear definition of what constitutes oligarchy.

The method that Michels uses has sometimes been characterized as a &quot;crucial&quot; or &quot;least likely&quot; case study, because he chose a case (the German Social Democratic Party) that is least likely to support his theory (because the German Social Democratic Party was an institution that had a democratic process and ideology).

Michels&#x27; thesis became popular once more in the postwar United States with the publication of &quot;Union Democracy: The Internal Politics of the International Typographical Union&quot; (1956) by Lipset, Trow, and Coleman.

== Other ==
The iron law of oligarchy is similar to the concept in &quot;The Theory and Practice of Oligarchical Collectivism&quot;, a fictional book in the dystopian novel &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot; (1984) by George Orwell, who had written a review of James Burnham&#x27;s book &quot;The Managerial Revolution&quot; several years earlier. That fictional book begins:

<text>Rushmoor is a local government district with borough status in Hampshire, England. It covers the towns of Farnborough and Aldershot, the former of which is the location of the council.

The neighbouring districts are Hart, Surrey Heath, Guildford and Waverley.

==History==
The district was created on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, covering the whole area of two former districts, which were both abolished at the same time:
*Aldershot Municipal Borough
*Farnborough Urban District
The new district was named Rushmoor, taking its name from an old area of heath on the west side of the borough, known for Rushmoor Arena, a military showground constructed in 1923. The new district was granted borough status from its creation, allowing the chair of the council to take the title of mayor.

In May 2000, a referendum was held on whether to change the name of the borough. Two alternative names were suggested in place of Rushmoor: &quot;Aldershot and Farnborough&quot; or &quot;Farnborough and Aldershot&quot;. In the event, more than 81% of those who voted chose to retain the name, on a turnout of 29%.

The population of the area that would become Rushmoor was 1,366 in 1801, growing to 39,616 in 1901. It was over 100,000 at 2021 census.

==Governance==
Rushmoor Borough Council provides district-level services. County-level services are provided by Hampshire County Council. There are no civil parishes in the borough, which is an unparished area.

===Political control===
The council has been under Labour Party majority control since the 2024 election; the first time the party had won a majority on the council in its history.

The first election to the council was held in 1973, initially acting as a shadow authority alongside the outgoing authorities until the new arrangements took effect on 1 April 1974.

===Leadership===
The role of mayor is largely ceremonial in Rushmoor. Political leadership is instead provided by the leader of the council. The leaders since 2001 have been:

===Composition===
Following the 2024 election, the composition of the council was:

The next election is due in May 2026.

===Elections===

Since the last boundary changes in 2012 the council has comprised 39 councillors representing 13 wards, with each ward electing three councillors. Elections are held three years out of every four, with a third of the council (one councillor for each ward) elected each time for a four-year term of office. Hampshire County Council elections are held in the fourth year of the cycle when there are no borough council elections.

===Premises===
On its creation in 1974 the council&#x27;s offices were divided between the buildings inherited from its predecessor authorities, being Aldershot Town Hall and Farnborough Town Hall. Shortly afterwards the council decided to replace both buildings with a single headquarters. A site known as Elles Mess in Farnborough was bought from the British Army and a new building called Council Offices built there, which was completed in 1981.

==Economy==
===Aviation===
The Borough of Rushmoor stated that Farnborough Airfield, including the RAE, historically was a major employment area in Rushmoor. In the 1960s, over 10,000 employees worked at the airport. In May 1996, 5,800 jobs, 13% of the total jobs in Rushmoor, were at the airport. In June 2009, TAG submitted an application to increase the total number of flight movements from 28000 a year to a maximum of 50,000 a year and to increase the number of flight movements at weekends and on Bank Holidays from 5,000 a year to 8,900 a year. This went to appeal and the secretary of state allowed it to go ahead in February 2011, overruling the Borough Council&#x27; refusal.
The Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB), the British aviation accident investigation agency, is based within the airport.

==Demographics==

According to the UK census in 2021, Rushmoor has the highest number of Buddhists in England and Wales, at 4.7% of the population. The area contains the Aldershot Buddhist Centre, a Nepali Vajrayana temple founded by immigrant communities.

==Twin towns - sister cities==

Rushmoor is twinned with:
*Dayton, Ohio, United States &quot;(since 2019)&quot;
*Gorkha Municipality, Nepal &quot;(since 2020)&quot;
*Meudon, France &quot;(since 1974)&quot;
*Oberursel, Germany &quot;(since 1989)&quot;
*Rzeszów, Poland &quot;(since 2019)&quot;
*Sulechów, Poland &quot;(since 2001)&quot;

<text>Run-length limited or RLL coding is a line coding technique that is used to send arbitrary data over a communications channel with bandwidth limits. RLL codes are defined by four main parameters: &quot;m&quot;, &quot;n&quot;, &quot;d&quot;, &quot;k&quot;. The first two, &quot;m&quot;/&quot;n&quot;, refer to the rate of the code, while the remaining two specify the minimal &quot;d&quot; and maximal &quot;k&quot; number of zeroes between consecutive ones. This is used in both telecommunication and storage systems that move a medium past a fixed recording head.

Specifically, RLL bounds the length of stretches (runs) of repeated bits during which the signal does not change. If the runs are too long, clock recovery is difficult; if they are too short, the high frequencies might be attenuated by the communications channel. By modulating the data, RLL reduces the timing uncertainty in decoding the stored data, which would lead to the possible erroneous insertion or removal of bits when reading the data back. This mechanism ensures that the boundaries between bits can always be accurately found (preventing bit slip), while efficiently using the media to reliably store the maximal amount of data in a given space.

Early disk drives used very simple encoding schemes, such as RLL (0,1) FM code, followed by RLL (1,3) MFM code, which were widely used in hard disk drives until the mid-1980s and are still used in digital optical discs such as CD, DVD, MD, Hi-MD and Blu-ray. Higher-density RLL (2,7) and RLL (1,7) codes became the de facto industry standard for hard disks by the early 1990s.

==Need for RLL coding==
On a hard disk drive, information is represented by changes in the direction of the magnetic field on the disk, and on magnetic media, the playback output is proportional to the density of flux transition. In a computer, information is represented by the voltage on a wire. No voltage on the wire in relation to a defined ground level would be a binary zero, and a positive voltage on the wire in relation to ground represents a binary one. Magnetic media, on the other hand, always carries a magnetic flux either a &quot;north&quot; pole or a &quot;south&quot; pole. In order to convert the magnetic fields to binary data, some encoding method must be used to translate between the two.

One of the simplest practical codes, modified non-return-to-zero-inverted (NRZI), simply encodes a 1 as a magnetic polarity transition, also known as a &quot;flux reversal&quot;, and a zero as no transition. With the disk spinning at a constant rate, each bit is given an equal time period, a &quot;data window&quot;, for the magnetic signal that represents that bit, and the flux reversal, if any, occurs at the start of this window. (Note: older hard disks used one fixed length of time as the data window over the whole disk, but modern disks are more complicated; for more on this, see zoned bit recording.)

This method is not quite that simple, as the playback output is proportional to the density of ones, a long run of zeros means no playback output at all.

In a simple example, consider the binary pattern 101 with a data window of 1 ns (one nanosecond, or one billionth of a second). This will be stored on the disk as a change, followed by no change, and then another change. If the preceding magnetic polarity was already positive, the resulting pattern might look like this: −−+. A value of 255, or all binary ones, would be written as −+−+−+−+ or +−+−+−+−. A zero byte would be written as ++++++++ or −−−−−−−−. A 512-byte sector of zeros would be written as 4096 sequential bits with the same polarity.

Since a disk drive is a physical piece of hardware, the rotational speed of the drive can change slightly, due to a change in the motor speed or thermal expansion of the disk platter. The physical media on a floppy disk can also become deformed, causing larger timing errors, and the timing circuit on the controller itself may have small variations in speed. The problem is that, with a long string of zeros, there&#x27;s no way for the disk drive&#x27;s controller to know the exact position of the read head, and thus no way to know exactly how many zeros there are. A speed variation of even 0.1%, which is more precise than any practical floppy drive, could result in 4 bits being added to or removed from the 4096-bit data stream. Without some form of synchronization and error correction, the data would become completely unusable.

The other problem is due to the limits of magnetic media itself: it is only possible to write so many polarity changes in a certain amount of space, so there&#x27;s an upper limit to how many ones can also be written sequentially, this depends on the linear velocity and the head gap.

To prevent this problem, data is coded in such a way that long repetitions of a single binary value do not occur. By limiting the number of zeros written consecutively to some maximum &quot;k&quot;, this makes it possible for the drive controller to stay synchronized. By limiting the number of zeros written in a row to some minimum &quot;d&quot; between each and every one, the overall frequency of polarity changes is reduced, allowing the drive to store more data in the same amount of space, resulting in either a smaller package for the same amount of data or more storage in the same size package.

==History==

All codes used to record on magnetic disks have limited the length of transition-free runs and can therefore be technically characterized as RLL codes. The earliest and simplest variants were given specific names, such as modified frequency modulation (MFM), and the name &quot;RLL&quot; is commonly used only for the more complex variants not given such specific names, but the term technically applies to them all.

Outside of this simplest version, the first RLL code used in hard drives was RLL (2,7), developed by IBM engineers and first used commercially in 1979 on the IBM 3370 DASD, for use with the 4300 series mainframe. During the late 1980s, PC hard disks began using RLL proper (i.e. variants more complex than those that had received their own proper names, such as MFM). RLL codes have found almost universal application in optical-disc recording practice since 1980. In consumer electronics, RLLs like the EFM code (rate = 8/17, &quot;d&quot; = 2, &quot;k&quot; = 10) are employed in the Compact Disc (CD) and MiniDisc (MD), and the EFMPlus code (rate = 8/16, &quot;d&quot; = 2, &quot;k&quot; = 10) used in the DVD. Parameters &quot;d&quot; and &quot;k&quot; are the minimal and maximal allowed run lengths. For more coverage on the storage technologies, the references cited in this article are useful.

==Technical overview==
Generally &quot;run length&quot; is the number of bits for which signal remains unchanged. A run length of 3 for bit 1, represents a sequence 111. For instance, the pattern of magnetic polarizations on the disk might be +−−−−++−−−++++++, with runs of length 1, 4, 2, 3, and 6. However, run-length limited coding terminology assumes NRZI encoding, so 1 bits indicate changes and 0 bits indicate the absence of change, the above sequence would be expressed as 11000101001000001, and only runs of zero bits are counted.

Somewhat confusingly, the run length is the number of zeros (0, 3, 1, 2 and 5 in the preceding) between adjacent ones, which is one less than the number of bit times the signal actually remains unchanged. Run-length limited sequences are characterized by two parameters, &quot;d&quot; and &quot;k&quot;, which stipulate the minimal and maximal zero-bit run length that can occur in the sequence. So RLL codes are generally specified as (&quot;d&quot;,&quot;k&quot;) RLL, e.g.: (1,3) RLL.

==Coding==
In the encoded format a &quot;1&quot; bit indicates a flux transition, while a &quot;0&quot; indicates that the magnetic field on the disk does not change for that time interval.

===FM: (0,1) RLL===
Generally, the term &quot;RLL code&quot; is used to refer to more elaborate encodings, but the original Frequency Modulation code, also called differential Manchester encoding, can be seen as a simple rate-1/2 RLL code.
The added 1 bits are referred to as clock bits.

Example:
 Data: 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0
 Encoded: 1010111011111011101010111110
 Clock: 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1

===GCR: (0,2) RLL===
By extending the maximal run length to 2 adjacent 0 bits, the data rate can be improved to 4/5. This is the original IBM group coded recording variant

Where possible (11 out of 16 codes), the bit pattern codice_1 is encoded by prefixing it with the complement of &quot;a&quot;: codice_1. In the 5 cases where this would violate one of the rules (codice_3 or codice_4), a code beginning with 11 is substituted (codice_5, where &quot;e&quot; = &quot;a&quot; ∨ &quot;d&quot;).

Example:
 Data: 0010 1101 0001 1000
 Encoded: 10010011011101111010

Note that to meet the definition of (0,2) RLL, it is not sufficient only that each 5-bit code contain no more than two consecutive zeros, but it is also necessary that any pair of 5-bit codes as a combined sequentially not contain more than two consecutive zeros. That is, there must not be more than two zeros between the last one bit in the first code and the first one bit in the second code, for any two arbitrarily chosen codes. This is required because for any RLL code, the run-length limits 0 and 2 in this case apply to the overall modulated bitstream, not just to the components of it that represent discrete sequences of plain data bits. (This rule must hold for any arbitrary pair of codes, without exception, because the input data may be any arbitrary sequence of bits.) The IBM GCR code above meets this condition, since the maximal run length of zeros at the beginning of any 5-bit code is one, and likewise the maximal run length at the end of any code is one, making a total run length of two at the junction between adjacent codes. (An example of the maximal run length occurring between codes can be seen in the example given above, where the code for the data &quot;0010&quot; ends with a zero and the code for the next data, &quot;1101&quot;, begins with a zero, forming a run of two zeros at the junction of these two 5-bit codes.)

===MFM: (1,3) RLL===
Modified frequency modulation begins to get interesting, because its special properties allow its bits to be written to a magnetic medium with twice the density of an arbitrary bit stream. There is a limit to how close in time flux transitions can be for reading equipment to detect them, and that constrains how closely bits can be recorded on the medium: In the worst case, with an arbitrary bit stream, there are two consecutive ones, which produces two consecutive flux transitions in time, so bits must be spaced far enough apart that there would be sufficient time between those flux transitions for the reader to detect them. But this code imposes a constraint of &quot;d&quot; = 1, i.e. there is a minimum of one zero between each two ones. This means that in the worst case, flux transitions are two bit times apart, so the bits can be twice as close together as with the arbitrary bit stream without exceeding the reader&#x27;s capabilities.

This doubled recording density compensates for the 1/2 coding rate of this code (it takes two bits to represent one bit of real information) and makes it equivalent to a rate-1 code.

The encoding is very similar to the FM encoding.
Where &quot;x&quot; is the complement of the stream&#x27;s previously encoded bit. 

Except for the clock bits not always being one, this is the same as the FM table, and that is how this code gets its name. The inserted clock bits are 0 except between two 0 data bits.

When combined with the previous &quot;n-1&quot; bit, the resulting encoding table for each data bit &quot;n&quot; effectively becomes.

Example:
 Data: 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0
 Encoded: x010010001010001001010010100
 Clock: x 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0

===(1,7) RLL===
(1,7) RLL maps 2 bits of data onto 3 bits on the disk, and the encoding is done in 2- or 4-bit groups. The encoding rules are: (&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;) becomes (NOT &quot;x&quot;, &quot;x&quot; AND &quot;y&quot;, NOT &quot;y&quot;), except (&quot;x&quot;, 0, 0, &quot;y&quot;) becomes (NOT &quot;x&quot;, &quot;x&quot; AND &quot;y&quot;, NOT &quot;y&quot;, 0, 0, 0).
When encoding according to the table below, the &quot;longest&quot; (last in the table) match must be used; those are exceptions handling situations where applying the earlier rules would lead to a violation of the code constraints.

Example:
 Data: 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0
 Encoded: 101 001 010 100 100 000 001

===(2,7) RLL===
(2,7) RLL is rate- code, mapping &quot;n&quot; bits of data onto 2&quot;n&quot; bits on the disk, like MFM, but because the minimal run length is 50% longer (3 bit times instead of 2), the bits can be written faster, achieving 50% higher effective data density. The encoding is done in 2-, 3- or 4-bit groups.

Seagate ST11R, IBM

Perstor Systems ADRC

The encoded forms begin with at most 4, and end with at most 3 zero bits, giving the maximal run length of 7.

Example:
 Data: 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 1
 Encoded: 1000 001000 00001000

===HHH(1,13)===
The HHH(1,13) code is a rate-2/3 code developed by three IBM researchers (Hirt, Hassner, and Heise) for use in the 16 MB/s IrDA VFIR physical layer. Unlike magnetic encoding, this is designed for an infrared transmitter, where a 0 bit represents &quot;off&quot; and a 1 bit represents &quot;on&quot;. Because 1 bits consume more power to transmit, this is designed to limit the density of 1 bits to less than 50%. In particular, it is a (1,13|5) RLL code, where the final 5 indicates the additional constraint that there are at most 5 consecutive &quot;10&quot; bit pairs.

The first eight rows describe a standard (1,7)-RLL code. The additional six exceptions increase the maximal run of zeros to 13 (in the legal pattern 100 000 000 000 001, which represents 10 11 10 11, followed by 01), but limit the maximal average ones density to . The longest run of 1–0 pairs is 000 101 010 101 000.

This code limits the ones density to between and , with an average of 25.8%.

== Examples ==
For example, let us encode the bit sequence 10110010 with different encodings

== Densities ==

Suppose a magnetic tape can contain up to 3200 flux reversals per inch. A modified frequency modulation, or (1,3) RLL encoding, stores each data bit as two bits on tape, but since there is guaranteed to be one 0 (no flux reversal) bit between any 1 (flux reversal) bits, then it is possible to store 6400 encoded bits per inch on the tape, or 3200 data bits per inch. A (1,7) RLL encoding can also store 6400 encoded bits per inch on the tape, but since it only takes 3 encoded bits to store 2 data bits, this is 4267 data bits per inch. A (2,7) RLL encoding takes 2 encoded bits to store each data bit, but since there is guaranteed to be two 0 bits between any 1 bits, then it is possible to store 9600 encoded bits per inch on the tape, or 4800 data bits per inch.

The flux-reversal densities on hard drives are significantly greater, but the same improvements in storage density are seen by using different encoding systems.

<text>Test Valley is a local government district with borough status in Hampshire, England, named after the valley of the River Test. The council is based in the borough&#x27;s largest town of Andover. The borough also contains the town of Romsey and numerous villages and surrounding rural areas. A small part of the borough at its southern end lies within the New Forest National Park, and part of the borough north of Andover lies within the North Wessex Downs, a designated Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty.

The neighbouring districts are Basingstoke and Deane, Winchester, Eastleigh, Southampton, New Forest, Wiltshire and West Berkshire.

==History==
The district was created on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, covering the area of four former districts which were all abolished at the same time:
*Andover Municipal Borough
*Andover Rural District
*Romsey Municipal Borough
*Romsey and Stockbridge Rural District
The new district was named Test Valley after the River Test which flows through the area. The district was awarded borough status on 22 October 1976, allowing the chair of the council to take the title of mayor.

==Governance==

Test Valley Borough Council provides district-level services. County-level services are provided by Hampshire County Council. The whole district is also covered by civil parishes, which form a third tier of local government.

In the part of the borough within the New Forest National Park, town planning is the responsibility of the New Forest National Park Authority. The borough council appoints one of its councillors to serve on the 22-person National Park Authority.

===Political control===
The council has been under Conservative majority control since 1999.

The first election to the council was held in 1973, initially acting as a shadow authority alongside the outgoing authorities until the new arrangements took effect on 1 April 1974. Political control since 1974 has been as follows:

===Leadership===
The role of mayor is largely ceremonial in Test Valley. Political leadership is instead provided by the leader of the council. The leaders since 1980 have been:

===Composition===
Following the 2023 election, the composition of the council was:

The next election is due in 2027.

===Elections===

Since the last boundary changes in 2019 the council has comprised 43 councillors representing 20 wards, with each ward electing one, two or three councillors. Elections are held every four years.

===Premises===

The council has its main offices at Beech Hurst in Andover. The site had previously been a large house built in the 1850s, which had been purchased in 1947 by the old Andover Borough Council to use as its headquarters. The house continued to serve as offices for Test Valley after the new council&#x27;s creation in 1974 until 1990 when it was demolished and replaced by a modern building on the same site, retaining the Beech Hurst name. The council also maintains a smaller office at the former Magistrates&#x27; Court on Church Street in Romsey. Full council meetings are held alternately at Andover Guildhall and at Crosfield Hall in Romsey.

==Geography==
Test Valley covers some of western Hampshire, stretching from boundaries with Southampton in the south to near Newbury in the north. Test Valley is a predominantly rural area. It includes part of the North Wessex Downs Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty.

The River Test is the centrepiece of the Test Valley; the river is a chalk stream of particular beauty known for its fishing, salmon and trout, which Lord Crickhowell (onetime chairman of the National Rivers Authority) said &quot;should be treated as a great work of art or music&quot;. Stockbridge is home of the Houghton Fishing Club, an exclusive fishing club founded in 1822, which meets in the Grosvenor Hotel.

==Demographics==
In December 2006, Sport England published a survey which revealed that residents of Test Valley were the 8th most active in England in sports and other fitness activities. 26.9% of the population participate at least 3 times a week for 30 minutes.

In March 2012 Test Valley was ranked 14th best rural area to live out of 119 local authority areas in Great Britain by the Halifax. This was based on factors including employment and income levels, the weather, health and life expectancy, education, crime, broadband access and other things.

==Towns and parishes==

The whole borough is covered by civil parishes. The parish councils for Andover and Romsey have declared their parishes to be towns, allowing them to take the style &quot;town council&quot;. Whilst Stockbridge is a post town it has a parish council rather than a town council. Some of the smaller parishes have a parish meeting rather than a parish council. The parishes of Frenchmoor and West Tytherley share a grouped parish council.

<doc id="449087" wikidata="Q1614775" url="?curid=449087" title="Hertsmere">
<text>Hertsmere is a local government district with borough status in Hertfordshire, England. Its council is based in Borehamwood. Other settlements in the borough include Bushey, Elstree, Radlett and Potters Bar. The borough contains several film studios, including Elstree Studios and the BBC Elstree Centre at Borehamwood. The borough borders Three Rivers, Watford, St Albans, and Welwyn Hatfield in Hertfordshire and the three north London boroughs of Harrow, Barnet and Enfield. Hertsmere is located mainly within the M25 Motorway.

==History==
Hertsmere was created on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, covering the whole area of three former districts and a single parish from a fourth district, which were all abolished at the same time:
*Aldenham parish from Watford Rural District
*Bushey Urban District
*Elstree Rural District
*Potters Bar Urban District
The Potters Bar Urban District (which coincided with the parish of South Mimms) was historically part of Middlesex, but had been transferred to Hertfordshire on 1 April 1965 when Greater London was created and Middlesex County Council abolished.

The name &quot;Hertsmere&quot; was coined for the new district by combining the common abbreviation of Hertfordshire (&quot;Herts&quot;) with &quot;mere&quot;, an archaic word for a boundary, referencing the area&#x27;s location on Hertfordshire&#x27;s border with Greater London and also the fact that it straddles the historic county boundary between Middlesex and Hertfordshire. The name is reflected in the council&#x27;s coat of arms, which shows a hart upon the battlements of a boundary wall.

The district was awarded borough status on 15 April 1977, allowing the chair of the council to take the title of mayor.

The borough was originally in the Metropolitan Police District, despite being outside the modern Greater London boundaries. It was transferred to Hertfordshire Constabulary in 2000.

==Film studios==
Hertsmere is the location of Elstree Film and TV Studios, which produces such shows as &quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot;, &quot;Who Wants To Be A Millionaire&quot;, &quot;Dancing on Ice&quot;, and was the location for the &quot;Big Brother&quot; house. The studios were bought by Hertsmere Borough Council in 1996 and are now operated via Elstree Film Studios Limited, a council-controlled company.

Hertsmere is also the location for BBC Elstree Centre, the site of &quot;EastEnders&quot;, &quot;Holby City&quot;, and formerly the home to &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;, before its move to BBC TV Centre.

The area was also home to other TV and film studios, including MGM, until this was demolished for residential development, and is now an area called Studio Way.

==Governance==


Hertfordshire has a two-tier structure of local government, with the ten district councils (including Hertsmere Borough Council) providing district-level services, and Hertfordshire County Council providing county-level services. In some areas there is an additional third tier of civil parishes.

===Political control===
The council went under no overall control at the 2023 election. Prior to that election the Conservatives had held a majority of the seats on the council since 1999. Whilst the Conservatives were still the largest party on the council, a Labour and Liberal Democrat coalition formed to take control of the council instead. Labour group leader Jeremy Newmark became leader of the council and Liberal Democrat group leader Paul Richards became deputy leader of the council.

The first elections to Hertsmere District Council were held in 1973, initially acting as a shadow authority alongside the outgoing authorities until the new arrangements took effect on 1 April 1974. Political control since 1974 has been as follows:
===Leadership===
The role of mayor is largely ceremonial in Hertsmere, and is usually held by a different councillor each year. Political leadership is instead provided by the leader of the council. The leaders since 1999 have been:

===Composition===
Following the 2023 election the composition of the council is as follows:

The next election is due to be held in 2027.

===Premises===
The council inherited offices at Rudolph Road in Bushey, Darkes Lane in Potters Bar, and Shenley Road in Borehamwood from its predecessor authorities. A new building, called Hertsmere Civic Offices, was built in 1975–1976 on Elstree Way in Borehamwood to serve as the council&#x27;s principal offices and meeting place.

==Elections==

Since the last boundary changes in 2019, the council comprises 39 councillors elected from 16 wards, each of which returns either two or three councillors. Elections for the whole council are held every four years.

===Wards===
The borough&#x27;s 16 wards are:
*Aldenham East
*Aldenham West
*Bentley Heath and The Royds
*Borehamwood Brookmeadow
*Borehamwood Cowley Hill
*Borehamwood Hillside
*Borehamwood Kenilworth
*Bushey Heath
*Bushey North
*Bushey Park
*Bushey St James
*Elstree
*Potters Bar Furzefield
*Potters Bar Oakmere
*Potters Bar Parkfield
*Shenley
===Wider politics===

Prior to 1983, the borough was included in the parliamentary constituency of Hertfordshire South. In 1983 the constituency was renamed Hertsmere, whose current MP is Oliver Dowden of the Conservative Party, who served as deputy Prime Minister from 2023 to 2024.

Until 2024, the constituency was coterminous with the district, but since the boundary changes which took effect at that election, this has no longer been the case.

All but one of the wards in Hertsmere district still belong to the constituency of the same name, but Bushey North ward in Hertsmere district is instead now part of Watford constituency, whose current MP is Matt Turmaine of the Labour Party. All but one of the wards in Hertsmere constituency are part of Hertsmere district, but the seat now also includes the Northaw &amp; Cuffley ward from Welwyn Hatfield district.

==Civic Awards==
In 2003, the Borough Council started to present a small number of Civic Awards to people who live or work in Hertsmere &#x27;in recognition of work undertaken for the benefit of residents of the Borough&#x27;.
==Parishes==

The borough contains five parishes:
*Aldenham (includes Radlett)
*Elstree and Borehamwood (Town)
*Hertsmere Meriden
*Shenley
*South Mimms and Ridge

Four of the parishes have parish councils, with Hertsmere Meriden instead having only a parish meeting. Bushey and Potters Bar are unparished areas, being directly administered by Hertsmere Borough Council.

==Demographics==
The 2011 census showed that Hertsmere was the second most Jewish local authority area in the United Kingdom, with Jews comprising one in seven residents (the area with the highest Jewish population being the London Borough of Barnet). In the 2021 census Hertsmere overtook Barnet to become the most Jewish local authority area, with Jews comprising one in every six residents. Jews form a plurality of the population in two wards of the borough, Bushey Heath and Elstree.

<text>The Borough of Broxbourne is a local government district with borough status in Hertfordshire, England. Its council is based in Cheshunt. Other settlements in the borough include Broxbourne, Hoddesdon and Waltham Cross. The eastern boundary of the district is the River Lea. The borough covers in south east Hertfordshire, and had an estimated population of 99,000 in 2021.

Much of the borough lies within the Metropolitan Green Belt which surrounds London. The western side of the borough is largely rural with extensive areas of woodland, whilst the eastern part, particularly between the A10 road and the River Lea, is generally urban. Most of the built-up parts of Broxbourne fall within the Greater London Urban Area. The Lee Valley Park lies on the borough&#x27;s eastern boundary.

The borough is twinned with the Sicilian city of Sutera.

==History==
The borough of Broxbourne was created on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, covering the area of two districts, which were both abolished at the same time:
*Cheshunt Urban District
*Hoddesdon Urban District

The new district was named Broxbourne after the old village of that name at the centre of the area. The village had been administratively part of Hoddesdon Urban District since 1935. The name Broxbourne means &quot;badger&#x27;s stream&quot;, a fact referenced in the council&#x27;s logo of a badger. The new district was awarded borough status from its creation, allowing the chair of the council to take the title of mayor.

==Governance==
Hertfordshire has a two-tier structure of local government, with the ten district councils (including Broxbourne Borough Council) providing district-level services, and Hertfordshire County Council providing county-level services.

===Political control===
The first elections to the council were held in 1973, initially acting as a shadow authority until the new arrangements took effect on 1 April 1974. The Conservatives have held a majority of the seats on the council since 1974:

===Leadership===
The role of mayor is largely ceremonial in Broxbourne, and is usually held by a different councillor each year. Political leadership is instead provided by the leader of the council. The leaders since 1983 have been:

===Composition===
Following the 2024 election the composition of the council was as follows:

The next election is due in 2026.

===Premises===
The council is based at Bishops&#x27; College on Churchgate in Cheshunt. The building had been a college for training clergy and comprised an early eighteenth century house to which substantial extensions had been added in 1810 and 1871. The college closed in 1968 and the vacant building was bought in 1972 by Cheshunt Urban District Council. The building then passed to Broxbourne Borough Council on local government reorganisation in 1974. The council added a large modern extension in 1986, which was formally opened on 10 December 1986 by Prince Edward, Duke of Kent.

==Elections==

Since the last ward boundary changes in 2012 the council has comprised 30 councillors, with the borough being divided into 10 wards each electing three councillors. Elections are held three years out of every four, electing one councillor from each ward each time. Elections to Hertfordshire County Council are held in the fourth year of the cycle when there are no borough council elections.

=== Wards ===
The borough&#x27;s wards are:

* Hoddesdon North
* Hoddesdon Town &amp; Rye Park
* Broxbourne &amp; Hoddesdon South
* Wormley &amp; Turnford
* Rosedale &amp; Bury Green
* Goffs Oak
* Cheshunt North
* Cheshunt South &amp; Theobalds
* Flamstead End
* Waltham Cross
==Arms==
==Business==
The main industrial areas of the borough are around Waltham Cross and the Essex Road area of Hoddesdon.

Park Plaza at Waltham Cross is home to the world&#x27;s largest printing plant, which produces publications for News International including &quot;The Sun&quot;, &quot;The Times&quot; and The Sun on Sunday (formerly the &quot;News of the World).&quot; Employing 200 people on a site to produce 86,000 newspapers per hour on each of its twelve printing presses (a total capacity of over 1,000,000 newspapers per hour), the plant cost £350 million and replaced the News International press in Wapping.

<text>East Hertfordshire is one of ten local government districts in Hertfordshire, England. Its council is based in Hertford, the county town of Hertfordshire. The largest town in the district is Bishop&#x27;s Stortford, and the other main towns are Ware, Buntingford and Sawbridgeworth. At the 2011 Census, the population of the district was 137,687. By area it is the largest of the ten local government districts in Hertfordshire. The district borders North Hertfordshire, Stevenage, Welwyn Hatfield and Broxbourne in Hertfordshire, and Epping Forest, Harlow and Uttlesford in Essex.

In the 2006 edition of Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;Best and Worst Places to Live in the UK&quot;, East Hertfordshire was rated the seventh-best district to live in. In 2012, East Hertfordshire came ninth in Halifax bank&#x27;s annual survey of most desirable places to live. It came first in this survey in 2020.

==History==
East Hertfordshire was created on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, covering the whole area of six former districts and most of a seventh, which were all abolished at the same time:
*Bishop&#x27;s Stortford Urban District
*Braughing Rural District
*Hertford Municipal Borough
*Hertford Rural District (except part within designated area of Stevenage New Town)
*Sawbridgeworth Urban District
*Ware Rural District
*Ware Urban District 

The new district was named East Hertfordshire, reflecting its position within the wider county.

The boundaries of East Hertfordshire have remained largely consistent since 1974, although minor alterations have been made on occasion, particularly along the eastern boundary which largely follows the River Stort to reflect the changing course of the river, and along the border with Stevenage to respond to new developments.

==Governance==
Hertfordshire has a two-tier structure of local government, with the ten district councils (including East Herts Council) providing district-level services, and Hertfordshire County Council providing county-level services.

East Herts Council is responsible for a range of local services including refuse and recycling collection, planning, building control, licensing, housing, parking and council tax collection. The council is officially called &#x27;East Hertfordshire District Council&#x27;, but its corporate branding is &#x27;East Herts Council&#x27;.

===Political control===
The council has been under no overall control since the 2023 election, being run by a Green Party and Liberal Democrats coalition, led by Green councillor Ben Crystall.

The first election to East Hertfordshire District Council was held in 1973, initially operating as a shadow authority alongside the outgoing authorities until the new system came into force on 1 April 1974. Political control since 1974 has been as follows:

===Leadership===
The role of Chairman of East Hertfordshire District Council is largely ceremonial. They preside at council meetings and act as first citizen of the district. They are chosen from the councillors but have to maintain a non-political stance, although they do have the right to exercise a casting vote in the case of a tied vote at a meeting. The role of chairman is usually held by a different councillor each year.

Political leadership is provided by the leader of the council. The leaders since 2001 have been:

===Composition===
Following the 2023 election and changes of allegiance up to December 2023 the composition of the council was:

The next elections are due to be held in 2027.

===Premises===
The council is based at Wallfields on Pegs Lane in Hertford. The original building there was a large nineteenth century house, which had been bought in 1950 by Hertford Rural District Council and converted to become its offices. It subsequently became the headquarters of East Hertfordshire District Council following local government reorganisation in 1974, and large modern extensions have subsequently been added to the original house.

==Elections==

Since the last boundary changes in 2023, there have been 50 councillors elected from 26 wards. Elections for the whole council are held every four years.

===Wards===
The 26 wards of East Hertfordshire are:

*Aston, Datchworth and Walkern
*Bishop&#x27;s Stortford All Saints
*Bishop&#x27;s Stortford Central
*Bishop&#x27;s Stortford North
*Bishop&#x27;s Stortford Parsonage
*Bishop&#x27;s Stortford South
*Bishop&#x27;s Stortford Thorley Manor
*Braughing and Standon
*Buntingford
*Great Amwell and Stansteads
*Hertford Bengeo
*Hertford Castle
*Hertford Heath and Brickendon
*Hertford Kingsmead
*Hertford Rural

*Little Hadham and The Pelhams
*Much Hadham
*Sawbridgeworth

===Wider politics===
East Hertfordshire straddles four parliamentary constituencies: Broxbourne, Hertford and Stortford, North East Hertfordshire and Stevenage.

==Parishes==
The district is entirely parished. See List of civil parishes in Hertfordshire.

==Transport==

The district contains only one motorway - a small stretch of the M11 at Bishop&#x27;s Stortford. The major roads within the district include:

A10 - (north-south) from London to Cambridge: enters after Hoddesdon, Hertfordshire, leaves before Royston dualled.

A414 - (WSW-ENE) from Welwyn to Harlow, through Hertford, where it forms the Hertford by-pass.

A602 - (SE-NW), connecting at A10 at Ware with the A1(M) at Stevenage.

A120 - (west-east) connecting the A10 at Standon with the M11 at Bishop&#x27;s Stortford.

None of the above roads are classified as trunk roads. Therefore, they are maintained by Hertfordshire County Council while responsibility for the M11 rests with National Highways.

Stansted Airport lies just outside East Hertfordshire, being in the neighbouring district of Uttlesford in Essex. Many of the district&#x27;s towns have rail services into London at King&#x27;s Cross, Moorgate, and Liverpool Street.

==Media==
In terms of television, the area is served by BBC London and ITV London with television signals received from the Crystal Palace transmitter BBC East and ITV Anglia can also be received from the Sandy Heath TV transmitter.

*BBC Three Counties Radio
*Heart Hertfordshire

The area is served by local newspaper, &quot;Hertfordshire Mercury&quot;.

==Employment==
The district&#x27;s biggest employer is the pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline, which has a research and manufacturing centre in Ware. The company also has a large research centre and office in neighbouring Stevenage.

<text>North Hertfordshire is one of ten local government districts in the county of Hertfordshire, England. Its council is based in Letchworth Garden City and the largest town is Hitchin. The district also includes the towns of Baldock and Royston and numerous villages and surrounding rural areas. Part of the district lies within the Chiltern Hills, a designated Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty.

The neighbouring districts are East Hertfordshire, Stevenage, Welwyn Hatfield, St Albans, Luton, Central Bedfordshire, South Cambridgeshire and Uttlesford.

==History==
North Hertfordshire was created on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, covering the area of five former districts, which were all abolished at the same time:
*Baldock Urban District
*Hitchin Urban District
*Hitchin Rural District
*Letchworth Urban District
*Royston Urban District

The new district was named North Hertfordshire, reflecting its position within the wider county.

==Governance==
North Hertfordshire District Council provides district-level services. County-level services are provided by Hertfordshire County Council. Much of the district is covered by civil parishes, which form a third tier of local government for their areas.

===Political control===
The council has been under no overall control since the 2019 election. Following the 2024 election the council is being run by a Labour minority administration.

The first election to North Hertfordshire District Council was held in 1973, initially operating as a shadow authority alongside the outgoing authorities until the new system came into force on 1 April 1974. Political control since 1974 has been as follows:
===Leadership===
The leaders of the council since 1974 have been:

===Composition===
Following the 2024 election the composition of the council was:

The next election is due in May 2028.

===Elections===

Since the last boundary changes in 2024, the council has comprised 51 councillors representing 25 wards, with each ward elected one, two or three councillors. Elections are held every four years.

===Premises===
When the council was created in 1974, it inherited five sets of offices from the five former authorities, spread across the four towns of Hitchin, Letchworth, Baldock and Royston. Initially the new council used the former Hitchin Rural District Council&#x27;s offices (later called Centenary House) on Grammar School Walk in Hitchin as its headquarters, with the other offices providing additional accommodation. In 1975, the year after the new council&#x27;s creation, it consolidated most of its functions into a new six-storey building called Council Offices on Gernon Road in Letchworth, designed by Tony Walker of architects Damond Lock, Grabowski and Partners. The building was formally opened on 22 July 1975 by Prince Richard, Duke of Gloucester. The council rented the building until 2013, when it purchased it for £3.6 million.

==Towns and Parishes==
North Hertfordshire contains four towns, being Baldock, Hitchin, Letchworth, and Royston. The district also borders the northern, western and southern edges of Stevenage, and some parts of the latter&#x27;s urban area lie within North Hertfordshire rather than the borough of Stevenage, notably including much of the Great Ashby area. Knebworth is a post town, but its parish council has not formally declared it a town.

North Hertfordshire contains 35 civil parishes. Six of the smaller parishes do not have parish councils, having instead a parish meeting, being those marked with asterisks(*) below. In addition, the three towns of Baldock, Hitchin, and Letchworth are unparished areas, as no successor parishes were created for those three former urban districts on their abolition in 1974. A Letchworth Garden City Parish was subsequently created in 2005, but was abolished in 2013.

==Logo==

In 2021 the council adopted a new logo of four hearts (shown in the infobox above) and the style &quot;North Herts Council&quot; instead of its full formal name of &quot;North Hertfordshire District Council&quot;. Prior to this, the council had used a logo of the initials &quot;NHDC&quot; in a green and purple square for approximately thirty years.

==Media==
In terms of television, North Hertfordshire is served by BBC East and ITV Anglia with television signals received from the Sandy Heath TV transmitter. 

Radio stations that broadcast to the area are:

<doc id="449096" wikidata="Q931180" url="?curid=449096" title="Dacorum">
<text>Dacorum is a local government district with borough status in Hertfordshire, England. The council is based in Hemel Hempstead. The borough also includes the towns of Berkhamsted and Tring and surrounding villages. The borough had a population of 155,081 in 2021. Dacorum was created in 1974 and is named after the ancient hundred of Dacorum which had covered a similar area. The borough of Dacorum is the westernmost of Hertfordshire&#x27;s ten districts. It borders St Albans, Three Rivers, Buckinghamshire and Central Bedfordshire.

==History==
In medieval Latin Dacorum signified &quot;of the Danes&quot;, in spite of the fact that it literally means &quot;of the Dacians&quot;, because at the time when the term was coined it was wrongly thought that part of the Danes were descendants of the Dacians. The name appears to reference a period in Saxon times when the area formed part of the Danelaw which covered much of what is now eastern England, although the duration and extent of Danish occupation in this area is unclear and continues to be debated by historians. In 1086, the Domesday Book records a hundred called Danais (also meaning &quot;of the Danes&quot;) and a neighbouring hundred called Tring; the two had merged into a single hundred by about 1200 which was thereafter called Dacorum. From the seventeenth century onwards, hundreds gradually declined in importance as administrative divisions, with their functions passing to other bodies such as the county courts. The final administrative functions of hundreds were extinguished in 1886.

The modern local government district of Dacorum was created on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, covering the whole area of five former districts and parts of another two, which were all abolished at the same time:
*Berkhamsted Rural District
*Berkhamsted Urban District
*Hemel Hempstead Municipal Borough
*Hemel Hempstead Rural District
*St Albans Rural District (part within designated area of Hemel Hempstead New Town only)
*Tring Urban District
*Watford Rural District (part within designated area of Hemel Hempstead New Town only)

The new district was named Dacorum after the medieval hundred, which had covered a similar area.

The district was granted borough status in 1984, allowing the chair of the council to take the title of mayor. Hemel Hempstead had maintained Charter Trustees from 1974 to 1984. The amalgamation of the former local authorities was symbolised in the seven oak leaves which surround a Tudor rose on the Dacorum coat of arms, issued in 1992.

==Governance==

Hertfordshire has a two-tier structure of local government, with the ten district councils (including Dacorum Borough Council) providing district-level services, and Hertfordshire County Council providing county-level services. In some areas there is an additional third tier of civil parishes.

===Political control===
The Liberal Democrats won a majority of the seats on the council at the 2023 election. Prior to 2023 the Conservatives had held a majority of the seats since 2003.

The first election to the council was held in 1973, initially operating as a shadow authority alongside the outgoing authorities until the new arrangements came into effect on 1 April 1974. Political control of the council since 1974 has been as follows:
===Leadership===
The role of mayor is largely ceremonial in Dacorum. Political leadership is instead provided by the leader of the council. The leaders since 1995 have been:

===Composition===
Following the 2023 election and a subsequent change of allegiance in March 2024, the composition of the council was:
The next election is due in 2027.

===Premises===
The council is based at The Forum on Marlowes in Hemel Hempstead. From the council&#x27;s creation in 1974 until 2017, the council was based at Dacorum Civic Centre, also on Marlowes in Hemel Hempstead. That building had previously been called Hemel Hempstead Town Hall, having been built for Hemel Hempstead Borough Council in 1966 to replace the Old Town Hall on High Street. On 16 January 2017 the council opened its new headquarters at The Forum, on the corner of Marlowes and Combe Street, immediately south of the Civic Centre, which was demolished shortly afterwards.
==Elections==

Since the last boundary changes in 2007 the council has comprised 51 councillors, representing 25 wards, with each ward electing one, two or three councillors. The whole council is elected together every four years.

===Wards===
The borough&#x27;s wards are:

<doc id="449098" wikidata="Q1142287" url="?curid=449098" title="Out Run">
<text>(also stylized as OutRun) is an arcade driving video game released by Sega in September 1986. It is known for its pioneering hardware and graphics, nonlinear gameplay, a selectable soundtrack with music composed by Hiroshi Kawaguchi, and the hydraulic motion simulator deluxe arcade cabinet. The goal is to avoid traffic and reach one of five destinations before time runs out.

The game was designed by Yu Suzuki, who traveled to Europe to gain inspiration for the game&#x27;s stages. Suzuki had a small team and only ten months to program the game, leaving him to do most of the work himself. The game was a critical and commercial success, becoming the highest-grossing arcade game of 1987 worldwide as well as Sega&#x27;s most successful arcade cabinet of the 1980s. It was ported to numerous video game consoles and home computers, becoming one of the best-selling video games at the time and selling millions of copies worldwide, and it spawned a number of sequels. &quot;Out Run&quot; is considered one of the most influential and greatest games ever made, cited as an influence upon numerous later video games, playing a role in the arcade video game industry&#x27;s recovery, and providing the name for a popular music genre. It spawned a series and a sequel of sorts was released, &quot;Turbo OutRun&quot; in 1989 with a real sequel, Outrun 2 released in 2003.

==Gameplay==

&quot;Out Run&quot; is a pseudo-3D driving video game in which the player controls a Ferrari Testarossa convertible from a third-person rear perspective. The camera is placed near the ground, simulating a Ferrari driver&#x27;s position and limiting the player&#x27;s view into the distance. The road curves, crests, and dips, which increases the challenge by obscuring upcoming obstacles such as traffic that the player must avoid. The object of the game is to reach the finish line against a timer. The game world is divided into multiple stages that each end in a checkpoint, and reaching the end of a stage provides more time. Near the end of each stage, the track forks to give the player a choice of routes leading to five final destinations. The destinations represent different difficulty levels and each conclude with their own ending scene, among them the Ferrari breaking down or being presented a trophy.

==Development==
During the mid-1980s, Sega experienced success in the arcades with games developed by Yu Suzuki. &quot;Hang-On&quot; was a good seller and &quot;Enduro Racer&quot; had been successful enough for Sega to consider a second production run. Both are motorcycle racing games, and &quot;Out Run&quot; was Suzuki&#x27;s chance to develop a car racing game. His original concept was to base the game on the American film &quot;The Cannonball Run&quot;, of which he was a fan. He disliked racing games where cars exploded on impact, and wanted gamers to enjoy the experience of driving and to feel &quot;superior&quot;.

Suzuki initially conceived the game&#x27;s setting across the United States, and he requested to scout various locations there. According to Suzuki&#x27;s boss, Youji Ishii, Sega president Hayao Nakayama believed the US was too unsafe, and suggested Europe as a safer option. Additionally, Suzuki concluded that the US was too &quot;large and empty&quot; for the game&#x27;s design. He scouted Europe for two weeks in a BMW 520 for ideas. This tour included Frankfurt, Monaco, Rome, the Swiss Alps, the French Riviera, Florence, and Milan. While in Monaco, Suzuki was inspired to use the Ferrari Testarossa as the playable car in the game, so when he returned to Japan he arranged for his team to find and photograph one. They took many photos of the car from every side and recorded the sound of the engine.

A small team of four programmers, a sound creator, and five graphic designers developed &quot;Out Run&quot;. Suzuki had to use only personnel that were available and not assigned to other projects at the time. As a result, Suzuki did most of the programming and planning himself, spending extra hours at the studio to complete development of the game within ten months. He believed that the most difficult part of developing the game was to make it as fun as possible, which he achieved by emphasizing the design elements of wide roads, buildings, and a radio with soundtrack selection.

Four cabinet designs were released, all of which are equipped with a steering wheel, a stick shift, and acceleration and brake pedals. Two of the cabinet designs are upright, the larger of which has force feedback in the steering wheel. The other two models are sit-down motion simulator cabinets that resemble the in-game car and use a drive motor to move the main cabinet—turning and shaking according to the onscreen action. Both models feature stereo speakers mounted behind the driver&#x27;s head. The arcade system board made specifically for the game is the Sega OutRun, based on the Sega System 16. Suzuki said that he was often unable to make games based on existing hardware and that Sega would have to create a new board. He said that his &quot;designs were always 3D from the beginning. All the calculations in the system were 3D, even from &quot;Hang-On&quot;. I calculated the position, scale, and zoom rate in 3D and converted it backwards to 2D. So I was always thinking in 3D&quot;. The game achieves its 3D effects using a sprite-scaling technique called Super Scaler technology, as used one year earlier in &quot;Hang-On&quot;. Released in September 1986, &quot;Out Run&quot;″s fast sprite-scaling and 3D motion provide a smoother experience than other contemporary arcade games.

Suzuki also set about simulating car features that were previously lacking in earlier driving games, so that being a skillful driver in real life would translate to being skillful in the game. They simulated features such as horsepower, torque, gear ratios and tire engineering close to real cars. They also added AI assistance for features that were difficult to control, such as drifting. For the drifting, they added details such as, if the car&#x27;s tires grip the road surface too closely, the car&#x27;s handling becomes too twitchy, something that wasn&#x27;t appreciated in earlier driving games.

=== Soundtrack ===
&quot;Out Run&quot;″s original score was composed by Hiroshi Kawaguchi, who had previously composed soundtracks for other games designed by Suzuki, including &quot;Hang-On&quot;. The soundtrack is similar in style to Latin and Caribbean music. Three selectable tracks are featured: &quot;Passing Breeze&quot;, &quot;Splash Wave&quot;, and &quot;Magical Sound Shower&quot;. An additional track, &quot;Last Wave&quot;, plays at the final score screen. Some of the game&#x27;s audio samples were corrupted due to one of the master ROM chips failing, and the glitch was not noticed until Sega was preparing a soundtrack box-set for the game&#x27;s 20th anniversary. The correct files were recovered from an 8-inch floppy disk, and subsequent re-releases of the game use the fixed data. Cassette tapes of the arcade soundtrack were distributed in the United Kingdom during December 1987, both with the home computer conversions and with &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; magazine. The Mega Drive port has the music tracks from the arcade, along with one exclusive new track titled &quot;Step On Beat&quot; composed by Masayoshi Ishi.

=== Ports and re-releases ===
&quot;Out Run&quot; was released for the Master System in 1987, and the Genesis in 1991. &quot;Out Run&quot; was ported to the Amstrad CPC, Commodore 64 and ZX Spectrum home computers for the European market. A conversion of &quot;Out Run&quot; was under development by Hertz for the Sharp X68000 but according to former Hertz employee Tsunetomo Sugawara, it was never released due to company management cancelling its development. A 32X version was also reportedly under development by Sega, but was never released.

Ports of the arcade game were released for Game Boy Advance via &quot;Sega Arcade Gallery&quot;, for Nintendo 3DS via the 3D Classics series on 12 March 2015, and for Nintendo Switch as part of the &quot;Sega Ages&quot; line on 9 January 2019.

==Reception==
===Commercial performance===
In Japan, &quot;Out Run&quot; topped the &quot;Game Machine&quot; charts for upright/cockpit arcade cabinets in November 1986, and remained at the top of the charts in the following month. It was Japan&#x27;s highest-grossing upright/cockpit arcade game during the latter half of 1986, and the overall seventh highest-grossing upright/cockpit arcade game of 1986. &quot;Out Run&quot; went on to become Japan&#x27;s highest-grossing arcade game of 1987. In North America, it topped the &quot;RePlay&quot; dedicated arcade game chart in February 1987, and went on to become the highest-grossing arcade game of 1987 in the United States. In the United Kingdom, the game topped London&#x27;s Electrocoin arcade charts for several months in 1987, from February through June, and was the top arcade game of the year. In Japan, it continued to rank among the annual highest-grossing dedicated arcade games for the next several years, ranking number three in 1988, number five in 1989, and number seven in 1990. In Europe, &quot;Out Run&quot; was the most popular arcade game during the late 1980s.

Sega had sold 18,000 &quot;Out Run&quot; arcade machines worldwide by early 1987, including 3,500 units in Japan, 8,000 units in the United States, and 6,500 units in Europe and Southeast Asia. By late 1987, &quot;Out Run&quot; had sold 20,000 units worldwide, earning Sega over ( adjusted for inflation) in arcade machine sales, and becoming Sega&#x27;s best-selling arcade cabinet of the 1980s. By 1994, 30,000 cabinets had been sold worldwide. Sega eventually surpassed &quot;OutRun&quot;″s arcade sales with &quot;Virtua Fighter&quot; (1993) and &quot;Virtua Fighter 2&quot; (1994).

The 8-bit computer game ports published by U.S. Gold sold over 200,000 copies within two weeks of release in the United Kingdom, and more than 250,000 by Christmas 1987, topping the UK&#x27;s Christmas 1987 chart. &quot;Out Run&quot; became the fastest-selling and best-selling computer game in the UK that year. By early March 1988, it had sold over 350,000 copies, becoming the UK&#x27;s all-time fastest-selling game up until then. In May 1988, the Atari ST version of &quot;Out Run&quot; became the first ST title to top the UK all-formats chart. The Atari ST version had sold over 25,000 copies in the UK by mid-1988.

&quot;Out Run&quot; remained on the UK charts for several years. The budget price re-release from Kixx topped the all-formats chart in November 1990, and the Commodore 64 version was at number two on the all-formats chart in March 1991. It also topped the PC Engine charts during January–February 1991. In 2020, &quot;Out Run&quot; became the second best-selling &quot;Sega Ages&quot; title in overseas markets outside of Japan (after &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot;), especially in Europe. As of 2021, the game&#x27;s various home conversions have sold millions of copies worldwide.

===Critical response and accolades===
&quot;Out Run&quot;″s arcade release received positive reviews and became one of the most popular arcade games of the year. The game won the 1987 Golden Joystick Award for Game of the Year, as well as for Arcade Game of the Year. It also won &quot;Best Visual Enhancement in a Video Game&quot; at the 1986 Amusement Players Association&#x27;s Players Choice Awards. Clare Edgeley reviewed the arcade game in both &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; and in &quot;Sinclair User&quot;, praising the graphics and the element of danger in the gameplay as well as the hydraulic motion simulator cabinet. &quot;Top Score&quot; newsletter called it &quot;the most enjoyable&quot; and &quot;realistic driving video game ever created&quot; while praising its innovative simulator cabinet, detailed visuals and stereo soundtrack. A review in &quot;Commodore User&quot; described it as &quot;a great game for driving enthusiasts&quot; and awarded it a score of 9 out of 10. Gary Penn, writing for &quot;Crash&quot; called the game &quot;highly polished&quot; and praised the attention to detail. In &quot;Your Sinclair&quot;, Peter Shaw praised its realism and described it as &quot;the most frighteningly fast road race game&quot; he had played.

&quot;Out Run&quot; was ported to numerous home consoles and computers. &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; praised the Master System release, with the writers concluding that it had &quot;all the thrill power of the arcade version&quot;. &quot;The Games Machine&quot; gave the Master System version a score of 72%, stating that the Master System version came closest to the original coin-op. Reviewers for &quot;Dragon&quot; described it as a &quot;refreshing&quot; game &quot;that provides hours of entertainment&quot;. &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; named it as the year&#x27;s best arcade translation for Sega. Reactions to the 16-bit versions were generally positive. The Atari ST version (1988) was described by &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; as &quot;far from perfect&quot;, but that it came closer to the arcade original than the other ports. The 1991 Sega Genesis version also received positive reviews, scoring 90% from French gaming magazines &quot;Joypad&quot; and &quot;Joystick&quot;, as well as an 85% from Swedish magazine &quot;Svenska Hemdatornytt&quot;.

The reception for the 8-bit personal computer ports by U.S. Gold was mixed. The ZX Spectrum version received positive scores from &quot;Your Sinclair&quot; and &quot;Sinclair User&quot;. Some reviewers at &quot;Crash&quot; expressed disappointment at the low quality in contrast to the arcade original. &quot;The Games Machine&quot; gave the Spectrum version a score of 61%, noting the machine&#x27;s technical limitations in comparison to the Master System and Commodore systems. The Commodore versions received positive to average reviews, though &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; described the Commodore 64 port as &quot;rushed&quot;. The Amstrad CPC port received a score of 8 out of 40 from &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot;, which described it as a &quot;travesty&quot;, and a 37% score from &quot;Amstrad Action&quot; where the reviewer considered it one of the worst arcade conversions ever.

&quot;Out Run&quot; was followed by various sequels, including three arcade sequels &quot;Turbo OutRun&quot; (1989), &quot;OutRunners&quot; (1993) and &quot;OutRun 2&quot; (2003), and several non-arcade sequels including &quot;Out Run 3-D&quot; (1988), &quot;Out Run Europa&quot; (1991), &quot;OutRun 2019&quot; (1993) and later &quot;OutRun 2006: Coast 2 Coast&quot; (2006). Sega also developed &quot;Rad Mobile&quot; (1991) which is similar to &quot;Out Run&quot;.

=== Influence and retrospective views ===
Former Sega arcade director Akira Nagai has credited &quot;Out Run&quot; and similar games for Sega&#x27;s arcade success in the 1980s. According to Nagai: &quot;&quot;Out Run&quot;, in particular, was really amazing for its time... Suzuki went on to make &quot;After Burner&quot; and a number of other games, but &quot;Out Run&quot; is still talked about with a special kind of wonder. With the &quot;taikan&quot; games, Sega&#x27;s arcade business, which had been Sega&#x27;s lowest performer in sales, gradually started to rise... For me personally, &quot;Hang-On&quot; and &quot;Out Run&quot; are my most memorable titles. They helped lift the arcade industry out of its slump, and created entirely new genres&quot;. The game&#x27;s title has been adopted as a name for the synthwave music genre, which is also known as &quot;outrun&quot; music, inspired by the game&#x27;s soundtrack which is selectable in-game as well as the game&#x27;s 1980s aesthetic. French musician Kavinsky named his debut album &quot;OutRun&quot; (2013) after the game.

The game has been listed among the best games of all time by &quot;Next Generation&quot;, &quot;Retro Gamer&quot;, &quot;Stuff&quot;, &quot;Time&quot;, &quot;G4&quot;, &quot;Killer List of Videogames&quot;, &quot;Yahoo!&quot;, and &quot;NowGamer&quot;. In 2017, &quot;GamesRadar+&quot; ranked the game 31st on their &quot;Best Sega Genesis/Mega Drive games of all time&quot;. Writing in &quot;1001 Video Games You Must Play Before You Die&quot;, Joao Diniz Sanches praised &quot;Out Run&quot;″s &quot;unforgettable design and expertly tuned game balance&quot;, describing the game as &quot;&quot;the&quot; consummate exhibit in an oversubscribed genre&quot; and &quot;one of the purest and most joyous experiences in video gaming&quot;. In 2015, &quot;Out Run&quot; appeared at 4th place on IGN&#x27;s list of The Top 10 Most Influential Racing Games Ever, behind &quot;Pole Position&quot;, &quot;Gran Turismo&quot; and &quot;Virtua Racing&quot;. According to Luke Reilly, traces of &quot;Out Run&quot; DNA can be found in series like &quot;Test Drive&quot;, &quot;Need for Speed&quot;, &quot;Project Gotham Racing&quot; and &quot;Burnout&quot; as well as modern racers like the &quot;Forza Horizon&quot; games and &quot;DriveClub&quot;. According to Jacopo Prisco of &quot;Wired UK&quot;, the influence of &quot;Out Run&quot; &quot;is still being felt on consoles, in music, and in movies&quot;. Along with its influence on a wide range of racing games from &quot;Need for Speed&quot; and &quot;Gran Turismo&quot; to &quot;Project Gotham Racing&quot; and &quot;Forza Horizon&quot;, the game&#x27;s selectable radio music has become commonplace in video games such as the &quot;Grand Theft Auto&quot; series as well as the choice to drive through alternate paths in racing games.

<doc id="449101" wikidata="Q1783694" url="?curid=449101" title="Partial-response maximum-likelihood">
<text>In computer data storage, partial-response maximum-likelihood (PRML) is a method for recovering the digital data from the weak analog read-back signal picked up by the head of a magnetic disk drive or tape drive. PRML was introduced to recover data more reliably or at a greater areal-density than earlier simpler schemes such as peak-detection. These advances are important because most of the digital data in the world is stored using magnetic storage on hard disk or tape drives.

Ampex introduced PRML in a tape drive in 1984. IBM introduced PRML in a disk drive in 1990 and also coined the acronym PRML. Many advances have taken place since the initial introduction. Recent read/write channels operate at much higher data-rates, are fully adaptive, and, in particular, include the ability to handle nonlinear signal distortion and non-stationary, colored, data-dependent noise (PDNP or NPML).

&quot;Partial response&quot; refers to the fact that part of the response to an individual bit may occur at one sample instant while other parts fall in other sample instants. &quot;Maximum-likelihood&quot; refers to the detector finding the bit-pattern most likely to have been responsible for the read-back waveform.

== Theoretical development ==

Partial-response was first proposed by Adam Lender in 1963. The method was generalized by Kretzmer in 1966. Kretzmer also classified the several different possible responses, for example, PR1 is duobinary and PR4 is the response used in the classical PRML. In 1970, Kobayashi and Tang recognized the value of PR4 for the magnetic recording channel.

Maximum-likelihood decoding using the eponymous Viterbi algorithm was proposed in 1967 by Andrew Viterbi as a means of decoding convolutional codes.

By 1971, Hisashi Kobayashi at IBM had recognized that the Viterbi algorithm could be applied to analog channels with inter-symbol interference and particularly to the use of PR4 in the context of Magnetic Recording (later called PRML). (The wide range of applications of the Viterbi algorithm is well described in a review paper by Dave Forney.) A simplified algorithm, based upon a difference metric, was used in the early implementations. This is due to Ferguson at Bell Labs.

== Implementation in products ==

The first two implementations were in Tape (Ampex - 1984) and then in hard disk drives (IBM - 1990). Both are significant milestones with the Ampex implementation focused on very high data-rate for a digital instrumentation recorder and IBM focused on a high level of integration and low power consumption for a mass-market HDD. In both cases, the initial equalization to PR4 response was done with analog circuitry but the Viterbi algorithm was performed with digital logic. In the tape application, PRML superseded &#x27;flat equalization&#x27;. In the HDD application, PRML superseded RLL codes with &#x27;peak detection&#x27;.

=== Tape recording ===
The first implementation of PRML was shipped in 1984 in the Ampex Digital Cassette Recording System (DCRS). The chief engineer on DCRS was Charles Coleman. The machine evolved from a 6-head, transverse-scan, digital video tape recorder. DCRS was a cassette-based, digital, instrumentation recorder capable of extended play times at very high data-rate. It became Ampex&#x27; most successful digital product.

The heads and the read/write channel ran at the (then) remarkably high data-rate of 117 Mbit/s. The PRML electronics were implemented with four 4-bit, Plessey analog-to-digital converters (A/D) and 100k ECL logic. The PRML channel outperformed a competing implementation based on &quot;Null-Zone Detection&quot;. A prototype PRML channel was implemented earlier at 20 Mbit/s on a prototype 8-inch HDD, but Ampex exited the HDD business in 1985. These implementations and their mode of operation are best described in a paper by Wood and Petersen. Petersen was granted a patent on the PRML channel but it was never leveraged by Ampex.

=== Hard disk drives ===
In 1990, IBM shipped the first PRML channel in an HDD in the IBM 0681 It was full-height 5¼-inch form-factor with up to 12 of 130 mm disks and had a maximum capacity of 857 MB.

The PRML channel for the IBM 0681 was developed in IBM Rochester lab. in Minnesota with support from the IBM Zurich Research lab. in Switzerland. A parallel R&amp;D effort at IBM San Jose did not lead directly to a product. A competing technology at the time was 17ML an example of Finite-Depth Tree-Search (FDTS).

The IBM 0681 read/write channel ran at a data-rate of 24 Mbit/s but was more highly integrated with the entire channel contained in a single 68-pin PLCC integrated circuit operating off a 5 volt supply. As well as the fixed analog equalizer, the channel boasted a simple adaptive digital &quot;cosine equalizer&quot; after the A/D to compensate for changes in radius and/or changes in the magnetic components.

=== Write precompensation ===
The presence of nonlinear transition-shift (NLTS) distortion on NRZ recording at high density and/or high data-rate was recognized in 1979. The magnitude and sources of NLTS can be identified using the &#x27;extracted dipulse&#x27; technique.

Ampex was the first to recognize the impact of NLTS on PR4. and was first to implement Write precompensation for PRML NRZ recording. &#x27;Precomp.&#x27; largely cancels the effect of NLTS. Precompensation is viewed as a necessity for a PRML system and is important enough to appear in the BIOS HDD setup although it is now handled automatically by the HDD.

== Further developments ==
=== Generalized PRML ===
PR4 is characterized by an equalization target (+1, 0, -1) in bit-response sample values or (1-D)(1+D) in polynomial notation (here, D is the delay operator referring to a one sample delay). The target (+1, +1, -1, -1) or (1-D)(1+D)^2 is called Extended PRML (or EPRML). The entire family, (1-D)(1+D)^n, was investigated by Thapar and Patel. The targets with larger n value tend to be more suited to channels with poor high-frequency response. This series of targets all have integer sample values and form an open eye-pattern (e.g. PR4 forms a ternary eye). In general, however, the target can just as readily have non-integer values. The classical approach to maximum-likelihood detection on a channel with intersymbol interference (ISI) is to equalize to a minimum-phase, whitened, matched-filter target. The complexity of the subsequent Viterbi detector increases exponentially with the target length - the number of states doubling for each 1-sample increase in target length.

=== Post-processor architecture ===
Given the rapid increase in complexity with longer targets, a post-processor architecture was proposed, firstly for EPRML. With this approach a relatively simple detector (e.g. PRML) is followed by a post-processor which examines the residual waveform error and looks for the occurrence of likely bit pattern errors. This approach was found to be valuable when it was extended to systems employing a simple parity check

=== PRML with nonlinearities and signal-dependent noise ===
As data detectors became more sophisticated, it was found important to deal with any residual signal nonlinearities as well as pattern-dependent noise (noise tends to be largest when there is a magnetic transition between bits) including changes in noise-spectrum with data-pattern. To this end, the Viterbi detector was modified such that it recognized the expected signal-level and expected noise variance associated with each bit-pattern. As a final step, the detectors were modified to include a &#x27;noise predictor filter&#x27; thus allowing each pattern to have a different noise-spectrum. Such detectors are referred to as Pattern-Dependent Noise-Prediction (PDNP) detectors or noise-predictive maximum-likelihood detectors (NPML). Such techniques have been more recently applied to digital tape recorders.

== Modern electronics ==
Although the PRML acronym is still occasionally used, advanced detectors are more complex than PRML and operate at higher data rates. The analog front-end typically includes AGC, correction for the nonlinear read-element response, and a low-pass filter with control over the high-frequency boost or cut. Equalization is done after the ADC with a digital FIR filter. (TDMR uses a 2-input, 1-output equalizer.) The detector uses the PDNP/NPML approach but the hard-decision Viterbi algorithm is replaced with a detector providing soft-outputs (additional information about the reliability of each bit). Such detectors using a soft Viterbi algorithm or BCJR algorithm are essential in iteratively decoding the low-density parity-check code used in modern HDDs. A single integrated circuit contains the entire read and write channels (including the iterative decoder) as well as all the disk control and interface functions. There are currently two suppliers: Broadcom and Marvell.

<text>is a city located in central Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan. , the city had an estimated population of 244,113 and a population density of 9000 persons per km². The total area of the city is .

==Geography==
Yamato is located approximately 40 to 50 kilometers from central Tokyo and 20 kilometers from central Yokohama. It measures 3.22 kilometers from east-to-west by 9.79 kilometers north-to-south, and is thus long and narrow orientated from north-to-south. It is located on the Sagamino Plateau (Sagamino Plateau) and has a gently sloping terrain from north to south. The height difference is 38 meters, but there are almost no hills. The highest point in the city is 90 meters above sea level at the site of the Shimotsuruma Asama Shrine, and the lowest point is 30 meters above sea level.

===Surrounding municipalities===

*Machida, Tokyo

===Climate===
Yamato has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen &quot;Cfa&quot;) characterized by warm summers and cool winters with light to no snowfall. The average annual temperature in Yamato is 14.9 °C. The average annual rainfall is 1632 mm with September as the wettest month. The temperatures are highest on average in August, at around 25.7 °C, and lowest in January, at around 4.3 °C.

==Demographics==
Per Japanese census data, the population of Yamato has grown steadily over the past 70 years.

==History==
The area around present-day Yamato city has been inhabited for thousands of years. Archaeologists have found stone tools from the Japanese Paleolithic period and ceramic shards from the Jōmon period at numerous locations in the area. It is mentioned in the &quot;Engishiki&quot; records from the Heian period. By the Kamakura period, this area became part of the Shibuya &quot;shōen&quot;. It came under control of the Ashikaga clan in the early Muromachi period and was later part of the territories of the Later Hōjō clan from Odawara. With the start of the Edo period, the area was part of the &quot;tenryō&quot; territory in Sagami Province controlled directly by the Tokugawa shogunate, but administered through various &quot;hatamoto&quot;. Under the rule of the 5th &quot;shōgun&quot;, Tokugawa Tsunayoshi, one of these &quot;hatamoto&quot;, Sakamoto Shigeharu (1630–1693) by virtue of his position as &quot;Ōmetsuke&quot; and &quot;Jisha-bugyō&quot;, exceeded 10,000 &quot;koku&quot; in income, and thus became &quot;daimyō&quot; of the newly proclaimed Fukami Domain in October 1682. However, his revenues decreased below 10,000 &quot;koku&quot; in May 1687 and the domain was suppressed.

During the cadastral reforms after the Meiji Restoration, the area of present-day Yamato became part of Kōza District, Kanagawa Prefecture. On April 1, 1889, it was administratively divided into Shibuya Village and Tsurumi Village, which later changed its name on September 25, 1891 to Yamato Village. The area was connected by rail in 1926 via the Sagami Railway and in 1929 by the Odakyu Electric Railway, leading to an increase in population. The Imperial Japanese Navy Sagamino Air Base was established in 1940. Yamato Village became Yamato Town in 1943, and Shibuya Village became Shibuya Town in 1944. However, Shibuya was dissolved in 1955, with a portion merging with nearby Fujisawa, and the remaining portion reverting to village status. That portion was merged with Yamato in 1957, which became Yamato City in 1959. In April 2000, Yamato exceeded 200,000 in population, and was proclaimed a special city with increased local autonomy.

In 2020, the city gained international attention for outlawing walking in designated areas while using a smartphone, it was the first of its kind to do so without implementing a fine or monetary penalty.

==Government==
Yamato has a mayor-council form of government with a directly elected mayor and a unicameral city council of 28 members. Yamato contributes four members to the Kanagawa Prefectural Assembly. In terms of national politics, the city is part of Kanagawa 13th district of the lower house of the Diet of Japan.

==Education==
Yamato has 19 public elementary schools and nine public middle schools operated by the city government. The city has four public high schools operated by the Kanagawa Prefectural Board of Education, and the prefecture also operates two special education schools for the handicapped. The city also has one private elementary school, one private middle school and one private high school. A private junior college, the St. Cecilia Women&#x27;s Junior College is located within Yamato.

<text>The Cuban crow (Corvus nasicus) is a crow species native to the northern Caribbean.

== Taxonomy ==
Two other Caribbean crow species, the white-necked crow (&quot;C. leucognaphalus&quot;) of Hispaniola and the Jamaican crow (&quot;C. jamaicensis&quot;), appear to be very closely related to it, sharing several key morphological features. The ancestor of the fourth and fifth species from this region, the Hispaniolan (&quot;C. palmarum&quot;) and Cuban palm crows (&quot;C. minutus&quot;), would appear to be a later arrival (at least in evolutionary terms); both species show more similarities to the fish crow (&quot;C. ossifragus&quot;) of mainland North America and two Mexican species. This is despite &quot;C. minutus&quot; being sympatric with &quot;C. nasicus&quot; on Cuba, indicating two distinct arrivals of crows onto the island, and a resulting niche differentiation, similar to &quot;C. leucognaphalus&quot; and &quot;C. palmarum&quot; on Hispaniola.
==Description==
A stocky, medium-sized ( in length) forest crow, the bill of this species is long and deep with a gentle curve towards the tip giving a large headed profile. The nasal bristles sweep forward then upward and frequently reveal the nostrils which are hidden in almost all other members of the genus &quot;Corvus&quot;. There is a patch of dark grey bare skin behind the browinsh-red eye and at the base of the lower mandible. The black plumage has a bluish-purple gloss in good light. The bill, legs and feet are black.

==Distribution and habitat==
It can be found quite commonly over most of the island of Cuba and on the nearby Isla de la Juventud, as well as the Turks and Caicos Islands, in woodland and areas that have been cleared for agriculture. It is frequently found around farms and villages where it seems to have adapted quite well to living in relatively close contact with human settlements.
==Diet==
Food consists of fruit and insects though it does appear to take human food readily and will scavenge for scraps where the opportunity arises. Large noisy flocks can be seen feeding in trees and it will also readily feed on the ground especially where grain and other seeds have been spilt or left unprotected on the surface of a field.
==Call==
The voice is quite remarkable and is rather un-crow like, with strange liquid bubbling notes and high ringing sounds produced in various combinations. It also produces a thin screeched &quot;aaaaauh&quot; that rises in inflection.
==Breeding==
The nest is built in tall trees, though little further information about breeding is recorded as yet.

<text>The Jamaican crow (Corvus jamaicensis) is a comparatively small corvid (35–38 cm in length). It shares several key morphological features with two other West Indian species, the Cuban crow (&quot;Corvus nasicus&quot;) and the white-necked crow (&quot;Corvus leucognaphalus&quot;) of Hispaniola, which are very closely related to it.

==Taxonomy==
The Jamaican crow, under the name &quot;chattering crow&quot;, was described by the English naturalists John Ray in 1713 and Hans Sloane in 1725. The Irish physician Patrick Browne used the name &quot;gabbling crow&quot; for the species in 1756. In France the naturalists Mathurin Jacques Brisson in 1760 and Comte de Buffon both used the name &quot;La corneille de la Jamaique&quot;. A binomial name was not introduced until 1788 when the German naturalist Johann Friedrich Gmelin revised and expanded Carl Linnaeus&#x27;s &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; and coined the binomial name &quot;Corvus jamaicensis&quot;. The species is monotypic: no subspecies are recognised.

==Description==
The overall appearance is sooty-grey, not at all glossy, like its relatives; though it does possess a similar dark grey patch of naked skin just behind the eye, and a smaller naked patch at the base of the bill. The bill itself is slate-grey and quite deep, tapering to a sharp point. The nasal bristles are relatively sparse usually leaving the nostrils on view. The iris is either grey-brown or red-brown, possibly depending on age. The legs and feet are black.

The voice, like its two nearest relatives, is very distinctive and consists of various jabbering and bubbling sounds (thus its common Jamaican Patois name, jabbering crow), but also a more leisurely &quot;craaa-aa&quot; and variations thereof, and somewhat of a musical burbling.

==Distribution and habitat==
As its name suggests, this species is found on the island of Jamaica, where it inhabits woodland mixed with cleared areas, and can be frequently found in larger gardens. Though primarily a bird of hill and mountain forest, it comes down to lower elevations during the dry season, where it is more likely to be seen.

==Behaviour and ecology==
===Food and feeding===
A forest crow by nature, its food requirements contain a significant proportion of fruit taken from trees, either in pairs or small groups. It also probes under bark and leaf litter for small invertebrates and lizards, and it is known to raid other birds nests of both eggs and nestlings.

===Breeding===
The nest itself is usually built in tall trees; this species may also use tree holes as a possible nesting option, although not yet recorded for this species and its breeding habits.

<text>Gravesham ( ) is a local government district with borough status in north-west Kent, England. The council is based in its largest town of Gravesend. The borough is indirectly named after Gravesend, using the form of the town&#x27;s name as it appeared in the Domesday Book of 1086. The district also contains Northfleet and a number of villages and surrounding rural areas.

Parts of the borough lie within the Kent Downs, a designated Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. The neighbouring districts are Dartford, Sevenoaks, Tonbridge and Malling, and Medway, plus Thurrock on the opposite side of the River Thames.

Gravesham is twinned with Cambrai in Hauts-de-France, France and Neumünster in Schleswig-Holstein, Germany. The Gravesham parliamentary constituency covers the same area as the borough.

==History==
The first borough in the area of modern Gravesham was &quot;Gravesend and Milton&quot;, an ancient borough which had been incorporated in 1568 by Elizabeth I. The borough had been reformed in 1836 to become a municipal borough, at which point the name was changed to just &quot;Gravesend&quot;.

The modern district was created on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, covering the whole area of two former districts and parts of a third, which were all abolished at the same time:
*Gravesend Municipal Borough
*Northfleet Urban District
*Strood Rural District (parishes of Cobham, Higham, Luddesdown, Meopham and Shorne only, rest went to Medway)
The new district was named Gravesham, using the form of Gravesend&#x27;s name which had appeared in the Domesday Book. The choice of name was not without criticism; Robert Heath Hiscock, chairman of the Gravesend Historical Society, in the foreword to his book, &#x27;A History of Gravesend&#x27; (Phillimore, 1976) wrote:
:&quot;The name Gravesham appears only in the Domesday Book, 1086, and was probably the error of a Norman scribe. It was &#x27;Gravesend&#x27; in the Domesday Monarchorum c.1100, and &#x27;Gravesende&#x27; in the Textus Roffensis c. 1100. It is strange that this &quot;clerical error&quot; should now have been adopted as the name of the new Council&quot;.

The district was granted borough status from its creation, allowing the chair of the council to take the title of mayor.

==Governance== 
Gravesham Borough Council provides district-level services. County-level services are provided by Kent County Council. The more rural parts of the borough are also covered by civil parishes, which form a third tier of local government.

===Political control===
The council has been under Labour majority control since the 2023 election.

The first election to the council was held in 1973, initially operating as a shadow authority alongside the outgoing authorities before coming into its powers on 1 April 1974. Political control of the council since 1974 has been as follows:
===Leadership===
The role of mayor is largely ceremonial in Gravesham. Political leadership is instead provided by the leader of the council. The leaders since 1996 have been:

===Elections===

Since the last boundary changes in 2023, the council has comprised 39 councillors, representing 17 wards, with each ward electing one, two or three councillors. Elections are held every four years.

The wards are:

*Chalk
*Coldharbour and Perry Street
*Denton
*Higham and Shorne
*Istead Rise, Cobham and Luddesdown
*Meopham North
*Meopham South and Vigo
*Northfleet and Springhead
*Painters Ash
*Pelham
*Riverview Park
*Rosherville
*Singlewell
*Town
*Westcourt
*Whitehill and Windmill Hill
*Woodlands
===Premises===
The council is based at Gravesham Civic Centre on Windmill Street in Gravesend, which had been built in 1966 for the old Gravesend Borough Council. The building was formally opened on 15 November 1968 by Katharine, Duchess of Kent.

==Housing and architecture==
Housing varies from mid rise to low rise, particularly in the villages. The district has 12 buildings listed in the highest category of the national grading system, Grade I, three of which are private residences:

*Gadshill Place in Higham 
*Luddesdown Court in Luddesdown
*Nurstead Court in Meopham

Cobham Hall, also in the highest architectural category, is a stately home which was formerly the seat of the Earls of Darnley: since 1965 it has been a private girls&#x27; school. Cobham Park is Grade II*-listed which is listed separately in the gardens and parklands category of classification approved by the Department of Culture, Media and Sport; and includes the remains of a Roman villa.

The other Grade I-listed buildings in the borough comprise its ancient parish churches.
Gravesham is home to the largest Sikh Gurdwara in Europe, Guru Nanak Darbar Gurdwara.

==Parishes==

The borough includes six civil parishes, covering the more rural eastern and southern parts. The more urban north-west of the borough, roughly corresponding to the combined area of the former borough of Gravesend and urban district of Northfleet, is an unparished area. The parishes are:

*Cobham
*Higham
*Luddesdown
*Meopham
*Shorne
*Vigo

<text>The dusky myzomela or dusky honeyeater (Myzomela obscura) is a small, brown bird that is a common resident of the Aru Islands, southern New Guinea and northern and eastern Australia, where there are two separated populations, one in the Top End, another from Cape York Peninsula along the east coast as far south as the New South Wales border, though the species is rare south of Rockhampton. The Moluccan myzomela (&quot;M. simplex&quot;), red-tinged myzomela (&quot;M. rubrotincta&quot;), and Biak myzomela (&quot;M. rubrobrunnea&quot;) were formerly considered conspecific, but was split as distinct species by the IOC in 2021.

Around long, dusky myzomelas are dull-coloured but active and fast moving, often hovering to take insects or nectar from flowers in the upper storey. They inhabit a wide range of habitat types, including monsoonal forests and scrubs, woodlands, swamps and almost any area near water.

Dusky myzomelas tend to be sedentary in sufficiently attractive areas, nomadic or migratory in less attractive districts, particularly in the southern part of their range.

Breeding takes place in the dry season (typically March to September). The dusky myzomela normally constructs a small, neat cup nest out of fine bark, spiderwebs, and leaves, on a well-hidden branch high over water. Its eggs are white with fine reddish spots.

<doc id="449111" wikidata="Q1584524" url="?curid=449111" title="White-necked crow">
<text>The white-necked crow (Corvus leucognaphalus) is the largest of the four Caribbean corvids. It is endemic to the island of Hispaniola (split between Haiti and the Dominican Republic); it was formerly also extant on Puerto Rico and Saint Croix in the United States Virgin Islands, but has been extirpated from both islands due to considerable forest clearance and hunting for meat.

==Taxonomy==
Two other species, the Cuban crow (&quot;C. nasicus&quot;) and the Jamaican crow (&quot;C. jamaicensis&quot;), appear to be very closely related to it, sharing several key morphological features. The ancestor of the fourth and fifth species from this region, the Hispaniolan (&quot;C. palmarum&quot;) and Cuban palm crows (&quot;C. minutus&quot;), would appear to be a later arrival (at least in evolutionary terms); both species show more similarities to the fish crow (&quot;C. ossifragus&quot;) of mainland North America and two Mexican species. This is despite &quot;C. palmarum&quot; being sympatric with the white-necked crow on Hispaniola, indicating two distinct arrivals of crows onto the island, and a resulting niche differentiation, similar to &quot;C. nasicus&quot; and the Cuban palm crow (&quot;Corvus minutus&quot;) on Cuba.

==Description==

A stocky bird, it is the largest Caribbean corvid, measuring in length. The overall appearance is black, with a bluish-purple gloss in good light; despite the name, the neck typically appears entirely black, as the namesake white is restricted to the bases of the neck feathers, rarely visible in the field. The black bill is long and deep, and curves gently downward to the tip, giving the bird a large headed appearance. The nasal bristles do not quite cover the nostrils, unlike the majority of species in this genus. There is a patch of dark grey bare skin behind the eye, and the base of the lower mandible has a bare strip of the same coloured skin. The iris is a distinctive crimson red in colour, and the legs and feet are black. It often flies high over the forest canopy and soars on thermals, unlike the palm crow, which rarely, if ever, soars.

==Distribution and habitat==
It inhabits both lowland and mid-elevation mountain forest on Hispaniola, and somewhat tolerates degraded areas used for agriculture, as well as some urban landscapes. 

==Diet==
The diet is typical of most forest crows, comprising a large amount of fruit but a degree of invertebrate food is also taken, especially when feeding young. Small vertebrate prey has also been found in the stomachs of collected birds, including small native toads and nestlings. Bird eggs are also taken when found.

==Reproduction==
The nest is always solitary and built high in a tall tree, though little else concerning their breeding has as yet been recorded.

==Voice==
The voice of the white-necked crow is quite remarkable and unusual for a corvid, described as sounding more like a parrot, and consists of a series of liquid bubbling sounds, squawking, and babbling, mixed with sweet and harsh notes, including some that sound like the common raven (&quot;Corvus corax&quot;). It has been known to imitate the crowing of roosters, as well as other sounds.

==Conservation==
It has been designated as &quot;Vulnerable&quot; by the IUCN, due to having a severely fragmented population which is mostly decreasing, and several other threats (mainly hunting for both food and as a crop pest, lack of enforcement of conservation laws, possible spread of West Nile virus, destruction of habitat for agriculture and timber, capture for the pet trade, and attacks on nest sites by the recently arrived pearly-eyed thrasher, &quot;Margarops fuscatus&quot;); the same factors that led to its extirpation on Puerto Rico and Saint Croix seem to affect the remaining populations on Hispaniola and surrounding islands.

<doc id="449116" wikidata="Q652559" url="?curid=449116" title="Borough of Swale">
<text>Swale is a local government district with borough status in Kent, England. The council is based in Sittingbourne, the borough&#x27;s largest town. The borough also contains the towns of Faversham, Queenborough and Sheerness, along with numerous villages and surrounding rural areas. It includes the Isle of Sheppey and is named after The Swale, the narrow channel which separates Sheppey from the mainland part of the borough. Some southern parts of the borough lie within the Kent Downs, a designated Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty.

The borough borders the Medway unitary authority area to the west, the Borough of Maidstone to the south-west, the Borough of Ashford to the south-east, and the City of Canterbury to the east. Under proposed reorganisation in either April 2027 or 2028 the borough will face abolition and will join with one or more adjoining councils to form a new Unitary Authority. Details of such proposals are expected in Autumn 2025.

==History==
The district was created on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972 covering the area of four former districts, which were all abolished at the same time:
*Faversham Municipal Borough
*Queenborough-in-Sheppey Municipal Borough (which covered the whole Isle of Sheppey)
*Sittingbourne and Milton Urban District
*Swale Rural District
The new district was named Swale, after the waterway which divides the mainland part of the district from the Isle of Sheppey. The district was awarded borough status on 20 January 1978, allowing the chair of the council to take the title of mayor.

==Governance==
Swale Borough Council provides district-level services. County-level services are provided by Kent County Council. Most of the borough is also covered by civil parishes, which form a third tier of local government.

===Political control===
The council has been under no overall control since 2019. Following the 2023 election a coalition of Labour, local party the Swale Independents, the Greens and an independent councillor formed the council&#x27;s administration until December 2024.

The first election to the council was held in 1973, initially operating as a shadow authority alongside the outgoing authorities before coming into its powers on 1 April 1974. Political control of the council since 1974 has been as follows:

===Leadership===
The role of Mayor of Swale is largely ceremonial. Political leadership is instead provided by the leader of the council. The leaders since 2002 have been:

===Composition===
Following the 2023 election, and subsequent by-elections and changes of allegiance up to December 2024, the composition of the council was:

One of the independent councillors sits with local party the Swale Independents as the &#x27;Swale Independents Alliance&#x27;, which formed part of the council&#x27;s administration with Labour and the Greens until December 2024. The other independent councillor does not belong to a group. The next elections are due in 2027.

===Elections===

Since the last boundary changes in 2015 the council has comprised 47 councillors representing 24 wards, with each ward electing one, two or three councillors. Elections are held every four years.

===Premises===
The council is based at Swale House on East Street in Sittingbourne.

==Economy==
Swale is a mainly rural borough, containing a high proportion of the UK&#x27;s apple, pear, cherry and plum orchards (the North Kent Fruit Belt), as well as many of its remaining hop gardens. Faversham has the Shepherd Neame brewery. Founded in 1698 it is claimed to be oldest brewery in the UK.

Sheerness is a busy port and previously produced steel. Sittingbourne has a variety of smaller industrial sites.

==Transport==
The Roman Watling Street passed through the area, as witness the straightness of the A2 main road, now by-passed by the M2 motorway.

There are two railway lines in Swale: the Chatham Main Line and the Sheerness line, which meet at .

Two adjoining bridges across The Swale link the Isle of Sheppey to the mainland: Kingsferry Bridge and the Sheppey Crossing.

In 2022, the council implemented a low-emission car club in the town of Faversham, in partnership with car sharing company Hiyacar. After a successful first year, the council expanded the Swale Car Club offering to the town of Sittingbourne.

==Media==
In terms of television, Swale is served by BBC South East and ITV Meridian (East) broadcasting from the Bluebell Hill transmitter. 

Local radio stations are:
*BBC Radio Kent on 96.7 FM
*Heart South on 103.1 FM
*SFM Radio (for Sittingbourne) on 106.9 FM
*BRFM 95.6 FM on 95.6 FM and Sheppey FM 92.2 on 92.2 FM (for the Isle of Sheppey)

Local newspapers are &quot;Sittingbourne News Extra&quot;, yourswale, and &quot;Sheerness Times Guardian&quot; that serves the Isle of Sheppey.

==Parishes==

Most of the borough is covered by civil parishes. The parish councils for Faversham, Queenborough and Sheerness take the style &quot;town council&quot;. The former Sittingbourne and Milton Urban District is an unparished area, as is the Halfway Houses area on Sheppey, being the only part of the pre-1974 borough of Queenborough-in-Sheppey not to have been subsequently added to a parish.

<doc id="449118" wikidata="Q635416" url="?curid=449118" title="Folkestone and Hythe District">
<text>Folkestone and Hythe is a local government district in Kent, England. It lies in the south-east of the county, on the coast of the English Channel. The district was formed in 1974 and was originally named Shepway after one of the ancient lathes of Kent, which had covered a similar area. The district was renamed in 2018. The council is based in Folkestone, the district&#x27;s largest town. The district also includes the towns of Hawkinge, Hythe, Lydd and New Romney, along with numerous villages and surrounding rural areas.

The North Downs hills extend into the north of the district, parts of which fall within the designated Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty of the Kent Downs. Much of the south of the district forms the low-lying Romney Marsh, an area of land partly reclaimed from the sea. The district contains the Eurotunnel Folkestone Terminal, the main interchange for road vehicles at the UK end of the Channel Tunnel.

The neighbouring districts (anti-clockwise from north-east) are Dover, Canterbury, Ashford and Rother. The latter is in East Sussex, the rest are in Kent. To the south-east is the sea.

==History==
The modern district was created on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, covering the area of six former districts, which were all abolished at the same time:
*Elham Rural District
*Folkestone Municipal Borough
*Hythe Municipal Borough
*Lydd Municipal Borough
*New Romney Municipal Borough
*Romney Marsh Rural District
The new district was originally named Shepway, after one of the lathes of Kent. The lathe had historically covered a similar, but not identical, area to the modern district; some parts from the north-east of the old lathe are in Dover District, some parts from the north-west are in Ashford Borough.
Lathes were administrative and judicial subdivisions of Kent from Anglo-Saxon times. This lathe had probably originated in the 6th century, during the Jutish colonisation, as the territory of the Limenwara people. It was originally named Lympne after the village where its courts were held, but by the 13th century the lathe&#x27;s name had been changed to Shepway. The court of Shepway, which met at Shepway Cross at Lympne, also played an important role in the administration of the Cinque Ports.

The lathes were never formally abolished, but gradually lost their administrative functions from the 17th century onwards. By the end of the 19th century they had no remaining functions.

In 2018 the council voted to change the name of the district, on the basis that the name Shepway only had limited recognition from the public and businesses. It decided to rename the district after its two largest towns, which together have nearly two thirds of the district&#x27;s population. Supporters of the change argued it would improve awareness of the area and encourage investment and regeneration. The change of name took effect on 1 April 2018. The name was already used for the Folkestone and Hythe constituency, created in 1950, which covers a similar area to the district.

==Governance==
Folkestone and Hythe District Council provides district-level services. County-level services are provided by Kent County Council. The district is also entirely covered by civil parishes, which form a third tier of local government.

===Political control===
The council has been under no overall control since 2019. Following the 2023 election a minority administration of the Green Party and Liberal Democrats formed to run the council, led by Green councillor Jim Martin.

The first election to the council was held in 1973, initially operating as a shadow authority before coming into its powers on 1 April 1974. Political control of the council since 1974 has been as follows:
===Leadership===
The leaders of the council since 1999 have been:

===Composition===
Following the 2023 election and a subsequent by-election in February 2024, the composition of the council was:
The next election is due in 2027.

===Elections===

Since the last boundary changes in 2015 the council has comprised 30 councillors representing 13 wards, with each ward electing one, two or three councillors. Elections are held every four years.

===Premises===
The council is based at the Civic Centre on Castle Hill Avenue. The building was completed in 1966 for the old Folkestone Borough Council. In 2020 the council announced that it was considering the possibility of moving to new premises, although it remains at the Civic Centre as at May 2024.

===Controversies===

==== Undeclared gifts from Lydd Airport ====
In 2011, Lydd Airport&#x27;s owners, seeking to expand the airport, gave gifts to councillors that the councillors did not declare.

==== Otterpool Park planning permission ====
Folkestone and Hythe District Council was reported to have spent over £50m up to July 2020 on a proposed housing development on the former Folkestone Racecourse site, despite the 10,000 home scheme not having planning permission. The site had been bought for £4m in 2016 by the billionaire Reuben brothers via a British Virgin Islands-registered company &#x27;Cozumel Estates&#x27; who then submitted development proposals to the council for approval, in a partnership with the council. The brothers withdrew from the scheme in 2019 and sold the site to the council for £25m in 2020. The local authority granted permission for Otterpool Park in 2023.

==Geography==
Folkestone and Hythe occupies the most southerly part of Kent. It is bounded on the north by Ashford and Canterbury Districts; on the east by Dover District and on the south by the Strait of Dover. The Romney and Walland Marshes cover a good deal of its area to the west; where the North Downs begin to reach the sea there is much more in the way of settlement. Four out of five towns in the District are located along the coast. The district area is the same size as the similarly named Folkestone &amp; Hythe parliamentary constituency, but leaves out the Saxon Shore ward from the neighbouring Borough of Ashford.

===Climate===
Climate in this area has mild differences between highs and lows, and there is adequate rainfall year-round. The Köppen Climate Classification subtype for this climate is &quot;Cfb&quot; (Marine West Coast Climate/Oceanic climate).
==Housing and architecture==

The layout of the main towns is one of Victorian streets interspersed with apartment blocks, including a few tower blocks with otherwise housing in the district formed of low-rise apartments, semi-detached, terraced or (less often) detached homes with typically smallholdings or small gardens.
The number of listed buildings in the district exceeds 200. This includes 18 churches listed in the highest grading in the national listing system (Grade I). Three castles or their bailey towers survive from the medieval period.

An examples at Grade I is Davison&#x27;s Mill, a large windmill set by a green rolling lawn.

==Economy==
In economic terms, Folkestone and Hythe is the third most deprived area in Kent, after Thanet and Swale. Like them, it has a high rate of unemployment; poor educational attainment figures; and with the majority of businesses being small operations. The major source of economy is, however, tourism. Events and venues are widely publicised.

==Media==
In terms of television, the area is served by BBC South East and ITV Meridian (East) broadcasting from the main Dover transmitter and some associated relays. 

Local radio stations are:
*BBC Radio Kent on 97.6 FM and 104.2 FM
*Heart South on 97.0 FM
*KMFM Shepway and White Cliffs Country on 96.4 FM and 106.8 FM which covers the area and the district of Dover 
*Academy FM on 105.9 FM (for Folkstone)

==Transport==
The M20 crosses the north of the District to end at Folkestone, carrying traffic from London, M25 and Maidstone to the district.

Also following the M20 is the A20 which goes by nearby villages in the district. The A20 also continues onto Dover.

The A259 south coast road starts at Folkestone via Hythe, Kent and Romney Marsh in the district to Rye, East Sussex, Hastings, Bexhill-on-Sea, Eastbourne, Brighton, Worthing, Littlehampton, Bognor Regis and Chichester to Emsworth near Portsmouth.

The A260 leaves Folkestone to the A2 for Canterbury.

The A2070 links the Romney Marsh to Ashford and the M20.

Stagecoach South East operate all local buses in the district to Dover, Canterbury, Hastings, Maidstone and Ashford. Stagecoach also run coach route 021 to London from the district on behalf of National Express.

The South Eastern Main Line and High Speed 1 both cross the district. Domestic trains are provided by Southeastern and serve the stations of Westenhanger, Sandling, Folkestone West and Folkestone Central in the district. Trains go to London Charing Cross via Ashford International and Tonbridge to the west and Ramsgate via Dover Priory to the east.

The western end of the Channel Tunnel is at Cheriton, just west of Folkestone and trains that carry cars are provided by Eurotunnel. The tunnel is accessed by the M20 and the A20. Eurostar also use the tunnel but its nearest station to the district is next door in Ashford at Ashford International.

There are no longer cross channel ferry services in the district and these are now concentrated at the Port of Dover..

The Royal Military Canal starts at Seabrook, near the sea at Sandgate, and runs through Hythe town centre and the northern edge of the Romney Marsh.

The Romney, Hythe &amp; Dymchurch Railway is a light railway that operates over almost 14 miles from Hythe to Dungeness via Dymchurch, New Romney, and some smaller intermediate stations.
Several long distance footpaths cross the District, including the Saxon Shore Way and the North Downs Way; shorter walks include the &quot;Elham Valley Walk&quot; and the &quot;Royal Military Canal Path&quot;.

Lydd Airport is also in this district which handles small passenger flights to Le Touquet in France and Cargo flights to Ostend, Belgium. The Airport is served by routes 11 and 101.
==Towns and parishes==

The whole district is divided into civil parishes. The parish councils for Folkestone, Hawkinge, Hythe, Lydd and New Romney take the style &quot;town council&quot;. Some of the smaller parishes have a parish meeting rather than a parish council.

*Acrise (M)

<text>The gray crow (Corvus tristis), formerly known as the bare-faced crow, is about the same size (42–45 cm in length) as the Eurasian carrion crow (&quot;Corvus corone&quot;) but has somewhat different proportions and quite atypical feather pigmentation during the juvenile phase for a member of this genus.

The tail feathers are relatively long and graduated and the legs are relatively short. The overall colouring of the adult bird is black with randomly bleached wing and tail feathers. A large region around the eye is quite bare of feathering and shows pinkish-white skin with the eyes a bluish-white. The bill is unusual too in being very variable, bluish on upper mandible and pinkish-white on the lower in some specimens, while on others the whole bill is pinkish white with a darker tip. The forward pointing nasal bristles so often prominent in other Corvus species are very reduced also.

The juvenile bird by comparison has remarkably pale plumage being light brown to cream, the wings, tail and primaries showing blackish-brown and fawn and the head and underparts often almost white.

The species occurs all over the huge island of New Guinea and associated offshore islands in both primary and secondary forest in both lowland and hill forest up to 1350 m.

Feeding is both on the ground and in trees taking a very wide range of items. Fruit seems to be very important making up a large percentage of the intake though small animals such as frogs and aquatic insect larvae are taken from shallow water on sand or shingle beds in rivers. When foraging through the trees the birds keep loose, noisy contact with each other and usually number between 4–8 individuals.

The voice is described as a weak sounding &#x27;ka&#x27; or a whining &#x27;caw&#x27; with other hoarse sounding notes added when excited.

<text>West Lancashire is a local government district with borough status in Lancashire, England. The council is based in Ormskirk, and the largest town is Skelmersdale. The district borders Fylde to the north, over the Ribble Estuary; South Ribble, Chorley, and Wigan to the east; St Helens and Knowsley to the south; and Sefton to the south and west.

The borough has a population of 117,400 and an area of . It is primarily rural, and the most populous settlements after Ormskirk and Skelmersdale are Burscough (9,935), Up Holland (7,578), and Tarleton (5,959). The borough council is based in Ormskirk, and there are twenty-one civil parishes.

The west of the borough contains much of the southern part of the Lancashire Plain, a low-lying region of mossland. A large lake called Martin Mere occupied much of the area until it was drained for agriculture. The northern border of the borough is the Ribble Estuary, and both it and the remnant of Martin Mere are Ramsar sites. In the east the land rises to Harrock Hill, Parbold Hill, and Ashurst Hill; the River Douglas flows west through the valley between the last two, then turns north and forms the borough boundary.

==History==
The district was created on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, covering the whole area of two former districts and parts of another two districts, all of which were abolished at the same time:
*Ormskirk Urban District
*Skelmersdale and Holland Urban District
*West Lancashire Rural District (majority of former district&#x27;s territory; remainder went to Merseyside)
*Wigan Rural District (parishes of Dalton, Parbold and Wrightington; remainder went to Greater Manchester)

In 2009 the district was awarded borough status, causing the council to change its name from West Lancashire District Council to West Lancashire Borough Council, and allowing the chairman of the council to take the title of mayor.

Proposals to divide Lancashire into three unitary authorities were put forward in 2020, which would have seen both Lancashire County Council and West Lancashire Borough Council abolished. The Government did not pursue that proposed reform, although left open the possibility of other forms of reorganisation in future.

==Governance==
West Lancashire Borough Council provides district-level services. County-level services are provided by Lancashire County Council. Parts of the district are also covered by civil parishes, which form a third tier of local government.

The council employs around 600 people, making it one of West Lancashire&#x27;s largest employers. It is responsible for the administration of various services, such as leisure, waste collection, planning permission and pest control.

===Political control===
The council has been under Labour majority control since 2023.

The first election to the council was held in 1973, initially operating as a shadow authority alongside the outgoing authorities until the new arrangements came into effect on 1 April 1974. Political control of the council since 1974 has been as follows:

===Leadership===
The role of mayor is largely ceremonial in West Lancashire. Political leadership is instead provided by the leader of the council. The leaders since 1992 have been:

===Composition===
Following the 2024 election, the composition of the council was:
The next election is due in 2026.

===Premises===
The council is based at 52 Derby Street in Ormskirk, which was originally a pair of large semi-detached Victorian houses called Beaconsfield (number 52) and Abbotsford (number 54). Beaconsfield was purchased in 1925 by West Lancashire Rural District Council, one of the modern council&#x27;s predecessors, and converted to become its headquarters, being formally opened on 30 July 1925. Abbotsford was acquired later and the building has been significantly extended to the rear.

===Elections===

Since the last boundary changes in 2023 the council has comprised 45 councillors representing 15 wards, with each ward electing three councillors. Elections are held three years out of every four, with a third of the council (one councillor for each ward) being elected each time for a four-year term. Lancashire County Council elections are held in the fourth year of the cycle when there are no borough council elections.

===Parliamentary constituencies===
The south of West Lancashire, including the towns of Burscough, Skelmersdale and Ormskirk fall under the West Lancashire constituency in the House of Commons, which has been represented by Labour Party MP Ashley Dalton since the 2023 West Lancashire by-election, whereas the north of West Lancashire falls under the South Ribble constituency, which has been represented by Conservative Party MP Katherine Fletcher since the 2019 general election.

==Geography==

Skelmersdale, a former New Town, and Ormskirk are the two main towns in the borough. These are surrounded by a patchwork of smaller settlements to the west and north.

===Civil parishes===
There are 21 civil parishes in West Lancashire. The main towns of Skelmersdale and Ormskirk are unparished areas. There is a movement to establish a town council in Skelmersdale. The parish council of Burscough takes the style &quot;town council&quot;.

All the civil parishes have a parish council, with the exception of Bispham, which has a parish meeting instead.

==Media==
In terms of television, the area is served by BBC North West and ITV Granada broadcasting from the Winter Hill transmitter.

Radio stations for the area are:
*BBC Radio Lancashire
*BBC Radio Merseyside
*Heart North West
*Smooth North West 
*Dune Radio
*Greatest Hits Radio Lancashire
*Central Radio North West
*Dune FM

Local newspaper is the &quot;Lancashire Telegraph&quot;.

==Twin towns==
West Lancashire is twinned with:
* Cergy-Pontoise, France 
* Erkrath, Germany

<text>South Ribble is a local government district with borough status in Lancashire, England. Its council is based in Leyland. The borough includes the towns and villages of Penwortham, Leyland, Farington, Farington Moss, Hutton, Longton, Walmer Bridge, Much Hoole, Coupe Green, Salmesbury, Lostock Hall, Walton-le-Dale and Bamber Bridge. Many of the built-up areas in the borough form part of the wider Preston built-up area.

The neighbouring districts are Preston, Ribble Valley, Blackburn with Darwen, Chorley, West Lancashire and Fylde.

==History==
The district was formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, covering the whole area of two former districts and parts of a third, which were abolished at the same time:
*Leyland Urban District
*Preston Rural District (parishes of Cuerdale, Farington, Hutton, Little Hoole, Longton, Much Hoole, Penwortham and Samlesbury only, rest split between Preston and Ribble Valley)
*Walton-le-Dale Urban District (which included Bamber Bridge)

The new district was named South Ribble, reflecting the fact that the River Ribble forms its northern boundary. The new district was awarded borough status from its creation, allowing the chair of the council to take the title of mayor.

==Governance==
South Ribble Borough Council provides district-level services. County-level services are provided by Lancashire County Council. Parts of the borough are covered by civil parishes, which form a third tier of local government.

===Political control===
The council has been under Labour majority control since the 2023 election, and prior to this was under a Labour leader since 2019 with a supply and confidence agreement with the Liberal Democrat Group. Previous to this the council was under Conservative control for some time, with a short period of a Labour Leader controlling a Conservative administration during a period of instability. 

The first election to the council was held in 1973, initially operating as a shadow authority alongside the outgoing authorities until coming into its powers on 1 April 1974. Since 1974 political control of the council has been as follows:
===Leadership===
The role of mayor is largely ceremonial in South Ribble. Political leadership is instead provided by the leader of the council. The leaders since 2007 have been:

===Composition===
Following the 2023 election and a subsequent change of allegiance in February 2024, the composition of the council was:

The next election is due in 2027.

===Elections===

Since the last boundary changes in 2015 the council has comprised 50 councillors representing 23 wards, with each ward electing two or three councillors. Elections are held every four years.

The borough straddles the parliamentary constituencies of Ribble Valley and South Ribble.

===Premises===
The council is based at the Civic Centre on West Paddock in Leyland. The building was built in the early 1970s for the former Leyland Urban District Council.

==Parishes==
There are eight civil parishes in the borough. The parish council for Penwortham has declared its parish to be a town, allowing it to take the style &quot;town council&quot;. The parishes of Samlesbury and Cuerdale share a grouped parish council. The former urban districts of Leyland and Walton-le-Dale are unparished areas.

The parishes are:

<text>The Borough of Fylde is a local government district with borough status in Lancashire, England. It covers part of the Fylde plain, after which it is named. The council&#x27;s headquarters are in St Annes. The borough also contains the towns of Kirkham, Lytham and Wesham and surrounding villages and rural areas.

The neighbouring districts are Blackpool, Wyre, Preston, South Ribble and West Lancashire.

==History==
The district was created on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, covering the area of three former districts, which were all abolished at the same time:
*Fylde Rural District
*Kirkham Urban District
*Lytham St Annes Municipal Borough
The district was named Fylde after the coastal plan. It was awarded borough status from its creation, allowing the chair of the council to take the title of mayor.

The coat of arms of the borough bear the motto of the former Fylde Rural District Council, &quot;Gaudeat Ager&quot; from Psalm 96: &#x27;Let the field (Fylde) be joyful&#x27; - &quot;Let Fylde Prosper&quot;. The armorial bearings comprise a complete Achievement of Arms, that is - shield, crest and helm and mantling, supporters, badge and motto. They reflect the union of the three local authorities in the area: Lytham St Annes Borough Council, Kirkham Urban District Council and Fylde Rural District Council.

==Governance==
Fylde Borough Council, which styles itself &quot;Fylde Council&quot;, provides district-level services. County-level services are provided by Lancashire County Council. Most of the borough is also covered by civil parishes, which form a third tier of local government.

===Political control===
The council has been under Conservative majority control since 2003.

The first election to the council was held in 1973, initially operating as a shadow authority alongside the outgoing authorities before coming into its powers on 1 April 1974. Political control of the council since 1974 has been as follows:

===Leadership===
The role of mayor is largely ceremonial in Fylde. Political leadership is instead provided by the leader of the council. The leaders since 2010 have been:

===Composition===
Following the 2023 election, the composition of the council was:

Of the independent councillors, eleven sit together as a group, the other three are not aligned to any group. The next election is due in 2027.

===Elections===

Since the last boundary changes in 2023 the council has comprised 37 councillors, representing 17 wards, with each ward electing one, two or three councillors. Elections are held every four years.

===Premises===
The council is based at Lytham St Annes Town Hall on South Promenade in St Annes. The building was originally a hotel called Southdown Hydro, but was bought in 1925 to serve as a town hall following the merger of the districts of St Annes and Lytham in 1922 to become Lytham St Annes.

Some council departments, including the planning department and an office of the Registrar, were previously located at the former Fylde Rural District Council offices on Derby Road in Wesham, but in 2007 the council vacated this office. It was then used by the NHS North Lancashire Primary Care Trust until around 2013. The building has since been demolished and replaced by a new housing development.

==Settlements==

===Civil parishes===

There are 15 civil parishes in Fylde. The parish councils of Kirkham, Medlar-with-Wesham and St Annes-on-the-Sea have declared their parishes to be towns, allowing them to take the style &quot;town council&quot;.

<text>Sir Norman Bishop Hartnell (12 June 1901 – 8 June 1979) was a leading British fashion designer, best known for his work for the ladies of the royal family. Hartnell gained the Royal Warrant as Dressmaker to Queen Elizabeth (later the Queen Mother) in 1940, and Royal Warrant as Dressmaker to Queen Elizabeth II in 1957. Princess Beatrice also wore a dress designed for Queen Elizabeth II by Hartnell for her wedding in 2020.

==Early life and career==

Hartnell was born in Streatham, southwest London. His parents were then publicans and owners of the Crown &amp; Sceptre, at the top of Streatham Hill. Educated at Mill Hill School, Hartnell became an undergraduate at Magdalene College, Cambridge and read Modern Languages.

Hartnell&#x27;s main interests were in performing in, and designing for, productions at Cambridge University, and first came to fashion after designing for the university&#x27;s Footlights performances whilst an undergraduate, a production which transferred to Daly&#x27;s Theatre, London. He then worked unsuccessfully for two London designers, including Lucile, whom he sued for damages when several of his drawings appeared unattributed in her weekly fashion column in the London &quot;Daily Sketch&quot;.

In 1923, Hartnell opened his own business at 10 Bruton Street, Mayfair, with the financial help of his father and first business colleague, his sister Phyllis.

The &quot;Doctor Who&quot; actor William Hartnell was his second cousin.

== 1923–1934 ==

Thanks to his Cambridge connections, Hartnell acquired a clientele of débutantes and their mothers, who desired fashionable and original designs for a busy social life centred on the London Season. Hartnell was considered by some to be a good London alternative to Parisian or older London dress houses, and the London press seized on the novelty of his youth and gender.

Although expressing the spirit of the Bright Young Things and Flappers, his designs overlaid the harder silhouettes with a fluid romanticism in detail and construction. This was most evident in Hartnell&#x27;s predilection for evening and bridal gowns, gowns for court presentations, and afternoon gowns for guests at society weddings. Hartnell&#x27;s success ensured international press coverage and a flourishing trade with those no longer content with &#x27;safe&#x27; London clothes derived from Parisian designs. Hartnell became popular with the younger stars of stage and screen, and went on to dress such leading ladies as Gladys Cooper, Elsie Randolph, Gertrude Lawrence (also a client of Edward Molyneux), Jessie Matthews, Merle Oberon, Evelyn Laye and Anna Neagle; even top French stars Alice Delysia and Mistinguett were said to be impressed by Hartnell&#x27;s designs.

Alarmed by a lack of sales, his sister Phyllis insisted that Norman cease his pre-occupation eveningwear and instead focus on creating practical day clothes. Hartnell utilised British woollen fabrics to subtle and ingenious effect; though previously sidelined by London dressmaking, the use of wool fabrics in ladies&#x27; day clothing had already successfully demonstrated in Paris by Coco Chanel, who showed a keen interest in his 1927 and 1929 collections.

Hartnell successfully emulated his British predecessor and hero Charles Frederick Worth by taking his designs to the heart of world fashion. Hartnell specialised in expensive and often lavish embroidery as an integral part of his most expensive clothes, which he also utilised to prevent exact ready-to-wear copies being made of his clothing. The Hartnell in-house embroidery workroom was the largest in London couture, and continued until his death in 1979, also producing the embroidered Christmas cards for clients and press during quiet August days, a practical form of publicity at which Hartnell was adept. The originality and intricacy of Hartnell embroideries were frequently described in the press, especially in reports of the original wedding dresses he designed for socially prominent young women during the 1920s and 1930s.

== 1934–1940 ==

By 1934, Hartnell&#x27;s success had outgrown his premises, and he moved over the road to a large Mayfair town house already provided with floors of work-rooms at the rear to Bruton Mews. The first-floor salon was the height of modernity, a glass and mirror-lined &quot;Art Moderne&quot; space designed by the innovative young architect Gerald Lacoste (1909–1983), and proved the perfect background for each new season of Hartnell designs. The interiors of the large late 18th-century town house are now preserved as one of the finest examples of art-moderne pre-war commercial design in the UK.

At the same time Hartnell moved into the new building, he acquired a weekend retreat, Lovel Dene, a Queen Anne cottage in Windsor Forest, Berkshire. The cottage was extensively re-modelled for him by Lacoste. Hartnell&#x27;s London residence, The Tower House, Park Village in West Regent&#x27;s Park, was also remodelled and furnished with a fashionable mixture of Regency and modern furniture.

In 1935, Hartnell received the first of what was to be numerous commissions from the British royal family, in designing the wedding dress and bridesmaid&#x27;s dresses for the marriage of Lady Alice Montagu Douglas Scott to Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester. The two bridesmaids were Princess Elizabeth and Princess Margaret. Both King George V and Queen Mary approved the designs, the latter also becoming a client. The Duchess of York, then a client of Elizabeth Handley-Seymour, who had made her wedding dress in 1923, accompanied her daughters to the Hartnell salon to view the fittings and met the designer for the first time.

Although Hartnell&#x27;s designs for the Duchess of Gloucester&#x27;s wedding and her trousseau achieved worldwide publicity, the death of the bride&#x27;s father and consequent period of mourning before the wedding led to what had been planned as a large state wedding, taking place at Westminster Abbey, instead being held privately in the chapel of Buckingham Palace. Hartnell regretted that his work on the designs for the occasion had been denied worldwide publicity; however, vast crowds did see the newest member of the royal family drive off from Buckingham Palace wearing a Hartnell ensemble for her honeymoon, and the seal of royal approval led to increased business for Hartnell.

For the 1937 Coronation of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth, the Queen ordered the maid of honour dresses from Hartnell, remaining loyal to Handley-Seymour for her Coronation gown. Until 1939, Hartnell received most of the Queen&#x27;s orders, and after 1946, with the exception of some country clothes, she remained a Hartnell client, even after his death. Hartnell&#x27;s ability in adapting current fashion to a personal royal style began with designs with a slimmed-down fit for day and evening wear. The new Queen was short, and her new clothes gave her height and distinction; public day-clothes usually consisted of a long or three-quarter length coat over a slim skirt, often embellished with fur trimmings or some detail around the neck. His designs for the Queen&#x27;s evening wear varied from unembellished slim dresses to evening wear embroidered with sequins and glass. There was a complete change of style apparent in designs for the grander evening occasions, when Hartnell re-introduced the crinoline to world fashion, after the King showed Hartnell the Winterhalter portraits in the Royal Collection. King George suggested that the style favoured earlier by Queen Victoria would enhance the Queen&#x27;s presence.

Wallis Simpson, subsequently the Duchess of Windsor following her marriage to Edward VIII, was also a London Hartnell client, later patronizing Mainbocher, who made her wedding dress. Bocher was a friend of Hartnell&#x27;s with whom the latter credited with sound early advice, when he showed his 1929 summer collection in Paris. Then a &quot;Vogue&quot; editor, Bocher told Hartnell that he had seldom seen so many wonderful dresses so badly made. Hartnell took his advice and employed the talented Parisian &#x27;Mamselle&#x27; Davide, reputedly the highest paid member of any London couture house, and other talented cutters, fitters and tailors to execute his designs to the highest international couture standards by the 1930s. In 1929, Hartnell showed his clothes to the international press in Paris, and the floor-length hems of his evening dresses, after a decade of rising hems, were hailed as the advent of a new fashion, copied throughout the world as evidenced by the press of the time. His clothes were so popular with the press that he opened a House in Paris in order to participate in Parisian Collection showings.

Within a decade, Hartnell again effectively changed the fashionable evening dress silhouette, when more of the crinoline dresses worn by the Queen during the State Visit to Paris in July 1938 also created a worldwide sensation viewed in the press and on news-reels. The death of the Queen&#x27;s mother, Cecilia Bowes-Lyon, before the visit resulted in court mourning and a short delay in the dates of the visit to a vital British ally, of enormous political significance at a time when Germany was threatening war in Europe. Royal mourning dictated black and shades of mauve, which meant that all the clothes utilising colour for the planned June visit had to be re-made; Hartnell&#x27;s workrooms worked long hours to create a new wardrobe in white, which Hartnell remembered had a precedent in British royal mourning protocol, and was not unknown for a younger queen.

Hartnell was decorated by the French government and his friend Christian Dior, creator of the full-skirted post-war New Look; Dior himself was not immune to the influence and romance of Hartnell&#x27;s new designs, publicly stating that whenever he thought of beautiful clothes, it was of those created by Hartnell for the 1938 State Visit, which he viewed as a young aspirant in the fashion world. The crinoline fashion for evening wear influenced fashion internationally, and French designers were quick to take up the influence of the Scottish-born Queen and the many kilted Scots soldiers in Paris for the State Visit; day clothes featuring plaids or tartans were evident in the next season&#x27;s collections of many Parisian designers.

The Queen commanded another extensive wardrobe by Hartnell for the Royal Tour of Canada and visit to North America during May and June 1939. At a critical time in world history, the visit cemented North American ties of friendship in the months before the outbreak of World War II in September 1939. The King and Queen were received with enormous acclaim by great crowds throughout the tour and visit and the dignity and charm of the Queen were undoubtedly aided by her Hartnell wardrobe; Adolf Hitler termed Queen Elizabeth &quot;the most dangerous woman in Europe&quot; on viewing film footage of the successful tour.

By 1939, largely due to Hartnell&#x27;s success, London was known as an innovative fashion centre and was often visited first by American buyers before they travelled on to Paris. Hartnell had already had substantial American sales to various shops and copyists, a lucrative source of income to all designers. Some French designers, such as Anglo-Irish Edward Molyneux and Elsa Schiaparelli, opened London houses, which had a glittering social life centred around the Court. Young British designers opened their own Houses, such as Victor Stiebel and Digby Morton, formerly at Lachasse where Hardy Amies was the designer after 1935. Peter Russell also opened his own House, and all attracted younger women. Older more staid generations still patronised the older London Houses of Handley-Seymour, Reville and the British-owned London concessions of the House of Worth and Paquin. Before Hartnell established himself, the only British designer with a worldwide reputation for originality in design and finish was Lucile, whose London house closed in 1924.

The younger members of the British royal family attracted worldwide publicity, drawing attention to Hartnell by association. Whilst it was a triumph for Hartnell to have gained Queen Mary as a client, the four young wives of her four sons created fashion news. Princess Marina, was a notable figure and a patron of Edward Molyneux in Paris. He designed her 1934 wedding dress and the bridesmaids dresses for her marriage to Queen Mary&#x27;s fourth son Prince George, Duke of Kent and when Molyneux opened his London salon, also designed by Lacoste, she became a steady client of his until he closed the business in 1950. Thereafter, she was often a Hartnell client. Hartnell would go on to receive a Royal Warrant in 1940 as Dressmaker to the Queen.

== 1940–1952 ==

During the Second World War (1939–45) Hartnell - in common with other couture designers - was subject to government trading and rationing restrictions, part of the utility scheme; apart from specific rules on the amount of fabric allowed per garment, the number of buttons, fastenings and the amount and components of embroideries were all calculated and controlled. Hartnell joined the Home Guard and sustained his career by sponsoring collections for sale to overseas buyers, competing with the Occupied French and German designers, but also a growing group of American designers. Private clients ordered new clothes within the restrictions or had existing clothes altered. This also applied to the Queen, who appeared in her own often re-worked clothes in bombed areas around the country. Hartnell received her endorsement to design clothes for the government&#x27;s Utility campaign, mass-produced by Berketex, with whom he entered a business relationship that continued into the 1950s. Through this partnership, he became the first leading mid-20th century designers to design mass-produced ready-to-wear clothing. In 1916, Lucile had shown the way during the First World War by designing an extensive line of clothes for the American catalogue retailers Sears, Roebuck.

Hartnell was among the founders of the Incorporated Society of London Fashion Designers, also known as IncSoc, established in 1942 to promote British fashion design at home and abroad. Hartnell was also commissioned to design women&#x27;s uniforms for the British army and medical corps during the war. He would go on to design service uniforms for nurses and female officers in City of London Police and the Metropolitan Police.

In 1946 Hartnell took a successful collection to South America, where his clients included Eva Peron and Magda Lupescu. In 1947, he received the Neiman Marcus Fashion Award for his influence on world fashion and in the same year created an extensive wardrobe for Queen Elizabeth to wear during the Royal Tour of South Africa in 1947, the first Royal Tour abroad since 1939. Both slimline and crinoline styles were included. In addition, Hartnell designed for the young Princess Elizabeth and Princess Margaret; Molyneux also designed some day clothes for the Princesses during this trip.

Although worried that he was too old for the job at 46, Hartnell was commanded by the Queen to create the wedding dress of Princess Elizabeth in 1947 for her marriage to Prince Philip (later the Duke of Edinburgh). With a fashionable sweetheart neckline and a full skirt, the dress was embroidered with some 10,000 seed-pearls and thousands of white beads. Hartnell also created the going-away outfit and her trousseau, becoming her main designer to be augmented by Hardy Amies in the early 1950s and appealing to whole new generation of clients.

== 1952–1979 ==
Following the early death of George VI in 1952, Hartnell was asked by Queen Elizabeth II to design her 1953 Coronation dress. Many versions were sketched by Hartnell and his new assistant Ian Thomas. These were then discussed with the Queen. At her request, the final design had the similar sweetheart neckline used for the Queen&#x27;s wedding dress in 1947, with a fuller, heavy silk skirt embellished with varied embroideries, including the depiction of the national botanical emblems of the United Kingdom and Commonwealth countries, echoing earlier Coronation dresses. The complicated construction of the supporting undergarments and frustrating hours of work involved were described by Hartnell in his autobiography; the weight of the dress made it difficult to achieve a perfect balance and lend a gentle, forward swaying motion, rather than the lurching, listing motion of the prototypes. The development of the prototypes was the work of his expert cutters and fitters, as Hartnell could not sew, although he understood construction and the handling of various fabrics.

In addition, Hartnell designed the accompanying dresses worn by the Queen&#x27;s Maids of Honour and those of all major Royal ladies in attendance, creating the necessary theatrical tableaux in Westminster Abbey. He also designed dresses for many other clients who attended the ceremony, and his summer 1953 collection of some 150 designs was named &quot;The Silver and Gold Collection&quot;, subsequently used as the title for his autobiography, illustrated largely by his assistant Ian Thomas. Thomas subsequently opened his own establishment in 1968 and together with Hardy Amies created many designs included in the wardrobes of the Queen. The Queen undertook an increasingly large number of State visits and Royal tours abroad, as well as numerous events at home, all necessitating a volume of clothing too large for just one House to devote its time to. During 1953–54, the Queen made an extensive Royal tour of most of the countries forming the British Commonwealth. The Coronation dress was worn for the opening of Parliament in several countries, and her varied wardrobe gained press and newsreel headlines internationally, not least for the cotton dresses worn and copied worldwide, many ordered from a specialist wholesale company, Horrockses. Hartnell designs were augmented by a number of gowns from Hardy Amies, her secondary designer from 1951 onwards. Most of the ladies of the royal family used Hartnell, as well as other London designers, to create their clothes for use at home and abroad.

Hartnell&#x27;s design for the wedding dress of Princess Margaret in 1960 marked the last full State occasion for which he designed an impressive tableau of dresses. It also marked the swan-song of lavish British couture. The Princess wore a multi-layered white princess line dress, totally unadorned, utilising many layers of fine silk, and requiring as much skill as the complexities of the Queen&#x27;s Coronation dress, which it echoed in outline. The Queen wore a long blue lace day dress with a bolero, echoing the design with a slight bolero jacket and a hat adorned with a single rose, reminiscent of the Princess&#x27;s full name, Margaret Rose. Victor Stiebel made the going-away outfit for the Princess and the whole wedding and departure of the couple from the Pool of London on HMY Britannia received worldwide newspaper and television publicity.

Fashion rapidly changed in the 1960s, and by the time of the Investiture of the Prince of Wales in 1969, Hartnell&#x27;s clothes for the Queen and Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother were short, simple designs, reflecting their own personal style. His royal clothes created an impeccably neat look that managed to be stylish without making an overt fashion statement. Hartnell became increasingly pre-occupied with royal orders. In this he was helped by Thomas, who left to found his own establishment in 1966, and the Japanese designer Gun&#x27;yuki Torimaru, who similarly left to create his own highly successful business.

In 1968, Hartnell was involved with the redesign of female police uniforms for the Metropolitan Police.

In 1970, Madame Somoza, first lady of Nicaragua and client, issued a postage stamp dedicated to Hartnell.&lt;ref name=&quot;NICARAGUA / FAMOSOS COUTURIERS DEL MUNDO // Hartnell - Londres /&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid-1950s, Hartnell reached the peak of his fame and the business employed some 500 people together with many others in the ancillary businesses. In common with all couture houses of the era, rising costs and changing tastes in women&#x27;s clothing were a portent of the difficult times ahead. Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, the name of Norman Hartnell was continually found in the press. Apart from designing two collections a year and maintaining his theatrical and film star links, he was adept at publicity, whether it was in creating a full evening dress of pound notes for a news-paper stunt, touring fashion shows at home and abroad or using the latest fabrics and man-made materials. Memorable evening dresses were worn by the concert pianist Eileen Joyce and TV cookery star Fanny Cradock and typified his high profile as an innovative designer, although in his sixth decade - then considered to be a great age. Hartnell designed and created collections on a smaller scale until 1979 with designs for the Queen and Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother still commanding his time and attention. The business struggled with overheads in common with all couture businesses and various merchandising ventures had some success in helping to bolster the finances. The sale of &#x27;In Love&#x27; scent and then other scents was re-introduced in 1954, followed by stockings, knitwear, costume jewellery and late in the 1960s, menswear. However, it was not enough to turn the tide of high-street youthful fashion and he even had to sell his country retreat Lovel Dene to finance the Bruton Street business.

At the time of the Queen&#x27;s Silver Jubilee in 1977, Hartnell was appointed KCVO and on arriving at Buckingham Palace was delighted to find that the Queen had deputed Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother to invest him with the honour. Prudence Glynn, the astute fashion editor then of &quot;The Times&quot; termed him &quot;The First Fashion Knight&quot; and his work as &quot;The Norman Conquest&quot;. Hartnell designed and created collections on a smaller scale until 1979.
Hartnell was buried on 15 June 1979 next to his mother and sister in the graveyard of Clayton church, West Sussex. A memorial service in London was led by the then Bishop of Southwark, Mervyn Stockwood, a friend, and was attended by many models and employees and clients, including one of his earliest from the 1920s, his lifelong supporter Barbara Cartland, and another from a time as the Deb of the Year in 1930, Margaret Whigham. Wearing a spectacular Hartnell dress, her wedding to Charles Sweeny stopped the traffic in Knightsbridge. As Margaret, Duchess of Argyll, she remained a client.

After his death, Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother remained a steadfast client, as did other older clients. In order to continue and revive the business John Tullis, a nephew of Edward Molyneux, designed for the House until the business was sold. A consortium headed by Manny Silverman, formerly of Moss Bros., acquired the company. Guest collections were designed by Gina Fratini and Murray Arbeid and the building was completely renovated under the direction of Michael Pick who brought back to life its original Art Moderne splendours. The famous glass chimney-piece forming the focal point of Lacoste&#x27;s scheme leading on from the ground floor to the first floor salon with its faceted art moderne detailed mirror cladding and pilasters was returned by the V&amp;A as the focal point of the grand mirrored salon. The house re-opened with an acclaimed collection designed by former Christian Dior designer Marc Bohan. The Gulf War and subsequent recession of the early 1990s killed the venture and the house closed its doors in 1992.

On 11 May 2005, the Norman Hartnell premises were commemorated with a blue plaque at 26 Bruton Street where he spent his working life from 1934 to 1979.

The Norman Hartnell name was acquired by Li &amp; Fung as part of an extensive London fashion portfolio which includes Hardy Amies Ltd, acquired in 2008 by Fung Capital. Hardy Amies is now owned by No.14 Savile Row, which in turn is owned by Fung Capital, the private investment holding company of the Fung family also the controlling shareholders of publicly listed Li &amp; Fung Limited and Trinity Limited. Various Norman Hartnell themed housewares have been produced and there are plans to further develop the brand.

== Personal life ==
Hartnell never married, but enjoyed a discreet and quiet life at a time when homosexual relations between men were illegal. He considered himself a confirmed bachelor, and his close friends were almost never in the public eye, nor did he ever do anything to compromise his position and business as a leading designer to both ladies of the British royal family and his aristocratic or &#x27;society&#x27; clients upon whom his success was founded. He rarely socialised with any of them. The younger Hardy Amies, fellow designer for Queen Elizabeth II, was surprised to discover how much he enjoyed his company in Paris in 1959. They were both there during the State Visit to France to view their creations being worn. Hartnell had been known to term Amies &#x27;Hardly Amiable&#x27;. In late years, long after Hartnell&#x27;s death and in a more liberal climate, Amies became known for some ad lib remarks during interviews and in explaining his business success compared to Hartnell&#x27;s near penury at the end, he more than once termed Hartnell a &#x27;soppy&#x27; or &#x27;silly old queen&#x27; whilst describing himself as a &#x27;bitchy&#x27; or &#x27;clever old queen.&#x27;

Hartnell had many women friends. His dresses were also worn by another Streatham resident of the past, ex-Tiller Girl Renee Probert-Price. A Hartnell evening ensemble features in the collection of vintage dresses inherited by Probert-Price&#x27;s great-niece following her death in 2013.

<doc id="449131" wikidata="Q894100" url="?curid=449131" title="Borough of Wyre">
<text>Wyre is a local government district with borough status on the coast of Lancashire, England. The council is based in Poulton-le-Fylde and the borough also contains the towns of Cleveleys, Fleetwood, Garstang, Preesall and Thornton, along with numerous villages and surrounding rural areas. Some of the borough&#x27;s built-up areas form part of the wider Blackpool urban area. Eastern parts of the borough lie within the Forest of Bowland, a designated Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty.

The borough is named after the River Wyre, which runs through the area and meets the sea at Fleetwood. There are no road or rail connections between the parts of the borough either side of the Wyre estuary, and it is necessary to cross the neighbouring Fylde district in order to travel between the two parts of Wyre, or else use the Wyre Estuary Ferry between Fleetwood and Knott End.

The neighbouring districts are Blackpool, Fylde, Preston, Ribble Valley and Lancaster.

==History==
The district was created on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, as a non-metropolitan district covering the territory of five former districts, which were abolished at the same time:
*Fleetwood Municipal Borough
*Garstang Rural District
*Poulton-le-Fylde Urban District
*Preesall Urban District
*Thornton-Cleveleys Urban District

The new district was named Wyre after the River Wyre. The new district was awarded borough status from its creation, allowing the chair of the council to take the title of mayor.

==Governance==
Wyre Borough Council, which styles itself &quot;Wyre Council&quot;, provides district-level services. County-level services are provided by Lancashire County Council. Much of the borough is covered by civil parishes, which form a third tier of local government.

===Political control===
The council has been under Conservative majority control since 1999.

The first election to the council was held in 1973, initially operating as a shadow authority alongside the outgoing authorities until coming into its powers on 1 April 1974. Since 1974 political control of the council has been as follows:

===Leadership===
The role of mayor is largely ceremonial in Wyre. Political leadership is instead provided by the leader of the council. The leaders since 2010 have been:

===Composition===
Following the 2023 election and a change of allegiance in June 2024, the composition of the council was:

The next election is due in 2027.

===Elections===

Since the last boundary changes in 2015 the council has comprised 50 councillors representing 24 wards, with each ward electing one, two or three councillors. Elections are held every four years.

Wyre straddles three parliamentary constituencies: Wyre and Preston North, Lancaster and Fleetwood and Blackpool North and Cleveleys.

===Premises===
The council is based at the Civic Centre on Breck Road in Poulton-le-Fylde. The building was originally a large house called Woodlands, later serving as a convalescent hospital and teacher training college before becoming the council&#x27;s headquarters in 1988.

==Towns and parishes==
Much of the borough is covered by civil parishes. The parish councils for Fleetwood, Garstang and Preesall have declared their parishes to be towns, allowing them to take the style &quot;town council&quot;. The former urban districts of Poulton-le-Fylde and Thornton-Cleveleys form an unparished area.


==Freedom of the Borough==
The following people and military units have received the Freedom of the Borough of Wyre.
* Doreen Lofthouse: 13 June 2003.
* The Duke of Lancaster&#x27;s Regiment: 12 April 2018.

<text>Ribble Valley is a local government district with borough status in Lancashire, England. Its council is based in Clitheroe, the largest town. The borough also includes the town of Longridge and numerous villages and surrounding rural areas. It is named after the River Ribble. Much of the district lies within the Forest of Bowland, a designated Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty.

The neighbouring districts are Pendle, Burnley, Hyndburn, Blackburn with Darwen, South Ribble, Preston, Wyre, Lancaster and North Yorkshire.

==History==
The district was created on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, covering the whole area of four former districts and parts of another three, which were abolished at the same time:
*Blackburn Rural District (north of Arley Brook, rest went to Blackburn)
*Bowland Rural District
*Burnley Rural District (parishes of Read and Sabden only, rest split between Burnley, Hyndburn and Pendle)
*Clitheroe Municipal Borough
*Clitheroe Rural District
*Longridge Urban District
*Preston Rural District (parishes of Dutton, Hothersall and Ribchester only, rest split between Preston and South Ribble)
The new district was named Ribble Valley after the River Ribble which flows through the area. The new district was awarded borough status from its creation, allowing the chair of the council to take the title of mayor.

The Bowland Rural District had been in the West Riding of Yorkshire prior to the reforms, whereas the other parts had all been in Lancashire. The council was granted a coat of arms in 1975, which includes both the Red Rose of Lancaster and White Rose of York, referencing the two historic counties.

The parish of Simonstone was transferred from Burnley to Ribble Valley in 1987.

==Governance==
Ribble Valley Borough Council provides district-level services. County-level services are provided by Lancashire County Council. The whole borough is covered by civil parishes, which form a third tier of local government.

===Political control===
The council has been under no overall control since the 2023 election, being led by a Conservative minority administration.

The first election to the council was held in 1973, initially operating as a shadow authority alongside the outgoing authorities before coming into its powers on 1 April 1974. Political control of the council since 1974 has been as follows:

===Leadership===
The role of mayor is largely ceremonial in Ribble Valley. Political leadership is instead provided by the leader of the council. The leaders since 1999 have been:

===Composition===
Following the 2023 election and subsequent changes of allegiance and by-elections up to July 2024, the composition of the council was:

Two of the independent councillors (both former Liberal Democrats) sit with the Greens as the &#x27;Green and Progressive Liberal Group&#x27;. The next election is due in 2027.

===Elections===

Since the last boundary changes in 2019 the council has comprised 40 councillors representing 26 wards, with each ward electing one or two councillors. Elections are held every four years.

===Premises===
The council is based at the Council Offices on Church Walk in Clitheroe, which was purpose-built for the council in 1980. The council chamber is in an adjoining building at 13 Church Street, which had been offices of the old Clitheroe Borough Council prior to the 1974 reforms.

==Local radio==

===Community radio===
Ribble Valley Radio was a community radio station based in Clitheroe, part of the new, third sector of local radio licensed by OFCOM. The project was launched in September 2004. The radio station helped six local residents into paid work within the radio sector in just three years and trained more than 100 volunteers to present and produce their own radio shows. The project was not supported by the Borough Council, which caused controversy in the area, and local newspaper the&quot;Clitheroe Advertiser and Times&quot;&#x27; held a poll which returned the result that 94% agreed that the Ribble Valley Borough Council were wrong not to fund the project and assist its long-term success. Many letters appeared in support of the project and damning the &quot;short sighted&quot; decision of the council. The whole episode brought excellent publicity and boosted the radio station&#x27;s listening figures by 400%.

MP Nigel Evans was a staunch supporter and tabled an Early Day Motion at Parliament EDM 979 calling for &quot;better resources and funding&quot; for Ribble Valley Radio and the new and emerging sector. None of this was sufficient to save the station and on 14 October 2007 Ribble Valley Radio closed, because it was unable to gain sufficient funding to apply for a licence.

A new group, known as Ribble FM, was formed in 2011 with the aim of applying for a community radio licence in the third round of licensing by Ofcom. Ribble FM was set up by The Bee founder Roy Martin and includes local directors and trustees.

==Economy==

Although Ribble Valley is the largest area of Lancashire, it also has the smallest population. The economy of Ribble Valley is mainly rural in nature, with a high proportion of jobs being in the private sector, due to BAE there is a bigger sway towards manufacturing jobs and less of a service economy when compared to the rest of Lancashire presumably due to the size of the authority and the dispersed nature of settlements. The authority also has the highest proportion of remote workers in Lancashire.

===Notable businesses===
* BAE Systems and Spirit AeroSystems at Samlesbury Aerodrome

==Freedom of the Borough==
The following people and military units have received the Freedom of the Borough of Ribble Valley.

===Military Units===
* The 14th/20th King&#x27;s Hussars: 24 August 1992.
* The King&#x27;s Royal Hussars: 2 December 1992.
* The Duke of Lancaster&#x27;s Regiment: 10 March 2011.

<text>Rossendale () is a local government district with borough status in Lancashire, England. Its council is based in Bacup and its largest town is Rawtenstall. It also includes the towns of Haslingden and Whitworth. The borough is named after the Rossendale Valley, the upper part of the River Irwell.

The neighbouring districts are Burnley, Hyndburn, Blackburn with Darwen, Bury, Bolton and Calderdale.

==Toponymy==
The name &quot;Rossendale&quot; is first recorded in 1292. A record of the name as &quot;Rocendal&quot; (1242) suggests Celtic &quot;ros&quot; &quot;moor, heath&quot;, with Old Norse dalr &quot;dale, valley&quot;, hence &quot;moor valley&quot; i.e. the valley of the River Irwell.

Rossendale is part of the Forest of Rossendale, which consists of the steep-sided valleys of the River Irwell and its tributaries, which flow from the Pennines southwards to Manchester and cut through the moorland which is characteristic of the area. It was given the designation of &quot;forest&quot; in medieval times denoting a hunting reserve.

The larger settlements grew into market towns, typically through the late Middle Ages. Farming and a cottage woollen industry developed during the reign of Henry VIII, but Rossendale&#x27;s population only really expanded during the period of the Industrial Revolution. The population of the area that would become the modern borough of Rossendale was 24,136 in 1801; in 1901 it had grown to 89,540. Its wet and damp climate are ideally suited to the development of watermills, and later to the mechanisation of the wool and cotton spinning and weaving industries in the 18th and 19th centuries. In the middle of the 19th century a felt industry developed, and from this the manufacturing of slippers so that footwear also became a major employer in the area.

The area became one of the cradles of the Industrial Revolution, and was known as &#x27;The Golden Valley&#x27;. There was great hardship among working people during this time, but many fortunes were made among the mill-owning classes. There was large-scale immigration from Ireland to find work building the railways and in the mills, which led to several instances of serious civil disturbances between the two communities. Michael Davitt, the Irish republican leader was among these immigrants, settling in Haslingden, where he received his education after losing an arm at the age of 11 in a mill accident.

The area is also notable for its quarrying, and Rossendale Flagstone was used widely throughout the country in the 19th century. The flagstones in Trafalgar Square in London were quarried in Rossendale. Upland farming is still carried out, largely of sheep but also of cattle. The history of Rossendale is well documented, largely through the efforts of the historian Chris Aspin, a specialist on the textile industry, and Derek Pilkington, whose efforts led to the preservation of Higher Mill in Helmshore, now Helmshore Mills Textile Museum.

The Whitworth Doctors were local surgeons and bone setters in the late 1700s and early 1800s whose reputation spread far and wide, so that they treated patients from throughout the country. In 1819 William Hewitt described them as &quot;the most remarkable men of their class that ever appeared in England&quot;.

R.S. Ireland (The Real Lancashire Black Pudding Co.) is based near Haslingden; a family-run business of specialist black pudding makers, using only traditional methods and with a recipe dating back to 1879. Rawtenstall has Fitzpatricks Herbal Health, this is the last remaining functioning temperance bar in England, that makes and sells its own non-alcoholic drinks, such as sarsaparilla, black beers and blood tonic.

===Administrative history===
The modern district was created on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, covering the whole area of four former districts and part of a fifth, which were abolished at the same time:
*Bacup Municipal Borough
*Haslingden Municipal Borough
*Ramsbottom Urban District (North and Walmersley cum Shuttleworth wards only, rest went to Bury)
*Rawtenstall Municipal Borough
*Whitworth Urban District

The new district was named Rossendale, referring both to the Rossendale Valley and to the associated medieval Forest of Rossendale which had covered a similar area. The new district was awarded borough status from its creation, allowing the chair of the council to take the title of mayor.

==Governance==
Rossendale Borough Council provides district-level services. County-level services are provided by Lancashire County Council. Whitworth is also a civil parish, which forms a third tier of local government in that part of the borough.

===Political control===
The first election to the council was held in 1973, initially operating as a shadow authority alongside the outgoing authorities until coming into its powers on 1 April 1974. Since 1974 political control of the council has been as follows:

===Leadership===
The role of mayor is largely ceremonial in Rossendale. Political leadership is instead provided by the leader of the council. The leaders since 2004 have been:

===Composition===
Following the 2024 election the composition of the council was:

The next election is due in 2026.

===Elections===

Since the last boundary changes in 2024 the council has comprised 30 councillors representing 10 wards, with each ward electing three councillors. Elections are held three years out of every four with a third of the council (one councillor for each ward) elected each time for a four year term of office. Lancashire County Council elections are held in the fourth year of the cycle when there are no borough council elections.

===Premises===
The council is based at The Business Centre on Futures Park in Bacup. It was built as commercial offices called the Kingfisher Business Centre in 2003. The council took some office space in the building before creating a council chamber there in 2009 and consolidating its functions at the site.

Prior to 2009 the council was based at Rawtenstall Town Hall at the corner of Bacup Road and Lord Street. It had been built in 1876 as the &quot;Exchange Club&quot; and was subsequently acquired in 1890 by the Rawtenstall Local Board (predecessor of the Rawtenstall Borough Council) for use as its offices. The building was later extended into the offices of an adjoining tramway depot.

== Transport ==
The borough is linked by the motorway network to Manchester, Burnley and Blackburn via the A56/M65 and M66 motorways.

There was once a rail link south to Manchester via Bury, but this was closed in 1966 as part of cuts following the Beeching Report. Part of the old railway reopened in 1991 as the East Lancashire Railway operating a service from Rawtenstall to Bury via Ramsbottom and Summerseat, and manned by volunteers. In September 2003 an eastbound extension from Bury to Heywood was opened.

In March 2015, it was proposed to reintroduce a rail service between Rawtenstall, Bury and Manchester. This would use the current route of the East Lancashire Heritage Railway.

The area is well served by public road transport, with bus services provided mainly by Rosso and Burnley Bus Company. These provide regular services to Burnley, Blackburn, Accrington, Bolton, Bury, Manchester and Rochdale as well as Todmorden and other local destinations.

== Education in Rossendale ==
Rossendale contains multiple secondary schools, these are:
* All Saints&#x27; Catholic High School
* Alder Grange School
* Bacup and Rawtenstall Grammar School (selective state school)
* Haslingden High School
* The Valley Leadership Academy
* Whitworth Community High School
* Rossendale School (Specialist Autism School)

In addition, there is Accrington and Rossendale College, based in Accrington.

== Media ==
In terms of television, the area is served by BBC North West and ITV Granada. Television signals are received from the Winter Hill TV transmitter.

Local radio stations are BBC Radio Lancashire on 95.5 FM, Heart North West on 105.4 FM, Capital Manchester and Lancashire on 107.0 FM, Greatest Hits Radio Lancashire on 96.5 FM, and Rossendale Radio, a community based radio station which broadcast its studios in Rawtenstall on 104.7 FM.

The area is served by local newspaper, &quot;Lancashire Telegraph&quot;.

== The arts in Rossendale ==
Rossendale is the home to a large community of artists with several painters&#x27; studios, many of which are centred on the area around Waterfoot. Rossendale&#x27;s only traditional theatre is in Bacup. The Royal Court Theatre first opened in 1893 and has a thriving Youth Theatre called The Rossendale Musical Theatre Academy. The theatre and arts centre known as &#x27;The Boo&#x27; as well as being a regular venue for family theatre shows, music and a wide range of community arts events, is the home of the Horse and Bamboo Theatre Company who specialise in visual theatre, often using distinctive puppets and masks. The painters and other artists who make up the major studios within the valley – Globe Arts, Prospect Studio, Valley Artists – along with the Boo, the Whitaker, Apna Rossendale, and individual artists now work together to open their studios and premises each year at the Rossendale Art Trail Open Studios weekend in late summer.

The first part of the Irwell Sculpture Trail runs from Deerplay, above Bacup, to Stubbins. The actress Jane Horrocks was born in Rawtenstall, Rossendale, and the composer Alan Rawsthorne was born in Haslingden. Betty Jackson, the fashion designer, is a native of Bacup.

In the 18th and 19th centuries the Larks of Dean were an unusual group of working class musicians whose music-making at the Baptist Chapel in Goodshaw Fold became an important local feature. There is also a brass band tradition as well as an amateur theatre scene. There was once over 40 bands in and around Rossendale, including the Irwell Springs Band whose fame was at a peak at the turn of the 19th century. There are currently the Haslingden and Helmshore Band, Rossendale Encore Concert Band, Goodshaw Band, Stacksteads Band, Water Band, 2nd Rossendale Scout Group Band, Whitworth Vale &amp; Healey Band, Whitworth Youth Band, Haslingden Concert Band and the Whitworth Veterans&#x27; Band. Rossendale is home to a unique dancing troupe, the Britannia Coconut Dancers, formed in the mid-19th century, and who traditionally dance along the local roads every Easter.
There has been a long tradition of dialect poetry and writing in Rossendale. Local poets have included Andrew Houston (&quot;The Rossendale Bard&quot;), Walter Hargreaves (&quot;Shepster&quot;) and Clifford Heyworth (&quot;Bill o&#x27; Bows&quot;). Waugh&#x27;s Well, above Edenfield and Cowpe, marks the spot where Edwin Waugh wrote many of his poems, and is a favourite spot for walkers – a popular activity in Rossendale that does not appear to be in decline.

The Halo is an artwork in the form of an 18m-diameter steel lattice structure supported on a tripod overlooking Haslingden, positioned to be clearly visible from the M66 and A56 approach to Lancashire. Designed by John Kennedy and selected as part of a design competition managed by RIBA Competitions which was launched in 2003. It is lit after dark using low-energy LEDs powered by an adjacent wind turbine. It is the fourth Panopticon in Lancashire. It, and the adjacent landscaped area at Top o&#x27;Slate, was opened to the public in September 2007, and was designed by John Kennedy of LandLab and engineered by Booth King Partnership.

Rossendale is also home to touring theatre company Hard Graft. Established in 1999 Hard Graft found notoriety in the UK touring non theatre venues. Their first tour was with their award-winning comedy Thick As Thieves, touring living rooms throughout the UK. They then toured 56 charity shops with Burt n Joyce turning each shop into a theatre for the evening.

== Sports and entertainment ==
Three Rossendale towns have cricket clubs in the Lancashire League – Bacup, Haslingden and Rawtenstall. The overseas professionals who are associated with the League have therefore often lived in the Rossendale Valley. For example, Everton Weekes was long associated with Bacup; Clive Lloyd with Haslingden. Edenfield Cricket Club are also associated with the Lancashire League but only participate in the leagues T/20 competition.

Rossendale rugby club for many years had been a small rugby union club playing in the lower leagues, but in recent years the club has gained two promotions to take them into Regional 1 North West. Notable players such as Daniel Collins, Dave Wood and Tim Fourie now play at the valley side.

The area&#x27;s only semi-pro non league football team are Bacup Borough F.C. who play their home games at West View and are members of the North West Counties League Division One. The area&#x27;s other major non league side Rossendale United, who played their home games at nearby Newchurch near Rawtenstall, folded in 2011. The only other semi-pro team from the Rossendale area are Ramsbottom United who play in the Northern Premier League Division One North. Previously there had been Haslingden F.C., playing at Ewood Bridge, on the outskirts of Haslingden, until they folded in 1998. Their ground was later used briefly by Stand Athletic F.C. before they vacated and moved back to Whitefield in Greater Manchester. Other clubs around the Rossendale area are all from Step 7 (Level 11) and below, and so playing in various leagues at this level – the West Lancashire Football League (Haslingden St Mary&#x27;s), East Lancashire League (Stacksteads St Joseph&#x27;s, Water FC), Lancashire Amateur League (Rossendale FC, Whitworth Valley, Valley United).

The popular comedy series, &quot;The League of Gentlemen&quot;, is apparently based upon Rossendale (and perhaps Bacup in particular), playing upon stereotypes and exaggerations of the area. Subsequently, the producers filmed in various northern towns, one of which was Bacup itself, which Jeremy Dyson (writer) and Steve Pemberton (actor) proclaimed, &quot;Bacup was the furthest we went into Lancashire. Bacup was our hot favourite, but it was too frightening – when we arrived there was this cartoon drunk with a bottle shaking his fist at us. Bacup in real life was worse than Royston Vasey&quot;.

Various towns within the Rossendale Valley were used for filming scenes of the BBC TV series &quot;Hetty Wainthropp Investigates&quot; during the 1990s.

The 1980&#x27;s BBC drama series &quot;Juliet Bravo&quot; was filmed in Rossendale with the exterior of Bacup police station serving as the fictional Hartley police station.

During autumn 2008 areas around Rossendale were used in the filming of the BBC TV series &quot;Survivors&quot; including the Airtours site and other sites in Helmshore and Bank Street in Rawtenstall.

In 2012 Rossendale featured on the ITV reality television series &quot;May the Best House Win&quot; featuring former Rossendale Radio DJ Si Carvell.

Local radio station Rossendale Radio broadcast throughout the valley from 2010, before shutting down on 5 March 2012 due to financial difficulties. It then re-launched on 22 December 2018.

The Rossendale Male Voice Choir formed in the valley in 1924.

== Settlements ==
In the 2001 census the population of Rossendale was 65,652, spread between the towns of Bacup, Haslingden, Whitworth and Rawtenstall; the villages of Crawshawbooth, Edenfield, Helmshore and Waterfoot; and as well as Britannia, Broadclough, Chatterton, Cloughfold, Cowpe, Irwell Vale, Loveclough, Newchurch, Shawforth, Stacksteads, Stubbins, Turn and Weir. The population at the 2011 Census had risen to 67,922.

=== Urban Area ===
Much of the borough forms part of the Accrington/Rossendale built-up area which extends into the neighbouring borough of Hyndburn. The Accrington/Rossendale built-up area extends from the towns of Rawtenstall and Bacup to Accrington which takes in parts of the boroughs of Hyndburn and Rossendale. The urban area was recorded at having a population of 125,059.

=== Civil parishes ===
 Whitworth is the only civil parish in Rossendale. The parish council has declared the parish to be a town, allowing it to take the style &quot;town council&quot;. The rest of the borough is an unparished area.

<text>Hyndburn is a local government district with borough status in Lancashire, England. Its council is based in Accrington, the largest town, and the borough also covers the outlying towns of Clayton-le-Moors, Great Harwood, Oswaldtwistle and Rishton. The borough was created in 1974 and takes its name from the River Hyndburn. It had a population of 80,734 at the 2011 Census. Elections to the council are held in three out of every four years, with one third of the 35 seats on the council being elected at each election. Both the Conservative and Labour parties have controlled the council at different times, as well as periods when no party has had a majority.

Hyndburn borders the boroughs of Ribble Valley to the north, Burnley to the east, Rossendale to the south, and Blackburn with Darwen to the west.

==History==
The district was created on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, as a non-metropolitan district covering the territory of six former districts, which were abolished at the same time, plus a single parish from a seventh district:
*Accrington Municipal Borough
*Altham parish from Burnley Rural District
*Church Urban District
*Clayton-le-Moors Urban District
*Great Harwood Urban District
*Oswaldtwistle Urban District
*Rishton Urban District

The new district was given the name Hyndburn, taken from the River Hyndburn which passes through the district. The new district was awarded borough status on the day that it came into being, allowing the chairman of the council to take the title of mayor.

In 2007, the council proposed changing the name from Hyndburn to &quot;Accrington and Districts&quot;, to aid recognition of the borough by those not familiar with the area. After a public consultation, the change of name did not go ahead.

==Governance==
Hyndburn Borough Council provides district-level services. County-level services are provided by Lancashire County Council. Altham is a civil parish, which forms a third tier of local government for that part of the borough.

In March 2010, Hyndburn Borough Council was voted the 10 best council in &quot;The Times&quot; &quot;Best Public Sector Places to Work&quot;. The borough also made it to &quot;The Times Best Companies Guide&quot;.

===Political control===
The council has been under no overall control since 2022. Following the 2023 election a Conservative minority administration formed.

The first election to the council was held in 1973, initially operating as a shadow authority alongside the outgoing authorities before coming into its powers on 1 April 1974. Political control of the council since 1974 has been as follows:

===Leadership===
The role of Mayor of Hyndburn is largely ceremonial, with political leadership instead provided by the leader of the council. The leaders since 1974 have been:

===Composition===
Following the 2024 election, the composition of the council was:

The next election is due in 2026.

===Elections===

Since the last boundary changes in 2002 the council has comprised 35 councillors representing 16 wards, with each ward electing two or three councillors. Elections are held three years out of every four, with roughly a third of the council elected each time for a four year term of office. Lancashire County Council elections are held in the fourth year of the cycle when there are no borough council elections.

===Premises===

The council&#x27;s main offices are at Scaitcliffe House on Ormerod Street in Accrington, being part of a converted textile mill. The council moved there in 2002. Full council meetings are usually held at Accrington Town Hall.

==Education==
There are approximately nine state secondary schools in Hyndburn. These include The Hyndburn Academy, St Christopher&#x27;s Church of England High School, Accrington Academy, Rhyddings, Mount Carmel Roman Catholic High School, The Hollins, along with Broadfield Specialist School, and North Cliffe School.

The percentage of pupils achieving 5 or more GCSEs at grades A*-C has increased from 43.7% in 2001 up to 75.9% in 2011. Absences dropped from 12,052 in 2006 to 9,545 in 2011, mainly due to schools competing.

==Geography==
The district is polycentric and is located between the larger settlements of Blackburn and Burnley. It is linked to both areas by the M65 motorway and the East Lancashire railway line.

The borough had a population of 80,734 at the 2011 census. Much of the borough forms part of the Accrington/Rossendale Built-up area as defined by the Office for National Statistics, which covers the borough and parts of the neighbouring borough of Rossendale. The Acrrington/Rossendale built-up area extends from the town of Accrington to Rawtenstall and Bacup, taking in parts of the boroughs of Hyndburn and Rossendale. The Accrington/Rossendale built-up area was recorded at having a population of 125,059 at the 2011 census.

==Mayors==
The role of mayor is usually held by a different councillor each year. They chair meetings of the full council and are expected to be politically impartial during their term of office, but they do get an additional casting vote in the event of a tie. The mayors since 1974 have been:

<doc id="449139" wikidata="Q1854245" url="?curid=449139" title="South Norfolk">
<text>South Norfolk is a local government district in Norfolk, England. The largest town is Wymondham, and the district also includes the towns of Costessey, Diss, Harleston, Hingham, Loddon and Long Stratton. The council was based in Long Stratton until 2023 when it moved to the Broadland Business Park near Norwich, in the neighbouring Broadland district, as part of a shared facility with Broadland District Council. Some of the district&#x27;s urban areas (including Costessey) form part of the Norwich built-up area. The district also includes numerous villages and surrounding rural areas. Some eastern parts of the district lie within The Broads.

The neighbouring districts are Breckland, Broadland, Norwich, Great Yarmouth, East Suffolk and Mid Suffolk.

==History==
The district was created on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, covering five former districts, which were all abolished at the same time:
*Depwade Rural District
*Diss Urban District
*Forehoe and Henstead Rural District
*Loddon Rural District
*Wymondham Urban District

The new district was named South Norfolk, reflecting its position within the wider county.

The council appointed a shared managing director with neighbouring Broadland District Council in 2018. The two councils&#x27; staff were merged in 2020 and the councils moved to a new shared building in 2023.

==Governance==
South Norfolk Council provides district-level services. County-level services are provided by Norfolk County Council. The whole district is also covered by civil parishes, which form a third tier of local government.

In the parts of the district within The Broads, town planning is the responsibility of the Broads Authority. The district council appoints one of its councillors to sit on that authority.

===Political control===
The council has been under no overall control since a by-election in May 2024. Prior to that, the council had been under Conservative majority control since 2007. The Conservatives continue to run the council, but as a minority administration.

The first election to the council was held in 1973, initially operating as a shadow authority alongside the outgoing authorities until the new arrangements took effect on 1 April 1974. Political control of the council since 1974 has been as follows:
===Leadership===
The leaders of the council since 2003 have been:

===Composition===
Following the 2023 election and subsequent by-elections up to May 2024, the composition of the council was:

The next election is due in 2027.

===Elections===

Since the last full review of boundaries in 2019 the council has comprised 46 councillors representing 26 wards with each ward electing one, two or three councillors. Elections are held every four years.

;UK Youth Parliament

Although the UK Youth Parliament is an apolitical organisation, the elections are run in a similar way to the local elections. The votes come from 11 to 18 year olds and are combined to make the decision of the next, 2 year Member of Youth Parliament. The elections are run at different times across the country; South Norfolk&#x27;s are typically in early Spring and bi-annually.

===Premises===
In 2023 the council moved to the Horizon Centre, a modern office building at the Broadland Business Park on the outskirts of Norwich (in the parish of Postwick with Witton). The council shares the building with Broadland District Council as part of their joint management and staff arrangement.
Prior to 2023 the council was based at South Norfolk House at Cygnet Court in Long Stratton, which had been purpose-built for the council and was formally opened on 26 September 1979.

==Geography==

At the time of the 2001 census, the district had an area of 909 km², with a population of 110,710 in 46,607 households.

==Towns and parishes==
The district made up of 119 civil parishes. The parish councils for Costessey, Diss, Hingham, Loddon, Long Stratton, Redenhall with Harleston, and Wymondham have declared their parishes to be towns, allowing them to take the style &quot;town council&quot;.
* Alburgh, Aldeby, Alpington, Ashby St. Mary, Ashwellthorpe and Fundenhall, Aslacton
* Barford, Barnham Broom, Bawburgh, Bedingham, Bergh Apton, Bixley, Bracon Ash, Bramerton, Brandon Parva, Coston, Runhall and Welborne, Bressingham, Brockdish, Brooke, Broome, Bunwell, Burgh St. Peter, Burston and Shimpling

== Merger ==
In October 2020, &quot;Private Eye&quot; reported a total of £594,000 was paid to two managers leaving South Norfolk council as a result of the merger of the management teams at South Norfolk and Broadland councils, which included £540,000 to outgoing chief executive Sandra Dinneen. (A further £357,000 in termination payments was to be shared between three managers leaving Broadland council due to the merger.) The councils stated these so-called &quot;golden goodbyes&quot; would save them money, as they would have fewer highly paid senior officials after they departed.

In early 2023, South Norfolk District Council and Broadland District Council moved into a joint headquarters in the Broadland Business Park near Norwich. As a result of this move, South Norfolk District Council&#x27;s headquarters no longer sits within the district. However, proponents of the move defend the decision, stating that due to the population density of the district being heavily weighted towards the greater Norwich suburbs, the new headquarters is more accessible to the majority of the district&#x27;s residents than the previous headquarters in Long Stratton.
