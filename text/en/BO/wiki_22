<text>In computing, a pizza box is a style of case design for desktop computers or network switches. Pizza box cases tend to be wide and flat, normally in height, resembling pizza delivery boxes and thus the name. This is in contrast to a tower system, whose case height is much greater than the width and has an &quot;upright&quot; appearance. In modern usage, the term &quot;pizza box&quot; is normally reserved for very flat cases with height no more than , while those taller than 2 inches are referred to as &quot;desktop&quot; cases instead.

The common setup of a pizza box system is to have the display monitor placed directly on top of the case, which serves as a podium to elevate the monitor more towards the user&#x27;s eye level, and to have other peripherals placed in front and alongside the case. Occasionally, the pizza box may be laid on its sides in a tower-like orientation.

==History==
With the tagline &quot;Who just fit mainframe power in a pizza box?&quot; in a 1991 advertisement for its Aviion Unix server products, Data General was an early adopter of the expression in advertising, returning to the theme on later occasions. However, such usage was preceded by other occurrences of the expression in print, notably Time&#x27;s 1989 coverage of Sun Microsystems and its SPARCstation 1 product. The expression was reportedly already in use as early as 1987 to refer to the profile of an expansion unit for the Digital Equipment Corporation VAXmate.

Most computers generally referred to as pizza box systems were high-end desktop systems such as Sun&#x27;s workstations of the 1990s. Other notable examples have been among the highest-performing desktop computers of their generations, including the SGI Indy, the NeXTstation, and the Amiga 1000.

The pizza box form factor was also seen in budget and lower-end lines such as the Macintosh LC family, which was popular in the education market. 
The original SPARCstation 1 design included an expansion bus technology, SBus, expressly designed for the form factor; expansion cards were small, especially in comparison to other expansion cards in use at the time such as VMEbus, and were mounted horizontally instead of vertically. PC-compatible computers in this type of case typically use the PCI expansion bus and are usually either a) limited to one or two horizontally placed expansion cards or b) require special low-profile expansion cards, shorter than the PCI cards regular PCs use.

The density of computing power and stackability of pizza box systems also made them attractive for use in data centers. Systems originally designed for desktop use were placed on shelves inside of 19-inch racks, sometimes requiring that part of their cases be cut off for them to fit. Since the late 1990s, pizza boxes have been a common form factor in office cubicles, schools, data centers or industrial applications, where desktop space, rack room and density are critical. Servers in this form factor, as well as higher-end Ethernet switches, are now designed for rack mounting. Rack mount 1U computers come in all types of configurations and depths.

The pizza box form factor for smaller personal systems and thin clients remains in use well into the 21st century, though it is increasingly being superseded by laptops, nettops or All-in-One PC designs that embed the already size-reduced computer onto the keyboard or display monitor.

<text>Épinay-sur-Orge (, literally &quot;Épinay on Orge&quot;) is a commune in the Essonne department in Île-de-France in northern France.

It is situated near Orly Airport some south of Paris on the A6 motorway. Épinay is served by two stations on different branches of line C of the RER suburban railway system: Épinay-sur-Orge and Petit-Vaux.

==Geography==
The town is located on a plateau overlooking three rivers:
*the Rouillon flows from West to East along the North side of the town and into the Yvette;
*the Yvette flows from North to South past the East of the town and into the Orge at the point where the three communes of Épinay-sur-Orge, Villemoisson-sur-Orge, and Savigny-sur-Orge meet;
*the Orge flows from West to East past the South of the town.

===Climate===

Épinay-sur-Orge has an oceanic climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Cfb&quot;). The average annual temperature in Épinay-sur-Orge is . The average annual rainfall is with December as the wettest month. The temperatures are highest on average in August, at around , and lowest in January, at around . The highest temperature ever recorded in Épinay-sur-Orge was on 12 August 2003; the coldest temperature ever recorded was on 17 January 1985.

==History==
The area of Épinay-sur-Orge was inhabited from prehistoric times. The town is first mentioned in a 9th-century document as Spinetum. Traces of habitations from the Middle Ages have been found at Breuil (in the South) and Petit Vaux (West of the present-day centre). Slowly, such clusters of building grew towards one agricultural settlement. The town was created in 1793. In May 1843, the development of the town received a boost from becoming a stop on the Paris-Orléans railway, now the main RER station. In the Franco-Prussian War, the Prussians executed 4 resistance fighters in Épinay. A monument to them is in the town cemetery. On 23 August 1944, Épinay was liberated by the &quot;group Warabiot&quot; of the 2nd armoured division (the division Leclerc) on its way from Argentan to Paris. On 21 January 1945, the city decided to rename the rue de Montlhéry, henceforth known as the rue de la Division Leclerc.

==Population==
The inhabitants of Épinay are known as &quot;Spinoliens&quot;.
==Sights==
Épinay-sur-Orge was long known for its system of market gardens, providing Parisians with fresh vegetables. The gardens were irrigated with a system of locks in the rivers. Only one of these remains. To the south-east of the town is the psychiatric hospital &quot;Vaucluse&quot;. The building was the expatriate home of a rich Irishman who left it to the Department of the Essonne in 1863 on the condition that it be turned into an &quot;asylum for the mad&quot;. Reconstruction was finished in 1865. In 1869 the hospital opened with a capacity of around 1000 patients. At that time, the town had a population of 587. Patients built the tower on the grounds, as this was considered therapeutic. There is a long history of conflict between the hospital and the town over the high water level, caused by the river locks, which eroded the land of the hospital and flooded the patients&#x27; gardens.

Another monument is the town hall, originally the palace of the Duchess Carafa de Noja. After her death in 1923, the town bought the building and surrounding park. This finally allowed the construction of a fresh water supply system (1923) and electrification (1925). The grand avenue leading towards the palace is still clearly recognizable, with cherry trees blooming in spring.

<text>The orange-crowned warbler (Leiothlypis celata) is a small songbird of the New World warbler family.

==Taxonomy==
The orange-crowned warbler was formally described in 1822 by the American zoologist Thomas Say under the binomial name &quot;Sylvia celatus&quot; from a specimen collected on an expedition from Pittsburgh to the Rocky Mountains led by Stephen Harriman Long. The specific epithet &quot;celatus&quot; is Latin and means &quot;secret&quot; or &quot;hidden&quot;. The type locality is Omaha, Nebraska. The orange-crowned warbler is now placed in the genus &quot;Leiothlypis&quot; that was introduced by the Dutch ornithologist George Sangster in 2008. The genus name is derived from the Ancient Greek λειος/&quot;leios&quot; meaning &quot;plain&quot; and θλυπις/&quot;thlupis&quot;, an unknown small bird mentioned by Aristotle.

Four subspecies are recognised:
* &quot;L. c. celata&quot; (Say, 1822) – breeds in central Alaska to south Canada, winters in Guatemala
* &quot;L. c. lutescens&quot; (Ridgway, 1872) – breeds in west Canada and west USA, winters in Guatemala
* &quot;L. c. orestera&quot; (Oberholser, 1905) – breeds in west central Canada and west central USA, winters in Mexico
* &quot;L. c. sordida&quot; (Townsend, CH, 1890) – resident in south California (southwest USA) and northwest Mexico

== Description ==

The orange-crowned warbler has olive-grey upperparts, yellowish underparts with faint streaking and a thin pointed bill. It has a faint line over each eye and a faint broken eye ring. The orange patch on the crown is usually not visible. Females and immatures are duller in colour than males. Western birds are yellower than eastern birds. Orange-crowned warblers are distinguished by their lack of wing bars, streaking on the underparts, strong face marking or bright colouring, resembling a fall Tennessee warbler and a black-throated blue warbler, both of which are also members of the New World warbler family.

The song of is a trill, descending in pitch and volume. The call is a high &quot;chip&quot;.

==Distribution and habitat==
Their breeding habitat is open shrubby areas across Canada, Alaska and the western United States. These birds migrate in the winter to the southern United States and south to Central America. Although they are quite common in the western United States, they are uncommon in the east.

==Behaviour and ecology==
===Breeding===

The nest is a small open cup well-concealed on the ground under vegetation or low in shrubs. The female builds the nest; four to six eggs are laid in a nest on the ground or in a low bush. Both parents feed the young.

===Food and feeding===
They forage actively in low shrubs, flying from perch to perch, sometimes hovering. These birds eat insects, berries and nectar.

<doc id="450670" wikidata="Q1756290" url="?curid=450670" title="Price–performance ratio">
<text>In economics, engineering, business management and marketing the price–performance ratio is often written as cost–performance, cost–benefit or capability/price (C/P), refers to a product&#x27;s ability to deliver performance, of any sort, for its price. Generally speaking, products with a lower price/performance ratio are more desirable on demand curve, excluding other factors.

Even though this term would seem to be a straightforward ratio, when price performance is improved, better, or increased, it actually refers to the performance divided by the price, in other words exactly the opposite ratio (i.e. an inverse ratio) to rank a product as having an increased price/performance.

==Examples==

===Consumer and medical products===
According to futurist Raymond Kurzweil, products start out as highly ineffective and highly expensive.

Gradually, products become more effective and cheaper until they are highly effective and almost free to buy. Some of the products that have followed this example include AIDS medications (which are now affordable compared to initial pricing), text-to-speech programs, and digital cameras. However, products that rely primarily on paper (e.g., newspapers and toilet paper) and/or fossil fuels (e.g., electricity in most countries and petroleum gasoline for automobiles) have only increased in price. 

This directly contradicts the trend of electronic gadgets like netbooks, desktop computers, and laptop computers that also have been decreasing in price. However, the prevailing inflation rate of a country or province/state may negate the plummeting costs of software, AIDS medications, and/or digital cameras in certain regions along with certain governmental policies. This has the effect of keeping costs high in certain areas while they are dramatically reduced in others. 

In theory, this means that the rich people have earlier access to highly inefficient technologies, medical treatments, and therapies (that are prototypical in nature) while the poor get access to these same products when they become more efficient and easier to manufacture several years down the road.

===Business world===
During the latter 1990s, the cost–performance ratios of the larger mainframe systems fell tremendously in comparison to a number of smaller microcomputers handling the same load. As a result, many of the older computer companies were shut down and people were put out of work. However, most of them were able to be re-hired at the newer corporations after undergoing a series of re-training involving the newer technologies.

In the business world, there is usually a value associated with a typical cost–performance ratio analysis. This value can either be positive, neutral, or negative depending on the amount of money spent versus the results achieved by the spending of the available capital. A cost-performance ratio with a positive value (i.e. greater than 1) indicates that costs are running under budget. A negative value (i.e. less than 1) indicates that costs are running over budget. However, a neutral cost-performance ratio (between 1.0 and 1.9) could suggest a certain degree of stagnation in the budget. Business trips can also be factored into the cost–performance ratio because spending $50 to do a journey spanning in two hours is a better cost–performance ratio than spending $105 to do the journey in one hour.

===Computer technology===
The term tends to be used quite a bit when comparing computer hardware. During the latter 1990s, the price–performance ratios of midrange and large mainframe systems fell tremendously in comparison to a number of smaller microcomputers handling the same load. Many companies were forced out of the industry as this happened, including DEC, Data General and many multiprocessor vendors such as Sequent Computer Systems and Pyramid Technology.

<text>Villa Clara is one of the provinces of Cuba. It is located in the central region of the island bordering on the Atlantic Ocean to the north, Matanzas Province to the west, Sancti Spiritus Province to the east, and Cienfuegos Province to the South. Villa Clara shares with Cienfuegos and Sancti Spiritus on the south the Escambray Mountain Range. Its main cities are Santa Clara (the capital), Remedios, Sagua La Grande, Camajuani, Caibarién, Ranchuelo, Placetas, and Manicaragua.

==History==
Prior to 1976, the current provinces of Cienfuegos, Sancti Spíritus, and Villa Clara were all part of the now obsolete province of Las Villas, but Villa Clara is still referred some times just as &quot;Las Villas&quot; using the shorter old name. Santa Clara was the capital of historical Las Villas and still capital of Villa Clara province. That old name itself, Spanish for &quot;The Cities&quot;, refers to the four original 16th and 17th-century cities founded in this vast territory: San Juan de los Remedios, Sancti Spíritus, Santísima Trinidad and Gloriosa Santa Clara.

During pre-Spanish settlement in Cuba, what now is Villa Clara province was populated by Taíno people with chieftains of Sabanaque (north west), Sabana (north east), and Cubanacan, literally &quot;The Middle Land&quot; in the center where Santa Clara city is located nowadays. In this region from the eastern landing point of the Spanish was where Columbus believed the &quot;King of India&quot; was living. 
In early colonial Cuba, historical province Las Villas was center to cattle industry but by the 18th and 19th centuries it had shifted to sugar production with a large concentration of mills. At the beginning of the 20th century it had the highest percentage of land farms (90%). In 1950 it was second to Havana in manufacturing establishments.

After Castro&#x27;s revolution in the 1960s it still led in sugar production on the island, but in the late 80s and 90s after the collapse of the Soviet Union and lack of support thereof, most of the already inefficient mills were closed down, some of them disassembled, while others became museums. Only the most efficient mills are still producing sugar. Since then the province concentrated its efforts on building beach resorts.

The country&#x27;s first transgender municipal delegate was elected in Villa Clara in early 2013. Adela Agustin Hernandez is a resident of the town of Caibarien and works as a nurse electrocardiogram specialist.

==Economy==
Sugar, the commodity that the Cuban economy once relied upon, was primarily based in the plains in the north of the province, and several large mills provided employment to many people. Now in the newly restructured Cuban economy, most of these mills have been abandoned and the economy is instead focused on newly built beach resorts in the north cays. Sugar and tobacco are still the two most important agricultural commodities of the province.
==Geography==
The northern coast of Villa Clara is dotted with numerous cays (part of the Sabana-Camaguey Archipelago), and there are many coral reefs, sandy beaches, and newly constructed touristic resorts.

The Cays are a capricious cluster of some 500 islands, strewn along a sea of varying shades of blues and greens off the northern coast of the central province of Villa Clara and close to the second largest coral barrier reef in the world. It is a tropical paradise with more than 17 km of fine-white sand beaches.

Villa Clara Cays, covering more than 77 844 hectares, are a veritable wildlife refuge and provide a habitat for some 248 species of plants. The most precious jewels are Cayo Las Brujas, Cayo Ensenachos and Cayo Santa Maria, renowned for their immaculate landscape of incredible beauty, with sugary-white sand beaches and crystal-clear waters, fringed by autochthonous vegetation and connected to Caibarien, a small fishing town on the Cuban mainland, by a 48 km causeway stretching over the sea -accorded an international prize for its harmonious combination of nature and engineering in an area declared a World Biosphere Reserve- thus enabling visitors to access the cays directly from Santa Clara City, site of the international airport. The causeway has a total of 46 bridges especially designed to allow the flow of sea water, therefore protecting both the biodiversity and sustainability of the area.
There are smaller airfields near most of the main towns, plus a small international terminal in Cayo Las Brujas for the operation of small and medium size charter aircraft.

Villa Clara Cays, located approximately 300 km from Havana, are part of the Jardines del Rey archipelago, the largest archipelago surrounding Cuba which extends 465 km along the northern coast of the country.

A site of legends, it is said that this island, maze of singular biodiversity, was once a haven for pirates and buccaneers ready to pounce on ship passing along Cuba&#x27;s shores.

Cayo Las Brujas takes its name from an old legend about a young couple whose love was thwarted by a jealous uncle, who in turn is the namesake of another islet: Cayo Borracho, which means drunkard. The remains of the San Pascual, a ship that ran aground many years ago, can be observed a mile away from the cay. Built in San Francisco, California and launched in 1919, the ship evokes the presence of American writer Ernest Hemingway in the area. From its deck, Cuban painter Leopoldo Romañach found inspiration for some of his famous marine landscapes.

Cayo Ensenachos is the smallest of the three cays but is a refuge for 22 endemic plants and 39 wildlife species. Shaped like a horseshoe, the islet was originally an aboriginal settlement. The beach is always calm due to the position of the cay which prevents the large waves from hitting the shore with force.

Cayo Santa María is also known as the White Rose of Jardines del Rey. The cay was named after the flagship of Christopher Columbus&#x27;s fleet on his maiden voyage to the New World. Legend has it that this strip of land -some 13 km long and 2 km in width - is said to be haunted by the spirit of Rosa Maria Coraje, a woman who hid aboard a ship in a desperate attempt to find both paradise and her beloved. She landed on the cay and managed to survive hiding in the marshes, among the mangroves and feeding on fish, until she finally discovered her dearly-loved in a neighboring cay.

Around Santa Clara, the land rises into the Alturas de Santa Clara. The highest point in the Santa Clara region is in the Alturas, at above sea level, while the south, dominated by the Escambray Mountains, reach elevations of over . Villa Clara also has numerous lakes, which are used for both water sports and fishing. The largest Cuban river to drain into the Atlantic, Río Sagua la Grande, is also in Villa Clara province.

<doc id="450695" wikidata="Q455390" url="?curid=450695" title="Nguyễn Ngọc Loan">
<text>Nguyễn Ngọc Loan (; 11 December 193014 July 1998) was a South Vietnamese general and chief of the South Vietnamese National Police.

Loan gained international attention when he summarily executed a handcuffed prisoner of war named Nguyễn Văn Lém on February 1, 1968, in Saigon, Vietnam during the Tet Offensive. Nguyễn Văn Lém was a Viet Cong (VC) member. South Vietnamese Vice President Nguyễn Cao Kỳ stated that Lém was &quot;a very high ranking&quot; political official, but had not been a member of the Viet Cong military. The event was witnessed and recorded by Võ Sửu, a cameraman for NBC, and Eddie Adams, an Associated Press photographer. The photo and film became two famous images in contemporary American journalism.

Despite the determination of the Immigration and Naturalization Service that Loan committed war crimes, owing to which he was liable for deportation back to Vietnam, the then US President, Jimmy Carter, intervened personally to halt the deportation proceedings.

== Early life ==
Loan was born 11 December 1930 to a middle-class family in Huế and was one of eleven children. He studied pharmacy and graduated near the top of his class at Huế University before joining the Vietnamese National Army in 1951. He soon studied at an officer training school, where he befriended classmate Nguyễn Cao Kỳ. Loan received pilot training in Morocco before returning to Vietnam in 1955, serving with the Republic of Vietnam Air Force (RVNAF) for the next decade.

He received additional training in the United States at some time during this period, enabling him to speak English fluently by the time he became prominent during the late 1960s. Loan&#x27;s career followed Ky&#x27;s, and when Ky became commander of the RVNAF, Loan served as chief of staff. During the February 1965 Operation Flaming Dart airstrikes targeting North Vietnam Loan flew as Ky&#x27;s wingman.

==Career==
In June 1965, when Ky became premier of South Vietnam, he promoted Loan to colonel and appointed him director of the Military Security Service. This was followed within a few months by an appointment to director of the Central Intelligence Organization, giving Loan simultaneous control of both military intelligence and security. He was further made director general of the Republic of Vietnam National Police in April 1966. Having these positions enabled Loan to wield immense power, and he supervised the suppression of the early 1966 uprising of Ky&#x27;s rival General Nguyễn Chánh Thi and dissident Buddhists. When Ky agreed to become vice president for President Nguyễn Văn Thiệu in 1967, the former relied on the assistance Loan provided for him in order to retain power.

Loan was a staunch South Vietnamese nationalist, refusing to give Americans special treatment in his jurisdiction. For example, in December 1966 he rejected the arrest of Saigon mayor Van Van Cua by American military police and insisted that only South Vietnamese authorities could arrest and detain South Vietnamese citizens. He also insisted that U.S. civilians, including journalists, were subject to South Vietnamese jurisdiction while in Saigon. Loan&#x27;s uncompromising stand caused him to be regarded as a troublemaker by the Presidency of Lyndon B. Johnson. Loan was also skeptical of the U.S. CIA-backed Phoenix Program to attack and neutralize the clandestine VC infrastructure.

Loan&#x27;s men were also involved with the arrest of two VC operatives on 15 August 1967 who had been engaged with attempting peace negotiations with U.S. officials without the participation of the South Vietnamese in an initiative code-named &quot;Buttercup&quot;. His opposition to such surreptitious dealing, and his opposition to releasing one of the communist negotiators, reportedly angered the Americans, and forced them to keep both him and the South Vietnamese better informed of diplomatic dealings involving their country.

Loan was an accomplished pilot—he commanded an airstrike on VC forces at Bù Đốp in 1967, soon before he was promoted to permanent brigadier general rank. The Americans were displeased at his promotion, and Loan submitted his resignation soon thereafter. The South Vietnamese cabinet subsequently rejected Loan&#x27;s resignation.

===Execution of Nguyễn Văn Lém===

Nguyễn Văn Lém (also known as Bảy Lốp) was a Vietcong captain. On 1 February 1968, during the Tet Offensive, he was captured in a building in the Cho Lon quarter of Saigon, near the Ấn Quang pagoda. Lém wore civilian clothing at the time of his capture. Handcuffed, he was brought to Loan, who then summarily executed him on the street using his sidearm, a .38 Special Smith &amp; Wesson Bodyguard Model 49 revolver. A reporter for &quot;The New York Times&quot; later wrote that this likely violated the Geneva Conventions.

A story emerged during the 1980s that Lém had just murdered a police major, a subordinate and close friend of General Loan, and the major&#x27;s whole family. The photographer Eddie Adams believed and repeated this story. &quot;It turns out that the Viet Cong lieutenant who was killed in the picture had murdered a police major--one of General Loan&#x27;s best friends--his whole family, wife, kids, the same guy. So these are things we didn&#x27;t know at the time.&quot; &quot;I didn&#x27;t have a picture of that Viet Cong blowing away the family.&quot; In 2008, a new version appeared, in which Lém had murdered the family of Lieutenant Colonel Nguyễn Tuấn, who was not a subordinate of General Loan but an officer of the armored forces of the ARVN. Max Hastings, writing in 2018, said that some of the allegations made against Lém were true. Only one of Lt. Col. Tuan&#x27;s children, Huan Nguyen, survived the attack and later became the first Vietnamese American promoted to rear admiral in the United States Navy. Hastings also wrote that American historian Edwin Moise &quot;is convinced that the entire story of Lém murdering the Tuân family is a post-war invention.&quot; Hastings concluded that &quot;the truth will never be known.&quot;

The execution was captured as a photo by Associated Press photographer Eddie Adams and on video by NBC News television cameraman Võ Sửu. After the execution, Loan told Adams: &quot;They killed many of our people and many of yours.&quot; Võ Sửu reported that after the shooting Loan went to a reporter and said &quot;These guys kill a lot of our people, and I think Buddha will forgive me.&quot;

Interviewed by Oriana Fallaci in May 1968 for her book &quot;Nothing, and So be it&quot;, he stated that he was aware of the indignation he caused and that he understood Fallaci&#x27;s opinion when she regarded him as a cold-blooded killer. He said that he killed Lém because he felt enraged that the VC were wearing civilian clothes. Speaking to Fallaci, he said: &quot;He wasn&#x27;t wearing a uniform and I can&#x27;t respect a man who shoots without wearing a uniform. Because it&#x27;s too easy: you kill and you&#x27;re not recognized. I respect a North Vietnamese because he&#x27;s dressed as a soldier, like myself, and so he takes the same risks as I do. But a Vietcong in civilian clothes - I was filled with rage.&quot; Loan has also recounted, &quot;If you hesitate, if you didn&#x27;t do your duty, the men won&#x27;t follow you&quot;.

The photograph and footage were broadcast worldwide, allegedly increasing anti-war sentiment. Eddie Adams&#x27; photo won him the 1969 Pulitzer Prize for Spot News Photography. Adams later stated he regretted he was unable to get a picture &quot;of that Viet Cong [Lém] blowing away the [Tuan] family&quot;.

===Subsequent career===
A few months after the execution picture was taken, Loan was wounded seriously near Saigon by machine gun fire to his right leg. Again, his picture was published by the world press, this time as Australian war correspondent Pat Burgess carried him back to his lines.

On 8 June 1968 President Thiệu replaced Loan as Director of National Police with Trần Văn Hai.
In late June he went to Australia for medical treatment, returning to Vietnam later that year. In May 1969 he and his family flew to the US where he received medical treatment at Walter Reed Army Medical Center and remained in Alexandria, Virginia until December 1969 when they returned to Vietnam. Soon after his arrival in the US Adams was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for his photo and this brought attention to Loan. Senator Stephen M. Young denounced Loan in the Senate calling him a &quot;brutal murderer&quot;.

In August 1970 he was appointed to a Defense Ministry job that involved long-range planning but lacked actual power. Loan helped construct hospitals for war wounded and was a frequent visitor to children&#x27;s hospitals and orphanages. His leg wound continued to trouble him and it was amputated in September 1974.

== Later life ==
In 1975, during the fall of Saigon, Loan approached the US Embassy for evacuation, but was refused, and he and his family escaped aboard an RVNAF airplane and eventually reached the US. There he moved to Dale City, Virginia. He then opened a restaurant named &quot;Les Trois Continents&quot; in the Washington, D.C. suburb of Burke, Virginia at Rolling Valley Mall. The restaurant served pizza, hamburgers, and Vietnamese cuisine, but was described as more of a pizzeria. Loan also worked as a secretary in a Washington company at this time. When interviewed, Loan stated &quot;All we want to do is to forget and to be left alone&quot;.

Adams later apologized in person to Loan and his family for the damage his photograph did to his reputation.

House of Representatives member Elizabeth Holtzman forwarded a list of Vietnamese officials who may have committed war crimes (including Loan) to Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS). House of Representatives member Harold S. Sawyer later requested the Library of Congress investigate Loan. In 1978, the INS contended that Loan had committed a war crime, following a report by the Library of Congress which concluded that the summary execution of Nguyễn Văn Lém had been illegal by Vietnamese law, in an attempt to revoke his permanent resident status to ensure that he could not become a United States citizen. They approached Adams to testify against Loan, but Adams instead testified in his favor and Loan was allowed to stay. The deportation was halted by the intervention of United States President Jimmy Carter, who stated that &quot;such historical revisionism was folly&quot;.

Loan visited the Vietnam Veterans Memorial and praised it.

In 1991, Loan closed his restaurant and retired after a decrease of business caused by increased publicity about his past. Adams recalled that on his last visit to the pizza parlor soon before it closed, he had seen written on a toilet wall, &quot;We know who you are, you fucker&quot;.

== Death ==
Nguyễn Ngọc Loan died of cancer on 14 July 1998, aged 67, in Burke, Virginia. After his death, Adams praised him: &quot;The guy was a hero. America should be crying. I just hate to see him go this way, without people knowing anything about him.&quot;

Eddie Adams wrote a eulogy to Loan in &quot;Time&quot;:

==Personal life==
Loan was married to Chinh Mai, with whom he raised five children.

<doc id="450698" wikidata="Q3132684" url="?curid=450698" title="Henry Cecil">
<text>Sir Henry Richard Amherst Cecil (11 January 1943 – 11 June 2013) was a British flat racing horse trainer. Cecil was very successful, becoming Champion Trainer ten times and training 25 domestic Classic winners. These comprised four winners of the Derby, eight winners of the Oaks, six winners of the 1,000 Guineas, three of the 2,000 Guineas and four winners of the St Leger Stakes. His 1000 Guineas and Oaks successes made him particularly renowned for his success with fillies. He was noted for his mastery at Royal Ascot, where he trained 75 winners.

Describing his approach to training, Cecil told &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;: &quot;I do everything by instinct really, not by the book. I like to think I’ve got a feeling for and understand my horses, that they tell me what to do really.&quot;

Cecil was knighted for services to horse racing in the Queen&#x27;s 2011 Birthday Honours.

==Background and education==
Cecil was born on 11 January 1943 in a hospital near Aberdeen, ten minutes ahead of his twin brother David. His father, Lt. Hon. Henry Kerr Auchmuty Cecil, younger brother of the 3rd Lord Amherst of Hackney, had been killed in action with the Parachute Regiment in North Africa shortly before Cecil was born. His mother, Rohays Cecil, was the daughter of Major-General Sir James Burnett of Leys, 13th Baronet, owner of Crathes Castle, Aberdeenshire.

When he was still a baby, Cecil&#x27;s mother married Captain Cecil Boyd-Rochfort, who was British flat racing Champion Trainer five times and who trained for, among others, George VI.

Cecil and his brother were educated at Sunningdale School and at Canford School, Dorset. He described himself as &quot;very late-maturing and backward&quot;, saying that he was the first boy from his prep school ever to fail Common Entrance to Eton. After school, the twins went to work at the Earl of Derby&#x27;s Woodland Stud in Newmarket, Suffolk, and at other studs overseas. They completed their education at the Royal Agricultural College, Cirencester.

==Training career==

===Early career and success===
From 1964 to 1968 Cecil worked as an assistant at his stepfather&#x27;s Freemason Lodge stable. He took out his own licence to train in 1969 and that year had his first winner with Celestial Cloud at Ripon on 17 May, with Wolver Hollow winning the Eclipse Stakes in July to give Cecil his first Group One success. He had his first winner at Royal Ascot the following year when Parthenon won the Queen Alexandra Stakes. In his early years Cecil received the support of Lord Howard de Walden, a noted breeder and owner of racehorses.

The languid, dandyish Cecil, noted for his flair in clothing, went on to remarkable achievements. In 1973 he tasted his first Classic success in Ireland when Cloonagh won the Irish 1,000 Guineas and in 1975 he won his first English Classic with Bolkonski at the 2,000 Guineas. He won three 1,000 Guineas and a further 2,000 Guineas before winning his first Epsom Derby in 1985 with Slip Anchor. In 1976 he had taken over the running of Warren Place in Newmarket from Sir Noel Murless, the father of his first wife, and he turned the stables into what has been called &quot;the most glamorous yard in Europe&quot;, setting it at &quot;the pinnacle of British racing&quot;. In 1999 he won three of the five Classic races and finished second in the other two. Prince Ahmed bin Salman, the owner of Oath, one of Cecil&#x27;s Derby winners, once said: &quot;Winning Classics is easy. Just buy a horse and send it to Henry Cecil&quot;.

Among the jockeys to ride for Cecil, the most notable have been Steve Cauthen, Lester Piggott, Joe Mercer, Kieren Fallon, Pat Eddery and, later, Tom Queally.

===Period in the wilderness===
After years of success, Cecil experienced a dramatic fall from grace. In the space of a few years a number of owner-breeders with long-standing relationships with Cecil died, including Louis Freedman, Jim Joel and Lord Howard de Walden. His first wife, Julie, and his head lad, Paddy Rudkin, left and in 1995 Cecil&#x27;s relationship with Sheikh Mohammed broke down, with the owner removing overnight the 40 horses he had in training at Cecil&#x27;s stable. Sheikh Mohammed suggested at the time that he and Cecil had disagreed about the fitness of one of his thoroughbreds, Mark of Esteem, to run at Ascot—a disagreement which Cecil had made public. Cecil maintained that they were still &quot;great friends&quot; and had not fallen out. A number of Cecil&#x27;s most notable horses had been owned by Sheikh Mohammed, including Oh So Sharp, Diminuendo, Indian Skimmer and Belmez. The incident has been flagged as the &#x27;end of an era&#x27; in Cecil&#x27;s career.

Between July 2000 and October 2006, Cecil failed to train a winner in any Group One race. In 2005 he saddled just a dozen winners overall. His stable of 200 horses shrank to barely 50 and Cecil began to talk of retirement. His second marriage publicly collapsed, his twin brother David died of cancer in 2000, his yard was losing money, and in 2006 it was revealed that he was himself undergoing treatment for stomach cancer. Cecil recalled being on the Heath at Newmarket and overhearing someone say, &quot;That&#x27;s Henry Cecil. He should have retired a long time ago&quot;. His stable was supported almost exclusively by the loyalty of Prince Khaled Abdulla.

===Return to success and Frankel===
When Cecil&#x27;s Light Shift won the Oaks in 2007, it marked a return to form. This victory was his 24th English Classic winner and his eighth victory in the race, seven years after his previous winner. The season before he had barely made it into the top 100 trainers in the country. &quot;I might not be [competitive] on the outside&quot;, Cecil told &quot;The Independent&quot;. &quot;But I am on the inside, definitely—underneath, very competitive. Always have been. We like winning, you know. We do like winning. It&#x27;s what motivates you. Nobody likes failure. Your horses are running badly, or they&#x27;re no good, you get jealous of everybody else. It&#x27;s not quite so much fun, is it?&quot; The 2011 season was Cecil&#x27;s best for 10 years. He saddled 55 winners, securing prize money totaling more than £2.7 million.

Cecil&#x27;s success in 2011 was partly due to his training of the Khalid Abdullah-owned Frankel. In the 2010 season Frankel won the Royal Lodge Stakes and Group One Dewhurst Stakes. The following year he continued unbeaten, winning the Greenham Stakes, the 2,000 Guineas, the St. James&#x27;s Palace Stakes at Royal Ascot, the Sussex Stakes and the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes. His six length victory in the 2,000 Guineas was described as &quot;one of the greatest displays on a British racecourse&quot;. After his win in the Sussex Stakes Cecil himself described Frankel as &quot;the best horse I&#x27;ve ever seen&quot;. Timeform and the International Federation of Horseracing Authorities rated him the best horse in the world. In his four-year-old season Frankel won the Group One Lockinge Stakes at Newbury before an eleven length victory in the Queen Anne Stakes at Royal Ascot, described in one national newspaper as &quot;possibly the best single performance by any horse, on any track, since three Arabian stallions were imported into Britain to found the thoroughbred breed in the early years of the 18th century&quot;. Timeform raised their rating to 147, making Frankel the highest rated horse in their history. He won a second Sussex Stakes, at odds of 1–20, and then stepped up in distance to win by seven lengths the Juddmonte International Stakes at York over 10 furlongs. In October 2012 Frankel won the Champion Stakes at Ascot to finish his career unbeaten. &quot;He&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve ever had, the best I&#x27;ve ever seen&quot;, Cecil told the BBC after the race, &quot;I&#x27;d be very surprised if there&#x27;s ever been anything better.&quot;

==Personal life==
In 1966, Cecil married Julie Murless, the daughter of trainer Sir Noel Murless. The couple had two children but divorced in 1990. Cecil had been conducting an affair with Natalie Payne, whom he married two years later. When they met Cecil was 46 and his future second wife was 22.

Cecil&#x27;s second marriage broke down very publicly. Newspaper reports alleged that his wife was being unfaithful, including with an unidentified jockey, while a front-page story in the &quot;News of the World&quot; suggested that Cecil had stayed at the Grand Hotel in Brighton with an £800-a-night prostitute. Days after the story broke Cecil dismissed his stable jockey Kieren Fallon for &quot;personal reasons&quot;. Fallon issued a statement denying that he was involved in the breakdown of the Cecil marriage and began legal proceedings for breach of contract; the case was settled out of court. Cecil and his wife divorced in 2002.

In 2008, Cecil married Jane McKeown.

Cecil continued to receive treatment for stomach cancer. He was unable to be at Goodwood for Frankel&#x27;s second victory in the Sussex Stakes in August 2012, but did attend the Ebor Festival at York later that month, describing Frankel&#x27;s victory in the International Stakes as having made him feel &quot;20 years better&quot;.

==Death==
Cecil died of cancer on 11 June 2013 in hospital in Cambridge. He was 70. Racing broadcaster Derek Thompson called him &quot;the greatest trainer of all time&quot; while trainer Paul Nicholls referred to Cecil as &quot;a true legend&quot;. Clare Balding, on Twitter, referred to Cecil as &quot;one of the true greats and a gentleman. Frankel his crowning glory.&quot; Royal Ascot paid its respects to Cecil with a minute&#x27;s silence before the opening race of the five-day meeting at 2.20 pm on 18 June 2013.

<text>Kirtland&#x27;s warbler (Setophaga kirtlandii), also known in Michigan by the common name jack pine bird, or the jack pine warbler, is a small songbird of the New World warbler family (Parulidae). Nearly extinct just years ago, populations have recovered due to the conservation efforts of the Kirtland&#x27;s Warbler Conservation Team and its members. The birds require large areas, greater than 160 acres (65 hectares), of dense young jack pine for breeding habitat. This habitat was historically created by wildfire, but today is created through the harvest of mature jack pine (&quot;Pinus banksiana&quot;), and planting of jack pine seedlings.

The population of the species spends the spring and summer in their breeding range in the Great Lakes region of Canada (Ontario) and the United States (Wisconsin and Michigan, especially in the northeastern Lower Peninsula), and winters in the West Indies.

==Taxonomy==
This species was first recorded by Europeans relatively late for a bird from eastern North America. The first specimen was shot at sea somewhere between the Abaco Islands of The Bahamas and Cuba in mid-October 1841 by the ornithologist Samuel Cabot III. However, the specimen was unrecognized as a new species in the private collection of Cabot&#x27;s father, Boston merchant Samuel Cabot Jr., until it made its way to the Museum of the Smithsonian Institution in the 1860s.

Ten years later the holotype, a juvenile male, was shot on Jared Potter Kirtland&#x27;s farm near Cleveland, Ohio, in mid-May 1851. It was used to formally describe the species as &quot;Sylvicola kirtlandii&quot; by Spencer Fullerton Baird in 1852. Baird first attributed the collection to Charles Pease (Kirtland&#x27;s son-in-law) in his 1852 description, but by 1858 he had changed his story and was attributing it to Kirtland.

In 1858 Baird moved the species, still then only known from his single specimen, to the genus &quot;Dendroica&quot;, where it remained until the 2010s, when it (and all other &quot;Dendroica&quot; warblers) was merged into the genus &quot;Setophaga&quot;.

By 1865 only four individuals were known to have been collected. Baird lists the male specimen from the Cabot collection, the holotype, a first female specimen shot in 1860 near Cleveland and preserved by R. K. Winslow, and a fourth (which Winslow mentioned had also been killed near Cleveland but had not been preserved). Local naturalist Philo Romayne Hoy also mentioned having possibly seen the species once near the village of Racine, Ohio, in the 1850s.

===Etymology===
Baird decided to name the bird after Jared Potter Kirtland: &quot;a gentleman to whom, more than any one living, we are indebted for a knowledge of the Natural History of the Mississippi Valley&quot;. The generic epithet &quot;Setophaga&quot; is from the genitive case of Ancient Greek σής, transliterated as &quot;sḗs&quot;, meaning &quot;moth&quot;, and &quot;&quot;, meaning &quot;eating&quot;.

==Description==

Male Kirtland&#x27;s warblers have bluish-grey upper body parts, with dark streaks on the back, yellow bellies, and dark streaks on the flanks and sides. It has black lores (cheeks) and a distinctive, large and conspicuous broken white eye ring, which it only shares with &quot;Setophaga coronata&quot;. Females and juveniles are similar, but are browner on the wings and back and are not as boldly or brightly marked. It frequently bobs its tail up and down, which is uncommon in northern warblers. At and , it is the largest of the numerous warblers formerly classified in the genus &quot;Dendroica&quot; and is now the largest of the 35 or so species in the currently-accepted &quot;Setophaga&quot; genus. The Kirtland warbler has a wingspan of . Its mating song is a loud &quot;chip-chip-chip-too-too-weet-weet&quot; often sung from the top of a snag (dead tree) or northern pin oak (&quot;Quercus ellipsoidalis&quot;) clump. This song can be heard over 400m away in good conditions. In its overwintering grounds it does not sing but makes loud &quot;chip&quot; noises from low in dense bushes.

The eggs are a &quot;delicate&quot; pinkish white when fresh, fading to a dull white after a time. There are a few scattered sprinkles in various shades of brown and pink, these sprinkles and blotches concentrated at the top or form a sort of wreath at the larger end. The egg is not very glossy. It is 18 by 14mm in size. The shell is very thin.

===Similar species===
Baird compared and found it most similar to &quot;Setophaga coronata&quot;, finding it best distinguishable by having a nearly uniformly yellow belly, no conspicuous yellow rump or crown, less black in the feathers of the crown, and a considerably larger and stouter bill and feet. Henninger mentions he finds it to have a certain resemblance to &quot;S. magnolia&quot;. In The Bahamas it may be misidentified with &quot;S. dominica flavescens&quot;.

===Hybrids===
In late October 1997 a large hybrid &quot;Setophaga&quot; warbler was netted in the low elevation dry scrublands of the southernmost Dominican Republic, which based on morphology (plumage colour and anatomical measurements of size) and geography was most likely a hybrid between &quot;S. kirtlandii&quot; and &quot;S. fusca&quot;.

==Distribution==
It was originally only known from Kirtland&#x27;s home state of Ohio. In the mid 20th century the breeding range of Kirtland&#x27;s warbler was reduced to a very limited area in the north of the Lower Peninsula of Michigan. In recent years, breeding pairs have been found in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, Wisconsin, and southern Ontario due to the expanding population. The birds winter in Cuba, The Bahamas and the nearby Turks and Caicos Islands, where they are found on all islands investigated. A number also overwinter on Hispaniola, in the Dominican Republic. Overwintering birds have been collected and sighted a number of times in Florida. It has been recorded as a rare accidental on Bermuda and Jamaica, and there is an uncorroborated report from coastal Mexico. It has also been observed in the summer in Québec, although it is not known to breed there.

Individuals first migrate from The Bahamas west to Florida and South Carolina in the second half of April to early May, and from there move further northwest and westwards until they reach the Mississippi River, which they then follow upstream to the mouth of the Ohio River during May. They reach their breeding grounds early in June, and then leave their breeding range between August and October.

==Ecology==
The Kirtland&#x27;s warbler&#x27;s summer breeding habitat is in northern Michigan. Breeding habitat is where a bird lays its eggs and raises its babies. The Kirtland&#x27;s warbler only builds its nests on the ground in young jack pine forests found in Michigan and sometimes Wisconsin.

===Habitat===
In their winter habitat, they have been found primarily in low &quot;coppice&quot; habitat, especially areas which have been cleared for slash-and-burn agriculture but have regrown after abandonment (98% of all records), with a preference for dense shrubbery with small openings here and there, no canopy and low ground cover. It has otherwise been found in all habitats on the islands, including, albeit uncommonly, suburban gardens and Bahamian pineyards, with the exception of high coppice which has never been clear cut -it has never been seen here. With rare exceptions this bird is almost always sighted from the ground to 3m high (98%).

For breeding habitat it requires large areas of young jack pine on sandy soil. Kirtland&#x27;s warblers occur in greatest numbers in large areas that have been clear cut or where a large wildfire has occurred. For breeding they require stands of young (6 to 20 year old, 2–4 m high) jack pine trees. Other common plants in this habitat are blueberry (&quot;Vaccinium angustifolium&quot;), sweet fern (&quot;Comptonia peregrina&quot;), Canada mayflower (&quot;Maianthemum canadense&quot;) and various grasses. Although it was initially believed to exclusively require jack pine stands, more recent research has found that the bird will also breed in some places in young stands of red pine (&quot;Pinus resinosa&quot;) of 10 to 15 years old. When the pine stands grow so tall so as to lose their lowest branches near the forest floor, the environment no longer provides sufficient cover. Such stands are ideally densely stocked with young pines, but also contain small occasional patches of open areas or with sparse tree cover.

====Controversy====
The status of the overwintering habitat has been contentious, with researchers disagreeing. Mayfield (1992, 1996) first stated that the bird inhabits the shrub layer. Lee &quot;et al&quot;. (1997) also believed that the warbler inhabits shrubs, but they concluded that the species is entirely dependent on pineyards, stating that before the advent of deforestation of the high coppice after the colonisation of The Bahamas by pre-colonial Lucayan peoples, the bird must have been restricted to the northwestern islands which harbour these pineyards and absent from central, eastern and southern islands such as Eleuthera. Sykes and Clench (1998), basing their analysis on 96 unambiguous records of both collected specimens and observations on thirteen different islands, as well as almost 451 observations over three months of the same two banded individuals on Eleuthera, refuted the claim, finding that by far most records were from regrown coppice after abandonment of agricultural fields. Like Mayfield, they state many of the earlier records used by Lee &quot;et al&quot;. were tainted by misidentification with &quot;S. dominica flavescens&quot;, a similar-looking subspecies that was not adequately described or illustrated at the time of the recordings. A few months later, Haney &quot;et al&quot;. (1998) published a repudiation of Sykes and Clench based on 101 warbler records, wherein they claimed the warblers do not prefer scrub coppice and reiterated their earlier assertion that the primary habitat of the birds was pineyards. They went even further in concluding that the world population of the warbler was not limited by the situation in their breeding range in Michigan, but that historic fluctuations in their population were instead being determined by the status of the pineyards in Bahamas. A detailed study by Wunderle &quot;et al&quot;. (2010) using a much larger sample size of new data from 153 capture sites and 499 observations, and investigations of the diet, found that Sykes and Clench had been correct, and there was no validity to the assertions of Lee, Walsh-McGehee and Haney. Jones &quot;et al&quot;. (2013), researching the warbler on an island where pineyards had never grown, hypothesized that a sampling bias for birds in pineyards had skewed the results of the research presented by Haney &quot;et al&quot;. Despite the evidence, Birdlife International, which performs the IUCN Red List assessments, has consistently shown preference for the Haney &quot;et al&quot;. interpretation, stating that the conclusion that &quot;changes in population have occurred contemporaneously with the degradation and recovery of the north Bahamas pine ecosystem&quot; is more compelling than that the recovery efforts in Michigan were having effects on the population size.

Haney &quot;et al&quot;. stated that another reason that this warbler was most likely restricted to the pineyards habitat was because there was no low coppice habitat available until the arrival of the first human colonists on the islands, the Lucayans some 1,000 years ago, due to there being no mechanism that could destroy the natural high coppice of the islands. However, in 2007, Wunderle &quot;et al.&quot; pointed out that hurricanes might produce such young successional habitat, albeit with no empirical evidence; they theorized that perhaps this warbler species had specifically evolved to take advantage of such weather phenomena.

===Behaviour===
Yearlings and first-time breeders explore to find new breeding grounds, but ringed males have been observed to loyally return to the same nesting locality years after year; a male first ringed at CFB Petawawa in Ontario in 2006 returned for six consecutive years. This individual is estimated to have reached the age of nine, but in general the species are thought to have much shorter lifespans; males usually become four years old, and females are thought to only survive for 2.5 years on average.

One study found that 85% of the singing males are able to attract mates.

A warbler occupies a breeding territory of 2.7 to 3.4ha depending on location, but a larger wintering territory of 6.9 to 8.3ha depending on the island. They construct their nests on the ground, well concealed by lowest living branches of the jack pines and other vegetation. The nest is usually at the base of a tree, next to a down log or other structure. Eggs are laid in May to June.

===Diet===
It depends heavily during overwintering on the berries of &quot;Lantana involucrata&quot;, which is a very common successional shrub a few years after agriculture has been abandoned in a particular field. It is also said to eat the berries of &quot;Erithalis fruticosa&quot; and &quot;Chiococca alba&quot;. Of 331 observations of two warblers on Eleuthera in 1986, 76% were of foraging on &quot;Lantana&quot;, 8% were in &quot;Tournefortia volubilis&quot;, 4% in snowberry, 3.5% in &quot;Acacia rigens&quot;, 3.3% in &quot;Erithalis&quot;, 1.8% in &quot;Zanthoxylum fagara&quot;, and 1% &quot;Casuarina equisetifolia&quot;. Plants they were found foraging in at less than 1% were &quot;Sideroxylon salicifolium&quot;, &quot;Pithecellobium keyense&quot;, &quot;Tabebuia bahamensis&quot; and &quot;Scleria lithosperma&quot;. In its summering range this species feeds on blueberries and on insects such as spittlebugs, aphids and ants.

===Interactions with other species===

Jack pine is a species of pine with a distribution that spans almost across North America. Its cones open only after trees have been cleared away by forest fires or, after logging, in the summer sun. The ice age climate was somewhat drier overall and almost all of its present-day range was covered by solid ice as late as 10,000 to 15,000 years ago. Pollen analysis shows that the jack pine was almost non-existent between the Appalachian Mountains and the Great Plains during this period, with the possible exception of tiny isolated relict populations, which presents a mystery as to where the Kirtland&#x27;s warbler survived during this period. Mayfield suggests that the species was restricted during this age to the southeastern Atlantic coast, which might explain its modern overwintering range in the Bahamas as opposed to Mexico, as well as why it appears to be closer related to Caribbean warbler species. The jack pine and the warbler likely colonized the Midwest around 10,000 years ago.

Without human intervention, the warblers are severely impacted by nest parasitism by the brown-headed cowbird. Blue jays prey on the nests and are a nuisance species because individual jays repeatedly allow themselves to get caught in the same traps used to exterminate the cowbirds of the nesting region.

==Conservation==

The Kirtland&#x27;s Warbler Conservation Team is an integral part of post-delisting monitoring efforts and provides an important forum for sharing information, coordinating management efforts and ensuring that effective adaptive management occurs.

===Decline===
As global climate changed after the ice age through the last 10 millennia or so, jack pine, and consequently also Kirtland&#x27;s warbler, shifted their habitat north. The cold-hardy jack pine now grows as far as north as the Northwest Territories.

The Kirtland&#x27;s warbler has historically always been rare, with the species first recorded quite late for a bird from the eastern USA between the 1840s to 1851, only four or five birds seen in the first two decades after, and the breeding grounds and first nest not recorded in 1903 in Michigan.

It is still unclear to scientists how a species with such narrow habitat requirements was able to survive to modern times. One theory is that during the ice ages, which lasted much longer than interglacials, Kirtland&#x27;s warbler had a more stable distribution and habitat; i.e. the species exists as a glacial relict during geologically brief periods of warming global temperatures. It is quite possible that colonization by Europeans actually temporarily boosted populations of the bird. Most of the Lower Peninsula of Michigan was once covered in vast tracts of old growth white pine (&quot;Pinus strobus&quot;), the final stage of succession in the woodlands of that region, but these were all harvested by the early 19th century for construction in the growing cities and towns around the Great Lakes and along the East Coast. This created the conditions for the extensive woodlots of jack pine, a pioneer species, found today.

In 1871, fed by dry conditions, high winds and piles of logging slash, a massive forest fire swept through lower Michigan, with another largefire in The Thumb of the Lower Peninsula, and a further huge forest fire on the Wisconsin-Michigan border and yet another around Windsor, Ontario. In 1881 another massive conflagration burned down the forests in The Thumb, which eliminated the last of the original white pine woodlands of Michigan. This period coincides with the era where most Kirtland&#x27;s warbler specimens were collected, reflecting a possible peak in population size. However ornithologists were then unaware where it bred, and almost all these birds were taken in The Bahamas and Turks and Caicos or along the migration route. While no warblers were seen or killed in The Bahamas by the collector Henry Bryant in the 1850s and 1860s (despite his extensive searches), many dozens of warblers were recorded on almost all of the islands by the 1880s and 1890s. Charles Johnson Maynard collected 24 from New Providence during one two and a half month excursion in 1884. Maynard was a prolific collector, securing in this and subsequent years another ten on the same island almost a dozen on Eleuthera, and a further two on Cat Island, but many other collectors were able to obtain quite a number of specimens in The Bahamas during these decades.

In July 1903, the taxidermist Norman Asa Wood was presented with a specimen by a student at the University of Michigan, and promptly travelled to the area it was killed, where he found the first nest ever recorded for the species near the banks of the Au Sable River. He also found a second nest; both nests had chicks and one held a single unhatched egg. Wood killed all the birds he could (eight managed to escape his gun), and secured the nests and egg. He tried to rear some of the chicks, but these soon died. Including chicks, he returned to the city with fifteen specimens, the biggest collection of the species at the time in the USA. It was thus one of the last bird species of North America to have its nesting habits discovered. The following year Edward Arnold travelled to a nearby locality in June and found the third nest ever, with four eggs. He was able to capture both the male and female on the nest simply with his hands. Including these, 25 birds had been taken in Michigan by 1904, and another eight recorded, which made it clear that Michigan was the main stronghold of the breeding range of this warbler.

Considering the vernacular name of this bird was &quot;jack pine bird&quot; in Michigan, Wood was certainly not the first to discover that this species is specifically resident in jack pines, but in 1904 he was the first to publish these findings in a scientific journal. Woods also noted that, even in its breeding haunts, the bird was quite rare, and was not present in all areas of jack pine. This same year the migration route was first detailed in a paper by Charles C. Adams. Adams used dates of records of this bird in different states to show it migrated according to a very tight schedule, but used quite a broad route north spanning from the Mississippi River to South Carolina. He thought this might indicate that there were more breeding grounds to the west and east than those in Michigan which Woods had publicised. The records Adams was using are from the 1880s and 1890s and birds were shot as far west as Missouri and Minnesota, areas where the species has not been seen since.

In the 1920s, a recognised expert on this species was a Chicago teenager named Nathan F. Leopold (most well known for being one half of the crime pair Leopold and Loeb) who, in his scientific journal articles, published a number of important discoveries. One was that the age of the jack pines in a stand is the most pertinent determinant in the suitability of a particular terrain as a breeding habitat for the species, and another discovery was that the population was subject to a deleterious brood parasitism by the brown-headed cowbird.

Kirtland&#x27;s warbler is highly susceptible to nest parasitism by this cowbird. Brown-headed cowbirds feed mostly on seeds from grasses and weeds, with some crop grains. Insects such as grasshoppers and beetles, often caught as cows and horses stir them into movement, make up about a quarter of a cowbird&#x27;s diet. Development and fragmentation of forests in the eastern United States have allowed brown-headed cowbirds to greatly expand their range eastward. One study from 1931 to 1971 found 59% of the warbler nests parasitised in comparison to 5% of the nests in the study area of all other bird species combined, another study found 48% from 1903 to 1949; another found 86% rate of parasitism; and a last study found 69% of the warbler nests afflicted from 1957 to 1971. In 1971 the third decennial census counted 201 singing males, whereas the 1961 census had found 501 breeding pairs, showing a 60% decrease in population over the 1960s.

The first census of the species was performed in 1951, organised in part by a young Harold F. Mayfield, who would eventually spend the rest of life researching this species. 432 males were counted, half of these in just two areas where fires had raged in the 1930s. The second of what was supposed to be a decennial census program in 1961 showed an increase in population, with 502 males counted; many of these were still found at the sites of the two 1930s fires, a quarter was now resident at the site of a large fire from 1946.

The population reached a low of 167 singing males in 1974, and in 1994 only of suitable breeding habitat was available.

===Recovery===
It was listed as endangered in the US in 1967. In 1971 a recovery plan was developed. The plan entailed the management of state and federal land through clear cutting, controlled burning and planting jack pine to expand suitable nesting habitat for Kirtland&#x27;s warbler, as well as having the government acquire more land for this purpose. The other components were to limit public access land during nesting season, to conduct annual censuses of the warbler population, and lastly to intensively control the cowbird population.

A 1966 study found that shooting and trapping the cowbirds could reduce parasitism from 65% to 21%, and in 1972 cowbird control efforts commenced. The cowbird traps were 4 by 4 ft. and 6 ft. high with a recessed entrance hole at the top, and worked using sunflower seed bait, tape recorders playing birdsongs and decoy cowbirds which attracted more cowbirds. Cowbirds are asphyxiated in plastic bags using car exhaust fumes. Once a day during breeding season, or when the traps had collected 30 to 40 birds, the traps were serviced to destroy cowbirds. Other trapped bird species were banded and released, and some twelve cowbirds were left in the trap as decoys. Less cowbirds are caught as the season progresses, and radio-tracked cowbirds indicate that females are sedentary during the season. In the first year, 1972, 2,200 cowbirds were eliminated using a single trap, and only 6% of the warbler nests in the region were parasitised compared to 69% previously. Average clutch size in the region almost doubled. In 1973 the program was expanded to four traps, which caught 3,300 cowbirds and resulted in no parasitism that year. That same year 216 singing male warblers were recorded an increase of 9.2% from the 200 males recorded in 1972, and the first increase recorded ever. Thus the control program was considered a success, and the following year 22 cowbird traps were deployed, removing over 4,000 cowbirds across the region. Although only 167 singing male warblers were recorded in 1974, nevertheless the large number of fledglings meant the traps were effective. As of 2016, the cowbird traps still capture 4,000 cowbirds a season. Effective blue jay management involves transporting a few hundred jays a year dozens of miles away to be released.

Today the habitat of Kirtland&#x27;s warbler is no longer being preserved by prescribed burns as these have proved too difficult to control (a forest service employee named James Swiderski was immolated during one of these burns in 1980), and the species is entirely dependent on staggered harvests by the timber industry for its survival. Some 76,000 hectares are reserved for this purpose on the Lower Peninsula of Michigan, of which some 15,000 are maintained as young jack pine breeding habitat for the bird. The Michigan Department of Natural Resources, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the U.S. Forest Service coordinate the clear cutting of tracts of 50 year old jack pines on 23 Kirtland&#x27;s warbler management units. These managed units total . After cutting new trees are planted in a specified pattern to mimic the natural habitat the warbler needs, with clearings and dense thickets.

In 2004 Kirtland&#x27;s warbler had been observed in Ontario and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, and rarely recorded in northwest Ohio, where the numbers of recorded birds are increasing. Beginning in 2005 a small number have been observed in Wisconsin. In 2007 three Kirtland&#x27;s warbler nests were discovered in central Wisconsin and one at CFB Petawawa in Ontario, providing a sign that they are recovering and expanding their range once again. The Wisconsin population continues to grow, with 53 individuals and twenty nests recorded in 2017.

In the IUCN Red List the Kirtland&#x27;s warbler was classified as vulnerable to extinction since 1994, but was listed as near threatened in 2005 due to its recovery. Although there seemed to be no more than 5,000 Kirtland&#x27;s warblers as of late 2007, four years earlier they had numbered just 2500–3000. Since the recovery plan began in the 1970s, the numbers of Kirtland&#x27;s warbler have steadily risen, with an estimated population of 5,000 in 2016. A world total of 2,365 singing males were reported in the 2015 census. By 2018 there were an estimated 2,300 pairs and the population had continued to grow over the previous sixteen years according to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Midwest Region. In 2019 the population has been above the recovery goal of 1,000 pairs for seventeen years.

The birds depend on The Bahamas and adjacent territories during winter; in 1998 their winter habitat was judged to be extremely widespread and it was calculated that there is enough area and habitat in the Bahamas to house a population of roughly more than 500,000 birds. The most destructive threat in the winter range are thought to be house cats, at least on some islands.

If Haney &quot;et al&quot;. are correct in arguing that the species does not overwinter in scrub coppice habitats in The Bahamas, but instead in pineyards, and the abundance of this species is in fact limited by changes in this pineyard habitat, the conservation efforts in Michigan may be insufficient for species recovery. Some Michigan locals have questioned the cost and point of the program. Habitat and cowbird management cost $1 million per year as of 2003. In the 1990s this was garnered from a carbon sequestration fund, but that source of financing has been terminated. Management costs were estimated at $1.5 to 2 million per year in 2008, however, the payments by timber companies for the sale of jack pine for manufacturing paper and wood pulp offsets some costs, and the species brings bird-watching tourists to the region which is an economic boon to local businesses. Survival of this species will require management that will need to continue in perpetuity. An endowment fund to ensure a permanent funding source for the species has been discussed as an option.

There is a Kirtland&#x27;s warbler festival in Roscommon, Michigan, which is sponsored in part by Kirtland Community College (which is named in honour of the bird). The festival is held annually during the first full weekend of June.

====Canada====
Until 2007 Kirtland&#x27;s warblers had never been known to have bred in Canada, with the exception of one ambiguous possible record from near Midhurst, Ontario in 1945. The first bird was collected in the country in 1900 when a specimen was secured on Toronto Island. The bird was then seen in the country in 1916 at the army base of CFB Petawawa by a military dentist, Paul Harrington; the same dentist made the third sighting of Canada at the same location in 1939, and in the next 65 years a bit more than two dozen sightings of the bird were made in the country, although only a few are verified. In 1979 it was declared an endangered species of Canada on the basis that it may have once bred in Ontario. In 2006 suddenly three birds were recorded at Petawawa, and the subsequent year the first ever nest was recorded at the same locality. The habitat at this location appears to have been maintained due to fires stemming from military training exercises. After 2007 the bird has bred almost every year at Petawawa, with the birds here fledged 27 young by 2014, and it has been reported at additional locations in central Ontario.

The government of Ontario published a recovery strategy for the Kirtland&#x27;s warbler in 2016. A new mixed red and jack pine stand was planted at a location in Simcoe County in 2018 in the hopes of attracting the warbler, of which a sighting in the area had earlier been reported. Red pine was interspersed with the jack pine because the latter is relatively worthless as lumber, and it was hoped this configuration would make the project more economically sustainable.

====Delisting====
Prior to being delisted from the United States Fish and Wildlife Service list of endangered mammals and birds in 2019, the Kirtland&#x27;s warbler had been listed as &quot;endangered&quot; under the Endangered Species Act of 1973. Since delisting, continued monitoring is being used to ensure that the species remains secure.

<text>A display device is an output device for presentation of information in visual or tactile form (the latter used for example in tactile electronic displays for blind people). When the input information that is supplied has an electrical signal the display is called an &quot;electronic display&quot;.

Common applications for &quot;electronic visual displays&quot; are television sets or computer monitors.

== Types of electronic displays ==
=== In use ===
These are the technologies used to create the various displays in use today.

* Liquid-crystal display (LCD)
** Light-emitting diode (LED) backlit LCD
** Thin-film transistor (TFT) LCD
** Quantum dot (QLED) display
* Light-emitting diode (LED) display
** OLED display
** AMOLED display
** Super AMOLED display

==== Segment displays ====
Some displays can show only digits or alphanumeric characters. They are called segment displays, because they are composed of several segments that switch on and off to give appearance of desired glyph. The segments are usually single LEDs or liquid crystals. They are mostly used in digital watches and pocket calculators. Common types are seven-segment displays which are used for numerals only, and alphanumeric fourteen-segment displays and sixteen-segment displays which can display numerals and Roman alphabet letters.

=== Other types ===
* Vacuum fluorescent display
* Electroluminescent (ELD) display
* Plasma (PDP) display
* Laser-powered phosphor display

Cathode-ray tubes were also formerly widely used.

==== Full-area 2-dimensional displays ====
2-dimensional displays that cover a full area (usually a rectangle) are also called video displays, since it is the main modality of presenting video.

===== Applications of full-area 2-dimensional displays =====
Full-area 2-dimensional displays are used in, for example:
* Television set
* Computer monitors
* Head-mounted displays, Heads-up displays and Virtual reality headsets
* Broadcast reference monitor
* Medical monitors
* Mobile displays (for mobile devices)
* Smartphone displays (for smartphones)
* Video walls

===== Underlying technologies of full-area 2-dimensional displays =====
Underlying technologies for full-area 2-dimensional displays include:
* Cathode-ray tube display (CRT)

<text>Reverend John Joachim Zubly (August 27, 1724 – July 23, 1781), born Hans Joachim Züblin, was a Swiss-born American pastor, planter, and statesman during the American Revolution. Although a delegate for Georgia to the Continental Congress in 1775, he resisted independence from Great Britain and became a Loyalist.

==Early life and career==

Zubly was born in St. Gall, Switzerland, on August 27, 1724. He was ordained to the German [Reformed] Church ministry in London on 19 August 1744. Following that, he came to South Carolina, where his father David Zublin had settled near the Savannah River in 1735. He preached first at small congregations south of Savannah. In 1746, he married Anna Tobler, daughter of Appenzell Ausserrhoden governor and later New Windsor Township founder Johannes Tobler. He then spent 10 years as minister at the Wappetaw Church near Charleston, an interesting congregation composed largely of descendants of a shipwreck that carried Congregationalists from New England. In 1756, he visited and preached to a congregation in Savannah. They were so impressed with him that he was later invited to their newly created pulpit. So in 1760, he moved to Savannah and became the first pastor of the Independent Presbyterian Church there.

Reverend Zubly&#x27;s relationship to the Revolution reflects the confusion and conflict inherent in the shift of ideas during his time. Zubly&#x27;s Calvinist religious beliefs made him an outspoken and influential supporter of the colonists&#x27; rights. By 1775, Zubly had come to view what he saw as the increasingly secular and godless resistance of the colonies with alarm. Many view his career as moving from a staunch defender of colonial rights, to an apologist for the monarchy, to a loyalist and opponent of republican government. However, it was his religious beliefs that remained constant, while the political environment shifted around him.

==Start of the revolution==
After the Stamp Act in 1765, some of his sermons began to be issued as pamphlets, most notably &quot;An Humble Enquiry Into the Nature of the Dependency of the American Colonies upon the Parliament of Great-Britain and the Right of Parliament to Lay Taxes on the said Colonies.&quot; His reasoning helped to clarify the differences and relationships between constitutions, legislatures, laws, and people. Bernard Bailyn credits him with making important contributions to the consideration of representative legislatures by identifying some of the issues involved.

In the period leading up to the Revolution, he was not a member of the Georgia Assembly. But, he was frequently called on to open their sessions with prayer and a sermon. Georgia was not represented in the First Continental Congress of 1774, but in July 1775, they held a revolutionary congress in Savannah and Zubly was named as one of their delegates to the Second Continental Congress in Philadelphia.

In 1774, he published &quot;Great Britain&#x27;s right to tax her colonies, placed in the clearest light, by a Swiss&quot;.

==The Continental Congress==

John Zubly took his seat as a delegate in Philadelphia on September 15, 1775. Early in his time at the Congress he expressed his position by saying, &quot;I came here with two views; one, to secure the rights of America; second, a reconciliation with Great Britain.&quot;. His distance from the sentiments of the Congress as a whole widened during debates over non-importation or trade embargoes. Georgia&#x27;s development was so recent that she lacked even the limited manufacturing capabilities that existed in most of the other colonies, and it was the least self-sufficient of any.

As the other delegates argued for unity and conformance with the majority views, he became increasingly outspoken. By October 12, as the debate continued he observed that &quot;Trade is important... Wisdom is better than weapons of war. We don&#x27;t mean to oppose Great Britain, merely for diversion; if it is necessary, that we make war, and that we have the means of it.&quot; When pushed he declared that &quot;A republican government is little better than government of devils.&quot;

By mid-November, Zubly was on his way back to Savannah. The Congress had accused him of disloyalty since he was still carrying on a correspondence with his friend, James Wright, the Royal Governor of Georgia. He resumed his pulpit, and still sought a reconciliation in which Britain would respect colonists&#x27; rights.

==Exile and return==
As the revolutionary fervor rose in Georgia, the Council of Safety decided that his &quot;going at large will... endanger the public safety&quot;. So on July 1, 1776, Archibald Bulloch ordered his arrest, but Zubly was able to escape and find refuge with his family in South Carolina. Half his property was seized, and his library was thrown into the Savannah River by Georgians.

When the British recaptured Savannah in 1778, he was able to return home. Beginning in August 1780, the Savannah newspaper &quot;The Royal Georgia Gazette&quot; published a series of nine essays written by Zubly, who used the pseudonym of Helvetius. In these essays, Zubly laid out his case for opposing the American Revolution. Zubly made the case that the revolutionists were violating both God&#x27;s law and international law. He died in Savannah on July 23, 1781 before the end of the American Revolutionary War. Though it is rumored that he is buried at Savannah&#x27;s Colonial Cemetery, his grave has never been found.

<doc id="450714" wikidata="Q382486" url="?curid=450714" title="Affine cipher">
<text>The affine cipher is a type of monoalphabetic substitution cipher, where each letter in an alphabet is mapped to its numeric equivalent, encrypted using a simple mathematical function, and converted back to a letter. The formula used means that each letter encrypts to one other letter, and back again, meaning the cipher is essentially a standard substitution cipher with a rule governing which letter goes to which. As such, it has the weaknesses of all substitution ciphers. Each letter is enciphered with the function , where is the magnitude of the shift.

==Description==
Here, the letters of an alphabet of size are first mapped to the integers in the range . It then uses modular arithmetic to transform the integer that each plaintext letter corresponds to into another integer that correspond to a ciphertext letter.
The encryption function for a single letter is 
:formula_1
where modulus is the size of the alphabet and and are the keys of the cipher. The value must be chosen such that and are coprime. The decryption function is 
:formula_2
where is the modular multiplicative inverse of modulo . I.e., it satisfies the equation 
:formula_3
The multiplicative inverse of only exists if and are coprime. Hence without the restriction on , decryption might not be possible.
It can be shown as follows that decryption function is the inverse of the encryption function,
:formula_4

==Weaknesses==
Since the affine cipher is still a monoalphabetic substitution cipher, it inherits the weaknesses of that class of ciphers. The Caesar cipher is an Affine cipher with since the encrypting function simply reduces to a linear shift. The Atbash cipher uses .

Considering the specific case of encrypting messages in English (i.e. ), there are a total of 286 non-trivial affine ciphers, not counting the 26 trivial Caesar ciphers. This number comes from the fact there are 12 numbers that are coprime with 26 that are less than 26 (these are the possible values of ). Each value of can have 26 different addition shifts (the value); therefore, there are 12 × 26 or 312 possible keys. This lack of variety renders the system as highly insecure when considered in light of Kerckhoffs&#x27; Principle.

The cipher&#x27;s primary weakness comes from the fact that if the cryptanalyst can discover (by means of frequency analysis, brute force, guessing or otherwise) the plaintext of two ciphertext characters then the key can be obtained by solving a simultaneous equation. Since we know and are relatively prime this can be used to rapidly discard many &quot;false&quot; keys in an automated system.

The same type of transformation used in affine ciphers is used in linear congruential generators, a type of pseudorandom number generator. This generator is not a cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator for the same reason that the affine cipher is not secure.

==Example==
In this example showing encryption and decryption, the alphabet is going to be the letters A through Z, and will have the corresponding values found in the following table.
=== Encryption ===
In this encrypting example, the plaintext to be encrypted is &quot;AFFINE CIPHER&quot; using the table mentioned above for the numeric values of each letter, taking to be 5, to be 8, and to be 26 since there are 26 characters in the alphabet being used. Only the value of has a restriction since it has to be coprime with 26. The possible values that could be are 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, and 25. The value for can be arbitrary as long as does not equal 1 since this is the shift of the cipher. Thus, the encryption function for this example will be . The first step in encrypting the message is to write the numeric values of each letter. 
Now, take each value of , and solve the first part of the equation, . After finding the value of for each character, take the remainder when dividing the result of by 26. The following table shows the first four steps of the encrypting process.

The final step in encrypting the message is to look up each numeric value in the table for the corresponding letters. In this example, the encrypted text would be IHHWVCSWFRCP. The table below shows the completed table for encrypting a message in the Affine cipher.

=== Decryption ===
In this decryption example, the ciphertext that will be decrypted is the ciphertext from the encryption example. The corresponding decryption function is , where is calculated to be 21, and is 8. To begin, write the numeric equivalents to each letter in the ciphertext, as shown in the table below.
Now, the next step is to compute , and then take the remainder when that result is divided by 26. The following table shows the results of both computations.
The final step in decrypting the ciphertext is to use the table to convert numeric values back into letters. The plaintext in this decryption is AFFINECIPHER. Below is the table with the final step completed.
===Entire alphabet encoded===
To make encrypting and decrypting quicker, the entire alphabet can be encrypted to create a one-to-one map between the letters of the cleartext and the ciphertext. In this example, the one-to-one map would be the following:
===Programming examples===
The following Python code encrypts text with the affine cipher:

import string

def affine(a: int, b: int, s: str) -&gt; str:
 &quot;&quot;&quot;Prints a transposition table for an affine cipher.&quot;&quot;&quot;
 D = dict(enumerate(string.ascii_lowercase, start=0))
 E = {v: k for k, v in D.items()}
 size = len(string.ascii_lowercase)
 ret = &quot;&quot;
 print(size)
 for c in s:
 N = E[c]
 val = a * N + b
 val = val % size
 print(f&quot;{c}({N}) -&gt; {D[val]}({val})&quot;)
 ret += D[val]
 return ret

<doc id="450733" wikidata="Q2076679" url="?curid=450733" title="Montreal Locomotive Works">
<text>Montreal Locomotive Works (MLW) was a Canadian railway locomotive manufacturer that existed under several names from 1883 to 1985, producing both steam and diesel locomotives. For many years it was a subsidiary of the American Locomotive Company. MLW&#x27;s headquarters and manufacturing facilities were in Montreal’s Hochelaga-Maisonneuve area (with only the 1911 administration building remaining at 1505 Dickson Street).

== Early history ==

The Locomotive and Machine Company of Montreal Limited was created in 1883, producing primarily for the growing domestic market—notably the Canadian Pacific Railway, the Grand Trunk Railway, the Intercolonial Railway and, after 1922, the Canadian National Railway.

== Purchase by Alco ==
In 1901, the American Locomotive Company (Alco) headquartered in Schenectady, New York, was formed by the merger of several struggling locomotive manufacturers. Alco purchased the Locomotive &amp; Machine Company of Montreal in 1904 to tap into the Canadian market with its emerging designs. The Montreal subsidiary was renamed Montreal Locomotive Works (MLW) several years later.

MLW became an exclusive Alco design shop and acquired a substantial portion of the Canadian steam locomotive market. The period of railway expansion between 1900 and 1915 was unprecedented in Canada, with many new orders for locomotives from various domestic manufacturers. Protective customs tariffs also discouraged Canadian railways from purchasing American-built locomotives for use in Canada. Several bankrupt private systems, including the Grand Trunk and Canadian Northern, were nationalized in the years 1918–1922. Merged with the federally owned Intercolonial, they formed the federal Crown corporation Canadian National Railways. The federal government mandated that the new, larger public company purchase locomotives from all Canadian manufacturers to discourage domination of the market by any one manufacturer.

Between 1918 and the period after the Second World War, Canadian National modernized its steam locomotive fleet by replacing many of the units it had received from its constituent railways. MLW was a major beneficiary of these purchases, along with the Canadian Locomotive Company of Kingston, Ontario. MLW grew substantially during the Second World War when its plant facilities were converted primarily to fabricating matériel for the Commonwealth/Allied war effort (largely by a female workforce), including the Ram tank and the Sexton self-propelled gun.

== Post-war diesel competition ==
Following World War II, MLW and other locomotive builders reverted to building locomotives. MLW continued to benefit from Canada&#x27;s restrictive trade policies that prevented a flood of U.S. imports. However, the transition from steam to diesel-electric locomotive production opened the door to new competitors. In 1949, the Electro-Motive Division of General Motors established a Canadian subsidiary named General Motors Diesel Division (GMDD) in London, Ontario. MLW&#x27;s long-established steam-locomotive competitor, the Canadian Locomotive Company (CLC), had entered into a partnership with Baldwin Locomotive Works and imported and produced the designs of Baldwin and its subsidiary Whitcomb. Westinghouse was the main supplier of Baldwin&#x27;s electrical transmission components. After Baldwin folded, CLC became a licensee of Fairbanks-Morse and manufactured a number of F-M designs for the Canadian market, including the famous Train Master. CLC was also responsible for building General Electric industrial switchers. General Electric did not enter the road diesel-electric market in the United States until the late 1950s, a move it took after dissolving its partnership with Alco in 1953.

== Mass transit ==

In 1960, MLW was awarded the contract to build 36 new subway cars for the Toronto Transit Commission. The M1 Series Subway Cars were notable for being the first ever rapid transit vehicles to be designed and built in Canada. They were also an improvement over the previous rolling stock, being lighter and faster, despite also being considerably larger. MLW&#x27;s venture into rapid transit would be short-lived, as the Toronto Transit Commission opted for Hawker Siddeley Canada vehicles from the mid-1960s onwards to the 1980s.

== Diesel-electric production ==
In 1949, MLW began to introduce its first Alco-GE-derived diesel designs in response to GMD, mostly switchers, some of which were given different names and slight modifications to distinguish between MLW and ALCO-GE versions. In 1951, MLW began to build Alco-GE cab units for freight and passenger service.

Canadian railways continued to rely heavily upon steam locomotives throughout the 1950s, a time when many United States railroads were dieselizing. (Nevertheless, as in Canada, some Class 1 American railroads continued to use modern steam power through 1959, including the Norfolk &amp; Western Railway and the Union Pacific Railroad.) With some isolated exceptions, and as in the United States, Canadian railways were completely dieselized by 1960.

Throughout the 1960s, Canadian National Railway (MLW&#x27;s largest diesel-electric locomotive customer) continued to implement purchase policies drafted by its government owners, which spread procurement among all manufacturers. MLW / Alco-GE road switcher designs were also preferred by several railways in North America due to superior rail adhesion at low speeds, making them especially useful on steeply graded rail lines.

Like GMD in London, MLW benefited from Canadian trade policies that were less restrictive than those of the United States in regard to dealing with countries throughout the decolonizing and developing world, permitting MLW to expand a growing export business.

== MLW-Worthington ==
MLW&#x27;s parent, Alco, experienced several years of declining business during the 1960s following the entry of former-partner General Electric into the road switcher locomotive manufacturing business in the United States. This was due, in part, to continuing reliance on GE&#x27;s high quality electrical components, sold to Alco and MLW at a disadvantageous price by GE. Placed in a similar situation when Westinghouse left the railway rotating equipment market in 1953, Fairbanks-Morse developed its own line of such equipment, although this did not save F-M&#x27;s railway business. GMD&#x27;s transmissions were built to parent GM-EMD&#x27;s designs, which were closely based on earlier GE equipment (prior to 1937). Alco found itself in financial difficulty in 1964 and was purchased by Worthington Corporation, a major manufacturer of equipment for the pulp and paper industry and a former builder of steam locomotive accessories. At that time MLW was renamed MLW-Worthington and continued much as before.

In 1967, Worthington Corporation merged with the Studebaker Corporation, recently exited from the auto business, to form Studebaker-Worthington, with ALCO as a wholly owned subsidiary. In 1968, several divisions of Alco became semi-independent subsidiaries, and in a 1969 corporate reorganization, Studebaker Worthington closed the Schenectady locomotive manufacturing facility. The locomotive designs were transferred in 1969 to MLW-Worthington and the diesel engine designs were sold in 1970 to White Motor Corporation. The Alco diesel engine designs went through several changes in ownership as White Motor Corporation formed White Industrial Power, which was subsequently purchased by the British General Electric Company in 1977. Renamed Alco Power Incorporated by GEC, the designs were, ironically, sold to Fairbanks-Morse in 1994.

In this period, MLW-Worthington partnered with Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada to construct the Turbo Train fleet for Canadian National. It also continued engineering development of the ALCO 251 series engine, producing the M640 4000 hp 18-cylinder prototype for Canadian Pacific in 1972. However, by this time CP had settled on the EMD 645 series SD40 and SD40-2 as their standard locomotive, and there were no further orders forthcoming from that company.

Throughout the early 1970s MLW-Worthington continued to build second-generation designs for Canadian railways. The Canadian Locomotive Company (renamed as Fairbanks-Morse, Canada) had closed in 1969, leaving MLW-Worthington as the primary competitor to the rapidly expanding GMD. During this time, at the behest of Canadian National, MLW-Worthington developed the wide-nosed &quot;safety cab&quot;, which provided improved crew accommodation and collision protection. First appearing on the M-420 and concurrently on the EMD GP38-2, the safety cab became common on Canadian National and the British Columbia Railway. Canadian Pacific, however, never purchased any such units from MLW. This form of cab design became a North American industry standard. Although earlier wide-nosed cab designs on models such as the EMD FP45 and DDA40X bear a superficial resemblance, they lack the advances in collision protection and accommodations of the &quot;safety cab&quot; design.

== Purchase by Bombardier ==
In 1975, the emerging Quebec based Bombardier purchased a 59% stake in MLW from Studebaker-Worthington. Under Bombardier, the MLW organization continued locomotive design into the early 1980s, and also benefited from its geographic location. During the 1970s, Bombardier began to enter the railway passenger car business with domestic orders for commuter and subway systems. Based on a prototype trainset constructed in the mid-1970s, in 1980 MLW began production of a fleet of high-speed diesel-powered passenger locomotives for the LRC (Light, Rapid, Comfortable) passenger trains being built for the newly created federal Crown corporation Via Rail. Similar equipment was also used briefly by Amtrak.The last of the locomotives were retired from service in 2001, although the coaches continue to form the backbone of Via&#x27;s intercity corridor fleet.

By now fully merged into Bombardier, the MLW plant and design bureau also received a spurt of contracts from government-owned Canadian National Railway for the newly designed HR (High Reliability) line of freight locomotives that incorporated the Canadian safety cab or a full-width carbody; namely the 4-axle HR-412 (similar to the M-420) and the full-width carbody 6-axle HR-616.

The HR-616 incorporated another unique design with the &quot;Draper Taper&quot;, named for the designer at CN, allowing for rear visibility from the cab. These locomotive designs were intended to replace aging MLW and GMD units CN had purchased during the late 1960s and early 1970s, although only a token combined order of 30 units were built. These locomotives were considered a failure as they lasted only as long as the units they were designed to replace (mid-1990s) and were considered to be mechanically and electrically unreliable, a common complaint with several ALCO/MLW designs.

In a 1985 corporate reorganization, Bombardier ceased manufacturing locomotives and concentrated on producing passenger train rolling stock (as well as aircraft following the 1986 acquisition of the federal government Crown corporation Canadair), in addition to its recreational products.

The dormant MLW plant was sold to General Electric in 1988 and ironically was used by GE during a late 1980s programme of rebuilding some of its earlier &quot;Universal series&quot; road switchers - the locomotives that had initially driven ALCO out of the locomotive business in the United States in 1969.

GE closed the MLW manufacturing plant in 1993. The GE half of the plant was destroyed by fire in 2001; the other portion of the plant remained in use by the National Research Council of Canada.

In 2004, the remainder of the enormous complex was demolished. The nearby GE-Camco-Westinghouse plant, which is the only Canadian manufacturer of home appliances, bought half of the property to build its new shipping warehouse and a new parts store. Some of the pile of rubble from the former MLW plant can still be seen on the vacant lot east of the corner of Dickson Street and Souligny Avenue.

Bombardier eventually returned to the locomotive manufacturing business, albeit using largely European or European-influenced passenger locomotive designs that retain none of the Alco/MLW heritage. Bombardier&#x27;s North American rail manufacturing facilities are in La Pocatière, Quebec; Plattsburgh, New York; and Thunder Bay, Ontario. In 2021, Bombardier Transportation was sold to Alstom, who continue to manufacture their products.

== Notable locomotives built by MLW ==
MLW built several of Canada&#x27;s most famous locomotives. Most notably, Canadian Pacific 2800 series 4-6-4 Hudson class of locomotives. The 2800s became famous after CPR 2850 pulled the royal train across Canada. Since then, later 2800s (numbered 2820–2864) are known as Royal Hudsons, with royal permission granted from the king.

From 1968 to 1982 Via Rail operated a &quot;TurboTrain&quot; passenger service between Toronto and Montreal. The gas-turbine-powered locomotives had been built by Montreal Locomotive Works.

<text>The is a Japanese daily &quot;broadsheet&quot; newspaper published in mostly Aichi Prefecture and neighboring regions by Based in Nagoya, one of Japanese three major metropolitan areas, it boasts the third circulation after the group newspapers the &quot;Yomiuri Shimbun&quot; and &quot;The Asahi Shimbun&quot;. Even the Chunichi Shimbun alone exceeds the number of copies of the &quot;Sankei Shimbun&quot;. The newspaper is dominant in its region, with a market penetration approaching 60 percent of the population of Aichi Prefecture. The Chunichi Shimbun group also publishes the &quot;Tokyo Shimbun&quot;, the &quot;Chunichi Sports&quot;, and the &quot;Tokyo Chunichi Sports&quot; newspapers. While each newspaper maintains independent leadership and is considered a &quot;separate&quot; paper, the group&#x27;s combined circulation in 2022 was 2,321,414, ranking third in Japan behind the &quot;Yomiuri Shimbun&quot; and the &quot;Asahi Shimbun&quot;.

The &quot;Chunichi Shimbun&quot; is Japan&#x27;s second largest leftist newspaper. It is positioned as a representative newspaper of Nagoya.

It is also the owner of the Chunichi Dragons baseball team.

== History ==
The newspaper was formerly known as &quot;Nagoya Shimbun&quot;. From 1936 to 1940 it owned the Japanese Baseball League team Nagoya Kinko. The paper acquired the Chubu Nihon (now Chunichi Dragons) in 1946.

== Foreign correspondence network ==
The group has thirteen foreign bureaus. They are in New York City, Washington, D.C., London, Paris, Berlin, Moscow, Cairo, Beijing, Shanghai, Taipei, Seoul, Manila, and Bangkok.

== Political position ==
The Chunichi Shimbun holds progressive views, and has political tendencies towards liberalism, social democracy and socialism.

It supported the Japan Socialist Party in the Showa period, the Democratic Party of Japan and Social Democratic Party (Japan) in the Heisei period, and the Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan in the Reiwa period.

The two prewar newspapers (Shin-Aichi and Nagoya Shimbun) were conservative in the Chunichi Shimbun, but the founder, Kissen Kobayashi, ran for the mayor of Nagoya in 1951 at the recommendation of the Japan Socialist Party (first rejected, 1952). It was elected in the year) and changed to a left-leaning newspaper supported by the Japan Socialist Party. The Tokyo Shimbun was once a right wing, but when it was acquired by the Chunichi Shimbun in 1964, it changed to a left-leaning newspaper.

Probably because of this, the mass media reforms led by the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications under the LDP administration in the Showa era (1955 system) were treated coldly, and it was not possible to become a national newspaper and to have its own TV station in Kanto. No (Tokyo 12 channel (currently TV Tokyo) was acquired by the Nikkei, and currently independent stations in the Kanto region such as Tokyo Metropolitan Television and TV Kanagawa are affiliated with the Chunichi Shimbun).

It was the only major newspaper against the Koizumi reforms, and the Asahi Shimbun and others agreed. Chunichi was the only one who opposed the TPP in a major newspaper. It holds a pro-labor union position.

Since the 2011 Fukushima nuclear accident, it has taken a strong anti-nuclear policy. It also has a branch office in Fukushima Prefecture (not officially issued).

As a media company, the Yomiuri Shimbun Group and the Fujisankei Communications Group have a deep relationship with the conservative Liberal Democratic Party, while the Chunichi Group is a liberal newspaper and has a deep relationship with the Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan.

The Asahi Shimbun had a close relationship with the Kōchikai, a moderate faction of the Liberal Democratic Party.

It opposes the revision of the constitution and the prime minister&#x27;s visit to Yasukuni Shrine.

This newspaper is skeptical of the death penalty.

<doc id="450738" wikidata="Q15609" url="?curid=450738" title="20000 Varuna">
<text>20000 Varuna (provisional designation ) is a large trans-Neptunian object in the Kuiper belt. It was discovered in November 2000 by American astronomer Robert McMillan during a Spacewatch survey at the Kitt Peak National Observatory. It is named after the Hindu deity Varuna, one of the oldest deities mentioned in the Vedic texts.

Varuna&#x27;s light curve is compatible with the body being a Jacobi ellipsoid, suggesting that it has an elongated shape due to its rapid rotation. Varuna&#x27;s surface is moderately red in color due to the presence of complex organic compounds on its surface. Water ice is also present on its surface, and is thought to have been exposed by past collisions which may have also caused Varuna&#x27;s rapid rotation. Although no natural satellites have been found or directly imaged around Varuna, analysis of variations in its light curve in 2019 suggests the presence of a possible satellite orbiting closely around Varuna. Assumptions that the body is in hydrostatic equilibrium (and thus a dwarf planet) result in a calculated density too low for it to be a likely dwarf planet.

== History ==
=== Discovery ===

Varuna was discovered by American astronomer Robert McMillan using the Spacewatch 0.9-meter telescope during a routine survey on 28 November 2000. The Spacewatch survey was conducted by McMillan at the Kitt Peak National Observatory near Tucson, Arizona. At the time of discovery, Varuna was located at a moderately dense star field close to the northern galactic equator. Although Varuna was not detected by McMillan&#x27;s real-time computer software, he was able to identify Varuna moving slowly among the background stars by manually comparing multiple scans of the same region using the blinking technique. After McMillan&#x27;s observing shift, follow-up observations of Varuna were conducted by astronomer Jeffrey Larsen in order to confirm the object. By the end of Larsen&#x27;s observing shift, both McMillan and Larsen had made a total of 12 observations that spanned three nights.

The discovery of Varuna was formally announced in a Minor Planet Electronic Circular on 1 December 2000. It was given the provisional designation , indicating that it was discovered during the second half of November 2000. Varuna was the 2667th object observed in the latter half of November, as indicated by the last letter and numbers in its provisional designation. At the time, Varuna was thought to be one of the largest and brightest minor planets in the Solar System due to its relatively high apparent magnitude of 20 for a distant object, which implied that it might be around one-fourth the size of Pluto and comparable in size to the dwarf planet .

Subsequently, after the announcement of Varuna&#x27;s discovery, precovery images of Varuna were found by German astronomers Andre Knofel and Reiner Stoss at the Palomar Observatory. One particular precovery image, which was taken with the Palomar Observatory&#x27;s Big Schmidt telescope in 1955, showed that Varuna was located three degrees away from its extrapolated location based on the approximate circular orbit determined in December 2000. The oldest known precovery image of Varuna was taken on 24 November 1954. These precovery images along with additional observations from Japan, Hawaii, and Arizona helped astronomers refine its orbit and determine Varuna&#x27;s proper classification.

In January 2001, Varuna was assigned the minor planet number 20000 by the Minor Planet Center as its orbit was well determined from precovery images and subsequent observations. The minor planet number 20000 was particularly chosen to commemorate Varuna&#x27;s large size, being the largest classical Kuiper belt object known at that time and was believed to be as large as Ceres. The number 20000 was also chosen to commemorate the coincidental 200th anniversary of the discovery of Ceres, which occurred in the same month as the numbering of Varuna.

=== Name ===
Varuna is named after the eponymous Hindu deity Varuna, following the International Astronomical Union naming convention for non-resonant Kuiper belt objects after creator deities. The name was proposed by Indian choreographer Mrinalini Sarabhai, and was approved by the IAU in March 2001. Varuna is one of the oldest Vedic deities of Hindu literature, being mentioned in the earliest hymns of the &quot;Rigveda&quot;. In Hindu literature, Varuna created and presided over the waters of the heaven and of the ocean. Varuna is the king of gods and men and the universe, and has unlimited knowledge.

Planetary symbols are no longer much used in astronomy, so Varuna never received a symbol in the astronomical literature. There is no standard symbol for Varuna used by astrologers either. Denis Moskowitz, a software engineer in Massachusetts who designed the symbols for most of the dwarf planets, proposed a symbol for Varuna (): it derives from the Devanagari letter &quot;va&quot; व and Varuna&#x27;s snake-lasso. This symbol is occasionally mentioned on astrology websites, but is not broadly used. Another sometimes seen is a variant of Neptune ( with a globe and outward-facing tines), as Varuna is the Hindu equivalent of Neptune.

== Orbit and classification ==
Varuna orbits the Sun at an average distance of , taking 279 years to complete a full orbit. Its orbit is nearly circular, with a low orbital eccentricity of 0.056. Due to its low orbital eccentricity, its distance from the Sun varies slightly over the course of its orbit. Varuna&#x27;s minimum distance possible (MOID) from Neptune is 12.04 AU. Over the course of its orbit, Varuna&#x27;s distance from the Sun ranges from 40.3 AU at perihelion (closest distance) to 45.1 AU at aphelion (farthest distance). Varuna&#x27;s orbit is inclined to the ecliptic by 17 degrees, similar to Pluto&#x27;s orbital inclination. Varuna had passed its perihelion in 1928 and is currently moving away from the Sun, approaching aphelion by 2071.

With a nearly circular orbit at around 40 to 50 AU, Varuna is classified as a classical Kuiper belt object (KBO). Varuna&#x27;s semi-major axis of 42.8 AU is similar to that of other large classical KBOs such as Quaoar (a=43.7 AU) and Makemake (a=45.6 AU), although other orbital characteristics such as inclination widely differ. Varuna is a member of the &quot;dynamically hot&quot; class of classical KBOs, meaning that it has an orbital inclination greater than 4 degrees, the imposed maximum inclination for dynamically cold members of its population. As a classical KBO, Varuna is not in orbital resonance with Neptune and is also free from any significant perturbation by Neptune.

== Rotation ==

Varuna has a rapid rotation period of approximately 6.34 hours, derived from a double-peaked solution for Varuna&#x27;s rotational light curve. Varuna&#x27;s rotation was first measured January 2001 by astronomer Tony Farnham using the McDonald Observatory&#x27;s 2.1-meter telescope, as part of a study on the rotation and colors of distant objects. CCD photometry of Varuna&#x27;s light curve in 2001 revealed that it displays large brightness variations with an amplitude of about 0.5 magnitudes. The measured rotational light curve of Varuna provided two ambiguous rotation periods of 3.17 and 6.34 hours, for a single-peaked and a double-peaked solution, respectively. Additional possible rotation periods of 2.79 and 3.66 hours were also obtained by Farnham, although these values could not be ruled out at the time.

A single-peaked interpretation of Varuna&#x27;s rotational light curve (3.17 h) would assume a spherical shape for Varuna, with albedo features on its surface that would account for its brightness variations. However, in order for this interpretation to be valid, Varuna must have a density much greater than (roughly the density of water), otherwise it would deform and break apart as the given rotation period exceeds the critical rotation rate of ~3.3 hours for a body with a density of . A double-peaked interpretation of Varuna&#x27;s rotational light curve (6.34 h) would assume that Varuna&#x27;s shape is an elongated ellipsoid, with an estimated &quot;a&quot;/&quot;b&quot; aspect ratio of 1.5–1.6. The rotational light curve of Varuna was later investigated by astronomers David Jewitt and Scott Sheppard during February and April 2001, and concluded that the double-peaked interpretation for Varuna&#x27;s light curve is the most plausible solution due to the absence of rotational variation in Varuna&#x27;s color in the visible spectrum.

Examination of past photometric observations of Varuna&#x27;s light curve has shown that its light curve amplitude had increased by roughly 0.13 magnitudes from 2001 to 2019. This increase in amplitude is due to the combined effects of Varuna&#x27;s ellipsoidal shape, rotation, and varying phase angle. Geometric models for Varuna&#x27;s changing amplitude have provided several possible solutions for the orientation of Varuna&#x27;s rotational poles in ecliptic coordinates, with the best-fit solution adopting a spin axis right ascension and declination of 54° and −65°, respectively. The best-fit pole orientation of Varuna implies that it is being viewed at a near-edge on configuration, in which Varuna&#x27;s equator nearly faces directly toward Earth.

Varuna&#x27;s rapid rotation is believed to have resulted from disruptive collisions that have sped up its rotation during the formation of the Solar System. The present collision rate in the trans-Neptunian region is minimal, though collisions were more frequent during the formation of the Solar System. However, Jewitt and Sheppard calculated that the rate of disruptive collisions among large trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs) during the Solar System&#x27;s formation is extremely uncommon, contradictory to the current abundance of binary and rapidly rotating TNOs that are believed to have originated from such collisions. To explain the abundance of binary and rapidly rotating TNOs, the rate of collisions among TNOs had likely increased as a result of Neptune&#x27;s outward migration perturbing the orbits of TNOs, thus increasing the frequency of collisions which may have led to Varuna&#x27;s rapid rotation.

== Physical characteristics ==
=== Size and shape ===

As a result of its rapid rotation, the shape of Varuna is deformed into a triaxial ellipsoid. Given the rapid rotation, rare for objects so large, Varuna&#x27;s shape is described as a Jacobi ellipsoid, with an &quot;a&quot;/&quot;b&quot; aspect ratio of around 1.5–1.6 (in which Varuna&#x27;s longest semi-axis &quot;a&quot; is 1.5–1.6 times longer than its &quot;b&quot; semi-axis). Examination of Varuna&#x27;s light curve has found that the best-fit model for Varuna&#x27;s shape is a triaxial ellipsoid with the semi-axes &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, and &quot;c&quot; in ratios in the range of &quot;b&quot;/&quot;a&quot; = 0.63–0.80, and &quot;c&quot;/&quot;a&quot; = 0.45–0.52.

Due to Varuna&#x27;s ellipsoidal shape, multiple observations have provided different estimates for its diameter, ranging from . Most diameter estimates for Varuna were determined by measuring its thermal emission, although size estimates have been constrained to smaller values as a result of higher albedos determined by space-based thermal measurements. Observations of stellar occultations by Varuna have also provided varying size estimates. An occultation by Varuna in February 2010 yielded a chord length of , inferred to be across its longest axis. Later occultations in 2013 and 2014 yielded mean diameters of and respectively.

Since the discovery of Varuna, , another larger rapidly rotating (3.9 h) object over twice the size of Varuna, has been discovered and is also thought to have an elongated shape, albeit slightly less pronounced (estimated ratios of &quot;b&quot;/&quot;a&quot; = 0.76~0.88, and &quot;c&quot;/&quot;a&quot; = 0.50~0.55, possibly due to a higher estimated density approximately ).

==== Unlikely to be a dwarf planet ====

Astronomer Gonzalo Tancredi considered Varuna likely to be a dwarf planet and a Jacobi ellipsoid in shape. Based on a best-fit Jacobi ellipsoid model for Varuna, Lacerda and Jewitt estimate that Varuna has a quite low density, of , just under Tancredi&#x27;s minimum density criterion. Despite this, they assumed Varuna was in hydrostatic equilibrium for their calculations. Astronomer William Grundy and colleagues propose that dark, low-density TNOs around the size range of approximately are likely to be uncompressed, partially porous bodies. While the larger objects in this range, such as Varuna, may have fully collapsed into solid material in their interiors, their surfaces likely remain uncompressed. That is, they would not be in hydrostatic equilibrium and not dwarf planets.

==== Thermal measurements ====

Ground observations of Varuna&#x27;s thermal emission from 2000 to 2005 yielded large diameter estimates ranging from to , making it comparable to the size of Ceres. Contrary to the ground-based estimates, space-based thermal observations from the Spitzer Space Telescope provided a smaller diameter range of . The discrepancy between ground-based and space-based size estimates are due to the limited observable wavelengths for ground-based observations, as a result of absorption of Earth&#x27;s atmosphere. Distant trans-Neptunian objects such as Varuna intrinsically emit thermal radiation at longer wavelengths due to their low temperatures. However, at long wavelengths, thermal radiation cannot pass through Earth&#x27;s atmosphere and ground-based observations could only measure weak thermal emissions from Varuna at near-infrared and submillimeter wavelengths, hindering the accuracy of ground-based thermal measurements.

Space-based observations provided more accurate thermal measurements as they are able to measure thermal emissions at a broad range of wavelengths that are normally interfered by Earth&#x27;s atmosphere. Preliminary thermal measurements with Spitzer in 2005 provided a higher albedo constraint of 0.12 to 0.3, corresponding to a smaller diameter constraint of . Further Spitzer thermal measurements at multiple wavelength ranges (bands) in 2007 yielded mean diameter estimates around and for a single-band and two-band solution for the data, respectively. From these results, the adopted mean diameter was . Follow-up multi-band thermal observations from the Herschel Space Observatory in 2013 yielded a mean diameter of , consistent with previous constraints on Varuna&#x27;s diameter.

==== Occultations ====

Previous attempted observations of stellar occultations by Varuna in 2005 and 2008 were unsuccessful due to uncertainties in Varuna&#x27;s proper motion along with undesirable conditions for observing. In 2010, an occultation by Varuna was successfully observed by a team of astronomers led by Bruno Sicardy on the night of 19 February. The occultation was observed from various regions in southern Africa and north-eastern Brazil. Although observations of the occultation from South Africa and Namibia had negative results, observations from Brazil, particularly at São Luís in Maranhão, successfully detected a occultation by Varuna of an 11.1 magnitude star. The occultation yielded a chord length of , quite large compared to mean diameter estimates from thermal measurements. Because the occultation occurred near Varuna&#x27;s maximum brightness, the occultation was observing the maximum apparent surface area for an ellipsoidal shape; the longest axis of Varuna&#x27;s shape was observed during the occultation. São Luís was also located very close to the predicted centerline of Varuna&#x27;s shadow path, meaning the chord length was close to the longest measurable during the event, closely constraining the possible maximum equatorial diameter.

Results from the same event from Camalaú, Paraíba, approximately south (and on what was predicted to be the very southern extent of the shadow path), showed a 28-second occultation, corresponding to an approximately chord, much longer than might otherwise have been expected. However, Quixadá, south of São Luís–between it and Camalaú–paradoxically had a negative result. To account for the negative Quixadá results, the apparent oblateness (flattening) of Varuna was imposed at a minimum value of approximately 0.56 (aspect ratio &quot;c&quot;/&quot;a&quot; ≤ 0.44), corresponding to a minimum polar dimension of approximately , based on the given chord length of . The resulting lower bound on Varuna&#x27;s polar dimension is approximately equal to Lacerda and Jewitt&#x27;s lower bound &quot;c&quot;/&quot;a&quot; aspect ratio of 0.45, which they previously calculated in 2007. A preliminary conference presentation, given before the Camalaú results were fully analyzed, concluded that the São Luís and Quixadá results together suggested a significantly elongated shape is required for Varuna.

Later occultations in 2013 and 2014 yielded mean diameters of and , respectively. The mean diameter of , calculated from both chords from the occultations, appears seemingly consistent with the Spitzer and Herschel thermal measurement of . While the apparent oblateness of Varuna could not be determined from the single chord obtained from the 2014 occultation, the 2013 occultation yielded two chords, corresponding to an apparent oblateness of approximately 0.29. The imposed oblateness for the 2013 chord length of as Varuna&#x27;s diameter corresponds to a polar dimension of approximately , somewhat consistent with the calculated 2010 minimum polar dimension of .

=== Spectra and surface ===

Varuna&#x27;s spectrum was first analyzed in early 2001 with the Near Infrared Camera Spectrometer (NICS) at the Galileo National Telescope in Spain. Spectral observations of Varuna at near-infrared wavelengths revealed that the surface of Varuna is moderately red and displays a red spectral slope between the wavelength range of 0.9 and 1.8 μm. Varuna&#x27;s spectrum also exhibits strong absorption bands at wavelengths of 1.5 and 2 μm, indicating the presence of water ice on its surface.

The red color of Varuna&#x27;s surface results from the photolysis of organic compounds being irradiated by sunlight and cosmic rays. The irradiation of organic compounds such as methane on Varuna&#x27;s surface produces tholins, which are known to reduce its surface reflectivity (albedo) and are expected to cause its spectrum to appear featureless. Compared to , which was observed along with Varuna in 2001, it appears less red and displays more apparent water ice absorption bands, suggesting that Varuna&#x27;s surface is relatively fresh and had maintained some of its original material in its surface. The fresh appearance of Varuna&#x27;s surface may have resulted from collisions that have exposed fresh water ice beneath Varuna&#x27;s layer of tholins above its surface.

Another study of Varuna&#x27;s spectra at near-infrared wavelengths in 2008 yielded a featureless spectrum with a blue spectral slope, contrary to earlier results in 2001. The spectra obtained in 2008 showed no clear indication of water ice, contradictory to the 2001 results. The discrepancy between the two results was interpreted as an indication of surface variation on Varuna, though this possibility was later ruled out by a 2014 study of Varuna&#x27;s spectra. The 2014 results closely matched the previous spectra obtained in 2001, implying that the featureless spectra obtained in 2008 is likely erroneous.

Models for Varuna&#x27;s spectrum suggest that its surface is most likely formed of a mixture of amorphous silicates (25%), complex organic compounds (35%), amorphous carbon (15%) and water ice (25%), with a possibility of up to 10% methane ice. For an object with a size similar to Varuna, the presence of volatile methane could not be primordial as Varuna is not massive enough to retain volatiles on its surface. An event that had occurred subsequently after Varuna&#x27;s formation–such as an energetic impact–would likely account for the presence of methane on Varuna&#x27;s surface. Additional near-infrared observations of Varuna&#x27;s spectra were conducted at the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility in 2017 and have identified absorption features between 2.2 and 2.5 μm that might be associated with ethane and ethylene, based on preliminary analysis. For mid-sized bodies such as Varuna, volatiles such as ethane and ethylene are more likely to be retained than lighter volatiles such as methane according to volatile retention theories formulated by astronomers Schaller and Brown in 2007.

==== Brightness ====

Varuna&#x27;s apparent magnitude, its brightness as seen from Earth, varies from 19.5 to 20 magnitudes. At opposition, its apparent magnitude can reach up 20.3 magnitudes. Combined thermal measurements from the Spitzer Space Telescope and the Herschel Space Observatory in 2013 obtained a visual absolute magnitude (&quot;HV&quot;) of 3.76, comparable to that of the similarly-sized Kuiper belt object (&quot;HV&quot;=3.83). Varuna is among the twenty brightest trans-Neptunian objects known, despite the Minor Planet Center assuming an absolute magnitude of 3.6.

The surface of Varuna is dark, with a measured geometric albedo of 0.127 based on thermal observations in 2013. Varuna&#x27;s geometric albedo is similar to that of the possible dwarf planet , which has a geometric albedo of 0.109. Varuna was initially thought to have a much lower geometric albedo, as early ground observations of Varuna&#x27;s thermal emissions from 2000 to 2005 estimated albedo values ranging from 0.04 to 0.07, around eight times darker than Pluto&#x27;s albedo. Later thermal measurements of Varuna with space-based telescopes refuted these previous albedo measurements: Spitzer measured a higher geometric albedo of 0.116 while further thermal measurements from Spitzer and Herschel in 2013 estimated a geometric albedo of 0.127.

Photometric observations of Varuna in 2004 and 2005 were carried out to observe changes in Varuna&#x27;s light curve caused by opposition surges when the phase angle of Varuna approaches zero degrees at opposition. The photometry results showed that Varuna&#x27;s light curve amplitude had decreased to 0.2 magnitudes at opposition, less than its overall amplitude of 0.42 magnitudes. The photometry results also showed an increase in asymmetry of Varuna&#x27;s light curve near opposition, indicating variations of scattering properties over its surface. The opposition surge of Varuna differs from those of dark asteroids, which gradually becomes more pronounced near opposition in contrast to Varuna&#x27;s narrow opposition surge, in which its light curve amplitude sharply changes within a phase angle of 0.5 degrees. The opposition surges of other Solar System bodies with moderate albedos behave similarly to Varuna, indirectly suggesting that Varuna might have a higher albedo in contrast to ground-based albedo estimates. This implication of a higher albedo for Varuna was confirmed in subsequent thermal measurements from Spitzer and Herschel.

=== Internal structure ===
Varuna is estimated to have a bulk density of , marginally less than that of water (). Varuna&#x27;s low bulk density is likely due to a porous internal structure composed of a nearly proportional ratio of water ice and rock. To explain its porous internal structure and composition, Lacerda and Jewitt suggested that Varuna may have a granular internal structure. Varuna&#x27;s granular internal structure is thought to have resulted from fractures caused by past collisions likely responsible for its rapid rotation. Other objects including Saturn&#x27;s moons Tethys and Iapetus are also known to have a similarly low density, with a porous internal structure and a composition that is predominantly water ice and rock. William Grundy and colleagues proposed that dark, low-density TNOs around the size range of approximately are transitional between smaller, porous (and thus low-density) bodies and larger, denser, brighter and geologically differentiated planetary bodies (such as dwarf planets). The internal structures of low-density TNOs, such as Varuna, had only partially differentiated, as their likely rocky interiors had not reached sufficient temperatures to melt and collapse into pore spaces since formation. As a result, most mid-sized TNOs had remained internally porous, thus resulting in low densities. In this case, Varuna may not be in hydrostatic equilibrium.

== Possible satellite ==

Photometric observations of Varuna&#x27;s light curve, led by Valenzuela and colleagues in 2019, indicate that a possible satellite might be orbiting Varuna at a close distance. By using the Fourier analysis method of combining four separate light curves obtained in 2019, they derived a lower quality light curve amplitude with a greater amount of residuals. Their result indicated that Varuna&#x27;s light curve experiences subtle changes over time. They plotted the residuals of the combined light curve in a Lomb periodogram and derived an orbital period of 11.9819 hours for the possible satellite. The satellite varies in brightness by 0.04 magnitudes as it orbits Varuna. Under the assumption that Varuna&#x27;s density is and the satellite is tidally locked, the team estimates that it orbits Varuna at a distance of , just beyond the estimated Roche limit of Varuna (~). Due to the satellite&#x27;s close proximity to Varuna, it is not yet possible to resolve it with space-based telescopes such as the Hubble Space Telescope as the angular distance between Varuna and the satellite is smaller than the resolution of current space-based telescopes. Although direct observations of Varuna&#x27;s satellite are unfeasible with current telescopes, Varuna&#x27;s equator is being directly viewed at an edge-on configuration, implying that mutual events between the satellite and Varuna could possibly occur in the future.

== Exploration ==
Planetary scientist Amanda Zangari calculated that a flyby mission to Varuna could take just over 12 years using a Jupiter gravity assist, based on a launch date of 2035 or 2038. Alternative trajectories using gravity assists from Jupiter, Saturn, or Uranus have been also considered. A trajectory using gravity assists from Jupiter and Uranus could take just over 13 years, based on a launch date of 2034 or 2037, whereas a trajectory using gravity assists from Saturn and Uranus could take under 18 years, based on an earlier launch date of 2025 or 2029. Varuna would be approximately 45 AU from the Sun when the spacecraft arrives before 2050, regardless of the trajectories used.

<doc id="450739" wikidata="Q7816377" url="?curid=450739" title="Tom Joyner">
<text>Thomas Joyner (born November 23, 1949) is an American radio personality, host, philanthropist and former musician. Joyner is the former host of the nationally syndicated &quot;The Tom Joyner Morning Show&quot;, and also founder of Reach Media Inc., the Tom Joyner Foundation, and BlackAmericaWeb.com.

==Early life==
Joyner was born in Tuskegee, Alabama, the son of Frances and Hercules L. Joyner. Tom came from an educated family: his grandfather Oscar was one of only 3,000 black physicians in the United States, earning a degree in medicine in 1909. Both of his parents were graduates of historically black colleges, and both Tom and his brother Albert attended Tuskegee Institute, now known as Tuskegee University. Tom Joyner graduated with a degree in sociology. While a student at Tuskegee, Joyner joined the fraternity Omega Psi Phi. At first, his goal was to be a musician, and he joined a band, the Commodores, that included his college friend Lionel Richie, but the band did not make any money and his family encouraged him to seek another way to make a living.

==Radio career==
Joyner had been involved in college radio and began his broadcasting career in Montgomery, Alabama immediately upon graduation, and worked at a number of radio stations in the South and Midwest, including stations in Dallas, Memphis and St. Louis, before moving to Chicago in early 1978. In Chicago, he first worked at WVON, doing the morning show, but left the station after only three months to work at a competitor, WBMX-FM. By late July 1978, however, he had been hired away by Charles Mootry, general manager of station WJPC (AM) (now WNTD). This station, named for &quot;Johnson Publishing Company&quot;, was owned by John H. Johnson, publisher of &quot;Jet&quot; and &quot;Ebony&quot;. Joyner hosted the morning show at WJPC and, while there, gained his first national television exposure as the first host of the syndicated magazine series &quot;Ebony/Jet Celebrity Showcase&quot;.

In 1983, Joyner returned to Dallas to become morning host at KKDA-FM. Two years later, he was offered an afternoon show at WGCI-FM in Chicago. Instead of choosing between the two, Joyner chose to take the Chicago position while simultaneously remaining at the Dallas station. For eight years (1985–1993) he commuted daily by plane between the two cities, earning him the nicknames &quot;The Fly Jock&quot; and &quot;The Hardest Working Man in Radio&quot;. He later told &quot;Radio Ink&quot; magazine that he racked up seven million frequent flyer miles over the course of his employment at both stations; a travel agent had found him a $30,000 fare that would guarantee him a round-trip seat for five years. Joyner was able to work for both stations concurrently since neither of his two employment contracts had an exclusivity clause.

In 1994, Joyner was signed by ABC Radio Networks to host a nationally syndicated program, &quot;The Tom Joyner Morning Show&quot;, featuring Joyner and a team of comedians and commentators reporting and discussing the latest news and sports of the day, and playing popular R&amp;B songs from the 1970s through the 1990s as well as contemporary R&amp;B hits. Also featured were celebrity guests, on-site remotes (called &quot;Sky Shows&quot;), and an on-air soap opera, &quot;It&#x27;s Your World&quot; which is currently not aired. Southwest Airlines is a prominent sponsor of the radio show, especially Joyner&#x27;s &quot;Sky Shows&quot;, and free round-trip airfare to any destination that Southwest flies to was a recurring giveaway on his show.

Upon signing a contract extension with Westwood on October 17, 2017, Joyner announced that he would retire at the agreement&#x27;s end (2019), declaring &quot;I&#x27;m retiring, and for the next two years we&#x27;re going to reminisce, go down Memory Lane and talk about all the things that we&#x27;ve done for the past 25 years.&quot; He retired from his morning show on December 13, 2019.

==&quot;The Tom Joyner Show&quot;==
In 2005, a nationally syndicated television show, &quot;The Tom Joyner Show&quot;, was launched with Joyner as emcee of a one-hour comedy/variety show, combining sketch comedy featuring the Tom Joyner Show Players (his co-hosts from the radio show), talent contests, and musical performances by such artists as Patti LaBelle; Earth, Wind and Fire; Brian McKnight; Kenneth &quot;Babyface&quot; Edmonds; and Toni Braxton. The show attracted advertisers such as McDonald&#x27;s, Chrysler Corporation, Walmart and Southwest Airlines.

While the program achieved top ratings for a weekly syndicated program themed to African American viewers — even taking the number one show position, although it was in a late night time slot — in such markets as New York and Atlanta, affiliates in other markets were reluctant to upgrade the show to prime time for a targeted audience. Without the opportunity to reach a larger audience in earlier time slots and achieve greater revenues, the show had limited ability to offset the residuals and music clearances required by the many performers appearing on the show. Despite award recognition, in May 2006, Joyner decided not to continue due to production costs related to the music variety show concept. Re-runs are shown on TV One cable channel. As for his radio career, Tom Joyner continues to be an influential broadcaster: the &quot;TJMS&quot; is heard live in over 100 cities, both on-air and via streaming audio, through its syndicator, Reach Media.

==The Tom Joyner Foundation==
Capitalizing on the popularity of the &quot;Tom Joyner Morning Show&quot;, Joyner founded The Tom Joyner Foundation. The mission of the foundation is to support historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs) through student scholarship, endowment, and capacity building enhancements. In the foundation&#x27;s first month, $20,000 was raised in &#x27;Dollars for Scholars&#x27; scholarship money. Since 1998, it has raised more than $65 million to help keep students enrolled at HBCUs.

The charitable foundation prides itself in having the capability of providing donors specifics of what institution and what student is on the receiving end. The Tom Joyner Foundation also hosts an annual cruise named the Fantastic Voyage which also raises money for HBCUs.

=== Scholarships ===

;The Hercules Scholarships

The Hercules Scholarship, named after Tom Joyner&#x27;s late father, targets male HBCU students enrolled in the School of the Month program. The $1500 scholarship is awarded every Thursday to scholars selected by the School of the Month. Past schools include Dillard University, Stillman College, North Carolina A&amp;T, and more.

;Full Ride Scholarship

The Full Ride Scholarship is awarded to one freshman entering a HBCU each year, in recognition of academic distinction and personal qualities.

=== Programs ===

;Veterans Education Program

Central State University in Wilberforce, Ohio, partnered with the foundation by donating $10,000 to jumpstart the program that offers support in the following areas:

* Education – Help veterans find appropriate classes and other programs to complete their undergraduate degrees or pursue advanced degrees.
* Counseling – Assist veterans in coordinating programs with Veteran Affairs departments at colleges, local, state and federal agencies.
* Supportive services – Assist veterans with housing, career, child care, and transitioning into mainstream life

;&quot;Global Education&quot;

The Institute for Shipboard Education (ISE), which administers the Semester at Sea study abroad program, partnered with The Tom Joyner Foundation (TJF) to fund two full scholarships for students attending historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs) to participate in global voyages. ISE and TJF believe that international exposure is a critical element in today&#x27;s undergraduate education, offering students a real-life global education experience that will give them an edge in this highly competitive job market. The program is open to students, regardless of their major.

;Teacher Quality

The foundation is rekindling its partnership with the National Education Association for its Teacher Quality Program, formerly known as the Teacher Certification Program. The program is designed to create new K–12 teachers from HBCU students with a STEM focus.

;Art Legacy

As part of its partnerships with black artists, the foundation is celebrating their contributions to HBCUs, the art world and society. These artists&#x27; works will be featured throughout the year on its website as well as selling limited editions of some of its pieces.

==Books and other media==
In 2005 Warner Books published &quot;I&#x27;m Just a DJ but ... It Makes Sense to Me&quot; written with his longtime writer, Mary Flowers Boyce. The book chronicles his childhood and early days in radio as well as offers Joyner&#x27;s thoughts on Historically Black Colleges and Universities (&quot;HBCUs&quot;), the power of the black consumer and fatherhood. In February 2009, Amber Books published &quot;Tom Joyner Presents How to Prepare for College&quot;, a primer for parents and their children offering specific suggests and advice. The book features a foreword written by Joyner with writers Wil and Thomas LaVeist. He appeared with his father and grandfather in the documentary &quot;Rising from the Rails: The Story of the Pullman Porter&quot; crediting his family with passing down important values which he passed down to his sons as well. His grandfather Oscar &quot;Doc&quot; Joyner was a Pullman porter who became a medical doctor.

Tom Joyner has had cameo roles in two films-&quot;The Gospel&quot; (2005) and &quot;Madea Goes to Jail&quot; (2009). During the early 1980s he was a host of the &quot;Ebony/Jet Showcase&quot;, a syndicated television magazine program. He also had another television show, &quot;The Tom Joyner Sky Show&quot; (2003), and has appeared on many other television programs.

==Personal life==
With his first wife Dora, Joyner has two sons, Thomas Jr. and Oscar, whom he calls &quot;Killer&quot; and &quot;Thriller&quot;. After divorcing his first wife, he married celebrity aerobics instructor-fitness expert Donna Richardson in July 2000. The two divorced in May 2012. Joyner is a descendant of North Carolina Supreme Court justice John Hall, and, according to a DNA analysis performed by African Ancestry Inc., is also descended partially from the Balanta people of Guinea-Bissau.

===Philanthropy===
Joyner has been an advocate for voter registration and throughout the year promotes voter registration over the air, on his website and during his live &quot;Sky Shows&quot; broadcasts. To improve healthy living, Joyner holds a &quot;Take a Loved One to the Doctor Day&quot; every April or September. On that day, he rallies families and friends to go to the doctor to get a check-up to prevent any health problems, and particularly treat any existing issues. Joyner participated in the 2011 Alzheimer&#x27;s Association Walk to End Alzheimer&#x27;s to raise awareness and funds for Alzheimer&#x27;s research, care and support.

==Awards==
On October 7, 2004, Joyner was awarded the NAB Marconi Radio Award. In 1998, Joyner was the first African American to be inducted into The National Radio Hall of Fame in Chicago, Illinois. Joyner was inducted into the International Civil Rights Walk of Fame at the Martin Luther King, Jr. National Historic Site on January 12, 2008. Joyner was inducted into The Official R&amp;B Music Hall of Fame on August 17, 2013, in Cleveland, Ohio, at Cleveland State University. On June 28, 2015, Joyner was awarded the Humanitarian Award at the 2015 BET Awards.

<doc id="450749" wikidata="Q81242" url="?curid=450749" title="Sea breeze">
<text>A sea breeze or onshore breeze is any wind that blows from a large body of water toward or onto a landmass. By contrast, a land breeze or offshore breeze is any wind that blows from a landmass toward or onto a large body of water. Sea breezes and land breezes are both important factors in coastal regions&#x27; prevailing winds.

Sea breeze and land breeze develop due to differences in air pressure created by the differing heat capacities of water and dry land. As such, sea breezes and land breezes are more localised than prevailing winds. Since land heats up much faster than water under solar radiation, a sea breeze is a common occurrence along coasts after sunrise. On the other hand, dry land also cools faster than water without solar radiation, so the wind instead flows from the land towards the sea when the sea breeze dissipates after sunset.

The land breeze at nighttime is usually shallower than the sea breeze in daytime. Unlike the daytime sea breeze, which is driven by convection, the nighttime land breeze is driven by convergence.

The term offshore wind refers to any wind over open water, which is related to but not synonymous with offshore breeze.

==Causes==

=== Sea breeze ===
The sea has a greater heat capacity than land, so the surface of the sea warms up more slowly than the surface of the land. As the temperature of the surface of the land rises, the land heats the air above it by convection. The hypsometric equation states that the hydrostatic pressure depends on the temperature. Thus, the hydrostatic pressure over the land decreases less at higher altitude. As the air above the coast has a relatively higher pressure, it starts moving towards the sea at high altitude. This creates an inverse airflow near the ground. The strength of the sea breeze is directly proportional to the temperature difference between the land and the sea. If a strong offshore wind is present (that is, a wind greater than ) and opposing the direction of a possible sea breeze, the sea breeze is not likely to develop.

=== Land breeze ===
At night, the land cools off faster than the ocean due to differences in their heat capacity, which forces the dying of the daytime sea breeze as the temperature of the land approaches that of the ocean. If the land becomes cooler than the adjacent sea surface temperature, the air pressure over the water will be lower than that of the land, setting up a land breeze blowing from the land to the sea, as long as the environmental surface wind pattern is not strong enough to oppose it.

==Effects==

=== Sea breeze ===

A sea-breeze front is a weather front created by a sea breeze, also known as a convergence zone. The cold air from the sea meets the warmer air from the land and creates a boundary like a shallow cold front. When powerful this front creates cumulus clouds, and if the air is humid and unstable, the front can sometimes trigger thunderstorms. If the flow aloft is aligned with the direction of the sea breeze, places experiencing the sea breeze frontal passage will have benign, or fair, weather for the remainder of the day. At the front warm air continues to flow upward and cold air continually moves in to replace it and so the front moves progressively inland. Its speed depends on whether it is assisted or hampered by the prevailing wind, and the strength of the thermal contrast between land and sea. At night, the sea breeze usually changes to a land breeze, due to a reversal of the same mechanisms.

==== Sea breezes in Florida ====

Thunderstorms caused by powerful sea breeze fronts frequently occur in Florida, a peninsula bounded on the east and west by the Atlantic Ocean and Gulf of Mexico, respectively. During the wet season, which typically lasts from June through September/October, any direction that the winds are blowing would always be off the water, thus making Florida the place most often struck by lightning in the United States, and one of the most on Earth. These storms can also produce significant hail due to the tremendous updraft it causes in the atmosphere especially during times when the upper atmosphere is cooler such as during the spring or fall.

On calm summer afternoons with little prevailing wind, sea breezes from both coasts may collide in the middle, creating especially severe storms down the center of the state. These thunderstorms can drift towards either the west or east coast depending on the relative strengths of the sea breezes, and sometimes survive to move out over the water at night, creating spectacular cloud-to-cloud lightning shows for hours after sunset. Due to its large size Lake Okeechobee may also contribute to this activity by creating its own lake breeze which collides with the east and west coast sea breezes.

In Cuba similar sea breeze collisions with the northern and southern coasts sometimes lead to storms.

==== Sea breezes in Southeast Australia ====
In the southeast Australian states of New South Wales and Victoria, an intense sea breeze called the &quot;southerly buster&quot; causes an abrupt, squally southerly wind change, with gusts in excess of , in coastal cities such as Sydney in New South Wales south to Mallacoota, Victoria and Melbourne, as it approaches from the southeast, mainly on a hot day, bringing in cool, usually severe weather and a dramatic temperature drop, thus ultimately replacing and relieving the prior hot conditions. Marking the boundary between hot and cool air masses, the southerly buster is sometimes represented by a roll-up cloud perpendicular to the coast. 

The southerly buster is caused by the interaction of a shallow cold front with the blocking mountain range (Great Dividing Range) that aligns the coast, as the cool air becomes trapped against the ranges. The mountains create a channelling effect as the southerly gale winds move across the New South Wales coast, and frictional contrasts over the mainland and the ocean that disconnect the flow. Temperature changes can be dramatic, with falls of often occurring in a few minutes.

=== Land breeze ===
Land breeze, which consists of cool air coming from the land, pushes the warmer air upwards over the sea. If there is sufficient moisture and instability available, the land breeze can cause showers, or even thunderstorms, over the water. Overnight thunderstorm development offshore due to the land breeze can be a good predictor for the activity on land the following day, as long as there are no expected changes to the weather pattern over the following 12–24 hours. This is mainly because the strength of the land breeze is weaker than the sea breeze. The land breeze will die once the land warms up again the next morning.

== Utilisation ==
Wind farms are often situated near a coast to take advantage of the normal daily fluctuations of wind speed resulting from sea or land breezes. While many onshore wind farms and offshore wind farms do not rely on these winds, a nearshore wind farm is a type of offshore wind farm located on shallow coastal waters to take advantage of both sea and land breezes. For practical reasons, other offshore wind farms are situated further out to sea and rely on prevailing winds rather than sea breezes.

<doc id="450751" wikidata="Q967276" url="?curid=450751" title="New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission">
<text>The New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission (LPC) is the New York City agency charged with administering the city&#x27;s Landmarks Preservation Law. The LPC is responsible for protecting New York City&#x27;s architecturally, historically, and culturally significant buildings and sites by granting them landmark or historic district status, and regulating them after designation. It is the largest municipal preservation agency in the nation. , the LPC has designated more than 37,800 landmark properties in all five boroughs. Most of these are concentrated in historic districts, although there are over a thousand individual landmarks, as well as numerous interior and scenic landmarks.

Mayor Robert F. Wagner Jr. first organized a preservation committee in 1961, and the following year, created the LPC. The LPC&#x27;s power was greatly strengthened after the Landmarks Law was passed in April 1965, one and a half years after the destruction of Pennsylvania Station. The LPC has been involved in several prominent preservation decisions, including that of Grand Central Terminal. By 1990, the LPC was cited by David Dinkins as having preserved New York City&#x27;s municipal identity and enhanced the market perception of a number of neighborhoods.

The LPC is governed by eleven commissioners. The Landmarks Preservation Law stipulates that a building must be at least thirty years old before the LPC can declare it a landmark.

==Role==

The goal of New York City&#x27;s landmarks law is to preserve the aesthetically and historically important buildings, structures, and objects that make up the New York City vista. The Landmarks Preservation Commission is responsible for deciding which properties should be subject to landmark status and enacting regulations to protect the aesthetic and historic nature of these properties. The LPC preserves not only architecturally significant buildings, but the overall historical sense of place of neighborhoods that are designated as historic districts. The LPC is responsible for overseeing a range of designated landmarks in all five boroughs ranging from the Fonthill Castle in the North Bronx, built in 1852 for the actor Edwin Forrest, to the 1670s Conference House in Staten Island, where Benjamin Franklin and John Adams attended a conference aimed at ending the Revolutionary War.

The LPC helps preserve the city&#x27;s landmark properties by regulating changes to their significant features. The role of the LPC has evolved over time, especially with the changing real estate market in New York City.

Potential landmarks are first nominated to the LPC from citizens, property owners, city government staff, or commissioners or other staff of the LPC. Subsequently, the LPC conducts a survey of properties, visiting sites to determine which structures or properties should be researched further. The selected properties will then be discussed at public hearings where support or opposition to a proposed landmark designation are recorded. According to the Landmarks Preservation Law, a building must be at least thirty years old before the LPC can declare it a landmark. Approval of a landmark designation requires six commissioners to vote in favor. Approved designations are then sent to the New York City Council, which receives reports from other city agencies including the New York City Planning Commission, and decides whether to confirm, modify, or veto the designation. Before 1990, the New York City Board of Estimate held veto power, rather than the City Council. After the City Council&#x27;s final approval, a landmark designation may be overturned if an appeal is filed within 90 days.

The New York Landmarks Preservation Foundation is a not-for-profit organization, established in 1980 to support the Commission. They sponsor plaques, historic district signs, and street signs.

==Staff and departments==
===Commissioners===
The Landmarks Preservation Commission consists of 11 commissioners, who are unpaid and serve three-year terms on a part-time basis. By law, the commissioners must include a minimum of six professionals: three architects, a historian, a city planner or landscape architect, and a realtor. In addition, the commissioners must include at least one resident from each of New York City&#x27;s five boroughs (who may also be a professional). All of the commissioners are unpaid, except for the chairman. The commission also employs a full-time, paid workforce of 80, composed of administrators, legal advisors, architects, historians, restoration experts, and researchers. Students sponsored by the federal government, as well as volunteers, also assist the commission. 

===Departments===
The full-time staff, students, and volunteers are divided into six departments. The research department performs research of structures and sites that have been deemed potential landmarks. The preservation department reviews and approves permit applications to structures and sites that have been deemed landmarks. The enforcement department reviews reports of alleged violations of the Landmarks Law, which includes alterations to a landmark. In 2016, the preservation commission consolidated its archaeological collection of artifacts and launched a reconstructed archaeology department, known as the &quot;NYC Archaeological Repository: The Nan A. Rothschild Research Center.&quot; Archaeologists work for the center reviewing the impact of proposed subsurface projects, as well as overseeing any archaeological discoveries. The environmental review department uses data from the research and archaeology departments to collect reports for governmental agencies that require environmental review for their projects. Finally, the Historic Preservation Grant Program distributes grants to owners of landmark properties designated by the LPC or on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP).

==Types==
, there are more than 37,900 landmark properties in New York City, most of which are located in 150 historic districts in all five boroughs. The total number of protected sites includes 1,460 individual landmarks, 121 interior landmarks, and 12 scenic landmarks. Some of these are also National Historic Landmark (NHL) sites, and many are on the NRHP. , the vast majority of interior landmarks are also exterior landmarks or are part of a historic district.
* Individual landmark: The exteriors of objects or structures; the interior is not included unless designated separately. Individual landmarks must be at least 30 years old and contain &quot;a special character or special historical or aesthetic interest or value as part of the development, heritage, or cultural characteristics of the City, state, or nation&quot;.
* Interior landmark: The interiors of structures, which fit the individual landmark criteria and are &quot;customarily open or accessible to the public&quot;. 
* Scenic landmark: Sites owned by the city, which fit the individual landmark criteria and are &quot;parks or other landscape features&quot;.
* Historic districts: Regions with buildings that fit the individual landmark criteria and contain &quot;architectural and historical significance&quot;. Landmark districts must also be geographically cohesive with a &quot;coherent streetscape&quot; and a &quot;sense of place&quot;.

==History==

===Context===

The preservation movement in New York City dates to at least 1831, when the &quot;New York Evening Post&quot; expressed its opposition to the demolition of a 17th-century house on Pearl Street in Lower Manhattan. Before the LPC&#x27;s creation, buildings and structures were preserved mainly through advocacy, either from individuals or from groups. Numerous residences were saved this way, including the Andrew Carnegie Mansion, Percy R. Pyne House, and Oliver D. Filley House, all of which ultimately became individual landmarks after the LPC&#x27;s formation. Other structures such as the Van Cortlandt House, Morris–Jumel Mansion, Edgar Allan Poe Cottage, and Dyckman House were preserved as historic house museums during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Advocates also led efforts to preserve cultural sites such as Carnegie Hall, which in the late 1950s was slated for replacement with an office tower. However, early preservation movements often focused on preserving Colonial-style houses, while paying relatively little attention to other architectural styles or building types.

There was generally little support for the preservation movement until World War II. Structures such as the City Hall Post Office and Courthouse, Madison Square Presbyterian Church (1906), and Madison Square Garden (1890) were demolished if they had fallen out of architectural favor. Others, such as St. John&#x27;s Chapel, were destroyed in spite of support for preservation. By the 1950s, there was growing support for preservation of architecturally significant structures. For example, a 1954 study found approximately two hundred structures that could potentially be preserved. At the same time, older structures, especially those constructed before World War I, were being perceived as an impediment to development. The demolition of Pennsylvania Station between 1963 and 1966, in spite of widespread outcry, is cited as a catalyst for the architectural preservation movement in the United States, particularly in New York City.

===Creation===
The Mayor&#x27;s Committee for the Preservation of Structures of Historic and Esthetic Importance was formed in mid-1961 by mayor Robert F. Wagner Jr. This committee had dissolved by early 1962. Wagner formed the Landmarks Preservation Commission on April 21, 1962, with twelve unsalaried members. Soon afterward, the LPC began designating buildings as landmarks. That July, Wagner issued an executive order that compelled municipal agencies to notify the LPC of any &quot;proposed public improvements&quot;.

The early version of the LPC initially held little power over enforcement, and failed to avert Pennsylvania Station&#x27;s demolition. As a result, in April 1964, LPC member Geoffrey Platt drafted a New York City Landmarks Law. Outcry over the proposed destruction of the Brokaw Mansion on Manhattan&#x27;s Upper East Side, identified by the LPC as a possible landmark, inspired Wagner to send the legislation to the New York City Council in mid-1964. The law, introduced in the City Council that October, would significantly increase the LPC&#x27;s powers. The City Council cited concerns that &quot;the City has been and is undergoing the loss and destruction of its architectural heritage at an alarming rate, especially so in the last 8-10 years&quot;. Several changes to the Landmarks Law were made by the City Council committee that was reviewing the legislation; for example, the committee removed a clause mandating a protective zone around proposed landmarks. The bill passed the City Council on April 7, 1965, and was signed into law by Wagner on April 20.
The first eleven commissioners to take office under the Landmarks Law were sworn in during June 1965. Platt was the first chairman, serving until 1968. The LPC&#x27;s first public hearing occurred in September 1965, and the first twenty landmarks were designated the next month. The Wyckoff House in Brooklyn was the first landmark numerically, and was designated simultaneously with structures such as the Astor Library, the Brooklyn Navy Yard&#x27;s Commandant&#x27;s House, the Bowling Green U.S. Custom House, and six buildings at Sailors&#x27; Snug Harbor. The first landmark district, the Brooklyn Heights Historic District, was designated in November 1965. Within its first year, the LPC designated 37 landmarks in addition to the Brooklyn Heights Historic District. The LPC&#x27;s earliest landmarks were mainly selected based on their architecture, and were largely either government buildings, institutions, or structures whose preservation was unlikely to be controversial. As a result, several prominent buildings were destroyed in the first several years of the LPC&#x27;s existence, such as the Singer Building and the New York Tribune Building. Other structures, such as the Villard Houses and Squadron A Armory, were saved only partially.

===Changes===
The LPC was headquartered in the Mutual Reserve Building from 1967 to 1980, and in the Old New York Evening Post Building from 1980 to 1987. The original legislation enabled the LPC to designate landmarks for eighteen months after the law became effective, followed by alternating cycles of three-year hiatuses and six-month &quot;designating periods&quot;. In 1973, mayor John Lindsay signed legislation that allowed the LPC to consider landmarks on a rolling basis. The bill also introduced new scenic and interior landmark designations. The first scenic landmark was Central Park in April 1974, while the first interior landmark was part of the neighboring New York Public Library Main Branch in November 1974.

In its first twenty-five years, the LPC designated 856 individual landmarks, 79 interior landmarks, and 9 scenic landmarks, while declaring 52 neighborhoods with more than 15,000 buildings as historic districts. In 1989, when the LPC and its process was under review following a panel created by mayor Edward Koch in 1985, a decision was made to change the process by which buildings are declared to be landmarks due to some perceived issues with the manner by which the LPC operates as well as the realization that the destruction feared when the LPC was formed was no longer imminent. By 1990, the LPC was cited by David Dinkins as having preserved New York City&#x27;s municipal identity and enhanced the market perception of a number of neighborhoods. This success is believed to be due, in part, to the general acceptance of the LPC by the city&#x27;s developers. By 2016, the LPC had designated 1,355 individual landmarks, 117 interior landmarks, 138 historic districts, and 10 scenic landmarks.

===Prominent landmarking decisions===

One of the most prominent decisions in which the LPC was involved was the preservation of the Grand Central Terminal with the assistance of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis. In 1978, the United States Supreme Court upheld the law in &quot;Penn Central Transportation Co., et al. v. New York City, et al.&quot;, stopping the Penn Central Railroad from altering the structure and placing a large office tower above it. This success is often cited as significant due to the LPC&#x27;s origins following the destruction of Pennsylvania Station, referred to by some as architectural vandalism.

In 1989, the LPC designated the Ladies&#x27; Mile Historic District. The next year marked the first time in the LPC&#x27;s history that a proposed landmark, the Guggenheim Museum (one of the youngest declared landmarks), received a unanimous vote by the LPC members. The vast majority of the LPC&#x27;s actions are not unanimously supported by the LPC members or the community; a number of cases including St. Bartholomew&#x27;s Episcopal Church, Bryant Park, and Broadway theatres have been challenged. One of the most controversial properties was 2 Columbus Circle, which remained at the center of a discussion over its future for a number of years.

Cultural landmarks, such as Greenwich Village&#x27;s Stonewall Inn, are recognized as well not for their architecture, but rather for their location in a designated historic district. In 2015, Stonewall became the first official New York City landmark to be designated specifically based on its LGBT cultural significance.

In a heatedly discussed decision on August 3, 2010, the LPC unanimously declined to grant landmark status to a building on Park Place in Manhattan, and thus did not block the construction of Cordoba House.

====Theater District landmarks====

A major dispute arose over the preservation of theaters in the Theater District during the 1980s. The LPC considered protecting close to 50 legitimate theaters as individual city landmarks in 1982, following the destruction of the Helen Hayes and Morosco theaters. An advisory panel under mayor Koch voted to allow the LPC consider theaters not only on their historical significance but also on their architectural merits. In response to objections from some of the major theatrical operators, several dozen scenic and lighting designers offered to work on the LPC for creating guidelines for potential landmarks. Theaters were landmarked in alphabetical order; the first theaters to be designated under the 1982 plan were the Neil Simon, Ambassador, and Virginia (now August Wilson) in August 1985. The landmark plan was then deferred temporarily until some landmark guidelines were enacted; the guidelines, implemented in December 1985, allowed operators to modify theaters for productions without having to consult the LPC.

Landmark designations of theaters increased significantly in 1987, starting with the Palace in mid-1987. Ultimately, 28 additional theaters were designated as landmarks, of which 27 were Broadway theaters. The New York City Board of Estimate ratified these designations in March 1988. Of these, both the interior and exterior of 19 theaters were protected, while only the interiors of seven theaters (including the Lyceum, whose exterior was already protected) and the exteriors of two theaters were approved. Several theater owners argued that the landmark designations impacted them negatively, despite Koch&#x27;s outreach to theater owners. The Shubert Organization, the Nederlander Organization, and Jujamcyn Theaters collectively sued the LPC in June 1988 to overturn the landmark designations of 22 theaters on the merit that the designations severely limited the extent to which the theaters could be modified. The New York Supreme Court upheld the LPC&#x27;s designations of these theaters the next year. The three theatrical operators challenged the ruling with the U.S. Supreme Court, which refused to hear the lawsuit in 1992, thus upholding the designations.

====South Street Seaport and &quot;New Market Building&quot;====
An LPC-designated historic district for the South Street Seaport has been active since 1977 and was extended on July 11, 1989. After the Fulton Fish Market relocated to the Bronx in 2005, community members, with leadership from organizer Robert Lavalva, developed the &quot;New Amsterdam Market&quot;, a regular gathering with vendors selling regional and &quot;sustainable&quot; foodstuffs outside the old Fish Market buildings. The group&#x27;s chartered organization planned eventually to attempt to reconstitute the &quot;New Market Building&quot;, a 1939 structure with an Art Deco façade and that was owned by the city, into a permanent food market. However, a real estate company, the Howard Hughes Corporation, possessed a lease for large parts of the Seaport area and desired to redevelop it, generating fears among locals that the New Market Building would be altered or destroyed. The corporation has offered to provide a more modest food market (at ) into their development plans, but market organizers have not been satisfied as they believe this proposal is not guaranteed or large enough, and would still not ensure the protection of the historic building.

A group of community activists formed the &quot;Save Our Seaport Coalition&quot; to advocate that the New Market Building be incorporated into the historic district set by the Landmarks Preservation Commission, in addition to calling for the protection of public space in the neighborhood and for support for the seaport&#x27;s museum. This group included the Historic Districts Council, the &quot;Save Our Seaport&quot; community group, the New Amsterdam Market, and the Metropolitan Waterfront Alliance. The &quot;Save Our Seaport&quot; group specifically argued that New Market Building was culturally important for its maintenance of the historic fish market for 66 years, and that it offers a &quot;fine example of WPA Moderne municipal architecture (an increasingly rare form throughout the nation).&quot; They had encouraged others to write letters to the LPC to support formal designation or district protection. However, in 2013, the LPC declined to hold a hearing to consider this landmark designation or to expand the district. Community Board 1 supports protecting and repurposing the New Market Building, and the Municipal Art Society argued in a report that &quot;[it] has both architectural and cultural significance as the last functioning site of the important commercial and shipping hub at South Street Seaport.&quot;

====Little Syria and Washington Street====
After the September 11 attacks in 2001, New York City tour guide Joseph Svehlak and other local historians became concerned that government-encouraged development in Downtown Manhattan would lead to the disappearance of the last physical heritage of the once &quot;low-rise&quot; Lower West Side of Manhattan. Also known as &quot;Little Syria&quot; in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the area between Battery Park and the World Trade Center site, east of West Street and west of Broadway, had been a residential area for the shipping elite of New York in the early 19th century, and turned into a substantial neighborhood of ethnic immigration in the mid-19th century. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, centered on Washington Street, the area became well known as Little Syria, hosting immigrants from today&#x27;s Lebanon, Syria, and Palestine, as well those of many other ethnic groups including Greeks, Armenians, Irish, Slovaks, and Czechs. Due to eminent domain actions associated with the construction of the Brooklyn–Battery Tunnel and the World Trade Center, in addition to significant highrise construction in the 1920s and 30s, only a small number of low-rise historic buildings from the earlier eras remain.

In 2003, Svehlak wrote a manifesto arguing for the landmark designation of &quot;a trilogy&quot; of three contiguous buildings on Washington Street, the thoroughfare that was most closely associated with &quot;Little Syria&quot;. These consisted of the Downtown Community House – which hosted the Bowling Green Association to serve the neighborhood&#x27;s immigrants – 109 Washington Street (an 1885 tenement), and the terra-cotta St. George&#x27;s Syrian Catholic Church. After years of advocacy, in January 2009, the LPC held a hearing about the landmark designation of the Melkite church, which did succeed. However, under Chairman Robert Tierney, the LPC had declined to hold hearings on the Downtown Community House or 109 Washington Street.

Community and preservation groups — including the &quot;Friends of the Lower West Side&quot; and the &quot;Save Washington Street&quot; group led by St. Francis College student Carl &quot;Antoun&quot; Houck — have continued, especially, to advocate for a hearing on the Downtown Community House, arguing that its history demonstrates the multi-ethnic heritage of the neighborhood, and that its Colonial Revival architecture intentionally links the immigrants to the foundations of the country, and that preserving the three buildings together would tell a coherent story of an overlooked, but important ethnic neighborhood. In addition to national Arab-American organizations, Manhattan Community Board 1 and City Councilperson Margaret Chin have also advocated for the LPC to hold a hearing on the Downtown Community House. According to &quot;the Wall Street Journal&quot;, however, the LPC argues that &quot;the buildings lack the necessary architectural and historical significance and that better examples of the settlement house movement and tenements exist in other parts of the city.&quot; The activists have said they hope that the LPC under the new mayor will be more receptive to preservation in the neighborhood.

==Former landmarks==
Very rarely, a landmark status granted by the LPC has been revoked. Some have been revoked by vote of the New York City Council or before 1990, the New York City Board of Estimate. Others have been demolished, either through neglect or for development, and revoked by the LPC.

<text>The Farmers Insurance Open is an annual professional golf tournament on the PGA Tour, held in San Diego, California. Founded in 1952, the tournament has been held at Torrey Pines Golf Course, a 36-hole municipal facility in La Jolla, since 1968. The tournament is held in the early part of the season known as the &quot;West Coast Swing&quot;.

The tournament is organized by the Century Club of San Diego. In the current format, players split the first 36 holes between the North and South Course, then play the final 36 holes on the South Course. The South Course has hosted the U.S. Open twice: Tiger Woods won in a playoff in 2008, and Jon Rahm won in 2021.

==History==
Founded in 1952 as the San Diego Open, the first two editions were played at San Diego Country Club in Chula Vista. In 1954, the tournament was played at Rancho Santa Fe Golf Club, which had hosted the Crosby Pro-Am prior to World War II.

Although the San Diego Open began in 1952, the PGA Tour recognizes two earlier events of the same name: Leo Diegel won both events, in December 1927 and January 1929. An autumn event in 1956 and 1957, it was not held in 1958, then returned as a winter event in early 1959.

The event was played at Mission Valley Country Club in 1955, then went to Singing Hills Country Club in El Cajon in October 1956. The tournament returned to Mission Valley C.C. in 1957, where it stayed through 1963. Mission Valley changed its name to Stardust Country Club in 1962 (now Riverwalk Golf Club). After one edition in 1964 at Rancho Bernardo Country Club (now Rancho Bernardo Inn) in San Diego, it returned to Stardust for three years, through 1967.

In 1968, the event began its present relationship with Torrey Pines Golf Course in La Jolla, a 36-hole public facility owned by the City of San Diego. During those early editions at Torrey Pines, the course length was under . Singer-actor Andy Williams was the celebrity host for the first 21 editions at Torrey Pines, through 1988.

Title sponsors were first added in 1955, with Convair added to the name for two years. In 1981, Wickes was the title sponsor for two years, followed by three with Isuzu. Shearson Lehman Brothers became the title sponsors in 1986, replaced by Buick in 1992 and Farmers Insurance in 2010.

Since 2022, it has started on Wednesday and concluded on Saturday, a day prior to the conference championships of the NFL playoffs; the event traditionally marks the beginning of CBS&#x27;s PGA Tour season.

The South Course has hosted the U.S. Open twice: Tiger Woods won in a playoff in 2008, and Jon Rahm birdied the final two holes to win by a stroke in 2021.

<doc id="450779" wikidata="Q822286" url="?curid=450779" title="Bernard Bailyn">
<text>Bernard Bailyn (September 10, 1922 – August 7, 2020) was an American historian, author, and academic specializing in U.S. Colonial and Revolutionary-era History. He was a professor at Harvard University from 1953. Bailyn won the Pulitzer Prize for History twice (in 1968 and 1987). In 1998 the National Endowment for the Humanities selected him for the Jefferson Lecture. He was a recipient of the 2010 National Humanities Medal.

He specialized in American colonial and revolutionary-era history, looking at merchants, demographic trends, Loyalists, international links across the Atlantic, and especially the political ideas that motivated the Patriots. He was best known for studies of republicanism and Atlantic history that transformed the scholarship in those fields. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1963 and a member of the American Philosophical Society in 1971.

==Early life and education==
Bailyn was born in Hartford, Connecticut, in 1922, the son of Esther (Schloss) and Charles Manuel Bailyn. His family was Jewish. Bailyn earned his bachelor&#x27;s degree from Williams College in 1945 and in 1953 earned his Ph.D from Harvard University. He was associated with Harvard for the rest of his life. As a graduate student at Harvard, he studied under Perry Miller, Samuel Eliot Morison, and Oscar Handlin. He was made a full professor in 1961, and professor emeritus in 1993. 

==History books==
Bernard Bailyn was the author of &quot;The Ideological Origins of the American Revolution&quot; (1967), which was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for History in 1968. He was the editor of &quot;The Apologia of Robert Keayne&quot; (1965) and of the two-volume &quot;Debate on the Constitution&quot; (1993).

He co-authored &quot;The Great Republic&quot; (1977), an American history textbook, and was co-editor of &quot;The Intellectual Migration, Europe and America, 1930–1960&quot; (1969), &quot;Law in American History&quot; (1972), &quot;The Press and the American Revolution&quot; (1980), and &quot;Strangers Within the Realm: Cultural Margins of the First British Empire&quot; (1991).

==Major themes and ideas==
Bailyn&#x27;s dissertation and first publications dealt with New England merchants. He argued that international commerce was an uncertain business, given the high risk of losses at sea in the very long turnaround times, which meant that information was often too old to be useful. Merchants reduced the uncertainty by pooling their resources, especially with marriages to other merchant families, and placing their kinfolk as trusted agents in London and other foreign ports.

International commerce became a chief means of growing rich in colonial Massachusetts. However, there was an ongoing tension between the entrepreneurial spirit on the one hand and traditional Puritan culture on the other. The world of merchants became an engine of social change, undermining the isolationism, scholasticism, and religious zeal of the Puritan leadership. Bailyn pointed the younger generation of historians away from Puritan theology and toward broader social and economic forces. Bailyn expanded his research to the social structure of Virginia, showing how its leadership class was transformed in the 1660s. Like Edmund Morgan at Brown University and Yale, Bailyn emphasized the multiple roles of the family in the colonial social system.

Bailyn is known for meticulous research and for interpretations that sometimes challenge the conventional wisdom, especially those dealing with the causes and effects of the American Revolution. In his most influential work, &quot;The Ideological Origins of the American Revolution&quot;, Bailyn analyzed pre-Revolutionary political pamphlets to show that colonists believed the British intended to establish a tyrannical state that would abridge the historical British rights. He thus argued that the Revolutionary rhetoric of liberty and freedom was not simply propagandistic but rather central to their understanding of the situation. This evidence was used to displace Charles A. Beard&#x27;s theory, then the dominant understanding of the American Revolution, that the American Revolution was primarily a matter of class warfare and that the rhetoric of liberty was meaningless. Bailyn maintained that ideology was ingrained in the revolutionaries, an attitude he said exemplified the &quot;transforming radicalism of the American Revolution.&quot;

Bailyn argued that republicanism was at the core of the values French radical thinkers had striven to affirm. He located the intellectual sources of the American Revolution within a broader British political framework, explaining how English country Whig ideas about civic virtue, corruption, ancient rights, and fear of autocracy were, in the colonies, transformed into the ideology of republicanism.

According to Bailyn,
In Bailyn&#x27;s assessment, contested libertarian meanings change through time as &quot;the colonists&quot; struggled to define, and to pursue, the property of independence. Recent historians hold that more than any other &quot;colonist,&quot; Boston waterfront rebels channeled their &quot;cosmopolitanism into a belief that &#x27;the cause of America&#x27; was a libertarian &#x27;cause for all mankind.&quot;

===Two Concepts of Liberty===
In her memorial tribute, Harvard historian Joyce Chaplin noted Bernard Bailyn&#x27;s resistance to &quot;dichotomies&quot; and his attention to &quot;granular&quot; records and culture. In that context, Bailyn did not publish on political philosopher Isaiah Berlin until a 2006 assessment of &quot;perfectionist ideas&quot; found in &quot;Two Concepts of Liberty.&quot; He contended that Berlin&#x27;s framework for &quot;liberty&quot; was &quot;formally cast as a discourse on the permissible limits of coercion; &#x27;force&#x27; and &#x27;constraint&quot; are repeatedly referred to, and Berlin denied that all historical conflicts are reducible to conflicts of ideas.&quot; Berlin&#x27;s &quot;comments on the dangers of perfectionism had begun with his discussion of positive liberty...While at times, he then wrote, it might be justifiable &#x27;to coerce men in the name of some goal (let us say, justice or public health), which they would, if they were more enlightened, themselves pursue,&#x27; once one claims that one knows what others need better than they know it themselves, one is &#x27;in a position to ignore the actual wishes of men or societies.&#x27; &quot; Bailyn triangulated his own approach with Berlin&#x27;s &quot;embattled position in defense of a liberal alternative&quot; and &quot;perfectionist ideas.&quot; For the latter, Bailyn distinguished his approach to &quot;liberty&quot; from the &quot;unity&quot; precepts of Actual idealism in Totalitarianism. Thus he decried &quot;the repressive power of the Soviet state, the annihilatory power of the Nazi regime, the mind-blinding power of Maoist gangs, [and] the suffocating power of Islamic fundamentalism.&quot; He declared that &quot;no one knew better than Berlin or expressed more brilliantly the genealogy and structure of perfectionist ideas. But their threat to civilisation, in the most general terms, lay not in their intrinsic malevolence but in the brutality of those who implacably imposed them: the populist thugs, the fanatical monopolists of power.&quot;

==Social history==
In the 1980s, Bailyn turned from political and intellectual history to social and demographic history. His histories of the peopling of colonial North America explored questions of immigration, cultural contact, and settlement that his mentor Handlin had pioneered decades earlier.

Bailyn was a major innovator in new research techniques, such as quantification, collective biography, and kinship analysis.

Bailyn is representative of those scholars who believe in the concept of American exceptionalism but avoid the terminology and thereby avoid getting entangled in rhetorical debates. According to Michael Kammen and Stanley N. Katz:

==Atlantic history==
As a leading advocate of Atlantic history, Bailyn organized an annual international seminar on the &quot;History of the Atlantic World&quot; from the mid-1980s onward. Through the seminar, he promoted social and demographic studies, especially regarding flows of population into colonial America. Bailyn&#x27;s &quot;Atlantic History: Concepts and Contours&quot; (2005) explores the borders and contents of the emerging field, which emphasizes cosmopolitan and multicultural elements that have tended to be neglected or considered in isolation by traditional historiography dealing with the Americas.

==Personal life==
Bailyn was married to MIT Professor of Management Lotte Bailyn (née Lazarsfeld). His two sons are Charles Bailyn, who is an astrophysicist at Yale University, and John Bailyn, a linguist at Stony Brook University.

Bailyn died on August 7, 2020, at his home in Belmont, Massachusetts, after suffering from heart failure. He was 97.

<text>The Territory of Idaho was an organized incorporated territory of the United States that existed from March 3, 1863, until July 3, 1890, when the final extent of the territory was admitted to the Union as Idaho.

==History==
===1860s===
The territory was officially organized on March 3, 1863, by Act of Congress, and signed into law by President Abraham Lincoln. It is a successor region that was created by areas from existing territories undergoing parallel political transitions beginning with disputes over which country owned the region (See Oregon Country). By 1863, the area west of the Continental Divide that was formerly part of the huge Oregon Territory had been sundered from the coastal Washington Territory north of the young State of Oregon to the far west and the remnant of the Oregon Territory was officially &quot;unorganized&quot;. Most of the area east of the Continental Divide had been part of the loosely defined Dakota Territory ending along the 49th parallel—now the border with Canada, then a colonial possession of Great Britain.

The original newly organized territory covered all of the present-day states of Idaho and Montana, and almost all of the present-day state of Wyoming, omitting only a corner in the state&#x27;s extreme southwest portion. It was wholly spanned east-to-west by the bustling Oregon Trail and partly by the other emigrant trails, the California Trail and Mormon Trail which since hitting stride in 1847, had been conveying settler wagon trains to the west, and incidentally, across the continental divide into the Snake River Basin, a key gateway into the Idaho and Oregon Country interiors.

The first territorial capital was at Lewiston from the inception in 1863 to 1866. Boise was made the territorial capital from 1866 by a one-vote margin of the Territorial Supreme Court. Congress failed to provide official criminal or civic codes for the Idaho territory upon its inception. It was not until January 4th, 1864 that the territory&#x27;s original laws were adopted.

The upheaval caused by the Civil War and Reconstruction was a distant concern to those in the comparatively stable Idaho Territory, a situation which in turn encouraged settlement.

In 1864, the Montana Territory was organized from the northeastern section of the territory east of the Bitterroot Range. Most of the southeastern area of the territory was made part of the Dakota Territory.

In the late 1860s, Idaho Territory became a destination for displaced Southern Democrats who fought for the Confederate States of America during the Civil War. These people were well represented in the early territorial legislatures, which often clashed with the appointed Republican territorial governors. The political infighting became particularly vicious in 1867 when Governor David W. Ballard asked for protection from federal troops stationed at Fort Boise against the territorial legislature. By 1870, however, the political infighting had decreased considerably.

In 1868, the areas east of the 111th meridian west were made part of the newly created Wyoming Territory. Idaho Territory assumed the boundaries of the modern state at that time.
The discovery of gold, silver and other valuable natural resources throughout Idaho beginning in the 1860s, as well as the completion of the Transcontinental Railroad in 1869, brought many new people to the territory, including Chinese laborers who came to work the mines. As Idaho approached statehood, mining and other extractive industries became increasingly important to its economy. By the 1890s, for example, Idaho exported more lead than any other state.

===1870s===
Construction began on the Idaho Territorial Prison in 1870 and was completed by 1872. The prison was in use by the territory, then the state until 1973. The Old Idaho State Penitentiary was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974 for its significance as a Territorial Prison. The site currently contains museums and an arboretum.

Almost immediately after Idaho Territory was created, a public school system was created and stage coach lines were established. Regular newspapers were active in Lewiston, Boise and Silver City by 1865. The first telegraph line reached Franklin in 1866, with Lewiston being the first town linked in northern Idaho in 1874. The first telephone call in the Pacific Northwest was made on May 10, 1878, in Lewiston.

Although forming a sizable minority, members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Idaho were held in suspicion by others in Idaho. By 1882, notable and powerful Idahoans successfully disenfranchised members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints voters in Idaho Territory, citing their illegal practice of polygamy. Idaho was able to achieve statehood some six years before Utah, a territory which had a larger population and had been settled longer, but was majority members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints with voting polygamists.

There were four thousand Chinese living in the Idaho Territory from 1869 to 1875. Like many Chinese immigrants, they came to &quot;Gold Mountain&quot; to work as miners, or found work as laundrymen and cooks. The 1870 census reported there were 1,751 Chinese in Idaho City who were nearly half of city residents.

The Nez Perce War began in the north-central portion of the territory at White Bird Canyon in June 1877, and concluded four months later in eastern Montana Territory at Bear Paw.

===1880s===
After the capital relocation controversy, proposals to split the two regions became widespread. For the rest of the decade, Idaho Territory was nearly legislated out of existence. In 1885, the Idaho legislature published a bipartisan memorial to Congress asking for northern Idaho to be returned to Washington Territory. There were two attempts during the 49th Congress to accomplish this. On March 1, 1887 Congress sent a bill to President Grover Cleveland which would have returned northern Idaho to Washington Territory. Cleveland, likely as a favor to Governor Edward A. Stevenson, refused to sign the bill and it was pocket vetoed when the session of Congress ended two days later. Nevada and Utah showed interest in acquiring the remainders of southern Idaho.

In 1889, the University of Idaho was awarded to the northern town of Moscow instead of its original planned location at Eagle Rock (now Idaho Falls) in the south. This served to alleviate some of the hard feelings felt by North Idaho residents over losing the capital.

In a bid for statehood, Governor Stevenson called for a constitutional convention in 1889. The convention approved a constitution on August 6, 1889, and voters approved the constitution on November 5, 1889. President Benjamin Harrison signed the law admitting Idaho as a U.S. state on July 3, 1890.

<doc id="450789" wikidata="Q1026699" url="?curid=450789" title="Devizes">
<text>Devizes () is a market town and civil parish in Wiltshire, England. It developed around Devizes Castle, an 11th-century Norman castle, and received a charter in 1141. The castle was besieged during the Anarchy, a 12th-century civil war between Stephen of England and Empress Matilda, and again during the English Civil War when the Cavaliers lifted the siege at the Battle of Roundway Down and the Parliamentarian Army of the West under Sir William Waller was routed. Devizes remained under Royalist control until 1645, when Oliver Cromwell attacked and forced the Royalists to surrender. The castle was destroyed in 1648 on the orders of Parliament, and today little remains of it.

From the 16th century Devizes became known for its textiles, and by the early 18th century it held the largest corn market in the West Country, constructing the Corn Exchange in 1857. In the 18th century, brewing, curing of tobacco, and snuff-making were established. The Wadworth Brewery was founded in the town in 1875.

Standing at the west edge of the Vale of Pewsey, Devizes is about southeast of Chippenham and north-east of the county town of Trowbridge. The town has nearly five hundred listed buildings, some notable churches, a town hall and a green in the centre.

==History==
Devizes Castle was built by Osmund, Bishop of Salisbury in 1080, but the town is not mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086. Because the castle was on the boundaries of the manors of Rowde, Bishops Cannings and Potterne it became known as the &quot;castrum ad divisas&quot; (&quot;the castle at the boundaries&quot;), hence the name &quot;Devizes&quot;. On John Speed&#x27;s map of Wiltshire (1611), the town&#x27;s name is recorded as &quot;The Devyses&quot;. The first castle on the site was of the motte and bailey form and was probably made of wood and earth, but this burnt down in 1113.

A new castle was built in stone by Roger of Salisbury, Osmund&#x27;s successor. Devizes received its first charter in 1141, permitting regular markets. The castle changed hands several times during the Anarchy, a civil war between Stephen of Blois and Matilda in the 12th century. The castle held important prisoners, including (from 1106) Robert Curthose, eldest son of William the Conqueror.

The town has had churches since the 12th century and today has four Church of England parish churches.

During the 12th and 13th centuries, the town of Devizes developed outside the castle with craftsmen and traders setting up businesses to serve the residents of the castle. The first known market in Devizes was in 1228. The original market was in the large space outside St Mary&#x27;s Church, rather than in the current Market Place, which at that time would have been within the castle&#x27;s outer bailey. The chief products in the 16th and early 17th centuries were wheat, wool and yarn, with cheese, bacon and butter increasing in importance later.
In 1643, during the English Civil War, Parliamentary forces under Sir William Waller besieged Royalist forces under Sir Ralph Hopton in Devizes. The siege was lifted by a relief force from Oxford under Henry Wilmot, 1st Earl of Rochester, and Waller&#x27;s forces were almost totally destroyed at the Battle of Roundway Down. Devizes remained under Royalist control until 1645, when Oliver Cromwell attacked and forced the Royalists to surrender. The castle was destroyed in 1648 on the orders of Parliament, a process known as slighting, and today little remains of it; almost all of the present structure is from the 19th century.

From the 16th century, Devizes became known for its textiles: initially white woollen broadcloth but later the manufacture of serge, drugget, felt, and cassimere or Zephyr cloth. In the mid 18th century, Devizes held the largest corn market in the West Country of England and also traded hops, cattle, horses and various types of cloth. Before the Corn Exchange was built in 1857, the trade in wheat and barley was conducted in the open, with sacks piled around the market cross. The cross erected in 1814 displays the tale of a woman, Ruth Pierce, who dropped dead suddenly after being discovered cheating.

Prosperous wool merchants built town houses in St. John&#x27;s and Long Street, and around the market place. From the end of the 18th century the manufacture of textiles declined, but other trades in the town included clock-making, a bell foundry, booksellers, milliners, grocers and silversmiths. In the 18th, century brewing, curing of tobacco and snuff-making were established in the town. Brewing survives in the Wadworth Brewery, but the tobacco and snuff trades have now died out.

The pond known as The Crammer, east of the town centre, is claimed to be site of the 18th-century Moonrakers story which led to a colloquial name for Wiltshire people.

In 1794, a meeting at the Bear Hotel decided to raise a body of ten independent troops of yeomanry in the county of Wiltshire. These would later be brought together to form the Royal Wiltshire Yeomanry, the senior yeomanry regiment. In 1810 the county militia, quartered at Devizes, mutinied and the Royal Wiltshire Yeomanry were called out to quell the disturbances. The mutiny came to a head when the two forces faced off against each other with loaded firearms in the Market Square, at which point the militia ringleaders surrendered. The Royal Wiltshire Yeomanry went on to serve at home and abroad, including in the Boer War, both World Wars, and live on as B (RWY) Squadron and Y (RWY) Squadron of the Royal Wessex Yeomanry, based in Old Sarum and Swindon respectively.

A new Devizes Prison, or County House of Corrections, was opened in 1817. This replaced the Bridewell that had been built in Bridewell Street in 1579. The new prison was built of brick and stone, and was designed by Richard Ingleman as a two-storey polygon surrounding a central governor&#x27;s house. It had an operational life of more than ninety years and was closed in 1922. It stood on the north side of the Castle&#x27;s Old Park, across the Kennet and Avon Canal by way of a bridge still called Prison Bridge. The House of Corrections was demolished by 1928.

Devizes has more than 500 listed buildings, a large number for a town of its size. The Trust for Devizes has a Town Trail map which provides a guide to many of them. 17 Market Place is a substantial Grade I listed house from the early 18th century. In the centre of the Market Place is the Market Cross, rebuilt in 1814 to designs of James Wyatt. Brownston House is another Grade I house, on New Park Street; it has been home to four MPs and two Army Generals from 1700, and housed a young ladies&#x27; boarding school from 1859 to 1901. It was conserved in 1976 by Wiltshire Council and is now a business head office. Heathcote House on the Green in Devizes is a Grade II* listed building; its history is associated with the church and education. No 8 Long Street was the house of the clothier Samuel Powell, as well as Admiral Joseph Tayler, one of the inspirations for C.S. Forester&#x27;s fictional hero Horatio Hornblower. Southbroom House, close to the Green, was built in 1501, then burnt down and was rebuilt by the Eyles family in 1772; it is now at the heart of Devizes School.

The town was a coaching stop for mail coaches and stagecoaches on the road from London to Bristol, as evidenced by the number of coaching inns in the town. The Kennet and Avon Canal, fully open by 1810, passes close to the centre of the town. The town gained a railway station in 1857 but the line was closed in 1966.
In 1853 the Wiltshire Archaeological and Natural History Society was founded in the town, and later opened a museum in Long Street. Now called the Wiltshire Museum, its collections are designated as being of national significance. The museum has extensive Bronze Age collections and includes finds from the Stonehenge and Avebury World Heritage Site, including West Kennet Long Barrow, Marden Henge and Bush Barrow. There are plans to move the museum into the Grade II* listed former Devizes Assize Court, northwest of the town centre, where facilities for community events will also be provided.

There was a military presence in the town at Le Marchant Barracks, from 1878 until the 1980s.

In 1999, a hill figure of a white horse was cut onto a hill close to Roundway Hill. Known as the Devizes White Horse, it replaced an earlier one which was cut in 1845.

In 2014, the town celebrated the 200th anniversary of the Market Cross, marked by Viscount Sidmouth and his cousin, High Sheriff of Wiltshire Peter Addington.

==Geography==

Devizes lies about west-southwest of Central London, almost 2° west of the Greenwich Meridian, with the two-degree line running through the western edge of the town, just a few hundred yards west of the castle. As this is the centre of the east–west extent of the Ordnance Survey mapping grid, True North and Grid north align exactly in Devizes.

Towns close to Devizes include Melksham, Pewsey, Calne and Westbury.

Suburbs of the town include Hartmoor, Jump Farm, Northgate, Nursteed, Roundway, Southbroom and Wick.

==Governance==

Devizes is a civil parish with an elected town council. , 11 councillors are Devizes Guardians, 7 Conservatives, 1 Labour and 2 Independent. The parish includes the small settlement of Dunkirk, on the northeastern slopes of the hill, which was transferred from Rowde parish in 1835. Much of the built-up area of the town, to the north, east, and south, is within the neighbouring civil parish of Roundway, while a smaller part is in Bishops Cannings parish, and each of those has its own parish council. In April 2017, Roundway and Devizes elected for the first time a joint parish council; at the same time, adjustments to the boundary with Bishops Canning were made.

The town is within the area of the Wiltshire Council unitary authority, on which the four elected members for Devizes are Conservatives. Most significant local government services are the responsibility of Wiltshire Council, while the town and parish councils have a more consultative role. Before the Local Government Act took effect in 1974, Devizes was a municipal borough with its headquarters at Devizes Town Hall. It then became the administrative centre for the much larger District of Kennet, until that was abolished as part of the 2009 structural changes.

The town has four electoral wards. The North and East wards follow the boundaries of the civil parish, while Devizes and Roundway South ward extends southward to include part of the original Roundway parish, the remainder of which makes up the fourth ward, Roundway. The total population of these wards at the 2011 census was 12,491 but in 2017 with the addition of Roundway as the fourth ward, the population grew to over 17,700.

Devizes is part of the Melksham and Devizes Westminster constituency, created following boundary changes and first contested at the 2024 general election, when it was won by Brian Mathew for the Liberal Democrats.

The council has twinning associations with Mayenne in France, Oamaru in New Zealand, Tornio in Finland, and Waiblingen in Germany.

==Economy==
Devizes has always been a market town and the market square is still used for that purpose every Thursday, and for farmers&#x27; markets on the first Saturday of each month. Indoor traders set up each day in the historic Shambles, off the market square.

There are over 70 independent retailers in the town centre, many around the Market Place, Little Brittox and Brittox (both pedestrianised), and in Sidmouth Street. At the town&#x27;s wharf on the canal, the Kennet and Avon Canal Trust has a small museum and cafe.

Construction of the new Devizes Health Centre, a 1,588sq m, two-storey building, began in 2021. This will replace the services at Devizes Community Hospital and provide a range of outpatient and GP services.

== Culture ==
There is a lively arts and culture community in the town, with the Arts Council funded Devizes International Street Festival attracting thousands to the town for two weeks leading up to August Bank Holiday each year, beginning with a long-standing &quot;confetti battle&quot; where, at a given signal – usually cannons firing confetti hundreds of metres into the air – the public are invited into the Market Place to throw as much confetti as possible at one another.

The annual Devizes Arts Festival has a broad spectrum of musical events, poets and authors, literary talks, comedians and other performers. Each autumn, the Devizes Food and Drink Festival includes opportunities to dine in unusual places.

There is an active thespian community that performs at the Wharf Theatre, a former warehouse alongside canal.

== Media ==
The local radio station is Fantasy Radio, a community radio station that broadcasts on 97 FM.

The &quot;Gazette and Herald&quot; is the town&#x27;s local weekly newspaper.

==Transport==

In 1857 the Great Western Railway built its Devizes branch line eastward to Devizes, from Holt Junction on its - line, to Devizes railway station just south of the market place. In 1862 GWR extended the Reading-Hungerford line westward to meet this line, providing a direct route between and the West Country through Devizes. Pans Lane Halt, southeast of the town in the suburb of Wick, opened in 1929. The building of a by-pass line through Westbury in 1900 diverted most traffic from the Devizes line and British Rail closed it in 1966; the station was demolished soon after. Today the nearest railway stations are at , Chippenham and , although there is a proposal to open a station on the Westbury line at Lydeway, southeast of the town.

Devizes has bus connections to surrounding towns including Swindon (via Avebury), Trowbridge, Salisbury, Bath and Chippenham, each of which have rail services. Devizes also has a daily National Express coach service to and from London Victoria, via Heathrow Airport. There is a regular bus service to and from Stonehenge.

Devizes is approximately from the M4. Several main roads pass through the town, including the A360, A361 and A342.

The Kennet and Avon Canal was built under the direction of John Rennie between 1794 and 1810, linking Devizes with Bristol and London. Near Devizes the canal rises by means of 29 locks, 16 of them in a straight line at Caen Hill. In the early days the canal was lit by gas lights at night, enabling boats to negotiate the locks at any time of day. The canal fell into disuse after the coming of the railways in the 1840s, but was restored between 1970 and 2003 for leisure uses. The Kennet and Avon Canal Trust run a museum at The Wharf in Devizes. The town is the starting point of the annual Devizes to Westminster International Canoe Marathon.

National Cycle Route 4 follows the canal towpath through the town.

==Education==
Devizes School, a secondary school with a sixth form, takes pupils from the town and surrounding area. It is situated in the grounds of the Southbroom House estate and the Grade II listed house forms its administrative core.

Downland School is a Community Special School for boys aged 11–16. Braeside is an outdoor education centre run by Wiltshire Council.

Devizes has six primary schools: St Joseph&#x27;s Catholic Primary School, Southbroom St James Academy, Southbroom Infants&#x27; School, Wansdyke Community School, Nursteed Community Primary School and The Trinity CofE (VA) Primary School. Nearby is Rowde CofE Primary Academy in the adjacent village of Rowde.

Long Street has had a number of private schools, beginning in the 18th century and proliferating in the 19th. Brownston House, a Grade I listed building, was the home of Miss Bidwell&#x27;s Ladies Boarding School from 1859 to 1901. A private Devizes Grammar School was established in Heathcote House in 1874 by the Reverend S.S. Pugh and carried on until 1919 by his twin sons.

The closest third-level institution is the University of Bath.

== Religious sites ==
Devizes has four Church of England parish churches, and has had nonconformist congregations since the 17th century.

=== Church of England ===
The two 12th-century churches, St. John&#x27;s and St. Mary&#x27;s, are Grade I listed buildings. They serve the parish of St. John with St. Mary which has always had one rector.
St. John&#x27;s stands close to Devizes Castle and may have begun as its chapel. The oldest parts of the building are from 1130, shortly after Roger, Bishop of Salisbury rebuilt the castle. Pevsner writes &quot;A major Norman church, dominated by a mighty crossing tower ...&quot;. The western part of the church was rebuilt in the 15th century. restoration was carried out in 1844 and 1862–3, including the west front designed by Slater. The ornate Beauchamp south chapel is similar to the 1492 Beauchamp and Tocotes chapel at Bromham; the north Lamb chapel has a fine panelled ceiling. The organ case is late 17th century.
St. Mary&#x27;s was built in the 12th century to serve the town outside the castle walls. Only the chancel survives, the rest being rebuilt in the 15th century, including the fine west tower. The east window is from 1852, and there was restoration in 1854 (Carpenter and Slater) and 1875–6. Since c. 2010, St. Mary&#x27;s Parochial Church Council have been exploring conversion of the church into a performance and community venue.
The church of St. James, Southbroom, stands on the edge of the green, next to the pond known as the Crammer. It was a chapelry of St Mary&#x27;s, Bishops Cannings until 1832. The civil parish of Bishops Cannings extended as far as the church until 1835, when the boundaries of Devizes borough were expanded. St. James&#x27;s is first recorded in 1461. The tower is 15th-century while the body of the church was rebuilt in 1831–2; the east window is by Wailes. After completion of the Le Marchant Barracks in 1878, St. James&#x27;s became the garrison church of the Wiltshire Regiment. The building is Grade II* listed and underwent an internal re-ordering in 2008. Today the church is evangelical in style.
St. Peter&#x27;s Church, west of the town centre, was built in 1865–6 to designs of Slater &amp; Carpenter; the south aisle was added in 1884. St Peter&#x27;s is Anglo-Catholic, with episcopal oversight by the Bishop of Ebbsfleet.

=== Other denominations ===
The Catholic church of Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception was opened in 1865 and extended in 1909. St. Joseph&#x27;s Catholic Primary School is adjacent to the church.

Maryport Street Baptist Chapel, which was built in 1780 and extended in 1785, 1818, 1864 and 1922, continues in use.

Salem Chapel, New Park Street, was built in 1838 by a pastor and followers from Maryport Street, who had left because of divisions in the congregation. They rejoined the parent body in 1895 and the building was used by the Open Brethren, later by Devizes Christian Fellowship and (since the mid 1980s) Rock Community Church.

The New Baptist Church was opened in 1852 during the pastorship of Charles Stanford. It replaced an adjacent Presbyterian chapel of 1791, which had been shared with disenchanted Baptist members from Maryport Street. The church continues in use as Sheep Street Baptist Church.

St. Andrew&#x27;s Church, Long Street, was built as a Methodist chapel in 1898, replacing an earlier chapel at New Park Street. It is now a combined Methodist and United Reformed Church.

The old Methodist Chapel in New Park Street was then used by the Salvation Army for many years until it was demolished. The Salvation Army then raised funds to build a hall on Station Road which opened in 1971; the Scout Hut on Southbroom Road was a temporary home in the late 1960s after the New Park Street hall was condemned. The Corps was closed in the 2010s, membership having dwindled from a peak in the 1970s, ending around one hundred years of association with Devizes.

A chapel was built at Northgate Street in 1776, at first for Calvinist Methodist worship, soon becoming Congregationalists. The building was enlarged in 1790 and extended in Early English style in the mid-19th century, becoming known as St Mary&#x27;s Congregational Church; from 1842 Devizes was the head of the Wiltshire and East Somerset Congregational Union. The congregation joined St. Andrew&#x27;s around 1987 and the building is now in residential use.

Quakers have a meeting room at Sussex Wharf, next to the canal.

==Emergency services==
Devizes is policed by Wiltshire Police, who have their headquarters on London Road in the town. Policing of Devizes was the responsibility of the City of Salisbury Police until Wiltshire Constabulary was founded in 1839 under the County Police Act 1839. It was the first county police force founded in the country, hence its motto &#x27;Primus et Optimus – The First and The Best&#x27;. The force is one of the largest employers in the town.

The headquarters site also houses the emergency control centre for police services in the county, in a building opened in 2003 by the Wiltshire Emergency Services partnership as a centre for all three emergency services, but since 2013 used only by the police. The headquarters building has housed the office of the Wiltshire Police and Crime Commissioner since the creation of that post in 2012. Wiltshire Air Ambulance was based at the police headquarters site until 2018.

Healthcare and ambulance response services in Devizes are provided by the National Health Service. South Western Ambulance Service have an ambulance station in Devizes.

Fire and rescue services in Devizes are provided by Dorset and Wiltshire Fire and Rescue Service, who have a fire station with a retained staff. They also have a training centre on the Hopton industrial estate.

<text>Mafeteng is a city in Lesotho, and the Camptown (capital city) of the district of Mafeteng. It is located about 76 kilometres south of the country&#x27;s capital, Maseru and has a population of approximately 61,000. The South African border town to Mafeteng is Wepener.

The town is said to be named after an early visitor, Emile Roland, who was nicknamed &quot;Lefeta,&quot; literally meaning &quot;traveller&quot; or &quot;passer-by.&quot; Mafeteng translates to English as &quot;The place of the passers-by.&quot;

During the Gun War of 1880/81 a great deal of fighting took place near Mafeteng. The cemetery, located near Mafeteng&#x27;s Bantu Stadium, contains an obelisk in memory of members of the Cape forces who fell in action in the area.

One of the sights in Mafeteng remains the Diphiring Mill, a fully working roller mill established outside the town by Mr. William S. Scott in 1912 and currently operated by the Osborne Family, millers by trade. The whole mill is run off a single engine by an intricate pulley system. Basotho people use the mill to process maize, wheat, millet and other grains.

Mafeteng has several industrial developments including a Gap/Old Navy clothing factory and the Lesotho Pharmaceutical Company (LPC), which also exports to several countries in the region. Mafeteng has two hotels, the Golden Hotel located on the road to Maseru and the Mafeteng Hotel located on Hospital Road. The hotels are the center of the town&#x27;s limited nightlife: each has a public and a private bar.

Mafeteng has little tourism although travelers occasionally stop at the Buy N Take en route to the Van Rooyen&#x27;s Gate border crossing at Wepener or Malealea Lodge, a tourist destination in Mafeteng District.

The Famo musician Mosotho Chakela was born in Mafeteng in 1963.

Mafeteng is home to Bantu Stadium. In the past it has hosted district track and field, volleyball, netball and soccer tournaments. The victorious teams move on to national competitions held in Maseru to represent their district. In 2004, the soccer team from St. Thomas High School progressed through the tournament at Bantu Stadium and secured the national championship. Subsequently, Bantu Stadium had to undergo closure for the renovation of its perimeter fences and spectator areas following the events of 2004.

<text>Postalveolar (post-alveolar) consonants are consonants articulated with the tongue near or touching the &quot;back&quot; of the alveolar ridge. Articulation is farther back in the mouth than the alveolar consonants, which are at the ridge itself, but not as far back as the hard palate, the place of articulation for palatal consonants. Examples of postalveolar consonants are the English palato-alveolar consonants , as in the words &quot;ship&quot;, &quot;&#x27;chill&quot;, &quot;vision&quot;, and &quot;jump&quot;, respectively.

There are many types of postalveolar sounds—especially among the sibilants. The three primary types are &quot;palato-alveolar&quot; (such as , weakly palatalized; also &quot;alveopalatal&quot;), &quot;alveolo-palatal&quot; (such as , strongly palatalized), and &quot;retroflex&quot; (such as , unpalatalized). The palato-alveolar and alveolo-palatal subtypes are commonly counted as &quot;palatals&quot; in phonology since they rarely contrast with true palatal consonants.

==Postalveolar sibilants==
For most sounds involving the tongue, the place of articulation can be sufficiently identified just by specifying the point of contact on the upper part of the mouth (for example, velar consonants involve contact on the soft palate and dental consonants involve the teeth), along with any secondary articulation such as palatalization (raising of the tongue body) or labialization (lip rounding).

However, among sibilants, particularly postalveolar sibilants, there are slight differences in the shape of the tongue and the point of contact on the tongue itself, which correspond to large differences in the resulting sound. For example, the alveolar fricative and the three postalveolar fricatives differ noticeably both in pitch and sharpness; the order corresponds to progressively lower-pitched and duller (less &quot;hissy&quot; or piercing) sounds. ( is the highest-pitched and most piercing, which is the reason that hissing sounds like &quot;Sssst!&quot; or &quot;Psssst!&quot; are typically used to attract someone&#x27;s attention). As a result, it is necessary to specify many additional subtypes.
===Tongue shape===
The main distinction is the shape of the tongue, which corresponds to differing degrees of palatalization (raising of the body of the tongue). From least to most palatalized, they are &quot;retroflex&quot; (such as , unpalatalized); &quot;palato-alveolar&quot; (such as , weakly palatalized); and &quot;alveolo-palatal&quot; (such as , strongly palatalized). The increasing palatalization corresponds to progressively higher-pitched and sharper-sounding consonants.

Less technically, the retroflex consonant sounds somewhat like a mixture between the regular English of &quot;ship&quot; and the &quot;h&quot; at the beginning of &quot;heard&quot;, especially when it is pronounced forcefully and with a strong American &quot;r&quot;. The alveolo-palatal consonant sounds like a strongly palatalized version of , somewhat like &quot;nourish you&quot;.

The following table shows the three types of postalveolar sibilant fricatives defined in the IPA:

===Point of tongue contact (laminal, apical, subapical)===
A second variable is whether the contact occurs with the very tip of the tongue (an &quot;apical&quot; articulation ), with the surface just above the tip, the &quot;blade&quot; of the tongue (a &quot;laminal&quot; articulation ), or with the underside of the tip (a &quot;subapical&quot; articulation). Apical and subapical articulations are always &quot;tongue-up&quot;, with the tip of the tongue above the teeth, and laminal articulations are often &quot;tongue-down&quot;, with the tip of the tongue behind the lower teeth.

The upward curvature of the tongue tip to make apical or subapical contact renders palatalization more difficult so domed (palato-alveolar) consonants are not attested with subapical articulation and fully palatalized (such as alveolo-palatal) sounds occur only with laminal articulation. Also, the apical-laminal distinction among palato-alveolar sounds makes little (although presumably non-zero) perceptible difference; both articulations, in fact, occur among English-speakers.

As a result, the differing points of tongue contact (laminal, apical and subapical) are significant largely for retroflex sounds. Retroflex sounds can also occur outside of the postalveolar region, ranging from as far back as the hard palate to as far forward as the alveolar region behind the teeth. Subapical retroflex sounds are often palatal (and vice versa), which occur particularly in the Dravidian languages.

===Position of tongue tip (laminal &quot;closed&quot;)===
There is an additional distinction that can be made among tongue-down laminal sounds, depending on exactly where behind the lower teeth the tongue tip is placed. A bit behind the lower teeth is a hollow area (or pit) in the lower surface of the mouth. When the tongue tip rests in the hollowed area, there is an empty space below the tongue (a &quot;sublingual cavity&quot;), which results in a relatively more &quot;hushing&quot; sound. When the tip of the tongue rests against the lower teeth, there is no sublingual cavity, resulting in a more &quot;hissing&quot; sound. Generally, the tongue-down postalveolar consonants have the tongue tip on the hollowed area (with a sublingual cavity), whereas for the tongue-down alveolar consonants, the tongue tip rests against the teeth (no sublingual cavity), which accentuates the hissing vs. hushing distinction of these sounds.

However, the palato-alveolar sibilants in Northwest Caucasian languages such as the extinct Ubykh have the tongue tip resting directly against the lower teeth rather than in the hollowed area. Ladefoged and Maddieson term it a &quot;&quot;closed&quot; laminal postalveolar&quot; articulation, which gives the sounds a quality that JC Catford describes as &quot;hissing-hushing&quot; sounds. Catford transcribes them as (that is not IPA notation; the obsolete IPA letters have occasionally been resurrected for these sounds).

A laminal &quot;closed&quot; articulation could also be made with alveolo-palatal sibilants and a laminal &quot;non-closed&quot; articulation with alveolar sibilants, but no language appears to do so. In addition, no language seems to have a minimal contrast between two sounds based only on the &quot;closed&quot;/&quot;non-closed&quot; variation, with no concomitant articulatory distinctions (for all languages, including the Northwest Caucasian languages, if the language has two laminal sibilants, one of which is &quot;closed&quot; and the other is &quot;non-closed&quot;, they will also differ in some other ways).

===Examples===
A few languages distinguish three different postalveolar sibilant tongue shapes () such as the Sino-Tibetan Northern Qiang and Southern Qiang, which make such a distinction among affricates (but only a two-way distinction among fricatives) and the Northwest Caucasian languages Ubykh (now extinct) and Abkhaz. More common are languages such as Mandarin Chinese and Polish, which distinguish two postalveolar sibilants, typically since they are maximally distinct.

The attested possibilities, with exemplar languages, are as follows. IPA diacritics are simplified, and some articulations would require two diacritics to be fully specified, but only one is used to keep the results legible without the need for OpenType IPA fonts. Also, Peter Ladefoged, whose notation is used here, has resurrected an obsolete IPA symbol, the under dot, to indicate the apical postalveolar, which is normally included in the category of retroflex consonants. The notation is sometimes reversed, and either may also be called &#x27;retroflex&#x27; and written .


==Postalveolar non-sibilants==
Non-sibilant sounds can also be made in the postalveolar region, the number of acoustically distinct variations is then significantly reduced. The primary distinction for such sounds is between laminal palatalized and apical retroflex non-palatalized. (Subapical retroflex non-sibilants also occur but tend to be palatal, as for sibilants.)

===Non-palatalized (retroflex)===
Retroflex stops, nasals and laterals (like ) occur in a number of languages across the world such as in South Asian languages such as Hindi and various East Asian languages such as Vietnamese. The sounds are fairly rare in European languages but occur, for example, in Swedish; they are then often considered to be allophones of sequences such as or . Also, for some languages that distinguish &quot;dental&quot; vs. &quot;alveolar&quot; stops and nasals, they are actually articulated nearer to prealveolar and postalveolar, respectively.

The normal rhotic consonant (&quot;r&quot;-sound) in American English is a retroflex approximant (the equivalent in British English is a postalveolar approximant ). Retroflex rhotics of various sorts, especially approximants and flaps occur commonly in the world&#x27;s languages. Some languages also have retroflex trills. Toda is particularly unusual in that it has &quot;six&quot; trills, including a palatalized/non-palatalized distinction and a three-way place distinction among dental, alveolar and retroflex trills.

===Palatalized===
Palatalized postalveolar non-sibilants are usually considered to be alveolo-palatal. Some non-sibilant sounds in some languages are said to be palato-alveolar rather than alveolo-palatal, but in practice, it is unclear if there is any consistent acoustic distinction between the two types of sounds.

In phonological descriptions, alveolo-palatal postalveolar non-sibilants are usually not distinguished as such but are considered to be variants of either palatal non-sibilants (such as or of palatalized alveolar non-sibilants (such as ). Even the two types are often not distinguished among nasals and laterals, as almost all languages have only one palatalized/palatal nasal or lateral in their phonemic inventories. For example, the sound described as a &quot;palatal lateral&quot; in various Romance languages and often indicated as is most often alveolo-palatal (like in Catalan and Italian) and sometimes a palatalized alveolar , such as in some northern Brazilian Portuguese dialects.

The IPA does not have specific symbols for alveolo-palatal non-sibilants, but they can be denoted using the advanced diacritic like . Sinologists often use special symbols for alveolo-palatal non-sibilants, , created by analogy with the curls used to mark alveolo-palatal sibilants. However, the actual sounds indicated using these symbols are often palatal or palatalized alveolar rather than alveolo-palatal, like the variation for symbols like . The decision to use the special alveolo-palatal symbols in sinology is largely based on distributional similarities between the sounds in question and the alveolo-palatal sibilants, which are prominent in many East Asian languages.

===Examples===
Some languages distinguish palatalized (alveolo-palatal) and non-palatalized (retroflex) postalveolar nasals and/or laterals.

Some Australian languages distinguish four coronal nasals and laterals: laminal dental , apical alveolar , laminal postalveolar (palatalized) , and apical postalveolar (retroflex) .

==Postalveolar clicks==
There are two postalveolar click types that can occur, commonly described as &quot;postalveolar&quot; and &quot;palatal&quot;, but they would be perhaps more accurately described as apical and laminal postalveolar, respectively:

The total area of the district was 2,119 which was 6.98 per cent of the total area of the country. The density of population in the district was 91.00 per km2. As of 2008, there were 49 per cent economically active people in the district. There were totally 127,664 employed people out of a total of 262,454 people in the district above 15 years of age.

==Demographics==
As of 2006, the district had a population of 192,621, 10.26 per cent of the population of the country. The area of the district was 2,119, 6.98 per cent of the country. The population density in the district was 91.00 persons per square kilometre, compared to 62 for the country. There were nine constituencies and twelve community councils in the district.

In the west, Mafeteng borders on the Free State Province of South Africa. Domestically, it borders on the following districts Maseru District in the northeast and Mohale&#x27;s Hoek District in the southeast. The Western districts of Lesotho has predominantly low land zone with an elevation of above the sea level. These lands are the major agricultural zones in the country. The average annual rainfall in the country is , most of which is received during the rainy season of October to April. Though it rains during all the months of the year, groundwater is limited on account of run-offs. The region has a temperate climate on account of the elevation and is humid during most parts of the year. The temperature in low lands vary from to in the winter.

==Economy==
As of 2008, there were 49 per cent economically active people in the district. There were totally 127,664 employed people out of a total of 262,454 people in the district above 15 years of age. The employed population in the age group of 6–14 years was 2,372 out of a total of 75,748 people in the district in the age group. The labour force participation stood at 193.50.

==Administration==
The constituencies of Mafeteng District are Thaba-Phechela, Phoqoane, Matelile, Maliepetsane, Thabana-Morena, Qalabane and Mafeteng. The Community councils of Mafeteng District are Koti-Se-Phola, Makaota, &#x27;Makholane, &#x27;Malakeng, Malumeng, &#x27;Mamantšo, Monyake, Mathula, Metsi-Maholo, Qibing, Ramoetsana and Tajane As per the 1968 Local Government Repeal Act - Development Committees Order No.9 of 1986, a District Development Committee (DDC) should have a set of Ward Development Committees (WDC) for each ward and Village Development Committees (VDC) under it. Each VDC has a set of seven elected members and the head would be an ex-officio member and chairman of the committee. The WDC is composed of twelve members elected from about VDCs, whose chairman would be and ex-officio
member. The fifteen-membered DDC is elected by the members of WDC. When there are cases of more than one DDC, the chiefs would alternate in meetings. The district secretary co-ordinates the activities of the various committees. As per the Local Government Amendment Act 2004, the District Development Coordination Committee was established as the supreme body of district administration, under which all the district councils were branched. The urban and municipal councils were under each district council, which in turn had community councils under it. The Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) is responsible for the administration of the Local Government Elections. The nation&#x27;s first local government elections were conducted in April 2005, while the most recent elections were held in October 2011. During these elections, 64 community councils, 11 urban
councils and one municipal council were elected.

<text>Rother Valley is a constituency represented in the House of Commons of the UK Parliament by Jake Richards, a member of the Labour Party.

==History==
This constituency was created by the Representation of the People Act 1918. Unusually in the light of the events of the Labour Party&#x27;s early 20th-century years, the seat had been represented by a member of that party continuously since the seat was formed. The size of the majorities historically have not been particularly marginal in the elections, until the 2017 general election in which the majority was less than 4,000 votes. Nonetheless, this was still considered a safe seat for the party, until the 2019 general election in which the Conservatives won the seat for the first time. Labour regained the seat at the 2024 general election.

== Boundaries ==

=== Historic ===

1918–1950: The Urban Districts of Handsworth; and Swinton; and the Rural Districts of Kiveton Park; and part of Rotherham.

1950–1983: The Urban Districts of Maltby; and Rawmarsh; and the Rural Districts of Kiveton Park; and Rotherham.

1983–2010: The Borough of Rotherham wards of: Anston and Woodsetts, Aston, Orgreave and Ulley, Brinsworth, Catcliffe and Treeton, Kiveton Park, Maltby, St. John’s and Thurcroft and Whiston.

2010–2024: The Metropolitan Borough of Rotherham wards of: Anston and Woodsetts; Dinnington; Hellaby; Holderness; Maltby; Rother Vale; Sitwell; and Wales

Parliament accepted the Boundary Commission&#x27;s Fifth Periodic Review of Westminster constituencies which slightly altered this constituency for the 2010 general election.

=== Current ===
Following the 2023 periodic review of Westminster constituencies which came into effect for the 2024 general election, the constituency comprises the following:

* The Metropolitan Borough of Rotherham wards of: Anston &amp; Woodsetts; Aston &amp; Todwick; Aughton &amp; Swallownest; Dinnington; Hellaby &amp; Maltby West; Maltby East; Sitwell; Thurcroft &amp; Wickersley South; Wales.

&quot;Minor changes to reflect modification of local authority ward boundaries.&quot;

Rother Valley constituency covers an area in the Metropolitan Borough of Rotherham south of Rotherham itself. It is bordered by the constituencies of Bassetlaw, Bolsover, Derbyshire North East, Don Valley, Rotherham, Sheffield South East, and Wentworth and Dearne.

==Constituency profile==
The constituency consists of Census Output Areas of one local government district: a working population whose income is on average slightly below the national average and close to average reliance upon social housing. At the end of 2012 the unemployment rate in the constituency stood as 4.0% of the population claiming jobseekers allowance, compared to the regional average of 4.7%. This was considerably lower than the rate in the Rotherham constituency of 7% and 9.6% male unemployment.

The borough contributing to the seat has a relatively high 26.6% of its population without a car compared to 20.1% in Bassetlaw and 30.3% in Sheffield. In terms of extremes of education 29.8% of the population in 2011 were without qualifications contrasted with 17.4% with level 4 qualifications or above.

In terms of tenure 65.2% of homes are owned outright or on a mortgage as at the 2011 census across the borough. In the 10 years to the April 2011 Census the social rented sector saw a 4.9% reduction and the private rented sector a 5.3% increase; outright ownership saw a 3.8% increase.

<text>Reddish is an area of the Metropolitan Borough of Stockport, Greater Manchester, England, south-east of Manchester city centre. At the 2011 census, the population was 28,052. Historically part of Lancashire, Reddish grew rapidly in the Industrial Revolution and still retains landmarks from that period, such as Houldsworth Mill, a former textile mill.

Reddish Vale is a country park.

==History==
===Toponymy===
Reddish is recorded as Redich (1205, 1212), Redych, Radich (1226), Radish, Rediche (1262), Redditch (1381), Redwyche, Radishe and Reddishe (16th century). The name either means &quot;reedy ditch&quot; (OE &quot;hrēod-dīc&quot;) or &quot;red ditch&quot; (OE &quot;rēad-dīc&quot;). Ekwall (1922) allows either form, stating &quot;red&quot; is less probable; Mills (1991) and Arrowsmith (1997) only give the &quot;reed&quot; option. The ditch referred to is possibly the Nico Ditch, an earthwork of uncertain origin bordering Reddish, Manchester and Denton. Folklore has it that the names Gorton and Reddish arose from a battle between Saxons and Danes. John Higson wrote in 1852

The neigh&#x27;ring trench is called the Nicker DitchFlowing with blood, it did the name conveyTo th&#x27; bordering hamlet, Red-Ditch. Near here, Wherethe last &#x27;tween the foes was fought,Where victory was won, that memorableEminence proudly was distinguishedBy the name of Winning Hill. The streamletAforemention&#x27;d gains appellationOf Gore Brook, also the contiguousHappy hamlet through which it floweth stillBears, in glorious commemoration,And e&#x27;er shall, the honour&#x27;d name of Gore Town.

Farrer and Brownbill dismiss this interpretation as &quot;popular fancy&quot;.

===1066 to late 18th century===

Reddish does not appear in the Domesday survey; this is in common with most of the then southeast Lancashire area. A corn mill is known to have existed at the junction of Denton Brook and the River Tame from about 1400 onwards. The two main mediaeval houses were Reddish Hall at (demolished 1780, but visible on maps dated 1840) and Hulme Hall at , later known as Broadstone, then Broadstone Hall (demolished 1945). The Reddish family were major landowners in the area from at least 1212 to 1613 when title passed by marriage to the Coke family. It passed down the family to Thomas Coke, 1st Earl of Leicester, who sold his land in Reddish at the end of the 18th century, and in 1808 it was bought by Robert Hyde Greg and John Greg. There were Hulmes in Reddish in the 13th century, and the land passed through the family until about 1700 when it was given to a charitable trust.

Very few buildings in Reddish pre-date the 19th century. Canal Bridge Farm, close to Broadstone Mill, is dated to the mid to late 18th century (the name is later). Hartwell dates a small group of farm buildings and cottages at Shores Fold, near the junction of Nelstrop Road and Marbury Road, to the sixteenth and late seventeenth to early 18th century. These would have been on the traditional Reddish – Heaton Norris border, but are now firmly inside Heaton Chapel.

===Industrial Revolution===
The Stockport Branch Canal passed through Reddish and opened in 1797. It seems to have had little effect by 1825, when Corry&#x27;s description of Reddish, in full, was &quot;The population of Reddish is but thin&quot;. Booker states that in 1857 Reddish was almost entirely agricultural, being made of meadow and pasture (); arable land (); wood and water (); and buildings and streets (). At that time, Reddish contained &quot;neither post-office, schoolmaster, lawyer, doctor, nor pawnshop&quot;. The population increased over tenfold in the next fifty years with the Industrial Revolution.

The water-powered calico printworks in Reddish Vale on the River Tame is known to have been working before 1800. Industrial development followed the line of the canal and was steam-powered throughout. A variety of manufacturers moved into Reddish during this period.

Robert Hyde Greg and John Greg, sons of Samuel Greg of Quarry Bank Mill, who owned about a third of Reddish by 1857, opened Albert Mills for cotton spinning in 1845. Moor Mill, manufacturing knitting machines, was built around the same time. William Houldsworth&#x27;s Reddish Mill for cotton spinning was opened in 1864. Hanover Mill was built in 1865 for cotton spinning, but in 1889 was converted to make silk, velvet, woven fur etc.

The Reddish Spinning Company, partly owned by Houldsworth, opened in 1870. Furnival &amp; Co, making printing presses, opened in 1877. Andrew&#x27;s Gas Engine works opened in 1878. The Manchester Guardian&#x27;s printworks opened in 1899. Craven Brothers, a manufacturer of machine tools and cranes, opened the Vauxhall Works on Greg Street, in 1900. Broadstone Spinning Company opened a large double mill in 1906/7. These major employers were accompanied by numerous smaller concerns, including dyeworks, bleachworks, wire ropeworks, brickworks, screw manufacturers, makers of surveying equipment, and a tobacco factory.

A small number of closures of major industrial employers took place in the first half of the 20th century, due to the ebb and flow of trade. Andrew&#x27;s Gas Engine Works was taken over in 1905 by Richard Hornsby &amp; Sons of Grantham, the business was transferred to Grantham and the Reddish works closed some time during the great depression following WWI. Cronin indicates that the works were still in operation in 1930. The Atlas wire rope works closed in 1927.

Reddish took its share of the decline in Lancashire cotton production and finishing. Broadstone Mills ceased production in 1959; Reddish Mills closed in 1958 with the loss of 350-400 jobs; Spur Mill followed in 1972; and the long-lived Reddish Vale printworks closed by 1975; Albert Mill continued to trade as R. Greg and co under new ownership, but finally closed in 1982. Ashmore wrote in 1975 that &quot;Stockport has ceased to be a cotton town.&quot;

The decline of Broadstone Mills was accompanied by high farce. In November 1958 the company sold a number of spinning mules as scrap for just over £3,000. By agreement, the machines remained in the mill over the winter. A small number had been broken and removed by April 1959, when the government announced a compensation package for firms that agreed to scrap spinning capacity. As the title in the mules had passed to the scrapman, it was decided that the company was not entitled to compensation amounting to over £60,000, despite the fact that the machinery was still on its premises. Actions in the High Court and the Court of Appeal in 1965 were fruitless.

Some of the mills vacated by the spinners found other uses. The Reddish Spinning Company&#x27;s mill was taken over by V. &amp; E. Friedland who became the world&#x27;s largest manufacture of doorbells; an extension to the mill won several architectural awards. The mill is now residential. Broadstone Mill was partly demolished, but now houses small commercial units. Regeneration efforts at Houldsworth Mill were instrumental in Stockport Council winning British Urban Regeneration Association&#x27;s award for best practice in regeneration. £12 million has been spent to convert the mill into mixed use. The area around Houldsworth mill is now designated as a conservation area.

===Brewing, pubs and clubs===
Reddish has been home to at least three breweries. Richard Clarke &amp; Co brewed in the area for over 100 years, before being taken over, and later closed, by Boddingtons in 1962. David Pollard&#x27;s eponymous brewery opened in the former print works in Reddish Vale in 1975, moving out to Bredbury in 1978; the business went into liquidation in 1982. The small 3 Rivers Brewery started brewing in Reddish in 2003 but had ceased brewing when the company was wound up in 2009.

The pub stock is not well-regarded: &quot;Never offering the best selection of pubs in the borough, it is now easily the worst area for real ale availability ...&quot; is a typical description. It has been suggested that this may be a consequence of Robert Hyde Greg&#x27;s disapproval of alcohol, (due to the alcoholism of an uncle of his father, see also Samuel Greg).
The pubs are supplemented by several working men&#x27;s and political clubs. The Houldsworth WMC was awarded a blue plaque by Stockport MBC in December 2006. Reddish WMC was founded by in 1845 by millowner Robert Hyde Greg as a Mechanics&#x27; Institute and Library. Its members claim it to be the oldest club registered with the CIU.

==Governance==
The extents have been well-defined for at least several hundred years. Reddish was a township and chapelry in the ancient parish of Manchester, but lay outside the Manor of Manchester. This had the effect that boundaries of Reddish were described by the boundaries of the Manor of Manchester, with the exception of that with Cheshire, which was the River Tame. The manor boundaries were surveyed and recorded in 1322, and the relevant part was:

following the said water [Tame] to the mid [stream] between the county of Chester and Assheton unto the Mereclowe at Redyshe so following Mereclowe unto Saltergate, from thence following the ditch of Redyshe unto Mikeldiche, following that unto Peyfyngate, following that unto Le Turrepittes between Heton Norreyes and Redishe, from thence following Le Merebroke unto the confluence of the waters of Tame and Mersey

&quot;Mere&quot; means boundary in this context. The description was traced into early 20th century features by Crofton and can be cast as

following the middle of the Tame as far as Denton Brook at Reddish; and so following Denton Brook and a tributary as far as Thornley Lane South; and then following Thornley Lane as far as Nico Ditch; and following Nelstrop Road as far as the turf-pits between Heaton Norris and Reddish (these are lost); and from there following Black Brook as far as near the conjunction of the waters of the Tame and Goyt.

However, Black Brook cannot be le Merebroke as it does not flow to the Tame, but joins Cringle Brook, which flows into the Mersey several miles away via Chorlton Brook. With this exception, Crofton&#x27;s interpretation of the 1322 boundaries matches those shown on Ordnance Survey maps of the 19th century.

In 1866 Reddish became a separate civil parish. Reddish became an urban district in 1894. By 1901 the neighbouring County Borough of Stockport had effectively run out of land, and was overflowing into abutting districts. In 1901, after petitioning the Local Government Board, Stockport expanded into several areas including the whole of Reddish, described by Arrowsmith as Stockport&#x27;s &quot;greatest prize&quot;. Stockport gained Reddish&#x27;s tax income and building land, and in return Reddish received several civic amenities. A council school opened in 1907, and a combined fire station, free library, and baths opened in stages during 1908 (Cronin identifies a small building at the rear as a mortuary). The council opened new municipal parks at Mid Reddish (on land presented by Houldsworth) and at South Reddish. A park at North Reddish followed, described in 1932 as &quot;recently laid out, provid(ing) a number of horticultural features combined with recreation facilities, and illustrat(ing) the layout of a modern recreation park&quot;. At that time, the Stockport Canal and the Reddish Iron Works made up two of the park&#x27;s boundaries.

The separate civil parish was merged into Stockport parish on 1 April 1935. In 1931 the parish had a population of 15,463. Reddish&#x27;s position north of the Tame means it was historically part of Lancashire. On the merger with Stockport in 1901 the boundary between Lancashire and Cheshire was moved to place it in Cheshire. In 1974 Stockport and several adjacient territories became a unified metropolitan borough in the newly created metropolitan county of Greater Manchester.

==Parliamentary representation==
The parliamentary constituency of Denton and Reddish has been represented by Labour MP Andrew Gwynne since 2005. At the 2010 general election, Gwynne got 51% of votes, and the second-placed Conservative candidate 25%. The seat has been held by Labour since its creation in 1983.

===Council representation===
Reddish is divided into two wards (Reddish North and Reddish South) for the purpose of electing councillors to Stockport Metropolitan Borough Council. Each ward returns three councillors.

As of May 2020, Roy Driver, David Wilson and Kate Butler (all Labour) represent Reddish North; Janet Mobbs, Jude Wells (both Labour) and Gary Lawson (The Green Party) represent Reddish South. The 2021 local election saw Reddish South&#x27;s first independent candidate, Daniel Zieba, who came fourth, beating the Liberal Democrats.

==Geography==
Reddish borders Heaton Chapel and Brinnington of Stockport; Denton of Tameside; and Gorton and Levenshulme of the City of Manchester.

Reddish is a densely populated area and is near to affluent parts of Greater Manchester, such as Heaton Chapel and Heaton Moor. Reddish continues to be an attraction to many people in the Greater Manchester area to work, live and relax.

===Climate===

Reddish has a mild climate. The main population is situated along a linear stretch parallel with Reddish Vale. Reddish Vale and the lower lying land in the valley is often cooler and effectively a &#x27;frost pocket&#x27;. It is still mild comparatively speaking; temperatures on a clear night will likely be colder than the land at the top of valley floor or, roughly speaking, along Reddish Road/Gorton Road. The effects of a Fohn Wind are often present here, where the warm air rises from the valley floor, tempering the air at the top and thereby reducing overnight lows, more particularly in winter.

As a comparison, temperatures on any given clear night throughout the year can be between 1-3 degrees C warmer than the Manchester weather station, situated at the nearby Woodford Aerodrome, but on a cloudy night are almost equal. Daytime highs are similar and predominately almost exacting to Woodford, though fluctuations due to localised weather patterns can produce variations.

Again, on a cloudy day, the temperatures can be slightly cooler than Woodford. Dependent on the prevailing weather patterns and the wind direction, temperatures can be either lower by around 1 degree C and occasionally (more noticeably on a warm sunny day) and in the absence of early morning mist/fogs(common in Woodford and Reddish Vale) can be up to 2 degrees C warmer than Woodford.

Due to its suburban nature and geographical location, close to the municipal centres of Stockport and Manchester, it benefits from an &#x27;urban heat island&#x27; effect.

Most of Reddish would be equivalent to Usda Zone 8B/9A in recent years and, with the influence of global warming, with typical annual minimum lows of around -5/-6C.

Summer high temperatures average around 20-21C and peak at around 28C in any given year, occasionally to around 32C.
Overnight lows average around 12-14C typically.

Winter high temperatures average around 6-9C. Winter overnight lows typically average around 3C.

Many tender plants can grow here and in the Stockport/Manchester area in general; the municipal planting consists of much New Zealand flora, such as Phormiums and Cordylines and Mediterranean plantings such as European Fan Palms and Canary Island date palms and Yuccas in residential gardens are commonplace.

==Demography==

White British is the predominant ethnicity. For the North Reddish ward, just under 97% of the population of 16,120 were identified as white (including Irish and other white), 1.48% as mixed-race, 0.73% as black, 0.6% as Chinese and 0.43% as Asian. For the South Reddish ward, just under 96% of the population of 13,935 were identified as White, 1.28% as mixed race, 1.28% as Asian, 0.86% as Black and 0.84% as Chinese.

The housing stock remains mainly terraced and semi-detached. For the North Reddish ward, the 6,914 housing units were divided into 8% detached house, 46% semi-detached, 36% terraced and 10% flats. For the South Reddish ward, the 6,598 housing units were divided into 5% detached house, 29% semi-detached, 44% terraced and 22% flats. There are no tower blocks in Reddish, unlike several neighbouring areas.

Some housing built by factory owners for their employees remains. Greg Street, Birkdale Road and Broadstone Hall Road South have mid-19th century terraces built by the Gregs for the workers at their, now demolished, Victoria and Albert Mills. Furnival Street was built in 1886 to house workers at the (demolished) Furnival&#x27;s ironworks The largest collection is that built by Houldsworth near to his Reddish Mill, even though only Liverpool Street and Houldsworth Street remain after clearance in about 1974. The houses on Houldsworth Street, directly facing the mill, are grander and would have been for the higher placed workers.

==Economy==
The shopping area around Houldsworth Square contains about eighty small shops and has been chosen as one of eight areas to benefit from the Agora Project, an EU-funded project to reverse the decline in local shopping areas.

Stockport MBC describes Reddish as one of the eight major district centres in the borough that offer &quot;local history, modern convenient facilities and traditional high street retailing&quot;. The other seven are
Bramhall, Cheadle, Cheadle Hulme, Edgeley, Hazel Grove, Marple and Romiley.

Reddish is home to many tertiary services. Houldsworth Square, named after local Victorian era mill-owner William Houldsworth), has many shops and banks serving the local population. There are schools, such as Reddish Vale High School in South Reddish, which in 2006 became the only school in Greater Manchester to be announced by the Government as a &#x27;Trust Pathfinder&#x27; school. In 2014, the school was judged by OFSTED as &quot;an inadequate school&quot; and was later put into special measures.

===Affluence===
There are several measures of overall wealth and poverty. The Human Poverty Index calculates a value based on longevity, literacy, unemployment and income. High values indicate increasing poverty. The parliamentary constituency scores 14.4, close to the UK average of 14.8. This compares well with neighbours Manchester Gorton (20.5) and Stockport (14.2), but poorly with the other Stockport constituencies of Hazel Grove (10.9) and Cheadle, placed third best in the UK with a value of 7.9.

On a narrower level, the estimated household weekly income for the period April 2001 to March 2002 for North and South Reddish wards was £440 and £400 respectively. In comparison with nearby wards, this is higher than Gorton North, Gorton South and Brinnington (at £350, £330 and £340 respectively), slightly lower than Denton West (£480) and significantly lower than Heaton Moor and Heaton Mersey (£590). The averages for the North-West region and the UK were £489 and £554 respectively (2001–4).

==Transport==

===Buses===
The B6167 was designated a Quality Bus Corridor in 2004 and a number of modifications made. As of 2006, any improvements have not been quantified. The main bus route is the high frequency service 203 operated by Stagecoach Manchester, which runs from Stockport via Reddish and Gorton to Manchester city centre. Less-frequent services run to Ashton via Gorton &amp; Droylsden; Ashton via Denton; Manchester via Didsbury and Rusholme; Hazel Grove; and Wythenshawe.

===Canal===
The Ashton Canal and the Stockport Branch Canal were built to join Manchester and Stockport to the coal mines in Oldham and Ashton-under-Lyne. The branch was dependent on the main for its utility, and hence its planning, passing through parliament, and construction came after that of the main. The main opened in 1796 and the branch in 1796. The branch was just under five miles (8 km) long; it left the Ashton Canal at Clayton, passed through Gorton &amp; Reddish and terminated just over the boundary in Heaton Norris, adjacent to what was then the main turnpike between Manchester and Stockport. The Beat Bank Branch Canal was planned as a sub-branch and was intended to cross Reddish Vale to a colliery at Denton, but the scheme was abandoned by 1798. By 1827, the canal was bringing coal to Stockport from as far as Norbury and Poynton.

The canal was purchased by the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway in 1848. Traffic declined and the canal was described as derelict as early as 1922. Commercial traffic ceased in the 1930s; the canal was declared officially closed in 1962 and filled in.

===Roads===
The B6167 is the main road through Reddish; it allows access to the A57 for Manchester or the M60/M67 junction at the north, and to Stockport and the M60 to the south. The road, currently designated Sandy Lane, Reddish Road, Gorton Road and Reddish Lane, was turnpiked by the Manchester, Denton and Stockport Trust following the Manchester and Hyde Turnpike Road Act 1818 (58 Geo. 3. c. vi).

===Railway===
Reddish North railway station lies on the Hope Valley Line between Sheffield, New Mills Central and Manchester Piccadilly. Services are generally half-hourly on Mondays to Saturdays, hourly on Sundays.

Reddish South railway station only has a weekly return &quot;parliamentary service&quot; on Saturday mornings, running between Stockport and Stalybridge.

The history of the development of rail infrastructure in the UK is complicated, with lines and stations being built by a myriad of railway companies and joint ventures. Routes did not always follow the best path; they were created, altered or blocked through lobbying of parliament by interested parties intent on protecting their interests and preventing competition. Due to their strategic position between Manchester and London, Stockport and Reddish played their parts. Reddish played host to three railway lines, two railway stations and a traction depot. To improve readability, the names of the stations and lines are the latest (or last) used.

====Reddish South====
The West Coast Main Line running between Manchester Piccadilly and London via Crewe was opened in 1840-2 by the Manchester and Birmingham Railway (M&amp;B), crossing the Mersey valley on a large viaduct at Stockport. In 1849, a line was opened from the north side of the viaduct via Reddish South and Denton stations to join the Woodhead Line (Piccadilly to Sheffield) of the Sheffield, Ashton-Under-Lyne and Manchester Railway (SA&amp;MR) at Guide Bridge. A short branch went to Denton Colliery. The station at Reddish South contained a large goods yard and trade through the station played an important role, alongside the canal, in the industrialisation of the area.

The M&amp;B became part of the London and North Western Railway (LNWR) by 1849; the SA&amp;MR became part of the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway (MS&amp;L) in 1847. At this stage, both companies used Piccadilly as their Manchester terminus. The LNWR held a monopoly on the important London route.

====Reddish North====
In 1862, the MS&amp;L built a line from Hyde Junction to near Compstall on the River Goyt. In 1865, this was extended over the river to New Mills and later joined the Midland Railway&#x27;s Derbyshire lines. By 1867, Midland trains were running from London to Piccadilly via this (considerably longer) route, providing competition to the LNWR. In 1875, the Sheffield and Midland Railway Companies&#x27; Committee, a joint venture between the MS&amp;L and the Midland, opened a new more direct route from near Romiley to Piccadilly giving Reddish its second station, Reddish North.

====Reddish Electric Depot====
The Midland was given notice to leave Piccadilly in the same year that Reddish North opened and construction of Manchester Central railway station started. The Fallowfield Loop line was opened in 1892, to allow access from the Woodhead Line to Manchester Central and Trafford Park, passing through a corner of Reddish. Stations were built just outside Reddish at Hyde Road and Levenshulme South. In 1936, the MS&amp;L&#x27;s successor, the London and North Eastern Railway, planned to electrify the Woodhead Line and the Fallowfield Loop line, primarily for shipping coal from Yorkshire, but World War II interrupted progress.

After the war, the railways were nationalised as British Rail (BR). The electrification plan was put in place as the Manchester-Sheffield-Wath electric railway, opening in 1954 using a 1500 V DC system.

Reddish Electric Depot was constructed to maintain the Class 76 &amp; Class 77 locomotives and Class 506 electric multiple units; the depot was also used to house the prestigious Midland Pullman in the early 1960s. The building was 400 ft (120 m) long. However, electrification was not continued beyond the depot to Trafford Park. Shortly afterwards, BR adopted the 25 kV AC system for electrification, with the effect that the Woodhead Line &quot;passed very quickly from ultra-modern to obsolescent&quot;.

Local passenger services stopped using the Fallowfield Loop line in 1958, although through trains continued until 1969. The Beeching Report of 1963 recommended that the Woodhead Line be retained and the Hope Valley line, serving Reddish North station, to be closed; in 1966, BR controversially implemented the reverse.

The depot continued to service locomotives and electric multiple units until the Woodhead Line was closed in 1981. Despite rumours that the depot would be used to service the Manchester Metrolink, the depot fully closed in 1983; it was quickly vandalised and has since been demolished. The Fallowfield Loop line closed completely in 1988 and the track was taken up. The site has since been redeveloped as a housing estate.

==Education==
Reddish&#x27;s only secondary school is Reddish Vale High School. Sited on the edge of the green belt, the school has its own farm and is characterised by OFSTED as &quot;an inadequate school&quot; as of 2014. It teaches about 1,400 pupils from the ages of 11 to 16, but does not have a sixth form.

As of 2007, Reddish has ten nursery and primary schools, including some church schools (Roman Catholic and Church of England). It has been proposed to close three of these and build a new school. The site chosen was formerly a clay pit for a brickworks and later a landfill site. Much of the landfill took place before modern controls and there is local concern about the suitability of the site.

==Community facilities==
Of the 1907 facilities provided by Stockport, only the library is still open. The baths closed in 2005; there is a campaign to reopen them, but it does not have the backing of the council. The ground floor of the fire station is used as a community centre. The mortuary closed in the 1980s.

Reddish falls in the Diocese of Manchester for the Church of England, and the Diocese of Salford for the Roman Catholic Church.

<doc id="450809" wikidata="Q5205728" url="?curid=450809" title="DNA Lounge">
<text>DNA Lounge is an all-ages nightclub, restaurant and cafe in the SoMa district of San Francisco owned by Jamie Zawinski, a former Netscape programmer and open-source software hacker. The club features DJ dancing, live music, burlesque performances, and occasionally conferences, private parties, and film premieres.

DNA Lounge has seven full bars, two stages, four dance floors, and a full service pizza restaurant and cafe. Since 2001 the club has been providing continuous audio and video webcasts of all events free of charge.

== Layout ==

The club&#x27;s main room has a stage at one end and a bar at the other, with a wall-to-wall dance floor in between. Benches and cocktail tables line the walls downstairs. Above this, a balcony looks down on the dance floor and stage from three sides.

Behind the stage on the second floor is a large lounge consisting of two connected rooms, with its own dance floor and sound system.

On the upper floor of the connected pizza restaurant next door is a smaller live music venue with its own stage and a pair of dance floors in two rooms. Known as &quot;Above DNA,&quot; this space has its own entrance to the street as well as connecting doors to the main room balcony and upstairs lounge. On some nights, the main room and Above DNA operate separately, with different events in each. For larger events, all four rooms are connected together into one large venue. The entire second floor is not wheelchair accessible; there is no elevator.

For live shows, the capacity of the main room is around 800, and Above DNA is around 300.

== History ==

The venue first opened for business in 1983 as a leather bar called &quot;Chaps&quot;, owned by Chuck Slaton.

In 1985 it was purchased by Jim English, Jeff Mason and Brian Raffi who opened for business under the name DNA Lounge on November 22, 1985. The name was rumored to be an acronym for &quot;dancing, not art&quot;. Jim English left around 1988 to open Club Townsend.The earliest regular DJs were Ted Cousens, Adam Fisher, Michael Snyder, and Brian Raffi. One of the early doormen was Doc Martin, who later became a popular house music DJ after a residency on Monday nights as a DJ (and spinning a lot at Townsend, thanks to English, as he became a star).

Some nights were genre-specific, with both live bands and DJs. Notable nights and resident DJs included DJs Blackstone (who spun hip hop and rap on Wednesday nights), DJ Pause (who spun hip hop and rap on Monday nights), DJ Damon and DJ Matt (who spun Rock on Tuesdays), and were preceded by Kelly Spencer (who played punk and new wave). Many of DNA&#x27;s posters and flyers were designed by the San Francisco-based artists Scott Williams and Rex Ray. There were wildly psychedelic, fluorescent murals of strange and twisted monsters with stretched perspectives on the otherwise black downstairs walls and a black and white motif in the upstairs VIP lounge that was painted by celebrated late graffiti artist Keith Haring.

During the late &#x27;80s, the DNA offered a black membership card for $10 that offered free entry most nights. Employees got a gold card which allowed up to four guests at no charge, and there was a rumored &#x27;platinum&#x27; card that was said to be a free pass to unlimited entry, guests, and drinks. In the early &#x27;90s, the club hosted many rave-themed nights with acts including Right Said Fred, the Hardkiss Brothers and Tasti Box, and afterhours events such as Lift- it was an important venue in San Francisco rave history. The DNA Lounge was also one of the few bars in San Francisco that would serve the Flaming Dr Pepper, an ignited drink.

In 1994, the club was purchased by John Schneider, his brother, comedian/actor Rob Schneider (who was not an active partner in club operations), and restaurateur Tim Dale. From 1995 until 1998, the DNA was a popular late-night destination, featuring unpublicized shows by such top pop musicians as Prince and Metallica, and weekend dance parties headlined by retro bands Grooveline and the M-80s. But, starting in 1996, John Schneider had to devote the bulk of his time running their family hotel and resort business. They left the daily operations of the club to subordinates, and it fell into disrepair.

The club was purchased by Jamie Zawinski in 1999. The club was closed for extensive remodeling and soundproofing from April 1999 until it re-opened on Friday, July 13, 2001.

From 2001 through 2009, the club provided several publicly accessible computer terminals (running Fedora). They were eventually removed due to maintenance difficulties, and a belief that the prevalence of internet-enabled phones made them obsolete.

In 2011, Zawinski purchased the pizza restaurant next door to DNA Lounge, renaming it DNA Pizza, and announcing his plans to expand DNA Lounge into that space, combining the two businesses into a single all-ages nightclub, restaurant and cafe. That merger was completed in 2012, and the expanded club debuted on October 23, 2012.

When non-essential San Francisco businesses were forced to suspend operations in early 2020 due to the global COVID-19 pandemic, DNA Lounge continued hosting online-only events via its webcast. The venue announced it would be reopening for in-person events on June 19, 2021. It actually reopened a day earlier, on June 18, 2021, after 465 days of being closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. On July 31, 2021, DNA Lounge began requiring proof of full vaccination against COVID-19 for entry, and required proof of booster shots as of January 17, 2022 due to the Omicron variant. However, both of these policies were rescinded on April 19, 2022, as the club &quot;surrender[ed] unconditionally to the coronavirus&quot;, citing lax policies at other clubs and falling revenue.

=== Conflict with local regulatory agencies ===

During the period that DNA Lounge was closed for remodeling, Zawinski spearheaded a successful grassroots effort to maintain its late-night permits, facing opposition from several neighbors and the SFPD, but was unable to procure an all-ages license. In September 2008, after two and a half years of legal battles, the club&#x27;s operating permits were successfully modified to allow patrons of all ages, instead of only those 21 years of age or older.

The California Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control (ABC) launched an investigation against the club in 2009, resulting in an accusation of &quot;running a disorderly house injurious to the public welfare and morals&quot;, and asking for permanent revocation of the club&#x27;s liquor license, which would result in the club closing permanently.

The accusations pertain to lewd behavior at certain gay and lesbian events which no longer take place at the club. Members of the community were outraged by the ABC&#x27;s allegations and the severity of their proposed punishment. Many complained that ABC was unfairly targeting DNA Lounge, and their homosexual clientele in particular, pointing out that the specific allegations are far less &quot;lewd&quot; than the standard behavior at heterosexual strip clubs. ABC has not commented on this accusation. Many have claimed that ABC&#x27;s punishment is in retaliation to DNA&#x27;s successful appeal to receive an all-ages license, and that this appears to be part of a larger shift in policy by the ABC to crack down on all-ages music venues.

In April 2009, ABC ruled to revoke DNA Lounge&#x27;s liquor license. DNA promptly filed an appeal citing insufficient evidence in the ABC&#x27;s case as well as challenging the constitutionality of ABC&#x27;s code that pertain to regulating sexual behavior and morality. DNA Lounge remained in business, pending resolution of their appeal, and a legal defense fund soliciting donations was set up to help offset the cost of contesting the decision. On November 10, 2009, a settlement was announced, reducing the revocation of their license down to a 25-day suspension, effective January 4, 2010.

== Awards ==

DNA Lounge won &quot;Best Dance Club&quot; in the San Francisco Bay Guardian&#x27;s &quot;Best of the Bay&quot; readers&#x27; poll in 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2014, 2016, 2017, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, and 2024, and &quot;Best Bar Staff&quot; in 2011 and 2012.

A number of regular DNA Lounge events are perennial winners as well, including Bootie (&quot;Best Party Producers&quot;, &quot;Best Dance Party&quot;), Smash-Up Derby (&quot;Best Cover Band&quot;), Death Guild (&quot;Best Weeknight Dance Club&quot;, &quot;Best Dance Party&quot;), Hubba Hubba Revue (&quot;Best Burlesque&quot;), Bohemian Carnival (&quot;Best Circus Troupe&quot;), Trannyshack (&quot;Best Drag Show&quot;), Bearracuda (&quot;Best Club for Queer Men&quot;) and Fog City Wrestling (&quot;Best Body Slams&quot;).

On November 22, 2010, the date of DNA Lounge&#x27;s 25th anniversary, the San Francisco Board of Supervisors issued a resolution proclaiming that day to be &quot;DNA Lounge Day&quot;, &quot;to convey the City&#x27;s sincere respect for their ability to successfully run an entertainment business for the past 25 years.&quot;

On the same day, San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom presented the club with a Certificate of Honor, stating that the club &quot;contributes to the rich cultural history of San Francisco&#x27;s entertainment scene and our beloved historic South of Market District.&quot;

On December 11, 2017, the San Francisco Board of Supervisors and San Francisco Small Business Commission granted DNA Lounge Legacy Business status, stating that such businesses are &quot;the bedrock of our communities and a draw for tourists from around the world. Preserving our legacy businesses is critical to maintaining what it is that makes San Francisco a special place.&quot;

Cypress Hill&#x27;s music video for &quot;Insane in the Brain&quot; was filmed at DNA Lounge in 1993. In the background of some shots can be seen parts of the Keith Haring mural that used to adorn the walls of the upstairs lounge. The title sequence of the SingStar Amped video game was shot at DNA Lounge in 2007.

== Live music ==

DNA Lounge has been well known for both DJ dance nights and live concerts. Since the club was purchased by Zawinski, they have been focusing more on live music, and in 2008 they procured an all-ages liquor license to facilitate this. Live concerts are all ages, and most other events are 18+.

<doc id="450810" wikidata="Q1247835" url="?curid=450810" title="Kingswood, South Gloucestershire">
<text>Kingswood is a town and civil parish in the South Gloucestershire district of the ceremonial county of Gloucestershire, England. The town is situated east-northeast of Bristol.

Broadly speaking, Kingswood spans the area from John Cabot Academy in the west to the A4174 ring road in the east. Some areas which are in close proximity to Kingswood, such as Two Mile Hill and St George East (both located within the City of Bristol) and parts of Hanham and Warmley Hill are often considered to be part of Kingswood by locals.

The border between South Gloucestershire and the City of Bristol is situated at the western end of Kingswood&#x27;s High Street. Although anything beyond this point is technically no longer Kingswood &#x27;proper&#x27;, locals often consider the shops and residential areas that fringe the road named &#x27;Two Mile Hill&#x27; (located within the area of the same name) to be a continuation of Kingswood. In 2011 it had a population of 40,734.

==Governance==
In 1894 Kingswood became an urban district. On 1 April 1974 the urban district and civil parish were abolished, when the town became part of the Kingswood district of Avon. In 1996, Kingswood became part of the South Gloucestershire district. The Kingswood civil parish was recreated on 1 April 2023.

==Royal forest==
In Saxon times, The &#x27;King&#x27;s Wood&#x27; was a royal hunting estate which surrounded Bristol, extending as far as Filwood in South Bristol. &quot;From early days the Constable of Bristol Castle, the king&#x27;s officer in the area, was also the Chief Ranger of the Kingswood Forest and the first of these recorded is Ella who died in 920. At the edge of the forest, to the north of the River Froom, lay the little hamlet of Stapleton, the name of which is Saxon in origin, being held to mean &#x27;The farm, homestead or croft - by or near the Stapol, post or pillar.&#x27;&quot;

==Demography==

Up to the 2011 Census, Kingswood was considered by ONS as part of Bristol, being within its urban subdivision. This meant that Kingswood wasn&#x27;t recognised as an individual settlement either statistically or administratively. However, in the 2021 Census, Kingswood was separated out from the administrative area of Bristol and is now recognised as a settlement in its own right by the Office of National Statistics; this has resulted in Kingswood, when combined with Fishponds, becoming the largest built up area by population in the ceremonial county of Gloucestershire. Kingswood is made up of three wards: Woodstock, New Cheltenham and Kingswood Wards. These wards had a combined population of 40,734 in 2011, with a largely white British population.

Women in Kingswood had the fourth lowest life expectancy at birth, 74.3 years, of any ward in England and Wales in 2016.

==Transport==
Kingswood High Street is situated around 3 miles (5 km) south of the M4 and 2.5 miles (4 km) east of Lawrence Hill railway station. Buses connect the town to surrounding areas including the City Centre, Southmead Hospital, Keynsham and Cribbs Causeway. Six national rail stations currently exist within South Gloucestershire. However, they are all concentrated around the highly developed North Fringe area which encompasses Filton and Bradley Stoke. However, Bristol mayor Marvin Rees&#x27; proposals for a &#x27;Bristol Underground&#x27; envisage a line serving the East Fringe of Bristol.

==Coal mining==

The Kingswood area first came into industrial prominence in the late 17th century, because of coal mining. Typical of these were coal fields in the Easton and Coalpit Heath/Yate areas. The coal mining history still affects the town with gardens occasionally opening up. The local MP has petitioned in Parliament for full surveys of the coal mines under the town.

==The Whit Walk==
There is an annual procession held on the morning of the Whit Bank Holiday. Its origins are uncertain, but it appears to have taken place at least since 1939. The walk is the subject of an ethnographic study by the English anthropologist Timothy Jenkins.

<text>Mohale&#x27;s Hoek is the capital city of Mohale&#x27;s Hoek District in Lesotho. It had a population of approximately 40,040 in 2016.

==History==
Mohale&#x27;s Hoek had first been inhabited by the San who were found there by the Baphuthi around 1795. The Baphuthi settled in Kubake, the small mountain fortress shaped like a castle, near the present Likuena High School while some settled at Thaba-Ts&#x27;oeu. Chief Moorosi of the Baphuthi is said to have been there during the journey to this new home. They later settled below the foothills of Thaba-Linoha, north of the present Bethesda mission and the area was later called Maphutseng, which simply means the plural of a certain variety of a pumpkin. In singular it is Lephuts&#x27;e. This was found in plenty on the fertile bank of Maphuts&#x27;eng River. Some Baphuthi inhabited the area bordering Senqu River, Morifi and across the river into what is now Quthing. After 1824, the area was inhabited by Mohale, the younger brother of Moshoeshoe around the 1830s.

On expansion of Moshoeshoe&#x27;s kingdom into southern Lesotho, King Moshoeshoe sent his brother Mohale to administer the area where the Baphuthi and Basotho enjoyed a rather fragile friendship. After living for a while at Lifateng, Mohale established a substantial village at the place now known as Old Hoek (the present day Ha Ts&#x27;epo village) a few kilometres north of the present town. This village was destroyed in 1867 during the Seqiti War and was subsequently abandoned. In the year after the proclamation that made Lesotho British territory, an assistant commissioner was appointed to administer what was then called Cornet Spruit District - after the Makhaleng River. This would make Mohale&#x27;s Hoek the second oldest of all the district headquarters towns in Lesotho, except that the town was completely destroyed during the Gun War of 1880. Southwest to the town near the St Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral are the Motlejoeng caves which were used by the celebrated cannibal, Motlejoa during the Lifaqane. 
The town moved from Old Hoek to the present location because of a certain businessman of an English descent PB Jandrell.

<text>Moritz Albrecht Franz Friedrich Fedor von Bock (3 December 1880 – 4 May 1945) was a German &quot;Generalfeldmarschall&quot; (Field Marshal) who served in the German Army during the Second World War. Bock served as the commander of Army Group North during the Invasion of Poland in 1939, commander of Army Group B during the Invasion of France in 1940, and later as the commander of Army Group Center during the attack on the Soviet Union in 1941; his final command was that of Army Group South in 1942.

Bock commanded Operation Typhoon, the ultimately failed attempt to capture Moscow during the autumn and winter of 1941. The Wehrmacht offensive was slowed by stiff Soviet resistance around Mozhaisk, and also by the , the season of rain and mud in Central Russia. The Soviet counteroffensive soon drove the German army into retreat, and Bock was subsequently relieved of command by Adolf Hitler.

A monarchist, Bock was not heavily involved in politics, and he did not sympathize with plots to overthrow Adolf Hitler. Bock was also uncommonly outspoken, a privilege Hitler extended to him only because he had been successful in battle. 

Bock, his second wife, and his stepdaughter were killed by a strafing Royal New Zealand Air Force fighter-bomber on 4 May 1945 as they traveled by car towards Hamburg.

==Early life and World War I==

Fedor von Bock was born into an old Prussian military family in Cüstrin, Germany (now Kostrzyn, Poland), a fortress city on the banks of the Oder River in the Province of Brandenburg.

His father, Moritz Albert Karl von Bock, had commanded a division in the Franco-Prussian War of 1870–1871. His mother, Olga Helene Franziska von Falkenhayn, was the sister of Erich von Falkenhayn, Chief of the German General Staff during the First World War, and had relatives within the Russian aristocracy.
At the age of eight, Bock went to study at a military academy in Berlin. The education emphasized Prussian militarism, and he quickly became adept in academic subjects such as modern languages, mathematics, and history. He spoke fluent French, and some English and Russian. At an early age, and largely due to his father, Bock developed an unquestioning loyalty to the state and dedication to the military profession.

While not a brilliant theoretician, Bock was a highly motivated officer. As one of the highest-ranking officers in the &quot;Reichswehr&quot;, he often addressed graduating cadets at his alma mater, which closed in 1920. His theme was always that the greatest glory that could come to a German soldier was to die for the Fatherland. He quickly earned the nickname &quot;Holy Fire of Küstrin&quot;.

In 1905, Bock married Mally von Reichenbach (1887–1910), a young Prussian noblewoman. They had a daughter. In 1908, Bock entered the War Academy in Berlin, and after a year&#x27;s study he joined the ranks of the General Staff. He soon joined the Army League (&quot;Deutscher Wehrverein&quot;) and came to know Walther von Brauchitsch, Franz Halder, and Gerd von Rundstedt. By the time World War I began in 1914, Bock had reached the rank of captain; he served as a battalion commander in January and February 1916. He was decorated with &quot;Pour le Mérite.&quot;

==Inter-war period==
Bock stayed on as an officer of the post-war &quot;Reichswehr&quot; and rose through the ranks. In the early 1920s, General Hans von Seeckt, chief of the Army Command, named Bock head of a group tasked with building up what came to be known as the Black &quot;Reichswehr&quot;. It consisted of &quot;labour battalions&quot; (), purportedly made up of civilian volunteers attached to &quot;Reichswehr&quot; units, but its members wore &quot;Reichswehr&quot; uniforms and received their training and orders from it. Its actual purpose was to provide a way for the &quot;Reichswehr&quot; to circumvent the restriction in the Treaty of Versailles which limited Germany&#x27;s army to 100,000 men. Bock chose Major Bruno Ernst Buchrucker to build up the .

The Black &quot;Reichswehr&quot; under Buchrucker became infamous for its practice of using &quot;Feme&quot; murders to punish &quot;traitors&quot; who, for example, revealed the locations of weapons&#x27; stockpiles or names of members. During the trials of some of those charged with the murders, prosecutors alleged that the killings were ordered by the officers from Bock&#x27;s group. The journalist Carl von Ossietzky wrote: &quot;... [the accused] did nothing but carry out the orders given him, and that certainly Colonel von Bock, and probably ... General Seeckt, should be sitting in the dock beside him.&quot;

Several times Bock denied in court that the &quot;Reichswehr&quot; ministry had had any knowledge the &quot;Black &quot;Reichswehr&quot;&quot; or the murders they had committed.

On 27 September 1923, Buchrucker ordered 4,500 men of the Black &quot;Reichswehr&quot; to assemble outside of Berlin as the first preparatory step toward a coup. Bock, who was Buchrucker&#x27;s contact with the &quot;Reichswehr&quot;, was enraged, and in a stormy meeting berated Buchrucker for mobilizing the Black &quot;Reichswehr&quot; without orders. Bock stated that the &quot;Reichswehr&quot; wanted no part in Buchrucker&#x27;s coup. Despite his orders to demobilize at once, Buchrucker went ahead with the Küstrin Putsch on 1 October 1923, which ended in total failure. Following the putsch, Seeckt disbanded the Black &quot;Reichswehr&quot;.

In 1935, Adolf Hitler appointed Bock as commander of the Third Army Group. Bock was one of the officers not removed from his position when Hitler reorganized the armed forces during the phase of German rearmament before the outbreak of the Second World War. He remained a monarchist. Hitler reportedly said of him, &quot;Nobody in the world but Bock can teach soldiers to die.&quot; In 1936 Bock married Wilhelmine, née von Boddien (1893–1945).

Bock marched into Vienna at the head of the 8th Army in March 1938 during the Anschluss of Austria and played a key role in the annexation of the Sudetenland, also in 1938.

==World War II==
===Invasion of Poland===
By 25 August 1939, Bock was in command of Army Group North in preparation for the invasion and conquest of Poland. The objective of Army Group North was to destroy the Polish forces north of the Vistula. Army Group North was composed of General Georg von Küchler&#x27;s 3rd Army, and General Günther von Kluge&#x27;s 4th Army. These struck southward from East Prussia and eastward across the base of the Polish Corridor, respectively.

On 10 September Bock ordered the forces under his command to burn Polish villages located behind the front line to the ground if they were fired upon from the settlement and &quot;if it proves impossible to identify the house from which the shots came&quot;. By the end of the military occupation of the country on 26 October 1939 531 towns and villages had been destroyed across Poland. In five weeks, Poland was overrun by German and Soviet forces.

===Invasion of France===

Shortly after the conquest of Poland, on 12 October 1939 Bock was given command of Army Group B, with 29½ divisions, including three armoured divisions. These were tasked with advancing through the Low Countries and luring the northern units of the Allied armies into a pocket. Army Group B consisted of the 18th and 6th Armies. While his units were overrunning the Netherlands, in May 1940, Bock attempted to call on the exiled former &quot;Kaiser&quot;—Wilhelm II—at Doorn, but Bock was unable to gain admittance, the German troops guarding the residence having been instructed to prevent such visits.

Bock participated in the Armistice with France in late June 1940.

On 19 July 1940, Bock was promoted to the rank of field marshal during the 1940 Field Marshal Ceremony. At the end of August, Army High Command transferred Army Group B to East Prussia; this included Kluge&#x27;s 4th Army. On 11 September, Bock relinquished command of his occupation area in France to Field Marshal Wilhelm Ritter von Leeb.

===Invasion of the Soviet Union===

On 2 February, Bock met with Hitler and questioned whether the Russians could be forced to make peace even if the Red Army was brought to battle and defeated. Hitler airily assured Bock that Germany&#x27;s resources were more than sufficient and that he was determined to fight. In preparation for Operation Barbarossa, on 1 April 1941 Army Group B was re-designated as Army Group Center. Deployed in Poland, Army Group Center was one of the three army formations which were to lead the invasion of the Soviet Union. It included the 4th and 9th Armies, the 3rd and 2nd Panzer Armies and &quot;Luftflotte&quot; 2. On the left flank of Bock&#x27;s Army Group Center was Army Group North, commanded by Wilhelm Ritter von Leeb; on the right flank was Army Group South, commanded by Gerd von Rundstedt.

The main objective of Army Group Center was to follow the route north of the Pripyat Marshes to Moscow. Following the border battles, the task of Army Group Center was to drive towards the cities of Minsk and Smolensk, and destroy the Soviet armies stationed there in encirclement battles.

At 03:15 on 22 June 1941, the first shots of Operation Barbarossa were fired; Germany invaded the Soviet Union with a timed declaration of war.

Elements of Heinz Guderian&#x27;s force had crossed the Bug River and were bypassing the city of Brest-Litovsk. Hermann Hoth&#x27;s tanks were heading for Grodno on the Nieman River to seize the important river crossings. Several reconnaissance units from the 4th and 9th Armies had already crossed the Bug and Desna Rivers.

At 07:00, Bock flew from Posen to an advance airfield near the headquarters of XIII Infantry Corps. There, Major General Erich Jaschke gave Bock a summary of the progress of the invasion. Following this meeting, Bock visited Guderian&#x27;s forward command post at Bokhaly. Bock then visited Joachim Lemelsen, who gave a report from the front. The roads on the Soviet side of the Bug River were already becoming too soft to support the weight of tanks. Despite this, the first day of the invasion had been spectacularly successful. Soviet resistance was reported as being light and complete surprise was achieved. All along the front rapid progress was being made.

On the second day of Barbarossa, Bock crossed the Bug River escorted by Major General Gustav Schmidt. Later that day Bock was presented with reports that Soviet resistance was stiffening all along the front, especially on Guderian&#x27;s southern flank. 
Meanwhile, Hoth&#x27;s forces were advancing with much more ease through the Baltic states and Belarus. The first two days of Army Group Center&#x27;s advance proved to be highly successful. 

Hoth&#x27;s army advanced so quickly that Bock immediately contacted Walter von Brauchitsch, requesting the bypassing of Minsk in favour of attacking toward Vitebsk so that a drive could be made for Moscow. Initially, the change in plan was accepted but it was soon overruled by Hitler, who favoured the encirclement and destruction of the large Soviet armies near Minsk. Bock wrote in his diary:

Differences between Bock&#x27;s strategic intent and the intent of High Command repeatedly surfaced. Bock continued to favour a direct drive toward Moscow, bypassing Soviet armies and leaving them to be destroyed by infantry, which advanced on foot, well behind tank columns. Bock argued that if encirclement were truly necessary then instead of diverting his tanks north and south to encircle and destroy smaller Soviet armies, a larger encirclement should be made eastward toward the Dvina-Dnieper River basins.

Hitler decided against this plan, and insisted that the pockets containing Soviet armies must be destroyed before advancing deeper into Russia. Bock, enraged by this decision, was quoted as saying: &quot;We are permitting our greatest chance of success to escape us by this restriction placed on our armour!&quot;

He hesitantly gave the order to abandon the drive toward Vitebsk and assist in the destruction of the pockets. On 25 June, Bock moved his headquarters from Posen to Kobryn, a town about northeast of Brest-Litovsk. On 30 June, the 4th and 9th Armies met each other near Slonim, trapping thousands of Soviet soldiers. However, many Soviet soldiers managed to escape eastward. Bock soon gave the order to disengage from the encirclement and prepare for a full-scale drive to the east. This order once again caused a confrontation between Bock and Brauchitsch.

On 3 July, Bock&#x27;s forces were once again advancing eastward, with Guderian&#x27;s tanks crossing the Berezina and Hoth&#x27;s tanks crossing the Duna. This day marked the furthest distance covered by Bock&#x27;s troops in a single day, with over travelled. Four days later, Guderian&#x27;s tanks crossed the Dnieper, the last great obstacle before Smolensk. However, Guderian was soon ordered by Günther von Kluge to withdraw back across the river. Bock soon reversed this order, and Guderian was allowed to re-cross the river. Bock protested against Kluge&#x27;s actions to High Command, to no avail. On 11 July, Bock moved his headquarters again to Borisov, a Soviet town near the Berezina River. 

According to General Günther Blumentritt, as reported by British military historian B.H. Liddell Hart, one reason Kluge privately gave for preferring to interrupt his and Guderian&#x27;s drive for Moscow in July 1941 and to use their tanks instead for the proposed Kiev encirclement was that the change would temporarily put Kluge under the command of the amiable Rundstedt rather than leaving him under the thumb of Bock, who was &quot;a very difficult man to serve.&quot;

===March on Moscow===

On 9 September, Army High Command instructed Bock to prepare an operational order for the assault on Moscow. Operation Typhoon was the code-name given to this new attack, which was to begin no later than 30 September. Bock supervised the planning and preparation of the operation, and a few days later it was approved by the High Command.

As part of the preparation for Operation Typhoon, Army Group Center would be reinforced and replenished with men and vehicles; it would be composed of three infantry armies (the 2nd, 4th, and 9th) and three tank armies (2nd, 3rd, and 4th &quot;Panzer&quot;s). Colonel General Erich Hoepner would command the 4th &quot;Panzer&quot; Army, while the former two were outgrowths of Hoth&#x27;s and Guderian&#x27;s original &quot;Panzer&quot; Groups. The replenishment of Army Group Center for Operation Typhoon caused it to increase greatly in size: with almost 1.5 million soldiers, it was now larger than it was at the outset of Operation Barbarossa. Bock spent most of the remainder of September on inspection tours of his reinforced Army Group Center. On one occasion, Bock—along with Albert Kesselring—flew over Moscow.

On 29 September, Bock held a conference with his senior commanders Strauss, Hoth, Kluge, Weichs, Hoepner, Guderian, and Kesselring. During the meeting the main operational plan was reviewed, with Bock again stressing that Moscow must be taken by 7 November, before the onset of winter, and to coincide with the anniversary of the Russian Revolution. The following day, Operation Typhoon began with attacks from Guderian&#x27;s and Hoth&#x27;s armored forces. Several days later, the infantry armies began to move toward Moscow. With less than 150 km between the most advanced troops and Moscow, Bock estimated that his troops would enter the city in three to four weeks. Almost immediately, Bock&#x27;s forces encountered stiff Soviet resistance on the road to Moscow.

The 2nd &quot;Panzer&quot; Army—along with the XLVIII &quot;Panzer&quot; Corps—attacked important rail junctions near Oryol (Orel) and Bryansk. Hoepner&#x27;s 4th &quot;Panzer&quot; Army soon crossed the Desna River and gained access to deep Russian territory. Meanwhile, Hoth&#x27;s 3rd &quot;Panzer&quot; Army struck toward Rzhev on the Volga River.

On 3 October, Guderian&#x27;s forces captured Orel and subsequently gained access to a paved highway which led to Moscow, some away. Meanwhile, elements of the 2nd &quot;Panzer&quot; Army reported that they had bypassed Bryansk and were heading toward Karachev. Bock ordered Guderian to press on toward Tula, but within hours this order had been reversed by High Command. The reversal of the order called for Guderian to attack Bryansk where—along with Vyazma—two massive encirclements of Soviet forces were occurring. Bock argued that the area between Orel and Tula remained relatively free of Soviet forces and that Tula could be captured within hours. Ultimately, Bock agreed to divert Guderian&#x27;s tanks toward Bryansk.

Cold rain soon began to fall over the northern sectors of Army Group Center&#x27;s front, and the roads soon turned into quagmires as part of the Rasputitsa. Virtually the entire front became stuck; the only vehicles capable of negotiating the mud were tanks and other tracked vehicles. However, these moved at a snail&#x27;s pace (sometimes less than per day), and fuel consumption soared. This further aggravated the problem of already poor supply lines.

Slight improvements in the weather soon made it possible for Bock&#x27;s forces to continue to seal the pockets around Bryansk and Vyazma. The dual encirclements of Soviet forces around Vyazma and Bryansk yielded some of the largest Soviet casualties since the beginning of Operation Barbarossa: some 650,000 prisoners were taken during these two encirclements, after which the Soviet armies facing Bock&#x27;s Army Group Center no longer had the advantage of superior numbers. Bock was one of the few German officers to protest against the systematic maltreatment of Soviet prisoners of war, but took few steps to improve the conditions of those being held in the areas under his command.

The weather soon deteriorated again, with the roads once more turning into impassable, muddy quagmires. Since 30 September, Bock had lost some 35,000 men, 250 tanks and artillery pieces, and several hundred other vehicles, many of which were mired in the mud. Fuel and ammunition supplies became dangerously low. Despite these problems, the advance toward Moscow continued as Hitler became increasingly impatient. When advance units of the 4th &quot;Panzer&quot; Army reached Kaluga and Maloyaroslavets, German forces were within of Moscow. Guderian&#x27;s advance in the south was much slower. An attempt by his forces to capture Tula had failed, with considerable losses of men and tanks. However, other units captured Stalinogorsk and Venyov, indicating the possibility of bypassing Tula.

As Bock&#x27;s forces smashed through the Red Army defense lines at Mozhaisk in mid-October, panic struck in the capital. Hundreds of thousands of civilians began to evacuate the city while others were forced into emergency volunteer units. Martial law was instituted as looting and pillaging of deserted stores increased. Marshal Semyon Timoshenko was relieved of command in favor of Georgy Zhukov, who had been organizing the defense of Leningrad. The main bulk of the Soviet government was evacuated to Kuibyshev, southeast of Moscow; however, Stalin remained in the capital after being reassured by Zhukov that the capital would not fall.

The further Bock&#x27;s forces advanced, the stiffer Soviet resistance became. The paved roads leading to Moscow became craters under constant Russian artillery fire, rendering them impassable. This forced the German troops into the mud and Army Group Center soon became stuck once again. The goal of capturing Moscow by mid-October could no longer be achieved. However, the sheer weight of the German advance could not be fully stopped, and on 21 October units of the 9th Army captured Kalinin.

As November arrived the mud soon turned into ice as temperatures dropped to −28 °C (−20 °F). While the ground hardened sufficiently enough to support vehicles, the cold weather added to the miseries of the German soldiers as many had not received winter clothing. Frostbite soon took its toll; many soldiers were severely affected and had to be evacuated.

On 20 November, Bock moved his field headquarters to an advanced forward position near the front lines. There he visited an artillery command post, where he could see the buildings of Moscow through his field glasses. Several days later, German forces crossed the Moscow-Volga Canal and reached Khimki but soon fell back due to Soviet resistance. On 29 November, elements of the 4th &quot;Panzer&quot; Army reached the western suburbs of Moscow. On 4 December, units of the 2nd Army reached Kuntsevo, a western suburb of Moscow. Several units of Guderian&#x27;s army bypassed Kolomna and reached the Moscow River. Meanwhile, the 3rd &quot;Panzer&quot; Army once again fought into Khimki. These were the last advances made by Army Group Center under Bock&#x27;s command.

On 6 December, with the temperature at −45 °C (−50 °F), fresh Russian troops commanded by Zhukov launched a huge counterattack. All along the front near Moscow German troops retreated, destroying whatever equipment they could not salvage. Several days later, High Command ordered a halt to all offensive operations. Bock wrote in his diary:

By 13 December, German forces had retreated more than from the capital. On 18 December, Bock was relieved of his command of Army Group Center. The official pretext of this decision was health problems. However, this was just one case out of some 40 high-ranking officers being relieved of their command following the failure to capture Moscow.

===1942 Second Battle of Kharkov and Summer Offensive, Eastern Front===

He was reassigned to lead Army Group South on 20 January 1942, after the death of &quot;Generalfeldmarshall&quot; Walter von Reichenau from a stroke. Thus, in May 1942, he commanded the defending forces that delivered the devastating defeat to the Soviet winter offensive and severely depleted Soviet tank strength in the Second Battle of Kharkov. On 28 June 1942, Bock&#x27;s offensive split the Russian front into fragments on either side of Kursk. Three armies (Weich&#x27;s 2nd Army, Hoth&#x27;s 4th Panzer, and Paulus&#x27; 6th Army)—along with 11 &quot;panzer&quot; divisions—fanned out toward Voronezh and the Don River. Paulus&#x27; armoured divisions reached the Don on either side of Voronezh on 5 July. The Soviet High Command created a Voronezh Front under Nikolai Vatutin, who reported directly to Moscow. Bock wanted to eliminate Vatutin&#x27;s forces before extending his own flank too deeply into the void created by the strength and speed of the German offensive. Hitler was not pleased with Bock&#x27;s plan to delay the push toward Stalingrad. On 7 July, Hitler split Army Group South into Army Groups A and B. Army Group A was given to Field Marshal Wilhelm List to command. On 17 July, Hitler relieved Bock as commander of Army Group B, replacing him with Maximilian von Weichs. Bock never again occupied a senior command position.

===1945, Death===
Bock was injured on 3 May 1945, as his car was strafed by a Hawker Tempest from No. 486 Squadron RNZAF killing his wife, stepdaughter, and a friend. Initially the only survivor of the attack, Bock died of his injuries the following day. He was buried in a cemetery in Lensahn.

<text>Prince Józef Antoni Poniatowski (; 7 May 1763 – 19 October 1813) was a Polish general, minister of war and army chief, who became a Marshal of the French Empire during the Napoleonic Wars.

A nephew of the King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania Stanisław II August (), Poniatowski began his military career in 1780 in the Austrian army, where he attained the rank of colonel. In 1789, after leaving Austrian service, he joined the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth army at the request of his uncle. Poniatowski, now in the rank of major general and commander of the Royal Guards, took part in the Polish–Russian War of 1792, leading the crown forces at the victorious Battle of Zieleńce. After the king&#x27;s support for the Targowica Confederation of 1792, Poniatowski felt compelled to resign. In 1794 he participated in the Kościuszko Uprising and took charge of defending Warsaw - for which the Russian authorities subsequently exiled him until 1798.

In 1807, after Napoleon Bonaparte established the Duchy of Warsaw, Józef Poniatowski was appointed the minister of war. He commanded a 16,000-strong army during the Austro-Polish War (April to October 1809) and achieved tactical success over a larger and more experienced Austrian force in the Battle of Raszyn. There followed a Polish advance into the territory of Galicia. The conflict ended with a Polish victory, which allowed the Duchy to recover some of the lands lost in the Partitions of Poland.

A staunch ally and supporter of Emperor Napoleon I of France, Poniatowski voluntarily took part in the French invasion of Russia of 1812. Injuries received during the fighting for Moscow eventually forced his return to Warsaw, where he worked on the reconstruction of the Polish forces intended to fight in Germany. Covering the retreat of the French army after Napoleon lost the &quot;Battle of the Nations&quot; at Leipzig (1813), Poniatowski was repeatedly wounded and drowned in the Elster river.

==Early Austrian years and war with the Ottomans==

Prince Józef Antoni Poniatowski was born in Vienna, Austria in the Palais Kinsky He was baptized in Vienna&#x27;s Schottenkirche.

He was the son of Andrzej Poniatowski, the brother of the last king of Poland and grand duke of Lithuania Stanislaus II Augustus (born Stanisław Poniatowski), and a field marshal in the service of Austria. His mother was Countess Maria Theresia Kinsky von Wchinitz und Tettau (1740-1806), a court lady and a friend of Maria Theresa belonging to an old and influential Austro-Bohemian aristocratic family. His father died when Józef was ten, Stanislaus Augustus then became his guardian and the two enjoyed a close personal relationship that lasted for the rest of their lives.

Maria Theresa was the godmother of Józef&#x27;s older sister, who was also named Maria Teresa, after the Empress. Józef was born and raised in Vienna, but also spent time with his mother in Prague and later with his uncle the king in Warsaw. Brought up in the &quot;ancient regime&quot; society, he was tutored in French, and spoke to his mother in that language. He also learned Polish, German and later, Russian. As a child he acquired the nickname &quot;Prince Pepi&quot;, the Czech diminutive form of Joseph.

He was trained for a military career, but also learned how to play keyboard instruments and had a portable one which he carried with him later even during military campaigns. It was because of Stanislaus&#x27; influence that Poniatowski chose to consider himself a Polish citizen and he transferred to the Polish army at the age of 26. In Vienna, he represented the king at the funeral of Maria Theresa. In 1787 he travelled with Stanislaus Augustus to Kaniov and Kiev, to meet with Catherine the Great. Laure Junot, Duchess of Abrantès, wife of Jean-Andoche Junot, described Poniatowski in his mid-twenties as having been: handsome, brave, enterprising, and determined, as he himself once assured me, to undertake everything for the liberation of unhappy Poland

Having chosen a military career, Poniatowski joined the Austrian imperial army, where he was commissioned lieutenant in 1780, in 1786/1788 promoted to colonel, and, when Austria declared war against the Ottoman Empire in 1788, he became an aide-de-camp to Emperor Joseph II. Poniatowski fought in that war and distinguished himself at the storming of Šabac on 25 April 1788, where he was seriously wounded. At Šabac he also reportedly saved the life of a younger colleague, Prince Karl Philipp Schwarzenberg. Later their military paths crossed repeatedly, as friends and foes, and at the end of Poniatowski&#x27;s career Schwarzenberg delivered the crushing blow at the Battle of Leipzig in which Poniatowski was killed.

==Polish military service and defence of the 3 May Constitution==

Summoned by his uncle, Stanislaus II Augustus, and the Sejm when the Polish Army was reorganized, Poniatowski returned to Poland. The King had made previous arrangements with the Austrian authorities for this transfer, which in the end depended on his nephew&#x27;s willingness to make the move. In October 1789, together with Tadeusz Kościuszko and three others, Poniatowski received the rank of major-general, and was appointed commander of a division in Ukraine and devoted himself to rebuilding the small, and long-time neglected, Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth&#x27;s army.

This took place during the period of deliberations by the Four-Year Sejm, which ended with the proclamation of the 3 May Constitution in 1791. Poniatowski was an enthusiastic supporter of the reforms and a member of the Friends of the Constitution Association. The passage of the document was assured partially by the military forces under the Prince&#x27;s command, which surrounded the Royal Castle during the final proceedings. He himself stood in the room with a group of soldiers.

On 6 May 1792 Poniatowski was appointed Lieutenant-General and commander of the Polish army in Ukraine, with the task of defending the country against the imminent Russian attack. There Prince Józef was aided by Kościuszko and Michał Wielhorski, a friend from the Austrian service. In the fighting, badly outnumbered and outgunned by the enemy, obliged constantly to retreat, but disputing every point of vantage, he turned on the pursuer whenever the Russian pressed too closely, and won several notable victories.

The Battle of Zieleńce on 18 June was the first major victorious engagement of the Polish forces since John III Sobieski. Poniatowski personally got involved in the fighting when one of the Polish columns was faltering. To celebrate the victory and commemorate the occasion, the Polish king established the Virtuti Militari order, with which he decorated Poniatowski and Kościuszko first. At the Battle of Dubienka fought by Kościuszko and his soldiers on 18 July, the line of the Southern Bug River was defended for five days against fourfold odds.

The Polish armies converged on Warsaw and prepared for a general engagement. There a courier from the capital informed the Commander in Chief that King Stanislaus had acceded to the pro-Russian Targowica Confederation and had pledged the adherence of the Polish Army to it as well. All hostilities were to be suspended.

The army remained loyal to Prince Józef and he considered staging a &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; option that involved kidnapping the King, but after issuing contradictory orders, he finally decided not to do so. Supposedly distressed by the political situation, at the last skirmish of the war at Markuszów on 26 July he supposedly sought his own death, but was saved. After an indignant but fruitless protest, Poniatowski and most of the other Polish generals resigned their commissions and left the army.

In a farewell gesture, Prince Józef&#x27;s soldiers expressed their gratitude by having a memorial medal minted, and wrote to the Prince&#x27;s mother in Prague, thanking her for having such a great son. Poniatowski left Warsaw for Vienna, from where he repeatedly challenged the Targowica leader Szczęsny Potocki to a duel. However, the Russian authorities wanted him removed away from Poland even further, and the fearful king pressured him to comply. Poniatowski left Vienna to travel in western Europe, which at the time was traumatized by the violent events of the French Revolution.

In 1792 in a letter to the King, Prince Józef expressed his opinion that in order to save the country and preserve the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth he should have already at the outset of this campaign (since it was not properly prepared militarily) raised the whole country, led the nobility on a horse, armed the towns and given freedom to the peasants. The Polish–Russian War was followed by the Second Partition of Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth.

==1794 Kościuszko Uprising==

Stanislaus Augustus Poniatowski wrote to his nephew in the spring of 1794, urging him to return to Commonwealth and volunteer for service under his former subordinate Kościuszko, in what came to be known as the Kościuszko Uprising. Poniatowski came with Wielhorski again and reported for duty at Kościuszko&#x27;s camp near Jędrzejów on 27 May. Kościuszko proposed that Prince Józef lead the insurrection in Lithuania, where he was demoting the radical and successful leader Jakub Jasiński. However, Poniatowski not wanting to be so far from his uncle who needed him, declined. He suggested instead Wielhorski, which Kościuszko approved.

Poniatowski himself participated in combat in and around Warsaw; as a division commander he fought at Błonie between 7 and 10 July, and led cavalry in an anti-Prussian diversion at Marymont on 26–27 July. During the Prussian siege of the city Mokronowski was sent to Lithuania to replace the ailing Wielhorski and Poniatowski was given his post in Warsaw&#x27;s defense.

Between 5 and 10 August, in a victorious and promising series of confrontations, he took the Góry Szwedzkie region from the Prussians and then lost it after a couple of weeks in a counterattack, for which, despite Kościuszko&#x27;s warnings, he did not properly prepare. He was injured while trying to recover the lost ground when his horse was shot from under him. In October he led his outnumbered troops in an attack on Prussian entrenchments at the Bzura River, which, at the cost of heavy losses, tied up the Prussians and saved Dąbrowski&#x27;s corps by allowing it to return to Warsaw.

During the course of the war and revolution the Prince felt alienated by the actions and influence of the radical wing led by Hugo Kołłątaj, while the military cooperation between him, Dąbrowski, and Józef Zajączek was not what it should have been, and worsened after Kościuszko&#x27;s capture at Maciejowice.

==Withdrawal into private life==

The Insurrection having failed, Poniatowski stayed for a while in Warsaw, his estates were confiscated, but having refused a position in the Russian army and unwilling to comply with the loyalty conditions that the Russian authorities wanted to impose on him, was ordered to leave the Polish capital and in April 1795 moved once more to Vienna. The Kościuszko Rising led to the Third (and final) Partition of Poland.

1796 saw the death of Catherine II of Russia. Her son, Tsar Paul I returned Poniatowski&#x27;s estates and again tried to hire him into the Russian army. To excuse himself Prince Józef claimed being (as a result of past wounds) in an extremely poor health.

In 1798, however, his uncle, the former king and grand duke Stanislaus Augustus, died in St. Petersburg. Poniatowski left Vienna for his funeral and to arrange for the proper disposition of the late king&#x27;s finances, inheritance and obligations. He stayed in St. Petersburg for several months, and then, being on good terms with Tsar Paul and his court, returned to Poland, into his estates in Warsaw (Copper-Roof and Myślewicki palaces) and in Jabłonna. Warsaw at that time was under Prussian rule.

There until 1806, Poniatowski lived a private life of parties and play, politically not very active, often shocking the public opinion by the conduct of himself and his friends. His household was managed strictly by one , an older woman whom he brought from Vienna and who was apparently able to exert a great deal of influence over the Prince.

His residences were open to various personalities. The future King Louis XVIII, brother of Louis XVI who was executed by the Revolution, who needed a place to stay with his family and court, was Poniatowski&#x27;s guest at the Łazienki Palace for a few years after 1801. In 1802, beset by legal troubles stemming from Stanislaus&#x27; succession, Poniatowski made a trip to Berlin, where he stayed for months and established cordial personal relations with the Prussian royal family.

Prince Józef never married; had two sons with two of his unmarried partners, the first one Józef Szczęsny Poniatowski (1791–1860) with the singer Zelia Sitańska and Karol Józef Maurycy Poniatowski (1809–1855) with married Zofia Czosnowska, by birth Countess Potocka.

==Duchy of Warsaw and victory in the Austro-Polish War==
Following French Emperor Napoleon I&#x27;s victory at the Battle of Jena and the ensuing evacuation by Prussia of her Polish provinces, in November 1806 Poniatowski was asked by the Prussian king Frederick William III to assume the governorship of Warsaw, to which he agreed; he also assumed the command of the city&#x27;s municipal guard and citizen militia forces organized by local residents. All of this turned out to be a short-lived Polish provisional authority, because the quick succession of events on the European scene presented the Poles with new opportunities and forced upon them new choices.

At the end of that year Joachim Murat and his forces entered Warsaw and Poniatowski had to define his role within this new political reality. It took protracted negotiations with Murat (they liked each other and quickly became friends) and persuasion by Józef Wybicki (who urged the Prince to get on board, before the window of historic opportunity closed), but before the year was over Poniatowski was declared by Murat to be &quot;chief of the military force&quot; and was leading the military department on behalf of the French authorities. Dąbrowski, who was the choice of many Polish veterans of the Polish Legions and of the Insurrection, as well as Zajączek were bypassed, even though they both had served under Napoleon when Poniatowski was inactive. On 14 January 1807, by the Emperor&#x27;s decree, the Warsaw Governing Commission was created under Stanisław Małachowski, and within this structure Poniatowski became officially Director of the Department of War and set about organizing the Polish army.

In July 1807 the Duchy of Warsaw was created. In its government Poniatowski on 7 October became Minister of War and Head of Army of the Duchy of Warsaw (&quot;minister wojny i naczelny wódz wojsk Ks. Warszawskiego&quot;), while Napoleon, not yet quite trusting him, left the supreme military command in Davout&#x27;s hands until summer of 1808. Poniatowski officially became Commander in Chief on 21 March 1809. The Minister of War became completely devoted to the creation and development of this new, ostentatiously Polish army. The Duchy&#x27;s army existed and operated under the most difficult circumstances and its success depended largely on the military and political skills of the chief commander. For example, it was severely underfunded and most of the military units were kept by Napoleon outside of the country, to be used in numerous campaigns, which is why Prince Józef had a rather small force at his disposal during the war of 1809.

In spring of 1809 Poniatowski led his army against an Austrian invasion under the Archduke Ferdinand Karl Joseph of Austria-Este, in the war that was regarded by Austrian high command as a crucial element of their struggle with Napoleonic France. At the bloody Battle of Raszyn near Warsaw on 19 April, where he personally led his men in an infantry bayonet charge (throughout his career he did a number of these), Polish forces under Poniatowski&#x27;s command fought to a standstill an Austrian force twice their number. Afterwards however decided not to defend Warsaw and withdrew with his units to the east bank of the Vistula River, to the fortified Praga suburb, which the Austrians attacked, but were defeated at Grochowo on 26 April. An Austrian division then crossed the Vistula again trying to pursue the Poles, but was routed on 2 May at Góra Kalwaria in a daring attack led by General Michał Sokolnicki. Ferdinand made a couple of attempts more, trying to establish a bridgehead on the other side of the Vistula, but those were defeated, which left the initiative in Poniatowski&#x27;s hands. From there he quickly advanced south, staying close to the Vistula to control the situation and taking over large areas of Galicia, that is southern Poland that was controlled by Austria under the partitioning arrangement. On 14 May Lublin was taken, on the 18th fortified and vigorously defended Sandomierz. On the 20th the Zamość fortress was overpowered, where 2000 prisoners and 40 cannons were taken, and even further east Lwów was taken on 27 May. These military developments compelled the Austrians to withdraw from Warsaw — a counteroffensive by their main force resulted in the retaking of Sandomierz on 18 June.
But Poniatowski in the meantime moved west of the Vistula and on 5 July, the day of the Battle of Wagram, began from Radom, his new southbound offensive aimed at Kraków. He arrived there on 15 July, and while the demoralized and not capable of effective defense Austrians tried to turn the city over to the Russians, Poniatowski at this point was not to be outmaneuvered or intimidated: Seeing a Russian hussar cavalry unit in attack formation blocking the street leading to the bridge on the Vistula, he rode his raised up horse into them, so that several flipped as they were falling.

Most of the liberated lands, with the exception of the Lviv region, became incorporated into the Duchy through the peace treaty of 14 October 1809. Prince Józef himself, celebrated by the residents of the old royal capital of Poland, remained in Kraków until the end of December, supervising the provisional Galician government in existence from 2 June to 28 December. The Austrians kept demanding the return of Kraków and he felt that his presence there was the best assurance that the city would remain in Polish hands.

==Napoleon&#x27;s Russian campaign==

In April 1811 Poniatowski went to Paris, where he represented the King of Saxony and Duke of Warsaw Frederick Augustus I at the baptism ceremonies of Napoleon&#x27;s son. He stayed there for four months and worked with the Emperor and his generals on plans for the campaign against Russia. He tried to convince the French leaders that the southern route, through the current day Ukraine would provide the most benefits. Not only was the region warmer, Polish gentry from the Russian partition would join in, and possible Turkish action against Russia could be supported, which was the most advantageous theater for the upcoming war. Napoleon rejected the idea, as well as the back-up scenario, according to which Poniatowski would follow such a route alone with the Polish corps, hoping to take over these formerly Polish areas with the expected help from a Polish uprising planned there. For the Russian Campaign of 1812 Poniatowski became commander of V Corps of the Grande Armée — at nearly 100,000 strong Polish forces in the Grande Armée were the greatest Polish military effort before the 20th century.

The initial period of the offensive, when Poniatowski was placed under the direction of Jérôme Bonaparte, was wasted, but after Napoleon&#x27;s brother left Poniatowski was briefly put in charge of Grande Armée&#x27;s right wing. Fighting on the avant-garde on the advance to Moscow he distinguished himself at a number of battles. On 17 August at Smolensk he personally led his corps&#x27; assault on the city. On 7 September at Borodino the V Corps was involved in the daylong fight over the Utitza Mound, which was finally taken toward the evening, stormed by the entire corps led by Prince Józef again. On 14 September the Polish soldiers were the first ones to enter the Russian capital; by that time however Poniatowski, unlike Napoleon, was convinced that the campaign was doomed. The Polish corps fought then the battles at Chirikovo on 29 September and Vinkovo on 18 October, where Poniatowski saved Murat from a complete defeat by Kutuzov&#x27;s forces.

Rearguarding the retreat of the Grande Armée, Poniatowski was badly injured during the Battle of Vyazma. He continued in active service for a few days, but his condition forced him to give his command to Józef Zajączek. He then continued the westbound trip in a carriage with two wounded aides, the Legion of the Vistula and Michel Claparède. At the Berezina crossing they barely avoided being captured by the Russians but finally, on 12 December, arrived in Warsaw.

==German campaign of 1813 and death at Leipzig==
After the disastrous retreat of Napoleon&#x27;s army, and while recovering from his injuries, Poniatowski quickly undertook the rebuilding of the Polish army in order to replace the forces devastated by the Moscow campaign. When many Polish leaders began to waver in their allegiance to the French Emperor, Poniatowski resisted this change of opinion and remained faithful to Napoleon, even when Tsar Alexander I offered him amnesty and proposed future cooperation. With the new army only partially completed, on 5 February, as the Russian army was about to enter Warsaw, the Polish units moved out, not sure of their immediate purpose. Eventually they reached Kraków, where they stayed for a few weeks getting ready.

On 7 May, as the Russians were getting close again, Prince Józef and his army left Kraków, went through Bohemia, where, as the VIII Corps, they guarded the passes of the Bohemian mountains and defended the left bank of the Elbe River, to Saxony. The total forces with which he joined Napoleon during the armistice numbered 22,000, which included a small, separately operating Dąbrowski&#x27;s division.

The corps fought major successful battles at Löbau on 9 September, and at Zedtlitz on 10 October, where General Pahlen attempted to stop their movement toward Leipzig, but was defeated in a cavalry charge led by Poniatowski. On 12 October he was about to sit down with Murat at the breakfast table, when they were surprised by enemy units. Poniatowski got on his horse, broke through (receiving a superficial wound in the arm) and returned with another timely cavalry charge, saving the situation. As a reward for his services, on 16 October during the Battle of Leipzig, Poniatowski was made a Marshal of the Empire and entrusted with the duty of covering the French Army&#x27;s retreat. He defended Leipzig, losing half his corps in the attempt, finally falling back slowly upon a bridge over the river White Elster, near Leipzig. In the general confusion, the French blew up the bridge before he could reach it. Poniatowski tried to escape across the Elstermühlgraben (at modern Gottschedstrasse 42) but, badly injured and probably shot by his allies by mistake, drowned in the river.

==Legacy==
Poniatowski&#x27;s cult developed after his death, as a Polish version of the Napoleonic legend. His remains were transported to Poland in 1817 and buried in the cathedral on Kraków&#x27;s Wawel Hill, where he lies beside Tadeusz Kościuszko and John III Sobieski.

In 1829 his monument by Bertel Thorvaldsen was erected in Warsaw. It was destroyed during World War II, but a recent copy, the Monument to Prince Józef Poniatowski, is still standing before the presidential palace in Warsaw.
Poniatowski never married and had only illegitimate issues. Among his living relatives is Elena Poniatowska, a Mexican journalist.

He is one of the figures immortalized in Jan Matejko&#x27;s 1891 painting, &quot;Constitution of 3 May 1791&quot;.

He was an inspiration for Polish freedom fighters throughout a number of armed conflicts, but especially during the November Uprising of 1830, since many of its leaders had served under Poniatowski&#x27;s command during the Napoleonic Wars. The Duchy of Warsaw, which Napoleon had created and Poniatowski defended, remained as a residual Polish state to the end of the Partitions period.

A Japanese manga, &quot;Ten no Hate made - Porando hishi&quot;, was written by Riyoko Ikeda in 1991, commemorating the life of Józef Poniatowski.

A Polish bomber squadron, named after Poniatowski, took part in aerial operations during the Second World War. It was 304 Sqn. RAF &quot;Land of Silesia&quot; Polish Bomber Squadron (Ziemi Śląskiej im. Ks. Józefa Poniatowskiego) which mainly flew Fairey Battle, Vickers Wellington, Vickers Warwick and Handley Page Halifax bombers. Their base airfield was mostly RAF Chivenor in Devon.

<text>Mokhotlong is a constituency, city and seat of Mokhotlong District in the mountainous northeastern part of Lesotho. It is the first major city with an airport along the road from South Africa across the Sani Pass, near the Maloti (Drakensberg in South Africa) Mountains. The name of the city is named in Sesotho, the language of the people of Lesotho, meaning &quot;Place of the Bald Ibis.&quot; Thabana Ntlenyana, the highest point in southern Africa, is found in Mokhotlong.

== History ==
Mokhotlong&#x27;s role as a police post first brought people to this part of Lesotho in 1905. It developed into a trading center for the people of the Highlands region. However, it was preserved from major development by its separation from the rest of the country. Not until 1947 was radio contact established with Maseru, the capital city.

In the next few years an air strip was built and a road cleared through town to link Mokhotlong to the rest of Lesotho. Even so, Mokhotlong continued to be outfitted with provisions and supplies by pony trek from Natal, South Africa, via Sani Pass.

== Geography and climate==
An hour and a half drive north of Sani Pass, Mokhotlong is located 270 km from Maseru and 200 km from 
Butha-Buthe. The source of the Senqu River, Lesotho&#x27;s largest river, is near Mokhotlong, impacting the landscape throughout the town and surrounding district.

Mokhotlong experiences a subtropical highland climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Cwb&quot;) with warm summers and cool, dry winters.

== Events and activities ==
The mountain range is host to activities including hiking trails, horse trails, rock climbing, white water rafting, fly and trout fishing, golfing, bird and game watching, safaris, and much more.

In addition to regular activities, Mokhotlong hosts the annual High Altitude Summer Marathon at the end of the year. The route runs through the Maloti Mountains and is characterized by its views of surrounding mountains and villages. The route has many steep ascents and descents. There are also half marathon and 10k events, in addition to the full marathon.

Mokhotlong is also on the route of the annual Roof of Africa Rally, an off-road motorcycle rally. Finally, Mokhotlong is home to the highest-elevated diamond mine in the world, Letseng diamond mine, which can be toured, and is often frequented by local students as part of their course of study. Its diamonds have the highest per carat price of any kimberlite mine, and with the capacity to process more than 5 million tonnes a year and recover about 100,000 carats, it is the seventh largest in the world. Three of their diamonds are among the world&#x27;s top twenty rough diamonds.

== Socio-economy ==

Mokhotlong&#x27;s economy is primarily driven by livestock rearing and subsistence agriculture, though neither of these fully supports most families. Arable land in this mountainous region is a scarce resource. Agricultural production only sustains families from three to nine months of the year. Families cover the gap largely through livestock and remittances from employed family members. However, livestock distribution is skewed with 60% of the livestock owned by 10% of the population; approximately 35% of the community have no livestock. General income is small, given both poor educational opportunities and the high unemployment rate in Lesotho and in South Africa (especially this part of South Africa). Consequently, a large segment of the population is seriously poor. This is exacerbated by HIV/AIDS, which ravages the region. Despite its poverty, few aid organizations work in Mokhotlong. Touching Tiny Lives provides nutritional and medical support to vulnerable children. GROW works with villages to increase agricultural production, support OVC households to improve livelihoods, capacity building, climate change adaptation strategies, etc.

In Mokhotlong City, the Mokhotlong district capital, formal employment is boosted by the presence of government offices.

(&quot;Letloepe&quot; means the cobra&#x27;s defensive hood, and is the alternative name for Qacha&#x27;s Nek). The locality may be the only place in Africa where California Redwood trees grow (the area is visible on the photo, to the right-hand side of the wooded Letloepe hill).

As one enters the town from Maseru (1 km from the road in the picture), one can see the famous lefika-motho (&quot;man-rock&quot;), which looks like a man&#x27;s head with a cap on. There are several spots where San paintings can still be found. The Sehlabathebe National Park, home of the Sehlabathebe water lily, is about 2.5 hours away by gravel road.

==Demography==
The people of Qacha&#x27;s Nek are called &quot;Melele&quot; (Wanderers), and the colours of the place / district are maroon and white. Other than Sesotho and English, people speak Xhosa and Sephuthi.

==Climate==
The town has 900 mm precipitation per year, the highest annual rainfall of any Lesotho district capitals. From the nearby Indian Ocean clouds move up almost daily, so that in Qacha&#x27;s Nek fog often prevails. In the summer, the average temperature is 17 °C. Because of its climate, Qacha&#x27;s Nek is green longer than most other places in Lesotho every year, and is very refreshing. There is an increasing population of fauna like snails, and the place has always had several species of rare flora.

<text>The University of Michigan–Flint (UM-Flint) is a public university in Flint, Michigan, United States. Founded in 1956 as the Flint Senior College, it was initially established as a remote branch of the University of Michigan, offering upper-division undergraduate courses. The institution developed into a fully-fledged university and received accreditation in 1970. Subsequently, the name was changed to the University of Michigan–Flint. It continues to adhere to the policies of the University of Michigan Board of Regents without having a separate governing board.

UM-Flint is one of the five doctoral/professional universities in the state of Michigan. Together with Oakland University, the University of Michigan–Dearborn, and Wayne State University, UM-Flint is one of the four Coalition of Urban and Metropolitan Universities (CUMU) members in the State of Michigan.

The university&#x27;s student-athletes compete in intramural and club sports as the Michigan-Flint Wolverines. Notable alumni include former Best Buy executive Shari Ballard, former United States Senator Donald Riegle, and Oscar-winning film director Michael Moore, who was an editor for the student newspaper &quot;The Michigan Times&quot;.

==History==

===Flint Senior College (1956–1964)===

Former Flint mayor C.S. Mott first suggested bringing a full university to Flint in a meeting with then-President Alexander Ruthven in 1946. Mott pledged to give $1 million to the project if the voters would pass a $7 million bond issue. The University of Michigan initially opposed Mott&#x27;s idea but, ultimately, agreed to create the Flint Senior College of the University of Michigan as an extension of the existing Flint Junior College (now Mott Community College), while the colleges remained separate institutions.

Although it was founded in 1956, three years before the establishment of the Dearborn Center (now University of Michigan–Dearborn), the Flint Senior College was not the first branch of the University of Michigan ever established. The University of Michigan, established in 1817, historically held central authority and was granted the power to establish schools, colleges, and branches throughout the Territory of Michigan. The initial branch was established in Pontiac in the 1830s, and additional branches were subsequently opened in Kalamazoo, Detroit, Niles, Tecumseh, White Pigeon, and Romeo. The University of Michigan anticipated that these branches would eventually transition into independent colleges and universities once they had matured enough to operate as standalone entities.

For a number of years, the college shared the Court Street campus with Flint Junior College. This campus was part of the Flint Cultural Center with major donations from many Flint business leaders. Original donors included the Sponsors Fund of Flint and William Ballenger. The first building constructed in 1954 was The Ballenger Field House.

In February 1956, David M. French was named the first dean of the Flint Senior College. The college began classes in 1956 with 118 full-time and 49 part-time students. Degrees were offered in liberal arts and sciences and in the professional fields of education and business administration. The college&#x27;s first class graduated in 1958.

=== Flint College (1964–1971)===

The college became a four-year institution in 1964 and added its first freshman class the following year. The name was changed to Flint College of the University of Michigan.

===University of Michigan–Flint (1971–)===

In 1970, Flint College received its own accreditation independent from the main campus in Ann Arbor, from the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools. In 1971, the Regents officially changed the name of the institution to the University of Michigan-Flint. The Regents later named William E. Moran as the first chancellor of the university. Two schools were formed at Flint in 1975, the College of Arts and Sciences, the School of Management.

The community and city assisted UM–Flint in acquiring 42 acres along the Flint River. $5 million over five years was pledged towards a new campus in 1972 by the C.S. Mott Foundation. During September 1972, sixteen temporary buildings were erected to ease campus overcrowding, pressuring the Regents to move UM-Flint to its current location along the Flint River.

On September 1, 1973, the Regents passed the plans for the first building by Sedgewick-Sellers &amp; Associates, originally planned for a site at Lapeer Road and Court Street. Instead, the first building was moved to a site on the Flint River, the current campus location. The university acquired the Ross House and the Hubbard Building. Its ground breaking ceremony was held on May 9, 1974, at the Willson Park bandstand. In 1977, construction ended on the Class Room Office Building (CROB), later named David M. French Hall, and the Central Energy Plant. CROB included a library and theatre. In 1979, the original Harrison Street Halo Burger location was vacated to make way for UM-Flint parking. While, the Harding Mott University Center (UCen) was finished that same year and the Recreation Center in 1982.

William S. Murchie Science Building was completed in 1988. In 1991, UM-Flint took over ownership of the Water Street Pavilion as the University Pavilion keeping restaurants there while moving in administrative offices. The library moved to its own building in 1994 with the completion of the Frances Willson Thompson Library. The site across the river on the north side was acquired in 1997. Northbank Center was acquired in 1998.

In 1989, the School of Health Professions and Studies was formed and later renamed the College of Health Sciences in 2018. The School of Education and Human Services was formed in 1997.

==== Juan E. Mestas (1999 until 2007) ====

In September 1999, Juan E. Mestas began his tenure as the fifth chancellor of UM-Flint. The William S. White Building was completed on the north side of the Flint River in 2002 for School of Health Professions and Studies and the School of Management. Halo Burger returned to the campus in September 2002 only to be forced out due to on-campus housing food regulations in 2008.

==== Ruth Person (2008 until 2014) ====

Ruth Person became chancellor in 2008. The first on-campus dorms, First Street Residence Hall, were completed in 2008. UM-Flint in 2010 was the fastest-growing public university in the state of Michigan. The School of Management moved to a leased floor of the Riverfront Residence Hall in early 2013 from the White Building at renovation cost of $5.3 million. In 2013, Person&#x27;s five-year term was up and was extended for a year to 2014.

==== Susan E. Borrego (2014 until 2019) ====

In August 2014, Susan E. Borrego began as chancellor. On October 15, 2015, University Board of Regents approved the purchase of the 160,000-square-foot, 10-story north tower building of the Citizens Banking Buildings from FirstMerit Bank for $6 million expected to close in March 2016. In mid-December 2015, the Uptown Reinvestment Corporation donated the Riverfront Residence Hall and Banquet Center to the university with the Charles Stewart Mott Foundation forgiving the remaining redevelopment loan for the center. On October 20, 2016, the Regents formed the School of Nursing from the Department of Nursing in the School of Health Professions and Studies. The Harrison Street Annex, at Kearsley and Harrison Streets in the Harrison Street parking structure, has been remodeled to be the university&#x27;s engineering design studio.

==== Debasish Dutta (2019 until 2023) ====

In 2019, Susan E. Borrego resigned as chancellor after 5 years, and was succeeded by Debasish Dutta in July. Dutta was formally installed as the university&#x27;s ninth chancellor in August 2019.

== Organization ==
=== Administration ===
UM–Flint, historically a branch of the University of Michigan, has operated under the policies of the Board of Regents of the University of Michigan since its accreditation in 1970. The Board of Regents, as the governing body, is responsible for the appointment of the university president, who presides over the Board&#x27;s meetings but does not have voting rights. Instead of directly managing the university&#x27;s operations, the university president recommends the appointment of a chancellor, who is subject to approval by the Board of Regents and is tasked with overseeing the day-to-day administrative duties of the university as its chief executive officer.

===Student newspaper===
&quot;The Michigan Times&quot; was a student-run campus newspaper at University of Michigan–Flint. It was founded in 1959 and casually referred to on and around campus as &quot;The M-Times.&quot; Notable alumni staff members include filmmaker Michael Moore and American Idol finalist LaKisha Jones. The newspaper was printed weekly and available free-of-cost on campus, at other area colleges, in the surrounding downtown area and elsewhere in the Greater Flint area. In March 2024, the &quot;Flint Expatriates&quot; blog reported &quot;The Michigan Times&quot; was &quot;sunsetting&quot; and will cease operations. It lost funding from student activity fees at the end of the 2023-2024 academic year due to lack of student interest. If students want to relaunch the publication in the future, it will have to be a volunteer-only organization responsible for its own fundraising.

===Student government===
The University of Michigan–Flint Student Government represents the students and manages student funds on the campus. Student Government is a member of the statewide Association of Michigan Universities.

==Athletics==

The university&#x27;s athletic teams have competed as Wolverines, while an unofficial student vote in 2009 selected The Victors to avoid confusion with the Michigan Wolverines. The teams share the nickname &quot;Wolverines&quot; with several other collegiate athletic teams, such as the Michigan Wolverines, the Michigan–Dearborn Wolverines, the Utah Valley Wolverines, the Morris Brown Wolverines, and the Grove City Wolverines.

While the university does not offer any varsity intercollegiate athletics, there are a number of club sport teams and intramural sports leagues available to students. Current Club Sports include:

*Men&#x27;s &amp; Women&#x27;s Basketball
*Cheer
*Men&#x27;s Ice Hockey
*Men&#x27;s &amp; Women&#x27;s Soccer
*Women&#x27;s Volleyball
*Softball

In 2013, the men&#x27;s ice hockey team earned a spot in the ACHA Division III National Tournament for the first time, eventually advancing to the National Championship Game against fellow Michigan Collegiate Hockey Conference foe Adrian Bulldogs. In 2015, the women&#x27;s hockey team went 18–0 in conference play.

Football was previously offered as a club sport, before financial shortfalls led to the discontinuation of the NCFA club in 2015.

<doc id="450829" wikidata="Q2914585" url="?curid=450829" title="The Wrekin">
<text>The Wrekin ( ) is a hill in east Shropshire, England. It is located some west of Telford, on the border between the unitary authorities of Shropshire and Telford and Wrekin. Rising above the Shropshire Plain to a height of above sea level, it is a prominent and well-known landmark, signalling the entrance to Shropshire for travellers westbound on the M54 motorway. The Wrekin is contained within the northern salient of the Shropshire Hills AONB. The hill is popular with walkers and tourists and offers good views of Shropshire. It can be seen well into Staffordshire and the Black Country, and even as far as the Beetham Tower in Manchester, Winter Hill in Lancashire and Cleeve Hill in Gloucestershire.

==Name==
The earliest mention of &quot;the Wrekin&quot; occurs in a charter of 855, as entered in a late 11th century Worcester cartulary, spelled &quot;Wreocensetun&quot;. Its modern form is believed to have come into modern English by way of Mercian, and that is likely to have been taken from the British Celtic &quot;Wrikon-&quot;. &quot;Dinlle Wrecon&quot; meaning the fort of Wrecon appears as a place name in the early Welsh poems known as Canu Heledd.

==Summit==

There is an Iron Age hill fort on the summit almost in size, to which the name &quot;Uriconio&quot; originally referred. It is thought the fort was built by the Cornovii tribe and was once their capital. In AD47 Roman invaders stormed the fort and set fire to it, moving the defeated tribe on to Wroxeter (Viroconium Cornoviorum).

A more recent addition is the Wrekin transmitting station, used for broadcasting and telecommunications. At the top of the main mast is a beacon which emits a red pulse of light every few seconds at night. A beacon was originally erected on the Wrekin during the Second World War to warn aircraft, and was kept in operation until 1960. A new beacon was then installed in 2000, as part of a project to celebrate the new millennium. It is known locally as the &quot;Wrekin Beacon&quot;, and is visible for many miles around.

The trig point and toposcope at the height of the summit was incorporated into an artwork, &quot;The Sky Begins at My Feet&quot;, which was designed by Wellington Arts Collective and unveiled in October 2022 in honour of the Platinum Jubilee of Elizabeth II. The sculpture is in the stoneware clay tiles laid around the plinths bearing relief portraits of seven local heroes and heroines by artist Sharon Griffin, and a range of decorative tiles designed by the public and various community groups and workshops.

==Geology==
The geology of the Wrekin and its immediate area is complex, consisting of a variety of rocks of a range of ages affected by numerous faults. The crest of the Wrekin&#x27;s ridge and its northwestern slopes are formed from various rocks of volcanic origin assigned to the Uriconian series, of Precambrian age. The &#x27;Uriconian Volcanics&#x27; include rhyolites, tuffs and agglomerates. These rocks – layers of ancient lava flows laid down in a volcanic island arc, similar to modern Japan – are approximately 680million years old.

Dolerite dykes intruded the extrusive volcanic rocks around 563million years ago. A variety of the intrusive igneous rock granophyre, known as Ercallite forms the northeastern shoulder of the Ercall. It was put in place around 560million years ago and is overlain by Cambrian rocks of sedimentary origin. The southeastern side of the ridge is largely formed from sandstones and shales of Cambrian age. They include the early Cambrian Lower Comley Sandstone and Lower Comley Limestones together with the Wrekin Quartzite, outcrops of which also occur to the northwest of the ridge.

The lower ground to the northwest comprises sandstones and mudstones of late Carboniferous and Permian age whilst to the southeast are a succession of rocks of early Carboniferous age including limestone, the Little Wenlock Basalt and the Lydebrook Sandstone.

Structurally, the Wrekin together with the Ercall forms part of the Church Stretton Complex where different geological terranes meet. The Cymru terrane is to the west with the Wrekin terrane to the east of the fault system. The fault system trends north-northeast:south-southwest and the line carries on through other geologically important exposures such as those in the area of Caer Caradoc.

Contrary to a common misconception, the Wrekin has never been a volcano in its own right, but is composed mainly of volcanic rocks and is a product of volcanism. Its modern shape, which from certain viewpoints appears to resemble a volcano, has been formed by other natural processes.

==Wider area==
The name &quot;the Wrekin&quot; is also used to refer more generally to the part of East Shropshire around the towns of Telford and Wellington, within sight of the hill. The surrounding area is one of the birthplaces of industry: Ironbridge Gorge is just to the south of the Wrekin hill. Woodland covers much of the hill, the area around the hill and into the Ironbridge Gorge area too. The eponymous Wrekin parliamentary constituency incorporates the hill.

==Access==
The Wrekin can be accessed from the final junction on the M54 motorway (J7) before it turns into the A5 which continues to Shrewsbury. The hill is then signposted. There is a well-used footpath up the side of the hill which has an entrance at the end of the road off the M54. There is also a small car park and parking bays up the road. Between the Ercall and the Wrekin is a well positioned car park, at Forest Glen, allowing easy access to both areas. The ascent is steep in parts. The Wrekin is owned by the Raby Estate, currently headed by Henry Francis Cecil Vane.

==Folklore and local custom==

The Wrekin is the subject of a well-known legend in Shropshire folklore. One version of the story runs as follows:

A giant called Gwendol Wrekin ap Shenkin ap Mynyddmawr with a grudge against the town of Shrewsbury decided to flood the town and kill all its inhabitants. So he collected a giant-sized spadeful of earth and set off towards the town. When in the vicinity of Wellington he met a cobbler returning from Shrewsbury market with a large sackful of shoes for repair. The giant asked him for directions, adding that he was going to dump his spadeful of earth in the River Severn and flood the town. &quot;It&#x27;s a very long way to Shrewsbury,&quot; replied the quick-thinking shoemaker. &quot;Look at all these shoes I&#x27;ve worn out walking back from there!&quot; The giant immediately decided to abandon his enterprise and dumped the earth on the ground beside him, where it became the Wrekin. The giant also scraped the mud off his boots, which became the smaller hill Ercall Hill nearby. Ironically Shrewsbury is subjected to flooding from the River Severn on frequent occasions naturally.&quot;All around the Wrekin&quot;, &quot;Right &#x27;round the Wrekin&quot; or &quot;Running round the Wrekin&quot; is a phrase common in Shropshire, Worcestershire, Staffordshire, Herefordshire, the Black Country, Birmingham to mean &quot;the long way round&quot;, in the same way that &quot;round the houses&quot; is used more widely. &quot;To all friends around the Wrekin&quot;, meanwhile, is a toast traditionally used in Shropshire, especially at Christmas and New Year.

The amount of inclement weather in the area can also be said to be predicted by the visibility of the Wrekin. The saying being, &quot;If you can see the Wrekin, it&#x27;s going to rain. And if you can&#x27;t see the Wrekin, it&#x27;s already raining.&quot;

Another well known local legend has it that you cannot be a true Salopian (person born in Shropshire) unless you have passed through the Needle&#x27;s Eye – a split between two large rocks close to the summit.

In 1981, an event was undertaken by local school pupils and adults called &quot;Hands around the Wrekin&quot;, whereby a large group of people all held hands, surrounding the hill at the base.

The Wrekin has a cheese named after it called Wrekin White, which is produced and sold in a dairy in Newport, Shropshire.

In September 2010, Wiccans conducted a wicker man burning ceremony at the Wrekin to celebrate the autumnal equinox.
==In popular culture==
The Wrekin is mentioned in Poem XXXI of A.E. Housman&#x27;s collection &quot;A Shropshire Lad&quot;. The first stanza runs:
&lt;poem&gt;:&quot;On Wenlock Edge the wood&#x27;s in trouble;&quot;
:&quot;His forest fleece the Wrekin heaves;&quot;
:&quot;The gale, it plies the saplings double,&quot;
:&quot;And thick on Severn snow the leaves.&quot;&lt;/poem&gt;

In the 1969 novel &quot;A Pelican at Blandings&quot;, The Wrekin can be seen from P.G. Wodehouse&#x27;s Blandings Castle.

The Wrekin is also mentioned in Half Man Half Biscuit&#x27;s 1987 song, &quot;Rod Hull Is Alive, Why?&quot;, with the line: &quot;Halfway up the Wrekin with an empty flask of tea, a fog descends and takes away my visibility...&quot; In Edward Lear&#x27;s &quot;A Book of Nonsense&quot;, one of the limericks starts:
&lt;poem&gt;:&quot;There was an Old Man of the Wrekin&quot;
:&quot;Whose shoes made a horrible creaking&quot;&lt;/poem&gt;

In 2017, during an attempt by the high-street chain Poundland to challenge the trademark of Mondelēz&#x27;s Toblerone bar with their own Twin Peaks confectionery, they claimed that the latter was inspired by the shape of the Wrekin, which is situated in the region of Poundland&#x27;s head office in Willenhall. The chocolate bar was launched that year, and is said to be based on the Wrekin and Ercall hills. Poundland&#x27;s founder, Steve Smith, lives near Bridgnorth in Shropshire.

The Wrekin is a location in the 2020 videogame &quot;Assassin&#x27;s Creed Valhalla&quot;, as &quot;The Wroeken&quot;.

Christian Bale (playing racing driver Ken Miles, from Sutton Coldfield) uses the phrase &quot;It’s just a quick ride round The Wrekin&quot; in 2019 film &quot;Le Mans &#x27;66&quot;.

==Views==

The most distant visible point is probably the Forest of Bowland in north-east Lancashire. Despite historical claims, including a toposcope at the summit, it is not possible to see Snowdon from the Wrekin, as the line of sight is blocked by Cadair Berwyn.

<text>Quthing, also known as Moyeni (Sesotho for &quot;place of wind&quot;), is a constituency and the capital city or camptown of Quthing District in Lesotho. Quthing was established in 1877, abandoned in the Gun War of 1880, and then rebuilt at its present site – the southernmost town in Lesotho. It has a population of 27,314 (2016 census).

Moyeni is divided into Lower Moyeni and Upper Moyeni. Lower Moyeni is largely used for commercial and residential purposes. Upper Moyeni is mainly for administrative purposes and residences for government officials.

Quthing district is home to a diverse group of people who speak different languages. King Moorosi, the leader of the Baphuthi people, who occupied the Quthing District in southeastern Basutoland (today&#x27;s Lesotho) in the 1800s, died on Mount Moorosi in 1879 in a war against the Cape Colony.

Rock and cave art are to be found near Quthing, which were created by the San people who settled in this area. Quthing lies in the southern part of Lesotho and borders the Eastern Cape province of South Africa. The Senqu River flows through the district of Quthing as it makes its long journey to the Atlantic Ocean. The border post between Lesotho and South Africa is called Tele Bridge.

During King Moshoeshoe&#x27;s reign he allocated this part of the country mostly to the Baphuthi people led by King Moorosi.

<doc id="450836" wikidata="Q3997438" url="?curid=450836" title="Loudoun">
<text>Loudoun () is a parish in East Ayrshire, Scotland and lies between five and ten miles east of Kilmarnock. The parish roughly encompasses the northern half of the Upper-Irvine Valley and borders Galston Parish (which encompasses the remainder of The Valley) at the River Irvine.

Loudoun is a parish, which shares borders with six other parishes. To the south lies the parish of Galston, which of all the surrounding parishes, has the strongest local links to Loudoun, being as the two parishes share strong historical and social links, as well as sharing public services. Otherwise, Loudoun shares borders with the parishes of Avondale (east), Eaglesham (north), East Kilbride (north-east), Fenwick (north-west) and Kilmarnock (west).

Within Loudoun can be found the towns of Darvel and Newmilns, alongside Loudoun Hill, Loudoun Castle, Loudoun Kirk and Loudoun Academy. Notably, claims that Greenholm, Priestland and the town of Galston itself lie within Loudoun are erroneous, as all three lie south of the River Irvine, in the parish of Galston. This may in some part be because Loudoun Academy and surrounding housing hold Galston postcodes.

Loudoun also contained two villages abandoned during the last century, &quot;Alton&quot; and &quot;Loudoun Village&quot;.

==Etymology==
Various theories have been put forward as to the origins of the name &quot;Loudoun&quot;. One such theory is that the name was originally used in reference to Loudoun Hill, being a combination of two Scots words &quot;law&quot; and &quot;dun&quot;, which roughly translates as &quot;Firehill&quot;. Another Loudoun Hill theory is that the name was originally &quot;Lugudunon&quot;, which roughly translates as &quot;The Fortress of Lugh&quot;. It has also been speculated that the name simply derives from the Celtic word, &quot;Loddan&quot;, which means &quot;marshy ground&quot;.

==History==
Whilst the origins of Loudoun&#x27;s name are up for debate, it is known that by 1186 the name was used to describe the surrounding area, as in this year a Royal Charter granted the &quot;Lands of Lowdun&quot; to James de Lambinus. At this time the family name was changed to &quot;de Lowdun&quot;, with the Loudoun family building Loudoun Castle, Loudoun Kirk and The Keep (in Newmilns) over the forthcoming centuries.

Subsequently, the Loudoun family married in to the Crawford family and in doing so, inherited the hereditary title, Sheriff of Ayr. It has been put forward that William Wallace was a relative of the Loudouns, through his mother Margaret Crawford (sister of the 5th Baron, Reginald Crawford), although this claim has been disputed.

According to Blind Harry, Wallace is also said to have fought a battle at Loudoun Hill, during the Scottish Wars of Independence. This claim is largely disputed by historians, with the real Battle of Loudoun Hill being fought between the Scottish forces of Robert Bruce and the English forces of Aymer de Valence on 10 May 1307. Bruce&#x27;s forces prevailed and whilst the combined forces of both armies probably totalled no more than about 4,000 men, the result is seen as an important step towards Bruce&#x27;s eventual victory in the Wars of Independence.

<text>Tiverton ( ) is a town and civil parish in Devon, England, and the commercial and administrative centre of the Mid Devon district. The population in 2019 was 20,587.

==History==
===Early history===

The town&#x27;s name is conjectured to derive from &quot;Twy-ford-ton&quot; or &quot;Twyverton&quot;, meaning &quot;the town on two fords&quot;, and was historically referred to as &quot;Twyford&quot;. The town stands at the confluence of the rivers Exe and Lowman. Human occupation in the area dates back to the Stone Age, with many flint tools found in the area. An Iron Age hill fort, Cranmore Castle, stands at the top of Exeter Hill above the town, and a Roman fort or marching camp was discovered on the hillside below Knightshayes Court near Bolham, just to the north of the town.

Tiverton formed part of the inheritance of Aethelweard, youngest son of King Alfred. Countess Gytha of Wessex controlled the town in 1066 and the Domesday Book indicates that William the Conqueror was its tenant-in-chief in 1086. Tiverton was also the seat of the court of the hundred of Tiverton. It was the strategic site chosen by Henry I for a Norman castle, Tiverton Castle, first built as a Motte and Bailey in 1106.

Tiverton has a medieval town leat, built for it by Countess Isabella de Fortibus, who was the eldest daughter of Baldwin de Redvers, 6th Earl of Devon and grew up at Tidcombe Hall, close to Tiverton. Isabella also controlled the Port of Topsham, Devon, through which much of Tiverton&#x27;s woollen exports were transported, mostly to the Low Countries. Every seven years there is a Perambulation of the Town Leat: a ceremony to clear the path of the leat and ensure it is kept running. The leat can be seen in Castle Street, where it runs down the centre of the road, and at Coggan&#x27;s Well, in Fore Street.

Tiverton owes its early growth and prosperity to the wool trade, which caused the town to grow rapidly in the 16th and 17th centuries. Many wealthy wool merchants added to the town&#x27;s heritage. John Greenway (1460–1529), for example, built a chapel and porch onto St Peter&#x27;s parish church in 1517, and a small chapel and almshouses in Gold Street, which still stand – the Almshouse Trust still houses people today. Peter Blundell, another wealthy merchant, who died in 1601, bequeathed the funds and land for Blundell&#x27;s School to educate local children. It was founded in Tiverton in 1604 and relocated to its present location on the outskirts of town in 1882, where it functions as an independent school. John Waldron (died 1579) founded &quot;Waldron&#x27;s Almshouses&quot;, on Wellbrook Street, and his elaborate chest tomb survives in St Peter&#x27;s Church.

Around the turn of the 17th century, there were two major fires in the town. The first, allegedly started in a frying pan, was in 1596 and destroyed most of the town. The second, in 1612, was known as the &quot;dog-fight fire&quot; – a dog fight had distracted those meant to be looking after a furnace. The parish registers of Barnstaple reported of the second fire: &quot;In the yere of or Lorde God 1612 in the 5th daye of the month of Auguste was the towne of Teverton burned the second tyme wth fyer to the nomber of 260 dwellynge howses.&quot;
During the English Civil War in 1645 Tiverton Castle, held by the Royalists, was the scene of a relatively brief siege by Thomas Fairfax&#x27;s Parliamentarian forces. The Parliamentarian forces entered Tiverton under Major General Massey on 15 October, the town&#x27;s defenders fleeing before him towards Exeter. They left a defending force in the castle and church. Fairfax arrived from Cullompton on 17 October, set up his artillery and bombarded the castle for two days, ceasing fire for the sabbath in the afternoon of Saturday 18 October. On Sunday Fairfax had &quot;several great pieces&quot; of artillery brought up, ready for a renewed barrage on Monday, which commenced at 7 a.m. The siege was ended when a lucky shot broke one of the drawbridge chains and an alert squad of Roundheads gained swift entry.

===18th and 19th centuries===
The town enjoyed prosperity from the wool trade in the early 18th century. However, a period of decline followed during the early Industrial Revolution. There were occasional riots, and societies of woolcombers and weavers were formed in an effort to protect jobs and wages. By the end of the century, imports of cotton and the expansion of industrialization elsewhere, along with the effect of the Napoleonic Wars on exports, took the town&#x27;s woollen industry into terminal decline. In June 1731 another fire destroyed 298 houses, causing £58,000 worth of damage. After this, the streets were widened. In May 1738, riots broke out in the town.

The industrialist John Heathcoat bought an old woollen mill on the river Exe in 1815, and after the destruction of his machinery at Loughborough by former Luddites thought to be in the pay of Nottingham lacemakers, he moved his whole lace-making operation to Tiverton. The factory turned the fortunes of Tiverton again, making it an early industrial centre in the South West. Trade was aided when a branch of the Grand Western Canal from Tiverton to Lowdwells was opened in 1814, with an extension to Taunton in 1838. This was followed by a branch of the Great Western Railway in 1848. Tiverton Town Hall, elaborately designed by Henry Lloyd, was completed in 1864.

Although small, Tiverton had two members of Parliament. As one of the &quot;rotten boroughs&quot; it was often targeted by those seeking electoral reform. Lord Palmerston, or &quot;Pam&quot; as he was known locally, was an MP for Tiverton for much of the 19th century. In 1847, the Chartists, a radical group seeking to change the electoral system, stood one of their leaders, George Julian Harney, against Palmerston. He is widely reported as having gained no votes – but in fact he won the &quot;popular vote&quot; (a show of hands of the people of the town) and withdrew when Palmerston called a ballot, aware that he would lose in a vote by only 400 wealthy and propertied in the town out of a population of 7000. Broadening the franchise was one of the Chartist objectives. After the Reform Act of 1867, Tiverton had a single MP, held for a long period by a member of the Heathcoat-Amory family, who own much of the land and property surrounding Tiverton, most recently by Derick Heathcoat-Amory who served from 1945 to 1960. Up until 2010 David Heathcoat-Amory was the MP for Wells in nearby Somerset.

The town was the last in the Devon and Cornwall area to retain an independent police force, until 1945. In the second half of the 20th century, Tiverton again declined slowly, as the Heathcoat factory became ever more mechanised and the Starkey Knight &amp; Ford brewery was taken over by Whitbread as its regional brewery, but later closed, becoming just a bottling plant located in Howden (now Aston Manor cider makers). The factory lay derelict for some years before being demolished to make way for a supermarket. The manufacture of agricultural machinery adjacent to the River Lowman dwindled, the railway closed in 1964 and the Globe Elastic plant in Kennedy Way closed in the 1980s. However, a few far-sighted individuals, notably William Authers, secured some important assets for the future. Tiverton Museum was opened, the track bed of the old railway was bought to provide footpaths and an adventure playground, and the Grand Western Canal was saved from dereliction as a country park.

Retailing in the town declined further in the 1990s after the opening of the Southern Relief Road (now Great Western Way) led to the closure of Fore Street in the town centre to all but pedestrians.

===20th and 21st centuries===

Tiverton&#x27;s revival in recent years began with the construction of the A361 (the North Devon Link Road) in the late 1980s. In the 1990s, an industrial estate was built at Little Gornhay on the north-eastern edge of the town and a junction was added to the Link Road, with a distributor road (now the A396) into the town that has become its main gateway. Great Western Way, linking this road to the Exeter Road along the line of the old railway, was also constructed.

Demand has driven up housing prices, particularly in the South-West. Many now look to towns on the periphery of employment centres. Tiverton has become a dormitory town for commuters to Exeter and Taunton, with its growth supported by large housing projects to the north of the town by most national house builders, including Westbury Homes, Barrett Homes and Bellway Homes. The resulting influx has brought further development of the town&#x27;s services and shops. Tiverton&#x27;s outmoded swimming pool was replaced by a new leisure centre near the main campus of the East Devon College consisting of a swimming pool and gymnasium. Mid Devon District Council moved in December 2003 to new offices at Phoenix House, at the foot of Phoenix Lane, close to the site of a disused brewery. The town has a newly built Tiverton and District Hospital funded by the Private Finance Initiative, which opened in May 2004.
The Pannier Market in the town was redeveloped at a cost of over £3 million, alongside its car park and minor shopping precinct, increasing market capacity and allowing markets to be held more frequently: the work was completed in April 2006.

In 2007 the former cinema, the Electric, was bulldozed for redevelopment as housing, while the only operative cinema, the Tivoli, which had been mostly run by volunteers, closed its doors and the site was put up for sale. After a well-supported public campaign, the Tivoli reopened on 28 June 2008, bought by Merlin Cinemas.

Tiverton as the venue for the annual Mid Devon Show won one of 15 positions in the Round 2 pilot scheme as a Portas Town in 2018.

==Transport==
===Road===
Tiverton has easy access to the M5 motorway. The town&#x27;s revival in recent years began with the construction of the A361 North Devon Link Road in the late 1980s.

===Coach===
National Express operates coach services in and out of Tiverton bus station towards London and North Devon.

Up till 11 January 2023, Tiverton was served twice daily by the London Superfast Service of Berry&#x27;s Coaches.

===Rail===
The Bristol and Exeter Railway opened a station known as Tiverton Road on 1 May 1844. It was renamed Tiverton Junction on 12 June 1848, when Tiverton railway station was opened nearer the town at the end of a branch from the Junction station. A second branch, the Exe Valley line reached this station from the south, branching off the London to Penzance main line at Stoke Canon and following the River Exe. Mainline trains were occasionally diverted via Tiverton if there was engineering work or damage on the section north of Stoke Canon. Another line headed north to join the Taunton–Barnstaple line at Dulverton. None of these lines remain.

In 1986, Tiverton Parkway railway station opened on the main line on the site of the old Sampford Peverell station, to replace the junction station a few miles down the line at Willand. As a parkway station, it stands six miles east of the town, alongside Junction 27 of the M5 motorway. Its proximity to the motorway – and the relative inaccessibility of Exeter St Davids railway station – means that the station is often used as a coach exchange when the line between Exeter and Plymouth is closed.

===Canal===
The Grand Western Canal from Taunton to Tiverton opened in 1838.

===Bus===
Most bus services are run by Stagecoach South West. Stagecoach offers a half-hourly, Monday to Saturday services to Exeter via the A396, with a two-hourly service on Sundays and Bank Holidays; and an hourly service to Exeter via Cullompton on Mondays to Saturdays. Stagecoach also runs a two-hourly service to South Molton, with connecting bus services to Barnstaple.

Other than Stagecoach, First Buses of Somerset operates a two-hourly service to Taunton and Dartline Coaches operates a two-hourly service to Dulverton.

==Sport==
The town has a main football club, Tiverton Town, and many amateur clubs, including Elmore and Amory Green Rovers. The town also has a rugby club and several cricket clubs. Tiverton White Eagles is a local women&#x27;s hockey club with three teams in various leagues.

==Media==

The &quot;Tiverton Gazette&quot; is a weekly tabloid newspaper for Tiverton and district, published on Tuesdays to coincide with market day. It first appeared as the &quot;Tiverton Gazette and East Devon Herald&quot; in 1858, when the founder, Robert Were, was only 22 years old; he died just five years later. The newspaper split into three editions in 1872 – the &quot;Tiverton Gazette&quot;, &quot;Crediton Gazette&quot; and &quot;South Molton Gazette&quot; – but recombined in the mid-1890s as the &quot;Mid Devon Gazette&quot;. It then split into Town and Rural editions, before splitting three ways once more.

Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC South West and ITV West Country. Television signals are received from the Stockland Hill and local relay TV transmitters.

The town is served by the local radio stations BBC Radio Devon, Heart West, Greatest Hits Radio South West, Radio Exe, and TCR Radio, a community-based station.

==Geography==

Tiverton lies in north-east Devon north of Exeter, north-east of Plymouth and west of Taunton. The villages of Ashley to the south and Bolham to the north have become suburbs of Tiverton. The River Exe flows through the town.

===Climate===
Tiverton has an oceanic climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Cfb&quot;).

==Twin Towns==
Tiverton is twinned with the German town of Hofheim am Taunus. Tiverton is also twinned with Chinon in France which in turn is also twinned with Hofheim am Taunus. The three towns therefore form twinning triangel.

<text>The banded hare-wallaby, mernine, or munning (Lagostrophus fasciatus) is a marsupial currently found on the islands of Bernier and Dorre off western Australia. Reintroduced populations have recently been established on islands and fenced mainland sites, including Faure Island and Wadderin Sanctuary near Narembeen in the central wheatbelt.

== Taxonomy ==
The description of the species was published in the 1807 report of a French expedition to Australia. The authors, zoologist François Péron and illustrator Charles Lesueur, described a specimen collected at Bernier Island during their visit to the region in 1801, naming the new species as &quot;Kangurus fasciatus&quot;.

Evidence suggested that the mernine was the only living member of the sthenurine subfamily, and a recent osteology-based phylogeny of macropodids found that the banded hare-wallaby was indeed a bastion of an ancient lineage, agreeing with other (molecular) appraisals of the evolutionary history of &quot;L. fasciatus&quot;. However, the authors&#x27; analysis did not support the placement of the mernine within Sthenurinae, but suggest it belongs to a plesiomorphic clade which branched off from other macropodids in the early Miocene and founded the new subfamily Lagostrophinae. Recent analysis of mtDNA extracted from fossils of the sthenurine &quot;Simosthenurus&quot; supports this conclusion. This new subfamily includes the banded hare-wallaby and the fossil genus &quot;Troposodon&quot;.

== Description ==
The average banded hare-wallaby weighs ; females weigh more than the males. It measures about from the head to the end of the tail, with the tail almost the same length (averaging 375 mm) as the body. It has a short nose; its long, grey fur is speckled with yellow and silver and fades into a light grey on the underbelly. No colour variation is seen on the face or head, and its colouring is solid grey. Dark, horizontal stripes of fur start at the middle of the back and stop at the base of the tail.

==Behavior==

The banded hare-wallaby is nocturnal and tends to live in groups at nesting sites; this species is quite social. Nesting occurs in thickets under very dense brush. This macropod prefers to live in &quot;Acacia ligulata&quot; scrub. Males are extremely aggressive. 

==Distribution==
The species was once found on the mainland, in the southwest of Western Australia and South Australia, but its only surviving natural populations are now restricted to Bernier Island and Dorre Island off Western Australia. The species has been successfully reintroduced to Faure Island and Dirk Hartog Island in Shark Bay, and to a large fenced reserve at Mount Gibson Sanctuary in Western Australia. 

Although the banded hare-wallaby was once found across the south-western portion of Australia, it is believed to have been extinct on the mainland since 1963, and the last recorded evidence of the banded hare-wallaby on the Australian mainland was in 1906. The devastation of the species possibly can be attributed to the loss of habitat to the clearing of vegetation, the loss of food (due to competition with other animals), and predators.

==Diversity==
Two subspecies are recognized: &quot;L. f. fasciatus&quot; and &quot;L. f. baudinettei&quot;.

==Feeding==
This diprotodontian is a vegetarian and receives most of its water from food. It prefers to eat various grasses, fruit, and other vegetation. Male aggression is usually brought out in competition for food with other males and is very rarely expressed toward females.

==Reproduction==
Mating season starts in December and ends in September. The banded hare-wallaby reaches maturity at one year of age, breeding usually starts in the second year. Gestation appears to last several months and mothers generally raise one young each year, although females may produce two young per year. Young remain in their mother&#x27;s pouch for six months and continue to be weaned for another three months. In situations where a mother&#x27;s young dies, some mothers have an extra embryo to possibly rear another.

<text>Honiton () is a market town and civil parish in East Devon, situated close to the River Otter, north east of Exeter in the county of Devon. Honiton has a population estimated at 12,154 (based on 2021 census).

== History ==
The town grew along the line of the Fosse Way, the ancient Roman road linking Exeter (Isca Dumnoniorum) to Lincoln (Lindum). Contrary to 19th-century theories, it is unlikely to have been known as a stopping-point by the Romans, who built a small fort for that purpose just to the west of the present town. Honiton&#x27;s location is mentioned in the Domesday Book as Honetone, meaning Huna&#x27;s tun or farmstead.

=== Lace-making ===
Honiton later grew to become an important market town, known for lace making that was introduced by Flemish immigrants in the Elizabethan era. In the 17th century thousands of people produced lace by hand in their homes, and in the 19th century Queen Victoria had her wedding dress made of Honiton lace, though the dress itself was made in the fishing village of Beer. The town also became known for its pottery.

=== Fires ===
In 1747 and 1765 the town was badly damaged by fires. Georgian houses were then built to replace some of those that had been destroyed.

== Landmarks ==
The buildings of High Street are almost all Georgian, dating from after the two fires of 1747 and 1765. Of particular interest are Marwood House, 1619, and the Manor House, which was originally a coaching inn (the added porch is 19th-century). Honiton Garage dates from about 1700 and the Market Hall (which originally had arcades on the ground floor and an assembly room above) has a modest early-19th-century stone front.

=== Churches ===

St Michael&#x27;s Parish Church, which was rebuilt in 1911 after a fire, is situated on a small hill above the town. The old church was large and perfectly rectangular: it was built in the Perpendicular style, with two aisles, two transepts (which did not project), and the chancel and two chancel chapels equal to it in length. The west tower and the outer walls are all that remains of the old building. The cost of the original building was paid by Bishop Courtenay of Exeter, lord of the manor of Honiton (west part) and by John and Joan Takell (east part).

The mid-19th-century St Paul&#x27;s Church was designed by Charles Fowler and is situated in the centre of the town. Its erection in 1835 required an act of Parliament and the demolition of half of the adjacent Allhallows Chapel. It was built in 1837–38 in a style incorporating elements of Romanesque architecture. There are pinnacles on the tower and the arcades inside have tall columns; above the nave is a clerestory which resembles those in early Christian basilicas.

=== Museum ===
Allhallows Museum of Lace and Local Antiquities claims to hold one of the most comprehensive collections of Honiton lace in the world. It is located in a building, claimed to be the oldest still extant in Honiton, which formerly belonged to Allhallows School from the 16th Century until the 1930s.

==Culture==
=== Honiton Hot Pennies Ceremony ===
Honiton was granted a royal charter in 1221 during the reign of King Henry III that allowed it to hold a market. To celebrate, the town held the Honiton Fair, originally on Allhallows Eve and Allhallows Day (1 November), the date was changed in 1247 to the eve and feast of St Margaret (19/20 July). In order to encourage people to travel to the town from the surrounding area to attend a subsequent fair without fear of arrest for their debts, no arrests for outstanding debts were allowed while the fair took place. At the beginning landed gentry took pleasure in throwing hot chestnuts from windows to local peasants and over time these gave way to hot pennies, a seemingly philanthropic gesture resulting in burns (until the peasants figured out to wear gloves or use a cloth to pick the pennies up).

The Hot Pennies ceremony still takes place annually in the High Street of the town. At noon, the Town Crier, accompanied by the Mayor and other local dignitaries, raises a garlanded pole with gloved hand at the top, and proclaims that &quot;The glove is up. No man may be arrested until the glove is taken down&quot;. Pennies are then thrown from a number of balconies in the High Street to crowds of local people. The pole is then kept on display for the following &quot;fair week&quot;.

=== Agricultural Show ===
Honiton is host to the annual Honiton Agricultural Show, an event traditionally held on the first Thursday of August in fields near the town, dating back to 1890.

== Education ==
Honiton has two primary schools, Honiton Primary School and Littletown Primary School, as well as a secondary school, Honiton Community College, which includes a sixth form.

== Media ==
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC South West and ITV West Country. Television signals are received from the Stockland Hill and local relay transmitters.

Local radio stations are BBC Radio Devon on 103.4 FM, Heart West on 103.0 FM, and East Devon Radio, a community based radio station which broadcast to the town on 94.6 FM.

The town is served by the local newspaper, Midweek Herald which is published on Wednesdays.

== Transport ==

=== Road ===
Honiton is at the junction of the A35, the A30, A373 and A375 roads. The A30 now bypasses the town to the north. Until the bypass&#x27;s construction in 1966, the town was blighted by traffic congestion. Though, according to many residents, it still is. The town is 10½ miles from Junction 28 of the M5. Despite Honiton&#x27;s relatively small size, as a primary route destination beyond the western end of the A303, Honiton is signed from as far as Amesbury, over 60 miles away.

=== Rail ===
Honiton railway station is on the West of England Main Line and is served by South Western Railway services to London Waterloo and Exeter St Davids.

=== Bus ===
Stagecoach provides regular bus links to Sidmouth, Ottery St Mary and onwards to Exeter, Stagecoach also operates limited service to Seaton, Devon and Taunton. Dartline operates the town service and limited services in the surrounding area.

=== Air ===
Honiton is around 13 miles from Exeter Airport.

== Twin towns ==
Honiton is twinned with Mézidon-Canon in France, and Gronau (Leine) in Germany.

<text>Inca () is a town on the Spanish island of Mallorca. The population of the municipality is 32,137 (2018) in an area of 58.4 km2. 

There is a junction station on Mallorca&#x27;s rail network with trains to Palma, the island&#x27;s capital, to Sa Pobla, and to Manacor. 

Inca is home of the footwear company &quot;Camper&quot;.

Inca was known for its wine cellars. The town, like its neighboring municipality Binissalem, was a mass producer of wine from the 17th to 19th centuries when phylloxera destroyed the industry and its inhabitants turned to other activities such as tanning and leather craftsmanship. Many old wine cellars are being used as restaurants for serving traditional Mallorcan dishes like &quot;sopes mallorquines&quot;, &quot;tombet&quot; and &quot;gató d&#x27;ametlles&quot;.

<doc id="450854" wikidata="Q7261547" url="?curid=450854" title="Purrysburg, South Carolina">
<text>Purrysburg is an unincorporated community in Jasper County, South Carolina. While the town itself was abandoned, the settlers were successful. The town was located on the South Carolina bank of the Savannah River on 40,000 acres.

Purrysburg (aka Purysburg, Purrysburgh, Purysburgh, Purisburg, Purisbourg) was named after Jean-Pierre Purry, of the De Pury family from Neuchâtel which during this time did not belong to Switzerland as it does today, but to the King of Prussia. Purry, a man using slave labor, led the first settlers there in 1731. Pury first delivered his plan to the Duke of Newcastle as a representative of the Lord Proprietors, but roused no interest. But by the time Robert Johnson became Royal Governor in 1729, it fit very nicely with his needs and instructions. He was trying to strengthen and expand frontier settlement by any European Protestants to block French and Spanish expansion.

By 1736, there were 100 houses and as many as 450 settlers in the new town. The settlers were primarily French and German speaking Swiss Protestants from Neuchâtel and Geneva. At its peak the town likely had fewer than 600 residents. But the settlement suffered from disease and an unhealthy atmosphere. The settlers also had difficulties due to overlapping land grants. Over the next few decades many of them moved on to other towns in South Carolina, or the newly developing Georgia.

Archaeological exploration at Purrysburg includes studies in the 1980s by LePionka, Elliott and Smith. More recently the townsite was explored by archaeologists with the LAMAR Institute for its Revolutionary War battlefield.

As of 2010, descendents of the American De Pury family live in Tampa, and Pensacola Florida.

<doc id="450855" wikidata="Q2022162" url="?curid=450855" title="Kingdom of Pergamon">
<text>The Kingdom of Pergamon, Pergamene Kingdom, or Attalid kingdom was a Greek state during the Hellenistic period that ruled much of the Western part of Asia Minor from its capital city of Pergamon. It was ruled by the Attalid dynasty (; ).

The kingdom was a rump state that was created from the territory ruled by Lysimachus, a general of Alexander the Great. Philetaerus, one of Lysimachus&#x27; lieutenants, rebelled and took the city of Pergamon and its environs with him; Lysimachus died soon after in 281 BC. The new kingdom was initially in a vassal-like relationship of nominal fealty to the Seleucid Empire, but exercised considerable autonomy and soon became entirely independent. It was a monarchy ruled by Philetaerus&#x27;s extended family and their descendants. It lasted around 150 years before being eventually absorbed by the Roman Republic during the period from 133–129 BC.

== History ==
===From autonomy to independence (282–241 BC) ===
Philetaerus rose from humble origins to become a lieutenant of Lysimachus, one of Alexander the Great&#x27;s generals (diadochi), who ruled a large state centered around Byzantium. Philetaerus was trusted to manage the fortress of Pergamon and guard much of Lysimachus&#x27;s treasury, and had 9,000 talents under his purview. At some point prior to 281 BC, Philetaerus deserted Lysimachus and rebelled, allegedly over fears of Arsinoe, Lysimachus&#x27;s wife, who was accused of arranging the death of Agathocles, Lysimachus&#x27;s son. In 281 BC, Seleucus I Nicator, another of Alexander&#x27;s generals, defeated and killed Lysimachus at the Battle of Corupedium, while Seleucus himself was killed a few months later. Philetaerus offered his services to Seleucus and his successors of the Seleucid Empire, but enjoyed considerable autonomy. He extended his power and influence beyond just the city of Pergamon, making allies with neighboring city states. He contributed troops, money, and food to the city of Cyzicus, in Mysia, for its defense against the invading Gauls, thus gaining prestige and goodwill for him and his family. He built the sanctuary of Demeter on the acropolis of Pergamon, the temple of Athena (Pergamon&#x27;s patron deity), and Pergamon&#x27;s first palace. He added considerably to the city&#x27;s fortifications.

Philetaerus&#x27; nephew and adopted son, Eumenes I, succeeded him upon his death in 263 BC. He rebelled and defeated the Seleucid king Antiochus I Soter near the Lydian capital of Sardis in 261 BC. He created an outright independent Pergamese state, and greatly increased its territories. He established garrisons, such as Philetaireia, in the north at the foot of Mount Ida, which was named after his adoptive father, and Attaleia, in the east, to the northeast of Thyatira near the sources of the river Lycus, which was named after his grandfather. He also extended his control to the south of the river Caïcus, reaching the Gulf of Cyme. Eumenes I minted coins with the portrait of Philetaerus, who during his reign had still been depicting the Seleucid king Seleucus I Nicator on his coins.

===Reign of Attalus I Soter (241–197 BC) ===
Attalus I () succeeded Eumenes I after being adopted as his son. Early in his reign, he won a battlefield victory against the Galatians of Asia Minor (called Gauls by Pausanias) at the Battle of the Caecus River. This victory was a key to the legitimacy of Hellenistic kings, who styled themselves after Alexander the Great&#x27;s legacy of military glories, and improved the standing and prestige of the kingdom. Attalus took the name &quot;Soter&quot;, &quot;Savior&quot;, afterward, and explicitly took the title of &quot;basileus&quot;, king. Several years later, the &quot;War of the Brothers&quot; broke out in the Seleucid Empire between Seleucus II Callinicus and Antiochus Hierax. Antiochus Hierax made alliances with other kings in Asia Minor, his base of power, including both the Galatians and the Cappadocians. Around 230 BC, Hireax attacked Pergamon with the help of the Galatians. Attalus defeated the Gauls and Antiochus in the Battle of Aphrodisium and in a second battle in the east. He then fought Antiochus alone in a battle near Sardis and in the Battle of the Harpasus in Caria in 229 BC. After this Antiochus left to start a campaign in Mesopotamia, and then pivoted toward Thrace in 227 BC. He was killed in battle against the Gauls and the Kingdom of Tylis. With Antiochus Hierax&#x27;s death, Attalus gained control over all Seleucid territories in Asia Minor north of the Taurus Mountains. He repulsed several attempts by Seleucus III Ceraunus, who had succeeded Seleucus II, to recover the lost territory. The newly expanded kingdom stretched over .

The expansion was not to last long. In 223 BC, Seleucus III crossed the Taurus, but was assassinated, and the general Achaeus assumed control of the Seleucid army. Antiochus III the Great made Achaeus governor of the Seleucid territories north of the Taurus. Achaeus embarked upon a remarkably successful military campaign. Within two years, he had recovered the lost territories, taken parts of the traditional Pergamese heartland, and forced Attalus to retreat within the walls of Pergamon. However, Achaeus himself turned on Antiochus III and proclaimed himself a king, perhaps because he was accused of intending to revolt anyway, or perhaps simply drunk with success. By 220/219 BC, Achaeus and Attalus seem to have made peace.

In 218 BC, Achaeus undertook an expedition to Selge, south of the Taurus. Attalus recaptured his former territories with the help of some Thracian Gauls. Achaeus returned from his victorious campaign in 217 BC and hostilities between the two resumed. Attalus made an alliance with Antiochus III, who besieged Achaeus in Sardis in 214 BC. Antiochus captured the city and put Achaeus to death in the next year. Attalus regained control over his territories.

The Attalids became allies of the Roman Republic during the First Macedonian War (214–205 BC), although their participation was rather ineffective and insignificant. They would go on to support Rome in many subsequent wars. Attalus I, who had helped the Romans in the first war, also provided them with assistance in the Second Macedonian War (200–197 BC).

===Expansion after the Treaty of Apamea (197–138 BC)===
King Antiochus III of the Seleucids seem to have conquered or at least cowed into neutrality much of Pergamese territory in 198 BC; by 196 BC, at least, it seems that Antiochus III was able to march his armies through the area without opposition, and important putatively Attalid cities such as Phocaea and Thyatira were in Seleucid possession. The authority of the Pergamese state was hanging by a thread when Eumenes II () came to the throne in 197 BC. Eumenes II sought alliances with the Achaean League, rejected an offer of marriage and alliance with the Seleucids, and supported Rome in the Roman–Seleucid War of 192–188 BC. In 188 BC, after the war&#x27;s end by the Treaty of Apamea, the Romans seized the possessions of the defeated Antiochus III in Asia Minor and gave Mysia, Lydia, Phrygia, and Pamphylia to the kingdom of Pergamon and Caria, Lycia and Pisidia, in the southwestern corner of Asia Minor, to Rhodes, another Roman ally. Later the Romans gave these possessions of Rhodes to Pergamon. These acquisitions were an enormous increase in the size and influence of Pergamon. During the reign of Eumenes II, the Pergamese would also fight the Galatian War, Prusias I of Bithynia (around 188–184 BC?), Pharnaces I of Pontus (around 183–179 BC?), and would aid the Romans again in the Third Macedonian War (171–168 BC). Eumenes II also successfully intervened in Seleucid politics, aiding Antiochus IV Epiphanes in his quest to take the throne from Heliodorus.

Eumenes II was ill for the last decade of his life, and was succeeded by his brother Attalus II as king in 159 BC, although Attalus II had already assumed many key responsibilities by then. Before he became king, he was a military commander. In 190 BC he took part in the Battle of Magnesia, which was the final victory of the Romans in the war against the Seleucids. In 189 BC he led the Pergamene troops which flanked the Roman army under Gnaeus Manlius Vulso in the Galatian War. He was the lead commander in the war with Pontus, as well. After becoming king in his own right, he made war against Prusias II of Bithynia in 156–154 BC with the help of the Romans. He also made an alliance and received troops from Ariarathes V of Cappadocia, led by his son Demetrius. Attalus expanded his kingdom and founded the cities of Philadelphia and Attalea-in-Pamphylia. In 152 BC the two kings and Rome helped and funded Alexander Balas in his successful bid to start a civil war in the Seleucid Empire and to seize the Seleucid throne from Demetrius I Soter. In 149 BC, Attalus helped Nicomedes II Epiphanes to seize the Bithynian throne from his father Prusias II. Attalus II also aided the Romans in the Fourth Macedonian War, the final war that destroyed Macedonia as a political force.

===Final years (138–129 BC)===
Not that much has survived in ancient sources of the reign of the last Attalid king, Attalus III; they tend to focus on his personal character rather than describe events during his reign. He seems to have continued to defend his kingdom militarily and to have funded various cults and religious works. He did not have any children, and bequeathed his realm to the Roman Republic in his will with his death in 133 BC. The Romans were reluctant to take on territory in Asia Minor and did not take charge of the kingdom. A man named Aristonicus, claiming to be the illegitimate son of Eumenes II, assumed the dynastic name of Eumenes III, attempted to overturn Attalus III&#x27;s will, and apparently acquired authority at least in the core Pergamese cities. In 131 or 130 BC Rome sent an army against him which was defeated. Scandalously for the time, Eumenes III was apparently willing to recruit slaves for his army and arm them. However, a second force defeated Eumenes III in 129 BC. They annexed the former kingdom of Pergamon, which became the Roman province of Asia.

==Art, religion, and culture==
Two notable cults in early Pergamon were the cult of the Cabiri, a pantheon likely of original Phrygian or Thracian origin that became syncretized with Greek beliefs and mythology, and the Corybantes, worshippers of the mother goddess Cybele (possibly the Asia Minor equivalent of the Greek goddess Rhea). Various art and statues were built to them. The worship of Cybele would later intersect with Roman history. According to Livy, during the Second Punic War between Rome and Carthage (205 BC), the Sibylline Oracle told the Senate that Carthage would be defeated if the cult of the &quot;Mater Deum Magna Idaea&quot; (&quot;Magna Mater&quot; = &quot;Great Mother&quot;) was imported into Rome. At the time, Pergamon was Rome&#x27;s closest ally in the region of the Greek Eastern Mediterranean, and they sought out artifacts from the region that matched the request, where the closest equivalent goddess was Cybele. A sacred stone dedicated to Cybele under Pergamese stewardship was sent to Rome within a year (and possibly other relics), and the new cult in Rome took credit for Rome&#x27;s eventual victory in 201 BC.

Another cult of importance, if more common in the Hellenistic world, was to the goddess Athena. A temple to Athena seems to have been built around the beginning of the third century BC, while Lysimachus still acknowledged Seleucid suzerainty, and portraits of Athena appeared on coinage. A festival was also held called &quot;Panathenaia&quot;, but nothing is known of it. By 220 BC, Attalus I is recorded as holding important games in Athena&#x27;s honor, and likely expanding the precincts of Athena&#x27;s temple. At some point at either the end of Attalus I&#x27;s rule or near the start of Eumenes II&#x27;s rule, Athena was given the local title &quot;Nikephoros&quot;, &quot;bestower of victory.&quot; Eumenes II would create a magnificent new two-story temple to Athena, refounded the festival in her honor as the festival of Nikephoria in 181 BC, and dedicated a site outside the city with the name Nikephorion. The Nikephoria would be the most important religious celebration in Pergamum in the 2nd century BC.

After the Pergamese expansion in size and prestige after the Treaty of Apamea, King Eumenes II embarked upon a vast building program in Pergamon to suit the capital&#x27;s new prominence. He expanded the Library of Pergamon that had probably been started by his father Attalus I, which adjoined the newly created Temple to Athena noted above. He also began construction of the great Pergamon Altar in the late 180s BC. In its interior there is a frieze depicting the life of Telephus, son of the demigod Herakles. The ruling dynasty associated Telephus with its city and claimed him as its legendary forefather and the ancestor of the Attalids. Pergamon, having entered the Greek world much later than its counterparts to the west, could not boast the same divine heritage as older city-states and so had to cultivate its place in Greek mythology retroactively. Telephus defeating the giants in the Gigantomachy was likely allegorical to the modern Attalids defeating the Galatians and Gauls in a similar battle of good vs. evil, to burnish the legitimacy of the dynasty. Similarly, the Attalids implausibly claimed a link to Alexander the Great via Pergamus, a very marginal figure who was a son of Andromache and Neoptolemus. According to the Attalids, Pergamus had founded the city of Pergamon and named it after himself, while they claimed Andromache was a distant ancestor of Olympias, Alexander&#x27;s mother.

==Territory==
==Dynasty of Pergamon==
Knowledge of the dates of the reigns of the Attalid kings are largely based on Strabo&#x27;s &quot;Geography&quot;, with a few minor corrections by modern historians for apparent slips of the pen.

* Philetaerus (282–263 BC)
* Eumenes I (263–241 BC)
* Attalus I Soter (241–197 BC)
* Eumenes II (197–159 BC)
* Attalus II Philadelphus (159–138 BC)
* Attalus III (138–133 BC)
* Eumenes III Aristonicus (pretender, 133–129 BC)

A notable aspect of Attalid dynastic propaganda was the unity of the family and the avoiding of petty royal squabbles between siblings that consumed their neighbors in civil wars and assassinations. Perhaps spurred by the precariousness of their royal claim, the Attalids displayed remarkable cooperation between each other. Polybius has Philip V of Macedon praise the Attalids, his enemies, for their unity as instrumental to their success as he mourns the hatred between his own sons that brought down the Antigonid Macedonian kingdom. While this dialogue was surely a literary invention, it seems accurate that the Attalid royal court avoided scandal and appealed well to the common citizenry.

<text>WRAL-TV (channel 5) is a television station licensed to Raleigh, North Carolina, United States, serving as the NBC affiliate for the Research Triangle area. It is the flagship station of the locally based Capitol Broadcasting Company, which has owned the station since its inception.

WRAL-TV is a sister station to Fox affiliate WRAZ (channel 50, also licensed to Raleigh), Class A news-formatted independent station WNGT-CD (channel 34, licensed to both Smithfield and Selma), and radio stations WRAL (101.5 FM), WCMC-FM (99.9), WDNC (620 AM), and WCLY (1550 AM). The television stations share studios at Capitol Broadcasting Company headquarters on Western Boulevard in west Raleigh; WRAL-TV&#x27;s transmitter is located in Auburn, North Carolina.

WRAL-TV has been affiliated with NBC since February 29, 2016, when it ended a 30-year affiliation with CBS, with CBS going to Goldsboro-licensed WNCN (channel 17) on that date. This is channel 5&#x27;s second stint with NBC; it was a primary affiliate with that network for six years at the station&#x27;s inception, after which it took on a secondary affiliation with NBC for the next nine years.

==History==

===Early years===
WRAL-TV began broadcasting on December 15, 1956. Among the first programs aired was the movie &quot;Miracle on 34th Street&quot;. A. J. Fletcher&#x27;s Capitol Broadcasting Company, which first licensed WRAL Radio (AM 1240, now WPJL) in 1938, won the TV license in an upset over the much larger Durham Life Insurance Company, then-owners of radio station WPTF.

WRAL was originally an NBC affiliate, taking that network from Durham-based WTVD (channel 11, which included Fletcher&#x27;s son, Floyd, among its founders). When WNAO-TV (channel 28), the Triangle&#x27;s CBS affiliate, went dark at the end of 1957 and the affiliation moved to WTVD (which was an ABC affiliate at that point) in the process, WRAL shared ABC with WTVD until August 1, 1962, when channel 5 took the ABC affiliation full-time. This was unusual for a two-station market. ABC was at the time the smallest and weakest of the three major networks; it would not be on par with NBC and CBS in terms of ratings or affiliated stations until the early 1970s. WRAL did, however, continue to carry &quot;The Huntley-Brinkley Report&quot; until January 3, 1967, when ABC&#x27;s own evening newscasts expanded to 30 minutes. WRAL also continued to carry &quot;My Three Sons&quot; for several years after that show switched networks, from ABC to CBS.

From 1960 until his election to the United States Senate in 1972, Jesse Helms was an editorialist on WRAL-TV&#x27;s news broadcasts; by the early 1970s, the editorials were running for 10 minutes every weeknight. Helms&#x27; conservative commentaries were both controversial and popular with many viewers.

===Switch to CBS===
In March 1985, WTVD&#x27;s owner, Capital Cities Communications, purchased ABC, resulting in WTVD becoming an owned-and-operated station of that network. The CBS affiliation moved to WRAL-TV on August 4, 1985. Within six months of the switch, WRAL-TV had become one of the strongest CBS affiliates in the country. It is one of the few stations in the country to have been a primary affiliate of all of the &quot;Big Three&quot; networks.

In December 1989, WRAL was knocked off the air when a severe ice storm caused the collapse of the station&#x27;s transmitter tower. Within hours, channel 5 cut a deal with the then-struggling Fayetteville independent station WKFT-TV (channel 40, now Univision O&amp;O WUVC-DT), allowing WRAL to return to the air in only three hours. WKFT ran the entire WRAL schedule during this time. The station&#x27;s new, stronger tower was activated on October 25, 1990, at which point WKFT reverted to broadcasting its own programming.

In the early 1990s, WRAL distributed its programming via C-Band satellite as part of the Primetime 24 package, reaching viewers in the Caribbean and Latin America, as well as the few rural areas of the United States and Canada where local over-the-air broadcast signals were not available. It was replaced in the late 1990s with fellow CBS affiliate WSEE-TV from Erie, Pennsylvania, primarily because of WRAL&#x27;s preemptions of network programming due to ACC basketball games, which were (and still are) a highly-popular audience draw in North Carolina.

===Return to NBC===
On January 15, 2016, WRAL-TV announced that it would switch to NBC on February 29, 2016. Concurrently, CBS announced that the existing NBC station, Media General-owned and Goldsboro-licensed WNCN (channel 17), would replace WRAL-TV as the Triangle&#x27;s CBS affiliate the same day. Capitol Broadcasting president and CEO Jim Goodmon stated that CBS would only renew its affiliation with WRAL if it entered into a reverse compensation agreement—under which Capitol would be required to pay the network for the local rights to air its programming, the complete opposite of traditional commercial television practices. NBC, on the other hand, took the line that an affiliation deal was a partnership. Goodmon saw the switch to NBC as &quot;a business decision for the future.&quot; The last CBS program to air on WRAL was a showing of the movie &quot;Last Vegas&quot; at 9 p.m. Eastern Time.

WRAL officially rejoined NBC at 7 a.m. on February 29. In a ceremony at the end of the morning newscast, Goodmon pressed a button decorated with the NBC peacock to switch to &quot;Today&quot;.

Meredith College professor Doug Spero suggested that WRAL&#x27;s overall dominance in the Triangle was so absolute that it was in a position to become one of NBC&#x27;s strongest affiliates, much as it was one of CBS&#x27; strongest affiliates. The feeling was mutual; according to NBC News correspondent Harry Smith, NBC officials felt like they had &quot;just won the lottery&quot; when they learned WRAL was rejoining NBC. Indeed, on the first day of WRAL&#x27;s return to NBC, several dayparts saw NBC jump from third to first in the Triangle ratings at one stroke. Notably, &quot;Today&quot;, the &quot;NBC Nightly News&quot;, and &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon&quot; immediately saw major ratings gains in the market after their move to WRAL. The former two shows tallied their highest ratings on record in the Triangle on the day channel 5 officially returned to NBC, showing gains of well over 200 percent compared to their previous showings on WNCN. By contrast, CBS&#x27; competing programs lost more than half their audience share, falling from first to third in one stroke. NBC had struggled in the Triangle ratings for more than 40 years, dating to when it was all but forced to move its programming full-time to WRDU-TV (channel 28, later WPTF-TV and now WRDC) in 1971. While NBC&#x27;s performance in the area improved somewhat after it moved to WNCN in 1995, that station had remained stubbornly in third place for most of its 20-year run with the network.

The delay in the affiliation switch kept CBS&#x27;s coverage of Super Bowl 50, which featured the Carolina Panthers (based in nearby Charlotte) as champions of the National Football Conference, on WRAL-TV. As an NBC station, channel 5 carried the 2016 Stanley Cup Finals and the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, making it the only television station in the United States to air all three events from different networks in the same year.

==Programming==
WRAL clears most of the NBC schedule in pattern, except for one hour of &quot;The More You Know&quot; (NBC&#x27;s E/I-compliant block), which it preempts in favor of paid programming in the noon hour on Saturdays (as a CBS affiliate, it cleared the network&#x27;s entire schedule from the late 1990s until it rejoined NBC). The only exceptions involved ACC football and basketball from Raycom Sports, both of which aired on the station from 1977, when they moved from WTVD, until the end of the syndication package in 2019. ACC-preempted NBC programming aired either as originally scheduled on digital subchannel 5.2 (which is otherwise an affiliate of Cozi TV) or overnights on the main signal. &quot;The More You Know&quot; is split over two days; the first hour airs on Saturdays from 10 to 11 a.m., with &quot;Brain Game&quot; and &quot;Smart Start Kids&quot; (both of which count toward WRAL&#x27;s E/I commitments) airing from 11 a.m. to noon, and the second hour airs on Sundays from 11 a.m. to noon.

However, the 2003 reality show &quot;Cupid&quot; did not air on the station, as have some controversial shows on sister station WRAZ, and WRAL was one of a few CBS affiliates in the nation that did not carry an hour of CBS&#x27; weekend morning children&#x27;s programming block (in favor of &quot;Brain Game&quot; and &quot;Smart Start Kids&quot;). WRAL was also one of the few CBS affiliates that aired &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot; at 4 p.m. as a lead-in to its 5 p.m. newscast. Most CBS stations in the Eastern Time Zone air &quot;Y&amp;R&quot; at 12:30 p.m. (CBS&#x27; recommended time for the show), but in the case of WRAL, the timeslot switch occurred in January 1993. This happened because the station&#x27;s sitcom reruns (the show being run at the time was an hour-long block of &quot;The Golden Girls&quot;, making it ironic that during their ABC affiliation they were one of 13 affiliates not to carry the original network run of &quot;Soap&quot;, another Witt/Thomas/Harris Production) were having no luck against &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot; on WTVD. (The second half of their noon newscast and &quot;Right This Minute&quot; aired in &quot;Y&amp;R&quot;″s recommended time slot.) Following WRAL-TV rejoining NBC on February 29, 2016, &quot;Y&amp;R&quot; continued to air at 4 p.m. on WNCN while WRAL-TV carried local news at the time slot until January 17, 2022, when WNCN moved it to its traditional 12:30 p.m. timeslot and introduced its own 4 p.m. newscast.

When WRAL joined CBS in 1985, it became the Triangle&#x27;s home for the NCAA Division I men&#x27;s basketball tournament, which has aired on CBS since 1981. Due to the Triangle&#x27;s (and North Carolina&#x27;s) longstanding status as a college basketball hotbed and local teams North Carolina and Duke being fixtures in the tournament, NCAA Tournament games on WRAL were consistently among the highest-rated programs in the Triangle during tournament season. WRAL aired the Tar Heels&#x27; national championship wins in 1993, 2005, and 2009; all five of the Blue Devils&#x27; national championship victories in 1991, 1992, 2001, 2010, and 2015; and two of the Blue Devils&#x27; other national championship appearances in 1994 and 1999. Despite the NCAA Tournament moving with the rest of the CBS schedule to WNCN, WRAL-TV continued to air ACC football and/or basketball.

WRAL has broadcast memorable locally produced children&#x27;s programming throughout its storied history. Its most famous and longest-running is &quot;Time for Uncle Paul&quot;, which ran from 1961 to 1981, and starred Paul Montgomery. He had played various other characters on other local shows before getting his own program. He voluntarily ended his program after station management suggested a change to an educational format.

Soon after, WRAL continued to produce acclaimed educational children&#x27;s shows such as &quot;Frog Hollow&quot;, &quot;Sparks&quot;, and &quot;The Androgena Show&quot;. Today, WRAL continues to produce educational programs with such shows as &quot;Smart Start Kids&quot; and &quot;Brain Game&quot;. In recent years, WRAL and UNC-TV have co-produced programming, such as the 2009 Gubernatorial Inauguration and the 2006 Parade of Sail Tall Ship Show in Beaufort. UNC-TV has, also, begun carrying WRAL&#x27;s award-winning &quot;Focal Point&quot; documentaries. WRAL has long been a corporate supporter of UNC-TV, often assisting them financially and occasionally with on-air talent during UNC-TV&#x27;s pledge drives.

WRAL announced on February 1, 2006, that it would begin to stream all of its programming live on the internet. This signified the latest advances in technology-driven delivery of product by a local television station. A few months later, WRAL was selected to be the flagship station for North Carolina Education Lottery drawings (twice daily for certain games, with the multi-jurisdictional Mega Millions Tuesday and Friday nights, and Powerball Wednesdays and Saturdays). On December 3, 2007, WRAL became the first local television station to stream live video to mobile phones.

===&quot;Football Friday&quot;===
Debuting in 1981, each Friday evening following the 11 p.m. news, Tom Suiter hosts &quot;Football Friday&quot; covering all high school football games throughout Wake and Durham counties along with a dozen or more counties. WRAL crews spread out across the area providing not just scores but video coverage of each of 25 to as many as 35 games in the area. The show is an extension of the expansion throughout the 1980s of high school football coverage on the 11 p.m. newscast. Each Friday, video crews are sent to cover two games each. WRAL videographers and sports reporters capture highlights of the first quarter of one game and second quarter of the other game. Editors have little more than an hour to prepare highlights. From 1995 through 2002, &quot;Football Friday&quot; was broadcast from WRAL&#x27;s Studio A with an audience of cheerleaders, bands, players and fans. The arrival of the North Carolina Education Lottery moved the show to the newsroom.

===News operation===
WRAL-TV presently broadcasts 42 hours of locally produced newscasts each week (with seven hours each weekday, three hours on Saturdays and four hours on Sundays). WRAL has the highest rated television news organization in the Triangle winning numerous regional Emmys. Most recently, WRAL and wral.com were nominated 29 times for Mid-South Regional Emmys.

Until his retirement on July 1, 1994, Charlie Gaddy co-anchored newscasts alongside Bobbie Battista, Adele Arakawa (now with KUSA-TV in Denver), Donna Gregory (who now works for WWAY in Wilmington), and Pam Saulsby (formerly of WTVJ in Miami). From 1994 to 2022, David Crabtree (formerly of KCNC-TV and KMGH-TV in Denver, WITN-TV in Washington, North Carolina, and WKRN-TV in Nashville) and Debra Morgan were part of the longest-running on-air news team (news, weather, and sports) in the Triangle and one of the longest-running news teams in the state. Long time sports anchor Tom Suiter retired on December 18, 2008, and was replaced by Jeff Gravely, also a sports reporter and anchor for the 10 p.m. news on WRAZ. Jeff Gravely retired from WRAL, and Chris Lea (formerly of WXII in Winston-Salem) became the sports anchor in 2020.

In September 1995, WRAL began to produce newscasts for WRAZ. That station usually simulcasts local breaking news coverage from WRAL. For national breaking news events, WRAZ carries Fox News coverage, while WRAL carries coverage from NBC News. Otherwise, WRAZ may broadcast NBC programming in case WRAL cannot do so as in news-related emergencies. The WRAZ broadcasts include a three-hour newscast at 7 a.m. weekday mornings and a weeknight hour-long, weekend half-hour newscast at 10 p.m., seven nights a week. WRAZ previously aired a 4 p.m. newscast on weekdays; however that newscast moved to WRAL on February 29, 2016, replacing &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot;.

WRAL was the first commercial station to provide high definition programming when it obtained an experimental HD transmission license from the FCC in 1996. On October 13, 2000, WRAL aired the world&#x27;s first all-HD newscast. On January 28, 2001, WRAL converted all of its newsgathering and broadcasts to all digital high definition (the WRAZ newscasts are broadcast in high definition as well). On November 17, 2006, WRAL had a special &quot;reunion&quot; newscast during the 6 p.m. broadcast with Gaddy, Battista and DeBardelaben reprising their roles once again in commemoration of the station&#x27;s 50th anniversary alongside Suiter. On October 10, 2007, the WRAL sports department launched a sports talk radio station, WCMC-FM (which switched from a country music format); it is now the only FM sports talk station in the area and broadcasts in HD Radio. WRAL&#x27;s newscasts are simulcast with local weather inserts on another sister station, WILM-LD in Wilmington.

The station moved newscasts out of the newsroom into Studio A in 2019 and upgraded to 4K cameras. A new set debuted with the noon newscast on October 31, 2019. The set, designed by Florida based FX Design Group, features a LED video wall, the largest installation in a local news operation, and a smaller curved LED wall near the anchor desk.

====Agricultural coverage====
WRAL was one of the first stations in North Carolina to cover agricultural markets and farm news in its regular newscasts. During 1953, &quot;Farm Program&quot; aired from 6 to 6:15 a.m. and &quot;Regional and Farm News&quot; aired between 12:45 and 12:55 p.m. from Fayetteville.

WRAL&#x27;s noon newscasts included a farm segment featuring each day&#x27;s farm commodity prices, followed by a feature agricultural story from somewhere in the viewing area or around North Carolina. This grew WRAL&#x27;s popularity in rural areas and with farmers, especially in Eastern North Carolina. The segments were anchored by veteran farm reporter Ray Wilkinson and were dropped in the late 1990s, but were continued on the evening news broadcasts by Ray&#x27;s son Dan Wilkinson. After the sudden unexpected death of Dan Wilkinson in October 2003, it was decided that the station would no longer have a full-time farm reporter and frequent agricultural coverage came to an end.

====Sky 5====
In 1979, WRAL became the state&#x27;s first television station to begin using a news helicopter, known as &quot;Sky 5&quot;. The Hughes 500 helicopter was painted in the livery of the Royal Saudi Air Force with &quot;Sky 5&quot; graphics added, reflecting the original customer before the sale fell through and WRAL purchased it for newsgathering.

The current Bell 407 helicopter was purchased for $2 million in 2000. The tail number represents the station&#x27;s channel, that this is the third news gathering helicopter for the station and WRAL&#x27;s role in pioneering high definition broadcasting. The aircraft was piloted by Steve Wiley, who had flown for the station from 1987 until his death on February 3, 2021. As of 2022 the helicopter is flown by two pilots that Wiley himself hired and trained to take over Sky 5 operations. Today, the aircraft is normally stored at the Raleigh-Durham International Airport, but a helipad is available on the roof above the Capitol Broadcasting President&#x27;s office in the WRAL buildings near downtown Raleigh. The helicopter is equipped with $600,000 worth of video equipment including cameras installed on the tail, two in the cabin and a gyroscope controlled high definition camera under the nose, all of which can be controlled from the rear of the aircraft by a videographer. WRAL modified the helicopter to reach speeds of 130 miles per hour providing access to anywhere in the Triangle within seven minutes.

In over 30 years of electronic news gathering using helicopters, WRAL has had no significant incidents and remains one of the few stations to own rather than lease their helicopter. &quot;Sky 5&quot; has also participated in numerous search and rescue operations over the years at the request of local emergency officials before returning to newsgathering duties.

====Awards====

WRAL has received award nominations for news 32 times, tying Nashville station WTVF in the 2012 Mid-South Regional Emmy Awards and won 11. WRAL took home the Emmy for News Excellence, Evening Newscast, Breaking News, Serious Feature News Report, Light Feature News Report, Light Feature News Series, Interactivity, Promo Spot News Same Day, Promo Spot News Image, Graphics Arts, and News Writing. Several of the 2012 Emmys came from coverage of the April 2011 tornadoes that ripped through the area. Parent company Capitol Broadcasting along with the A.J. Fletcher Foundation were awarded the Governor&#x27;s Award, the National Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences&#x27; highest honor in 2012 as well.

In 1997, WRAL received eight Mid-South Regional Emmy Awards including those for news excellence, best newscast, best hard news series and investigative reporting. In 1998, WRAL received seven Mid-South Regional Emmy Awards including those for best daytime newscast, special event coverage, news magazine, news promotion, public service announcement, and best children&#x27;s entertainment program.

WRAL was awarded nine Mid-South Regional Emmy Awards in 2000 including for documentaries on the Cape Light and coverage of the Special Olympics World Games. Jim Goodmon, president and CEO of WRAL parent company Capitol Broadcasting Company, Inc., was honored with the Lifetime Achievement Award as well.

In 2008, among the nine Emmy awards received by WRAL and WRAL.com received the inaugural award in Advanced Media for Interactivity for the video player used throughout the website. The station also won a bronze Horizon Interactive Award for their online hurricane tracker. Geoff Levine won the National Press Photographer of the Year award and the station received 6 awards from the North Carolina Associated Press Broadcasters.

WRAL has consistently swept television media categories in the &quot;Independent Weekly&quot; and &quot;Cary News&quot; annual &quot;Best Of&quot; awards voted by readers.

==Technical information==
===Subchannels===
The station&#x27;s digital signal is multiplexed:
On June 19, 1996, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) awarded WRAL-TV the first experimental high-definition television license in the United States. The station, identified as &quot;WRAL-HD&quot;, began digital television operations on UHF channel 32 over a month later, on July 23, 1996. The station&#x27;s digital signal moved to channel 53 in March 2000.

WRAL-TV was the first in the U.S. to broadcast a live sports program in high definition (on September 6, 1997), as well as the first HD newscast (on October 13, 2000). CBS utilized WRAL-HD in testing its own high-definition programming, and in 1999, began providing the station with a regular schedule of prime time programs in HD. HD sports programming recorded by WRAL was provided to other model stations as well. WRAL-TV&#x27;s pioneering efforts in digital television have won wide recognition from within the television industry.

===Analog-to-digital conversion===
WRAL-TV ended regular programming on its analog signal, over VHF channel 5, at 12:55 p.m. on June 12, 2009, the official date on which full-power television stations in the United States transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate. The station&#x27;s digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 48, using virtual channel 5.

As part of the SAFER Act, WRAL-TV kept its analog signal on the air until July 6 to inform viewers of the digital television transition through a loop of public service announcements from the National Association of Broadcasters.

===ATSC 3.0===

On June 29, 2016, WRAL became the first U.S. television station to begin broadcasting a full-time service using ATSC 3.0 digital television standards, operating under an experimental license from the FCC on UHF channel 39 as WRAL-EX. The service broadcast two subchannels, including a simulcast of WRAL&#x27;s main programming in 1080p high definition, and a demo loop of content in 4K ultra high-definition television, along with testing for NBC involving the 2016 Summer Olympics and 2018 Winter Olympics. The station produced episodes of its series &quot;Out &amp; About&quot; in 4K. However, WRAL-EX left the air in 2018 as a consequence of the FCC&#x27;s repacking process as a result of a spectrum auction and has not returned. On September 11, 2020, Capitol Broadcasting bought then-WARZ-CD for $725,000, and since then has used the station, now WNGT-CD, as an ATSC 3.0 multiplex for the region. Like WRAL-EX, WNGT-CD has since simulcast WRAL in 1080p as well.

===Mobile Emergency Alert System===
WRAL-TV debuted the first Mobile Emergency Alert System (M-EAS) in the United States on September 13, 2012. The system allows emergency information including text, web pages and video to be distributed to compatible receivers using existing digital television signals.

==Station coverage==
WRAL&#x27;s signal can be viewed across much of Central and Eastern North Carolina. The official eastern fringe of the Raleigh market is Halifax County and the western fringe is Orange County. The Virginia and South Carolina state lines make up the northern and southern fringe respectively, with the exception of Mecklenburg County, Virginia. WRAL can be seen well outside of the Raleigh market, with the signal penetrating parts of the Greenville, Greensboro, Wilmington, Charlotte, Roanoke–Lynchburg, Richmond, Norfolk and Florence–Myrtle Beach markets. WRAL&#x27;s signal reaches as far east as U.S. Highway 17 in the Greenville-Washington-New Bern market, including the city of Greenville. The fringe area of WRAL&#x27;s digital signal runs as far east as the western side of Beaufort County.

WRAL-TV is still viewed and is quite popular with many outside of the Triangle, mainly in portions of the Piedmont Triad, Eastern North Carolina, and even into parts of Southside Virginia and the Pee Dee region of South Carolina. It has long been available on cable as far east as Wilmington. The station is also known for its award-winning documentaries, children&#x27;s shows and news staff, which has attracted viewers from outside of the Raleigh market. Halifax County in Southside Virginia is frequently mentioned by WRAL, although it is located in the Roanoke–Lynchburg market.

===Significantly-viewed status===
In addition to the 23 counties in the Raleigh–Durham–Fayetteville market, the FCC lists WRAL as significantly viewed in Alamance, Caswell, Duplin, Greene, Robeson, and Scotland counties in North Carolina.

===Out-of-market cable carriage===
For decades, WRAL has been available on cable in much of the eastern portion of North Carolina, as far east as Wilmington. It is also available on cable systems in portions of the Charlotte and Triad media markets, as well as the North Carolina portions of the Hampton Roads and Florence–Myrtle Beach markets. In recent years, it has also been picked up by cable systems on the fringes of the Richmond and Roanoke markets.

During the 1970s and 1980s through CATV, WRAL was once carried in even more places. In North Carolina, it was once carried in Burlington, Greenville, Wadesboro, Wilmington, Williamston, and Yanceyville. In Virginia, it was once carried in Buena Vista, Danville, and Emporia.

==Amenities==
The station building, shared by WRAL-TV and WRAZ, and located at 2619 Western Boulevard in Raleigh, adjacent to the North Carolina State University campus, is a modern and open-designed structure and grounds. The property features a fountain visible from the roadway near the building entrance, a helipad on top of the building for the landing of Sky 5, and a large garden in the back of the property, including many varieties of azaleas and other flowering plants including several types of dogwoods. The garden is a popular public attraction, especially during April when the flowers are at the peak of blooming.

<text>Elmet (), sometimes Elmed or Elmete, was an independent Brittonic Celtic 
Cumbric-speaking kingdom between about the 4th century and mid-7th century.

The people of Elmet survived as a distinctly recognised Brittonic Celtic group for centuries afterwards in what later became the smaller area of the West Riding of Yorkshire, and now West Yorkshire, South Yorkshire and north Derbyshire.

== Geography ==
The precise borders of the original kingdom of Elmet are unclear. It may have been bounded by the rivers Sheaf in the south and Wharfe in the east until the 7th century. To the north it adjoined the kingdom of Deira and Mercia to the south, while its western boundary appears to have been near Craven, which was possibly another minor British kingdom. As such, it was not conterminous with other territories of the Britons at the time, being well to the south of others in the &quot;Hen Ogledd&quot; (&quot;Old North&quot;), such as Strathclyde, and north-east of Wales, Cornwall and Dumnonia. As one of the south-easternmost Brittonic regions for which there is reasonably substantial evidence, Elmet is notable for having survived relatively late in the period of Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain.

The term is used as an affix to place names between Leeds and Selby, including Barwick in Elmet and Sherburn in Elmet. It was thus used more widely in medieval times, for places in the wapentakes of Barkston Ash and Skyrack, including Burton Salmon, Sutton (east of Castleford), Micklefield, Kirkby Wharfe, Saxton, and Clifford. In the tribal hidage, the extent of Elmet is described as 600 hides; while a hide was a unit of value rather than area, 600 hides would probably have encompassed an area slightly larger than the combined total of the wapentakes of Barkston Ash and Skyrack. Hence scholars such as A. H. Smith concluded that those two wapentakes probably approximated much of the area of the former Elmet.

== History ==
Elmet is attested mainly in toponymic and archaeological evidence; a reference to one Madog Elfed in the medieval Welsh poem &quot;The Gododdin&quot; and to a Gwallog also operating somewhere in the region in one of the putatively early poems in the Book of Taliesin; and historical sources such as the &quot;Historia Brittonum&quot; and Bede. One source, the Anglo-Saxon &quot;Historia Brittonum&quot; states that Elmet was a kingdom, although it is the only source that says this directly. While Bede does not specifically describe Elmet as a kingdom, but rather as &quot;silva Elmete&quot; the &quot;forest of Elmet&quot;, it is clear from his discussion that it was a distinct polity, with its own monarchs. The name &#x27;Elfed/Elmet&#x27; is Brythonic in origin and is also found in Elfed, the name of a cantref in Dyfed, Wales.

From this evidence it appears that Elmet was one of a number of Sub-Roman Brittonic realms in the Hen Ogledd – what is now northern England and southern Scotland – during the Early Middle Ages. Other kingdoms included Rheged, the Kingdom of Strathclyde (Ystrad Clud), Bryneich and Gododdin. It is unclear how Elmet came to be established, though it has been suggested that it may have been created from a larger kingdom ruled by the semi-legendary Coel Hen. The historian Alex Woolf suggests that the region of Elmet had a distinct tribal identity in pre-Roman times and that this re-emerged after Roman rule collapsed.

Towards the end of the 6th century, Elmet came under increasing pressure from the expanding Anglo-Saxon kingdoms of Deira and Mercia. Forces from Elmet joined the ill-fated alliance in 590 against the Angles of Bernicia who had been making massive inroads further to the north. During this war it is thought Elmet&#x27;s king Gwallog was killed. The northern alliance collapsed after Urien of Rheged was murdered and a feud broke out between two of its key members.

After the unification of the Anglian Kingdom of Northumbria, King Edwin of Northumbria led an invasion of Elmet, and overran it in 616 or 617. Bede&#x27;s &quot;Ecclesiastical History of the English People&quot; says that a Northumbrian noble, Hereric (father of Hilda of Whitby), an exiled member of the Northumbrian royal house was killed with poison, while living at the court of King Ceretic of Elmet. It has been suggested that this was either the &quot;casus belli&quot; for the invasion, if Hereric was poisoned by his hosts, or a pretext for a Northumbrian annexation of Elmet, if Edwin himself had Hereric poisoned. The &quot;Historia Brittonum&quot; says that Edwin &quot;occupied Elmet and expelled Certic, king of that country&quot;. It is generally presumed that Ceretic was the same person known in Welsh sources as Ceredig ap Gwallog, king of Elmet. A number of ancestors of Ceretic are recorded in Welsh sources: one of Taliesin&#x27;s poems is for his father, Gwallog ap Lleenog, who may have ruled Elmet near the end of the 6th century. Bede mentions that &quot;subsequent kings made a house for themselves in the district, which is called Loidis&quot;.

However some sources do indicate that Elmet was actually peacefully annexed by Northumbria and that there was no direct military confrontation.

After the annexation of Elmet, the realm was incorporated into Northumbria on Easter in 627. Its people were known subsequently as the &quot;Elmetsæte&quot;. They are recorded in the late 7th century &quot;Tribal Hidage&quot; as the inhabitants of a minor territory of 600 hides. They were the most northerly group recorded in the &quot;Tribal Hidage&quot;. Probably continuing as a distinct Brittonic Celtic tribe throughout most of the Anglo-Saxon period, the tribe may have colluded with Cadwallon ap Cadfan of Gwynedd when he invaded Northumbria and briefly held the area in 633. 

A major battle between Northumbria and Mercia, the Battle of the Winwaed took place in the area in 655, according to Bede, somewhere in the region of &quot;Loidis&quot;.

The &quot;Life of Cathróe of Metz&quot; mentions &quot;Loidam Civitatem&quot; as the boundary between the Norsemen of Scandinavian York and the Celtic Britons of the Kingdom of Ystrad Clud (Strathclyde). This is thought to suggest that the Kingdom of Elmet may have either regained independence soon after Northumbria&#x27;s original annexation of it (Bede makes note of the fracturing of Northumbria after Edwin&#x27;s death) or later up to the time.

Interestingly; as late as 1315, a Florentine bill of sale (wool) records:
* &quot;d&#x27;Elmetta (Elmet) 11 marks per sack&quot;
* &quot;Di Ledesia (Leeds) 12½ marks per sack&quot;
* &quot;di Tresche (Thirsk) 10½ marks per sack&quot;
* &quot;de Vervicche (York) 10½ marks per sack.&quot;
The distinction between Leeds and Elmet in the bill is unexplained.

According to a genetic study published in &quot;Nature&quot; (19 March 2015), the local population of West Yorkshire is genetically distinct from the rest of the population of Yorkshire. The 2015 Oxford University study compared the current genetic distribution in Britain to the geographical maps of its historic Kingdoms, and found that the distinct genetic cluster closely corresponds to Elmet’s known territories.

==Aliotus Stone==
Around 1865, a Pillar stone with a 5th or early 6th century inscription was found at St Aelhaearn&#x27;s Church, Llanaelhaearn in Gwynedd. The Latin inscription reads &quot;, or &quot;Aliotus the Elmetian lies here&quot;. It is believed that this refers to an otherwise unattested Aliotus from the Kingdom of Elmet who may have been active in the area before Saint Aelhaiarn founded his church.

==Legacy==
The name survives throughout the area in place names such as Barwick-in-Elmet and Sherburn in Elmet. A local parliamentary constituency is also called Elmet and Rothwell.

The area to the western Calder Valley side of Elmet is the subject of a 1979 book combining photography and poetry, the &quot;Remains of Elmet&quot; by Ted Hughes and Fay Godwin. The book was republished by Faber &amp; Faber in 1994 as &quot;Elmet&quot;, with a third of the book being new poems and photographs.

A novel by Fiona Mozley called &quot;Elmet&quot; was shortlisted for the 2017 Booker Prize.
