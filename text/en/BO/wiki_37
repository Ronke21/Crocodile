<text>In the European Union, competition law promotes the maintenance of competition within the European Single Market by regulating anti-competitive conduct by companies to ensure that they do not create cartels and monopolies that would damage the interests of society.

European competition law today derives mostly from articles 101 to 109 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), as well as a series of Regulations and Directives. Four main policy areas include:

*Cartels, or control of collusion and other anti-competitive practices, under article 101 TFEU.
*Market dominance, or preventing the abuse of firms&#x27; dominant market positions under article 102 TFEU.
*Mergers, control of proposed mergers, acquisitions and joint ventures involving companies that have a certain, defined amount of turnover in the EU, according to the European Union merger law.
*State aid, control of direct and indirect aid given by Member States of the European Union to companies under TFEU article 107.

Primary authority for applying competition law within the European Union rests with the European Commission and its Directorate-General for Competition, although state aids in some sectors, such as agriculture, are handled by other Directorates-General. The Directorates can mandate that improperly-given state aid be repaid, as was the case in 2012 with Malev Hungarian Airlines.

Leading ECJ cases on competition law include &quot;Consten &amp; Grundig v Commission&quot; and &quot;United Brands v Commission&quot;. See also List of European Court of Justice rulings#Competition for other cases.

==History==
One of the paramount aims of the founding fathers of the European Community—statesmen around Jean Monnet and Robert Schuman—was the establishment of a Single Market. To achieve this, a compatible, transparent and fairly standardised regulatory framework for Competition Law had to be created. The constitutive legislative act was Council Regulation 17/62 (now superseded). The wording of Reg 17/62 was developed in a pre &quot;Van Gend en Loos&quot; period in EC legal evolution, when the supremacy of EC law was not yet fully established. To avoid different interpretations of EC Competition Law, which could vary from one national court to the next, the commission was made to assume the role of central enforcement authority.

The first major decision under Article 101 (then Article 85) was taken by the Commission in 1964. They found that Grundig, a German manufacturer of household appliances, acted illegally in granting exclusive dealership rights to its French subsidiary. In &quot;Consten &amp; Grundig&quot; [1966] the European Court of Justice upheld the commission&#x27;s decision, expanded the definition of measures affecting trade to include &quot;potential effects&quot;, and generally anchored its key position in Competition Law enforcement alongside the commission. Subsequent enforcement of Article 101 of the TFEU Treaty (combating anti-competitive business agreements) by the two institutions has generally been regarded as effective. Yet some analysts assert that the commission&#x27;s monopoly policy (the enforcement of Art 102) has been &quot;largely ineffective&quot;, because of the resistance of individual Member State governments that sought to shield their most salient national companies from legal challenges. The commission also received criticism from the academic quarters. For instance, Valentine Korah, an eminent legal analyst in the field, argued that the commission was too strict in its application of EC Competition rules and often ignored the dynamics of company behaviour, which, in her opinion, could actually be beneficial to consumers and to the quality of available goods in some cases.

Nonetheless, the arrangements in place worked fairly well until the mid-1980s, when it became clear that with the passage of time, as the European economy steadily grew in size and anti-competitive activities and market practices became more complex in nature, the commission would eventually be unable to deal with its workload. The central dominance of the Directorate-General for Competition has been challenged by the rapid growth and sophistication of the National Competition Authorities (NCAs) and by increased criticism from the European courts with respect to procedure, interpretation and economic analysis. These problems have been magnified by the increasingly unmanageable workload of the centralised corporate notification system. A further reason why a reform of the old Regulation 17/62 was needed, was the looming enlargement of the EU, by which its membership was to expand to 25 by 2004 and 27 by 2007. Given the still developing nature of the east-central European new market economies, the already inundated Commission anticipated a further significant increase in its workload.

To all these challenges, the commission has responded with a strategy to decentralise the implementation of the Competition rules through the so-called Modernisation Regulation. EU Council Regulation 1/2003 places National Competition Authorities and Member State national courts at the heart of the enforcement of Articles 101 and 102. Decentralised enforcement has for long been the usual way for other EC rules, Reg 1/2003 finally extended this to Competition Law as well. The Commission still retained an important role in the enforcement mechanism, as the co-ordinating force in the newly created European Competition Network (ECN). This Network, made up of the national bodies plus the commission, manages the flow of information between NCAs and maintains the coherence and integrity of the system. At the time, Competition Commissioner Mario Monti hailed this regulation as one that will &#x27;revolutionise&#x27; the enforcement of Articles 101 and 102. Since May 2004, all NCAs and national courts are empowered to fully apply the Competition provisions of the EC Treaty. In its 2005 report, the OECD lauded the modernisation effort as promising, and noted that decentralisation helps to redirect resources so the DG Competition can concentrate on complex, Community-wide investigations. Yet most recent developments shed doubt on the efficacy of the new arrangements. For instance, on 20 December 2006, the Commission publicly backed down from &#x27;unbundling&#x27; French (EdF) and German (E.ON) energy giants, facing tough opposition from Member State governments. Another legal battle is currently ongoing over the E.ON-Endesa merger, where the commission has been trying to enforce the free movement of capital, while Spain firmly protects its perceived national interests. It remains to be seen whether NCAs will be willing to challenge their own national &#x27;champion companies&#x27; under EC Competition Law, or whether patriotic feelings prevail. Many favour ever more uniformity in the interpretation and application of EU competition norms and the procedures to enforce them under this system. However, when there are such differences in many Member States&#x27; policy preferences and given the benefits of experimentation, in 2020 one might ask whether more diversity (within limits) might not produce a more efficient, effective and legitimate competition regime.

==Mergers and abuse of dominance==
===Scope of competition law===

Because the logic of competition is most appropriate for private enterprise, the core of EU competition regulation targets profit making corporations. This said, regulation necessarily extends further and in the TFEU, both articles 101 and 102 use the ambiguous concept of &quot;undertaking&quot; to delimit competition law&#x27;s reach. This uncomfortable English word, which is essentially a literal translation of the German word &quot;Unternehmen&quot;, was discussed in &quot;Höfner and Elser v Macrotron GmbH&quot;. The European Court of Justice described &quot;undertaking&quot; to mean any person (natural or legal) &quot;engaged in an economic activity&quot;, which potentially included state run enterprises in cases where they pursued economic activities like a private business. This included a state run employment agency, where it attempted to make money but was not in a position to meet demand. By contrast, in &quot;FENIN v Commission&quot;, public services which were run on the basis of &quot;solidarity&quot; for a &quot;social purpose&quot; were said to be outside the scope of competition law. Self-employed people, who are in business on their own account, will be classed as undertakings, but employees are wholly excluded. Following the same principle that was laid down by the US Clayton Act 1914, they are by their &quot;very nature the opposite of the independent exercise of an economic or commercial activity&quot;. This means that trade unions cannot be regarded as subject to competition law, because their central objective is to remedy the inequality of bargaining power that exists in dealing with employers who are generally organised in a corporate form.

===Mergers and acquisitions===

According to Article 102 TFEU, the European Commission has the power to regulate behaviour of large firms it claims to be abusing their dominant position or market power, as well as, preventing firms from gaining the position within the market structure that enables them to behave abusively in the first place. Mergers that have a &quot;community dimension&quot; are governed by the Merger Regulation (EC) No.139/2004, all &quot;concentrations&quot; between undertakings are subject to approval by the European Commission.  

A true merger, under to competition law, is where two separate entities merger into an entirely new entity, or where one entity acquires all, or a majority of, the shares of another entity, and is able to have control over that entity. Notable examples could include Ciba-Geigy and Sandoz merging to form Novartis, as well as Dow Chemical and DuPont merging to form DowDuPont.

Mergers can take a place on a number of basis. For example, a horizontal merger is where a merger takes place between two competitors in the same product and geographical markets and at same level of the production. A vertical merger is where mergers between firms that operate between firms that operate at different levels of the market. A conglomerate merger is merger between two strategically unrelated firms.

Under the original EUMR, according to Article 2(3), for a merger to be declared compatible with the common market, it must not create or strengthen a dominant position where it could affect competition, thus the central provision under EU law ask whether a concentration would if it went ahead would &quot;significantly impede effective competition…&quot;. Under Article 3(1), a concentration means a &quot;change of control on a lasting basis results from (a) the merger of two or more previously independent undertakings… (b) the acquisition…if direct or indirect control of the whole or parts of one or more other undertakings&quot;. In the original EUMR, dominance played a key role in deciding whether competition law had been infringed. However, in France v. Commission, it was established by the European Court of Justice, that EUMR also apply to collective dominance, this is also where the concept of collective dominance was established.

According to Genccor Ltd v. Commission, the Court of First Instance stated the purpose of merger control is &quot;…to avoid the establishment of market structures which may create or strengthen a dominant position and not need to control directly possible abuses of dominant positions&quot;. Meaning that the purpose for oversight over economic concentration by the states are to prevent abuses of dominant position by undertakings. Regulations of mergers and acquisition is meant to prevent this problem, before the creation of a dominant firm through mergers and/or acquisitions.

In recent years, mergers have increased in their complexity, size and geographical reach, as seen in the merger between Pfizer and Warner-Lambert. According to Merger Regulation No.139/2004, for these regulations to apply, a merger must have a &quot;community dimension&quot;, meaning the merger must have a noticeable impact within the EU, therefore the undertakings in question must have a certain degree of business within the EU common market. However, in Genccor Ltd v. Commission, the Court of First Instance(now the General Court) stated that it does not matter where the merger takes place, as long as it has an impact within the community, the regulations will apply.

Through &quot;economics links&quot;, a new market can become more conductive to collusion. A transparent a market has a more concentrated structure, meaning firms can co-ordinate their behaviour with relative ease, firms can deploy deterrents and shield themselves form a reaction by their competitors and consumers. The entry of new firms to the market, and any barriers that they might encounter should be considered. In Airtours plc v. Commission, although the commission&#x27;s decision here was annulled by the CFI, the case raised uncertainties, as it identifies a non-collusive oligopoly gap in EUMR.

Due to the uncertainty raised by the decision in Airtours v. Commission, it is suggested that an alternative approach to the problem raised in the case would be to ask whether the merger in question would &quot;substantially lessen Competition&quot; (SLC). According to the Roller De La Mano article, the new test does not insist on dominance being necessary or sufficient, arguing that under the old law, there was underenforcement, a merger can have serious anti-competitive effect even without dominance.

However, there exist certain exemptions under Article 2 EUMR, where anti-competitive conduct may be sanctioned, in the name of &quot;technical and economic progress, as well as the &quot;failing firm&quot; defence. Although the European Commission is less concerned with mergers taking place vertically, it has taken an interest in the effects of conglomerate mergers.

===Abuse of dominance===

Article 102 is aimed at preventing undertakings that have a dominant market position from abusing that position to the detriment of consumers. It provides that,
&quot;Any abuse by one or more undertakings of a dominant position within the common market or in a substantial part of it shall be prohibited as incompatible with the common market insofar as it may affect trade between Member States.
This can mean (a) directly or indirectly imposing unfair purchase or selling prices or other unfair trading conditions; 
(b) limiting production, markets or technical development to the prejudice of consumers;

(c) applying dissimilar conditions to equivalent transactions with other trading parties, thereby placing them at a competitive disadvantage; 
(d) making the conclusion of contracts subject to acceptance by the other parties of supplementary obligations which, by their nature or according to commercial usage, have no connection with the subject of such contracts.&quot;

The provision aims to protect competition and promote consumer welfare by preventing firms from abusing dominant market positions. This objective has been emphasized by EU institutions and officials on numerous occasions – for example, it was stated as such during the judgement in &quot;Deutsche Telekom v Commission&quot;, whilst the former Commissioner for Competition, Neelie Kroes, also specified in 2005 that: &quot;First, it is competition, and not competitors, that is to be protected. Second, ultimately the aim is to avoid consumer harm&quot;.

Additionally, the European Commission published its &quot;Guidance on Article [102] Enforcement Priorities&quot;, which details the body&#x27;s aims when applying Article 102, reiterating that the ultimate goal is the protection of the competitive process and the concomitant consumer benefits that are derived from it. This Guidance was amended in 2023, when the European Commission announced its intention to adopt Guidelines on exclusionary abuses under Article 102 TFEU in 2025. When the Guidelines will be adopted, the European Commission will withdraw the Guidance on Enforcement Priorities.

Notwithstanding the objectives stated above, Article 102 is quite controversial and has been much scrutinized. In large part, this stems from the fact that the provision applies only where dominance is present; meaning a firm that is not in a dominant market position could legitimately pursue competitive practices – such as bundling – that would otherwise constitute abuse if committed by a dominant firm. That is not to suggest that it is unlawful for a firm to hold a dominant position; rather, it is the &quot;abuse&quot; of that position that is the concern of Article 102 – as was stated in &quot;Michelin v Commission&quot; a dominant firm has a &quot;special responsibility not to allow its conduct to impair undistorted competition&quot;.

In applying Article 102, the Commission must consider two points. Firstly, it is necessary to show that an undertaking holds a dominant position in the relevant market and, secondly, there must be an analysis of the undertaking&#x27;s behavior to ascertain whether it is abusive. Determining dominance is often a question of whether a firm behaves &quot;to an appreciable extent independently of its competitors, customers and ultimately of its consumer&quot;. Under EU law, very large market shares raise a presumption that a firm is dominant, which may be rebuttable. If a firm has a dominant position, because it has beyond a 39.7% market share, then there is &quot;a special responsibility not to allow its conduct to impair competition on the common market&quot; Same as with collusive conduct, market shares are determined with reference to the particular market in which the firm and product in question is sold.

With regard to abuse, it is possible to identify three different forms that the EU Commission and Courts have recognized. Firstly, there are &quot;exploitative&quot; abuses, whereby a dominant firm abuses its market position to exploit consumers – for example by reducing output and increasing the price of its goods or services. Secondly, there are &quot;exclusionary&quot; abuses, involving behavior by a dominant firm which is aimed at, or has the effect of, preventing the development of competition by excluding competitors. Finally, there exists a possible third category of &quot;single market&quot; abuse, which concerns behavior that is harmful to the principles of the single market more broadly, such as the impeding of parallel imports or limiting of intra-brand competition.

Although there is no rigid demarcation between these three types, Article 102 has most frequently been applied to forms of conduct falling under the heading of exclusionary abuse. Generally, this is because exploitative abuses are perceived to be less invidious than exclusionary abuses because the former can easily be remedied by competitors provided there are no barriers to market entry, whilst the latter require more authoritative intervention. Indeed, the commission&#x27;s &quot;Guidance&quot; explicitly recognizes the distinction between the different types of abusive conduct and states that the Guidance is limited to examples of exclusionary abuse. As such, much of the jurisprudence of Article 102 concerns behavior which can be categorized as exclusionary.

The Article does not contain an explicit definition of what amounts to abusive conduct and the courts have made clear that the types of abusive conduct in which a dominant firm may engage is not closed. However, it is possible to discern a general meaning of the term from the jurisprudence of the EU courts. In &quot;Hoffman-La Roche&quot;, it was specified that dominant firms must refrain from &#x27;methods different from those which condition normal competition&#x27;. This notion of &#x27;normal&#x27; competition has developed into the idea of &#x27;competition on the merits&#x27;, which states that competitive practices leading to the marginalization of inefficient competitors will be permissible so long as it is within the realm of normal, or on the merit, competitive behavior. The Commission provides examples of normal, positive, competitive behavior as offering lower prices, better quality products and a wider choice of new and improved goods and services. From this, it can be inferred that behavior that is abnormal – or not &#x27;on the merits&#x27; – and therefore amounting to abuse, includes such infractions as margin squeezing, refusals to supply and the misleading of patent authorities.

Some examples of the types of conduct held by the EU Courts to constitute abuse include:
* Exclusive dealing agreements, whereby a customer is required to purchase all or most of a particular type of good or service from a dominant supplier and is prevented from buying from others.
* Granting of exclusivity rebates, purported loyalty schemes that are equivalent in effect to exclusive dealing agreements.
* Tying one product to the sale of another, thereby restricting consumer choice.
* Bundling, similar to tying, whereby a supplier will only supply its products in a bundle with one or more other products.
* Margin squeezing: vertical practices which have the effect of excluding downstream competitors.
* Refusing to license intellectual property rights, whereby a dominant firm holding patented rights refuses to license those rights to others.
* Refusing to supply a competitor with a good or service, often in a bid to drive them out of the market.
* Predatory pricing, where a dominant firm deliberately reduces prices to loss-making levels to force competitors out of the market. 
* Price discrimination, arbitrarily charging some market participants higher prices that are unconnected to the actual costs of supplying the goods or services.
* leveraging a dominant position by way of self-preferencing, although the terminology and exact scope of the abuse is still being determined.

Whilst there are no statutory defences under Article 102, the Court of Justice has stressed that a dominant firm may seek to justify behaviour that would otherwise constitute abuse, either by arguing that the behaviour is objectively justifiable or by showing that any resulting negative consequences are outweighed by the greater efficiencies it promotes. In order for behaviour to be objectively justifiable, the conduct in question must be proportionate and would have to be based on factors external to the dominant undertaking&#x27;s control, such as health or safety considerations. To substantiate a claim on efficiency grounds, the commission&#x27;s &quot;Guidance&quot; states that four cumulative conditions must be satisfied:
# The efficiencies would have to be realised, or be likely to be realised, as a result of the conduct;
# The conduct would have to be indispensable to the realisation of those efficiencies;
# The efficiencies would have to outweigh any negative effects on competition and consumer welfare; And
# The conduct must not eliminate all effective competition.
If an abuse of dominance is established, the commission has the power, pursuant to Article 23 of Regulation 1/2003, to impose a fine and to order the dominant undertaking to cease and desist from the unlawful conduct in question. Additionally, though yet to be imposed, Article 7 of Regulation 1/2003 permits the commission, where proportionate and necessary, to order the divestiture of an undertaking&#x27;s assets.

==== Examples of mergers prevented by the European Commission ====
The EU test is the tool by which the European Commission judges the validity of a merger. If a company attains a significant strengthening of its dominant position in the market due to the merger, the European Commission is allowed to prevent the merger between the two firms.

*In 2001, the EU blocked the proposed merger between General Electric and Honeywell, although it has already been cleared by the American authorities. The reasoning of the European Commission was that the merger would significantly impede the competition in the aerospace industry and therefore the European Commission intervened.
*Another merger prevented by the Commission was the merger between the Dutch package delivery company TNT and the American counterpart UPS. The European Commission was worried that the takeover would leave the continent with only two dominant players: UPS and DHL.
*Most recently, the proposed takeover of Aer Lingus by Ryanair would have strengthened Ryanair&#x27;s position in the Irish market and has therefore been blocked by the European Commission.

===Oligopolies===
==Cartels and collusion==

Possibly the least contentious function of competition law is to control cartels among private businesses. Any &quot;undertaking&quot; is regulated, and this concept embraces &quot;de facto&quot; economic units, or enterprises, regardless of whether they are a single corporation, or a group of multiple companies linked through ownership or contract.

===Cartels===
To violate TFEU article 101, undertakings must then have formed an agreement, developed a &quot;concerted practice&quot;, or, within an association, taken a decision. Like US antitrust, this just means all the same thing; any kind of dealing or contact, or a &quot;meeting of the minds&quot; between parties. Covered therefore is a whole range of behaviour from a strong handshaken, written or verbal agreement to a supplier sending invoices with directions not to export to its retailer who gives &quot;tacit acquiescence&quot; to the conduct. Article 101(1) prohibits,

&quot;All agreements between undertakings, decisions by associations of undertakings and concerted practices which may affect trade between member states and which have as their object or effect the prevention, restriction or distortion of competition within the common market.&quot;

This includes both horizontal (e.g. between retailers) and vertical (e.g. between retailers and suppliers) agreements, effectively outlawing the operation of cartels within the EU. Article 101 has been construed very widely to include both informal agreements (gentlemen&#x27;s agreements) and concerted practices where firms tend to raise or lower prices at the same time without having physically agreed to do so. However, a coincidental increase in prices will not in itself prove a concerted practice, there must also be evidence that the parties involved were aware that their behaviour may prejudice the normal operation of the competition within the common market. This latter subjective requirement of knowledge is not, in principle, necessary in respect of agreements. As far as agreements are concerned the mere anticompetitive effect is sufficient to make it illegal even if the parties were unaware of it or did not intend such effect to take place.

===Exemptions===
Exemptions to Article 101 behaviour fall into three categories. Firstly, Article 101(3) creates an exemption for practices beneficial to consumers, e.g., by facilitating technological advances, but without restricting all competition in the area. In practice the Commission gave very few official exemptions and a new system for dealing with them is currently under review. Secondly, the Commission agreed to exempt &#x27;Agreements of minor importance&#x27; (except those fixing sale prices) from Article 101. This exemption applies to small companies, together holding no more than 10% of the relevant market. In this situation as with Article 102 (see below), market definition is a crucial, but often highly difficult, matter to resolve. Thirdly, the commission has also introduced a collection of block exemptions for different contract types. These include a list of contract permitted terms and a list of banned terms in these exemptions.

The Council Regulation n. 139/2004 established antitrust national authorities of EU member States have the competence to judge on undertakings whose economic and financial impact are limited to their respective internal market.

===European enforcement===

The task of tracking down and punishing those in breach of competition law has been entrusted to the European Commission, which receives its powers under Article 105 TFEU. Under this Article, the European Commission is charged with the duty of ensuring the application of Articles 101 and 102 TFEU and of investigating suspected infringements of these Articles. The European Commission and national competition authorities have wide on-site investigation powers. Article 105 TFEU grants extensive investigative powers including the notorious power to carry out dawn raids on the premises of suspected undertakings and private homes and vehicles.

There are many ways in which the European Commission could become aware of a potential violation: the Commission may carry out an investigation or an inspection, for which it is empowered to request information from governments, competent authorities of Member States, and undertakings. The commission also provides a &quot;leniency policy&quot;, under which companies that whistle blow over the anti-competition policies of cartels are treated leniently and may obtain either total immunity or a reduction in fines. In some cases, parties have sought to resist the taking of certain documents during an inspection based on the argument that those documents are covered by legal professional privilege between lawyer and client. The ECJ held that such a privilege was recognised by EC law to a limited extent at least. The Commission also could become aware of a potential competition violation through the complaint from an aggrieved party. In addition, Member States and any natural or legal person are entitled to make a complaint if they have a legitimate interest.

Article 101 (2) TFEU considers any undertaking found in breach of Article 101 TFEU to be null and void and that agreements cannot be legally enforced. In addition, the European Commission may impose a fine pursuant to Article 23 of Regulation 1/2003. These fines are not fixed and can extend into millions of Euros, up to a maximum of 10% of the total worldwide turnover of each of the undertakings participating in the infringement, although there may be a decrease in case of cooperation and increase in case of recidivism. Fines of up to 5% of the average daily turnover may also be levied for every day an undertaking fails to comply with Commission requirements. The gravity and duration of the infringement are to be taken into account in determining the amount of the fine. This uncertainty acts as a powerful deterrent and ensures that companies are unable to undertake a cost/benefit analysis before breaching competition law.
The Commission guideline on the method of setting fines imposed pursuant to Article 23 (2) (a) of Regulation 1/2003 uses a two-step methodology:

* The Commission first defines a basic amount of the fine for each involved undertaking or association of undertakings; and then
* Adjusts the basic amount according to the individual circumstances upwards or downwards.

The basic amount relates, inter alia, to the proportion of the value of the sales depending on the degree of the gravity of the infringement. In this regard, Article 5 of the aforementioned guideline states, that
:&quot;To achieve these objectives, it is appropriate for the Commission to refer to the value of the sales of goods or services to which the infringement relates as a basis for setting the fine. The duration of the infringement should also play a significant role in the setting of the fine. It necessarily affects the potential consequences of the infringements on the market. It is therefore considered important that the fine should also reflect the number of years during which an undertaking participated in the infringement.&quot;

In a second step, this basic amount may be adjusted on grounds of recidivism or leniency. In the latter case, immunity from fines may be granted to the company who submits evidence first to the European Commission which enables it to carry out an investigation and/or to find an infringement of Article 101 TFEU.

The highest cartel fine which was ever imposed in a single case was related to a cartel consisting of five truck manufacturers. The companies MAN, Volvo/Renault, Daimler, Iveco, and DAF were fined approximately €2.93 billion (not adjusted for Court judgments). Between 1997 and 2011 i.e. over a period of 14 years, those companies colluded on truck pricing and on passing on the costs of compliance with stricter emission rules. In this case, MAN was not fined as it revealed the existence of the cartel to the commission (see note regarding leniency below). All companies acknowledged their involvement and agreed to settle the case.

Another negative consequence for the companies involved in cartel cases may be the adverse publicity which may damage the company&#x27;s reputation.

Questions of reform have circulated around whether to introduce US style treble damages as an added deterrent against competition law violaters. The 2003 &quot;Modernisation Regulation&quot; (Regulation 1/2003) has meant that the European Commission no longer has a monopoly on enforcement, and that private parties may bring suits in national courts. Hence, there has been debate over the legitimacy of private damages actions in traditions that shy from imposing punitive measures in civil actions.

According to the Court of Justice of the European Union, any citizen or business who suffers harm as a result of a breach of the European Union competition rules (Articles 101 and 102 TFEU) should be able to obtain reparation from the party who caused the harm. However, despite this requirement under European law to establish an effective legal framework enabling victims to exercise their right to compensation, victims of European Union competition law infringements to date very often do not obtain reparation for the harm suffered. The amount of compensation that these victims are foregoing is in the range of several billion Euros a year. Therefore, the European Commission has taken a number steps since 2004 to stimulate the debate on that topic and elicit feedback from stakeholders on a number of possible options which could facilitate antitrust damages actions. Based on a Green Paper issued by the Commission in 2005, and the outcomes of several public consultations, the Commission suggested specific policy choices and measures in a White Paper published on 3 April 2008.

In 2014, the European Parliament and European Council issued a joint directive on &#x27;certain rules governing actions for damages under national law for infringements of the competition law provisions of the Members States and of the European Union&#x27;.

Many favour ever more uniformity in the interpretation and application of EU competition norms and the procedures to enforce them under this system. However, when there are such differences in many Member States&#x27; policy preferences and given the benefits of experimentation, in 2020 one might ask whether more diversity (within limits) might not produce a more efficient, effective and legitimate competition regime.

;Sector inquiry
A special instrument of the European Commission is the so-called sector inquiry in accordance with Art. 17 of Regulation 1/2003.
Article 17 (1) first paragraph of Council Regulation 1/2003 reads:
:&quot;Where the trend of trade between Member States, the rigidity of prices or other circumstances suggest that competition may be restricted or distorted within the common market, the Commission may conduct its inquiry into a particular sector of the economy or into a particular type of agreements across various sectors. In the course of that inquiry, the Commission may request the undertakings or associations of undertakings concerned to supply information necessary for giving effect to Articles 81 and 82 of the Treaty (now Art. 101 and 102 TFEU) and may carry out any inspections necessary for that purpose.&quot;

In case of sector inquiries, the European Commission follows its reasonable suspicion that the competition in a particular industry sector or solely related to a certain type of contract which is used in various industry sectors is prevented, restricted or distorted within the common market. Thus, in this case not a specific violation is investigated. Nevertheless, the European Commission has almost all avenues of investigation at its disposal, which it may use to investigate and track down violations of competition law. The European Commission may decide to start a sector inquiry when a market does not seem to be working as well as it should. This might be suggested by evidence such as limited trade between Member States, lack of new entrants on the market, the rigidity of prices, or other circumstances suggest that competition may be restricted or distorted within the common market. In the course of the inquiry, the Commission may request that firms – undertakings or associations of undertakings – concerned supply information (for example, price information). This information is used by the European Commission to assess whether it needs to open specific investigations into intervene to ensure the respect of EU rules on restrictive agreements and abuse of dominant position (Articles 101 and 102 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union).

There has been an increased use of this tool in the recent years, as it is not possible any more for companies to register a cartel or agreement which might be in breach of competition law with the European Commission, but the companies are responsible themselves for assessing whether their agreements constitute a violation of European Union Competition Law (self assessment).

Traditionally, agreements had, subject to certain exceptions, to be notified to the European Commission, and the commission had a monopoly over the application of Article 101 TFEU (former Article 81 (3) EG). Because the European Commission did not have the resources to deal with all the agreements notified, notification was abolished.
One of the most spectacular sector inquiry was the pharmaceutical sector inquiry which took place in 2008 and 2009 in which the European Commission used dawn raids from the beginning. The European Commission launched a sector inquiry into EU pharmaceuticals markets under the European Competition rules because information relating to innovative and generic medicines suggested that competition may be restricted or distorted. The inquiry related to the period 2000 to 2007 and involved investigation of a sample of 219 medicines. Taking into account that sector inquiries are a tool under European Competition law, the inquiry&#x27;s main focus was company behaviour. The inquiry therefore concentrated on those practices which companies may use to block or delay generic competition as well as to block or delay the development of competing originator drugs.

The following sectors have also been subject of a sector inquiry:

* Financial Services
* Energy
* Local Loop
* Leased Lines
* Roaming
* Media

;Leniency policy
The leniency policy consists in abstaining from prosecuting firms that, being party to a cartel, inform the Commission of its existence. The leniency policy was first applied in 2002.

The &quot;Commission Notice on Immunity from fines and reduction of fines in cartel cases&quot; (2006) guarantees immunity and penalty reductions to firms who co-operate with the Commission in detecting cartels.

II.A, §8:The Commission will &quot;grant immunity&quot; from any fine which would otherwise have been imposed to an &quot;undertaking disclosing its participation in an alleged cartel&quot; affecting the Community if that undertaking is the first to submit information and evidence which in the Commission&#x27;s view will enable it to:
(a) carry out a targeted inspection in connection with the alleged cartel; or
(b) find an infringement of Article 81 EC in connection with the alleged cartel.

The mechanism is straightforward. The first firm to acknowledge their crime and inform the commission will receive complete immunity, that is, no fine will be applied. Co-operation with the commission will also be gratified with reductions in the fines, in the following way:
*The first firm to denounce existence of a cartel receives immunity from prosecution.
*The first firm to provide information offering &quot;significant added value&quot;, if not covered by immunity, will be offered a 30-50% reduction in fines.
*A second firm offering &quot;significant added value&quot; can see a 20-30% reduction in fines
*Subsequent firms, where they can also provide &quot;significant added value&quot;, can also access reductions up to 20%.

This policy has been of great success as it has increased cartel detection to such an extent that nowadays most cartel investigations are started according to the leniency policy. The purpose of a sliding scale in fine reductions is to encourage a &quot;race to confess&quot; among cartel members. In cross border or international investigations, cartel members are often at pains to inform not only the EU Commission, but also National Competition Authorities (e.g. the Office of Fair Trading and the &quot;Bundeskartellamt&quot;) and authorities across the globe.

===National authorities===
;United Kingdom

Following the introduction of the Enterprise Act 2002 the Office of Fair Trading was responsible for enforcing competition law (enshrined in The Competition Act 1998) in the UK. These powers are shared with concurrent sectoral regulators such as Ofgem in energy, Ofcom in telecoms, the ORR in rail and Ofwat in water. The OFT was replaced by the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), established on 1 April 2014, combining many of the functions of the OFT and the Competition Commission (CC). Following the United Kingdom&#x27;s exit from the European Union, the CMA is no longer a relevant national competition authority (NCA).

;France

The &quot;Autorité de la concurrence&quot;
 is France&#x27;s national competition regulator. Its predecessor was established in the 1950s. Today it administers competition law in France, and is one of the leading national competition authorities in Europe.

;Germany
The &quot;Bundeskartellamt&quot;,
 or Federal Cartel Office, is Germany&#x27;s national competition regulator. It was first established in 1958 and comes under the authority of the Federal Ministry of the Economy and Technology. Its headquarters are in the former West German capital, Bonn and its president is Andreas Mundt, who has a staff of 300 people. Today it administers competition law in Germany, and is one of the leading national competition authorities in Europe.

;Italy

The &quot;Autorità Garante della Concorrenza e del Mercato&quot; in Italy was established in 1990.

;Poland

The Office of Competition and Consumer Protection (UOKiK) was established in 1990 as the Antimonopoly Office. In 1989, on the verge of a political breakthrough, when the economy was based on the free market mechanisms, an Act on counteracting monopolistic practices was passed on 24 February 1990. It constituted an important element of the market reform programme. The structure of the economy, inherited from the central planning system, was characterised with a high level of monopolisation, which could significantly limit the success of the economic transformation. In this situation, promotion of competition and counteracting the anti-market behaviours of the monopolists was especially significant. Therefore, the Antimonopoly Office – AO (Urząd Antymonopolowy – UA) was appointed under this act, and commenced its operation in May once the Council of Ministers passed the charter. Also its first regional offices commenced operations in that very same year.

Right now the Office works under the name Office of Competition and Consumer Protection and bases its activities on the newly enacted Act on the Protection of Competition and Consumers from 2007.

Romania

The Romanian Competition Authority (Consiliul Concurenței) has been functioning since 1996 on the basis of Law no. 21/1996. Its powers and, in general, Romanian competition law are closely modeled after the commission – DG Comp and EU competition law.

In addition to the above, the Romanian Competition Authority also has competences with respect to unloyal commercial practices (Law no. 11/1991).

Within the Romanian Competition Authority, there also are since 2011 the Railway National Council (Consiliul Naţional de Supraveghere din Domeniul Feroviar) and since 2017 the Naval Council (Consiliul de Supraveghere din Domeniul Naval) These two structures have exclusively supervisory and regulatory functions.

Finally, it must be said that the Romanian Competition Authority has no competences in the field of consumer protection.

Recent developments

A 2017 study established that in its 20 years of functioning (1996–2016), the impact of the Romanian Competition Authority was of at least 1 billion euros in savings for consumers. In addition, the Authority applied fines of 574 million euros and had a total budget of 158,8 million euros.

The actions of the Romanian Competition Authority in 2017 lead to savings for consumers ranging between 284 and 509 million lei (approximately between EUR 63 and 113 million), while in 2018 the values were similar, between 217 and 514 million lei, according to estimations using a methodology developed by the European Commission.

Romania has moved up in the rankings of the Global Competition Review since 2017 and won 3 stars, along with seven other EU countries (Austria, Finland, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Portugal, Sweden).

According to Global Trend Monitor 2018 (published on PaRR-global.com), Romania is one of the most competitive jurisdictions between countries in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, ranked 10th in this top (after moving up 4 positions compared to the previous year).

The Romanian Competition Authority is currently in the process of implementing a Big Data platform (expected to be finalised in 2020). The Big Data platform would give the Authority significant resources with regards to (i) bid rigging cases; (ii) cartel screening; (iii) Structural and commercial connections between undertakings; (iv) sectorial inquiries; (v) mergers.

===International cooperation===
Chapter 5 of the post war Havana Charter contained an Antitrust code but this was never incorporated into the WTO&#x27;s forerunner, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1947. Office of Fair Trading Director and Professor Richard Whish wrote sceptically that it &quot;seems unlikely at the current stage of its development that the WTO will metamorphose into a global competition authority.&quot; Despite that, at the ongoing Doha round of trade talks for the World Trade Organization, discussion includes the prospect of competition law enforcement moving up to a global level. While it is incapable of enforcement itself, the newly established International Competition Network (ICN) is a way for national authorities to coordinate their own enforcement activities.

==State policy==

===Public services===

Article 106(2) of the TFEU states that nothing in the rules can be used to obstruct a member state&#x27;s right to deliver public services, but that otherwise public enterprises must play by the same rules on collusion and abuse of dominance as everyone else.

Services of general economic interest is more technical term for what are commonly called public services. The settlement under the European Treaties was meant to preserve Europe&#x27;s social character and institutions. Article 86 refers first of all to &quot;undertakings&quot;, which has been defined to restrict the scope of competition law&#x27;s application. In &quot;Cisal&quot; a managing director challenged the state&#x27;s compulsory workplace accident and disease insurance scheme. This was run by a body known as &quot;INAIL&quot;. The ECJ held that the competition laws in this instance were not applicable. &quot;Undertaking&quot; was a term that should be reserved for entities that carried on some kind of economic activity. &quot;INAIL&quot; operated according to the principle of , because for example, contributions from high paid workers subsidise the low paid workers. Their activities therefore fall outside competition law&#x27;s scope.

The substance of Article 106(2) also makes clear that competition law will be applied generally, but not where public services being provided might be obstructed. An example is shown in the ‘&#x27;Ambulanz Gloeckner&#x27;’ case. In Rheinland Pfalz, Germany, ambulances were provided exclusively by a company that also had the right to provide some non-emergency transport. The rationale was that ambulances were not profitable, not the other transport forms were, so the company was allowed to set profits of one sector off to the other, the alternative being higher taxation. The ECJ held that this was legitimate, clarifying that,

&quot;the extension of the medical aid organisations&#x27; exclusive rights to the non-emergency transport sector does indeed enable them to discharge their general-interest task of providing emergency transport in conditions of economic equilibrium. The possibility that would be open to private operators to concentrate, in the non-emergency sector, on more profitable journeys could affect the degree of economic viability of the service provided and, consequently, jeopardise the quality and reliability of that service.&quot;

The ECJ did however insist that demand on the &quot;subsidising&quot; market must be met by the state&#x27;s regime. In other words, the state is always under a duty to ensure efficient service. Political concern for the maintenance of a social European economy was expressed during the drafting of the Treaty of Amsterdam, where a new Article 16 was inserted. This affirms, &quot;the place occupied by services of general economic interest in the shared values of the Union as well as their role in promoting social and territorial cohesion.&quot; The ongoing debate is at what point the delicate line between the market and public services ought to be drawn.

EU Member states must not allow or assist businesses (&quot;undertakings&quot; in EU jargon) to infringe European Union competition law. As the European Union is made up of independent member states, both competition policy and the creation of the European single market could be rendered ineffective were member states free to support national companies as they saw fit. A 2013 Civitas report lists some of the artifices used by participants to skirt the state aid rules on procurement.

Companies affected by article 106 may be state owned or privately owned companies which are given special rights such as near or total monopoly to provide a certain service. The leading case in 1991, &quot;Régie des Télegraphes et des Téléphones v GB-Inno-BM&quot;, which involved a small telephone equipment maker, GB and the Belgian state telephone provider, RTT, which had the exclusive power to grant approved phones to connect to the telephone network. GB was selling its phones, which were unapproved by RTT, and at lower prices than RTT sold theirs. RTT sued them, demanding that GB inform customers that their phones were unapproved. GB argued that the special rights enjoyed by RTT under Belgian law infringed Article 86, and the case went to the European Court of Justice (ECJ). The ECJ held that,

&quot;To entrust to an undertaking which markets telephone equipment the task of drawing up specifications for such equipment, of monitoring their application and granting type-approval in respect thereof is tantamount to conferring on it the power to determine at will which equipment can be connected to the public network and thus gives it an obvious advantage over its competitors which is inimical to the equality of chances of traders, without which the existence of an undistorted system of competition cannot be guaranteed. Such a restriction on competition cannot be regarded as justified by a public service of general economic interest...&quot;

The ECJ recommended that the Belgian government have an independent body to approve phone specifications, because it was wrong to have the state company both making phones and setting standards. RTT&#x27;s market was opened to competition. An interesting aspect of the case was that the ECJ interpreted the effect of RTT&#x27;s exclusive power as an &quot;abuse&quot; of its dominant position, so no abusive &quot;action&quot; as such by RTT needed to take place. The issue was further considered in &quot;Albany International&quot; Albany was a textile company, which found a cheap pension provider for its employees. It refused to pay contributions to the &quot;Textile Trade Industry Fund&quot;, which the state had given the exclusive right to. Albany argued that the scheme was contrary to EU Competition law. The ECJ ruled that the scheme infringed then Article 86(1), as &quot;undertakings are unable to entrust the management of such a pension scheme to a single insurer and the resulting restriction of competition derives directly from the exclusive right conferred on the sectoral pension fund.&quot; But the scheme was justified under then Article 86(2), being a service of general economic interest.

===Procurement===
===State aid===

Article 107 TFEU, similar to Article 101 TFEU, lays down a general rule that the state may not aid or subsidise private parties in distortion of free competition, but has the power to approve exceptions for specific projects addressing natural disasters or regional development. The general definition of State Aid is set out in Article 107(1) of the TFEU. Measures which fall within the definition of State Aid are unlawful unless provided under an exemption or notified.

For there to be State Aid under Article 107(1) of the TFEU each of the following must be present:
* There is the transfer of Member State resources;
* Which creates a selective advantage for one or more business undertakings;
* That has the potential to distort trade between in the relevant business market; and
* Affects trade between the Member States.

Where all of these criteria are met, State Aid is present and the support shall be unlawful unless provided under a European Commission exemption. The European Commission applies a number of exemptions which enable aid to be lawful. The European Commission will also approve State Aid cases under the notification procedure. A report by the European Defense Agency deals with challenges to a &quot;Level Playing Field for European Defence Industries: the Role of Ownership and Public Aid Practices&quot;

State Aid law is an important issue for all public sector organisations and recipients of public sector support in the European Union because unlawful aid can be clawed back with compound interest.

There is some scepticism about the effectiveness of competition law in achieving economic progress and its interference with the provision of public services. France&#x27;s former president Nicolas Sarkozy has called for the reference in the preamble to the Treaty of the European Union to the goal of &quot;free and undistorted competition&quot; to be removed. Though competition law itself would have remained unchanged, other goals of the preamble—which include &quot;full employment&quot; and &quot;social progress&quot;—carry the perception of greater specificity, and as being ends in themselves, while &quot;free competition&quot; is merely a means.

===Liberalisation===

The EU liberalisation programme entails a broadening of sector regulation, and extending competition law to previously state monopolised industries. The EU has also introduced positive integration measures to liberalise the internal market. There has at times been a tension between introduction of competition and the maintenance of universal and high quality service.

In the &quot;Corbeau&quot; case, Mr Corbeau had wanted to operate a rapid delivery service for post, which infringed the Belgian Regie des Postes&#x27; exclusive right to operate all services. The ECJ held the legislation would be contrary to Article 86 where it was excessive and unnecessary to guarantee the provision of services of general economic interest. It pointed out however that the postal regime (as was the case in most countries) allowed the post office to &quot;offset less profitable sectors against the profitable sectors&quot; of post operations. To provide universal service, a restriction of competition could be justified. The court went on to say,

&quot;to authorise individual undertakings to compete with the holder of the exclusive rights in the sectors of their choice corresponding to those rights would make it possible for them to concentrate on the economically profitable operations and to offer more advantageous tariffs than those adopted by the holders of the exclusive rights since, unlike the latter, they are not bound for economic reasons to offset losses in the unprofitable sectors against profits in the more profitable sectors.&quot;

This meant a core of economic sectors in postal services could be reserved for financing the state industry. This was followed by the Postal Services Directive 97/67/EC, which required Member States to &quot;ensure that users enjoy the right to a universal service involving the permanent provision of a postal service... at all points in their territory.&quot; This means once a working day deliveries and pick-ups, and that services that could be reserved for state monopolies include &quot;clearance, sorting, transport and delivery of items of domestic correspondence and incoming cross-border correspondence&quot;. For countries that had not liberalised postal services in any measure, the directive contained provisions to gradually open up to competition. It was intended to strike a balance between competition and continued quality service. In the &quot;Deutsche Post&quot; decision the Commission took strong enforcement action. Deutsche Post was accused of predatory pricing in the business parcel delivery sector (i.e. not one of the services &quot;reserved&quot; under the directive) by the private firm UPS. The Commission ordered the structural separation of the normal postal services from business deliveries by Deutsche Post.

==Theory==
Article 101 TFEU&#x27;s goals are unclear. There are two main schools of thought. The predominant view is that only consumer welfare considerations are relevant there. However, a recent book argues that this position is erroneous and that other Member State and European Union public policy goals (such as public health and the environment) should also be considered there. If this argument is correct then it could have a profound effect on the outcome of cases as well as the Modernisation process as a whole.

The theory behind mergers is that transaction costs can be reduced compared to operating on an open market through bilateral contracts. Concentrations can increase economies of scale and scope. However, often firms take advantage of their increase in market power, their increased market share and decreased number of competitors, which can have a knock on effect on the deal that consumers get. Merger control is about predicting what the market might be like, not knowing and making a judgment.

<text>Korela Fortress (; ; ) is a medieval fortress in the town of Priozersk, Leningrad Oblast, Russia.

== Origin ==
The original fortification was built by Karelians but the castle seen today is from medieval times. It was first mentioned in a Novgorodian chronicle of 1143 as &quot;Korela&quot;, and archaeological digs have revealed a layer belonging to the 12th century. Swedish chronicles first reported of the settlement of &quot;Keksholm&quot; in 1294. Until the 16th century, the fortress belonged to the Novgorod Republic, followed by Muscovy. Novgorodians built the current stone bastions and towers in 1364 after a fire had destroyed the original wooden fortress in 1360.

During a Swedish-Novgorodian war in 1314, a small Karelian force re-captured their fortress from the representatives of Novgorod. They invited Swedes to keep it against Novgorod; however, the Novgorodians reconquered the fortress. The fortress was confirmed as belonging to Novgorod in the treaty of Nöteborg of 1323.

== Principality of Korela ==
In the 1330s, the Novgorod Republic gave the castle of Korela (and practically the entire , including the forts of Oreshek and Ladoga), to duke Narimantas of Lithuania. In 1383 Korela, Oreshek and Koporye were inherited by Narimantas&#x27; son, Patrikas, the forefather of the Galitzine princely clan. The following year local burghers lodged a complaint about his administration, and Patrikas was forced to exchange Korela for Ladoga and Russa. Patrikas occupied his lands in Ingria and Karelia at least from 1383 to 1397. In 1408, it is recorded that he settled in Moscow under the protection of Vasili I, together with his younger sons, Georgi and Fyodor, who had grown up in Ingria.

== Swedish rule and administration ==
Soon after their seizure of Korela in 1580, the Swedes rebuilt the fortress following a Western European pattern of bastion fortifications. In the Treaty of Teusina of 1595 Sweden undertook to return Korela to Russia. This was effected in 1597. During the subsequent Ingrian War starting 1610, Gustavus Adolphus restored Swedish control of the castle and the whole area. During the Time of Troubles, Korela was a prize promised by Vasily IV of Russia to Jacob De la Gardie as part of the Swedish De la Gardie Campaign to assist Russia against the Polish-Lithuanian commonwealth. They were incorporated with Sweden as Kexholm County in the Treaty of Stolbovo in 1617. The fortress and the region remained with Sweden until Peter the Great captured the fortress and parts of Kexholm County during the Great Northern War.

== Grand Duchy of Finland ==
After losing the Finnish War in 1809 Sweden ceded its eastern half to Russia and in 1812 Kexholm () was incorporated into Viipuri Province of the Grand Duchy of Finland. 
In the mid-18th century, the fortress was turned into a political prison of Imperial Russia. Some participants of the Decembrist Revolt (1825) were confined there.

== Republic of Finland ==
In early-December 1917 Finland declared independence and Käkisalmi became part of the independent Finland. In 1940, following the Winter War, Käkisalmi and the eastern portion of Finnish Karelia were ceded to the Soviet Union. During the Continuation War in 1941–1944, Finland temporarily gained back Käkisalmi, until the Soviet Union managed to reclaim it. The town was renamed &quot;Priozersk&quot; on October 1, 1948.

== In popular culture ==
In October 1996, the opening scene of the film &quot;Brother&quot; was filmed outside the walls of the fortress. In the scene, the protagonist, Danila Bagrov, walks onto a filming set for a Nautilus Pompilius music video.

<text>&quot;A Saucerful of Secrets&quot; is a multi-part instrumental composition by English rock band Pink Floyd from their 1968 album of the same name. It is nearly 12 minutes long and was composed by Roger Waters, Richard Wright, Nick Mason and David Gilmour. The track features guitar feedback, a percussion solo section and wordless vocals.

==Background==
&quot;A Saucerful of Secrets&quot; was titled &quot;The Massed Gadgets of Hercules&quot; in its earliest performance and became a Pink Floyd live staple from 1968 to 1972. A live version of the track is available on their 1969 double album &quot;Ummagumma&quot;, and an alternative version is seen and heard in the film &quot;Pink Floyd: Live at Pompeii&quot;, which was performed at director Adrian Maben&#x27;s request, as he thought it would be a good addition to the film.

The track was composed by Roger Waters drawing diagrams on a piece of paper explaining how the music should progress. Gilmour later said he initially wasn&#x27;t sure what to play.

Live performances of the song differed significantly from the studio version. The closely miked cymbal sound that starts the piece was instead performed as a two-note drone on the bass. For the &quot;Syncopated Pandemonium&quot; section, Richard Wright usually played his Farfisa organ instead of pounding the keys on a grand piano with his fists as on the studio recording (the version on &quot;Pompeii&quot; being an exception) and Roger would smash on a gong. The &quot;Celestial Voices&quot; section started with just organ as per the studio version, but the band gradually added drums, bass, guitar, and wordless vocals provided by David Gilmour.

The Japanese release of this song was simply titled , which translates as &quot;Mystery&quot;. The album &quot;A Saucerful of Secrets&quot; itself also carried this title.

The song was Gilmour&#x27;s first songwriting credit with Pink Floyd. On the original vinyl and early CD issues, his name was misspelled as &quot;Gilmore&quot;. This was corrected with the remastered version released in 1994.

==Structure==
Although the song is listed on all pressings of the album as &quot;A Saucerful of Secrets&quot;, some pressings of &quot;Ummagumma&quot; break the piece into four different sections. The first part, &quot;Something Else&quot;, was logged as &quot;Richard&#x27;s Rave Up&quot; when the song was recorded at EMI Studios. The second part was recorded as &quot;Nick&#x27;s Boogie&quot; before being retitled as &quot;Syncopated Pandemonium&quot;, while the last part is titled &quot;Celestial Voices&quot;. Roger Waters once stated in a &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; interview that the song was about a battle and the aftermath. &quot;Something Else&quot; represents the setup of the battle. &quot;Syncopated Pandemonium&quot; represents the actual battle. &quot;Storm Signal&quot; represents the view of the dead after the battle has ended, and &quot;Celestial Voices&quot; represents the mourning of the dead.

#&quot;Something Else&quot; (0:00–3:57, slow closely miked cymbal fade-in and echoing organ, slide guitar, bass, chimes, piano, vibraphone)
#&quot;Syncopated Pandemonium&quot; (3:57–7:04, drum tape loop, cymbals, distorted guitars, piano)
#&quot;Storm Signal&quot; (7:04–8:38, floor tom, chimes, and organ) in the form of a passacaglia over a 16-bar bass line, continuing into the fourth section until the end of the piece
#&quot;Celestial Voices&quot; (8:38–11:52, bass, organ, piano, chimes, mellotron and wordless chorus)

==Live performances==
*Pink Floyd performed the instrumental in 1968–72, with the last performance taking place on 23 September 1972 at the Winterland Auditorium, San Francisco, California. It was regularly performed as an encore throughout that year. Nick Mason and Wright briefly considered resurrecting the instrumental for the 1987 Momentary Lapse of Reason tour, but Gilmour suggested that it sounded too archaic.
*In the version found on &quot;Live at Pompeii: Directors Cut&quot;, Mason&#x27;s drumming is much faster and also featured in the last two sections. Gilmour sings for only the last chord progression, instead of for the last two.
*The &quot;Ummagumma&quot; live version is only slightly longer than the studio version at 12:48, and is less freeform noise than its studio counterpart.
*Live performances of the instrumental initially had a length of about 12–13 minutes, but later performances commonly ran for about 17–20 minutes.
*&quot;Syncopated Pandemonium&quot;, the second part of the track, was one of the many tracks which were played at some point or another as &quot;Doing It&quot; (part of the conceptual concert &quot;The Man and The Journey&quot;, the focus of their 1969 tour). Others include &quot;The Grand Vizier&#x27;s Garden Party (Entertainment)&quot;, &quot;Up the Khyber&quot;, &quot;Party Sequence&quot;. All of these prominently feature drums.
*The &quot;Celestial Voices&quot; section was used as the finale to &quot;The Man and the Journey&quot; concept suite, renamed to &quot;The End of the Beginning&quot;. At a performance of the suite on 26 June 1969 at the Royal Albert Hall, Pink Floyd were joined by a full brass band and choir for the piece. Rick Wright played the Royal Albert Hall pipe organ and the work ended with a very loud recorded explosion. 
* &quot;A Saucerful of Secrets&quot; has been performed by Nick Mason&#x27;s Saucerful of Secrets since 2018.

==Personnel==
*David Gilmour – slide guitar, vocals
*Richard Wright – Farfisa organ, Hammond organ, Mellotron, piano, vibraphone, vocals
*Roger Waters – bass guitar, cymbals, vocals
*Nick Mason – drums, chimes

==Cultural references==
* The album &quot;The Dark Side of the Moog II&quot; (1994) by Klaus Schulze and Pete Namlook is subtitled &quot;A Saucerful of Ambience&quot;.

<text>Priozersk (; ; ) is a town and the administrative center of Priozersky District in Leningrad Oblast, Russia, located at the northwestern shore of Lake Ladoga, at the estuary of the northern armlet of the Vuoksi River on the Karelian Isthmus. It is served by a station of the same name on the St. Petersburg—Khiytola railway. Population: 

==History==

The main landmark of Priozersk, the Korela Fortress, has historically been the center for the Karelians of the Karelian Isthmus and from time to time the northwestern outpost of the realm of the Russians or the eastern outpost of the realm of the Swedes.

From the Middle Ages, Priozersk was known as Korela to Russians and Käkisalmi to Karelians and Finns. The town was a part of Vodskaya pyatina of the Novgorod Republic. Novgorod taxation documents from 1500 list 183 houses in Korela, suggesting an estimated population of 1,500–2,000. The Swedes captured Korela twice: in 1578 for seventeen years and in 1611 for a hundred years. In the Swedish Empire, the fortress was called Kexholm and the whole region became known as the County of Kexholm. Russia definitively secured the area during the Great Northern War; the town&#x27;s Swedish name was retained, however, as Keksgolm (). Unfortunately, wars and devastating fires in 1300, 1580, 1634, and 1679 took their toll on the civilian population. Consequently, when the town gained its first court house in 1800, the population was only 400.

In 1812, as the Grand Duchy of Finland three years earlier had been formed within the Russian Empire, Tsar Alexander I incorporated Keksgolm with the rest of Old Finland (Vyborg Governorate) into an autonomous region. Keksgolm was the smallest city in the governorate. Since 1812, Vyborg Governorate was known as the Viipuri Province. In 1917, Finland became independent. The town&#x27;s growth was boosted by the construction of the St. Petersburg–Hiitola railway in 1917 and by establishing two big saw mills and a big Ab Waldhof Oy&#x27;s wood pulp mill in 1929. In 1939, Käkisalmi had a population of 5083. Around the town laid the rural municipality of Käkisalmi, with a population of 5,100. Minorities were Orthodox (946 persons), Swedish, Russian, or German. Total population was 11,129 in 1939.

The Winter War on November 30, 1939 began with the Soviet attack. Eventually, after hard fighting, Finland was forced to cede Käkisalmi and the eastern portion of Finnish Karelia to the Soviet Union by the terms of the 1940 Moscow Peace Treaty. During the Continuation War in 1941–1944, Finland gained back Keksgolm and other territories ceded to the Soviets in 1940. The population returned to rebuild the town, but were again evacuated at the close of World War II.

Keksgolmsky District with the administrative center in Keksgolm was established as a part of the Karelian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic (Karelian ASSR) in March 1940. On March 31, 1940, the Karelian ASSR was transformed into the Karelo-Finnish Soviet Socialist Republic. On November 24, 1944, Keksgolmsky District was transferred from the Karelo-Finnish Soviet Socialist Republic to Leningrad Oblast.

On October 1, 1948, Keksgolm was renamed Priozersk as a part of the campaign to rename localities in the areas annexed from Finland after the Second World War. Priozersk was settled with mainly Russians, Belarusian, and Ukrainian migrants, who have since comprised the majority of the local population.

==Administrative and municipal status==
Within the framework of administrative divisions, Priozersk serves as the administrative center of Priozersky District. As an administrative division, it is, together with three rural localities, incorporated within Priozersky District as Priozerskoye Settlement Municipal Formation. As a municipal division, Priozerskoye Settlement Municipal Formation is incorporated within Priozersky Municipal District as Priozerskoye Urban Settlement.

==Economy==
===Industry===
The main industrial enterprise in Priozersk is the former paper mill transformed into a furniture production plant.

===Transportation===
Priozersk railway station is located on the Saint Petersburg – Hiitola railroad connecting Saint Petersburg and Sortavala via Hiitola. There is suburban (about 3 hours), express (about 2 hours) and long-distance service to Finland Station in Saint Petersburg.

The town is connected by roads with Saint Petersburg, Vyborg, and Sortavala.

==Culture and recreation==

Some remains of the pre-1917 Russian culture, mainly the Korela Fortress, survive. The ramparts and towers of the fortress are located on the bank of the Vuoksi, still visible when traveling to the town from St. Petersburg. There is a small museum in the fortress. Much of the remnants of the Finnish presence was destroyed. Priozersk contains thirty-three cultural heritage monuments of federal significance. The great majority of these monuments belong to the Korela fortress.

The town is popular destination with the residents of St. Petersburg, many of whom have dachas in the vicinity (such as the &quot;Ozero&quot; community).

<text>The eastern yellow robin (Eopsaltria australis) is an Australasian robin of coastal and sub-coastal eastern Australia. The extent of the eastern yellow robin&#x27;s residence is from the extreme southeast corner of South Australia through most of Victoria and the western half of New South Wales and north as far as Cooktown. Tropical Northern Queensland birds are mainly restricted to the warm heights of the Great Dividing Range.

==Taxonomy==
The eastern yellow robin was first described by ornithologist George Shaw in 1790. Two subspecies are recognised: the northern yellow robin (subsp. &quot;chrysorrhoa&quot;) and the nominate or eastern (subsp. &quot;australis&quot;). The former was previously regarded as a separate species.

Alternatively, the eastern and western yellow robins were classified as a single species by Julian Ford in 1979 on account of similarities in calls, ecology and behaviour. Playback of one species&#x27; calls in the other&#x27;s territory evoked a response. Bird taxonomist Richard Schodde did not feel that this finding warranted the lumping of the two species, but did conclude that they formed a superspecies. Two analyses of mitochondrial and nuclear DNA of Australasian robins revealed that the divergence between the eastern and western yellow robin was consistent with species-level separation, confirming their status as distinct species.

Like all Australian robins, it is not closely related to either the European robin or the American robin. It belongs to the genus &quot;Eopsaltria&quot;, whose Australian members are known colloquially as &quot;yellow robins&quot;, as distinct from the &quot;red robins&quot; of the genus &quot;Petroica&quot;.

==Description==
At 15 to 16 cm (6 in) in length, the eastern yellow robin is one of the larger Australasian robins, and one of the most easily observed. Pairs and small family parties establish a territory—sometimes year-round, sometimes for a season—and seem little disturbed by human presence. They appear not to migrate any great distance, but will make local movements with the seasons, particularly to higher and lower ground.

==Distribution and habitat==
The eastern yellow robin occupies a wide range of habitats: heaths, mallee, acacia scrub, woodlands, and sclerophyll forests, but is most often found in damper places or near water. Like all Australian robins, the eastern yellow robin tends to inhabit fairly dark, shaded locations, and is a perch and pounce hunter, typically from a tree trunk, wire, or low branch. Its diet includes a wide range of small creatures, mostly insects. Breeding takes place in the spring and, as with many Australian birds, is often communal. The nest is a neat cup made of fine plant material and spider web, usually placed in a fork, and expertly disguised with lichen, moss, bark, or leaves.

<text>Bona Sforza (2 February 1494 – 19 November 1557) was Queen of Poland and Grand Duchess of Lithuania as the second wife of Sigismund the Old, and Duchess of Bari and Rossano by her own right. She was a surviving member of the powerful House of Sforza, which had ruled the Duchy of Milan since 1450.

Smart, energetic and ambitious, Bona became heavily involved in the political and cultural life of the Polish–Lithuanian union. To increase state revenue during the Chicken War, she implemented various economic and agricultural reforms, including the far-reaching Wallach Reform in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. In foreign policy, she allied with the Ottoman Empire and sometimes opposed the Habsburgs. Her descendants became beneficiaries of the Neapolitan sums, a loan to Philip II of Spain that was never completely paid.

==Childhood==
Bona was born on 2 February 1494, in Vigevano, Milan, as the third of the four children of Gian Galeazzo Sforza, the legal heir to the Duchy of Milan, and Isabella of Naples, daughter of King Alfonso II of Naples from the House of Trastámara. Her paternal great-uncle Ludovico Sforza, known to history as &quot;Il Moro&quot;, usurped her father&#x27;s power and sent the small family to live at the Castello Visconteo in Pavia, where her father died the same year she was born. Rumors spread that he was poisoned by Ludovico.

Bona&#x27;s family moved to the Sforza Castle in Milan, where they lived under the watchful eye of Ludovico, who was afraid that Milan residents would rebel and install her popular brother Francesco. To minimize the risk, Ludovico separated the boy from the family and granted Bari and Rossano to her mother. The plans were interrupted by the Italian War of 1499–1504. King Louis XII of France deposed Ludovico and took Francesco to Paris. With nothing left in Milan, her remaining family departed for Naples in February 1500. However, the war reached the Kingdom of Naples and her maternal great-uncle, King Frederick of Naples, was deposed. Together with other relatives, Bona was temporarily hidden at the Aragonese Castle on Ischia.

By April 1502, Bona was the only surviving of her siblings. She and her mother settled at the Castello Normanno-Svevo in Bari more permanently, where Bona started an excellent education. Her teachers included Italian humanists Crisostomo Colonna and Antonio de Ferraris, who taught her mathematics, natural science, geography, history, law, Latin, classical literature, theology, and how to play several musical instruments.

==Marriage proposals==

When the House of Sforza was restored to the Duchy of Milan in 1512, Isabella hoped to wed Bona and Duke Maximilian Sforza, thereby providing further legitimacy to Maximilian&#x27;s reign. There were other proposals as well: Spanish King Ferdinand II of Aragon proposed Giuliano de&#x27; Medici, brother of Pope Leo X. Isabella counter-proposed Ferdinand&#x27;s 10-years-old grandson Ferdinand of Austria; Pope Leo X proposed Philippe, Duke of Nemours, who would succeed to the Duchy of Savoy if his brother Charles III abdicated. The initial and most likely plan to marry Maximilian Sforza failed after he was deposed after the French victory in the Battle of Marignano in 1515. Pope Leo X proposed his nephew Lorenzo de&#x27; Medici, Duke of Urbino, as he hoped to install Lorenzo as Duke of Milan by using Bona&#x27;s inheritance claims. However, the French hold on Milan was too strong and the plan failed.

After Polish King Sigismund I the Old was widowed in October 1515, Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor, did not want Sigismund to marry another Habsburg opponent like his late wife, Barbara Zápolya. Therefore, the Emperor acted quickly and selected three suitable candidates for Sigismund: his granddaughter Eleanor of Austria, widowed Queen Joanna of Castile, and Bona Sforza. Although 36-year-old Joanna was eliminated because of her age, and Eleanor&#x27;s older brother instead selected King Manuel I of Portugal for her husband, Polish nobles suggested Anna Radziwiłł, the widow of Konrad III of Masovia. Isabella sent Bona&#x27;s old teacher, Crisostomo Colonna, and diplomat Sigismund von Herberstein to Vilnius to convince Sigismund to select Bona. They succeeded and the marriage treaty was signed in September 1517 in Vienna. Bona&#x27;s dowry was very large: 100,000 ducats, personal items worth 50,000 ducats and the Duchy of Bari. In exchange, Sigismund granted his future wife the towns of Nowy Korczyn, Wiślica, Żarnów, Radomsko, Jedlnia, Kozienice, Chęciny, and Inowrocław.

Jan Konarski, Archbishop of Kraków, travelled to Bari to bring Bona to Poland. The wedding &quot;per procura&quot; took place on 6 December 1517 in Naples. Bona wore a dress of light blue Venetian satin that reportedly cost 7,000 ducats. The journey to Poland took more than three months. Bona and Sigismund met for the first time on 15 April 1518 just outside Kraków.

==Queen of Poland and Grand Duchess of Lithuania ==
The wedding and coronation took place on 18 April 1518, but celebrations continued for a week. Almost from the beginning of her life in Poland, the energetic queen tried to gain a strong political position and began forming a circle of supporters. On 23 January 1519, Pope Leo X, whom Bona had friendly relationship with from her Italian days, granted her the privilege of awarding eight benefices in five Polish cathedrals (Kraków, Gniezno, Poznań, Włocławek, and Frombork).

In May 1519, the privilege was expanded to fifteen benefices. This was a very important privilege that allowed her to secure support of various officials. Three of her most trusted supporters, Piotr Kmita Sobieński, Andrzej Krzycki, and Piotr Gamrat, were sometimes known as the Triumvirate. She became openly involved in various state affairs, which did not agree with the traditional ideal of a royal wife to use discreet manipulation in government. Although the royal couple disagreed on many domestic and foreign issues, the marriage was a supportive and successful partnership.

===Domestic policy===

Believing that one of the most important things needed for strengthening royal authority was appropriate revenue, Bona sought to assemble as much dynastic wealth as possible, which would give her husband&#x27;s financial independence to defend the kingdom from external threats without the Parliament&#x27;s slow support. The royal family gained numerous estates in Lithuania and finally took over the Grand Duchy by 1536–1546. She helped to reform agriculture taxation, including uniform duties on the peasants and area measurements. Those actions generated huge profits.

Wanting to ensure the continuity of the Jagiellonian dynasty on the Polish throne, the royal couple decided to make the nobles and magnates to recognise their only son, the minor Sigismund Augustus, as heir to the throne. First, the Lithuanian nobles gave him the ducal throne (ca. 1527–1528). In 1529, he was then crowned Sigismund II Augustus. This led to huge opposition from Polish lords, which led to the adoption of the bill that the next coronation would take place after the death of Sigismund Augustus and only with the consent of all the noble brothers.

In 1539, Bona reluctantly presided over the burning of the 80-year-old Katarzyna Weiglowa for heresy, but that event ushered in an era of tolerance. The Queen&#x27;s confessor, Francesco Lismanini, assisted in the establishment of a Calvinist Academy in Pińczów.

===Foreign policy===
Bona was instrumental in establishing alliances for Poland, but she was rumored to be a notorious conspirator because of her gender and Italian heritage. In addition of her good relationships with the Vatican, she sought to maintain good relations with the Ottoman Empire and had contacts with Hürrem Sultan, chief consort of Suleiman the Magnificent. It is believed that the good relationship between the Queens saved Poland from the attack of the Ottoman Army during the Italian Wars.

Worried about the growing ties between the Habsburgs and Russia by 1524, Sigismund signed a Franco-Polish alliance with King Francis I of France to avoid a possible two-front war. Bona was instrumental in establishing an alliance between Poland and France with the objective of recovering Milan. The negotiations came to an end, and the alliance was disbanded after Francis&#x27; troops were defeated by Charles V at the Battle of Pavia in 1525.

Despite their blood relation, Bona sometimes was a fierce opponent of the Habsburgs. She advocated attaching Silesia to the Polish crown in return for her hereditary principalities of Bari and Rossano, but Sigismund the Old did not fully support this idea. Wanting to secure her eldest daughter in the Kingdom of Hungary, Bona successfully supported her son-in-law John Zápolya as successor against Ferdinand of Habsburg after Louis II of Hungary was killed at Mohács in 1526.

===Artistic patronage===

Alongside her husband&#x27;s profound interest in the revival of classical antiquity, Bona was instrumental in developing the Polish Renaissance. She brought renowned Italian artists, architects and sculptors from her native country. Her most known artistic involvement were the expansion of the Palace of the Grand Dukes of Lithuania in Vilnius and the construction of Ujazdów Castle, which included a large park and a menagerie. The plans were prepared by Bartolomeo Berrecci da Pontassieve, who designed several other projects in Poland.

==Queen Mother==
On the 1 April 1548, Sigismund I the Old died and was succeeded by Sigismund Augustus. The mother and the son had entered into a conflict over his marriage to Barbara Radziwiłł, a former mistress who was vehemently opposed by the nobility, but she eventually accepted her son&#x27;s decision. Still, their relationship turned difficult, and after her husband&#x27;s death, Bona moved with her unmarried daughters to Masovia and stayed there for eight years before moving back to Bari.

===Neapolitan loans and death===
In February 1556, Bona left Poland for her native Italy with treasures that she had accumulated over 38 years. In May, she reached Bari and took possession of her mother&#x27;s duchy. She was soon visited by envoys of King Philip II of Spain, who attempted to convince her to give up the duchies of Bari and Rossano in favour of Habsburg Spain. However, Fernando Álvarez de Toledo, 3rd Duke of Alba, the viceroy of Naples, feared a French attack and raised money for troops. Perhaps having ambitions of becoming a viceroy of Naples herself, Bona agreed to lend the Duke of Alba a huge sum of 430,000 ducats at 10% annual interest. The loan was guaranteed by custom duties collected in Foggia and the agreements were signed on both 23 September and 5 December 1556.

However, the Habsburgs were determined to obtain Bari and did not intend to repay the loan. On 8 November, Bona became ill with stomach ache. On 17 November, as she was losing consciousness, her trusted courtier Gian Lorenzo Pappacoda brought to her the notary Marco Vincenzo de Baldis, who wrote her last will. It left Bari, Rossano, Ostuni and Grottaglie to Philip II of Spain and large sums to Pappacoda&#x27;s family. Her daughters would receive a one-off payment of 50,000 ducats except Isabella Jagiellon, who was to receive 10,000 ducats annually. Her only son, King Sigismund II Augustus, was named as the main beneficiary, but in the end, he would inherit only cash, jewelry, and other personal property. The next day, however, Bona felt better and dictated a new last will to Scipio Catapani that left Bari and other property to Sigismund Augustus.

Bona died in the early morning of 19 November 1557, at the age of 63. It is suspected she was poisoned by trusted household members. She was buried in the Basilica di San Nicola in Bari, where her daughter, Anna, had a tomb erected for her in Renaissance style.

== Physical appearance ==
Bona was considered from her youth a very ugly woman, so much so that the proposal (advanced by Naples) of a marriage between her and the fourteen-year-old Federico Gonzaga was not even taken into consideration by his mother Isabella d&#x27;Este, nor by the archdeacon Alessandro di Gabbioneta, who considered it a sin to sacrifice the flourishing beauty of the young Federico to a &quot;mature and ugly&quot; woman like Bona. The latter, for her part, tried to make her face more graceful through jewelry and fabrics, but with little success, since &quot;little or nothing has graced her.&quot;

== Affairs ==
During her youth in Bari, Bona Sforza took the young Ettore Pignatelli as her lover. He was the eldest son of Alessandro Pignatelli, who, in turn, was the lover of her mother Isabella d&#x27;Aragona, Duchess of Milan. However, Ettore died under mysterious circumstances. It is believed that he was poisoned by Bona after he refused to follow her to Poland, where she intended to marry Sigismund. Widowed by her husband in 1548, Bona became involved in a romantic affair with Giovanni Lorenzo Pappacoda.

==Issue==
Although she did not travel with her husband and spent three years alone in the Wawel castle, Bona was pregnant six times during the first nine years of her marriage. Her children included:
* Isabella (18 January 1519 – 15 September 1559): Married John Zápolya, King of Hungary.
* Sigismund II Augustus (1 August 1520 – 7 July 1572): Succeeded his father as King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania.
* Sophia (13 July 1522 – 28 May 1575): Married Henry V, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg.
* Anna (18 October 1523 – 9 September 1596): Eventually succeeded her brother as Queen of Poland and Grand Duchess of Lithuania in her own right.
* Catherine (1 November 1526 – 16 September 1583): Married John III of Sweden.
* Albert (born and died 20 September 1527): Died at birth after his mother gave birth prematurely.

<doc id="453141" wikidata="Q851798" url="?curid=453141" title="Hybrid (British band)">
<text>Hybrid is a British electronic music duo consisting of Mike and Charlotte Truman. The group was formed in 1995 by Mike Truman, Chris Healings, and Lee Mullin. At the time they were primarily known as a breakbeat collective, although they overlapped considerably with progressive house and trance.

Their 1999 single, &quot;Finished Symphony&quot; was their first charting release; their debut studio album, &quot;Wide Angle&quot;, was released that year to critical acclaim. Hybrid are considered pioneers of the electronic genre, and are known for their cinematic approach to their production, specifically with the use of orchestral recordings. After Mullin left the group their second studio album, &quot;Morning Sci-Fi&quot; (2003), was made with Adam Taylor and featured collaborations with Peter Hook and Kirsty Hawkshaw. In 2006, Truman and Healings released their acclaimed third studio album &quot;I Choose Noise&quot;.

Charlotte Truman (née James) joined as a vocalist shortly afterwards in 2007. Her first recording with Hybrid was &quot;The Formula of Fear&quot; in 2008, the first single from their fourth studio album, &quot;Disappear Here&quot; (2010).

After a hiatus founding member Chris Healings left the group in 2015, and their long-awaited fifth studio album, &quot;Light of the Fearless&quot;, was released in 2018.

During their career they have also produced over one hundred remixes for about forty artists including U2, Moby, Rob Dougan, R.E.M., and The Future Sound of London. The group was formerly based in Swansea, Wales and have relocated to Worcestershire, England.

==History==
===1999–2000: &quot;Wide Angle&quot;===
Hybrid released their debut album, &quot;Wide Angle&quot;, in 1999 – a combination of progressive house and nu skool breaks with vocals and symphonic textures. They hired the Russian Federal Orchestra for the string sections. Julee Cruise supplied many of the vocals for &quot;Wide Angle&quot;. The album was produced and written by the duo along with the third original band member, Lee Mullin. The music&#x27;s cinematic feel and scope have led to comparisons with Massive Attack and Underworld.

The album spawned two singles, &quot;Finished Symphony&quot; and &quot;If I Survive&quot; (featuring Julee Cruise), both of which charted in the UK.

In 2000, Hybrid supported Moby in a live tour through multiple countries. Later that year Hybrid released a double disc edition of Wide Angle titled &quot;Wider Angle&quot;. The second disc (dubbed &quot;Live Angle&quot;) features a live set from the tour that includes previously unreleased tracks such as &quot;Burnin&#x27;&quot; and &quot;Kill City&quot;.

===2002–2004: &quot;Morning Sci-Fi&quot;===
Hybrid released their second album, &quot;Morning Sci-Fi&quot;, in 2003. They added semi-permanent vocalists and guitarists, Adam Taylor and Tim Hutton (both on the album and when performing live) with a guest appearance from New Order alumnus Peter Hook. This album had a generally darker theme than &quot;Wide Angle&quot;, though still retaining the cinematic undertones for which Hybrid are known. In addition to this, &quot;Morning Sci-Fi&quot; features a more diverse range of influences than its predecessor — Chris Healings stating in an interview that,

Three singles were released from &quot;Morning Sci-Fi&quot;. These were &quot;True to Form&quot;, &quot;Higher Than a Skyscraper&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m Still Awake&quot;.

In 2004, Hybrid were invited by noted Hollywood film composer Harry Gregson-Williams to work on the soundtrack for the film &quot;Man on Fire&quot;. The film marked not only Hybrid&#x27;s first foray into film music, but also the duo&#x27;s first collaboration with Harry Gregson-Williams, who continuously invited them to work on the soundtrack for movies like &quot;The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian&quot;, &quot;X-Men Origins: Wolverine&quot; and &quot;Total Recall&quot;. This also marked the first collaboration with the late film director Tony Scott. A collaboration which continued throughout the remainder of his career, until his death in 2012.

===2006–2008: &quot;I Choose Noise&quot;===
In April 2006, Hybrid played at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival on 29 April 2006. Later in the same year Hybrid released their third studio album, &quot;I Choose Noise&quot;. The album featured the return of the epic symphonic sound and grand orchestral scope of &quot;Wide Angle.&quot; It featured Perry Farrell, John Graham (a fellow music producer, going by the name Quivver), Judie Tzuke and Kirsty Hawkshaw. Harry Gregson-Williams also appeared on the album, composing most of the album&#x27;s string sections. Film composer Stephen Barton was involved with the production of the album.

The album spawned three 12&quot; singles due to popular demand shortly after its release: &quot;Dogstar / I Choose Noise&quot;, &quot;Falling Down / Last Man Standing&quot; and &quot;Dreamstalker / Just For Today&quot;. Many of the tracks from the album would later go on to be heavily played by DJs, as well as heavily featured in advertisements. In addition, 2 of the album&#x27;s tracks &quot;Dogstar&quot; and &quot;Dreamstalker&quot; would later be re-recorded with Perry Farrell for his Satellite Party project. The project also featured another re-recording of his song &quot;Orbit,&quot; which was previously unreleased. These recordings were later released on the album &quot;Ultra Payloaded&quot; which was released in 2007.

On 8 March 2007, Hybrid kicked off their US Spring 2007 Live Tour in support of &quot;I Choose Noise&quot;. Hybrid was joined by John Graham, Peter DiStefano, and their new female vocalist, Charlotte James. Later that same year Distinct&#x27;ive Records released a compilation album: &quot;Hybrid Re_Mixed.&quot; It consisted of remixes of several compositions by Hybrid, with remixes by various artists including deadmau5, Jerome Sydenham, The Cinematic Orchestra, and The Orb as well as a rare b-side track named &quot;Sleepwalking&quot;, originally meant for &quot;I Choose Noise&quot;. Despite this however, Hybrid had nothing to do with the release, as it was meant to be their last release with Distinct&#x27;ive. However, despite being managed by Hope Recordings, Hybrid still released their next few releases with Distinct’ive.

In 2007, Hybrid:
* composed their first original soundtrack for the film &quot;Catacombs&quot;. However, Hybrid&#x27;s contributions were never released, despite heavy fan demand
* played in the Lounge and Dance Village at Glastonbury Festival

2008 saw the release of &quot;Soundsystem 01&quot;. The album is a double-disc mix collection with the first CD being based around actual film scores fused with ambient electronica, and the second containing more upfront, club-oriented music represented by remixes of music by the likes of Sasha, Quivver and Elite Force. Later that same year, Hybrid released a new single, entitled &quot;The Formula of Fear&quot;, which featured Charlotte James on the vocals. Hybrid also contributed an original track &quot;Komuru&quot;, to the Survival International charity album, &quot;Songs for Survival&quot;.

===2009–2011: &quot;Disappear Here&quot;===

Besides collaborating with Harry Gregson-Williams 2009 saw Hybrid focusing on the production of their fourth album. The album was originally finished in 2008, however the group described the album as indie rock and as a result, weren&#x27;t satisfied with the album, which led them to restart the production completely. After several months of silence, their fourth album &quot;Disappear Here&quot; was finally finished and released on 29 March 2010. The album was made with Andrew Skeet and the City of Prague Philharmonic Orchestra at Smecky Music Studios. A video recording of the track from the forthcoming album, entitled &quot;Break My Soul&quot;, was also released which was filmed and edited by the band. &quot;Disappear Here&quot; spawned several singles, and also rose to #2 at the iTunes electronic charts. The album was re-released in the same year, entitled &quot;Disappear Here: Widescreen Edition&quot;, which contained special edits, remixes and orchestral versions.

2010 also saw:
* more collaborations with Harry Gregson-Williams. The duo helped finish the score for &quot;Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time&quot;, and yet another Tony Scott production: &quot;Unstoppable.&quot; This would prove to be the last collaboration with Tony Scott, with the director&#x27;s death in 2012.
* Hybrid play at Glastonbury Festival once more.

On 15 March 2011, Hybrid released the song &quot;Blind Side&quot; for free, as promotion for the single, which itself was officially released on 22 August 2011. The single was their first release for their new label Kill City Records. Beyond this, Hybrid spent most of 2011 focusing on film score work. The group submitted two original tracks for the film &quot;Fast Five.&quot; They also helped finish the score for &quot;Cowboys &amp; Aliens&quot; and were working on the original soundtrack for the video game &quot;Tom Clancy&#x27;s Ghost Recon: Future Soldier&quot;, which was released in May 2012.

===2012–2017: &quot;Classics&quot; and Healings&#x27; departure===
August 2012 saw the release of &quot;Classics&quot; out on Distinctive Records. The album was a greatest hits compilation, compiling the biggest hits from Hybrid&#x27;s career. The album was released in a standard one disc edition, as well as a deluxe edition, consisting of 4 discs. The deluxe edition featured many alternative mixes and orchestral versions, as well as unreleased material, including much of the music that was made for advertisement agencies.

In 2013, Hybrid finished working on a few soundtracks. One was for the video game &quot;Driveclub&quot;, where the band composed all of the music in addition to creating a new single for the game, entitled: &quot;Be Here Now&quot;. They also finished work on a direct-to-video film: &quot;Dead in Tombstone&quot;. Their work (unlike for the previous film, &quot;Catacombs&quot;) was released by Back Lot Music on 15 October 2013. In 2014, the band finished a score for the science fiction film Vice, which was released on 16 January 2015.

In 2014, Hybrid released a song called &quot;Polaris&quot; on SoundCloud.

In 2016, Hybrid wrote the score for Jim Gillespie&#x27;s &quot;Take Down&quot;. Later that year, the band announced on Facebook that Healings had left the group in the summer of 2015.

In 2017, Hybrid wrote the score for John Stephenson&#x27;s &quot;Interlude in Prague&quot;, for which Charlotte James was the music producer. The soundtrack album was released by Kill City Records on 29 May 2017.

===2018–2019: &quot;Light of the Fearless&quot; ===
On 11 May 2018, Hybrid claimed that their then-upcoming album had been completed.

On 22 June 2018, Hybrid announced their fifth studio album, &quot;Light of the Fearless&quot;. Its lead single, &quot;Light Up&quot;, was released on 13 July 2018 alongside remixes from Loadstar and Matt Lange. The album was released on digital download and streaming services on 27 July 2018.

On 21 July 2018, Hybrid released a trailer for the album, which features recording sessions with the City of Prague Philharmonic Orchestra.

On 21 February 2019, Hybrid released a short film to accompany their single &quot;Hold Your Breath&quot;. The film featured James Purefoy alongside Hybrid&#x27;s Mike and Charlotte Truman in starring roles. James Purefoy had previously worked with Hybrid on &quot;Interlude in Prague&quot;.

===2021: &quot;Black Halo&quot; ===

On 26 March 2021, the duo released a new single, &quot;Flashpoint&quot;. Two more singles, &quot;Nails&quot; and &quot;Sky Full of Diamonds&quot;, were released afterwards. Their sixth album, &quot;Black Halo&quot;, was announced on the 14th of June 2021 and was released on 9 July.

Huissen is situated along the rivers Nederrijn and Linge. The city has a population of 19,414 (as of 1 January 2020). 

==History==
Huissen was first mentioned in 814 as &quot;Hosenheim&quot;. It received city rights in 1314. The town was part of the Duchy of Cleves and became Dutch in as late as 1816. Much of the town was destroyed in World War II. After the war it was rebuilt in the Traditionalist style.

Huissen was previously a municipality of its own, but merged with the former municipalities Bemmel and Gendt in 2001, to form the municipality of Lingewaard. Huissen is the largest population centre within this municipality.

==Haunted house==

The Binnenveld mansion (Dutch: &quot;Huize Binnenveld&quot;) is a rijksmonument located in Huissen. It is better known as &quot;the haunted house of Huissen&quot;. The building stood in the front area during the Battle of Arnhem: a major battle of World War II. According to locals, this mansion would be haunted.

In 2008, the mansion received a lot of media attention when it was purchased by Dutch television personality Emile Ratelband. Ratelband came up with the idea of a restoration plan for the mansion, with the intention of making it his home. The project was cancelled because Ratelband&#x27;s wife could not make it her home; she said that evil ghosts would be haunting the building. In 2012, Ratelband was arrested for attempting to set fire to the mansion.

<doc id="453147" wikidata="Q864170" url="?curid=453147" title="Suruga Province">
<text>was an old province in the area that is today the central part of Shizuoka Prefecture. Suruga bordered on Izu, Kai, Sagami, Shinano, and Tōtōmi provinces; and was bordered by the Pacific Ocean through Suruga Bay to the south. Its abbreviated form name was .
==History==

===Early period===
Suruga was one of the original provinces of Japan established in the Nara period under the Taihō Code. The original capital of the province was located in what is now Numazu, which also had the &quot;Kokubun-ji&quot; and the Ichinomiya (Mishima Taisha) of the province. Under the &quot;Engishiki&quot; classification system, Suruga was ranked as a &quot;major country&quot; (上国), and was governed by a &quot;Kuni no miyatsuko&quot; ; under the &quot;ritsuryō&quot; system, Suruga was classified as a &quot;middle country&quot; (中国).

In a 680 AD cadastral reform, the districts forming Izu Province were administratively separated from Suruga, and the provincial capital was relocated to the right bank of the Abe River in what is now Shizuoka City.

==Medieval period==
Records of Suruga during the Heian period are sparse, but during the Kamakura period, Suruga was under direct control of the Hōjō clan. With the development of the Kamakura shogunate came increased traffic on the Tōkaidō road connecting Kamakura with Kyoto. The province came under the control of the Imagawa clan from the early Muromachi period through much of the Sengoku period. The Imagawa made efforts to introduce the customs and rituals of the &quot;kuge&quot; aristocracy to their capital. However, after Imagawa Yoshimoto was defeated by Oda Nobunaga at the Battle of Okehazama, the province taken by Takeda Shingen of Kai. The Takeda were in turn defeated by Tokugawa Ieyasu, who was already master of Mikawa and Tōtōmi.

After the Siege of Odawara (1590), Toyotomi Hideyoshi forced the Tokugawa to exchange their domains for the provinces of the Kantō region, and reassigned Sunpu Castle to one of his retainers, Nakamura Kazuichi. However, after the defeat of Ishida Mitsunari at the Battle of Sekigahara, Tokugawa Ieyasu recovered his former domains, and made Sunpu Castle his home after he formally retired from the position of Shōgun.

===Early modern period===
During the Edo period, Suruga prospered due to its location on the Tōkaidō, and numerous post towns developed. For defensive purposes, the Tokugawa shogunate forbade the construction of bridges on the major rivers of Suruga Province (such as at the Ōi River), which further led to town development on the major river crossings.

During this period, the major urban center of Sunpu remained a &quot;tenryō&quot; territory, administered directly the Shōgun by the Sunpu jōdai, and several smaller feudal domains were assigned to close &quot;fudai&quot; retainers.

Following the defeat of the Tokugawa shogunate during the Boshin War of the Meiji Restoration, the last Tokugawa &quot;shōgun&quot;, Tokugawa Yoshinobu returned to Suruga in 1868 to rule the short-lived Shizuoka Domain until the abolition of the han system in 1871 by the new Meiji government.

Suruga was subsequently merged with the neighboring provinces of Tōtōmi and Izu (less the Izu Islands) to form modern Shizuoka Prefecture. At the same time, the province continued to exist for some purposes. For example, Suruga is explicitly recognized in treaties in 1894 (a) between Japan and the United States and (b) between Japan and the United Kingdom.

In the mid-19th century, Suruga was one of the most frequently mapped provinces in Japan.

==Historical districts==
Suruga Province consisted of seven districts:

* Shizuoka Prefecture
** Abe District (安倍郡) – absorbed Udo District on April 1, 1896; now dissolved
** Fuji District (富士郡) – dissolved
** Ihara District (庵原郡) – dissolved
** Mashizu District (益津郡) – merged into Shida District on April 1, 1896
** Shida District (志太郡) – absorbed Mashizu District on April 1, 1896; now dissolved
** Suntō District (駿東郡)
** Udo District (有渡郡) – merged into Abe District on April 1, 1896

<text>Huangpu District (), makes up the eastern part of Shanghai&#x27;s traditional urban core and is today the most central of Shanghai&#x27;s 16 districts. Huangpu district is the seat of municipal government, includes key attractions such as The Bund and the Old City God Temple, as well as popular shopping districts such as Nanjing Road, Huaihai Road, and Xintiandi. The Huangpu District is one of the most densely populated urban districts in the world.

==Location==

The Huangpu District is located in central Shanghai, People&#x27;s Republic of China on the left bank (i.e., west or north bank) of Huangpu River, after which the district is named. It is opposite to Pudong and is bounded by Suzhou Creek to the north.

Today&#x27;s Huangpu District is sometimes referred to as &quot;new Huangpu&quot; to distinguish it from the pre-merger Huangpu District which existed before 2000. In 2000, the pre-merger Huangpu and Nanshi districts were combined to form a new district, also called Huangpu. In June 2011, the existing Huangpu District was combined with Luwan District to form a further new district, again called Huangpu. As a result of this merger, it currently has an area of and 678,670 inhabitants (as of 2010 census).

Of the three previous districts that make up today&#x27;s Huangpu, the pre-merger Huangpu District is located to the north, bounded by Suzhou Creek in the north and the Huangpu River to the east. South of the per-merger Huangpu District was Nanshi District, bounded by the Huangpu River to the east. West of Nanshi District was Luwan District, bounded by the Huangpu River to the south.

==Administrative Division of Huangpu District==

Huangpu District has ten subdistricts.

Note: Nanshi District and Luwan District were merged with the former Huangpu District in June 2000 and June 2011 respectively to form the current Huangpu District.

==History==
Today&#x27;s Huangpu District is the result of the merger of three long-standing districts of Shanghai: Nanshi, Huangpu and Luwan. Each of these have a distinct history and character.

=== Nanshi ===
The former Nanshi District, literally &quot;southern city&quot;, was the historical core of Shanghai. It included the old, walled city as well as the nearby docklands on both sides of the Huangpu River. Shanghai County was established at the beginning of the Ming Dynasty. A city wall was built to repel the Wokou, and this Ming Dynasty wall defined the extent of urban Shanghai for the next few centuries.

In 1842, the area north of the old city was established as the British concession in Shanghai, which later became the Shanghai International Settlement. At the time, the concession was referred to by locals as the &quot;northern city&quot; while the walled Chinese city was the &quot;southern city&quot;. From this reference was later derived the name &quot;Nanshi&quot; (). Upon the defeat of Japan at the end of World War II, a unified municipal administration was established over urban Shanghai for the first time since the mid 19th century.

In 1945, after the Republic of China government took control, the old city was divided into the Third District (Yimiao District) and the Fourth District (Penglai District). In 1959 these were merged to form Nanshi District (with a small part of former Yimiao District merging into Luwan District).

=== Huangpu ===

The pre-merger &quot;Huangpu District&quot; was largely located in the former Shanghai International Settlement. In the later part of the 19th century and the early 20th century, this area quickly became the commercial centre of Shanghai. The International Settlement was handed back to the Chinese government in 1943.

In 1945, after the Republic of China government took control, the south eastern part of the former International Settlement was divided into the First District (Huangpu District) and the Second District (Laozha District). Of these, the First District lay on the bank of the Huangpu River, and so was named after the river. In 1956, the two districts were merged to form a new and expanded Huangpu District.

Since 1943, the Shanghai Municipal Government has always been located in Huangpu District – first at the old Shanghai Municipal Council building, then in the old HSBC Building, and presently in a purpose-built building on People&#x27;s Square.

=== Luwan ===
The former Luwan District occupied most of the eastern part of the former Shanghai French Concession and some nearby areas. This area was long regarded as the premier residential and high end commercial area of Shanghai. It is known for its leafy streets lined with London planes, cafes and restaurants, high end retail and historical houses.

In 1945, after the Republic of China government took control, the eastern-central part of the former French Concession was divided into the Fifth District (Taishan) and the Sixth District (Lujiawan), separated by South Chongqing Road and Luban Road. Of these, the Sixth District was named after Lokawei (), &quot;Lu&#x27;s Bay&quot;, an area named after a bend on the &quot;Zhaojiabang&quot; creek. The main police depot and prison of the French concession was located here. In 1947, Taishan District was renamed &quot;Songshan District&quot;.

In 1950, Lujiawan District was renamed &quot;Luwan District&quot;. In 1956, Songshan District was merged into Luwan District. In 1959, part of former Yimiao District was also merged into Luwan District.

=== Merger in the 1990s and 2000s ===
The district boundaries remained largely unchanged between 1959 and 1993. In 1993, the part of Nanshi east of the Huangpu River was merged into the Pudong New District.

In 2000, the Shanghai Municipal Government abolished Nanshi District entirely, merging it into Huangpu District. In 2011, the merger of Luwan District with Huangpu District was announced. On June 8, 2011, it was announced that the proposed plan of merging Luwan and Huangpu Districts had been approved by the State Council.

== Features ==

Despite the mergers, the three previous districts which make up today&#x27;s Huangpu District retain their distinct characters.
===Huangpu===
The pre-merger Huangpu District was long the commercial centre of Shanghai. Along the Huangpu riverfront were located the major docks of Shanghai. Behind the docks, on the Bund, were offices of major financial institutions and trading houses. Extending from the Bund westward are several major commercial streets. These include the East Nanjing Road, popular with visitors from around the country. Fuzhou Road is the centre of bookselling in Shanghai, featuring large scale general and specialist book shops and publishers.

The People&#x27;s Square, previously the Shanghai race course, is now the site of the Shanghai Grand Theatre, Shanghai Museum, Shanghai Art Museum, and the Shanghai Urban Planning Exhibition Hall. The Shanghai Natural History Museum is also located in Huangpu District.

===Nanshi===
The old Nanshi district is the old, walled city of Shanghai, and retains a number of important sights, including City God Temple and the nearby Yuyuan Garden. The old city is undergoing extensive redevelopment, with the existing houses being replaced by high rise apartment buildings as well as modern constructions with traditional Chinese style facades. The boundaries of the walled city can still be traced in the form of a wide ring road built over the course of the old city wall and moat. The city wall has almost entirely been demolished, except for one tower and a short section of wall attached to it, which survived because the tower was converted into a temple in the medieval period.

===Luwan===
The old Luwan district was a part of the old French Concession area, traditionally one of the most prestigious sections of the city. It was famous for its boulevards lined with plane trees, which had been imported over 100 years ago. Despite rampant redevelopment, the district retains a distinct character and is a tourist attraction in itself. The district included the historical residences of Sun Yat-sen, Mao Zedong, Zhou Enlai, Agnes Smedley, and Mei Lanfang, among many others. Huaihai Road is the major commercial thoroughfare in this part of the city.

==Economy==
Huangpu is the district with the highest GDP per capita(621,500 CHY, around 86,319 USD) in Shanghai as of 2023, almost doubled compared to the second place(Changning District).Huangpu District is the only entire CAZ(Central Activity Zone)district. The Huangpu District also has the highest housing price per square meter in Shanghai. Due to its special location, some famous companies also has their headquarters in Huangpu. For example,The headquarters of Xiaohongshu are in Huangpu District.

==Government and infrastructure==
The Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office in Shanghai is in The Headquarters Building in Huangpu District.

<doc id="453154" wikidata="Q1325611" url="?curid=453154" title="Shanghai Grand Theatre">
<text>The Shanghai Grand Theatre () is a complex located at the intersection of Renmin Avenue and Huangpi North Road in the northern part of the People&#x27;s Square in the Huangpu District of Shanghai. The building houses the Shanghai Opera House and other performing companies.

The theatre was designed by French architect Jean-Marie Charpentier along with the Institute of Architectural Design of Eastern China. Since its opening on August 27, 1998, it has staged performances of operas, musicals, ballets, symphonies, chamber music, and Chinese operas.

== Origin ==
Since the Reform and Opening-up in the late 1970s, more and more international performing groups visited Shanghai, but there was no theatre suitable for large-scale plays until the 1990s. The Shanghai Municipal People&#x27;s Government decided to construct a large performing arts complex to satisfy such a need and make it an urban culture centre. In 1994, with a 3000 million RMB government investment, the construction of the SGT started. 
== Theater buildings and architecture style==
The Theater is divided into 8 floors above ground and 2 floors below ground, covering a total area of 62803 m2. The total investment budget is 1.3 billion yuan.

The whole building is a crystal-like palace consisting of three main theaters: the Auditorium, the Buick Theater, and the Studio Theater, with complete ancillary facilities such as ticketing center, Ballet Rehearsal hall, band rehearsal hall, VIP hall, exhibition hall, souvenir shop, coffee bar, banquet hall, and parking garage.

=== The Auditorium ===
The Auditorium is decorated with warm colors of gold and red. It is mainly for large-scale performances such as operas, symphonies, ballets, dramas, and so forth. The 19.5-meter-high Auditorium covers an area of 1000 m2 and is divided into three levels of stands, with 1631 seats in total. The structural proportion and seating arrangement of the stand ensure that the audience is close to the stage as much as possible and enjoys the performance from the best audio-visual angle.

In the overall design, a Waagner Biro control system is adopted in the full-automatic mechanical stage for lifting, tilting, rotation, ladder, and other transformations. The well-equipped Meyersound&#x27;s loudspeaker and surrounding sound can meet the requirements of the 5.1 channel. A digital mixer of high fidelity can provide 96 inputs and 64 outputs.

=== The Buick Theater ===
The Buick Theater, with stable walnut color as its main color, is located on the west side of the first floor. It is the performing space for chamber concerts as well as small and medium-sized dramas and is also the venue of public charity performances and art education activities. The Buick Theater is divided into two levels of stands, with 575 seats in total.

The stage is 12 meters wide, 6 meters high, and 11 meters deep. Above the stage is a voice echoing board and 25 electric suspenders, the loading capacity of which is up to 300 kilograms, the maximum lifting height being 14 meters, and the maximum lifting speed 1m / s. There are 5 dressing rooms in backstage for 50 people to make up simultaneously.

=== The Studio Theater ===
Located on the fifth floor, the Studio Theater is a &quot;black box theater&quot; with dark gray as its main color. It mainly presents small plays of experiments and fashion. There are 220 fixed seats and 80 mobile seats which can be combined according to the needs of the performance. The performance area is about 140 m2. There are 4 dressing rooms in backstage for 30 people to make up at the same time.

At the entrance of the small theater, there are coin dispensers and parcel cabinets to provide mineral water and deposit services for the audience. There is an independent VIP lounge in the backstage area, which provides program book, tea, towel, and other services, which can be used by the VIP before and during the performance.

<text>Sharif University of Technology (SUT); (, romanized : Dāneshgāh-e sana&#x27;ti-e sharif) is a public research university in Tehran, Iran. It is widely considered to be the nation&#x27;s most prestigious and leading institution for science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields. Admission to Sharif is highly competitive and it is traditionally the first choice of the top students in the Iranian University Entrance Exam and Olympiads.

Established in 1966 under the reign of Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi, it was formerly named the Aryamehr University of Technology () and for a short period after the 1979 revolution, the university was called Tehran University of Technology. Following the revolution, the university was named after Majid Sharif Vaghefi.

Today, the university provides both undergraduate and graduate programs in 15 main departments. The student body consists of about 6,000 undergraduate students and 4,700 graduate students from all the 31 provinces of Iran. Funding for Sharif University is provided by the government and through private funding. Undergraduate admission to Sharif is limited to the top 800 of the 500,000 students who pass the national entrance examination administered annually by the Iranian Ministry of Science, Research and Technology.

In the 2013 Academic Ranking of World Universities Engineering/Technology and Computer Sciences rankings, SUT was ranked 5th in the Middle East. It is in the top 251–275 universities in the world and 37th in Asia in the 2014 Times Higher Education World University Rankings. In the 2014 Times Higher Education top 100 for newer universities (less than 50 years old), SUT ranked 1st in the Middle East, 6th in Asia, and 27th in the world. In 2023, according to US News, the world ranking of this university reached 598.

==History==

The university was founded in 1966 with the name &quot;Aryamehr University of Industry&quot; by Mohammad Ali Mojtahedi. At that time, there were 54 faculty members and a total of 412 students who were selected by national examination. Also, only four departments were established: Electrical, Metallurgical, Mechanical, and Chemical Engineering.
In 1972, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi appointed Sayyed Hosein Nasr as president of the university with the goal of modeling the school based on the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, but with roots in Iranian culture. In 1974 a new campus of the university was established in Isfahan. But later that campus became an independent university, named Isfahan University of Technology (IUT). The emblem of IUT still closely resembles SUT&#x27;s emblem . Following the revolution, the university was named after Majid Sharif Vaghefi, who was one of the People&#x27;s Mujahedin of Iran group&#x27;s leaders who was killed by the members of a splinter group (later renamed to Peykar Organization) who had recently converted from Islam to Marxism and were adamant to forcefully change the Mujahedin&#x27;s organization&#x27;s ideology to Marxism.

Currently, the university has about 12,000 students and over 700 faculty members in 16 main departments. During the Mahsa Amini protests in 2022, many students participated, with video footage of the protest and subsequent response by Iranian security forces published first to social media and then by major news organizations. Iranian state news agency IRNA reported that at least 37 students were arrested and most were released shortly afterwards.

==Campuses==

===Main campus===
The main campus of the university is located in the Tarasht neighborhood, near Azadi Square, Tehran, Iran. It is located close to the Azadi Tower, which is the symbol of Tehran and one of the main transportation hubs. The endowment of Sharif University of Technology has been estimated at $25 million.

===International campus===

Sharif University also has an International Campus on Kish Island in the Persian Gulf. The International Campus of Sharif University of Technology was established in 2005. Today there are two faculties active in this campus: Faculty of Engineering and Science, and Faculty of Management. The campus is currently admitting students for bachelor&#x27;s, master&#x27;s, and Ph.D. degrees in engineering courses and a master&#x27;s degree in management.

==Academic profile==
===Profile===
Sharif University was established in 1966 as an Engineering university with departments of Electrical, Metallurgical, Mechanical, and Chemical Engineering.

==World rankings==
In the 2020 &quot;Academic Ranking of World Universities&quot; (also known as Shanghai Ranking), the university ranked between 501 and 600 in the world and first in Iran. According to the QS Ranking, Sharif University of Technology has stood in the first place of Iran and maintained its international rank 334th. In the 2022-2023 &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report Best Global University Ranking&quot;, the university ranked 598th in the world.

==Student life==

===Political activities===
Through the student political movement after the 2nd of Khordad Movement, Sharif students were also actively involved. The major groups with political intentions at Sharif, during 1997–2003, were students Basij and the Association of Muslim students, briefly called Anjoman (Association). Most other smaller groups were allies of either Basij or Anjoman.
Basij was a serious opposer of Mohammad Khatami, the president of the time. Whereas, Anjoman was a loyal follower.
There have been several clashes between member students of the two groups. Free speech tribunes, occasionally end in harsh quarrel-like debates.
However, the major clash between Anjoman and Basij occurred while the student movement was in silence in most other universities. In 2006, a serious controversy resulting in physical tensions, occurred after Basij attempted to bury bodies of unknown martyrs of the Iran–Iraq War at the universities&#x27; Mosque court.

===Sharif University of Technology Association (SUTA)===
This non-profit organization is registered in the state of California, USA and has many chapters and affiliates around the world. Its mission is to enhance professional, academic, and social contacts among its membership, and to strengthen the ties between the association members living outside of Iran and the university.

<text>The University of Pisa (, UniPi) is a public research university in Pisa, Italy. Founded in 1343, it is one of the oldest universities in Europe. Together with Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa and Sant&#x27;Anna School of Advanced Studies, it is part of the Pisa University System.

== History ==

=== The Origins ===

The University of Pisa was officially founded in 1343, although various scholars place its origins in the 11th century. It is certain, however, that from the middle of the 12th century Pisa had a “Universitas” in the original sense of the word, that is, a group of students who gathered around masters. It was during this period that Leonardo Fibonacci was born and worked. He was one of the greatest mathematicians in history who, through his work, synthesized the spirit and processes of Greek geometry and the tools of Arabic mathematics for the first time in Europe.

The papal seal “In Supremae dignitatis”, issued by Pope Clement VI on 3 September 1343, granted the Studium in Pisa the title of Studium Generale with various exclusive privileges, making it universally recognised. In medieval times, the Studium Generale was a higher institute of education founded or confirmed by a universal authority, namely the papacy or the empire. Pisa was among the first European cities to vaunt a papal attestation, followed by Prague in 1347 and Heidelberg in 1386. At the outset in Pisa, lessons in Theology, Civil Law, Canon Law and Medicine were established.

The first years of the new Studium were particularly difficult, although there is documentary evidence that shows persistent academic activity with a slow recovery starting in 1355.

The end of the 14th century and the beginning of the 15th century saw Pisa and its Studium heading towards a slow death. The war, which had allowed the Florentines to conquer the city, was so socially and economically damaging that it made preserving even the most essential academic activity impossible.

=== The Medicis and Galileo ===

During the first few days of November 1473, the Studium in Pisa began to develop systematically at the request of Lorenzo dei Medici. In 1486, the construction of a building specifically for lessons was commissioned: the building, the future Palazzo della Sapienza, still the centre of the present-day University, was placed in the 13th century Piazza del Grano, which could be reached through the gateway dell’Abbondanza. The image of the Cherub was placed above this gateway. In the Christian tradition, the Cherub represents an angelic being with a clearer vision of God, who in turn represents absolute knowledge. Since then, the Cherub has become the iconographic symbol of the University of Pisa and, in more recent times, the Order of the Cherub is awarded to members of the university teaching staff who have contributed to enhancing its prestige.

In 1497, the Pisan institute suffered a new period of decline and was moved to Florence for nine years. The rise to the throne of Duke Cosimo I dei Medici marked the beginning of a new era. The formal reopening of the university on 1 November 1543 was, in fact, considered to be a second founding. With the 1545 Statute, Cosimo managed to raise the quality of the teaching, making the University of Pisa one of the most important in Europe for both teaching and research. The Duke established the Chair of Simples (Semplici in Botany) and appointed Luca Ghini: between 1543 and 1544 the Garden of Simples was founded. This was the first botanical garden in the world annexed to a university Studium. A few decades later, the garden was moved to its present position a few dozen metres from Piazza dei Miracoli, covering an area of around three hectares with 6,000 cultivated plants and seeds exchanged with other 400 structures in the world. Ghini was succeeded by the philosopher and scientist Andrea Cesalpino, who created the first scientific method for the classification of plants and can be considered the forerunner of the discovery of the cardiovascular system.  

Cosimo I was still ruling when Galileo Galilei was born on 15 February 1564 in Pisa. Galileo Galilei is universally thought of as the founder of modern science and the modern experimental method. He was initially a student and then a teacher of Mathematics at the University of Pisa before moving to Padova. It was in the city in Tuscany that he began the studies and experiments which were the basis of his revolutionary theories.

=== The house of Lorraine ===
The decline of the Grand Duchy of Tuscany (Medici), in the middle of the 18th century, saw the downfall of the Studium in Pisa, which only picked up again with the Lorraine dynasty. It was thanks to these enlightened innovators and reformers that numerous works and the establishment of the new Chairs of Experimental Physics and Chemistry were created.  

The annexation of Tuscany to the Napoleonic Empire at the beginning of the 19th century brought about the transformation of the Studium into an imperial Academy: the university became a subsidiary of the University of Paris, even though it managed to retain a certain degree of autonomy. At that time, five faculties (Theology, Law, Medicine, Science and Arts), exams, different academic qualifications (bachelor, master and doctoral degrees) and degree theses came into being. The Scuola Normale Superiore was established between 1810 and 1813. It started out as a subsidiary of the École Normale in Paris and closed immediately to be reopened in 1846 with the inauguration of its present seat at Palazzo della Carovana in Piazza dei Cavalieri.

=== Restoration and Risorgimento ===

The period of the Restoration led to a reconsideration of the organisation within the Studium, but not to the complete revocation of the Napoleonic experience. In 1826, lessons on Egyptology were introduced at the University of Pisa. This was a first in Europe and the world in general, leading to the renowned French-Tuscan expedition to Egypt between 1828 and 1829. In 1839, Pisa hosted the first congress of Italian scientists, which saw the participation of over 400 scholars and 300 experts in the various branches of knowledge from different states of the peninsula. It was during this period that the university was at the centre of the reform called for by Provveditore Gaetano Giorgini, which saw the faculties increase in number to six (Theology, Law, Arts, Medicine, Mathematics and Natural Sciences) and for the first time in the world, the Chair of Agriculture and sheep-farming was created and entrusted to Cosimo Ridolfi.

In the university and in the city, liberal and patriotic ideals were coming to the fore and these reached their peak when teachers and students formed a university battalion and joined the battle of Curtatone and Montanara in 1848. This was one of the most significant battles in the Italian Risorgimento. A memorial plaque in Palazzo della Sapienza commemorates the volunteers who “died fighting for the rebirth of Italy”, while the Italian flag used by the university battalion was honoured with the gold military medal by the Italian Republic in 1948.

=== The kingdom of Italy ===
With the creation of the Kingdom of Italy, the University of Pisa, which now counted around 560 matriculated students, re-emerged with all the faculties then present in the regulations and was acknowledged through the university reform of 1862, as one of the six principal national universities together with Turin, Pavia, Bologna, Naples and Palermo. The consolidation and expansion of the university, above all in the years straddling the 1800s and the 1900s, had a direct impact on the urban fabric development of the city even though the number of students increased only moderately (891 in 1912). The university gradually welcomed female students and in 1877, Ernestina Paper graduated in Medicine. She was the first woman to graduate from an Italian university and was followed by Cornelia Fabri in Mathematics and Erminia Pittaluga in Arts.

The reform called for by the minister Giovanni Gentile in 1923, further confirmed the university&#x27;s prominent position at national level when it was placed among the ten universities totally funded by the state. Notwithstanding the aim to make Pisa a great “centre of university fascist culture” antifascist unrest was still alive, both in the academic community and among students. The application of racial laws, the first of which were signed by King Vittorio Emanuele III in 1938 at San Rossore, near Pisa, affected foreign and Italian students and university teachers severely, as was the case throughout Italy. It was not until 2018, in Pisa, 80 years after the signature, that there was an official and public admission of responsibility on behalf of the Italian universities (on the University of Pisa&#x27;s own initiative).

=== The Republic ===

The physical and moral destruction caused by the Second World War was soon overcome and the University of Pisa, whose matriculated students passed from 768 in 1945 to 1,292 in 1950, was able to lead the field in many areas of knowledge, adapting to the new demands of social, civil and economic life. The faculties of Economics and Business Studies (1948), and later Foreign Languages and Literature (1969) and Political Science (1970) joined the faculties present before the conflict – Engineering and Pharmacy –  and accompanied the arrival of the university for the masses (between 1961 and 1972 student numbers in Pisa went from around 9,000 to 27,000). At the start of the sixties, the University of Pisa established the first Italian Chair of Film History and Criticism. In 1969, the degree course in Computer Science (Informatics) was set up. It was the first in Italy and followed the creation of the Pisan Electronic Calculator (CEP), designed in the mid-1950s and sponsored by Nobel Prize winner and graduate of the University of Pisa, Enrico Fermi, which was the basis for other firsts in Italy in its field. In 1986, for example, the first Italian link to the Internet originated in Pisa.  

In 1967, the merger of the pre-existing colleges led to the creation of the Sant’Anna School of Advanced Studies and the Scuola Normale Superiore, forming a system of further education which is of the highest prestige at international level.

Also in 1967, during a period of protests, the “Tesi della Sapienza”, one of the milestones of the 1968 student movement in Italy, were compiled in Pisa. This phase of the unrest was particularly animated in the city with some dramatic moments.

From the end of the 1970s, the University&#x27;s Natural History Museum moved to the enchanting 14th century Charterhouse of Calci, a building of priceless historic and architectural worth. The museum houses numerous rooms dedicated to zoology, mineralogy and palaeontology as well as Italy&#x27;s largest freshwater aquarium and Whale gallery with more than thirty whale skeletons exhibited in an ancient portico.

=== UniPi today ===

The Ruberti reform of 1989, which envisaged the statutory autonomy of universities, forced the university to approve a new Statute, whose overall structure was only called into question with the so-called “Gelmini reform” in 2010. This led to the adoption of the 2012 Statute and the organizational layout which excluded the 11 Faculties in favour of 20 Departments.

At present, the university is divided into 20 Departments, with around 150 first and second level degree courses, and single cycle degree courses, more than 20 doctoral courses, 50 schools of specialisation and more than 60 postgraduate courses. There are more than 1,500 members of teaching staff and a slightly higher number of administrative personnel, technicians, foreign language assistants and librarians. There are around 50,000 students enrolled, and in a city with a population of approximately 90,000 inhabitants, this makes Pisa a true city campus. The students come mainly from Tuscany and Liguria, with a significant intake from many other regions, above all from the south of Italy. A sizeable number of the students are also foreign.

Among the many graduates of the University of Pisa are Nobel laureates Giosuè Carducci, Enrico Fermi, and Carlo Rubbia, Fields Medal recipients Enrico Bombieri and Alessio Figalli, Presidents of the Republic Giovanni Gronchi and Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, film directors Mario Monicelli, Paolo Taviani, and Vittorio Taviani, writers Tiziano Terzani and Antonio Tabucchi, and tenor Andrea Bocelli.

==Organization and administration==

PhD studies are usually offered and arranged by the departments. The lectures are mostly given in Italian, except for a number of courses at the faculty of foreign languages and literature, some scientific programmes, such as the international MSc in aerospace engineering (EuMAS), Master in Business Informatics, the Master of Science in Space Engineering and the Master in Computer Science and Networking, jointly offered with Scuola Superiore Sant&#x27;Anna. Students also have at their disposal a language centre, where they can attend courses in foreign languages, a sports centre (&quot;Cus Pisa&quot;) that arranges for many sports intramural leagues and allows sports practice in almost all the disciplines available in Italy, and six university refectories (&quot;Mense universitarie&quot;). The University of Pisa is not organized in the form of one unique campus, but rather its many buildings are scattered throughout the whole Pisa area, especially in the city centre.

<doc id="453166" wikidata="Q3412448" url="?curid=453166" title="Shawarma">
<text>Shawarma (; ) is a Middle Eastern dish that originated in the Levantine region during the Ottoman Empire, consisting of meat that is cut into thin slices, stacked in an inverted cone, and roasted on a slow-turning vertical spit. Traditionally made with lamb or mutton, it may also be made with chicken, turkey meat, beef, falafel or veal. The surface of the rotisserie meat is routinely shaved off once it cooks and is ready to be served. Shawarma is a popular street food throughout the Arab world, Levant, and the Greater Middle East.

==Etymology==
The name in Arabic is a rendering of the term in Ottoman Turkish ( , ), referring to rotisserie.

==History==
The shawarma technique—grilling a vertical stack of meat slices and cutting it off as it cooks—first appeared in the Ottoman Empire in the 19th century in the form of döner kebab, which both the Greek gyros and the Levantine shawarma are derived from. Shawarma led to the development during the early 20th century of the contemporary Mexican dish &quot;tacos al pastor&quot; when it was brought there by Lebanese immigrants. The dish is also especially popular in Ottawa, Ontario, where a large community of the Lebanese diaspora exists.

==Preparations==

Shawarma is prepared from thin cuts of seasoned and marinated lamb, mutton, veal, beef, chicken, or turkey. The slices are stacked on a skewer about high. Pieces of fat may be added to the stack to provide extra juiciness and flavour. A motorized spit slowly turns the stack of meat in front of an electric or gas-fired heating element, continuously roasting the outer layer. Shavings are cut off the rotating stack for serving, customarily with a long, flat knife.

Spices may include cumin, cardamom, cinnamon, turmeric or paprika, and in some areas &quot;baharat&quot;. Shawarma is commonly served as a sandwich or wrap, in a flatbread such as pita, laffa or lavash. In the Middle East, chicken shawarma is typically served with garlic sauce, fries, and pickles. The garlic sauce served with the sandwich depends on the meat. &quot;Toum&quot; or &quot;toumie&quot; sauce is made from garlic, vegetable oil, lemon, and egg white or starch, and is usually served with chicken shawarma. &quot;Tarator&quot; sauce is made from garlic, tahini sauce, lemon, and water, and is served with beef shawarma.

In Israel, most shawarma is made with dark-meat turkey, commonly served with tahina sauce instead of yogurt for kashrut reasons. It is often garnished with diced tomatoes, cucumbers, onions, pickled vegetables, hummus, garlic mayo, tahini sauce, sumac, or &quot;amba&quot; mango sauce. Some restaurants offer additional toppings, including grilled peppers, eggplant, or French fries. 

In Armenia and Georgia, shawarma is traditionally made with thin cuts of marinated meat which is left marinating overnight in spices such as coriander, cumin, cardamom, paprika, garlic, lemon juice, and olive oil.

<doc id="453167" wikidata="Q125474" url="?curid=453167" title="The Bund">
<text>The Bund is a waterfront area and a protected historical district in central Shanghai. The area centers on a section of Zhongshan Road (East Zhongshan Road No.1) within the former Shanghai International Settlement, which runs along the western bank of the Huangpu River in the eastern part of Huangpu. The area along the river faces the modern skyscrapers of Lujiazui in Pudong. The Bund usually refers to the buildings and wharves on this section of the road, as well as some adjacent areas. This region has a significant European influence, with the style of many structures most comparable to that of European cities, particularly Gothic, Baroque, Neoclassical, Romanesque, Art Deco, and Renaissance architecture. Additionally, some of the city&#x27;s top eateries are located there. From the 1860s to the 1930s, it was the rich and powerful center of the foreign establishment in Shanghai, operating as a legally protected treaty port.

==Name==
The term &quot;&quot; was borrowed into English from , originally referred to a dyke or embankment, which the Hindustani word itself comes from Classical . Within the Chinese treaty ports, it was applied specifically to an embanked quay which ran along the shore. The Chinese name for the Bund is unrelated in origin: it literally means &quot;outer bank&quot;, and distinguishes this part of the riverfront from the &quot;inner bank&quot; adjacent to the old city of Shanghai.

==History==

The Shanghai Bund has dozens of historical buildings, lining the Huangpu River, that once housed numerous banks and trading houses from the United Kingdom, France, the United States, Italy, Russia, Germany, Japan, the Netherlands, and Belgium, as well as the consulates of Russia and Britain, a newspaper, the Shanghai Club and the Masonic Club. The Bund lies north of the old, walled city of Shanghai. It was initially a British settlement; later the British and American settlements were combined in the International Settlement in 1863. Magnificent commercial buildings in the Beaux Arts style sprang up in the years around the turn of the 20th century as the Bund developed into a major financial center of East Asia. Directly to the south, and just northeast of the old walled city, the former French Bund (the &quot;quai de France&quot;, part of the Shanghai French Concession) was of comparable size to the Bund but functioned more as a working harbourside.

By the 1940s, the Bund housed the headquarters of many, if not most, of the major financial institutions operating in China, including the &quot;big four&quot; national banks in the Republic of China era. However, with the Communist victory in the Chinese Civil War, many of these financial institutions were gradually moved to Hong Kong in the 1950s. Hotels and clubs were closed or converted to other uses. The statues of colonial figures and foreign worthies which had dotted the riverside were also removed.

===Post Cultural Revolution===

In the late 1970s and early 1980s, with the thawing of economic policy in the People&#x27;s Republic of China, buildings on the Bund were gradually returned to their former uses. Government institutions were moved out in favour of financial institutions, while hotels resumed trading as such. Also during this period, a series of floods caused by typhoons motivated the municipal government to construct a tall levee along the riverfront, with the result that the embankment now stands some 10 metres higher than street level. In the 1990s, Zhongshan Road (named after Sun Yat-sen), the road on which the Bund is centred, was widened to ten lanes. As a result, most of the parkland which had existed along the road disappeared. Also in this period, the ferry wharves connecting the Bund and Pudong, which had served the area&#x27;s original purpose, were removed. A number of pleasure cruises still operate from some nearby wharves.

In the 1990s, the Shanghai government attempted to promote an extended concept of the Bund to boost tourism, and land value in nearby areas, as well as to reconcile the promotion of &quot;colonial relics&quot; with the Socialist ideology. In its expanded form, the term &quot;Bund&quot; (as &quot;New Bund&quot; or &quot;Northern Bund&quot;) was used to refer to areas south of Yan&#x27;an Road, and a stretch of riverfront north of the Suzhou River (Zhabei). Such use of the term, however, remains rare outside of tourism literature. On March 28, 2010, the eve of the opening of the World Expo, the Bund fully completed its renovation project.

===21st century redevelopment===
From 2008, a major reconfiguration of traffic flow along the Bund was carried out. The first stage of the plan involved the southern end of the Bund, and saw the demolition of a section of the Yan&#x27;an Road elevated expressway, including removal of the large elevated expressway exit structure that formerly dominated the confluence of Yan&#x27;an Road and the Bund. A second phase involved the year-long restoration of the century-old Waibaidu Bridge at the northern end of the Bund. In a third stage, the former 10-lane Bund roadway was reconstructed in two levels, with six lanes carried in a new tunnel. The vacated road space was used to widen the landscaped promenade along the waterfront. The new concrete bridge that was built in 1991 to relieve traffic on Waibaidu Bridge was rendered obsolete by the new double-levelled roadway, and demolished. The Bund was reopened to the public on Sunday 28 March 2010 after restoration for the 2010 Expo.

A stampede occurred on December 31, 2014, at 11:36 p.m. in the waterfront. At least 36 people were killed and 47 injured in the incident. The primary incident took place near Chen Yi Square, where a large crowd, estimated at around 300,000, had gathered for the new year celebration.

The bund is one of the most prominent features when viewed from the Shanghai World Financial Center in Pudong and its observation deck on the 100th floor.

==Layout==

The Bund stretches one mile (1.6 km) along the bank of the Huangpu River. Traditionally, the Bund begins at Yan&#x27;an Road (formerly Edward VII Avenue) in the south and ends at Waibaidu Bridge (formerly Garden Bridge) in the north, which crosses Suzhou Creek.

The Bund centres on a stretch of the Zhongshan Road, named after Sun Yat-sen. Zhongshan Road is a largely circular road which formed the traditional conceptual boundary of Shanghai city &quot;proper&quot;. To the west of this stretch of the road stands some 52 buildings of various Western classical and modern styles which is the main feature of the Bund (see Architecture and buildings below). To the east of the road was formerly a stretch of parkland culminating at Huangpu Park. (This park is the site of the infamous sign reported to have proclaimed &quot;no dogs or Chinese&quot;, although this exact wording never existed. Further information, including an image of the sign, can be found at the article on Huangpu Park.) This area is now much reduced due to the expansion of Zhongshan Road. Further east is a tall levee, constructed in the 1990s to ward off flood waters. The construction of this high wall has dramatically changed the appearance of the Bund.

Near the Nanjing Road intersection stands the only bronze statue along the Bund, a statue of military officer Chen Yi, who served as the first Communist mayor of Shanghai. At the northern end of The Bund, along the riverfront, is Huangpu Park, in which is situated the Shanghai People&#x27;s Heroes Memorial Tower — a tall, abstract concrete tower constructed by the Shanghai government in 1993 to serve as a memorial commemorating Chinese revolutionary martyrs, as well as those who have died fighting natural disasters in China.

==Architecture and buildings==

The Bund houses 52 buildings of various architectural styles, generally Eclecticist, but with some buildings displaying predominantly Romanesque Revival, Gothic Revival, Renaissance Revival, Baroque Revival, Neo-Classical or Beaux-Arts styles, and a number in Art Deco style (Shanghai has one of the richest collections of Art Deco architectures in the world). From the south, the main buildings are:
* American Club at 209 Fuzhou Rd – General Claire Chennault, then Executive Director of China Post 1, used the premises until 1948. Built by László Hudec of Curry &amp; Co. between 1923 and 1925 in the American Georgian Style. Originally built as an all-male club after purchasing the site in 1922, it was a popular club for expatriates. A six-story building plus basement, around 1000m2 per floor, designed in the common steel and concrete construction prevalent along The Bund area of Shanghai. Containing bars, billiard room and 50 bedrooms there was also a rooftop garden. 
* Asia Building (No. 1, The Bund), originally the McBain Building, housed the Shanghai offices of Royal Dutch Shell and Asiatic Petroleum Company.
* Shanghai Club (No. 2, The Bund), which was the principal social club for British nationals in Shanghai. Since 2010 the Waldorf-Astoria Shanghai Hotel.
* Union Building (No. 3, The Bund), previously housed a number of insurance companies, and is now a shopping centre.
* The Mercantile Bank of India, London and China building (No. 4, The Bund), housed the Mercantile Bank of India, London and China, built between 1916–1918.
* Nissin Building (No. 5, The Bund), housed a Japanese shipping company.
* China Merchants Bank Building (No. 6, The Bund), housed the first Chinese-owned bank in China, and is now HSBC&#x27;s Shanghai branch.
* Great Northern Telegraph Building (No. 7, The Bund), housed Great Northern Telegraph Company. Site of the first telephone switch in Shanghai in 1882.
* (No. 9, The Bund), currently housed the China Merchants Group, also houses the Shanghai flagship store for Dolce &amp; Gabbana.
* The HSBC Building (No. 12, The Bund), now used by the Shanghai Pudong Development Bank, was once the Shanghai headquarters of the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, which failed to reach a deal with the Shanghai government to buy the building again in the 1990s, when the Shanghai government moved out of the building that they had used since the 1950s. The present building was completed in 1923. At the time, it was called &quot;the most luxurious building between the Suez Canal and the Bering Strait&quot;. Its famous ceiling mosaics have been fully restored, and can be viewed inside the entrance hall.
* The Customs House (No. 13, The Bund), was built in 1927 on the site of an earlier, traditional Chinese-style customs house. The clock and bell was built in England and in imitation of Big Ben.
* China Bank of Communications Building (No. 14, The Bund), was the last building to be built on the Bund before the founding of the People&#x27;s Republic. It now houses the Shanghai Council of Trade Unions.
* Russo-Chinese Bank Building (No. 15, The Bund) is now the China Foreign Exchange Trade System (CFETS; previously Shanghai Gold Exchange).
* Bank of Taiwan Building (No. 16, The Bund) is now the China Merchants Bank.
* North China Daily News Building (No. 17, The Bund) housed the most influential English-language newspaper in Shanghai at the time. Today it houses AIA Insurance.
* Chartered Bank Building (No. 18, The Bund) housed the Shanghai headquarters of what became Standard Chartered Bank the building now houses designer shops, the restaurant Mr &amp; Mrs Bund, and a creative exhibition space. HQ of Chipolbrok Chinese-Polish shipping company (1962–1998).
* Palace Hotel (No. 19, The Bund), today forms part of the Peace Hotel.
* Sassoon House (No. 20, The Bund), with the attached Cathay Hotel, was built by Sir Victor Sassoon. It was, and still is today, famous for its jazz band in its cafe. The top floor originally housed Sassoon&#x27;s private apartment. Today, it forms the other part of the Peace Hotel.
* Bank of China Building (No. 23, The Bund) housed the headquarters of the Bank of China. The stunted appearance of the building is attributed to Sassoon&#x27;s insistence that no other building on the Bund could rise higher than his.
* Yokohama Specie Bank Building (No. 24, The Bund) housed the Japanese Yokohama Specie Bank until 1945, today housed a Shanghai branch of the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China.

==Transport==

While Shanghai Metro Line 2 crosses the Bund, there are no plans to build a station on the Bund. The closest station is East Nanjing Road, about a five-minute walk up Nanjing Road. East-1 Zhongshan Road is a major bus route.

There were previously frequent ferry services operating by Shanghai Ferry from wharves on and near the Bund. The most popular remaining ferry service runs from Jinling Road wharf, near the southern end of the Bund, to Dongchang Road wharf, at the southern end of Lujiazui across the river. A full fare ride on the ferry costs 2 RMB. A number of companies offer Huangpu River cruises (boat tours) departing from the wharf; all of the major buildings in the Bund, and in Pudong, are illuminated each evening. 
Bund Sightseeing Tunnel (外滩观光隧道), a pedestrian transit tunnel under the riverbed crosses the Huangpu River from the Bund. Passengers board slow-moving SK people movers which travel along the tunnel, with light effects projected onto the walls of the tunnel. These effects are marketed as a tourist attraction; the charge for the tunnel is ten times the fee for crossing the river on Line 2 and 20 times the 2 RMB fee for crossing by ferry.

==In popular culture==
There are numerous studies in Chinese and English, and many popular representations. The Bund was featured in the 1984 novel &quot;Empire of the Sun&quot; by British author J. G. Ballard, based on his experiences as a boy during the Japanese invasion and occupation. The book was made into a film by Steven Spielberg. The opening pages of the 1999 novel &quot;Cryptonomicon&quot; by Neal Stephenson are set on the Bund in November 1941, as civil order collapses under the threat of Japanese invasion.

The Bund is a setting (and namesake) of the Hong Kong television series &quot;The Bund&quot; (1980) and film &quot;Shanghai Grand&quot; (1996). The story of both involve pre-World War II era gangsters competing for control of the Bund. &quot;The Bund&quot; is a song composed by electronic music group The Shanghai Restoration Project released on the group&#x27;s first eponymous release, inspired by the Shanghai jazz bands of the 1930s. An instrumental version of the song titled &quot;The Bund (Instrumental)&quot; was released in 2008 on the group&#x27;s &quot;Day – Night (Instrumentals)&quot; album. 

The Bund was featured in the premiere of &quot;The Amazing Race 21&quot;, the finale of &quot;The Amazing Race: China Rush 1&quot;, and the premiere of &quot;The Amazing Race: China Rush 3&quot;. The Bund is one of the playable stages in &quot;The King of Fighters XIV&quot;.

<doc id="453172" wikidata="Q6088" url="?curid=453172" title="Alessandria">
<text>Alessandria (; , ) is a city and commune in Piedmont, Italy, and the capital of the Province of Alessandria. It is also the largest municipality of the region. The city is sited on the alluvial plain between the Tanaro and the Bormida rivers, about east of Turin.

Alessandria is also a major railway hub.

==History==
Alessandria was founded in 1168 with a charter as a free comune; it was sited upon a preexisting urban nucleus, to serve as a stronghold for the Lombard League, defending the traditional liberties of the communes of northern Italy against the Imperial forces of Frederick Barbarossa. Alessandria stood in the territories of the marchese of Montferrat, a staunch ally of the Emperor, with a name assumed in 1168 to honour the Emperor&#x27;s opponent, Pope Alexander III. In 1174–1175 the fortress was sorely tested by the Imperial siege and stood fast. A legend (related in Umberto Eco&#x27;s book &quot;Baudolino&quot;, and which recalls one concerning Bishop Herculanus’ successful defence of Perugia several centuries earlier) says it was saved by a quick-witted peasant, Gagliaudo: he fed his cow with the last grain remaining within the city, then took it outside the city walls until he reached the Imperial camp. Here he was captured, and his cow cut open to be cooked: when the Imperials found the cow&#x27;s stomach filled with grain, Gagliaudo was asked the reason to waste such a rich meal. He answered that he was forced to feed his cow with grain because there was such a lot of it, and no room to place it within the city. The Emperor, fearing that the siege would last too long, left Alessandria free (malaria was probably the real cause of his departure). A statue of Gagliaudo can be found on the left corner of the city cathedral.

Alessandria entered into jealous conflicts with the older communes of the region, in particular with Asti.

In 1348 Alessandria fell into the hands of the Visconti. In 1391 the army of Gian Galeazzo Visconti, commanded by Jacopo dal Verme, heavily defeated the French army led by Jean III of Armagnac in Alessandria. In 1450 Alessandria passed with their possessions to the Sforza, following the career of Milan, until 1707, when it was ceded to the House of Savoy and henceforth formed part of Piedmont. The new domination was evidenced by the construction of a new big &quot;Cittadella&quot; on the left side of the river Tanaro, across from the city.

With Napoleon&#x27;s success at the Battle of Marengo (1800), Alessandria fell to France and became the capital of the Napoleonic Département of Marengo. During this period another substantial fort was built to the north of the city containing impressive and substantial barracks which are still used as military headquarters and stores (2006). The remains of a second fort to the south of the city (Cristo quarter) have been sliced in two by a railway (Forte ferrovia); a third one still remains in the middle of the same quarter (Forte Acqui).

From 1814 Alessandria was Savoyard territory once more, part of the Kingdom of Sardinia. During the years of the Risorgimento, Alessandria was an active centre of the liberals.

In a suburb, Spinetta Marengo, the Battle of Marengo is reenacted annually, on 14 June.

Alessandria was the first capital of an Italian province to be governed by a Socialist: the clockmaker Paolo Sacco was elected mayor on 25 July 1899.

 Owing to its marshalling yard and the bridges on the Tanaro and Bormida, Alessandria was a strategic military target during World War II and was subjected to intense Allied bombing (especially during Operation Strangle), the most serious being the raids of 30 April 1944, with 238 dead and hundreds wounded, and 5 April 1945, with 160 deaths, among them 60 children from the children&#x27;s asylum in Via Gagliaudo. Altogether, 559 people were killed by air raids on Alessandria, which destroyed or badly damaged a thousand buildings. On 29 April 1945 the city was liberated from the German occupation (1943–1945) by the partisan resistance and troops of Brazilian Expeditionary Force.

On 6 November 1994 the Tanaro flooded a large part of the city, causing major damage, especially in the Orti quarter.

===Jewish history===
The first known Jews in Alessandria, named Abraham (son of Joseph Vitale de Sacerdoti Cohen) opened a loan bank in or about 1490. In 1590, the Jews were expelled from the Duchy of Milan, and one of Abraham&#x27;s descendants travelled to Madrid, which ruled the Duchy and was permitted to stay in the town due to a large sum owed him by the government. Of the 230 Jews living in the city in 1684, 170 were members of the Vitale family. The Jewish Ghetto was established in 1724. Between 1796 and 1814, among the rest of Italian Jewry, the city Jewish congregation was emancipated, under French influence. According to Benito Mussolini&#x27;s census in 1938, the town had 101 Jews. On 13 December 1943 the synagogue on Via Milano was attacked by supporters of the Italian Social Republic. Books and manuscripts were taken out of the synagogue and were set on fire at Piazza Rattazzi. In total, 48 Jews were deported from the province of Alessandria, most of them to Auschwitz where they were murdered.

<doc id="453173" wikidata="Q1062374" url="?curid=453173" title="Chant royal">
<text>The Chant Royal is a poetic form that is a variation of the ballad form and consists of five eleven-line stanzas with a rhyme scheme and a five-line envoi rhyming or a seven-line envoi (capital letters indicate lines repeated verbatim). To add to the complexity, no rhyming word is used twice. It was introduced into French poetry in the 15th century by Christine de Pizan and Charles d&#x27;Orléans and was introduced into England towards the end of the 19th century as part of a general revival of interest in French poetic forms. The complexity of the form caused William Caswell Jones to describe it as &quot;impractical&quot; for common use The Chant Royal was the most complicated form of poetry in Northern France during the 15th century, though not as complex as the sestina, which was more popular in Southern France. The form was often used for stately, or heroic subjects.

==An example==
&lt;poem style=&quot;margin-left:2em&quot;&gt;
The Dance of Death 
&quot;After Holbein &quot;
&quot;Contra vim Mortis
Non est medicamen in hortis.&quot;

He is the despots&#x27; Despot. All must bide, 
Later or soon, the message of his might; 
Princes and potentates their heads must hide, 
Touched by the awful sigil of his right; 
Beside the Kaiser he at eve doth wait 
And pours a potion in his cup of state; 
The stately Queen his bidding must obey; 
No keen-eyed Cardinal shall him affray; 
And to the Dame that wantoneth he saith-- 
&quot;Let be, Sweet-heart, to junket and to play.&quot; 
There is no King more terrible than Death.

The lusty Lord, rejoicing in his pride, 
He draweth down; before the armed Knight 
With jingling bridle-rein he still doth ride; 
He crosseth the strong Captain in the fight; 
The Burgher grave he beckons from debate; 
He hales the Abbot by his shaven pate, 
Nor for the Abbess&#x27; wailing will delay; 
No bawling Mendicant shall say him nay; 
E&#x27;en to the pyx the Priest he followeth, 
Nor can the Leech* his chilling finger stay . . . [doctor] 
There is no King more terrible than Death.

All things must bow to him. And woe betide 
The Wine-bibber,--the Roisterer by night; 
Him the feast-master, many bouts defied, 
Him &#x27;twixt the pledging and the cup shall smite; 
Woe to the Lender at usurious rate, 
The hard Rich Man, the hireling Advocate; 
Woe to the Judge that selleth Law for pay; 
Woe to the Thief that like a beast of prey 
With creeping tread the traveller harryeth:-- 
These, in their sin, the sudden sword shall slay . . . 
There is no King more terrible than Death.

He hath no pity, -- nor will be denied. 
When the low hearth is garnished and bright, 
Grimly he flingeth the dim portal wide, 
And steals the Infant in the Mother&#x27;s sight; 
He hath no pity for the scorned of fate:-- 
He spares not Lazarus lying at the gate, 
Nay, nor the Blind that stumbleth as he may; 
Nay, the tired Ploughman,--at the sinking ray,-- 
In the last furrow,--feels an icy breath, 
And knows a hand hath turned the team astray . . . 
There is no King more terrible than Death.

He hath no pity. For the new-made Bride, 
Blithe with the promise of her life&#x27;s delight, 
That wanders gladly by her Husband&#x27;s side, 
He with the clatter of his drum doth fright. 
He scares the Virgin at the convent grate; 
The Maid half-won, the Lover passionate; 
He hath no grace for weakness and decay: 
The tender Wife, the Widow bent and gray, 
The feeble Sire whose footstep faltereth,-- 
All these he leadeth by the lonely way . . . 
There is no King more terrible than Death.

Envoi
Youth, for whose ear and monishing of late, 
I sang of Prodigals and lost estate, 
Have thou thy joy of living and be gay; 
But know not less that there must come a day,-- 
Aye, and perchance e&#x27;en now it hasteneth,-- 
When thine own heart shall speak to thee and say,-- 
There is no King more terrible than Death.

—Austin Dobson&lt;/poem&gt;

<text>is a 1964 semi-autobiographical novel by Japanese writer Kenzaburō Ōe. It tells the story of a young father who must come to terms with the fact that his newborn son is severely mentally disabled.

==Plot==
The plot follows the story of Bird, a 27 year old Japanese man. The book starts with him wondering about a hypothetical trip to Africa, which is a recurrent theme in his mind throughout the story. Soon after day-dreaming about his trip and a brawl with a few local delinquents from the region, Bird receives a call from the doctor of the hospital regarding his newborn child, urging him to talk in person. After meeting with the doctor, he discovers that his son has been born with a brain hernia, although the fact is still obscure to his wife.

Bird is troubled by the revelation, and regrets having to inform the relatives of his wife about the facts concerning the state of the child, who is not expected to survive for long. Not long after, Bird meets an ex-girlfriend of his, called Himiko, who has, after her husband&#x27;s suicide, become a sexual deviant and eccentric. After a short philosophical discussion, both become drunk and Bird sleeps at Himiko&#x27;s, only to wake up on the morning after in a deep state of hangover from all the whisky he had drunk the day before. He vomits violently. After freshening up and readying himself for work, Bird goes to his teaching job at a cram school to teach English Literature. Whilst teaching, Bird suddenly becomes wildly nauseated and vomits in his classroom. The classmates disapprove of Bird&#x27;s behaviour, claiming that he&#x27;s a drunk and should be fired from his job. Bird worries that he might lose his job.

After the ordeal, he returns to the hospital, sure that his child should have died by now. When he asks the nurse concerning the baby, he is surprised to know that his child is still alive, and if still surviving after a few days, is expected to go through brain surgery, even though the prospects of him turning into a healthy normal child is non-existent. Bird struggles with this fact, and desires the child to die as soon as possible so as to not have the responsibility for the so-called &quot;monster baby&quot; to ruin his life and his prospects for travelling by himself to the African Continent. The internal psychological struggle that he has to go through makes him feel fear, anger and shame, towards the baby and himself.

A little while after, Bird goes to Himiko&#x27;s house and begins to make love to her. However, haunted by the ordeal of his dying child, Bird is unable to achieve an erection at the mention of the word &quot;pregnancy&quot; and &quot;womb&quot; uttered by Himiko, and ends up resorting to the practice of BDSM. He feels reluctant at first, but then concedes and is able to achieve orgasm with Himiko. When he goes back to the hospital, Bird has to lie to his wife concerning the state of the baby and its cranial condition, claiming that it is an unknown organ failure that is causing the baby to suffer. He does not admit that he expects the baby&#x27;s death.

Back at his cram school job, he meets one of his friendly students who wishes to claim that the vomit incident the earlier day was caused by food poisoning, and not hangover, in order for Bird have better chances of not being fired. Bird appreciates this offer, but decides to come clean to his superiors regarding the incident. After the meeting with his supervisor, he is let go of his job. Bird realizes that now he has no prospects for ever travelling to Africa, and worries about his hospital bills and financial situation.

Bird tries to escape his responsibility for the child and his crumbling relationship with his wife, turning to alcohol and Himiko. Eventually, he is fired from his job teaching at a cram school in the process. He half attempts to kill the child, albeit indirectly, and is forced to decide whether he wants to keep the child.

&quot;A Personal Matter&quot; was translated into English by John Nathan and published by Grove Press in 1968.

<text>The Nixie, Nixy, Nix, Näcken, Nicor, Nøkk, or Nøkken (; , ; ; Norwegian ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; or ) are humanoid, and often shapeshifting water spirits in Germanic mythology and folklore.

Under a variety of names, they are common to the stories of all Germanic peoples, although they are perhaps best known from Scandinavian folklore. The related English &quot;knucker&quot; was generally depicted as a worm or dragon, although more recent versions depict the spirits in other forms. Their sex, bynames, and various transformations vary geographically. The German  and his Scandinavian counterparts were male. The German was a female river mermaid. Similar creatures are known from other parts of Europe, such as the Melusine in France, the Xana in Asturias (Spain), and the Slavic water spirits (e.g., the Rusalka) in Slavic countries.

==Names and etymology==
The names are held to derive from Common Germanic or , derived from PIE (&quot;to wash&quot;). They are related to Sanskrit , Greek and , and Irish (all meaning to wash or be washed). The form &quot;neck&quot; appears in English and Swedish (, definite form &quot;näcken&quot;). The Swedish form is derived from Old Swedish , which corresponds to Old Icelandic ( ), and in Norwegian Nynorsk. In Finnish, the word is . In Old Danish, the form was and in modern Danish and Norwegian Bokmål it is /. The Icelandic and Faroese are horselike creatures. In Middle Low German, it was called and in Middle Dutch (compare also or plus ). The Old High German form also meant &quot;crocodile&quot;, while the Old English could mean both a &quot;water monster&quot; like those encountered by Beowulf, and a &quot;hippopotamus&quot;. The Norwegian and Swedish are related figures sometimes seen as by-names for the same creature. The southern Scandinavian version can take on the form of a horse named (&quot;the brook horse&quot;), similar to other water horses such as the Scottish &quot;kelpie&quot; and the Welsh .

==England==
English folklore contains many creatures with similar characteristics to the &quot;Nix&quot; or . These include Jenny Greenteeth, the Shellycoat, the river-hag Peg Powler, the -like Brag, and the Grindylow.

At Lyminster, near Arundel in the English county of West Sussex, there are today said to dwell &quot;water-wyrms&quot; called knuckers, in a pool called the &quot;Knucker-hole&quot;. The Victorian authority Walter William Skeat had plausibly suggested the pool&#x27;s name of &quot;knucker&quot; (a name attested from 1835, Horsfield) was likely derived from the Old English , a creature-name found in &quot;Beowulf&quot;.

==The Nordic countries==
===Näck, Nøkk===

The Nordic , , were male water spirits who played enchanted songs on the violin, luring women and children to drown in lakes or streams. However, not all of these spirits were necessarily malevolent; many stories indicate at the very least that were entirely harmless to their audience and attracted not only women and children but men as well with their sweet songs. Stories also exist wherein the spirit agrees to live with a human who had fallen in love with him. Still, many of these stories ended with the returning to his home, usually a nearby waterfall or brook. The were said to grow despondent unless they had free, regular contact with a water source.

The Norwegian or , Swedish , is a related figure who, if properly approached, will teach a musician to play so adeptly &quot;that the trees dance and waterfalls stop at his music&quot;.

It is difficult to describe the appearance of the nix, as one of his central attributes was thought to be shapeshifting. Perhaps he did not have any true shape. He could show himself as a man playing the violin in brooks and waterfalls (though often imagined as fair and naked today, in folklore, he was more frequently described as wearing more or less elegant clothing) but also could appear to be treasure or various floating objects, or as an animal—most commonly in the form of a &quot;brook horse&quot; (see below). The modern Scandinavian names are derived from , meaning &quot;river horse&quot;. Thus, it is likely that the figure of the brook horse preceded the personification of the nix as the &quot;man in the rapids&quot;. and derivatives were almost always portrayed as gorgeous young men whose clothing (or lack thereof) varied widely from story to story.

The enthralling music of the was most dangerous to women and children, especially pregnant women and unbaptised children. He was thought to be most active during Midsummer&#x27;s Night, Christmas Eve, and Thursdays. However, these superstitions do not necessarily relate to all the versions listed here. Many, if not all, developed after the Christianizing of the northern countries, as was the case of similar stories of faeries and other entities in other areas.

When malicious attempted to carry off people, they could be defeated by calling their name; this was believed to cause their death.

Another belief was that if a person bought the a treat of three drops of blood, a black animal, some (Scandinavian vodka) or (wet snuff) dropped into the water, he would teach his enchanting form of music.

The was also an omen for drowning accidents. He would scream at a particular spot in a lake or river in a way reminiscent of the loon, and a fatality would later occur on that spot. He was also said to cause drownings, but swimmers could protect themselves against such a fate by throwing a bit of steel into the water.

In the later Romantic folklore and folklore-inspired stories of the 19th century, the sings about his loneliness and his longing for salvation, which he purportedly never shall receive, as he is not &quot;a child of God&quot;. In a poem by Swedish poet E. J. Stagnelius, a little boy pities the fate of the (), and so saves his own life. In the poem, arguably Stagnelius&#x27;s most famous, the boy says that the will never be a &quot;child of God&quot;, which brings &quot;tears to his face&quot; as he &quot;never plays again in the silvery brook&quot;.

On a similar theme, a 19th-century text called &quot;Brother Fabian&#x27;s Manuscript&quot; by Sebastian Evans has this verse:

(The source has &quot;bloometh&quot; for &quot;boometh&quot;, but this is an error; a bittern is not a plant but a bird, and it is known for its booming call. A &quot;ghittern&quot; is a guitar. The spelling &quot;Nickar&quot; &quot;vice&quot; &quot;Neckar&quot; is sometimes used.)

In Scandinavia, water lilies are called &quot;nix roses&quot; (/). A tale from the forest of Tiveden relates that a father promised his daughter to a who offered him great hauls of fish in a time of need; she refused and stabbed herself to death, staining the water lilies red from that time on:
===In horse form===
In Faroese, the word refers specifically to a supernatural horse, described in one Faroese text thus:

The equivalent term in Continental Scandinavian languages is or (&#x27;brook horse&#x27;). It has a close parallel in the Scottish kelpie and the Welsh .

The was often described as a majestic white horse that would appear near rivers, particularly during foggy weather. Anyone who climbed onto its back could not get off again. The horse would then jump into the river, drowning the rider. The brook horse could also be harnessed and made to plough, either because it was trying to trick a person or because the person had tricked the horse into it. The following tale is a good illustration of the brook horse:
==Germany==
The German &quot;Nix&quot; and &quot;Nixe&quot; (and &quot;Nixie&quot;) are types of river merman and mermaid who may lure men into drowning, like the Scandinavian type, akin to the Melusine and similar to the Greek Siren. The German epic &quot;Nibelungenlied&quot; mentions the nix in connection with the Danube, as early as 1180 to 1210.

Nixes in folklore became water sprites who try to lure people into the water. The males can assume many different shapes, including that of a human, a fish, and a snake. The females bear the tail of a fish. When they are in human form, they can be recognised by the wet hem of their clothes. The Nixes are portrayed as malicious in some stories but harmless and friendly in others.

The 1779 poem Der Fischer by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe handles of a fisherman who meets his end when he is lured into the water by a Nixe

By the 19th century, Jacob Grimm mentions the Nixie to be among the &quot;water-sprites&quot; who love music, song, and dancing, and says, &quot;Like the sirens, the Nixie by her song draws listening youth to herself, and then into the deep.&quot; According to Grimm, they can appear human but have the barest hint of animal features: the nix had &quot;a slit ear&quot;, and the Nixie had &quot;a wet skirt&quot;. Grimm thinks these could symbolise they are &quot;higher beings&quot; who could shapeshift to animal form.

One famous Nixe of recent German folklore, deriving from 19th-century literature, was Lorelei; according to the legend, she sat on the rock at the Rhine which now bears her name and lured fishermen and boatmen to the dangers of the reefs with the sound of her voice. In Switzerland, there is a legend of a sea-maid or Nixe that lived in Lake Zug (the lake is in the Canton of Zug).

&quot;The Yellow Fairy Book&quot; by Andrew Lang includes a story called &quot;The Nixie of the Mill-Pond&quot; in which a malevolent spirit that lives in a mill pond strikes a deal with the miller that she will restore his wealth in exchange for his son. This story is taken from &quot;Grimms&#x27; Fairy Tales&quot;.

The legend of Heer Halewijn, a dangerous lord who lures women to their deaths with a magic song, may have originated with the nix.

Alternate names for the female German Nixe are Rhine maidens () and Lorelei.

In a fictional depiction, the Rhine maidens are among the protagonists in the four-part Opera &quot;Der Ring des Nibelungen&quot; by the composer Richard Wagner, based loosely on the nix of the &quot;Nibelungenlied&quot;.

The Rhine maidens Wellgunde, Woglinde, and Floßhilde (Flosshilde) belong to a group of characters living in a part of nature free from human influence. Erda and the Norns are also considered a part of this &#x27;hidden&#x27; world.

They are first seen in the first work of the Nibelungen cycle, &quot;Das Rheingold&quot;, as guardians of the &quot;Rheingold&quot;, a treasure of gold hidden in the Rhein river. The dwarf Alberich, a Nibelung, is eager to win their favour, but they somewhat cruelly dismiss his flattery. They tell him that only one who cannot love can win the &quot;Rheingold&quot;. Thus, Alberich curses love and steals the &quot;Rheingold&quot;. From the stolen gold, he forges a ring of power. Further in the cycle, the Rhine maidens are seen trying to regain the ring and transform it into the harmless &quot;Rheingold&quot;. But no one will return the ring to them; not even the supreme god Wotan, who uses the ring to pay the giants Fasolt and Fafner for building Valhalla, nor the hero Siegfried, when the maidens appear to him in the third act of &quot;Götterdämmerung&quot;. Eventually, Brünnhilde returns it to them at the end of the cycle, when the fires of her funeral pyre cleanse the ring of its curse.

Descendants of German immigrants to Pennsylvania sometimes refer to a mischievous child as &quot;nixie&quot;.

== In popular culture ==
In &quot;The Nixie&#x27;s Song&quot;, the first book in the children&#x27;s series Beyond the Spiderwick Chronicles, the main characters rescue a Nixie named Taloa after fire-breathing giants destroy her pond. Nixies are depicted as aquatic female humanoids related to mermaids but with frog-like legs instead of tails.

In the 2019 film &quot;Frozen II&quot;, Queen Elsa of Arendelle encounters and tames the Nøkk (in the form of a horse), the Water spirit who guards the sea to the mythical river Ahtohallan.

<doc id="453186" wikidata="Q209239" url="?curid=453186" title="Columba (genus)">
<text>The bird genus Columba comprises a genus of medium to large pigeons. The terms &quot;dove&quot; and &quot;pigeon&quot; are used indiscriminately for smaller and larger Columbidae, respectively. &quot;Columba&quot; species are mostly termed &quot;pigeons&quot;, and in many cases &quot;wood pigeons&quot;, but some (including the type species of the genus), are termed &quot;doves&quot;. The rock dove (&quot;C. livia&quot;) has given rise to the majority of domesticated pigeon breeds, such as the racing pigeon and the fantail pigeon, some of which have become feral. Meanwhile, &quot;wood pigeon&quot; by itself usually means the common wood pigeon (&quot;C. palumbus&quot;).

This genus as understood today is native to the Old World, but some (notably the domestic and feral rock dove) have been introduced outside their natural range, for example in the Americas.

==Etymology==
The term &quot;columba&quot; comes from the Latin &quot;columba&quot;, &quot;a dove&quot;, the feminine form of &quot;columbus&quot;, &quot;a male dove&quot;, itself the latinisation of the Greek κόλυμβος (&quot;kolumbos&quot;), &quot;diver&quot;, which derives from the verb κολυμβάω (&quot;kolumbaō&quot;), &quot;to dive, plunge headlong, swim&quot;. The feminine form of &quot;kolumbos&quot;, κολυμβίς (&quot;kolumbis&quot;), &quot;diver&quot;, was the name applied by Aristophanes and others to the common rock doves of Greece, because of the &quot;swimming&quot; motion made by their wings when flying.

==Taxonomy==
The genus &quot;Columba&quot; was introduced by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in 1758 in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. The type species was designated as the stock dove (&quot;Columba oenas&quot;) by Irish zoologist Nicholas Aylward Vigors in 1825.

The American pigeons formerly included in &quot;Columba&quot; are now split off as a separate genus &quot;Patagioenas&quot;. That the American radiation constitutes a distinct lineage is borne out by molecular evidence; in fact, the genus &quot;Patagioenas&quot; is basal to the split between the genus &quot;Columba&quot; and the genus &quot;Streptopelia&quot;. &quot;Columba&quot;, together with &quot;Streptopelia&quot; and the smaller genera &quot;Nesoenas&quot; and &quot;Spilopelia&quot; (syn. &quot;Stigmatopelia&quot;), constitute the dominant evolutionary radiation of the subfamily Columbinae in Eurasia and Africa. The taxonomic status of some African pigeons presently placed here is in need of further study; they are smaller than the usual &quot;Columba&quot;, and differ in some other aspects. &quot;Columba larvata&quot; (lemon dove) in particular might be separable in the genus &quot;Aplopelia&quot;. That notwithstanding, the lineage of the typical pigeons probably diverged from its closest relatives in the Late Miocene, perhaps some 7-8 million years ago (Ma).

===Species===

There are 35 species recognised in the genus, of which two are extinct:
* Rock dove, &quot;Columba livia&quot;
* Hill pigeon, &quot;Columba rupestris&quot;
* Snow pigeon, &quot;Columba leuconota&quot;

* White-collared pigeon, &quot;Columba albitorques&quot;
* Stock dove, &quot;Columba oenas&quot;
* Yellow-eyed pigeon, &quot;Columba eversmanni&quot;
* Somali pigeon, &quot;Columba oliviae&quot;
* Common wood pigeon or wood pigeon, &quot;Columba palumbus&quot;
* Trocaz pigeon, &quot;Columba trocaz&quot;
* Bolle&#x27;s pigeon, &quot;Columba bollii&quot;
* Laurel pigeon, &quot;Columba junoniae&quot;

* African olive pigeon, &quot;Columba arquatrix&quot;
* Cameroon olive pigeon, &quot;Columba sjostedti&quot;
* São Tomé olive pigeon, &quot;Columba thomensis&quot;
* Comoro olive pigeon, &quot;Columba pollenii&quot;
* Speckled wood pigeon, &quot;Columba hodgsonii&quot;
* White-naped pigeon, &quot;Columba albinucha&quot;
* Ashy wood pigeon, &quot;Columba pulchricollis&quot;
* Nilgiri wood pigeon, &quot;Columba elphinstonii&quot;
* Sri Lanka wood pigeon, &quot;Columba torringtoniae&quot;
* Pale-capped pigeon, &quot;Columba punicea&quot;
* Silvery pigeon, &quot;Columba argentina&quot; – (thought to be extinct, rediscovered in 2008)
* Andaman wood pigeon, &quot;Columba palumboides&quot;
* Black wood pigeon or Japanese wood pigeon, &quot;Columba janthina&quot;
* † Bonin wood pigeon, &quot;Columba versicolor&quot; – extinct ()
* † Ryukyu wood pigeon, &quot;Columba jouyi&quot; – extinct (late 1930s)
* Metallic pigeon or white-throated pigeon, &quot;Columba vitiensis&quot;
* White-headed pigeon, &quot;Columba leucomela&quot;
* Yellow-legged pigeon, &quot;Columba pallidiceps&quot;
* Eastern bronze-naped pigeon, &quot;Columba delegorguei&quot;
* Western bronze-naped pigeon, &quot;Columba iriditorques&quot;
* Island bronze-naped pigeon, &quot;Columba malherbii&quot;
* Lemon dove, &quot;Columba larvata&quot; – sometimes placed in &quot;Aplopelia&quot;

A fossil species, &quot;C. omnisanctorum&quot;, was described from the Early Pliocene (5.3-3.6 Ma) of the Gargano Peninsula and surroundings, Italy. A supposed &quot;falcon&quot; fossil from nearby contemporary and Middle Pliocene (3.6-2.6 Ma) sites may either be of the same species or another pigeon; the name &quot;Columba pisana&quot; would apply for it or (if conspecific) for both. &quot;C. melitensis&quot; is a fossil pigeon from the Late Pleistocene of Malta. Only known from a coracoid described by Richard Lydekker in 1891, whether it is indeed distinct from the living species and not just a paleosubspecies needs to be studied, given its late age. Indeterminate remains of a &quot;Columba&quot; were also found in Late Pliocene/Early Pleistocene (ELMMZ MN 17) deposits at Varshets (Bulgaria) and Šandalja (Croatia).

Another prehistoric pigeon, &quot;C. congi&quot;, was described from Early Pleistocene remains found in the famous Zhoukoudian caves in China. This, too, needs to be studied regarding whether it is not just an ancestral population of a still-living species. An extinct pigeon, the Mauritian wood pigeon (&quot;Columba thiriouxi&quot;), was described in 2011. The validity of the species has been challenged and it is not generally recognised. The holotype is a right tarsometatarsus collected in 1910.

<text>The Huangpu (), formerly romanized as Whangpoo, is a river flowing north through Shanghai. The Bund and Lujiazui are located along the Huangpu River.

The Huangpu is the biggest river in central Shanghai, with the Suzhou Creek being its major tributary. It is on average wide and deep, and divides the city into two regions: Puxi (&quot;west of Huangpu&quot;), the traditional city center, and Pudong (&quot;east of Huangpu&quot;).

==Bridges==
*Fengpu Bridge
*Lupu Bridge, opened 2003.
*Minpu Bridge
*Minpu Bridge No. 2
**The lower deck of this bridge carries Line 5 across the Huangpu River. This is the first line of the Shanghai Metro to cross the river via a bridge.
*Nanpu Bridge, opened 1991.
*Songpu Bridge, opened 1975 railway, 1976 highway.
*Songpu Bridge No. 2
*Songpu Bridge No. 3
*Xupu Bridge, opened 1997.
*Yangpu Bridge, opened 1993.

The following roadways, highways, and railways also cross the Huangpu River via a bridge:

*G1503 Shanghai Ring Expressway
*G50 Shanghai–Chongqing Expressway
*G60 Shanghai–Kunming Expressway
*Zhufeng Highway
*Huqingping Highway
*Shanghai–Hangzhou railway

==Tunnels==
A number lines of the Shanghai Metro cross underneath the river, including Line 12, Line 4, Line 2, Line 9, Line 4 (twice), Line 8, Line 13, and Line 11 (from north to south geographically).

There are several roadways which cross the Huangpu river via a tunnel, including:

*Bund Sightseeing Tunnel
*Dalian Road tunnel
*Dapu Road tunnel
*East Fuxing Road tunnel
*East Yan&#x27;an Road tunnel
*Jiangpu Road tunnel (planned)
*Jungong Road tunnel
*Longyao Road tunnel
*Lujiabang Road tunnel (planned)
*Luoxiu Road tunnel (planned)
*Nenjiang Road tunnel (planned)
*Outer Ring Road tunnel
*Renmin Road tunnel
*Shangzhong Road tunnel
*South Hongmei Road tunnel
*South Wanping Road tunnel (planned)
*South Xizang Road tunnel
*West Changjiang Road tunnel (under construction)
*Xiangyin Road tunnel
*Xinjian Road tunnel
*Yinxing Road tunnel (planned)
*Zhoujiazui Road tunnel (planned)

== Ferries ==
There are currently several ferry lines operated by Shanghai Ferry. Numerous tour boats also ply the harbour in the Pudong area.

== Controversy ==

In March 2013, some 16,000 pig carcasses were found floating in the Huangpu River in Shanghai. Some of the pigs carried ear tags saying they were from Jiaxing, so that city in Zhejiang may be the source; One news agency indicates that dead pigs are often dumped into rivers in China to avoid the disposal cost.

However local farmers deny the dumping allegation.

<text>Scarlet Diva is a 2000 Italian drama film by actress and first-time director and screenwriter Asia Argento.

==Plot summary==
&quot;Scarlet Diva&quot; is a semi-autobiographical film about the Italian actress and director Asia Argento&#x27;s life as an actress. A self-destructive streak in Anna Battista (Argento) pulls her into drugs, sex and other excesses. To combat this descent, she attempts to fulfill her creative side by becoming a film director. Battista&#x27;s attempts to realize her talent are thwarted by her desires and the uncaring responses of those around her. As part of her plans to become a director and bring her story to the screen, Battista travels to Los Angeles but only meets a shady film producer (Joe Coleman). She falls in love with an uncaring Australian rock and roll star (Jean Sheperd), then finds out she is pregnant by him. But her life is still in disarray as she uses drugs to help herself feel better.

==Cast==

* Asia Argento as Anna Battista
**Gloria Pirrocco as Young Anna
* Jean Sheperd as Kirk Vaines
* Herbert Fritsch as Aaron Ulrich 
* Francesca D&#x27;Aloja as Margherita
* Vera Gemma as Veronica Lanza
* Daria Nicolodi as Anna&#x27;s Mother
* Selen as Quelou
* Leo Gullotta as Dr. Vessi
* Joe Coleman as Mr. Paar
* Justinian Kfoury as J-Bird
* Schoolly D as Hash-Man
* Leonardo Servadio as Young Alioscia
* Paolo Bonacelli as Swiss Journalist

==Production==
&quot;Scarlet Diva&quot; was shot entirely on digital video, making it among the earliest feature films to be created with this technology.

Though penetration isn&#x27;t explicitly shown, Asia Argento revealed the sex scenes went way beyond acting. &quot;It&#x27;s true, the sex scenes are real. But I wasn&#x27;t interested in penetration. I was interested in showing what the real sex did to the faces and the bodies of the actors,&quot; she said.

==Harvey Weinstein reenactment scene==
In October 2017, Argento revealed that the scene in which the producer tries to assault the main character is based on the alleged 
sexual assault on her by Harvey Weinstein, except &quot;In the movie [...] I ran away&quot; according to Argento.

==Reception and legacy==
The film tied with two other films to win the Brooklyn Film Festival Award for Best New Director.

A videocassette of the film can be seen on a shelf behind the counter in a video rental store in Dario Argento&#x27;s film &quot;Do You Like Hitchcock?&quot;

<doc id="453198" wikidata="Q3290922" url="?curid=453198" title="Parametrization (geometry)">
<text>In mathematics, and more specifically in geometry, parametrization (or parameterization; also parameterisation, parametrisation) is the process of finding parametric equations of a curve, a surface, or, more generally, a manifold or a variety, defined by an implicit equation. The inverse process is called implicitization. &quot;To parameterize&quot; by itself means &quot;to express in terms of parameters&quot;.

Parametrization is a mathematical process consisting of expressing the state of a system, process or model as a function of some independent quantities called parameters. The state of the system is generally determined by a finite set of coordinates, and the parametrization thus consists of one function of several real variables for each coordinate. The number of parameters is the number of degrees of freedom of the system.

For example, the position of a point that moves on a curve in three-dimensional space is determined by the time needed to reach the point when starting from a fixed origin. If are the coordinates of the point, the movement is thus described by a parametric equation 
:formula_1
where is the parameter and denotes the time. Such a parametric equation completely determines the curve, without the need of any interpretation of as time, and is thus called a &quot;parametric equation&quot; of the curve (this is sometimes abbreviated by saying that one has a &quot;parametric curve&quot;). One similarly gets the parametric equation of a surface by considering functions of two parameters and .

== Non-uniqueness ==
Parametrizations are not generally unique. The ordinary three-dimensional object can be parametrized (or &quot;coordinatized&quot;) equally efficiently with Cartesian coordinates (&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, &quot;z&quot;), cylindrical polar coordinates (ρ, φ, &quot;z&quot;), spherical coordinates (&quot;r&quot;, φ, θ) or other coordinate systems.

Similarly, the color space of human trichromatic color vision can be parametrized in terms of the three colors red, green and blue, RGB, or with cyan, magenta, yellow and black, CMYK.

== Dimensionality ==
Generally, the minimum number of parameters required to describe a model or geometric object is equal to its dimension, and the scope of the parameters—within their allowed ranges—is the parameter space. Though a good set of parameters permits identification of every point in the object space, it may be that, for a given parametrization, different parameter values can refer to the same point. Such mappings are surjective but not injective. An example is the pair of cylindrical polar coordinates (ρ, φ, &quot;z&quot;) and (ρ, φ + 2π, &quot;z&quot;).

== Invariance ==
As indicated above, there is arbitrariness in the choice of parameters of a given model, geometric object, etc. Often, one wishes to determine intrinsic properties of an object that do not depend on this arbitrariness, which are therefore independent of any particular choice of parameters. This is particularly the case in physics, wherein parametrization invariance (or &#x27;reparametrization invariance&#x27;) is a guiding principle in the search for physically acceptable theories (particularly in general relativity).

For example, whilst the location of a fixed point on some curved line may be given by a set of numbers whose values depend on how the curve is parametrized, the length (appropriately defined) of the curve between &quot;two&quot; such fixed points will be independent of the particular choice of parametrization (in this case: the method by which an arbitrary point on the line is uniquely indexed). The length of the curve is therefore a parameterization-invariant quantity. In such cases parameterization is a mathematical tool employed to extract a result whose value does not depend on, or make reference to, the details of the parameterization. More generally, parametrization invariance of a physical theory implies that either the dimensionality or the volume of the parameter space is larger than is necessary to describe the physics (the quantities of physical significance) in question.

Though the theory of general relativity can be expressed without reference to a coordinate system, calculations of physical (i.e. observable) quantities such as the curvature of spacetime invariably involve the introduction of a particular coordinate system in order to refer to spacetime points involved in the calculation. In the context of general relativity then, the choice of coordinate system may be regarded as a method of &#x27;parameterizing&#x27; the spacetime, and the insensitivity of the result of a calculation of a physically-significant quantity to that choice can be regarded as an example of parameterization invariance.

As another example, physical theories whose observable quantities depend only on the &quot;relative&quot; distances (the ratio of distances) between pairs of objects are said to be scale invariant. In such theories any reference in the course of a calculation to an absolute distance would imply the introduction of a parameter to which the theory is invariant.

<text>Luce Caponegro (born December 17, 1966), also known by her stage name Selen, is an Italian actress, television presenter, director, and former pornographic actress.

==Early life==
Caponegro&#x27;s father was an Italian industrialist active in the petroleum industry. As a child, she attended courses in singing, classical dance, and horseback riding. After leaving home, she married at the age of 18 and lived in a commune without running water or a heating system until she was 20.

==Adult film career==
In her early twenties, she entered the adult video industry with her first pornographic film, &quot;Orgia di natale,&quot; directed by Cesare Geromini.

Her breakthrough came in 1993, at the age of 27, when director Alex Perry offered her a role in the film &quot;Signore Scandalose di Provincia&quot;. It is around this time that she adopted the stage name Selen.

She has been called &quot;Italy&#x27;s favorite porn star.&quot; She made appearances at the Hot d&#x27;Or pornographic festival in Cannes and at Erotica in Turin, winning 17 prizes during her career as a pornographic actress from 1993 to 1999.

Her last hardcore scenes were released in 2000 with the film &quot;Millennium&quot;. Although her last sex scene was filmed in 1999, she continued to appear in films as clips from her previous work were used in later hardcore films.

She has stated that she would not return to pornography in the future.

===Directors===
Selen starred in films by well-known Italian porn directors such as Mario Salieri (&quot;Dracula, Sceneggiata napoletana, Concetta Licata),&quot; Silvio Bandinelli (&quot;Il rosso e il nero, Cuore di pietra),&quot; and Joe D&#x27;Amato (&quot;Selvaggia, Sahara, Selen regina degli elefanti)&quot;. She played the title role in &quot;Cindy&quot;, directed by Luca Damiano.

==Film and television career==
Caponegro has presented the music programme &quot;Hot.&quot; She has made appearances in radio, hosting the show &quot;Lezioni di Sesso&quot; (Sex Lessons). Caponegro has also made appearances in theatre and advertisements. In 2004, she starred in the reality show &quot;La Fattoria&quot;. She has also appeared in &quot;Maurizio Costanzo Show&quot;, &quot;Uno Mattina&quot;, &quot;Domenica In&quot;, &quot;I Fatti Vostri&quot; and &quot;Omnibus&quot;. Caponegro had a part in Asia Argento&#x27;s 2000 film &quot;Scarlet Diva&quot;, which won the Williamsburg Brooklyn Film Festival Award for Best New Director.

==Personal life==
Caponegro lived in coastal Romagna. She has two sons, the first of whom, Kangi, was born in 1988 during her marriage with Fabio Albonetti, which has since ended in divorce. Her second son, Gabriele, was born in 2006 with her ex-partner Nicola Zanon. In 2006, she graduated from school and expressed a desire to enroll at a university.

<doc id="453204" wikidata="Q5571842" url="?curid=453204" title="Glossary of order theory">
<text>This is a glossary of some terms used in various branches of mathematics that are related to the fields of order, lattice, and domain theory. Note that there is a structured list of order topics available as well. Other helpful resources might be the following overview articles:

* completeness properties of partial orders
* distributivity laws of order theory

In the following, partial orders will usually just be denoted by their carrier sets. As long as the intended meaning is clear from the context, formula_1 will suffice to denote the corresponding relational symbol, even without prior introduction. Furthermore, &lt; will denote the strict order induced by formula_2

== A ==
* Acyclic. A binary relation is acyclic if it contains no &quot;cycles&quot;: equivalently, its transitive closure is antisymmetric.
* Adjoint. See &quot;Galois connection&quot;.
* Alexandrov topology. For a preordered set &quot;P&quot;, any upper set &quot;O&quot; is Alexandrov-open. Inversely, a topology is Alexandrov if any intersection of open sets is open.
* Algebraic poset. A poset is algebraic if it has a base of compact elements.
* Antichain. An antichain is a poset in which no two elements are comparable, i.e., there are no two distinct elements &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; such that &quot;x&quot; ≤ &quot;y&quot;. In other words, the order relation of an antichain is just the identity relation.
* Approximates relation. See &quot;way-below relation&quot;.
* Antisymmetric relation. A homogeneous relation &quot;R&quot; on a set &quot;X&quot; is antisymmetric, if &quot;x R y&quot; and &quot;y R x&quot; implies &quot;x = y&quot;, for all elements &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot; in &quot;X&quot;.
* Antitone. An antitone function &quot;f&quot; between posets &quot;P&quot; and &quot;Q&quot; is a function for which, for all elements &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot; of &quot;P&quot;, &quot;x&quot; ≤ &quot;y&quot; (in &quot;P&quot;) implies &quot;f&quot;(&quot;y&quot;) ≤ &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) (in &quot;Q&quot;). Another name for this property is &quot;order-reversing&quot;. In analysis, in the presence of total orders, such functions are often called monotonically decreasing, but this is not a very convenient description when dealing with non-total orders. The dual notion is called &quot;monotone&quot; or &quot;order-preserving&quot;.
* Asymmetric relation. A homogeneous relation &quot;R&quot; on a set &quot;X&quot; is asymmetric, if &quot;x R y&quot; implies &quot;not y R x&quot;, for all elements &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot; in &quot;X&quot;.
* Atom. An atom in a poset &quot;P&quot; with least element 0, is an element that is minimal among all elements that are unequal to 0.
* Atomic. An atomic poset &quot;P&quot; with least element 0 is one in which, for every non-zero element &quot;x&quot; of &quot;P&quot;, there is an atom &quot;a&quot; of &quot;P&quot; with &quot;a&quot; ≤ &quot;x&quot;.

== B ==

* Base. See &quot;continuous poset&quot;.
* Binary relation. A binary relation over two sets formula_3 is a subset of their Cartesian product formula_4
* Boolean algebra. A Boolean algebra is a distributive lattice with least element 0 and greatest element 1, in which every element &quot;x&quot; has a complement ¬&quot;x&quot;, such that &quot;x&quot; ∧ ¬&quot;x&quot; = 0 and &quot;x&quot; ∨ ¬&quot;x&quot; = 1.
* Bounded poset. A bounded poset is one that has a least element and a greatest element.
* Bounded complete. A poset is bounded complete if every of its subsets with some upper bound also has a least such upper bound. The dual notion is not common.

== C ==

* Chain. A chain is a totally ordered set or a totally ordered subset of a poset. See also .
* Chain complete. A partially ordered set in which every chain has a least upper bound.
* Closure operator. A closure operator on the poset &quot;P&quot; is a function &quot;C&quot; : &quot;P&quot; → &quot;P&quot; that is monotone, idempotent, and satisfies &quot;C&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) ≥ &quot;x&quot; for all &quot;x&quot; in &quot;P&quot;.
* Compact. An element &quot;x&quot; of a poset is compact if it is &quot;way below&quot; itself, i.e. &quot;x&quot;«&quot;x&quot;. One also says that such an &quot;x&quot; is .
* Comparable. Two elements &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; of a poset &quot;P&quot; are comparable if either &quot;x&quot; ≤ &quot;y&quot; or &quot;y&quot; ≤ &quot;x&quot;.
* Comparability graph. The comparability graph of a poset (&quot;P&quot;, ≤) is the graph with vertex set &quot;P&quot; in which the edges are those pairs of distinct elements of &quot;P&quot; that are comparable under ≤ (and, in particular, under its reflexive reduction &lt;).
* Complete Boolean algebra. A Boolean algebra that is a complete lattice.
* Complete Heyting algebra. A Heyting algebra that is a complete lattice is called a complete Heyting algebra. This notion coincides with the concepts &quot;frame&quot; and &quot;locale&quot;.
* Complete lattice. A complete lattice is a poset in which arbitrary (possibly infinite) joins (suprema) and meets (infima) exist.
* Complete partial order. A complete partial order, or cpo, is a directed complete partial order (q.v.) with least element.
* Complete relation. Synonym for &quot;Connected relation&quot;.
* Complete semilattice. The notion of a &quot;complete semilattice&quot; is defined in different ways. As explained in the article on completeness (order theory), any poset for which either all suprema or all infima exist is already a complete lattice. Hence the notion of a complete semilattice is sometimes used to coincide with the one of a complete lattice. In other cases, complete (meet-) semilattices are defined to be bounded complete cpos, which is arguably the most complete class of posets that are not already complete lattices.
* Completely distributive lattice. A complete lattice is completely distributive if arbitrary joins distribute over arbitrary meets.
* Completion. A completion of a poset is an order-embedding of the poset in a complete lattice.
* Completion by cuts. Synonym of Dedekind–MacNeille completion.
* Connected relation. A total or complete relation &quot;R&quot; on a set &quot;X&quot; has the property that for all elements &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot; of &quot;X&quot;, at least one of &quot;x R y&quot; or &quot;y R x&quot; holds.
* Continuous poset. A poset is continuous if it has a base, i.e. a subset &quot;B&quot; of &quot;P&quot; such that every element &quot;x&quot; of &quot;P&quot; is the supremum of a directed set contained in {&quot;y&quot; in &quot;B&quot; | &quot;y&quot;«&quot;x&quot;}.
* Continuous function. See &quot;Scott-continuous&quot;.
* Converse. The converse &lt;° of an order &lt; is that in which x &lt;° y whenever y &lt; x.
* Cover. An element &quot;y&quot; of a poset &quot;P&quot; is said to cover an element &quot;x&quot; of &quot;P&quot; (and is called a cover of &quot;x&quot;) if &quot;x&quot; &lt; &quot;y&quot; and there is no element &quot;z&quot; of &quot;P&quot; such that &quot;x&quot; &lt; &quot;z&quot; &lt; &quot;y&quot;.
* cpo. See &quot;complete partial order&quot;.

== D ==

* dcpo. See &quot;directed complete partial order&quot;.
* Dedekind–MacNeille completion. The Dedekind–MacNeille completion of a partially ordered set is the smallest complete lattice that contains it.
* Dense order. A dense poset &quot;P&quot; is one in which, for all elements &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; in &quot;P&quot; with &quot;x&quot; &lt; &quot;y&quot;, there is an element &quot;z&quot; in &quot;P&quot;, such that &quot;x&quot; &lt; &quot;z&quot; &lt; &quot;y&quot;. A subset &quot;Q&quot; of &quot;P&quot; is dense in &quot;P&quot; if for any elements &quot;x&quot; &lt; &quot;y&quot; in &quot;P&quot;, there is an element &quot;z&quot; in &quot;Q&quot; such that &quot;x&quot; &lt; &quot;z&quot; &lt; &quot;y&quot;.
* Derangement. A permutation of the elements of a set, such that no element appears in its original position. 
* Directed set. A non-empty subset &quot;X&quot; of a poset &quot;P&quot; is called directed, if, for all elements &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; of &quot;X&quot;, there is an element &quot;z&quot; of &quot;X&quot; such that &quot;x&quot; ≤ &quot;z&quot; and &quot;y&quot; ≤ &quot;z&quot;. The dual notion is called &quot;filtered&quot;.
* Directed complete partial order. A poset &quot;D&quot; is said to be a directed complete poset, or dcpo, if every directed subset of &quot;D&quot; has a supremum.
* Distributive. A lattice &quot;L&quot; is called distributive if, for all &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, and &quot;z&quot; in &quot;L&quot;, we find that &quot;x&quot; ∧ (&quot;y&quot; ∨ &quot;z&quot;) = (&quot;x&quot; ∧ &quot;y&quot;) ∨ (&quot;x&quot; ∧ &quot;z&quot;). This condition is known to be equivalent to its order dual. A meet-semilattice is distributive if for all elements &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot; and &quot;x&quot;, &quot;a&quot; ∧ &quot;b&quot; ≤ &quot;x&quot; implies the existence of elements &quot;a&#x27; &quot; ≥ &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&#x27; &quot; ≥ &quot;b&quot; such that &quot;a&#x27; &quot; ∧ &quot;b&#x27; &quot; = &quot;x&quot;. See also &quot;completely distributive&quot;.
* Domain. Domain is a general term for objects like those that are studied in domain theory. If used, it requires further definition.
* Down-set. See &quot;lower set&quot;.
* Dual. For a poset (&quot;P&quot;, ≤), the dual order &quot;P&quot;&quot;d&quot; = (&quot;P&quot;, ≥) is defined by setting &quot;x ≥ y&quot; if and only if &quot;y ≤ x&quot;. The dual order of &quot;P&quot; is sometimes denoted by &quot;P&quot;op, and is also called &quot;opposite&quot; or &quot;converse&quot; order. Any order theoretic notion induces a dual notion, defined by applying the original statement to the order dual of a given set. This exchanges ≤ and ≥, meets and joins, zero and unit.

== E ==

* Extension. For partial orders ≤ and ≤′ on a set &quot;X&quot;, ≤′ is an extension of ≤ provided that for all elements &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; of &quot;X&quot;, &quot;x&quot; ≤ &quot;y&quot; implies that &quot;x&quot; ≤′ &quot;y&quot;.

== F ==

* Filter. A subset &quot;X&quot; of a poset &quot;P&quot; is called a filter if it is a filtered upper set. The dual notion is called &quot;ideal&quot;.
* Filtered. A non-empty subset &quot;X&quot; of a poset &quot;P&quot; is called filtered, if, for all elements &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; of &quot;X&quot;, there is an element &quot;z&quot; of &quot;X&quot; such that &quot;z&quot; ≤ &quot;x&quot; and &quot;z&quot; ≤ &quot;y&quot;. The dual notion is called &quot;directed&quot;.
* Finite element. See &quot;compact&quot;.
* Frame. A frame &quot;F&quot; is a complete lattice, in which, for every &quot;x&quot; in &quot;F&quot; and every subset &quot;Y&quot; of &quot;F&quot;, the infinite distributive law &quot;x&quot; ∧ formula_5&quot;Y&quot; = formula_5{&quot;x&quot; ∧ &quot;y&quot; | &quot;y&quot; in &quot;Y&quot;} holds. Frames are also known as &quot;locales&quot; and as complete Heyting algebras.

== G ==

* Galois connection. Given two posets &quot;P&quot; and &quot;Q&quot;, a pair of monotone functions &quot;F&quot;:&quot;P&quot; → &quot;Q&quot; and &quot;G&quot;:&quot;Q&quot; → &quot;P&quot; is called a Galois connection, if &quot;F&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) ≤ &quot;y&quot; is equivalent to &quot;x&quot; ≤ &quot;G&quot;(&quot;y&quot;), for all &quot;x&quot; in &quot;P&quot; and &quot;y&quot; in &quot;Q&quot;. &quot;F&quot; is called the lower adjoint of &quot;G&quot; and &quot;G&quot; is called the upper adjoint of &quot;F&quot;.
* Greatest element. For a subset &quot;X&quot; of a poset &quot;P&quot;, an element &quot;a&quot; of &quot;X&quot; is called the greatest element of &quot;X&quot;, if &quot;x&quot; ≤ &quot;a&quot; for every element &quot;x&quot; in &quot;X&quot;. The dual notion is called &quot;least element&quot;.
* Ground set. The ground set of a poset (&quot;X&quot;, ≤) is the set &quot;X&quot; on which the partial order ≤ is defined.

== H ==

* Heyting algebra. A Heyting algebra &quot;H&quot; is a bounded lattice in which the function &quot;f&quot;&quot;a&quot;: &quot;H&quot; → &quot;H&quot;, given by &quot;f&quot;&quot;a&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) = &quot;a&quot; ∧ &quot;x&quot; is the lower adjoint of a Galois connection, for every element &quot;a&quot; of &quot;H&quot;. The upper adjoint of &quot;f&quot;&quot;a&quot; is then denoted by &quot;g&quot;&quot;a&quot;, with &quot;g&quot;&quot;a&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) = &quot;a&quot; ⇒; &quot;x&quot;. Every Boolean algebra is a Heyting algebra.
* Hasse diagram. A Hasse diagram is a type of mathematical diagram used to represent a finite partially ordered set, in the form of a drawing of its transitive reduction.
* Homogeneous relation. A homogeneous relation on a set formula_7 is a subset of formula_8 Said differently, it is a binary relation over formula_7 and itself.

== I ==

* Ideal. An ideal is a subset &quot;X&quot; of a poset &quot;P&quot; that is a directed lower set. The dual notion is called &quot;filter&quot;.
* Incidence algebra. The incidence algebra of a poset is the associative algebra of all scalar-valued functions on intervals, with addition and scalar multiplication defined pointwise, and multiplication defined as a certain convolution; see incidence algebra for the details.
* Infimum. For a poset &quot;P&quot; and a subset &quot;X&quot; of &quot;P&quot;, the greatest element in the set of lower bounds of &quot;X&quot; (if it exists, which it may not) is called the infimum, meet, or greatest lower bound of &quot;X&quot;. It is denoted by inf &quot;X&quot; or formula_10&quot;X&quot;. The infimum of two elements may be written as inf{&quot;x&quot;,&quot;y&quot;} or &quot;x&quot; ∧ &quot;y&quot;. If the set &quot;X&quot; is finite, one speaks of a finite infimum. The dual notion is called &quot;supremum&quot;.
* Interval. For two elements &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot; of a partially ordered set &quot;P&quot;, the &quot;interval&quot; [&quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot;] is the subset {&quot;x&quot; in &quot;P&quot; | &quot;a&quot; ≤ &quot;x&quot; ≤ &quot;b&quot;} of &quot;P&quot;. If &quot;a&quot; ≤ &quot;b&quot; does not hold the interval will be empty.
*Interval finite poset. A partially ordered set &quot;P&quot; is interval finite if every interval of the form {x in P | x ≤ a} is a finite set.
* Inverse. See &quot;converse&quot;.
* Irreflexive. A relation &quot;R&quot; on a set &quot;X&quot; is irreflexive, if there is no element &quot;x&quot; in &quot;X&quot; such that &quot;x R x&quot;.
* Isotone. See &quot;monotone&quot;.

== J ==

* Join. See &quot;supremum&quot;.

== L ==

* Lattice. A lattice is a poset in which all non-empty finite joins (suprema) and meets (infima) exist.
* Least element. For a subset &quot;X&quot; of a poset &quot;P&quot;, an element &quot;a&quot; of &quot;X&quot; is called the least element of &quot;X&quot;, if &quot;a&quot; ≤ &quot;x&quot; for every element &quot;x&quot; in &quot;X&quot;. The dual notion is called &quot;greatest element&quot;.
* The length of a chain is the number of elements less one. A chain with 1 element has length 0, one with 2 elements has length 1, etc.
* Linear. See &quot;total order&quot;.
* Linear extension. A linear extension of a partial order is an extension that is a linear order, or total order.
* Locale. A locale is a &quot;complete Heyting algebra&quot;. Locales are also called &quot;frames&quot; and appear in Stone duality and pointless topology.
* Locally finite poset. A partially ordered set &quot;P&quot; is &quot;locally finite&quot; if every interval [&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;] = {&quot;x&quot; in &quot;P&quot; | &quot;a&quot; ≤ &quot;x&quot; ≤ &quot;b&quot;} is a finite set.
* Lower bound. A lower bound of a subset &quot;X&quot; of a poset &quot;P&quot; is an element &quot;b&quot; of &quot;P&quot;, such that &quot;b&quot; ≤ &quot;x&quot;, for all &quot;x&quot; in &quot;X&quot;. The dual notion is called &quot;upper bound&quot;.
* Lower set. A subset &quot;X&quot; of a poset &quot;P&quot; is called a lower set if, for all elements &quot;x&quot; in &quot;X&quot; and &quot;p&quot; in &quot;P&quot;, &quot;p&quot; ≤ &quot;x&quot; implies that &quot;p&quot; is contained in &quot;X&quot;. The dual notion is called &quot;upper set&quot;.

== M ==

* Maximal chain. A chain in a poset to which no element can be added without losing the property of being totally ordered. This is stronger than being a saturated chain, as it also excludes the existence of elements either less than all elements of the chain or greater than all its elements. A finite saturated chain is maximal if and only if it contains both a minimal and a maximal element of the poset.
* Maximal element. A maximal element of a subset &quot;X&quot; of a poset &quot;P&quot; is an element &quot;m&quot; of &quot;X&quot;, such that &quot;m&quot; ≤ &quot;x&quot; implies &quot;m&quot; = &quot;x&quot;, for all &quot;x&quot; in &quot;X&quot;. The dual notion is called &quot;minimal element&quot;.
* Maximum element. Synonym of greatest element. For a subset &quot;X&quot; of a poset &quot;P&quot;, an element &quot;a&quot; of &quot;X&quot; is called the maximum element of &quot;X&quot; if &quot;x&quot; ≤ &quot;a&quot; for every element &quot;x&quot; in &quot;X&quot;. A maxim&quot;um&quot; element is necessarily maxim&quot;al&quot;, but the converse need not hold.
* Meet. See &quot;infimum&quot;.
* Minimal element. A minimal element of a subset &quot;X&quot; of a poset &quot;P&quot; is an element &quot;m&quot; of &quot;X&quot;, such that &quot;x&quot; ≤ &quot;m&quot; implies &quot;m&quot; = &quot;x&quot;, for all &quot;x&quot; in &quot;X&quot;. The dual notion is called &quot;maximal element&quot;.
* Minimum element. Synonym of least element. For a subset &quot;X&quot; of a poset &quot;P&quot;, an element &quot;a&quot; of &quot;X&quot; is called the minimum element of &quot;X&quot; if &quot;x&quot; ≥ &quot;a&quot; for every element &quot;x&quot; in &quot;X&quot;. A minim&quot;um&quot; element is necessarily minim&quot;al&quot;, but the converse need not hold.
* Monotone. A function &quot;f&quot; between posets &quot;P&quot; and &quot;Q&quot; is monotone if, for all elements &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot; of &quot;P&quot;, &quot;x&quot; ≤ &quot;y&quot; (in &quot;P&quot;) implies &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) ≤ &quot;f&quot;(&quot;y&quot;) (in &quot;Q&quot;). Other names for this property are &quot;isotone&quot; and &quot;order-preserving&quot;. In analysis, in the presence of total orders, such functions are often called monotonically increasing, but this is not a very convenient description when dealing with non-total orders. The dual notion is called &quot;antitone&quot; or &quot;order reversing&quot;.

== O ==

* Order-dual. The order dual of a partially ordered set is the same set with the partial order relation replaced by its converse.
* Order-embedding. A function &quot;f&quot; between posets &quot;P&quot; and &quot;Q&quot; is an order-embedding if, for all elements &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot; of &quot;P&quot;, &quot;x&quot; ≤ &quot;y&quot; (in &quot;P&quot;) is equivalent to &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) ≤ &quot;f&quot;(&quot;y&quot;) (in &quot;Q&quot;).
* Order isomorphism. A mapping &quot;f&quot;: &quot;P&quot; → &quot;Q&quot; between two posets &quot;P&quot; and &quot;Q&quot; is called an order isomorphism, if it is bijective and both &quot;f&quot; and &quot;f&quot;−1 are monotone functions. Equivalently, an order isomorphism is a surjective &quot;order embedding&quot;.
* Order-preserving. See &quot;monotone&quot;.
* Order-reversing. See &quot;antitone&quot;.

== P ==

* Partial order. A partial order is a binary relation that is reflexive, antisymmetric, and transitive. In a slight abuse of terminology, the term is sometimes also used to refer not to such a relation, but to its corresponding partially ordered set.
* Partially ordered set. A partially ordered set formula_11 or for short, is a set formula_12 together with a partial order formula_1 on formula_14
* Poset. A partially ordered set.
* Preorder. A preorder is a binary relation that is reflexive and transitive. Such orders may also be called or . The term is also used to denote an acyclic binary relation (also called an ).
* Preordered set. A preordered set formula_15 is a set formula_12 together with a preorder formula_1 on formula_14
* Preserving. A function &quot;f&quot; between posets &quot;P&quot; and &quot;Q&quot; is said to preserve suprema (joins), if, for all subsets &quot;X&quot; of &quot;P&quot; that have a supremum sup &quot;X&quot; in &quot;P&quot;, we find that sup{&quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;): &quot;x&quot; in &quot;X&quot;} exists and is equal to &quot;f&quot;(sup &quot;X&quot;). Such a function is also called join-preserving. Analogously, one says that &quot;f&quot; preserves finite, non-empty, directed, or arbitrary joins (or meets). The converse property is called &quot;join-reflecting&quot;.
* Prime. An &quot;I&quot; in a lattice &quot;L&quot; is said to be prime, if, for all elements &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; in &quot;L&quot;, &quot;x&quot; ∧ &quot;y&quot; in &quot;I&quot; implies &quot;x&quot; in &quot;I&quot; or &quot;y&quot; in &quot;I&quot;. The dual notion is called a &quot;prime filter&quot;. Equivalently, a set is a prime filter if and only if its complement is a prime ideal.
* Principal. A filter is called &quot;principal filter&quot; if it has a least element. Dually, a &quot;principal ideal&quot; is an ideal with a greatest element. The least or greatest elements may also be called &quot;principal elements&quot; in these situations.
* Projection (operator). A self-map on a partially ordered set that is monotone and idempotent under function composition. Projections play an important role in domain theory.
* Pseudo-complement. In a Heyting algebra, the element &quot;x&quot; ⇒; &quot;0&quot; is called the pseudo-complement of &quot;x&quot;. It is also given by sup{&quot;y&quot; : &quot;y&quot; ∧ &quot;x&quot; = 0}, i.e. as the least upper bound of all elements &quot;y&quot; with &quot;y&quot; ∧ &quot;x&quot; = 0.

== Q ==

* Quasiorder. See &quot;preorder&quot;.
* Quasitransitive. A relation is quasitransitive if the relation on distinct elements is transitive. Transitive implies quasitransitive and quasitransitive implies acyclic.

== R ==

* Reflecting. A function &quot;f&quot; between posets &quot;P&quot; and &quot;Q&quot; is said to reflect suprema (joins), if, for all subsets &quot;X&quot; of &quot;P&quot; for which the supremum sup{&quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;): &quot;x&quot; in &quot;X&quot;} exists and is of the form &quot;f&quot;(&quot;s&quot;) for some &quot;s&quot; in &quot;P&quot;, then we find that sup &quot;X&quot; exists and that sup &quot;X&quot; = &quot;s&quot; . Analogously, one says that &quot;f&quot; reflects finite, non-empty, directed, or arbitrary joins (or meets). The converse property is called &quot;join-preserving&quot;.
* Reflexive. A binary relation &quot;R&quot; on a set &quot;X&quot; is reflexive, if &quot;x R x&quot; holds for every element &quot;x&quot; in &quot;X&quot;.
* Residual. A dual map attached to a residuated mapping.
* Residuated mapping. A monotone map for which the preimage of a principal down-set is again principal. Equivalently, one component of a Galois connection.

== S ==

* Saturated chain. A chain in a poset such that no element can be added &quot;between two of its elements&quot; without losing the property of being totally ordered. If the chain is finite, this means that in every pair of successive elements the larger one covers the smaller one. See also maximal chain.
* Scattered. A total order is scattered if it has no densely ordered subset.
* Scott-continuous. A monotone function &quot;f&quot; : &quot;P&quot; → &quot;Q&quot; between posets &quot;P&quot; and &quot;Q&quot; is Scott-continuous if, for every directed set &quot;D&quot; that has a supremum sup &quot;D&quot; in &quot;P&quot;, the set {&quot;fx&quot; | &quot;x&quot; in &quot;D&quot;} has the supremum &quot;f&quot;(sup &quot;D&quot;) in &quot;Q&quot;. Stated differently, a Scott-continuous function is one that preserves all directed suprema. This is in fact equivalent to being continuous with respect to the Scott topology on the respective posets.
* Scott domain. A Scott domain is a partially ordered set which is a bounded complete algebraic cpo.
* Scott open. See &quot;Scott topology&quot;.
* Scott topology. For a poset &quot;P&quot;, a subset &quot;O&quot; is Scott-open if it is an upper set and all directed sets &quot;D&quot; that have a supremum in &quot;O&quot; have non-empty intersection with &quot;O&quot;. The set of all Scott-open sets forms a topology, the Scott topology.
* Semilattice. A semilattice is a poset in which either all finite non-empty joins (suprema) or all finite non-empty meets (infima) exist. Accordingly, one speaks of a join-semilattice or meet-semilattice.
* Smallest element. See &quot;least element&quot;.
* Sperner property of a partially ordered set
* Sperner poset
* Strictly Sperner poset
* Strongly Sperner poset
* Strict order. See . 
* Strict partial order. A strict partial order is a homogeneous binary relation that is transitive, irreflexive, and antisymmetric.
* Strict preorder. See . 
* Supremum. For a poset &quot;P&quot; and a subset &quot;X&quot; of &quot;P&quot;, the least element in the set of upper bounds of &quot;X&quot; (if it exists, which it may not) is called the supremum, join, or least upper bound of &quot;X&quot;. It is denoted by sup &quot;X&quot; or formula_5&quot;X&quot;. The supremum of two elements may be written as sup{&quot;x&quot;,&quot;y&quot;} or &quot;x&quot; ∨ &quot;y&quot;. If the set &quot;X&quot; is finite, one speaks of a finite supremum. The dual notion is called &quot;infimum&quot;.
* Suzumura consistency. A binary relation R is Suzumura consistent if &quot;x&quot; R∗ &quot;y&quot; implies that &quot;x&quot; R &quot;y&quot; or not &quot;y&quot; R &quot;x&quot;.
* Symmetric relation. A homogeneous relation &quot;R&quot; on a set &quot;X&quot; is symmetric, if &quot;x R y&quot; implies &quot;y R x&quot;, for all elements &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot; in &quot;X&quot;.

== T ==

* Top. See &quot;unit&quot;.
* Total order. A total order &quot;T&quot; is a partial order in which, for each &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; in &quot;T&quot;, we have &quot;x&quot; ≤ &quot;y&quot; or &quot;y&quot; ≤ &quot;x&quot;. Total orders are also called &quot;linear orders&quot; or &quot;chains&quot;.
* Total relation. Synonym for &quot;Connected relation&quot;.
* Transitive relation. A relation &quot;R&quot; on a set &quot;X&quot; is transitive, if &quot;x R y&quot; and &quot;y R z&quot; imply &quot;x R z&quot;, for all elements &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, &quot;z&quot; in &quot;X&quot;.
* Transitive closure. The transitive closure R∗ of a relation R consists of all pairs &quot;x&quot;,&quot;y&quot; for which there cists a finite chain &quot;x&quot; R &quot;a&quot;, &quot;a&quot; R &quot;b&quot;, ..., &quot;z&quot; R &quot;y&quot;.

== U ==

* Unit. The greatest element of a poset &quot;P&quot; can be called &quot;unit&quot; or just &quot;1&quot; (if it exists). Another common term for this element is top. It is the infimum of the empty set and the supremum of &quot;P&quot;. The dual notion is called &quot;zero&quot;.
* Up-set. See &quot;upper set&quot;.
* Upper bound. An upper bound of a subset &quot;X&quot; of a poset &quot;P&quot; is an element &quot;b&quot; of &quot;P&quot;, such that &quot;x&quot; ≤ &quot;b&quot;, for all &quot;x&quot; in &quot;X&quot;. The dual notion is called &quot;lower bound&quot;.
* Upper set. A subset &quot;X&quot; of a poset &quot;P&quot; is called an upper set if, for all elements &quot;x&quot; in &quot;X&quot; and &quot;p&quot; in &quot;P&quot;, &quot;x&quot; ≤ &quot;p&quot; implies that &quot;p&quot; is contained in &quot;X&quot;. The dual notion is called &quot;lower set&quot;.

== V ==

* Valuation. Given a lattice formula_7, a valuation formula_21 is strict (that is, formula_22), monotone, modular (that is, formula_23) and positive. Continuous valuations are a generalization of measures.

== W ==

* Way-below relation. In a poset &quot;P&quot;, some element &quot;x&quot; is &quot;way below&quot; &quot;y&quot;, written &quot;x&quot;«&quot;y&quot;, if for all directed subsets &quot;D&quot; of &quot;P&quot; which have a supremum, &quot;y&quot; ≤ &quot;sup D&quot; implies &quot;x&quot; ≤ &quot;d&quot; for some &quot;d&quot; in &quot;D&quot;. One also says that &quot;x&quot; approximates &quot;y&quot;. See also domain theory.
* Weak order. A partial order ≤ on a set &quot;X&quot; is a weak order provided that the poset (X, ≤) is isomorphic to a countable collection of sets ordered by comparison of cardinality.

== Z ==

* Zero. The least element of a poset &quot;P&quot; can be called &quot;zero&quot; or just &quot;0&quot; (if it exists). Another common term for this element is bottom. Zero is the supremum of the empty set and the infimum of &quot;P&quot;. The dual notion is called &quot;unit&quot;.

<text>Ensemble Studios was an American video game developer. It was founded by Tony Goodman in 1994 and incorporated the following year. It borrowed the name of Ensemble Corporation, a consulting firm founded by Goodman in 1990. It was acquired by Microsoft in 2001 and operated as an internal studio until 2009, when its development capabilities were officially disbanded. Ensemble developed many real-time strategy games, including the &quot;Age of Empires&quot; game series, &quot;Age of Mythology&quot;, and &quot;Halo Wars&quot;. In addition to game development, Ensemble Studios also made the Genie Game Engine used in &quot;Age of Empires&quot;, &quot;Age of Empires II: The Age of Kings&quot;, and &quot;Star Wars: Galactic Battlegrounds&quot;. The studio sold 20 million games and was worth an estimated $500 million.

==Games==
Ensemble Studios developed the &quot;Age of Empires&quot; game series of real-time strategy titles, comprising &quot;Age of Empires&quot;, &quot;Age of Empires II: The Age of Kings&quot; and &quot;Age of Empires III&quot;. They also released &quot;Age of Mythology&quot;, a spin-off from the original series. Expansion packs were also released for all their games including two for &quot;Age of Empires III&quot;. Their last release was the real-time strategy game called &quot;Halo Wars&quot; for Xbox 360.

==Closure and legacy==
In 1998, Rick Goodman left Ensemble Studios and started a new independent studio, Stainless Steel Studios.

In 2000, Brian Sullivan left Ensemble Studios and started a new independent studio, Iron Lore Entertainment, to develop the action role-playing game &quot;Titan Quest&quot;.

In 2001, Microsoft acquired Ensemble Studios for $100 million. Ensemble remained at their original location in a high-rise office in Dallas, Texas, until April 2008 when Microsoft moved them to the Shops at Legacy in Plano, the same location as GearBox Software. Their office was 50,000 square feet and designed to house 120 employees.

In 2008, Ensemble announced that it would close after the release of &quot;Halo Wars&quot; in 2009. According to multiple independent reports, all non-essential staff were laid off and remaining staff were given incentives to remain until the completion of the project. Microsoft issued an internal statement on September 10, 2008 which was then leaked to the public.

The company shut down on January 29, 2009. It was also stated at the time that at least two new studios were being formed by ES employees.

In February 2009, former Ensemble Studios head Tony Goodman started a new independent studio, Robot Entertainment, and a number of the existing employees have been offered a position in this company.

Following the announcement of Robot Entertainment, former Ensemble Studios producer David Rippy started a new independent studio, Bonfire Studios, composed entirely of former Ensemble staff members. Bonfire was later renamed Zynga Dallas through its acquisition by Zynga and released only one game as an independent company.

In 2008, a third studio called Newtoy, Inc. was created by several developers from Ensemble, which released &quot;Chess With Friends&quot; for the iPhone in November 2008, and &quot;Words With Friends&quot; in August 2009. Newtoy was also acquired by Zynga and renamed Zynga With Friends, a moniker off of Newtoy&#x27;s successful &#x27;with friends&#x27; series. Newtoy released two games while they were independent.

In March 2009, a fourth studio, Windstorm Studios, was founded by ex-staffer Dusty Monk as a one-man company. Dusty Monk later closed this studio on March 21, 2012 and joined Robot Entertainment with his former co-workers.

In June 2013, a fifth studio emerged, Boss Fight Entertainment, founded by previous employees of Ensemble Studios and Zynga Dallas. Boss Fight Entertainment is located in McKinney, Texas and is developing games for mobile platforms. The studio was acquired by Netflix Inc. in 2022.

<text>Head Hunters is the twelfth studio album by American pianist, keyboardist and composer Herbie Hancock, released October 26, 1973, on Columbia Records. Recording sessions for the album took place in the evening at Wally Heider Studios and Different Fur Trading Co. in San Francisco, California.

The album was a commercial and artistic breakthrough for Hancock, crossing over to funk and rock audiences and bringing jazz-funk fusion to mainstream attention, peaking at number 13 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. Hancock is featured with woodwind player Bennie Maupin from his previous sextet and new collaborators – bassist Paul Jackson, percussionist Bill Summers and drummer Harvey Mason. The latter group of collaborators, which would go on to be known as the Headhunters, also played on Hancock&#x27;s subsequent studio album &quot;Thrust&quot; (1974). All of the musicians (with the exception of Mason) play multiple instruments on the album.

==Structure and release==
&quot;Head Hunters&quot; followed a series of experimental albums by Hancock&#x27;s &quot;Mwandishi&quot; sextet: &quot;Mwandishi&quot;, &quot;Crossings&quot;, and &quot;Sextant&quot;, released between 1971 and 1973, a time when Hancock was looking for a new direction in which to take his music. He later reflected on moving away from this style:

For the new album, Hancock assembled a new band, the Headhunters, of whom only woodwind player Bennie Maupin had been a member of the &quot;Mwandishi&quot; sextet. Hancock handled all synthesizer parts himself (having shared these duties with Patrick Gleeson on &quot;Crossings&quot; and &quot;Sextant&quot;) and he decided against the use of guitar altogether, favoring instead the clavinet, one of the defining sounds on the album. The new band featured a tight rhythm section composed of Paul Jackson (bass) and Harvey Mason (drums), and the album has a relaxed, funky sensibility that gave it an appeal to a far wider audience. Among the defining moments of the emerging jazz fusion and jazz-funk movements, the album made jazz listeners out of R&amp;B fans and vice versa.

Of the four tracks on the album, &quot;Watermelon Man&quot; was the only one not written for the album. A hit from Hancock&#x27;s hard bop days, originally appearing on his first album &quot;Takin&#x27; Off&quot; (1962) and later covered by Mongo Santamaría, it was reworked by Hancock and Mason for this album, featuring Bill Summers blowing into a beer bottle in imitation of the hindewho flute used by the Mbuti Pygmies of Zaire. The track features heavy use of African percussion. &quot;Sly&quot; was dedicated to Sly Stone, leader of the funk band Sly and the Family Stone. &quot;Chameleon&quot; features a famous bassline played by Hancock on an ARP Odyssey synthesizer. Closing track &quot;Vein Melter&quot; is a slow-burner, predominantly featuring Hancock on Rhodes piano and Maupin on bass clarinet. Heavily edited versions of &quot;Chameleon&quot; and &quot;Vein Melter&quot; were released on two sides of a 45 RPM single.

The album was remixed for quadraphonic sound in 1974. Columbia released this mix on LP record in the Stereo Quadraphonic matrix format and 8-track tape. The quadraphonic mixes feature elements not heard in the stereo version, including an additional keyboard melody at the beginning of &quot;Sly&quot;. Surround sound versions of the album have been released a number of times on the Super Audio CD format. All of these SACD editions use a digital transfer of the original four-channel quad mix re-purposed into 5.1 surround sound.

&quot;Head Hunters&quot; became the biggest-selling jazz album of all time until surpassed by George Benson&#x27;s &quot;Breezin&#x27;&quot; in 1976.

The Headhunters band (with Mike Clark replacing Harvey Mason) worked with Hancock on a number of other albums, including &quot;Thrust&quot; (1974), &quot;Man-Child&quot; (1975), and &quot;Flood&quot; (1975), the latter of which was recorded live in Japan. The subsequent albums &quot;&quot;Secrets&quot;&quot; (1976) and &quot;Sunlight&quot; (1977), had widely diverging personnel. The Headhunters, with Hancock featured as a guest soloist, produced the albums &quot;Survival of the Fittest&quot; (1975) and &quot;Straight from the Gate&quot; (1978), the first of which was produced by Hancock and included the hit &quot;God Make Me Funky&quot;.

The image on the album cover, designed by Victor Moscoso, features Hancock wearing a mask based on the African &quot;kple kple&quot; mask of the Baoulé tribe of Ivory Coast. Positioned clockwise around Hancock from lower left are Mason, Jackson, Maupin, and Summers.

==Legacy==
In 2005, the album was ranked number 498 in the book version of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. While it was not included in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;&#x27;s original 2003 online version of the list, nor its 2012 revision, it was ranked at number 254 in the 2020 revision. &quot;Head Hunters&quot; was a key release in Hancock&#x27;s career and a defining moment in the genre of jazz, and has been an inspiration not only for jazz musicians, but also to funk, soul music, jazz funk and hip hop artists. The Library of Congress added it to the National Recording Registry, which collects &quot;culturally, historically or aesthetically important&quot; sound recordings from the 20th century.

<text>Fast Times at Ridgemont High is a 1982 American coming-of-age comedy film directed by Amy Heckerling (in her feature directorial debut) from a screenplay by Cameron Crowe, based on his 1981 book &quot;Fast Times at Ridgemont High: A True Story&quot;, and starring Sean Penn, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Judge Reinhold, Phoebe Cates, Brian Backer, Robert Romanus, and Ray Walston. Crowe went undercover at Clairemont High School in San Diego and wrote about his experiences.

The film chronicles a school year in the lives of sophomores Stacy Hamilton and Mark Ratner and their older friends Linda Barrett and Mike Damone, both of whom believe themselves wiser in the ways of romance than their younger counterparts. The ensemble cast of characters form two subplots with Jeff Spicoli, a perpetually stoned surfer facing off against history teacher Mr. Hand, and Stacy&#x27;s older brother Brad, a popular senior who works in entry-level jobs to pay for his car and ponders ending his two-year relationship with his girlfriend Lisa.

In addition to Penn, Reinhold, Cates, and Leigh, the film marks early appearances by several actors who later became stars, including Nicolas Cage, Eric Stoltz, Forest Whitaker, and Anthony Edwards (the first two in their feature film debuts).

In 2005, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

==Plot==
In the San Fernando Valley town of Ridgemont, the lives of teenagers who attend Ridgemont High School intersect.

Brad Hamilton, a popular senior, looks forward to his final year of school. He has a job at All-American Burger, his 1960 Buick LeSabre is almost paid for, and he plans to break up with his girlfriend Lisa so he can be single for his senior year. His younger sister Stacy, a 15-year-old freshman, works at Perry&#x27;s Pizza at Ridgemont Mall alongside her friend Linda Barrett, a fellow senior of Brad. Stacy envies Linda&#x27;s supposed promiscuity, so Linda - who claims to be engaged to an older man named Doug - gives her pointers. Mike Damone is a smooth-talker who fancies himself a worldly ladies&#x27; man and earns money taking sports bets and scalping concert tickets. Mark &quot;Rat&quot; Ratner, Damone&#x27;s shy but amiable best friend, works as an usher at the movie theater across from Perry&#x27;s Pizza. Jeff Spicoli is a carefree stoner and slacker who lives only for surfing and getting high.

On the first day of school, Spicoli runs afoul of strict history teacher Mr. Hand when he shows up late for class. A battle of wits ensues between the two with Mr. Hand attempting to get Spicoli to take school seriously. At work, Stacy is asked out by 26-year-old stereo salesman Ron Johnson. Stacy agrees to go out with him and lies about her age, claiming she is 19. On their date, she loses her virginity to him in the dugout of a baseball field. Ron sends her flowers the next day, but quickly loses interest in her.

Rat meets Stacy in biology class (run by the awkward Sanka-drinking Mr. Vargas), is smitten with her, and takes her to a German restaurant. Though he is awkward throughout, Stacy invites Rat to have sex with her, but he nervously leaves before they can proceed beyond kissing. Stacy mistakenly interprets his shyness as lack of interest. Linda advises her to move on and find another boy. Brad is fired from his job after threatening an obnoxious businessman and using profanity. He realizes he needs Lisa from this, but she breaks up with him the same way he planned to do to her.

Spicoli accidentally wrecks the 1981 Chevrolet Camaro of Ridgemont star football player Charles Jefferson while driving Jefferson&#x27;s younger brother to a concert for which Jefferson got them tickets from Damone. He conceals his role in the damage by making it look like the car was destroyed by fans of Ridgemont&#x27;s sports rival, Lincoln High School. This causes Jefferson to make numerous brutal tackles in a game against Lincoln, blowing them out 42-0. Brad gets a new job at Captain Hook Fish &amp; Chips, but soon rethinks his job situation when he is frequently mocked for his pirate-themed uniform, and quits.

Rat and Damone later drop by Stacy&#x27;s house to join her and Linda in the swimming pool, while Brad masturbates to an imagination of Linda undressing, only to get caught by her. Stacy decides to rebound from Rat with Damone, and she invites him to her home where they have sex in the pool house. Their encounter is cut short when Damone ejaculates early and immediately leaves. Embarrassed, Damone avoids her, though Stacy is oblivious to the reason.

Stacy later confronts Damone to inform him she has gotten pregnant from their one-time encounter. She asks if he can cover half the cost of an abortion and provide her with a ride to the clinic, and he agrees. Damone is unable to come up with his half, and he ends up abandoning Stacy on the day of her appointment. Stacy asks Brad to drive her and lies that she is going to a bowling alley to meet friends, but he sees her cross the street to the abortion clinic. After the appointment, Brad confides to Stacy that he knows the truth. Brad promises not to tell their parents, but she does not divulge who got her pregnant. Stacy instead tells Linda, prompting Linda to paint the insult &quot;Prick&quot; on his car and his school locker as revenge. With the situation now known around school, Rat angrily confronts Damone about his involvement with Stacy, and nearly get into a fight over it.

On the evening of the end of the year school dance, Mr. Hand visits Spicoli&#x27;s house and informs him that he must make up the eight hours of class time he has wasted over the school year. They have a history session that lasts until Mr. Hand is satisfied that Spicoli has understood the lesson. Rat makes peace with Damone&#x27;s behavior, and they make amends. Realizing she wants an actual relationship instead of sex, Stacy professes feelings for Rat. Brad takes a job at a convenience store called Mi-T-Mart and foils an armed robbery with some help from Spicoli, who stumbles out of the store&#x27;s bathroom giving Brad time to distract the robber.

A postscript states that Brad was promoted to manager of Mi-T-Mart on June 12. Damone was busted for scalping Ozzy Osbourne tickets and now works at a 7-Eleven. Mr. Vargas switched back to coffee. Linda attends college in Riverside and lives with her abnormal psychology professor. Rat and Stacy are in love, but they still haven&#x27;t gone all the way. Mr. Hand is convinced that everyone is on dope. Spicoli saved Brooke Shields from drowning and blew the reward money hiring rock band Van Halen to play at his birthday party.

==Production==
===Writing and development===
The film is adapted from a book Cameron Crowe wrote after having spent a year at Clairemont High School in San Diego, California. He went undercover to do research for his 1981 book, &quot;Fast Times at Ridgemont High: A True Story&quot;, about his observations of the high school and the students that he befriended there, including then-student Andy Rathbone, on whom the character Mark &quot;Rat&quot; Ratner was modeled.

Universal executives recommended David Lynch as a director, and Crowe met with Lynch. Though Lynch liked the idea, he passed on directing. Producer Art Linson showed Crowe&#x27;s script to Amy Heckerling, who at that point had directed only student films. Heckerling then met with Crowe, and the two began brainstorming different ideas for the film. Heckerling thought the book &quot;had just such an amazing wealth of material&quot; that could be incorporated more into the script.&quot; She liked how much of the book&#x27;s action is centered around a mall, and suggested featuring the mall setting even more prominently in the film. Said Crowe, &quot;Amy completely got it and we were up and running.&quot;

===Casting===
Nicolas Cage made his feature-film debut, portraying an unnamed co-worker of Brad&#x27;s at All-American Burger, credited as &quot;Nicolas Coppola&quot;. Cage originally auditioned for the role of Brad Hamilton, but he was not cast in the role due to his age. It was also the film debut for Eric Stoltz and provided early roles for Anthony Edwards and Forest Whitaker. Crowe&#x27;s future wife, Nancy Wilson of Heart, has a cameo as the &quot;Beautiful Girl in Car&quot; who laughs at Brad in his Captain Hook uniform during a traffic-light stop.

Tom Hanks was considered for the role of Brad Hamilton. Justine Bateman was offered the role of Linda Barrett, but she turned it down to star in &quot;Family Ties&quot;. Matthew Broderick was offered the role of Jeff Spicoli, but he turned it down. Jodie Foster was considered for the role of Stacy Hamilton. Ally Sheedy, Meg Tilly, and Ralph Macchio also auditioned for roles but were not cast. Fred Gwynne was offered the role of Mr. Hand, but turned it down as he felt that the script had &quot;too much nasty stuff&quot;. In a scene in Spicoli&#x27;s dream where he was originally going to be on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;, Johnny Carson passed on a cameo appearance, as did Tom Snyder. Jennifer Jason Leigh stated that she prepared for the role of Stacy by rereading her own high school diaries and letters, as well as taking a job at the Sherman Oaks Galleria Perry&#x27;s Pizza restaurant for three weeks.

=== Filming ===
Mall scenes were filmed at the Sherman Oaks Galleria during after hours. Principal photography began on November 2, 1981, and lasted for a total of 8 weeks. Scenes at Ridgemont High School took place at Van Nuys High School.

Universal test-screened an early cut of the film in Orange County, California. Heckerling said feedback from audiences and the studio was worrying because &quot;people were like, &#x27;We teenagers are not like that,&#x27; &#x27;You think all we care about is sex and drugs,&#x27; and blah, blah, blah. And we were worried that we would have to cut out a lot of stuff.&quot; However, producer Linson, who maintained that conservative audiences in Orange County were not the film&#x27;s target audience, ensured that no major cuts or edits were done.

==Soundtrack==

The soundtrack album &quot;Fast Times at Ridgemont High: Music from the Motion Picture&quot; was released by Elektra Records on July 30, 1982. It peaked at #54 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 album chart. The soundtrack features the work of many quintessential 1980s rock artists.

Several of the movie&#x27;s songs were released as singles, including Jackson Browne&#x27;s &quot;Somebody&#x27;s Baby&quot;, which reached #7 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 singles chart. Other singles were the title track by Sammy Hagar, a cover of The Tymes&#x27; &quot;So Much in Love&quot; by Timothy B. Schmit which reached #59 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 singles chart, &quot;Raised on the Radio&quot; by the Ravyns and &quot;Waffle Stomp&quot; by Joe Walsh. In addition to Schmit and Walsh, the album features solo tracks by other members of the Eagles: Don Henley and Don Felder. The soundtrack also included &quot;I Don&#x27;t Know (Spicoli&#x27;s Theme)&quot; by Jimmy Buffett and &quot;Goodbye Goodbye&quot; by Oingo Boingo (led by Danny Elfman).

Five tracks in the film not included on the soundtrack are &quot;Moving in Stereo&quot; by the Cars; &quot;American Girl&quot; by Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers; &quot;We Got the Beat&quot; by the Go Go&#x27;s, which is the movie&#x27;s opening theme; Led Zeppelin&#x27;s &quot;Kashmir&quot;; and &quot;Winter Wonderland&quot; by Darlene Love. In addition, the live band at the prom dance during the end of the film played two songs also not on the soundtrack: The Eagles&#x27; &quot;Life in the Fast Lane&quot; and Sam the Sham&#x27;s &quot;Wooly Bully&quot;.

The Donna Summer track &quot;Highway Runner&quot;, was recorded in 1981 for her double album titled &quot;I&#x27;m a Rainbow&quot;; however, the album was shelved by Geffen Records but ultimately released in 1996 by Mercury Records.

Todd Rundgren also recorded the song &quot;Attitude&quot; for the film at Crowe&#x27;s request. It was not included in the film, but was released on Rundgren&#x27;s &quot;Demos and Lost Albums&quot; in 2001. A track titled &quot;Fast Times&quot; was recorded by Heart but was not used in the film. The track ended up on their 1982 album &quot;Private Audition&quot;.

In some countries, the album was released as a single LP with 10 tracks.

Heckerling, in the DVD audio commentary, states that the 1970s artists, like the Eagles, were insisted upon inclusion in the film by one of the producers. Irving Azoff, one of the film&#x27;s producers, was the personal manager for the Eagles and Stevie Nicks.

===Track listing===

== Release ==
The film was initially given an X rating by the MPAA due to a protracted sex scene and brief male frontal nudity during the pool house scene. The original scene was longer, as Heckerling wanted to portray what she felt was the awkwardness of teen sexuality realistically, and with gender equality when it came to showing nudity, as X-rated films up to that point had mostly shown only nude women. To secure the R rating needed for commercial release, the sex was drastically shortened in editing, and Heckerling re-cropped the full-frontal male nude scene in question. Leigh expressed disappointment that the re-cut version &quot;eliminated the sense of awkward hesitancy between the two characters&quot;.

Universal was not confident the film would be a box-office success and was considering shelving the film. Crowe said &quot;What happened is somebody wrote a memo shortly before the [release]...to [Universal executives] Ned Tanen and Sid Sheinberg that said the future of the studio was in doubt if we are making movies like this high school movie.&quot; Tanen stood by releasing the film theatrically, and it was given a limited theatrical release. It was not given a big marketing push due to a lack of marquee names and concerns over its sexual content. Actor Judge Reinhold recalled, &quot;We were really heartsick because somebody high up said, &#x27;This is pornography, and there&#x27;s no way that Universal&#x27;s going to release [it]. We didn&#x27;t see it as this horny high school movie at all. We saw it as having the opportunity to do something authentic that was based on the actual experiences of the kids that Cameron chronicled for that whole year.&quot;

The film opened on August 13, 1982, playing in 498 theaters. Positive word-of-mouth, with audiences showing up to repeat viewings and quoting dialogue from the film, prompted the studio to expand the release.

===Box office===
On its opening weekend, the film earned $2.5 million. The release was widened to 713 theaters, earning $3.25 million. The film ranked 29th among U.S. releases in 1982, earning $27.1 million, six times its $4.5 million budget, and later gaining popularity through television and home video releases.

===Home media===
&quot;Fast Times at Ridgemont High&quot; was released to DVD on December 21, 1999. The DVD included audio commentary with Heckerling and Crowe, as well as the making-of documentary &quot;Reliving Our Fast Times at Ridgemont High&quot;. It was released on Blu-ray on January 10, 2012. On May 11, 2021, a digitally restored 4K version was released on Blu-ray and DVD through The Criterion Collection. The Criterion release restores Heckerling&#x27;s original cut of the film.

==Reception==

===Critical response===
On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, 78% of 60 critics&#x27; reviews are positive, with an average rating of 6.7/10. The website&#x27;s consensus reads, &quot;While &quot;Fast Times at Ridgemont High&quot; features Sean Penn&#x27;s legendary performance, the film endures because it accurately captured the small details of school, work, and teenage life.&quot; 

On its initial release, multiple critics dismissed the film as just the latest in a wave of teensploitation films such as &quot;Porky&#x27;s&quot; and &quot;The Last American Virgin&quot;. Roger Ebert was highly critical of the film&#x27;s vulgar humor and called it a &quot;scuz-pit of a movie&quot;. Though he praised the performances of Leigh, Penn, Cates, and Reinhold, he lamented that Leigh&#x27;s character is put through &quot;humiliating&quot; situations that he found degrading to young women. In later years, Ebert reevaluated his opinion of the film and became a big supporter of Cameron Crowe&#x27;s directorial career. Richard Corliss of &quot;Time&quot; compared the film negatively to another teen coming-of-age movie, &quot;American Graffiti&quot;. Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that it was &quot;a jumbled but appealing teen-age comedy with something of a fresh perspective on the subject.&quot;

In contrast, &quot;LA Weekly&quot; praised the film, particularly its screenplay, direction, and the performances of Leigh and Penn. The review read, &quot;While neither as slapstick as &quot;Animal House&quot;, nor as apocalyptic and biting as &quot;Over the Edge&quot;, &quot;Fast Times at Ridgemont High&quot; is both serious and funny enough to hold its own in their company.&quot; The review added the film presents &quot;a portrait of modern school life that speaks lightly but truly to the fears and trials of post-Watergate teens&quot;.

Speaking on earlier negative reactions to the film due to the sexual content, Heckerling said, &quot;The whole theme, of even the title, is things are going too fast for young people. They shouldn&#x27;t have to worry so much about sex at such an early age.&quot;

As time went on, however, the film was increasingly seen as a classic. In an essay written for the Criterion Collection edition in 2021, critic Dana Stevens wrote, &quot;&quot;Fast Times&quot; is the polar opposite of exploitation. Deep in its horny heart, this is the story of one fifteen-year-old girl&#x27;s clumsy and sometimes painful introduction to the world of sex, related without judgment or preconception or the least hint of sentimentalization. Heckerling&#x27;s film is a raunchy crowd-pleaser replete with stoner humor, a masturbation gag, and a blow-job tutorial that makes use of school-cafeteria carrots. But it is also attuned to the emotional lives of teenagers—girls and boys—in ways that place it far ahead of its time.&quot;

In &quot;Collider&quot;, Grace Neave noted that in teen comedy films like &quot;Porky&#x27;s&quot;, the women are typically objectified and are chased after by the male characters; however, in &quot;Fast Times&quot;, Stacy and Linda are fully formed characters that also pursue the guys. Neaves added that unlike most teen comedies of its time, which tended to &quot;encourage misogyny as a comical gag&quot;, &quot;Stacy&#x27;s enthusiasm about sex is never shamed or used as a plot point to cast judgment over her character.&quot;

&quot;Fast Times&quot; has also received praise for its realistic depiction of the abortion scene, foregoing judgement or moralizing about the act itself and instead focusing on Damone&#x27;s failure to support Stacy. Of Heckerling&#x27;s decision to depict the scene, Crowe later said, &quot;She said &#x27;you know what, this is life. I want to shoot this like life.&#x27; She just quietly did it, and in an almost European way, she put this young girl&#x27;s life onscreen in a way for you to judge — this is just how life is. And it meant a lot when she did it at the time, and it still means a lot. It was a very courageous thing to do, and it actually is the one thing about the movie that I&#x27;m probably happiest about at this point.&quot;

For the film&#x27;s 40th anniversary in 2022, critic Richard Roeper said that out of all the raunchy teen comedies of the 1980s, &quot;Fast Times&quot; &quot;continues to resonate as a substantial time capsule of the period, capturing the music, the fashions, the attitudes and the social mores of the time&quot;, and called it &quot;the best ribald teen comedy ever made.&quot;

===Accolades===

Crowe&#x27;s screenplay was nominated for a WGA Award for Best Comedy Adapted from Another Medium. The film ranks No. 15 on Bravo&#x27;s &quot;100 Funniest Movies&quot; and No. 2 on &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;&#x27;s list of the &quot;50 Best High School Movies&quot;.

The film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists:
* 2000: AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Laughs – #87

National Film Preservation Board
* 2005: National Film Registry, &quot;Fast Times at Ridgemont High&quot;

== Legacy ==
=== Television spin-off ===

The film inspired a short-lived 1986 television series titled &quot;Fast Times&quot;. Ray Walston and Vincent Schiavelli reprised their roles as Hand and Vargas on the show. Other characters from the movie were played by different actors, most notably Patrick Dempsey as Mike Damone.

=== 2020 table read ===
During the COVID-19 pandemic, as a fundraiser for CORE (Community Organized Relief Effort), a nonprofit charity co-founded by Sean Penn, a table read was organized for the film. After the table read, Cameron Crowe and Amy Heckerling hosted a discussion about the film.

<text>Joshua Winslow Groban (born February 27, 1981) is an American singer, songwriter, and actor. His first four solo albums have been certified multi-platinum, and he was charted in 2007 as the number-one best selling artist in the United States, with over 22.3 million records. , he had sold over 25 million records worldwide.

Groban originally studied acting, but switched to singing as his voice developed. He attended the Los Angeles County High School for the Arts, a free public school on the campus of California State University, Los Angeles, where students receive a conservatory-style education. David Foster called him to stand in for Andrea Bocelli to rehearse a duet, &quot;The Prayer&quot;, with Celine Dion at the rehearsal for the 1999 Grammy Awards. Rosie O&#x27;Donnell immediately invited him to appear on her talk show. Foster asked him to sing at California Governor Gray Davis&#x27; 1999 inauguration. He was cast on &quot;Ally McBeal&quot; by the show&#x27;s creator, David E. Kelley, performing &quot;You&#x27;re Still You&quot;, later released on his debut album, for the 2001 season four finale.

After his appearance in two professional productions of &quot;Chess&quot;, he made his Broadway debut in 2016 as Pierre Bezukhov in the musical &quot;Natasha, Pierre &amp; The Great Comet of 1812&quot;, to critical acclaim and a Tony Award nomination. In 2018, he received two Primetime Emmy Award nominations for his performance at the 72nd Tony Awards, and starred in the limited series &quot;The Good Cop&quot;. He also appeared in television series and films, such as &quot;Crazy, Stupid, Love&quot; and &quot;Muppets Most Wanted&quot;.

In 2022, Groban portrayed the Beast in the television special &quot;Beauty and the Beast: A 30th Celebration&quot;. He returned to Broadway in 2023 playing the title character in a revival of &quot;Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street&quot;, for which he earned his second Tony Award nomination.

== Early life and education ==
Groban was born in Los Angeles to Jack Groban, a businessman, and Lindy Groban (née Johnston), a school teacher. His father is a descendant of Jewish immigrants from Poland and Ukraine, but converted to Christianity from Judaism upon marrying his mother. His mother&#x27;s ancestry is English, German, Norwegian, and one quarter Ashkenazi Jewish. His parents are Episcopalians.

Josh Groban first sang in public when he was in the seventh grade. His music teacher chose him to sing a solo of &quot;S&#x27;wonderful&quot; at the school&#x27;s cabaret night, where he sang alone on stage for the first time. At this time, he was more focused on acting, playing Tevye in his high school&#x27;s production of &quot;Fiddler on the Roof&quot;. In the summers of 1997 and 1998, he went to the Interlochen Center for the Arts Camp in Michigan, majoring in musical theater, and began taking vocal lessons. He attended the Los Angeles County High School for the Arts as a theater major and graduated in 1999. He was admitted to and briefly attended Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, intent on studying musical theater. Four months into his first semester, Groban was offered a recording contract and left college to pursue a singing career.

== Career ==

=== 1997–2001: Debut ===
In late 1997, the 16-year-old Groban was introduced by his vocal coach, Seth Riggs, to producer and arranger David Foster and future manager Brian Avnet. At the time, Groban had no recording experience and was preparing for his studies at Carnegie Mellon. Groban worked for David Foster as a rehearsal singer on a series of high-profile events, including the January 1999 California gubernatorial inauguration of Gray Davis and the 1999 Grammy Awards where—as a stand-in for Andrea Bocelli—he rehearsed Foster&#x27;s &quot;The Prayer&quot; with Céline Dion. According to Avnet, Groban was very nervous about standing in for Bocelli and had to be talked into it; his performance prompted the show hostess, Rosie O&#x27;Donnell, to ask him to appear on her show the following week, which in turn led to an appearance on &quot;Ally McBeal&quot;. Creator David E. Kelley wrote the character Malcolm Wyatt for Groban in the season finale, aired in May 2001. His performance, including the song &quot;You&#x27;re Still You&quot;, was so popular that the show received upwards of 8,000 emails from viewers. The song was included on his eponymous debut album, released in November 2001. Groban was asked to return the next season to reprise his role as Wyatt, performing &quot;To Where You Are&quot;, airing just two weeks after his debut album was released. Avnet claims this sequence of events effectively got Groban&#x27;s career off the ground.

Groban was offered a recording contract at Warner Bros. Records through Foster&#x27;s 143 Records imprint. Avnet told &quot;HitQuarters&quot; that Warner Bros. initially proved resistant to the deal because &quot;They were afraid they wouldn&#x27;t be able to get a voice like that on radio.&quot; Explaining his reasons for signing the artist, Foster said: &quot;I love his natural ability in the pop and rock arena, but I love his sense of classics even more. He&#x27;s a true musical force to be reckoned with.&quot; Under Foster&#x27;s influence, Groban&#x27;s first album focused more on classics such as &quot;Gira Con Me Questa Notte&quot; and &quot;Alla Luce Del Sole&quot;.

Groban performed &quot;There For Me&quot; with Sarah Brightman on her 2000–01 &quot;La Luna World Tour&quot;, and was featured on her &quot;La Luna&quot; concert DVD. He recorded &quot;For Always&quot; with Lara Fabian for the movie soundtrack of &quot;A.I. Artificial Intelligence&quot; (2001). He performed in many benefit shows, including &quot;The Andre Agassi Grand Slam Event For Children,&quot; alongside Elton John, Stevie Wonder, Don Henley, and Robin Williams; &quot; Muhammad Ali&#x27;s Fight Night Foundation&quot; which honored Michael J. Fox and others; &quot;The Family Celebration&quot; (2001), which was co-hosted by President Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton, and David E. Kelley and Michelle Pfeiffer; and Michael Milken&#x27;s CapCure event, which raised funds for cancer research.

His self-titled debut album &quot;Josh Groban&quot; was released on November 20, 2001. Over the next year it went from gold status to double-platinum.

=== 2002–2005: &quot;Closer&quot; ===
On February 24, 2002, Groban performed &quot;The Prayer&quot; with Charlotte Church at the closing ceremonies of the Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, and by November, he had his own PBS special titled &quot;Josh Groban In Concert&quot; (2002). In December 2002, he performed &quot;To Where You Are&quot; and sang &quot;The Prayer&quot; in a duet with Sissel Kyrkjebø at the Nobel Peace Prize Concert in Oslo, Norway. He joined The Corrs, Ronan Keating, Sting, Lionel Richie, and others for a Christmas performance at the Vatican. In 2003, Groban performed at the David Foster concert for World Children&#x27;s Day, singing &quot;The Prayer&quot; with Celine Dion and the finale song, &quot;Aren&#x27;t They All Our Children?&quot; with artists including Yolanda Adams, Nick Carter, Enrique Iglesias, and Celine Dion.

Groban&#x27;s second album &quot;Closer&quot;, produced and written by Foster, was released on November 11, 2003. Groban said he believed that this album was a better reflection of him, and his audience would be able to get a better idea of his personality from listening to it.

Two months after &quot;Closer&quot; was released, it rose on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts from number 11 to number one. Groban&#x27;s cover of &quot;You Raise Me Up&quot; became his third most popular song on the adult contemporary charts as of March 2004. Later that year, he also performed the song &quot;Remember&quot; (with Tanja Tzarovska) on the &quot;Troy&quot; soundtrack, &quot;Believe&quot; on the soundtrack to the 2004 animated film &quot;The Polar Express&quot; and a cover of Linkin Park&#x27;s &quot;My December&quot;.

In the summer of 2004, Groban returned to Interlochen, performing and discussing his earlier experiences with local residents and campers. On November 30, 2004, his second live DVD, &quot;Live At The Greek&quot;, was released; it was also shown as a &quot;Great Performances&quot; special on PBS. In the same year, Groban performed &quot;Remember When It Rained&quot;, backed by a full orchestra, at the American Music Awards, where he was nominated for Favorite Male Artist in the pop category; he was also nominated for a People&#x27;s Choice Award. His recording of &quot;Believe&quot; secured an Academy Award nomination in 2005 for the songwriters Glen Ballard and Alan Silvestri, earning a Grammy in the category Best Song Written for a Motion Picture, Television or Other Visual Media at the Grammy Awards in February 2006 .

=== 2005–2010: &quot;Awake&quot; ===
Groban earned his first Grammy nomination in 2005 for his single &quot;You Raise Me Up&quot; in the Best Male Pop Vocal Performance category. During the first week of September 2006, Groban&#x27;s single entitled &quot;You Are Loved (Don&#x27;t Give Up)&quot; was released exclusively on AOL&#x27;s First Listen. His third studio album &quot;Awake&quot; was officially released on November 7, 2006. Groban performed &quot;You Are Loved (Don&#x27;t Give Up)&quot; as well as two other tracks from &quot;Awake&quot; at his recording session for &quot;Live from Abbey Road&quot; at Abbey Road Studios on October 26, 2006. On that album, Groban also collaborated on the single &quot;Now or Never&quot; with British musician and songwriter Imogen Heap. He performed two tracks with the South African group Ladysmith Black Mambazo, &quot;Lullaby&quot; and &quot;Weeping&quot;. Groban&#x27;s &quot;Awake&quot; world tour visited 71 cities between February and August 2007, and toured Australia and the Philippines with Lani Misalucha as his special guest in October 2007. He performed a duet with Barbra Streisand (&quot;All I Know of Love&quot;) and with Mireille Mathieu (&quot;Over the Rainbow&quot;). As to his future, Groban was open to a plethora of possibilities. He said, &quot;I am fortunate enough to have had many really big moments in my career. I think the mistake a lot of people in my position make is to always search for the next big thing. I am looking forward to playing some small theaters. I&#x27;m looking forward to writing more. I want to delve further into my acting career and explore some of the film and TV opportunities that I haven&#x27;t had time for. My outlook is to expect the unexpected... when the next step comes, I&#x27;m prepared to take it.&quot;

=== 2010–2015: &quot;Illuminations&quot;; &quot;All That Echoes&quot; ===
Groban finished his fifth studio album, entitled &quot;Illuminations&quot;, and the album was released on November 15, 2010. Most of the songs on the album are about &quot;specific situations that I&#x27;ve had where love has existed and ultimately failed,&quot; Groban told The New York Times, adding: &quot;And other songs are about the quest, and it just not working out.&quot; Groban wrote 11 of the 13 songs on the album. The first single from the album, &quot;Hidden Away&quot;, was made available for free download via Facebook on September 8. &quot;For me to sit in a room with a piano in one take with some of Johnny Cash&#x27;s musicians—that was totally new for me.&quot; Josh added. &quot;and I think that excitement is on the record.&quot; On October 12, a second single from the upcoming album, &quot;Você Existe Em Mim&quot;, was made available on iTunes. The song is sung in Portuguese and was written by Brazilian artist Carlinhos Brown. The Washington Post said: &quot;Illuminations&quot; is not a revelation, but it offers a perfectly fine, and often quite lovely, glimpse at a pop-classical crossover artist in the middle of crossing over.&quot; Groban plans on making one more record with Rick Rubin. Beginning May 12, 2011, and continuing through December of that year, Groban undertook the 81-city Straight to You Tour to promote &quot;Illuminations&quot;, encompassing appearances in North America, Europe, and South Africa.

Groban&#x27;s sixth studio album, &quot;All That Echoes&quot;, was released on February 5, 2013, debuting at number one by selling 141,000 copies. He promoted the album with the All That Echoes World Tour in 2013. A year later, he embarked on his Summer Symphony Tour.

=== 2015–2017: &quot;Stages&quot; and Broadway debut ===
On Groban&#x27;s Facebook page in March 2015, he announced the release of the album &quot;Stages&quot;, consisting of covers of songs from Broadway musicals. The album was released on April 28, 2015.

Starting October 18, 2016, Groban performed on Broadway as Pierre Bezukhov in &quot;Natasha, Pierre &amp; The Great Comet of 1812&quot;, an electropop opera by composer Dave Malloy based on &quot;War and Peace&quot;. The production was nominated for twelve Tony Awards. For his performance as Pierre, Groban was nominated for the 2017 Tony Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role in a Musical. His final performance as Pierre was on July 2, 2017 with Malloy replacing him for a week before Okieriete Onaodowan took over the role. 

In 2017, he released a book titled &quot;STAGE to STAGE, My Journey to Broadway&quot;. The book detailed the creation of Groban&#x27;s album and tour, &quot;Stages&quot;, as well as preparing and performing in &quot;The Great Comet of 1812&quot;. The book featured pictures both on and off stage from his performances in &quot;Stages&quot; and &quot;Great Comet&quot;, as well as messages from Groban and Malloy. Groban performed the song &quot;Evermore&quot; during the end credits of the 2017 Disney film &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;.

=== 2018: &quot;Bridges&quot; ===
On March 12, 2018, tour dates were announced for Groban&#x27;s Bridges Tour with special guest Idina Menzel. The US leg of the tour began on October 18, 2018, in Duluth, Georgia which is northwest of Atlanta concluding at Madison Square Garden in New York City on November 18. The European leg of the tour began on December 12 at the O2 Arena in London and concluded on December 18 in Poland.

On June 26, 2018, Groban announced via social media that his album &quot;Bridges&quot; would be released on September 21 and would contain a cover of Céline Dion&#x27;s song &quot;S&#x27;il suffisait d&#x27;aimer&quot; along with new tracks. The album debuted at number two in the US and in the top 10 in the UK and Scotland.

=== 2020–2024: &quot;Harmony&quot; and return to Broadway ===
Groban released his studio album &quot;Harmony&quot; on November 20, 2020. In December 2022, he portrayed The Beast in the television special &quot;Beauty and the Beast: A 30th Celebration&quot;, for which he sang &quot;Evermore&quot; again.

Groban returned to Broadway in the title role in a revival of Stephen Sondheim’s musical &quot;Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street&quot;, opposite Annaleigh Ashford as Mrs. Lovett and Jordan Fisher as Anthony Hope, directed by Thomas Kail. The production officially opened on March 26, 2023 (with previews having begun on February 26) at the Lunt-Fontanne Theatre; it received positive reviews and was nominated for eight Tony Awards, including nominations for both Groban and Ashford. He and Ashford departed on 14 January 2024, with Aaron Tveit and Sutton Foster announced to replace them.
He has performed with Little Big Town, on Christmas at the Opry, and hosted his own show called Josh Groban and Friends Go Home For the Holidays.

===2025-present: Las Vegas ===

On May 9-17, 2025, Groban will perform at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas.

== Performances ==
In June 2007, Groban recorded a Christmas album in London with the London Symphony Orchestra and the Magdalen College Choir. Titled &quot;Noël&quot;, it was released on October 9, 2007. The album was very successful in the United States breaking numerous records for a Christmas album and becoming the best-selling album of 2007 in only its tenth week of release, at sales of 3.6 million. He discussed it on the DVD from &quot;The Making of &quot;Noël&quot;&quot;. On July 1, 2007, Groban performed with Sarah Brightman at the &quot;Concert for Diana&quot; at Wembley Stadium; it was broadcast to over 500 million homes in 140 countries. On February 10, 2008, Groban performed at the 2008 Grammy Awards with Andrea Bocelli in a tribute to Luciano Pavarotti.

On April 14, 2008, Groban joined Idina Menzel for a PBS &quot;Soundstage&quot; taping. The next day, he held his own taping for the same PBS TV series at Lincoln Center&#x27;s Rose Hall at Jazz in Manhattan. On May 12 and 13, 2008, at Royal Albert Hall, London, Groban performed as &quot;The Russian&quot; Anatoly Sergievsky with Broadway stars Idina Menzel and Adam Pascal in &quot;Chess in Concert&quot; a live concert version of the musical &quot;Chess&quot; composed by Benny Andersson and Björn Ulvaeus of ABBA fame. This performance has since been made into a DVD and CD recording.

On September 21, 2008, Groban performed a comical medley of well-known TV theme songs at the 60th Annual Primetime Emmy Awards. In December 2008, he appeared on &quot;Never Mind the Buzzcocks&quot;. He performed a duet with Only Men Aloud! at the Royal Variety Show at the London Palladium for the Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall. On January 18, 2009, he performed as part of the Presidential Inauguration ceremonies, performing &quot;My Country &#x27;Tis of Thee&quot; in duet with Heather Headley. On January 19, 2009, Groban performed with Herbie Hancock as part of Feeding America&#x27;s Rally Against Hunger in Washington DC. At the 2010 BCS National Championship Game, he performed the &quot;Star Spangled Banner&quot; on January 7, 2010, with Red Hot Chili Peppers bassist Flea at the historic Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California.

== Film and television appearances ==
Groban has appeared on &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot; six times, as well as on &quot;The Ellen DeGeneres Show&quot;, &quot;Larry King Live&quot;, &quot;The Rosie O&#x27;Donnell Show&quot;, &quot;Tim and Eric Awesome Show, Great Job!&quot;, &quot;Comedy Bang! Bang!&quot;, &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot;, &quot;20/20&quot;, &quot;Today&quot;, Macy&#x27;s Thanksgiving Day Parade, Super Bowl XXXVIII, and &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot;. He has also been a guest co-host on &quot;Live with Kelly&quot; many times from 2011 to 2016, and was a finalist to permanently replace Regis Philbin. In a 2012 interview, Groban was asked if he would consider hosting a long-term talk show:

Groban plays Malcolm Wyatt, one of Reverend Harris&#x27; choirboys, on &quot;Ally McBeal&quot;, episodes &quot;The Wedding&quot; and &quot;Nine One One&quot; (2001). He has made two guest appearances on the series &quot;Glee&quot; as himself. Groban appeared on BBC Two&#x27;s hit British music quiz &quot;Never Mind the Buzzcocks&quot;, and his first appearance was as a guest on Omid Djalili&#x27;s team. On December 21, 2010, he returned to the show, this time as guest host/quiz master and ending the show duetting with Michael Ball in a version of &quot;I Dreamed a Dream&quot; from &quot;Les Misérables&quot;.

Groban appears in two episodes of &quot;The Office&quot; as Andy Bernard&#x27;s brother (&quot;Garden Party&quot; and &quot;The Boat&quot;). On May 24, 2011, Groban appeared as a mystery guest star on the season 12 finale of &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot; to surprise Petra Němcová by singing &quot;You Raise Me Up&quot; to her dance. When she saw that it was he who was actually singing and not one of the usual performers, she momentarily was too stunned to continue dancing.

In the comedy &quot;Crazy, Stupid, Love&quot;, a film starring Steve Carell and Ryan Gosling, released on July 29, 2011, Groban played a character named Richard, a caddish and nerdy attorney and the previous love interest of Hannah, who&#x27;s played by Emma Stone. In 2012, he appeared in episode 5 of series 12 of the revived British comedy panel show &quot;Room 101&quot;. In October the same year, his cover of &quot;You Raise Me Up&quot; was used in the Halloween-based teen comedy film, &quot;Fun Size&quot;, in which Peng turns on the car stereo in Roosevelt&#x27;s car and while he and Roosevelt are fighting over it, the knob breaks and the stereo blares the song at full volume, thus making Roosevelt, Wren, Peng and April uncool as they roll onto a night-cruising street. In February 2013, Groban appeared in &quot;&quot;″s &quot;Blood Actually&quot; (season 9, episode 16), performing his new song &quot;Happy In My Heartache&quot;, and guest anchored on &quot;Canada AM&quot;.

Also in 2013, he played one of the lead characters named Sam in the independent comedy film &quot;Coffee Town&quot;, produced by CollegeHumor and co-starring with longtime friend and actor Glenn Howerton. Groban appeared on the cable television comedy series &quot;It&#x27;s Always Sunny in Philadelphia&quot; in episode &quot;The Gang Saves the Day&quot;, the 100th of the series, also co-starring Howerton. He shows up in the character Dee&#x27;s fantasy sequence. On November 7, 2013, he made the first of several appearances in the CBS comedy &quot;The Crazy Ones&quot; alongside Robin Williams and Sarah Michelle Gellar.

Groban appeared in the 2014 film &quot;Muppets Most Wanted&quot; as an unnamed prisoner in a maximum security prison in Siberia. Groban&#x27;s character is first only heard, as he is in a large metal box with a small slot at around eye level. The actor is revealed in the musical number &quot;Together Again&quot; later at the end of the film. He appeared in cameo roles in the seventh season of &quot;Parks and Recreation&quot; (2015) and in &quot;Crazy Ex-Girlfriend&quot; (as himself); in the latter, he sang the original song &quot;The End of the Movie&quot;.

In September 2018 Netflix premiered an original murder-mystery, &quot;The Good Cop&quot;, starring Groban. In the series, created by &quot;Monk&quot; creator-writer Andy Breckman, Groban portrays NYPD homicide detective Tony Caruso Jr., opposite Tony Danza, who plays his father, Tony Sr., a disgraced former detective. The first season of ten episodes launched on September 21, 2018. In early 2022, Groban made a guest appearance on the Jimmy Fallon hosted NBC game-show, &quot;That&#x27;s My Jam.&quot; Groban partnered with fellow artist, Alessia Cara. The duo lost to the team of Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Chance the Rapper. Groban played the role of Beast in the 2022 musical television special &quot;Beauty and the Beast: A 30th Celebration&quot;.

== Voice ==
Some music critics refer to Groban as a tenor and others as a baritone. Groban himself has provided varying claims to his own vocal type. In a 2002 &quot;New York Times&quot; article, he described himself as a &quot;tenor in training&quot;. He mentioned during his appearance on &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot; in December 2013 that he is a high lyric baritone. On Twitter in March 2012, he mentioned that he is a baritone &quot;with some high notes up my sleeve.&quot; He is also sometimes referred to as a baritenor. The usage of voice classification in non-classical music is controversial, because of the differing styles and techniques used.

== Philanthropy ==
Under the guidance of his mentor David Foster, Groban performed for VH1 Save the Music Foundation (2005), Tsunami Aid: A Concert of Hope (2005), Fifth Annual Adopt-A-Minefield concert (2005), 2nd Annual Grammy Jam (2005), Live 8 (2005), The Heart Foundation Gala (2005), David Foster and Friends Charity Gala (2006), and other charity events. He sang a solo on the recording of We Are The World 25 for Haiti (2010). Inspired by a visit with Nelson Mandela during a 2004 trip to South Africa, he established the Josh Groban Foundation to help children in need through education, healthcare and the arts. Mandela appointed Groban as an Official Ambassador for Mandela&#x27;s Project 46664, a campaign to help raise Global awareness of HIV/AIDS in Africa. On April 25, 2007, Groban performed with the African Children&#x27;s Choir on &quot;American Idol&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Idol Gives Back&quot; episode. Also on September 2, 2007, Groban donated $150,000 to Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools to fund music education.

On February 28, 2008, he appeared in One Night Live at the Air Canada Centre in Toronto with Bryan Adams, Sarah McLachlan, Jann Arden, and RyanDan in aid of the Sunnybrook Hospital Women and Babies Program. In honor of his 27th birthday, his fans set out to raise $27,000 in a project called &quot;Raise 27&quot;. They raised $44,227 for the Josh Groban Foundation, to benefit the Noah&#x27;s Ark children&#x27;s orphanage called Siyawela in South Africa. Groban has referred to the donation as &quot;the best birthday present ever&quot;. He performed at The Angel Ball on October 21, 2010, to benefit the Gabrielles Angel Foundation for cancer research. In April 2013, and the previous year, Groban took part in Global Poverty Project&#x27;s &quot;Live Below the Line&quot; campaign, which consists in living on $1.50 a day to raise awareness of extreme poverty around the world. He also wrote a song inspired by the campaign.

On October 30, 2013, Groban met with Little Kids Rock students in Newark, New Jersey before his concert at the Prudential Center. His Find Your Light Foundation also made a donation to Little Kids Rock to support their mission of keeping music education in our public schools. An active arts education philanthropist and advocate, he is a member of Americans for the Arts Artists Committee. On January 17, 2021, three days before the inauguration of Joe Biden Groban performed at an &quot;indoguration&quot; for Joe Biden&#x27;s German Shepherd Major organized by the Delaware Humane Association. More than 7,400 people attended via Zoom and the event also raised $200,000 in donations for the association.

== Impact ==
Some of Groban&#x27;s musical influences have been Radiohead, Steve Perry, Paul Simon, Sting, Peter Gabriel, Freddie Mercury, and Björk. He cites as vocal influences &quot;anyone who told a story with their songs&quot; including Mandy Patinkin, Klaus Nomi, George Hearn, and Luciano Pavarotti.

Groban has sold more than 20 million albums in less than ten years. In 2002, he was listed as &quot;100 Sexiest Newcomer&quot; and in 2008, he was listed as one of &quot;People&quot;″s &quot;100 Most Beautiful People&quot;.

== Personal life ==
Groban dated actresses January Jones from 2003 to 2006 and Kat Dennings from 2014 to 2016. From 2019 to 2021, he and Schuyler Helford were in a relationship. Since 2023, he and Natalie McQueen have been dating.

<text>Breakout is an arcade video game developed and published by Atari, Inc. and released on May 13, 1976. &quot;Breakout&quot; was released in Japanese arcades by Namco. The game was designed by Nolan Bushnell and Steve Bristow and prototyped via discrete logic chips by Steve Wozniak with assistance from Steve Jobs. In the game, eight rows of bricks line the top portion of the screen, and the player&#x27;s goal is to destroy the bricks by repeatedly bouncing a ball off a paddle into them. The concept was predated by Ramtek&#x27;s &quot;Clean Sweep&quot; (1974), but the game&#x27;s designers were influenced by Atari&#x27;s own &quot;Pong&quot; (1972). The arcade version of &quot;Breakout&quot; uses a monochrome display underneath a translucent colored overlay.

The game was a worldwide commercial success. It was among the top five highest-grossing arcade video games of 1976 in the U.S. and Japan, and among the top three in both countries for 1977. A port of the game was published in 1978 for the Atari 2600 with color graphics. An arcade sequel was released in 1978, &quot;Super Breakout&quot;, which introduced multiple bouncing balls. Steve Wozniak and Steve Jobs went on to found the Apple Computer Company with Ronald Wayne. The company&#x27;s influential Apple II computer, designed mostly by Wozniak, has technical elements inspired by &quot;Breakout&quot;&#x27;s hardware.

Atari was involved in a series of court cases over their ability to copyright &quot;Breakout&quot;, and they were ultimately allowed to do so. The game spawned an entire genre of clones nonetheless. In Japan, the genre is known as &quot;block kuzushi&quot; (&quot;block breaker&quot;) games. &quot;Breakout&quot; was the inspiration for Taito&#x27;s &quot;Space Invaders&quot; (1978) and Taito&#x27;s &quot;Arkanoid&quot; (1986), which both spawned dozens of imitators.

==Gameplay==

&quot;Breakout&quot; begins with eight rows of bricks, with two rows each of a different color. The color order from the bottom up is yellow, green, orange and red. Using a single ball, the player must knock down as many bricks as possible by using the walls and/or the paddle below to hit the ball against the bricks and eliminate them. If the player&#x27;s paddle misses the ball&#x27;s rebound, they will lose a turn. The player has three turns to try to clear two screens of bricks. Yellow bricks earn one point each, green bricks earn three points, orange bricks earn five points and the top-level red bricks score seven points each. The paddle shrinks to one-half its size after the ball has broken through the red row and hit the upper wall. Ball speed increases at specific intervals: after four hits, after twelve hits, and after making contact with the orange and red rows.

The highest score achievable for one player is 864; this is done by eliminating two screens of bricks worth 432 points per screen. Once the second screen of bricks is destroyed, the ball in play harmlessly bounces off empty walls until the player restarts the game, as no additional screens are provided. However, a secret way to score beyond the 864 maximum is to play the game in two-player mode. If &quot;Player One&quot; completes the first screen on their third and last ball, then immediately and deliberately allows the ball to &quot;drain&quot;, Player One&#x27;s second screen is transferred to &quot;Player Two&quot; as a third screen, allowing Player Two to score a maximum of 1,312 points if they are adept enough to keep the third ball in play that long. Once the third screen is eliminated, the game is over.

The original arcade cabinet of &quot;Breakout&quot; has artwork framing the game&#x27;s plot a prison escape. The player is one of a prison&#x27;s inmates attempting to knock a ball and chain into a wall of their prison cell with a mallet. If the player successfully destroys the wall in-game, the inmate escapes with others following.

==Development==
A precursor to &quot;Breakout&quot; was &quot;Clean Sweep&quot;, released by Ramtek in 1974. In that game, the player uses a paddle to hit a ball up towards a playfield of dots, which disappear as the ball moves through the dots; the goal is to achieve a clean sweep by erasing all the dots. &quot;Clean Sweep&quot; was one of the top ten best-selling arcade video games of 1974 and sold a total of 3,500 arcade cabinets.

&quot;Breakout&quot;, a discrete logic (non-microprocessor) game, was designed by Nolan Bushnell and Steve Bristow, both of whom were involved with Atari and its Kee Games subsidiary. Atari produced innovative video games using the &quot;Pong&quot; hardware as a means of competition against companies making &quot;&quot;Pong&quot; clones&quot;. Bushnell wanted to turn &quot;Pong&quot; into a single player game, where the player would use a paddle to maintain a ball that depletes a wall of bricks. Bushnell was certain the game would be popular, and he and Bristow partnered to produce a concept. Al Alcorn was assigned as the &quot;Breakout&quot; project manager, and he began development with Cyan Engineering in 1975. Bushnell assigned Steve Jobs, who was not an engineer, to design a prototype. Jobs was offered $750, with an award for every TTL (transistor-transistor logic) chip fewer than 50. Jobs promised to complete a prototype within four days.

Bushnell offered the bonus because he disliked how new Atari games required 150 to 170 chips; he knew that Jobs&#x27; friend Steve Wozniak, an employee of Hewlett-Packard, had designed a version of Pong that used about 30 chips. Jobs had little specialized knowledge of circuit board design but knew Wozniak was capable of producing designs with a small number of chips. He convinced Wozniak to work with him, promising to split the fee evenly between them if Wozniak could minimize the number of chips. Wozniak had no sketches and instead interpreted the game from its description. To save parts, he had &quot;tricky little designs&quot;. Near the end of development, Wozniak considered moving the high score to the screen&#x27;s top, but Jobs claimed Bushnell wanted it at the bottom; Wozniak was unaware of any truth to his claims. The original deadline was met after Wozniak worked at Atari four nights straight, doing some additional designs while at his day job at Hewlett-Packard. This equated to a bonus of $5,000, which Jobs kept secret from Wozniak. Wozniak has stated he only received payment of $350; he believed for years that Atari had promised $700 for a design using fewer than 50 chips, and $1000 for fewer than 40, stating in 1984 that &quot;we only got 700 bucks for it&quot;. Wozniak was the engineer, and Jobs was the breadboarder and tester. Wozniak&#x27;s original design used 42 chips; the final, working breadboard he and Jobs delivered to Atari used 44, but Wozniak said: &quot;We were so tired we couldn&#x27;t cut it down&quot;.

The simplicity of the game created a problem when the copyright filing was denied because it &quot;did not contain at least a minimum amount of original pictorial or graphic authorship, or authorship in sounds&quot; and Atari appealed. In &quot;Atari Games Corp. v. Oman&quot;, then Court of Appeals Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg found that the work was copyrightable.

Atari was unable to use Wozniak&#x27;s design. By designing the board with as few chips as possible, he made the design difficult to manufacture; it was too compact and complicated to be feasible with Atari&#x27;s manufacturing methods. However, Wozniak claims Atari could not understand the design and speculates &quot;maybe some engineer there was trying to make some kind of modification to it&quot;. Atari ended up designing their own version for production, which contained about 100 TTL chips. Wozniak found the gameplay to be the same as his original creation and could not find any differences.

The arcade cabinet uses a black and white monitor, but the monitor has strips of colored cellophane placed over it so that the bricks appear to be in color.

==Ports==
A software version of &quot;Breakout&quot; was written for the Atari 2600 by Brad Stewart. The game was published in 1978, but with only six rows of bricks, and the player is given five turns to clear two walls instead of three. In the Breakthru variant, the ball does not bounce off of the bricks but continues through them until it hits the wall. Atari had this term trademarked and used it in addition to &quot;Breakout&quot; to describe gameplay, especially in look-alike games and remakes.

Atari&#x27;s 1977 dedicated &quot;Video Pinball&quot; console includes a &quot;Breakout&quot; game.

==Reception==
In October 1976, the annual &quot;RePlay&quot; chart listed &quot;Breakout&quot; as the fifth highest-earning arcade video game of 1976 in the United States, below Midway Manufacturing&#x27;s &quot;Sea Wolf&quot;, &quot;Gun Fight&quot;, and &quot;Wheels&quot;, and Atari&#x27;s &quot;Indy 800&quot;. &quot;Breakout&quot; was later the third highest-earning arcade video game of 1977 in the US, below &quot;Sea Wolf&quot; and &quot;Sprint 2&quot;, and the fifth highest-earning arcade video game of 1978 in the US. &quot;Breakout&quot; had a total arcade production run of 11,000 cabinets manufactured by Atari, estimated to have generated over ( adjusted for inflation) in sales revenue.

&quot;Breakout&quot; was also a commercial success for Namco in Japan. On the first annual &quot;Game Machine&quot; arcade chart, &quot;Breakout&quot; was the fourth highest-grossing arcade video game of 1976 in Japan, below Taito&#x27;s &quot;Ball Park&quot; (&quot;Tornado Baseball&quot;) and &quot;Speed Race DX&quot; and Sega&#x27;s &quot;Heavyweight Champ&quot;. The following year, &quot;Breakout&quot; was Japan&#x27;s third highest-grossing arcade game of 1977, below only two racing games, Namco&#x27;s electro-mechanical game &quot;F-1&quot; and Taito&#x27;s video game &quot;Speed Race DX&quot;. In total, &quot;Breakout&quot; sold 15,000 arcade units worldwide by 1981.

The Atari 2600 version sold 256,265 units in 1980. &quot;Breakout&quot; went on to sell a total of 1,650,336 units by 1983.

In 1989, &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; reviewed the Atari VCS version, giving it a 24% score.

In 2021, &quot;The Guardian&quot; listed &quot;Breakout&quot; as the fourth greatest video game of the 1970s, below &quot;Galaxian&quot;, &quot;Asteroids&quot; and &quot;Space Invaders&quot;.

==Legacy==

&quot;Breakout&quot; was an influential game that had an impact on the video game and computer industries. &quot;Breakout&quot; spawned an entire genre of clones. Ten years later, the concept found new legs with Taito&#x27;s 1986 &quot;Arkanoid&quot;, which itself spawned dozens of imitators. In Japan, the genre is known as &quot;block kuzushi&quot; (&quot;block breaker&quot;) games. &quot;Breakout&quot; was also the basis and inspiration for certain aspects of the Apple II personal computer and Taito&#x27;s arcade shoot &#x27;em up game &quot;Space Invaders&quot; (1978).

===Apple II influence===
&quot;Breakout&quot; directly influenced Wozniak&#x27;s design for the Apple II computer. He said: &quot;A lot of features of the Apple II went in because I had designed &quot;Breakout&quot; for Atari. I had designed it in hardware. I wanted to write it in software now&quot;. This included his design of color graphics circuitry, the addition of game paddle support and sound, and graphics commands in Integer BASIC, with which he wrote &quot;Brick Out&quot;, a software clone of his own hardware game. Wozniak said in 1984:

===&quot;Space Invaders&quot; influence===
Tomohiro Nishikado cited &quot;Breakout&quot; as the original inspiration behind his hit &quot;Space Invaders&quot; (1978). He wanted to adapt the same sense of achievement and tension from destroying targets one at a time for a shooting game.

===Re-releases and enhanced versions===
The success of the game resulted in &quot;Super Breakout&quot;″s release in 1978. It contains three separate game modes. The home ports include &quot;Breakout&quot; as a fourth mode, using the &quot;Super Breakout&quot; visual style.

&quot;Breakout 2000&quot; for the Atari Jaguar adds a 3D playfield and additional features.

A 3D &quot;Breakout&quot;-inspired game was published simply as &quot;Breakout&quot; in 2000 for the PC and PlayStation by Hasbro Interactive&#x27;s Atari Interactive subsidiary.

In 2011, Atari S.A. released an updated version of &quot;Breakout&quot; as &quot;Breakout Boost&quot;. The chief difference is the addition of improved graphics, power-ups, and unique brick types.

Another enhanced version of the game was announced in 2018 for the Intellivision Amico.

===&quot;Breakout: Recharged&quot;===
A revamped version of the game titled, &quot;Breakout: Recharged&quot;, was released on February 10, 2022, for Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, Microsoft Windows and Atari VCS as part of the &quot;Atari Recharged&quot; series. It was developed by Adamvision Studios and SneakyBox.

===&quot;Pilgrim in the Microworld&quot;===
&quot;Pilgrim in the Microworld&quot; is an autobiography by David Sudnow detailing his obsession with &quot;Breakout&quot;. Sudnow describes studying the game&#x27;s mechanics, visiting the manufacturer in Silicon Valley, and interviewing the programmers.

===Easter eggs===
The first-generation iPod Classic has an Easter egg where holding down the center button for a few seconds in the &quot;About&quot; menu causes &quot;Breakout&quot; to appear.

On the 37th anniversary of the game&#x27;s release, Google released a secret version of &quot;Breakout&quot; accessible by typing &quot;atari breakout&quot; in Google Images. The image thumbnails form the &quot;breakout&quot; bricks, turn different colors, and after a ball and paddle appear the game begins.

<text>Shadi Sukiya () is a Palestinian who was arrested by the Israel Defense Forces in International Solidarity Movement (ISM)&#x27;s Jenin office on March 27, 2003. Israel argued, he was a senior Islamic Jihad member.

==Controversy==
The ISM&#x27;s statements and those of the Israeli government both state that Sukiya arrived at the ISM&#x27;s office as he was being pursued through the streets of Jenin by IDF soldiers during an Israeli-imposed curfew. According to the ISM&#x27;s account, he had been going door to door looking for a place to go, arrived at the building (which is also used by the Red Cross and Medecins Sans Frontieres) cold and wet, and was offered a chance to dry and warm up by an ISM volunteer.

The IDF originally suggested that two Kalashnikov assault rifles and a handgun were found on the premises, but subsequently backtracked on the allegation (it appears the weapons were found during the operation, but not in the ISM&#x27;s building).

In May 2003 the ISM&#x27;s Adam Shapiro stated that Sukiya was not named a &quot;senior Islamic Jihad terrorist&quot; by any official Israeli military or government source and was being held in administrative detention in Israel without any charge. However, ISM members have admitted that they have worked on non-violent protests with members of Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad.

<text>Encounter With Tiber () is a 1996 science fiction novel written by former astronaut Buzz Aldrin and science fiction writer John Barnes. A working title, used on some advance covers for the British edition, was &quot;The Tides of Tiber&quot;.

==Plot summary==
Evidence is found of an intelligent alien species who visited the Earth long ago and left an encyclopedia with the collected knowledge of their culture. The story is told from the point of view of a human historian on a star ship on the way to Alpha Centauri (the aliens&#x27; home star) who is using the time in transit to translate two alien books and to write a history of how humans gained access to the aliens&#x27; knowledge.

9000 years ago the alien society in the Alpha Centauri system was under threat of cosmic bombardment. Their only hope to survive was to explore and colonize nearby space. On 21st century Earth, astronauts find artifacts left by this civilization and wonder who they were.

The narrator is a historian who is part of a mission to the Alpha Centauri system, the home system of the aliens. As all crew members were required to bring several projects to work on, due to the decades long nature of the mission, she spends her time writing biographies of several family members who were closely involved in the acquisition of a repository of the aliens&#x27; knowledge. As another project, she translates two autobiographies by the aliens who had visited the Solar System over 9000 years earlier.

<doc id="453260" wikidata="Q1538405" url="?curid=453260" title="Robert Ross (British Army officer)">
<text>Major-General Robert Ross (176612 September 1814) was an Irish officer in the British Army who served in the Napoleonic Wars and its theatre in North America in the War of 1812.

Ross joined the British Army in 1789. He served as an officer in several battles during the Napoleonic Wars, including the Battles of Maida and Corunna, gaining promotion to colonel. In 1809, he was sent to serve in the Peninsular War, including the Battles of Vittoria, Roncesvalles, Sorauren, and Orthez. He was wounded in the neck at the Battle of Orthez in France on 27 February 1814.

Upon returning to duty later that year, Ross was made a major general and sent to North America, as commander of &quot;all British forces on the East Coast&quot;. In August 1814, he reached Benedict, Maryland and continued on, leading the professional soldiers who quickly defeated a poorly organized American militia at the Battle of Bladensburg on 24 August; that evening, he led his troops into Washington D.C.

During his command of the Burning of Washington many important U.S. Government buildings, including the White House and the Capitol were damaged, demoralizing and greatly damaging the American war effort. Ross then led a British invasion north up the Chesapeake Bay towards the city of Baltimore which culminated in the Battle of Baltimore that September. On 12 September, he was shot while commanding troops at North Point, and died while being moved to the rear.

==Early life==
Ross was born in Rostrevor, County Down, Ireland, to Major David Ross, an officer in the Seven Years&#x27; War and his wife, Elizabeth Adderley, the maternal half-sister of James Caulfeild, 1st Earl of Charlemont. He was educated at Trinity College Dublin in Ireland, where he was a treasurer of the College Historical Society and joined the 25th Regiment of Foot as an ensign in 1789.

==Napoleonic Wars==

Ross fought as a junior officer at the battles of Krabbendam in the Netherlands in 1799 and the Battle of Alexandria in Egypt in 1801. In 1803, he was promoted to major and given command of the 20th Regiment of Foot. He next fought at the Battle of Maida in the Kingdom of Naples in 1806.

===Peninsular War===
He was promoted to lieutenant–colonel at the end of 1808 and fought in the Battle of Corunna in Spain in early 1809 during the Peninsular War. In 1810, Ross was made a full colonel as well as aide-de-camp to the King.

In 1813, Ross was sent to serve under Arthur Wellesley and commanded his regiment at the battles of Vittoria, Roncesvalles, and Sorauren that year. He was seriously wounded in the left side of his neck at the Battle of Orthez, on 27 February 1814, and had just returned to service when he was given command of an expeditionary force to attack the United States.

==War of 1812==

Ross sailed to North America as a major general to take charge of all British troops off the east coast of the United States. He personally led the British troops ashore in Benedict, Maryland, and marched through Upper Marlboro, Maryland, to the attack on the Americans at the Battle of Bladensburg on 24 August 1814, routing the hastily organised militia units that opposed him. 
Author Steve Vogel credits Ross&#x27; strategy for the success at Bladensburg: &quot;He conducted a brilliant campaign of deception, feinting one way or the other, marching and then doubling back, and was able to paralyze the Americans and prevent them from defending Bladensburg&quot;.

===The capture of Washington===

After the victory at Bladensburg, Ross was persuaded by Rear-Admiral George Cockburn that they could take Washington, D.C., and late in the evening of 24 August his army of 4,500 men (including 1,000 Royal Marines from Cockburn&#x27;s flotilla) captured the capital, in spite of a larger contingent of American defenders. Under Ross&#x27; direction, his troops set fire to the city&#x27;s public buildings, including the White House and the United States Capitol. Extensive damage to the interiors and the contents of both were subsequently reported.

Ross refused to accept Cockburn&#x27;s recommendation to also damage private property. The attack on the National Intelligencer newspaper was led by Cockburn.
Ross ordered the preservation of private property however, threatening his men with punishment if they disobeyed.

A CBC News article described Ross as a &quot;reluctant arsonist&quot; who needed persuasion from Cockburn to cause intentional damage. Although Cockburn had been optimistic about the possibility of capturing the capital city, author John McCavitt asserted that Ross &quot;never dreamt for one minute that an army of 3,500 men with 1,000 marines reinforcement, with no cavalry, hardly any artillery, could march 50 miles inland and capture an enemy capital&quot;.

===Death===

At the urging of Cockburn and army quartermaster-general Lieutenant George de Lacy Evans, Ross then led his army against Baltimore. His troops subsequently landed at the southern tip of the &quot;Patapsco Neck&quot; peninsula (between the Patapsco River and Baltimore Harbor on the south and Back River on the north) of southeastern Baltimore County at North Point, twelve miles southeast from the city, on the morning of 12 September 1814. En route to what would be the Battle of North Point, a part of the larger Battle of Baltimore, the British advance encountered American skirmishers. General Ross rode forward to personally direct his troops. An American sharpshooter shot him through the right arm into the chest. According to Baltimore folklore, two American riflemen, Daniel Wells, 18, and Henry McComas, 19, fired at him and one of them had fired the fatal shot; both were killed shortly afterward. Ross was killed while he was being transported back to the fleet before being shot by the American sharpshooter.
Ross&#x27;s body was preserved in a barrel of 129 gallons (586 L) of Jamaican rum aboard HMS &quot;Tonnant&quot;. When the &quot;Tonnant&quot; was diverted to New Orleans, his body was shipped on the British ship HMS &quot;Royal Oak&quot; to Halifax, Nova Scotia, where his body was interred on 29 September 1814 in the Old Burying Ground.

==Legacy==
In Ross&#x27;s home village of Rostrevor, County Down in Northern Ireland, he is commemorated by a 99-foot granite obelisk near the shoreline of Carlingford Lough. The Monument, a 100-foot granite obelisk, was restored in 2008. A smaller monument was erected in Kilbroney Parish Church by troops who had served with Ross at the Battle of Maida in 1806. This granite memorial was erected in 1826 &quot;on a hill within view of his heartbroken widow’s home&quot;, according to a 2013 report.

Ross is also commemorated by a National Monument in St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral in London, England. The latter is described by a book about Ross as: &quot;Britannia is represented weeping over the tomb of the departed warrior, over which an, American flag is being deposited by a figure of Valour, while Fame descends with a wreath of laurels to crown the hero’s head&quot;.

The inscription on the National Monument reads:


By the beginning of the Troubles in the 1960s, the monument in Rostrevor—now located in a predominantly Roman Catholic region—was largely neglected and overgrown by brambles; this may have contributed to its avoiding the same fate as Nelson&#x27;s Pillar in Dublin, which was reportedly blown up by the IRA in 1966. After the Good Friday Agreement in 1998, the Newry and Mourne District Council, though largely Irish republican, agreed to refurbish the monument as part of Rostrevor&#x27;s history, and it was reopened in 2008.

Neither General Ross nor his immediate descendants were knighted while he was living or received a title of nobility. However, his descendants were given an augmentation of honour to the Ross armorial bearings (namely, the addition of a chief to the shield and a second crest, both depicting an arm grasping the old American flag 15 stars and 15 stripes (Star-Spangled Banner (flag) of 1795-1818) on a broken staff, along with the additional motto of &quot;Bladensburg&quot;) and the family name was changed to the victory title &quot;Ross-of-Bladensburg&quot;, which was granted to his widow.

In honour of the Federal City and national capital&#x27;s history of Washington, D.C., there is also a portrait of the infamous General Ross in the United States Capitol&#x27;s central rotunda, along with a small art decorative vignette near a corridor ceiling portraying the Burning of Washington and exhibits in the recently constructed underground visitors&#x27; center on the Capitol&#x27;s east front. Along with several illustrations / exhibits in various War of 1812 historical sites / museums in the Baltimore metropolitan area, including a stone obelisk monument near the site off Old North Point Road in southeastern Baltimore County, erected in memory of Aquila Randall who was also killed here (dedicated in 1817 by fellow soldiers and officers of his Maryland Militia regiment), and where General Ross supposedly was shot. Additional details and exhibits have been preserved in various Baltimore historical institutions, such as the Star Spangled Banner Flag House (also known recently as the Flag House and Star-Spangled Banner Museum), 1793 historic home of flagmaker Mary Young Pickersgill in the Jonestown / Old Town neighborhood of Downtown / East Baltimore) and the National Park Service&#x27;s landmark site of Fort McHenry&#x27;s new visitor center extensive exhibits on Whetstone Point, by the Baltimore harbor, and also in the local community&#x27;s Dundalk-Patapsco Neck Historical Society museum in Dundalk, Maryland, near the 1814 North Point battlefield in outlying southeast Baltimore County.

According to a biographical history of the Major-General by Robert Lacy,Ross was a soldier who combined caution with courage. He was immensely popular with his men because of his willingness to share their hardships and to fight alongside them in the thick of battle. A colleague said of him that
he could not be &#x27;a better man nor a more zealous officer&#x27;. Ross also commanded the respect and admiration of his opponents because of his unfailing courtesy and chivalrous conduct. One of the leading physicians then residing in 1814 Washington paid tribute to Ross’s ‘consummate modesty and politeness’.

Local lore indicates that the two snipers/riflemen Daniel Wells and Henry McComas (of the unit of Aisquith&#x27;s Sharpshooters&quot;) were first buried in a local churchyard mourned by their fellow militia soldiers and citizens of the Town, but forty years later in the 1850s were exhumed and reburied after elaborate processions and funerals in a monumental tomb with a stone obelisk in what was known then as Ashland Square. Currently, off of the triangular intersection of Aisquith, East Monument and North Gay Streets in the Jonestown/Old Town neighborhood of East Baltimore. Occasional memorial ceremonies are still held for them by War of 1812 descendents and heritage societies. The Wells-McComas Monument is depicted on the embroidered shoulder patch insignia of the Baltimore County Sheriff&#x27;s Office for deputy sheriffs. City streets were also named for them in South Baltimore, off South Hanover Street (Maryland Route 2).

<doc id="453262" wikidata="Q155891" url="?curid=453262" title="Mycobacterium leprae">
<text>Mycobacterium leprae (also known as the leprosy bacillus or Hansen&#x27;s bacillus) is one
of the two species of bacteria that cause Hansen&#x27;s disease (leprosy), a chronic but curable infectious disease that damages the peripheral nerves and targets the skin, eyes, nose, and muscles.

It is an acid-fast, Gram-positive, rod shaped bacterium and an obligate intracellular parasite, which means, unlike its relative &quot;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&quot;, it cannot be grown in cell-free laboratory media. This is likely due to gene deletion and decay that the genome of the species has experienced via reductive evolution, which has caused the bacterium to depend heavily on its host for nutrients and metabolic intermediates. It has a narrow host range and apart from humans, the only other natural hosts are nine-banded armadillo and red squirrels. 
The bacteria infect mainly macrophages and Schwann cells, and are typically found congregated as a palisade.

&quot;Mycobacterium leprae&quot; was sensitive to dapsone as a treatment alone, but since the 1960s, it has developed resistance against this antibiotic. Currently, a multidrug treatment (MDT) is recommended by the World Health Organization, including dapsone, rifampicin, and clofazimine. The species was discovered in 1873 by the Norwegian physician Gerhard Armauer Hansen, and was the first bacterium to be identified as a cause of disease in humans.

== Microbiology ==
&quot;Mycobacterium leprae&quot; is an intracellular, pleomorphic, non-sporing, non-motile, acid-fast, pathogenic bacterium. It is an aerobic bacillus (rod-shaped bacterium) with parallel sides and round ends, surrounded by the characteristic waxy coating of mycolic acid unique to mycobacteria. It is Gram-positive by Gram staining, but &quot;Mycobacterium leprae&quot; was traditionally stained with carbol fuchsin in the Ziehl–Neelsen stain. Because the bacilli are less acid-fast than &quot;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&quot; (MTB), the Fite-Faraco staining method, which has a lower acid concentration, is used now. In size and shape, it closely resembles MTB. The bacteria are found in the granulomatous lesions and are especially numerous in the nodules. This bacteria often occur in large numbers within the lesions of lepromatous leprosy and are usually grouped together as a palisade. 
By optical microscopy of host cells, &quot;Mycobacterium leprae&quot; can be found singly or in clumps referred to as &quot;globi&quot;, the bacilli can be straight or slightly curved, with a length ranging from 1–8 μm and a diameter of 0.3 μm. The bacteria grow best at 27 to 30 °C, making the skin, nasal mucosa and peripheral nerves primary targets for infection by &quot;Mycobacterium leprae&quot;.

== Host range ==
&quot;Mycobacterium leprae&quot; has a narrow host range and apart from humans the only other hosts are nine-banded armadillos and red squirrels, and armadillos have been implicated as a source of zoonotic leprosy in humans. In the laboratory, mice can be infected and this is a useful animal model.

=== Cultivation ===
&quot;Mycobacterium leprae&quot; has an unusually lengthy doubling time (ranging from 12 to 14 days compared with 20 minutes for &quot;Escherichia coli&quot;), as well as its inability to be cultured in the laboratory. Because the organism is an obligate intracellular parasite, it lacks many necessary genes for independent survival, causing difficulty in culturing the organism. The complex and unique cell wall that makes members of the genus &quot;Mycobacterium&quot; difficult to destroy is also the reason for its extremely slow replication rate. &quot;Mycobacterium leprae&quot; prefers cool temperatures, slightly acidic microaerophilic conditions, and prefers the use of lipids as an energy source over sugars. The growth conditions needed for &quot;Mycobacterium leprae&quot; are known, but an exact axenic medium to support the growth of &quot;Mycobacterium leprae&quot; still has yet to be discovered. Since &quot;in vitro&quot; cultivation is not generally possible, it has instead been grown in mouse foot pads, and in armadillos due to their low core body temperature.

== Metabolism ==
The reductive evolution experienced by the &quot;Mycobacterium leprae&quot; genome has impaired its metabolic abilities in comparison to other &quot;Mycobacterium,&quot; specifically in its catabolic pathways.

=== Catabolism ===
&quot;Mycobacterium leprae&quot;″s inability to be grown in axenic media indicates its reliance on nutrients and intermediates from its host. Many of the catabolic pathways present in other &quot;Mycobacterium&quot; species are compromised, due to the absence of enzymes that play key roles in degradation of nutrients. &quot;Mycobacterium leprae&quot; has lost the ability to use common carbon sources, such as acetate and galactose, in its central energy metabolism pathways. Additionally, lipid degradation is impaired, with deficits in key lipase enzymes, and other proteins involved in lipolysis. Functional carbon catabolic pathways continue to exist in the species, such as the glycolytic pathway, the pentose phosphate pathway, and the TCA cycle. These deficiencies extensively restricts the microbe&#x27;s growth to a limited number of carbon sources, such as host-derived intermediates.

=== Anabolism ===
&quot;Mycobacterium leprae&quot;&#x27;s anabolic pathways have been largely unaffected by its reductive evolution. The species retains its ability for the synthesis of genetic material, such as purines, pyrimidines, nucleotides, and nucleosides, as well as the synthesis of all amino acids, except for methionine and lysine.

== Genome ==
The first genome sequence of a strain of &quot;Mycobacterium leprae&quot; was completed in 2001, revealing 1604 protein-coding genes and another 1,116 pseudogenes. The genome sequence of a strain originally isolated in Tamil Nadu, India, and designated &quot;TN&quot;, was completed in 2013. This genome sequence contains 3,268,203 base pairs (bp) and an average G+C content of 57.8%, which is significantly less than &quot;M. tuberculosis&quot;, which has 4,441,529 bp and 65.6% G+C.

Comparing the genome sequence of &quot;Mycobacterium leprae&quot; with that of MTB reveals an extreme case of reductive evolution. Less than half of the genome contains functional genes. It is estimated approximately 2000 genes from &quot;Mycobacterium leprae&quot; genome has been lost. Gene deletion and decay appear to have eliminated many important metabolic activities, including siderophore production, part of the oxidative and most of the microaerophilic and anaerobic respiratory chains, and numerous catabolic systems and their regulatory circuits. This reductive evolution is largely linked to the organism&#x27;s development into an obligate intracellular bacterium.

=== Pseudogenes ===
Many of the genes that were present in the genome of the common ancestor of &quot;Mycobacterium leprae&quot; and &quot;M. tuberculosis&quot; have been lost in the &quot;Mycobacterium leprae&quot; genome. Due to &quot;Mycobacterium leprae&#x27;s&quot; reliance on a host organism, many of the species&#x27; DNA repair functions have been lost, increasing the occurrence of deletion mutations. Because the products supplied by these deleted genes are typically present in the host cells infected by &quot;Mycobacterium leprae&quot;, the impact that the mutations have on the microbe is minimal, allowing for survival within the host despite its reduced genome. Consequently, &quot;Mycobacterium leprae&quot; has undergone a dramatic reduction in genome size with the loss of many genes. Over half of the pathogen&#x27;s genome is now made up by pseudogenes due to the pathogen undergoing what is known as reductive evolution. Among published genomes, &quot;Mycobacterium leprae&quot; contains the highest number of pseudogens (&gt;1000). Many of these pseudogenes arose from insertions of stop codons which may have been caused by sigma factor dysfunction (a protein needed for initiation of transcription in bacteria) or the insertion of transposon- derived repetitive sequences. Some of the &quot;Mycobacterium leprae&quot; pseudogens expression levels will alter upon infection of macrophages, which suggests that some &quot;Mycobacterium leprae&quot; pseudogens are not all &quot;decayed&quot; genes, but could also function in infection, intracellular replication, and replication. This genome reduction is not complete. Downsizing from a genome of 4.42 Mbp, such as that of &quot;M. tuberculosis&quot;, to one of 3.27 Mbp would account for the loss of some 1200 protein-coding sequences.

=== Essential enzymes ===
There are eight essential enzymes for &quot;Mycobacterium leprae&quot;, and one of them is alanine racemase (alr). This enzyme is significant because it is found in D-alanine—D-alanine ligase and alanine/Aspartate metabolism. Other essential enzymes include putative dTDP4deydrorhamnose 3, 5epimerase (rm1C) which plays an important role in both Nucleotide sugar metabolism and polyketide sugar unit biosynthesis. Petidoglycan biosynthesis also require murG, murF, MurE, murY, murC, and murD, the remaining six essential enzymes for &quot;mycobacterium leprae.&quot; 

== Distribution ==
The bacterium has a global distribution in humans but the highest prevalence is in sub-Saharan Africa, Asia and South America. The geographic occurrences of &quot;Mycobacterium leprae&quot; include: Angola, Brazil, Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Federated States of Micronesia, India, Kiribati, Madagascar, Nepal, Republic of Marshall Islands, and the United Republic of Tanzania.

Since the introduction of multidrug therapy (MDT) in the 1980s, the prevalence of leprosy cases has declined by 95%. This decline led the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare leprosy eliminated as a public health problem, defined as a prevalence of less than one leprosy patient per 10,000 population. Aside from &quot;Mycobacterium leprae&quot; transmission from infected humans, environmental sources could also be an important reservoir. &quot;Mycobacterium leprae&quot; DNA was detected in soil from houses of leprosy patients in Bangladesh, armadillos&#x27; holes in Suriname and habitats of lepromatous red squirrels in the British Isles. One study found numerous reports of leprosy cases with a history of contact with armadillos in the United States. A zoonotic transmission pathway from exposure to armadillos has been proposed, with human patients from a previous study in southeastern United States shown to be infected with the same armadillo-associated &quot;Mycobacterium leprae&quot; genotype. High rates of &quot;Mycobacterium leprae&quot; infection were observed in armadillos in the Brazilian state of Pará, and individuals who frequently consumed armadillo meat showed a significantly higher titres of the M. leprae-specific antigen, phenolic glycolipid I (PGL-I) compared with those who did not or ate them less frequently.

== Evolution ==
The closest relative to &quot;Mycobacterium leprae&quot; is &quot;Mycobacterium lepromatosis&quot;. These species diverged (95% highest posterior density – ) The most recent common ancestor of the extant &quot;Mycobacterium leprae&quot; strains was calculated to have lived 3,607 years ago (95% highest posterior density 2204–5525 years ago). The estimated substitution rate was 7.67 x 10−9 substitutions per site per year, similar to other bacteria.

A study of genomes isolated from medieval cases estimated the mutation rate to be 6.13 × 10−9. The authors also showed that the leprosy bacillus in the Americas was brought there from Europe. Another study suggests that &quot;Mycobacterium leprae&quot; originated in East Africa and spread from there to Europe and the Middle East initially before spreading to West Africa and the Americas in the last 500 years.

Almost complete sequences of &quot;Mycobacterium leprae&quot; from medieval skeletons with osteological lesions suggestive of leprosy from different Europe geographic origins were obtained using DNA capture techniques and high-throughput sequencing. Ancient sequences were compared with those of modern strains from biopsies of leprosy patients representing diverse genotypes and geographic origins, giving new insights in the understanding of its evolution and course through history, phylogeography of the leprosy bacillus, and the disappearance of leprosy from Europe.

Verena J. Schuenemann &quot;et al.&quot; demonstrated a remarkable genomic conservation during the past 1000 years and a close similarity between modern and ancient strains, suggesting that the sudden decline of leprosy in Europe was not due to a loss of virulence, but due to extraneous factors, such as other infectious diseases, changes in host immunity, or improved social conditions.

== Pathogenesis ==

The incubation period of &quot;Mycobacterium leprae&quot; ranges from 9 months to 20 years. The bacterium replicates intracellularly inside histiocytes and nerve cells and has two forms. One form is &quot;tuberculoid&quot;, which induces a cell-mediated response that limits its growth, and has few detectible bacilli (paucibacillary). Through this form, &quot;Mycobacterium leprae&quot; multiplies at the site of entry, usually the skin, invading and colonizing Schwann cells. The bacterium then induces T-helper lymphocytes, epithelioid cells, and giant cell infiltration of the skin, causing infected individuals to exhibit large flattened patches with raised and elevated red edges on their skin. These patches have dry, pale, hairless centers, accompanied by a loss of sensation on the skin. The loss of sensation may develop as a result of invasion of the peripheral sensory nerves. The macule at the cutaneous site of entry and the loss of pain sensation are key clinical indications that an individual has a tuberculoid form of leprosy.
 The second form of leprosy is the &quot;lepromatous&quot; form, in which the microbes proliferate within the macrophages at the site of entry, and has many detectable bacilli (multibacillary). They also grow within the epithelial tissues of the face and ear lobes. The suppressor T-cells that are induced are numerous, but the epithelioid and giant cells are rare or absent. With cell-mediated immunity impaired, large numbers of &quot;Mycobacterium leprae&quot; appear in the macrophages and the infected patients develop papules at the entry site, marked by a folding of the skin. Gradual destruction of cutaneous nerves lead to what is referred to as &quot;classic lion face&quot;. Extensive penetration by this bacterium may lead to severe body damage; for example the loss of bones, fingers, and toes.

== Symptoms of a &quot;Mycobacterium leprae&quot; infection ==
The symptoms of a &quot;Mycobacterium leprae&quot; infection, also known as leprosy, are skin sores that are pale in color, lumps or bumps that do not go away after several weeks or months, nerve damage which can lead to complications with the ability to sense feeling in the arms and legs as well as muscle weakness. Symptoms usually take 3–5 years from being exposed to manifest within the body. However, some individuals do not begin to show symptoms until 20 years after exposure to the disease. This long incubation period makes the ability to properly be able to diagnose when an individual came into contact with the disease very difficult.

In armadillos, &quot;Mycobacterium leprae&quot; causes a disseminated infection with similar structural and pathological changes in tissues and nerves.

In squirrels, according the to Veterinary Pathology Unit of the University of Edinburgh, &quot; The disease is unmistakeable: there is gross swelling and loss of hair around the snout, lips, eyelids, ears, genitalia and sometimes feet and lower limbs. This bare skin has a &quot;shiny&quot; appearance. The squirrel is usually in generally poor body condition and may have a heavy burden of parasites like fleas, ticks and mites.&quot;
== Treatment ==
The mycolic acids in the bacteria&#x27;s cell walls afford resistance to many antibiotics and are a major virulence factor. Multidrug therapy (MDT) was recommended by WHO Expert Committee in 1984, and became the standard leprosy treatment. MDT has been supplied by WHO for free since 1995 to endemic countries. MDT is used to treat leprosy because treatment of leprosy with one drug (monotherapy) can result in drug resistance. The drug combination used in MDT will depend on the classification of the disease. WHO recommends patients with multibacillary leprosy use a combination of Rifampicin, Clofazimine, and Dapsone for 12 months. WHO recommends patients with paulibacilalry leprosy use combination of Rifampicin and Dapsone for a duration of 6 months. Antibiotics must be taken regularly until treatment is complete because &quot;Mycobacterium leprae&quot; can become drug resistant. Effectiveness of the treatment can be determined with the use of an acid-fast stain of &quot;Mycobacterium leprae&quot; from a skin smear to estimate the number of bacilli still present in the patient.

The number of reported cases of leprosy annually is around 250,000 cases indicating that the chain of transmission has yet to be broken despite the use of MDT leading to a 90% reduction in the prevalence rate of leprosy. This makes it very evident that control of the disease is not yet where it needs to be calling for the need in continued research towards treatment and control.

A preventive measure of &quot;Mycobacterium leprae&quot; is to avoid close contact with infectious people who are untreated. Blindness, crippling of the hands and feet, and paralysis are all effects of nerve damage associated with untreated &quot;M. leprae.&quot; Treatment does not reverse the nerve damage done, which is why early treatment is needed. The Bacillus Calmette–Guérin vaccine offers a variable amount of protection against leprosy in addition to its main target of tuberculosis.

=== Targets of antibiotics ===
Dapsone competitively inhibits the enzyme dihydropteroate synthase (DHPS) resulting in decreases the production of tetrahydrofolate, which is an essential component of nucleic acid biosynthesis in &quot;M. leprae.&quot; Rifampin will interrupt binding of the β-subunit of the DNA-dependent RNA polymerase, which will uncouple mRNA production and results in cell death. Clofazimine&#x27;s mechanisms are not fully understood regarding &quot;Mycobacterium leprae&quot;, but the drug&#x27;s binding appear to occur at base sequences with guanine, which may explain why clofazimine has a preference for G+C rich genomes of mycobacteria over human DNA. The binding of clofazimine to mycobacterial DNA can has been proven as weakly bactericidal against &quot;Mycobacterium leprae&quot; in mice, which is why it is not suitable for single drug therapy for leprosy. Out of the three main drugs rifampin is more bactericidal than either dapsone or clofazimine.

=== Potential antibiotic targets ===
It is important to find new targets for antibiotics due to increasing resistance. &quot;Mycobacterium leprae&quot; has six essential enzymes murC, murD, murE, murF, murG, and murY that are all essential for peptidoglycan biosynthesis in &quot;M. leprae.&quot; These enzymes and peptidoglycan biosynthesis are potential targets for antibiotics. By targeting these enzymes, which catalyze additions of short polypeptide chains, synthesis of the bacterial cell wall can be prevented.

===Antibiotic resistance ===
Resistance to antibiotics is seen in around 10% of new cases of leprosy and in around 15% of relapsed cases.
Drug resistance in &quot;Mycobacterium leprae&quot; is thought to be from genetic alterations in the antibiotic targets and a reduction in cell wall permeability. Compared to the amount of efflux pumps in &quot;M. tuberculosis, Mycobacterium leprae&quot; contains about half as many. The efflux pumps contributing to drug resistance and virulence in &quot;M. tuberculosis&quot; have been retained throughout the genome reductive evolution that &quot;Mycobacterium leprae&quot; underwent.

== Discovery ==

&quot;Mycobacterium leprae&quot; was discovered in 1873 by the Norwegian physician Gerhard Armauer Hansen (1841–1912), and was the first bacterium to be identified as a cause of disease in humans. It was confirmed to be a bacterium by Albert Ludwig Sigesmund Neisser who argued with Hansen
over priority for the discovery. Hansen&#x27;s attempts to infect animals with the bacteria were unsuccessful. When, in 1879, he injected, without consent, tissue from a person with lepromatous leprosy into the eye of 33-year old Kari Nielsdatter who had the milder tuberculoid form of the infection, he was dismissed from his post at the Leprosy Hospital in Bergen and was banned from practising medicine. The case had little effect on Hansen&#x27;s professional reputation, and he continued with his research.

<text>Allied Force Headquarters (AFHQ) was the headquarters that controlled all Allied operational forces in the Mediterranean theatre of World War II from August 1942 until the end of the war in Europe in May 1945.

==History==
AFHQ was established in the United Kingdom on 14 August 1942 under Lieutenant General Dwight D. Eisenhower in order to command the forces committed to Operation Torch, the Allied invasion of French North Africa, set for November. Eisenhower had the title Commander-in-Chief, Allied Expeditionary Force. Shortly after the establishment of the headquarters, &quot;Expeditionary&quot; was deleted from its title, for reasons of operational security. Eisenhower thus became Commander-in-Chief, Allied Force. The HQ was moved to Gibraltar on 5 November 1942, and then on to Algiers on 28 November 1942.

Towards the end of 1942, there was a need to unify command of the Allied forces in North Africa, since those from the west, the British First Army, under the command of Lieutenant-General Kenneth Anderson, landed during Operation Torch, and those from the east, the British Eighth Army, commanded by Lieutenant-General Bernard Montgomery, that had fought and won the Second Battle of El Alamein, were now close enough together to need coordination. Therefore, on 10 February 1943, AFHQ assumed control of the Eighth Army advancing from the east as well.

In March 1943 AFHQ supervised Mediterranean Air Command (later replaced by the Mediterranean Allied Air Forces); 18th Army Group; the Royal Navy Commander-in-Chief, of the Mediterranean Fleet, acting as the Allied naval commander, and the Fifth United States Army.

Eisenhower remained in command of AFHQ until 16 January 1944, overseeing the Allied invasion of Sicily (with the codename of Operation Husky) which began on 10 July 1943, and the Allied invasion of the Italian mainland (Operation Baytown and Operation Avalanche) on 3 September 1943. Eisenhower, then a full general, returned to the United Kingdom on 14 January 1944 to assume command 2 days later of the Allied forces assembling for Operation Overlord, the Allied invasion of Normandy, scheduled for the spring of 1944. He was succeeded by General Sir Henry Maitland Wilson. Wilson&#x27;s title became Supreme Commander, Mediterranean theater of operations.

Wilson was in command for just under a year, until he was sent to Washington, D.C., in December 1944 to replace Field Marshal Sir John Dill of the British Joint Staff Mission who had died suddenly. Wilson was succeeded by Field Marshal Sir Harold Alexander who was Supreme Commander and commander of AFHQ until the end of the war. After the war AFHQ became a small inter-allied staff responsible for combined command liquidation activities and commanded by Lieutenant-General Sir William Duthie Morgan as Supreme Allied Commander Mediterranean. AFHQ was abolished, effective 17 September 1947, by General Order 24, AFHQ, on 16 September 1947.

<doc id="453272" wikidata="Q466268" url="?curid=453272" title="Isabella of Portugal, Duchess of Burgundy">
<text>Isabella of Portugal (; 21 February 1397 – 17 December 1471) was Duchess of Burgundy from 1430 to 1467 as the third wife of Duke Philip the Good. Their son was Charles the Bold, the last Valois Duke of Burgundy.

Born a Portuguese &quot;infanta&quot; of the House of Aviz, Isabella was the only surviving daughter of King John I of Portugal and his wife Philippa of Lancaster. She served as the regent of the Burgundian Low Countries during the absence of her spouse in 1432 and in 1441–1443. Isabella served as her husband&#x27;s representative in negotiations with England regarding trade relations in 1439 and those with the rebellious cities of Holland in 1444. 

==Early life==
Isabella was born to John I of Portugal and Philippa of Lancaster, who had six children survive infancy. Born in 1397 in Évora, and raised in the Portuguese court in Lisbon, Isabella was the fourth child and only daughter to survive to adulthood. Philippa instilled in all her children, including her daughter, a sense of duty, faith and belief in education. Isabella was an avid reader, becoming proficient in Latin, French, English, and Italian. She was also interested in politics, joining her brothers in their lessons on affairs of state. Isabella also enjoyed riding and hunting with her brothers.

In 1415 Isabella received an offer of marriage from her cousin Henry V of England, an effort for England to form closer links with Portugal against France. The negotiations failed and Isabella remained unmarried. Also in 1415 she grieved at the death of her mother on 19 July, with whom she had a close relationship.

== Marriage negotiations ==
Aged 31, Isabella was still unmarried when the Burgundian house of Valois provided her with an offer of marriage in 1428. The reigning Duke of Burgundy, Philip the Good, had already been widowed twice - by Michelle of Valois and Bonne of Artois. Neither marriage left surviving issue. For his third wife, Philip was anxious to seek a candidate from a nation allied to England to secure his alliance with it further. Isabella was attractive to Philip as a potential consort being well-bred, shrewd and accomplished.

On 19 October 1428, Philip sent a delegation from Sluys led by his chief counsellor, the Seigneur de Roubaix, that arrived in Lisbon on 16 December after calling at Sandwich until 2 December and acquiring two more ships. The delegation waited another month while Isabella&#x27;s father and brothers met at Aviz to discuss the matter. On 19 January 1429, a formal request for the Infanta&#x27;s hand was made by the Burgundians, and discussions between the two parties began. The Portuguese agreed to the marriage and sent messengers on 2 February to receive the Duke of Burgundy&#x27;s formal response, signed on 5 May and received by the Portuguese on 4 June. The marriage contract was drawn up, and Isabella, still in Portugal, was married to Philip the Good by proxy on 24 July 1429, with Roubaix acting as groom. 
==Duchess of Burgundy==
Isabella did not leave Portugal for another eight weeks. Her father had a fleet and trousseau prepared and on 19 October 1429, with a flotilla of about 20 ships, Isabella—accompanied by almost 2000 Portuguese—left Portugal forever. After an eleven-week journey when the fleet was beset by storms, causing the loss of several ships and much of her bridal trousseau, the convoy reached Sluys on 25 December 1429. The Duchess disembarked the following day where she and Philip celebrated their formal religious marriage two weeks later, on 7 January 1430. She arrived in Bruges on 8 January 1430. 

Following a week of celebrations in Bruges, the newlyweds then travelled through the main territories of Burgundy: from Ghent (16 January) to Kortrijk (13 February) to Lille, and then to Brussels, Arras, Péronne-en-Mélantois, Mechelen and, by mid-March Noyon, where Isabella, now pregnant, chose to rest through the spring, only leaving when Joan of Arc led a campaign against the nearby Compiègne. She then returned to Ghent, where she dealt with a potential guild uprising. 

Isabella was at first unprepared for the lavish style of court life in Burgundy, one of the most extravagant in Europe. The Portuguese infanta, described by the Burgundian embassy that had negotiated her marriage as appearing to their eyes as a nun when they had first met, and now dressed in loose clothing and flat over-panels to hide her pregnancy, looked particularly dowdy at her new court. More upsetting to Isabella, however, was her husband&#x27;s behaviour. He had showered gifts on her when she had first arrived, and still more when she had become pregnant; yet, he made it clear that he had no intention of keeping his vows of fidelity and chastity. He kept numerous women as his lovers, most living away from the court, and fathered a large number of illegitimate children.

Isabella gave birth to her first child on 30 December 1430 at Coudenberg in Brussels, a year after her marriage. The child, Antoine, sickly at birth, was christened on 16 January 1431, and soon after both parents left to attend to ducal business. By the autumn of that year, Isabella was once again pregnant with their second son, Joseph; more importantly, she had spent a long continuous period of time with her husband, and demonstrated her intelligence and abilities, as well as her commitment to Burgundian independence. Because of this, when Charles VII of France began attacking Burgundy in January 1432, Philip—leaving Coudenburg to defend Dijon—ordered that she represent him during his absence. Antoine and Joseph both died in 1432, but the duchess then gave birth to the future Charles the Bold on 21 November 1433. Thus, the couple had issue:
* Anthony (Antoine) of Burgundy (30 September 1430, Brussels – 5 February 1432, Brussels), Count of Charolais, died in infancy;
*Joseph (Josse) of Burgundy (24 April 1432 – in 1432, after 6 May), Count of Charolais, lived only a few weeks;
* Charles of Burgundy (21 November 1433 – 5 January 1477), Philip&#x27;s successor, known as &quot;Charles the Bold&quot;.

Isabella was a refined and intelligent woman who liked to be surrounded by artists and poets. She was a generous patron of the arts. In politics, she had a great influence on her son, but even more so on her husband, whom she represented on several diplomatic conferences and for whom she governed when he was absent. Most notably, she negotiated many of the marriages of the members of her court, among them the marriage of her son Charles to Catherine of France. She also took special pains on behalf of Mary of Guelders, who attended upon Catherine. Isabella helped arrange her marriage to James II of Scotland, which would make her queen.

==Later life==
By 1457, however, she had withdrawn from the court and distanced herself from her husband, partly to side with her son in his estrangement with him, partly out of a desire to live a more devout and quieter life. Her personal feelings came into conflict with the decisions of her husband, resulting in her abandoning court and taking up refuge in the castle of La Motte-au Bois, where she established a parallel court, which became a protectorate for the victims of her husband&#x27;s official politics. At that time she assisted the Flemish harmed by Philip&#x27;s military actions and, under her protection, advanced Josse van Huerter to her nephew, Ferdinand of Portugal.

Following the death of Henry VI of England, who had no surviving heirs, Isabella asserted her right to the English throne in a charter dated 17 June 1471, declaring herself to be Henry&#x27;s universal heiress on account of the consanguinity conferred by her grandfather (and Henry&#x27;s great-grandfather), John of Gaunt. She would later relinquish the claim to her son, Charles, one month before her death.

Isabella died in Aire-sur-la-Lys in December 1471. She was interred in the Champmol on 11 February 1474.

The dynasty rose to prominence when Count Christian I of Oldenburg was elected King of Denmark in 1448, of Norway in 1450 and of Sweden in 1457. After 576 years, the male line died out as the royal house of Denmark with the abdication of Queen Margrethe II in 2024. Several sources also name her son Frederik X as an Oldenburg however.

== History ==

Count Elimar I was first mentioned in 1091. The ancestral home of the family is Oldenburg Castle. In the 12th century, Rastede Monastery near Oldenburg became their house monastery and later their country seat to this day. Marriages of medieval counts of Oldenburg paved the way for their heirs to become kings of various Scandinavian kingdoms. Through marriage with a descendant of King Valdemar I of Sweden and of King Eric IV of Denmark, a claim to Sweden and Denmark was staked as early as 1350.

At that time, its competitors were the successors of Margaret I of Denmark. In the 15th century, the Oldenburg heir of that claim married Hedwig of Schauenburg, a descendant of a granddaughter of King Magnus III of Sweden (Euphemia of Sweden and Norway) and also a descendant of Eric V of Denmark and Abel of Denmark. Since descendants better situated in genealogical charts died out, their son Christian (the abovementioned) became the king of all three kingdoms of the whole Kalmar Union. The House of Mecklenburg was its chief competitor regarding the Northern thrones, and other aspirants included the Duke of Lauenburg. Different Oldenburgine branches have reigned in several countries. The House of Oldenburg was briefly poised to claim the British thrones through the marriage of Queen Anne and Prince George of Denmark and Norway in 1683; however, due to the early deaths of all their children, the crown passed to the House of Hanover, Oldenburgs not gaining that crown until 2022.

<text>Andrew Jay Hertzfeld (born April 6, 1953) is an American software engineer who was a member of Apple Computer&#x27;s original Macintosh development team during the 1980s. After buying an Apple II in January 1978, he went to work for Apple Computer from August 1979 until March 1984, where he was a designer for the Macintosh system software.

Since leaving Apple, Hertzfeld has co-founded three companies: Radius in 1986, General Magic in 1990, and Eazel in 1999. In 2002, he helped Mitch Kapor promote open source software with the Open Source Applications Foundation. 

Hertzfeld worked at Google from 2005 to 2013, where in 2011, he was the key designer of the Circles user interface in Google+.

==Career==
===Apple Computer (1979–1984)===
After graduating from Brown University with a computer science degree in 1975, Hertzfeld attended graduate school at the University of California, Berkeley. In 1978, he bought an Apple II computer and soon began developing software for it. He went on to write for &quot;Call-A.P.P.L.E.&quot; and &quot;Dr. Dobb&#x27;s Journal&quot; and soon came to the attention of Apple Computer.

He was hired by Apple Computer as a systems programmer in 1979 and developed the Apple Silentype printer firmware and wrote the firmware for the Sup&#x27;R&#x27;Terminal, the first 80-column card for the Apple II. In the early 1980s, he invited his high school friend, artist Susan Kare, to join Apple in order to help design what would become standard Macintosh icons.

With the first Macintosh, Hertzfeld wrote an icon editor and font editor so that Susan Kare could design the symbols used in the operating system.

Hertzfeld was a member of the design team for the Apple Macintosh, which was conceived by human–computer interface expert Jef Raskin. After a shakeup in the Apple II team and Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak&#x27;s brief departure from the company due to a plane crash, co-founder Steve Jobs took control of the nearly two-year-old Macintosh team in February 1981 and added Hertzfeld to it at his request. Working for Bud Tribble alongside Bill Atkinson and Burrell Smith, Hertzfeld became a primary software architect of the Macintosh Operating System, which was considered revolutionary in its use of the graphical user interface (GUI) where Raskin also made contributions.

Hertzfeld&#x27;s business card at Apple listed his title as &quot;Software Wizard&quot;. He wrote large portions of the Macintosh&#x27;s original system software, including much of the ROM code, the User Interface Toolbox, and a number of innovative components now standard in many graphic user interfaces, like the Control Panel and Scrapbook.

===After Apple (1984–present)===
After leaving Apple in 1984, Hertzfeld co-founded three new companies: Radius (1986), General Magic (1990), and Eazel (1999). At Eazel, he helped to create the Nautilus file manager for Linux&#x27;s GNOME desktop. He volunteered for the Open Source Applications Foundation in 2002 and 2003, writing early prototypes of Chandler, their information manager. In 1996, Hertzfeld was interviewed by Robert X. Cringely on the television documentary &quot;Triumph of the Nerds&quot;, and was again interviewed by Cringely on NerdTV in 2005.

In early 2004, he started folklore.org, a Web site devoted to collective storytelling that contains dozens of anecdotes about the development of the original Macintosh. The stories have been collected in an O&#x27;Reilly book, &quot;Revolution in the Valley&quot;, published in December 2004.

In August 2005, Hertzfeld joined Google. On June 28, 2011, Google announced Google+, its latest attempt at social networking. Hertzfeld was the key designer of the Google+ Circles interface. He also worked on Picasa, and Gmail&#x27;s profile image selector. He retired from Google in July 2013.

As of October 2018, he is an investor of the startup Spatial.

==In media==
Hertzfeld was portrayed by Elden Henson in the 2013 film &quot;Jobs&quot;. He was later played by actor Michael Stuhlbarg in the 2015 film &quot;Steve Jobs&quot;. Hertzfeld stated &quot;almost nothing in it is how it really happened&quot; about the &quot;Steve Jobs&quot; film, and that the film ultimately was not aiming for realism.

==Personal life==
Hertzfeld attended Harriton High School. He and his wife live in Palo Alto, California.

<doc id="453280" wikidata="Q2566155" url="?curid=453280" title="Inca rope bridge">
<text>Inca rope bridges are simple suspension bridges over canyons, gorges and rivers (&quot;pongos&quot;) constructed by the Inca Empire. The bridges were an integral part of the Inca road system and exemplify Inca innovation in engineering. Bridges of this type were useful since the Inca people did not use wheeled transport – traffic was limited to pedestrians and livestock – and they were frequently used by &quot;chasqui&quot; runners delivering messages throughout the Inca Empire.

==Construction and maintenance ==
The bridges were constructed using ichu grass woven into large bundles which were very strong.
Part of the bridge&#x27;s strength and reliability came from the fact that each cable was replaced every year by local villagers as part of their &quot;mit&#x27;a&quot; public service or obligation. In some instances, these local peasants had the sole task of repairing these bridges so that the Inca highways or road systems could continue to function. 
Repairing these bridges was dangerous, with those performing repairs often facing death.

In 1615, in Quechua author Huamán Poma&#x27;s manuscript &quot;The First New Chronicle,&quot; Poma illustrates the Guambo rope bridge in use. He describes the masonry bridges as a positive result of the Spanish colonization of Peru, as the new bridges prevented deaths from the dangerous repair work.

==Famous examples==
The greatest bridges of this kind were in the Apurímac Canyon along the main road north from Cusco; a famous example spans a 45-meter gap that is supposed to be the inspiration behind Thornton Wilder&#x27;s 1928 Pulitzer Prize winning novel &quot;The Bridge of San Luis Rey&quot; (1927).

Made of grass, the last remaining Inca rope bridge, reconstructed every June, is the Q&#x27;iswa Chaka (Quechua for &quot;rope bridge&quot;), spanning the Apurimac River near Huinchiri, in Canas Province, Quehue District, Peru. Even though there is a modern bridge nearby, the residents of the region keep the ancient tradition and skills alive by renewing the bridge annually in June. Several family groups have each prepared a number of grass-ropes to be formed into cables at the site; others prepare mats for decking, and the reconstruction is a communal effort. The builders have indicated that effort is performed to honor their ancestors and the Pachamama (Earth Mother).

<doc id="453286" wikidata="Q948975" url="?curid=453286" title="Inca road system">
<text>The Inca road system (also spelled Inka road system and known as &quot;Qhapaq Ñan&quot; meaning &quot;royal road&quot; in Quechua) was the most extensive and advanced transportation system in pre-Columbian South America. It was about long. The construction of the roads required a large expenditure of time and effort.

The network was composed of formal roads carefully planned, engineered, built, marked and maintained; paved where necessary, with stairways to gain elevation, bridges and accessory constructions such as retaining walls, and water drainage systems. It was based on two north–south roads: one along the coast and the second and most important inland and up the mountains, both with numerous branches.
It can be directly compared with the road network built during the Roman Empire, although the Inca road system was built one thousand years later. 
The road system allowed for the transfer of information, goods, soldiers and persons, without the use of wheels, within the Tawantinsuyu or Inca Empire throughout a territory covering almost and inhabited by about 12 million people.

The roads were bordered, at intervals, with buildings to allow the most effective usage: at short distance there were relay stations for &quot;chasquis&quot;, the running messengers; at a one-day walking interval &quot;tambos&quot; allowed support to the road users and flocks of llama pack animals. Administrative centers with warehouses, called qullqas, for re-distribution of goods were found along the roads. Towards the boundaries of the Inca Empire and in newly conquered areas pukaras (fortresses) were found.

Part of the road network was built by cultures that precede the Inca Empire, notably the Wari culture in the northern central Peru and the Tiwanaku culture in Bolivia. Different organizations such as UNESCO and IUCN have been working to protect the network in collaboration with the governments and communities of the six countries (Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Chile and Argentina) through which the Great Inca Road passes.

In modern times some remnant of the roads see heavy use from tourism, such as the Inca Trail to Machu Picchu, which is well known by trekkers. 

A 2021 study found that its effects have lingered for over 500 years, with wages, nutrition and school levels higher in communities living within 20 kilometers of the Inca Road, compared to similar communities farther away.

==Extent==
The Tawantinsuyu, which integrated the current territories of Peru, continued towards the north through present-day Ecuador, reaching the northernmost limits of the Andean mountain range in the region of Los Pastos in Colombia; by the South, it penetrated down to the Mendoza and Atacama lands, in the southernmost reaches of the Empire, corresponding currently with Argentine and Chilean territories. On the Chilean side, the road reached the Maipo river. The Inca Road system connected the northern territories with the capital city Cusco and the southern territories. 
About , out of the more than that the Andean mountains spans, were covered by it.

As indicated by Hyslop, &quot;The main route of the &quot;sierra&quot; (mountains) that passes through Quito, Tumebamba, Huánuco, Cusco, Chucuito, Paria and Chicona to the Mendoza River, has a length of 5,658 km.&quot; (3,516 miles)

The exact extent of the road network is not known: travelers and scholars proposed various lengths, spanning from to to .
Two main routes were defined: the eastern one, inland, runs high in the puna grassland, a large and undulating surface, which extends above ; the second one, the western route, that starts from the region of Tumbes in the current Peru–Ecuador border, follows the coastal plains, but does not include the coastal deserts, where it hugs the foothills. This western road outlines the current Pan-American Highway in its South American pacific extension.

Recent investigations carried out under the &quot;Proyecto Qhapaq Ñan&quot;, sponsored by the Peruvian government and basing also on previous research and surveys, suggest with a high degree of probability that another branch of the road system existed on the east side of the Andean ridge, connecting the administrative centre of Huánuco Pampa with the Amazonian provinces and having a length of about .

More than twenty transversal routes ran over the western mountains, while others traversed the eastern cordillera in the mountains and lowlands, connecting the two main routes and populated areas, administrative centres, agricultural and mining zones, as well as ceremonial centres and sacred spaces in different parts of the vast Inca territory. Some of these roads reach altitudes of over above sea level.

=== The four routes ===

During the Inca Empire, the roads officially stemmed from Cusco into the 4 cardinal directions towards the 4 &quot;suyus&quot; (provinces) into which the Tawantinsuyu was divided. Cusco was the center of Peru: the Inca-Spanish chronicler Inca Garcilaso de la Vega states that &quot;Cozco in the language of the Incas means navel that is the Earth&#x27;s navel&quot;. 
The four regions were named &quot;Chinchaysuyu&quot; towards the North, &quot;Collasuysu&quot; towards the South, &quot;Antisuyu&quot; towards the East and the lower valleys of the Amazon region and &quot;Contisuyu&quot; towards the West and the lower valleys along the Pacific coast.

The route towards the North was the most important in the Inca Empire, as shown by its constructive characteristics: a width ranging between 3 and 16 m and the size of the archaeological vestiges that mark the way both in its vicinity and in its area of influence. It is not coincidental that this path goes through and organizes the most important administrative centers of the Tawantinsuyu outside Cusco, such as Vilcashuamán, Xauxa, Tarmatambo, Pumpu, Huánuco Pampa, Cajamarca and Huancabamba, in current territories of Peru; and Ingapirca, Tomebamba or Riobamba in Ecuador. This was regarded by the Incas as &quot;the&quot; Qhapaq Ñan, main road or royal road, starting from Cusco and arriving in Quito. From Quito northwards, the Inca presence is perceived in defensive settlements that mark the advance of the Empire by the Ecuadorian provinces of Carchi and Imbabura and the current Nariño Department in Colombia, which in the 16th century was in process of being incorporated into the Inca Empire.

The route of Qollasuyu leaves Cusco and points towards the South, splitting into two branches to skirt Lake Titicaca (one on the east and one the west coast) that join again to cross the territory of the Bolivian Altiplano. From there the roads were unfolding to advance towards the southernmost boundaries of the Tawantinsuyu. One branch headed towards the current Mendoza region of Argentina, while the other penetrated the ancient territories of the Diaguita and Atacama people in Chilean lands, who had already developed basic road networks. From there, crossing the driest desert in the world, the Atacama Desert, the Qollasuyu route reached the Maipo river, currently in the Santiago metropolitan region. From there no vestiges of the Inca advance have been found.

Contisuyu roads allowed to connect Cusco to coastal territories, in what corresponds to the current regions of Arequipa, Moquegua and Tacna, in the extreme Peruvian south. These roads are transversal routes that guaranteed the complementarity of natural resources, since they cross very varied ecological floors, in the varied altitude of the descent from the heights of the cordillera to the coastal spaces.

The roads of the Antisuyu are the least known and a lesser number of vestiges were registered. They penetrated into the territories of the &quot;Ceja de Jungla&quot; or Amazonian Andes leading to the Amazon rainforest, where conditions are more difficult for the conservation of archaeological evidences. The true physical extension of the Inca Empire for this region is not very clear.

==Purposes of the road==

The Incas used the road system for a variety of reasons, from transportation for people who were traveling through the Empire to military and religious purposes. The road system allowed for a fast movement of persons from one part of the Empire to the other: both armies and workers used the roads to move and the tambos to rest and be fed. It also allowed for the fast movement of information and valuable small goods which traveled through the chasquis. The Incas gave priority to the straightness of the roads, whenever possible, to shorten the distances.

According to Hyslop the roads were the basis for the expansion of the Inca Empire: the most important settlements were located on the main roads, following a provision prefigured by the existence of older roads. The Incas had a predilection for the use of the Altiplano, or &quot;puna&quot; areas, for displacement, seeking to avoid contact with the populations settled in the valleys, and project, at the same time, a straight route of rapid communication. Other researchers pointed out additional factors that conditioned the location of Inca settlements and roads, such as the establishment of control zones in an intermediate location with respect to the populations and productive lands of the valleys, the requirement of specific goods, and storage needs, which were favored in the high plains of the Altiplano, characterized by low temperatures and dry climates. As an example, the administrative center of Huánuco Pampa includes 497 collcas, which totaled as much as and could support a population of between twelve and fifteen thousand people. Cotapachi (nowadays in the Bolivian region of Cochabamba) included a group of 2,400 collcas far away from any significant village.
Collcas were long-term storage houses, primarily for the storage of grains and maize, which had an extremely long expiration date and made them ideal for long-term storage for the army in the event of conflicts.

According to Hyslop the use of the Inca road system was reserved to authorities. He states: «soldiers, porters, and llama caravans were prime users, as were the nobility and other individuals on official duty… Other subjects were allowed to walk along the roads only with permission…»
Nevertheless, he recognizes that «there was also an undetermined amount of private traffic … about which little is known». Some local structures (called &quot;ranchillos&quot;) exist alongside the road which may allow to infer that also private trade traffic was present.

The use of the Inca roads, in the colonial period, after the Spanish conquest of Peru was mostly discontinued. The Conquistadors used the Inca roads to approach the capital city of Cusco, but they used horses and ox carts, which were not usable on such a road, and soon most of the roads were abandoned.
Only about 25 percent of this network is still visible today, the rest having been destroyed by wars (conquest, uprising, independence or between nations), the change in the economic model which involved abandoning large areas of territory, and finally the construction of modern infrastructure, during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, which led to the superposition of new communication channels in the outline of pre-Hispanic roads.

===Transportation===

Transportation was done on foot as in pre-Columbian America; the use of wheels for transportation was not known. The Inca had two main uses of transportation on the roads: the chasqui (runners) for relaying information (through the quipus) and lightweight valuables throughout the empire, and llamas caravans for transporting goods.

Llamas were used as pack animals in large flocks. They are lightweight animals and cannot carry much but are incredibly nimble. To transport large numbers of goods across the empire, it was more efficient for the Incas to use herds of llamas and to have two or three herdsmen. Herdsmen would drive the animals carrying their loads up the steep mountain roads, increasing carrying capacity without risking additional lives. Llamas have soft, padded hoofs, which give them good traction and a negligible impact on the road surface. Llamas of the Q&#x27;ara race (short-haired variety), which are used also in contemporary caravans, can carry about for a distance of per day, when necessary they can carry up to for short trips. They forage on natural vegetation.

===Trade===
Roads and bridges were essential to the political cohesion of the Inca state and to the redistribution of goods within it. All resources in the Empire were the property of the ruling elite. Commercial exchanges between manufacturers or producers and buyers were not practiced, as the management of all goods came under the control of the central authority. The redistribution of goods was known as the vertical archipelago: this system formed the basis for trade throughout the Inca Empire. As different sections of the Empire had different resources, the roads were used to distribute goods to other parts of the Empire that were in need of them. Roads reinforced the strength of the Inca Empire, as they allowed for the empire&#x27;s multitude of resources to be distributed through a set system to ensure all parts of the Empire were satisfied. 
Nevertheless, scholars have noted that there was a possible barter of goods along the roads between caravanners and villagers: a sort of &quot;secondary exchange&quot; and &quot;daily swapping&quot;.

===Military===
These roads provided easy, reliable and quick routes for the Empire&#x27;s administrative and military communications, personnel movement, and logistical support. After conquering a territory or convincing the local lord to become an ally, the Inca would employ a military-political strategy including the extension of the road system into the new dominated territories. 
The Qhapaq Ñan thus became a permanent symbol of the ideological presence of the Inca dominion in the newly conquered place. The road system facilitated the movement of imperial troops and preparations for new conquests as well as the quelling of uprisings and rebellions. However it was also allowed for sharing with the newly incorporated populations the surplus goods that the Inca produced and stored annually for the purpose of redistribution. The army moved frequently, mostly in support of military actions but also to support civil works.
The forts or pukaras were located mainly in the border areas, as a spatial indicator of the process of progressing and annexing new territories to the Empire. In fact, a greater number of pukaras are found towards the north of the Tawantinsuyu, as witnesses to the work of incorporating the northern territories, which were known to be rich in pastures. To the south there are abundant remains, around Mendoza in Argentina and along the Maipo river in Chile, where the presence of forts marks the line of the road at the southernmost point of the Empire.

===Religious ===

The high altitude shrines were directly related to the cult of Nature and specifically to the mountains, typical of the Inca society, which the Incas formalized by the construction of religious structures on the mountain peaks. Mountains are the &quot;apus&quot;, or deities, in the universe of Andean beliefs that are still held today; they have a spiritual connotation linked to the future of Nature and human existence. The Incas held many rituals, including the sacrifice of children, goods, and llamas, at the mountain tops as part of this belief. However, not all mountains held the same religious connotation nor were sanctuaries built on all of them. The only way to reach the summits of the mountains for worship was by connecting the road system to high altitude paths in order to reach the sacred places. They were ritual roads that culminated in the peaks, at the point of contact between the earthly and the sacred space. Some of them reached high altitudes above sea level, such as mount Chañi, which had a road that started at the base and went to the summit at an elevation of .

In addition to high altitude shrines, there were also many holy shrines or religious sites, called wak’a, that were a part of the Zeq’e system along and near the roads, especially around the capital city, Cusco. These shrines were either natural or modified features of the landscape, as well as buildings, where the Inca would visit for worship.

Some important places of worship were directly connected by the main Inca roads. Such is the case of the sanctuary of Pachacamac through which the coastal road passed, just south of present day Lima.

==History==
===Inca Empire era===
Much of the system was the result of the Incas claiming exclusive right over numerous traditional routes, some of which had been constructed centuries earlier, mostly by the Wari empire in the central highlands of Peru and the Tiwanaku culture. This latter had developed around Lake Titicaca, in the current territories of Peru and Bolivia, between the 6th and 12th centuries CE, and had set up a complex and advanced civilization. Many new sections of the road were built or upgraded substantially by the Incas: the one through Chile&#x27;s Atacama desert and the one along the western margin of Lake Titicaca serve as two examples.

The reign of the Incas originated during the Late Intermediate period (between 1000 CE and 1450 CE), when this group dominated only the region of Cusco. Inca Pachakutiq began the transformation and expansion of what decades later would become the Tawantinsuyu.
The historical stage of the Empire begun around 1438 when, having settled the disputes with local populations around Cusco, the Incas started the conquest of the coastal valleys from Nasca to Pachacamac and the other regions of Chinchaysuyu. Their strategy involved modifying or constructing a road structure that would ensure the connection of the incorporated territory with Cusco and with other administrative centers, allowing the displacement of troops and officials. The Incas&#x27; military advance was based mostly on diplomatic deals before the annexation of the new regions and the consolidation of the dominion, considering war as a last resort. The foundation of cities and administrative centers connected by the road system ensured state control of the new incorporated ethnic groups. Topa Inca Yupanqui succeeded to Pachakutiq, and conquered the Chimu reaching the far north region of Quito around 1463; later he extended the conquests to the jungle region of Charcas and, in the south, to Chile.

===Colonial era===
During the first years of the Colony, the Qhapaq Ñan suffered a stage of abandonment and destruction caused by the abrupt decrease of the number of natives due to illness and war which reduced the population from more than 12 million people to about 1.1 million in 50 years and destroyed the social structure that provided labor for road maintenance. The use of the Inca roads became partial and was adapted to the new political and economic targets of the Colony and later of the Viceroyalty where the economic structure was based on the extraction of minerals and commercial production. This implied a dramatic change in the use of the territory. The former integration of longitudinal and transversal territories was reduced to a connection of the Andean valleys and the Altiplano with the coast to allow for the export of products, especially gold and silver, which started flowing to the coast and from there to Spain.
A key factor in the dismantling of the network at the subcontinental level was the opening of new routes to connect the emerging production centers (estates and mines) with the coastal ports. In this context, only those routes that covered the new needs were used, abandoning the rest, particularly those that connected to the forts built during the advance of the Inca Empire or those that linked the agricultural spaces with the administrative centres. Nevertheless, the ritual roads that allowed access to the sanctuaries continued to be used under the religious syncretism that has been characterizing the Andean historical moments since the conquest.

Cieza de Leon in 1553 noted the abandonment of the road and stated that &quot;although in many places it is already broken down and undone, it shows the great thing that it was&quot;. 
The admiration of the chroniclers was not enough to convince the Spanish ruler of the need to maintain and consolidate the road system rather than abandoning and destroying it. The reduction of the local population to newly built settlements (known as &quot;reducciones&quot;, a sort of concentration camps) was among the causes of the abandonment of the Inca roads and the building of new ones to connect the &quot;reducciones&quot; to the centers of Spanish power. Another important factor was the inadequacy of the road for horses and mules introduced by the conquerors, that became the new pack animals, substituting for the lightweight llamas.

Even the new agriculture, derived from Spain, consisting mainly of cereals, changed the appearance of the territory, which was sometimes transformed, cutting and joining several andenes (farming terraces), which in turn reduced the fertile soil due to erosion form rain. The pre-Hispanic agricultural technologies were abandoned or displaced towards marginal spaces, relegated by the colonizers.

Part of the network continued to be used, as well as some of its equipment, such as the tambos, which were transformed into stores and shops, adjusting to the tradition of Spain, where peasant production was taken to them for selling. The tambos entered a new stage as meeting spaces for different ways of life that irremediably ended up integrating new social and territorial structures.

===Post-colonial and modern times===
After the independence from Spain the American republics, throughout the 19th century, did not provide significant changes to the territory. In the case of Peru, the territorial structure established by the Colony was maintained while the link between the production of the mountains and the coast was consolidated under a logic of extraction and export.

The construction of modern roads and railways was adapted to this logic. It gave priority to the communication with the coasts and was complemented by transversal axes of penetration into the inter-Andean valleys for the channeling of production towards the coastal axis and its seaports. At the end of the eighteenth century, large estates were developed for the supply of raw materials to international markets, together with guano, so the maritime ports of Peru took on special relevance and intense activity requiring an adequate accessibility from the production spaces. Some parts of the Inca roads were still in use in the south of the Altiplano giving access to the main centers for the production of alpaca and vicuña wools, which were in high demand in the international markets.

The twentieth century organization of roads along the Andes gave priority to the Pan-American highway along the coast, following roughly the traces of the coastal Inca road. This highway was then connected to west–east routes into the valleys while the north–south Inca road up the mountains was mostly reduced to local pedestrian transit.

In 2014 the road system became a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

==Architecture and engineering of the Inca roads==
The Incas built their road system by expanding and reinforcing several pre-existing smaller networks of roads, adapting and improving previous infrastructures, setting up a system of formal roads and providing a maintenance system that would protect the roads and facilitate the displacements and the exchange of people, goods and information. The outcome was a great road network of subcontinental dimensions, which, from Cusco, was directed in the four cardinal directions that marked the territorial division of Tawantinsuyu, which allowed the Inca and his officers to have knowledge of everything that circulated on the roads, however far away they were.

The Incas developed techniques to overcome the difficult territory of the Andes: on steep slopes they built stone steps, while in desert areas near the coast they built low walls to keep the sand from drifting over the road.

===Construction and maintenance===
The manpower required for both construction and maintenance was obtained through the mita: a sort of tax work, provided to the state by the conquered people, by which the Inca Empire produced the required goods and performed the necessary services, which included the upkeep of roads and their relevant infrastructures (bridges, tambos, warehouses, etc.).

The labor was organized by officials who were in charge of the development, control and operation of roads and bridges, as well as communications. The chronicler Felipe Guaman Poma de Ayala noted that these authorities were chosen among the noble relatives of the Inca, residents of Cusco. There were three main officials: the manager of the royal roads, the manager of bridges, the manager of chasquis. There were also several &quot;amojonadores&quot; or builders of landmarks.

===Architectural components ===
Hyslop noted that there was no road construction standard, because the roads were set in such varied environments and landscapes.

====Roadway and pavement====
In the mountains and the high forests, precisely arranged paving stones or cobbles were used for paving, placing them with their flat face towards the top, trying to produce a uniform surface. 
Nevertheless, not all the roads were paved; in the Andean puna and in the coastal deserts the road was usually made using packed earth, sand, or simply covering grassland with soil or sand. 
There is also evidence of paving with vegetable fibers such as in the road of Pampa Afuera in Casma (Áncash department, Peru).

The width of the roadway varied between , although some could be much wider, such as the road leading to Huánuco Pampa. 
The Cusco to Quito portion of the Road system, which was the most trafficked one, had a width always exceeding even in agricultural areas where the land had high value. Some portions reached a width of .
Near urban and administrative centers there is evidence of two or three roads constructed in parallel.
The maximum recorded width on the north coastal road is , while the average width in the south coastal road is .

====Side walls and stone rows====
Stones and walls served to mark the width of the road and signal it. On the coast and in the mountains, the availability of construction materials such as stone and mud for preparing adobes allowed to build walls on both sides of the road, to isolate it from agricultural land so that the walkers and caravans traveled without affecting the crops. In the flatlands and in the deserts, these walls most probably prevented sand from covering the road. In the absence of walls, the roads in the more deserted areas also used stone rows and wooden poles driven into the sand as route markers. Stone rows were built with stones of similar sizes and shapes, placed next to each other and located on one or both edges of the road, arranged in a sort of curb. In some cases it has been observed that the sides of these stones were edged.

====Furrows ====
Although it is not strictly a construction element used to delimit the edges of the road, there are cases in which furrows delimit the road on both sides. Examples of these furrows have been found in the coastal area located south of the Chala district in Arequipa.

====Retaining walls ====
Retaining walls were made with stones, adobes or mud and were built on the hillsides. These walls contained leveling fillings to form the platform of the road or to support the soil that could otherwise slide down the slope, as is generally seen in the transversal roads that lead to the coast from the mountains.

====Drainage====
Drainage by ditches or culverts was more frequent in the mountains and jungle due to the constant rainfall. Along other road sections, the drainage of rain water was carried out through an articulated system based on longitudinal channels and shorter drains, transverse to the axis of the road. Retaining walls were used along the mountain slopes, and are similar to those used to support the terraces. When crossing wetlands, roads were often supported by buttress walls or built on causeways.

====Road marks====
At given distances the direction of the road was marked with stone piles (&quot;mojones&quot; in Spanish) a sort of &quot;milestones&quot;, generally placed on both sides of the road. They were columns of well piled stones with a surmounting stone and often strategically placed on rises in order to be spotted from long distances.
The &quot;apachetas&quot; (South American cairns) were mounds of stones of different sizes, formed through gradual accumulation by the travelers, who deposited stones as an offering to preserve their travel from setbacks and allow for its successful conclusion. The apachetas were located on the side of the roads in transitional spaces such as passes or &quot;points of interest&quot; for travellers. This practice was condemned for its pagan character during the Colony and the Viceroyalty, when priests were ordered to dismantle them and plant crosses instead. Nevertheless, the tradition of making apachetas was not discontinued and crosses or altars of different sizes were accompanied by mounds of stone.

====Paintings and mock-ups====
Some places such as rock shelters or cliffs show rock paintings next to the roads, which can be interpreted as a reinforcement of the signalization. The generally zoomorphic painted representations correspond to stylized camelids, in the typical Inca design and color. Figures directly carved on the stone are also found.

Rocks of varying sizes at the roadside can represent the shapes of the mountains or important glaciers of the region, as an expression of the sacralization of geography; they can be made up of one or more rocks.

===Causeways===
In damp areas embankments were built to produce causeways, in rocky terrain it was necessary to dig the path in the rock or to drive it through an artificial terrace with retaining walls
Some important causeways such as on the coast of Lake Titicaca were built to take into account the periodic variation of the lake level due to alternating rainy and dry seasons. They had stone bridges to allow the free flow of water below them.

===Stairways===
In order to overcome the limitations imposed by the roughness of the relief and the adverse environmental conditions, the Inca engineers designed different solutions. On rocky outcrops the road became narrower, adapting to the orography with frequent turns and retaining walls, but on particularly steep slopes flights of stairs or ramps were built or carved in the rock.

===Bridges===

There were multiple types of bridges used throughout the road system and they were sometimes built in pairs. Some bridges were made of parallel logs tied together with ropes and covered with earth and vegetal fibers supported by stone abutments, while others were built of stone slabs resting on piled stones. One of the difficulties of creating wooden bridges was obtaining logs. Sometimes, the laborers who were making the bridges had to bring the lumber from very far away. Wooden bridges would be replaced about every eight years.

The construction of bridges was accomplished by the help of many workers. It implied first of all the constructions of abutments, normally made of stone both rough and dressed. The masonry could even be extremely well fitted, with no evidence of any mortar being used to keep the stones in place. Incas, having no iron, used a method of stone working which used simple tools, such as hammerstones, to pound the rocks in a way that the contours of the upper rock matched those of the rock below so that the seams fit perfectly without mortar.
For simple log bridges, the construction was done by placing a series of logs over projecting canes. 
Stone bridges could span shorter lengths and needed shallower rivers to be built . Some slabs were placed over the abutments and intermediate stone pillars when necessary. A very special stone bridge was recently discovered in Bolivia consisting of a relatively small opening to allow the stream to flow and a quite imposing stone embankment filling the valley sides in order to allow the road to pass on top of it.

To cross rivers flat banks, floating reeds tied together were used, forming of a row of &quot;totora&quot; boats placed side to side and covered with a board of totora and earth.

Inca rope bridges also provided access across narrow valleys. A bridge across the Apurímac River, west of Cusco, spanned a distance of . Rope bridges had to be replaced about every two years: to this end, the communities around the river crossing were commanded into a &quot;mita&quot; for the construction of the new bridge, while the old bridge was cut and let fall into the river. This type of bridge was built with ropes of vegetable fibers, such as &quot;ichu&quot; (Stipa ichu) a fiber typical of the Altiplano, which were tied together to form cords and ropes which constituted the bridge floor cables, the two handrails and the necessary connections between them.

Ravines were sometimes crossed by large hanging baskets, or &quot;oroyas&quot;, which could span distances of over .
===Tunnel===
To access the famous Apurímac rope bridge it was necessary for the road to reach the narrowest section of the gorge: to this end, the road was cut along a natural fault into the steep rock of the valley and a tunnel was carved to facilitate the way. The tunnel had a series of side openings allowing the light to come in. There is no evidence of other tunnels along the Inca roads.

===Equipment===
Garcilaso de la Vega underlines the presence of infrastructure on the Inca road system where all across the Empire lodging posts for state officials and chasqui messengers were ubiquitous, well-spaced and well provisioned. Food, clothes, and weapons were also stored and kept ready for the Inca army marching through the territory.

The tambos were the most numerous and perhaps more important buildings in the operation of the road network. They were constructions of varied architecture and size whose function was mainly the lodging of the travellers and the storage of products for their supply. For this reason, they were located at a day&#x27;s journey interval, although irregularities were identified in their distances, probably linked to various factors such as the presence of water sources, the existence of land with agricultural produce or the presence of pre-Inca centers. The tambos were most probably administered by the local populations since many of them are associated with settlements with additional constructions for different uses, such as &quot;canchas&quot; (rectangular enclosures bordered by a wall, probably used as accommodation for walkers), and collcas and &quot;kallancas&quot;. These latter were rectangular buildings of considerable size, which the Conquistadors called barns for their length. They were used for ceremonies and for accommodation of diverse nature: members of the Inca or local elites, mitimaes or other travelers. Tambos were so frequent that many Andean regional place names include the word tambo in them.

At the roadside the &quot;chasquiwasis&quot;, or relay stations for the Inca messenger chasqui, were frequent. In these places the chasquis waited for the messages they had to take to other locations. The fast flow of information was important for an Empire that was in constant expansion. The &quot;chasquiwasis&quot; were normally quite small and there is little archaeological evidence and research on them.

==Inca Trail to Machu Picchu==
 Machu Picchu itself was far off the beaten path, and served as a royal estate populated by the ruling Inca and several hundred servants. It required regular infusions of goods and services from Cusco and other parts of the Empire. This is evidenced by the fact that there are no large government storage facilities at the site. A 1997 study concluded that the site&#x27;s agricultural potential would not have been sufficient to support residents, even on a seasonal basis.

<text>HMS &quot;Fiji&quot; was the lead ship of her class of 11 light cruisers built for the Royal Navy shortly before the Second World War. Completed in mid-1940, she was initially assigned to the Home Fleet and was detached to escort a force tasked to force French West Africa to join the Free French. The ship was torpedoed en route and required six months to be repaired. &quot;Fiji&quot; was then assigned to Force H where she helped to escort convoys to Malta. The ship was transferred to the Mediterranean Fleet in early May 1941. After the Germans invaded Crete a few weeks later, she was sunk by German aircraft on 22 May after having fired off all of her anti-aircraft ammunition.

==Description==
&quot;Fiji&quot; displaced at standard load and at deep load. They had an overall length of , a beam of and a draught of . The ships were powered by four Parsons geared steam turbines, each driving one shaft, using steam provided by four Admiralty 3-drum boilers. The turbines developed a total of and gave a maximum speed of . &quot;Fiji&quot; had a metacentric height of at deep load. The &quot;Fiji&quot; class carried enough fuel oil to give them a range of at . The ships&#x27; complement was 733 officers and ratings in peacetime and 900 during war.
The armament of the &quot;Fiji&quot;-class ships consisted of a dozen BL 6-inch (152 mm) Mk XXIII guns in four three-gun turrets, one superfiring pair fore and aft of the superstructure. Their secondary armament consisted of eight 4-inch (102 mm) Mk XVI dual-purpose guns in four twin turrets. Anti-aircraft defence for &quot;Fiji&quot; was provided by two quadruple 2-pounder () (&quot;pom-poms&quot;) AA guns and two quadruple mounts for Vickers AA machineguns. The cruisers also carried two above-water triple torpedo tube mounts for  torpedoes, one mount on each broadside.

The &quot;Fiji&quot; class lacked a full waterline armour belt. The sides of their boiler and engine rooms and the magazines were protected by of armour. The deck over the propulsion machinery spaces and magazines was reinforced to a thickness of and the main-gun turrets had only splinter protection thick. They carried an aircraft catapult and two Supermarine Sea Otter or Walrus seaplanes.

==Construction and career==
&quot;Fiji&quot;, the only ship of the Royal Navy to be named after the Crown colony of Fiji, was laid down by John Brown &amp; Company at their Clydebank shipyard on 30 March 1938. The ship was launched on 31 May 1939 and completed on 5 May 1940. She was the first of the &quot;Fiji&quot; class to enter service (Royal Navy classes were generally named after the lead ship of a class). She was initially assigned to the Home Fleet. On 31 August 1940 she sailed for the African Atlantic coast to take part in Operation Menace, the attack on Dakar, but before she could join the taskforce, &quot;Fiji&quot; was damaged by a torpedo from the on 1 September and had to return to Britain for repairs, which lasted for the next six months. The torpedo hit abreast the forward boiler room and most of the force of the detonation escaped up the forward funnel, but the boiler room and an adjacent compartment flooded, reducing her speed to . The flooding gave her a list to port; to counter it the ammunition from the forward turrets was thrown overboard and the portside torpedoes were ejected over the side. While under repair she was fitted with a Type 284 gunnery radar and another pair of quadruple Vickers 0.50-inch AA machineguns were added.

She returned to service in March 1941 and was assigned to patrol the Denmark Strait for German commerce raiders. She missed the homeward-bound heavy cruiser on 26–27 March, and in early April she was reassigned to Force H at Gibraltar to blockade the German heavy ships then stationed at Brest. With Force H, she sailed into the Mediterranean to support operations to relieve the island of Malta in late April. On 5 May Force H departed Gibraltar to escort a heavily-laden convoy bound for Egypt (Operation Tiger); Force H only escorted the convoy halfway through the Mediterranean before the Mediterranean Fleet took over. &quot;Fiji&quot; joined the fleet at that time.

===Battle of Crete===
British intelligence anticipated that the Germans would attack the island of Crete on 17 May and Admiral Andrew Cunningham, commander of the Mediterranean Fleet, ordered his ships to sea on the 15th. Force B, &quot;Fiji&quot; and the light cruiser were tasked to patrol west of the island. The Germans began landing paratroopers on 20 May when Force B was en route to rendezvous with the battleships and and their escorts west of Crete. The ships rendezvoused the following morning and German air attacks began a few hours later, although with little effect other than to help exhaust the ships&#x27; anti-aircraft ammunition. That afternoon, Cunningham ordered the cruisers to disperse into their original groups and search for any troop convoys in the Aegean. The Germans spotted Force B shortly after dawn on 22 May as the cruisers were steaming south to rendezvous with the battleships again. &quot;Fiji&quot; was not hit during these attacks, but was damaged by near misses that knocked out her aft anti-aircraft director.

Force B made the rendezvous with Force A1 (Rear Admiral H B Rawlings) and Force D (Rear Admiral Irvine Glennie) at about 08:30 and the combined force was ordered to report on their levels of high-angle anti-aircraft ammunition. Of the cruisers, had 40%, 38%, &quot;Fiji&quot; 30%, 25% and &quot;Gloucester&quot; only 18%. &quot;Ajax&quot;, &quot;Orion&quot; and &quot;Dido&quot; were ordered to return to Alexandria with Glennie&#x27;s Force D to rearm but &quot;Gloucester&quot; and &quot;Fiji&quot; remained with Rawlings&#x27; Force A1.

At 12:25 Force A1, stationed 20 to 30 miles west of Antikythera, received a request from Rear Admiral Edward Leigh Stuart King to support the damaged and the rest of his Force C. Force A1 headed east into the Kythera Channel, rendezvousing with Force C between 13:30 and 14:00. As the more senior admiral, King took command, with air attacks now inflicting damage on both forces. At 14:02 and 14:07 respectively, &quot;Fiji&quot; and &quot;Gloucester&quot; were detached to provide anti-aircraft support for the destroyers and . The two destroyers having already been ordered to rescue the survivors of the destroyer , which had been sunk at 13:50. Writing in despatches after the battle, Cunningham stated that King was unaware of the shortage of anti-aircraft ammunition in &quot;Fiji&quot; and &quot;Gloucester&quot;. At 14:13 King and Rawlings exchanged messages about the shortage of ammunition within both Force C and Force A1, with Rawlings expressing concern about the orders given to &quot;Gloucester&quot; and &quot;Fiji&quot;. Following this communication, King issued an order to recall both &quot;Gloucester&quot; and &quot;Fiji&quot; at 14:57.

The &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; focused its attention on the four ships dispatched to &quot;Greyhound&quot; and they were under near-constant attack for several hours. By 15:30, while attempting to rejoin Force A1, &quot;Fiji&quot; had exhausted her supply of anti-aircraft ammunition and was reduced to firing practice rounds. She closed on &quot;Gloucester&quot; at 15:50, right when that ship was struck by four bombs and was near-missed by three others. &quot;Fiji&quot; dropped life rafts, but was forced to depart the area with the two destroyers. These ships fought on and shot down one attacker and severely damaged two others. The aerial attacks continued despite the heavy cloud cover; at 19:00 a Messerschmitt Bf 109 fighter bomber struck the cruiser amidships with a bomb. The forward boiler and engine rooms flooded and gave her a severe list. Despite this damage &quot;Fiji&quot; was able to maintain a speed of until another Bf 109 hit her with another bomb that increased her list to 30 degrees. Abandon ship was ordered in the face of the uncontrollable flooding and she capsized around 19:30. Her accompanying destroyers were unable to rescue any of the crew until after dark when almost all of them were recovered. Kit Tanner, the ship&#x27;s chaplain, was posthumously awarded the Albert Medal (since replaced by the George Cross) for repeatedly entering the sea to rescue men from the water.

On 30 May 1941, in a letter to the First Sea Lord, Sir Dudley Pound, Cunningham wrote, &quot;The sending back of &quot;Gloucester&quot; and &quot;Fiji&quot; to &quot;Greyhound&quot; was another grave error and cost us those two ships. They were practically out of ammunition, but even had they been full up I think they would have gone. The Commanding Officer of &quot;Fiji&quot; told me that the air over &quot;Gloucester&quot; was black with planes.&quot;

Following the loss of both &quot;Fiji&quot; and &quot;Gloucester&quot; to air attacks after their anti-aircraft ammunition was exhausted, all British cruisers were instructed to not allow their anti-aircraft ammunition reserves to fall below 40%.

<text>Whittlesey (also Whittlesea) is a market town and civil parish in the Fenland district of Cambridgeshire, England. Whittlesey is east of Peterborough. The population of the parish was 17,667 at the 2021 Census.

==Toponymy==
Whittlesey appears in the &quot;Cartularium Saxonicum&quot; (973 CE) as &#x27;Witlesig&#x27;, in the 1086 &quot;Domesday Book&quot; as &#x27;Witesie&#x27;, and in the &quot;Inquisitio Eliensis&quot;. The meaning is &quot;Wit(t)el&#x27;s island&quot;, deriving from either Witil, &quot;the name of a moneyer&quot;, or a diminutive of Witta, a personal name; + &quot;eg&quot;, meaning &quot;&#x27;island&#x27;, also used of a piece of firm land in a fen.&quot;

The official name of the civil parish is &#x27;Whittlesey&#x27;, which spelling is also used by the Royal Mail and Ordnance Survey. The town&#x27;s railway station uses the alternative spelling of &#x27;Whittlesea&#x27;.

==History==

Before the fens were drained, Whittlesey was an island of dry ground surrounded by them. Excavations of nearby Flag Fen indicate thriving local settlements as far back as 1000 BCE. At Must Farm quarry, a Bronze Age settlement is described as &quot;Britain&#x27;s Pompeii&quot; due to its relatively good condition. In 2016 it was being excavated by the University of Cambridge&#x27;s Cambridge Archaeological Unit. At Must Farm at least five homes of 3,000 years in age have been found, along with Britain&#x27;s most complete prehistoric wooden wheel, dating back to the late Bronze Age.

Whittlesey was linked to Peterborough in the west and March in the east by the Roman Fen Causeway, probably built in the 1st century CE. Roman artefacts have been recovered at nearby Eldernell, and a Roman skeleton was discovered in the nearby village of Eastrea during construction of its village hall in 2010.

The town&#x27;s two parishes of St Mary&#x27;s and St Andrew&#x27;s belonged to the abbeys in Thorney and Ely respectively until the Dissolution of the Monasteries about 1540. Despite the proximity of Peterborough, Whittlesey is in the Diocese of Ely.

Nearby Whittlesey Mere was a substantial lake surrounded by marsh until it was drained in 1851. According to the traveller Celia Fiennes, who saw it in 1697, the mere was &quot;3-mile broad and six-mile long. In the midst is a little island where a great store of Wildfowle breed... The ground is all wett and marshy but there are severall little Channells runs into it which by boats people go up to this place; when you enter the mouth of the Mer it looks formidable and its often very dangerous by reason of sudden winds that will rise like Hurricanes...&quot; The town is still accessible by water, being connected to the River Nene by King&#x27;s Dyke, which forms part of the Nene/Ouse Navigation. Moorings can be found at Ashline Lock, alongside the Manor Leisure Centre&#x27;s cricket and football pitches.

Whittlesey was significant for its brickyards, around which the former hamlet of King&#x27;s Dyke was based for much of the 20th century, although only one now remains, following the closure of the Saxon brickworks in 2011.

The local clay soil was also used to make cob boundary walls during a period in which there was a brick tax. Some examples of these roofed walls still stand today and are claimed to be unique in Fenland. Clay walls predate the introduction of brick tax in other parts of the country, and some were thatched.

Whittlesey had a large number of public houses. In 1797, a local farmer noted in his diary, &quot;They like drinking better than fighting in Whittlesea.&quot; Among the public houses that have closed are the Plough, the Letter A, the Letter C, the Queen Adelaide, the Old Crown, the King&#x27;s Head, the Morton Folk and the White Horse, many of which are now private residences. 

Whittlesey was an important trade route in the late Bronze Age (about 1100–800 BCE). Evidence for this was found at the archaeological site of Must Farm, where log boats, roundhouses, bowls with food in them, and the most complete wooden wheel were housed.

In 1832, Whittlesey, then spelt Whittlesea, was ravaged by the second cholera epidemic, along with nearby Peterborough. According to a diary entry of Mrs Thomas Shaftoe Robertson, manageress of the Lincoln Theatre Circuit, &quot;What a gap in my journal! April to November! But better not record such a summer as I have passed. God deliver me from such another. What suffering, what anguish, and loss! Whittlesea! Shall I ever have the idea of entering that place again? The cholera there raged in all its fury. I was numbered amongst its victims, and, false or true, was certainly dreadfully ill. All Peterborough was in a languishing state. Mr Walker, the surgeon, behaved most kindly, and never charged me a shilling.&quot;
A year later this entry was amended: &quot;Let me correct this error. The year after he sent me in a bill of £5 14s 6d.&quot; The Lincoln Theatre Circuit also included at various times Whittlesey, Wisbech, Boston and other nearby towns.

===Churches===
St Mary&#x27;s Church contains 15th-century work, but most of the building is later. It has one of the largest buttressed spires in Cambridgeshire. The spire is 171 feet (52 metres) high. The church also contains a chapel, which was restored in 1862 as a memorial to Sir Harry Smith. St Mary&#x27;s is a Grade I listed building.

St Andrew&#x27;s Church originally dates back to the 13th and 14 centuries, with a major restoration taking place in 1872. The church, featuring a three-storeyed west tower with an eastern clock face, blends the Perpendicular and Decorated Gothic architectural styles of the 13th to 15th centuries. St Andrew&#x27;s is listed Grade II*.

Both churches still see active use, each with a separate congregation.

===The Market Place===
The market is held in the Market Place every Friday. The right to hold a weekly market was first granted in 1715, although there have been several periods since in which the market did not function, for example from the late 1700s until about 1850.

In the centre of the Market Place is the Buttercross, dating back to 1680. Originally a place for people to sell goods, the structure was considered useless in the 1800s and only saved from demolition when a local businessman donated some slate tiles for the roof. Latterly it served as a bus shelter, until the bus services were relocated from the Market Place to a purpose-built terminal in Grosvenor Road.

==Governance==
There are three tiers of local government covering Whittlesey, at civil parish (town), district, and county level: Whittlesey Town Council, Fenland District Council, and Cambridgeshire County Council. The district and county councils are also members of the Cambridgeshire and Peterborough Combined Authority, led by the directly elected Mayor of Cambridgeshire and Peterborough. The town council is based at Peel House, 8 Queen Street. The civil parish of Whittlesey includes the town itself and the villages of Coates, Eastrea, Pondersbridge and Turves.

Whittlesey forms part of the parliamentary constituency of North East Cambridgeshire.

===Administrative history===
There were two ancient parishes covering Whittlesey: Whittlesey St Andrew and Whittlesey St Mary, both of which formed part of the North Witchford hundred of Cambridgeshire. The North Witchford hundred formed part of the Isle of Ely, which was historically a liberty under the secular jurisdiction of the Bishop of Ely. Both parishes churches were in the town, and each parish also included extensive tracts of surrounding countryside. The boundaries between the two parishes were heavily intermingled and sometimes disputed. When parishes were given civil responsibilities under the poor laws from the 17th century onwards, the two parishes agreed to work together as a joint parish for the purposes of administering the poor laws. Under the Whittlesey Improvement Act 1849, the two parishes were formally united into a single civil parish, giving official recognition to the long-standing informal union under the poor laws. The boundaries of the two ecclesiastical parishes were rationalised at the same time.
The 1849 Act also established a body of improvement commissioners to provide public services and infrastructure to the area around the town itself. The commissioners&#x27; district was converted into an urban district under the Local Government Act 1894. The 1894 Act also directed that parishes could not straddle district boundaries, and so the parish was split into a Whittlesey Urban parish covering the urban district and a Whittlesey Rural parish covering the remainder. The urban and rural parishes were reunited in 1926 as a single parish of Whittlesey when the urban district was enlarged to cover the whole area. The urban district council met at Whittlesey Town Hall on Market Street, which also served as a magistrates&#x27; court and fire engine house. Between 1889 and 1965, the Isle of Ely was an administrative county with its own county council, whilst also forming part of the wider geographical county of Cambridgeshire. Between 1965 and 1974, the administrative county covering Whittlesey was called Cambridgeshire and Isle of Ely.

Whittlesey Urban District was abolished in 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972. District-level functions passed to the new Fenland District Council. No successor parish was created for the area of the abolished urban district at the time of the 1974 reforms and so it became unparished. The area of the former urban district was made a new parish called Whittlesey in 1981, with its parish council taking the name Whittlesey Town Council.

==Geography==
Whittlesey is between Peterborough, to the west, and March, to the east. It is bordered to the north by the River Nene and to the south by Whittlesey Dyke. Historically, it was connected with Peterborough and March by the Roman Fen Causeway of the first century CE, a route roughly followed by the modern A605.

To the north of Whittlesey is a recorded Ramsar site, a protected wetland. There is also Morton&#x27;s Leam, which is an SSSI of notable diversity. To the south-east is Lattersey Nature Reserve.

==Transport==

Whittlesea railway station, using the town&#x27;s alternative spelling, is on the Ely to Peterborough Line; it is served by direct trains to Cambridge, Birmingham New Street, Liverpool Lime Street, Leicester, Stansted Airport, Ely, Ipswich and Peterborough. Services are operated by CrossCountry and East Midlands Railway.

Bus services in the area are operated by Stagecoach East. Routes link the town with Peterborough, Chatteris, March, Ramsey and Yaxley.

Whittlesey town centre hosts the annual Fenland BusFest event. It is one of the area&#x27;s most popular vintage vehicle gatherings.

==Culture and community==
Whittlesey Summer Festival fills much of the centre each September. Attractions have included a classic car display, an Italian food stall, fairground rides, a steam engine, and in 2009, a flying display by a Hawker Hurricane of the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight. An art competition for students of Sir Harry Smith Community College runs during the festival, with a display at Whittlesey Christian Church. At the 2009 festival local people raised £10,000 for bushfire victims in Whittlesea, Victoria, Australia.

From 2011 to 2015, there was rivalry between the supermarket chains Tesco and Sainsbury&#x27;s to build on neighbouring sites in Eastrea Road. Dubbed &quot;Supermarket Gate&quot; in the press, the dispute was resolved when Sainsbury&#x27;s won approval in June 2015 for its scheme for a supermarket, business park and country park. Plans for over 400 houses on an adjacent site, construction of which began in late 2014, caused concern about extra traffic on the A605. The Sainsbury&#x27;s store never went ahead, however, and instead, a new Aldi store was opened on Eastrea Road in June 2023.

Close to the King&#x27;s Dyke brickworks stand three 80-metre wind turbines, the largest on-shore turbines in England. They power the McCains chips plant.

Whittlesey Museum, located in the Old Town Hall, records the natural and cultural heritage of the town and surrounding area.

===Whittlesea Straw Bear===
The festival of the Straw Bear or &quot;Strawbower&quot; is a custom known only to a small area of Fenland on the borders of Huntingdonshire and Isle of Ely, Cambridgeshire, including Ramsey Mereside. Similar ritual animals appear elsewhere in Europe, including parts of Germany at Shrovetide.

On Plough Tuesday, the day after the first Monday after Twelfth Night, a man or a boy is covered from head to foot in straw and led from house to house, where he danced in exchange for gifts of money, food or beer. The festival was of a stature that farmers would often reserve their best straw for making the bear.

The custom died out about 1909, probably because the police saw it as begging, but it was revived by the Whittlesea Society in 1980. It has now expanded to cover a whole weekend, when the Bear appears not on Plough Tuesday but on the second weekend in January. On the Saturday of the festival, the Bear progresses round the streets with its attendant &quot;keeper&quot; and musicians, followed by traditional dance sides (mostly visitors), including morris men and women, molly dancers, rappers and longsword dancers, clog dancers, who perform at points along the route.

The Bear dances to a tune (reminiscent of the hymn &quot;Jesus Bids us Shine&quot;) which featured on &quot;Rattlebone and Ploughjack&quot;, a 1976 LP by Ashley Hutchings, along with a description of the original custom that had partly inspired the Whittlesey revival. &quot;Sessions&quot; of traditional music take place in pubs during the day and evening, and a barn dance or ceilidh and a Cajun dance end the Saturday night. The bear &quot;costume&quot; is burned at a ceremony at Sunday lunchtime. Shrovetide bear costumes are also burned ceremonially after use in Germany.)

The Whittlesea Straw Bear and Keeper appear in the album art of The Young Knives&#x27; album, &quot;Voices of Animals and Men&quot;.

<text>HMS &quot;Gibraltar&quot;, was an cruiser launched in 1892 for service in the Royal Navy. She was built and engineered by Messrs Napier of Glasgow. Of 7,700 loaded displacement, she was coal-fired with four double-ended cylindrical boilers driving two shafts. She could make with forced draught and with natural draught. She was a very good sea boat and an exceptional steamer.

==Service history==

During her early career &quot;Gibraltar&quot; served mainly on foreign stations. In late 1899 she had a complete refit at Portsmouth dockyard. In March 1901 she was commissioned by Captain Arthur Limpus, with a complement of 544 officers and men, to take the place as flagship of Rear-Admiral Arthur Moore, who had been appointed Commander-in-Chief on the Cape Station. She arrived in Durban in early September 1901.

In July 1902 she was head of a group of seven Royal Navy ships visiting Zanzibar for a show of force following the death of the sultan and accession of his son, Ali bin Hamud. The following month she visited Kenya, and Beira, Mozambique, before she was back in South Africa in September. Three months later she visited Saint Helena and Ascension Island in December 1902, and the following month she was in Bathurst and Sierra Leone.

Despite her obsolescence, she saw service in the First World War, first with the 10th Cruiser Squadron on Northern Patrol and from 1915 as a depot ship for this group, based in the Shetland Islands. Two of her QF 6-in Mk I guns were dismounted from the cruiser and moved to Swarbacks Head on Vementry, a headland that overlooks the entrance to Swarbacks Minn between the islands of Vementry and Muckle Roe for shore based defence. The two guns still exist on this site and can be visited.

Future First Sea Lord John H. D. Cunningham served aboard her as a midshipman. Captain Ronald Arthur Hopwood was in command 1913–1914, leaving at the start of the First World War.

&quot;Gibraltar&quot; was sold in August 1923 to John Cashmore Ltd for breaking up at Newport.

<doc id="453298" wikidata="Q2446375" url="?curid=453298" title="Dan Hibiki">
<text>is a character from Capcom&#x27;s &quot;Street Fighter&quot; fighting game franchise. He was created to parody Ryo Sakazaki and Robert Garcia, the two lead characters of SNK&#x27;s &quot;Art of Fighting&quot; series, as Capcom saw Ryo as a ripoff of &quot;Street Fighter&quot; characters Ryu and Ken. Since then, Dan has become a fan favorite due to his humorous design, signature moves and mannerisms.

Introduced in &quot;Street Fighter Alpha&quot; (1995), Dan is consistently portrayed as an overconfident, arrogant and utterly feeble character. In the series&#x27; storyline, Dan was a student trained by Gouken—elder brother of Akuma—who also trained Ken and Ryu. Gouken stopped training Dan once he acknowledged the ulterior reasons Dan has in his mind. Dan&#x27;s goal is to defeat Sagat, who killed Go, Dan&#x27;s father, in a brutal fight that resulted in the loss of Sagat&#x27;s right eye. After Sagat pretended that he was defeated, Dan opened an unsuccessful school for his fighting style, &quot;Saikyo-ryu&quot; (&quot;Strongest style&quot;).

==Appearances==
Dan is introduced in &quot;Street Fighter Alpha&quot; and &quot;Street Fighter Alpha 2&quot; as a martial artist who developed his own fighting style called &quot;Saikyō-ryū&quot;, &quot;The Strongest Style&quot;, despite the considerable lack of power in his techniques. During these two games, Dan seeks to defeat Sagat to avenge his father&#x27;s death. While Dan is an unlockable character in &quot;Street Fighter Alpha&quot;, in following games he is already available. By &quot;Street Fighter Alpha 3&quot;, Dan has succeeded in his quest (as Sagat, having realized through Dan how far gone a person can be for revenge, purposefully threw the fight) and seeks to perfect and promote his fighting style. In this game, he also declares himself the mentor of the fighter Sakura Kasugano and is revealed to be one of Blanka&#x27;s friends.

Dan also appears in the console versions of &quot;Street Fighter IV&quot;, entering the tournament in an effort to make his Saikyo-style more popular. He also appears as Sakura&#x27;s mentor and fights her as a rival in the penultimate fight of his Arcade mode. In &quot;Super Street Fighter IV&quot;, he continues fighting to promote and gain membership into his Saikyo Dojo which has no members at all. However, his plan fails due to lack of publicity used for his dojo. Dan is used as the &quot;dummy&quot; opponent for the Challenge Mode in the home versions.

Prior to being released as a playable character for the fifth season of downloadable content in &quot;Street Fighter V&quot;, he provides descriptions of items that players can purchase from the in-game store, occasionally breaking the fourth wall. In the game&#x27;s story, Dan may have won in a certain world martial arts tournament legally off-screen, but is still dissatisfied about still lacking of students in his dojo. However, thanks to Sakura and Blanka&#x27;s tips, Dan is inspired by the success of the latter&#x27;s &quot;Blanka-chan&quot; dolls and attempts to become popular by creating his own variation called &quot;Saikyo-boy&quot; dolls.

His stance as a &quot;weak&quot; character is emphasized in the puzzle game &quot;Super Puzzle Fighter II Turbo&quot;, in which Dan is a hidden character who drops only red counter gems, making him extremely easy to beat. In &quot;Super Gem Fighter Mini Mix&quot;, Dan&#x27;s story begins with himself looking to expand his Saikyo-ryu school and subsequently chooses Sakura as his student. Upon meeting Sakura, he offers to teach her his style and she accepts after Dan defeats her in a fight. Sakura masters the entire Saikyo-ryu style and chooses to forget the entire style three days after mastering it, humiliating Dan.

Dan appears as a playable character in some Capcom crossover projects, including two crossovers with Marvel: &quot;Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter&quot; and &quot;Marvel vs. Capcom 2&quot; as well as the crossovers with SNK starting with &quot;Capcom vs. SNK Pro&quot;. During the debut trailer for the crossover fighting game &quot;Street Fighter X Tekken&quot;, Dan is beaten through a door following an encounter with &quot;Tekken&quot; character Kazuya Mishima. Even then, Dan does make a non-playable appearance as the &quot;dummy&quot; in the game&#x27;s training mode. He is also seen in Sakura and Blanka&#x27;s ending, trapped inside of Pandora. Dan makes a cameo in Sentinel&#x27;s &quot;Marvel vs. Capcom 3&quot; ending, being beaten and dragged by one of the giant robots. In &quot;Street Fighter X Mega Man&quot;, Dan appears in between stages as Mega Man tests his new weapons on him. Dan is also shown to have a younger sister, Yuriko, who appears in his &quot;Marvel Super Heroes vs. Street Fighter&quot; ending and as the in-game shopkeeper in &quot;Street Fighter V&quot;.

Additionally, Dan has had a small appearance in the original video animation &quot;Street Fighter Alpha: The Animation&quot;. In the manga &quot;Street Fighter: Sakura Ganbaru!&quot;, Dan is featured as a supporting character, where he is shown to be knowledgeable on how Ki is channeled through a person&#x27;s body, acts as a guide for Sakura&#x27;s first few fights and is competent enough to take on small-time fighters, but hopelessly outclassed with more skillful challengers such as Balrog. Dan is also featured in UDON&#x27;s &quot;Street Fighter&quot; series, where he views Sakura as a rival, though he is usually defeated without much effort on her part. A few issues have revealed that if angered enough he can tap into the Satsui no Hado, but still is not as intimidating as he trips over Sakura&#x27;s backpack when he tries to use the Raging Demon. By the time of &quot;Super Street Fighter: New Generation&quot; (which adapts the events of &quot;Street Fighter III&quot;), Dan is shown to have lost his dojo and now works as a chef for E. Honda. He assists Guile and Alex in rescuing Ryu and curing Sakura of the Satsui no Hado. In &quot;Street Fighter Unlimited&quot;, Dan finally faces off against Sagat to avenge his father. Though Sagat dominates him throughout the fight, he gives up out of guilt and gives Dan the opportunity to finish him off, but Dan ultimately refuses to kill him as he realizes his father would not have wanted this. Dan&#x27; s name is mentioned in &quot;Street Fighter: Assassin&#x27;s Fist&quot; as a former student taught by Gouken before Ryu and Ken. In a deleted scene, Gouken tells Ryu and Ken how he taught Dan in his early days as a sensei but sent him due to wanting to use his training for revenge.

==Concept and creation==
Shortly after the release of &quot;Street Fighter II&quot;, rival company SNK released their own fighting game, &quot;Art of Fighting&quot;. The principal character of this series, Ryo Sakazaki, bore a resemblance in appearance and name to Ryu, as well as other aesthetic similarities to Ken, wearing an orange gi and sporting blonde hair.

In humorous retaliation, &quot;Street Fighter II&quot; co-designer Akiman drew an artwork of Sagat holding a defeated opponent by the head during the release of &quot;Street Fighter II: Champion Edition&quot;. The defeated opponent wore an attire similar to Ryo&#x27;s: an orange karate gi with a torn black shirt underneath and geta sandals; but had long dark hair tied to a ponytail like Robert Garcia, another character from the &quot;Art of Fighting&quot; series. This character design would become the basis of Dan, who was introduced as a secret character in &quot;Street Fighter Alpha&quot; until finally becoming a selectable character by default in the game&#x27;s sequel, &quot;Street Fighter Alpha 2&quot;. His fireball is telling: instead of using both hands to unleash his &quot;Gadōken&quot;, as Ryu and Ken do for the &quot;Hadōken&quot;, he propels it with one hand, like Ryo, Robert and Yuri do for the &quot;Kooh-ken&quot; (though Dan&#x27;s Gadōken has pitifully short range and does mediocre damage; it only gains longer range when the player uses the super version of the move, the &quot;Shinkū Gadōken&quot;). Dan can also taunt infinitely like the &quot;Art of Fighting&quot; games, unlike his fellow &quot;Street Fighter Alpha&quot; characters who can only taunt once per round in the Alpha series.

When developing &quot;Street Fighter IV&quot;, executive producer Yoshinori Ono emphasized Dan as a character he strongly wanted to have appear in the game. Ono stated that, while the character&#x27;s personality and actions earned him the label of a joke character, he felt Dan was a very technical fighting game character that could be used well and bring something unique to the game. In a later interview, he emphasized his desire to have Dan in the game again, citing the then-unveiled inclusion of Sakura Kasugano in home versions as added incentive.

===Character design===
Dan has a similar outfit to Ryu and Ken, wearing a traditional karate gi. Dan also wears a black undershirt like Ryo. His head and face closely resemble Robert (especially the ponytail hairstyle) except with comical features like pointed up &quot;angry&quot; eyebrows and a noticeable cleft chin, while his outfit is bright pink, reminiscent of Ryo&#x27;s orange outfit in &quot;Art of Fighting&quot;. In &quot;Street Fighter IV&quot;, the pink of his gi is faded in places, suggesting it was originally white, but turned pink after being mixed in with red-colored laundry.

Though his fighting stance is similar to Ken and Ryu&#x27;s, it is more &quot;loose&quot; and animated. Many of his mannerisms directly mirror those of Yuri Sakazaki. In &quot;Street Fighter IV&quot;, Dan&#x27;s stance more closely resembles Ryo Sakazaki&#x27;s fighting stance, rather than Ryu and Ken&#x27;s.

In &quot;Street Fighter IV&quot;, he can be seen with the kanji 最強流 (Saikyō-ryū) on his lapel. During some moves, the kanji 父 (father) or 弾 (bullet, pronounced &#x27;Dan&#x27;) appears on his back, similar to Akuma.

==Reception==
Dan&#x27;s character has received mostly positive reception from video game publications. IGN ranked him twelfth in their selection of the &quot;Top 25 Street Fighter Characters&quot;, noting his role as a &quot;fan favorite&quot; despite his status as a joke character. GameDaily listed Dan eighteenth in their &quot;Top 20 &quot;Street Fighter&quot; Characters of All Time&quot; article and the second-most &quot;bizarre&quot; fighting game character of all time, calling him &quot;fun&quot; despite his handicaps. Mikel Reparaz of GamesRadar listed Dan as the number one &quot;in-game in-joke&quot; in 2007, on the grounds of his becoming a fan favorite of &quot;overconfident players who want to show their skills.&quot; Reparaz published a feature on the character two years later, calling Dan &quot;a crappy version of Ryu or Ken&quot; who was nonetheless one of the most enjoyable playable characters in the series. The site additionally ranked Dan&#x27;s &quot;Shisso Buraiken&quot; from &quot;Street Fighter IV&quot; as one of &quot;gaming&#x27;s most satisfying uppercuts&quot; in 2010, describing it as a &quot;weaksauce version of Ryu&#x27;s Dragon Punch.&quot;

UGO Networks editor Paul Furfari chose Dan as one of the top 50 best &quot;Street Fighter&quot; characters, commenting that players could use him to &quot;insult or embarrass a competing player.&quot; Arcade Sushi included Dan among their &quot;10 Best Joke Characters of Gaming&quot; in 2013 for the &quot;unforgettable ... laughs he&#x27;s pulled out of fighting game fans.&quot; UGO listed Dan thirteenth in their selection of &quot;The 25 Awesomest Hidden Characters&quot; in gaming. Complex listed Dan eighteenth in their list of the twenty-five best characters in &quot;Street Fighter&quot; history in 2013, in addition to using his likeness as the lead image for the article. Series producer Yoshinori Ono jokingly announced at the 2011 Comic Con that Dan&#x27;s absence from &quot;Street Fighter X Tekken&quot; was due to a &quot;Tekken&quot; character having &quot;killed&quot; him in a newly released trailer for the game. Jordan Mallory of Joystiq published a mock eulogy of Dan in response. The boss character Chuck from &quot;Gogetsuji Legends&quot; (1995) was designed as a parody of Dan; Kurt Kalata of Hardcore Gaming 101 said, &quot;In other words, a copy of a copy.&quot; 4thletter.net rated Dan&#x27;s &quot;Super Gem Fighter Mini Mix&quot; ending, in which Sakura quits his dojo after only a couple days and calls him &quot;worthless&quot;, 26th in their 2013 ranking of the top 200 fighting game endings. &quot;When you&#x27;re talking about &quot;Street Fighter&quot; and comedy, Dan Hibiki can&#x27;t be too far behind.&quot;

However, Ryan Clements of IGN called Dan the &quot;most embarrassing character&quot; on the &quot;SFIV&quot; roster and Kotaku&#x27;s Brian Ashcraft criticized his English voiceover in the game. &quot;Complex&quot; named Dan the lamest series character in 2012 (&quot;intentionally underpowered with a truncated move list&quot;) and sixteenth among their &quot;50 Most Annoying Characters In Video Games&quot; the previous year due to his personality and in-game costume. &quot;Could there be anybody more pathetic? We can imagine that he&#x27;s an MMA fighter that Dipset once made the mistake of sponsoring.&quot; Smosh named Dan among the six &quot;lamest&quot; &quot;Street Fighter&quot; characters in 2014. &quot;Dan Hibiki may be a joke, but the joke is on the player that selects him.&quot;

<text>Eryops (; from Greek , , &#x27;drawn-out&#x27; + , , &#x27;face&#x27;, because most of its skull was in front of its eyes) is a genus of extinct, amphibious temnospondyls. It contains the single species , the fossils of which are found mainly in early Permian (about 295 million years ago) rocks of the Texas Red Beds, located in Archer County, Texas. Fossils have also been found in late Carboniferous period rocks from New Mexico. Several complete skeletons of &quot;Eryops&quot; have been found in lower Permian rocks, but skull bones and teeth are its most common fossils.

== Description ==

&quot;Eryops&quot; averaged a little over long and could grow up to , making them among the largest land animals of their time. Adults weighed between . The skull was proportionately large, being broad and flat and reaching lengths of . It had an enormous mouth with many curved teeth, like those of frogs. Its teeth had enamel with a folded pattern, leading to its early classification as a &quot;labyrinthodont&quot; (&quot;maze toothed&quot;). The shape and cross section of &quot;Eryops&quot; teeth made them exceptionally strong and resistant to stresses. The palate, or roof of the mouth, contained three pairs of backward-curved fangs, and was covered in backward-pointing bony projections which would have been used to trap slippery prey once caught. This, coupled with the wide gape, suggest an inertial method of feeding, in which the animal would grasp its prey and thrust forward, forcing the prey further back into its mouth.

&quot;Eryops&quot; was much more strongly built and sturdy than its relatives, and had the most massive and heavily ossified skeleton of all known temnospondyls. The limbs were especially large and strong. The pectoral girdle was highly developed, with a larger size for increased muscle attachments. Most notably, the shoulder girdle was disconnected from the skull, resulting in improved terrestrial locomotion. The crossopterygian cleithrum was retained as the clavicle, and the interclavicle was well-developed, lying on the underside of the chest. In primitive forms, the two clavicles and the interclavicle could have grown ventrally in such a way as to form a broad chest plate, although that was not the case in &quot;Eryops&quot;. The upper portion of the girdle had a flat scapular blade, with the glenoid cavity situated below performing as the articulation surface for the humerus, while ventrally there was a large flat coracoid plate turning in toward the midline.

The pelvic girdle was much larger than the simple plate found in fishes, accommodating more muscles. It extended far dorsally and was joined to the backbone by one or more specialized sacral ribs. The hind legs were somewhat specialized in that they not only supported weight, but also provided propulsion. The dorsal extension of the pelvis was the &quot;ilium&quot;, while the broad ventral plate was composed of the pubis in front and the ischium behind. The three bones met at a single point in the center of the pelvic triangle, called the &quot;acetabulum&quot;, providing a surface of articulation for the femur.

The texture of &quot;Eryops&quot; skin was revealed by a fossilized &quot;mummy&quot; described in 1941. This mummy specimen showed that the body in life was covered in a pattern of oval bumps.

==Discovery and species==

&quot;Eryops&quot; is currently thought to contain only one species, &quot;E. megacephalus&quot;, which means &quot;large-headed &quot;Eryops&quot;&quot;. &quot;E. megacephalus&quot; fossils have been found only in rocks dated to the early Permian period (Sakmarian age, about 295 million years ago) in the southwestern United States, primarily in the Admiral Formation of the Texas Red Beds. During the mid-20th century, some older fossils were classified as a second species of &quot;Eryops&quot;, &quot;E. avinoffi&quot;. This species, known from Carboniferous period fossil found in Pennsylvania, had originally been classified in the genus &quot;Glaukerpeton&quot;. Beginning in the late 1950s, some scientists concluded that &quot;Glaukerpeton&quot; was too similar to &quot;Eyrops&quot; to deserve its own genus. However, later studies supported the original classification of &quot;Glaukerpeton&quot;, finding it was more primitive than &quot;Eryops&quot; and other early temnospondyls. Supposed &quot;Eryops&quot; fossils found in older Pennsylvanian epoch rocks of the Conemaugh Group in West Virginia also turned out to be remains of &quot;Glaukerpeton&quot;. In 2005, a skull clearly belonging to &quot;Eryops&quot; was found in upper Pennsylvanian epoch rocks of the El Cobre Canyon Formation in New Mexico, representing the oldest known specimen.

==Paleobiology==
&quot;Eryops&quot; were among the most formidable early Permian carnivores and perhaps the only ones capable of competing with the dominant synapsids of the time, though because they were semi-aquatic, if not mostly aquatic, as suggested by long bone microanatomy, they probably did not come into frequent competition with synapsids. &quot;Eryops&quot; lived in lowland habitats in and around ponds, streams, and rivers, and the arrangement and shape of their teeth suggests that they probably ate mostly large fish and aquatic tetrapods. The torso of &quot;Eryops&quot; was relatively stiff and the tail stout, which would have made them poor swimmers. While they probably fed on fish, adult &quot;Eryops&quot; must have spent most of their time on land.

Like other large primitive temnospondyls, &quot;Eryops&quot; would have grown slowly and gradually from aquatic larvae, but they did not go through a major metamorphosis like many modern amphibians. While adults probably lived in ponds and rivers, perhaps venturing onto their banks, juvenile &quot;Eryops&quot; may have lived in swamps, which possibly offered more shelter from predators.

<text>Hermann Maier (born 7 December 1972) is an Austrian former World Cup champion alpine ski racer and Olympic gold medalist. Nicknamed the &quot;Herminator&quot;, Maier ranks among the greatest alpine ski racers in history, with four overall World Cup titles (1998, 2000, 2001, 2004), two Olympic gold medals (both in 1998), and three World Championship titles (1999: 2, and 2005). His 54 World Cup race victories – 24 super-G, 15 downhills, 14 giant slaloms, and 1 combined – rank third on the men&#x27;s all-time list behind Ingemar Stenmark&#x27;s 86 victories and Marcel Hirscher&#x27;s 67 victories. Until 2023 he held the record for the most points in one season by a male alpine skier, with 2000 points from the 2000 season. From 2000–2013 he also held the title of most points in one season by any alpine skier, until Tina Maze scored 2414 points in the 2013 season.

==Early years==
Maier did not initially enjoy much success in ski racing. As a 15-year-old at the Schladming ski academy, he was sent home after being told he would not succeed because of his slight build, caused by growth impairments. He returned home to his hometown of Flachau and his father&#x27;s ski school, which remains Maier&#x27;s home. He took up work as a bricklayer in the summer and a ski instructor in the winter.

Participating in local races, Maier became a multiple regional champion in Salzburg and Tyrol, but still was not able to gain a spot in the strong Austrian World Cup ski team. Putting that behind him, his outstanding talent was recognized for the first time by Austrian coaches on 6 January 1996, when he was timed with the 12th fastest time in a World Cup giant slalom in Flachau, although only starting as a forerunner, not participating in the actual competition. This would become the starting point of his international career. Through his result in Flachau he gained the attention of the ÖSV (Austrian Ski Federation) and only two days later he started in his first Europa Cup race in Les Arcs and finished in second place. He won his next race at the same location the day after. Although the Europa Cup season started in mid December and he joined late, so he wasn&#x27;t starting in all races, he won the overall Europa Cup title, as well as the season title in giant slalom.

==Ski career==
Maier made his World Cup debut at age 23 on 10 February 1996, and finished 26th in the giant slalom at Hinterstoder, Austria. A year later in February 1997, he won his first World Cup event – a super-G race in Garmisch-Partenkirchen. He quickly established himself as an explosive and dynamic racer, well known for his strength, willingness to take risks, and strong work ethic.

Maier soon dominated alpine ski racing, winning the gold medal in the giant slalom and super-G at the 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano, only a few days after a dramatic crash in the downhill race where he flew spectacularly off the sunlit course, landed partially on his head, tumbled head over heels several times, and crashed through two layers of B-netting. Despite the horrible look of the crash, Maier was able to walk out under his own power. That put him on the cover of &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; magazine and made him a well known sportsman around the globe. Maier won the overall World Cup title in 1998, as well as the super-G and giant slalom season titles, and placed second in the downhill standings.

In 2000 he won the overall World Cup title, as well as the season titles in downhill, super-G, and giant slalom. He had a dominating performance, setting the then most point garnered by an alpine skier, of 2000 points. This record stood until Tina Maze scored 2,414 points in 2013.

He won the overall World Cup title in 2001, as well as that season&#x27;s titles in downhill, super-G, and giant slalom. He won 13 World Cup races, but settled for two medals (silver and bronze) in the speed events at the 2001 World Championships in St. Anton. He was the reigning world champion in both events, won in 1999 at Beaver Creek, Colorado.

His racing career nearly ended following a near-fatal motorcycle accident on August 24, 2001; he collided with a car on his way home from a summer training session in Austria. Doctors nearly amputated his lower right leg, but instead Maier underwent massive reconstructive surgery. Most believed his racing career was over, and he had to sit out the 2002 season, missing the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City. He returned to international competition in January 2003 in Adelboden, Switzerland, and two weeks later won a super-G title in the skiing-mecca of Kitzbühel, Austria.

In 2004, his first full season back, he reclaimed both the super-G and overall titles — the latter being his fourth — and received the Laureus World Sports Award for the &quot;Comeback of the Year&quot;.

Reflecting his apparently indestructible nature, he is sometimes jocularly known as &quot;The Herminator.&quot; After his 1998 Olympic gold medals in Nagano he also appeared on &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot; on NBC – together with Austrian-born actor Arnold Schwarzenegger, who is known worldwide as &quot;The Terminator&quot;.
In 2004, Maier wrote an autobiography with his friend and former publicity agent, Knut Okresek. The book, &quot;Hermann Maier: Das Rennen Meines Lebens&quot; (in German), dealt mainly with his recovery from the 2001 motorcycle accident. In 2005, VeloPress, a Boulder, Colorado-based publisher affiliated with &quot;Ski Racing&quot; magazine, acquired the worldwide English language rights to the book, which was published in time for the 2006 Olympics in Turin, Italy, as &quot;Hermann Maier: The Race of My Life&quot;.

In October 2005, he won the opening giant slalom in Sölden to amass 51 victories in the World Cup. This placed him fifth on the career victory list, behind Ingemar Stenmark, Lindsey Vonn, Annemarie Moser-Pröll, and Vreni Schneider.

On 20 June 2007, Maier announced he was switching to Head as his equipment sponsor, ending his long affiliation with Atomic. Also switching from Atomic to Head at this time were champions Bode Miller of the U.S. and Didier Cuche of Switzerland.

On 18 January 2008, Maier finished second in the Kitzbühel&#x27;s super-G, behind Marco Büchel and in front of Didier Cuche for a total podium age of 104 years. His career results in the super-G races at Kitzbühel are the best in history (7 races: 5 wins and 2 second places). The following day, Maier finished fifth in the downhill. These were his best results of the 2008 season.

Maier won the first super-G of the 2009 season, held in Lake Louise, for his 24th super-G win. It was his 54th World Cup victory, but the first in nearly three years, and came a week before his 36th birthday. It was Maier&#x27;s fourth victory in the super-G at Lake Louise, the last coming five years earlier.

Maier announced his retirement in 2009 after thirteen years of competing in the World Cup circuit.

Maier also won an all-around sports competition, the 2001 edition of the American Superstars competition and he frequently acts in TV adverts for his sponsor bank Raiffeisen. His brother, Alexander Maier, also represented Austria at the Winter Olympics. Maier rode the prologue of the 2003 Tour de France ahead of the main field, completing the 6.5 km individual time trial in 8 minutes 44 seconds, compared to 7 minutes 26 seconds for stage winner Bradley McGee and 8 minutes 26 seconds for the last cyclist.

<doc id="453326" wikidata="Q183160" url="?curid=453326" title="Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter">
<text>The Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) is a spacecraft designed to search for the existence of water on Mars and provide support for missions to Mars, as part of NASA&#x27;s Mars Exploration Program. It was launched from Cape Canaveral on August 12, 2005, at 11:43 UTC and reached Mars on March 10, 2006, at 21:24 UTC. In November 2006, after six months of aerobraking, it entered its final science orbit and began its primary science phase.

Mission objectives include observing the climate of Mars, investigating geologic forces, providing reconnaissance of future landing sites, and relaying data from surface missions back to Earth. To support these objectives, the &quot;MRO&quot; carries different scientific instruments, including three cameras, two spectrometers and a subsurface radar. As of July 29, 2023, the &quot;MRO&quot; has returned over 450 terabits of data, helped choose safe landing sites for NASA&#x27;s Mars landers, discovered pure water ice in new craters and further evidence that water once flowed on the surface on Mars.

The spacecraft continues to operate at Mars, far beyond its intended design life. Due to its critical role as a high-speed data-relay for ground missions, NASA intends to continue the mission as long as possible, at least through the late 2020s. As of 03 18, 2025, the &quot;MRO&quot; has been active at Mars for sols, or , and is the third longest-lived spacecraft to orbit Mars, after &quot;2001 Mars Odyssey&quot; and &quot;Mars Express&quot;.

== Pre-launch ==
After the failures of the &quot;Mars Climate Orbiter&quot; and the Mars Polar Lander missions in 1999, NASA reorganized and replanned its Mars Exploration Program. In October 2000, NASA announced its reformulated Mars plans, which reduced the number of planned missions and introduced a new theme, &quot;follow the water&quot;. The plans included the &quot;Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter&quot; (&quot;MRO&quot;), to be launched in 2005.

On October 3, 2001, NASA chose Lockheed Martin as the primary contractor for the spacecraft&#x27;s fabrication. By the end of 2001 all of the mission&#x27;s instruments were selected. There were no major setbacks during the &quot;MRO&quot;&#x27;s construction, and the spacecraft was shipped to John F. Kennedy Space Center on May 1, 2005, to prepare it for launch.

== Mission objectives ==

&quot;MRO&quot; has both scientific and &quot;mission support&quot; objectives. The prime science mission was initially designed to last from November 2006 to November 2008, and the mission support phase from November 2006 to November 2010. Both missions have been extended.

The formal science objectives of &quot;MRO&quot; are to observe the present climate, particularly its atmospheric circulation and seasonal variations; search for signs of water, both past and present, and understand how it altered the planet&#x27;s surface; map and characterize the geological forces that shaped the surface.

To support other missions to Mars, the &quot;MRO&quot; also has mission support objectives. They are to provide data relay services from ground missions back to Earth, and characterize the safety and feasibility of potential future landing sites and Mars rover traverses.

&quot;MRO&quot; played a key role in choosing safe landing sites for the &quot;Phoenix&quot; lander in 2008, &quot;Mars Science Laboratory&quot; / &quot;Curiosity&quot; rover in 2012, &quot;InSight&quot; lander in 2018, and the &quot;Mars 2020&quot; / &quot;Perseverance&quot; rover in 2021.

== Launch and orbital insertion ==
On August 12, 2005, &quot;MRO&quot; was launched aboard an Atlas V-401 rocket from Space Launch Complex 41 at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. The Centaur upper stage of the rocket completed its burns over a 56-minute period and placed &quot;MRO&quot; into an interplanetary transfer orbit towards Mars.

&quot;MRO&quot; cruised through interplanetary space for seven and a half months before reaching Mars. While en route, most of the scientific instruments and experiments were tested and calibrated. To ensure proper orbital insertion upon reaching Mars, four trajectory correction maneuvers were planned and a fifth emergency maneuver was discussed. However, only three trajectory correction maneuvers were necessary, which saved of fuel that would be usable during &quot;MRO&quot;&#x27;s extended mission.

&quot;MRO&quot; began orbital insertion by approaching Mars on March 10, 2006, and passing above its southern hemisphere at an altitude of . All six of &quot;MRO&quot;&#x27;s main engines burned for 27 minutes to slow the probe by . The burn was remarkably accurate, as the insertion route had been designed more than three months prior, with the achieved change in speed only 0.01% short from the design, necessitating an additional 35 second burn time.

Completion of the orbital insertion placed the orbiter in a highly elliptical polar orbit with a period of approximately 35.5 hours. Shortly after insertion, the periapsis – the point in the orbit closest to Mars – was from the surface ( from the planet&#x27;s center). The apoapsis – the point in the orbit farthest from Mars – was from the surface ( from the planet&#x27;s center).

When &quot;MRO&quot; entered orbit, it joined five other active spacecraft that were either in orbit or on the planet&#x27;s surface: &quot;Mars Global Surveyor&quot;, &quot;Mars Express&quot;, &quot;2001 Mars Odyssey&quot;, and the two Mars Exploration Rovers (&quot;Spirit&quot; and &quot;Opportunity&quot;). This set a new record for the most operational spacecraft in the immediate vicinity of Mars.

On March 30, 2006, &quot;MRO&quot; began the process of aerobraking, a three-step procedure that halved the fuel needed to achieve a lower, more circular orbit with a shorter period. First, during its first five orbits of the planet (one Earth week), &quot;MRO&quot; used its thrusters to drop the periapsis of its orbit into aerobraking altitude. Second, while using its thrusters to make minor corrections to its periapsis altitude, &quot;MRO&quot; maintained aerobraking altitude for 445 planetary orbits (about five Earth months) to reduce the apoapsis of the orbit to . This was done in such a way so as to not heat the spacecraft too much, but also dip enough into the atmosphere to slow the spacecraft down. Third, after the process was complete, &quot;MRO&quot; used its thrusters to move its periapsis out of the edge of the atmosphere on August 30, 2006.

In September 2006, &quot;MRO&quot; fired its thrusters twice more to adjust its final, nearly circular orbit to approximately above the surface, with a period of about 112 minutes. The SHARAD radar antennas were deployed on September 16. All of the scientific instruments were tested and most were turned off prior to the solar conjunction that occurred from October 7 to November 6, 2006. This was done to prevent charged particles from the Sun from interfering with signals and potentially endangering the spacecraft. After the conjunction ended the &quot;primary science phase&quot; began.

== Timeline ==

On September 29, 2006 (sol ), &quot;MRO&quot; took its first high resolution image from its science orbit. This image is said to resolve items as small as 90 cm (3 feet) in diameter. On October 6, NASA released detailed pictures from the &quot;MRO&quot; of Victoria crater along with the &quot;Opportunity&quot; rover on the rim above it. In November, problems began to surface in the operation of two &quot;MRO&quot; spacecraft instruments. A stepping mechanism in the Mars Climate Sounder (MCS) skipped on multiple occasions resulting in a field of view that was slightly out of position. By December, normal operations of the instrument had been suspended, although a mitigation strategy allows the instrument to continue making most of its intended observations. Also, an increase in noise and resulting bad pixels has been observed in several CCDs of the High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE). Operation of this camera with a longer warm-up time has alleviated the issue. However, the cause is still unknown and may return.

On November 17, 2006, NASA announced the successful test of the &quot;MRO&quot; as an orbital communications relay. Using the NASA rover &quot;Spirit&quot; as the point of origin for the transmission, the &quot;MRO&quot; acted as a relay for transmitting data back to Earth. HiRISE was able to photograph the &quot;Phoenix&quot; lander during its parachuted descent to Vastitas Borealis on May 25, 2008 (sol ).

The orbiter continued to experience recurring problems in 2009, including four spontaneous resets, culminating in a four-month shut-down of the spacecraft from August to December. While engineers have not determined the cause of the recurrent resets, they have created new software to help troubleshoot the problem should it recur. Another spontaneous reset occurred in September 2010.

On March 3, 2010, the &quot;MRO&quot; passed another significant milestone, having transmitted over 100 terabits of data back to Earth, which was more than all other interplanetary probes sent from Earth combined.

In December 2010, the first Extended Mission began. Goals included exploring seasonal processes, searching for surface changes, and providing support for other Martian spacecraft. This lasted until October 2012, after which NASA started the &quot;MRO&quot;&#x27;s second Extended Mission, which lasted until October 2014. As of 2023, the &quot;MRO&quot; has completed five missions, and is currently on its sixth.

On August 6, 2012 (sol ), the orbiter passed over Gale crater, the landing site of the Mars Science Laboratory mission, during its EDL phase. It captured an image via the HiRISE camera of the &quot;Curiosity&quot; rover descending with its backshell and supersonic parachute. In December 2014 and April 2015, &quot;Curiosity&quot; was photographed again by HiRISE inside Gale Crater.

Another computer anomaly occurred on March 9, 2014, when the &quot;MRO&quot; put itself into safe mode after an unscheduled swap from one computer to another. The &quot;MRO&quot; resumed normal science operations four days later. This occurred again in April 11, 2015, after which the MRO returned to full operational capabilities a week later.

NASA reported that the &quot;MRO&quot;, as well as the &quot;Mars Odyssey&quot; Orbiter and &quot;MAVEN&quot; orbiter had a chance to study the Comet Siding Spring flyby on October 19, 2014. To minimize risk of damage from the material shed by the comet, the &quot;MRO&quot; made orbital adjustments on July 2, 2014 and August 27, 2014. During the flyby, the &quot;MRO&quot; took the best ever pictures of a comet from the Oort cloud and was not damaged.

In January 2015, the &quot;MRO&quot; discovered and identified the wreckage of Britain&#x27;s &quot;Beagle 2&quot;, which was lost during its landing phase in 2003 and was thought to have crashed. The images revealed that &quot;Beagle 2&quot; had actually landed safely, but one or two of its solar panels had failed to fully deploy, which blocked the radio antenna. In October 2016, the crash site of another lost spacecraft, &quot;Schiaparelli&quot; EDM, was photographed by the &quot;MRO&quot;, using both the CTX and HiRISE cameras.

On July 29, 2015, the &quot;MRO&quot; was placed into a new orbit to provide communications support during the anticipated arrival of the &quot;InSight&quot; Mars lander mission in September 2016. The maneuver&#x27;s engine burn lasted for 75 seconds. &quot;InSight&quot; was delayed and missed the 2016 launch window, but was successfully launched during the next window on May 5, 2018, and landed on November 26, 2018.

Due to the longevity of the mission, a number of &quot;MRO&quot; components have started deteriorating. From the start of the mission in 2005 to 2017, the &quot;MRO&quot; had used a miniature inertial measurement unit (MIMU) for altitude and orientation control. After 58,000 hours of use, and limited signs of life, the orbiter switched over to a backup, which, as of 2018, has reached 52,000 hours of use. To conserve the life of the backup, NASA switched from MIMUs to an &quot;all-stellar&quot; mode for routine operations in 2018. The &quot;all-stellar&quot; mode uses cameras and pattern recognition software to determine the location of stars, which can then be used to identify the &quot;MRO&quot;&#x27;s orientation. Problems with blurring in pictures from HiRISE and battery degradation also arose in 2017 but have since been resolved. In August 2023, electronic units within the HiRISE&#x27;s CCD RED4 sensor began to fail as well, and are causing visual artifacts in pictures taken.

In 2017, the cryocoolers used by CRISM completed their lifecycle, limiting the instrument&#x27;s capabilities to visible wavelengths, instead of its full wavelength range. In 2022, NASA announced the shutdown of CRISM in its entirety, and the instrument was formally retired on April 3, 2023, after creating two final, near global, maps using prior data and a more limited second spectrometer that did not require cryocoolers.

== Instruments ==
Three cameras, two spectrometers and a radar are included on the orbiter along with three engineering instruments and two &quot;science-facility experiments&quot;, which use data from engineering subsystems to collect science data. Two of the engineering instruments are being used to test and demonstrate new equipment for future missions. The &quot;MRO&quot; takes around 29,000 images per year.

=== HiRISE ===
The High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE) camera is a reflecting telescope, the largest ever carried on a deep space mission, and has a resolution of 1 microradian, or from an altitude of . In comparison, satellite images of Earth are generally available with a resolution of . HiRISE collects images in three color bands, 400 to 600 nm (blue–green or B–G), 550 to 850 nm (red) and 800 to 1,000 nm (near infrared).

Red color images are 20,264 pixels across ( wide), and B–G and NIR are 4,048 pixels across ( wide). HiRISE&#x27;s onboard computer reads these lines in time with the orbiter&#x27;s ground speed, and images are potentially unlimited in length. Practically however, their length is limited by the computer&#x27;s 28 Gb memory capacity, and the nominal maximum size is 20,000 × 40,000 pixels (800 megapixels) and 4,000 × 40,000 pixels (160 megapixels) for B–G and NIR images. Each 16.4 Gb image is compressed to 5 Gb before transmission and release to the general public on the HiRISE website in JPEG 2000 format. To facilitate the mapping of potential landing sites, HiRISE can produce stereo pairs of images from which topography can be calculated to an accuracy of . HiRISE was built by Ball Aerospace &amp; Technologies Corp.

=== CTX ===
The Context Camera (CTX) provides grayscale images (500 to 800 nm) with a pixel resolution up to about . CTX is designed to provide context maps for the targeted observations of HiRISE and CRISM, and is also used to mosaic large areas of Mars, monitor a number of locations for changes over time, and to acquire stereo (3D) coverage of key regions and potential future landing sites. The optics of CTX consist of a focal length Maksutov Cassegrain telescope with a 5,064 pixel wide line array CCD. The instrument takes pictures wide and has enough internal memory to store an image long before loading it into the main computer. The camera was built, and is operated by Malin Space Science Systems. CTX had mapped more than 99% of Mars by March 2017 and helped create an interactive map of Mars in 2023.

=== MARCI ===
The Mars Color Imager (MARCI) is a wide-angle, relatively low-resolution camera that views the surface of Mars in five visible and two ultraviolet bands. Each day, MARCI collects about 84 images and produces a global map with pixel resolutions of . This map provides a weekly weather report for Mars, helps to characterize its seasonal and annual variations, and maps the presence of water vapor and ozone in its atmosphere. The camera was built and is operated by Malin Space Science Systems. It has a 180-degree fisheye lens with the seven color filters bonded directly on a single CCD sensor. The same MARCI camera was onboard Mars Climate Orbiter launched in 1998.

=== CRISM ===
The Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer for Mars (CRISM) instrument is a visible and near infrared spectrometer that is used to produce detailed maps of the surface mineralogy of Mars. It operates from 362 to 3920 nm, measures the spectrum in 544 channels (each 6.55 nm wide), and has a resolution of at an altitude of . CRISM is being used to identify minerals and chemicals indicative of the past or present existence of water on the surface of Mars. These materials include iron oxides, phyllosilicates, and carbonates, which have characteristic patterns in their visible-infrared energy. The CRISM instrument was shut down on April 3, 2023.

=== MCS ===
The Mars Climate Sounder (MCS) is a radiometer that looks both down and horizontally through the atmosphere in order to quantify the atmosphere&#x27;s vertical variations. It has one visible/near infrared channel (0.3 to 3.0 μm) and eight far infrared (12 to 50 μm) channels selected for the purpose. MCS observes the atmosphere on the horizon of Mars (as viewed from MRO) by breaking it up into vertical slices and taking measurements within each slice in increments. These measurements are assembled into daily global weather maps to show the basic variables of Martian weather: temperature, pressure, humidity, and dust density. The MCS weighs roughly and began operation in November 2006. Since beginning operation, it has helped create maps of mesospheric clouds, study and categorize dust storms, and provide direct evidence of carbon dioxide snow on Mars.

This instrument, supplied by NASA&#x27;s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), is an updated version of a heavier, larger instrument originally developed at JPL for the 1992 &quot;Mars Observer&quot; and 1998 &quot;Mars Climate Orbiter&quot; missions, which both failed.

=== SHARAD ===
The Shallow Radar (SHARAD) sounder experiment onboard &quot;MRO&quot; is designed to probe the internal structure of the Martian polar ice caps. It also gathers planet-wide information about underground layers of regolith, rock, and ice that might be accessible from the surface. SHARAD emits HF radio waves between 15 and 25 MHz, a range that allows it to resolve layers as thin as to a maximum depth of . It has a horizontal resolution of . SHARAD is designed to complement the Mars Express MARSIS instrument, which has coarser resolution but penetrates to a much greater depth. Both SHARAD and MARSIS were made by the Italian Space Agency.

=== Engineering instruments and experiments ===
In addition to its imaging equipment, &quot;MRO&quot; carries three engineering instruments. The Electra communications package is a UHF software-defined radio that provides a flexible platform for evolving relay capabilities. It is designed to communicate with other spacecraft as they approach, land, and operate on Mars. In addition to protocol controlled inter-spacecraft data links of 1 kbit/s to 2 Mbit/s, Electra also provides Doppler data collection, open loop recording and a highly accurate timing service based on an ultra-stable oscillator. Doppler information for approaching vehicles can be used for final descent targeting or descent and landing trajectory recreation. Doppler information on landed vehicles allows scientists to accurately determine the surface location of Mars landers and rovers. The two Mars Exploration Rover (MER) spacecraft utilized an earlier generation UHF relay radio providing similar functions through the Mars Odyssey orbiter. The Electra radio has relayed information to and from the MER spacecraft, &quot;Phoenix&quot; lander and &quot;Curiosity&quot; rover. 
During the cruise phase, the &quot;MRO&quot; also used the Telecommunications Experiment Package to demonstrate a less power-intensive way to communicate with Earth.

The Optical Navigation Camera images the Martian moons, Phobos and Deimos, against background stars to precisely determine &quot;MRO&quot;&#x27;s orbit. Although this is not critical, it was included as a technology test for future orbiting and landing of spacecraft. The Optical Navigation Camera was tested successfully in February and March 2006.

Two additional science investigations are also on the spacecraft. The Gravity Field Investigation Package measures variations in the Martian gravitational field through variations in the spacecraft&#x27;s speed. Speed changes are detected by measuring doppler shifts in &quot;MRO&quot;&#x27;s radio signals received on Earth. Data from this investigation can be used to understand the subsurface geology of Mars, determine the density of the atmosphere and track seasonal changes in the location of carbon dioxide deposited on the surface.

The Atmospheric Structure Investigation used sensitive onboard accelerometers to deduce the &quot;in situ&quot; atmospheric density of Mars during aerobraking. The measurements helped provide greater understanding of seasonal wind variations, the effects of dust storms, and the structure of the atmosphere.

== Spacecraft Systems ==
=== Structure ===
Workers at Lockheed Martin Space Systems in Denver assembled the spacecraft structure and attached the instruments. Instruments were constructed at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, the University of Arizona Lunar and Planetary Laboratory in Tucson, Arizona, Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Maryland, the Italian Space Agency in Rome, and Malin Space Science Systems in San Diego.

The structure is made mostly of carbon composites and aluminum-honeycombed plates. The titanium fuel tank takes up most of the volume and mass of the spacecraft and provides most of its structural integrity. The spacecraft&#x27;s total mass is less than with an unfueled dry mass less than .

=== Power systems ===

&quot;MRO&quot; gets all of its electrical power from two solar panels, each of which can move independently around two axes (up-down, or left-right rotation). Each solar panel measures and has covered with 3,744 individual photovoltaic cells. Its high-efficiency solar cells are able to convert more than 26% of the energy it receives from the Sun directly into electricity and are connected together to produce a total output of 32 volts. Whilst orbiting Mars, the panels together produce 600–2000 watts of power; in contrast, the panels would generate 6,000 watts in a comparable Earth orbit by being closer to the Sun.

&quot;MRO&quot; has two rechargeable nickel-hydrogen batteries used to power the spacecraft when it is not facing the Sun. Each battery has an energy storage capacity of 50 ampere hours (180 kC). The full range of the batteries cannot be used due to voltage constraints on the spacecraft, but allows the operators to extend the battery life—a valuable capability, given that battery drain is one of the most common causes of long-term satellite failure. Planners anticipate that only 40% of the batteries&#x27; capacities will be required during the lifetime of the spacecraft.

=== Electronic systems ===
&quot;MRO&quot;&#x27;s main computer is a 133 MHz, 10.4 million transistor, 32-bit, RAD750 processor, a radiation-hardened version of a PowerPC 750 or G3 processor with a purpose-built motherboard. The operating system software is VxWorks and has extensive fault protection protocols and monitoring.

Data is stored in a 160 Gbit (20 GB) flash memory module consisting of over 700 memory chips, each with a 256 Mbit capacity. This memory capacity is not actually that large considering the amount of data to be acquired; for example, a single image from the HiRISE camera can be as large as 28 Gb.

=== Telecommunications system ===

When it was launched, the Telecom Subsystem on &quot;MRO&quot; was the best digital communication system sent into deep space, and for the first time used capacity-approaching turbo-codes. It was more powerful than any previous deep space mission, and is able to transmit data more than ten times faster than previous Mars missions. Along with the Electra communications package, the system consists of a very large () antenna, which is used to transmit data through the Deep Space Network via X-band frequencies at 8.41 GHz. It also demonstrates the use of the Ka band at 32 GHz for higher data rates. Maximum transmission speed from Mars can be as high as 6 Mbit/s, but averages between 0.5 and 4 Mbit/s. The spacecraft carries two 100-watt X-band Travelling Wave Tube Amplifiers (TWTA) (one of which is a backup), one 35-watt Ka-band amplifier, and two Small Deep Space Transponders (SDSTs).

Two smaller low-gain antennas are also present for lower-rate communication during emergencies and special events. These antennas do not have focusing dishes and can transmit and receive from any direction. They are an important backup system to ensure that &quot;MRO&quot; can always be reached, even if its main antenna is pointed away from the Earth.

The Ka band subsystem was used to show how such a system could be used by spacecraft in the future. Due to lack of spectrum at 8.41 GHz X-band, future high-rate deep space missions will use 32 GHz Ka-band. NASA Deep Space Network (DSN) implemented Ka-band receiving capabilities at all three of its complexes (Goldstone, Canberra and Madrid) over its 34-m beam-waveguide (BWG) antenna subnet. Ka-band tests were also planned during the science phase, but during aerobraking a switch failed, limiting the X-band high gain antenna to a single amplifier. If this amplifier fails all high-speed X-band communications will be lost. The Ka downlink is the only remaining backup for this functionality, and since the Ka-band capability of one of the SDST transponders has already failed, (and the other might have the same problem) JPL decided to halt all Ka-band demonstrations and hold the remaining capability in reserve.

By November 2013, the &quot;MRO&quot; had passed 200 terabits in the amount of science data returned. The data returned by the mission is more than three times the total data returned via NASA&#x27;s Deep Space Network for all the other missions managed by NASA&#x27;s Jet Propulsion Laboratory over the past 10 years.

=== Propulsion and attitude control ===
The spacecraft uses a fuel tank filled with of hydrazine monopropellant. Fuel pressure is regulated by adding pressurized helium gas from an external tank. Seventy percent of the propellant was used for orbital insertion, and it has enough propellant to keep functioning into the 2030s.

&quot;MRO&quot; has 20 rocket engine thrusters on board. Six large thrusters each produce of thrust for a total of meant mainly for orbital insertion. These thrusters were originally designed for the Mars Surveyor 2001 Lander. Six medium thrusters each produce of thrust for trajectory correction maneuvers and attitude control during orbit insertion. Finally, eight small thrusters each produce of thrust for attitude control during normal operations.

Four reaction wheels are also used for precise attitude control during activities requiring a highly stable platform, such as high-resolution imaging, in which even small motions can cause blurring of the image. Each wheel is used for one axis of motion. The fourth wheel is a backup in case one of the other three wheels fails. Each wheel weighs and can be spun as fast as 100 Hz or 6,000 rpm.

In order to determine the spacecraft&#x27;s orbit and facilitate maneuvers, 16 Sun sensors – eight primaries and eight backups – are placed around the spacecraft to calibrate solar direction relative to the orbiter&#x27;s frame. Two star trackers, digital cameras used to map the position of catalogued stars, provide NASA with full, three-axis knowledge of the spacecraft orientation and attitude. A primary and backup Miniature Inertial Measurement Unit (MIMU), provided by Honeywell, measures changes to the spacecraft attitude as well as any non-gravitationally induced changes to its linear velocity. Each MIMU is a combination of three accelerometers and three ring-laser gyroscopes. These systems are all critically important to &quot;MRO&quot;, as it must be able to point its camera to a very high precision in order to take the high-quality pictures that the mission requires. It has also been specifically designed to minimize any vibrations on the spacecraft, so as to allow its instruments to take images without any distortions caused by vibrations.

== Cost ==
The total cost of the &quot;MRO&quot; through the end of its prime mission was . Of this amount, was spent on spacecraft development, approximately for its launch, and for 5 years of mission operations. Since 2011, &quot;MRO&quot;&#x27;s annual operations costs are, on average, per year, when adjusted for inflation.

== Discoveries ==
=== Ice ===

An article in the journal &quot;Science&quot; in September 2009, reported that some new craters on Mars have excavated relatively pure water ice. After being exposed, the ice gradually fades as it sublimates away. These new craters were found and dated by the CTX camera, and the identification of the ice was confirmed using CRISM. The ice was found in a five locations, three of which were in the Cebrenia quadrangle. These locations are ; ; and . Two others are in the Diacria quadrangle: and .

Radar results from SHARAD suggested that features termed lobate debris aprons (LDAs) contain large amounts of water ice. Of interest from the days of the Viking Orbiters, these LDA are aprons of material surrounding cliffs. They have a convex topography and a gentle slope; this suggests flow away from the steep source cliff. In addition, lobate debris aprons can show surface lineations just as rock glaciers on the Earth. SHARAD has provided strong evidence that the LDAs in Hellas Planitia are glaciers that are covered with a thin layer of debris (i.e. rocks and dust); a strong reflection from the top and base of LDAs was observed, suggesting that pure water ice makes up the bulk of the formation (between the two reflections). Based on the experiments of the &quot;Phoenix&quot; lander and the studies of the &quot;Mars Odyssey&quot; from orbit, water ice is known to exist just under the surface of Mars in the far north and south (high latitudes).

=== Chloride deposits and aqueous minerals===

Using data from &quot;Mars Global Surveyor&quot;, &quot;Mars Odyssey&quot;, and the &quot;MRO&quot;, scientists have found widespread deposits of chloride minerals. Evidence suggests that the deposits were formed from the evaporation of mineral enriched waters. The research suggests that lakes may have been scattered over large areas of the Martian surface. Usually, chlorides are the last minerals to come out of solution. Carbonates, sulfates, and silica should precipitate out ahead of them. Sulfates and silica have been found by the Mars rovers on the surface. Places with chloride minerals may have once held various life forms. Furthermore, such areas could preserve traces of ancient life.

In 2009, a group of scientists from the CRISM team reported on nine to ten different classes of minerals formed in the presence of water. Different types of clays (also called phyllosilicates) were found in many locations. The phyllosilicates identified included aluminum smectite, iron/magnesium smectite, kaolinite, prehnite, and chlorite. Rocks containing carbonate were found around the Isidis basin. Carbonates belong to one class in which life could have developed. Areas around Valles Marineris were found to contain hydrated silica and hydrated sulfates. The researchers identified hydrated sulfates and ferric minerals in Terra Meridiani and in Valles Marineris. Other minerals found on Mars were jarosite, alunite, hematite, opal, and gypsum. Two to five of the mineral classes were formed with the right pH and sufficient water to permit life to grow.

=== Recurring slope lineae ===

On August 4, 2011 (sol ), NASA announced that &quot;MRO&quot; had detected dark streaks on slopes, known as &quot;recurring slope lineae&quot; caused by what appeared to be flowing salty water on the surface or subsurface of Mars. On September 28, 2015, this finding was at a special NASA news conference. In 2017, however, further research suggested that the dark streaks were created by grains of sand and dust slipping down slopes, and not water darkening the ground.

<doc id="453329" wikidata="Q4783298" url="?curid=453329" title="Arab tribes of Iraq">
<text>Many Iraqi Arabs identify strongly with a tribe (العشيرة &quot;&#x27;ashira&quot;). 30 of the 150 or so identifiable tribes of Iraq are the most influential. They are grouped into federations (قبيلة &quot;qabila&quot;). Within the tribe, there is the clan (الفخذ &quot;fukhdh&quot;), the house (البيت &quot;beit&quot;) and the extended family (الخمس &quot;khams&quot;). Tribes are led by sheikhs (شيخ &quot;sheykh&quot;) who represent the tribe and deal with its domestic affairs. Due to the large sizes of Iraq&#x27;s tribes, an individual may belong to the Shammar tribe, but also the Aslam branch within the same tribe, and therefore can identify with both. There are hundreds of Arab tribes across Iraq from the north to the south.

On its accession to power in the 17 July Revolution of 1968, Iraq&#x27;s Ba&#x27;ath Party announced its opposition to tribalism ( القبلية &quot;al-qabaliyya&quot;), although for pragmatic reasons, especially during the Iran–Iraq War, tribalism was sometimes tolerated and even encouraged.

<doc id="453331" wikidata="Q16271405" url="?curid=453331" title="Apache Struts 1">
<text>Apache Struts 1 is an open-source web application framework for developing Java EE web applications. It uses and extends the Java Servlet API to encourage developers to adopt a model–view–controller (MVC) architecture. It was originally created by Craig McClanahan and donated to the Apache Foundation in May 2000. Formerly located under the Apache Jakarta Project and known as Jakarta Struts, it became a top-level Apache project in 2005.

The WebWork framework spun off from Apache Struts aiming to offer enhancements and refinements while retaining the same general architecture of the original Struts framework. However, it was announced in December 2005 that Struts would re-merge with WebWork. WebWork 2.2 has been adopted as Apache Struts 2, which reached its first full release in February 2007.

In addition to the current and constantly evolving successor version Struts 2, a clone of Struts 1 exists since 2022, which updates the legacy framework of Struts 1 to a current Jakarta EE compatible stack.

== Design goals and overview ==
In a standard Java EE web application, the client will typically call to the server via a web form. The information is then either handed over to a Java Servlet which interacts with a database and produces an HTML-formatted response, or it is given to a JavaServer Pages (JSP) document that intermingles HTML and Java code to achieve the same result.
Both approaches are often considered inadequate for large projects because they mix application logic with presentation and make maintenance difficult.

The goal of Struts is to separate the &quot;model&quot; (application logic that interacts with a database) from the &quot;view&quot; (HTML pages presented to the client) and the &quot;controller&quot; (instance that passes information between view and model). Struts provides the controller (a servlet known as codice_1) and facilitates the writing of templates for the view or presentation layer (typically in JSP, but XML/XSLT and Velocity are also supported). The web application programmer is responsible for writing the model code, and for creating a central configuration file codice_2 that binds together model, view, and controller.

Requests from the client are sent to the controller in the form of &quot;Actions&quot; defined in the configuration file; if the controller receives such a request it calls the corresponding Action class that interacts with the application-specific model code. The model code returns an &quot;ActionForward&quot;, a string telling the controller what output page to send to the client. Information is passed between model and view in the form of special JavaBeans. A powerful custom tag library allows it from the presentation layer to read and write the content of these beans without the need for any embedded Java code.

Struts is categorized as a Model 2 request-based web application framework.

Struts also supports internationalization by web forms, and includes a template mechanism called &quot;Tiles&quot; that (for instance) allows the presentation layer to be composed from independent header, footer, menu navigation and content components.

<text>In electronics, the Gummel plot is the combined plot of the base and collector electric currents, formula_1 and formula_2, of a bipolar transistor vs. the base–emitter voltage, formula_3, on a semi-logarithmic scale. This plot is very useful in device characterization because it reflects on the quality of the emitter–base junction while the base–collector bias, formula_4, is kept constant.

A number of other device parameters can be garnered either quantitatively or qualitatively directly from the Gummel plot:
* The common-emitter current gain, formula_5, and the common-base current gain, formula_6,
* Base and collector ideality factors, formula_7,
* Series resistances and leakage currents.
Sometimes the DC current gain, formula_5, is plotted on the same figure as well.

<doc id="453338" wikidata="Q7033679" url="?curid=453338" title="Night of the Aurochs">
<text>Night of the Aurochs is an unfinished novel by Dalton Trumbo (died 1976), published posthumously in 1979.

==Plot introduction==
&quot;Aurochs&quot; is an attempt by Trumbo to tell the tale of World War II through the eyes of a Nazi by the name of Grieban, commandant of the concentration camp at Auschwitz.

The book is compiled and edited by Robert Kirsch. The story starts out narrated in the first person through a series of letters written by Grieban, but later is written in the third person.

==Plot summary==

In his narration, Grieban tries to link the ethical nature of the Nazi movement to the American Civil War by saying the comparisons are undeniable: Fighting to keep the races pure and separated. Grieban may be looked at as the epitome of one fighting for the cause, but he himself fails to live up to his own high ideals of racial purity when he falls in &#x27;love&#x27; with a Jewish woman during his years as a Nazi concentration camp commandant.

==Major themes==
In the latter parts of the book one can see sympathy for Grieban, and Greiban is depicted as a broken man, living out the rest of his years in hiding, and dying with no one around who particularly cares about him.

For authenticity, Trumbo, as was in the case of &quot;Johnny Got His Gun&quot;, tried to become the character that he was writing about.</text><links>
