<text>Andrew Hamilton (died 1703) was the colonial governor of East and West New Jersey from 1692 to 1697 and again from 1699 to 1703. He also served as Deputy Governor of the neighboring Province of Pennsylvania.

==Biography==
Hamilton was born in Scotland. Originally a merchant in Edinburgh, he was sent to East Jersey to act as an agent to recruit men to settle there. His work brought him a recommendation for becoming a member of the council of New Jersey. In March 1687, he became the deputy-governor for East Jersey on the absence of Deputy-Governor Lord Neill Campbell, who returned to England for business reasons.

After Edmund Andros took control over the rest of New England, Hamilton sailed back to England to consult with the proprietaries of New Jersey. On the voyage, he was captured by the French, delaying his journey to London until May 1690.

In March 1692, Hamilton was appointed governor of both West Jersey and East Jersey. During his governorship, Hamilton found that New Jersey was fraught with external and internal problems. Royal authorities attempted to remove the proprietors from power and create a large colony of New England. New York was demanding help for defense during the war with France. In addition, many of the inhabitants refused to pay the quitrents, fees on land. The Quakers in West Jersey were against providing any money to New York, since they were pacifists. Hamilton and the non-Quaker councilmen managed to acquire the necessary money. Despite this, Hamilton remained on friendly terms with the Quakers, which allowed several successful laws to pass. During his governorship, he patented the first colonial postal service. Parliament later deposed Hamilton because &quot;no other than a natural-born subject of England could serve in any public post of trust or profit&quot; (Hamilton was Scottish).

However, after poor administration by Jeremiah Basse, he was reappointed on 19 August 1699. By then, the state government was already in a weak state, and several riots erupted in the second term as governor over tax issues. Other riots (especially in East Jersey) occurred because many of the settlers refused to recognize the legitimacy of the government. In 1701, he became the deputy-governor of Pennsylvania, appointed by William Penn.

One of the reasons which caused Penn to return to England was the bill before the House of Lords to change proprietorship to Royal Governors. Although this was not approved, after the death of King William III, an act passed requiring Royal assent to persons named as (deputy) governors. Hamilton also made preparations for organizing a defensive force in the province to assuage the group in Parliament who were questioning the fitness of the Quaker led Assembly to help defend the colonies in North America, at this time.

While on a visit to New Jersey, Hamilton died on 20 April 1703.

<text>Stanine (STAndard NINE) is a method of scaling test scores on a nine-point standard scale with a mean of five and a standard deviation of two.

Some web sources attribute stanines to the U.S. Army Air Forces during World War II. Psychometric legend has it that a 1–9 scale was used because of the compactness of recording the score as a single digit but Thorndike claims that by reducing scores to just nine values, stanines &quot;reduce the tendency to try to interpret small score differences (p. 131)&quot;. The earliest known use of stanines was by the U.S. Army Air Forces in 1942.

==Calculation==
Test scores are scaled to stanine scores using the following algorithm:
# Rank results from lowest to highest
# Give the lowest 4% a stanine of 1, the next 7% a stanine of 2, etc., according to the following table:

The underlying basis for obtaining stanines is that a normal distribution is divided into nine intervals, each of which has a width of 0.5 standard deviations excluding the first and last, which are just the remainder (the tails of the distribution). The median lies at the centre of the fifth interval.

==Use today==
Today stanines are mostly used in educational assessment. 
* The University of Alberta in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada used the stanine system until 2003, when it switched to a 4-point scale. 
* In the United States, the Educational Records Bureau (they administer the &quot;ERBs&quot;) reports test scores as stanines and percentiles.
* The New Zealand Council for Educational Research uses stanines.
* GL Assessment use stanines alongside SAS (Standardised Age Scores) to express the results of its CAT4 assessments, used in many UK and British international schools 
* The Otis-Lennon School Ability Test uses a stanine system along with percentiles.
* High schools in Korea use a stanine system to evaluate their students.
* The IDF (Israeli Defense Force) uses the stanine grading system ranging from 10 to 90 (10, 20, 30 and so on) to rank intelligence ability relevant to the army&#x27;s use, determined by a 100 question test divided to 4 categories having to do with different uses and implications of cognitive abilities
* The Polish Matura secondary-school exam results and university admissions utilise the stanine system

<doc id="465578" wikidata="Q574807" url="?curid=465578" title="Dionysia">
<text>The Dionysia (; Greek: Διονύσια) was a large festival in ancient Athens in honor of the god Dionysus, the central events of which were the theatrical performances of dramatic tragedies and, from 487 BC, comedies. It was the second-most important festival after the Panathenaia. The Dionysia actually consisted of two related festivals, the Rural Dionysia and the City Dionysia, which took place in different parts of the year. 

==Rural Dionysia==
The Dionysia was originally a rural festival in Eleutherae, Attica ( – &quot;Dionysia ta kat&#x27; agrous&quot;), probably celebrating the cultivation of vines. It was probably a very ancient festival, perhaps not originally associated with Dionysus. This &quot;rural Dionysia&quot; was held during the winter, in the month of Poseideon (the month straddling the winter solstice, i.e., Dec.–Jan.). The central event was the &quot;pompe&quot; (πομπή), the procession, in which &quot;phalloi&quot; (φαλλοί) were carried by &quot;phallophoroi&quot; (φαλλοφόροι). Also participating in the &quot;pompe&quot; were &quot;kanephoroi&quot; (κανηφόροι – young girls carrying baskets), &quot;obeliaphoroi&quot; (ὀβελιαφόροι – who carried long loaves of bread), &quot;skaphephoroi&quot; (σκαφηφόροι – who carried other offerings), &quot;hydriaphoroi&quot; (ὑδριαφόροι – who carried jars of water), and &quot;askophoroi&quot; (ἀσκοφόροι – who carried goatskin bags of wine).

After the &quot;pompe&quot; procession was completed, there were contests of dancing and singing, and choruses (led by a &quot;choregos&quot;) would perform dithyrambs. Some festivals may have included dramatic performances, possibly of the tragedies and comedies that had been produced at the City Dionysia the previous year. This was more common in the larger towns, such as Piraeus, Eleusis and Icaria/Ikarion.

Because the various towns in Attica held their festivals on different days, it was possible for spectators to visit more than one festival per season. It was also an opportunity for Athenian citizens to travel outside the city if they did not have the opportunity to do so during the rest of the year. This also allowed travelling companies of actors to perform in more than one town during the period of the festival.

The comic playwright Aristophanes parodied the Rural Dionysia in his play &quot;The Acharnians&quot;.

==City Dionysia==

===Origins===
The City Dionysia (&quot;Dionysia ta en Astei – Διονύσια τὰ ἐν Ἄστει&quot;, also known as the Great Dionysia, &quot;Dionysia ta Megala – Διονύσια τὰ Μεγάλα&quot;) was the urban part of the festival, possibly established during the tyranny of Peisistratus in the 6th century BC . This festival was held probably from the 10th to the 16th of the month Elaphebolion (the lunar month straddling the vernal equinox, i.e., Mar.-Apr in the solar calendar), three months after the rural Dionysia, probably to celebrate the end of winter and the harvesting of the year&#x27;s crops. According to tradition, the festival was established after Eleutherae, a town on the border between Attica and Boeotia, had chosen to become part of Attica. The Eleuthereans brought a statue of Dionysus to Athens, which was initially rejected by the Athenians. Dionysus then punished the Athenians with a plague affecting the male genitalia, which was cured when the Athenians accepted the cult of Dionysus. This was recalled each year by a procession of citizens carrying &quot;phalloi&quot;.

The urban festival was a relatively recent invention. This ceremony fell under the auspices of the Archons of Athens, rather than the basileus, to whom religious festivals were given when the office of archon was created in the 7th century BC.

===&quot;Pompe&quot; and &quot;Proagon&quot;===
The archon prepared for the City Dionysia as soon as he was elected, by choosing his two &quot;páredroi&quot; (πάρεδροι, &quot;reeves&quot;, literally: &quot;by the chair&quot;) and ten &quot;epimelētai&quot; (ἐπιμεληταί, &quot;curators&quot;) to help organize the festival. On the first day of the festival, the &quot;pompē&quot; (&quot;pomp&quot;, &quot;procession&quot;) was held, in which citizens, metics, and representatives from Athenian colonies marched to the Theatre of Dionysus on the southern slope of the Acropolis, carrying the wooden statue of Dionysus Eleuthereus, the &quot;leading&quot; or &quot;eisagōgē&quot; (εἰσαγωγή, &quot;introduction&quot;). As with the Rural Dionysia, they also carried phalloi, made of wood or bronze, aloft on poles, and a cart pulled a much larger phallus. Basket-carriers and water and wine-carriers participated in the &quot;pompe&quot; here, as in the Rural Dionysia.

During the height of the Athenian Empire in the mid-5th century BC, various gifts and weapons showcasing Athens&#x27; strength were carried as well. Also included in the procession were bulls to be sacrificed in the theatre. The most conspicuous members of the procession were the &quot;chorēgoí&quot; (χορηγοί, &quot;sponsors&quot;, literally: &quot;chorus leaders&quot;), who were dressed in the most expensive and ornate clothing. After the &quot;pompē&quot;, the &quot;chorēgoí&quot; led their choruses in the dithyrambic competitions. These were extremely competitive, and the best flute players and celebrity poets (such as Simonides and Pindar) offered their musical and lyrical services. After these competitions, the bulls were sacrificed, and a feast was held for all the citizens of Athens. A second procession, the &quot;kōmos&quot; (κῶμος), occurred afterwards, which was most likely a drunken revelry through the streets.

The next day, the playwrights announced the titles of the plays to be performed, and judges were selected by lot: the &quot;proagōn&quot; (προαγών, &quot;pre-contest&quot;). It is unknown where the &quot;proagōn&quot; originally took place, but after the mid-5th century BC, it was held in the Odeon of Pericles on the foot of Acropolis. The &quot;proagōn&quot; was also used to give praise to notable citizens, or often foreigners, who had served Athens in some beneficial way during the year. During the Peloponnesian War, orphaned children of those who had been killed in battle were also paraded in the Odeon, possibly to honour their fathers. The &quot;proagōn&quot; could be used for other announcements as well; in 406 BC the death of the playwright Euripides was announced there.

===Dramatic performances===
Following the &quot;pompe&quot;, the Theatre of Dionysus was purified by the sacrifice of a bull. According to tradition, the first performance of tragedy at the Dionysia was by the playwright and actor Thespis (from whom we take the word &quot;&quot;) in 534 BC. His award was reportedly a goat, a common symbol for Dionysus, and this &quot;prize&quot; possibly suggests the origin of the word &quot;tragedy&quot; (which means &quot;goat-song&quot;).

During the fifth century BC, five days of the festival were set aside for performance, though scholars disagree exactly what was presented each day. At least three full days were devoted to tragic plays, and each of three playwrights presented his set of three tragedies and one satyr play on the successive days. Most of the extant Greek tragedies, including those of Aeschylus, Euripides, and Sophocles, were performed at the Theatre of Dionysus. The archons, &quot;epimeletai&quot;, and judges (&quot;agonothetai – ἀγωνοθἐται&quot;) watched from the front row.

The other two days of the festival were likely devoted to dithyrambic contests until 487/6 BC, when comic poets were officially admitted to the agons and eligible for their own prizes. Each of five comic writers presented a single play (except during the Peloponnesian War, when only three plays were performed), though it is unknown whether they were performed continuously on one day, or over the course of the five-day festival. Until 449 BC, only dramatic works were awarded prizes in the agon, but after that time, actors also became eligible for recognition. It was considered a great honour to win the comedic prize at the City Dionysia, despite the belief that comedies were of secondary importance. The Lenaia festival, held earlier in the year, featured comedy more prominently and officially recognized comic performances with prizes in 442 BC.

Impressive tragic output continued without pause through the first three quarters of the fourth century BC, and some scholars consider this time a continuation of the classical period. Though much of the work of this period is either lost or forgotten, it is considered to owe a great debt to the playwright Euripides. His plays, along with other fifth-century BC writers, were often re-staged during this period. At least one revival was presented each year at City Dionysia. It has been suggested that audiences may have preferred to see well-known plays re-staged, rather than financially support new plays of questionable quality; or alternately, that revivals represented a nostalgia for the glory of Athens from before the devastation of the Peloponnesian War. Nevertheless, plays continued to be written and performed until the 2nd century BC, when new works of both comedy and tragedy seem to have been eliminated. After that point drama continued to be produced, but prizes were awarded to wealthy producers and famous actors rather than the long-dead playwrights whose work was being performed.

Another procession and celebration was held on the final day, when the judges chose the winners of the tragedy and comedy performances. The winning playwrights were awarded a wreath of ivy.

==Known winners of the City Dionysia==

Most of our knowledge of the winners of the City Dionysia and the Lenaea festival comes from a series of damaged inscriptions referred to as the Fasti (&quot;IG&quot; II2 2318), the &quot;Didascaliae&quot; (&quot;IG&quot; II2 2319-24) and the Victors Lists (&quot;IG&quot; II2 2325).

==Modern adaptations==
The festival has inspired people through the present day, as a celebration of humanity (see Nietzsche&#x27;s or Aristotle&#x27;s take) and an exposition of culture. The University of Houston&#x27;s Center for Creative works produces and performs an adaptation each spring. The purpose of the enterprise is to educate and entertain, and adaptations occasionally go beyond Greek theater for inspiration (for example, the 2013 Spring adaptation of the Iliad, titled &quot;Ilium&quot;). Collaborators flock from all over America and the productions themselves are quite popular, selling out on all ticketed venues.

The New York Classical Club, through Fordham University&#x27;s Classics Department, stages a competition every April wherein groups of high school students produce unique adaptations of the same play. The competition aims to engage the themes and style of the ancient plays with renewed vigor and an accessible, thought provoking frame. Several notable schools from the area participate, including Stuyvesant and Regis. Adaptations are cut to twenty minutes, and source plays have included &quot;The Bacchae&quot; by Euripides and the entire collection of Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;.

Educational charity The Iris Project holds a Dionysia Festival every year with Year Eight students from Cheney School, who adapt and modernise Aristophanes plays. The festival is usually hosted at Corpus Christi College, Oxford.

Modern followers of Hellenism celebrate Dionysia as a holiday and use a version of the Attic calendar to calculate it.

<text>A medical school is a tertiary educational institution, professional school, or forms a part of such an institution, that teaches medicine, and awards a professional degree for physicians. Such medical degrees include the Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery (MBBS, MBChB, MBBCh, BMBS), Master of Medicine (MM, MMed), Doctor of Medicine (MD), or Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine (DO). Many medical schools offer additional degrees, such as a Doctor of Philosophy (PhD), master&#x27;s degree (MSc) or other post-secondary education.

Medical schools can also carry out medical research and operate teaching hospitals. Around the world, criteria, structure, teaching methodology, and nature of medical programs offered at medical schools vary considerably. Medical schools are often highly competitive, using standardized entrance examinations, as well as grade point averages and leadership roles, to narrow the selection criteria for candidates.
In most countries, the study of medicine is completed as an undergraduate degree not requiring prerequisite undergraduate coursework. However, an increasing number of places are emerging for graduate entrants who have completed an undergraduate degree including some required courses. In the United States and Canada, almost all medical degrees are second-entry degrees, and require several years of previous study at the university level.

Medical degrees are awarded to medical students after the completion of their degree program, which typically lasts five or more years for the undergraduate model and four years for the graduate model. Many modern medical schools integrate clinical education with basic sciences from the beginning of the curriculum (e.g.). More traditional curricula are usually divided into preclinical and clinical blocks. In preclinical sciences, students study subjects such as biochemistry, genetics, pharmacology, pathology, anatomy, physiology and medical microbiology, among others. Subsequent clinical rotations usually include internal medicine, general surgery, pediatrics, psychiatry, and obstetrics and gynecology, among others.

Although medical schools confer upon graduates a medical degree, a physician typically may not legally practice medicine until licensed by the local government authority. Licensing may also require passing a test, undergoing a criminal background check, checking references, paying a fee, and undergoing several years of postgraduate training. Medical schools are regulated by each country and appear in the World Directory of Medical Schools which was formed by the merger of the AVICENNA Directory for Medicine and the FAIMER International Medical Education Directory.

== Africa ==
By 2005 there were more than 100 medical schools across Africa, most of which had been established after 1970.

=== Ghana ===
There are seven medical schools in Ghana: The University of Ghana Medical School in Accra, the KNUST School of Medical Sciences in Kumasi, University for Development Studies School of Medicine in Tamale, University of Cape Coast Medical School and the University of Allied Health Sciences in Ho, Volta Region, the private Accra College of Medicine, and Family Health University College(Accra), another private medical school.
Basic Medical education lasts 6 years in all medical schools. Entry into these medical schools is highly competitive and it is usually based on successful completion of the Senior High School Examinations. The University of Ghana Medical School and the University of Cape Coast have, however, introduced a graduate entry medical program to admit students with mainly science-related degrees into a 4-year medical school program (four and half years for the University of Cape Coast).

Students graduating from any of these medical schools get the MBChB degree and the title &quot;Dr&quot;. For the first 3 years, students are awarded BSc in the field of Medical Sciences from the University of Ghana medical school; and Human biology for KNUST and UDS medical schools.
The University of Ghana Medical School and KNUST School of Medical Sciences in Kumasi use a traditional medical education model whiles the University for Development Studies School of Medicine and School of Medical science of the University of Cape Coast use the problem-based learning model.

Medical graduates are then registered provisionally with the Medical and Dental Council (MDC) of Ghana as House Officers (Interns). Upon completion of the mandatory 2-year housemanship, these medical doctors are permanently registered with the MDC and can practice as medical officers (General Practitioners) anywhere in the country. The housemanship training is done only in hospitals accredited for such purposes by the Medical and Dental Council of Ghana.

Following the permanent registration with the Medical and Dental Council, doctors can specialize in any of the various fields that is organized by either the West African College of Physicians and Surgeons or the Ghana College of Physician and Surgeons.

Medical officers are also sometimes hired by the Ghana Health Service to work in the District/Rural areas as Primary Care Physicians.

===Kenya===
In Kenya, medical schools are faculties of a university. Medical education lasts for 6 years after which the student graduates with an undergraduate (MBChB) degree. This is followed by a mandatory 12-month full-time internship at an approved hospital after which one applies for registration with the Kenya Medical Practitioners and Dentists Board if they intend to practice medicine in the country. The first two years of medical school cover the basic medical (preclinical) sciences while the last four years are focused on the clinical sciences and internship.

Completion of formal specialty training in Kenya is followed by two years of supervised clinical work before one can apply for recognition as a specialist, in their respective field, by the medical board.

There are no medical school entry examinations or interviews and admission is based on the student&#x27;s performance in the high school exit examination (Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education - KCSE). Students who took the AS Level or the SAT can also apply but there is a very strict quota limiting the number of students that get accepted into public universities. This quota does not apply to private universities.

===Nigeria===
There are several medical schools in Nigeria. Entrance into these schools is highly competitive. Candidates graduating from high school must attain high scores on the West African Examination Council&#x27;s (WAEC) Senior School Certificate Exam (SSCE/GCE) and high scores in five subjects (Physics, Mathematics, English, Chemistry, and Biology) in the University Matriculation Examination (UME). Students undergo rigorous training for 6 years and culminate with a Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery (MBBS/MBChB). The undergraduate program is six years and one year of work experience in government hospitals. After medical school, graduates are mandated to spend one year of housemanship (internship) and one year of community service before they are eligible to be fully licensed by the Medical and Dental Council.
Candidates are required to score at least 280 in the UME. Though this score may vary due to different performances per year and it also depends on the college standards.

===South Africa===
There are eleven medical schools in South Africa, each under the auspices of a public university. As the country is a former British colony, most institutions follow the British-based undergraduate method of instruction, admitting students directly from high school into 6 or 5-year programs. Some universities such as the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg have started offering post-graduate medical degrees that run concurrently with their undergraduate programs. In this instance, a student having completed an appropriate undergraduate degree with basic sciences can enter into a four-year postgraduate program.

South African medical schools award the MB ChB degree, except the University of the Witwatersrand, which styles its degree MB BCh. Some universities allow students to earn an intercalated degree, completing a BSc (Medical) with an additional year of study after the second or third year of the MBChB. The University of Cape Town, in particular, has spearheaded a recent effort to increase the level of medical research training and exposure of medical students through an Intercalated Honours Programme, with the option to extend this to a PhD.

Following successful completion of study, all South African medical graduates must complete a two-year internship as well as a further year of community service in order to register with the Health Professions Council and practice as a doctor in the country.

Specialisation is usually a five- to seven-year training process (depending on the specialty) requiring registering as a medical registrar attached to an academic clinical department in a large teaching hospital with appropriate examinations. The specialist qualification may be conferred as a Fellowship by the independent Colleges of Medicine of South Africa (CMSA), following British tradition, or as a Magisterial degree by the university (usually the M Med, Master of Medicine, degree). The Medical schools and the CMSA also offer Higher Diplomas in many fields. Research degrees are the MMed and PhD or MD, depending on the university.

Medical students from all over the world come to South Africa to gain practical experience in the country&#x27;s many teaching hospitals and rural clinics. The language of instruction is English but a few indigenous languages are studied briefly. The University of the Free State has a parallel medium policy, meaning all English classes are also presented in Afrikaans, therefore students who choose to study in Afrikaans, do so separately from the English class.

===Sudan===
In Sudan, a medical school is a faculty of a university. Medical school is usually 5–6 years, and by the end of the 5–6 years, the students acquire a bachelor&#x27;s degree in Medicine and Surgery. Post graduating there is a mandatory one-year full-time internship at one of the universities or Government Teaching hospitals in the four major Specialty in 3 months rotation, then a license is issued after a written exam conducted by the Sudan medical council (SMC).

During the first 3–4 years the curriculum is completed, and throughout the next 2 years it is repeated with clinical training. Students with high grades in high school are accepted for free in Government Universities. Private faculty accept low grades than governmental faculty but their grades still high. Students who take foreign examinations other than the Sudanese High School Examination are also accepted in Universities, students taking IGCSE/SATs and other Arabian countries. 
All medical students who want to be enrolled in an internship program should undergo registration under the Sudanese Medical Council. Postgraduate training is conducted by Sudan medical specialisation board (SMSB) and the degree obtained is medical doctor (MD). The duration of training varies from 4–6 years depend on the scientific Council of the specific speciality.

===Tanzania===
In Tanzania, medical school is a school within a university or can be an independent university dealing with health related courses only affiliated with a large sized hospital. Medical education lasts for 5 years after which the student graduates with an undergraduate (MD) degree. This is followed by a mandatory 12-month full-time internship at an approved hospital after which one applies for registration with the Medical Council of Tanzania (MCT) if they intend to practice medicine in the country. The first two years of medical school cover the Bio medical sciences or simply basic (pre-clinical) sciences while the last three years are focused on the clinical sciences.

There are no medical school entry examinations or interviews and admission is based on students&#x27; performance in the high school exit examination (Advanced Certificate of Secondary Education Examination - ACSEE). Alternatively are student who took diploma in clinical medicine with an average of G.P.A 3.5 distinction who have very few seats.

===Uganda===

, there are nine accredited medical schools in Uganda. Training leading to the award of the degree of Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery (MBChB) lasts five years, if there are no re-takes. After graduating, a year of internship in a hospital designated for that purpose, under the supervision of a specialist in that discipline is required before an unrestricted license to practice medicine and surgery is granted by the Uganda Medical and Dental Practitioners Council (UMDPC).

There is Postgraduate training such as the degree of Master of Medicine (MMed) which is a three-year programme, available at Makerere University School of Medicine in several disciplines. Makerere University School of Public Health, offers the degree of Master of Public Health (MPH) following a 22-month period of study, which includes field work.

===Zimbabwe===
In Zimbabwe, there are three medical schools is offering Medical degrees. For undergrads, these are University of Zimbabwe - College of Health Sciences {MBChB}, National University of Science and Technology (NUST) Medical school {MBBS} and Midlands State University (MSU) {MBChB}. Only UZ is offering postgrad degrees in the Medical faculty.

Training lasts years. The curriculum is as follows:
* Part 1 (1 year) – Biochemistry, Communication Skills for Academic Purposes, Anatomy, Physiology and Behavioral Sciences. Professional exams are written in the first two and failure to attain a pass in Biochemistry warranties a repeat of first year.
* Part 2 (1 year) – Communication Skills for Professional Purposes, Anatomy, Physiology, Behavioral Sciences. Professional exams are written at the end of second year and failure to attain a passmark in any of the last three courses on the list warranties a repeat of the year. Communication Skills can be carried to the next year, but the student should pass the course before graduation.
* Part 3 (1.5 years) – Pathology (Histopathology), Medical Microbiology, Chemical Pathology, Hematology, Forensic Pathology, Immunology and Toxicology. A professional exam is written at the end of the third year and the student has to pass to proceed. There are also surgery and medicine rotations during the year. Also, the students cover most of the basic Pharmacology during the third stage of the degrees.
* Part 4 (1 year) – Community Medicine, Psychiatry and Clinical Pharmacology
* Part 5 (1 year) – Medicine, Surgery, Obstetrics and Gynecology, Pediatrics

Internships are two years in duration, with the first year spent in medicine and surgery and the second year doing pediatrics, anesthesia/psychiatry and obstetrics and gynecology. Thereafter one can apply for MMED at the university which last 4–5 years depending on specialty. Currently no subspecialist education is available.

==Asia and Oceania==
===Australia===

Historically, Australian medical schools have followed the British tradition by conferring the degrees of Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery (MBBS) to its graduates whilst reserving the title of Doctor of Medicine (MD) for their research training degree, analogous to the PhD, or for their honorary doctorates. Although the majority of Australian MBBS degrees have been graduate programs since the 1990s, under the previous Australian Qualifications Framework (AQF) they remained categorised as Level 7 Bachelor degrees together with other undergraduate programs.

The latest version of the AQF includes the new category of Level 9 Master&#x27;s (Extended) degrees which permits the use of the term &#x27;Doctor&#x27; in the styling of the degree title of relevant professional programs. As a result, various Australian medical schools have replaced their MBBS degrees with the MD to resolve the previous anomalous nomenclature. With the introduction of the Master&#x27;s level MD, universities have also renamed their previous medical research doctorates. The University of Melbourne was the first to introduce the MD in 2011 as a basic medical degree, and has renamed its research degree to Doctor of Medical Science (DMedSc).

===Bangladesh===

In Bangladesh, admission to medical colleges is organized by the Governing Body of University of Dhaka. A single admission test is held for government and private colleges. Due to the highly competitive nature of these exams, the total number of applicants across the country is around 78 times the number of students accepted. Admission is based on the entrance examination, as well as students&#x27; individual academic records.

The entrance examination has a time limit of one hour. 100 marks are allocated based on objective questions, in which the mark allocation is distributed between a variety of subjects. Biology questions carry 30 marks, Chemistry carries 25, Physics carries 20, English carries 15, and general knowledge carries 10.

Additionally, students&#x27; previous SSC (Secondary School Certificate) scores carry up to 75 and HSC (Higher Secondary School Certificate) scores carry up to 125 marks towards the overall examination result.

English students prepare themselves for the admission exam ahead of time. This is because as the GCSE and A-Level exams do not cover parts of the Bangladesh syllabus.

The undergraduate program consists of five years study, followed by a one-year internship. The degrees granted are Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery (MBBS). Further postgraduate qualifications may be obtained in the form of Diplomas or Degrees (MS or MD), MPhil and FCPS (Fellowship of the College of Physicians and Surgeons).

The University of Dhaka launched a new BSc in &quot;Radiology and Imaging Technology,&quot; offering 30 students the opportunity to contribute towards their entrance exam grade. For students who have passed the HSC, this course contributes towards 25% of the mark. The course contributes up to 75% for Diploma-holding students. The duration of the course is four years (plus 12 weeks for project submission). The course covers a variety of topics, including behavioural science, radiological ethics, imaging physics and general procedure.

===Cambodia===
After six years of general medical education (a foundation year + 5 years), all students will graduate with a Bachelor of Medical Sciences (BMedSc) (&quot;បរិញ្ញាប័ត្រ វិទ្យាសាស្រ្តវេជ្ជសាស្ត្រ&quot;). This degree does not allow graduates to work independently as Physician, but it is possible for those who wish to continue to master&#x27;s degrees in other fields relating to medical sciences such as Public Health, Epidemiology, Biomedical Science, Nutrition.

Medical graduates, who wish to be fully qualified as physicians or specialists must meet these conditions:

* General Practitioner&#x27;s (GP) course is 8 years (BMedSc + 2-year internship). Clinical rotation in the internship is modulated within 4 main disciplines (general medicine, surgery, gynecology, pediatrics). The medical degree awarded is the Doctor of Medicine (MD) (&quot;សញ្ញាប័ត្រ វេជ្ជបណ្ឌិត&quot;), equivalent to a master&#x27;s degree.
* After graduating with BMedSc; any students, who wishes to enter Residency Training Programs, are required to sit for a rigorous and Entrance Exam. The duration of residency programs lasts from 3 to 4 years after BMedSc (BMedSc + 3–4 years of specialization). Once the graduates, after successful defense of their practicum thesis, are officially awarded the Degree of Specialized Doctor (MD-with specialization) (&quot;សញ្ញាប័ត្រវេជ្ជបណ្ឌិតឯកទេស&quot;) &quot;Professional Doctorate&quot;.

All Medical graduates must complete a thesis defense and pass the national exit exam (&quot;ប្រឡងចេញថ្នាក់ជាតិក្នុងវិស័យសុខាភិបាល&quot;) to become a GP or a medical or surgical specialist.

===China===
Medical education is normally a five-year Bachelor degree, including a one-year internship (or clinical rotation, during which students are actively involved in patient care) before the final degree is awarded. Although some medical schools run three-year programs, hospitals tend to recruit physicians who have graduated from five-year programs. Students who graduate from medical school must work 1–3 years in a university-affiliated hospital, after which the student is eligible to take the National Medical Licensing Examination (NMLE) for physician certification, which is conducted by the National Medical Examination Center (NMEC). Candidates who pass are certified as physicians by the Ministry of Health. Clinical specialization usually involves a two-or three-year Master degree. Acceptance is based on the national entrance examination used for all universities. In all over China, the Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery (MBBS) Degree courses have been always taught in Chinese medium. There are a few colleges that teach in English and accept foreign medical students. Some of those universities have increased their course duration to 6 years. The degree conferred is known as Bachelor of Clinical Medicine (BCM).

===Fiji===

Medical education is normally a six-year Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery degree, including a one-year of trainee internship (or clinical rotation, during which students are actively involved in patient care) before the final degree is awarded. Students who graduate from medical school must complete an year of graduate training in a government hospital, after which they are eligible to practice medicine.

There are two accredited medical schools in Fiji:
*Fiji National University, College of Medicine, Nursing and Health Sciences (Formerly, Fiji School of Medicine).
*University of Fiji, Umanand Prasad School Medicine and Health Sciences.

Clinical specialization usually involves a three-year master&#x27;s degree. Acceptance into Medical School is based on the Fiji Year 13 Certificate Examination used for all universities. In all over Fiji, the Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery (MBBS) Degree courses have been always taught in English medium.

===Hong Kong===
In Hong Kong, medical programmes are bachelor&#x27;s degrees with a usual duration of six years, leading to the degrees of Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery. Students are eligible upon graduating secondary school, and sitting the local Hong Kong Diploma of Secondary Education Examination (HKDSE) (JUPAS candidates) or other international examinations such as the International Baccalaureate and GCE A-Level (non-JUPAS candidates).

There are two medical schools in Hong Kong:

* Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, University of Hong Kong (HKU) 
* Faculty of Medicine, The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK)

Both medical faculties are also the sole two institutes offering pharmacy programmes. Meanwhile, other healthcare programmes (like nursing) can also be found in universities which do not host a medical faculty.

The CUHK Faculty of Medicine offers the Dynamic Year 2 (DY2) option, which allows high-achieving students who have acquired a certain minimum level in relevant academic qualifications to be admitted directly to Year 2.

Prior to the introduction of the HKDSE in 2012, both medical programmes had a duration of five years for students taking the Hong Kong Advanced Level Examination (HKALE).

Admission to a medical program is highly competitive as the number of intakes each year is limited. As of 2024, the first year intake of each program is 295 (590 in total). Hence, candidates need to attain an excellent examination result and good performance in interviews. The schools put a great emphasis on students&#x27; languages (both Chinese and English) and communication skills as they need to communicate with other healthcare professionals and patients or their families in the future.

During their studies at the medical schools, students need to accumulate enough clinical practicing hours in addition before their graduation.

To obtain full registration as registered medical practitioners, medical graduates must undertake and complete at least one year of supervised practice in approved hospitals, generally known as an internship, with satisfactory performance. During this year, interns (house officers) are rotated to four specialties (medicine, surgery, and two of the following: obstetrics and gynaecology, paediatrics, orthopaedics and traumatology, emergency medicine, psychiatry, and ophthalmology). Each of them lasts three months. There is no work hour limit in Hong Kong and interns are expected to work 80–100 hours per week.

===India===

In India, admission to medical colleges is organized by the central government by NTA (National Testing Agency) through tests known as NEET entrance examination. Students who have successfully completed their 10+2 (Physics, Chemistry and Biology Marks are considered and PCB is mandatory) education (higher secondary school) can appear for the tests the same year.

The NEET-UG (National Eligibility cum Entrance Test) for filling up of 15% of total MBBS seats in India, conducted by NTA (National Testing Agency) 1 time in a year in the month of May intakes about only 65,000 students out of a total applicants of over 15,00,000. The Supreme Court Of India has mandated the necessity of entrance examination based upon multiple choice questions and negative marking for wrong answers with subsequent merit over 50% for selection into MBBS as well as higher medical education. The entrance exams are highly competitive.

The graduate program consists of three professionals consisting of 9 semesters, followed by one-year internship (rotating housemanship). The degree granted is Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery (MBBS) of five years and six months.

The graduate degree of MBBS is divided into three professionals, with each professional ending with a professional exam conducted by the university (a single university may have up to dozens of medical colleges offering various graduate/post-graduate/post-doctoral degrees). After clearing this the student moves into the next professional. Each professional exam consists of a theory exam and a practical exam conducted not only by the same college but also external examiners. The exams are tough and many students are unable to clear them, thereby prolonging their degree time. The first professional is for 1 year and includes preclinical subjects, anatomy, physiology and biochemistry. The second professional is for years and has subjects pathology, pharmacology, microbiology (including immunology) and forensic medicine. Clinical exposure starts in the second professional. The third professional is divided into two parts. Part 1 consists of ophthalmology, ENT, and PSM (preventive and social medicine) and part 2 consists of general-medicine (including dermatology, psychiatry as short subjects), general surgery (including radiology, anaesthesiology and orthopaedics as short subjects) and pediatrics and gynaecology and obstetrics. This is followed by one-year of internship (house-surgeonship). After internship, the degree of MBBS is awarded by the respective university. Some states have made rural service compulsory for a certain period of time after MBBS.

Selection for higher medical education is through entrance examinations as mandated by the Supreme Court Of India. Further postgraduate qualifications may be obtained as Post-graduate Diploma of two years residency or Doctoral Degree (MS: Master of Surgery, or MD) of three years of residency under the aegis of the Medical Council of India. The MD/MS seats in India are filled up through NEET PG Examination conducted by the National Board of Examinations (NBE) under the supervision of the Directorate General Of Health Services. Theses/Dissertations are mandatory to be submitted and cleared by university along with examinations (written and clinicals) to obtain MD/MS degree. Further sub-speciality post-doctoral qualification (DM - Doctorate of Medicine, or MCh - Magister of Chirurgery) of three years of residency followed by university examinations may also be obtained.

PG (post-graduate) qualification is equivalent to MD/MS, consisting of two/three-years residency after MBBS. A PG diploma may also be obtained through the National Board of Examinations (NBE), which also offers three-years residency for sub-specialisation. All degrees by NBE are called DNB (Diplomate of National Board). DNB&#x27;s are awarded only after clearance of theses/dissertations and examinations. DNBs equivalent to DM/MCh have to clear examinations mandatorily.

===Indonesia===
In Indonesia, high school graduates who aspires to enroll in public medical schools must apply to medicine undergraduate program available in certain public universities. Most common ways to apply to public universities are SNBP (Achievement-based National Selection, , organized without test, using high school evaluation reports) and SNBT (Test-Based National Selection, , organized with test), both administered by Institution of Higher Education Admissions Test under The Indonesian Ministry of Education, Culture, Research, and Technology. Another way with fewer places are available through entrance exam conducted autonomously by each university (known as independent admission). These admissions are highly competitive for medicine, especially in prestigious institutions such as University of Indonesia in Jakarta, Airlangga University in Surabaya, and Gadjah Mada University in Yogyakarta. For private medical schools, almost all places offer seats through independently run admission tests.

The standard Indonesian medical school curriculum is six years long. The four years long undergraduate program is composed mainly of classroom education, continued with the last two years in professional program which primarily includes rotations in clinical settings where students learn patient care firsthand. If they pass the undergraduate program, they will be granted the title &quot;S.Ked&quot; (Bachelor of Medicine) and if they finish the professional program and pass the national examination arranged by IDI (Indonesian Medical Association) they will become general physician and be assigned the prefix, &quot;dr. (doctor)&quot;.

Upon graduation, a physician planning to become a specialist in a specific field of medicine must complete a residency, which is a supervised training with periods ranging from three to four years. A physician who sub-specializes or who desires more supervised experience may complete a fellowship, which is an additional one to three years of supervised training in his/her area of expertise.

===Japan===

In Japan, medical schools are faculties of universities and thus they are undergraduate programs that generally last for six years. Admission is based on an exam taken at the end of high school and an entrance exam at the university itself, which is the most competitive.

Medical students study Liberal Arts and Sciences for the first 1–2 years, which include Physics, Mathematics, Chemistry, and Foreign Languages, followed by 2 years of Basic Medicine (Anatomy, Physiology, Pharmacology, Immunology), Clinical Medicine, Public health, and Forensics.

Medical students train at the University Hospital for the last two years. Clinical training is a part of the curriculum. Upon completion of the graduation examination, students are awarded an MD Medical graduates are titled as Doctor, as are PhD holders. The university does have an MD/PhD program that enables Doctors of Medicine to become PhD holders, as well.

At the end, Medical students take the National Medical License examination and, if they pass it, become a Physician and register in the record in the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare. The scope of this exam encompasses every aspect of medicine.

===Kyrgyzstan===
In Kyrgyzstan, the government university Kyrgyz State Medical Academy offers 6 years duration undergraduate (bachelor&#x27;s degree) program whereas the other institutions mostly private such as the International School of Medicine at the International University of Kyrgyzstan offers a five-year medical program, with a requisite for English knowledge, that is recognized by the World Health Organization, the General Medical Council, and UNESCO. The medical school is also partnered with the University of South Florida School of Medicine, the University of Heidelberg (Germany), the Novosibirsk Medical University (Russia), and the University of Sharjah (UAE).

Other medical schools located in Kyrgyzstan include the 5 years duration MD/MBBS undergraduate degree program at International University of Science and Business or Mezhdunarodnyy Universitet Nauki i Biznesa, Kyrgyzstan others are the Asian Medical Institute, Kyrgyzstan and the Medical Institute, Osh State University.

===Malaysia===

In Malaysia, getting into medical school is regarded as difficult, due to high fees and a rigorous selection process. Some new medical schools do offer a foundation in medicine course before admission into a full-time medical programme. Most government, and some private medical schools offer MD, and others mostly offer MBBS degrees.

===Myanmar===
As of 2015, there are six medical institutions in Myanmar - UM 1, UM 2, DSMA, UM Mdy, UM Mgy and the newly established UMTG.
Myanmar medical schools are government-funded and require Myanmar citizenship for eligibility. No private medical school exist at this moment. In Myanmar, admission to medical colleges is organized under the Department of Health Science, which is the branch of Ministry of Health and Sport of Myanmar.

A student can join one of the six medical universities of Myanmar if he gets the highest scores in the science combination of the matriculation examination. This exam is highly competitive. Entrance is solely based on this examination and academic records have very minor consequences on an application. The undergraduate program is five years plus one year for work experience in government hospitals. After medical school, Myanmar medical graduates are under contract to spend one year of internship and three years of tenure in rural areas before they are eligible for most residency positions. The degree granted is Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery (MBBS). Further postgraduate qualifications may be obtained as a degree (MMedSc) and (DrMedSc).

===Nepal===

As of 2020, Nepal had 23 medical schools (6 public and 17 private).
 Medical studies start at undergraduate level and are taught by mostly Indian and Nepalese faculty. Studies typically take four and a half years followed by a one-year internship. Graduates are conferred the MBBS degree. Scholarships are provided to between 10 and 20% of students. Upon graduation, scholarship students have to serve in health facilities in rural Nepal for two years after graduation. In turn, self financing students tend to come from upper socioeconomic status due to the high cost of medical education in Nepal

There are four main medical bodies in Nepal:
* Tribhuvan University (own college: Institute of Medicine, Maharajgunj, affiliated colleges: National Medical College, Janaki Medical College, Universal College of Medical Sciences, Gandaki Medical College, Chitwan Medical College, Kist Medical College, Nepal Army Institute of Health Science)
* Kathmandu University (own college: Kathmandu University School of Medical Sciences (KUSMS), Affiliated colleges: Manipal College of Medical Sciences, Kathmandu Medical College, Nepal Medical College, Nepalgunj Medical College, College of Medical Sciences, Nobel Medical College, Lumbini Medical College, Birat Medical College, Devdaha Medical College)
* B.P. Koirala Institute of Health Sciences.
* Patan Academy of Health Sciences

The Medical Education Commission was established in 2017 with the goal of improving the quality of medical education in Nepal. Nepal Medical Council (NMC) was established in 2020 with the primary role of registering qualified doctors.

===New Zealand===

New Zealand medical programs are undergraduate-entry programs of six years duration. Students are considered for acceptance only after a year of undergraduate basic sciences or, as alternative, following the completion of a bachelor&#x27;s degree. There are two main medical schools in New Zealand: the University of Auckland and the University of Otago. Each of these has subsidiary medical schools such as Otago&#x27;s Wellington School of Medicine and Health Sciences and Auckland&#x27;s Waikato Clinical School.

The first year of the medical degree is the basic sciences year, which comprises study in chemistry, biology, physics, and biochemistry as well as population health and behavioural sciences. The following two years are spent studying human organ systems and pathological processes in more detail as well as professional and communication development. Toward the end of the third year, students begin direct contact with patients in hospital settings.

The clinical years begin fully at the beginning of year 4, where students rotate through various areas of general clinical medicine with rotation times varying from between two and six weeks. Year 5 continues this pattern, focusing more on specialized areas of medicine and surgery. Final medical school exams (exit exams) are actually held at the end of year 5, which is different from most other countries, where final exams are held near the very end of the medical degree. Final exams must be passed before the student is allowed to enter year 6.

The final year (Year 6) of medical school is known as the &quot;Trainee Intern&quot; year, wherein a student is known as a &quot;Trainee Intern&quot; (commonly referred to in the hospitals as a &quot;T.I.&quot;). Trainee interns repeat most rotations undertaken in years 4 and 5 but at a higher level of involvement and responsibility for patient care. Trainee interns receive a stipend grant from the New Zealand government (not applicable for international students). At the current time, this is $NZ 26,756/year (about $US 18,500). Trainee interns have responsibility under supervision for the care of about one-third the patient workload of a junior doctor. However, all prescriptions and most other orders (e.g., radiology requests and charting of IV fluids) made by trainee interns must be countersigned by a registered doctor.

New Zealand medical schools currently award the degrees of Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery (MBChB).

Upon completion of the sixth year, students go on to become &quot;House Officers,&quot; also known as &quot;House Surgeons&quot; for 1–2 years where they rotate through specialities in the first year and then begin to narrow down to what they&#x27;d like to do for speciality training in the second year. After 2 years of house officer work they apply to get into a training scheme and start to train towards the speciality.

===Philippines===

The Dominicans, under the Spanish Government, established the oldest medical school in the Philippines in 1871, known as the Faculty of Medicine and Surgery (at that time was one with the University of Santo Tomas Faculty of Pharmacy, also considered the oldest pharmacy school in the Philippines) of the Pontifical and Royal University of Santo Tomas in Intramuros, Manila.

Medical education in the Philippines became widespread under the American administration. The Americans, led by the insular government&#x27;s Secretary of the Interior, Dean Worcester, built the University of the Philippines College of Medicine and Surgery in 1905. By 1909, nursing instruction was also begun at the Philippine Normal School.

At present there are a number of medical schools in the Philippines, notable examples include the University of the Philippines College of Medicine, Our Lady of Fatima University, Far Eastern University – Nicanor Reyes Medical Foundation, Saint Louis University International School of Medicine, De La Salle Medical and Health Sciences Institute, University of Santo Tomas Faculty of Medicine and Surgery, Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Maynila, UERMMMC College of Medicine, Cebu Doctors&#x27; University, Cebu Institute of Medicine, Southwestern University - Matias H. Aznar Memorial College of Medicine Inc., West Visayas State University in Iloilo City, and University of Northern Philippines in Vigan.

In 1994, the Ateneo de Zamboanga University-School of Medicine, then known as Zamboanga Medical School Foundation was established. By 2003, it became the first medical school in the country to offer a double degree program leading to the degrees Doctor of Medicine and Master of Public Health.

Any college graduate may apply for medical school given that they satisfy the requirements set by the institutions. There is also a test known as the National Medical Admission Test or NMAT. Scores are given on a percentile basis and a high ranking is a must to enter the top medical schools in the country.

In most institutions, medical education lasts for four years. Basic subjects are taken up in the first and second years, while clinical sciences are studied in the second and third years. In their fourth year, students rotate in the various hospital departments, spending up to two months each in the fields of internal medicine, surgery, obstetrics and gynecology, and pediatrics, and several weeks in the other specialties. After this, students graduate with a Doctorate in Medicine and apply for postgraduate internship (PGI) in an accredited hospital of their choice. After PGI, the student is eligible to take the Medical Licensure Examination. Passing the examinations confers the right to practice medicine as well as to apply in a Residency Training Program.

===Singapore===
There are three medical schools in Singapore. Two of them offer undergraduate (5 years degree) and the other offers postgraduate (4 years) entry.
* Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine (undergraduate)
* Duke–NUS Medical School (postgraduate)
* Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine (undergraduate)

===South Korea===

There are 41 medical schools in South Korea. Medical programs in South Korea are undergraduate direct-entry programs akin to those in the United Kingdom, taking a total of six years to complete.

In 1996, the South Korean government started discussions to shift undergraduate medical programs to graduate-level institutions, with the hopes of eventually implementing a system resembling that of the United States and Canada. This change would require applicants to possess an undergraduate degree to be eligible. This proposal was highly controversial, namely due to public distrust regarding fairness and equal opportunity. In 2005, despite substantial opposition, the reforms were enacted, but to alleviate tensions, institutions were allowed to maintain their undergraduate medical programs along with postgraduate programs, and the adoption of postgraduate medical programs was made optional.

After about a decade of a two-tiered system, many schools opted to revert to undergraduate medical colleges, abolishing graduate-level medical schools from their institutions. As of 2023, Cha University School of Medicine is the only institution in South Korea to offer a postgraduate medical program.

===Sri Lanka===

There are eight medical schools in Sri Lanka that teach evidence based (sometimes called &quot;western&quot;) medicine. The oldest medical school is the Faculty of Medicine, University of Colombo, established as Ceylon Medical School in 1870. There are medical faculties in Peradeniya, Kelaniya, Sri Jayawardanepura, Galle, Batticaloa, Jaffna and Rajarata as well.

Kelaniya Medical Faculty initially started as the North Colombo Medical College (NCMC), a private medical institution. It was one of the earliest private higher educational institutions (1980). Heavy resistance by the medical professionals, university students and other professionals led to its nationalization and to its renaming as the Kelaniya Medical Faculty.

Faculty of Health-Care Sciences is the faculty that offers MBBS together with other para-medical courses. It is an entity of the Eastern University - Sri Lanka.

Postgraduate Institute of Medicine (PGIM) is the only institution that provides specialist training of medical doctors.

The Institute of Indigenous Medicine of the University of Colombo, the Gampaha Wickramarachchi Ayurvedhic Medicine Institute of the University of Kelaniya and the Faculty of Siddha Medicine, University of Jaffna teach Ayurvedha/ Unani / Siddha Medicine.

===Taiwan===

The medical education in the Taiwan is usually 7 years (6-year learning plus 1-year internship) in duration, starting right after high schools. 
The first 2 years in the 7-year system is composed of basic sciences and liberal art courses. Doctor-patient classes are emphasized, and most schools require compulsory amounts of volunteer hours.
Clinical sciences are compressed into a two-year program in the third and fourth years. 
The duration of clerkships and internships varies from school to school, but all of them end at the seventh grade.
Taiwan&#x27;s medical education began in 1897 and is over 100 years old now. Students graduate with a Doctor of Medicine (MD) degree. Starting from the year 2013, incoming students will have a 6+2 year curriculum, in which the first 6 years are oriented similarly as before and the last two years are Post Graduate Years; this change aims to increase primary care capabilities of medical school graduates.

===Thailand===

The first medical school in Thailand was established back in 1890 at Siriraj Hospital, which is now become Faculty of Medicine Siriraj Hospital, Mahidol University. Currently, there are 26 medical programs offered nationwide. Most of the Thai medical schools are government-funded and require Thai citizenship for eligibility. Two private medical schools exist at the moment. Some Thais choose to attend private medical schools or attend a medical school in a foreign country due to relatively few openings and extremely competitive entrance examination scores required for enrollment in public medical schools.

The Thai medical education is a six-year system, consisting of one year in basic-science, two years in pre-clinical training, and three years for clinical training. Upon graduation, all medical students must pass national medical licensing examinations and a university-based comprehensive test. After medical school, newly graduated doctors are under contract to spend a year of internship and 2 years of tenure in rural areas before they are eligible for any other residency positions or specialized training, mostly in locations outside Bangkok.

Students will receive Doctor of Medicine (MD) degree at the end of the process. This degree is equivalent to a master&#x27;s degree in Thailand.

==Caribbean==

In 2011, the International Medical Education Directory listed 59 current medical schools in the Caribbean, including 54 grant the MD degree, 3 grant the MBBS degree, and 2 grant either the MD or MBBS degree.

30 of the medical schools in the Caribbean are regional, which train students to practice in the country or region where the school is located. The remaining 29 Caribbean medical schools are known as offshore schools, which primarily train students from the United States and Canada who intend to return home for residency and clinical practice after graduation. At most offshore schools, basic sciences are completed in the Caribbean while clinical clerkships are completed at teaching hospitals in the United States.

Several agencies may also accredit Caribbean medical schools, as listed in the FAIMER Directory of Organizations that Recognize/Accredit Medical Schools (DORA). 25 of the 29 regional medical schools in the Caribbean are accredited, while 14 of the 30 offshore medical schools are accredited.

=== Curaçao ===
As of 2021, Curaçao has five medical schools registered in the World Directory of Medical Schools: Avalon University School of Medicine, Caribbean Medical University School of Medicine, 
John F. Kennedy University School of Medicine, New York Medical University School of Medicine and St. Martinus University Faculty of Medicine. All are located within the city of Willemstad. These schools provide education in Basic Medical Science (BMS) which goes towards the degree of Medical Doctor or Doctor of Medicine. Presently, none of the medical schools offer other degrees, such as MBBS or PhD (2016).
All students after completing their medical school&#x27;s Basic Medical Science program in Curaçao; will then have to apply to either take USMLE Step Exams, the Canadian or British Board Exams.

=== Dominican Republic ===

Medical studies in the Dominican Republic start after graduation from high school. The programs typically take around 6 years to complete and are generally in Spanish with a few U.S.-style 4-year programs in English geared to American students (e.g. UNIBE). 
Programs are typically divided into pre-medicine, basic sciences and clinical sciences (also called pre-internship). At the end of the pre-internship period the aspiring doctors need to complete a 1-year compulsory internship in a Dominican hospital to obtain their medical license.

=== Haiti ===
Medical schools in Haiti conduct training in French. The universities offering medical training in Haiti are the Université Notre Dame d&#x27;Haïti, Université Quisqueya, Université d&#x27;Etat d&#x27;Haïti and Université Lumière.

The Université Notre Dame d&#x27;Haïti (UNDH) is a private Catholic university established by the Episcopal Conference of Haiti. According to the UNDH website, &quot;the UNDH is not just about academic degrees, it is mainly the formation of a new type of Haiti, which includes in its culture and moral values of the Gospel, essential for serious and honest people that the country needs today.&quot;

The other two private schools offering medical degrees are Université Quisqueya and Université Lumière. The Université d&#x27;Etat d&#x27;Haïti is a public school.

Attending medical school in Haiti may be less expensive than attending medical universities located in other parts of the world, but the impact of the country&#x27;s political unrest should be considered, as it affects the safety of both visitors and Haitians.

==Europe==
===Albania===

There are two Medical Schools (Fakultete të Mjekësisë) in Albania:
* The University of Medicine, Tirana, Faculty of Medicine
* Catholic University &quot;Our Lady of Good Counsel&quot;, Faculty of Medicine
These medical schools are usually affiliated with regional hospitals. The course of study lasts 6 years. Students are conferred degree Doctor of Medicine (MD) upon graduation.

===Belarus===

There are four medical schools (Medical Universities) in Belarus:
* Belarusian State Medical University, Minsk (&quot;belarusian: Беларускі дзяржаўны медыцынскі ўніверсітэт; Russian: Белорусский государственный медицинский университет&quot;) - which contains the famous Bosef Institute for AIDS Research.
* Gomel State Medical University (&quot;belarusian: Гомельскі дзяржаўны медыцынскі ўніверсітэт; Russian: Гомельский государственный медицинский университет&quot;)
* Grodno State Medical University (&quot;belarusian: Гродненскі дзяржаўны медыцынскі ўніверсітэт; Russian: Гродненский государственный медицинский университет&quot;)
* Vitebsk State Order of Peoples&#x27; Friendship Medical University (&quot;belarusian: Віцебскі дзяржаўны медыцынскі ўніверсітэт; Russian: Витебский государственный ордена Дружбы народов медицинский университет&quot;)

===Belgium and Netherlands===

In Belgium and Netherlands, medical students receive 6 years of university education prior to their graduation.

In the Netherlands, students used to receive four years of preclinical training, followed by two years of clinical training (&quot;co-assistentschappen&quot;, or &quot;co-schappen&quot; for short) in hospitals. However, for a number of medical schools this has recently changed to three years of preclinical training, followed by three years of clinical training. At least one medical faculty, that of the Utrecht University, clinical training already begins in the third year of medical school. After 6 years, students graduate as &quot;basisartsen&quot; (comparable to Doctors of Medicine). As a result of the Bologna process, medical students in the Netherlands now receive a bachelor&#x27;s degree after three years in medical school and a master&#x27;s degree upon graduation. Prospective students can apply for medical education directly after finishing the highest level of secondary school, vwo; previous undergraduate education is not a precondition for admittance.

The Belgian medical education is much more based on theoretical knowledge than the Dutch system. In the first 3 years, which are very theoretical and lead to a university bachelor degree, general scientific courses are taken such as chemistry, biophysics, physiology, biostatistics, anatomy, virology, etc. To enter the bachelor course in Flanders, prospective students have to pass an exam, as a result of the numerus clausus. In the French-speaking part of Belgium, only the best students that pass the first year of the bachelor course in medicine are admitted to the second and third year.

After the bachelor courses, students are allowed to enter the &#x27;master in medicine&#x27; courses, which consist of 4 years of theoretical and clinical study. In general, the first 2 master years are very theoretical and teach the students in human pathology, diseases, pharmacology. The third year is a year full of internships in a wide range of specialities in different clinics. The seventh, final year serves as a kind of &#x27;pre-specialization&#x27; year in which the students are specifically trained in the specialty they wish to pursue after medical school. This contrasts with the Dutch approach, in which graduates are literally &#x27;basic doctors&#x27; (&quot;basisartsen&quot;) who have yet to decide on a specialty.

===Bosnia and Herzegovina===

There are five Medical Schools in Bosnia and Herzegovina:
* University of Banja Luka School of Medicine
* University of Sarajevo Medical School
* University of Tuzla Medical School
* University of East Sarajevo Medical School (Foca)
* University of Mostar Medical School

These medical schools are usually affiliated with regional hospitals.

The course of study lasts 6 years or 12 semesters. Students are conferred degree Doctor of Medicine (MD) upon graduation.

;Admissions
Entry to BH Medical Schools are very competitive due to limited places imposed by the government quota.
Students are required to complete Secondary School Leaving Diploma (Gimnazija-Gymnasium (school) or Medicinska skola matura/svedocanstvo/svjedodzba).

Entrance examination is usually held in June/July. Combined score of Secondary School Diploma assessment (on scale 1–5, with 2 minimum passing grade and 5 maximum grade) and entrance examination is taken into consideration. Usually, 5 in Chemistry, Biology, Mathematics, and Physics are required for entry to medicine.

; Curriculum
Course structure is more traditional and divided in pre-clinical (year 1–3) /clinical part (year 3–6) and subject-based.

Practical examinations are held throughout the degree (Anatomy, Biochemistry, Pathology, Physiology practicals etc.). Dissection is part of all medical curricula in Bosnian and Herz. Medical Schools.

=== Bulgaria ===

In Bulgaria, a medical school is a type of college or a faculty of a university. The medium of instruction is officially in Bulgarian. A six- to one-year course in Bulgarian language is required prior to admittance to the medical program. For European candidates, an exam in Biology and Chemistry in Bulgarian is also required. While a number of Bulgarian medical schools have now started offering medical programmes in English, Bulgarian is still required during the clinical years.

Students join medical school after completing high-school. Admission offers are made by individual medical schools. Bulgarian applicants have to pass entrance examinations in the subjects of Biology and Chemistry. The competitive result of every candidate is the based on their marks these exams plus their secondary-school certificate marks in the same subjects. Those applicants with the highest results achieved are classified for admission.

The course of study is offered as a six-year program. The first two years are pre-clinical, the next three years are clinical training and the sixth year is the internship year, during which students work under supervision at the hospitals. During the sixth year, students have to appear for &#x27;state exams&#x27; in the five major subjects of Internal Medicine, Surgery, Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Pediatrics and Social Medicine (also, includes Infectious Diseases, Epidemiology and Hygiene and Medical Ecology, forming part of the grade for this subject). Upon successful completion of the six years of study and the state exams the degree of &#x27;Physician&#x27; is conferred and the students obtain an &#x27;MD&#x27;. The exams are tough as the overall grade for most subjects is determined by the performance of an Oral/Spoken Exam and many students are unable to clear them, thereby prolonging their degree time.

For specialization, graduates have to appear for written tests and interviews to obtain a place in a specialization program. For specialization in general medicine, general practice lasts three years, cardiology lasts four years, internal medicine lasts five years, and general surgery lasts five years.

There are four dedicated medical universities in Bulgaria - Medical University, Sofia, Medical University of Varna, Plovdiv Medical University and Medical University Pleven. Additionally, Sofia University &quot;St. Kliment Ohridski&quot; and Trakia University also offer medical programmes.

===Croatia===

In Croatia, there are four out of seven universities that offer a medical degree, the University of Zagreb (offers medical studies in English), University of Rijeka (offers medical studies in English), University of Split (also offers medical studies in English), and the University of Osijek. The Medical schools are a faculties of those four universities. Medical students enroll into medical school after finishing secondary education, typically after a Gymnasium, or after a five-year nursing school, or any other high school lasting four years. During the application process, their high school grades, and the grades of their matriculation exam at the end of high school (Matura) and the score at the obligatory admission exam are taken into account, and the best students are enrolled.

The course of study lasts 6 years or 12 semesters. During the first 3 years, students are engaged in pre-clinical courses (Anatomy, Histology, Chemistry, Physics, Cell Biology, Genetics, Physiology, Biochemistry, Immunology, Pathologic Physiology And Anatomy, Pharmacology, Microbiology, etc.). Contact with patients begins at the third year. The remaining 3 years are composed of rotations at various departments, such as Internal Medicine, Neurology, Radiology, Dermatology, Psychiatry, Surgery, Pediatrics, Gynecology and Obstetrics, Anesthesiology, and others. During each academic year, students also enroll into two or three elective courses. After each rotation, the students take a total of about 60 exams. In the end, the students must pass a final multiple-choice exam comprising questions about clinical courses, after which they finally gain an MD, and the title of Doctor of Medicine, which they put after their name. Now the doctors must complete a one-year, supervised, paid internship in a hospital of their choice, after which they take the state (license) examination, which is an eight-part oral examination containing the eight most important clinical branches. After that, the doctors are eligible to practice medicine as general practitioners. Residencies are offered at various hospitals throughout Croatia, and at numerous medical specialities.

===Czech Republic===
Medical study in Czech Republic has a long tradition dating from the 14th century, with the first medical school starting at the First Faculty of Medicine, Charles University in Prague in 1348, making it the 11th oldest in the world. Students from all over the world are attracted to study medicine in Czech Republic because of the high standards of education provided. Most Czech Universities offer a 6-year General Medicine program in Czech and in English separately for international students.

The admission to medical studies in Czech Republic is based on the performance in high school diploma (Biology, Chemistry and Physics), English proficiency and performance in the entrance exams. Entrance examination is conducted at the university and by some representative offices abroad. After the entrance exams, successful candidates are further scrutinised by conducting interviews.

Most of the international students studying medicine in the Czech Republic originate from United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Norway, Sweden, Germany, Israel, Malaysia and the Middle East.

Most faculties of Medicine in Czech Republic have been approved by the U.S. Department of Education for participation in Federal Student Financial Aid Programs and is listed in the Directory of Postsecondary Institutions published by the U.S. Department of Education. The qualifications are also approved in Canada by the Canadian Ministry of Education and Training, and in the UK by the General Medical Council. Most medical schools are globally recognised.

There are nine public government owned medical schools in the Czech Republic:
* First Faculty of Medicine, Charles University in Prague
* Second Faculty of Medicine, Charles University in Prague
* Third Faculty of Medicine, Charles University in Prague
* Faculty of Medicine in Plzeň, Charles University in Prague
* Faculty of Medicine in Hradec Králové, Charles University in Prague
* Faculty of Medicine, Masaryk University
* Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry, Palacký University Olomouc
* Faculty of Medicine, University of Ostrava
There is one military medical school, Faculty of Military Health Sciences, University of Defence.

===Denmark===

In Denmark, basic medical education is given in four universities: University of Copenhagen, Aarhus University, University of Southern Denmark and Aalborg University. The study consists of three years of bachelor and three years of candidate studies, roughly reflecting the preclinical and clinical fields. After six years, the title of Candidate of Medicine (MD) is attained, and after swearing the Danish medical pledge upon graduation, a text from 1815 inspired by the Hippocratic Oath, the medical license () is issued by the Department of Health.

Medical school is usually followed by a year of residency called clinical basic education ( or &quot;KBU&quot;) which upon completion grants the right to practice medicine without supervision. After this, the doctor can pursue one of 38 specialisations which must start within five years after completing the clinical basic education. If the MD pursues a research or university career, sometimes he or she will skip the clinical basic education and remain a basic MD without the right to practice medicine independently.

The Danish word for a licensed physician is . The word &#x27;doktor&#x27; for a physician is used only in demotic speech, but is by some people erroneously assumed to be a title prefix of all physicians. The title of doctor (dr.med. or in full &quot;doctor medicinæ&quot;) is not equivalent to an MD in the English language, but reserved for candidates of medicine who have attained a higher doctorate. The Danish/Norwegian &quot;dr.med.&quot; title is a degree above the PhD and above the German &quot;Dr.med.&quot;

===Finland===

In Finland, basic medical education is given in five universities: Helsinki, Kuopio, Oulu, Tampere and Turku. Admission is regulated by an entrance examination. Studies involve an initial two-year preclinical period of mainly theoretical courses in anatomy, biochemistry, pharmacology etc. However, students have contact with patients from the beginning of their studies. The preclinical period is followed by a four-year clinical period, when students participate in the work of various hospitals and health care centres, learning necessary medical skills. Some Finnish universities have integrated clinical and preclinical subjects along the six-year course, diverging from the traditional program. A problem-based learning method is widely used, and inclusion of clinical cases in various courses and preclinical subjects is becoming common. All medical schools have research programs for students who wish to undertake scientific work. The duration of basic medical education is six years and the course leads to the degree of Licentiate of Medicine.

===France===
Medical studies in France are organized as follows: 
Right after graduating from high school with a baccalaureat, any student can register at a university of medicine (there are about 30 of them throughout the country). At the end of first year, an internal ranking examination takes place in each of these universities in order to implement the numerus clausus.
First year consists mainly of theoretical classes such as biophysics and biochemistry, anatomy, ethics or histology. Passing first year is commonly considered as challenging and requires hard and continuous work. Each student can only try twice. For example, the Université René Descartes welcomes about 2000 students in first year and only 300 after numerus clausus.

The second and third year are usually mainly quite theoretical although the teachings are often accompanied by placements in the field (e.g. internships as nurses or in the emergency room, depending on the university).

During fourth, fifth and sixth years, medical students get a special status called &#x27;Externe&#x27; (In some universities, such as Pierre et Marie Curie, the &#x27;Externe&#x27; status is given starting in the third year). They work as interns every morning at the hospital plus a few night shifts a month and study in the afternoon. Each internship lasts between 3 and 4 months and takes place in a different department. Med students get five weeks off per year.

At the end of sixth year, they need to pass a national ranking exam, which will determine their specialty. The students are then allowed to choose their specialty in order of their ranking. During the fifth and sixth years, students split their time between actual practice at the hospital and some theoretical courses. The average wage of medical students in their fifth and sixth year amounts to between €100 and €300 a month .

After that ranking exams, students can start as residents in the specialty they have been able to pick. That is the point from which they also start getting paid.

Towards the end of the medical program, French medical students are provided with more responsibilities and are required to defend a thesis. At the conclusion of the thesis defense, French medical students receive a State Diploma of Doctor of Medicine (MD) or &quot;&#x27;&quot; for general medicine. For those who are in speciality training will also receive a Diploma of Specialized Studies (DES = &#x27;) to mark their specialties. Some students may also receive a Diploma of Specialized Complementary Studies (DESC = &quot;&quot;).

===Georgia===

In Georgia, a medical school is a particular kind of college or faculty inside a university. The official teaching language is Georgian, although programs in English are available.

Enrolment admission requirements in Georgia are not as strict as in other countries, as some medical schools do not require entrance exams in chemistry or biology. In addition, less importance is placed on overall secondary school grades and more on the interview process and science subjects.

Many international students from Europe, Asia, and Africa choose to study medicine in Georgia due to the low tuition fees in the country. The high level of medical education and internationally recognized degrees are also important deciding factors for international students.

The study program is available as a six-year curriculum. Pre-clinical training lasts for the first two years, clinical training for the next three, and internship training for the sixth year, which involves students working in hospitals under the supervision of doctors. Students must take &quot;state examinations&quot; in the five primary disciplines of internal medicine, surgery, gynecology and obstetrics, social medicine, and pediatrics after their sixth year of study. The title of &quot;Physician&quot; is awarded upon completing six years of education and the state examinations.

Graduates who choose to specialize must take written exams and interviews in order to be accepted into a program. Three years are spent in general practice, four in cardiology, five in internal medicine, and five in general surgery while specializing in general medicine.

===Germany===
In Germany, admission to medical schools is currently administered jointly by the &quot;&quot; (SfH), a centralized federal organization, and the universities themselves. The most important criterion for admission is the Numerus clausus, the final GPA scored by the applicant on the Abitur (highest secondary school diploma). However, in light of the recent gain in influence of medical schools in regards to applicant selection, additional criteria are being used to select students for admission. These criteria vary among medical faculties and the final Abitur GPA is always a core indicator and strongly influences admission. Admission remains highly competitive. A very small number of slots per semester are reserved for selected applicants which already hold a university degree (Zweitstudium) and for medical officer candidates (Sanitätsoffizieranwärter).

The first two years of medical school consist of the so-called pre-clinical classes. During this time, the students are instructed in the basic sciences (e.g. physics, chemistry, biology, anatomy, physiology, biochemistry, etc.) and must pass a federal medical exam (&#x27;), administered nationally. Upon completion, the students advance to the clinical stage, where they receive three years of training and education in the clinical subjects (e.g. internal medicine, surgery, obstetrics and gynecology, pediatrics, pharmacology, pathology, etc.). After these three years, they have to pass the second federal medical exam (&#x27;) before continuing with the sixth and final year. The last year of medical school consists of the so-called &quot;practical year&quot; (&quot;)&quot;. Students are required to spend three four-month clerkships, two of them in a hospital (internal medicine and surgery) as well as one elective, which can be one of the other clinical subjects (e.g. family medicine, anesthesiology, neurology, pediatrics, radiology etc.).

After at least six years of medical school, the students graduate with a final federal medical exam (&quot;Dritter Abschnitt der ärztlichen Prüfung&quot;). Graduates receive the license to practice medicine or dentistry and the professional title of physician (&#x27;) or dentist (&#x27;). The academic degrees Doctor of Medicine (Dr. med.) and Doctor of Dental Medicine (Dr. med. dent.) are awarded if the graduate has, in addition, successfully completed a scientific study and dissertation. It is a doctoral degree and therefore different from the MD or DDS degrees in the U.S., which as professional degrees are awarded after passing the final exams and do not require additional scientific work. Many medical students opt to perform their thesis during their studies at medical school, but only a fraction of them is able to finish the dissertation-process during their studies. The requirements for getting a Dr. med. degree across the board are not as hard as for the doctor in natural science (Dr. rer. nat.). Therefore, many critics advocate to adopt a system similar to that of the Anglo-Saxon countries with an MD as a professional degree and a PhD showing additional scientific qualification. 
If physicians wish to open up a doctor&#x27;s office, they are required to further complete residency in order to fulfill the federal requirements of becoming Facharzt (specialized in a certain field of medicine like internal medicine, surgery, pediatrics etc.). Oral and maxillofacial surgeons must complete both studies, medicine and dentistry, then afterwards specializing another 5 years.

There are 36 medical faculties in Germany.

===Greece===
In Greece, medical schools are faculties within public universities offering undergraduate and postgraduate medical education. Greek is the primary language of instruction; however, several medical schools now provide English-taught programs tailored for international students, particularly those aiming to attract students from across Europe and beyond.

===Hungary===
Hungary has four medical schools. The best known is Semmelweis University in Budapest which is a specialized university in the area of medicine and health sciences. The University of Debrecen, the University of Pécs and the University of Szeged also has medical faculties. General medicine training takes six years to complete, of which the last year is a practical year. Students receive the degree Dr. med. Univ. or Dr. for short, equivalent to the MD degree upon graduation, after which a graduated physician can start specialist training. All Hungarian medical schools have programs fully taught in English. The diplomas issued by Hungarian Medical Schools are accepted by all European Union countries and several other countries (Norway, United States, Canada, Israel etc.)

===Iceland===
In Iceland, admission to medical school requires passing an organized test, controlled by the University of Iceland, which anyone with a gymnasium degree can take. Only the top 75 scores on the exam are granted admission each year. Medical school in Iceland takes 6 years to complete. Students receive a cand.med. degree upon graduation. Following this, Icelandic regulations require 12 months of clinical internship before granting a full medical license. This internship consists of internal medicine (4 months), surgery (2 months), family medicine (3 months) and a three-month elective period. Upon receiving a license to practice, a physician can start specialist training, in Iceland or abroad.

===Ireland===

There are six medical schools in Ireland. They are at Trinity College Dublin, the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, University College Dublin, University College Cork, University of Limerick and the National University of Ireland, Galway (the National University of Ireland is the degree-awarding institution for all except the University of Limerick and Trinity College). Training lasts four, five or six years, with the last two years in the affiliated teaching hospitals (UCD - St. Vincents University Hospital, Mater Misericordiae University Hospital) (Trinity - St. James&#x27;s Hospital, Tallaght University Hospital) (UCC - Cork University Hospital) (RCSI - Beaumont Hospital, Connolly Hospital, University Hospital Waterford).

For Programmes that are six years in length, entry is based on secondary school qualifications. Programmes that are four years in length require previous university degrees. The Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland and the University of Limerick were the first medical institutions to offer Graduate Entry Medicine of four years duration in Ireland. This is now also offered in University College Dublin and University College Cork. The National University of Ireland, Galway also launched a graduate entry programme in 2010.

Medical education is regulated by the Irish Medical Council, the statutory body that is also responsible for maintaining a register of medical practitioners. After graduation with the degrees of BM BS (Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery) or MB BCh BAO (Medicinae Baccalaureus, Baccalaureus in Chirurgia, Baccalaureus in Arte Obstetricia), a doctor is required to spend one year as an intern under supervision before full registration is permitted. Graduates of the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland also receive the traditional &quot;Licenciate of the Royal Colleges of Surgeons and Physicians in Ireland&quot; (LRCP&amp;SI), which was awarded before the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland became an Affiliate of the National University of Ireland and thus was allowed grant degrees, under the Medical Practitioners Act (1978).

===Italy===
In Italy, the contents of the medical school admission test is decided each year by the Ministry of Education, Universities and Research (MIUR) and consists of sixty questions divided in five categories: logics and &quot;general education&quot; (&quot;cultura generale&quot;), mathematics, physics, chemistry, and biology. Results are expressed in a national ranking.

As a general rule, all state-run medical schools in the country administer it on the same day, whereas all privately run medical schools administer it on another day, so that a candidate may take the test once for state-run schools and once for a private school of his or her choice, but no more.

Some universities in Italy provide an international degree course in medicine taught entirely in English for both Italian and non-Italian students. A number of these medical schools are at public universities, and have relatively low tuition fees compared to the English-speaking world, because the cost of the medical education is subsidized by the state for both Italian and non-Italian students. These public medical schools include the International Medical School at the University of Milan, the University of Pavia, the University of Padua, Rome &quot;La Sapienza&quot;, Rome &quot;Tor Vergata&quot;, Naples Federico II, the Second University of Naples, the University of Messina and the University of Bari. These universities require applicants to rank highly on the International Medical Admissions Test. Italy also has private or parochial, more expensive English-language medical schools such as Vita-Salute San Raffaele University, Università Campus Bio-Medico in Rome and Humanitas University in Milan, and at the Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore Rome campus.

Medicine is one of the university faculties implementing numerus clausus (&quot;numero chiuso&quot;): the overall number of medical students admitted every year is constant, as each medical school is assigned a maximum number of new admission per year by MIUR.

Medical school lasts 6 years (12 semesters). Traditionally, the first three years are devoted to &quot;biological&quot; subjects (physics, chemistry, biology, biochemistry, genetics, anatomy, physiology, immunology, pathophysiology, microbiology, and usually English language courses), whereas the later three years are devoted to &quot;clinical&quot; subjects. However, most schools are increasingly devoting the second semester of the third year to clinical subjects and earlier patient contact. In most schools, there are about 36 exams over the 6-year cycle, as well as a number of compulsory rotations and elective activities.

At the end of the cycle, students have to discuss a final thesis before a board of professors; the subject of this thesis may be a review of academic literature or an experimental work, and usually takes more than a year to complete, with most students beginning an &quot;internato&quot; (internship) in the subject of their choice in their fifth or sixth year. The title awarded at the end of the discussion ceremony is that of &quot;Dottore Magistrale&quot;, styled in English as a Doctor of Medicine, which in accordance with the Bologna process is comparable with a master&#x27;s degree qualification or a US MD.

Until 2020, after graduating, new doctors had to complete a three-month, unpaid, supervised &quot;tirocinio post-laurea&quot; (&quot;post-degree placement&quot;) consisting of two months in their university hospital (one month in a medical service and one in a surgical service) as well as one month shadowing a general practitioner. After getting a statement of successful completion of each month from their supervisors, new doctors took the &quot;esame di stato&quot; (&quot;state exame&quot;) to obtain a full license to practise medicine. Starting from 2020 the three-month postgraduate internship and the state exam are no longer necessary.

New doctors have to register with one of the branches of the &quot;Ordine dei Medici&quot; (&quot;Order of Physicians&quot;), which are based in each of the Provinces of Italy.
Registration makes new doctors legally able to practice medicine without supervision. They will then have to choose between various career paths, each usually requiring a specific admission exam: most either choose to train as general practitioner (a 3-year course run by each Region, including both general practice and rotation at non-university hospitals), or to enter a &quot;Scuola di Specializzazione&quot; (&quot;specialty school&quot;) at a university hospital 4-year or 5-year course.

===Lithuania===
Lithuania has two medical schools, in Kaunas and Vilnius. Studies are of six years, of which the last year is a practical year. All Lithuanian medical schools have programs in English.

===Norway===
Medical education in Norway begins with a six- to six-and-a-half-year undergraduate university program. Admission requires a very high GPA from secondary school - medicine consistently ranks as the most difficult university programme to be admitted to in Norway. Furthermore, certain high school subjects are required for admission (chemistry, mathematics and physics). The first two years consists almost wholly of preclinical science subjects, followed by integration of clinical training the remaining four years in a spiral approach. Upon completion, students are awarded a candidatus/candidata medicinae (cand. med.) degree (corresponding to e.g. and MD in the US) and medical license. Those completing a research programme (Forskerlinje) get this added to their degree. Following this, a minimum of 18 months of internship (turnustjeneste) is required before applying on a specialist training in Norway. The internship consist of 6 months of internal medicine, 6 months of surgery and 6 months family medicine. There are currently 43 recognized medical specialties in Norway. Optionally it is possible to pursue the title of doctor medicinae (Dr. med.), by publishing multiple research papers through a university research group followed by completing a dissertation.

===Poland===
In Poland, medicine is taught as an undergraduate degree. After a six-year course graduates are awarded the title of &quot;lekarz&quot; (doctor), equivalent to a master&#x27;s degree. Furthermore, medical graduates must complete 13 month long, postgraduate internship to gain full registration to practice medicine.
===Portugal===

In Portugal, the medical course is a postgraduate degree, so a prior graduation from an undergraduate course (3 to 4 years) in areas involving health such as biology, nursing and pharmaceutical sciences, among others, is necessary for applying for the Master&#x27;s in Medicine (3 years). Most students (≈80%) enter Medical School by joining an integrated master&#x27;s degree in medicine, this course is composed by an undergraduate course in &quot;Basic Health Sciences&quot; (&quot;Licenciatura em Ciencias Basicas da Saude&quot;) (3 years) that involves chemistry, general biology and health and, after that, the master&#x27;s (three years) which is the clinical course. Access to the Integrated Master&#x27;s Course in Medicine is gained through National Exams in Biology, Chemistry and Mathematics. After obtaining their master&#x27;s degree, students must register with Order of Medics (the national medical association) and take a final examination: the students with the best grades are accepted into the medical specialty of their choice. The rest can either wait another year and retake the exam, do less specialized work or seek a residency program abroad. After the exam, all students must complete a one-year general internship program that enables them to practice medicine autonomously.

This is the list of all Medical Schools in Portugal:
* Universidade do Minho, Braga
* Universidade do Algarve, Faro
* Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Coimbra, Coimbra
* Faculdade de Ciências da Saúde, Covilhã
* Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de Lisboa, Lisboa
* Faculdade de Ciências Médicas da Universidade Nova de Lisboa, Lisboa
* Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade do Porto, Porto
* Abel Salazar Biomedical Sciences Institute, Porto

===Romania===

In Romania, medical school is a department of a medical university, which typically includes Dentistry and Pharmacy departments as well. The name &quot;facultate&quot; is used for departments in their universities too, but the Medicine departments distinguish themselves by the length of studies (6 years), which grants to graduates a status equivalent to that of a Master in Science. The Medicine departments are also marked by reduced flexibility - in theory, a student in a regular university can take courses from different departments, like Chemistry and Geography (although it usually does not happen, majors being clearly defined), while the medical universities do not have any extra offers for their students, due to their specialization. Admission to medical faculty is usually awarded by passing a Human Biology, Organic Chemistry and/or Physics test. The program lasts 6 years, with first 2 years being preclinical and last 4 years being mostly clinical. After these six years, one has to take the national licence exam (which consists of mostly clinically oriented questions, but some questions also deal with basic sciences) and has to write a thesis in any field he/she studied. Final award is &quot;Doctor-Medic (titlu onorific)&quot; (shortened Dr.), which is not an academic degree (similar to Germany). All graduates have to go through residency and specialization exams after that in order to practice, although older graduates had different requirements and training (e.g., clinical rotations similar to sub-internship) and might still be able to practice Family Medicine / General Medicine.

===Russia===

Medical schools in Russia offer a 6-year curriculum leading to award Doctor of Medicine (MD) &quot;Physician&quot;.
Russian medical authorities reluctantly agrees with inclusion in list of international medical schools FAIMER-IMED. FAIMER cannot include medical schools without cooperation from Russia. For example, Orel State University Medical Institute is not included in this list.

===Serbia===
In Serbia, medical school is a division of a medical university, which also frequently houses schools of dentistry and pharmacy. In their institutions, departments are also referred to as faculties. However, the medical departments stand out due to the length of their programs - six years - which confer on their graduates a standing similar to a Master of Science.

Passing a test in human biology, organic chemistry, or physics is typically required for admission to medical school. If the student is to study in a program taught in English instead of Serbian, and their mother tongue is not English, universities may also require a certificate of proficiency. Official certificates include IELTS or TOEFL.

The English language medical programs in Serbia have proven popular with students from Europe, Asia, and Africa due to the low tuition fees and internationally recognized degrees.

The six-year curriculum is divided into two pre-clinical years and four primarily clinical years. After these six years, one must complete a thesis in any study area and the national license test, which is primarily clinically focused but also includes some questions on basic sciences. Doctor-Medic (abbreviated Dr.) is the final designation but is not considered an academic title.

===Sweden===

Medical education in Sweden begins with a five-and-a-half-year undergraduate university program leading to the degree &quot;Master of Science in Medicine&quot; (). Following this, the National Board of Health and Welfare requires a minimum of 18 months of clinical internship () before granting a medical license to be fully qualified as &quot;Medical Doctor (MD)&quot;.

This internship consists of surgery (3–6 months), internal medicine (3–6 months), psychiatry (three months) and family medicine (six months). Upon receiving a license to practice, a physician is able to apply for a post to start specialist training. There are currently 52 recognized medical specialties in Sweden. The specialist training has a duration of minimum five years, which upon completion grants formal qualification as a specialist.

===Switzerland===
There are eight universities granting medical degrees in Switzerland and six university hospitals:
* Faculty of Medicine of the University of Basel (see also University Hospital of Basel)

===Turkey===
All high school graduates who wish to pursue further education are required to take an MCQ exam. The exam covers most of the high school and secondary school curricula.

A student who scores high enough gets a place in a faculty of his/her desire. Entrance to medical schools is extremely competitive, only very top scoring students are accepted to medical schools.

Medical education in Turkey follows a specific policy and is regulated by the Ministry of Health and the Council of Higher Education (YÖK).
Medical education takes six years, first three years being Pre-clinical years and the latter three being Clinical years. During the &quot;clinical&quot; phase, students rotate through various clinical departments, such as internal medicine, surgery, pediatrics, obstetrics and gynecology, psychiatry, and more. Right after graduation, graduates can either work as GPs or take another exam called TUS (Medical Specialization Examination) to do residency in a particular department of a particular hospital.

Most of the medical schools in Turkey are state schools but the number of private schools is on the rise. MCQ exam (TYT and AYT) scores required to be accepted to private medical schools are lower compared to their public counterparts. The language of instruction is, in general, Turkish, but few universities also offer schools with English as the language of instruction. This makes Turkey a popular place to study medicine for students from nearby areas like the Balkans, the Middle East, and to a lesser extent North Africa.

===Ukraine===
Medical degrees in Ukraine were offered only in institutions called medical universities, which are separate from traditional universities. However, some medical schools are now associated with classical universities. These include:
* Ternopil State Medical University
* Donetsk National Medical University 
* Danylo Halytsky Lviv National Medical University
* Kharkiv National Medical University
* Dnipro State Medical University
* Ivano-Frankivsk National Medical University
* Bukovinian State Medical University
* Zaporizhia State Medical University
* Ukrainian Medical Stomatological Academy
* Donetsk National Medical University
* Bogomolets National Medical University Of Ukraine
* Crimea State Medical University
* Luhansk State Medical University
* Odesa National Medical University
* Vinnytsia National Pirogov Memorial Medical University
* School of Medicine of V N Karazin Kharkiv National University
* Medical Faculty of Sumy State University
* Medical Faculty of Uzhhorod University
* Medical Faculty of Dnipro National University
* Kyiv Medical University of UAFM

===United Kingdom===

In the United Kingdom, the code for higher education, first degrees in medicine comprise an integrated programme of study and professional practice spanning several levels. While the final outcomes of the qualifications themselves typically meet the Expectations of the descriptor for higher education qualification at level 7 (the UK master&#x27;s degree). These degrees may retain, for historical reasons, &quot;Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery&quot; and are abbreviated to MBChB or MBBS.

There are currently 32 institutions that offer medical degrees in the United Kingdom. Completion of a medical degree in the UK results in the award of the degrees of Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery. Admission requirements to the schools varies; most insist on solid A-Levels/Highers, a good performance in an aptitude test such as the UKCAT, the BMAT or the GAMSAT, and usually an interview. As of 2008 the UK has approximately 8000 places for medical students.

Methods of education range from courses that offer a problem-based learning approach (alongside lectures etc.), and others having a more traditional pre-clinical/clinical structure. Others combine several approaches in an integrated approach.

Following qualification, UK doctors enter a generalised two-year, competency-based &quot;foundation programme&quot;, gaining full GMC (General Medical Council) registration at the end of foundation year one, and applying for specialist training (in medicine, surgery, general practice etc.) after foundation year two.

Many medical schools offer intercalated degree programmes to allow students to focus on an area of research outside their medical degree for a year.

Some medical schools offer graduate entry programmes, which are four years long. The name refers to the fact that students on these courses already have a degree in another subject (i.e. they are graduates). Due to the shorter length of the course, the timetable of these degrees are more intense and the holidays are shorter, compared to students on the 5-year course. In terms of entrance requirements, the 4-year degree restricts entry to those who already hold a first degree, and have previously worked in an area of healthcare. The first degree does not necessarily have to be a BSc degree (this is the criteria for some of the medical schools), whereas other medical schools specify that the prior degree has to be in a science subject. Competition for this course is fierce, with students having to also sit an entrance exam prior to being considered for an interview.

Medical schools typically admit more students into undergraduate programmes than into graduate entry programmes.

==Latin America==
=== Argentina ===

In 1821, the first school of medicine was formed in the capital city Buenos Aires, where the bulk of the medical schools are located. As of 2006, there were 29 medical schools in Argentina. Medical degree programs in Argentina typically are six years long, with some universities opting for 7 year programs. The six years usually consist of 3 years of basic sciences, 2 years of clinical sciences, and one internship year (in Spanish &quot;internado anual rotatorio&quot;). The internship is completed in a Hospital associated with the university. In some provinces (especially round the more developed South) there are government-funded hospitals who pay for the internship. Some universities have cultural exchange programmes that allow a medical student in their final year to serve their community time overseas.

In Argentina, there are public and private medical schools. By law entrance into public institutions is open and tuition-free to all who have a high school diploma, and universities are expressly forbidden from restricting access with difficult entrance exams. Point in case, in 2016 the National University of La Plata was forced by governing bodies to stop forcing its students to write an entrance exam. As a result, that university experienced a major increase in the size of its student population. Another consequence is that schools have a high drop-out rate during the first years that approach 90%. When it comes to educational quality, the University of Buenos Aires Faculty of Medical Sciences, a public university, is widely recognised as the top medical school in the country.

Upon graduation, one of the following degrees is obtained, according to the university: Doctor of Medicine, or both Doctor of Medicine and Doctor of Surgery. Public universities usually confer both degrees, and private universities bestow only a Doctor of Medicine. In daily practice, however, there is no substantial difference between what a Doctor of Medicine or a Doctor of Medicine and Doctor of Surgery are allowed to do. When the degree is obtained, a record is created for that new doctor in the index of the National Ministry of Education (&quot;Ministerio Nacional de Educación&quot;), and the physician is given their corresponding medical practitioner&#x27;s ID, which is a number that identifies him and his academic achievements. In addition, there is a provincial ID, i.e. a number to identify doctors in the province they practice medicine in. Completion of a residency program is not required for medical licensing.

There is no central system for applying for medical residency. Doctors wishing to pursue a specialty must take rigorous entrance exams at the public/private institution of their choice that offers them. Programs admit approximately half of each year&#x27;s graduates after a lengthy selection process. Most specialty courses last four years, depending on the branch of medicine the physician has chosen.

=== El Salvador ===

The University of El Salvador) has a program lasting eight years for students who want to study medicine. The first six years are organized in a two semesters fashion, the seventh year is used for a rotating internship through the major specialty areas in a 10-week periods fashion (psychiatry and public health share a period) and the eighth year is designated for Social service in locations approved by the Ministry of Health (usually as attending physician in Community Health Centers or non-profit organizations). The graduates receive the degree of MD and must register in the Public Health Superior Council to get the medical license and a registered national number that allows them to prescribe barbiturates and other controlled drugs.

In order to attend further studies, including surgery, internal medicine, G/OB, pediatrics, or psychiatry, students in the year of social service or graduates of any Salvadorian university must apply independently for the residency at the hospital of choice; the preliminary selection process is based on the results of clinical knowledge tests, followed by psychiatric evaluations and interviews with the hospital medical and administrative staff. The basic residencies mentioned above commonly last 3 years; at the last trimester of the third year, the residents can apply to the position of Chief of residents (1 year) or follow further studies as residents (3 years) of a specialty (for example orthopedic surgery, urology, neurology, endocrinology...). No further studies are offered to date; therefore, specialists looking for training or practice in a specific area (For example, a neurosurgeon looking for a specialty in endovascular neurosurgery, spine surgery or pediatric neurosurgery) must attend studies in other countries and apply for such positions independently.

=== Bolivia ===
In Bolivia, all medical schools are Faculties within a university and follow the European model of a six-year curriculum (9 000 ECTS or more) divided into three cycles. The first two years are called the biomedical or pre-clinical cycle. During this time students are instructed in the basic sciences (anatomy, anthropology, biochemistry, biophysics, cell biology, embryology, histology, physiology, pharmacology, biostatistics, etc.). The next three years are the clinical cycle and consist of medical specialties instruction at the faculty and hospital practice. The last year consists of an internship for 3 months each of surgery, internal medicine, gynecology and pediatrics. To acquire the license from the government to practice medicine, at the end of the internship an Honorary Mandatory Socialist Service (SSSRO) must be done in a rural area of the country for at least three months.

After getting the degree and license as &quot;Graduate of Medicine and Surgery&quot; or Médico Cirujano (MC) may take a post-graduate residency from 3 to 6 years in order to acquire a specialty.

=== Brazil ===
The Brazilian medical schools follow the European model of a six-year curriculum, divided into three cycles of two years each. The first two years are called basic cycle (&quot;ciclo básico&quot;). During this time students are instructed in the basic sciences (anatomy, physiology, pharmacology, immunology, etc.) with activities integrated with the medical specialties, allowing the student an overview of the practical application of such content. After its completion, the students advance to the clinical cycle (&quot;ciclo clinico&quot;). At this stage contact with patients intensify and work with tests and diagnostics, putting into practice what was learned in the first two years. The last two are called internships &quot;(internato&quot;). In this last step, the students focus on clinical practice, through training in teaching hospitals and clinics. The teaching of this last step reflects an axis of increasing complexity, enabling students to make decisions and participate effectively in form and operative care under the direct supervision of faculty and qualified to act as teaching aids physicians.

After six years of training, students graduate and are awarded the title of physician (&quot;Médico&quot;) allowing them to register with the Regional Council of Medicine (&quot;Conselho Regional de Medicina&quot;). The recent graduate will be able to exercise the medical profession as a general practitioner and may apply to undertake postgraduate training. In 2012, the Regional Council of Medicine of São Paulo (&quot;Conselho Regional de Medicina do Estado de São Paulo&quot;) established that physicians who graduate this year must pass a test to obtain professional registration. Passing the exam, however, is not linked to obtaining registration. It required only the presence of the candidate and the test performance. Already at the national level, there is a pending Senate bill creating the National Proficiency Examination in Medicine (&quot;Exame Nacional de Proficiência em Medicina&quot;), which would make the race a prerequisite for the exercise of the profession.

Physicians who want to join a specialization program must undergo a new selection examination considered as competitive as that required to join a medical school. The specialization programs are divided into two categories: direct access and prerequisite. The specialties with direct access are those in which the doctor can enroll without having any prior expertise. Any physician can apply to examinations for these specialties, regardless of the time of training or prior experience. To apply to proprietary pre-requisite, the doctor should have already completed a specialty prior. The programs may range from 2 to 6 years. Brazil currently recognizes by the Federal Council of Medicine, the Brazilian Medical Association and the National Commission of Medical Residency 53 residency programs. Fully complied with, gives the title of a resident physician specialist.

=== Chile ===

In Chile, there are 21 medical schools. Principal medical schools are Universidad de Chile, Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile, Universidad de Concepción, Universidad de Valparaíso and Universidad de Santiago de Chile. The pre-grade studies are distributed over 7 years, where the last 2 are the internship, which include at least surgery, internal medicine, gynecology and pediatrics. After getting the degree of Licenciate in Medicine (General Medicine) the MD must pass a medicine knowledge exam called the Unique National Exam of Medical Knowledge (EUNACOM &quot;Examen Único Nacional de Conocimientos de Medicina&quot; in Spanish) and can take a direct specialty or work before in primary attention in order to gain access to a residency.

=== Colombia ===
In Colombia, there are 50 medical schools listed in the World Directory of Medical Schools, 27 of which have active programs and are currently registered and accredited as high-quality programs by the Colombian Ministry of Education. The main medical programs are offered by the Universidad Nacional de Colombia, Pontificia Universidad Javeriana, Universidad del Rosario, Universidad El Bosque, Universidad de los Andes, Universidad del Valle, Universidad de Antioquia, Universidad de Santander, Universidad del Norte and Universidad de la Sabana. Most programs require 6–7 years of study, and all offer a Doctor of Medicine (MD) degree. In some cases, the school also allows for a second degree to be studied for at the same time (this is chosen by the student, though most students end up needing to do alternate semesters between their degrees, and mostly in careers like microbiology or biomedical engineering). For example, the Universidad de los Andes has a program whereby the medical student could graduate with both an MD and a Master of Business Administration (MBA) degree or an MD and a master&#x27;s degree in public health. Admission to medical school varies with the school but is usually dependent on a combination of a general application to the university, an entrance exam, a personal statement or interview, and secondary (high) school performance mostly as reflected on the ICFES score (the grade received on the state exam in the final year of secondary/high school).

In most medical programs, the first two years deal with basic scientific courses (cellular and molecular biology, chemistry, organic chemistry, mathematics, and physics), and the core medical sciences (anatomy, embryology, histology, physiology, and biochemistry). The following year may change in how it is organized in different schools but is usually organ system-based pathophysiology and therapeutics (general and systems pathology, pharmacology, microbiology, parasitology, immunology, and medical genetics are also taught in this block). In the first two years, the programs also usually begin the courses in the epidemiology track (which may or may not include biostatistics), a clinical skills track (semiology and the clinical examination), a social medicine/public health track, and a medical ethics and communication skills track. Modes of training vary but are usually based on lectures, simulations, standardized-patient sessions, problem-based learning sessions, seminars, and observational clinical experiences. By year three, most schools have begun the non-elective, clinical-rotation block with accompanying academic courses (these include but are not limited to internal medicine, pediatrics, general surgery, anaesthesiology, orthopaedics, gynaecology and obstetrics, emergency medicine, neurology, psychiatry, oncology, urology, physical medicine and rehabilitation, ophthalmology, and otorhinolaryngology). Elective rotations are usually introduced in the fourth or fifth year, though as in the case of the non-elective rotations, &quot;the hospitals the medical students may be placed in or apply to for a given rotation depend entirely on the medical schools&quot;. This is important in terms of medical training, given the particular distinction of patients, pathologies, procedures, and skills seen and learned in private vs. public hospitals in Colombia. Most schools, however, have placements in both types of hospitals for many specialties.

The final year of medical school in Colombia is referred to as the internship year (&quot;internado&quot;). The internship year is usually divided into two semesters. The first semester is made up of obligatory rotations that every student does though in different orders, and the medical intern serves in 5–7 different specialties, typically including internal medicine, paediatrics, general surgery, anaesthesiology, orthopaedics, gynaecology and obstetrics, and emergency medicine. The extent of the responsibilities of the intern varies with the hospital, as does the level of supervision and teaching, but generally, medical interns in Colombia extensively take, write, and review clinical histories, answer and discuss referrals with their seniors, do daily progress notes for the patients under their charge, participate in the service rounds, present and discuss patients at rounds, serve shifts, assist in surgical procedures, and assist in general administrative tasks. Sometimes, they are charged with ordering diagnostic testing, but, under Colombian law, they cannot prescribe medication as they are not graduate physicians. This, of course, are to be completed in addition to their academic responsibilities. The second semester is made up of elective rotations, which can be at home or abroad, in the form of clerkships or observerships. A final graduation requirement is to sit a standardized exam, the State Exam for Quality in Higher Education (&quot;Examen de Estado de Calidad de la Educación Superior&quot; or ECAES, also known as SABER PRO) specific to medicine, which tests, for example, knowledge in public health and primary care.

After graduation, the physician is required to register with the Colombian Ministry of Health, in order to complete a year of obligatory social service (&quot;servicio social obligatorio&quot;), after which they qualify for a professional license to practice general medicine and apply for a medical residency within Colombia. If, however, the student wishes to practice general medicine abroad or continue onto their postgraduate studies, for example, they can independently begin the appropriate application/equivalency process, &quot;without&quot; doing their obligatory social service. In this case, they would not be licensed to practise medicine in Colombia and if they wish to do so, will have to register with the Ministry of Health. N.B. If the graduate physician gets accepted immediately into a residency within Colombia in internal medicine, paediatrics, family medicine, gynecology and obstetrics, general surgery or anaesthesiology, they are allowed to complete a 6-month-long social service &quot;after&quot; their residency.

In contrast with most countries, residencies in Colombia are not paid positions, since one applies for the program through the university offering the post, which requires a tuition. However, on 9 May 2017, legislation was formally introduced in Congress that would seek to regulate payment for medical residents, regulate their tuitions, and advocate for their vacation time and working hours. As in other countries, the length of residency training depends upon the specialty chosen, and, following its completion, the physician may choose to apply for a fellowship (subspecialty) at home or abroad depending on the availability of their desired training programs, or practice in their specialty.

=== Guyana ===

In Guyana, the medical school is accredited by the National Accreditation Council of Guyana. The medical program ranges from 4 years to 6 years. Students are taught the basic sciences aspect of the program within the first 2 years of medical school. In the clinical sciences program, students are introduced to the hospital setting where they gain hands-on training from the qualifying physicians and staff at the various teaching hospitals across Guyana.

* Texila American University
* American International School of Medicine
* University of Guyana

Students graduating from the University of Guyana are not required to sit for board exams before practicing medicine in Guyana. Students graduating from the American International School of Medicine sit the USMLE, PLAB or CAMC exams.

=== Panama ===

The system of Medical education in Panama usually takes students from high school directly into Medical School for a 6-year course, typically with a two-year internship.

In order to practice medicine in the Republic, or enter a residency program in Panama it is required to be a Panamanian citizen. Other requirements include:
*First year rotatory Internship: Qualified medical practitioners must successfully undertake and complete one year of supervised practice, generally known as an internship. The internship is undertaken in hospital positions accredited for this purpose.
*2 year rural Internship: Upon successful conclusion of the first intern year, doctors are required to undertake and complete a second year of internship at an assigned government health institution. Once this requirement is fulfilled the medical practitioners qualify for full registration in the Medical Board and are licensed to engage in independent medical practice in Panama.

=== Uruguay ===

In Uruguay, three universities offer a medical degree. The University of the Republic (UdelaR) is the oldest and largest institution in the country, with its Faculty of Medicine dating back to 1875. The program at this university has a duration of seven years. The faculty also operates the Hospital Clinic Manuel Quintela as its teaching hospital.

The other two institutions offering medical studies are the Latin American Center for Human Economy (CLAEH) in Punta del Este, and the Catholic University of Uruguay, both of which offer a six-year program plus a mandatory internship.

=== Venezuela ===

These are the universities with a medical school in Venezuela:

* Central University of Venezuela
* University of the Andes (Venezuela)
* University of Zulia
* University of Carabobo
* Universidad de Oriente
* Universidad Centroccidental Lisandro Alvarado
* Universidad Nacional Experimental Francisco de Miranda
* Universidad Nacional Experimental de Los Llanos Centrales Rómulo Gallegos
* Bolivarian University of Venezuela

==Middle East==
===Egypt===
Medical schools in Egypt are five-year programs. Education is conducted in English and leads to a Bachelor of Medicine and Surgery (MBBCh). Graduates must finish a two-year internship program at the end of their studies to obtain their general practitioner license. Clinical training happens in each school teaching hospital with few exceptions. A small number of schools use Ministry of Health hospitals.

Admission into Egyptian private and public medical schools is centrally managed by the government. After students submit their applications, they are distributed among different institutions according to both their order of preference and their high school performance.

In Egypt, there are two main pathways to postgraduate studies in medicine. The academic pathway, leading to a scientific degree: either MSc. or PhD The second is the Fellowship of the Egyptian Board (FEB) program. About 20% of medical graduates pursue post-graduate studies, the rest join the healthcare workforce as general practitioners.

===Iran===
General medicine education in Iran takes 7 to 7.5 years. Students enter the university after high school. Students study basic medical science (such as anatomy, physiology, biochemistry, histology, biophysics, embryology, etc.) for 2.5 years. At the end of this period they should pass a &quot;basic science&quot; exam. Those who passed the exam will move on to study physiopathology of different organs in the next 1.5 years. The organ-based learning approach emphasizes critical thinking and clinical application. In the next period of education students enter clinics and educational hospitals for two years. During this period, they will also learn practical skills such as history taking and physical examination. Students should then pass the &quot;pre-internship&quot; exam to enter the last 1.5 years of education in which medical students function as interns. During this period, medical students participate in all aspects of medical care of the patients and they take night calls. At the end of these 7.5 years students are awarded an MD degree. MD doctors can continue their educations through residency and fellowship.

===Iraq===
In Iraq, medical &quot;colleges&quot; (commonly referred to as medical &quot;schools&quot; in the US) typically offer a 6-year curriculum that is presented in the English language, similar to that of European countries. It is completely free for students with exceptionally high grades on 6th preparatory exams (standardized 12th grade exams), which are held by Iraq&#x27;s Ministry of Education. There are paid options for students with lower grades. Medical education can commence immediately after the 6th preparatory class (equivalent to 12th grade in a K-12 system) in preparatory school (high school). As of 2024, there are 33 medical colleges in Iraq, both public (governorate/province-funded and/or government-funded) and private, acknowledged by the World Directory of Medical Schools.

Generally, the first year is introductory, with students studying basic human biology as well as non-medical subjects such as Human Rights, Arabic and English. These are foundational subjects. They are taught in every college in Iraq in the first or second year no matter the field, and they are deemed so by the Iraqi Ministry of Higher Education. The subsequent two years are pre-clinical and are similar to those of medical schools in other countries. The 4th and 5th years have clinical rotations and are clinical years. The 6th year is the last. During this year, students are primarily engaged in hospital rotations with less emphasis on academic material.

Throughout the 6 years, students may have to attend exams that more than one medical college participates in, although the specific timing and frequency of these exams vary between colleges. However, most colleges have a standardized exam at the end of year 6, which alone typically accounts for 30% of the cumulative grade. Upon completion of the program, graduates are awarded a Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery (M.B.Ch.B.) degree. The job title for those who hold the degree is &quot;Rotating Resident Physician&quot;.

What follows is an exemplary curriculum from one of Iraq&#x27;s medical colleges. This curriculum follows a &quot;system-wise approach&quot; where subjects are taught within the context of each system before transitioning to the next system.

* Year 1: (5% of cumulative grade)

The first semester includes Human and Cell Biology, Biochemistry, Medical Physics, Computer Science, English, and Human Rights; while the second semester includes Human and Cell Biology, Arabic, English, Medical Basics (Medical Ethics) and Immunology and Microbiology.

* Year 2: (5% of cumulative grade) includes Musculoskeletal System, Hematology, Cardiology and Pulmonology.
* Year 3: (5% of cumulative grade) includes Gastrointestinal Tract (GIT), Genitourinary Tract (GUT), Neurology and Endocrinology.
* Year 4: (20% of cumulative grade) includes Internal Medicine, Surgery, Pediatrics, Obstetrics and Gynecology, Community Medicine (Epidemiology) and Urology.
* Year 5: (25% of cumulative grade) includes Internal Medicine, Surgery, Forensic Medicine, Psychiatry, Ophthalmology, Dermatology and Otorhinolaryngology (ENT).
* Year 6: (40% of cumulative grade; 1% for a research project, 9% for courses exams, 30% for year 6 final exam) includes Family Medicine, Internal Medicine, Surgery, Pediatrics and Obstetrics and Gynecology.

The aforementioned year 6 exam tests the contents of not only the courses in year 6, but most courses in every year before it as well, with a major emphasis on clinical courses. After graduating, graduates have a grace period of 1 year before going into Rotating Residency. Graduates with the 10 (variable per year, according to the ministry) highest cumulative grades can voluntarily (and in some years, involuntarily, according to the ministry’s orders) become teaching assistants where they teach medical students in the same college they graduated in. The cumulative grade also decides what a student can match into in Senior Residency. Residents can choose whether to apply for the Arab Board or the Iraqi Board, the latter being generally cheaper for Iraqi citizens.

Graduates of medical colleges must undergo additional training before being permitted to practice medicine independently.

* Rotating Residency lasts for one year and takes place in public hospitals within the resident&#x27;s province/governorate. It typically involves rotations in internal medicine, general surgery, emergency medicine and obstetrics and gynecology. After this, a resident can begin Gradation.
* Gradation lasts for one year and usually requires the resident to serve in an underserved rural area within their province/governorate. Rotations are similar to that of Rotating Residency. After this, residents can specialize in a medical field of their choosing in Senior Residency.
* Senior Residency (equivalent to &quot;internship&quot; in the US) allows the resident to choose a specialty to be trained in privately for one year before going into Specialization. Specialties may be matched into based on the resident&#x27;s cumulative grade in medical college. A cumulative grade of 85% is considered high and would permit the graduate to choose from most, if not all, medical specialties. Prior to 2022, the medical cumulative grade was assessed on a national scale. Starting in 2022, it has been evaluated at the provincial level, meaning students from lacking governorates no longer have to compete with students from other, better governorates. During senior residency, physicians are titled &quot;Senior Resident Physician&quot; in their respective medical specialty.
* Specialization (equivalent to &quot;residency&quot; in the US) is the period where a resident thoroughly studies and practices a specific specialty in medicine, with most specialties completing 4 years of training. All who complete specialization are titled &quot;Specialized Physician&quot; in their respective medical specialty and can practice medicine freely.

===Israel===
There are five university medical schools in Israel: the Rappaport Faculty of Medicine at the Technion in Haifa, the Joyce and Irving Goldman Medical School at Ben Gurion University in Be&#x27;er Sheva, the Faculty of Medicine (former name &quot;Sackler Faculty of Medicine&quot;) at Tel Aviv University, the Hadassah School of Medicine at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem and the Azrieli Faculty of Medicine at Bar-Ilan University in Ramat Gan. These all follow the European 6-year model except Bar-Ilan University which has a four-year program similar to the US system.

The Technion Medical School, Ben Gurion University, and Tel Aviv University Faculty of Medicine offer 4-year MD programs for American Bachelor&#x27;s graduates who have taken the MCAT, interested in completing rigorous medical education in Israel before returning to the US or Canada.

The entrance requirements of the various schools of medicine are very strict. Israeli students require a high school Baccalaureate average above 100 and psychometric examination grade over 700.

The degree of Doctor of Medicine (MD) is legally considered to be equivalent to a master&#x27;s degree within the Israeli Educational System.

All medical school graduates must then pass a medical licensing exam and successfully complete a one-year internship. There are two kinds of internships:

* Straight internship is done in internal medicine, pediatrics or surgery. Interns spend two months in surgery, two months in pediatrics, one month in emergency medicine, and six consecutive months (the second half of the year) in a chosen specialty.
* Rotating internship offers a schedule that rotates through all major specialties—including three months of internal medicine (1 month may be substituted for geriatrics), two months of pediatrics (1 month may be substituted for a pediatric subspecialty), two months of surgery (1 month may be substituted for a surgical subspecialty), one month of emergency medicine, one month of anesthesiology and intensive care, and two elective months.

After completing their internship, graduates may practice general medicine or go into a specialty program.

===Jordan===
The Bachelor of Medicine and Surgery (MBBS) degree is awarded in Jordan after completion of six years comprising three years of medical sciences and three clinical years. Currently, six state supported universities include a medical school and grant the degree, which are:
* Jordan University of Science and Technology in Irbid
* University of Jordan in Amman
* Mutah University in Al Karak
* Hashemite University in Zarqa
* Yarmouk University in Irbid
* Al-Balqaʼ Applied University in Salt

Jordan&#x27;s undergraduate medical education started in the 1970s with the establishment of the first medical school in the University of Jordan. Their medical education system is well regarded in the region, thus attracting foreign students especially from around the Middle East (more than a third of all students). The sole admission criterion is a satisfactory mark in the high school national exam. Students with the highest mark gain admission through the general competition system (≈6% of applicants and ≈50% of all admissions). They are rewarded with partially subsidized inexpensive tuition fees. The rest of the admitted students are either foreigners or students that achieved high school marks of 85% or greater. The curricula is divided into an initial 3-year pre-clinical stage followed by 3 clinical years for a total of 6 years of education. The pre-clinical curriculum includes basic sciences, medical sciences and university required courses. In turn, the clinical curriculum includes clerkship rotations lasting from 2 to 12 weeks. At the end of the sixth year, students undergo a written theoretical assessment as well as a supervised clinical assessment. Passing students are awarded a Bachelor&#x27;s in Medicine and Surgery

===Lebanon===
In Lebanon, there are two programs of medical education followed: the American system (4 years) and the European system (6 years). Programs are offered in English and French.
Admission requirements to the American system requires a candidate to complete a bachelor&#x27;s degree along with specific pre-medical courses during the undergraduate years, and writing the MCAT examination.
European programs usually requires a candidate to complete 1 year of general science followed by a selection exam by the end of the year.

Schools following the American system (MD degree) are:
* American University of Beirut: located in Beirut and is the oldest medical school in Lebanon (established 1867). Training takes place at the American University of Beirut Medical center (AUBMC) in Beirut. It graduates ≈85 physicians per year.
* Lebanese American University (LAU Gilbert and Rose-Marie Chagoury School of Medicine): This program started in 2009. LAU Medical school is located in Byblos and has a 10-year affiliation with Partners Harvard Medical International. Training takes place at the University Medical center - Rizk Hospital (UMC-RH) located in Beirut. It is also affiliated with Clemenceau Medical Center and Rafik Hariri University Hospital. It graduates ≈50 physicians per year.
* University of Balamand: This program started in 2001. It is located in Koura, north Lebanon. Training takes place at the Saint George University Medical center in Beirut. It graduates ≈70 physicians per year.

===Pakistan===
In Pakistan a medical school is more often referred to as a medical college. A medical college is affiliated with a university as a department. There are however several medical universities and medical institutes with their own medical colleges. All medical colleges and universities are regulated by the respective provincial department of health. They however have to be recognized after meeting a set criteria by a central regulatory authority called Pakistan Medical and Dental Council (PMDC) in Islamabad. There are almost equal number of government and private medical colleges and universities, with their number exceeding 50. Admission to a government medical college is highly competitive. Entrance into the medical colleges is based on merit under the guidelines of PMDC. Both the academic performance at the college (high school, grades 11–12) level and an entrance test like MCAT are taken into consideration for the eligibility to enter most of the medical colleges. After successfully completing five years of academic and clinical training in the medical college and affiliated teaching hospitals the graduates are awarded a Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery (MBBS) degree. The graduates are then eligible to apply for a medical license from the PMDC. A house job of one-year duration is mandatory in a teaching hospital after completing five years of academic and clinical training in the medical college.

===Saudi Arabia===

In Saudi Arabia medical education is free for all Saudi citizens. A medical student must pass an entrance examination and complete a 1-year pre-medical course containing some basic medical subjects including: Biology, Organic Chemistry, Inorganic Chemistry, Physics, Medical Biostatistics, and English for medical uses. Passing this year is commonly considered as the most challenging. It offers an MBBS (Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery) degree. after one pre-medical course, five medical years and one training year.
By 2010, there are 24 medical schools in KSA- 21 nonprofit and three private medical schools.
The last college opened was Sulaiman AlRajhi Colleges with its partnership with Maastricht in the Netherlands.

===Syria===
Medical education in Syria consists of 6 years of training after high school. The first three include the basic sciences subjects, followed by 2 years of clinical clerkships. The sixth year also include clerkships in main specialties. Then, medical students are required to pass a standardized medical exam for graduation. Placement into residency programs is based on their scores in the exit exam in addition to their medical school cumulative grades in the context of their desires.

===Tunisia===
In Tunisia, education is free for all Tunisian citizens and for foreigners who have scholarships. The oldest Medical school is the Medicine School of Tunis. There are four medicine faculties situated in the major cities of Tunis, Sfax, Sousse and Monastir. Admission is bound to the success and score in the Tunisian Baccalaureate examination. Admission score threshold is very high, based on competition among all applicants throughout the nation. Medical school curriculum consists of seven years; five years as an &#x27;extern&#x27; and two years of internship or &#x27;intern trainee&#x27; :

* Two years are medical theory, containing all basic sciences related to medicine. The curriculum is more focused on theoretical than on practical learning.
* Three years during which the student receives both theoretical and practical training with total immersion in the hospital environment, it consists of clinical issues related to all medical specialties. During these three years, the student has to attend at the university hospital every day, rotating around all wards. Every period is followed by a clinical exam regarding the student&#x27;s knowledge in that particular specialty.
* Two years on internship, in which the student is a physician but under the supervision of the chief doctor; the student rotates over the major and most essential specialties during period of four months each. After that, student has the choice of either passing the residency national exam or extending his internship for another year, after which he gains the status of family physician. The residency program consists of four to five years in the specialty he qualifies, depending on his score in the national residency examination under the rule of highest score chooses first. Whether the student chooses to be a family doctor or a specialist, he has to make a doctorate thesis, which he will be defending in front of a jury, after which he gains his degree of Doctor of Medicine (MD).

In contrast, studies in dental medicine (general practitioner) and pharmaceutical studies last only 6 years. Courses throughout the university curriculum in both medicine and pharmacy are taught in French.

There are four universities of general medicine: the Faculty of Medicine of Tunis, the Faculty of Medicine Ibn El Jazzar of Sousse, the Faculty of Medicine of Monastir and the Faculty of Medicine of Sfax.

On the other hand, there is only one university of dentistry and pharmacy in Monastir: the faculty of dentistry of Monastir and the faculty of pharmacy of Monastir.

==North America==
=== Canada ===

As of 2013, the Association of American Medical Colleges lists 17 accredited MD-granting medical schools in Canada.

In Canada, a medical school is a faculty or school of a university that offers a three- or four-year Doctor of Medicine (MD) degree. Generally, medical students begin their studies after receiving a bachelor&#x27;s degree in another field, often one of the biological sciences. However, admittance can still be granted during the third and fourth year. Minimum requirements for admission vary by region from two to four years of post-secondary study. The Association of Faculties of Medicine of Canada publishes a detailed guide to admission requirements of Canadian faculties of medicine on a yearly basis.

Admission offers are made by individual medical schools, generally on the basis of a personal statement, undergraduate record (GPA), scores on the Medical College Admission Test (MCAT), and interviews. Volunteer work is often an important criterion considered by admission committees. All four medical schools in Quebec and two Ontario schools (the University of Ottawa, Northern Ontario School of Medicine) do not require the MCAT. McMaster requires that the MCAT be written, though they only look for particular scores (6 or better) on the verbal reasoning portion of the test.

The first half of the medical curriculum is dedicated mostly to teaching the basic sciences relevant to medicine. Teaching methods can include traditional lectures, problem-based learning, laboratory sessions, simulated patient sessions, and limited clinical experiences. The remainder of medical school is spent in clerkship. Clinical clerks participate in the day-to-day management of patients. They are supervised and taught during this clinical experience by residents and fully licensed staff physicians.

Students enter into the Canadian Resident Matching Service, commonly abbreviated as &quot;CaRMS&quot; in the fall of their final year. Students rank their preferences of hospitals and specialties. A computerized matching system determines placement for residency positions. &#x27;Match Day&#x27; usually occurs in March, a few months before graduation. The length of post-graduate training varies with choice of specialty.

During the final year of medical school, students complete part 1 of the Medical Council of Canada Qualifying Examination (MCCQE). Upon completion of the final year of medical school, students are awarded the degree of MD Students then begin training in the residency program designated to them by CaRMS. Part 2 of the MCCQE, an Objective Structured Clinical Examination, is taken following the completion of twelve months of residency training. After both parts of the MCCQE are successfully completed, the resident becomes a &quot;Licentiate of the Medical Council of Canada&quot;. In order to practice independently, however, the resident must complete the residency program and take a board examination pertinent to his or her intended scope of practice. In the final year of residency training, residents take an exam administered by either the College of Family Physicians of Canada or the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada, depending on whether they are seeking certification in family medicine or another specialty.

===United States===

In 2019, the Association of American Medical Colleges and American Association of Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine listed 154 accredited MD-granting and 36 accredited DO-granting medical schools in the United States.

There are two doctorate-level degrees conferred onto physicians in training in the United States, Doctor of Medicine (MD) and Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine (DO). Both entitle the awardee to train for and receive medical licensing through an accredited residency training program.

Admission to medical school in the United States is based mainly on a GPA, MCAT score, admissions essay, interview, clinical work experience, and volunteering activities, along with research and leadership roles in an applicant&#x27;s history. While obtaining an undergraduate degree is not an explicit requirement for a few medical schools, virtually all admitted students have earned at least a bachelor&#x27;s degree. A few medical schools offer pre-admittance to students directly from high school by linking a joint 3-year accelerated undergraduate degree and a standard 4-year medical degree with certain undergraduate universities, sometimes referred to as a &quot;7-year program&quot;, where the student receives a bachelor&#x27;s degree after their first year in medical school.

Typically, undergraduates students are expected to complete a series of prerequisites, consisting of biology, physics, and chemistry (general chemistry and organic chemistry). Many medical schools have additional requirements including calculus, genetics, statistics, biochemistry, English, and/or humanities classes. In addition to meeting the pre-medical requirements, medical school applicants must take and report their scores on the Medical College Admission Test (MCAT), a standardized test that measures a student&#x27;s knowledge of the sciences and the English language.

In the 19th century, there were over 400 medical schools in the United States. By 1910, the number was reduced to 148 medical schools and by 1930 the number totaled only 76. Many early medical schools were criticized for not sufficiently preparing their students for medical professions, leading to the creation of the American Medical Association in 1847 for the purpose of self-regulation of the profession. Abraham Flexner (who in 1910 released the Flexner report with the Carnegie Foundation), the Rockefeller Foundation, and the AMA are credited with laying the groundwork for what is now known as the modern medical curriculum.

The standard U.S. medical school curriculum is four years long. Traditionally, the first two years are composed mainly of classroom basic science education, while the final two years primarily include rotations in clinical settings where students learn patient care firsthand. Today, clinical education is spread across all four years with the final year containing the most clinical rotation time. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has published mandatory rules, obliging all inpatient and outpatient teaching settings, laying down the guidelines for what medical students in the United States may do, if they have not completed a clerkship or sub-internship. These rules apply when they are in the clinical setting in school, not when they are, for example, helping staff events or in other non-formal educational settings, even if they are helping provide certain clinical services along with nurses and the supervising physicians- for example, certain basic screening procedures.

Upon successful completion of medical school, students are granted the title of Doctor of Medicine (MD) or Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine (DO).

Each year, thousands of recent graduates and seniors from American medical schools, as well as foreign trained physicians participate in the National Resident Matching Program (NRMP) to secure clinical training positions in U.S. teaching hospitals. In 2023, a total of 42,952 active applicants competed for 37,425 PGY-1 positions and 2,950 PGY-2 positions.

In 2020, more than half of all medical schools had a four-year attendance cost exceeding $275,000, with 19 schools surpassing $350,000. This substantial financial burden impacts medical students as they pursue their education and training.

==Medical students==

A person accepted into a medical school and enrolled in an educational program in medicine, with the goal of becoming a medical doctor, is referred to as a &quot;medical student&quot;.

===Abuse in Medical School===

Medical students face verbal abuse, humiliation, and harassment in clinical settings, impacting their mental health and learning. Depressive symptoms affect 24–29% of medical students and 25–33% of resident physicians. Approximately 14% of students experience moderate to severe depression, with 5% having suicidal thoughts during training. German and South Korean medical students have even higher depression rates. Seeking treatment is challenging due to faculty judgment and lack of social support. The COVID-19 pandemic worsened mental health issues among medical students.

<text>C-Tran (stylized as C-TRAN), more formally the Clark County Public Transit Benefit Area Authority, is a public transit agency serving Clark County, Washington, United States, including the cities of Battle Ground, Camas, Vancouver, Washougal, and Yacolt. Founded in 1981, C-Tran operates fixed route bus services within Clark County, as well as paratransit services for qualified persons with disabilities (C-Van) and a dial-a-ride service in Camas, Ridgefield, and La Center (The Current). C-Tran also provides express commuter services between Clark County and Downtown Portland, Oregon and regional services to the Parkrose/Sumner and Delta Park MAX Light Rail stations (in northeast and north Portland), and Oregon Health and Science University. In , the system had a ridership of , or about per weekday as of .

C-Tran operates four transit centers: Vancouver Mall, Fisher&#x27;s Landing in east county, 99th Street at Stockford Village, and Mill Plain near Camas, as well as three park and rides: Salmon Creek, Evergreen, and Andresen. Twenty-nine transit routes operate to serve the approximately 350,000 residents of Clark County, while C-Tran&#x27;s 108 transit coaches and 52 paratransit coaches travel over 

== History ==
=== Pre-2000 ===
The Clark County public transportation benefit area was approved by 55 percent of voters on November 4, 1980, along with a 0.3 percent sales tax, and formally established on January 1, 1981. The agency branded itself as &quot;C-Tran&quot; and took over the Vancouver Transit System on July 6, 1981. The Vancouver system was originally established in May 1969 and was supplemented by Tri-Met express service from Portland that began in 1976. The Tri-Met service continued under contract after C-Tran was established and gradually phased out.

=== Service increases and reorganization in 2000 ===
On July 1, 2000, C-Tran opened a transit center facility in Fisher&#x27;s Landing, replacing the Evergreen Transit Center (now Evergreen Park &amp; Ride) as its east county hub. Along with the opening of Fisher&#x27;s Landing Transit Center, many lines serving east Clark County and the Vancouver Mall area were rerouted and had their frequency increased. Fisher&#x27;s Landing Transit Center links eastern Vancouver with Camas, Washougal and Parkrose (in northeast Portland, Oregon). Around the same time, C-Tran changed its transfer design to conform with that of TriMet, allowing C-Tran riders to use its transfer to ride on any route in any direction (unlike previously, in which C-Tran transfers were marked with the route number to prevent riders from using it to make a round trip or a stop-over). The &quot;Day Code&quot; on a C-Tran transfer (and today, C-Tran Day Pass) is identical to that of TriMet, consisting of two letters out of the eight-letter pool: M, J, I, E, X, D, B and C.

=== Clark County Proposition 1 (2004) ===
In November 2004, a ballot initiative known as Proposition 1 was defeated by a simple majority of voters. While 46.33% of eligible voters, or 73,959 ballots, approved this measure to increase the Clark County sales tax by 0.3% (from the current 7.7%) to continue the funding of the public transportation, 53.67% (85,684 votes) rejected the proposition.

The Proposition 1 was intended to provide continued funding sources for C-Tran after the 1998 statewide repeal of Washington motor vehicle registration tax.

As a result of the lost revenue, effective September 25, 2005, C-Tran could have reduced its services by 46%, effectively eliminating about a half of currently existing bus and paratransit services. The planned service reduction would have eliminated all services to the north beyond Salmon Creek Park &amp; Ride, including commuter services to Ridgefield; all services to the east beyond Fisher&#x27;s Landing Transit Center, discontinuing all Camas and Washougal services including the Connector; end all Vancouver-Central Portland express bus services; and drastically reduced the frequency of surviving routes (except for the 165-Parkrose Express, whose services would be increased).

Vancouver–Central Portland commuter lines would have been replaced by 205 – Interstate 5 Shuttle, 234 – Salmon Creek Shuttle and 257 – BPA Shuttle, all of which would have terminated at TriMet&#x27;s Delta Park/Vanport MAX Station.

In addition to major downsizing of services, C-Tran proposed closing two park and ride lots, reducing service center hours, ending service day at 8 pm weekdays and ending most weekend runs. As a result, C-Tran intended to also lay off a large number of employees.

To offset lost revenues, the C-Tran board of directors also considered a fare increase, elimination of free transfers and termination of reciprocal fare agreement with TriMet.

Most of these service reductions were avoided after C-Tran passed a special ballot measure in September 2005. C-Tran still operates all commuter lines to and from downtown Portland&#x27;s Transit Mall.

=== New fare structure and 2005 service reductions ===
In May 2005, as the first phase of the two-part service reduction strategy, C-Tran introduced a new fare structure. Under this scheme, the previously All-Zone commuter services between Portland, Oregon and Clark County with the sole exception of the 165 – Parkrose Express were designated &quot;Premium&quot; routes (i.e., Routes 105, 114 that originate in Portland as &quot;105–114&quot;, 134, 157, 164, 177 and 190 are all Premium services). No regular monthly or all-day passes from either TriMet or C-Tran were accepted on the Premium buses, unless a passenger purchased a $105 Premium pass (which is also valid as an All-Zone pass in C-Tran, Portland Streetcar and TriMet). A single-ride fare on a Premium bus became $3. Fares on Premium buses were collected as passengers board, and previously-allowed free rides within Portland&#x27;s Fareless Square between Portland State University and the Pearl District were eliminated.

C-Tran issues and accepts All-Zone transfers upon request. Passengers who use a C-Zone fare must pay each time they board the bus or purchase a Day Pass, either a C-Zone day pass valid only on C-Tran Local and Limited routes or a GoAnywhere Express Day pass which is also valid on TriMet and the Portland Streetcar. Pursuant to the fare reciprocity agreement, C-Tran and TriMet continue to honor each other&#x27;s All-Zone fare instruments.

C-Tran would have been forced to eliminate nearly half of all its transit services effective September 25, 2005 if additional funding had not been secured; however, a second ballot measure was passed that allowed for the preservation of current service levels (at that time), and additional service to be added to smaller cities such as Ridgefield and La Center. These changes helped return service to its pre-2000 levels.

=== C-Tran redistricting and new C-Tran benefit area ballot measure ===
On June 1, 2005, the boundaries of the Clark County Public Transit Benefit Area were reduced from the whole Clark County to the area including only the cities of Vancouver, Camas, Washougal, Ridgefield, La Center, Battle Ground and Yacolt, as well as the unincorporated areas surrounding Vancouver. This was done so that, unlike in the failed 2004 Proposition 1, only those who would benefit from C-Tran services will vote on any future ballot measure to secure new funding for the transit service.

C-Tran proposed a special election in September 2005 to decide on whether residents within the new C-Tran benefit area would pay an additional 0.2% (from 7.7% to 7.9% in Vancouver) sales tax to maintain the current C-Tran service level.

The measure passed by a wide majority. The agency continues to operate, and now with fresh funding, is expanding.

=== 2010s to today ===

After studies that had first taken place in 2008, plans were approved and finalized in 2012 for construction of a bus rapid transit line, eventually named The Vine (see section below). It opened for service in January 2017. In 2016–2017, C-Tran built a new transit center at Vancouver Mall, to replace an existing transit center on the mall&#x27;s north side (opened in 1985) with a larger facility on the mall&#x27;s south side. The new Vancouver Mall Transit Center opened in January 2017, on the same date that the Vine service began operating.

In June 2017, C-Tran hired Shawn M. Donaghy as its next Chief Executive Officer, under a contract that was scheduled to last through June 2027. He replaced Jeff Hamm, who retired after more than 10 years as the agency&#x27;s chief executive. The agency was named the North American Transit System of the Year in 2019 by the American Public Transportation Association.

The agency moved its administrative headquarters in 2019 to a standalone building on NE 51st Circle in Vancouver. This building was formerly the offices of the supervisor of the Gifford Pinchot National Forest.

In June 2020, the former Evergreen Transit Center was converted to a safe parking site for persons experiencing homelessness.

In September 2022, C-Tran was again named the North American Transit System of the Year by the American Public Transportation Association.

The Mill Plain Transit Center was opened on October 1, 2023, as the terminus of the Vine Red Line.

In February 2024, the C-Tran Board of Directors appointed Leann M. Caver as the agency&#x27;s sixth Chief Executive Officer starting March 1. Caver was previously the agency&#x27;s Deputy Chief Executive Officer. She replaces Shawn Donaghy, who moved on from the agency after nearly seven years as the agency&#x27;s chief executive.

== Service ==

C-Tran operates seven days a week. Sunday and holiday services are reduced, with trips to and from Portland being less frequent, and some express and limited routes may not run. Local service starts at about 6:15 am and ends about midnight. Weekday express and limited service to Portland begins at 5:20 am with the last trip to Vancouver at 7 pm. On weekends, there is no service to Portland excluding the 60 (Delta Park Limited) to Delta Park/Vanport MAX Station and Jantzen Beach and the 65 (Parkrose Limited) to Parkrose/Sumner Transit Center. Weekend service on route 60 starts at about 6:30 am and the last trip from Delta Park/Vanport departs at midnight. Weekend service on route 65 starts at about 8:30 am with the last trip to Vancouver departing at about 6:40 pm. The Current (formerly known as the Connector), a dial-a-ride service, runs from 5:30 am to 7:00 pm on weekdays.
C-Tran operates 17 local routes along with &quot;C-Van&quot; paratransit and the Current, a dial-a-ride service. Most routes can be expected to run every 15 to 70 minutes. The most-used routes are The Vine and the 71 (Highway 99).

C-Tran operates three express routes to the Portland Transit Mall. A ride on all these buses require an express fare, and transfers issued on these routes are valid for travel on all C-Tran and TriMet routes. In addition, C-Tran operates three limited-stop routes; the 41 serves Fisher&#x27;s Landing Transit Center and Downtown Vancouver. Route 60 serves TriMet&#x27;s Delta Park/Vanport MAX Station, while route 65 connects to TriMet&#x27;s Parkrose/Sumner Transit Center.
== The Vine ==
The Vine is a bus rapid transit service along Fourth Plain Boulevard and Fort Vancouver Way between downtown Vancouver and Vancouver Mall. Ten new low-floor, articulated, hybrid buses provide service every 10–15 minutes in mixed traffic to curbside stations. The Vine replaced routes 4 and 44, which collectively carried over 6,000 trips daily. Among the project&#x27;s expected benefits were that transit signal priority and off-board fare collection would increase the speed of the bus by about ten minutes compared to existing service. Studies on the corridor began in 2008, and funding for the $53 million project was approved in July 2014, with 80% federal money, 6% state, and 14% local. A full funding grant agreement for $38.5 million from the Federal Transit Administration was signed on September 10, 2015.

Construction began with a groundbreaking ceremony held at the planned downtown terminus on August 24, 2015, and finished in January 2017. A grand opening ceremony was held on January 7, 2017, and it officially opened on January 8, 2017. The original line on Fourth Plain was later renamed the Green Line.

In 2018, C-Tran proposed the Mill Plain BRT, a new bus line to the Vine system that connects downtown Vancouver to the newly constructed Mill Plain Transit Center via Mill Plain Blvd. Service started on October 1, 2023, as the Red Line. A third line on Old Highway 99 between Downtown Vancouver and Salmon Creek is planned to begin construction in 2025 and open in 2027.

== Fares ==

C-Tran has a regular adult fare of $1.25 for local routes, $2.50 for regional routes, and $3.00 for express routes. The agency offers reduced rates for eligible &quot;Honored Citizens&quot; who qualify based on age, disability, or Medicare enrollment. Fares can be paid with a Hop Fastpass card, monthly passes, cash, contactless credit and debit cards, and mobile payment platforms such as Apple Pay, Google Pay, and Samsung Pay. Since 2022, all fares for youth riders have been free due to a statewide program.

Transfers to TriMet services are accepted for Hop Fastpass card and contactless payments within a 2.5-hour period. The regional and express fares are charged only when crossing the Columbia River into Portland. The Hop Fastpass system debuted in July 2017 and replaced previous paper transfers.

== Fleet ==

C-Tran has several &quot;community buses&quot; that are wrapped in photographs and designs to reflect local communities in Clark County. They debuted in 2019 and include seven city wraps and an eighth for unincorporated Clark County. The agency used Gillig Phantom buses from 1990 until the complete retirement of the fleet in October 2024; one bus, coach 1776, was retained for use at special events due to its eagle-and-flag livery.

<text>The Mittelland Canal, also known as the Midland Canal, (, ) is a major canal in central Germany. It forms an important link in the waterway network of the country, providing the principal east-west inland waterway connection. Its significance goes beyond Germany as it links France, Switzerland and the Benelux countries with Poland, the Czech Republic and the Baltic Sea.

At in length, the Mittelland Canal is the longest artificial waterway in Germany.

== Route ==
The Mittelland Canal branches off the Dortmund-Ems Canal at Hörstel (near Rheine, at ), runs north along the Teutoburg Forest, past Hanover and meets with the Elbe River near Magdeburg (). Near Magdeburg it connects to the Elbe-Havel Canal, making a continuous shipping route to Berlin and on to Poland.

At Minden the canal crosses the river Weser over two aqueducts (completed in 1914 and 1998, respectively), and near Magdeburg it crosses the Elbe, also with an aqueduct. Connections by side canals exist at Ibbenbüren, Osnabrück, Minden (two canals connecting to the Weser), Hanover-Linden, Hanover-Misburg, Hildesheim and Salzgitter. West of Wolfsburg, the Elbe Lateral Canal branches off, providing a connection to Hamburg, and (via the Elbe-Lübeck Canal) to the Baltic Sea.

==History==

Construction of the Mittelland Canal was started in 1906, starting from Bergeshövede (municipality Hörstel) on the Dortmund-Ems Canal. The section to Minden on the Weser was opened in February 1915 and was initially named &quot;Ems-Weser-Kanal&quot;. The section from Minden to Hanover was finished in the autumn of 1916. The section to Sehnde and the branch canal to Hildesheim were completed in 1928, Peine was reached in 1929, and Braunschweig in 1933. The final section to Magdeburg was opened in 1938, thus creating a direct link between Western and Eastern Germany. The branch canal to Salzgitter was opened in 1941. The planned canal bridge over the Elbe, necessary to avoid low water conditions in summer, was not built due to the Second World War.

After partitioning of Germany following the Second World War, the Mittelland Canal was split between West Germany and East Germany, with the border to the east of Wolfsburg. To provide access from the western section of the canal to Hamburg and Northern Germany, avoiding both East Germany and the Elbe River&#x27;s sometimes limited navigability, the Elbe Lateral Canal was opened in 1977.

After the reunification of Germany, the importance of the Mittelland Canal as a link from the west to Berlin and the east was reinforced. The project to bridge the Elbe was therefore restarted, and the resulting Magdeburg Water Bridge opened in 2003, providing a direct link to the Elbe-Havel Canal. There are further plans to connect the channel to the Twentekanaal in the Netherlands to shorten the connection towards the Port of Rotterdam.

<text>United Nations General Assembly Resolution 1761 was passed on 6 November 1962 in response to the racist policies of apartheid established by the South African Government.

== Condemnation of apartheid ==
The resolution deemed apartheid and the policies enforcing it to be a violation of South Africa&#x27;s obligations under the UN Charter and a threat to international peace and security.

== Call for a voluntary boycott ==
Additionally, the resolution requested Member States to break off diplomatic relations with South Africa, to cease trading with South Africa (arms exports in particular), and to deny passage to South African ships and aircraft.

== Establishment of the UN Special Committee on Apartheid ==
The resolution also established the United Nations Special Committee against Apartheid. The committee was originally boycotted by the Western nations, because of their disagreement with the aspects of the resolution calling for the boycott of South Africa. Even so, the committee found allies in the West, such as the British-based Anti-Apartheid Movement, through which it could work and lay the ground roots for the eventual acceptance by the Western powers of the need to impose economic sanctions on South Africa to pressure for political changes.

<doc id="465595" wikidata="Q156169" url="?curid=465595" title="Juncaceae">
<text>Juncaceae is a family of flowering plants, commonly known as the rush family. It consists of 8 genera and about 464 known species of slow-growing, rhizomatous, herbaceous monocotyledonous plants that may superficially resemble grasses and sedges. They often grow on infertile soils in a wide range of moisture conditions. The best-known and largest genus is &quot;Juncus&quot;. Most of the &quot;Juncus&quot; species grow exclusively in wetland habitats. A few rushes, such as &quot;Juncus bufonius&quot; are annuals, but most are perennials. Despite the apparent similarity, Juncaceae are not counted among the plants with the vernacular name bulrush.

==Description==
The leaves are evergreen and well-developed in a basal aggregation on an erect stem. They are alternate and tristichous (i.e., with three rows of leaves up the stem, each row of leaves arising one-third of the way around the stem from the previous leaf). Only in the genus &quot;Distichia&quot; are the leaves distichous. The rushes of the genus &quot;Juncus&quot; have flat, hairless leaves or cylindrical leaves. The leaves of the wood-rushes of the genus &quot;Luzula&quot; are always flat and bear long white hairs.

The plants are bisexual or, rarely, dioecious. The small flowers are arranged in inflorescences of loose cymes, but also in rather dense heads or corymbs at the top of the stem or at its side. This family typically has reduced perianth segments called tepals. These are usually arranged in two whorls, each containing three thin, papery tepals. They are not bright or flashy in appearance, and their color can vary from greenish to whitish, brown, purple, black, or hyaline. The three stigmas are in the center of the flowers. As is characteristic of monocots, all of the flower parts appear in multiples of three.

The fruit is usually a nonfleshy, three-sectioned dehiscent capsule containing many seeds.

== Uses ==
The dried pith of plants of this family is used to make a lighting implement known as a rushlight.

The common rush (&quot;Juncus effusus&quot;) is called in Japanese and is used to weave the soft surface cover of tatami mats.

In medieval Europe, loose fresh rushes would be strewn on earthen floors in dwellings for cleanliness and insulation. Particularly favored for such a purpose was &quot;Acorus calamus&quot; (sweet flag), but despite its alternate vernacular name &quot;sweet rush&quot;, it is a plant from a different monocot order, Acorales. Up until the 1960s in Ireland, rushes were spread on the earthen floor of homes during wet weather to help keep the floor dry during periods of snow or rain, or during hot weather to keep rooms cool. Rushes used in Ireland included &quot;Juncus effusus&quot;, &quot;Juncus glaucus&quot;, and &quot;Juncus conglomeratus&quot;.

The stems and leaves of &quot;Juncus kraussii&quot; were used by Indigenous Australians for fibre, for string, fishing lines, woven rugs and woven baskets. It is commonly used today for stabilisation of the banks of estuaries, around salt marshes and riparian zones next to sites developed for human use. It is also used in biofiltration systems and rain gardens.

<text>Events in the year 1921 in [[Germany]].

==Incumbents==

===National level===

* President - Friedrich Ebert (Social Democrats)

* Chancellor - Constantin Fehrenbach (Centre) (to 10 May), Joseph Wirth (Centre) (from 10 May)

==Overview==
Almost all of the most important events in Germany in 1921 were connected with questions arising out of the provisions of the Treaty of Versailles, disarmament, reparations, trials of war criminals, and the plebiscite in Upper Silesia—questions that, from their harassing nature, kept both government and people in constant suspense and agitation.

==Troubles complying with the Treaty of Versailles==

===Disarmament===

The Protocol of Spa had threatened Germany with new sanctions in the form of further occupation of German territory if Germany did not continue on its schedule of war reparations. But the threat was suspended, and the matter of disarmament was referred to a conference of ministers at Paris at the end of January. This conference not only drew up a plan for Germany&#x27;s reparation obligations, but also fixed eight dates for the fulfilment of all disarmament demands. The most important of these dates were for the delivery of the remaining war material (February 28), the repeal of a new Reichswehr law, with the absolute abolition of conscription for the Reich and the single states (March 15), the surrender of all heavy and of two-thirds of the small firearms belonging to the organizations for self-protection (March 31), the disarmament of all ships in reserve (April 30), the complete disbandment of all organizations of defense and the surrender of the remainder of their arms (June 30), and lastly (July 31), the destruction of warships in the process of construction, with the exception of those transformed with the assent of the Allies into mercantile vessels.

===War reparations===

The Paris conference of ministers, which commenced on January 24, formulated a plan by which Germany was to pay 226,000 million Goldmarks in forty-two fixed annuities from May 1, 1921, to May 1, 1963, aing annuities each equal to 12% of German exports. This plan was communicated to the German government, along with the announcement that in case of non-fulfilment sanctions in the terms of the Spa Protocol would be applied.

This communication of the Paris conference caused intense agitation in Germany. Speaking in the Reichstag the foreign minister, Walter Simons, characterized the Paris demands as impossible to fulfill, as an infringement of the Treaty of Versailles, and as involving the economic enslavement captures of the German people. He declared in the name of the government that the proposed plan could not be regarded as a basis for further negotiations. With the exception of the Communist Party, the leaders of the parliamentary groups endorsed the declaration of the government.

Through the chairman of the Paris conference, the German government were invited to send a representative on March 1 to London, to discuss the reparation question. The government accepted the invitation, but smarting from their experiences at Versailles and Spa, the German government wanted to make sure that their views would be well represented.

The German delegates had a difficult time putting effective counterproposals together due to their philosophical differences, so all of the proposals were ultimately rejected. In a later sitting British Prime Minister David Lloyd George informed the German delegates that their proposals would not meet with serious consideration. In addition, he allowed them a fixed time to agree with the substance of the decision of the Paris conference. If they failed to agree, George threatened Germany with Allied reoccupation of Duisburg, Ruhrort, and Düsseldorf, the raising of tribute from the sale price of German goods in the Allied countries, and the erection of a customs frontier on the Rhine, under the supervision of the Allies.

The government protested to the League of Nations, but without effect. The military occupation of the three cities mentioned took place immediately, and was extended to other places as well, while the special customs frontier on the Rhine was drawn on two dates, April 20 and May 10. On each occasion protests were made from the German side, which received no more attention than those that preceded them. On the other hand, the action of the Reparations Commission in fixing further dates for the payment of enormous sums by Germany was scarcely noticed, public attention being almost wholly centred on the approach of May 1, the date assigned for the first payment of reparations.

Simultaneously the President of the German Reich Friedrich Ebert issued a proclamation, countersigned by the chancellor, Constantin Fehrenbach, to the effect that the Allies had occupied areas of Germany in defiance to the Treaty of Versailles and that they would not object to outside help in the matter.

===Occupied Rhineland===

In the occupied territories of the Rhineland, the edicts of the occupation authorities, especially the French, led to many conflicts between them and the German administration. The German commissioner, von Stark, who had several times protested against decrees of the Inter-Allied Rhineland Commission, was threatened with expulsion by the president of the commission, and to avoid this he resigned voluntarily. His successor, the Prince of Hatzfeld-Wildenburg, was only admitted after long negotiations, and on condition that he promised to abstain from all obstruction and to cooperate loyally with the Rhineland Commission. Complaints, however, of arbitrary decisions of the commission have continued to abound, especially in regard to the execution of justice and the administration of schools. Up to March 31, the cost of the occupation to Germany was 4 milliards of Goldmark and 7 milliards of Papiermark (paper mark).

===Trials of war criminals===

Along with the questions of disarmament and reparation, punishment of German war criminals was a matter that kept Germany in continual anxiety and unrest. The government attempted to fulfill the war crime obligations it had agreed to. Nine of these trials took place before the Supreme Court, from May 23 onwards. Several cases ended in an acquittal of the accused, but most were followed by imprisonment or incarceration in a fortress. A British delegation headed by the solicitor-general, Sir Ernest Pollock, attended the first trials, in which cases brought on the demand of the United Kingdom were heard. The other trials were similarly attended by a French or Belgian delegation. The acquittal of General Karl Stenger, who was accused by the French of having had French prisoners shot, caused the French government to recall its legal mission and the French witnesses.

===Upper Silesia plebiscite===

The clause of the Treaty of Versailles demanding a plebiscite in Upper Silesia was next taken in hand. The German government had already declared during the negotiations in London that the possession of Upper Silesia was indispensable to Germany if she was to fulfill her obligations in regard to reparations. After some negotiation the plebiscite was fixed for March 20, and resulted in 717,122 votes being cast for Germany against 483,514 for Poland, the result very different from the last 1910 census, where Poles had clear 60% majority.

With the results of the Plebiscite making the ultimate fate of Upper Silesia unclear, fighting erupted in the province between insurgent Polish forces and German militias. The Germanophone section of the population made strong complaints, being firmly convinced that the French division of the Upper Silesian army of occupation was favouring the insurrection by refusing to do anything.

Twelve days after the start of the uprising, Wojciech Korfanty offered to take his Upper Silesian forces behind a line of demarcation, on condition that the released territory would not be occupied by German forces, but by Allied troops. It was not, however, until July 1 that the British troops arrived in Upper Silesia and began to advance in company with those of the Allies towards the former frontier. Simultaneously with this advance the Inter-Allied Commission pronounced a general amnesty for the illegal actions committed during the recent violence, with the exception of acts of revenge and cruelty. The German defense force was finally withdrawn and disbanded and quiet was restored.

As the Supreme Council was unable to come to an agreement on the partition of the Upper Silesian territory on the lines of the plebiscite, a solution was found by turning the question over to the Council of the League of Nations. Agreements between the Germans and Poles in Upper Silesia and appeals issued by both sides, as well as the despatch of six battalions of Allied troops and the disbandment of the local guards, contributed markedly to the pacification of the district. On the basis of the reports of a League of Nations commission and those of its experts, the Council awarded the greater part of the Upper Silesian industrial district to Poland. Poland obtained almost exactly half of the 1,950,000 inhabitants, &quot;viz.&quot;, 965,000, but not quite a third of the territory, &quot;i.e.&quot;, only 3,214.26 km2 (1,255 mi2) out of 10,950.89 km2 (4,265 mi2).

German and Polish officials, under a League of Nations recommendation, agreed to come up with protections of minority interests that would last for 15 years. Special measures were threatened in case either of the two states should refuse to participate in the drawing up of such regulations, or to accept them subsequently.

Polish Government had decided to give Upper Silesia considerable Autonomy with Silesian Parliament as a constituency and Silesian Voivodship Council as the executive body.

==Politics==

===Resignation of Fehrenbach government===

In the middle of all of these troubles with the Treaty of Versailles the cabinet of Chancellor Constantin Fehrenbach resigned on May 10. In the meantime the Reparations Commission had fixed the sum of Germany&#x27;s debt at 132 milliard Goldmark, besides having stated that by May 1, when the German debt became due, a further sum of 12 milliard Goldmark for reconstruction of demolished industrial works was to be paid. As a kind of guarantee, the commission demanded that the gold treasure of the Reichsbank and of certain other banking-houses should be transported to the occupied territory. Before these claims could be met, they were replaced by the ultimatum of the Allied governments, which gave the German government until May 12, under threat of occupation of the Ruhr valley, to declare that they had decided unreservedly to fulfil the obligations drawn up by the commission, to accept all of its dictated guarantees, to carry out immediately and without reserve the measures prescribed in regard to disarmament, and, finally, to proceed without delay to try the war criminals.

===Joseph Wirth&#x27;s first government===

After many days of trying negotiations, which at times made it seem it would be impossible to form any German government whatsoever, the Minister of Finance of the preceding government, Dr. Joseph Wirth, managed to form a coalition cabinet willing to accept the ultimatum as it stood (May 10). Members of the Centre, Majority Socialist, and Social Democratic parties constituted the greater part of this new cabinet, in which three vacancies were left temporarily, the other appointments being as follows:

*Dr. Joseph Wirth (Centre Party) – Reich chancellor and minister of finance
*Gustav Bauer (Social Democratic (SPD)) – vice-chancellor and Minister of the Reich treasury
*Friedrich Rosen, Minister of Foreign Affairs
*Dr. Georg Gradnauer (SPD) – Minister of the Interior
*Robert Schmidt (SPD), Minister of Economics
*Dr. Heinrich Brauns (Centre) – Minister of Labour
*Dr. Eugen Schiffer (SPD) – Minister of Justice
*Dr. Otto Gessler (SPD) – Minister of Defense
*Wilhelm Groener – Minister of Transportation
*Johannes Giesberts (Centre) – Minister of the Post
*Dr. Andreas Hermes (Centre) – Minister of Food
*Walther Rathenau (Democrat) – Minister of Reconstruction

The three middle parties of the Reichstag, who desired a genuine democracy, supported the new cabinet. The German People&#x27;s Party also was willing on certain conditions to join the coalition and to sign the ultimatum. In the end, the majority was composed of the Centre Party, the Social Democrats, Independent Social Democrats, and certain members of the People&#x27;s Party.

A certain lull in the storm over the reparations question took place during the following months. The first gold milliard had been paid on August 31, and only the % fall in the value of the mark, which later depreciated to a still greater degree, indicated approaching peril. Although no further doubt was cast on Germany&#x27;s will to pay, the Allies failed to repeal the military sanctions of March 9. The trade sanctions came to an end on September 30, but not without a burdensome commission of contract having been instituted in their place.

In order to further Germany&#x27;s work of reconstruction in the north of France, the two ministers, Walther Rathenau and Louis Loucheur, conferred several times at Wiesbaden in August and September, in regard to the delivery by Germany of the necessary material. Germany agreed to deliveries that were to be credited as payment, but were not to exceed the value of 7 milliard Goldmark by May 1, 1926.

The growing sense that the Reich would never be able to meet their reparation obligations led to bankers using private foreign credit at the disposal of the Reich. The reparation payments discharged in this manner were to be credited to industry for taxes, to amounts to be stated at a later date. This plan was well received at first. But certain tendencies that subsequently manifested themselves among the great industrials led to failure of this push to use foreign credit. To meet its debt, the German government had also tried to negotiate a loan with a foreign banking-house of £25,000,000, and had been rebuffed with a pertinent reference to the reparation burden. Thereupon the government declared to the Reparations Commission in December that the two following instalments, due on January 15 and February 15, of 500,000,000 Goldmark and about 250,000,000 Goldmark respectively, could only be paid in part, and a delay was requested. Thus at the end of the year the problem of reparations had again become acute.

===Joseph Wirth&#x27;s second government===

After the official publication of this decision, Chancellor Wirth, considering that his task had been rendered impossible, resigned with the whole of his cabinet. After vain attempts to reorganize the cabinet on a broader basis by including members of the German People&#x27;s Party, the president of the republic again entrusted Wirth with the formation of the cabinet, a task he soon accomplished (October 26). Wirth&#x27;s 2nd cabinet included:

*Wirth (Centre) – chancellor and acting minister of foreign affairs
*Bauer (SPD) – Vice-chancellor and Minister of the treasury
*Adolf Köster (SPD) – minister of the interior
*Dr. Heinrich Brauns (Centre) – Minister of Labour
*Dr. Andreas Hermes (Centre) – Minister of Food Supply and Agriculture, and Acting Minister of Finance, 
*Dr. Otto Gessler (DDP) – Minister of defense
*Wilhelm Groener – Minister of Transport and Communication
*Johannes Giesberts (Centre) – Minister of Post
*Robert Schmidt (SPD) – Minister of Economy
*Dr. Gustav Radbruch (SPD) – Minister of Justice

A vote of confidence in the new government was passed by 230 votes to 132, the minority consisting of the two parties of the right and the Communists.

==State of German finances==

Sharp criticism was levelled in Parliament and in the press against the extreme slowness with which long overdue taxes were being collected. The slowness in tax collection was partly attributable to the overworked condition of revenue and taxation officials. The sensational drop in the value of the mark due to inflation in the Weimar Republic made the financial position still more deplorable, and produced at the end of the year an unprecedented rise in prices. It also led to a positive inundation of the large western towns with buyers from the countries with high exchange. This resulted in Germany being drained of goods without receiving a fair equivalent. The stimulus given to trade and industry, though it certainly reduced unemployment to a minimum, was no compensation, because the export of manufactures involved a continual decrease of German assets. Eventually, all of these factors would lead to the mark being devalued to as little as 4.2 mark to the United States dollar.

==Communist rising and right-wing violence==

In March, there was a Communist rising in central Germany, accompanied by violence, murder, and pillage. Max Hoelz, the leader of the insurrection was captured and tried before a special court in Berlin, which sentenced him to imprisonment for life and loss of civic rights. The rest of those involved in the insurrection were also tried by special courts and condemned to imprisonment for varying periods. A large proportion of those who took a subordinate part in the insurrection were amnestied.

On the other hand, the supporters of a royalist and military system, including 40,000 ex-officers of the old army as well as a relatively large number of landowners, higher officials, and the middle classes in the towns, did not openly rise against the republic. However, their insults to the new black, red, and gold German flag and bitter attacks on the representatives of the republic in the press and in public speeches became more frequent. Two political murders that appeared to be a product of this spirit showed that the political temperature had risen. In June, Karl Gareis, the leader of the local Independent Socialist Party, was murdered at Munich, and on August 25 Matthias Erzberger, the former minister of finance, was murdered.

The murderer of Gareis could not be found, but it was widely taken for granted that the murder was a political act. Erzberger&#x27;s murderers were identified as two young men, apparently nationalist fanatics.

Both murders, especially that of Erzberger, created an extremely bitter feeling among the working classes. Public demonstrations were held in favour of the republic, and both Socialist parties took steps to draw the attention of the chancellor to the dangers of the situation, and to demand energetic measures against those who had organized the agitation and who were to be considered morally responsible for the recent crimes.

On August 29, the president issued a decree, based on Article 48 of the German constitution, authorizing an anti-sedition act that would last for at least 14 days. The decree inspired opposition on all sides, and it was repealed on December 24 by a vote of the Reichstag after being in force barely four months.

==Foreign affairs==

Some important agreements and treaties with foreign states were concluded during the year. On May 6 an economic agreement was concluded with the Russian Soviet Republic, and a German delegation under Professor Kurt Wiedenfeld was sent to Moscow. Peace with the United States was signed in Berlin on August 25, and was ratified by the German Reichstag on September 30 and by the American Senate on October 19. A treaty with China, proclaiming a state of peace between the two countries, was made on May 20. A treaty was concluded with Switzerland on December 3, which set up a court of arbitration to deal with disputes between the two countries. A series of economic treaties with Czechoslovakia, Italy, and the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes must be added, as well as a treaty of preference with Portugal. An agreement with the United Kingdom concerning the partial restoration of German private property was concluded on January 12.

<text>The State University of New York at Buffalo (commonly referred to as UB, University at Buffalo, and sometimes SUNY Buffalo) is a public research university in Buffalo and Amherst, New York, United States. The university was founded in 1846 as a private medical college and merged with the State University of New York system in 1962. It is one of two flagship institutions of the SUNY system, along with Stony Brook University. As of fall 2023, the university enrolled nearly 32,000 students in 13 schools and colleges, making it the largest public university in the state of New York.

Since its founding by a group which included future United States President Millard Fillmore, the university has evolved from a small medical school to a large research university. Today, in addition to the College of Arts and Sciences, the university houses the largest state-operated medical school, dental school, education school, business school, engineering school, and pharmacy school, and is also home to SUNY&#x27;s only law school. UB has the largest enrollment, largest endowment, and most research funding among the universities in the SUNY system. The university offers bachelor&#x27;s degrees in over 140 areas of study, as well as over 220 master&#x27;s programs and over 95 doctoral programs, and 55 combined degree programs. The University at Buffalo, the University of Virginia, and Vincennes University are the only colleges founded by United States Presidents.

The University at Buffalo is classified among &quot;R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity&quot;. In 1989, UB was elected to the Association of American Universities. The University at Buffalo intercollegiate athletic teams are the Bulls. They compete in Division I of the NCAA and are members of the Mid-American Conference. 

==History==

City leaders of Buffalo sought to establish a university in the city from the earliest days of Buffalo. A &quot;University of Western New-York&quot; was begun at Buffalo under the auspices of the Presbyterian Church and property was purchased at North Street and College, (the site of the later YMCA), on the north side of the Allentown district. &quot;University of Western New-York&quot; was chartered by the state on April 8, 1836. Following the charter, private funding was secured for the &quot;Western University,&quot; which would endow six or seven professorships at $5,000 each; an addition $12,000 or $15,000 was also collected for a general fund, and a building lot was donated by Judge Ebenezer Walden, one of the wealthiest men in the city. However, the project collapsed and no classes were ever offered, and only the layout of the College Street campus remains.

===Founding===
The University of Buffalo (as it was originally named) was founded on May 11, 1846, as a private medical school to train the doctors for the communities of Buffalo, Niagara Falls, and surrounding villages. Future U.S. President Millard Fillmore, then a lawyer who had recently served in the United States House of Representatives, was one of the principal founders. James Platt White was instrumental in obtaining a charter for the university from the state legislature in 1846. He also taught the first class of 89 men in obstetrics. State Assemblyman Nathan K. Hall was also &quot;particularly active in procuring the charter&quot;. The doors first opened to students in 1847 and after associating with a hospital for teaching purposes, the first class of students graduated the medical school in July 1847. Fillmore served as the school&#x27;s first chancellor, a position he held until 1874, even as he served in other capacities during that time, including Comptroller of New York, U.S. Vice President, and eventually President.
Initially, the university did not have its own facilities, and early lectures were given at an old post office on Seneca and Washington streets in Buffalo. The first building specially built for the university was a stone structure at the corner of Main and Virginia streets, built in 1849–50, through donations, public subscription, and a state grant. There were continuous expansions to the college medical programs, including a separate pharmacy division, which is now The School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences. In 1887, a law school was organized in Buffalo, which quickly became associated with Niagara University just to the north of Buffalo. After four years, in 1891, the law school was acquired by the University of Buffalo as the University of Buffalo Law School, which had a downtown Buffalo facility. In the first few years of the 20th century, the university began planning for a comprehensive undergraduate college to complete the basic structure of a university, and in 1909 the university acquired the Erie County Almshouse grounds from the county of Erie, which became the University of Buffalo&#x27;s initial campus. The establishment may have been influenced by the 1910 &quot;Flexner Report&quot; which criticized the preparation of the medical students at the university. With that additional space, in 1915, the then University of Buffalo formed the College of Arts and Sciences, creating an undergraduate division in addition to its prior educational work in the licensed professional fields. In 1916, Grace Millard Knox pledged $500,000 () for the establishment of a &quot;department of liberal arts and sciences in the University of Buffalo&quot;, which was at the time still a private institution. The initial gift of $100,000 was for the purchase of what would become Townsend Hall and the remainder was to establish the university&#x27;s first endowment, in her husband&#x27;s name, to support the department.
In 1950, the Industrial Engineering department branched off from the Mechanical Engineering department. In 1956, a Civil Engineering Department was formed under Lehigh University graduate Robert L. Ketter, who went on to become Dean of the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, and later President of the university. In 1959, WBFO was launched as an AM radio station by UB&#x27;s School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, and run by UB&#x27;s students. The station has since become the launching pad of two modern National Public Radio personalities: Terry Gross and Ira Flatow. In 1961, the Western New York nuclear research program was created at the university. This program installed a miniature, active nuclear fission reactor on the university&#x27;s South (Main Street) Campus. This program was not particularly active, nor could it compete with other government-run research labs, consequently, the programs performed in this facility were abandoned somewhat shortly after its inception. This reactor was decommissioned in 2005 with little fanfare due to material security concerns.

===Acquisition by the SUNY system and second campus===
The private University of Buffalo was purchased by and incorporated into the State University of New York (SUNY) system in 1962, and became known as the State University of New York at Buffalo, more commonly known as the University at Buffalo. This acquisition was championed by then-Governor of New York, Nelson Rockefeller. As a part of the agreement to merge the university into the SUNY system, the state began to build an extensive second campus for the university. In 1964, the state acquired several hundred acres in the town of Amherst on the northeast of Buffalo, for development as a comprehensive campus for most of the non-medical disciplines at the University at Buffalo. This is often called the North Campus; it is the center of most University at Buffalo activities. The North Campus project included several major buildings, dormitory complexes, a separate spur of the interstate highway, and a new lake. The undergraduate college, the law school, and graduate schools were all moved to the new campus. During the late 1960s, the College of Arts and Sciences was divided into three separate schools: arts and letters, natural sciences and mathematics, and social sciences. During the 1998–1999 academic year, the three schools were reunited to re-create the existing College of Arts and Sciences, when the faculties of Arts and Letters, Social Sciences, and Natural Sciences and Mathematics were combined, according to a memorandum issued by the State University of New York.

Since 1989, UB has been a member of the Association of American Universities (AAU), an organization of 65 leading research universities in the United States and Canada. UB president Satish K. Tripathi serves on the AAU board of directors.

===&quot;UB 2020&quot; strategic plan===
Started in 2004 under President John B. Simpson, UB 2020 was a strategic planning initiative to develop and implement a vision for the university over the subsequent 15 years. The centerpiece of UB 2020 was to add about 10,000 more students, 750 faculty members and 600 staff, increasing the size of the university by about 40 percent. UB 2020 also recognized the university&#x27;s contribution to the surrounding region. The most recent estimates of UB&#x27;s impact on the local and regional economies of Western New York report approximately $1.7 billion are brought into the local economy from the presence of UB. This figure is also expected to rise by 40 percent, corresponding with UB&#x27;s institutional growth.

One of the keys to helping UB achieve the goals of the UB 2020 plan, proponents said, was the passage of S2020 and A2020, known as the UB 2020 Flexibility and Economic Growth Act, by the New York State Legislature. On June 3, 2009, the State Senate passed S2020 and sent the bill to the Assembly for their consideration.
The current president, Satish K. Tripathi, continued his vocal support of UB 2020 and has been actively engaging in campus-wide discussion on the proposed tuition increases introduced by the bill.

In 2011, the School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences received a donation of $40 million from an alumnus, George Melvin Ellis Jr., MD, who earned his medical degree from the university in 1945. The donation contributed to the $375 million project which has relocated the School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences to UB&#x27;s downtown campus. The new school building was designed by HOK Architects. A subsequent donation of $30 million from Jeremy Jacobs and family was received in 2015 and the medical school was renamed the Jacobs School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences.

From FY2011 to FY2012, UB spent over $300 million on the strategic plan to construct and open four new buildings, including Davis Hall, William R. Greiner Residence Hall, the Clinical and Translational Research Center and Kaleida Health medical research building, and Crossroads Culinary Center.

On August 22, 2013, President Barack Obama came to UB&#x27;s campus to give a speech about needed higher education reform in the country. President Obama highlighted UB&#x27;s accolades and specifically chose Buffalo for its excellence and commitment to the future, graduation rates and retention, and quality education at an affordable price.

As part of the UB 2020 initiative, &quot;Heart of the Campus&quot; projects were initiated in phases on each of UB&#x27;s three campuses. In Fall 2019, UB began construction of the One World Café, an &quot;international eatery&quot; located on North Campus, adjacent to Capen Hall, Norton Hall, and Founder&#x27;s Plaza.

Beginning in 2019, UB took steps to distance the institution from Millard Fillmore and ceased its co-sponsorship of his annual gravesite ceremony, due to his controversial policies regarding slavery in the United States. A year later, Fillmore&#x27;s name was removed from the Millard Fillmore Academic Center, and the names of UB&#x27;s fourth chancellor James O. Putnam and SUNY regent Peter Buell Porter were also removed from campus due to the former&#x27;s openly racist views and the latter&#x27;s ownership of slaves.

==Name==
The university&#x27;s official legal name is &quot;State University of New York at Buffalo&quot;. The more commonly used name and the school&#x27;s formal academic name is &quot;University at Buffalo&quot;, informally &quot;UB&quot;. This name is similar to the university&#x27;s former name of over 100 years, &quot;University of Buffalo&quot;. Other names like &quot;SUNY Buffalo&quot;, &quot;SUNY at Buffalo&quot;, and &quot;Buffalo&quot; are also seen. The university&#x27;s athletic department, particularly on uniforms, uses the name &quot;Buffalo&quot;.

==Administration and organization==

Buffalo is a public university and is one of four university centers of the 64 campuses in the State University of New York (SUNY) which enrolled 467,991 students and employed 88,024 academic staff in 2014. SUNY is governed by an 18-member Board of Trustees, of which 16 vote. 15 of the voting members are appointed by the Governor of New York and the remaining voting member is elected by students as President of the Student Assembly of the State University of New York. The other two members are non-voting faculty from the University Faculty Senate and Faculty Council of Community Colleges. Merryl Tisch is the Chairman of the SUNY Board of Trustees and John King Jr. is the Chancellor of the SUNY system. Satish K. Tripathi was appointed by the SUNY Board of Trustees as the 15th president of the University at Buffalo in April 2011, becoming the first international-born president the school has had. He previously held a six-year tenure as the UB provost and executive vice president for academic affairs. He receives compensation of $385,000, $115,000, and $150,000 annually from each of the university, SUNY Research Foundation, and the UB Foundation respectively.
The University at Buffalo Foundation (UB Foundation) was chartered in 1962 as an independent non-profit corporation and is controlled by a privately appointed board of trustees. It serves as a vehicle to raise private funds for the university, develop real estate, and manage endowment investments on behalf of the university. The foundation managed a $685.2 million endowment for FY2011.

UB was awarded the EPA &quot;Environmental Champion Award&quot; in 2015 and is ranked as one of the top 50 &quot;green colleges and universities&quot; in the nation, working towards becoming climate neutral by 2030.

===North Campus===
The North Campus, a census-designated place also called &quot;University at Buffalo&quot;, located in the suburb of Amherst, began in the 1970s. Many academic programs, including the entirety of the undergraduate College of Arts and Sciences, the University at Buffalo Law School, the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, the School of Management, the Graduate School of Social Work, and the Graduate School of Education, as well as Lockwood Memorial Library, Oscar A. Silverman Library, and many administrative offices, are located on UB&#x27;s North Campus.
The North Campus is home to administrative and academic offices. The main buildings are arranged along one academic &quot;spine&quot;, a second floor connecting corridor, that connects most of the main academic buildings. The whole campus covers with 146 buildings containing , 11 residence halls and 5 apartment complexes. Its size was supported by the implementation of a shuttle system circling the academic sector and surrounding areas including the administrative complex, located nearly a quarter mile from the central academic area. When originally built by the state of New York, the North Campus was provided with two Interstate exits, from I-290 and I-990, its own internal parkway, the John James Audubon Parkway, and two small lakes created from Ellicott Creek. As a census-designated place, the residential population recorded at the 2010 census was 6,066.

The North Campus offers a variety of entertainment programming and activity for students. It contains the Student Union, which houses offices for the Student Association and student-interest clubs; Slee Hall, which presents contemporary and classical music concerts; Alumni Arena, the home-court for University Athletics; the UB Center for the Arts, a non-profit presenter of a wide variety of professional entertainment and University at Buffalo Stadium, the 30,000 seat football stadium.

===South Campus===

The South Campus, also known as the Main Street campus, located on in North Buffalo, is the former grounds of the Erie County Almshouse and Insane Asylum, of which four buildings still remain (Hayes Hall, the former insane asylum; Wende Hall, a former maternity hospital; Hayes D; and Townsend Hall, a former nurses&#x27; quarters). Edmund B. Hayes Hall located on South Campus is a registered U.S. National Historical Place. The college was designed by architect E.B. Green in 1910, and was intended to resemble Trinity College, Dublin. Its 53 buildings contain () and include two residence halls. This campus is served by the northernmost subway station on Buffalo&#x27;s Niagara Frontier Metro Rail system.

Today, the South Campus is home to the School of Nursing, School of Pharmacy, Dental School, and the School of Architecture and Urban Planning. In addition, the University at Buffalo South Campus is the home of the WBFO radio station, the university&#x27;s biomedical science research complex, the Health Sciences Library, and certain administrative offices.

===Downtown Campus===
In 2002, UB commissioned Boston firm Chan Krieger to create a third campus center. The Downtown Campus is the site of the Jacobs School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences as well as UB&#x27;s New York State Center of Excellence in Bioinformatics and Life Science, which partners in research with UB&#x27;s Ira G. Ross Eye Institute as well as the Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center and Hauptman-Woodward Medical Research Institute to compose the Buffalo-Niagara Medical Campus. The medical campus, which is designed to meet LEED Silver criteria, incorporates high efficiency lighting, heat recovery systems, and an Energy Star roof.

Also located in the downtown area is UB&#x27;s Clinical and Research Institute on Addictions (CRIA), Educational Opportunity Center (EOC) and the Jacobs Executive Development Center (JEDC). The campus includes six major properties and a total of 43 buildings, counting shared lease space ().

In September 2007, UB added the former M. Wile and Company Factory Building on the southeast corner of Goodell and Ellicott streets and the former Trico Products Corp. building complex on the northwest corner of Goodell and Ellicott streets to its properties downtown. The UB Regional Institute, Center on Rehabilitation Synergy, and a number of pre-K-16 initiatives related to UB&#x27;s civic engagement mission, such as the UB-Buffalo Public Schools Partnership office, are set to relocate to the first site. The latter location has been purchased to house additional biomedical and life science-related businesses connected to the Buffalo-Niagara Medical Campus.

====Teaching hospitals====
UB&#x27;s teaching hospitals include Buffalo General Hospital, Erie County Medical Center, Millard Fillmore Hospital, Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center, Veterans Affairs Western New York Health Care System, and the John R. Oishei Children&#x27;s Hospital. Additional facilities include free clinics such as the Kaleida Health&#x27;s Niagara Family Health Center and the Lighthouse Free Medical Clinic, a program run by UB medical students.

====UB art galleries====

UB is home to two university art galleries, the UB Anderson Art Gallery and the UB Art Gallery at the Center for the Arts.
Adjacent to the UB South Campus is the UB Anderson Art Gallery, a converted elementary school with an all-glass atrium exhibit space. The UB Anderson Gallery hosts exhibitions curated by faculty and visiting curators and features works from international and professional artist in its two floor facility. The UB Anderson Gallery building, along with over 1,200 works of art, was donated to the university in 2000 by collector and gallery owner David K. Anderson, son of legendary New York gallerist Martha Jackson. Selections from the personal collection of Jackson that was donated to the UB Anderson Gallery by David Anderson are on display in a 360 degree permanent installation in the Martha Jackson Gallery Archives and Research Center, on the second floor of the gallery.

The UB Art Gallery at the Center for the Arts is located on the north campus, and features works from contemporary artists, as well as faculty and students across disciplines.

====Comprehensive Physical Plan====
The University at Buffalo has grown to an enrollment of approximately 30,000 undergraduate and graduate students, and a staff of 14,000 employees, across three campuses in the last 160 years. In order to accommodate both students and faculty, the university is currently implementing a $4.5 million Comprehensive Physical Plan to help in growth as well as to best utilize and enhance current facilities. Connecting all three campuses, as well as the facilities UB uses, is also a major element of the project. The firm granted the contract to lead the project is Beyer Blinder Belle.

The comprehensive physical planning process is broken into four phases. Currently, UB is implementing &quot;phase one&quot; by seeking input from the local and university communities to pinpoint issues, opportunities, and concerns related to this expansion. The project recognizes UB&#x27;s potential for excellence, in regard to the university&#x27;s physical environment, by highlighting and evaluating various positive and negative attributes of the three campuses, including housing, circulation, functionality, landscape, and community interface.

=== Campus demographics ===
University at Buffalo is also a census-designated place (CDP) covering the campus.

&quot;Note: the US Census treats Hispanic/Latino as an ethnic category. This table excludes Latinos from the racial categories and assigns them to a separate category. Hispanics/Latinos can be of any race.&quot;

The CDP is mostly located within Sweet Home Central School District with a portion in Williamsville Central School District.

==Student life==
===Associations and activities===
UB has two student-run periodicals: &quot;The Spectrum&quot;, and &quot;Subject&quot;, both of which are run as independent nonprofits. &quot;The Spectrum&quot; is a campus newspaper, which distributes on campus and online. &quot;Subject&quot; is a student-run online multimedia outlet that includes student-written articles, and radio shows, video, and podcasts by students and alumni.

&quot;Subject&quot; was founded in 2020 by alumni of former campus radio station WRUB, and campus magazine &quot;Generation,&quot;, after Sub-Board I, the student services corporation that funded them both, was shut down in 2019.

After the retirement of John B. Simpson, the undergraduate students have also developed a university forum with the hopes of developing a thriving online campus. This move was supported by now incumbent president Satish K Tripathi who called it a &quot;model of University spirit and entrepreneurship&quot;.

The UB Student Alumni Association (UBSAA) annually hosts the world&#x27;s largest collegiate mud-volleyball game known as &quot;Oozefest&quot;. One hundred ninety-two teams of at least six students compete in a double elimination volleyball tournament at &quot;The Mud Pit&quot; each Spring before finals. Fire trucks are brought in to saturate the dirt courts to create the mud. Awards are handed out to not only the victors, but the most creatively dressed. In the past, students have worn business suits and even dresses to the tournament.

Held annually from 1991 to 2018 has been the Linda Yalem Safety Run, formerly called the Linda Yalem Memorial Run. Linda Yalem was a sophomore at UB who was studying communications and training for the New York City Marathon when she was raped and killed by Altemio Sanchez after going for a run on the Ellicott Creek Bike Path on September 29, 1990. The Run was held every year in her memory and to promote safety for runners.

In 1923, an honorary senior society called Bisonhead was founded. It has since represented twelve undergraduate leaders at UB each year.

Many of UB&#x27;s clubs, such as the UB Accounting Association, are run through the Undergraduate Student Association and the Graduate Student Association, with each level requiring respective senate recognition for clubs.

===Student housing===
Student residence halls are located on both the North and South Campuses. On the North Campus, there is the Ellicott Complex, which consists of Evans (formerly Porter), Fargo, Red Jacket, Richmond, Spaulding, and Wilkeson Quadrangles. The Ellicott Complex is also known as &quot;Lego Land&quot; because the shapes of the buildings resemble Legos stacked upon each other. Next to Fargo Quad is the newly built in 2011 Greiner Hall, a dorm strictly for sophomores. Also on North Campus is the Governors Complex, home to the Freshman Honors Housing and various other living communities. There are also off-campus housing options close to the north campus such as The Triad Apartments.

On South Campus is Goodyear and Clement Hall. The unique aspect of these dorms is that residents share a bathroom with the adjacent room, rather than have a communal bathroom. Up until Spring of 2011, there were four other dorm buildings, referred to as &quot;The Quad&quot;: MacDonald, Pritchard, Schoellkopf, and Michael Hall. Michael Hall currently exists as the Student Health Center, the other three were demolished in 2018.

In 1999, the university built its first apartment complex for families and graduate students at Flickinger Court. Since the success of Flickinger, UB has developed South Lake Village, Hadley Village, Flint Village, and Creekside Apartments. Most students who wish to still live on or near the North Campus but enjoy the lifestyle of apartment living take advantage of these apartments. University Village at Sweethome, Villas at Rensch, and Villas at Chestnut Ridge are student apartment communities adjacent to the North Campus and offer a shuttle service. Collegiate Village off campus apartments offers transportation to both North and South Campus. Students also find housing in private locations. Those locations are generally situated in the University Heights district of Buffalo, and other areas close to the North and South Campuses. The school assigns rooms based on a lottery system.

In 2023, a conservative student group, Young Americans for Freedom, sued the University at Buffalo&#x27;s Student Association for a policy prohibiting student groups from affiliation with national organizations. The policy took effect after the group hosted conservative commentator Michael Knowles. In July 2023, the group dropped part of the lawsuit.

==Athletics==


The university&#x27;s sports teams are known as the Buffalo Bulls, or UB Bulls. The Bulls compete in Division I (Division I FBS of the NCAA in football), and are a member of the Mid-American Conference (MAC) for all sports. The Bulls have been a member of the Mid-American Conference since 1998.

Buffalo is the only SUNY school to field a Division I FBS football team, the highest level of college football. They are also the only SUNY school to have had their men&#x27;s basketball team nationally ranked and the only SUNY school to have had their women&#x27;s basketball team nationally ranked. Because of its academic and athletic successes, the University at Buffalo is consistently cited as the athletic flagship of the SUNY system.

Buffalo Bulls field athletic teams in many other sports as well. Men&#x27;s team sports at UB include those in football, basketball, track and field, wrestling, cross country, and tennis. The Bulls&#x27; women&#x27;s teams feature basketball, track and field, cross country, volleyball, softball, soccer, tennis, and swimming and diving. Cheerleading is co-ed. The Bulls have had many athletes turn professional in football, baseball, basketball, soccer, and volleyball.

Over 30 Buffalo Bulls baseball players have been selected in the MLB draft. Notable Buffalo baseball alumni include: Joe Hesketh, Tom Murphy, Bill Schuster, Eddie Basinski and Steve Geltz.
The Women&#x27;s Varsity Rowing team won the CAA Colonial Athletic Association championship in April 2010 for the first time. In May 2010, the team won the Jack &amp; Nancy Seitz Women&#x27;s Point Trophy at the Dad Vail Regatta for the third year in a row. Rowing became a club sport at the end of the 2017 Spring semester. In 2015 UB&#x27;s men track and field star, Jonathan Jones, became the first national champion in UB&#x27;s Division I history when he won the shot put at the NCAA Outdoor Track and Field Championships.

The mascot of UB&#x27;s athletic teams is Victor E. Bull, a blue bull. The university is home to the Thunder of the East marching band. The band performs at all home football games and travels to both local and national parades and competitions. Buffalo has three fight songs: &quot;Victory March&quot;, &quot;Go for a Touchdown&quot;, and &quot;Buffalo Fight Song&quot;.

===Basketball===
The men&#x27;s basketball team plays their home games at the 6,783 seat Alumni Arena. The Bulls were champions of the Mid-American Conference in 2015, 2016, 2018 and 2019 and thus earned the automatic bid to March Madness in each of those seasons. They are the only MAC school to win the conference tournament in 4 seasons out of 5. In 2018 the Bulls upset No. 4 seed Arizona in the first round of March Madness, advancing to the second round (round of 32) for the first time in school history. In the 2018-19 season Buffalo, led by C.J. Massinburg, earned a national ranking for the first time in the Associated Press poll. The basketball team was nationally ranked for most of the season with a high ranking of #11 on both the AP and Coaches Polls. For the second year in a row the Bulls won a game in the NCAA tournament, defeating Arizona State.

The women&#x27;s basketball team won the MAC championship and made their first trip to the NCAA tournament in program history in 2016. In 2017 the women&#x27;s team made another trip to the NCAA Tournament beating South Florida in the first round and Florida State in the second round, making the sweet sixteen for the first time in program history. The team finished with a final ranking of #21 in the Coaches Poll. In 2019, the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball teams both won the MAC championship on the same day, the second time the Bulls had done so in four seasons. The women&#x27;s team defeated Rutgers in the NCAA tournament in their third appearance in March Madness in four years.

===Football===
The University at Buffalo football team plays their home games at the 31,000+ capacity University at Buffalo Stadium. In 1958, the football team won the Lambert Cup, emblematic of supremacy in Eastern U.S. small-college football. That led to the team&#x27;s first bowl invitation, to the Tangerine Bowl in Orlando, Florida, against Florida State University. But the Bulls would be allowed to participate only if backup defensive end Mike Wilson and starting halfback Willie Evans, who were black, did not play. The team stood behind the two, and refused the bowl offer. Buffalo did not receive another bowl invitation until the 2008 season when they won the MAC championship against previously undefeated Ball State.

Several UB football stars from the 1950s and early 1960s went on to play professional football, including quarterback John Stofa with the American Football League&#x27;s Miami Dolphins and Cincinnati Bengals, and defensive lineman Gerry Philbin with the AFL&#x27;s New York Jets. Philbin is a member of the AFL Hall of Fame and the All-time All-AFL Team. Philbin and UB&#x27;s Willie Ross were the first two UB graduates to play on professional football championship teams in the United States: Ross with the 1964 AFL Champion Buffalo Bills; and Philbin with the 1968 AFL Champion New York Jets, who also won that season&#x27;s AFL-NFL World Championship Game (Super Bowl III). James Starks was on the Green Bay Packers Super Bowl XLV champions as a rookie. Ramon Guzman played on the 2009 Grey Cup champion Montreal Alouettes.

Khalil Mack was selected as the first-round fifth pick in the NFL draft, becoming the first UB football player to be selected in the first round of the NFL Draft. In his time at Buffalo, Mack became the all-time NCAA record for forced fumbles and is also tied for most career tackles for loss in NCAA history. In his time in the NFL, Mack has been one of the most accomplished players in the league. He has been selected for the Pro Bowl every year from 2015 to 2019 and been named First Team All-Pro in 2015, 2016 and 2018. In 2015, Mack became the first first-team All-Pro in NFL history to be elected in two different positions in the same year, as a defensive end and outside linebacker. Mack was named the NFL Defensive Player of the Year for the 2016 season.

The 2020 season saw Buffalo ranked in the AP Poll for the first time in program history led by running back Jaret Patterson en route to an undefeated regular season. On November 28, 2020, Patterson rushed for 409 yards while scoring 8 touchdowns, tying a Division 1 FBS record against Kent State.

<doc id="465599" wikidata="Q845439" url="?curid=465599" title="Prime Minister of Lithuania">
<text>The prime minister of Lithuania () is the head of government of Lithuania. The prime minister is appointed by the president with the assent of the Lithuanian parliament, the Seimas. The modern office of prime minister was established in 1990, when Lithuania declared its independence, although the official title was &quot;Chairperson of the Council of Ministers&quot; until 25 November 1992.

Historically, the title of prime minister was also used between 1918 and 1940. This was during the original Republic of Lithuania, which lasted from the collapse of the Russian Empire until the country&#x27;s annexation by the Soviet Union.

==List==

===Republic of Lithuania (1918–1940)===

Following the ultimatum in June 1940, the forces of Soviet Union entered Lithuania, prompting President Antanas Smetona to flee the country. Antanas Merkys, who assumed the position of acting president in accordance with the constitution, soon announced he had taken over the Presidency on a permanent basis and appointed Justas Paleckis, favored by the Soviet authorities, as the Prime Minister ahead of the &quot;people&#x27;s government&quot;. Merkys soon resigned, allowing Paleckis to assume the post of acting president as well. The presidency of Merkys is not recognized as legitimate in modern Lithuania and Paleckis is not listed as an interwar Prime Minister in government sources.

===Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic (1940–1990)===
===Provisional Government of Lithuania (1941)===
===Republic of Lithuania (1990–present)===
From 11 March 1990 after adopting the Act of the Re-Establishment of the State of Lithuania.

<doc id="465600" wikidata="Q234665" url="?curid=465600" title="Livilla">
<text>Claudia Livia (Classical Latin: ; – AD 31) was the only daughter of Nero Claudius Drusus and Antonia Minor and sister to Roman Emperor Claudius and general Germanicus, and thus paternal aunt of emperor Caligula and maternal great-aunt of emperor Nero, as well as the niece and daughter-in-law of Tiberius. She was named after her grandmother, Augustus&#x27; wife Livia Drusilla, and commonly known by her family nickname Livilla (&quot;little Livia&quot;). She was born after Germanicus and before Claudius.

She was twice married to the potential successor in the Julio-Claudian dynasty, first to Augustus&#x27; grandson Gaius Caesar (died 4 AD) and later to Tiberius&#x27; son Drusus the Younger (died AD 23). Allegedly, she helped her lover Sejanus in poisoning her second husband and died shortly after Sejanus fell from power in AD 31.

==Marriages==
Livilla was married twice, first in 1 BC to Gaius Caesar, Augustus&#x27; grandson and heir. Thus, Augustus had chosen Livilla as the wife of the future emperor. This splendid royal marriage probably gave Livilla grand aspirations for her future, perhaps at the expense of the ambition of Augustus&#x27; granddaughters, Agrippina the Elder and Julia the Younger. However, Gaius died in AD 4, cutting short Augustus&#x27; and Livilla&#x27;s plans.

In the same year, Livilla married her cousin Drusus Julius Caesar (Drusus the Younger), the son of Tiberius. When Tiberius succeeded Augustus as emperor in AD 14, Livilla again was the wife of a potential successor. Drusus and Livilla had three children, a daughter named Julia Livia in around AD 7 and twin sons in AD 19: Germanicus Gemellus, who died in 23, and Tiberius Gemellus, who survived infancy.

==Livilla&#x27;s standing in her family==

Tacitus reports that Livilla was a remarkably beautiful woman, despite the fact she was rather ungainly as a child. The &quot;Senatus Consultum de Cn. Pisone patre&quot; indicates that she was held in the highest esteem by her uncle and father-in-law, Tiberius, and by her grandmother Livia Drusilla.

According to Tacitus, she felt resentment and jealousy against her sister-in-law Agrippina the Elder, the wife of her brother Germanicus, to whom she was unfavourably compared. Indeed, Agrippina fared much better in producing imperial heirs to the household (being the mother of the Emperor Caligula and Agrippina the Younger) and was much more popular. Suetonius reports that she despised her younger brother Claudius; having heard he would one day become Emperor, she deplored publicly such a fate for the Roman people.

As with most of the female members of the Julio-Claudian dynasty, she may also have been very ambitious, in particular for her male offspring.

==Affair with Sejanus==

Possibly even before the birth of the twins, Livilla had an affair with Lucius Aelius Sejanus, the praetorian prefect of Tiberius – later on, some (including Tiberius) suspected Sejanus to have fathered the twins. Drusus, heir apparent since the death of Germanicus in AD 19, died in AD 23, shortly after striking Sejanus in an argument. According to Tacitus, Suetonius, and Cassius Dio, Sejanus had poisoned Drusus, not only because he feared the wrath of the future Emperor but also because he had designs on the supreme power, and aimed at removing a potential competitor, with Livilla as his accomplice. If Drusus was indeed poisoned, his death aroused no suspicions at the time.

Sejanus now wanted to marry the widowed Livilla. In AD 25 Tiberius rejected such a request but in AD 31 he eventually gave way. In the same year, the Emperor received evidence from Antonia Minor, Livilla&#x27;s mother and his sister-in-law, that Sejanus planned to overthrow him. Tiberius had Sejanus denounced in the Senate, then had him arrested and dragged off to prison to be put to death. A bloody purge then erupted in Rome with most of Sejanus&#x27; family (including his children) and followers sharing his fate.

==Accusations and death==

Hearing of the death of her children, Sejanus&#x27; former wife Apicata committed suicide. According to Cassius Dio, before her death, she addressed a letter to Tiberius, accusing Sejanus and Livilla of having poisoned Drusus. [The story should be read with caution. Barbara Levick says that Sejanus must have murdered Drusus in self-defense because only Tiberius stood between the Praetorian Prefect and the end of his career at the hands of Drusus. Furthermore, she says it is even less likely that Livilla would have been complicit in the destruction of her family, the key to her children&#x27;s future. Levick dismisses the accusation of Apicata as the revenge of a woman whose husband left her for another.] Drusus&#x27; cupbearer Lygdus and Livilla&#x27;s physician Eudemus were questioned and under torture confirmed Apicata&#x27;s accusation.

Livilla died shortly afterwards, either being killed or by suicide. According to Cassius Dio, Tiberius handed Livilla over to her mother, Antonia Minor, who locked her up in a room and starved her to death.

Early in AD 32, the Senate proposed &quot;terrible decrees...against her very statues and memory&quot;.

Posthumously, there were further allegations of adultery with her physician Eudemus and with the senator and poet Mamercus Aemilius Scaurus.

==Portraiture==

The iconographic identification of Livilla has posed many problems, mainly due to the &quot;damnatio memoriae&quot; voted against her by the Senate after her death. Several possibilities have been advanced without widespread acceptance. A portrait type that survives in at least three replicas and which can be referred to as the &quot;Alesia type&quot; may represent Livilla. The replicas show the head of a lady, with a hairstyle clearly from the Tiberian period. The physiognomy is close but not identical to portraits of Antonia Minor, Livilla&#x27;s mother and some replicas seem to bear the marks of voluntary damage (that one would expect from a &quot;damnatio memoriae&quot;). For all these reasons, it has been proposed that these portraits are a representation of Livilla.

A cameo portrait of a lady with the silhouettes of two infants, has been tentatively identified as Livilla. Although it is possible that the seated woman on the right on the Great Cameo of France represents Livilla, it seems more likely that the female figure seated on the left and holding a roll represents Livilla, depicted there as the widowed wife of Drusus the Younger, seen just above her as one of the three heavenly imperial male figures.

==Cultural depictions==
Livilla has been depicted in three television series about the period. In the 1968 British television series &quot;The Caesars&quot; she was portrayed by Suzan Farmer.

In the 1976 BBC TV series adaptation of &quot;I, Claudius&quot; she was played by Patricia Quinn. In that program she has an affair with Agrippa Postumus, but Livia persuades her to frame him for rape, leading to his exile. She murders Drusus with the help of Sejanus and also plots with him to murder Tiberius, but her mother finds the evidence and sends it to Tiberius via Claudius. She also believes Livilla is trying to murder her daughter for standing in her way. Livilla is then locked in a room by her mother, who says Livilla won&#x27;t leave until she is dead.

In the 1985 mini-series &quot;A.D.&quot; she was played by Susan Sarandon.

<text>Chrysiogenes arsenatis is a species of bacterium in the family Chrysiogenaceae. It has a unique biochemistry. Instead of respiring with oxygen, it respires using the most oxidized form of arsenic, arsenate. It uses arsenate as its terminal electron acceptor. Arsenic is usually toxic to life. Bacteria like &quot;Chrysiogenes arsenatis&quot; are found in anoxic arsenic-contaminated environments.

The station is sited at Central Square, in Cardiff city centre. The Grade II listed building is managed by Transport for Wales Rail, and is both the largest and busiest station in Wales.

Cardiff Central is one of twenty railway stations in the city and one of two in the city centre, serving as a hub for the Valleys &amp; Cardiff Local Routes. It is an interchange for services between South Wales, West Wales and North Wales, as well as other major British cities.

Transport for Wales Rail operates services to most destinations in Wales and to Manchester, while CrossCountry operates trains to , Birmingham and . Great Western Railway runs all inter-city services between London Paddington and via Bristol, as well as some regional services to Bath, and Portsmouth via Southampton.

== History ==
===Early history===
In the early 1840s, the South Wales Railway was trying to find a suitable site for a railway station, but the area that is now Cardiff Central railway station was prone to flooding. It was Isambard Kingdom Brunel&#x27;s solution to divert the River Taff to the west, creating a larger and safer site for the station. The initial part of the South Wales Railway between and through Cardiff was opened on 18 June 1850, with all trains operated by the Great Western Railway (GWR) under a lease agreement. Through services from Cardiff to London Paddington began on 19 July 1852, when the Chepstow Railway Bridge was opened, completing the connection between the South Wales Railway and the Great Western Railway. The South Wales Railway was absorbed into the GWR in 1863.

The South Wales Railway had originally been built as a broad-gauge railway, but on the weekend of 11–12 May 1872, the entire South Wales system was converted to standard gauge.

Cardiff to London trains originally ran via the circuitous route via and took an average of five hours. This was reduced to around four hours from 1886 when the Severn Tunnel was opened creating a shorter route via Bristol and Bath. In 1903, another shortcut, the Badminton railway line was opened, bypassing Bath and Bristol, and this reduced the Cardiff-London journey times by another hour. By the 1930s, the fastest Cardiff-London trains took around 2 hours 40 minutes, and this remained fairly static until 1961, when the diesel Blue Pullman service reduced the fastest journey time to 2 hours 7 minutes. In October 1976, the InterCity 125 services were introduced, reducing the fastest journey times to 1 hour 53 minutes.

The original &#x27;Cardiff&#x27; station, as it was then known, had four through tracks running through the site, and consisted of two through platforms each with its own bay platform. During the 1890s, the station underwent considerable expansion, in 1896 a flying junction was constructed connecting the station to nearby Cardiff Queen Street station, and extra platforms were added to accommodate the new Taff Vale services, bringing the total number up to six.

Initially named &quot;Cardiff&quot;, the station was renamed &quot;Cardiff General&quot; in July 1924 and then &quot;Cardiff Central&quot; by British Rail in May 1973.

===1930s rebuild===

Between 1931 and 1934, the station underwent a major rebuild, designed by the GWR&#x27;s architects department under their chief architect Percy Emerson Culverhouse, the centrepiece of this was a new Art Deco entrance building faced in Portland stone, containing a booking hall and concourse with noted Art Deco light fittings, all topped by a clock cupola. The current Art Deco lamps in the booking hall are replicas of the originals, installed in 1999, having been funded by the Railway Heritage Trust. A GWR war memorial is located at the eastern end of the concourse. 

The Great Western Railway has its full name carved onto the façade (larger than the name of the station). The rebuild also saw a number of other improvements including the lengthening of the platforms, the widening of the Taff River railway bridge to allow the approach lines to the station to be quadrupled, and the installation of colour-light signalling. The rebuild of the station cost the GWR £820,000 (), and was formally opened by the Minister of Transport Oliver Stanley on 26 February 1934.

In July 1934, the GWR began a pioneering diesel railcar service with a buffet between Cardiff General and which had only two stops at and . This was the first long distance diesel express service in Britain, covering the between Cardiff and Birmingham in 2 hours 20 minutes. It proved so successful that larger railcars with more seating and no buffet had to be introduced to cope with demand, and even this had to be augmented by a normal locomotive hauled service. During the Second World War, two such trains ran to and from Cardiff daily. At this time it consisted of a three car train consisting of a standard carriage sandwiched between two railcars, and a stop at was introduced.

As a result of representations by the GWR, a nearby working-class district, Temperance Town, was cleared during the late 1930s in order to improve the outlook of the rebuilt station.

In 1992, the station, its buildings and platforms, became Grade II listed.

===Cardiff Riverside railway station===

On 14 August 1893, the GWR opened the adjacent Cardiff Riverside station which had two platforms located to the south of and adjacent to the main Cardiff station which curved away to the south on the Cardiff Riverside Branch, which ran to its terminus at about one mile to the south. Riverside station was rebuilt as an island platform with two platform faces in the early 1930s at the same time as Cardiff General was being rebuilt. On 28 October 1940 Riverside station was formally incorporated into Cardiff General station with its platforms being designated 8 and 9. The Riverside platforms were closed for passenger use on 16 March 1964, but they continued to be used for parcels and newspaper traffic for a number of years after. They were demolished in 1994 after becoming disused.

===21st century developments===
====Electrification====

In June 2010, Network Rail began its £5 billion Great Western electrification project which promised the construction of overhead line equipment, station improvements, and resignalling along parts of the Great Western Main Line and the South Wales Main Line. The changes would see the retirement of InterCity 125 trains on London services, and the introduction of Hitachi designed British Rail Class 800 electric trains, under a side project named the Intercity Express Programme.

Plans to install overhead equipment as far as were withdrawn in 2017 when the Department for Transport announced it would no longer fund the Cardiff-Swansea project, instead ordering bi-mode trains which switch to diesel when departing Cardiff for west Wales. Electrification to Cardiff was to be completed by 2018, but late that year Network Rail announced that completion would be delayed a further year.

The first electric services began at Cardiff Central on 5 January 2020, starting with a single 5-car Class 800 forming the 08:50 Cardiff to London. Trains were unable to operate on electric power through the Severn Tunnel due to difficult operating conditions in the 133-year-old tunnel, but the service was fully electrified by June 2020.

====Station improvements====

In 2011, it was announced that Cardiff Central would be enhanced with a new platform (&#x27;Platform 8&#x27;) and a new two-storey southern entrance and booking hall. This was part of a £200m regeneration scheme to boost train capacity in Cardiff and the surrounding areas. With work planned to start from June 2014, the Assembly Government committed £7m for the overall programme.

The old Grade II listed Water Tower (next to Platform 0 and the River Taff) was repainted in 2012 in the original brown and beige colours of the Great Western Railway.

The new entrance on the south side of the station, was opened in September 2015, and the new platform 8 on the south side of the station, opened in January 2017, allowing the number of trains on the busy Cardiff Central to Cardiff Queen Street corridor to be increased from 12 to 16 per hour. This was opened in conjunction with a resignalling scheme in the station, which saw all of the station&#x27;s platforms signalled to become bi-directional, in order to increase the flexibility of the operations.

====Central Square====
A major redevelopment scheme began in 2015 of Central Square in front of the main station entrance, of which Network Rail owned part. 500,000 square feet of new office space were planned for the area formerly occupied by Cardiff Central bus station. The landscaping, designed to create a positive impression to visitors exiting the railway station, would include a major pedestrianised route between the railway station and the Millennium Stadium.

====Future proposals====

In 2015, plans were unveiled to substantially redevelop the station in order to cope with the expected rise in passenger numbers, which are projected to rise from the current 13 million to 32 million by 2043. The proposed redevelopment would see an enlarged glass fronted concourse which would leave the current 1930s façade intact.

It was announced in July 2019 that significant upgrades would take place at Cardiff Central under a £38m improvement project, which also proposes a £20m West Wales Parkway station north of Swansea in order to reduce journey times between Cardiff and West Wales.

In August 2020 it was announced that Cardiff Central would be upgraded. Design work had already begun on a £113m upgrade which is expected to be funded by £40m from the Cardiff Capital Region group of local authorities, £15m from Transport for Wales and from the UK Department for Transport. It is envisaged that work will begin in 2022, but that would depend upon the design and development exercise.

In September 2024 it was proposed that Cardiff Central would gain an additional 2 platforms as part of Cardiff Crossrail, a project planned to cross the city west-to-east via Cardiff Bay. The first phase of this project would see Cardiff Central connected to the Butetown branch line with tram-trains running to Cardiff Bay. The two new platforms would be built in the southern car park. Construction is anticipated to start in Autumn 2025. 

== Station layout and platforms==

There are two entrances to the station. The northern main entrance leads to the main concourse and is on Central Square. The Millennium Stadium is a short distance to the northwest.
The southern entrance is at the rear of the station on Tresillian Way, accessed from Penarth Road, where the station car park is found.

The railway lines are above the station concourses. Two subways, one each at the eastern and western side of the station, run parallel under the tracks linking the two main entrances, from which the platforms are accessed by stairs and lifts, with the exception of Platform 0 which is accessed from the main concourse near Marks and Spencer.
Cardiff Central has eight platforms, numbered 0, 1a/b, 2a/b, 3a/b, 4a/b, 6a/b, 7a/b and 8. There is no longer, despite signage, a Platform 5; this was a west-facing bay platform situated between Platforms 3 and 4 which was removed in the 1960s. Platform 0, a short through platform at the north of the station was created in 1999.

The station has ten tracks running through it. All but two of the tracks have an adjacent platform, and the remaining two are through lines for goods trains and other non-stopping traffic.

Platforms 3 and 4 are divided into &#x27;A&#x27; and &#x27;B&#x27; sections and are capable of holding two local trains or a nine car Class 800 train. Other platforms can be used by more than one train, but are not all sectioned.

Platforms 6 to 8 at the south side of the station are used by Valley Lines trains between , the north of Cardiff, the Valleys, and the Vale of Glamorgan.

Platforms 0 to 4 are typically used by longer distance regional and national services operated by Transport for Wales Rail, Great Western Railway, and CrossCountry to destinations including London Paddington, , , , Derby, Nottingham, , , , Taunton, , , Holyhead and Chester.

To the West of the station lies Canton TMD, operated by Transport for Wales Rail, as well as the junction splitting trains to Penarth and the Vale of Glamorgan, Swansea, and Valley line services via Ninian Park and Radyr. To the East of the station lies Cardiff Queen Street (for Cardiff local and Valley Line services), and the mainline toward Newport, Bristol and London.

== Facilities ==
The majority of facilities are in the main concourse, including ticket desks and machines, cash machines, an information desk, departure and arrival screens, public telephones, a newsagent, and food shops. The station has the only First Class waiting room in Wales. Outside, a pay-and-display car park provides 248 spaces.

British Transport Police maintains a presence at Cardiff Central.

Additional ticket barriers were installed in the main entrance of the station in November 2019 as part of plans to reduce congestion at the station at peak times. A study found that the station can see over 40,000 people use the station on major event days in the city. The work was funded by Transport for Wales, who also aimed to refurbish toilets, install more ticket machines, phone charging points, and build cycle storage in 2020. Cardiff Central&#x27;s customer numbers are forecast to top 34 million users annually by 2043.

In January 2020, Transport for Wales installed a dedicated passenger assistance meeting point in the ticket hall of the station, stating it would provide a comfortable and identifiable location for those needing assistance to wait while their booked assistance is prepared, for example the preparation of boarding aids.

== Incidents ==
On 4 May 1998, eleven wagons of a freight train which was carrying iron ore from Port Talbot derailed just east of the station, causing substantial damage to the track, as well as blocking the main line into the station. This caused enormous disruption to the services which lasted for several days. No-one however was injured in the incident.

To the east of the platforms, the Valley Lines tracks rise up and cross over the South Wales Main Line using a bridge. Rail services were severely disrupted in August 2012 when the retaining wall between the tracks partially collapsed, spilling five tonnes of earth. The South Wales Main Line was swiftly reopened, but all services between Cardiff Central and were cancelled, with a replacement bus service operating. It was expected that repairs could take two weeks. There were worries that the bronze medal match in the 2012 Summer Olympics men&#x27;s football competition, held at the nearby Cardiff Millennium Stadium could be disrupted, but most fans were due to arrive by the main line rather than the Valley Lines. There had been severe congestion at the station earlier in the month due to another Olympic match.

In December 2016, a serious accident was narrowly averted by the alertness of a driver. During the Cardiff Area Resignalling Scheme, a set of points had been left in an unsafe condition, and undetectable by the signalling system. The Rail Accident Investigation Branch report into the incident revealed that lessons learnt following the Clapham Junction rail crash in December 1988 appeared to have been forgotten. Excessive working hours and a lack of detailed planning were cited as contributory factors.

==Media==
In 2020, the Rail Delivery Group nominated Cardiff Central as one of the Welsh stations as a contender for the World Cup of Stations. It passed the group stages and was the Wales contender in the semi-finals. However, it lost to Stourbridge Junction railway station to reach the final in the west region.

<text>The State University of New York Buffalo State University (colloquially referred to as Buffalo State University, SUNY Buffalo State, Buffalo State, or simply Buff State) is a public university in Buffalo, New York. It is part of the State University of New York (SUNY) system. Buffalo State University was founded in 1871 as the Buffalo Normal School to train teachers. It offers 79 undergraduate majors with 11 honors options, 11 post baccalaureate teacher certification programs, and 64 graduate programs.

==History==
Buffalo State was founded in 1871 as the before becoming the (1888–1927), the (1928–1946), the (1946–1950), (1950–1951), the (1951–1959), the (1960–1961), (1961), and in 2023.

Eighty-six students attended the Buffalo Normal School on the first day of classes on September 13, 1871. The school&#x27;s purpose was to provide a uniform training program for teachers to serve Buffalo&#x27;s fast-growing public school population. Curricular offerings now include more than 250 undergraduate and graduate programs.

The WWII years were another time of growth for the college; in 1944, the now renowned Special Education program was founded and in 1948, the first dormitory building was erected where the present-day Moot Hall is located. In 1961, Buffalo State was the first institution in the SUNY system to offer a study-abroad program, a semester-long immersion program in Siena, Italy. International study programs now include international exchange and study-abroad programs in Australia, Canada, England, Italy, the Netherlands, Puerto Rico, and Spain.

In 1964, the Buffalo State University Planetarium opened its doors with a 24-foot dome, and Dr. James Orgren became the facility&#x27;s director in 1966. On November 17, 1978, a fire destroyed the facility, but the community&#x27;s generosity allowed it to reopen on April 18, 1980. In April 1982, it was renamed the Whitworth Ferguson Planetarium in honor of its greatest benefactor. In 1984, Dr. Orgren hired Mr. Arthur Gielow as his successor. Mr. Gielow died in 2010, and after a brief remodeling, the planetarium reopened in 2011 under the direction of Dr. Kevin Williams. In January 2013, the planetarium hosted a closing ceremony that highlighted its 48-year history. Through 2010–2012, staff members Tim Collins, Stephen Dubois and Terry Farrell created several programs. In 2015, a generous donation allowed the planetarium to reopen with a temporary 20-foot inflatable fulldome system. The new 35-foot dome facility is now open in the Science And Math Complex building.

<text>The 61st (2nd South Midland) Division was an infantry division of the British Army raised in 1915 during the Great War as a second-line reserve for the first-line battalions of the 48th (South Midland) Division. The division was sent to the Western Front in May 1916 and served there for the duration of the First World War.

==Unit history==
The division landed in France in May 1916. On 19 July 1916, together with the 5th Australian Division, the 61st Division fought the Battle of Fromelles, designed as a feint attack as part of the Somme Offensive. The attack, against well prepared German positions based on a ridge, was a disaster and responsible for the subsequent poor reputation of the Division. The division later took part in the advance to the Hindenburg Line and the Third Battle of Ypres.

<doc id="465616" wikidata="Q798416" url="?curid=465616" title="John Hancock Tower">
<text>The John Hancock Tower, colloquially known as the Hancock, is a 60-story, skyscraper in the Back Bay neighborhood of downtown Boston, Massachusetts. The pinnacle height (including antennas) is . Designed by Henry N. Cobb of the firm I. M. Pei &amp; Partners, it was completed in 1976, and has held the title as the tallest building in New England ever since. In 2015, the lease belonging to the John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Company, for which the skyscraper was named, expired, and it was renamed to its address at 200 Clarendon Street.

The building is widely known for its prominent structural flaws, including an analysis that the entire building could overturn under certain wind loads and a prominent design failure of its signature blue windows, which allowed any of the window panes to detach and fall, up to the full height of the building, endangering pedestrians below.

The street address is 200 Clarendon Street, but occupants also use &quot;Hancock Place&quot; as a mailing address for offices in the building. John Hancock Insurance was the primary tenant of the building at opening, but the company announced in 2004 that some offices would relocate to a new building at 601 Congress Street, in Fort Point, Boston.

The tower was originally named for the insurance company that occupied it. The insurance company, in turn, was named for John Hancock, whose large and conspicuous signature on the Declaration of Independence made his name so famous in the United States that a colloquialism for a signature is &quot;a John Hancock&quot;.

==Architecture==
Minimalism was the design principle behind the tower. The largest possible panes of glass were used, there are no spandrel panels, and the mullions are minimal. Cobb added a geometric modernist twist by using a parallelogram shape for the tower floor plan. From the most-common views, this design makes the corners of the tower appear very sharp. The highly-reflective window glass is tinted slightly blue, which results in the tower having only a subtle contrast with the sky on a clear day. As a final modernist touch, the short sides of the parallelogram are each marked with a deep vertical notch, breaking up the tower&#x27;s mass and emphasizing its verticality. In late evening, the vertical notch to the northwest catches the last light of the sky, while the larger portions of glass reflect the darkening sky.

A major concern of the architects while designing the tower was its proximity to Boston&#x27;s Trinity Church, a prominent National Historic Landmark. Their concern led them to redesign the tower&#x27;s plans, as there was a public outcry when it was revealed that the Hancock Tower would cast its shadow on the church.

In 1977, the American Institute of Architects presented the firm with a National Honor Award for the building, and in 2011 conferred on it the Twenty-five Year Award.

==Engineering flaws==

The building was a much-anticipated landmark designed by a well-respected architect, but was known in the 1970s for its engineering flaws as well as for its architectural achievement. The opening of the building was delayed from 1971 to 1976, and the total cost is rumored to have increased from $75 million to $175 million. It was an embarrassment for the firm, for modernist architects, and for the architecture industry.

During the excavation for the tower&#x27;s foundation, temporary steel retaining walls were erected to create a space in which to build. The walls warped, giving way to the clay and mud fill of the Back Bay which they were supposed to hold back. The shifting soils damaged utility lines, the sidewalk pavement, and nearby buildings—including the historic Trinity Church across St. James Avenue. Trinity Church won an $11 million lawsuit to pay for repairs.

There were problems with the innovative use of blue reflective glass in a steel tower: entire windowpanes, and , detached from the building and crashed to the sidewalk hundreds of feet below. Police closed off surrounding streets whenever winds reached . Under the direction of Frank H. Durgin of MIT&#x27;s Wright Brothers Wind Tunnel a scale model of the entire Back Bay and an aeroelastic model of the John Hancock Tower were built and tested in the wind tunnel to identify the problem. The research raised questions about the structural integrity of the entire building (due to unanticipated twisting of the structure), but did not account for the loss of the glass panels. An independent laboratory eventually confirmed that the failure of the glass was due to oscillations and repeated thermal stresses caused by the expansion and contraction of the air between the inner and outer glass panels which formed each window; the resilient bonding between the inner glass, reflective material, and outer glass was so stiff that it was transmitting the force to the outer glass (instead of absorbing it), thus causing the glass to fail.

In October 1973, I.M. Pei &amp; Partners announced that all 10,344 window panes would each be replaced by single-paned, heat-treated panels at a total cost between $5 million and $7 million. Approximately 5,000 of the original glass panes were removed intact, and were later offered for re-use by artists. Glass panes were sold to Hingham based retailer Building #19, who sold them for $100 apiece. They advertised &quot;If it does fall out, we promise to sell you the replacement plywood very cheap.&quot;

During the many months it took to diagnose and repair the building, sheets of plywood replaced many of the missing glass windows of the building, earning it the nicknames &quot;Plywood Ranch&quot; (the same name as a local lumber yard chain at the time) and &quot;Plywood Palace&quot;, much to the consternation of the VP in charge of construction. According to engineers Matthys Levy and Mario Salvadori, the replacement also inspired jokes that the Hancock Tower was the &quot;world&#x27;s tallest wooden building.&quot;

The building&#x27;s upper-floor occupants suffered from motion sickness when the building swayed in the wind. To reduce the movement, contractors installed a tuned mass damper on the 58th floor. As described by Robert Campbell, architecture critic for &quot;The Boston Globe&quot;:

Two 300-ton weights sit at opposite ends of the 58th floor of the Hancock. Each weight is a box of steel, filled with lead, 17 feet square by 3 feet high. Each weight rests on a steel plate. The plate is covered with lubricant so the weight is free to slide. But the weight is attached to the steel frame of the building by means of springs and shock absorbers. When the Hancock sways, the weight tends to remain still, allowing the floor to slide underneath it. Then, as the springs and shocks take hold, they begin to tug the building back. The effect is like that of a gyroscope, stabilizing the tower. The reason there are two weights, instead of one, is so they can tug in opposite directions when the building twists. The cost of the damper was $3 million. The dampers are free to move a few feet relative to the floor.

According to Campbell, engineers discovered that—despite the mass damper—the building could have fallen over under a certain kind of wind loading. The structure was assessed as more unstable on its narrow sides than on the big flat sides. Some 1,500 tons of diagonal steel bracing, costing $5 million, were added to prevent such an event.

==History==
An observation deck with views of Boston was a tourist attraction for several decades. However, it was closed after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. After the closure of the John Hancock Tower&#x27;s observation deck, the building with the highest observation deck open to the public in Boston became the Prudential Tower.

The building&#x27;s owners cite security as the reason for the continued closure. They have rented the deck for private functions and have expressed intent to replace it with more office space. Boston city officials contend that security concerns are moot, since most similar attractions have long since reopened. In addition, they note that a public observation deck was a requirement for the original building permits to gain public benefit from the high tower. However, officials have not been able to locate the documentation of this requirement.

In 2006, Broadway Partners acquired Hancock Place for $1.3 billion. By 2009, they had defaulted on the loans they used to buy the building, and it fell into foreclosure. On March 30, 2009, Hancock Place was sold at auction for $660 million ($20 million was new equity and the $640 million of in-place debt was assumed by the buyer) to a consortium of Normandy Real Estate Partners and Five Mile Capital Partners. The companies had been slowly increasing their investment over the previous months. In October 2010, Boston Properties acquired the John Hancock Tower for $930 million. As part of the purchase agreement, the name &quot;Hancock Tower&quot; would expire along with John Hancock&#x27;s lease in 2015.

The company that built the Hancock Tower and two earlier, similarly-named buildings is known loosely as &quot;John Hancock Insurance&quot;, or simply &quot;John Hancock&quot;. It was known as &quot;The John Hancock Life Insurance Company&quot; in the 1930s and &quot;The John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Company&quot; in the 1940s. As of 2000, the company owning the buildings was &quot;John Hancock Financial Services, Inc.&quot; with various subsidiaries such as &quot;The John Hancock Variable Life Insurance Company&quot; and &quot;Signator Investors, Inc.&quot; In 2003, Manulife Financial Corporation of Toronto acquired the company, but it still uses the name &quot;John Hancock Financial Services, Inc.&quot; and those of various subsidiaries.

The name change from &quot;John Hancock&quot; to &quot;200 Clarendon&quot; took place in mid-2015, when the Hancock&#x27;s lease expired. It had been stipulated in the leasing contract that the building would retain the name &quot;John Hancock&quot; only so long as John Hancock Financial was an occupant.

== In popular culture ==

About a year after the falling windows problem was resolved, American novelist John Updike wrote in a story,
The building can also be found in the game Need For Speed Most Wanted 2012 in the fictional city of Fairhaven City in the Downtown district

The TV series &quot;Fringe&quot; shows the building as the location of FBI Headquarters. At the time, the actual FBI Boston headquarters was located at One Center Plaza, though it has since relocated to nearby Chelsea.

In September 2015, the French photographer and artist JR created a tall mural of a man wearing shorts, between the 44th and 50th floors of the building. According to the property manager, the mural was the final piece in a three-part series of temporary public art projects at the building.

In the 2019 film &quot;&quot;, the John Hancock Tower is depicted being destroyed in the battle between Godzilla and King Ghidorah when the former behemoth pushes the alien into the building.

<doc id="465619" wikidata="Q569869" url="?curid=465619" title="In Praise of Folly">
<text>In Praise of Folly, also translated as The Praise of Folly ( or ), is an essay written in Latin in 1509 by Desiderius Erasmus of Rotterdam and first printed in June 1511. Inspired by previous works of the Italian humanist &quot;De Triumpho Stultitiae&quot;, it is a spiralling satirical attack on all aspects of human life, not ignoring superstitions and religious corruption, but with a pivot into an orthodox religious purpose.

Erasmus revised and extended his work, which was originally written in the span of a week while sojourning with Sir Thomas More at More&#x27;s house in Bucklersbury in the City of London. The title &quot;Moriae Encomium&quot; had a punning second meaning as &quot;In Praise of More&quot; (in Greek &quot;moría&quot; translates into &quot;folly&quot;). &quot;In Praise of Folly&quot; is considered one of the most notable works of the Renaissance and played an important role in the beginnings of the Protestant Reformation.

==Content==

&quot;The Praise of Folly&quot; begins with a satirical learned encomium, in which Folly praises herself, in the manner of the Greek satirist Lucian (2nd century AD), whose work Erasmus and Sir Thomas More had recently translated into Latin; Folly swipes at every part of society, from lovers to princes to inventors to writers to dice-players to professional liars to hermits.

It then takes a darker tone in a series of orations, as Folly praises self-deception and madness and moves to a satirical examination of supposedly pious but superstitious abuses of Catholic doctrine and corrupt practices by the people and priests of the contemporary church—to which Erasmus was ever faithful—and the folly of pedants. Folly increasingly takes on Erasmus&#x27; own chastising voice. According to some source, the essay ends with a straightforward statement of Christian ideal: &quot;No Man is wise at all Times, or is without his blind Side.&quot;

Erasmus was a good friend of More, with whom he shared a taste for dry humour and other intellectual pursuits. The title &quot;Moriae Encomium&quot; could also be read as meaning &quot;In praise of More&quot;. The double or triple meanings go on throughout the text.

The piece is filled with classical allusions delivered in a style typical of the learned humanists of the Renaissance. Folly parades as a goddess, offspring of Plutus, the god of wealth and a nymph, Youth. She was nursed by two other nymphs, Inebriation and Ignorance. Her faithful companions include Philautia (self-love), Kolakia (flattery), Lethe (forgetfulness), Misoponia (laziness), Hedone (pleasure), Anoia (dementia), Tryphe (wantonness), and two gods, Komos (intemperance) and Nigretos Hypnos (heavy sleep). Folly praises herself endlessly, arguing that life would be dull and distasteful without her. Of earthly existence, Folly pompously states, &quot;you&#x27;ll find nothing frolic or fortunate that it owes not to me.&quot;

In one of the notable pivots in the Praise of Folly, the book turns out to be almost an elaborate sermon on 1 Corinthians 1:21-23, the &quot;folly on the cross&quot;.

Many subsequent commentators characterize the book only as a satire against the Roman Catholic church itself, or its doctrines, rather than about the moral decisions of humans regardless of lifestyle or state: the contrast between human wisdom which is actually folly and the divine folly which is wisdom.

==Translations and Editions==
From 1541, Latin editions frequently included &quot;Commentary of Girardus Listrius&quot; Listrius was helped by Erasmus to complete the commentary for Froben in 1515, and may have been a pseudonym for Erasmus. Erasmus made many small changes to &quot;Folly&quot; between editions. 

As with several of Erasmus&#x27; works, translations often had interpolations and choices of a sectarian nature that did not reflect the original. It may be from these that the summary of the book as an &quot;attack on the Western church&quot; comes.

=== Comparative texts===
The Latin has &quot;Moriae&quot; (Folly) which is a pun and allusion to &quot;Mariae&quot;, that Mary Magdalene had the best part (Mark 10:42). Most English translations go directly to Mary here. 

* Latin: &quot;Primum igitur existimate, Platonem tale quiddam iam tum somniasse, cum, amantium furorem omnium felicissimum esse, scriberet. Etenim qui vehementer amat iam non in se vivit, sed in eo quod amat, quoque longius a se ipso digreditur, et in illud demigrat, hoc magis ac magis gaudet[...] Atque, haec est Moriae pars, quae non aufertur commutatione vitae, sed perficitur.&quot; 
* Chaloner: &quot;Fyrst therfore ye must thinke, that Plato didde evin then dreame of suche a thyng, whan he wrote, that &quot;the passion and extreme rage of feruent lovers was to be desired and embrased, as a thing above all others most blisfull&quot;: because that a vehement lover liveth not now in hym selfe, but rather in that that he loveth, so that the further &amp; further a lovers hert is distraught from him selfe, to dwell with the beloved, the more and more he rejoyseth. [...] And this is &quot;Mary Magdalens&quot; porcion, whiche by chaunge of life shall not be plucked awaie, but rather be more perfitely confyrmed.&quot;
* unknown: &quot;First, therefore, Plato dreamed somewhat of this nature when he tells us that the madness of lovers was of all other dispositions of the body most desirable; for he who is once thoroughly smitten with this passion, lives no longer within himself, but has removed his soul to the same place where he has settled his affections, and loses himself to find the object he so much dotes upon: this straying now, and wandering of a soul from its own mansion, what is it better than a plain transport of madness? [...] This likewise is that better part which Mary chose, which shall not be taken from her, but perfected and completed by her mortal putting on immortality.&quot;
* John Wilson: &quot;And therefore suppose that Plato dreamed of somewhat like it when he called the madness of lovers the most happy condition of all others. For he that&#x27;s violently in love lives not in his own body but in the thing he loves; and by how much the farther he runs from himself into another, by so much the greater is his pleasure. [...] And this is that Mary&#x27;s better part which is not taken away by change of life, but perfected.&quot;

==Reception==
&quot;Moriae Encomium&quot; was hugely popular, to Erasmus&#x27; astonishment and sometimes his dismay. Pope Leo X and Cardinal Cisneros are said to have found it amusing. Erasmus&#x27; close friends had been initially skeptical and warned him of possible dangers to himself of being seen as attacking the establishment.

Before Erasmus&#x27; death it had already passed into numerous editions and had been translated into Czech, French, and German. An English edition soon followed. It influenced the teaching of rhetoric during the later sixteenth century, and the art of adoxography or praise of worthless subjects became a popular exercise in Elizabethan grammar schools. A copy of the Basel edition of 1515/16 was illustrated with pen and ink drawings by Hans Holbein the Younger. These are the most famous illustrations of &quot;In Praise of Folly&quot;.

Its role in the beginnings of the Protestant Reformation stems from its supposed criticism of the practices of the Church and its political allies.

Erasmus subsequently wrote that he almost regretted writing it, such had been the trouble it had caused him. But this trouble did not come from the satirized princes, popes, bishops, abbots, cardinals, famous scholars, courtiers, magistrates or wives, but from certain theologians.

It has been called &quot;a notoriously difficult text&quot; to analyse.

<text>Dictyoglomus is a genus of bacterium, given its own Phylum, called the Dictyoglomi.
This organism is extremely &quot;thermophilic&quot;, meaning it thrives at extremely high temperatures. It is &quot;chemoorganotrophic&quot;, meaning it derives energy by metabolizing organic molecules. This organism is of interest because it elaborates an enzyme, xylanase, which digests xylan, a heteropolymer of the pentose sugar xylose. By pretreating wood pulp with this enzyme, paper manufacturers can achieve comparable levels of whiteness with much less chlorine bleach.

It has been described as Gram-negative, with a triple-layered wall.

<doc id="465622" wikidata="Q1426433" url="?curid=465622" title="Ozone therapy">
<text>Ozone therapy is an alternative medical treatment that introduces ozone or ozonides to the body. The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) prohibits all medical uses of ozone &quot;in any medical condition for which there is no proof of safety and effectiveness&quot;, stating &quot;ozone is a toxic gas with no known useful medical application in specific, adjunctive, or preventive therapy. For ozone to be germicidal, it must be present in a concentration far greater than that which can be safely tolerated by man and animals.&quot;

Ozone therapy has been sold as an unproven treatment for various illnesses, including cancer, a practice which has been characterized as &quot;pure quackery&quot;. The therapy can cause serious adverse effects, including death.

== Proposed uses ==
Ozone therapy consists of the introduction of ozone into the body via various methods, usually involving its mixture with various gases and liquids before injection, with potential routes including the vagina, rectum, into a muscle, under the skin, or directly into a vein. Ozone can also be introduced via autohemotherapy, in which blood is drawn from the patient, exposed to ozone, and re-injected into the patient.

This therapy has been proposed as a primary or adjunct therapy for various diseases, including osteoarthritis, herniated disk, chronic wounds, hepatitis B and C, herpes zoster, HIV-AIDS, multiple sclerosis, cancer, heart disease, Alzheimer&#x27;s dementia, and Lyme disease, though supportive evidence for some of these applications is limited. The American Cancer Society warned in 2010 that evidence for the efficacy of ozone therapy against cancer is inconclusive, and the therapy may be dangerous. For treatment of HIV/AIDS, although ozone deactivates the viral particles in vitro, well-designed studies have shown there is no benefit for living patients.

The United States Food and Drug Administration initially stated in 1976, and reiterated its position in 2006, that when inhaled, ozone is a toxic gas that has no demonstrated safe medical application, though their position statements primarily deal with its potential for causing inflammation and pulmonary edema in the lungs. They also emphasize that for ozone to be effective as a germicide, it must be present at concentrations far greater than can be safely tolerated by humans or other animals. More recent reviews have highlighted that different routes of administration may result in different therapeutic and side-effect profiles.

Some reviews have suggested ozone as a potential treatment for herniated discs and diabetic neuropathy. There is some controversy about its use by athletes to increase performance despite numerous adverse side effects within the pulmonary and/or skeletal muscle systems. Although its use is not disallowed in and of itself, it can be mixed with banned substances for administration prior to injection.

== Safety ==

Ozone therapy has potentially serious adverse effects, and at least five deaths had been reported due to the therapy&#x27;s use on people with cancer. From 1975 to 1983 in Germany, research revealed six deaths, four cases of visual disturbance, three cases of paraplegias, four gas embolisms in the pulmonary circuit, two myocardial infarction, four pulmonary embolisms, two cases of apoplexy paralysis, and two cases of cardiac arrhythmia following ozone therapy. More commonly, pulmonary edema is the most prevalent adverse effect of ozone treatment. In the muscular system, many cases of tendon rupture, osteoarthritis, myositis, synovitis, joint infections, and muscle tears have been documented as results of ozone therapy. In the integumentary system, benign skin discoloration is most common. These all occurred following direct injection of O2/O3 gas: a method now regarded as malpractice by most ozone practitioners. In each case, the clinical picture corresponded either to gas embolism, or allergic shock. The fact that one case of apparent allergic shock followed the injection of a minute quantity of gas raises the unknown possibility that other methods of administration might also carry the risk of allergic shock.

Much of the concern related to ozone therapy revolves around the safety of blood ozonation. When inhaled by mammals in high levels, ozone reacts with compounds in tissues lining the lungs and triggers a cascade of pathological effects, including pulmonary edema, however, ozone therapy does not usually involve inhalation of ozone gas. It has been argued that while peroxides (a product of ozone) are naturally generated inside phagocyte cells to kill bacteria, outside the cell they can damage tissue. Proponents suggest that its effects are tissue-dependent, though the subject is still debated.

Other serious incidents reported include transmission of hepatitis C. Ozone-based treatments can be associated with central nervous system toxicity, termed Ozone Induced Encephalopathy (OIE).

== Regulation and ethics ==

The FDA prohibits the medical use of ozone &quot;in any medical condition for which there is no proof of safety and effectiveness&quot;, stating that &quot;ozone is a toxic gas with no known useful medical application in specific, adjunctive, or preventive therapy. For ozone to be germicidal, it must be present in a concentration far greater than that which can be safely tolerated by man and animals.&quot;

Beginning in 1991 the FDA has prosecuted and sent to jail several people presenting themselves as medical doctors and selling ozone therapy products as a medical cure or operating medical clinics using ozone therapy for healing human illness. Arrests following similar activity have been made in other countries as well, including Uganda and Thailand.

Ozone therapy is sold as an expensive alternative cancer treatment in Germany. David Gorski has described the practice as &quot;pure quackery&quot;. Proponents of the therapy falsely claim it is a recognized therapy there, but the German medical establishment has not approved ozone therapy.

In 2009, a panel of experts consulted by Forbes recommended that ozone therapy be included on a &quot;list of the most egregious, dangerous, aggressively marketed health scams.&quot;

Ozone therapy was banned in Malaysia in 2017. The Malaysian Health Ministry determined that the treatment could cause serious harm and had no scientific support as a treatment for any condition.

On 7 August 2023, the Brazilian government legalized ozone therapy as a complementary therapy, ignoring a request for veto due to lack of scientific evidence made in an open letter from the Brazilian National Academy of Medicine.

== History ==

In 1856, just 16 years after its discovery, ozone was first used in a healthcare setting to disinfect operating rooms and sterilize surgical instruments. By the end of the 19th century the use of ozone to disinfect drinking water of bacteria and viruses was well established in mainland Europe.

In 1892 &quot;The Lancet&quot; published an article describing the administration of ozone for treatment of tuberculosis. During World War I, ozone was tested at Queen Alexandra Military Hospital in London as a possible disinfectant for wounds. The gas was applied directly to wounds for as long as 15 minutes. This resulted in damage to both bacterial cells and human tissue. Other sanitizing techniques, such as irrigation with antiseptics, were preferable.

The psychoanalyst Wilhelm Reich was a proponent of ozone therapy, which was supposed to enhance an imaginary life force he called orgone. Reich developed a device utilizing ozonides in his work on bioenergetic analysis.

<text>Karisma Kapoor (; born 25 June 1974) is an Indian actress who appears in Hindi films. One of the most popular and highest-paid Indian actresses of the 1990s and early 2000s, she is a recipient of several accolades, including a National Film Award and four Filmfare Awards.

A part of the Kapoor family, she made her acting debut as a teenager with a leading role in the moderately successful &quot;Prem Qaidi&quot; (1991). Subsequently, Kapoor starred in a number of box office hits, including the dramas &quot;Jigar&quot; (1992) and &quot;Anari&quot; (1993), the comedies &quot;Raja Babu&quot; (1994), &quot; Andaz Apna Apna&quot; (1994), &quot;Coolie No. 1&quot; (1995) and &quot;Saajan Chale Sasural&quot; (1996), and the thriller &quot;Jeet&quot; (1996). However, she was criticized for her brief, repetitive roles and inclination to male-dominated films.

The 1996 blockbuster romance &quot;Raja Hindustani&quot; marked a significant turning point in Kapoor&#x27;s career, earning her praise and a Filmfare Award for Best Actress. She later won the National Film Award and Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actress for her portrayal of a passionate dancer in the musical romance &quot;Dil To Pagal Hai&quot; (1997). Kapoor achieved further success by featuring as the female lead in three of David Dhawan&#x27;s top-grossing romantic comedies—&quot;Hero No.1&quot; (1997), &quot;Biwi No.1&quot; (1999) and &quot;Dulhan Hum Le Jayenge&quot; (2000), and in Sooraj Barjatya&#x27;s highly successful family drama &quot;Hum Saath-Saath Hain&quot; (1999)—and won the Best Actress and Best Actress Critics awards at Filmfare for her titular roles in the dramas &quot;Fiza&quot; (2000) and &quot;Zubeidaa&quot; (2001). Kapoor took a sabbatical from full-time acting in 2004, and has since acted sporadically, starring in the web-series &quot;Mentalhood&quot; (2020) and the mystery thriller &quot;Murder Mubarak&quot; (2024).

Kapoor was married to businessman Sanjay Kapur from 2003–2016; the couple had two children together. Her off-screen life is a subject of substantial media coverage. Kapoor has played the titular character in the television series &quot;Karishma: The Miracles of Destiny&quot; (2003–2004) and has featured as a talent judge for several reality shows. Alongside her acting career, Kapoor participates in stage shows and is a prominent celebrity endorser for various products.

== Early life and background ==
Karisma Kapoor was born on 25 June 1974 in Mumbai, to actors Randhir Kapoor and Babita (&quot;née&quot; Shivdasani). Her younger sister, Kareena Kapoor, is a film actress who is married to actor Saif Ali Khan. Her paternal grandfather was the actor and filmmaker Raj Kapoor, while her maternal grandfather was actor Hari Shivdasani. Her paternal great-grandfather was actor Prithviraj Kapoor. The actors Rishi Kapoor and Rajiv Kapoor are her uncles, while the actress Neetu Singh is her aunt. Her first cousins is the actor Ranbir Kapoor and the businessman Nikhil Nanda. The actors Shammi Kapoor and Shashi Kapoor are her grand-uncles, and the late actress Sadhana was her mother&#x27;s first cousin.

Kapoor is informally called as &quot;Lolo&quot; at her home. According to Kapoor, the name Lolo was derived after her mother made a passing reference to the Italian actress Gina Lollobrigida. Her paternal and maternal grandparents were from Peshawar, Lyallpur and Karachi respectively, who moved to Bombay for their film careers before the partition of India. Kapoor is of Punjabi descent on her father&#x27;s side, and on her mother&#x27;s side she is of Sindhi and British descent.

Particularly inspired by the work of actresses Sridevi and Madhuri Dixit, Kapoor was keen on pursuing acting since childhood. While growing up, Kapoor regularly attended award ceremonies and accompanied her parents to film sets. However, despite her family background, her father disapproved of women working in films, because he believed it conflicted with the traditional maternal duties and responsibility of women in the family. This led to a conflict between her parents and they separated in 1988. She and her sister Kareena were raised by their mother, who worked several jobs to raise them, until she made her debut in films as an actress. The couple reconciled in 2007, after living separately for several years. Kapoor studied at the Cathedral and John Connon School, Mumbai, and later, for a few months, at Sophia College for Women, Mumbai. Kapoor later said that she left college to pursue acting for financial support.

== Career ==
=== Debut and early roles (1991–1995) ===
Kapoor made her acting debut in 1991 at the age of 16 with the romantic drama &quot;Prem Qaidi&quot;, opposite debutant Harish Kumar. Upon release, the film emerged as a moderate box office success and received mixed reviews from critics, as did Kapoor&#x27;s performance, with Taran Adarsh of &quot;Bollywood Hungama&quot; describing it as &quot;mechanical&quot;. The following year, Kapoor&#x27;s first five releases—&quot;Police Officer&quot;, &quot;Jaagruti&quot;, &quot;Nishchaiy&quot;, &quot;Sapne Sajan Ke&quot; and &quot;Deedar&quot;—flopped at the box office. &quot;Jaagruti&quot; and &quot;Nishchaiy&quot; marked her first two collaborations with Salman Khan, while &quot;Deedar&quot; marked her first collaboration with Akshay Kumar. She next starred in the action drama &quot;Jigar&quot; (1992), followed by the romantic drama &quot;Anari&quot; (1993), both of which emerged as box office hits and among the highest-grossing films of their respective years. &quot;Jigar&quot; marked Kapoor&#x27;s first of several collaborations with Ajay Devgn, while &quot;Anari&quot; featured her in the leading role of Rajnandini, a princess who falls in love with her poor servant (played by Daggubati Venkatesh).

Kapoor&#x27;s next four releases of 1993 were the dramas &quot;Muqabla&quot; (which marked first of her many collaborations with Govinda), &quot;Sangraam&quot;, &quot;Shaktiman&quot; and &quot;Dhanwaan&quot;. With the exception of &quot;Muqabla&quot;, none of these films performed well either critically or commercially. In 1994, Kapoor had nine film releases – four of them — &quot;Prem Shakti&quot;, &quot;Dulaara&quot;, &quot;Andaz&quot; and &quot;&quot; — were critical and commercial failures. Her first hit that year was David Dhawan&#x27;s comedy film &quot;Raja Babu&quot;, opposite Govinda, in which she played Madhubala, an educated arrogant girl who calls off her engagement upon discovering her fiancée&#x27;s illiteracy. Kapoor next played the blind wife of Govinda&#x27;s character in the hit action drama &quot;Khuddar&quot;, following which she starred with Salman Khan, Aamir Khan and Raveena Tandon in Rajkumar Santoshi&#x27;s acclaimed comedy film &quot;Andaz Apna Apna&quot;. Kapoor played Raveena Bajaj, the daughter of a London-based business tycoon, who travels to India in search of true love, and falls for Salman Khan&#x27;s character. Although the film underperformed at the box office, it developed a significant cult following over the years since its release.

Kapoor&#x27;s final two releases of the year were the action drama &quot;Suhaag&quot; (alongside Ajay Devgn, Akshay Kumar and Nagma) and the comedy-drama &quot;Gopi Kishan&quot; (alongside Suniel Shetty and Shilpa Shirodkar), both of which were critically and commercially successful. In the former, she starred as a college student and Devgn&#x27;s love interest, while in the latter, she played a police commissioner&#x27;s daughter who falls in love with a criminal. In 1995, after appearing in the box office flops &quot;Jawab&quot; and &quot;Maidan-E-Jung&quot;, Kapoor starred as Malti, a rich girl who marries a poor coolie (played by Govinda) in David Dhawan&#x27;s blockbuster comedy film &quot;Coolie No. 1&quot;. The film garnered positive reviews and emerged as a commercial success, grossing in India. On her initial career struggle, she later said:
When I first entered the industry, things were made tough for me. I am not saying that I was singled out. I think every star kid has to go through this. Everyone was so unfair to me. Other newcomers were praised for every little achievement, but I was not given an iota of acknowledgement. When it came to me, it was always, &#x27;Okay, she has done well, but what&#x27;s the big deal about her?&#x27;. Nobody gave a 17-year-old credit for doing my job reasonably well.

=== Established actress (1996–2000) ===
In 1996, Kapoor appeared in 10 films. Five of them — &quot;Papi Gudia&quot;, &quot;Megha&quot;, &quot;Bal Bramhachari&quot;, &quot;Sapoot&quot; and &quot;Rakshak&quot; — were commercially unsuccessful. Her next release was David Dhawan&#x27;s romantic comedy &quot;Saajan Chale Sasural&quot;, co-starring Govinda and Tabu. &quot;Saajan Chale Sasural&quot; emerged as a commercial success. For her fifth release, Kapoor was paired opposite Suneil Shetty in S. Deepak&#x27;s box office hit &quot;Krishna&quot;. She starred alongside Sunny Deol, Salman Khan and Tabu in Raj Kanwar&#x27;s romantic drama &quot;Jeet&quot;. She played Kajal, a woman who falls in love with a criminal, but ends up marrying another man. Finishing up as the second highest-grossing film of the year, &quot;Jeet&quot; emerged as a &quot;super-hit&quot; at the box office. Critical reaction was positive on both the film as well as Kapoor&#x27;s performance.

That same year, Kapoor starred in Dharmesh Darshan&#x27;s romantic drama &quot;Raja Hindustani&quot; opposite Aamir Khan, in which she played a rich, beautiful heiress who falls for a lowly guide and driver. A modern-day remake of &quot;Jab Jab Phool Khile&quot; (1965), the film emerged as the highest-grossing film of the year and won Kapoor her first Filmfare Award for Best Actress. Reviewing her performance for &quot;India Today&quot;, Anupama Chopra described Kapoor as a &quot;revelation&quot; and &quot;the lifeblood of this otherwise banal film.&quot; The film&#x27;s success established Kapoor as a leading actress of Hindi cinema, and marked a significant turning point in her career. &quot;Raja Hindustani&quot; was not only the biggest commercial success of 1996, but also one of the most successful films of all time in India with worldwide revenues of . Kapoor&#x27;s final release of 1996 was Suneel Darshan&#x27;s action film &quot;Ajay&quot;, with Sunny Deol. The film was also a financial success.

In 1997, Kapoor re-united with David Dhawan for two projects, the comedy film &quot;Judwaa&quot; (alongside Salman Khan and Rambha), and the romantic comedy &quot;Hero No. 1&quot; (opposite Govinda). The former&#x27;s concept was similar to &quot;Gopi Kishan&quot; – it tells the story of twin brothers who are separated at birth and re-unite in their youth. Kapoor and Rambha played the love interests of Khan&#x27;s characters. In &quot;Hero No. 1&quot;, she played Meena Nath, a girl who falls in love with Govinda&#x27;s character despite facing disapproval from her strict grandfather (played by Paresh Rawal). Both films were critically and commercially successful, and Kapoor gained praise for her comedic timing. She eventually received a nomination for the Zee Cine Award for Best Actress for &quot;Hero No. 1&quot;. She next starred in the Mehul Kumar-directed dramas &quot;Lahu Ke Do Rang&quot; and &quot;Mrityudata&quot;, both of which were critical and commercial failures.

Kapoor&#x27;s fifth and final release of 1997 was Yash Chopra&#x27;s musical romantic drama &quot;Dil To Pagal Hai&quot;. Co-starring Shah Rukh Khan, Madhuri Dixit and Akshay Kumar, the film depicts the love lives of the cast and crew in a musical dance troupe. Kapoor played Nisha, a bubbly dancer who secretly falls in love with her best friend (played by Khan), who unites with the girl he loves (played by Dixit). Initially hesitant to take on the supporting role, Kapoor was cast by Chopra (who was impressed by her work in &quot;Raja Hindustani&quot;) after several leading actresses of the time had rejected it. &quot;Dil To Pagal Hai&quot; emerged as a blockbuster at the box office and proved to be the highest-grossing film of the year. Kapoor received widespread praise for her portrayal, and she eventually won the National Film Award and Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actress.

Kapoor&#x27;s diminutive comeback in 1999 proved to be good as she took part in the year&#x27;s most successful films. Kapoor starred in four hits. She next re-united with Dhawan and Salman Khan (alongside Sushmita Sen) for the romantic comedy &quot;Biwi No.1&quot;, in which she portrayed Pooja, a woman whose husband gets involved in an extra-marital affair with a model. The film, which emerged as a major commercial success, earned Kapoor critical praise for her performance. Kapoor received a second Best Actress nomination at Filmfare for her work in the film. She proved to be successful with comedy films, as another of David Dhawan&#x27;s films &quot;Haseena Maan Jaayegi&quot;, did fairly well at the box office. Kapoor collaborated for the first time with the Rajshri Productions for the family drama &quot;Hum Saath-Saath Hain: We Stand United&quot;. The film featured an ensemble cast (Mohnish Behl, Salman Khan, Saif Ali Khan, Tabu and Sonali Bendre), proving to be one of the biggest Hindi film successes of all time in the market, earning worldwide. Her last release of the year, &quot;Jaanwar&quot;, opposite Akshay Kumar, was another box office hit, making her the most successful actress of the year. &quot;Silsila Hai Pyar Ka&quot; was her other film of the year.

Kapoor&#x27;s first release of 2000 was Dhawan&#x27;s romantic comedy &quot;Dulhan Hum Le Jayenge&quot;, opposite Salman Khan. She played Sapna, a girl who falls for Khan&#x27;s character while on a foreign trip, however, she finds it tough to convince her three uncles of this relationship. The film finished up as one of the biggest hits of the year. Aparajita Saha of &quot;Rediff&quot; commented: &quot;Karisma Kapoor and Salman Khan elicit more than their fair share of cat-calls in the movie and make a delectable pair. Both are in form – Karisma looks glamorous and at ease while Salman has perfected the lost-boy-muscle-man get-up&quot;. Kapoor&#x27;s next two releases, the romantic comedies &quot;Chal Mere Bhai&quot; (opposite Khan and Dutt) and &quot;Hum To Mohabbat Karega&quot; (opposite Bobby Deol) failed to do well at the box office.

That same year, Kapoor won her second Filmfare Award for Best Actress for portraying the title role of a disillusioned girl in search of her brother, in Khalid Mohammed&#x27;s acclaimed crime drama &quot;Fiza&quot;. Cast against type in a non-glamorous role, her performance was highly applauded and several critics noted her for showing great emotional range and depth. Mimmy Jain of &quot;The Indian Express&quot;, in a positive review, wrote: &quot;As the young girl who is sick of the suspense and disruption that her brother&#x27;s disappearance has caused in her family&#x27;s life, as the obstinate daughter who will not listen to her mother&#x27;s plea to let her keep hoping for her son, as the determined sister who keeps on in her hunt for her brother despite all odds and then seeks to keep him on the right path, this is a new Karisma, and one that delivers a superbly flawless performance.&quot; The film emerged as a &quot;semi-hit&quot; at the box office with a worldwide gross of .

=== Critical recognition and hiatus (2001–2011) ===

In 2001, she achieved further critical acclaim for her portrayal of an ill-fated actress in the biographical drama &quot;Zubeidaa&quot;. Directed by Shyam Benegal, the film was based on the life of Zubeida Begum, who married Hanwant Singh. &quot;The Tribune&quot; complimented her by arguing that she &quot;has surpassed herself as the passionate, defiant, willful and troubled Zubeidaa, the truly modern woman.&quot; In an interview with &quot;Rediff&quot; she explained: &quot;I have been here so long, I have done everything. lead roles, supporting roles, everything. How do I grow as a performer? If I keep doing commercial cinema, I will stagnate and I wanted to grow&quot;. For her work, she won the Filmfare Critics Award for Best Actress and garnered a Best Actress nomination at the ceremony. Co-starring Rekha and Manoj Bajpai, the film had worldwide earnings of over . She next starred alongside Bobby Deol and Rahul Dev in Indra Kumar&#x27;s &quot;Aashiq&quot; – the movie received little praise from critics, though it proved to be a modest success, grossing over domestically. Suneel Darshan&#x27;s social drama &quot;Ek Rishtaa: The Bond of Love&quot; was Kapoor&#x27;s next release. Co-starring Amitabh Bachchan and Akshay Kumar, the film became one of the biggest hits of the year.

In 2002, Kapoor had three film releases, the first of which was the romantic drama &quot;Haan Maine Bhi Pyaar Kiya&quot;, opposite Akshay Kumar and Abhishek Bachchan. She next starred alongside Nana Patekar in the woman-centric drama &quot;&quot;, playing the role of Nandini, a woman who wants to escape from her in-laws (involved in feudal gang wars) along with her son, after her husband&#x27;s death. The film, a remake of the Telugu film &quot;Antahpuram&quot; (1998), was itself based on the life of author Betty Mahmoody. &quot;Shakti: The Power&quot; was critically acclaimed and also earned Kapoor highly positive reviews for her portrayal – Taran Adarsh reviewed: &quot;The power clearly belongs to Kapoor. Breathing fire and venom to win back her son from the clutches of a despot, the actress gives it all to the character of a helpless mother and proves what a virtuoso performer she is. Playing the part of a wounded tigress, this is one performance that overshadows all the performances the year has seen so far&quot;. Kapoor&#x27;s work in the film earned her Best Actress nominations at several award ceremonies, including a fifth nomination at Filmfare. Her final release that year was Indra Kumar&#x27;s romantic drama &quot;Rishtey&quot;, alongside Anil Kapoor and Shilpa Shetty. She featured as Komal, a wealthy woman who falls in love with a poorer man and marries him against her father&#x27;s wishes. Despite much anticipation, Kapoor&#x27;s all three releases that year underperformed at the box office.

In 2003, she starred in &quot;&quot;, which was her only release that year. The film performed poorly at the box-office. Later in the same year, she made her television debut in the Sahara One soap opera &quot;Karishma – The Miracles Of Destiny&quot;, in which she played a dual role of a grandmother and granddaughter. The serial ended after 260 episodes in 2004 and she took a sabbatical from full-time acting for several years.

In 2006, Kapoor was seen in &quot;Mere Jeevan Saathi&quot; – the film had been shot and completed in 2003, but was delayed for three years. In 2008, alongside actor Arjun Rampal and director–choreographer Farah Khan, Kapoor began judging season four of the dance show &quot;Nach Baliye&quot;, and continued the following year with the comedy show &quot;Hans Baliye&quot;. In addition, she had a cameo in the song &quot;Deewangi Deewangi&quot; from the 2007 melodrama &quot;Om Shanti Om&quot;, and in 2008, was as a guest on the reality television show &quot;Wife Bina Life&quot; (2010).

=== Intermittent work (2012–present) ===
Kapoor made her comeback as an actress with a leading role in Vikram Bhatt&#x27;s supernatural thriller &quot;Dangerous Ishhq&quot;, in 2012. Co-starring Rajneesh Duggal, the film spans a period of four centuries and tells four different love stories set in different time periods. Kapoor played four characters, one from each century. A major critical and box office failure, the film generated positive reviews for Kapoor&#x27;s portrayal. Taran Adarsh of &quot;Bollywood Hungama&quot; commented: &quot;Kapoor puts forth her best efforts, getting to deliver lines in varied dialects. She gets the dialects right, especially Urdu and Rajasthani, but there&#x27;s not much scope for her to display her acting prowess&quot;. In 2013, Kapoor made a special appearance along with several other actors in the titular song of the anthology film &quot;Bombay Talkies&quot;, which was made to honour the Hindi film industry for completing a centenary.

In 2018, Kapoor made a special appearance in the Aanand L. Rai-directed romantic comedy &quot;Zero&quot;. Kapoor made her web debut with Ekta Kapoor&#x27;s &quot;Mentalhood&quot; that released on ALTBalaji in 2020. The series revolves around different natures of mothers and showcases how they try their best to raise their children. Devansh Sharma of &quot;Firstpost&quot; opined, &quot;One gradually warms up to Karisma in &quot;Mentalhood&quot;. Not at any point does she attempt to steal the spotlight, and blends well into the stellar ensemble the show offers.&quot;

In 2024, Kapoor made her comeback to films, with Homi Adajania&#x27;s mystery-thriller, &quot;Murder Mubarak&quot;, portraying a sophisticated actress, Shehnaz Noorani. Pratikshya Mishra from &quot;The Quint&quot; praised her for playing an &quot;elusive star&quot; and noted, &quot;The tragedy evident in her characterisation comes through purely because of how expressive her eyes can be.&quot; Kapoor has completed her second web series, &quot;Brown&quot;.

== Personal life ==
Kapoor was in a relationship with her &quot;Jigar&quot; co-star Ajay Devgn from 1992 till they broke up in 1995. She got engaged to Abhishek Bachchan in 2002, but the engagement was called off after a few months. This ended their relationship of a few years and no reason was given for the break-up.

On 29 September 2003, she married industrialist Sunjay Kapur, the CEO of Sixt India, in a high-profile Sikh wedding ceremony at her ancestral home, Krishna Raj Bungalow, in Mumbai.

In November 2015, the couple had filed applications to withdraw their consent to it. The couple&#x27;s divorce was finalised in 2016.

In 2016, Karisma Kapoor filed a domestic violence case against Sunjay Kapur and his mother, accusing them of physical abuse and claiming Sunjay was involved with another woman. She also filed a dowry harassment case, leading to a summons for Sunjay by the Mumbai police. The couple was already locked in a bitter divorce and custody battle.

In 2024, Karisma further accused Sunjay of domestic abuse in her divorce plea, alleging that during their honeymoon, he forced her to sleep with his friends. She also claimed that Sunjay once told his mother to slap her when she couldn&#x27;t fit into a dress while pregnant.

On taking a break from her acting career for her kids and family, Kapoor said, it was a &quot;conscious decision&quot;. She further said,

Deven Sharma of &quot;Filmfare&quot; termed Kapoor &quot;a force to reckon with commercially&quot;, and noted, &quot;Karisma Kapoor was a strong contender to both Madhuri Dixit and Sridevi’s domination to the ’90s.&quot; She has been described by &quot;The Tribune&quot; as &quot;possessing exuberance and energy&quot;. &quot;The Times of India&quot; termed her &quot;inimitable&quot; due to her body of work and the essence that she brought into movies in the 90s. &quot;Rediff.com&quot; said that Kapoor did everything from &quot;raunchy numbers&quot; to &quot;serious roles&quot;.

<doc id="465626" wikidata="Q7129609" url="?curid=465626" title="Caucasian race">
<text>The Caucasian race (also Caucasoid, Europid, or Europoid) is an obsolete racial classification of humans based on a now-disproven theory of biological race. The &quot;Caucasian race&quot; was historically regarded as a biological taxon which, depending on which of the historical race classifications was being used, usually included ancient and modern populations from all or parts of Europe, Western Asia, Central Asia, South Asia, North Africa, and the Horn of Africa.

Introduced in the 1780s by members of the Göttingen school of history, the term denoted one of three purported major races of humankind (those three being Caucasoid, Mongoloid, and Negroid). In biological anthropology, &quot;Caucasoid&quot; has been used as an umbrella term for phenotypically similar groups from these different regions, with a focus on skeletal anatomy, and especially cranial morphology, without regard to skin tone. Ancient and modern &quot;Caucasoid&quot; populations were thus not exclusively &quot;white&quot;, but ranged in complexion from white-skinned to dark brown.

Since the second half of the 20th century, physical anthropologists have switched from a typological understanding of human biological diversity towards a genomic and population-based perspective, and have tended to understand race as a social classification of humans based on phenotype and ancestry as well as cultural factors, as the concept is also understood in the social sciences.

In the United States, the root term &quot;Caucasian&quot; is still in use as a synonym for white or of European, Middle Eastern, or North African ancestry, a usage that has been criticized.

==History of the concept==
===The Caucasus as the origin of humanity and the peak of beauty===
In the eighteenth century, the prevalent view among European scholars was that the human species had its origin in the region of the Caucasus Mountains. This view was based upon the Caucasus being the location for the purported landing point of Noah&#x27;s Ark – from whom the Bible states that humanity is descended – and the location for the suffering of Prometheus, who in Hesiod&#x27;s myth had crafted humankind from clay.

In addition, the most beautiful humans were reputed by Europeans to be the stereotypical &quot;Circassian beauties&quot; and the Georgian people; both Georgia and Circassia are in the Caucasus region. The &quot;Circassian beauty&quot; stereotype had its roots in the Middle Ages, while the reputation for the attractiveness of the Georgian people was developed by early modern travellers to the region such as Jean Chardin.

===Göttingen school of history===
The term &quot;Caucasian&quot; as a racial category was introduced in the 1780s by members of the Göttingen school of history – notably Christoph Meiners in 1785 and Johann Friedrich Blumenbach in 1795—it had originally referred in a narrow sense to the native inhabitants of the Caucasus region.

In his &quot;The Outline of History of Mankind&quot; (1785), the German philosopher Christoph Meiners first used the concept of a &quot;Caucasian&quot; (&quot;Kaukasisch&quot;) race in its wider racial sense. Meiners&#x27; term was given wider circulation in the 1790s by many people. Meiners imagined that the Caucasian race encompassed all of the ancient and most of the modern native populations of Europe, the aboriginal inhabitants of West Asia (including the Phoenicians, Hebrews and Arabs), the autochthones of Northern Africa (Berbers, Egyptians, Abyssinians and neighboring groups), the Indians, and the ancient Guanches.
It was Johann Friedrich Blumenbach, a colleague of Meiners&#x27;, who later came to be considered one of the founders of the discipline of anthropology, who gave the term a wider audience, by grounding it in the new methods of craniometry and Linnean taxonomy. Blumenbach did not credit Meiners with his taxonomy, although his justification clearly points to Meiners&#x27; aesthetic viewpoint of Caucasus origins. In contrast to Meiners, however, Blumenbach was a monogenist—he considered all humans to have a shared origin and to be a single species. Blumenbach, like Meiners, did rank his Caucasian grouping higher than other groups in terms of mental faculties or potential for achievement despite pointing out that the transition from one race to another is so gradual that the distinctions between the races presented by him are &quot;very arbitrary&quot;.

Alongside the anthropologist Georges Cuvier, Blumenbach classified the Caucasian race by cranial measurements and bone morphology in addition to skin pigmentation. Following Meiners, Blumenbach described the Caucasian race as consisting of the native inhabitants of Europe, West Asia, the Indian peninsula, and North Africa. This usage later grew into the widely used color terminology for race, contrasting with the terms &quot;Negroid&quot;, &quot;Mongoloid&quot;, and &quot;Australoid&quot;.

===Carleton Coon===
There was never consensus among the proponents of the &quot;Caucasoid race&quot; concept regarding how it would be delineated from other groups such as the proposed Mongoloid race. Carleton S. Coon (1939) included the populations native to all of Central and Northern Asia, including the Ainu people, under the Caucasoid label. However, many scientists maintained the racial categorizations of color established by Meiners&#x27; and Blumenbach&#x27;s works, along with many other early steps of anthropology, well into the late 19th and mid-to-late 20th centuries, increasingly used to justify political policies, such as segregation and immigration restrictions, and other opinions based in prejudice. For example, Thomas Henry Huxley (1870) classified all populations of Asian nations as Mongoloid. Lothrop Stoddard (1920) in turn classified as &quot;brown&quot; most of the populations of the Middle East, North Africa, the Horn of Africa, Central Asia and South Asia. He counted as &quot;white&quot; only European peoples and their descendants, as well as a few populations in areas adjacent to or opposite southern Europe, in parts of Anatolia and parts of the Rif and Atlas mountains.

In 1939, Coon argued that the Caucasian race had originated through admixture between &quot;Homo neanderthalensis&quot; and &quot;Homo sapiens&quot; of the &quot;Mediterranean type&quot; which he considered to be distinct from Caucasians, rather than a subtype of it as others had done. While Blumenbach had erroneously thought that light skin color was ancestral to all humans and the dark skin of southern populations was due to sun, Coon thought that Caucasians had lost their original pigmentation as they moved North. Coon used the term &quot;Caucasoid&quot; and &quot;White race&quot; synonymously.

In 1962, Coon published &quot;The Origin of Races&quot;, wherein he proposed a polygenist view, that human races had evolved separately from local varieties of &quot;Homo erectus&quot;. Dividing humans into five main races, and argued that each evolved in parallel but at different rates, so that some races had reached higher levels of evolution than others. He argued that the Caucasoid race had evolved 200,000 years prior to the &quot;Congoid race&quot;, and hence represented a higher evolutionary stage.

Coon argued that Caucasoid traits emerged prior to the Cro-Magnons, and were present in the Skhul and Qafzeh hominids. However, these fossils and the Predmost specimen were held to be Neanderthaloid derivatives because they possessed short cervical vertebrae, lower and narrower pelves, and had some Neanderthal skull traits. Coon further asserted that the Caucasoid race was of dual origin, consisting of early dolichocephalic (e.g. Galley Hill, Combe-Capelle, Téviec) and Neolithic Mediterranean &quot;Homo sapiens&quot; (e.g. Muge, Long Barrow, Corded), as well as Neanderthal-influenced brachycephalic &quot;Homo sapiens&quot; dating to the Mesolithic and Neolithic (e.g. Afalou, Hvellinge, Fjelkinge).

Coon&#x27;s theories on race were much disputed in his lifetime, and are considered pseudoscientific in modern anthropology.

=== Criticism based on modern genetics ===

After discussing various criteria used in biology to define subspecies or races, Alan R. Templeton concludes in 2016: &quot;[T]he answer to the question whether races exist in humans is clear and unambiguous: no.&quot;

==Racial anthropology==
===Physical traits===
====Skull and teeth====
Drawing from Petrus Camper&#x27;s theory of facial angle, Blumenbach and Cuvier classified races, through their skull collections based on their cranial features and anthropometric measurements. Caucasoid traits were recognised as: thin nasal aperture (&quot;nose narrow&quot;), a small mouth, facial angle of 100–90°, and orthognathism, exemplified by what Blumenbach saw in most ancient Greek crania and statues. Later anthropologists of the 19th and early 20th century such as James Cowles Prichard, Charles Pickering, Broca, Paul Topinard, Samuel George Morton, Oscar Peschel, Charles Gabriel Seligman, Robert Bennett Bean, William Zebina Ripley, Alfred Cort Haddon and Roland Dixon came to recognize other Caucasoid morphological features, such as prominent supraorbital ridges and a sharp nasal sill. Many anthropologists in the 20th century used the term &quot;Caucasoid&quot; in their literature, such as William Clouser Boyd, Reginald Ruggles Gates, Carleton S. Coon, Sonia Mary Cole, Alice Mossie Brues and Grover Krantz replacing the earlier term &quot;Caucasian&quot; as it had fallen out of usage.

==Classification==

In the 19th century &quot;Meyers Konversations-Lexikon&quot; (1885–1890), Caucasoid was one of the three great races of humankind, alongside Mongoloid and Negroid. The taxon was taken to consist of a number of subtypes. The Caucasoid peoples were usually divided into three groups on ethnolinguistic grounds, termed Aryan (Indo-European), Semitic (Semitic languages), and Hamitic (Hamitic languages i.e. Berber-Cushitic-Egyptian).

19th century classifications of the peoples of India were initially uncertain if the Dravidians and the Sinhalese were Caucasoid or a separate &quot;Dravida&quot; race, but by and in the 20th century, anthropologists predominantly declared Dravidians to be Caucasoid.

Historically, the racial classification of the Turkic peoples was sometimes given as &quot;Turanid&quot;. Turanid racial type or &quot;minor race&quot;, subtype of the Europid (Caucasian) race with Mongoloid admixtures, situated at the boundary of the distribution of the Mongoloid and Europid &quot;great races&quot;.

There was no universal consensus of the validity of the &quot;Caucasoid&quot; grouping within those who attempted to categorize human variation. Thomas Henry Huxley in 1870 wrote that the &quot;absurd denomination of &#x27;Caucasian was in fact a conflation of his Xanthochroi (Nordic) and Melanochroi (Mediterranean) types.

===Subraces===
The postulated subraces vary depending on the author, including but not limited to Mediterranean, Atlantid, Nordic, East Baltic, Alpine, Dinaric, Turanid, Armenoid, Iranid, Indid, Arabid, and Hamitic. Some authors also proposed a &quot;Pamirid race&quot; (or &quot;Pamir-Fergana race&quot;) in Central Asia, named after the Pamir range and the Fergana valley.

H.G. Wells argued that across Europe, North Africa, the Horn of Africa, West Asia, Central Asia and South Asia, a Caucasian physical stock existed. He divided this racial element into two main groups: a shorter and darker &quot;Mediterranean&quot; or &quot;Iberian&quot; race and a taller and lighter &quot;Nordic&quot; race. Wells asserted that Semitic and Hamitic populations were mainly of Mediterranean type, and Aryan populations were originally of Nordic type. He regarded the Basques as descendants of early Mediterranean peoples, who inhabited western Europe before the arrival of Aryan Celts from the direction of central Europe.

The &quot;Northcaucasian race&quot; is a sub-race proposed by Carleton S. Coon (1930). It comprises the native populations of the North Caucasus, the Balkars, Karachays and Vainakh (Chechens and Ingushs).

An introduction to anthropology, published in 1953, gives a more complex classification scheme:
* &quot;Archaic Caucasoid Races&quot;: Ainu people in Japan, Australoid race, Dravidian peoples, and Vedda
* &quot;Primary Caucasoid Races&quot;: Alpine race, Armenoid race, Mediterranean race, and Nordic race
* &quot;Secondary or Derived Caucasoid Races&quot;: Dinaric race, East Baltic race, and Polynesian race

==Usage in the United States==

Besides its use in anthropology and related fields, the term &quot;Caucasian&quot; has often been used in the United States in a different, social context to describe a group commonly called &quot;white people&quot;. &quot;White&quot; also appears as a self-reporting entry in the U.S. Census. Naturalization as a United States citizen was restricted to &quot;free white persons&quot; by the Naturalization Act of 1790, and later extended to other resident populations by the Naturalization Act of 1870, Indian Citizenship Act of 1924 and Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952. The Supreme Court in &quot;United States v. Bhagat Singh Thind&quot; (1923) decided that Asian Indians were ineligible for citizenship because, though deemed &quot;Caucasian&quot; anthropologically, they were not &quot;white&quot; like European descendants since most laypeople did not consider them to be &quot;white&quot; people. This represented a change from the Supreme Court&#x27;s earlier opinion in &quot;Ozawa v. United States&quot;, in which it had expressly approved of two lower court cases holding &quot;high caste Hindus&quot; to be &quot;free white persons&quot; within the meaning of the naturalization act. Government lawyers later recognized that the Supreme Court had &quot;withdrawn&quot; this approval in &quot;Thind&quot;. In 1946, the U.S. Congress passed a new law establishing a small immigration quota for Indians, which also permitted them to become citizens. Major changes to immigration law, however, only later came in 1965, when many earlier racial restrictions on immigration were lifted. This resulted in confusion about whether American Hispanics are included as &quot;white&quot;, as the term &quot;Hispanic&quot; originally applied to Spanish heritage but has since expanded to include all people with origins in Spanish speaking countries. In other countries, the term &quot;Hispanic&quot; is rarely used.

The United States National Library of Medicine often used the term &quot;Caucasian&quot; as a race in the past. However, it later discontinued such usage in favor of the more narrow geographical term &quot;European&quot;, which traditionally only applied to a subset of Caucasoids.

<text>Georgios Ioannou Rallis (; 26 December 1918 – 15 March 2006), anglicised to George Rallis, was a Greek conservative politician and Prime Minister of Greece from 1980 to 1981.

== Ancestors in politics ==

Georgios was descended from the old, noble and political Rallis family. Alexandros Rallis, born in 1760, was a prominent Phanariote (Greek from Constantinople). In 1849 his son became Chief Justice of the Greek Supreme Court. Dimitrios Rallis, paternal grandfather of Georgios Rallis, served as Prime Minister of Greece for five separate short periods in 1897, 1903, 1905, 1909 and 1921. Dimitrios&#x27;s son and Georgios&#x27;s father, Ioannis Rallis, was a collaborationist Prime Minister from 1943 to 1944, during the German occupation. After the liberation of Greece he was sentenced to life imprisonment for collaboration and died in jail in 1946. His maternal grandfather, Georgios Theotokis, was four times Prime Minister of Greece, between 1901 and 1907.

== Early life ==
Georgios Rallis was born on 26 December 1918 in the prestigious Kolonaki district of Athens.

He studied law and political sciences at the University of Athens. Shortly after graduating he joined the fight against fascist Italy after the italian invasion on 28 October 1940 as a cavalry Second Lieutenant of the Reserve. He was recalled to active service during the Greek Civil War of 1946–49, during which he served in the armoured corps.

== Political career ==

Rallis was first elected to the Greek Parliament as a member of the People&#x27;s Party in the 1950 general election, and was re-elected in all subsequent elections until the end of his political career in 1993, except the 1958 election and the June 1989 election, where he did not run. He was first appointed a cabinet minister on 11 April 1954 in the government of Alexander Papagos, as Minister for the Presidency of the Government.

A close collaborator of Constantine Karamanlis, he retained the position under the first Karamanlis cabinet (6 October 1955 – 29 February 1956), and went on to serve as Minister for Transport and Public Works in the 1956–58 Karamanlis cabinet, and as Minister for the Interior in the 1961–1963 Karamanlis cabinet. He was also among the founding members of the National Radical Union (ERE) in 1956. In 1958, he quarrelled with Karamanlis over the latter&#x27;s adoption of a new electoral law, on which he had not been consulted, and for a few years left ERE, before returning to the fold in 1961.

Rallis was appointed to the post of Minister for Public Order in the caretaker cabinet of Panagiotis Kanellopoulos on 3 April 1967. It was in this position that the coup d&#x27;état of the Colonels found him on 21 April 1967. Rallis managed to evade capture by the putschists and go to the command centre of the Greek Gendarmerie, from where by radio he tried in vain to get in contact with the III Army Corps and order it to descend onto Athens and suppress the coup. Following the establishment of the Junta of the Colonels, he was arrested thrice, imprisoned and sent to internal exile to the island of Kasos. Among his anti-regime activities were his campaigning against the Junta-sponsored Republic referendum of 1973, and his criticism of the regime through his editorship of the magazine &quot;Politika Themata&quot;.

In 1974, following the fall of the dictatorship, Rallis became briefly Minister for the Interior and then again Minister to the Prime Minister in the national unity government under Karamanlis, and held on to the post (from 2 January 1975 as Minister for the Presidency of the Government) under the government formed by Karamanlis&#x27; new party, New Democracy, after the November 1974 election. On 5 January 1976 he also assumed the post of Minister for National Education and Religious Affairs, which he held in tandem with the former post until the end of the cabinet term on 28 November 1977. From the post of Minister for Education he oversaw the educational reform, the institution of the Demotic Greek as the formal language in schools and the administration, replacing the Katharevousa, and the reform of the school curricula.

Following the 1977 election, he served first as Minister for Coordination, before becoming Minister for Foreign Affairs in May 1978. He was the first Greek Foreign Minister to visit the Soviet Union, in October 1978, and negotiated Greece&#x27;s accession to the EEC, signing Greece&#x27;s accession agreement in May 1979. He also worked to restore relations with Bulgaria and Yugoslavia.

After Karamanlis was elected to the post of President of the Republic, on 8 May 1980 Rallis was elected by New Democracy&#x27;s parliamentary group as the new party chairman, and was sworn in as Prime Minister on 10 May. During his tenure Greece rejoined the military wing of NATO.

He led the government until his defeat by Andreas Papandreou&#x27;s PASOK in the 18 October 1981 election, resigning on 21 October. Shortly after, in early December, having lost the confidence of his party&#x27;s MPs, he resigned from the chairmanship of New Democracy.

In May 1987 he split from New Democracy and became an independent MP. He did not participate in the June 1989 election, but after a personal invitation by the new New Democracy chairman, Konstantinos Mitsotakis, he rejoined the party and was elected an MP for Corfu. After a renewed dispute with Mitsotakis, now Prime Minister, over the handling of the Macedonia naming dispute, he resigned from his post and retired from politics in March 1993. During his retirement, Rallis established and cultivated organically-farmed vineyards and olive groves at his family estate on Corfu.

Although Rallis became Prime Minister at a time when the fortunes of his party were in decline, he remained a popular figure because of his well-liked personal attributes of mildness, modesty and straightforwardness. A wealthy patrician by birth, he always made a point of living modestly, walking to work (even as a Prime Minister, much to the frustration of his security detail), and taking the time to greet and talk with those he met on the street. He died of heart failure at his home on 15 March 2006. He is survived by his wife, Lena Rallis (&quot;née&quot; Voultsou) and their two daughters, Zaira Papaligouras and Joanna Farmakidis.

Rallis spoke English, French, and German, and wrote 14 books.

A bust of Rallis in Corfu was stolen in April 2019.

<text>A majority government is a government by one or more governing parties that hold an absolute majority of seats in a legislature. Such a government can consist of one party that holds a majority on its own, or be a coalition government of multiple parties. This is as opposed to a minority government, where the government doesn&#x27;t have a majority, and needs to cooperate with opposition parties to get legislation passed. A government majority determines the balance of power. A government is not a majority government if it only has a majority when counting parties outside the government that have a confidence agreement with it.

A majority government is usually assured of having its legislation passed and rarely if ever, has to fear being defeated in parliament, a state also known as a working majority. In contrast, a minority government must constantly bargain for support from other parties in order to pass legislation and avoid being defeated on motions of no confidence. Single-party majority governments tend to be formed in the aftermath of strong election performances.

The term &quot;majority government&quot; may also be used for a stable long-term coalition of two or more parties to form an absolute majority. One example of such an electoral coalition is in Australia, where the Liberal and National parties have run as an electoral bloc, known simply as the Coalition, for decades. The Coalition is the only party or coalition in Australia to have won at least 90 of the 151 seats in the House of Representatives at a federal election (this has happened three times, in 1975, in 1996 and 2013). The largest majority government in Australia was elected in 1975, when the Coalition won 71.65% of the seats in a landslide victory.

In electoral systems where one party usually wins a majority of seats on their own, such as first past the post, coalitions are rare, but may happen when an election returns a hung parliament. An example of this was the 2010–2015 coalition government in the United Kingdom, which was composed of the Conservative Party and the Liberal Democrats. The Conservatives won the most seats of any single party in the 2010 election, but fell short of an absolute majority. However, by combining with the Liberal Democrats a solid majority in the House of Commons was created. This was the first true coalition government in the UK since World War II.

Majority government differs from consensus government or national unity government in not requiring a consensus or supermajority.

== Early life and education ==
David Hyde Pierce was born in Saratoga Springs, New York. His father, George Pierce, was an aspiring actor, and his mother, Laura Marie Pierce (née Hughes), was an insurance agent. He is the youngest of four children: he has two older sisters, Barbara and Nancy and one older brother, Thomas. He adopted the middle name Hyde in 1993 to avoid confusion with another actor named David Pierce. As a child, Pierce frequently played organ at the local Bethesda Episcopal Church. As a child, Pierce attended the all boys&#x27; sleepaway summer camp Kabeyun, where he first began acting in their camp productions of Gilbert &amp; Sullivan and directed their production of &quot;H.M.S. Pinafore&quot;.

After graduating from Saratoga Springs High School in 1977, Pierce attended Yale University. He originally majored in music with an emphasis in piano performance, but later changed to a double major in English literature and theater studies. While attending Yale, Pierce performed in and directed student productions, appearing in the Yale Gilbert &amp; Sullivan Society&#x27;s production of &quot;H.M.S. Pinafore&quot;. Pierce also directed the Gilbert &amp; Sullivan Society&#x27;s operetta &quot;Princess Ida&quot;. Pierce graduated from Yale in 1981 with a Bachelor of Arts degree.

== Career ==
=== 1980–1992: Rise to prominence ===
After his graduation, Pierce moved to New York City, where during the 1980s and early 1990s he was employed in various jobs, such as selling ties at Bloomingdale&#x27;s and working as a security guard, while pursuing an acting career and studying at Michael Howard Studios. During this period he played Laertes in an off-Broadway production of &quot;Hamlet,&quot; with Kevin Kline in the title role, and made his Broadway debut in 1982 in Christopher Durang&#x27;s &quot;Beyond Therapy&quot;.

Pierce&#x27;s first big television break came in the early 1990s with Norman Lear&#x27;s political comedy, &quot;The Powers That Be,&quot; in which Pierce played Theodore Van Horne, a Congressman. Despite positive reviews from critics, the show was canceled after a brief run. This did free Pierce up for his breakthrough role in &quot;Frasier&quot;, and the producers of that show did in part hire Pierce based on his performance in &quot;The Powers That Be&quot;.

===1993–2004: Breakthrough with &quot;Frasier&quot;===

In part owing to his close facial resemblance to Kelsey Grammer, the producers of the &quot;Cheers&quot; spin-off &quot;Frasier&quot; created the role of Niles Crane (Frasier Crane&#x27;s younger brother) for him. Although prior to &quot;Frasier&quot; going into production, Pierce had petitioned the Screen Actors Guild to change his billing to David Pierce–the name he had used on the stage–concerned that the use of his middle name in the show&#x27;s credits would typecast him, saddling him with the character&#x27;s &quot;snooty&quot; image. For his work on &quot;Frasier&quot;, Pierce was nominated for a Best Supporting Actor Emmy a record eleven consecutive years, winning in 1995, 1998, 1999 and 2004. Pierce received praise for his skilled physical comedy and rapid fire comedy reactions. David Bianculli of &quot;New York Daily News&quot; declared, &quot;Not since Jack Benny has TV seen such a great reactive comedian as Pierce, and whenever he and [Kelsey] Grammer share the same stage, &quot;Frasier&quot; is undiluted magic.

Pierce also appeared alongside Jodie Foster in &quot;Little Man Tate&quot;, with Anthony Hopkins in Oliver Stone&#x27;s &quot;Nixon&quot; (1995), and with Ewan McGregor in &quot;Down With Love&quot; (2003). He provided the voice for Doctor Doppler in Disney&#x27;s 42nd animated feature, &quot;Treasure Planet&quot;; Slim, a stick insect in Pixar&#x27;s &quot;A Bug&#x27;s Life&quot;; and Abe Sapien in Guillermo del Toro&#x27;s &quot;Hellboy&quot;. In his role in &quot;Sleepless in Seattle&quot; (1993), Pierce played Dennis Reed, the brother of Meg Ryan&#x27;s character Annie Reed, a professor at Johns Hopkins University. The film was released three months before the start of &quot;Frasier&quot;. In 2001, he starred in the cult 1981-set summer camp comedy &quot;Wet Hot American Summer&quot;, as the befuddled astrophysicist, Prof. Henry Newman.

Pierce has played a number of roles as a voice actor. These include the narrator of the film &quot;The Mating Habits of the Earthbound Human&quot; in 1999, the walking stick insect &quot;Slim&quot; in &quot;A Bug&#x27;s Life&quot;, Dr. Delbert Doppler in Disney&#x27;s film &quot;Treasure Planet&quot;, and amphibian Abe Sapien in &quot;Hellboy&quot;. Pierce declined to be credited for his &quot;Hellboy&quot; role because he felt it was the performance of Doug Jones, and not his own voice, which ultimately brought the character of Abe Sapien to life. He was the voice for Drix, a cold pill, in the animated comedy &quot;Osmosis Jones&quot;.

In a deliberate in-joke, he voiced Cecil Terwilliger, the brother of Kelsey Grammer-voiced Sideshow Bob, in &quot;The Simpsons&quot;&#x27; eighth season episode &quot;Brother from Another Series&quot;, in which the two characters parallel the Frasier–Niles relationship. At one point in the episode, Cecil mistakes Bart Simpson (voiced by Nancy Cartwright) for Maris Crane, the unseen wife of Niles on &quot;Frasier&quot;. He returned as Cecil in the Season 19 episode &quot;Funeral for a Fiend&quot; where &quot;Frasier&quot; co-star John Mahoney voices Dr. Robert Terwilliger Sr., the father of Cecil and Sideshow Bob.

Pierce provided the voice of Mr. Daedalus in the 1998 Disney show &quot;&quot;. Pierce narrated an audio tour guide, &quot;Napa Uncorked&quot;, in 2002. In 2006, he co-starred in the animated pilot for &quot;The Amazing Screw-On Head&quot; as the Screw-On Head (Paul Giamatti)&#x27;s nemesis Emperor Zombie; however, the series was not picked up. His commercial voiceover work included ads for the Tassimo coffee system, Seattle&#x27;s Metro Transit, and home furnishings retailer IKEA Canada.

=== 2005–2016: Return to Broadway ===
In 2005, Pierce joined Tim Curry and others in the stage production of &quot;Spamalot&quot;. In August and September 2006, he starred as Lieutenant Frank Cioffi in &quot;Curtains&quot;, a new Kander and Ebb musical staged at the Ahmanson Theatre in Los Angeles. In March 2007, &quot;Curtains&quot; opened on Broadway and on June 10, 2007, Pierce won the Tony Award for Best Actor in a Musical at the 61st Tony Awards for his performance. In his acceptance speech, Pierce said the first words he spoke on a Broadway stage were, &quot;I&#x27;m sorry, I&#x27;m going to have to ask you to leave.&quot;

On November 19, 2007, Pierce was awarded an honorary Doctor of Fine Arts degree from Niagara University in Lewiston, New York. In 1999, he was awarded an honorary degree from Skidmore College, located in his native Saratoga Springs. Pierce was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album for Children at the 52nd Annual Grammy Awards in 2010 for his narration of &quot;The Phantom Tollbooth&quot;.

In 2010, Pierce appeared in a revival of David Hirson&#x27;s play &quot;La Bête&quot; directed by Matthew Warchus. The production debuted on London&#x27;s West End before moving to New York. Also in 2010, Pierce had his first starring film role as Warwick Wilson in the dark comedy/psychological thriller &quot;The Perfect Host&quot;. From 2014 to 2015, Pierce appeared in &quot;The Good Wife&quot; as Frank Prady on CBS. He also starred as Assoc. Prof. Henry Neumann in &quot;Wet Hot American Summer: First Day of Camp&quot; (2015) on Netflix. Pierce directed the Broadway production of the musical &quot;It Shoulda Been You&quot;. In 2015 he directed the Manhattan Theater Club production of David Lindsay-Abaire&#x27;s play &quot;Ripcord&quot; Off-Broadway at City Center. Pierce appeared in the Off-Broadway limited engagement of &quot;A Life&quot; by Adam Bock. The play premiered at the Peter Jay Sharp Theater on October 24, 2016, directed by Anne Kauffman, and closed on November 27.

=== 2017–present ===
In 2017, he returned to television in the limited docudrama series about LGBT rights, &quot;When We Rise&quot; as Dr. Jones. He also appeared as himself with Julie Andrews in &quot;Julie&#x27;s Greenroom&quot; on Netflix. Pierce co-starred with Bette Midler in the Broadway revival of &quot;Hello, Dolly!&quot;. The musical opened on April 20, 2017, at the Shubert Theatre. The show was a critical and box office hit. Pierce himself received a Tony Award nomination for Best Actor in a Musical for his performance at the 71st Tony Awards. Pierce received Drama League Award nominations for &quot;Hello, Dolly!&quot; and &quot;A Life&quot;.

In 2020, Pierce replaced Tom Hollander as Paul Cushing Child in the biographical series &quot;Julia&quot; which premiered on HBO Max in March 2022. The cast includes Sarah Lancashire, Bebe Neuwirth, and Isabella Rossellini. In October 2021 he starred as Walter Vale in the musical &quot;The Visitor&quot; at The Public Theatre. The project is based on the 2007 film of the same name written by Tom McCarthy. In late 2022, it was revealed that Pierce had declined to return as Niles Crane in the 2023 revival of &quot;Frasier&quot;, saying he didn&#x27;t think there was much left for Niles to do.

Pierce starred in the final musical from Stephen Sondheim entitled &quot;Here We Are&quot; (2023) which was performed at The Shed in New York City. Pierce acted alongside Bobby Cannavale, Amber Gray, Rachel Bay Jones, Denis O&#x27;Hare, and Steven Pasquale. The production involves a book by David Ives and was directed by Joe Mantello. It is based on the Luis Buñuel films &quot;The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie&quot; (1972) and &quot;The Exterminating Angel&quot; (1962).

In 2024, it was announced that Pierce would star as Major General W.S. Gilbert in the Roundabout Theatre Company&#x27;s revival of Gilbert and Sullivan&#x27;s &quot;The Pirates of Penzance&quot; starting in April 2025. Pierce will star opposite Ramin Karimloo as the Pirate King. The revival will be reportedly a reimagining set in New Orleans, &quot;sizzling with Caribbean rhythms and French Quarter flair.&quot;

== Personal life ==

After years of media speculation about his sexuality, Pierce revealed in 2007 that he is gay and later confirmed through his publicist that he and television writer, director and producer Brian Hargrove were a couple. When accepting his Tony Award for &quot;Curtains&quot;, Pierce thanked &quot;my partner, Brian, because it&#x27;s 24 years of listening to your damn notes—that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m up here tonight.&quot; They married in California on October 24, 2008, just days before Proposition 8 was adopted as law banning same-sex marriages in the state. On May 28, 2009, while a guest on &quot;The View&quot;, he publicly announced his marriage to Hargrove and expressed his anger about the approval of Proposition 8.

Pierce has spent years working with the Alzheimer&#x27;s Association on behalf of Americans with Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. He has appeared in Washington, D.C., to testify in support of expanding funding for treatment, and he publicly campaigned for the National Alzheimer&#x27;s Project Act. Pierce told MSNBC in 2011, &quot;it is up to us, to all of us, to the American people and to their representatives about whether we face the challenges and make all the effort necessary or if we ignore it and just let this sort of tidal wave crash over us.&quot;

<doc id="465643" wikidata="Q260239" url="?curid=465643" title="United States House Committee on Ways and Means">
<text>The Committee on Ways and Means is the chief tax-writing committee of the United States House of Representatives. The committee has jurisdiction over all taxation, tariffs, and other revenue-raising measures, as well as a number of other programs including Social Security, unemployment benefits, Medicare, the enforcement of child support laws, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, foster care, and adoption programs. Members of the Ways and Means Committee are not allowed to serve on any other House Committee unless they are granted a waiver from their party&#x27;s congressional leadership. It has long been regarded as the most prestigious committee of the House of Representatives.

The United States Constitution requires that all bills regarding taxation must originate in the U.S. House of Representatives, and House rules dictate that all bills regarding taxation must pass through Ways and Means. This system imparts upon the committee and its members a significant degree of influence over other representatives, committees, and public policy. Its Senate counterpart is the U.S. Senate Committee on Finance.

In the 118th Congress, the committee&#x27;s chair is Jason T. Smith. Recent chairmen have included Bill Thomas, Charlie Rangel, Sander Levin, Dave Camp, Paul Ryan, Kevin Brady, and Richard Neal.

==History==
The Ways and Means Committee was first established during the first Congress, in 1789. However, this initial version was disbanded after only 8 weeks; for the next several years, only ad hoc committees were formed, to write up laws on notions already debated in the whole House. It was first established as a standing committee by resolution adopted December 21, 1795, and first appeared among the list of regular standing committees on January 7, 1802. Upon its original creation, it held power over both taxes and spending, until the spending power was given to the new Appropriations Committee in 1865.

During the Civil War the key policy-maker in Congress was Thaddeus Stevens, as chairman of the committee and Republican floor leader. He took charge of major legislation that funded the war effort and permanently transformed the nation&#x27;s economic policies regarding tariffs, bonds, income and excise taxes, national banks, suppression of money issued by state banks, greenback currency, and western railroad land grants. Stevens was one of the major policymakers regarding Reconstruction, and obtained a House vote of impeachment against President Andrew Johnson (who was acquitted by the Senate in 1868). Hans L. Trefousse, his leading biographer, concludes that Stevens &quot;was one of the most influential representatives ever to serve in Congress. [He dominated] the House with his wit, knowledge of parliamentary law, and sheer willpower, even though he was often unable to prevail.&quot; Historiographical views of Stevens have dramatically shifted over the years, from the early 20th-century view of Stevens and the Radical Republicans as tools of enormous business and motivated by hatred of the white South, to the perspective of the neoabolitionists of the 1950s and afterwards, who applauded their efforts to give equal rights to the freed slaves.

Three future presidents – James Polk, Millard Fillmore, and William McKinley – served as Committee Chairman. Before the official roles of floor leader came about in the late 19th century, the Chairman of Ways and Means was considered the Majority Leader. The chairman is one of very few Representatives to have office space within the Capitol building itself.

==Political significance==

Because of its wide jurisdiction, Ways and Means has always been one of the most important committees with respect to impact on policy. Although it lacks the prospects for reelection help that comes with the Appropriations Committee, it is seen as a valuable post for two reasons: given the wide array of interests that are affected by the committee, a seat makes it easy to collect campaign contributions and since its range is broad, members with a wide array of policy concerns often seek positions to be able to influence policy decisions. Some recent major issues that have gone through the Ways and Means Committee include welfare reform, a Medicare prescription drug benefit, Social Security reform, George W. Bush&#x27;s tax cuts, and trade agreements including the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and the Central America Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA).

From 1911 to 1974, the Ways and Means Committee also had the responsibility to appoint members of other committees in addition to its legislative duties. When Ways and Means chair Wilbur Mills&#x27; career ended in scandal, Congressman Phillip Burton transferred the committee&#x27;s selection powers to a separate, newly created committee.

==Members, 119th Congress==

Resolutions electing members: (chair), (Ranking Member), (R), (D)

==Subcommittees==
There are six subcommittees in the 118th Congress. In 2011, the Subcommittee on Income Security and Family Support was renamed the Subcommittee on Human Resources, returning to the name it held prior to the 110th United States Congress. In 2015, the Select Revenue Measures was renamed the Subcommittee on Tax Policy. In 2019 these two subcommittees were again renamed under Democratic control; Human Resources became Worker and Family Support and Tax Policy was renamed to Select Revenue Measures. In 2023 and under a return to Republican control, they were again renamed to Work and Welfare and Tax respectively.

<text>The Revenge&quot; class, sometimes referred to as the Royal Sovereign&quot; class or the R class, consisted of five Dreadnought battleships built for the Royal Navy in the 1910s. All of the ships were completed to see service during the First World War. There were originally to have been eight of the class, but two were later redesigned, becoming the s, and another, which was to have been named HMS &quot;Resistance&quot;, was cancelled outright. The design was based on that of the preceding , but with reductions in size and speed to make them more economical to build.

Two of the ships, and , were completed in time to see action at the Battle of Jutland during the First World War, where they engaged German battlecruisers. The other three ships were completed after the battle, by which time the British and German fleets had adopted more cautious strategies, and as a result, the class saw no further substantial action. During the early 1920s, the ships were involved in the Greco-Turkish War and the Russian Civil War as part of the Mediterranean Fleet. They typically operated as a unit during the interwar period, including stints in the Atlantic Fleet. All five members of the class were modernised in the 1930s, particularly to strengthen their anti-aircraft defences and fire-control equipment.

The ships saw extensive action during the Second World War, though they were no longer front-line units by this time and thus were frequently relegated to secondary duties such as convoy escort and naval gunfire support. &quot;Royal Oak&quot; was sunk at her moorings in Scapa Flow in October 1939 by a German U-boat, and two other ships of the class were torpedoed during the war; , hit by a Vichy French submarine off Dakar in 1940 and , attacked by a Japanese submarine in Madagascar in 1942; both survived. ended the war in service with the Soviet Navy as &quot;Arkhangelsk&quot;, but she was returned in 1949, by which time her three surviving sister ships had been broken up for scrap. She, too, was dismantled that year.

==Design and description==

In the early 1900s, Germany challenged Britain in a naval arms race under the direction of Admiral Alfred von Tirpitz that was exacerbated by the dreadnought revolution. The Royal Navy embarked on a construction programme to out-build the Germans to maintain its dominance of the seas. Beginning with the launch of , the British had built or laid down twenty-seven all-big-gun battleships to the Germans&#x27; seventeen built or building by 1913; to cement their lead, the British ordered another group of battleships for the 1913 Estimates.

The &quot;Revenge&quot;-class ships (sometimes referred to as the &quot;&quot;Royal Sovereign&quot; class&quot; or the &quot;R class&quot;) were designed as slightly smaller, slower, and more heavily protected versions of the preceding s. The design staff, led by Eustace Tennyson d&#x27;Eyncourt, the Director of Naval Construction, had been charged by the Board of Admiralty with developing a version of the earlier armed with the same battery of guns used in the &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot;s, albeit with the same number as the &quot;Iron Duke&quot;s—ten rather than the eight of the &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; design. As an economy measure they were intended to revert to the previous practice of using both fuel oil and coal, but First Sea Lord Jackie Fisher rescinded the decision for coal in October 1914. Still under construction, the ships were redesigned to employ oil-fired boilers that increased the power of the engines by over the original specification.

The initial design completed by d&#x27;Eyncourt&#x27;s team mounted only eight 15 in guns, despite the request from the Board, since he could not fit the fifth twin-gun turret in the specified displacement limit. The Board suggested triple turrets to solve the weight problem, but d&#x27;Eyncourt pointed out that no suitable design existed, which would significantly delay construction. He was also opposed to the idea since a single hit on a turret would disable more guns. As a result, the Board approved d&#x27;Eyncourt&#x27;s proposal on 31 March 1913.

===General characteristics and propulsion===
The ships of the &quot;Revenge&quot; class were long between perpendiculars, long at the waterline, and had a length overall of . They had a beam of (which was increased to approximately with the addition of anti-torpedo bulges) and a deep draught of fully loaded without a bulge and with a bulge. They had a normal displacement without a bulge of approximately and at deep load. Equivalent figures for those ships fitted with a bulge were about or , depending on the type of bulge fitted. The ships&#x27; metacentric height was at deep load without a bulge fitted and with a bulge.

Their crew numbered between 909 and 940 officers and ratings in 1917; by the early 1920s, the number of crew had grown to 1,012 to 1,240. Each battleship carried a number of smaller boats, including a variety of steam and sail pinnaces, steam launches, cutters, whalers, dinghies, and rafts. These were handled by five boat derricks. The ships were fitted with eight searchlights, four on the bridge, two at the base of the funnel and two on the after superstructure.

They were powered by two sets of Parsons steam turbines, each driving two shafts with 3-bladed screws, using steam provided by eighteen Babcock &amp; Wilcox boilers at a working pressure of in all but &quot;Resolution&quot; and &quot;Royal Oak&quot;, which received boilers manufactured by Yarrow. The boilers were ducted into a single funnel. The turbines were divided into three watertight compartments arranged side by side; the low-pressure turbines driving the inner pair of shafts were in the centre engine room together, while the high-pressure outboard turbines were in the rooms on either side.

The turbines were rated at and intended to give the ships a maximum speed of , although &quot;Revenge&quot; only reached a top speed of from during her sea trials on 24 March 1916. The other members of the class had similar performance, with only &quot;Royal Oak&quot; making on trials. The bulged &quot;Ramillies&quot; reached from during her sea trials on 20 September 1917, less than half a knot slower than the unbulged ships. Fuel storage amounted to of fuel oil and of coal as designed, but on conversion to only oil-fired boilers, the storage capacity was 3,400 long tons of oil. This enabled the ships to steam for at a cruising speed of , which fell to at full speed.

===Armament and fire control===

The &quot;Revenge&quot; class was equipped with eight breech-loading (BL) Mk I guns in four twin-gun turrets, in two superfiring pairs fore and aft of the superstructure, designated &#x27;A&#x27;, &#x27;B&#x27;, &#x27;X&#x27;, and &#x27;Y&#x27; from front to rear. The guns were initially supplied with eighty shells per gun, but the magazines were later modified to allow for up to one hundred shells per gun. The ships carried the guns in Mk I turrets that allowed for elevation to 20 degrees and depression to -5 degrees. The guns could be loaded at any angle, but the crews typically returned to +5 degrees, since the guns could be cleared faster that way. They fired projectiles at a muzzle velocity of to a range of . Their designed rate of fire was one shot every 36 seconds.

The ships&#x27; secondary battery consisted of fourteen BL Mk XII guns, twelve of which were mounted in casemates along the broadside of the vessel amidships; the remaining pair were mounted on the shelter deck and were protected by gun shields. The casemate guns were moved further aft from the bow to reduce the tendency of the gun ports to ship water in heavy seas, a problem encountered with both the &quot;Iron Duke&quot; and &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; classes. The guns had a muzzle velocity of from their projectiles. At their maximum elevation of 15 degrees, they had a range of .

The ships also mounted four 3-pounder () guns. Their anti-aircraft (AA) armament consisted of two quick-firing (QF) 20 cwt Mk I guns. They were fitted with four submerged torpedo tubes, two on each broadside. Each ship was supplied with a total of twenty-one torpedoes of the Mk II, Mk IV, and MK IVHB types.

The &quot;Revenge&quot;-class ships were completed with two fire-control directors fitted with rangefinders. One was mounted above the conning tower, protected by an armoured hood, and the other was aloft on the tripod mast. Each turret was also fitted with a 15-foot rangefinder. The main armament could be controlled by &#x27;X&#x27; turret as well. The secondary armament was primarily controlled by directors mounted on each side of the compass platform on the foremast once they began to be fitted in March 1917. A torpedo-control director with a rangefinder was mounted at the aft end of the superstructure. The rangefinders in &#x27;B&#x27; and &#x27;X&#x27; turrets were replaced by models between 1919 and 1922.

Flying-off platforms were fitted on all the ships on the roofs of &#x27;B&#x27; and &#x27;X&#x27; turrets in 1918. Between them the ships carried two fighters and eight reconnaissance aircraft. These platforms were removed as the ships were refitted in the early 1930s. &quot;Resolution&quot; was briefly fitted with an aircraft catapult on the quarterdeck in early 1930 and &quot;Royal Sovereign&quot; had one in 1933–1936. All of the ships except &quot;Revenge&quot; and &quot;Royal Sovereign&quot; were equipped with a catapult atop &#x27;X&#x27; turret in the mid-1930s. &quot;Resolution&quot; kept hers until late 1942 or early 1943.

===Protection===
The ships&#x27; waterline belt consisted of Krupp cemented armour (KC) that was thick between &#x27;A&#x27; and &#x27;Y&#x27; barbettes and thinned to 4 to 6 inches (102 to 152 mm) towards the ships&#x27; ends, but did not reach either the bow or the stern. Above this was a strake of armour 6 inches thick that extended between &#x27;A&#x27; and &#x27;X&#x27; barbettes. Transverse bulkheads 4 to 6 inches thick ran at an angle from the ends of the thickest part of the waterline belt to &#x27;A&#x27; and &#x27;Y&#x27; barbettes. The gun turrets were protected by of KC armour, except for the turret roofs which were thick. The barbettes ranged in thickness from above the upper deck, but were only 4 to 6 inches thick below it. The &quot;Revenge&quot;-class ships had multiple armoured decks that ranged from in thickness. The main conning tower had 11 inches of armour on the sides with a 3-inch roof. The torpedo director in the rear superstructure had 6 inches of armour protecting it. After the Battle of Jutland, 1 inch of high-tensile steel was added to the main deck over the magazines and additional anti-flash equipment was added in the magazines.

====Anti-torpedo Bulges====
&quot;Ramillies&quot; was the least advanced in construction when the Director of Naval Construction decided to fit bulges to the ship to improve her survivability against naval mines and torpedoes in March 1915, making her the first capital ship in the world to be bulged. Testing had revealed that a bulge filled with hollow tubes substantially reduced the effectiveness of a torpedo warhead. The bulge scabbed onto &quot;Ramillies&quot;″s hull was long and high; it was divided into two watertight compartments with the upper and lower inner compartments filled with steel &quot;crush&quot; tubes with their ends plugged by wooden bungs. They were intended to absorb the force of an underwater detonation and prevent splinters and debris from penetrating the inner torpedo bulkhead. The watertight outer compartment was also divided longitudinally, but it was empty to allow the force of the detonation to disperse. The form of the bulge increased the ship&#x27;s beam to , decreased her draught by about and increased her displacement by .
&quot;Resolution&quot; and &quot;Revenge&quot; were fitted with a different form of bulge in 1917–1918 that was intended to improve their stability as well as protect them against underwater threats. This discarded the crushing tubes to save weight and was only a single watertight compartment deep. It was divided into upper and lower compartments, of which the upper was filled with a mixture of concrete and scrap wood while the lower was empty. The bulge increased their beam to about , reduced their draught by and increased their displacement by .

Yet another form of bulge was installed aboard &quot;Royal Sovereign&quot; during her 1920–1924 refit. Based on the preceding form, the upper compartment was enlarged so that it extended above the waterline and crush tubes replaced the concrete and wood mixture. This weighed . Reports had been received from the bulged ships of excessive rolling and the Admiralty Experiment Works conducted experiments to determine the best form of a bulge to eliminate the problem in conjunction with improved bilge keels. &quot;Royal Oak&quot; was the only ship of the class lacking a bulge by this time. When fitted during her 1922–1924 refit, her bulges were mostly empty, although their lower compartments were partially filled with water. They also extended much further up the side of the ship. This form of the bulge increased her metacentric height to . &quot;Ramillies&quot;″s bulges were modified during her 1926–1927 to a form much like those of &quot;Royal Oak&quot;; all of her crush tubes were removed, except those abreast of the magazines. &quot;Resolution&quot; had the concrete and wood mixture removed from her bulge and the lower compartment partially filled with water during her 1929–1931 refit; the same was done for &quot;Revenge&quot; during her 1931 refit.

== Ships in class ==
== Service history ==
===First World War===
Three members of the class entered service by May 1916: &quot;Revenge&quot;, &quot;Royal Sovereign&quot;, and &quot;Royal Oak&quot;. &quot;Revenge&quot; was assigned to the 6th Division of the 1st Battle Squadron (BS), Grand Fleet, while &quot;Royal Oak&quot; initially served with the 3rd Division, 4th Battle Squadron. &quot;Royal Sovereign&quot; was left in port when the fleet sortied to meet the German High Seas Fleet off the coast of Jutland in late May, as her crew had not fully worked up by that time. During the ensuing Battle of Jutland, both &quot;Revenge&quot; and &quot;Royal Oak&quot; engaged German battlecruisers, &quot;Revenge&quot; damaging two of them— and —while &quot;Royal Oak&quot; scored a hit on a third—. &quot;Revenge&quot; was forced to turn away to avoid torpedoes that damaged her squadron flagship and caused her squadron to lose contact with the rest of the fleet. &quot;Royal Oak&quot; remained with the main fleet for the duration of the action. Both ships emerged from the battle unscathed.

All three ships were present for the action of 19 August 1916, but the British and German fleets both withdrew before engaging each other directly, the British having lost a pair of light cruisers to German U-boats and the Germans having had one battleship damaged by a British submarine. By the end of the year, &quot;Resolution&quot; had joined the fleet, which was by that time reduced to patrolling the northern North Sea as both sides turned to positional warfare since the threat of underwater weapons was too great to risk another major fleet action like Jutland. &quot;Ramillies&quot; did not enter service until late 1917, as she had been badly damaged during her launching ceremony, which slowed her completion significantly. But during the lengthy period of repairs and fitting-out, the navy decided to experiment with the installation of anti-torpedo bulges to improve her ability to resist underwater damage. The bulges proved to be a success, not only increasing her defensive characteristics but also improving stability, while not having a significant negative impact on her speed; as a result, they were later added to the other members of the class during refits after the war.

After German forces began raiding British convoys to Norway in late 1917, the Grand Fleet began sending a battle squadron to cover them, prompting the Germans to attempt to ambush and destroy the isolated squadron in April 1918. German radio silence prevented the British from learning of the operation in advance, as they had at Jutland, though faulty German intelligence did not provide the correct date of the convoy. By the time the British realized the Germans were at sea, the High Seas Fleet had withdrawn far enough south so that the Grand Fleet could not catch them. On 21 November, following the Armistice, the entire Grand Fleet left port to escort the surrendered German fleet into internment at Scapa Flow.

===Interwar period===
Through the 1920s and 1930s, the &quot;Revenge&quot;-class battleships operated as a unit, alternating between the Atlantic Fleet and the Mediterranean Fleet, typically trading places with the five &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot;-class ships. While serving in the Mediterranean Fleet in the early 1920s, the ships were involved in the Greco-Turkish War and the Russian Civil War. Four of the ships (all but &quot;Resolution&quot;) landed Royal Marines to take part in the occupation of Constantinople in March 1920. Throughout June and July, the ships participated in the fighting in the collapsing Ottoman Empire; &quot;Ramillies&quot; and &quot;Revenge&quot; shelled Turkish troops around Ismid in June and both ships, joined by &quot;Royal Sovereign&quot;, assisted with Greek landings elsewhere in Turkey. Also in July, &quot;Royal Sovereign&quot; assisted in the escape of White émigrés fleeing from the Soviet Red Army. During this period, &quot;Resolution&quot; primarily operated in the Black Sea, including a period at Batumi in southern Russia.

As the &quot;Revenge&quot;s were refitted during the 1920s, their forecastle-deck six-inch guns were removed and they exchanged their pair of three-inch AA guns for QF four-inch (102 mm) Mk V guns, another pair of Mk V guns was added later. Each ship received an anti-aircraft control position with a rangefinder on its foremast, except for &quot;Revenge&quot; which was fitted with an anti-aircraft director HACS Mk I system instead. In addition the torpedo-control arrangements were improved and equipped with 12-foot rangefinders.

After a stint in the Atlantic Fleet in 1921, the ships briefly returned to the Mediterranean in September 1922 during a crisis in Smyrna that culminated in the Great fire of Smyrna as the Greco-Turkish War came to its conclusion. The ships returned to the Atlantic Fleet in November. In 1924, &quot;Resolution&quot; accidentally rammed and sank the submarine during training exercises, killing all aboard. &quot;Royal Oak&quot; was involved in the so-called &quot;Royal Oak Mutiny&quot;, between her commander, Captain Kenneth Dewar and Commander Henry Daniel, also an officer aboard the ship and Rear-Admiral Bernard Collard, the commander of the 1st Battle Squadron. The situation was ultimately resolved by Admiral Sir Roger Keyes removing all three from their posts.

The ships remained in the Atlantic until 1927, when they once again transferred to the Mediterranean. The &quot;Revenge&quot;s and &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot;s again traded places in 1935, and the five &quot;Revenge&quot;-class ships were present for the Coronation Review for George VI on 20 May 1937. Throughout this period, the ships underwent repeated refits as anti-aircraft suites were upgraded so that each ship had a pair of HACS Mk III systems in lieu of their anti-aircraft control positions, except for &quot;Ramillies&quot; which received Mk I directors, and QF four-inch Mk XVI AA guns in twin mounts replaced the single Mk V guns. They also received light AA guns for the first time in the form of two octuple two-pounder () Mk VIII &quot;pom-pom&quot; mounts, each with their own directors, and a pair of quadruple Vickers AA machinegun mounts. The submerged torpedo tubes were removed as was all of the torpedo-control equipment. &quot;Royal Oak&quot; was the exception as she had her submerged tubes replaced by above-water tubes. She was also the only ship to receive additional armour when 4-inch plates were added to the deck over her magazines and over her engine rooms. This armour increased her displacement by . The &quot;Royal Sovereign&quot;s did not, however, receive the same extensive reconstructions that some of the &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot;-class ships underwent, as the modernization program was interrupted by the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939. The war also forced the cancellation of a plan to add the same armour to &quot;Royal Sovereign&quot; and &quot;Ramillies&quot;.

===Second World War===
With the start of war in August 1939, &quot;Revenge&quot; and &quot;Resolution&quot; were assigned to the Channel Force, based in Portland, while &quot;Royal Sovereign&quot; served with the Home Fleet. &quot;Ramillies&quot; was by this time at Alexandria, Egypt, where she remained until early October, when she was sent to search for the German heavy cruiser in the Indian Ocean. At the same time, &quot;Resolution&quot; and &quot;Revenge&quot; were sent to the South Atlantic Command to participate in the hunt for &quot;Admiral Graf Spee&quot;, but before they arrived they were sent to the North Atlantic Escort Force to cover convoys from Canada to Britain. They carried gold bullion to Canada to safeguard it during the war during this period. &quot;Royal Oak&quot; remained in Scapa Flow during this period, and on 14 October, the U-boat broke through the harbour defences and torpedoed &quot;Royal Oak&quot;, sinking her at her mooring and killing 833. &quot;Ramillies&quot; covered troop convoys from Australia to Egypt, including those that carried the 2nd New Zealand Expeditionary Force and the Second Australian Imperial Force in late 1939 and early 1940.

&quot;Resolution&quot; took part in the Norwegian Campaign, seeing action at the Battles of Narvik in April 1940. The following month she was struck by a German bomb, but was not seriously damaged. Also in May, &quot;Ramillies&quot; was assigned to the Mediterranean Fleet in anticipation of Italy&#x27;s entry into the war. The following month, &quot;Resolution&quot; had joined Force H, and on 3 July she participated in the destruction of the French Fleet at Mers-el-Kebir. Following the Italian declaration of war, &quot;Ramillies&quot; bombarded Italian positions in Italian Libya in mid-August. In September, &quot;Resolution&quot; steamed south to Dakar with Force H to neutralise French warships there, but during the Battle of Dakar, she was torpedoed and badly damaged by a French submarine. In October, &quot;Revenge&quot; bombarded the port of Cherbourg in occupied France to destroy German supplies being assembled for the planned invasion of Britain, Operation Sealion. &quot;Ramillies&quot; was present with the convoy that was attacked by Italian warships during the Battle of Cape Spartivento in late November but she was not involved in the battle.

Wartime changes to the battleships were generally limited to augmenting their deck armour, their anti-aircraft suites and the addition of radars. Each ship received a pair of quadruple two-pounder mounts and anywhere from 10 (&quot;Revenge&quot; and &quot;Resolution&quot;) to 42 (&quot;Royal Sovereign&quot;) Oerlikon guns. Radars were added beginning in 1941, including early-warning, search and fire-control systems. Armour plates thick were added over the magazines on &quot;Resolution&quot;, &quot;Royal Sovereign&quot; and, partially, in &quot;Ramillies&quot; in 1941–1942. To increase the accommodation available for the greatly-enlarged wartime crew, the four forward six-inch guns were removed from each ship in 1943, except for &quot;Resolution&quot;, which only lost two guns.

In late 1940, &quot;Revenge&quot; and &quot;Royal Sovereign&quot; returned to convoy escort duties in the North Atlantic, and &quot;Ramillies&quot; joined them in January 1941 after completing a refit. During this period, &quot;Ramillies&quot; discouraged the two German s from attacking a convoy she escorted. &quot;Revenge&quot; and &quot;Ramillies&quot; were at sea during Operation Rheinübung, the sortie of the German battleship in May and they joined the hunt for the ship, but did not locate her. &quot;Resolution&quot; spent much of 1941 under repair, first in Freetown, West Africa and then the United States. Late in the year, the Admiralty decided to deploy the four &quot;Revenge&quot;-class ships to the Far East as the 3rd Battle Squadron in anticipation of war with Japan. They arrived in early 1942, by which time the Japanese had already declared war and inflicted a string of defeats on the Allied countries in the region. The ships fled in advance of the Japanese Indian Ocean raid, as they were no match for the aircraft carriers of the powerful 1st Air Fleet. The battleships thereafter primarily operated off the coast of Africa, escorting troop convoys. &quot;Ramillies&quot; was present during the Battle of Madagascar in May, where she was torpedoed by a Japanese submarine. She was repaired first in Durban, South Africa, and then Devonport.

In late 1943, &quot;Revenge&quot; and &quot;Resolution&quot; were recalled to Britain, owing to their poor condition; the former carried Prime Minister Winston Churchill part of the way to the Tehran Conference in November and December while the latter underwent a refit. Both ships were then decommissioned and assigned to the Portsmouth Command; &quot;Resolution&quot; joined the training establishment , while &quot;Revenge&quot; remained out of service. In January 1944, &quot;Royal Sovereign&quot; and &quot;Ramillies&quot; were also recalled; &quot;Ramillies&quot; was refitted and assigned to the fire support force for the invasion of Normandy; &quot;Revenge&quot; and &quot;Resolution&quot; were disarmed to provide spare barrels for this work. &quot;Royal Sovereign&quot; was transferred to the Soviet Navy as &quot;Arkhangelsk&quot; to reinforce the fleet covering convoys to the Soviet Union in the Arctic Ocean. &quot;Revenge&quot; and &quot;Resolution&quot; were sold for scrap in 1948 and were dismantled at Inverkeithing and Faslane, respectively. &quot;Ramillies&quot; went to the breakers&#x27; yard at Cairnryan, also in 1948. &quot;Royal Sovereign&quot; was returned to Britain in 1949 in poor condition as a result of being poorly maintained in Soviet service; her turrets were jammed and much of her equipment was unusable. The last surviving member of the class, she was sold for scrap that year and broken up at Inverkeithing.

<doc id="465654" wikidata="Q2596824" url="?curid=465654" title="Court of St James's">
<text>The Court of St James&#x27;s serves as the official royal court for the Sovereign of the United Kingdom. The court formally receives all ambassadors accredited to the United Kingdom. Likewise, ambassadors representing the United Kingdom are formally accredited from this court.

The Marshal of the Diplomatic Corps, known as Master of the Ceremonies before 1920, serves as the liaison between the British monarch and foreign diplomatic missions. The Marshal is stationed permanently at St James&#x27;s Palace. As of 1886, there were merely six ambassadors in London, while 37 other countries were represented by ministers. (The custom, developed in the 18th century, was that only monarchies sent ambassadors, while others sent ministers; this distinction was abrogated toward the end of the 19th century.) By 2015, the number of foreign missions accredited to the Court of St James&#x27;s had risen to 175, including 47 high commissions from Commonwealth countries and 128 embassies from non-Commonwealth countries.

Official meetings and receptions related to the court, such as Privy Council meetings or the annual Diplomatic Reception attended by 1,500 guests, typically take place wherever the monarch is in residence—usually at Buckingham Palace.

==Origin of the name==
The Court of St James&#x27;s derives its name from St James&#x27;s Palace, hence the possessive &quot;″s&quot; at the end of the name. This nomenclature is due to St James&#x27;s Palace being the most senior royal palace, despite Buckingham Palace being the primary metropolitan residence of all British sovereigns since the accession of Queen Victoria in 1837. The court&#x27;s name is sometimes wrongly pronounced as the &quot;Court of St James&quot;, excluding the appropriate &quot;iz&quot; pronunciation of the possessive &quot;s&quot; suffix.

<doc id="465657" wikidata="Q5283160" url="?curid=465657" title="Distributed library">
<text>A distributed library is a collection of materials available for borrowing by members of a group, yet not maintained or owned by a single entity. The library catalog is maintained on a database that is made accessible to users through the Internet. This style of library is still in its infancy. Administrative software continues to be developed and distributed.

An early example of this style of library (if not the first of its type) is the Distributed Library Project of the San Francisco Bay Area. While distributed libraries are being established in several cities worldwide, the San Francisco Bay Area library still only has a few hundred members.

Another example, which takes a slightly different approach, is the Unlibrary. In this system, users are free to create communities of any size and scope, rather than a single citywide community. For instance a church might have its own community, with church members all able to borrow from each other. Users can also have private, invite-only groups.

Another example is the digibruted library of Geneva. The name digibruted is coined from “Digital” and “Distributed”. This library is a digital construction that indexes books for local distribution. The difference from Unlibrary is that the books are freely given to readers, who act also as librarians, in a kind of peer-to-peer schema.

==Early Concepts==
A precursor is the Tabard Inn Library established in 1902 where travelers could check out books at one station and return them at another, with each station operated by a different individual. To patrons, the library appeared as a distributed library. The Book Lovers Library based in Philadelphia, PA rented the books to each exchange station.

<text>Enzo Maiorca (21 June 1931 – 13 November 2016) was an Italian free diver who held several world freediving records. Born Vincenzo Maiorca on 21 June 1931 in Syracuse, Sicily, he died on 13 November 2016 in the same city.

==Biography==
Maiorca was born in Syracuse, Sicily, where he also died in 2016. Maiorca was a vegetarian.

In 1977, Maiorca was initiated into Scottish Rite Freemasonry at the &quot;Archimede di Siracusa&quot; Lodge in Italy. With the agreement of the Grand Orient of Italy lodge, this element of his biography was publicly revealed in 2017.

==Freediving==
Maiorca learned to swim at age 4 and soon began to dive, although expressing a great fear of the sea. In 1956 a friend showed him an article about a new depth record of 41 meters set by spearfishing champions Ennio Falco and Alberto Novelli. Maiorca was led by the article to begin competing in order to achieve the title of the &quot;man who reaches the deepest.&quot; He achieved this in 1960, when he reached 45 metres to beat Brazilian Amerigo Santarelli. That same year, however, Santarelli reclaimed the title by reaching 46 metres, which Maiorca soon surpassed at 49 metres.

In 1967 Maiorca ceased spearfishing, while still competing in freediving. He explained in an interview why he abandoned spearfishing: 
: &quot;It all happened suddenly. I was diving in the shallows not far from the cape that reaches out to the open sea south of the bay of Syracuse. That morning I happened to spear a grouper. A strong and combative grouper. On the bottom a real titanic struggle broke out, between me who wanted to take its life and the grouper who tried to save itself. The grouper was caught in a cavity between two rocks; trying to understand its position, I ran my right hand down the fish&#x27;s belly. Its heart was pounding in terror, mad with fear. And with that pulsing of blood I realized that I was killing a living being. Since then my speargun lies like a derelict, an archaeological item, in the dusty basement of my house. That was in 1967.&quot;

On 22 September 1974, in the Bay of Ieranto (or &#x27;Jeranto&#x27;) at the western end of the Gulf of Salerno, Maiorca attempted to establish a new world record for freediving, aiming for 90 metres. The event was televised live, for the first time in the history of RAI (the Italian national broadcaster). Less than 20 metres into his dive, Maiorca bumped into Enzo Bottesini, an expert scuba instructor, and upon resurfacing he let out a string of strong expletives, many of which were clearly audible to the television audience. His outburst led to a television ban for many years, and led to his retirement from competition for more than a decade.

In 1988, Maiorca returned to free diving and set his final record of 101 metres.

Maiorca&#x27;s main rivals were the Brazilian Amerigo Santarelli (who retired from the sport in 1963), Teteke Williams, Robert Croft, and Jacques Mayol.

== Post-diving ==
From 1994 to 1996, Maiorca was elected to the Senate for the right-wing Alleanza Nazionale party. Maiorca also appeared on Lineablu, a RAI broadcast news series, from 2000 to 2002. The character Enzo Molinari, portrayed by Jean Reno, in the 1988 Luc Besson film &quot;The Big Blue&quot; is based on Maiorca.

==Prizes ==

===Variable buoyancy===
===Constant weight===
==Awards==
*Gold Medal of the President of the Republic (1964) for athletic prowess 
*Ustica Golden Trident
*CONI&#x27;s Literary Award for his book &quot;Headlong into the Blue&quot; (1976)
*Sport merits Gold Star from CONI
*Gold Medal of Merit Marina (not only for sports but also for the defence of the environment, 2006)
*His 80th birthday was celebrated in La Spezia with the conferring of the Award of the Maritime Festival.

==Bibliography==
Maiorca was the author of several books:
*&quot;Headlong into the Blue: The Life and Business of a World Record&quot;. Milan, ed. Murcia, 1977. 
*&quot;School Apnea&quot;. Rome, ed. Cuba, 1982. 
*&quot;The Sea with a Capital S&quot;. Lights, 2001. 
*&quot;Under the Sign of Tanit&quot;. Milan, Murcia, 2011 

==Film and music==
*Maiorca co-starred as himself in the film &quot;Challenge on the Bottom&quot; (1975), directed by Melchiade Coletti. 
*The rivalry between Maiorca and Jacques Mayol inspired the 1988 film &quot;The Big Blue&quot; by Luc Besson. The movie was not shown in Italy until 2002 due to Maiorca&#x27;s objections. Recognizing his own caricature in the character of Enzo Molinari, Maiorca considered the portrayal detrimental to his image. After the death of Jacques Mayol in 2001 and Maiorca&#x27;s retirement from competitions, he relented, and the film was shown.
*Maiorca is quoted by the protagonist of the film &quot;I Am Self Sufficient&quot; (1976) by Nanni Moretti.
*Maiorca is mentioned in the song &quot;The Ballad of Cimino&quot; by Davide Van de Sfroos.
*Maiorca is cited by the plaintiff Guido Nickel in the film &quot;Monte Carlo Grand Casino&quot;.

<doc id="465664" wikidata="Q6693244" url="?curid=465664" title="Lowell Murray">
<text>Lowell Murray, (born 26 September 1936) is a former Canadian senator and long-time activist with the federal Progressive Conservative Party.

==Education==
Murray graduated from St. Francis Xavier University in 1955. He met 16-year-old Brian Mulroney there; the two became close friends and associates in the PC Party. He later earned an MPA from Queen&#x27;s University.

In 1961, he became an assistant to federal justice minister Davie Fulton. Later, he served as chief of staff to Progressive Conservative leader Robert Stanfield and then was New Brunswick premier Richard Hatfield&#x27;s senior advisor.

==Appointment to the Senate==
Murray was appointed to the Senate on the recommendation of Prime Minister Joe Clark in 1979. In 1986, Prime Minister Mulroney appointed Murray to the Cabinet as Leader of the Government in the Senate, and variously as Minister of State for Federal-Provincial Relations (until 21 April 1991), Minister responsible for the Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency (June 1987 to September 1988), and Acting Minister of Communications (December 1988 to 30 January 1989). Murray served as Government Leader in the Senate until the defeat of the government of Prime Minister Kim Campbell in 1993.

In 2003, Murray joined with Clark to oppose the merger of the Progressive Conservative Party with the Canadian Alliance to form the Conservative Party of Canada. When the new party was created, he refused to join the new Conservative caucus, and, until his retirement remained one of two senators (the other being Elaine McCoy) to sit as &quot;Progressive Conservatives&quot; even though the federal Progressive Conservative Party had been formally dissolved.

Murray was the last senator appointed on the advice of Prime Minister Clark to sit in the Senate. He was the longest-serving member of the body upon his mandatory retirement from the Senate on 26 September 2011, when he attained the age of 75.

<doc id="465668" wikidata="Q5253971" url="?curid=465668" title="William Hung">
<text>William Hing Cheung Hung (; born November 10, 1982) is a Hong Kong-born American motivational speaker and former singer who gained fame in 2004 as a result of his unsuccessful audition singing Ricky Martin&#x27;s hit song &quot;She Bangs&quot; on the third season of the television series &quot;American Idol&quot;.

At the time of his audition, Hung was a civil engineering student at UC Berkeley. After his spirited audition to be the next &quot;American Idol&quot;, he won the support of many fans, ironically, based on his perceived lack of musical talent. Hung voluntarily left university to pursue a music career. His recording career was marked by negative critical reaction.

He brought his own career as a musician to an end when in 2011 he accepted a job opportunity as a technical crime analyst for the Los Angeles County Sheriff&#x27;s Department, and decided to pursue law enforcement. Since then, Hung has reflected positively on his pop music career.

== Personal life ==
Hung is a 73rd-generation descendant of Confucius.

After growing up in the Sha Tin district of British Hong Kong, Hung moved with his family to the Van Nuys area in Los Angeles, California, at age 11. He was a civil engineering student at University of California, Berkeley, when he competed on the US television contest series &quot;American Idol&quot;. He exited college to pursue his music career and later graduated from California State University, Northridge with a degree in mathematics. Hung later completed an MBA from Marist College.

Hung was married to Jian Teng on June 18, 2014. Prior to this marriage, he had already gone through a divorce. This second marriage also ended in divorce. In 2022, Hung admitted that his gambling addiction had contributed towards his divorce and that he was taking steps to eradicate it from his life.

== Career ==
=== Initial fame ===
While studying civil engineering at the University of California, Berkeley, Hung auditioned for the third season of &quot;American Idol&quot; in San Francisco in September 2003, becoming the final auditioner on the show of January 15, 2004.

&quot;I want to make music my living,&quot; said Hung, before he started singing and dancing to Ricky Martin&#x27;s &quot;She Bangs&quot;. As judges Randy Jackson and Paula Abdul tried to restrain their laughter, judge Simon Cowell dismissed Hung&#x27;s performance, remarking &quot;You can&#x27;t sing, you can&#x27;t dance, so what do you want me to say?&quot;, to which Hung replied, &quot;Um, I already gave my best, and I have no regrets at all.&quot; Jackson and Abdul applauded his positive attitude, with Abdul remarking, &quot;That&#x27;s the best attitude yet.&quot; Hung&#x27;s response to Cowell&#x27;s criticism starkly contrasts with the often confrontational rejoinders of other contestants. Hung added, &quot;...you know, I have no professional training of singing and dancing,&quot; eliciting mock surprise from Cowell, who replied, &quot;No? Well, this &quot;is&quot; the surprise of the century.&quot; Hung was not admitted through to the next round.

=== Cult following ===
Hung rapidly gained a cult following. A William Hung fan site, set up by realtor Don Chin and his wife Laura, recorded over four million hits within its first week. Remixes of Hung&#x27;s audition performance topped song request lists at a number of radio stations.

Hung subsequently appeared on several television programs including &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot;, &quot;On Air with Ryan Seacrest&quot;, &quot;Entertainment Tonight&quot;, &quot;George Lopez&quot;, the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;, &quot;Countdown with Keith Olbermann&quot;, &quot;The Howard Stern Radio Show&quot;, &quot;The Ellen DeGeneres Show&quot;, &quot;Dateline NBC&quot;, &quot;Arrested Development&quot; and CBS&#x27;s &quot;The Early Show&quot;. Hung was featured in several national magazines and newspapers; he was parodied on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, &quot;Mad TV&quot;, &quot;Celebrity Deathmatch&quot;, and &quot;The Fairly OddParents&quot;. He was reportedly invited to perform at MTV&#x27;s Asia Awards held in mid-February.
An online petition to bring Hung back to &quot;American Idol&quot; included more than 100,000 signatures by late February. Hung was brought back to &quot;American Idol&quot; as part of a mid-season special titled &quot;Uncut, Uncensored and Untalented&quot;, airing March 1, 2004. The special documented what it was like to experience the audition process and, in Hung&#x27;s case, emerge as an inadvertent celebrity.

At the 2006 Artichoke Festival in Castroville, California, Hung was crowned the Artichoke King; Marilyn Monroe had previously received a similar honor.

=== Record deal ===
William Hung was offered a $25,000 advance on a record deal from Koch Entertainment in 2004, and released three albums on that label in 2004 and 2005. His first album was &quot;Inspiration&quot;. Produced by Giuseppe D, it was recorded over a March 2004 weekend with Hung singing vocals over karaoke music. To promote it, Hung performed before nearly 20,000 fans during half-time at a Golden State Warriors basketball game on April 6 and performed &quot;She Bangs&quot;, included on the album, on such shows as &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot;. The album received highly negative reviews, but ultimately went on to sell about 200,000 copies and reached Number One on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Top Independent Album Chart. His two follow-up albums were far less successful, as &quot;Hung for the Holidays&quot; (a Christmas album) only sold 35,000 copies, despite a national promotion campaign including appearances on &quot;The Howard Stern Show&quot;, and &quot;Miracle: Happy Summer from William Hung&quot; (another karaoke cover album) only sold 7,000. In a February 2006 interview, he said he was working on a fourth album of 5 or 6 tracks, but none was released, and he retired in 2011.

=== Television, commercials and movies ===
Hung appeared in commercials for the search engine Ask.com, the Game Show Network (spoofing Freddie Mercury and singing an off-key &quot;We Are the Champions&quot;), as well as the mobile phone service provider Cingular Wireless. He also appeared to sing &quot;Take Me Out to the Ballgame&quot; in May 2004 at the Rogers Centre for the Toronto Blue Jays.

His first movie, a low-budget Hong Kong period comedy called &quot;Where is Mama&#x27;s Boy&quot; (2004), was released in January 2005. Hung played a good-natured village kid who sells Chinese pancakes to pay his mother&#x27;s medical bills. His character gets discovered as a singer, and helps a woman protect her business from her jealous, conniving elder sister. In the film, Hung played opposite veteran Hong Kong actress Nancy Sit and parodied his own &quot;American Idol&quot; performance with the song &quot;Siu Beng&quot; (Cantonese) (&quot;Chinese Pancake&quot;), an allusion to his &quot;American Idol&quot; audition song, &quot;She Bangs&quot;. Despite solid financial backing and the involvement of Nancy Sit, the film was a box office flop.

Lampooning his own career, Hung later made appearances in &quot;Airline&quot;, &quot;Arrested Development&quot;, and &quot;George Lopez&quot;.
=== Retirement from music ===
After a semester-long attempt at teaching high-school math, in 2011, Hung became a technical crime analyst for the Los Angeles County Sheriff&#x27;s Department, and retired from music. Hung remains optimistic about his new career path, and states he does not regret that his music career has ended. &quot;I showed that even the Average Joe could succeed,&quot; he remarked on his short-lived time as a pop star.

Hung later joined the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health around 2014. In 2017, Hung became a motivational speaker; he has been booked as a keynote speaker for groups such as the Asian Realtors Association of America.

On April 7, 2016, he made a surprise performance of &quot;She Bangs&quot; on the American Idol season 15 finale.

On May 2, 2022, Hung made another surprise appearance on American Idol season 20.

== Analysis of popularity ==
Commentator Emil Guillermo claimed that Hung may not have gained as much attention had he been of another race, and his popularity may be derived from his being a representation of the Asian stereotype, characterized by nerdiness, bucked teeth, studiousness, speaking with a strong &quot;fresh off the boat&quot; accent, and lacking singing talent or rhythm. Documentary filmmaker James Hou commented, &quot;As Asian Americans, we look through this racial lens, and we see this guy who embodies all the stereotypes we&#x27;re trying to escape from.&quot;

Some analysts have argued that Hung&#x27;s career arose out of mockery, and that the media exploited him as a joke rather than as a talented or inspirational figure. Ron Lin, former editor in chief of the UC Berkeley&#x27;s &quot;Daily Californian&quot; asserts: &quot; really difficult for Asian American males to break through and (Hung) may not be the most appealing example.&quot;

Amber Eliza Watts suggested that Hung&#x27;s cult following derived from him being the antithesis of everything &quot;Idol&quot; represented, with his lack of musical talent and odd looks, and how unlike other audition failures he was not arrogantly expecting to be made a pop star, he just wanted to sing. In a 2008 &quot;American Idol&quot; extra, in response to the question, &quot;Why do you think it is that people gravitate towards William Hung so much?&quot;, Hung stated, &quot;I believe it&#x27;s my attitude and charisma, I tell people constantly, media, everywhere I go, just never give up on your dream.&quot;

<doc id="465672" wikidata="Q92768" url="?curid=465672" title="Rasmus Lerdorf">
<text>Rasmus Lerdorf (born 22 November 1968) is a Danish-Canadian programmer. He co-authored and inspired the PHP scripting language, authoring the first two versions of the language and participating in the development of later versions led by a group of developers including Jim Winstead (who later created blo.gs), Stig Bakken, Shane Caraveo, Andi Gutmans, and Zeev Suraski. He continues to contribute to the project.

==Early life and education==
Lerdorf was born on Disko Island in Greenland and moved to Denmark in his early years. Lerdorf&#x27;s family moved to Canada from Denmark in 1980, and later moved to King City, Ontario in 1983. He graduated from King City Secondary School in 1988, and in 1993 he graduated from the University of Waterloo with a Bachelor of Applied Science in Systems Design Engineering. He contributed to the Apache HTTP Server and he added the LIMIT clause to the mSQL DBMS. A variant of this LIMIT clause had already been around for a decade in mainframe relational database management systems (like Oracle Rdb running on VMS, formerly from Digital Equipment Corporation), but apparently it had not yet been picked up by the emerging PC-based databases. It was later adapted by several other SQL-compatible DBMS. He released the first version of PHP in 1995.

==Career==
From September 2002 to November 2009 Lerdorf was employed by Yahoo! Inc. as an Infrastructure Architecture Engineer. In 2010, he joined WePay in order to develop their application programming interface. Throughout 2011 he was a roving consultant for startups. On 22 February 2012 he announced on Twitter that he had joined Etsy. In July 2013 Lerdorf joined Jelastic as a senior advisor to help them with the creation of new technology.

Lerdorf is a frequent speaker at Open Source conferences around the world. During his keynote presentation at OSCMS 2007, he presented a security vulnerability in each of the projects represented at the conference that year.

Lerdorf also appeared at the WeAreDevelopers Conferences 2017 and 2019, making a speech on the history of PHP, the new PHP 7 release in 2017, and the 25 years of PHP.

==Award==
In 2003, Lerdorf was named in the &quot;MIT Technology Review&quot; TR100 as one of the top 100 innovators in the world under the age of 35.

<doc id="465673" wikidata="Q3493638" url="?curid=465673" title="Anthem Records">
<text>Anthem Records is an independent record label based in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The company was formed in May 1977 by Ray Danniels and Vic Wilson with initial recording artists Rush, Max Webster, Liverpool and A Foot in Coldwater. The three members of Rush, Geddy Lee, Neil Peart and Alex Lifeson became associate directors of Anthem.

==Background==
The label&#x27;s predecessor was Moon Records. Anthem was formed so that Rush would have more control of their work at home in Canada (their international deal with Mercury Records initially included Canada), and so other Canadian bands would have a home, as they could not get signed by the major labels&#x27; offices in Toronto or Montreal.
Anthem&#x27;s sister company is SRO Management, also run by Danniels and Wilson, overseeing flagship act Rush and other bands, on and off Anthem.

Lawrence Gowan had also recorded for the label before joining Styx in 1999.

In November 2015, Anthem was acquired by Ole Media Management. In June 2019, Ole rebranded as Anthem.

<text>The Housatonic River ( ) is a river, approximately long, in western Massachusetts and western Connecticut in the United States. It flows south to southeast, and drains about of southwestern Connecticut into Long Island Sound.

==History==

===Indigenous history===
Indigenous people began using the river area for fishing and hunting at least 6,000 years ago. By 1600, the inhabitants were mostly Mohicans and may have numbered 30,000.

The river&#x27;s name is derived from the Mohican phrase &quot;usi-a-di-en-uk&quot;, translated as &quot;beyond the mountain place&quot; or &quot;river of the mountain place&quot;. It is referred to in the deed by which a group of twelve colonists called &quot;The Proprietors&quot; captured the land now called Sherman and New Fairfield as &quot;Ousetonack&quot;. Samuel Orcutt, a 19th-century historian, explained the term&#x27;s pronunciation as &quot;more properly...Howsatunnuck&quot; and also noted an early spelling in the form of &quot;Oweantinock&quot;. Prior to the 18th century, the river was alternatively known as the Pootatuck River. Accounts differ on the origin of this name, with some claiming that Pootatuck is an Algonquian term translating to &quot;river of the falls&quot; while others relate the term was eponymous, reflecting the name of the tribe that had their principal village along the river in the area of Newtown, Connecticut. &quot;Pootatuck River&quot; eventually came to refer a lesser tributary in the Housatonic watershed which empties into the Housatonic River at Sandy Hook, Connecticut.

The river passes through land that was formerly occupied primarily by native people of Algonquian lineage, typically living in villages of two to three hundred families housed in hide wigwams. These native inhabitants burned the forests along the Housatonic Valley in the autumn to keep the underbrush down, a practice which was customary throughout Connecticut prior to European settlement.

One notable native was Chief Squantz of the Schaghticoke tribe, who still hold a portion of the former reservation on the west side of the Housatonic River, in what is now called the town of Kent.

English settlement of the northern Housatonic Valley began in 1725 in Sheffield, Massachusetts. By 1734, Mohicans established the Indian Town of Stockbridge, which grew over 15 years but then failed, with land pressures increasing.

===Industrialization===

The river has been a source of power for paper, iron, textiles, and electricity industries. At Great Barrington, a grist mill built by David Ingersoll in 1739 used the river for power. The paper industry grew using the river&#x27;s power from circa 1800.

The river was dammed with the advent of industry. In 1900, there were 30 dams on the river in Pittsfield. Many have been removed, but many remain, such as the Woods Pond dam in Lenox, Columbia Mill dam in Lee, Willow Mill dam in South Lee, Glendale dam in Stockbridge, and Rising Pond dam in Great Barrington, Massachusetts.

Five dams impound the river in Connecticut to produce hydroelectricity: the Falls Village, Bulls Bridge, Shepaug, Stevenson and Derby dams. The last three dams form a chain of lakes: Lake Lillinonah, Lake Zoar and Lake Housatonic, from New Milford south to Shelton.

===Covered wooden bridges===

Three wooden covered bridges cross the Housatonic River. Two are in Connecticut: one known as Bull&#x27;s Bridge, which spans the river between Gaylordsville and Kent, and another at Cornwall, known as the West Cornwall Covered Bridge. Reinforced with present-day materials, both bridges carry normal vehicle traffic, albeit in only one direction at a time. The third bridge, Old Covered Bridge located in Sheffield, Massachusetts, was destroyed by fire and rebuilt in 1998; it is now open only to foot traffic.

===Cultural references===

Lydia Sigourney&#x27;s poem is in her volume, Scenes in my Native Land, 1845, where it accompanied by descriptive text on the river and its neighbourhood.

The United States Navy named a ship for the Housatonic River. The has the distinction of being the first ship in history to be sunk by a submarine, the Confederate vessel CSS &quot;H.L. Hunley&quot;, in 1864.

Inspired by the river during his honeymoon, the American classical music composer Charles Ives wrote &quot;The Housatonic at Stockbridge&quot; as part of his composition &quot;Three Places in New England&quot; during the 1910s, drawing his text from a poem of the same name by Robert Underwood Johnson. The town of Stockbridge is located in southwestern Massachusetts. The river enters Stockbridge on the east side of town before turning south toward Connecticut.

There was a 1962 American nuclear weapon test of the same name; several such tests used Native American words as codewords.

==== UFO sighting and monument ====
In 1969, nine-year-old Thom Reed and his family claimed to see a bright light rise from the Housatonic River, then found themselves inside &quot;what appeared to be an airplane hangar,&quot; where they saw creatures that &quot;resembled large insects.&quot; Supporters of the family erected a memorial to the incident at the Old Covered Bridge in Sheffield, Massachusetts, in 2015. The 5,000-pound memorial was removed by the town in 2019. The incident featured in a 2020 episode of &quot;Unsolved Mysteries&quot; on Netflix.

==Ecology and wildlife==
Historically, the Housatonic River and its Naugatuck River tributary hosted the southernmost spawning runs of the Atlantic salmon (&quot;Salmo salar&quot;). The Salmon Creek tributary of the Housatonic River may have been named for this salmonid, which can reach up to .

===Pollution===
====PCBs====

From &quot;circa&quot; 1932 until 1977, the river received PCB pollution discharges from the General Electric (GE) plant at Pittsfield, Massachusetts. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency  (EPA) designated the Pittsfield plant and several miles of the Housatonic as a Superfund site in 1997, and ordered GE to remediate the site. EPA and GE began a cleanup of the area in 1999. Most of the PCBs used in the United States during this period were made by Monsanto. Aroclor 1254 and Aroclor 1260, made by Monsanto, was a primary contaminant of the pollution in the Housatonic River. Although the water quality has improved in recent decades, and some remediation has taken place, the river continues to be contaminated by PCBs.

Between 2005 and 2018 GE completed remediation and restoration of the 10 manufacturing plant areas within the city, and continues to conduct inspection, monitoring and maintenance activities. Additional remediation is planned for the downstream polluted areas of the river. The highest concentrations of PCBs in the Housatonic River are found in Woods Pond in Lenox, Massachusetts, just south of Pittsfield, where they have been measured up to 110 mg/kg in the sediment. About 50% of all the PCBs currently in the river are estimated to be retained in the sediment behind Woods Pond dam. This is estimated to be about 11,000 pounds of PCBs. Former filled oxbows are also polluted.

Birds, such as ducks, and fish that live in and around the river contain significant levels of PCBs and can present health risks if consumed.

;&quot;Rest of River&quot; settlement agreement
Negotiations regarding how to clean up the contaminated areas south of Pittsfield had continued for many years since the initial Superfund site designations, involving GE, EPA, local governments, citizen groups and other stakeholders. In February 2020 EPA announced a settlement agreement involving GE, EPA and most of the concerned parties, to remove contaminated sediment from the river. Highly contaminated soil would be removed and shipped to federally approved facilities outside the state, while less-contaminated soil would be placed in a new specially designed landfill in Berkshire County.

Following a public comment period, EPA issued a permit in December 2020 for the final cleanup phase. In 2021 two of the citizen groups that were parties to the settlement filed an appeal of the permit, criticizing the design of the planned landfill. In February 2022 the US Environmental Appeals Board (EAB) denied the permit appeal. Following the EAB ruling, EPA has continued to design the new PCB disposal facility and has conducted public meetings in 2022. Two citizen groups appealed the EAB decision to the First Circuit Court of Appeals, and in July 2023 the court rejected the plaintiffs&#x27; challenge.

====Mercury====
The Connecticut segment of the river is polluted with mercury levels far beyond background levels, starting at the confluence with the Still River. The hat manufacturing industry of Danbury, Connecticut, which operated from the 19th to the mid-20th century, was the source of most of this mercury pollution, from mercury nitrate used in the felting process. In the 21st century, the mercury remains in the river sediment and flows downstream, especially during storm events. High mercury levels are measured in the sediment at the outflow delta of the Housatonic River into Long Island Sound.

==Watershed and course==

The Housatonic River watershed drains in western Connecticut and Massachusetts and eastern New York. The Housatonic rises from four sources in far western Massachusetts in the Berkshire Mountains near the city of Pittsfield. It flows southward through western Massachusetts through the Berkshires and into western Connecticut, and empties into the Long Island Sound between the cities of Stratford and Milford, forming a border between Connecticut&#x27;s Fairfield County and New Haven County, respectively. It includes 83 towns.

For most of its extent the watershed is just to the west of the watershed of the lower Connecticut River, and to the east of the
Hudson River Basin. Near the coast, smaller watersheds border it: on the east the Quinnipiac River and Wepawaug River watersheds, and on the west the Norwalk River, Saugatuck River, and Pequonnock River watersheds.

The river&#x27;s total fall is ( from the confluence of its east and west branches) to Long Island Sound. Its major tributaries in Massachusetts are (heading downstream) the Williams River (in Great Barrington), Green River and Konkapot River (in Ashley Falls). Crossing south into Connecticut, the Housatonic&#x27;s major tributaries are the Blackberry River (in Canaan), Salmon Creek (below Falls Village), Ten Mile River (above Gaylordsville but originating in New York), Still River (south of New Milford), Shepaug River (at the Bridgewater and Southbury border), Pomperaug River (at Southbury), and Naugatuck River (in Derby). The Naugatuck River is the Housatonic&#x27;s largest tributary with a contributing watershed of .

Candlewood Lake is a pumped storage facility which is replenished when water is pumped into it from the Housatonic during times of non-peak electrical consumption; the water is then allowed to flow back into the river during peak times to generate electricity.

== Housatonic Valley region ==

The Greater Danbury metropolitan area in Western Connecticut is also known as the Housatonic Valley Region.

The Upper Housatonic Valley National Heritage Area is a designated National Heritage Area consisting of an area in the watershed of the upper Housatonic River, extending from Kent, Connecticut, to Lanesborough, Massachusetts, including eight towns in Connecticut and eighteen in Massachusetts.

==Recreation==

The Housatonic River is a popular whitewater paddling destination beginning at Falls Village, Connecticut, and continuing to Gaylordsville. Most of the river is quickwater and Class I whitewater with long sections of Class II-III whitewater. A deadly and extreme Class VI resides at Great Falls in Canaan (Falls Village) and is most likely not able to be paddled. The most dangerous and difficult section that is navigable is by Bulls Bridge, with Class V whitewater.

There are several minor and major dams along the river that form lakes. Most notable are two lakes in Connecticut, Lake Zoar, which borders Monroe, Newtown, Oxford, and Southbury, and Lake Lillinonah. Both lakes are major water-sport recreation outlets for the surrounding towns.

Two of the three lakes formed by the dams are used for rowing by clubs, schools, and to host regattas. Lake Lillinonah is used by the GMS Rowing Center and is host to the GMS Regatta. Lake Housatonic is used by the Yale University Crew Team at the Gilder Boathouse and by the New Haven Rowing Club. It is also host to the Derby Sweeps &amp; Sculls and the Head of the Housatonic.

The Housatonic River is also a popular fly fishing destination. Fly fishing on the Housatonic River has been compared with western rivers and is among the finest for trout in the eastern United States. The most popular area for fly fishing is in Litchfield County, Connecticut, between the dam at Falls Village and Cornwall Bridge.

The Appalachian Trail follows the river along this section from the Bulls Bridge covered wooden bridge near Kent to Falls Village.

== Major crossings ==

As U.S. Route 7 runs along the Housatonic River Valley between Pittsfield and New Milford, it crosses the Housatonic several times.

<text>Earl of Balfour is a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. It was created in 1922 for Conservative politician Arthur Balfour, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 1902 to 1905 and Foreign Secretary from 1916 to 1919.
The earldom was created with special remainder, failing male issue of his own, to:
# his younger brother, the Right Honourable Gerald William Balfour, and the heirs male of his body, failing which to
# his nephew Francis Cecil Campbell Balfour and the heirs male of his body, and failing which to
# his nephew Oswald Herbert Campbell Balfour and the heirs male of his body.

The latter two were the sons of his deceased youngest brother Colonel Eustace James Anthony Balfour. Balfour was made Viscount Traprain, of Whittingehame in the County of Haddington, at the same time as he was given the earldom. This title is also in the Peerage of the United Kingdom and was created with similar remainder.

Balfour never married, and was succeeded according to the special remainders by his younger brother Gerald, the second Earl. He was also a Conservative politician and notably served as Chief Secretary for Ireland, as President of the Board of Trade and as President of the Local Government Board. This line of the family failed on the death of his grandson, the fourth Earl, in 2003. the titles are held by his second cousin once removed, the fifth Earl. He is the grandson of the aforementioned Francis Cecil Campbell Balfour, nephew of the first Earl.

The family seat is Burpham Lodge, near Arundel, Sussex.

<doc id="465689" wikidata="Q20463" url="?curid=465689" title="Garbage truck">
<text>A garbage truck is a truck specially designed to collect municipal solid waste and transport it to a solid waste treatment facility, such as a landfill, recycling center or transfer station. In Australia they are commonly called rubbish trucks, or garbage trucks, while in the U.K. dustbin lorry, rubbish lorry or bin lorry is commonly used. Other common names for this type of truck include trash truck in the United States, and refuse truck, dustcart, junk truck, bin wagon or bin van elsewhere. Technical names include waste collection vehicle and refuse collection vehicle (RCV). These trucks are a common sight in most urban areas.

==History==

Wagons and other means had been used for centuries to haul away solid waste. Among the first self-propelled garbage trucks were those ordered by Chiswick District Council from the Thornycroft Steam Wagon and Carriage Company in 1897 described as a steam motor tip-car, a new design of body specific for &quot;the collection of dust and house refuse&quot;.

The 1920s saw the first open-topped trucks being used, but due to foul odors and waste falling from the back, covered vehicles soon became more common. These covered trucks were first introduced in more densely populated Europe and then in North America, but were soon used worldwide.

The main difficulty was that the waste collectors needed to lift the waste to shoulder height. The first technique developed in the late 1920s to solve this problem was to build round compartments with corkscrews that would lift the load and bring it away from the rear. A more efficient model was the development of the hopper in 1929. It used a cable system that could pull waste into the truck.

In 1937, George Dempster invented the &quot;Dempster-Dumpster&quot; system in which wheeled waste containers were mechanically tipped into the truck. His containers were known as Dumpsters, which led to the word dumpster entering the language.

In 1938, the Garwood Load Packer revolutionized the industry when including a compactor in the truck was implemented. The first compactor could double a truck&#x27;s capacity. This was made possible by use of a hydraulic press which periodically compacted the contents of the truck.

In 1955 the Dempster Dumpmaster, the first front loader, was introduced. They did not become common until the 1970s. The 1970s also saw the introduction of smaller dumpsters, often known as wheelie bins, which were also emptied mechanically. Since that time there has been little dramatic change, although there have been various improvements to the compaction mechanisms to improve payload. In the mid-1970s Petersen Industries introduced the first grapple truck for municipal waste collection.

In 1969, the city of Scottsdale, Arizona introduced the world&#x27;s first automated side loader. The new truck could collect 300 gallon containers in 30 second cycles, without the driver exiting the cab.

In 1997, Lee Rathbun introduced the &quot;Lightning Rear Steer System&quot;. This system includes an elevated, rear-facing cab for both driving the truck and operating the loader. This configuration allows the operator to follow behind haul trucks and load continuously.

==Types==
===Front loaders===
Front loaders generally service commercial and industrial businesses using large waste containers with lids known as Dumpsters in the US. The truck is equipped with powered forks on the front which the driver carefully aligns with sleeves on the waste container using a joystick or a set of levers. The waste container is then lifted over the truck. Once it gets to the top the container is then flipped upside down and the waste or recyclable material is emptied into the vehicle&#x27;s hopper. Once the waste is dumped, it is compacted by a hydraulically powered moving wall that oscillates backwards and forwards to push the waste to the rear of the vehicle.

Most of the newer packing trucks have &quot;pack-on-the-go hydraulics&quot; which lets the driver pack loads while driving, allowing faster route times. When the body is full, the compaction wall moves all the way to the rear of the body, ejecting it via an open tailgate. There is also a system called the Curotto Can which is an attachment for a front loader that has an automated arm that functions as an automated side loader that allows the driver to dump carts.

===Rear loaders===
Rear loaders have an opening into a trough or hopper at the rear that a waste collector can throw waste bags or empty the contents of bins into. Often in many areas they have a lifting mechanism to automatically empty large carts without the operator having to lift the waste by hand.

Another popular system for the rear loader is a rear load container specially built to fit a groove in the truck. The truck will have a chain or cable system for upending the container. The waste will then slide into the hopper of the truck.

The modern rear loader usually compacts the waste using a hydraulically powered mechanism that employs a moving plate or shovel to scoop the waste out from the loading hopper and compress it against a moving wall. In most compactor designs, the plate has a pointed edge (hence giving it the industry standard name &quot;packer blade&quot;) which is designed to apply point pressure to the waste to break down bulky items in the hopper before being drawn into the main body of the truck.

Compactor designs have been many and varied, however the two most popular in use today are the &quot;sweep and slide&quot; system (first pioneered on the Leach 2R Packmaster), where the packer blade pivots on a moving carriage which slides back and forth in large tracks fabricated into the body sides, and the &quot;swing link&quot; system (such as the Dempster Routechief) where the blade literally swings on a &quot;pendulum&quot;-style mechanism consisting of links which control the arc of the blade&#x27;s movement. The Geesink GPM series uses a pivoting packer blade which swings on an inverted U-shaped frame which lowers the blade into the hopper, where it sweeps the waste out; the frame then retracts back into the body to perform the compaction action. The Heil Colectomatic is a hybrid between the two philosophies- it used a combination of a lifting loading hopper and a pivoting sweeper blade to clear and compact waste in anticipation of the next load.

So-called &quot;continuous&quot; compactors were popular in the 1960s and 1970s. The German Shark design (later Rotopress) used a huge rotating drum fitted with spiral shaped paddles to draw waste in, and force it around an auger of decreasing pitch to compress it. SEMAT-Rey of France pioneered the rotating rake system (also used in the British Shelvoke and Drewry Revopak) to simultaneously shred and compress the waste as it is loaded. Other systems used a continuously rotating Archimedes&#x27; screw to draw in waste and mutilate it inside the body. A mixture of safety concerns, and higher fuel consumption has seen a decline in the popularity of continuously compacting garbage trucks, with only the Rotopress design remaining in production due to its niche in being able to effectively deal with green waste for composting.

A unique rear-loading system involves a rear loader and a front-loading tractor (usually a Caterpillar front loader with a Tink Claw) for yard waste collection (and in some cities, garbage and recycling). The front loader picks up yard waste set in the street, and then loaded into the back of a rear loader. This system is used in several cities, including San Jose.

===Side loaders===
Side loaders are loaded from the side, either manually, or with the assistance of a joystick-controlled robotic arm with a claw, used to automatically lift and tip wheeled bins into the truck&#x27;s hopper.

====Manual side loaders====

Manual side loaders (MSLs) feature a hopper in front of the body, similar to front loaders. Unlike front loaders, the actual hopper is very short, and sometimes is lower than the body, in order for the operator to dump the waste into the hopper. This also results in longer times for packing loads compared to rear loaders, although this can be offset by the time bringing waste to the truck. On some (but not all) vehicle models the hopper can be accessed from both sides, allowing two persons to collect waste from both sides of the street simultaneously and increasing vehicle efficiency.

==== Automated side loaders ====

Lift-equipped trucks are referred to as automated side loaders (ASLs). Similar to a front-end loader, the waste is compacted by an oscillating packer plate at the front of the loading hopper which forces the waste through an aperture into the main body and is therefore compacted towards the rear of the truck.

An automated side loader only needs one operator, whereas a traditional rear load garbage truck may require two or three people, and has the additional advantage of reducing on the job injuries due to repetitive heavy lifting. Due to these advantages, ASLs have become more popular than traditional manual collection. Typically an automated side loader uses standardized wheeled carts compatible with the truck&#x27;s automated lift.

As with front loaders, the compaction mechanism comprises a metal pusher plate (often called an &#x27;inverted drawer&#x27; due to its appearance) in the collection hopper which oscillates backwards and forwards under hydraulic pressure, pushing the refuse through an aperture, thus compacting it against the material already loaded. On some ASLs there is also a &quot;folding&quot; crusher plate positioned above the opening in the hopper, that folds down to crush bulky items within reach of the metal pusher plate. Another compactor design is the &quot;paddle packer&quot; which uses a paddle that rotates from side to side, forcing refuse into the body of the truck.

====Manual/Automated side loaders====
Manual/Automated side loaders (M/ASLs), are traditional MSLs equipped with an arm for automated collection, as well as continuously running packers. This allows for functionally identical to that of an ASL, while allowing for manual dumping of waste into hopper in instances where automated collection is not feasible, such as the collection of oversized items. In addition, M/ASLs provide a cheaper upgrade path for those who wish to keep preexisting MSLs for automated collection without paying for newer and more expensive ASLs.

====Semi-automated side loaders====
Semi-automated side loaders are MSLs that are equipped with an automated mechanism to lift and dump manually aligned waste containers into the hopper. The primary difference between semi-automated side loaders and ASLs is that while they still only need one person to operate, he or she must exit the cab to manually bring and align containers to the loading hopper on the side of the truck and dump them.

==Specialized garbage trucks==
===Split body trucks===

Split body trucks are garbage trucks that have two collection compartments, one on the left side of the truck and the other on the right side of the truck. This is used to separate the materials that are not supposed to mix together. An example is to use one side to collect garbage and the other side to collect recyclables. Waste management companies may use split body trucks to collect both garbage and recycling in a single trip without dispatching two trucks on the same route.

Another case of using split body trucks is to collect dual-stream recycling materials. In this case, one side is used for commingled recyclable materials such as glass, plastic and metals, and the other side is for paper products.

Split body trucks can be in either rear loading or side loading types. In rear loaders, the two compartments are easily visible. In automatic side loaders, the gate-like separator at the top of the truck is used to control whether the materials will be dropped into the left or the right compartment but the loading process is the same for both compartments. This can create some confusion for people because they may not notice the automatic gate and assume that the truck mixes garbage and recyclables during the collection process.

===Pneumatic collection===
Pneumatic collection trucks have a crane with a tube and a mouthpiece that fits in a hole, usually hidden under a plate under the street. From here it will suck up waste from an underground installation. The system usually allows the driver to &quot;pick up&quot; the waste, even if the access is blocked by cars, snow or other barriers.

===Grapple trucks===

Grapple trucks enable the collection of bulk waste. A large percentage of items in the solid waste stream are too large or too heavy to be safely lifted by hand into traditional garbage trucks. These items (furniture, large appliances, branches, logs) are called bulky waste or &quot;oversized.&quot; The preferred method for collecting these items is with a grapple truck. Grapple trucks have hydraulic knucklebooms, tipped with a clamshell bucket, and usually include a dump body or trailer.

===Roll-offs===

Roll-offs are characterized by a rectangular footprint, utilizing wheels to facilitate rolling the dumpster in place. The container is designed to be transported by special roll-off trucks. They are relatively efficient for bulk loads of waste or extremely heavy loads of construction or demolition debris.

==Bin tipper==
 A bin tipper is a machine which mechanically lifts and inverts bins for the purpose of emptying them. They are often components of larger machines such as garbage trucks, or can be &#x27;standalone&#x27; or mobile units. Bin tippers usually have a steel frame, guarding and cradle, with a motor or crank-handle driving a lifting mechanism, which may be hydraulic or chain operated. Bins are placed into the machine, then lifted and inverted over the destination receptacle, allowing the contents to be emptied by gravity.

A side-load bin tipper was fitted to a garbage truck as early as 1929, by the Heil company in America. In the 1950s the Dempster Dumpmaster popularized the front-end loader variant, with bins being tipped over the cab of the truck. Both types of integrated bin tipper are now common on municipal refuse collection trucks. Standalone bin tippers developed later, with the release of a machine called the Simpro Ezi-Dump in 1990.

The use of bin tippers and other lifting aids has been stimulated in recent years by research linking heavy manual lifting with musculoskeletal disorders; some government organisations, schools and companies now prohibit emptying bins by hand. Health and safety concerns have also driven the adoption of bin tippers in the manufacturing, food-processing and construction industries.

<text>John Dudley Ball Jr. (July 8, 1911 – October 15, 1988) was an American writer best known for mystery novels involving the African-American police detective Virgil Tibbs. Tibbs was introduced in the 1965 novel &quot;In the Heat of the Night&quot;, which won the Edgar Award for Best First Novel from the Mystery Writers of America and was made into an Oscar-winning film of the same name, starring Sidney Poitier and Rod Steiger.

== Life ==

Ball was born in Schenectady, New York, grew up in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and attended Carroll College in Waukesha, Wisconsin. He wrote for a number of magazines and newspapers, including the &quot;Brooklyn Eagle&quot;. For a time he worked as a part-time reserve deputy for the Los Angeles County Sheriff&#x27;s Office, was trained in martial arts, and was a nudist. In the mid-1980s, he was the book review columnist for &quot;Mike Shayne Mystery Magazine&quot;. Ball lived in Encino, California, and died there in 1988. He was a member of the exclusive The Baker Street Irregulars, a society of ardent Sherlock Holmes fans. He was invested in the BSI in 1960 as &quot;The Oxford Flier.&quot;

Ball&#x27;s &quot;Last Plane Out&quot; consists of two stories which share characters and then meld together. The first involves a group of travelers in a troubled Third World country, waiting for the last plane out, which they hope will carry them to safety. The second story is shared by an aviation buff who is given his chance to increase his flying skills by the airline that has been built by the pilot of the first story.

He died in 1988 and was buried at the Forest Lawn, Hollywood Hills Cemetery in Los Angeles.

== Magic ==
While in college he performed as a semi-professional magician under the name &quot;Jacques Morintell&quot; and &quot;Howduzi&quot;. He was listed in the &quot;Who&#x27;s Who in Magic&quot; in the May 1933 issue of &quot;The Sphinx: An Independent Magazine for Magicians&quot; published from March 1902 through March 1953) and contributed an article called &quot;Further Ideas&quot; to &quot;The Sphinx&quot; in 1937.

<text>The United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations is a standing committee of the U.S. Senate charged with leading foreign-policy legislation and debate in the Senate. It is generally responsible for authorizing and overseeing foreign aid programs; arms sales and training for national allies; and holding confirmation hearings for high-level positions in the Department of State. Its sister committee in the House of Representatives is the Committee on Foreign Affairs.

Along with the Finance and Judiciary committees, the Foreign Relations Committee is among the oldest in the Senate, dating to the initial creation of committees in 1816. It has played a leading role in several important treaties and foreign policy initiatives throughout U.S. history, including the Alaska purchase, the establishment of the United Nations, and the passage of the Marshall Plan. The committee has also produced eight U.S. presidents—Andrew Jackson, James Buchanan, Andrew Johnson, Benjamin Harrison, Warren Harding, John F. Kennedy, Barack Obama, and Joe Biden (Buchanan and Biden serving as chairman)—and 19 secretaries of state. Notable members have included Arthur Vandenberg, Henry Cabot Lodge, and William Fulbright.

The Foreign Relations Committee is considered one of the most powerful and prestigious in the Senate, due to its long history, broad influence on U.S. foreign policy, jurisdiction over all diplomatic nominations, and its being the only Senate committee to deliberate and report treaties.

From 2021 to 2023, the Foreign Relations Committee was chaired by Democratic Senator Bob Menendez of New Jersey, until he stepped down as chair after facing federal corruption charges.

==Role==
In 1943, a confidential analysis of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee by British scholar Isaiah Berlin for the Foreign Office stated:

==History==

Between 1887 and 1907, Alabama Democrat John Tyler Morgan played a leading role on the committee. Morgan called for a canal linking the Atlantic and Pacific oceans through Nicaragua, enlarging the merchant marine and the Navy, and acquiring Hawaii, Puerto Rico, the Philippines and Cuba. He expected Latin American and Asian markets would become a new export market for Alabama&#x27;s cotton, coal, iron, and timber. The canal would make trade with the Pacific much more feasible, and an enlarged military would protect that new trade. By 1905, most of his dreams had become reality, with the canal passing through Panama instead of Nicaragua.

During World War II, the committee took the lead in rejecting traditional isolationism and designing a new internationalist foreign policy based on the assumption that the United Nations would be a much more effective force than the old discredited League of Nations. Of special concern was the insistence that Congress play a central role in postwar foreign policy, as opposed to its ignorance of the main decisions made during the war. Republican senator Arthur Vandenberg played the central role.
In 1966, as tensions over the Vietnam War escalated, the committee set up hearings on possible relations with Communist China. Witnesses, especially academic specialists on East Asia, suggested to the American public that it was time to adopt a new policy of containment without isolation. The hearings Indicated that American public opinion toward China had moved away from hostility and toward cooperation. The hearings had a long-term impact when Richard Nixon became president, discarded containment, and began a policy of détente with China. The problem remained of how to deal simultaneously with the Chinese government on Taiwan after formal recognition was accorded to the Beijing government. The committee drafted the Taiwan Relations Act (US, 1979) which enabled the United States both to maintain friendly relations with Taiwan and to develop fresh relations with China.

In response to conservative criticism that the state department lacked hardliners, President Ronald Reagan in 1981 nominated Ernest W. Lefever as Assistant Secretary of State. Lefever performed poorly at his confirmation hearings and the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations rejected his nomination by vote of 4–13, prompting Lefever to withdraw his name. Elliot Abrams filled the position.

Republican senator Jesse Helms, a staunch conservative, was committee chairman in the late 1990s. He pushed for reform of the UN by blocking payment of U.S. membership dues.

Bertie Bowman served as a staffer on the FRC from 1966 to 1990 and as the hearing coordinator from 2000 to 2021.

<text>The United States Senate Committee on Appropriations is a standing committee of the United States Senate. It has jurisdiction over all discretionary spending legislation in the Senate.

The Senate Appropriations Committee is the largest committee in the U.S. Senate, with 30 members in the 117th Congress. Its role is defined by the U.S. Constitution, which requires &quot;appropriations made by law&quot; prior to the expenditure of any money from the Treasury, and the committee is therefore one of the most powerful committees in the Senate. The committee was first organized on March 6, 1867, when power over appropriations was taken out of the hands of the Finance Committee.

The chairman of the Appropriations Committee has enormous power to bring home special projects (sometimes referred to as &quot;pork barrel spending&quot;) for their state as well as having the final say on other senators&#x27; appropriation requests. For example, in fiscal year 2005, per capita federal spending in Alaska, the home state of then-Chairman Ted Stevens, was $12,000, double the national average. Alaska has 11,772 special earmarked projects for a combined cost of $15,780,623,000. This represents about four percent of the overall spending in the $388 billion Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2005 passed by Congress.

From 2001 to 2021, every Senate Majority Leader was a previous or concurrently serving member of the Appropriations Committee: Tom Daschle (committee member, 1991–1999; majority leader, 2001–2003), Bill Frist (committee member, 1995–2002; majority leader, 2003–2007), Harry Reid (committee member, 1989–2006; majority leader, 2007–2015), and Mitch McConnell (current committee member; majority leader, 2015–2021).

==The appropriations process==

The federal budget is divided into two main categories: discretionary spending and mandatory spending. Each appropriations subcommittee develops a draft appropriations bill covering each agency under its jurisdiction based on the Congressional Budget Resolution, which is drafted by an analogous Senate Budget committee. Each subcommittee must adhere to the spending limits set by the budget resolution and allocations set by the full Appropriations Committee, though the full Senate may vote to waive those limits if 60 senators vote to do so. The committee also reviews supplemental spending bills (covering unforeseen or emergency expenses not previously budgeted).

Each appropriations bill must be passed by both houses of Congress and signed by the president prior to the start of the federal fiscal year, October 1. If that target is not met, as has been common in recent years, the committee drafts a continuing resolution, which is then approved by Congress and signed by the president to keep the federal government operating until the individual bills are approved.

==Jurisdiction==
In accordance of Rule XXV of the United States Senate, all proposed legislation, messages, petitions, memorials, and other matters relating to the following subjects is referred to the Senate Committee on Appropriations:
# Appropriation of the revenue for the support of the Government, except as provided in subparagraph (e);
# Rescission of appropriations contained in appropriation Acts (referred to in section 105 of title 1, United States Code);
# The amount of new spending authority described in section 401(c)(2) (A) and (B) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 which is to be effective for a fiscal year; and,
# New spending authority described in section 401(c)(2)(C) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 provided in bills and resolutions referred to the committee under section 401(b)(2) of that Act (but subject to the provisions of section 401(b)(3) of that Act).

Likewise, Article I, Section 9, Clause 7 of the United States Constitution, clearly vesting the power of the purse in Congress, states: &quot;No Money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law...and a regular Statement and Account of the Receipts and expenditures of all public Money shall be published from time to time.&quot; This clause is the foundation for the congressional appropriations process and the fundamental source of the Senate Appropriations Committee&#x27;s institutional power – as is the same with its counterpart in the lower house. In other words, Article I, Section 9, Clause 7 of the United States Constitution charges the United States Congress with the legislative duty of controlling government spending separate from the executive branch of government – a significant check and balance in the American constitutional system.

== Members, 119th Congress==

==Subcommittees==
===Committee reorganization during the 110th Congress===
At the outset of the 110th Congress, Chairman Robert Byrd and Chairman Dave Obey, his counterpart on the House Appropriations Committee, developed a committee reorganization plan that provided for common subcommittee structures between both houses, a move that both the chairmen hope will allow Congress to &quot;complete action on each of the government funding on time for the first time since 1994.&quot; The subcommittees were last overhauled between the 107th and 108th Congresses, after the creation of the Subcommittee on Homeland Security and again during the 109th Congress, when the number of subcommittees was reduced from 13 to 12.

A key part of the new subcommittee organization was the establishment of a new Subcommittee on Financial Services and General Government, which consolidates funding for the Treasury Department, the United States federal judiciary, and the District of Columbia. These functions were previously handled by two separate Senate subcommittees.

<doc id="465734" wikidata="Q2099366" url="?curid=465734" title="Affirmed">
<text>Affirmed (February 21, 1975 – January 12, 2001) was a champion American Thoroughbred racehorse who is the eleventh winner of the American Triple Crown. Affirmed was well known for his famous rivalry with Alydar, whom he met ten times, including Alydar coming second in each of the three 1978 Triple Crown races. After Affirmed won the Triple Crown, there was a 37-year wait until American Pharoah swept the series in 2015.

Affirmed won fourteen Grade One stakes races over his career and was a champion each of the three years he raced. At age two in 1977, he was named the champion two-year-old after winning the Hollywood Juvenile Championship, Sanford, Hopeful, Belmont Futurity and Laurel Futurity. At age three, he was named &quot;Horse of the Year&quot; for winning the Triple Crown and other major stakes races such as the Santa Anita Derby, Hollywood Derby and Jim Dandy Stakes. He repeated as Horse of the Year at age four after winning the final seven races in his career, all but one of which was a Grade I stakes race. He was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 1980. On the &quot;Blood-Horse&quot; magazine list of the Top 100 U.S. Racehorses of the 20th Century, he was ranked twelfth.

==Background==
Affirmed was a chestnut horse bred in Marion County, Florida by Louis Wolfson&#x27;s Harbor View Farm. The derivation of the name &quot;Affirmed&quot; has been the subject of speculation, in part because the conviction of Wolfson, for securities law violations, had been affirmed on appeal in 1969, resulting in his imprisonment. Affirmed was sired by the Harbor View stallion Exclusive Native, a high-class racehorse and breeding stallion, whose other progeny included the Kentucky Derby-winning filly Genuine Risk.

==Racing record==
===1977: two-year-old season===
As a two-year-old, Affirmed won seven of his nine starts, with two placings, for earnings of $343,477 under regular rider Steve Cauthen, then a teenager. Notably, six of those starts were against his rival, Calumet Farm&#x27;s Alydar, with Affirmed winning four and Alydar winning two.

Affirmed won his first start in a maiden special weight race at Belmont Park on May 24, 1977. He followed up with a win in the Youthful Stakes on June 15 where he defeated Alydar by eight lengths. On July 6 in the Great American Stakes, Alydar evened the score with a length win after mounting a powerful stretch drive.

Affirmed was then shipped across country to Hollywood Park, where he won the Hollywood Juvenile Championship Stakes on July 23. He then shipped back to New York where he won the Sanford Stakes at Saratoga on August 17 by lengths over the previously undefeated Tilt Up. In his next start on August 27 in the Hopeful Stakes, his main rival was Alydar, who was the even money favorite after winning four straight races. Affirmed stalked the early pace set by Tilt Up with Alydar in close contention. Around the far turn, Affirmed moved to the lead with Alydar closing ground on the outside. In mid-stretch, Alydar had closed to within a head but Affirmed pulled away in the final sixteenth of a mile to win by half a length. His time of 1: for furlongs was a new stakes record.

The two horses again faced off in the Belmont Futurity on September 10, with Affirmed going off as the narrow favorite. After a good start, Affirmed settled into second place behind longshot Rough Sea, while Alydar overcame a bad start to move into third place down the backstretch. Rounding into the stretch, Affirmed moved to the lead. Alydar responded and the two horses dueled head-to-head for the final furlong. Alydar appeared to be in the lead for much of the stretch drive before Affirmed rallied in the final stride to win by a nose. &quot;He never gave up&quot;, said Cauthen, &quot;even when he was headed&quot;.

Alydar turned the tables in the Champagne Stakes on October 15, sweeping by Affirmed in the stretch to win by lengths. The two faced off again in the Laurel Futurity on October 29, then one of the most prestigious races for two-year-olds in the country, with Affirmed winning by a neck. With his 4-2 margin in the series against Alydar, Affirmed was named the 1977 American Champion Two-Year-Old Colt.

===1978: three-year-old season===
Affirmed started his three-year-old campaign on the West Coast with an allowance race win in March, followed by victories in the San Felipe Stakes, Santa Anita Derby and Hollywood Derby. Meanwhile, Alydar was preparing for the Kentucky Derby with wins in the Flamingo Stakes, Florida Derby and Blue Grass Stakes.

====The Triple Crown====
Alydar was made the 6–5 favorite for Kentucky Derby, with Affirmed the second choice at 9–5 and undefeated Sensitive Prince the third choice at 9–2. At the start of the Kentucky Derby, Sensitive Prince took the early lead as Affirmed ran in third through the early stages, while Alydar stayed far back. Affirmed made a strong move for the lead on the far turn, put away a challenge by Wood Memorial winner Believe It, and held off Alydar&#x27;s fast-closing charge to win by lengths. Affirmed now had a 5–2 edge in the series.

In the Preakness Stakes, Affirmed set the pace. Alydar made his big move on the far turn, at the same point in the race where Affirmed made his winning move in the Derby. Affirmed held a short lead entering the stretch and held it to defeat Alydar by a neck.

Alydar&#x27;s partisans assumed that the mile distance of the Belmont, two furlongs longer than the Derby and 5/16 of a mile longer than the Preakness Stakes, would favor Alydar with his finishing style and staying pedigree, and he would deny Affirmed the Triple Crown. Trainer Veitch removed Alydar&#x27;s blinkers for the Belmont, saying that if Alydar got a better look at Affirmed, maybe he would get by him.

In the Belmont, Affirmed led and set a very slow pace, going the first quarter mile in 25 seconds and the half in 50 seconds. Alydar&#x27;s jockey, Jorge Velásquez, put Alydar close to the pace, and moved alongside Affirmed with more than seven furlongs to go. For more than six furlongs (half the distance of the race), the colts raced neck and neck, pulling away from the rest of the field. Alydar got his nose in front at mid-stretch, but just as Affirmed appeared to tire, Cauthen went to a left-handed whip, something he had never done before in his eight rides on Affirmed. Affirmed won by a nose to become racing&#x27;s 11th (and last winner for 37 years until American Pharoah won in 2015) Triple Crown winner. After the third slowest start in Belmont Stakes history, they raced the fastest last mile in Belmont Stakes history, in 1:14, the mile in 1:37 and finished in 2:26 . It was, at the time, the third fastest Belmont ever, behind Secretariat and Gallant Man.

His Triple Crown win set two records: the shortest and longest gaps between the previous and next Triple Crown winners. Affirmed&#x27;s win in 1978 was the first time the Triple Crown had been won in consecutive years (Seattle Slew won in 1977). Affirmed&#x27;s win also marked the start of the longest gap until the next Triple Crown winner, with American Pharoah&#x27;s win on June 6, 2015, occurring 37 years later.

====After the Triple Crown====
Affirmed returned to racing in early August in the Jim Dandy Stakes at Saratoga. He nearly became an upset loser to the front-running Sensitive Prince but closed in the last 100 yards in a race that Laz Barrera considered one of Affirmed&#x27;s finest efforts.

Alydar and Affirmed met once more, in the Travers Stakes at Saratoga. Affirmed, piloted by Hall of Fame jockey Laffit Pincay substituting for the injured Cauthen, cut off Alydar entering the far turn, causing his rival to hit the rail and almost go down, losing six lengths before recovering his stride. Affirmed finished first but was disqualified for interference, and placed second and Alydar was declared the winner. The horses never met again, and the final winning tally stood at Affirmed 7, Alydar 3.

Affirmed then prepared to meet another major rival: 1977 Triple Crown winner Seattle Slew. The 1978 Marlboro Cup Invitational Handicap marked the first time in racing history that two Triple Crown winners ever met in a race. Seattle Slew was a speed horse and got the first quarter mile in 24 seconds under jockey Angel Cordero, who never allowed Affirmed to get close. Seattle Slew won by three lengths in 1:45 for the one-turn mile and . The two horses met once more, in the Jockey Club Gold Cup. This time, Affirmed was to be aided by his stablemate Life&#x27;s Hope, who was entered in the race to extend Seattle Slew in the early stages. However, Affirmed&#x27;s saddle slipped during the race, leaving his jockey with almost no control. He tired to finish unplaced for the only time in his career as Exceller and jockey Willie Shoemaker defeated Seattle Slew by a nose.

As a three-year-old, Affirmed won 8 of 11 starts with 2 seconds and 1 unplaced run, for earnings of $901,541. He was named Horse of the Year despite the losses to Alydar, Seattle Slew, and Exceller, and was also named the American Champion Three-Year-Old Male Horse.

===1979: four-year-old season===
As a four-year-old in 1979, Affirmed started the season with a third place in the Malibu Stakes and a second in the San Fernando Stakes. He had a five race losing sequence prior to starting in the Charles H. Strub Stakes at Santa Anita Park. Laz Barrera replaced Cauthen with Pincay and Affirmed didn&#x27;t lose again and would dominate the handicaps the rest of the year.

Affirmed won the Strub Stakes, and then ran in the Santa Anita Handicap against Exceller, who had defeated Seattle Slew and Affirmed in 1978. Affirmed won easily, running the miles in 1:, under 128 pounds while setting a stakes record in California&#x27;s most important stakes race that stood until 2014. Affirmed then went to Hollywood Park, where he won the Californian Stakes under 130 pounds giving runner-up Syncopate 16 pounds. Next, carrying top weight of 132 pounds, he won the Hollywood Gold Cup in a three horse finish, from Sirlad (120 pounds) and Text (119 pounds), setting an all time earnings record and running the miles in a fast 1:58 . Affirmed picked up the Woodward Stakes at Belmont Park, and then faced one more all-time great horse, three-year-old Spectacular Bid, in the Jockey Club Gold Cup, also at Belmont. Spectacular Bid, like Alydar, preferred to run off the pace, and once again, Affirmed was allowed to set a slow pace, going the first half mile in 49 seconds. Spectacular Bid issued challenges at Affirmed, but Affirmed won. Spectacular Bid was undefeated during the rest of his racing career.

Affirmed was named Horse of the Year and the American Champion Older Male Horse of 1979, having won 7 of 9 starts with 1 second and 1 third as a four-year-old and earning $1,148,800. In his career, Affirmed earned a then record $2,393,818 (the first Thoroughbred in North America to win over $2 million) with 22 wins, 5 seconds and 1 third from 29 starts.

His trainer, Laz Barrera, once said: &quot;Affirmed is greater than Secretariat, or any Triple Crown winner, because only Affirmed had to face Alydar.&quot;

Affirmed&#x27;s full race record is listed below:

==Stud record==
Affirmed was syndicated at a then-record $14.4 million. At stud, Affirmed sired over 80 stakes winners, 9 champions with earnings in excess of $44,000,000 (through 2004) including:
* Charlie Barley, stakes winner in US, winner of Canadian Champion Male Turf Horse in 1989
* Flawlessly, North America&#x27;s grass course champion in 1992 and 1993
* Peteski (CAN), won USA Molson Export Million Stakes and Canadian Triple Crown.
* The Tin Man, won multiple Grade I races, including the Arlington Million
* Trusted Partner (USA), won G1 IRE One Thousand Guineas

Though Affirmed never raced on the turf (grass) he was a noted sire of turf runners, most notably multiple Grade I winners Flawlessly and The Tin Man. As a broodmare sire, his daughters have notably produced Honey Ryder (G1W on turf) and Pleasantly Perfect (G1W on dirt &amp; synthetic, notable wins include Breeders Cup Classic and the Dubai World Cup).

In 2001, Affirmed was euthanized after falling seriously ill with laminitis, a circulatory hoof disease. The same disease has also led to the death of fellow Triple Crown winner Secretariat and Kentucky Derby winner Barbaro. He was buried whole—the ultimate honor for a race horse—at Jonabell Farm, wearing the flamingo pink colors of his original owners, Harbor View Farm.

== Rivalry with Alydar ==

Final: Affirmed 7, Alydar 3

*In their final meeting, Affirmed drifted in, forcing Alydar to be taken up on the backstretch. While Affirmed finished ahead of Alydar, the stewards decided to disqualify Affirmed from first to second, giving Alydar the final win.

==Honors==
In the Blood-Horse magazine ranking of the top 100 U.S. thoroughbred champions of the 20th Century, Affirmed was ranked #12.

His career has been honored with his election to the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame in 1980.

<text>Seattle Slew (February 15, 1974 – May 7, 2002) was a champion American Thoroughbred racehorse who became the tenth winner of the American Triple Crown (1977). He is one of only two horses to have won the Triple Crown while being undefeated in any previous race; the second was Justify who won the Triple Crown in 2018 and is descended from Seattle Slew. Seattle Slew was the 1977 Horse of the Year and a champion at ages two, three, and four. In the &quot;Blood-Horse&quot; magazine List of the Top 100 U.S. Racehorses of the 20th Century Seattle Slew was ranked ninth.

Joe Hirsch of the &quot;Daily Racing Form&quot; wrote of Seattle Slew&#x27;s three-year-old campaign: &quot;Every time he ran he was an odds-on favorite, and the response to his presence on the racetrack, either for a morning workout or a major race, was electric. &#x27;Slewmania&#x27; was a virulent and widespread condition.&quot;

Seattle Slew later became an outstanding sire and broodmare sire, leading the North American sire list in 1984 when his son Swale won the Kentucky Derby and Belmont Stakes. Another son, A.P. Indy, won the Belmont Stakes and continued the sire line through descendants such as Mineshaft, Tapit, and California Chrome.

==Background==
Seattle Slew was a dark bay horse with a small white patch of hair by his left rear hoof. He was bred by Ben S. Castleman, a Kentucky racing commissioner, and was foaled at White Horse Acres near Lexington, Kentucky. Seattle Slew was the first foal out of My Charmer, a stakes-winning daughter of the otherwise obscure sire Poker. My Charmer went on to produce the 2000 Guineas winner Lomond and Seattle Dancer, and several of her daughters became outstanding producers. My Charmer descends from champion and noted &quot;blue hen&quot; Myrtlewood. Castleman originally intended to breed My Charmer to Jacinto but that stallion&#x27;s book was full so Seth Hancock of Claiborne Farm recommended the mare be bred instead to Bold Reasoning, a first-crop sire who had won the Jersey Derby and Withers Stakes in 1971. Bold Reasoning was a grandson of Bold Ruler, whose descendants, including Secretariat, dominated the Kentucky Derby in the 1970s.

Seattle Slew was not considered particularly attractive as a foal, leading some to say he looked like a mule. He was so awkward that his first nickname was Baby Huey. As he matured though, he developed a graceful front-running style with an acceleration that was compared to &quot;a falcon in a dive&quot;. At maturity, he stood high at the withers with strong hind legs and a powerful shoulder. However, his right forefoot was noticeably turned out.

Seattle Slew was purchased for just $17,500 (equivalent to $ in ) at the 1975 Fasig-Tipton yearling auction. His new owners, later known as &quot;the Slew Crew&quot;, were Karen and Mickey Taylor and Jim and Sally Hill. Horse owners since the early 1970s, Karen Taylor was a former flight attendant, and her husband, Mickey Taylor, was a lumberman. They lived in White Swan, Washington. Jim Hill, a veterinarian, picked out Seattle Slew at the sale, though the original budget was only $12,000. Karen Taylor, liking the look of the colt, urged her husband to go higher. They named the colt for the city of Seattle and the sloughs which loggers once used to transport heavy logs. Karen felt that the pronunciation of &quot;slough&quot; — a slow-moving channel of the Pacific Northwest — would be too hard for people to remember, so the spelling was changed to &quot;Slew&quot;. A later co-owner was Glenn Rasmussen, the accountant for the equine partnerships.

Seattle Slew&#x27;s owners sent the colt to Billy Turner, a friend and former steeplechase rider who had trained horses seasonally in Maryland since the early 1960s. Based at Belmont Park in the mid-1970s, Turner accepted Seattle Slew and another Taylor-Hill purchase and sent them to Andor Farm in Monkton, where his wife at the time, Paula, taught yearlings to be ridden.

Seattle Slew was described as &quot;intelligent, dominant and determined&quot;. &quot;He was very easygoing,&quot; Turner said. &quot;He liked people but he wasn&#x27;t lovey dovey. He didn&#x27;t like people petting him. He was the boss hoss. He would stand back and just look at you. He would let you do whatever you wanted him to do, but only if he wanted to do it.&quot;

==Racing career==

===1976: two-year-old season===

Seattle Slew&#x27;s debut was delayed by his initial awkwardness, but he started to attract attention over the course of the summer at Saratoga with some fast workouts. Taylor later recalled that the colt had been timed in a brilliant time of seconds for three-eighths of a mile, but the clocker instead recorded the time as 36 seconds because he felt people wouldn&#x27;t believe the right figure. Slew was set to make his first start at the end of August but injured himself in his stall. He finally made his first start in a six-furlong maiden race on September 20, 1976, the fifth race at Belmont Park. The big, nearly black colt was bet down to the 5:2 favorite. He gave the public its first look at what was later called his &quot;war dance&quot; (his habit of tiptoeing on the track before his races) and won by five lengths. He followed up in seven-furlong allowance race on October 5, 1976, winning by lengths.

On October 16, Taylor stepped the colt up in class to enter the Grade I Champagne Stakes, then the most important race for two-year-olds in the United States. His biggest rival was For the Moment, who had won four straight races including the Belmont Futurity and was a full-brother to champion Honest Pleasure. Nonetheless, Seattle Slew went off as the almost even-money favorite. Jockey Jean Cruguet sent him straight to the lead and opened up a lead down the backstretch. None of the other riders chose to challenge him, perhaps believing the colt would tire down the stretch. Instead Seattle Slew continued to draw away, eventually winning by lengths in a time of 1: for one mile, then a stakes record.

Despite starting just three times, Seattle Slew was named Champion Two-Year-Old of 1976.

===1977: three-year-old season===
Turner scheduled three races for Seattle Slew leading up to the Kentucky Derby, which was then considered to be a light campaign. Turner felt that the main threat to Seattle Slew was his health, because the horse ran so fast and hard every time. Hill later said that Turner used the prep races as workouts and did as little as possible in between. Turner scheduled only 19 breezes for Seattle Slew before and during his Triple Crown campaign, instead trying to get the colt to relax.

Seattle Slew&#x27;s first start came as a three-year-old in an allowance race on March 9, 1977, at Hialeah Park Race Track. Going off at odds of 1:10, he dueled with White Rammer for the early lead while completing the first quarter-mile in a swift seconds. He kept up the pace, completing the half-mile in 44 seconds and six furlongs in 1:08 flat (which would have been a new track record). Eased in the final sixteenth of a mile, he still set a seven-furlong track record of 1: in winning by nine lengths. Despite the ease of the win, Turner was concerned, fearing the colt was using too much energy early in his races to withstand the challenge of the longer races to come.

On March 26, Seattle Slew entered the Flamingo Stakes, where he went off at odds of 1:5. He set his own pace and opened a large lead moving into the final turn. He was eased down the stretch but still won by four lengths in a time of 1: for miles – the third-fastest time in the stakes&#x27; 51-year history.

He then shipped north to Aqueduct Racetrack in New York, where he became the subject of intense media scrutiny. His owners considered entering him in the Gotham Stakes on April 9 but Turner was against it because heavy rains had rendered the main track unusable, meaning the colt had not been able to properly work out. Instead, Seattle Slew made his third start of the year on April 23 in the Wood Memorial Stakes. Going off as the 1:10 favorite, he went to the early lead, challenged by Fratello Ed. Cruguet got the colt to relax and they set sensible fractions, then coasted to a length win. The time of 1: was considered unimpressive, but his connections were pleased by the horse&#x27;s demeanor. &quot;He doesn&#x27;t have to run the way he has before,&quot; said Cruguet. &quot;He was never really pressed.&quot;

====Kentucky Derby====
The &quot;Slew Crew&quot; then relocated to Churchill Downs where the Taylors set up a camper opposite the colt&#x27;s stall in Barn 42, which traditionally houses the favorite for the Kentucky Derby. With Mickey Taylor&#x27;s father acting as chief bodyguard for the colt, the connections dealt with a constant stream of visitors. Showing his growing maturity, Seattle Slew remained relaxed throughout the week leading up to the race. His training did not go entirely to expectations however when he posted an uncharacteristically slow workout the Sunday before the race. Turner planned to sharpen the colt with a five-furlong breeze on the Thursday before the race but the track came up muddy. Seattle Slew&#x27;s final workout was a three-furlong breeze in seconds the morning before the Derby was held.

The 1977 Kentucky Derby was held on May 7 before a crowd of 124,028. The track was rated as fast despite showers earlier in the day. Seattle Slew was the heavy favorite at odds of 1:2 but still faced a large field as many felt the colt would be vulnerable at the Derby&#x27;s distance of miles. The second choice was Run Dusty Run, who had been the second-ranked two-year-old and had run second in several major Derby prep races. For the Moment was also given a strong chance after winning the Blue Grass Stakes.

In reaction to the crowd noise, Seattle Slew washed out in the paddock and again during the post parade. Cruguet did little to warm up the colt, instead taking him away from the crowd to relax. He had drawn post position three, and had to wait in the starting gate for the rest of the field to load. Slew reacted slowly at the break then swerved nearly sideways and found himself trapped near the back of the field. He reacted by charging through the field, bumping several other horses who were in his way. After two furlongs, he had worked his way into second place just behind For the Moment. The two colts then dueled around the first turn before Cruguet got Seattle Slew to relax down the backstretch, under a tight restraint, allowing For the Moment to open up a lead of a length. For the Moment completed the first three-quarters of a mile in 1:, then was joined again by Seattle Slew as they moved around the final turn. At the top of the stretch, Cruguet went to the whip and Seattle Slew pulled away by 4 lengths, then shut down in the final eighth of a mile to win by lengths over Run Dusty Run.

The colt still had his detractors. The final time of 2: was considered slow, particularly as the final quarter mile was run in seconds. Turner pointed to the interruptions in the colt&#x27;s training. &quot;Because of the circumstances, he was somewhat undertrained. You knew it, and I knew it,&quot; he said.

Seattle Slew was visibly upset after the race. &quot;It was the only time I was scared of him,&quot; said his groom, John Polston. &quot;He was so high-strung that night, he was evil, just evil. I couldn&#x27;t believe how wound tight he was. It was like he hadn&#x27;t even been in a race. I had to take him from the hotwalker and he ran over me a couple of times. I&#x27;d never seen him like that before.&quot;

====Preakness Stakes====
Two weeks later, in the -mile Preakness Stakes, Seattle Slew faced a new rival in multiple-stakes-winner Cormorant. Many handicappers believed a predicted speed duel with Cormorant would jeopardize the Derby winner&#x27;s chances; Andrew Beyer picked Cormorant to win in his &quot;Washington Post&quot; column. Other highly rated contenders were J. O. Tobin, the English champion two-year-old colt of 1976, and Iron Constitution, who had won the Withers Stakes. For the first time, Turner chose to have the colt given butazolidin before the race, fearing that Seattle Slew might suffer a minor injury in his final workout.

Seattle Slew broke from post position 8 with Cormorant to his inside on a track with a definite bias for runners on the rail. As expected, the two battled for the early lead, sprinting nearly ten lengths clear of the rest of the field while setting fast fractions of seconds for the first quarter-mile and for the first half. Around the far turn, Seattle Slew started to open up a lead while completing the mile in 1:. Cruguet then eased up on the colt down the stretch, allowing Iron Constitution to close to within lengths. The final time of 1: was one of the fastest in the history of the race, especially notable as the track was considered to be somewhat dead.

====Belmont Stakes====
Seattle Slew trained well during the three weeks between the Preakness and Belmont Stakes, showing a new level of determination according to Turner. During one of his final workouts, Slew was pulled up early by his exercise rider. &quot;He was afraid he could not hold him,&quot; said Turner. &quot;I had warned the outriders, too. This horse might have gone around two or three times.&quot;

The 1977 Belmont Stakes was run on June 11 on a muddy track before a crowd of 70,229, with eight rivals facing Seattle Slew. Turner arrived late at the saddling enclosure, due in part to the number of cars parked on the backstretch, as well as his desire to limit the colt&#x27;s exposure to the enthusiastic crowd. &quot;Turner was fined,&quot; said Sally Hill later. &quot;We paid the fine. They weren&#x27;t going to start the race without him.&quot;

Going off at odds of 2:5, Seattle Slew went to the early lead. Though pressed at first by Spirit Level and then Run Dusty Run, he was able to relax, completing the opening mile in a leisurely 1:. Spirit Level and Run Dusty Run closed down the gap around the far turn, and then Sanhedrin made a strong run to move into second place, raising concerns about Slew&#x27;s ability to complete the distance. Seattle Slew responded to the challenge in the final quarter-mile when he opened up daylight between himself and the rest of the field. Down the stretch, Cruguet tapped him with the whip a few times to keep the colt&#x27;s mind on the race and Seattle Slew won comfortably by four lengths over Run Dusty Run. He became the tenth American Triple Crown winner and (with his nine-for-nine record) was the first Triple Crown winner to finish the series undefeated.

Cruguet stood up in the stirrups and raised his right hand triumphantly some 20 yards before the finish line, leading some to criticize him for the &quot;emotional flourish&quot;. Cruguet described his feelings as &quot;happiness, just happiness&quot; before hurrying off to ride in the next race. Turner was harder hit. &quot;I ducked into a stall and broke down and cried,&quot; he said. &quot;It was such a relief, because the pressure was off.&quot;

====Aftermath====
After the Triple Crown, Seattle Slew was sent to Hollywood Park Racetrack, which increased the purse for the Swaps Stakes to over $300,000 to lure him to run on July 3. In the Swaps, Seattle Slew was unable to get to the front as jockey Bill Shoemaker sent J.O. Tobin to the lead. J.O. Tobin set fast early fractions for a -mile race – for the first quarter-mile, for the half, 1: for six furlongs and 1: for the mile. Seattle Slew, boxed in for much of the race with Text to his side, eventually broke free but tired badly in the stretch. He finished fourth, 16 lengths behind J.O. Tobin, who won in a stakes record of 1:, just two-fifths off the world record for the distance at that time.

The race was the cause of much controversy. Before shipping to California, Seattle Slew had been sedated repeatedly to be used in a Xerox advertising campaign for a new X-ray machine, then was sedated again during the flight. Turner believed this contributed to Seattle Slew&#x27;s dull effort. Turner also said that he had disagreed with the decision to ship to California at all, feeling the colt needed more time to recover from the Triple Crown. The owners said that Turner had not raised objections prior to the race, and further that Turner&#x27;s drinking problems were putting the horse at risk. At the end of the year, Turner was fired and replaced by Douglas Peterson.

Meanwhile, Seattle Slew was given time off to recover, then resumed training in August for a fall campaign. However, he was sidelined by a suspension to Hill, whose ownership share had been previously undisclosed. Despite the disappointing end to the season, Seattle Slew was the easy winner in the voting for champion three-year-old at the annual Eclipse Awards. The voting for American Horse of the Year honors was closer, with Seattle Slew prevailing over Forego by votes to .

===1978===
In early 1978, Seattle Slew was stabled at Hialeah and was expected to make three or four starts in Florida, followed by a full campaign in New York&#x27;s major stakes races. He was scheduled to make the first start of his four-year-old campaign on January 16, 1978, in the Tallahassee Handicap. However, he was scratched from the race on January 14 when he lost his appetite and was found to have a fever of 102. His condition then went quickly downhill, marked by weakness, dehydration and a sharp decrease in his white blood cell count. It was later revealed that his jugular vein had collapsed when a pre-race injection of butazolidin missed the vein.

While Seattle Slew slowly recovered, his owners contemplated retiring him to stud. Instead, they kept him in training for 1978 while syndicating him for a then-record $12 million. The Taylor and Hill families retained 50% of the shares while Brownwell Combs of Spendthrift Farm headed the syndication group.

Seattle Slew eventually returned to training and was shipped north to Aqueduct, which held &quot;Seattle Slew day&quot; on April 29. A crowd of 25,931 cheered while Seattle Slew was led around the paddock and then taken on track for a six-furlong workout, completed handily in 1:. On May 14, Seattle Slew returned to racing in a seven-furlong allowance race. Over an extremely muddy track, he settled in second place behind Gallant Bob for the first quarter-mile, then started to open up on the field, eventually winning by lengths. Despite the adverse track conditions and never being urged by Cruguet, his time was a &quot;brisk&quot; 1:.

Seattle Slew was being pointed to the Metropolitan Handicap at the end of May but suffered another setback when a filling in his left hind leg was discovered. The problem was thought to be minor, but it was not until August that he made his next start. This was in a seven-furlong allowance race at Saratoga Race Course, which he won by six lengths in 1: over a sloppy track.

In preparation for his fall campaign, Seattle Slew was sent to the Meadowlands on September 5 for a night race, the Paterson Handicap at a distance of miles. He went off as the 1:5 favorite despite being assigned 128 pounds. His main rival was Dr. Patches, who had an excellent record at the Meadowlands and was carrying only 114 pounds. Seattle Slew went straight to the lead and set fast early fractions. Turning for home though, Dr. Patches made his move and slowly drew past. Seattle Slew tried to fight back but lost by a neck in a major upset. Jean Cruguet lost the mount after the race, after expressing doubt if the horse had been sufficiently trained.

====Marlboro Cup====
The 1978 Marlboro Cup, run on September 16, was the first time that two Triple Crown winners raced each other. Affirmed had won the Triple Crown in a thrilling showdown with Alydar, and had won all but one of his starts that year, that loss coming by disqualification. Taylor was not concerned by Affirmed&#x27;s reputation. &quot;We&#x27;ve watched every one of his races this year and watched them carefully,&quot; he said. &quot;He&#x27;s an outstanding horse, but so is Slew. Affirmed had better be ready when the Marlboro Cup comes up, because he&#x27;s going to see one big, black butt in front of him.&quot;

For the only time in his career, Seattle Slew was not the favorite, going off at 2:1 compared to Affirmed at 1:2. Affirmed and Seattle Slew were both known as front-runners but Seattle Slew&#x27;s new jockey Angel Cordero Jr. felt that Affirmed had benefited from setting slow early fractions in his early races. He sent Seattle Slew to the lead and completed the first quarter in an easy 24 seconds, then picked up the pace down the backstretch to complete the half-mile in 47 seconds with Affirmed two lengths behind. Rounding the final turn into the stretch, Cordero allowed Slew to swing wide. Affirmed came up on the inside, but Seattle Slew responded to beat Affirmed by three lengths, with Nasty And Bold in third, five lengths further back. He completed the distance of miles in a time of 1:, just two-fifths of a second off the world record set by Secretariat in the 1973 Marlboro Cup.

&quot;I knew when we were able to go to the lead that we could win it,&quot; Cordero said. &quot;Slew is such a nice horse and I was able to relax him on the backstretch. There isn&#x27;t a horse in the world that could have beaten him today.&quot;

====Woodward Stakes====
Two weeks later, Seattle Slew was entered in the Woodward Stakes, then held at Belmont Park over the American classic distance of miles. Affirmed skipped the race, making Exceller the main contender in a field of five. Seattle Slew coasted through the first quarter in seconds, then picked up the pace under slight pressure from Exceller, normally known for his closing kick. Turning for home, Cordero used the whip twice and Seattle Slew drew off to win by four lengths. His time of 2 minutes flat for miles was a Belmont course record for a race started on the turn. (At that time, 10 furlong races at Belmont were normally started in a chute, allowing the horses to run straight for about half the race. However, the chute was under repair in 1978). The winnings from the race made Seattle Slew the 23rd horse in racing history to earn a million dollars.

====Jockey Club Gold Cup====
In October, Seattle Slew and Affirmed met again in the -mile Jockey Club Gold Cup at Belmont, which was televised nationally on the CBS network. Affirmed&#x27;s trainer, Laz Barrera, did not want Seattle Slew to get an easy lead and dictate the pace as he had in the Marlboro Cup, so Barrera also entered a &quot;rabbit&quot; (Life&#x27;s Hope) in an attempt to tire Slew. Seattle Slew ran in fractions of for the first quarter, for the half and 1: for three-quarters – extremely fast early times for a long race. Life&#x27;s Hope dropped back, then Affirmed also faltered, having raced too close to the pace. Affirmed&#x27;s problems were compounded when his saddle slipped.

Meanwhile, Bill Shoemaker on Exceller took advantage of the fast pace. Far back early, Exceller made a strong move on the far turn and saved ground by moving inside Seattle Slew as the tiring horse bore out turning for home. Exceller took the lead at the top of the stretch, and opened a half-length lead in midstretch. Seattle Slew fought back and lost by a nose in a photo finish. This stretch run is still remembered as among the all-time best, ranking with Sunday Silence and Easy Goer&#x27;s Preakness in 1989 and the battles between Affirmed and Alydar. Despite the defeat, many analysts considered this to be Seattle Slew&#x27;s greatest performance. Andrew Beyer (a Seattle Slew skeptic when the horse was a three-year-old) wrote for his lead, &quot;Exceller was the winner of yesterday&#x27;s Jockey Club Gold Cup, Seattle Slew was its hero.&quot;

====Stuyvesant Handicap====
Seattle Slew&#x27;s last race was in the Stuyvesant Handicap on November 11 at Aqueduct Racetrack. He was assigned the high weight of , conceding his rivals from 19 to 27 pounds. As the 1-10 favorite, he went to the early lead and was never challenged, winning by lengths. He completed the -mile race in 1:, just off the track and stakes record set by Riva Ridge in 1973. Watching the race were Turner and Cruguet, who both expressed regret that they&#x27;d had to part ways with the horse. &quot;Even now,&quot; said Cruguet, &quot;he should be undefeated&quot;.

Seattle Slew retired with 14 wins in 17 races and earnings of $1,208,726. He was named Champion Older Horse in 1978 but lost the Horse of the Year balloting to the horse he defeated in the Marlboro Cup, Affirmed.

==Stud career==

Seattle Slew stood at stud at Spendthrift Farm in Lexington for seven years, before moving to Three Chimneys Farm in Midway in 1985. He was the leading sire of 1984, when his son Swale (who died later that year) won the Kentucky Derby and Belmont Stakes. He is part of a unique three generation sequence of Belmont Stakes Winners: Seattle Slew (who won the race in 1977) sired A.P. Indy (1992) who in turn sired Rags to Riches. Rags to Riches was just the third filly to win the race, after Ruthless in 1867 and Tanya in 1905. The victory earned jockey John Velazquez and trainer Todd Pletcher their first wins in any Triple Crown race.
Seattle Slew sired 1,103 named foals, of which 537 (48.7%) were winners and 111 (10.1%) were stakes winners. Major winners by Seattle Slew include:
* A.P. Indy – Belmont Stakes, Breeders&#x27; Cup Classic, 1992 Horse of the Year (USA) and champion three-year-old, Hall of Fame inductee
* Adored – Santa Margarita, Delaware Handicap
*Capote – Breeders&#x27; Cup Juvenile
*Fleet Renee – Ashland, Mother Goose
*Flute – Kentucky Oaks
*Hail Atlantis – Santa Anita Oaks
*Lakeway – Santa Anita Oaks, Hollywood Oaks, Mother Goose
*Landaluce – Oak Leaf Stakes, Champion two-year-old filly
*Life at the Top – Mother Goose
*Magic of Life – Coronation Stakes
*Seattle Song – Prix de la Salamandre, Washington DC International
*Septieme Ciel – Prix de la Forêt
*Slew City Slew – Oaklawn Handicap, Gulfstream Park Handicap
*Slew o&#x27; Gold - multiple stakes winner including Jockey Club Gold Cup (twice), Woodward Stakes (twice), Marlboro Stakes, Wood Memorial. Champion three-year-old (1983) and champion older horse (1984). Hall of fame inductee
*Slewpy – Young American Stakes, Meadowlands Cup
*Surfside – multiple stakes winner including Frizette and Santa Anita Oaks. Champion three-year-old filly (2000)
*Swale – Kentucky Derby and Belmont Stakes
*Taiki Blizzard – Yasuda Kinen
*Vindication – Breeders&#x27; Cup Juvenile, Champion Two-Year-Old Colt of 2002
The primary conduit for the continuation of Seattle Slew&#x27;s male line has been through A.P. Indy, who was the leading sire in North America of 2003 and 2006. A.P. Indy sired the 2003 Horse of the Year, Mineshaft, Preakness Stakes winner Bernardini and Belmont Stakes winner Rags to Riches. A.P. Indy&#x27;s grandsons include Tapit. the leading North American sire in 2014, 2015 and 2016. Slew City Slew was also a good sire, whose sons include California champion Lava Man. In 2006, Lava Man became the first horse to win the Santa Anita Handicap, Hollywood Gold Cup and Pacific Classic Stakes in the same year.

In 2014, Seattle Slew&#x27;s great-great-grandson, California Chrome, won the Kentucky Derby and the Preakness. California Chrome was the second Kentucky Derby winner in a row who was a sire-line descendant of Seattle Slew, following Orb in 2013. California Chrome&#x27;s bid for the Triple Crown was defeated by another great-grandson of Seattle Slew, Tonalist, by Tapit. Tapit also sired the winners of the 2016 and 2017 Belmont Stakes, Creator and Tapwrit respectively.

Seattle Slew was also a notable broodmare sire, leading the North American list in both 1995 and 1996. His daughters produced (among others) Cigar, the leading North American money-earner of his day.

==Legacy==
Seattle Slew underwent spinal fusion surgery at Rood and Riddle Equine Hospital for a neurological condition in 2000, followed by a second surgery in 2002. Upon recovery from the second surgery, he was moved to Hill &#x27;n&#x27; Dale Farm to recover: his old stall at Three Chimney&#x27;s was too close to the breeding shed, and he became agitated whenever mares arrived at the farm.

On May 7, 2002, 25 years to the day after he won the Kentucky Derby, Seattle Slew died in his sleep at age 28. He was buried whole at Hill &#x27;n&#x27; Dale, the highest honor for a winning race horse, with his favorite blanket and a bag of peppermints. Three Chimneys Farm erected a statue of Seattle Slew near the stallion barn in his honor. Since fellow Triple Crown winner and rival Affirmed had died the year before, he had been the sole living Triple Crown winner. At the horse&#x27;s death, there were no living Triple Crown winners for the first time since Sir Barton won the first Triple Crown in 1919. This phenomenon continued until American Pharoah&#x27;s Triple Crown in 2015.

The Taylors remained close to Seattle Slew throughout his life and were with him at the time of his death. &quot;He had the greatest heart,&quot; said Karen Taylor. &quot;He was a fighter to the end.&quot; John Sikura of Hill &#x27;n&#x27; Dale commented, &quot;To be near greatness is what everyone in this business aspires to, and it happens so rarely. He was one in a million, and showed us there is that possibility in a game of impossibilities.&quot;

Seattle Slew was inducted into the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame in 1981. In the BloodHorse magazine&#x27;s listing of the top 100 American thoroughbreds of the twentieth century, he was ranked ninth. A British publication, &quot;A Century of Champions&quot;, ranked him fourth among North American racehorses. In 2002, ESPN telecast a &quot;SportsCentury&quot; on Seattle Slew.

The book &quot;Seattle Slew&quot;, by Steve Cady and Barton Silverman, was released by Penguin Books in 1977. In 2000, the Eclipse Press released another book of the same title, written by Dan Mearns as part of the &quot;Thoroughbred Legends&quot; series.

In 2015, the state of Kentucky starting issuing a license plate bearing Seattle Slew&#x27;s image, based on a photograph by Tony Leonard. Proceeds benefit the Kentucky Equine Education Project Foundation (KEEP).

==Pedigree==

* Seattle Slew was inbred 4s x 4d to the stallion Nasrullah, meaning that Nasrullah appears twice in the fourth generation of his pedigree, once on the sire side and once on the dam side.

<doc id="465739" wikidata="Q3181141" url="?curid=465739" title="John Buchanan (Canadian politician)">
<text>John MacLennan Buchanan (April 22, 1931 – October 3, 2019) was a Canadian lawyer and former politician who served as the 20th premier of Nova Scotia from 1978 to 1990 and as a member of the Senate of Canada from 1990 to 2006.

==Early life==
Buchanan was born in Sydney, Nova Scotia, the son of Flora Isabel Campbell and Murdoch William Buchanan. He graduated from Mount Allison University in 1954 with a Bachelor of Science degree and a Certificate in Engineering. He then went on to study at Dalhousie Law School and after graduating in 1958 entered the practice of law where he was appointed Queen&#x27;s Counsel in 1972 and awarded Doctorates from Nova Scotia Technical College, Mount Allison University, Saint Mary&#x27;s University, St. Francis Xavier University, and Université Saint Anne.

==Political career==
Buchanan was elected as a Member of the Nova Scotia Legislative Assembly in 1967, re-elected in 1970, 1974, 1978, 1981, 1984 and 1988. He was appointed to the Executive Council of Nova Scotia as Minister of Public Works and Fisheries in 1969. He was elected leader of the Progressive Conservative Party of Nova Scotia in 1971. Buchanan was elected as Premier of Nova Scotia in 1978. He was re-elected in 1981, 1984 and 1988, becoming the third Premier in Nova Scotia to be elected to four consecutive terms (following George Henry Murray and Robert Stanfield), and the fourth longest serving premier in the history of the province. On April 17, 1982, Buchanan was made a member of Her Majesty’s Privy Council. His biggest majority came in the 1984 election, when he led his party to victory, capturing 42 of the 52 seats in the legislature.
Buchanan resigned as Premier when he was appointed to the Senate of Canada by Brian Mulroney on September 12, 1990. Buchanan sat as a Progressive Conservative senator until 2004, when the party merged with the Canadian Alliance. He sat as a member of the Conservative Party of Canada from 2004 until his retirement at age 75 on April 22, 2006.

After Buchanan resigned as premier, it was revealed that he had secretly received $431,290 in funds in addition to his salary. A subsequent RCMP investigation concluded that there was no evidence to support criminal charges.

== Political views ==
In 1990, Buchanan stated that if Quebec were to secede from Canada, separating English-speaking Canada into two parts, the Atlantic provinces would be &quot;absurd&quot; to try to form their own country, and there would be &quot;no choice&quot; but to seek to join the United States. He retracted his statement after criticism. However, an American author, Donald Nuechterlein, similarly stated in 2001 that as the Maritime provinces require substantial transfer payments from Ottawa, they would not be a viable independent country. He speculated that they might combine, with or without Newfoundland, to make themselves more attractive for admission into the United States as a single state.

==Personal life==
He married Mavis Forsyth in September 1954, and they had five children. Buchanan died on October 3, 2019, at the age of 88.

<text>New Haven Harbor is an inlet on the north side of Long Island Sound in the state of Connecticut. Centered on the city of New Haven, the state&#x27;s third largest, it was carved by the retreat of the glaciers during the last ice age approximately 13,000 years ago.

The New Haven neighborhoods of City Point, Long Wharf, The Annex, and East Shore lie on the northern and eastern sides, with the city of West Haven on the west. The Quinnipiac and Mill rivers converge and empty into the inlet on its north end, and the West River joins at the west (also known as West Haven Harbor).

A peninsula, once known as &quot;Little Necke&quot; but since as Lighthouse Point after the light constructed on its tip in 1805, protects the harbor from the west. The original lighthouse was replaced in 1845 by the current Five Mile Point structure. It was replaced for navigation in 1877 by the offshore Southwest Ledge Light. Sperry Lighthouse (1899–1933) also served the harbor.

In July 1779, during the American Revolutionary War, the peninsula was the scene of an amphibious landing by British troops.

The harbor is crossed by U.S. Interstate-95 via the Pearl Harbor Memorial Bridge at the confluence of the Quinnipiac and mill rivers. It also can be traversed via the partially completed &quot;Harborside Greenway&quot; bicycle and pedestrian trail, which is part of the East Coast Greenway system.
