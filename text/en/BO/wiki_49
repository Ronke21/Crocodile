<text>Adenoviruses (members of the family Adenoviridae) are medium-sized (90–100 nm), nonenveloped (without an outer lipid bilayer) viruses with an icosahedral nucleocapsid containing a double-stranded DNA genome. Their name derives from their initial isolation from human adenoids in 1953.

They have a broad range of vertebrate hosts; in humans, more than 50 distinct adenoviral serotypes have been found to cause a wide range of illnesses, from mild respiratory infections in young children (known as the common cold) to life-threatening multi-organ disease in people with a weakened immune system.

==Virology==

=== Classification ===
This family contains the following genera:
* &quot;Atadenovirus&quot;
* &quot;Aviadenovirus&quot;
* &quot;Ichtadenovirus&quot;
* &quot;Mastadenovirus&quot; (including all human adenoviruses)
* &quot;Siadenovirus&quot;
* &quot;Testadenovirus&quot;

=== Diversity ===
In humans, currently there are 88 human adenoviruses (HAdVs) in seven species (Human adenovirus A to G):
* A: 12, 18, 31
* B: 3, 7, 11, 14, 16, 21, 34, 35, 50, 55
* C: 1, 2, 5, 6, 57
* D: 8, 9, 10, 13, 15, 17, 19, 20, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 32, 33, 36, 37, 38, 39, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 51, 53, 54, 56, 58, 59, 60, 62, 63, 64, 65, 67, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75
* E: 4
* F: 40, 41
* G: 52

Different types/serotypes are associated with different conditions:
* respiratory disease (mainly species HAdV-B and C)
* conjunctivitis (HAdV-B and D)
* gastroenteritis (HAdV-F types 40, 41, HAdV-G type 52)
* obesity or adipogenesis (HAdV-A type 31, HAdV-C type 5, HAdV-D types 9, 36, 37) 

All these types are called Human mastadenovirus A–G by the ICTV, because all are members of the genus &quot;Mastadenovirus&quot;.

=== Structure ===

Adenoviruses are medium-sized (90–100 nm). The virions are composed of one linear piece of double-stranded DNA inside an icosahedral capsid. 240 hexon proteins make up the bulk of the capsid, while twelve penton bases cap the icosahedron&#x27;s corners. The penton bases are associated with protruding fibers that aid in attachment to the host cell via the receptor on its surface.

In 2010, the structure of the human adenovirus was solved at the atomic level, making it the largest high-resolution model ever. The virus is composed of around 1 million amino acid residues and weighs around 150 MDa.

=== Genome ===

The adenovirus genome is linear, non-segmented double-stranded (ds) DNA that is between 26 and 48 kbp. This allows the virus to theoretically carry 22 to 40 genes. Although this is significantly larger than other viruses in its Baltimore group, it is still a very simple virus and is heavily reliant on the host cell for survival and replication. The genes of adenoviruses can generally be divided into well-conserved sets of transcription units with six early transcription units (E1A, E1B, E2A, E2B, E3 and E4) and one late transcription unit ranging from L1-L5. In addition, adenoviruses also contain two intermediate transcription units named XI and IVa2. To increase the viral gene economy, adenoviruses accommodate genes on both strands of its dsDNA meaning that most of its genome is utilized for coding proteins. An interesting feature of this viral genome is that it has a terminal 55 kDa protein associated with each of the 5&#x27; ends of the linear dsDNA. These are used as primers in viral replication and ensure that the ends of the virus&#x27; linear genome are adequately replicated.

=== Replication ===
Adenoviruses possess a linear dsDNA genome and are able to replicate in the nucleus of vertebrate cells using the host&#x27;s replication machinery. Entry of adenoviruses into the host cell involves two sets of interactions between the virus and the host cell. Most of the action occurs at the vertices. Entry into the host cell is initiated by the knob domain of the fiber protein binding to the cell receptor. The two currently established receptors are: CD46 for the group B human adenovirus serotypes and the coxsackievirus/adenovirus receptor (CAR) for all other serotypes. There are some reports suggesting MHC molecules and sialic acid residues functioning in this capacity as well. This is followed by a secondary interaction, where a motif in the penton base protein (see capsomere) interacts with an integrin molecule. It is the co-receptor interaction that stimulates entry of the adenovirus. This co-receptor molecule is αV integrin. Binding to αV integrin results in endocytosis of the virus particle via clathrin-coated pits. Attachment to αV integrin stimulates cell signaling and thus induces actin polymerization, which facilitates clathrin-mediated endocytosis, and results in virion&#x27;s entry into the host cell within an endosome.

Once the virus has successfully gained entry into the host cell, the endosome acidifies, which alters virus topology by causing capsid components to disband. The capsid is destabilized and protein VI, which is one of the capsid constituents (see Adenovirus genome) is released from it. Protein VI contains an N-terminal amphiphatic alpha-helix, a helical domain that exhibits both hydrophobic and hydrophilic properties. This amphipathic helix enables the binding of protein VI to the endsomal membrane leading to a severe membrane curvature that ultimately disrupts the endosome. These changes, as well as the toxic nature of the pentons, destroy the endosome, resulting in the movement of the virion into the cytoplasm. With the help of cellular microtubules, the virus is transported to the nuclear pore complex, whereby the adenovirus particle disassembles. Viral DNA is subsequently released, which can enter the nucleus via the nuclear pore. After this the DNA associates with histone molecules already present in the nucleus, which allows it to interact with the host cell transcription machinery. Then, viral gene expression can occur, without integrating the viral genome into host cell chromosomes, and new virus particles can be generated.

The adenovirus life cycle is separated by the DNA replication process into two phases: an early and a late phase. In both phases, a primary transcript that is alternatively spliced to generate monocistronic mRNAs compatible with the host&#x27;s ribosome is generated, allowing for the products to be translated.

The early genes are responsible for expressing mainly non-structural, regulatory proteins. The goal of these proteins is threefold: to alter the expression of host proteins that are necessary for DNA synthesis; to activate other virus genes (such as the virus-encoded DNA polymerase); and to avoid premature death of the infected cell by the host-immune defenses (blockage of apoptosis, blockage of interferon activity, and blockage of MHC class I translocation and expression).

Some adenoviruses under specialized conditions can transform cells using their early gene products. E1A (binds Retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein) has been found to immortalize primary cells &quot;in vitro&quot; allowing E1B (binds p53 tumor suppressor) to assist and stably transform the cells. Nevertheless, they are reliant upon each other to successfully transform the host cell and form tumors. E1A is mostly intrinsically disordered protein and contains CR3 domain which is critical for transcriptional activation.

DNA replication separates the early and late phases. Once the early genes have liberated adequate virus proteins, replication machinery, and replication substrates, replication of the adenovirus genome can occur. A terminal protein that is covalently bound to the 5&#x27; end of the adenovirus genome acts as a primer for replication. The viral DNA polymerase then uses a strand displacement mechanism, as opposed to the conventional Okazaki fragments used in mammalian DNA replication, to replicate the genome.

The late phase of the adenovirus lifecycle is focused on producing sufficient quantities of structural protein to pack all the genetic material produced by DNA replication. Once the viral components have successfully been replicated, the virus is assembled into its protein shells and released from the cell as a result of virally induced cell lysis.

=== Multiplicity reactivation ===
Adenovirus is capable of multiplicity reactivation (MR) (Yamamoto and Shimojo, 1971). MR is the process by which two, or more, virus genomes containing lethal damage interact within the infected cell to form a viable virus genome. Such MR was demonstrated for adenovirus 12 after virions were irradiated with UV light and allowed to undergo multiple infection of host cells. In a review, numerous examples of MR in different viruses were described, and it was suggested that MR is a common form of sexual interaction that provides the survival advantage of recombinational repair of genome damages.

== Epidemiology ==
=== Transmission ===
Adenoviruses are unusually stable to chemical or physical agents and adverse pH conditions, allowing for prolonged survival outside of the body and water. Adenoviruses are spread primarily via respiratory droplets, however they can also be spread by fecal routes and via aerosols (airborne transmission). Research into the molecular mechanisms underlying adenoviral transmission provide empirical evidence in support of the hypothesis that coxsackievirus/adenovirus receptors (CARs) are needed to transport adenoviruses into certain naive/progenitor cell types.

=== Humans ===

Humans infected with adenoviruses display a wide range of responses, from no symptoms at all to the severe infections typical of Adenovirus serotype 14.

=== Animals ===
Bat adenovirus TJM (Bt-AdV-TJM) is a novel species of the &quot;Mastadenovirus&quot; genus isolated from &quot;Myotis&quot; and &quot;Scotophilus kuhlii&quot; in China. It is most closely related to the tree shrew and canine AdVs.

Two types of canine adenoviruses are well known, type 1 and 2. Type 1 (CAdV-1) causes infectious canine hepatitis, a potentially fatal disease involving vasculitis and hepatitis. Type 1 infection can also cause respiratory and eye infections. CAdV-1 also affects foxes (&quot;Vulpes vulpes&quot; and &quot;Vulpes lagopus&quot;) and may cause hepatitis and encephalitis. &quot;Canine adenovirus 2&quot; (CAdV-2) is one of the potential causes of kennel cough. Core vaccines for dogs include attenuated live CAdV-2, which produces immunity to CAdV-1 and CAdV-2. CAdV-1 was initially used in a vaccine for dogs, but corneal edema was a common complication.

Squirrel adenovirus (SqAdV) is reported to cause enteritis in red squirrels in Europe, while gray squirrels seem to be resistant. SqAdV is most closely related to the adenovirus of guinea pigs (GpAdV).

Adenovirus in reptiles is poorly understood, but research is currently in progress.

Adenoviruses are also known to cause respiratory infections in horses, cattle, pigs, sheep, and goats. &quot;Equine adenovirus 1&quot; can also cause fatal disease in immunocompromised Arabian foals, involving pneumonia and destruction of pancreatic and salivary gland tissue. &quot;Tupaia adenovirus&quot; (TAV) (tree shrew adenovirus 1) has been isolated from tree shrews.

Otarine adenovirus 1 has been isolated from sea lions (&quot;Zalophus californianus&quot;).

The fowl adenoviruses are associated with many disease conditions in domestic fowl like &quot;inclusion body hepatitis&quot;, &quot;hydropericardium syndrome&quot;, &quot;Egg drop syndrome&quot;, &quot;Quail bronchitis&quot;, &quot;Gizzard erosions&quot; and many respiratory conditions. They have also been isolated from wild black kites (Milvus migrans).

Titi monkey adenovirus was isolated from a colony of monkeys.

== Prevention ==

Currently there is a vaccine for adenovirus type 4 and 7 for US military personnel only. US military personnel are the recipients of this vaccine because they may be at a higher risk of infection. The vaccine contains a live virus, which may be shed in stool and lead to transmission. The vaccine is not approved for use outside of the military, as it has not been tested in studied in the general population or on people with weakened immune systems.

In the past, US military recruits were vaccinated against two serotypes of adenovirus, with a corresponding decrease in illnesses caused by those serotypes. That vaccine is no longer manufactured. The U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command announced on 31 October 2011 that a new adenovirus vaccine, which replaces the older version that has been out of production for over a decade, was shipped to basic training sites on 18 October 2011.

Prevention of adenovirus, as well as other respiratory illnesses, involves frequent hand washing for more than 20 seconds, avoiding touching the eyes, face, and nose with unwashed hands, and avoiding close contact with people with symptomatic adenovirus infection. Those with symptomatic adenovirus infection are additionally advised to cough or sneeze into the arm or elbow instead of the hand, to avoid sharing cups and eating utensils, and to refrain from kissing others. Chlorination of swimming pools can prevent outbreaks of conjunctivitis caused by adenovirus.

== Diagnosis ==
Diagnosis is from symptoms and history. Tests are only necessary in very serious cases. Tests include blood tests, eyes, nose or throat swabs, stool sample tests, and chest x-rays. In the laboratory, adenovirus can be identified with antigen detection, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), virus isolation and serology. Even if adenovirus is found to be present, it may not be the cause of any symptoms. Some immunocompromised individuals can shed the virus for weeks and show no symptoms.

== Infections ==

Most infections with adenovirus result in infections of the upper respiratory tract. Adenovirus infections often present as conjunctivitis, tonsillitis (which may look exactly like strep throat and cannot be distinguished from strep except by throat culture), an ear infection, or croup. Adenoviruses types 40 and 41 can also cause gastroenteritis. A combination of conjunctivitis and tonsillitis is particularly common with adenovirus infections.

Some children (especially the youngest) can develop adenovirus bronchiolitis or pneumonia, both of which can be severe. In babies, adenoviruses can also cause coughing fits that look almost exactly like whooping cough. Adenoviruses can also cause viral meningitis or encephalitis. Rarely, adenovirus can cause hemorrhagic cystitis (inflammation of the urinary bladder—a form of urinary tract infection—with blood in the urine).

Most people recover from adenovirus infections by themselves, but people with immunodeficiency sometimes die of adenovirus infections, and—rarely—even previously healthy people can die of these infections. This may be because sometimes adenoviral infection can lead to cardiac disorders. For example, in one study, some cardiac samples of patients with dilated cardiomyopathy were positive for presence of adenovirus type 8.

Adenoviruses are often transmitted by expectoration (e.g. aerosols), but they can also be transmitted by contact with an infected person, or by virus particles left on objects such as towels and faucet handles. Some people with adenovirus gastroenteritis may shed the virus in their stools for months after getting over the symptoms. The virus can be passed through water in swimming pools that are not sufficiently chlorinated.

As with many other illnesses, good handwashing practice is one way to inhibit the person-to-person transmission of adenoviruses. Heat and bleach will kill adenoviruses on objects.

== Treatment ==
There are no proven antiviral drugs to treat adenoviral infections, so treatment is largely directed at the symptoms (such as acetaminophen for fever). The antiviral drug cidofovir has helped certain of those patients who had severe cases of illness; the number helped and to what degree, and the particular complications or symptoms it helped with, and when and where this happened, were not given in the source. A doctor may give antibiotic eyedrops for conjunctivitis, while awaiting results of bacterial cultures, and to help prevent secondary bacterial infections. Currently, there is no adenovirus vaccine available to the general public, but a vaccine is available for the United States military for Types 4 and 7.

== Use in gene therapy and vaccination ==

=== Gene therapy ===
Adenoviruses have long been a popular viral vector for gene therapy due to their ability to affect both replicating and non-replicating cells, accommodate large transgenes, and code for proteins without integrating genetic material into the host cell genome. More specifically, they are used as a vehicle to administer targeted therapy, in the form of recombinant DNA or protein. This therapy has been found especially useful in treating monogenic disease (e.g. cystic fibrosis, X-linked SCID, alpha1-antitrypsin deficiency) and cancer. In China, oncolytic adenovirus is an approved cancer treatment. Specific modifications on fiber proteins are used to target Adenovirus to certain cell types; a major effort is made to limit hepatotoxicity and prevent multiple organ failure. Adenovirus dodecahedron can qualify as a potent delivery platform for foreign antigens to human myeloid dendritic cells (MDC), and that it is efficiently presented by MDC to M1-specific CD8+ T lymphocytes.

A safety issue with adenoviruses is that they can cause an immune response with a related inflammatory response as occurred in the death of Jesse Gelsinger in 1999. To address this risk, the genome of the viral genes have been modified to remove some viral genes. One such modification is the gutless vector that removes almost all the viral genome.

Adenovirus has been used for delivery of CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing systems, but high immune reactivity to viral infection has posed challenges in use for patients.

=== Vaccines ===
Modified (recombinant) adenovirus vectors, including replication incompetent types, can deliver DNA coding for specific antigens.

Adenovirus have been used to produce viral vector COVID-19 vaccines. &quot;In four candidate COVID-19 vaccines... Ad5... serves as the &#x27;vector&#x27; to transport the surface protein gene of SARS-CoV-2&quot;. The goal is to genetically express the spike glycoprotein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). A replication-deficient chimpanzee adenovirus vaccine vector (ChAdOx1) is used by the Oxford–AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine that has been approved for use. The Janssen COVID-19 vaccine uses modified recombinant adenovirus type-26 (Ad26). Recombinant adenovirus type-5 (Ad5) are being used by Ad5-nCoV, ImmunityBio and UQ-CSL V451. The Gam-COVID-Vac (aka Sputnik-V) product is innovative because an Ad26 based vaccine is used on the first day and an Ad5 vaccine is used on day 21. Another one is &quot;ChAd-SARS-CoV-2-S&quot;; the vaccine reportedly prevented mice that were genetically modified to have human ACE2 (hACE2) receptors, presumably receptors that allow virus-entry into the cells, from being infected with SARS-CoV-2.

Possible issues with using Adenovirus as vaccine vectors include: the human body develops immunity to the vector itself, making subsequent booster shots difficult or impossible. In some cases, people have pre-existing immunity to Adenoviruses, making vector delivery ineffective.

====HIV infection concerns====

The use of Ad5 vaccines for COVID-19 worried researchers who had experience with two failed trials of an Ad5 vaccine, Phambili and STEP, due to the increased risk for uncircumcised male patients of contracting HIV-1 via unprotected anal sex. At the time, it was concluded that heightened risk of HIV reception may be observed for any Ad5-based vector vaccine. In October 2020, these researchers wrote in &quot;The Lancet&quot;: &quot;On the basis of these findings, we are concerned that use of an Ad5 vector for immunisation against SARS-CoV-2 could similarly increase the risk of HIV-1 acquisition among men who receive the vaccine.&quot; Vaccines using other technologies would not be affected, but Sputnik V, Convidecia and ImmunityBio&#x27;s hAd5 would. Two studies found that Ad5-specific CD4 T cells are more susceptible to HIV infection than CD4 T cells specific to certain other vectors, such as Cytomegalovirus and Canarypox.

By comparison, a &quot;Science&quot; article reported that China had approved CanSino&#x27;s Ebola vaccine based on an Ad5 vector. It was tested in Sierra Leone, which had high HIV prevalence, making it more likely for such problems to be detected. CanSino&#x27;s CEO said &quot;we haven&#x27;t seen anything with the Ebola vaccine&quot; and speculated that HIV susceptibility might be limited to Ad5 vaccines which produced HIV proteins. In research reported in &quot;The Lancet&quot; in May, the company&#x27;s researchers acknowledged the possibility, called it &quot;controversial&quot; and said they would watch for it in the company&#x27;s COVID-19 vaccine candidate&#x27;s trials. It is not known to what extent LGBT discrimination in Sierra Leone could have contributed to masking a possible causal link in the Ebola vaccine trial; while the Step trial enrolled mainly homosexual and bisexual men, the Phambili trial enrolled mainly heterosexual men and women and still found an apparent connection.

<doc id="455653" wikidata="Q1483" url="?curid=455653" title="Craniopagus parasiticus">
<text>Craniopagus parasiticus is an extremely rare type of parasitic twinning occurring in about 4 to 6 of 10,000,000 births. In craniopagus parasiticus, a parasitic twin head with an undeveloped body is attached to the head of a developed twin. Fewer than a dozen cases of this type of conjoined twin have been documented in literature.

==Development==

The exact development of craniopagus parasiticus is not well known. However, it is known that the underdeveloped twin is a parasitic twin. Parasitic twins are known to occur &quot;in utero&quot; when monozygotic twins start to develop as an embryo, but the embryo fails to completely split. When this happens, one embryo will dominate development, while the other&#x27;s development is severely altered. The key difference between a parasitic twin and conjoined twins is that in parasitic twins, one twin, the parasite, stops development during gestation, whereas the other twin, the autosite, develops completely.

In normal monozygotic twin development, one egg is fertilized by a single sperm. The egg will then completely split into two, normally at the two-cell stage. If the egg splits in the early blastocyst stage, two inner cell masses will be present, eventually leading to the twins sharing the same chorion and placenta, but with separate amnions. However, the egg can split into two, but still have one blastocyst. This will lead to one inner cell mass and one blastocyst. Then, as the twins develop, they will share the same placenta, chorion, and amnion. This is thought to be the most likely reason why conjoined twins occur, and could possibly play a role in the development of craniopagus parasiticus.

One hypothesis is that craniopagus parasiticus starts with the development of two fetuses from a single zygote that fail to separate at the head region around the second week of gestation. Another is that it occurs later in development, around the fourth week of gestation, at which time the two embryos fuse together near the anterior open neuropore.

A third hypothesis is that there is joining of the somatic and placental vascular system of the twins, as well as a degeneration of the umbilical cord of the parasitic twin. This suggests that craniopagus parasiticus develops due to the lack of blood supply to one of the twins.

==Diagnosis==
===Related conditions===
In addition to craniopagus parasiticus, a few other conditions involve a child&#x27;s, or animal&#x27;s, birth with two heads or faces.

====Dicephalic parapagus====
Dicephalic parapagus is a condition where two heads are side by side on a single torso, with varying degrees of twinning of organs and structures within the torso.

====Diprosopus====
Diprosopus occurs when a single body and neck are present, but there is a duplication of the structures of the face. This is different from craniopagus parasiticus in that there is only one head, although there is a duplication of the craniofacial features. Diprosopus can range from having two fully formed faces to just a duplication of the nose or eyes. Cats with the condition are referred to as &#x27;Janus cats&#x27;. A cat named Frankenlouie was a famous example noted by the &quot;Guinness Book of World Records&quot; in 2012 for being the longest surviving Janus cat.

==Treatment==
Few individuals survive until birth. For those who do, the only treatment available is to surgically remove the parasitic twin. Of the two documented attempts, however, one child died within hours and neither reached their second birthday. The problem with surgical intervention is that the arterial supplies of the head are so intertwined that it is very hard to control the bleeding, but it has been suggested that cutting off the parasitic twin&#x27;s arterial supply might improve the odds of the developed twin&#x27;s survival.

==Prevalence==
There have been at least eighty reported cases of craniopagus parasiticus. Only ten cases of craniopagus have been documented in medical research literature.

==Notable cases==
Only four cases have been documented by modern medicine to have survived birth:

* The first case on record is that of the so-called &quot;Two-Headed Boy of Bengal&quot;, who was born in 1783 at the village of Mandal Ghat in the New Jalpaiguri district in what is now the Indian state of West Bengal and died of a cobra bite in 1787. His skull remains in the collection of the University of Glasgow Hunterian.
* On December 10, 2003, Rebeca Martínez was born in the Dominican Republic. She was the first baby born with the condition to undergo an operation to remove the second head. She died on February 7, 2004, after an 11-hour operation.
* On March 30, 2004, Manar Maged was born. On February 19, 2005, 10-month-old Manar underwent a successful 13-hour surgery in Egypt. The underdeveloped conjoined twin, Islaam, was attached to Manar&#x27;s head and was facing upward. Islaam could blink and even smile, but doctors determined she had to be removed, and that she could not survive on her own. Manar was featured on an episode of &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot; and in the British documentary series &quot;Body Shock&quot;. Manar died on March 26, 2006, fourteen months after the surgery, just days before her second birthday, due to a severe infection in her brain.
* On January 20, 2021, a baby was born at the Elias Hospital in Bucharest, Romania, but died some hours after being born.

==Terminology==
In the past, the use of terminology when describing parasitic twins has been somewhat inconsistent. By definition, a parasitic twin is joined to another twin in a certain anatomical location or position on the developed twin&#x27;s body. The underdeveloped twin is termed the parasite, and the developed twin is termed the autosite. The autosite can have some abnormalities, as well. For the most part, however, they have developed enough that they can live on their own.

<text>La Fortaleza (English: &quot;the fortress&quot;), also known as the &quot;Palacio de Santa Catalina&quot; (Saint Catherine&#x27;s Palace), is the official residence and workplace of the governor of Puerto Rico. Located in the historical quarter of Old San Juan in the capital municipality of San Juan, it has served as the governor’s residence since the 16th century, making it the oldest executive mansion in continuous use in the New World. Built from 1533 to 1540 by orders of King Charles I of Spain, the structure was the first fortification constructed by the Spanish on San Juan Islet to defend San Juan Bay, the harbor of Old San Juan. &quot;La fortaleza&quot;, alongside El Morro, San Cristóbal, El Cañuelo, and other forts part of the Walls of Old San Juan, protected strategically and militarily important Puerto Rico, or &quot;La Llave de las Indias&quot; (The Key to the Indies), from invasion by competing world powers and harassment by privateers and pirates during the Age of Sail. It was designated a World Heritage Site in 1983.

Situated in the western end of San Juan Islet in the Old San Juan historic quarter, La Fortaleza, seat of the executive branch, is about from the Capitol of Puerto Rico, seat of the legislative branch, in the middle of the Islet in the Puerta de Tierra historic district, and from the Supreme Court Building, seat of the judicial branch, in the eastern end of the Islet in Puerta de Tierra. 

==The structure==
&quot;La Fortaleza&quot; was the first defensive fortification built in the historic city of Old San Juan, originally known as &quot;Ciudad de Puerto Rico&quot; (&quot;rich port city&quot;), and the first of a series of military structures built to protect the city, which included the Castillo San Felipe del Morro and the Fort San Cristóbal. The construction was authorized by Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor as a defense against attacks from Island Caribs and the European powers of the time.

Initially, the structure consisted of four walls enclosing an interior patio with a circular tower known as the &quot;Homage Tower&quot;. From the top of the tower, following military tradition, the governor would take fidelity oaths at critical moments to the King and Queen of Spain. Later, a second tower named the &quot;Austral Tower&quot; was constructed.

During the 1640 reconstruction, a chapel named after Santa Catalina Alejandría originally standing outside the fortification&#x27;s walls was integrated into the structure&#x27;s walls, resulting in the alternate name of &quot;Palacio de Santa Catalina&quot; (&quot;Saint Catherine&#x27;s Palace&quot;)&quot;.&quot;

The complex currently consists of a few attached buildings with formal living quarters on the second floor and private quarters on the third. It overlooks the high city walls that front the bay, and within the north perimeter of the house are sheltered gardens and a swimming pool.

==History==
Starting in 1529, Governor La Gama petitioned the emperor on the need to build defensive fortifications &quot;because the island&#x27;s defenseless condition caused the people to emigrate.&quot; Construction started in 1533, using stone, and concluded by 1540. Yet the fort had no guns, and Gonzalo Fernández de Oviedo y Valdés commented, &quot;if it had been constructed by blind men could not have been located in a worse location.&quot; Yet the structure has served as the governor&#x27;s residence since 1544.

Since the 16th century, &quot;La Fortaleza&quot; has acted as the residence of the Governor of Puerto Rico, making it the oldest executive mansion in continuous use in the Americas. The mansion was remodeled in 1846 by the Spanish authorities to adapt its military origin to its new purely administrative function.

&quot;La Fortaleza&quot; has been captured three times by foreign powers:
* 1598, George Clifford, Earl of Cumberland, attacked San Juan.
* In 1625, General Boudewijn Hendricksz (Balduino Enrico) of the Netherlands invaded the city and established himself at &quot;La Fortaleza&quot;. During the Dutch retreat, the fortress and the city were set ablaze.
* 1898, the U.S. Navy invaded and occupied Puerto Rico, establishing a provisional government.

In 1834, Colonel George Dawson Flinter described the fortress of Santa Catalina as having a chapel, stables, cistern, and an east wing with spacious apartments.

According to tradition, in 1898, just before the United States invaded Puerto Rico during the Spanish–American War, the last Spanish governor of the island, Ricardo De Ortega, struck a longcase clock in &quot;La Fortaleza&quot; with his sword, stopping the clock and marking the time at which Spain lost control over Puerto Rico.

On October 30, 1950, there was an attempt by a few nationalists to enter &quot;La Fortaleza&quot; in what is known as the San Juan Nationalist revolt, intending to attack then-governor Luis Muñoz Marín. The 5-minute shootout resulted in four Nationalists dead: Domingo Hiraldo Resto, Carlos Hiraldo Resto, Manuel Torres Medina, and Raímundo Díaz Pacheco. Three of the guards of the building, among them Lorenzo Ramos, were seriously injured.

On October 9, 1960, &quot;La Fortaleza&quot; was designated a United States National Historic Landmark. Teodoro Vidal, a cultural affairs official under Luis Muñoz Marín, organized renovation work on the building around this time.

In 1983, &quot;La Fortaleza&quot;, along with the San Juan National Historic Site, was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. 

== Trivia ==


&quot;La Fortaleza&quot; has two towers: the Astral Tower and the Homenaje Tower (Homage Tower), which show that it was originally a military structure.

The &quot;Homage Tower&quot; houses the &quot;Santa Catalina Chapel&quot;, where a colorful mosaic of 95,000 pieces in honor of the Holy Trinity stands out.

In 1956, when an area covered with a panel was unsealed, what could be the old kitch&quot;en of La Fortaleza&quot; was discovered in the &quot;Austral Tower&quot;.

The paintings exhibited at &quot;La Fortaleza&quot; are on loan from the &quot;Institute of Puerto Rican Historical Culture&quot; and are changed according to the taste of the ruler of the day.

Originally, &quot;La Fortaleza&quot; was painted salmon red, the characteristic color of the island&#x27;s military installations of the time of Spanish colony. Its wooden doors were green and its columns were painted white with gold details.

U.S. Presidents who have visited &quot;La Fortaleza&quot;, include Herbert Hoover in 1931, Harry S. Truman in 1948, John F. Kennedy in 1961, Barack Obama in 2011, and Bill Clinton in 2013.

&quot;La Fortaleza&quot; has had 156 governors: 124 under the Spanish regime, 19 under the U.S. regime and 13 Puerto Ricans, 11 elected, one appointed by the President of the United States Jesús T. Piñero and one sworn in by the Constitution of Puerto Rico Wanda Vázquez Garced.

Three flags fly over &quot;La Fortaleza&quot;: the Puerto Rican flag, the American flag, and the Governor&#x27;s white flag. When the white flag is not raised, it is because the governor is outside the &quot;Santa Catalina Palace&quot;.

The &quot;Hundido Garden&quot; was named Doña Inés Garden in honor of Doña Inés Mendoza, wife of former governor Luis Muñoz Marín, because that was her favorite spot at &quot;La Fortaleza&quot;, where she lived for 16 years.

==In literature==
In 2011, Puerto Rican author Giannina Braschi wrote the dramatic novel &quot;United States of Banana&quot;, featuring climactic scenes of revolution at La Fortaleza.

<doc id="455660" wikidata="Q5630384" url="?curid=455660" title="HMAS Ipswich (J186)">
<text>HMAS &quot;Ipswich&quot; (J186/B244/A118), named for the city of Ipswich, Queensland, was one of 60 s built during World War II and one of 20 built on Admiralty order but manned by personnel of and later commissioned into the Royal Australian Navy (RAN).

&quot;Ipswich&quot; was later operated by the Royal Netherlands Navy (RNLN) as HNLMS &quot;Morotai, and by the [[Indonesian Navy]] (TNI-AL) asKRI &quot;Hang Tuah. In Indonesian service in 1958 the ship was attacked by a CIA aircraft and sunk with considerable loss of life.

==Design and construction==

In 1938, the Australian Commonwealth Naval Board (ACNB) identified the need for a general purpose &#x27;local defence vessel&#x27; capable of both anti-submarine and mine-warfare duties, while easy to construct and operate. The vessel was initially envisaged as having a displacement of approximately 500 tons, a speed of at least , and a range of The opportunity to build a prototype in the place of a cancelled saw the proposed design increased to a 680-ton vessel, with a top speed, and a range of , armed with a gun, equipped with asdic, and able to fitted with either depth charges or minesweeping equipment depending on the planned operations: although closer in size to a sloop than a local defence vessel, the resulting increased capabilities were accepted due to advantages over British-designed mine warfare and anti-submarine vessels. Construction of the prototype did not go ahead, but the plans were retained. The need for locally built &#x27;all-rounder&#x27; vessels at the start of World War II saw the &quot;Australian Minesweepers&quot; (designated as such to hide their anti-submarine capability, but popularly referred to as &quot;corvettes&quot;) approved in September 1939, with 60 constructed during the course of the war: 36 ordered by the RAN, 20 (including &quot;Ipswich&quot;) ordered by the British Admiralty but manned and commissioned as RAN vessels, and 4 for the Royal Indian Navy.

&quot;Ipswich&quot; was laid down by Evans Deakin &amp; Co at Brisbane in Queensland on 6 March 1941. She was launched on 11 August 1941 by Evelyn Foll, wife of the Minister for the Interior Harry Foll, and commissioned on 13 June 1942.

==Operational history==

===RAN===
&quot;Ipswich&quot; was employed from commissioning until 3 November 1942 as a convoy escort in Australian waters. From 3 November 1942 until 21 January 1945, &quot;Ipswich&quot; was assigned to the British Eastern Fleet, primarily serving in the Indian Ocean and Persian Gulf, but spending May to October 1943 in the Mediterranean. During this time, &quot;Ipswich&quot; was credited with shooting down a twin-engined bomber near Syracuse on 25 July 1943, and on 11 February 1944 worked with and to sink the .

Upon leaving the British Eastern Fleet, &quot;Ipswich&quot; returned to Australia, where she was assigned to the British Pacific Fleet. &quot;Ipswich&quot; was present in Tokyo Bay on Victory over Japan Day (2 September 1945), when the Japanese Instrument of Surrender was signed.

&quot;Ipswich&quot; earned five battle honours for her wartime service: &quot;Pacific 1942&quot;, &quot;Indian Ocean 1942–45&quot;, &quot;Sicily 1943&quot;, &quot;East Indies 1944&quot;, and &quot;Okinawa 1945&quot;.

===RNLN===
&quot;Ipswich&quot; paid off from RAN service on 5 July 1946 and was transferred to the Royal Netherlands Navy and renamed HNLMS &quot;Morotai&quot;.

===TNI-AL===
&quot;Morotai&quot; was transferred to the Indonesian Navy in 1949 and renamed KRI &quot;Hang Tuah&quot;. On 28 April 1958 a Douglas B-26 Invader aircraft, painted black and showing no markings, bombed and sank her off Balikpapan in southern Borneo. 18 crew were killed and another 28 were wounded.

The B-26&#x27;s co-pilot was Colonel Muharto of the Permesta rebel movement&#x27;s AUREV insurgent air force but the aircraft, its ammunition and pilot were supplied by the CIA as part of an insurgency to destabilise President Sukarno&#x27;s government. The pilot was William H. Beale, a former United States Army Air Forces lieutenant colonel then employed by a Taiwan-based CIA front organisation, Civil Air Transport.

<text>Clark Brian Howard (born June 20, 1955) is an American author and radio/podcast host, focused primarily on personal finance, consumer protection, and related topics. He has hosted &quot;The Clark Howard Show,&quot; which began in 1989 and has lasted over 30 years as of 2021.

==Life and career==
Clark Howard grew up in Atlanta, Georgia. His parents, Bernard and Joy Garson Howard, were prominent members of Atlanta&#x27;s Jewish community. Howard has three children, born in 1988, 1999, and 2005.

Howard&#x27;s first career was in the travel agency business. Howard attended The Westminster Schools in Atlanta before graduating from the American University in 1976 with a Bachelor of Arts in Urban Government. He went on to receive his Master of Business Administration degree from Central Michigan University in 1977. During the Carter administration, Clark established his travel agency, which grew into a successful enterprise with multiple branches. Eventually, the business attracted the attention of a major financial firm, which expressed interest in acquiring it. In 1987, he retired to Florida for several years after the travel agency was purchased, before returning to his home state of Georgia. 

During his travels between Georgia and Florida, he was approached by a radio station to give travel advice to listeners. Not long afterward, he began giving travel advice in guest appearances on Atlanta radio. In 1991, Howard also became a consumer affairs TV reporter for WSB-TV. In 1993, he founded the Consumer Action Center to have volunteers answer consumer questions off the air. Howard&#x27;s website followed in 1997, and in 1998 his radio show went into syndication. Howard&#x27;s program advises listeners to &quot;save more, spend less, and avoid getting ripped off.&quot; The Clark Howard Show was heard every day on more than 200 radio stations throughout North America, and aired from News/Talk WSB, WSB AM/WSBB FM in Atlanta. He is a frequent consumer expert guest on other talk, variety, and news programs.
Howard explained on air that he was joining the Georgia State Defense Force (an unarmed, non-federal branch of the Georgia Department of Defense) following the September 11 attacks. He attended monthly training workshops around the state as part of his service, and performed medical evacuation work in New Orleans following Hurricane Katrina.

In 2009, Howard announced he was diagnosed with prostate cancer. He gave a public announcement on WSB-TV on February 18, 2009. He gave another update three months later on his website.

In August 2017, Howard described how he escaped a car backing towards him at a parking lot, by jumping into the air.

His daily two-hour radio show was syndicated by Westwood One until the end of 2020. That year Howard retired the daily radio show, but maintained a shorter daily podcast and made regular appearances on WSB. 

===Other appearances===
From 2012 to 2013, Howard was a co-host of HLN&#x27;s &quot;Evening Express&quot;, a daily news and lifestyle roundup that aired weeknights.

Several years earlier, in 2009, Howard hosted a weekend program on HLN. The format was similar to Howard&#x27;s radio show, in that the host gives advice to callers and provides tips on saving money. In 2012, he became one of several anchors on the daily HLN show &quot;Evening Express,&quot; which aired from 5 to 7:00pm ET. Howard has also appeared elsewhere on HLN such as on &quot;Morning Express with Robin Meade&quot;.

Howard continues to regularly appear on WSB-TV in Atlanta, which is occasionally broadcast by other Cox Television stations nationwide. His TV appearances offer consumer scam warnings and consumer tips. 

He started several civic programs in the community, such as Atlanta Volunteer Action, Volunteer Action, Inc., The Big Buddy Program, and Career Action.

With help from his listeners, Howard began teaming up with Habitat for Humanity in 1996 to build houses around the Atlanta area. The year 2010 marked the 15th-anniversary build and &quot;Team Clark&quot; completed its 39th house together. In 2013, he built his 50th home for Atlanta Habitat for Humanity. In 2018, Team Clark completed its 75th Habitat home.

In 2001, Howard created the WSB Radio Care-A-Thon which raises funds each July for the AFLAC Cancer and Blood Disorders Center at Children&#x27;s Healthcare of Atlanta.

===Author===
Howard is the author of several books on consumer tips and bargains. His most recent book: &quot;Clark Howard&#x27;s Living Large for the Long Haul: Consumer-Tested Ways to Overhaul Your Finances, Increase Your Savings, and Get Your Life Back on Track&quot; contains tips to help navigate the economics of life in the US. Other books include his 2011 title &quot;Living Large in Lean Times&quot;. This book features 250+ ways to &quot;save more, spend less, and avoid rip-offs.&quot; Other books include &quot;Clark Smart Real Estate&quot; (2006), &quot;Clark Smart Parents, Clark Smart Kids&quot; (2005), &quot;Clark&#x27;s Big Book of Bargains&quot; (2003) and &quot;Get Clark Smart: The Ultimate Guide to Getting Rich From America&#x27;s Money-Saving Expert&quot; (2002). Howard&#x27;s &quot;Get Clark Smart&quot; made it to No. 6 on &quot;The New York Times&quot; &quot;Best Seller&quot; list for &quot;How-To Books.&quot; And his &quot;Big Book of Bargains&quot; made it to No. 7 and No. 11 on &quot;The New York Times&quot; &quot;Best Seller&quot; list for &quot;Business Books&quot;.

==Honors==
In 2011, a Golden Palm Star on the Palm Springs, California, Walk of Stars was dedicated to him. In 2015, Howard was voted into the National Radio Hall of Fame, to be inducted November 5. In 2016 he was a recipient of the &quot;Good and Faithful Servant Award&quot; from the Peachtree Christian Hospice.

<text>The African wattled lapwing (Vanellus senegallus), also known as the Senegal wattled plover or simply wattled lapwing, is a large lapwing, a group of largish waders in the family Charadriidae. It is a resident breeder in most of sub-Saharan Africa outside the rainforests, although it has seasonal movements.

These are conspicuous and unmistakable birds. They are large brown waders with a black crown, white forehead and large yellow facial wattles. The tail is white, tipped black, and the long legs are yellow.

In flight, the upperwings have black flight feathers and brown coverts separated by a white bar. The underwings are white with black flight feathers. The African wattled lapwing has a loud &quot;peep-peep&quot; call.

This species is a common breeder in wet lowland habitats, especially damp grassland. It often feeds in drier habitats, such as golf courses, picking insects and other invertebrates from the ground. It lays three or four eggs on a ground scrape.

The African wattled lapwing is one of the species to which the &quot;Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds&quot; (AEWA) applies.

<text>HMS &quot;J1 (laterHMAS &quot;J1) was a J-class submarine operated by the Royal Navy and the Royal Australian Navy.

==Design and construction==

The J class was designed by the Royal Navy in response to reported German submarines with surface speeds over . They had a displacement of 1,210 tons surfaced, and 1,820 tons submerged. Each submarine was in length overall, with a beam of , and a draught of . The propulsion system was built around three propeller shafts; the J-class were the only triple-screwed submarines ever built by the British. Propulsion came from three 12-cylinder diesel motors when on the surface, and electric motors when submerged. Top speed was on the surface (the fastest submarines in the world at the time of construction), and underwater. Range was at .

Armament consisted of six 18-inch (450 mm) torpedo tubes (four forward, one on each beam), plus a 4-inch deck gun. Originally, the gun was mounted on a breastwork fitted forward of the conning tower, but the breastwork was later extended to the bow and merged into the hull for streamlining, and the gun was relocated to a platform fitted to the front of the conning tower. 44 personnel were aboard.

&quot;J1&quot; was built by HM Dockyard at Portsmouth in Hampshire, and launched on 6 November 1915.

==Service history==

&quot;J1&quot; operated in patrols in the North Sea. In November 1916, a German force of half a destroyer flotilla, three dreadnoughts, and a battlecruiser set out from port to rescue two submarines and that were stranded in fog off Jutland. On the return, having only rescued one of the submarines, the force passed &quot;J1&quot; off Horns Reef on 5 November 1916. Two of the dreadnoughts, and , were torpedoed by &quot;J1&quot;, earning her commanding officer, Commander N. F. Laurence, a Bar for his Distinguished Service Order. The dreadnoughts did not sink, but reached port and underwent repairs.

The submarine was later transferred to Gibraltar for operations in the Mediterranean. On 9 November 1918, during an engagement with , &quot;J1&quot; launched a depth charge from a specially fitted launcher.
After the war, the British Admiralty decided that the best way to protect the Pacific region was with a force of submarines and cruisers. To this end, they offered the six surviving submarines of the J class to the Royal Australian Navy as gifts. &quot;J1&quot; and her sisters were commissioned into the RAN in April 1919, and sailed for Australia on 9 April, in the company of the cruisers and , and the tender . The flotilla reached Thursday Island on 29 June, and Sydney on 10 July. Because of the submarines&#x27; condition after the long voyage, they were immediately taken out of service for refits.

&quot;J1&quot; and &quot;J4&quot;, plus &quot;Platypus&quot;, sailed on 10 February 1920 for Geelong, where a submarine base was established. Apart from local exercises and a 1921 visit to Tasmania, the submarines saw little use, and by June 1922, the cost of maintaining the boats and deteriorating economic conditions saw the six submarines decommissioned and marked for disposal.

==Fate==
The submarine was paid off on 12 July 1922. &quot;J1&quot; was sold to the Melbourne Salvage Company on 26 February 1924. The hulk was scuttled in the ship graveyard off Port Phillip Heads at on 26 May 1926. The J1 wreck, also known as &quot;38 Metre Sub&quot;, &quot;135 Foot Sub&quot;, or &quot;New Sub&quot;, is submerged in of water, and is accessible by experienced divers.

<doc id="455672" wikidata="Q1520130" url="?curid=455672" title="Color theory">
<text>Color theory, or more specifically traditional color theory, is a historical body of knowledge describing the behavior of colors, namely in color mixing, color contrast effects, color harmony, color schemes and color symbolism. Modern color theory is generally referred to as color science. While there is no clear distinction in scope, traditional color theory tends to be more subjective and have artistic applications, while color science tends to be more objective and have functional applications, such as in chemistry, astronomy or color reproduction. Color theory dates back at least as far as Aristotle&#x27;s treatise &quot;On Colors&quot;. A formalization of &quot;color theory&quot; began in the 18th century, initially within a partisan controversy over Isaac Newton&#x27;s theory of color (&quot;Opticks&quot;, 1704) and the nature of primary colors. By the end of the 19th century, a schism had formed between traditional color theory and color science.

== History ==

Color theory is rooted in antiquity, with early musings on color in Aristotle&#x27;s (d. 322 BCE) &quot;On Colors&quot; and Claudius Ptolemy&#x27;s (d. 168 CE) &quot;Optics&quot;. The influence of light on color was investigated and revealed further by al-Kindi (d. 873) and Ibn al-Haytham (d. 1039). Ibn Sina (d. 1037), Nasir al-Din al-Tusi (d. 1274), and Robert Grosseteste (d. 1253) discovered that contrary to the teachings of Aristotle, there are multiple color paths to get from black to white. More modern approaches to color theory principles can be found in the writings of Leone Battista Alberti (c. 1435) and the notebooks of Leonardo da Vinci (c. 1490).

The RYB primary colors became the foundation of 18th-century theories of color vision, as the fundamental sensory qualities that are blended in the perception of all physical colors, and conversely, in the physical mixture of pigments or dyes. These theories were enhanced by 18th-century investigations of a variety of purely psychological color effects, in particular the contrast between &quot;complementary&quot; or opposing hues that are produced by color afterimages and in the contrasting shadows in colored light. These ideas and many personal color observations were summarized in two founding documents in color theory: the &quot;Theory of Colours&quot; (1810) by the German poet Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, and &quot;The Law of Simultaneous Color Contrast&quot; (1839) by the French industrial chemist Michel Eugène Chevreul. Charles Hayter published &quot;A New Practical Treatise on the Three Primitive Colours Assumed as a Perfect System of Rudimentary Information&quot; (London 1826), in which he described how all colors could be obtained from just three.
Subsequently, German and English scientists established in the late 19th century that color perception is best described in terms of a different set of primary colors—red, green and blue-violet (RGB)—modeled through the additive mixture of three monochromatic lights. Subsequent research anchored these primary colors in the differing responses to light by three types of color receptors or &quot;cones&quot; in the retina (trichromacy). On this basis the quantitative description of the color mixture or colorimetry developed in the early 20th century, along with a series of increasingly sophisticated models of color space and color perception, such as the opponent process theory.

Across the same period, industrial chemistry radically expanded the color range of lightfast synthetic pigments, allowing for substantially improved saturation in color mixtures of dyes, paints, and inks. It also created the dyes and chemical processes necessary for color photography. As a result, three-color printing became aesthetically and economically feasible in mass printed media, and the artists&#x27; color theory was adapted to primary colors most effective in inks or photographic dyes: cyan, magenta, and yellow (CMY). (In printing, dark colors are supplemented by black ink, called &quot;key,&quot; to make the CMYK system; in both printing and photography, white is provided by the color of the paper.) These CMY primary colors were reconciled with the RGB primaries, and subtractive color mixing with additive color mixing, by defining the CMY primaries as substances that &quot;absorbed&quot; only one of the retinal primary colors: cyan absorbs only red (−R+G+B), magenta only green (+R−G+B), and yellow only blue-violet (+R+G−B). It is important to add that the CMYK, or process, color printing is meant as an economical way of producing a wide range of colors for printing, but is deficient in reproducing certain colors, notably orange and slightly deficient in reproducing purples. A wider range of colors can be obtained with the addition of other colors to the printing process, such as in Pantone&#x27;s Hexachrome printing ink system (six colors), among others.

For much of the 19th century artistic color theory either lagged behind scientific understanding or was augmented by science books written for the lay public, in particular &quot;Modern Chromatics&quot; (1879) by the American physicist Ogden Rood, and early color atlases developed by Albert Munsell (&quot;Munsell Book of Color&quot;, 1915, see Munsell color system) and Wilhelm Ostwald (Color Atlas, 1919). Major advances were made in the early 20th century by artists teaching or associated with the German Bauhaus, in particular Wassily Kandinsky, Johannes Itten, Faber Birren and Josef Albers, whose writings mix speculation with an empirical or demonstration-based study of color design principles.

== Color mixing ==

One of the earliest purposes of color theory was to establish rules governing the mixing of pigments.

Traditional color theory was built around &quot;pure&quot; or ideal colors, characterized by different sensory experiences rather than attributes of the physical world. This has led to several inaccuracies in traditional color theory principles that are not always remedied in modern formulations. Another issue has been the tendency to describe color effects holistically or categorically, for example as a contrast between &quot;yellow&quot; and &quot;blue&quot; conceived as generic colors instead of the three color attributes generally considered by color science: hue, colorfulness and lightness. These confusions are partly historical and arose in scientific uncertainty about color perception that was not resolved until the late 19th century when artistic notions were already entrenched. They also arise from the attempt to describe the highly contextual and flexible behavior of color perception in terms of abstract color sensations that can be generated equivalently by any visual media.

=== Primary colors ===

Color theory asserts three pure primary colors that can be used to mix all possible colors. These are sometimes considered as red, yellow and blue (RYB) or as red, green and blue (RGB). Ostensibly, any failure of specific paints or inks to match this ideal performance is due to the impurity or imperfection of the colorants. In contrast, modern color science does not recognize universal primary colors (no finite combination of colors can produce all other colors) and only uses primary colors to define a given color space. Any three primary colors can mix only a limited range of colors, called a gamut, which is always smaller (contains fewer colors) than the full range of colors humans can perceive. Primary colors also can&#x27;t be made from other colors as they are inherently pure and distinct.

=== Complementary colors ===

For the mixing of colored light, Isaac Newton&#x27;s color wheel is often used to describe complementary colors, which are colors that cancel each other&#x27;s hue to produce an achromatic (white, gray or black) light mixture. Newton offered as a conjecture that colors exactly opposite one another on the hue circle cancel out each other&#x27;s hue; this concept was demonstrated more thoroughly in the 19th century. An example of complementary colors would be magenta and green.

A key assumption in Newton&#x27;s hue circle was that the &quot;fiery&quot; or maximum saturated hues are located on the outer circumference of the circle, while achromatic white is at the center. Then the saturation of the mixture of two spectral hues was predicted by the straight line between them; the mixture of three colors was predicted by the &quot;center of gravity&quot; or centroid of three triangle points, and so on.

According to traditional color theory based on subtractive primary colors and the RYB color model, yellow mixed with purple, orange mixed with blue, or red mixed with green produces an equivalent gray and are the painter&#x27;s complementary colors.

One reason the artist&#x27;s primary colors work at all is due to the imperfect pigments being used have sloped absorption curves and change color with concentration. A pigment that is pure red at high concentrations can behave more like magenta at low concentrations. This allows it to make purples that would otherwise be impossible. Likewise, a blue that is ultramarine at high concentrations appears cyan at low concentrations, allowing it to be used to mix green. Chromium red pigments can appear orange, and then yellow, as the concentration is reduced. It is even possible to mix very low concentrations of the blue mentioned and the chromium red to get a greenish color. This works much better with oil colors than it does with watercolors and dyes.

The old primaries depend on sloped absorption curves and pigment leakages to work, while newer scientifically derived ones depend solely on controlling the amount of absorption in certain parts of the spectrum.

=== Tints and shades ===
When mixing pigments, a color is produced which is always darker and lower in chroma, or saturation, than the parent colors. This moves the mixed color toward a neutral color—a gray or near-black. Lights are made brighter or dimmer by adjusting their brightness, or energy level; in painting, lightness is adjusted through mixture with white, black, or a color&#x27;s complement.

It is common among some painters to darken a paint color by adding black paint—producing colors called &quot;shades&quot;—or lighten a color by adding white—producing colors called &quot;tints&quot;. However, it is not always the best way for representational painting, as an unfortunate result is for colors to also shift in hue. For instance, darkening a color by adding black can cause colors such as yellows, reds, and oranges, to shift toward the greenish or bluish part of the spectrum. Lightening a color by adding white can cause a shift towards blue when mixed with reds and oranges. Another practice when darkening a color is to use its opposite, or complementary, color (e.g. purplish-red added to yellowish-green) to neutralize it without a shift in hue and darken it if the additive color is darker than the parent color. When lightening a color this hue shift can be corrected with the addition of a small amount of an adjacent color to bring the hue of the mixture back in line with the parent color (e.g. adding a small amount of orange to a mixture of red and white will correct the tendency of this mixture to shift slightly towards the blue end of the spectrum).

=== Split primary palette ===

The split-primary palette is a color-wheel model that relies on misconceptions to attempt to explain the unsatisfactory results produced when mixing the traditional primary colors, red, yellow, and blue.

Painters have long considered red, yellow, and blue to be primary colors. In practice, however, some of the mixtures produced from these colors lack chromatic intensity. Rather than adopt a more effective set of primary colors, proponents of split-primary theory explain this lack of chroma by the purported presence of impurities, small amounts of other colors in the paints, or biases away from the ideal primary toward one or the other of the adjacent colors. Every red paint, for example, is said to be tainted with, or biased toward, either blue or yellow, every blue paint toward either red or green, and every yellow toward either green or orange. These biases are said to result in mixtures that contain sets of complementary colors, darkening the resulting color. To obtain vivid mixed colors, according to split-primary theory, it is necessary to employ two primary colors whose biases both fall in the direction, on the color wheel, of the color to be mixed, combining, for example, green-biased blue and green-biased yellow to make bright green. Based on this reasoning, proponents of split-primary theory conclude that two versions of each primary color, often called &quot;cool&quot; and &quot;warm,&quot; are needed in order to mix a wide gamut of high-chroma colors.

In fact, the perceived bias of colors is not due to impurity. Rather, the appearance of any given colorant is inherent to its chemical and physical properties, and its purity unrelated to whether it conforms to our arbitrary conception of an ideal hue. Moreover, the identity of gamut-optimizing primary colors is determined by the physiology of human color vision. Although no set of three primary paints can be mixed to obtain the complete color gamut perceived by humans, red, yellow, and blue are a poor choice if high-chroma mixtures are desired. This is because painting is a subtractive color process, for which red and blue are secondary, not primary, colors.

Although flawed in principle, the split-primary system can be successful in practice, because the recommended blue-biased red and green-biased blue positions are often filled by near approximations of magenta and cyan, respectively, while orange-biased red and violet-biased blue serve as secondary colors, tending to further widen the mixable gamut.

This system is in effect a simplified version of Newton&#x27;s geometrical rule that colors closer together on the hue circle will produce more vibrant mixtures. A mixture produced from two primary colors, however, will be much more highly saturated than one produced from two secondary colors, even though the pairs are the same distance apart on the hue circle, revealing the limitations of the circular model in the prediction of color-mixing results. For example, a mixture of magenta and cyan inks or paints will produce vivid blues and violets, whereas a mixture of red and blue inks or paints will produce darkened violets and purples, even though the angular distance separating magenta and cyan is the same as that separating red and blue.

== Color contrast ==

In Chevreul&#x27;s 1839 book &quot;The principles of harmony and contrast of colours&quot;, he introduced the law of color contrast, stating that colors that appear together (spatially or temporally) will be altered as if mixed with the complementary color of the other color, functionally boosting the color contrast between them. For example, a piece of yellow fabric placed on a blue background will appear tinted orange because orange is the complementary color to blue. Chevreul formalized three types of contrast:
* &quot;simultaneous contrast&quot;, which appears in two colors viewed side by side,
* &quot;successive contrast&quot;, for the afterimage left on an achromatic background after viewing a color, and
* &quot;mixed contrast&quot;, for the afterimage left on another color.

=== Warm vs. cool colors ===

The distinction between &quot;warm&quot; and &quot;cool&quot; colors has been important since at least the late 18th century. The difference (as traced by etymologies in the Oxford English Dictionary), seems related to the observed contrast in landscape light, between the &quot;warm&quot; colors associated with daylight or sunset, and the &quot;cool&quot; colors associated with a gray or overcast day. Warm colors are often said to be hues from red through yellow, browns, and tans included; cool colors are often said to be the hues from blue-green through blue violet, most grays included. There is a historical disagreement about the colors that anchor the polarity, but 19th-century sources put the peak contrast between red-orange and greenish-blue.

Color theory has described perceptual and psychological effects to this contrast. Warm colors are said to advance or appear more active in a painting, while cool colors tend to recede; used in interior design or fashion, warm colors are said to arouse or stimulate the viewer, while cool colors calm and relax. Most of these effects, to the extent they are real, can be attributed to the higher saturation and lighter value of warm pigments in contrast to cool pigments; brown is a dark, unsaturated warm color that few people think of as visually active or psychologically arousing.

== Color harmony and color schemes ==

It has been suggested that &quot;Colors seen together to produce a pleasing affective response are said to be in harmony&quot;. However, color harmony is a complex notion because human responses to color are both affective and cognitive, involving emotional response and judgment. Hence, our responses to color and the notion of color harmony is open to the influence of a range of different factors. These factors include individual differences (such as age, gender, personal preference, affective state, etc.) as well as cultural, sub-cultural, and socially-based differences which gives rise to conditioning and learned responses about color. In addition, context always has an influence on responses about color and the notion of color harmony, and this concept is also influenced by temporal factors (such as changing trends) and perceptual factors (such as simultaneous contrast) which may impinge on human response to color. The following conceptual model illustrates this 21st-century approach to color harmony:

: formula_1

wherein color harmony is a function (&quot;f&quot;) of the interaction between color/s (Col 1, 2, 3, …, &quot;n&quot;) and the factors that influence positive aesthetic response to color: individual differences (&quot;ID&quot;) such as age, gender, personality and affective state; cultural experiences (&quot;CE&quot;), the prevailing context (&quot;CX&quot;) which includes setting and ambient lighting; intervening perceptual effects (&quot;P&quot;) and the effects of time (&quot;T&quot;) in terms of prevailing social trends.

In addition, given that humans can perceive around 2.3 million different colors, it has been suggested that the number of possible color combinations is virtually infinite thereby implying that predictive color harmony formulae are fundamentally unsound. Despite this, many color theorists have devised formulae, principles or guidelines for color combination with the aim being to predict or specify positive aesthetic response or &quot;color harmony&quot;.

Color wheel models have often been used as a basis for color combination guidelines and for defining relationships between colors. Some theorists and artists believe juxtapositions of complementary color will produce strong contrast, a sense of visual tension as well as &quot;color harmony&quot;; while others believe juxtapositions of analogous colors will elicit a positive aesthetic response. Color combination guidelines (or formulas) suggest that colors next to each other on the color wheel model (analogous colors) tend to produce a single-hued or monochromatic color experience and some theorists also refer to these as &quot;simple harmonies&quot;.

In addition, split complementary color schemes usually depict a modified complementary pair, with instead of the &quot;true&quot; second color being chosen, a range of analogous hues around it are chosen, i.e. the split complements of red are blue-green and yellow-green. A triadic color scheme adopts any three colors approximately equidistant around a color wheel model. Feisner and Mahnke are among a number of authors who provide color combination guidelines in greater detail.
Color combination formulae and principles may provide some guidance but have limited practical application. This is due to the influence of contextual, perceptual, and temporal factors which will influence how color/s are perceived in any given situation, setting, or context. Such formulae and principles may be useful in fashion, interior and graphic design, but much depends on the tastes, lifestyle, and cultural norms of the viewer or consumer.

Black and white have long been known to combine &quot;well&quot; with almost any other colors; black decreases the apparent &quot;saturation&quot; or &quot;brightness&quot; of colors paired with it and white shows off all hues to equal effect.

== Color symbolism ==

A major underpinning of traditional color theory is that colors carry significant cultural symbolism, or even have immutable, universal meaning. As early as the ancient Greek philosophers, many theorists have devised color associations and linked particular connotative meanings to specific colors. However, connotative color associations and color symbolism tends to be culture-bound and may also vary across different contexts and circumstances. For example, red has many different connotative and symbolic meanings from exciting, arousing, sensual, romantic, and feminine; to a symbol of good luck; and also acts as a signal of danger. Such color associations tend to be learned and do not necessarily hold irrespective of individual and cultural differences or contextual, temporal or perceptual factors. It is important to note that while color symbolism and color associations exist, their existence does not provide evidential support for color psychology or claims that color has therapeutic properties.

<doc id="455674" wikidata="Q8047831" url="?curid=455674" title="Yamaichi Securities">
<text>was a Japanese securities trading firm. The company announced it would cease operations on November 24, 1997 and was declared bankrupt by the Tokyo District Court on June 2, 1999.

== History ==
Yamaichi, formed in 1897, was at one time one of the four major Japanese brokerages. Its clients were major Japanese corporations.

In the boom of the 1980s it was given specified sums of money by 10 of its clients to invest as it saw fit. A sharp downturn in the early 1990s and poor dealings by Yamaichi generated losses of more than 200 billion yen. Fearing the demise of the firm through loss of reputation that would result if the scale of losses became known, the brokerage shouldered the loss of its clients, and moved it off balance sheet.

Yamaichi sold in a private placement Touchwood Pacific Partners limited partnership to about 50 Japanese institutional or private investors in the amount of $191 million in 1990 for The Walt Disney Company film production.

=== &quot;Tobashi&quot; and collapse ===
In January 1992, Yamaichi executives resorted to such a &quot;tobashi&quot; scheme, setting up a separate company called Yamaichi Enterprise which opened an account at the Tokyo branch of Zürich, Switzerland-based Credit Suisse. Depositing ¥200 billion in Japanese government bonds, the Yamaichi subsidiary then used the dummy companies to generate profits for clients while eventually absorbing losses of ¥158.3 billion. A separate scheme using foreign currency bonds resulted in losses of ¥106.5 billion being hidden in Yamaichi&#x27;s Australian subsidiary.

The magazine &quot;Weekly Toyo Keizai&quot; uncovered the fraud in April 1997. For its journalism the magazine was awarded the Editors&#x27; Choice Magazine Journalism Award.

Tsugio Yukihira, chairman of the brokerage at the time of its collapse, acknowledged in front of a Japanese Diet hearing that the activities were illegal. He said that only three people at the brokerage, namely himself former President Atsuo Miki and another individual, knew about the arrangements; he declined to name the 10 firms involved in the illegal trading. The company announced it would cease operations on November 24, 1997 and was declared bankrupt by the Tokyo District Court on June 2, 1999.

The company&#x27;s last president, Shohei Nozawa made a tearful public apology on Japanese television. Japan&#x27;s Minister of Finance announced that steps would be taken to ensure the event would not further destabilize the frail Japanese banking system and economy as a whole. On June 1, 2001, the company&#x27;s last chairman, Tsugio Yukihira, settled a lawsuit filed in Tokyo District Court. Suitors alleged his window-dressing tobashi schemes and illegal dealings had undermined the brokerage and led to its demise.

<text>HMS &quot;J2 (laterHMAS &quot;J2) was a J-class submarine operated by the Royal Navy and the Royal Australian Navy.

==Design and construction==

The J class was designed by the Royal Navy in response to reported German submarines with surface speeds over . They had a displacement of 1,210 tons surfaced, and 1,820 tons submerged. Each submarine was in length overall, with a beam of , and a draught of . The propulsion system was built around three propeller shafts; the J-class were the only triple-screwed submarines ever built by the British. Propulsion came from three 12-cylinder diesel motors when on the surface, and electric motors when submerged. Top speed was on the surface (the fastest submarines in the world at the time of construction), and underwater. Range was at .

Armament consisted of six 18-inch (450 mm) torpedo tubes (four forward, one on each beam), plus a 4-inch deck gun. Originally, the gun was mounted on a breastwork fitted forward of the conning tower, but the breastwork was later extended to the bow and merged into the hull for streamlining, and the gun was relocated to a platform fitted to the front of the conning tower. 44 personnel were aboard.

&quot;J2&quot; was built for the Royal Navy by HM Dockyard at Portsmouth in Hampshire and launched on 6 November 1915.

==Operational history==
&quot;J2&quot; torpedoed and sank the German submarine between the Orkney Islands and Norway on 7 July 1917.

After the war, the British Admiralty decided that the best way to protect the Pacific region was with a force of submarines and cruisers. To this end, they offered the six surviving submarines of the J-class to the Royal Australian Navy as gifts. &quot;J1&quot; and her sisters were commissioned into the RAN in April 1919, and sailed for Australia on 9 April, in the company of the cruisers and , and the tender . The flotilla reached Thursday Island on 29 June, and Sydney on 10 July. Because of the submarines&#x27; condition after the long voyage, they were immediately taken out of service for refits.

Apart from local exercises and a 1921 visit to Tasmania, the submarines saw little use, and by June 1922, the cost of maintaining the boats and deteriorating economic conditions saw the six submarines decommissioned and marked for disposal.

==Fate==
The submarine was paid off on 12 July 1922. &quot;J2&quot; was sold on 26 February 1924. She was scuttled in the ship graveyard off Port Phillip Heads at .

The J2 wreck, also known as &quot;39 Metre Sub&quot;, &quot;130 Foot Sub&quot;, &quot;Broken Sub&quot; or &quot;Deep Sub&quot;, is submerged in of water. The wreck lies on its keel running north–south with its bow pointing out to sea. During its scuttling the bow section broke off, exposing the forward torpedoes tubes and bow modifications. The wreck is accessible by experienced divers, but it is the deepest and most difficult of the four J-class submarine wrecks in the area.

<doc id="455682" wikidata="Q60670" url="?curid=455682" title="Polar regions of Earth">
<text>The polar regions, also called the frigid [[geographical zone|zones]] or polar zones, of Earth are Earth&#x27;s polar ice caps, the regions of the planet that surround its geographical poles (the North and South Poles), lying within the polar circles. These high latitudes are dominated by floating sea ice covering much of the Arctic Ocean in the north, and by the Antarctic ice sheet on the continent of Antarctica and the Southern Ocean in the south.

==Definitions==
The Arctic has various definitions, including the region north of the Arctic Circle (currently Epoch 2010 at 66°33&#x27;44&quot; N), or just the region north of 60° north latitude, or the region from the North Pole south to the timberline. The Antarctic is usually defined simply as south of 60° south latitude, or the continent of Antarctica. The 1959 Antarctic Treaty uses the former definition.

The two polar regions are distinguished from the other two climatic and biometric belts of Earth, a tropics belt near the equator, and two middle latitude regions located between the tropics and &quot;polar regions&quot;.

==Climate==

Polar regions receive less intense solar radiation than the other parts of Earth because the Sun&#x27;s energy arrives at an oblique angle, spreading over a larger area, being less concentrated, and also travels a longer distance through the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere in which it may be absorbed, scattered or reflected, which is the same thing that causes winters to be colder than the rest of the year except in tropical regions.

The axial tilt of the Earth has the most effect on climate of the polar regions due to its latitude. However, since the polar regions are the farthest from the equator, they receive the weakest solar radiation and are therefore generally frigid year round due to the earth&#x27;s axial tilt of 23.5° not being enough to create a high maximum midday declination to sufficiently compensate the Sun&#x27;s rays for the high latitude even in summer, except for relatively brief periods in peripheral areas near the polar circles. The large amount of ice and snow also reflects and weakens of what weak sunlight the polar regions receive further, contributing to the cold. Polar regions are characterized by extremely cold temperatures, heavy glaciation wherever there is sufficient precipitation to form permanent ice, short and still cold summers, and extreme variations in daylight hours, with twenty-four hours of daylight in summer, and complete darkness at mid-winter.

==Circumpolar Arctic region==
There are many settlements in Earth&#x27;s north polar region. Countries with claims to Arctic regions are: the United States (Alaska), Canada (Yukon, the Northwest Territories and Nunavut), Denmark (Greenland), Norway, Finland, Sweden, Iceland, and Russia. Arctic circumpolar populations, though small, often share more in common with each other than with other populations within their national boundaries. As such, the northern polar region is diverse in human settlements and cultures.

==Antarctica and the Southern sea==
The southern polar region has no permanent human habitation as of now. McMurdo Station is the largest research station in Antarctica, run by the United States. Other notable stations include Palmer Station and Amundsen–Scott South Pole Station (United States), Esperanza Base and Marambio Base (Argentina), Scott Base (New Zealand), and Vostok Station (Russia).

While there are no indigenous human cultures, there is a complex ecosystem, especially along Antarctica&#x27;s coastal zones. Coastal upwelling provides abundant nutrients that feed krill, a type of marine Crustacea, which in turn feed a complex of living creatures from penguins to blue whales.

<text>HMS &quot;J5 (laterHMAS &quot;J5) was a First World War J class submarine operated by the Royal Navy and the Royal Australian Navy.

==Design and construction==

The J class was designed by the Royal Navy in response to reported German submarines with surface speeds over . They had a displacement of 1,210 tons surfaced, and 1,820 tons submerged. Each submarine was in length overall, with a beam of , and a draught of . The propulsion system was built around three propeller shafts; the J-class were the only triple-screwed submarines ever built by the British. Propulsion came from three 12-cylinder diesel motors when on the surface, and electric motors when submerged. Top speed was on the surface (the fastest submarines in the world at the time of construction), and underwater. Range was at .

Armament consisted of six 18 inch (450 mm) torpedo tubes (four forward, one on each beam), plus a 4-inch deck gun. Originally, the gun was mounted on a breastwork fitted forward of the conning tower, but the breastwork was later extended to the bow and merged into the hull for streamlining, and the gun was relocated to a platform fitted to the front of the conning tower. 44 personnel were aboard.

&quot;J5&quot; was built for the Royal Navy by HM Dockyard at Devonport in Plymouth. &quot;J5&quot; was launched on 9 September 1915 and commissioned on 6 May 1916.

==Operational history==
She and the other J&#x27;s were members of the 11th Submarine Flotilla. She served in the North Sea chiefly in operations against German destroyers and U-boats, most of encounters were with the latter. Although engaging several times with enemies, the closest she got to sinking the enemy was striking &quot;U-86&quot; with a torpedo which did not explode.

After the war, the British Admiralty decided that the best way to protect the Pacific region was with a force of submarines and cruisers. To this end, they offered the six surviving submarines of the J-class to the Royal Australian Navy as gifts. &quot;J1&quot; and her sisters were commissioned into the RAN in April 1919, and sailed for Australia on 9 April, in the company of the cruisers and , and the tender . &quot;J5&quot; broke down while traversing the Red Sea, and had to be towed the rest of the way by &quot;Brisbane&quot;. The flotilla reached Thursday Island on 29 June, and Sydney on 10 July. Because of the submarines&#x27; condition after the long voyage, they were immediately taken out of service for refits.

Apart from local exercises and a 1921 visit to Tasmania, the submarines saw little use, and by June 1922, the cost of maintaining the boats and deteriorating economic conditions saw the six submarines decommissioned and marked for disposal.

==Fate==
&quot;J5&quot; was paid off on 12 July 1922. She was sold on 26 February 1924 and after stripping, she, &quot;J1&quot;, and &quot;J2&quot; were scuttled in the ship graveyard off Port Phillip Heads on 4 June 1926.

The wreck of &quot;J5&quot; lies in of water at and can be accessed by experienced divers.

<text>The black-headed lapwing or black-headed plover (Vanellus tectus) is a large lapwing, a group of largish waders in the family Charadriidae. It is a resident breeder across sub-Saharan Africa from Senegal to Ethiopia, although it has seasonal movements. It lays two or three eggs on a ground scrape.

These are conspicuous and unmistakable birds. They are medium-large waders with a black head other than a white forehead, lower face and bands across the rear head and nape. There is a wispy black crest like northern lapwing and the bill and legs are red. The tail is white, tipped black.

In flight, the black-headed lapwing&#x27;s upperwings have black flight feathers and brown coverts separated by a white bar. The underwings are white with black flight feathers.

This species is a common breeder in wet lowland habitats close to water. It often feeds in drier habitats, such as golf courses and grassy scrub, picking insects and other invertebrates from the ground.

The black-headed lapwing has a metallic &quot;tink-tink&quot; call.

==Taxonomy==
The black-headed lapwing was described by the French polymath Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon in 1781 in his &quot;Histoire Naturelle des Oiseaux&quot; from a specimen collected in Senegal. The bird was also illustrated in a hand-coloured plate engraved by François-Nicolas Martinet in the &quot;Planches Enluminées D&#x27;Histoire Naturelle&quot; which was produced under the supervision of Edme-Louis Daubenton to accompany Buffon&#x27;s text. Neither the plate caption nor Buffon&#x27;s description included a scientific name but in 1783 the Dutch naturalist Pieter Boddaert coined the binomial name &quot;Charadrius tectus&quot; in his catalogue of the &quot;Planches Enluminées&quot;. The black-headed lapwing is now placed in the genus &quot;Vanellus&quot; that was erected by the French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson in 1760. The generic name &quot;Vanellus&quot; is the Medieval Latin for a &quot;lapwing&quot;. It is a diminutive of the Latin &quot;vanus&quot; meaning &quot;winnowing&quot; or &quot;fan&quot;. The specific epithet &quot;tectus&quot; is Latin for &quot;covered&quot; (i.e. blackcrowned).

Two subspecies are recognised:
* &quot;V. t. tectus&quot; (Boddaert, 1783) – southwest Mauritania to Ethiopia south to Ivory Coast and Uganda
* &quot;V. t. latifrons&quot; (Reichenow, 1881) – south Somalia to east Kenya

<doc id="455686" wikidata="Q1643" url="?curid=455686" title="Taguig">
<text>Taguig (), officially the City of Taguig (), is the fifth-most populous city in the Philippines situated in eastern shores of Metro Manila, the national capital region. It is a center for culture, finance, technology, entertainment and media, academics, and the arts and fashion. The city hosts several embassies, making it an important center for the country&#x27;s international diplomacy. As the home of Bonifacio Global City, major multinational corporations have their headquarters in the city, and it has the fourth largest skyline in the Philippines, with 289 high-rises, 80 of which exceed .

Taguig is located alongside the northwestern shores of Laguna de Bay, and is situated in the southeastern portion of Metro Manila. The city covers about and it is bordered by Pasig and Pateros to the north, Makati and Mandaluyong to the northwest, Pasay and Parañaque to the west, Taytay, Rizal to the northeast and Muntinlupa to the south.

Taguig was once a hamlet during the Spanish colonial period, Pateros become a visita of Taguig from 1742 until it become a separate municipality in 1815. During the American colonial period, large swaths of the city became a military reservation, and the town was merged with the municipalities of Pateros and Muntinlupa at some point until the 2 municipality becomes independent from it. Redevelopment of the military reservation spearheaded by the Bases Conversion and Development Authority (BCDA) in the 1990s established Taguig as a center of finance and commerce in the Philippines, with the establishment of districts such as Bonifacio Global City (BGC), McKinley Hill, and the Bonifacio Capital District. Taguig became a highly urbanized city with the passage of Republic Act No. 8487 in 2004, which was ratified by a plebiscite.

==Etymology==
The name of the city was derived from &quot;taga-giik&quot;, the Tagalog word for rice threshers. In the 1570s, the male citizens of the town which numbered to about 800 were good at threshing rice after harvest. Hence, they were referred to as &quot;&quot;mga taga-giik&quot; and the settlement as &quot;pook ng mga taga-giik&quot;&quot; (). Spanish friar Fray Alonso de Alvarado, together with conquistador Ruy López de Villalobos who crossed the Pasig River to reach the city&#x27;s present site in 1571, found &quot;taga-giik&quot; difficult to pronounce. &quot;Tagui-ig&quot; was later shortened to its current form &quot;Taguig&quot;.

== History ==

=== Early history ===

Before the Spaniards came, Taguig was a stablished Tagalog settlement with Moro and Chinese present in the area as revealed by the recent archaeological diggings of various artifacts like cups, plates and other utensils, which bear Chinese characters. This was believed to have originated from China&#x27;s Ming dynasty. Duck culture was practiced by the Tagalogs, particularly in the areas where the city and the Municipality of Pateros stands today.

===Spanish rule (1571-1898)===

Taguig was one of the earliest known territories of the Provincia de Tondo, that became the Provincia de Maynila to have been Christianized when the Spaniards succeeded in subjugating mainland Luzon through the Legazpi expedition in 1571. Between the years 1573 and 1587, Taguig was an encomienda under Captain Cervantes y Vergara with 3,200 inhabitants paying 1,879 and 1/2 tax. On September 4, 1584, Melchor De Ribera of the Augustian Order became the 1st non-resident Vicar of Taguig. Taguig was established as a separate &quot;pueblo&quot; (town) on April 4, 1587, &quot;Tomamos de nuevo la casa de Tagui&quot;, when the Augustinian Order reaccepted the vote of the convent of Taguig during a meeting of the Augustinian Chapter in Intramuros according to Friar Gaspar de San Agustin. This is after the local Chinese community burned the old church made out of Sawali in 1586. Juan Basi, a nephew of Lakan Dula and son-in-law of the Sultan of Brunei, was the Lakan of Taguig from 1587 to 1588 who participated in the Tondo Conspiracy of 1587, an attempt to overthrow the Spanish government which failed. Basi was exiled for two years as punishment. According to records, Taguig had nine barrios then, namely: Bagumbayan, Bambang, Hagonoy (Hagunoy), Palingon (Palingong), Santa Ana, Tipas, Tuktukan (Toctocan), Ususan, and Wawa (Uaua). Santa Ana was then the municipal center (&quot;poblacion&quot;) of Taguig.

There was an attempt to transfers Tipas from Taguig to Pasig because the residents of that barrio dislike the Cura or Parish Priest stationed at Taguig during that time. They raised it to the Gobernadorcillo (Leader and Judge) at that time, he said for the issue to be resolve the bells from Taguig and Pasig will be ring simultaneously. Which of these bells should be heard in Tipas will be town where it belongs to. The Bells of Taguig prevailed, that&#x27;s why Tipas remained to be within the Jurisdiction of Taguig. Records also shows that Tipas had several attempts petitioning to become an independent town but was denied during the Spanish and American governments.

During that time, Taguig was accessible via the Pasig River, which was connected to two large bodies of water, Manila Bay and Laguna de Bay. The town produced more than enough rice for consumption but had less sugar cane to mill. The men lived through fishing while women wove cotton cloth and &quot;sawali&quot; from bamboo strips. The people of Taguig were known to have resisted both Spanish and American colonial rule. When the Katipunan was on its early years, many from Taguig became followers and later joined the uprising. The people of Taguig also joined the revolutionary government of General Emilio Aguinaldo on August 6, 1898.

Santiago Bonifacio, the father of revolutionary Andres Bonifacio, hailed from Ligid Tipas. Barrio Tipas, specifically the Napindan Lighthouse in Barrio Napindan became a meeting place and staging point of some revolutionary attacks against Spanish forces by the Katipunan.

====Attempted transfer of town center====
In the 1880 up to 1919, flood water submerged almost all the lower portion of Taguig from Napindan to Bagumbayan during the months of August up to October. The Hacenderos of Maysapan and Taguig proposed to transfer the Town center and church to a higher place now part of Fort Bonifacio. The parish priest also supported the move and ordered to ready a parcel of land to be ready to build a new church to house the convent. However, since the local population of Taguig, during that time, are farmers and fishermen, the decision to move the town center and church was not that popular to them. They didn&#x27;t want to move out away from their farmland and to the river leading them to the bay. The remnant of the church is still visible until the 1970s. The place was called &quot;Bahay Pari&quot; (Priest House).

===American rule (1898-1946)===
During the American occupation, Taguig natives fought against the forces of General Wheaton under the command of General Pio del Pilar. It was recorded that on February 6, 1899, Filipino forces including Taguig &quot;revolutionarios&quot; dislodged an American position in the hills of Taguig, now a portion of Pateros and Fort Bonifacio. They were defeated eventually by the Americans with superiority in the armaments and training. Taguig finally fell to the contingent of the First Washington Volunteer Infantry led by Col. Wholly.

The defeat of the Filipinos after two years of struggle against the American forces subsequently subjected the Philippines to another system of governance. On August 14, 1898, United States occupied the islands and established a military government with General Wesley Merritt as the First Military Governor. He exercised legislative powers until September 1, 1900. At the start of American occupation, Taguig was proclaimed as an independent municipality with the promulgation of General Order No. 4 on March 29, 1900. The town was subsequently incorporated to the newly created province of Rizal when the Philippine Commission promulgated Act No. 137 on June 11, 1901.

On October 12, 1903, Taguig, Muntinlupa and Pateros were merged by the virtue of Act. No. 942 to be known as the Municipality of Pateros, with Pateros hosting the seat of the municipal government. The merger did not last long as a month later Muntinlupa was separated from it and made part of Biñan, La Laguna when Act. No. 1008 was enacted on November 25, 1903. By this time, the Municipality of Pateros comprised the territory of Pateros and Taguig. Muntinlupa was later reintegrated to the Municipality of Pateros on March 22, 1905, with the promulgation Act No. 1308. The Act also renamed the Municipality of Pateros into the Municipality of Taguig, and the seat of government was transferred from Pateros to Taguig. Eventually, Pateros separated from Taguig by January 1, 1909, and Muntinlupa was granted an independent municipality status on December 17, 1917.

It was also during the American Colonial Period that the United States government acquired a property of Taguig for military purposes. This large piece of land, which had a TCT dated 1902, was turned into a camp that became known as Fort William McKinley, named after the 25th president of the U.S. who was responsible for the American colonization of the Philippines.

When the Japanese occupied the Philippines in 1942, Fort McKinley was taken over by the Japanese Imperial Army. Fort McKinley was renamed as &quot;Sakura Heiei&quot; (Cherry Blossom Barracks) and became one of their most important installation and expanded its network of tunnels which served as shelter of the high military officials. They occupied the military camp until the end of World War II in 1945.

===Post-war period (1945-1986)===
After the Philippines gained its political independence from the United States on July 4, 1946, the US relinquished to the Republic of the Philippines all right of possession, jurisdiction, supervision and control over the Philippine territory except the use of the military bases. On May 14, 1949, Fort William McKinley was turned over to the Philippine government by virtue of the US Embassy Note No. 0570. Fort McKinley was made the permanent headquarters of the Philippine Army in 1957 and was subsequently renamed Fort Bonifacio after the Father of the Philippine Revolution against Spain, Andres Bonifacio. By virtue of Executive Order No. 311 signed by President Carlos P. Garcia on August 1, 1958, the municipal seat of government was transferred from Santa Ana to Tuktukan.

When President Ferdinand Marcos placed the Philippines under martial law in 1972, Taguig, which contained Fort Bonifacio, became the host of two detention centers full of political prisoners - the Maximum Security Unit (where Senators Jose W. Diokno and Benigno Aquino Jr. were detained) and the Ipil Reception Center (sometimes called the Ipil Detention Center). A third facility, the Youth Rehabilitation Center (YRC), was still treated as part of Fort Bonifacio but was later turned into the Makati City Jail. These detention centers became infamous for the numerous human rights abuses of the Marcos dictatorship, including warrantless detention and torture. Ipil was the largest prison facility for political prisoners during martial law. Among the prisoners held there were some of the country&#x27;s leading academics, creative writers, journalists, and historians including Butch Dalisay, Ricky Lee, Bienvenido Lumbera, Jo Ann Maglipon, Ninotchka Rosca, Zeus Salazar, and William Henry Scott. After Fort Bonifacio was privatized, the area in which Ipil was located became the area near S&amp;R Membership Shopping - BGC and MC Home Depot, near 32nd Street and 8th Avenue in Bonifacio Global City.

In 1974, the name of Taguig&#x27;s political subdivisions was changed from &quot;barrios&quot; to &quot;barangays&quot; following the nationwide implementation of the Integrated Reorganization Plan (IRP) under Presidential Decree No. 557. The IRP increased Taguig&#x27;s administrative divisions to 18 barangays, namely: Bagong Tanyag, Bagumbayan, Bambang, Calzada Tipas, Hagonoy, Ibayo Tipas, Ligid Tipas, Lower Bicutan, Maharlika, Napindan, Palingon Tipas, Signal Village, Santa Ana, Tuktukan, Upper Bicutan, Ususan, Wawa, and Western Bicutan. On November 7, 1975, Taguig seceded from the province of Rizal to become part of the newly formed the National Capital Region through Presidential Decree No. 824.

===Late 20th and early 21st centuries (1986-present)===

In 1986, President Ferdinand Marcos issued Proclamation No. 2475, which transferred control of the Fort Bonifacio area to Makati and reserved the area for military personnel and their dependents. The Municipality of Taguig then contested the presidential proclamation, which resulted in a territorial dispute with Makati.

In 1998, Republic Act No. 8487 was enacted, pushing for the cityhood of Taguig. The resulting plebiscite on April 25, 1998, showed that the citizens were against the cityhood. A recent petition to the Supreme Court sought a recount of the plebiscite and on February 19, 2004, the Supreme Court ordered the Commission on Elections to conduct a recount. The recount showed that the majority of residents did want the municipality of Taguig to become a city, with 21,105 &quot;yes&quot; and 19,460 &quot;no&quot;. Subsequently, Taguig became a city on December 8, 2004.

In 2008, the Taguig City Council created ten new barangays – Central Bicutan, New Lower Bicutan, Fort Bonifacio, Katuparan, North Signal Village, South Signal Village, South Daanghari, North Daanghari, Pinagsama, San Miguel, and Tanyag – by virtue of City Ordinance Nos. 24–27, 57–61, 67–69, and 78, Series of 2008, carving them out from the initial 18 barangays. After a successful plebiscite in December 2008, the creation was approve, thus the number of barangays in the city was increased from 10 to 28.

In 2011, during 424th foundation day, Mayor Lani Cayetano took pride in calling the city a &quot;Probinsyudad&quot; (a portmanteau of Tagalog words of Spanish origin &quot;probinsya&quot; and &quot;syudad&quot;) because it is the only remaining city in Metro Manila which has the amenities of a highly urbanized city and of a province, what with its more than of lakeshore, with farmers, fishermen, old churches, a historic lighthouse, and with people whose virtue of &quot;pagtutulungan&quot; () is still very much alive. The word &quot;Probinsyudad&quot; was registered as the city&#x27;s trademark with the Intellectual Property Office of the Philippines (IPOPHL) in March 2024.

By the turn of the 21st century, former military reservations in the Fort Bonifacio area were developed by the Bases Conversion and Development Authority (BCDA) into central business districts and mixed-use townships. These give rise to one of the Philippines&#x27; leading financial centers, the Bonifacio Global City (BGC). The BCDA also developed other townships in Fort Bonifacio area such as the Bonifacio Capital District and the McKinley Hill. Other mixed-developments within the city include the Acacia Estate and Scala Estate by Vista Land in the central part of the city, and Arca South by Ayala Land in Western Bicutan. In February 2018, the Philippine Stock Exchange moved its corporate office from Makati to BGC.

In March 2020, the city recorded its first case of COVID-19, a lawyer who works at BGC and has a history abroad of travelling to Japan. The city&#x27;s response was widely regarded as successful, as it attained one of the lowest active cases per 100,000 population. It is also one of the local government units with the lowest case fatality rates in the country. Furthermore, the city focused on helping businesses when the economy reopens.

The decades-long territorial dispute with Makati was ruled with finality in favor of Taguig in April 2023. Bonifacio Global City and the surrounding ten Enlisted Men&#x27;s Barrios (EMBO) barangays were officially recognized as part of Taguig. Jurisdiction of the ten Embo barangays were transferred from Makati to Taguig later that year. Meanwhile, the Schools Division Office of Taguig City gained the management and administration of 14 Embo public elementary and high schools, including the Makati Science High School, starting January 1, 2024. On September 25, 2024, the Embo barangays were apportioned to the two legislative districts of Taguig and Pateros with the adaptation of the House Concurrent Resolution No. 37.

==Geography==

Taguig is located on the northwestern shores of Laguna de Bay, the largest lake in the Philippines. The city has a total area of . The city bordered by Pasig and Pateros to the north, Makati and Mandaluyong to the northwest, Pasay and Parañaque to the west, Taytay to the northeast, and Muntinlupa to the south. The Pasig River and its tributary, the Taguig River, run through the northern half of the city, while the Napindan River, another tributary of Pasig, forms the natural border between Taguig in Pasig. A relatively small area of the city called Ibayo Napindan is located north of the river, adjoining the disputed territories between Pasig, Taguig, and Taytay in Rizal Province. The cadastral map of Taguig shows that the northeastern border of the city is in Rio del Pueblo now called Tapayan River, a tributary of the Pasig River from Barangay Pinagbuhatan, Pasig to Barangay Santa Ana, Taytay, Rizal. The map shows that the city encompasses much of Nagpayong in Pinagbuhatan, Pasig and Lupang Arenda in Taytay.

===Barangays and congressional districts===
Taguig is politically subdivided into 38 barangays, ranking it fourth in NCR with the most number of barangays. These barangays are currently grouped into two congressional districts, with each district being represented by a congressman in the House of Representatives. The ten Embo barangays are the latest addition to its jurisdiction after the city won against its territorial dispute with Makati, increasing the city&#x27;s territory and population. On September 25, 2024, the House of Representatives adopted House Concurrent Resolution No. 37, which apportioned the ten Embo barangays to the two legislative districts of Taguig and Pateros.
* Taguig–Pateros&#x27;s Lone Congressional District (District I) covers the eastern half of the city, including the entirety of the Municipality of Pateros. The district covers an area of and includes the barangays of Bagumbayan, Bambang, Calzada, Comembo, Hagonoy, Ibayo-Tipas, Ligid-Tipas, Lower Bicutan, New Lower Bicutan, Napindan, Palingon, Pembo, Rizal, San Miguel, Santa Ana, Tuktukan, Ususan and Wawa.
* Taguig&#x27;s Lone Congressional District (District II) covers the western portion of the city. It covers an area of . It consists of the western Taguig barangays of Cembo, Central Bicutan, Central Signal Village, East Rembo, Fort Bonifacio, Katuparan, Maharlika Village, North Daang Hari, North Signal Village, Pinagsama, Pitogo, Post Proper Northside, Post Proper Southside, South Cembo, South Daang Hari, South Signal Village, Tanyag, Upper Bicutan, West Rembo and Western Bicutan.


===Territorial disputes===

Taguig was involved in a territorial dispute with Makati and Pateros. In 1993, Taguig filed a complaint against Makati over the entirety of Fort Bonifacio and the Enlisted Men&#x27;s Barangays (EMBOs), claiming these areas were within its territory. The complaint also alleged that Presidential Proclamation Nos. 2475, s. 1986, and 518, s. 1990, were unconstitutional for altering Taguig&#x27;s boundaries without a plebiscite. In 2011, the Pasig Regional Trial Court upheld Taguig&#x27;s claim over the Fort Bonifacio Military Reservation, including the EMBO barangays, and ordered Makati to stop exercising jurisdiction over these areas. The Supreme Court of the Philippines affirmed this ruling with finality on April 27, 2022, declaring that Bonifacio Global City and the surrounding EMBO barangays were under Taguig&#x27;s jurisdiction.

Moreover, in around 2001, Taguig and Parañaque resolved a territorial dispute, agreeing that the Bicutan Market and the Bicutan Interchange, which involves the South Luzon Expressway, would be part of Parañaque.

===Geology===

The West Valley fault of the Marikina Valley Fault System traverses barangays Comembo, East Rembo, Pembo, Post Proper Southside, Rizal, Pinagsama, South Signal Village, North Signal Village, South Daang Hari, Central Bicutan, Ususan, Upper Bicutan, Central Signal Village, Maharlika Village, Lower Bicutan, Bagumbayan and Bagong Tanyag. Areas of the city prone to liquefaction includes sections of Circumferential Road 5 (C-5 Road) and the barangays of North Signal Village, Central Signal Village, South Signal Village and Pinagsama because they are situated on clay loam soil and are near Laguna de Bay.

===Climate===
Under the Köppen climate classification system, Manila has a tropical monsoon climate (Köppen &quot;Am&quot;), closely bordering on a tropical savanna climate (Köppen &quot;Aw&quot;). The climate of Taguig is characterized by two types of season: dry season from November to April, and wet season from May to October. Rainfall is less evenly distributed. Together with the rest of the Philippines, Taguig lies entirely within the tropics.

Tropical cyclones are relatively common, which resulted in flashfloods in low-lying areas of the city, especially those near major rivers and the Laguna de Bay. In 2009, Typhoon Ketsana hit Metro Manila, and the City of Taguig is one of the worst hit areas in the capital region when flood water inundate almost the whole city.

===Natural hazards===

The West Valley Fault runs through the middle-eastern part of Taguig, traversing 16 barangays of the city from north to south. The fault is capable of producing large scale earthquakes on its active phases with a magnitude of 7 or higher. The lowland areas along the coasts of Laguna de Bay and areas adjacent to the city&#x27;s major rivers are susceptible to flooding.

==Cityscape==

The city is divided into many districts. These districts and neighborhoods were developed piecemeal, especially the 10 Embo barangays which were mostly developed by Makati prior to their transfer to the jurisdiction of Taguig. This separated development gave these informal districts a unique identity.

The informal districts of the city include:

*Poblacion: The city&#x27;s historical city center and home to most of its local government and heritage sites, thus the district is also colloquially called Munisipyo. Six of the city&#x27;s nine original barrios are within this district. (Ususan, Wawa, Santa Ana, Tuktukan, Bambang, Hagonoy, San Miguel)
*Tipas: This district forms two of the city&#x27;s original barrios, it is notable for trying to secede from Taguig in the 1930s. It is the primary base of the city&#x27;s fishermen due to its proximity to the mouth of Pasig River and Laguna de Bay. It also hosts some industrial sites that spilled over from the industrial complex of neighboring Kalawaan in Pasig City. (Ibayo-Tipas, Ligid-Tipas, Calzada-Tipas, Palingon, Napindan)
*Bicutan: A predominantly residential area formed by President Diosdado Macapagal&#x27;s Proclamation No. 423 that revoked its military reservation status. The district hosts most of the city&#x27;s pre-BGC major educational institutions. Once a single large barangay upon its establishment, it is now made up of barangays Western Bicutan, Upper Bicutan, Central Bicutan, Lower Bicutan, New Lower Bicutan, and North Daang Hari.
*Tanyag: A residential district in the city&#x27;s southwestern tip named after the city&#x27;s longest serving mayor, Monico Tanyag. Originally considered as part of Bicutan, it developed into a residential area navigable by narrow alleys and a single main two lane road, sandwiched between the industrial areas of Bagumbayan, the railroad tracks, and the industrial sites along East Service Road under the jurisdiction of Brgy. San Martin de Porres, Parañaque City. It is made of barangays Tanyag, North Daang Hari, and South Daang Hari. These three barangays were formerly a single barangay known as Bagong Tanyag.
*Bagumbayan: The last Spanish formed district of the city located at its southern tip, and one of the original nine barrios of Taguig. It hosts most of the city&#x27;s industrial areas and is also home to a lakeshore community.
*Maharlika Village: The Muslim community created by President Ferdinand Marcos&#x27; Proclamation No. 1217. The Muslim neighborhoods also sprawl into the border areas of neighboring Upper Bicutan, Central Bicutan, Lower Bicutan, and New Lower Bicutan.
*Signal Village: The area was formed as an Enlisted Men&#x27;s village for military personnel, similar to the Embo barangays. The district is made up of barangays Central Signal, North Signal, South Signal, and Katuparan.
*Fort Bonifacio: Originally a military camp, it now hosts the city&#x27;s main business districts of Bonifacio Global City, McKinley West, and McKinley Hill. The district encompasses Fort Bonifacio, Pinagsama, parts of Ususan, and parts of Western Bicutan, being the de facto controlled parts of the districts before the Makati border dispute resolution. Post Proper Northside and Post Proper Southside had overlapping territorial claims in the area, while the Embo Barangays are informally included due to their proximity, historical affinity, and the lumping of Makati&#x27;s previous claims to the area.
*Embo: The city&#x27;s newly added district, formed by the barangays surrounding Fort Bonifacio/BGC regained from the territorial dispute with Makati. It is made up of barangays Cembo, South Cembo, East Rembo, West Rembo, Comembo, Pitogo, Pembo, and Rizal. The two Inner Fort barangays of Post Proper Northside and Post Proper Southside were also considered as part of the Embo district. The ten barangays formerly made up the majority of Makati&#x27;s second congressional district.

Based on the 2007 census, there were 44,332 migrants in Taguig, and most of these families settled in vast tracts of undeveloped lands that were not commonly found in other cities of Metro Manila. These led to a high population growth rate per annum between 2000 and 2007, which was largely attributed to uncontrolled migration. Following the 2022 Supreme Court ruling regarding the Makati–Taguig territorial dispute, the city gained ten additional barangays from Makati, further increasing its population to an estimated of 1.2 million, making it the fifth most populous city in the Philippines, surpassing Zamboanga City and Cebu City.

===Religion===
Majority of the city&#x27;s residents are Roman Catholics. All Roman Catholic churches in the city are under the jurisdiction of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Pasig, with the exception of the five parishes of the Embo barangays, which are under the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Manila due to having been previously under the civil jurisdiction of Makati. Catholicism in the military and police areas of the city is under the jurisdiction of the Military Ordinariate of the Philippines. The headquarters of Victory, an Evangelical Christian church, is located in Bonifacio Global City. The city is notable for being the birthplace of Felix Manalo, the founder of Iglesia ni Cristo. Maharlika Village is known for having the largest Muslim population in Metro Manila and is the home of the Blue Mosque, one of Metro Manila&#x27;s most prominent Islamic sites; it is one of oldest mosques in the region, and regularly hosts local and non-Filipino Muslims for worship.

===Poverty, housing and urban slums===
In 2007, Taguig was ranked the poorest in Metro Manila, with 5.2 percent of its population, considered poor. Of the 689,377 informal settler families living in Metro Manila, 20,718 were reported to be living in Taguig. Of these: 4,778 of these families lives along danger areas, along the lake shoreline, creeks, and rivers; 13,248 occupy government-owned lands; 718 occupy privately owned lands; and 1,974 families are in Areas of Priority Development. The poor, who mostly live in informal settlements are the most prone to natural hazards. In 2000, there are about 21,931 households in informal settlements or about 33.7% of the total household of Taguig.

The Taguig City Urban Poor Affairs Office (UPAO) is in-charge of the city&#x27;s poverty-alleviation program. In order to address the poverty in Taguig, the city government launched the Lifeline Assistance for Neighbors In-need Care and Support (LANI CARES) social program in June 2024, which grants financial, food and non-food assistance. The program is meant to augment existing social programs such as the national government DSWD programs such as the Assistance to Individuals in Crisis Situation (AICS) and &quot;Tulong Panghanapbuhay sa Ating&quot; Disadvantaged Workers (TUPAD).

====Housing====

The City Government of Taguig has undertaken socialized housing projects such as the Family Townhomes, which won the 2009 Galing Pook Awards. The Fort Bonifacio Tenement, constructed in 1963, is known for its basketball culture and its central courtyard basketball court often serves as a medium for murals and exhibitions.

The Bases Conversion and Development Authority (BCDA) has built several housing projects such as the &quot;Pamayanang&quot; Diego Silang (Diego Silang Community) in Ususan, whose main beneficiaries were the Philippine National Police (PNP) personnel who maintains a clean service record.

==Government and politics==
===City government===

Taguig is classified as a highly urbanized city (HUC).

The Taguig City Hall, located in Barangay Tuktukan, serves as the seat of the city government. Constructed in 1959, it underwent three renovations. It also maintains a satellite office at SM Aura Tower. A new 17-storey city hall is currently under-construction along Cayetano Boulevard in Barangay Ususan and will replace the current city hall.

The Mayor of Taguig is Lani Cayetano. Arvin Alit, a former councilor, is the city&#x27;s incumbent vice mayor. The mayor and the vice mayor are limited to up-to three terms, each term lasting for three years. They are both restricted to three consecutive terms, totaling nine years, although a mayor can be elected again after an interruption of one term. The vice mayor heads the Taguig City Council consisting of 18 members: 8 councilors from the 1st district, 8 councilors from the 2nd district, the president of the Sangguniang Kabataan (Youth Council) Federation as sectoral representative of the youth, and the president of the Association of Barangay Captains (ABC) as barangay sectoral representative. The council is in charge of creating the city&#x27;s policies in the form of ordinances and resolutions. The current district representatives of the city are Ricardo &quot;Ading&quot; Cruz Jr. for 1st district and Amparo Maria &quot;Pammy&quot; Zamora for 2nd district.

===National government===
As part of the National Capital Region (NCR), the city is the home to numerous national government bodies such as the Senate of the Philippines set to move in at least 2025.

<doc id="455689" wikidata="Q1703908" url="?curid=455689" title="Saer de Quincy, 1st Earl of Winchester">
<text>Saer de Quincy, 1st Earl of Winchester (c. 11553 November 1219) was one of the leaders of the baronial rebellion against John, King of England, and a major figure in both the kingdoms of Scotland and England in the decades around the turn of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. 

==Scottish Upbringing==

Although he was an Anglo-Norman, Saer de Quincy&#x27;s father, Robert de Quincy, had married and held important lordships in the Scottish kingdom of his cousin King William the Lion. His mother, Orabilis, was the heiress of the lordship of Leuchars and through her husband Robert became lord over lands in Fife, Perth and Lothian (see below).

Saer&#x27;s own rise to prominence in England came partly through his marriage to Margaret, the younger sister of Robert de Beaumont, 4th Earl of Leicester. Earl Robert died in 1204, and left Margaret as co-heiress to the vast earldom along with her elder sister. The estate was split in half, and after the final division was ratified in 1207, de Quincy was made Earl of Winchester.

==Earl of Winchester==

Following his marriage, Winchester became a prominent military and diplomatic figure in England. There is no evidence of any close alliance with King John, however, and his rise to importance was probably due to his newly acquired magnate status and the family connections that underpinned it.

Saer seems to have developed a close personal relationship with his 2nd cousin, Robert Fitzwalter (died 1235) the son of Walter Fitzrobert and Maud de Lucy. In 1203, they served as co-commanders of the garrison at the major fortress of Vaudreuil in Normandy. They surrendered the castle without a fight to Philip II of France, fatally weakening the English position in northern France. Although popular opinion seems to have blamed them for the capitulation, a royal writ is extant stating that the castle was surrendered at King John&#x27;s command, and both Winchester and Fitzwalter endured personal humiliation and heavy ransoms at the hands of the French.

In Scotland, he was perhaps more successful. In 1211 to 1212, the Earl of Winchester commanded an imposing retinue of a hundred knights and a hundred serjeants in William the Lion&#x27;s campaign against the Mac William rebels, a force which some historians have suggested may have been the mercenary force from Brabant lent to the campaign by John.

==Magna Carta==

In 1215, when the baronial rebellion broke out, Robert Fitzwalter became the military commander, and the Earl of Winchester joined him, acting as one of the chief authors of Magna Carta and negotiators with John; both cousins were among the 25 guarantors of Magna Carta. His name is mentioned in Clause 61, (1215) de Quincy fought against John in the troubles that followed the sealing of the Charter, and, again with Fitzwalter, travelled to France to invite Prince Louis of France to take the English throne. He and Fitzwalter were subsequently among the most committed and prominent supporters of Louis&#x27;s candidature for the kingship, against both John and the infant Henry III.

==The Fifth Crusade==
When military defeat cleared the way for Henry III to take the throne, de Quincy went on crusade, perhaps in fulfilment of an earlier vow. In 1219 he left to join the Fifth Crusade, then besieging Damietta. 

==Death==

While in Damietta Egypt 1219, he fell sick and died. He was buried in Acre, the capital of the Kingdom of Jerusalem, rather than in Egypt, and his heart was brought back and interred at Garendon Abbey near Loughborough, a house endowed by his wife&#x27;s family. Garendon Abbey does not exist anymore and was dissolved in the mid 1500’s the last abbot was Randolph Arnold, last abbot it was disestablished 1536.

==Family==
The family of de Quincy had arrived in Scotland and England after the Norman Conquest, and took their name from Cuinchy in the Arrondissement of Béthune; the personal name &quot;Saer&quot; was used by them over several generations. Both names are variously spelt in primary sources and older modern works, the first name being sometimes rendered &quot;Saher&quot; or &quot;Seer&quot;, and the surname as &quot;Quency&quot; or &quot;Quenci&quot;.

The first recorded Saer de Quincy (known to historians as &quot;Saer I&quot;) was lord of the manor of Long Buckby in Northamptonshire in the earlier twelfth century, and second husband of Maud de Senlis, daughter of Simon I de Senlis, Earl of Huntingdon-Northampton and  Maud of Huntingdon, stepdaughter of King David I of Scotland. This marriage produced two sons, Saer II and Robert de Quincy. It was Robert, the younger son, who was the father of the Saer de Quincy who eventually became Earl of Winchester. By her first husband Robert Fitz Richard, Maud was also the paternal grandmother of Earl Saer&#x27;s close ally, Robert Fitzwalter.

Robert de Quincy seems to have inherited no English lands from his father, and pursued a knightly career in Scotland, where he is recorded from around 1160 as a close companion of his cousin, King William the Lion. By 1170 he had married Orabilis, heiress of the Scottish lordship of Leuchars and, through her, he became lord of an extensive complex of estates north of the border which included lands in Fife, Strathearn and Lothian.

Saer de Quincy, the son of Robert de Quincy and Orabilis of Leuchars, was raised largely in Scotland . His absence from English records for the first decades of his life has led some modern historians and genealogists to confuse him with his great uncle, Saer II, who took part in the rebellion of Henry the Young King in 1173, when the future Earl of Winchester can have been no more than a toddler. Saer II&#x27;s line ended without direct heirs, and his nephew and namesake would eventually inherit his estate, uniting his primary Scottish holdings with the family&#x27;s Northamptonshire patrimony, and possibly some lands in France.

<text>HMS J7 (later HMAS J7) was a J-class submarine operated by the Royal Navy and the Royal Australian Navy.

==Design and construction==

The J class was designed by the Royal Navy in response to reported German submarines with surface speeds over . The submarines had a displacement of 1,210 tons surfaced, but &quot;J7&quot; had a lighter submerged displacement than her sister boats, at 1,760 tons. Each submarine was in length overall, with a beam of , and a draught of . The propulsion system was built around three propeller shafts; the J-class were the only triple-screwed submarines ever built by the British. Propulsion came from three 12-cylinder diesel motors when on the surface, and electric motors when submerged. Top speed was on the surface (the fastest submarines in the world at the time of construction), and underwater. Range was at .

Armament consisted of six 18 inch (450 mm) torpedo tubes (four forward, one on each beam), plus a 4-inch deck gun. Originally, the gun was mounted on a breastwork fitted forward of the conning tower, but the breastwork was later extended to the bow and merged into the hull for streamlining, and the gun was relocated to a platform fitted to the front of the conning tower. The conning tower on &quot;J7&quot; was sited further back than her sister boats, as the control room was located behind the machinery spaces. 44 personnel were aboard.

&quot;J7&quot; was built by HM Dockyard Devonport in Plymouth and launched on 12 February 1917.

==Operational history==
After the war, the British Admiralty decided that the best way to protect the Pacific region was with a force of submarines and cruisers. To this end, they offered the six surviving submarines of the J-class to the Royal Australian Navy as gifts. &quot;J1&quot; and her sisters were commissioned into the RAN in April 1919, and sailed for Australia on 9 April, in the company of the cruisers and , and the tender . The flotilla reached Thursday Island on 29 June, and Sydney on 10 July. Because of the submarines&#x27; condition after the long voyage, they were immediately taken out of service for refits.
By the time &quot;J7&quot; was returned to service in June 1922, the cost of maintaining the boats and deteriorating economic conditions saw the six submarines decommissioned and marked for disposal.

==Fate==

&quot;J7&quot; was paid off on 12 July 1922, and was sold on 26 February 1924. The hulk was scuttled in 1930, for use as a breakwater at the Sandringham Yacht Club in Port Phillip. Some years later a stone marina was constructed around the wreck, which was left in situ and visible, being too expensive to remove, where it continues to deteriorate.

<text>HMAS &quot;Junee&quot; (J362/M362), named for the town of Junee, New South Wales, was one of 60 &quot;Bathurst&quot;-class corvettes constructed during World War II, and one of 36 initially manned and commissioned solely by the Royal Australian Navy (RAN).

==Design and construction==

In 1938, the Australian Commonwealth Naval Board (ACNB) identified the need for a general purpose &#x27;local defence vessel&#x27; capable of both anti-submarine and mine-warfare duties, while easy to construct and operate. The vessel was initially envisaged as having a displacement of approximately 500 tons, a speed of at least , and a range of The opportunity to build a prototype in the place of a cancelled Bar-class boom defence vessel saw the proposed design increased to a 680-ton vessel, with a top speed, and a range of , armed with a 4-inch gun, equipped with asdic, and able to fitted with either depth charges or minesweeping equipment depending on the planned operations: although closer in size to a sloop than a local defence vessel, the resulting increased capabilities were accepted due to advantages over British-designed mine warfare and anti-submarine vessels. Construction of the prototype did not go ahead, but the plans were retained. The need for locally built &#x27;all-rounder&#x27; vessels at the start of World War II saw the &quot;Australian Minesweepers&quot; (designated as such to hide their anti-submarine capability, but popularly referred to as &quot;corvettes&quot;) approved in September 1939, with 60 constructed during the course of the war: 36 (including &quot;Junee&quot;) ordered by the RAN, 20 ordered by the British Admiralty but manned and commissioned as RAN vessels, and 4 for the Royal Indian Navy.

&quot;Junee&quot; was laid down by Poole &amp; Steel at Balmain, New South Wales on 17 February 1943. She was launched on 16 November 1943 by the wife of John Solomon Rosevear, Speaker of the Australian House of Representatives, and commissioned into the RAN on 11 April 1944.

==Operational history==
===World War II===
After entering active service, &quot;Junee&quot; was briefly assigned to New Guinea before being redeployed to Darwin, where she served as an anti-submarine patrol ship until February 1945, when the corvette underwent refit in Melbourne.

In April 1945, &quot;Junee&quot; was sent to New Guinea, to serve as a convoy escort and anti-submarine patrol ship. In August, the corvette for the first time; sinking three Japanese supply barges while in the Sangir Islands. The corvette was later assigned to Balikpapan as a guard ship, where she remained until the end of World War II.

Following the end of the war, &quot;Junee&quot; evacuated Australian prisoners-of-war and civilians, assisted in the transportation of occupation forces, and aided in the reestablishment of Dutch authority in the Netherlands East Indies. After fulfilling these duties, &quot;Junee&quot; returned to Australia, and was paid off into reserve in Melbourne on 21 January 1946.

&quot;Junee&quot; received two battle honours for her wartime service: &quot;New Guinea 1943&quot; and &quot;Pacific 1944–45&quot;.

===Post-war===
The corvette was reactivated and recommissioned as a training ship on 25 February 1953. Initially operating along the east coast, &quot;Junee&quot; was reassigned to the west coast on 25 August, operating from Fremantle.

==Decommissioning and fate==
HMAS &quot;Junee&quot; paid off to reserve for the final time at Fremantle on 21 August 1957. She was sold for scrap to W. G. Davies of Fremantle on 18 June 1958. The ship was stripped and the hull sunk in the Rottnest ship graveyard off Rottnest Island, Western Australia on 6 or 7 September 1968.

<text>A geographical pole or geographic pole is either of the two points on Earth where its axis of rotation intersects its surface. The North Pole lies in the Arctic Ocean while the South Pole is in Antarctica. North and South poles are also defined for other planets or satellites in the Solar System, with a North pole being on the same side of the invariable plane as Earth&#x27;s North pole.

Relative to Earth&#x27;s surface, the geographic poles move by a few metres over periods of a few years. This is a combination of Chandler wobble, a free oscillation with a period of about 433 days; an annual motion responding to seasonal movements of air and water masses; and an irregular drift towards the 80th west meridian. As cartography requires exact and unchanging coordinates, the averaged locations of geographical poles are taken as fixed &quot;cartographic poles&quot; and become the points where the body&#x27;s great circles of longitude intersect.

<text>The Arado Ar 231 was a lightweight floatplane, developed during World War II in Nazi Germany as a scout plane for submarines by Arado. The need to be stored inside the submarine necessitated compromises in design that made this single-seat seaplane of little practical use.

==Design and development==

Designed from the outset for use on U-boat &quot;cruisers&quot;, like the Type XI B, the Ar 231 was a light parasol-wing aircraft. The aircraft was powered by a 119 kW (160 hp) Hirth HM 501 inline engine, weighed around 1,000 kg (2,200 lb), and had a 10 m (33 ft) wingspan. The design led to a simple and compact aircraft that could be fitted into a storage cylinder only 2 m (6 ft 7 in) in diameter. For ease of storage, the Ar 231&#x27;s wings featured detachable sections that two operators could remove in less than six minutes. One unusual feature was an offset wing design, with the right wing root attaching to the wing&#x27;s tilted center section (elevated above the fuselage, as on all parasol-wing designs) and lower than the left wing root, to allow the wings to overlap when folded, so as to occupy less space.

==Operational history==
Testing soon revealed the Ar 231s to be fragile, underpowered, and difficult to fly even during calm weather. Moreover, U-boat commanders were reluctant to linger on the surface for launch and retrieval and, as a result, development ended in favour of the Focke Achgelis Fa 330 gyroglider. Some of the testing was done on the auxiliary cruiser &quot;Stier&quot;, two of the six prototypes being taken on one voyage.

<text>HMAS &quot;Kalgoorlie&quot; (J192/B245/A119), named for the city of Kalgoorlie, was one of 60 &quot;Bathurst&quot;-class corvettes constructed during World War II and one of 20 built for the Admiralty but manned by personnel of and commissioned into the Royal Australian Navy (RAN).

==Design and construction==

In 1938, the Australian Commonwealth Naval Board (ACNB) identified the need for a general purpose &#x27;local defence vessel&#x27; capable of both anti-submarine and mine-warfare duties, while easy to construct and operate. The vessel was initially envisaged as having a displacement of approximately 500 tons, a speed of at least , and a range of The opportunity to build a prototype in the place of a cancelled Bar-class boom defence vessel saw the proposed design increased to a 680-ton vessel, with a top speed, and a range of , armed with a 4-inch gun, equipped with asdic, and able to be fitted with either depth charges or minesweeping equipment depending on the planned operations: although closer to a sloop than a local defence vessel, the resulting increased capabilities were accepted due to advantages over British-designed mine warfare and anti-submarine vessels. Construction of the prototype did not go ahead, but the plans were retained. The need for locally built &#x27;all-rounder&#x27; vessels at the start of World War II saw the &quot;Australian Minesweepers&quot; (designated as such to hide their anti-submarine capability, but popularly referred to as &quot;corvettes&quot;) approved in September 1939, with 60 constructed during the course of the war: 36 ordered by the RAN, 20 (including &quot;Kalgoorlie&quot;) ordered by the British Admiralty but manned and commissioned as RAN vessels, and four for the Royal Indian Navy.

&quot;Kalgoorlie&quot; was laid down by BHP at its Whyalla shipyard on 27 July 1940. She was launched on 7 August 1941 by the wife of Premier of South Australia Thomas Playford IV, and was commissioned into the RAN on 7 April 1942.

==Operational history==
===RAN service===
After completing trials, &quot;Kalgoorlie&quot; was assigned as a convoy escort. Initially operating along the east coast of Sydney, the corvette was moved to Darwin in August 1942 and taken with convoys between Australia, Thursday Island and Timor. On 25 September, &quot;Kalgoorlie&quot; and sister ship evacuated the ship&#x27;s company of the destroyer , which had run aground at Betano Bay two days before. In early December, &quot;Kalgoorlie&quot; was involved in the search for survivors from her sister ship , which had been sunk by Japanese aircraft on 1 December. &quot;Kalgoorlie&quot; eventually recovered 49 of the survivors.

In April 1943, the corvette returned to the east coast of Australia, still operating as a convoy escort. On 15 June, a thirteen-ship convoy heading for Brisbane and escorted by &quot;Kalgoorlie&quot; and sister ships , , , and , was attacked off Smoky Cape. The United States Army Transport &quot;Portmar&quot; and the US Navy Landing ship were torpedoed by Japanese submarine &quot;I-174&quot;: the former sinking in minutes with the loss of only two lives, while 26 were killed aboard the latter ship, which survived and was towed to port. Despite attempts to locate the submarine immediately after the attack, and a multiple-day search performed by &quot;Kalgoorlie&quot;, &quot;I-174&quot; escaped unharmed. This was the last submarine attack to be made on the east coast of Australia during World War II.

&quot;Kalgoorlie&quot; spent the first half of 1944 as a convoy escort between Queensland and New Guinea, then joined sister ship in clearing the minefields laid by throughout the Great Barrier Reef during the early part of the war. During August and September, the two corvettes located and destroyed almost 500 mines. &quot;Kalgoorlie&quot; spent the rest of the year on convoy escort duties, before joining the British Pacific Fleet at the end of 1944. The corvette operated with the Pacific Fleet until 15 July 1945, when she arrived in Brisbane for a refit. &quot;Kalgoorlie&quot; was still undergoing refit when the war ended. After the refit, the corvette operated in New Guinea and Australian waters until early May 1946.

The corvette was awarded four battle honours for her wartime service: &quot;Darwin 1942–43&quot;, &quot;Pacific 1942–43&quot;, &quot;New Guinea 1943–44&quot;, and &quot;Okinawa 1945&quot;.

&quot;Kalgoorlie&quot; paid off on 8 May 1946, and was recommissioned on the same day into the Royal Netherlands Navy as HNLMS &quot;Ternate&quot;. It was scrapped in Japan in 1962.

<text>The coat of arms of Andorra (Catalan: &quot;Escut d&#x27;Andorra&quot;) is the heraldic device consisting of a shield divided quarterly by the arms of the Bishop of Urgell and the Count of Foix – who have historically been the two co-princes of Andorra – in addition to the emblems of Catalonia and the Viscount of Béarn. Utilized unofficially since the Middle Ages, its status as the coat of arms of the Principality of Andorra was formalized in 1993 upon the implementation of their new constitution. The escutcheon is featured on the flag of Andorra.

==Official description==
Andorran law describes the coat of arms as follows:

&quot;The coat of arms of the Principality of Andorra has been traditionally formed by four quarters, two of which are the ones of the two Co-Princes. The four traditional quarters are:

*&quot;1) that of the Bishopric, represented by a golden mitre and a golden crosier on a red background;&quot;
*&quot;2) that of Foix;&quot;
*&quot;3) that of Catalonia;&quot;
*&quot;4) that of Béarn.&quot;

&quot;The arms can have at the bottom the motto &quot;Virtus Unita Fortior&quot;. The arms can have an aureola, a scroll, or it can be crowned by the lord&#x27;s emblems (crown, chapeau).&quot;

==History==

The usage of the arms of the Bishop of Urgell and the Count of Foix stems originates from a settlement made in 1278 concerning territory sandwiched between the lands they had jurisdiction over. The two parties agreed to protect the principality jointly as co-princes. The arms of Catalonia and Béarn were added, and a &quot;centuries-old carving&quot; of this four-part quartered emblem is featured on the exterior of the country&#x27;s parliament building – the Casa de la Vall – which served as the meeting place of the General Council until 2014. It was also found on the lintel of a house in Barcelona dating back to 1761. However, its status was not official until it was designated as the principality&#x27;s coat of arms under Article 2(2) of the Constitution of Andorra, which was approved in a 1993 referendum and came into force that same year.

==Design==
===Construction===
===Symbolism===
The top two quarters depict the arms of the &quot;two traditional protectors&quot; of the principality – the Count of Foix and the Bishop of Urgell. While the latter title is still extant and its holder continues to rule Andorra as a co-prince, the former was absorbed, first into the title of King of France, and subsequently transferred to the President of France. The quarters at the bottom – of Catalonia and Béarn – allude to the other territories that Andorra has historically been reliant upon. At the bottom is the country&#x27;s motto – Strength united is stronger ().

===Uses===
The coat of arms is employed on the centre yellow band of the flag of Andorra. It also features extensively on coins minted by Andorra.

<text>The violet turaco, also known as the violaceous plantain eater (Tauraco violaceus), is a large turaco, a group of African otidimorphae.

==Characteristics==
These are unmistakable birds, but shy and often inconspicuous in the treetops. They are approximately long, including a long tail and a bill. They boast a winglength of and weigh approximately . The plumage is glossy violet, except for the yellow forehead, chestnut crown and white ear coverts; the bill is thick and red. In flight, the violet turaco&#x27;s crimson primary flight feathers contrast with the violet plumage. The red colour in the wings is typical of turacos.

==Habitat==
It is resident of West Africa, and has an extremely large range from Senegal through to Nigeria, with isolated populations in Chad and the Central African Republic. It occurs in tropical savannas, wetlands, woodlands and forests.

==Diet==
Diet consists of fruit, and they are quite partial to figs, but they will also eat leaves, buds, flowers, insects, snails and slugs.

==Reproduction==
Cooperative breeding behavior has been observed in captivity in this species. They breed mainly during the rainy season, but the timing varies from place to place. As the breeding starts around April in Senegal and Gambia, while in Nigeria it occurs between June and October.
The female lays two eggs in a flimsy tree platform nest. Both male and female take care of the eggs and hatchlings.

==Threats==
This species is locally common, but is vulnerable to trapping for the pet trade in Guinea, Sierra Leone, Liberia and Ghana.

==Behavior==
Turacos are social birds, travelling in flocks of around ten to twelve individuals. They are not strong fliers, preferring to hop along branches. When threatened, they can run quickly through the trees. The violet turaco has a loud &quot;&quot; call.

<text>The Messerschmitt Bf 108 &quot;Taifun&quot; (English: &quot;Typhoon&quot;) is a single-engine sport and touring aircraft designed and produced by the German aircraft manufacturer Bayerische Flugzeugwerke (BFW). It was the first aircraft of its size to feature all-metal stressed skin construction.

==Design and development==
During 1933, the German aircraft manufacturer Bayerische Flugzeugwerke (BFW) received a contract from the Reichsluftfahrtministerium (RLM/German Aviation Ministry) to produce a aircraft to compete in the 4th &quot;Challenge International de Tourisme&quot; (1934). The resulting aircraft, which was internally designated as &quot;M 37&quot; and subsequently received the official designation &quot;Bf 108&quot;, was a four-seat sports/recreation aircraft designed by the aeronautical engineer Willy Messerschmitt.

In terms of its design, the Bf 108 represented a departure from many of the company&#x27;s existing design practices; foremost of which, it was the first aircraft of its size to use all-metal stressed skin construction. The wing featured a patented single-spar design and was equipped with both trailing edge flaps and leading-edge slots, the latter of which deployed automatically when the aircraft neared stall conditions. Initially, all of the flight control surfaces were hinged at their leading edges without any application of dynamical balancing. The legs of the main undercarriage pivoted near the wingroot to retract outwards into wells that almost entirely enclosed them. The aircraft was initially powered by a 250 PS (247 hp, 184 kW) Hirth HM 8U 8.0 litre displacement, air-cooled inverted-V8 engine, which drove a three-blade propeller.

By 1934, six aircraft had been produced. During spring 1934, the prototype Bf 108 conducted its maiden flight; the ensuring flight test programme was relatively smooth. Even during these early flights, the aircraft proved to be relatively safe yet quick, possessing excellent low-speed flight characteristics and being pleasant to fly. Furthermore, the aircraft&#x27;s metal structure proved to be fairly maintenance-friendly.

During 1934, the first production-standard model, designated &quot;Bf 108A&quot;, made its first flight. One year later, it was followed by the &quot;Bf 108B&quot;, which was powered by the substantially larger, 12.67 litre displacement Argus As 10 air-cooled inverted V8 engine. Various other design changes on this model include a revised fin shape, elimination of the upper bracings of the tailplane, the adoption of a tailwheel in place of a skid, and the dynamic balancing of both the elevator and rudder. Only a few Bf 108Bs were completed prior to production of the type being transferred to a new plant in Regensburg. Serial production proceeded at a pace; by 1942, in excess of 500 aircraft had been completed.

The nickname &quot;Taifun&quot; (German for &quot;typhoon&quot;) came from the German pilot Elly Beinhorn, who had given it to her personal aircraft; it was generally adopted thereafter.

During 1941, the &quot;Bf 108C&quot; was proposed as a specialised aircraft, to be equipped with the powerful Hirth HM 512 inverted-V supercharged air-cooled engine, that was intended to achieve record-breaking performance. However, it was passed over for the &quot;Me 208&quot;, an enlarged version that featured numerous alterations and improvements, including a retractable tricycle landing gear. Only a pair of prototypes were completed before the end of the Second World War.

==Operational history==
As planned, the BF 108 participated in the 4th &quot;Challenge International de Tourisme&quot;. Although it was outperformed by several other aircraft in the competition, the overall performance of the type marked it as a popular choice for record flights. Particular among these traits was its low fuel consumption rate, good handling, and superb takeoff and landing characteristics. During the prewar years, the type was widely flown by private pilots, several of which were flying officers within &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;. While the majority of aircraft produced went into German ownership, in excess of 50 Bf 108Bs were exported to countries such as Bulgaria, Hungary, Japan, Romania, Switzerland, Yugoslavia, and the Soviet Union.

The type&#x27;s appearances at various parts of the world helped to bolster the reputation of both Messerschmitt and the German aeronautical sector in general. Throughout the mid-to-late 1930s, the Bf 108 was a common sight at aerial competitions, commonly placing in either first or second place in events such as the 1937 Oases rally in Egypt and the 1938 Belgian international Queen Astrid Race. Furthermore, during July 1939, one aircraft established a new altitude class record of 9,075m (29,766ft).

Early on in the Second World War, the Bf 108 was formally introduced to service with the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;. As a military aircraft, the type was primarily used as a personnel transport and liaison aircraft, ferrying pilots and personnel between air bases. It was also operated by the &quot;Luftdienst&quot;, where it was typically used to perform target towing and supply operations. The aircraft involved in the Mechelen Incident was a Bf 108. Furthermore, a Bf 108 served with the small long-range bombing group &quot;Sonderkommando Blaich&quot; based in Africa.

Mid-way through the conflict, production of the Bf 108 was transferred from Germany to Les Mureaux occupied France. After the conflict&#x27;s end, these assembly lines remained in the possession of the French aircraft manufacturer SNCAN; the newly-liberated country promptly opted to continue production of the type as the Nord 1000 &quot;Pingouin&quot;.

Many of the postwar movie portrayals of the Bf 108 have been performed by the French-built derivatives of the type, which include not only the &quot;Pingouin&quot; but also the further-improved Nord Noralpha.

==Variants==
;Bf 108A
:Initial version designed in 1934 for use in Challenge 1934. Six were built with the Hirth HM 8U, one other initially had a 220 PS (217 hp, 162 kW) Argus As 17B inline engine and later a 160 PS (158 hp, 118 kW) Siemens-Halske Sh 14 radial.
;Bf 108B
:Revised version, built from late 1935. The prototype had a Siemens-Halske Sh 14A radial, but production machines used the 240 PS (237 hp, 177 kW) Argus As 10C or the 270 PS (266 hp, 199 kW) Argus As 10E. A quadrant-shaped rather than rectangular rear window, tailwheel replacing skid, revision of shape of empennage and removal of tailplane upper bracing. 
;Bf 108C:Proposed high-speed version, powered by a 400 PS (395 hp, 294 kW) Hirth HM 512 engine. Probably not built.
;Me 208
:Improved and enlarged version with a retractable tricycle landing gear. Two prototypes were built by SNCAN (Nord) in France during the war. After 1945 Nord continued its production as the Nord Noralpha.
;Nord 1000 &quot;Pingouin&quot;
:Bf 108 built during and after the war by SNCAN in France; followed by the Nord 1001, that had only minor variations and the Nord 1002, which used a Renault engine.
;Nord 1100 &quot;Noralpha&quot;
:Bf 108 derivative built after the war by SNCAN in France with tricycle landing gear and a Renault engine.

<text>The Guinea turaco (Tauraco persa), also known as the green turaco or green lourie, is a species of turaco, a group of African otidimorph birds. It formerly included the Livingstone&#x27;s, Schalow&#x27;s, Knysna, black-billed and Fischer&#x27;s turacos as subspecies.

==Taxonomy==
The Guinea turaco was formally described by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in 1758 in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. He placed it together with the cuckoos in the genus &quot;Cuculus&quot; and coined the binomial name &quot;Cuculus persa&quot;. The specific epithet is Latin meaning &quot;Persian&quot;. Linnaeus based his description on the &quot;Touraco&quot; that had been described and illustrated in 1743 by the English naturalist George Edwards in his &quot;A Natural History of Uncommon Birds&quot;. Edwards&#x27;s specimen had been brought to London from Guinea in West Africa. The Guinea turaco is now placed in the genus &quot;Tauraco&quot; that was introduced in 1779 by the Polish naturalist Jan Krzysztof Kluk.

Three subspecies are recognised:
*&quot;T. p. buffoni&quot; (Vieillot, 1819) – Senegambia to Liberia
*&quot;T. p. persa&quot; (Linnaeus, 1758) – Ivory Coast and Ghana to west Cameroon
*&quot;T. p. zenkeri&quot; Reichenow, 1896 – south Cameroon, west Central African Republic, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, north Angola, Congo and northwest DRCongo

==Description==
The Guinea turaco, often inconspicuous in the treetops, is approximately long, including a long tail. The weight can reach . The plumage is largely brilliant green and blue and the tail and wings are dark purplish, except for the crimson primary feathers that are very distinct in flight. On the head is present an erectile semi-circular green crest. On the eyes there are red and white patches. The bill is thick and red. In the westernmost subspecies &quot;Tauraco persa buffoni&quot;, which sometimes is known as the Buffon&#x27;s turaco, there is a white line above and in front of the eye and a black line below the eye. In the nominate subspecies (&quot;Tauraco persa persa&quot;) of the central part of its range and &quot;zenkeri&quot; of the southeastern part there also is a second white line below the black line. Unlike similar turacos with red bills, even adult Guinea turacos lack a white rear edge to the crest.

The Guinea turaco has a loud &quot;cawr-cawr&quot; call, consisting of 10–16 raucous cawing notes.

==Distribution and habitat==
Guinea turaco has an extremely large range and a stable population. It can be found in forests of West and Central Africa, ranging from Senegal east to DR Congo and south to northern Angola. It is present in the Republic of the Congo, Angola, Benin, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Ivory Coast, Liberia, Mali, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone and Togo.

This species inhabits subtropical and tropical moist lowland, gallery forests and tropical rain forests edge, often near cultivated areas. It is common in climax forest with plentiful tall trees, from sea level to about .

==Behaviour and ecology==

&quot;Tauraco persa&quot; is normally sedentary and strongly territorial. These birds feed on wide variety of wild and cultivated tropical fruits (for instance on Musanga, Macaranga, Rauvolfia, Cissus and Ficus species, etc.), but also on blossoms. They do not fly very well, preferring to climb from branch to branch.

They breed in May–June and August in Cameroon, from December to February and from June to September in Gabon, while in Sierra Leone they breed in June and in October. Females lay two eggs in a tree platform nest.

<text>In computing, mass storage refers to the storage of large amounts of data in a persisting and machine-readable fashion. In general, the term &quot;mass&quot; in &quot;mass storage&quot; is used to mean &quot;large&quot; in relation to contemporaneous hard disk drives, but it has also been used to mean &quot;large&quot; relative to the size of primary memory as for example with floppy disks on personal computers.

Devices and/or systems that have been described as mass storage include tape libraries, RAID systems, and a variety of computer drives such as hard disk drives (HDDs), magnetic tape drives, magneto-optical disc drives, optical disc drives, memory cards, and solid-state drives (SSDs). It also includes experimental forms like holographic memory. Mass storage includes devices with removable and non-removable media. It does not include random access memory (RAM).

There are two broad classes of mass storage: local data in devices such as smartphones or computers, and enterprise servers and data centers for the cloud. For local storage, SSDs are on the way to replacing HDDs. Considering the mobile segment from phones to notebooks, the majority of systems today is based on NAND Flash. As for Enterprise and data centers, storage tiers have established using a mix of SSD and HDD.

== Definition ==
The notion of &quot;large&quot; amounts of data is of course highly dependent on the time frame and the market segment, as storage device capacity has increased by many orders of magnitude since the beginnings of computer technology in the late 1940s and continues to grow; however, in any time frame, common mass storage devices have tended to be much larger and at the same time much slower than common realizations of contemporaneous primary storage technology.

Papers at the 1966 Fall Joint Computer Conference (FJCC) used the term &quot;mass storage&quot; for devices substantially larger than contemporaneous hard disk drives. Similarly, a 1972 analysis identified mass storage systems from Ampex (Terabit Memory) using video tape, Precision Industries (Unicon 690-212) using lasers and International Video (IVC-1000) using video tape and states &quot;In the literature, the most common definition of mass storage capacity is a trillion bits.&quot;. The first IEEE conference on mass storage was held in 1974 and at that time identified mass storage as &quot;capacity on the order of 1012 bits&quot; (1 gigabyte). In the mid-1970s IBM used the term to in the name of the IBM 3850 Mass Storage System, which provided virtual disks backed up by Helical scan magnetic tape cartridges, slower than disk drives but with a capacity larger than was affordable with disks. The term &quot;mass storage&quot; was used in the PC marketplace for devices, such as floppy disk drives, far smaller than devices that were not considered mass storage in the mainframe marketplace.

Mass storage devices are characterized by:

* Sustainable transfer speed
* Seek time
* Cost
* Capacity

== Storage media ==
Hard disk drives dominate storage media in terms of exabytes shipped and are projected to continue to so for this decade.

Solid-state drives (i.e. Flash storage media) are the predominant storage media in personal computers. Flash memory (in particular, NAND flash) has an established and growing niche in high performance enterprise computing installations. Flash memory has also long been popular as removable storage such as USB sticks, where it de facto makes up the market. Flash dominates in cell phones.

Tape is predominantly used for archival storage

Optical discs are almost exclusively used in the physical distribution of retail software, music and movies because of the cost and manufacturing efficiency of the molding process used to produce DVD and compact discs and the nearly-universal presence of reader drives in personal computers and consumer appliances.

The design of computer architectures and operating systems are often dictated by the mass storage and bus technology of their time.

== Usage ==
Mass storage devices used in desktop and most server computers typically have their data organized in a file system. The choice of file system is often important in maximizing the performance of the device: general purpose file systems (such as NTFS and HFS, for example) tend to do poorly on slow-seeking optical storage such as compact discs.

Some relational databases can also be deployed on mass storage devices without an intermediate file system or storage manager. Oracle and MySQL, for example, can store table data directly on raw block devices.

On removable media, archive formats (such as tar archives on magnetic tape, which pack file data end-to-end) are sometimes used instead of file systems because they are more portable and simpler to stream.

On embedded computers, it is common to memory map the contents of a mass storage device (usually ROM or flash memory) so that its contents can be traversed as in-memory data structures or executed directly by programs.

<doc id="455720" wikidata="Q3545565" url="?curid=455720" title="Sampaloc, Manila">
<text>Sampaloc is a district of Manila, Philippines. It is referred to as the University Belt or simply called &quot;U-Belt&quot; for numerous colleges and universities are found within the district such as the University of Santo Tomas, the oldest extant university in Asia; the National University, the first private nonsectarian and coeducational institution in the Philippines; the Far Eastern University, known for its Art Deco campus and cultural heritage site of the Philippines; and the University of the East, once dubbed as the largest university in Asia in terms of enrollment. The district is bordered by the districts of Quiapo and San Miguel in the south, Santa Mesa district in the south and east, Santa Cruz district in the west and north, and Quezon City in the northeast.

Aside from being the &quot;University Belt&quot;, Sampaloc is also known to Metro Manila and the surrounding provinces for its Dangwa flower market, located in Dimasalang Road, well known as the selling center for cut flowers from all over the Philippines, mainly Baguio. Sampaloc is also the location of a former colonial mansion, now called Windsor Inn, which is popular among backpackers and budget travelers.

Barangays 395 to 636 of the City of Manila would all have belonged to Sampaloc and comprise 241 barangays for the district. However, what are now known as barangays 587-636 became part of Santa Mesa when these areas were separated from Sampaloc after Santa Mesa became a separate parish in 1911. Santa Mesa is now a part of the 6th congressional district of Manila, while Sampaloc is the sole district comprising the 4th congressional district of Manila.

Many streets in Sampaloc, particularly in the northeast portion divided by España and Lacson Avenues and also street names in neighboring Quezon City, have names that are directly associated with the Philippine national hero José Rizal, either named after the places (e.g. Calamba, Dapitan), real-life people (e.g. Blumentritt), characters from his novels (e.g. Ibarra, Maria Clara) or his pen names (e.g. Laong Laan, Dimasalang).

==Etymology==
&quot;Sampaloc&quot; or &quot;Sampalok&quot; is the native Tagalog word for the tamarind fruit; the place was likely named after tamarind trees that may have been prevalent in the area.

==History==

The founding of Sampaloc as a town coincided with its establishment as a parish independent of Santa Ana de Sapa in 1613. At the time, it included what is now Pandacan which was separated from it in 1712. Sampaloc would comprise ten barangays ― Bacood, Balic-Balic, Bilarang Hipon, Calubcub, Manggahan, Nagtahan, San Isidro, San Roque, Santa Mesa, and Santol.

===Outbreak of the Philippine-American War===

Following the Philippine Revolution against Spain and the Treaty of Paris of 1898 which seceded the Philippines to the United States, the subsequent arrival of American colonial troops shortly drew animosity between both American troops and Filipino troops. 

On the evening of February 4, Private William W. Grayson fired the war&#x27;s first shots at the corner of Sociego Street and Tomas Arguelles Street. A study done by Ronnie Miravite Casalmir places the event at this corner, not at Sociego-Silencio where they erroneously have the marker.

===American colonial era===
In 1901, with the chartering of the city of Manila under the American-led Taft Commission, where most of Sampaloc, with the exception of barangay Bilarang Hipon, would be absorbed by the city of Manila when its borders were extended outside the walled city now known as Intramuros. The latter barangay would be incorporated into San Francisco del Monte town and later on Quezon City, being divided later into several villages itself under what is now its 4th district.

In 1911, Santa Mesa became a separate religious district (parish) out of Sampaloc when the first and oldest parish in the Philippines in honor of its Titular Patron, the Sacred Heart of Jesus, was established. However, it remained politically part of Sampaloc.

===Contemporary period===
In 1996, Ramon Bagatsing Jr., the then-representative of Manila&#x27;s 4th district, launched a program called the &quot;Sampaloc Experiment&quot;, which sought to implement the then-new subject of computer education within the district&#x27;s public schools as a trial program for the rest of the country.

==Barangays==

==Education==

Education in Sampaloc is handled by the Division of City Schools – Manila. Sampaloc is also home to some universities and colleges part of the University Belt such as Far Eastern University, Informatics, Mary Chiles College, National University, Perpetual Help College of Manila, Philippine College of Health Sciences, Philippine School of Business Administration, University of the East, University of Manila, and University of Santo Tomas.

Sampaloc elementary-public education&#x27;s Dr. Alejandro Mayoralgo Albert Elementary School along Dapitan Street, Barangay 521, Sampaloc, named after the first Filipino Undersecretary of Public Instruction (b. September 1, 1896) opened on April 8, 2024. The 10-story DDAES has 234 air-conditioned classrooms, a 334 seating capacity gymnasium, 72 comfort rooms, 28 offices, 10 elevators, library, roofdeck, outdoor basketball courts, football field and 364-seat capacity auditorium on the eighth floor.

==Transportation==

Sampaloc is the hub of major national bus transportation carriers. Among the bus companies in Sampaloc with their terminal are: Fariñas Transit Company, GV Florida Transport, Victory Liner, Partas, Maria De Leon, RCJ Trans, RCJ Lines, Five Star Bus Company, Northern Luzon Bus Line and Dalin liner and other southern Luzon buses.

Sampaloc is served by two Philippine National Railways stations: Laon Laan and España station. It is also served by the Legarda station of the LRT Line 2 to the south.

Main thoroughfares in Sampaloc are S.H. Loyola (formerly Lepanto), Vicente Cruz, M. De La Fuente, P. Florentino, Blumentritt, Aurora Boulevard, Dapitan, Laon Laan, Dimasalang, Maria Clara, Maceda, Padre Campa, Padre Noval, Tomas Earnshaw (Bustillos), Legarda, Gastambide, Recto Avenue, Lerma, Nicanor Reyes (Morayta), Lacson Avenue and España Boulevard. The elevated NLEX Connector also cuts through Sampaloc with two exits in the district at España and Magsaysay.

<doc id="455721" wikidata="Q2184812" url="?curid=455721" title="Drumlanrig Castle">
<text>Drumlanrig Castle is situated on the Queensberry Estate in Dumfries and Galloway, Scotland. The category A listed castle is the Dumfriesshire home of the Duke of Buccleuch and Queensberry. As of September 2023, the castle itself is open to the public during very limited times of the year, with the surroundings, such as the stableyard and adventure playground being open nearly all year round. Walking, hiking, and cycling routes are open all year long, unless officially closed due to unforeseen circumstances, such as in 2021 due damage inflicted by Storm Arwen.

==Construction==
The &#x27;Pink Palace&#x27; of Drumlanrig, constructed between 1679 and 1689 from distinctive pink sandstone, is an example of late 17th-century Renaissance architecture. The first Duke of Queensberry, William Douglas, had the castle built on the site of an ancient Douglas stronghold overlooking the Nith Valley. The castle has 120 rooms, 17 turrets and four towers.

In 1984, aerial photography revealed the outline of a substantial Roman fort some to the southeast of Drumlanrig Castle. The fort was partially excavated in 2004 by the &quot;Time Team&quot; television programme.

==Gardens==

A formal garden was created between 1675 and 1697 to the principles of the architect Sir William Bruce and appear to be similar to the garden plans for Kinross House and Balcaskie. The gardens were enclosed by stone walls and included six stone pavilions each with lead ogee roofs matching the main building. Water features in the garden included a &quot;clanging clock&quot;. In 1695 when the second duke inherited the estate he employed a James Wood son of Hew Wood of Hamilton as a gardener, and sent him to London in 1696 for further training. He failed to return and the duke instead employed a Dutch gardener named Cornelius van Nerven. In 1698 a summer house and water cascades were added. The third duke employed a David Low as gardener from 1714 to 1747. This period had the creation of more landscape features plus a bowling green (an early example of such). During this period Sir John Clerk of Penicuik designed the water cascades which were added 1728 to 1732.

Following the death of David Low, the head gardener, in 1747, the number of gardeners was reduced to eight to ten men, and the new head gardener was paid less than Low. The gardens were allowed to be less maintained and by 1810 there was a decision made to remove the formal gardens.

==Art collection==
The castle is home to part of the Buccleuch art collection which includes Rembrandt&#x27;s &quot;An Old Woman Reading&quot;, and Leonardo da Vinci&#x27;s &quot;Madonna of the Yarnwinder&quot;, which was stolen in 2003 and returned in 2007 after being found in Glasgow, and many other paintings, tapestries and objects of art. The &quot;Madonna of the Yarnwinder&quot; is currently on loan at the Scottish National Gallery.

== Surrounding Attractions ==
The castle features attractions for both tourists and local residents, situated in the former stable yard, and in an off-section of the rear gardens. These include the Stableyard Studios with a range of local businesses, a tearoom and an adventure playground.

== Etymology ==
The earliest record for Drumlanrig is from 1384, spelled &quot;Drumlangryg&quot;. There are a number of possible etymologies for the name. It may represent Cumbric &quot;drum&quot; &#x27;ridge&#x27; + &quot;-lanerc&quot; &#x27;small area of cleared woodland&#x27;. However, the first element may also be Gaelic &quot;druim &quot;&#x27;ridge&#x27;, either added to a Cumbric name or to Scots &quot;*lang-rigg&quot; &#x27;long ridge&#x27;.

<doc id="455725" wikidata="Q239477" url="?curid=455725" title="Cliffs of Moher">
<text>The Cliffs of Moher (; ) are sea cliffs located at the southwestern edge of the Burren region in County Clare, Ireland. They run for about . At their southern end, they rise above the Atlantic Ocean at Hag&#x27;s Head, and, to the north, they reach their maximum height of just north of O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s Tower, a round stone tower near the midpoint of the cliffs, built in 1835 by Sir Cornelius O&#x27;Brien, then continue at lower heights. The closest settlements are the villages of Liscannor to the south, and Doolin to the north.

From the cliffs, and from atop the tower, visitors can see the Aran Islands in Galway Bay, the Maumturks and Twelve Pins mountain ranges to the north in County Galway, and Loop Head to the south. The cliffs rank among the most visited tourist sites in Ireland, with around 1.5 million visits per year.

==Name==

The cliffs take their name from an old promontory fort called &quot;Mothar&quot; or &quot;Moher&quot;, which once stood on Hag&#x27;s Head, the southernmost point of the cliffed coast, now the site of Moher Tower. The writer Thomas Johnson Westropp referred to it in 1905 as &quot;Moher Uí Ruis&quot; or &quot;Moher Uí Ruidhin&quot;. The fort still stood in 1780 and is mentioned in an account from John Lloyd&#x27;s &quot;A&quot; &quot;Short Tour of Clare&quot; (1780). It was demolished in 1808 to provide material for a lookout/telegraph tower that was intended to provide warning in case of a French invasion during the Napoleonic wars.

==Tourism==
The cliffs are one of the most popular tourist destinations in Ireland and topped a list of attractions in 2006 by receiving almost one million visitors at the official visitor centre. With additional visitors to other locales included there are around 1.5 million a year. In 2022, approximately 1.1 million visited the Cliffs of Moher, with 41% arriving from the U.S. Since 2011, they have formed a part of the Burren and Cliffs of Moher Geopark, one of a family of geotourism destinations throughout Europe that are members of the European Geoparks Network and also recognized by UNESCO. The cliffs are also a &quot;signature point&quot; on the official Wild Atlantic Way tourist trail.

While the cliffs can be accessed at multiple points, and there is an Cliff Walk, the majority of visitors come to the official visitor centre.

===Visitor centre===

In the 1990s the local authority, Clare County Council, initiated development plans to enable visitors to experience the cliffs without significant intrusive man-made amenities. In keeping with this approach, a modern visitor centre, the Cliffs of Moher Visitor Experience, was built into a hillside approaching the cliffs. The centre was planned to be environmentally sensitive in its use of renewable energy systems including geothermal heating and cooling, solar panels, and grey water recycling.

The €32 million facility was planned and built over a 17-year period and officially opened in February 2007. Exhibits include interactive media displays covering the geology, history, flora and fauna of the cliffs. A large multimedia screen displays a bird&#x27;s-eye view from the cliffs, as well as video from the underwater caves below the cliffs. There are also two cafés and several shops.

====Visitor numbers====
The visitor experience recorded 1,427,000 visits in 2016, up 14% on 2015, and up 52% in off-peak December, for example. In 2017 the Cliffs of Moher was the second most popular &#x27;fee charging&#x27; tourist attraction in the country with 1,527,000 visitors. This increased again by 3.8% in 2018 to 1,580,010 visitors.

The nature and speed of increase in visitor numbers has led to some capacity problems at peak times and in peak season. To counter this, visitors are increasingly encouraged to come at other times, with discounts given to coach operators who book for off-peak slots, and late opening of the centre introduced for July and much of August. Later-arriving visitors have also been facilitated by the fitting of automatically opening exit gates from the official car parking facilities.

====Recognition====
The Cliffs of Moher Visitor Experience won an award in the Interpret Britain &amp; Ireland Awards 2007 awarded by the Association of Heritage Interpretation (AHI). Although the award was specifically for the Atlantic Edge exhibition, the AHI assessed the entire visitor centre and site. The citation stated that the entire visitor centre was &quot;one of the best facilities that the judges had ever seen.&quot;

===Viewing===
The official Cliffs of Moher Coastal Walk runs for 18 km, from Hag&#x27;s Head to Doolin, passing the Visitor Centre and O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s Tower.

There are two paths near the visitor centre, the official one being set back a little for safety, while an unofficial path runs closer to the edge. In July 2016, the so-called Cliff Walk, outside the official Cliffs of Moher amenities, was temporarily closed because of the risk of rock falls. People were warned to stay on the official path further off the cliff edge instead of the unofficial seaside trail. Injury and even casualties from visitors straying off the trail continued to be a problem despite signage and other prevention initiatives. In February 2025, the coastal walking trail was closed due to these safety issues.

Separate ferry trips also allow tourists to view the cliffs from sea level, and at certain times fixed-wing aircraft from Connemara Airport also provide a viewing opportunity.

==Geology and wildlife==

The cliffs consist mainly of beds of Namurian shale and sandstone, and the oldest rocks are at the bottom of the cliffs. During the time of their formation between 313 and 326 million years ago, a river dumped sand, silt and clay into an ancient marine basin. Over millions of years, the sediments collecting at the mouth of this ancient delta were compacted and lithified into the sedimentary strata preserved in the now-exposed cliffs. The area is considered a geologic laboratory that preserves a record of deltaic deposition in deep water. Individual strata vary in thickness from just a few centimetres to several metres, each representing a specific depositional event in the history of the delta. In aggregate, up to 200 metres of sedimentary rocks are exposed in the Cliffs of Moher. Trace fossils are abundant, comprising two main types: (1) scolicia or worming trails, which are interpreted as feeding trails left by as-yet-unidentified invertebrates, and (2) burrow marks, which are circular features preserved as casts of burrows once occupied by as-yet-unidentified marine creatures. Ripple marks are preserved in some stones.

Today the cliffs are subject to erosion by wave action, which undermines the base of support causing the cliff to collapse under its own weight. This process creates a variety of coastal landforms characteristic of erosional coasts such as sea caves, sea stacks, and sea stumps. Branaunmore, a 67-metre high sea stack at the foot of the Cliffs of Moher below O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s Tower, was once part of the cliffs, but coastal erosion gradually removed the layers of rock that joined it with the mainland. A large sea arch can also be seen at Hag&#x27;s Head below the Napoleonic signal tower and many smaller sea arches can be seen from sea level.

It is possible to see 300-million-year-old river channels cutting through, forming unconformities at the base of the cliffs.

At peak season, there are an estimated 30,000 pairs of birds living on the cliffs, representing more than 20 species. These include Atlantic puffins, which live in large colonies at isolated parts of the cliffs and on the small Goat Island, and razorbills.
The site is an Important Bird Area.

A wide range of sea life can also be seen, from grey seals through porpoises, dolphins, minke whales and basking sharks, as well as, occasionally, sunfish. On land, feral goats, foxes, badgers and the Irish hare are found, along with various breeds of farm cattle.

==Popular culture==
The Cliffs of Moher have appeared in numerous media. In cinema, the cliffs have appeared in several films, including &quot;The Princess Bride&quot; (1987) (as the filming location for &quot;The Cliffs of Insanity&quot;), &quot;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince&quot; (2009) (as the filming location for where Harry Potter and Professor Dumbledore are looking for a horcrux in a sea cave), &quot;Leap Year&quot; (2010) and &quot;Irish Wish&quot; (2024). The cliffs are mentioned in the Martin Scorsese film &quot;Bringing Out the Dead&quot; (1999) and are noted in the 2008 documentary &quot;Waveriders&quot; as the location of a large surfing wave known as &quot;Aileens&quot;.

In music, the cliffs have been the scene for music videos, including Maroon 5&#x27;s &quot;Runaway&quot;, Westlife&#x27;s &quot;My Love&quot;, and Rich Mullins&#x27; &quot;The Color Green&quot;. In 1999, most of singer Dusty Springfield&#x27;s ashes were scattered at the cliffs by her brother Tom. There is also an Irish fiddle tune called &quot;The Cliffs of Moher.&quot;

==Transport==
Bus Éireann route 350 links the Cliffs of Moher to several locations: Ennis, Ennistymon, Doolin, Lisdoonvarna, Kinvara and Galway. This service includes a number of journeys each way daily. There is also a privately operated shuttle bus that serves the site from Doolin.

<doc id="455726" wikidata="Q1637323" url="?curid=455726" title="Marcos Engineering">
<text>Marcos Engineering was a British sports car manufacturer. The name derives from the surnames of founders Jem &quot;Mar&quot;sh and Frank &quot;Cos&quot;tin.

==History==
Marcos was founded in Dolgellau, North Wales, in 1959, by Speedex cars&#x27; Jem Marsh with aerodynamicist Frank Costin. Costin had earlier worked on the de Havilland Mosquito fighter-bombers and from there he got the idea to use plywood for the chassis. The company moved to a converted mill in Bradford on Avon, Wiltshire, in 1963; in 1971 they relocated to a £125,000 purpose-built factory at nearby Westbury.

Problems with exporting cars to the US and the move to the expensive new premises led to financial troubles, and in 1971 Marcos went out of business. In July 1971 it was reported that the Rob Walker Group of Companies, a principal dealer, had acquired the stocks and assets and established a new company, Marcos Ltd. The new owners said production would continue, albeit, at least in the short term, only for the UK market, but it is not clear whether any additional cars were built. Although Marcos dealers in the UK had been heavily discounting new cars since the end of 1970, and &quot;Motor&quot; magazine reported at the time of the collapse that the company&#x27;s stock of 35 unsold cars in the United States had to be &quot;liquidated&quot;, there may have been a substantial stock of new cars without buyers.

In June 1972, what was described as &quot;a cash jumble sale of Marcos bits – prototype and shop soiled components, benches, tools...&quot; took place at the &quot;old Marcos Cars factory&quot; at Westbury. The sale was occasioned by the company&#x27;s reorganisation and move to a smaller factory.

Marsh stayed in the car business, and bought back the rights to the Marcos name in 1976. In 1981 the brand was relaunched with the Marcos V6 coupé, which was sold in kit form. The design evolved to incorporate both Rover and Ford V8 engines, as well as moving from kit cars to entirely factory-built cars (from 1992), before the company went bankrupt again in 2000.

Canadian entrepreneur Tony Stelliga formed Marcos Engineering with Marsh, and revived production in 2002. Race car production was relocated to the Netherlands while road car production moved to Kenilworth, Warwickshire, England. By 2005, most of the designers from near-to-bankrupt TVR had joined the company.

On 9 October 2007 it was again announced that Marcos would cease production and go into voluntary liquidation. The design property rights, drawings, jigs and car history files were bought by Marcos Heritage Spares Ltd, owned by Rory MacMath, who had worked closely with Marsh on all the Marcos cars.

== GT Xylon, Luton Gullwing; fastback GT==
Their first car, the Xylon, which had gullwing doors and a windscreen in four panels, was nicknamed the &quot;ugly duckling&quot;. A total of nine, aimed at 750 Motor Club events, were built in 1959 and 1960. For production the body was made less radical but initially retained the gullwing doors. It was powered by a choice of Ford engines varying from 997 to 1498 cc and had Standard 10 and Triumph Herald steering and suspension components. Thirty-nine were made up to 1963.
In 1961, brothers Dennis Adams and Peter Adams started working with Marcos and introduced several changes to the original design. The Marcos Luton gullwing and the spyder were introduced in November 1961. This design was again reworked, becoming the Marcos fastback GT, which was displayed at the London Racing Car Show in 1963. The chassis was fabricated from laminated 3 mm thick sheets of marine plywood, giving the cars strong monocoques and low weights (the GT was internationally homologated with 475 kg), so they performed well in sportscar competition. Most early Marcos models competed in national and international events.

==Marcos 1800GT==

In 1964 the Marcos 1800 GT was introduced, using the four-cylinder Volvo B18 engine with overdrive gearbox and De Dion rear axle. This was to be the design that would become familiar to sports car enthusiasts for more than 30 years, even though the original plywood chassis was later replaced by a steel chassis. A variety of other engines, mostly from Ford, but also from Triumph and Volvo, became available over the years. In 1966 the GT was changed to Ford engines of originally 1500 cc, later 1650 and 1600 cc, and a coil-sprung live rear axle. In 1968 the Ford Essex V6 engine from the Capri Mk1 was added. In 1969 the plywood chassis was replaced by steel, which shortened production time and saved on cost, and the Ford Essex V4 engine replaced the earlier inline-fours. In 1971 a few cars with Triumph 2.5-litre straight-sixes were built, to use up engines from the slow selling Mantis. As the bonnet was a close fit over the engine, this variety of engine resulted in a corresponding variation in the bonnet design, particularly as regards changes designed to clear engine air intakes, often the only external sign of the type of engine fitted.

The Ford V6 version achieved over on test and the Volvo-engined model was not far behind it, but the heavy cast-iron engines increased nose-weight in comparison to the four-cylinder variants. From 1970 cars for the North American markets received Volvo&#x27;s inline-six cylinder, three-litre engines coupled to Borg-Warner automatic transmissions. These have tubular steel space frames, a higher ride height and no headlight covers, to achieve US road certification. Delays and problems with the federalised cars, together with the development costs of the Mantis, led the company to close its doors for the first time.

The Marcos intellectual rights, including jigs, build files and logos were bought by Marcos director Rory MacMath and are now working under the title &quot;Marcos Heritage Spares&quot; as a restoration and parts company for Marcos Cars (see contact details below for website).

==Mini Marcos==
The front-wheel drive Mini Marcos, designed by Malcolm Newell, was introduced in 1965. With a fibreglass monocoque body, Mini subframes and suspension, and a wheelbase of , it is powered by a transversely mounted Mini A-series engine driving the front wheels. A French-entered example came 15th overall in the 1966 Le Mans race, the only British car to finish.

When Marcos stopped making the car in about 1975, another company produced updated versions as the &quot;Midas&quot;. Cars were also made under licence in South Africa, Australia and Ireland.

Revived in 1991 for the Japanese market, production continued until 1995. A total of over 1300 Mini Marcos cars have been sold in kit form and as complete cars.

After the demise of Marcos Sales Limited, the Mini Marcos moulds were acquired by Marcos Heritage Spares, who relaunched the car in 2005 as the Marcos Heritage Mk. VI and Mk. VI GT.

== Marcos Mantis ==
In 1968 came the first Mantis, the Mantis XP. A racing car designed for the Group 6 Prototype category, it was powered by a mid-mounted Repco V8 engine. Like earlier Marcos cars it used a plywood monocoque chassis, albeit different from that of the GT. Only one car was made, and its only race was the 1968 1,000 km event at Spa, where it retired with electrical problems in heavy rain. Originally Marcos intended to race it in the 1968 Le Mans, but that was postponed from June to September, and by then the car was in America, fitted with a Buick V8 engine (from which the Rover V8 engine was derived).

A full restoration of the XP was completed in 2008. Now based in America, it has visited the UK for the Marcos 50th anniversary celebrations and the Goodwood Festival of Speed.
The next Mantis, the four-seater M70, was launched in 1970 and had a fuel-injected 2.5-litre Triumph TR6 six-cylinder injected engine mated to a four-speed gearbox. The promotional brochure says the styling &quot;gives high all round visibility&quot;, and &quot;a low centre of gravity together with an extremely wide track ensures superb roadholding. The luxurious interior seats four in comfort, and the boot, with a capacity of 10 cubic feet, makes the Mantis ideal for the man who is going places and wants to travel in style&quot;.

Thirty-two were sold before the company went into liquidation in 1972. Autotune acquired the moulds and produced a few more cars in the mid-1980s as &quot;Autotune Mirages&quot;.

==Marcos returns==

Jem Marsh resurrected the Marcos brand in 1981, offering the previous GT cars as kits. Engine options included Ford&#x27;s 3.0 Essex V6, 2.8 Cologne V6, 1600 Crossflow, 2.0 Pinto and 2.0 V4s, plus Triumph&#x27;s 2.0 and 2.5 straight sixes. About 130 kits were sold up to 1989.

=== Marcos Mantula, Spyder and Martina ===

In 1983 the Marcos Mantula was introduced, externally very similar to the old GT, but now powered by a 3.5-litre Rover V8 with a 5-speed gearbox producing at 5280 rpm and of torque at 4000 rpm. This alloy engine weighed less than the previous six-cylinder cast-iron units, reducing overall weight to about 900 kg and making the car competitive against other Rover-powered sports cars such as TVR and Morgan. When tested by Motorweek, the Mantula completed 0-60 mph (97 km/h) in 5.7 seconds, with a top speed of . The engine evolved into the Rover Vitesse EFi engine, and later Mantulas were fitted with the 3.9 EFi. In 1986 the model was made available as a convertible, the Marcos Spyder, which would outsell the coupés in later production. 1989 saw the introduction of independent rear suspension, together with the Ford Sierra&#x27;s 7&quot; differential and rear disc brakes. The independent suspension allowed a full-width boot and the relocation of the battery and heater/air conditioning. A total of 170 coupés and 119 Spyders were produced.

Launched in 1991, the Marcos Martina was externally very similar to the Mantula, but with flared front wheel arches. It used the Ford Cortina&#x27;s 2-litre four-cylinder engine, steering and suspension, and approximately 80 were produced. Originally available as kits or factory-built, the cars were all factory-built from 1992. Production of the Mantula and Martina ceased in 1993.

=== Marcos Mantara, Mantara GTS and LM cars===

In 1992 Marcos left the kit car business, all cars from this point onwards being factory built, and launched the Marcos Mantara which was sold through dealers in limited numbers. The main difference between the Mantara and the Mantula was the adoption of MacPherson strut front suspension in place of the Triumph suspension and associated trunnions. This change resulted in a wider front track, different bonnet, and flared front arches. The rear wheel arches and rear lights were also changed to give the car a more modern appearance. Power steering was also available for the first time. The Mantara was powered as standard by a 3.9-litre fuel injected Rover V8 or a 4.6-litre Rover V8 as an optional alternative.

The Marcos GTS was a version of the Mantara powered by the 2-litre Rover Tomcat engine, on request of the Italian distributor Martes Spider Cars. The top version was the turbo version. The GTS version of the Mantara had a slightly different bonnet incorporating much smoother lines, flared-in headlamps, and a deeper spoiler, which was used on the later Mantaray model. A handful of late Mantara V8&#x27;s were produced with the same bonnet as the 2.0 litre GTS.
For a return to GT racing, a range of modified Mantaras was also produced in the LM (Le Mans) versions. To qualify as a production vehicle, a limited number of road going cars were also made. Several versions of the LM were made such as the LM400 (with a Rover 3.9-litre V8 engine), LM500 (Rover 5-litre V8) and LM600 (6-litre Chevrolet small-block V8). Only 30 road-going LM cars were ever built, and of these only one was a road-going LM600.

=== Marcos Mantis ===
In 1997 the Mantis name was re-used on a 2-seater coupé or convertible road car based on the LM series powered by the 4.6-litre all-aluminium quad-cam Ford &#x27;Modular&#x27; engine producing and capable of . To accommodate the engine the bonnet of the Mantis was significantly remodelled from the previous LM range (that used the Rover V8), and the upper chassis rails in the engine bay were widened. Price for the Mantis was £46,883.

In 1998 it was decided to supercharge the engine to produce one of the few British production sports car with over , this being named the Mantis GT. It was first sold in Italy by Martes Spider Cars. Using a Vortech supercharger and intercooler the Mantis GT engine produced , which could accelerate the car from 0–60 mph in 3.7 seconds. Price for the Mantis GT was £64,331.

Production of the Mantis was 51 cars, with 16 being the supercharged GT version (this does not include the Mantis Challenge race cars).

=== Marcos Mantaray ===
In 1997 the Mantara evolved into the Marcos Mantaray, with the re-styled bonnet from the Mantara GTS and with a new shape rear-end. Mechanically the car was identical to the Mantara. It was offered with 4.0 and 4.6-litre Rover V8 as well as the 2-litre, and 2-litre turbo Rover Tomcat engines. Only 11 were made with the 4.0-litre, and seven with the 4.6-litre engine. Total factory production was 26, plus one car in chassis/body component form.

=== Marcos Marcasite ===

In 2002, after a break in production caused by bankruptcy, a new company (Marcos Engineering Ltd) was launched with Jem Marsh as vice-chairman, and with the financial backing of Canadian Tony Stelliga, to manufacture the Marcasite TS250 with a 2.5-litre Ford V6 followed in 2003 by the 5-litre Rover V8-powered TS500. The 2002 price of the TS250 was £29,744 +VAT, with options such as air-conditioning (£1634), full leather interior (£1626) and Hydratrak differential (£360). Other unpriced options included an elm or walnut veneer dashboard, and a newly designed hard top.

=== Marcos TSO ===

The Marcos TSO was launched in 2004 with a Chevrolet V8 engine in either or versions. The car&#x27;s components were CAD ,designed in England and its chassis engineering was completed by Prodrive. These vehicles were produced by Tony Stelliga of Marcos.

Also in 2004, the 5.7-litre Chevrolet Corvette (LS1) V8 TSO GT was announced, but solely for the Australian market. It was joined in 2005 by the GT2 for the European market.

In 2006 Tony Stelliga announced the TSO GTC, a modified version of the current TSO with a racing suspension, racing brakes and a rear diffuser. The car continues on with its Chevrolet-sourced V8, but there was also a Performance Pack available as well. With the extra power from the Performance Pack the TSO GTC accelerated to in 4.1 seconds and to in 8.5 seconds. With the bigger AP Racing brakes, the TSO GTC delivered a 0–100–0 time of 12.9 seconds, and the extra power allowed it to accelerate from 50 to in just 2.1 seconds. Its top speed was over .

2 prototypes and 7 production models cars exist. Tony Stelliga&#x27;s company went into liquidation in October 2007.

=== Marcos Spirit 220 ===
In 2010, Marcos Cars Limited, Marcos Engineering Limited, and the original Marcos Logo were purchased and registered by Tony Brown, who intends on relaunching the brand in the United Kingdom. 

A mid-engine prototype was launched in 2013. The design was a major move away from the original front-engined designs. However, Jem Marsh was consulted during the development process. Both he and Dennis Adams gave their approval. The car has since been refined and undergone a few design changes in light of further testing.

== Racing history ==

=== Wooden wonders ===
Marcos started out with race cars, with the first Xylon cars being built specifically for the 750 motor club races. Among the drivers were Jackie Stewart, Bill Moss, John Sutton, Jack Gates, John Mitchell and Jackie Oliver, as well as Jem Marsh. The young Jackie Stewart achieved 4 victories in 1961, while Bill Moss managed 9 victories in 10 starts. John Sutton won the 1961 Autosport Championship, and together with Jack Gates and John Mitchell, Marcos won the team prize.

When the car went into production as the Luton Gullwing many examples were bought for racing. In 1962 Stephen Minoprio was the Autosport 1000cc GT Champion in his Gullwing – setting 7 lap records in the process.

The Gullwing in turn evolved into the GT Fastback, also known as the &#x27;Breadvan&#x27;. All 18 fastbacks made in 1963 went into racing, and like the Xylon and Gullwing they were FIA homologated in the GT category. However, without the gull wing doors, the fastbacks were awkward to get in and out of. Drivers included Jackie Oliver, Terry Sanger, and Derek Bell, and Jem Marsh of course. The sales brochure for the Fastback included options for 5 speed gearbox (Hewland), dry sump, 997cc (84 to 88 bhp) and 1148cc (102 to 104 bhp) full race engines, light alloy bellhousing, 72-litre fuel tank (for endurance racing), lightweight alloy oil cooler, and perspex windscreen (saving 15 lbs).

The successor Marcos coupé road cars were popular track/day cars, and several were raced in the BARC and BRSCC Modsports championships, including Jonathan Palmer taking the 1977 Modsport championship in a V6. Mark Hales also successfully raced a 1967 wooden chassis V6 in the Modsports class. The 1800 Volvo engined cars are accepted for historic racing under FIA Appendix K, where they are very competitive, and there are still wooden chassis Ford-engined cars being raced. The fact that the wooden chassis can take the stresses of racing for so many years shows what a successful design it was.

=== Mini Marcos ===
The Mini Marcos is also a very successful car on the race track. It made its debut at a rain soaked Castle Combe race track on 25 September 1965. Driven by Geoff Mabbs, it lapped all but one car to win the BRSCC race by 81 seconds at an average of 76 mph.

In 1966 a French Mini Marcos, with Marcos support, was the only British car to complete the Le Mans 24-hour race. For the 1967 Le Mans, Marcos entered their own Mini-Marcos (drivers were Marsh and Chris Lawrence). The car was clocked at 141 mph on the Mulsanne Straight in the April test, but failed to finish the race because of an oil pump failure. The same car was more successful in the Kyalami 9-hour race in Nov 1967, when Marsh and Brian Raubenheimer finished 15th, it appeared again in the 1968 race but did not finish.

Mini Marcos cars were raced widely, especially as a budget endurance race car, but also in local championships in many countries including Modsports in the UK. Mini-Marcos was also the chosen car for the &quot;First Ladies International Race Team&quot; (FLIRT), which competed at events such as the Nurburgring 1000 km race in May 1967, where they retired, the Grand Premio del Mugello in July 1967, coming 37th, and the Nürburgring 500 km race in September 1967 where two cars were fielded with Jackie Bond-Smith coming in 21st and 4th in class, and Joey Cook retiring.

=== XP prototype ===

The XP prototype was intended for the 1968 Le Mans. It was assembled with a stressed plywood monocoque chassis and Cooper suspension, and powered by a Brabham Formula 1 engine, later replaced by a Buick 215 V8. Raced at Spa as a shakedown test, it was one of many cars that retired with electrical problems in heavy rain. This proved to be its only race. Le Mans was postponed that year and the XP went to America.

=== Second generation race cars ===

After the company&#x27;s resurrection in 1981 the emphasis was on road cars, although price lists for the early V8 cars included a competition specification for &quot;circuit racing, hill climbs and sprints&quot;. Competition options include FIA-approved roll-over bar, limited-slip differential, rose-jointed suspension and full harnesses.

In October 1993 Marcos unveiled its new competition car and announced a return to GT racing, including Le Mans. Based on the Mantara, the cars were designated LM400, LM500 and LM600. After some successes in the British GT championship in 1994, Marcos won it in 1995, 1996 and 2000. Two cars also competed at Le Mans in 1995. Both suffered electrical faults, one retiring and the other (driven by David Leslie, François Migault, and Jem Marsh&#x27;s son Chris) finishing second to last, having completed 114 laps fewer than the winning McLaren F1 GTR as its electrical problem stranded it on the Mulsanne Straight for two hours soon after the start.

The year 1998 saw the launch of the Dunlop-sponsored Mantis Challenge, a one-make race series for the coupé version of the Mantis road car with a dry-sump version of its 4.6-litre quad-cam Ford Modular V8 engine. Complete with FIA roll-cage the cars weighed 950 kg. Entries were few in 1998, and the cars were accepted for the Privilege GT series as GT2, and the French GT series as GT3, winning one of the races in France. In 1999 the field was stronger, and the Dutch Mantis Challenge was also strong, and some races combined both. The 1999 UK series was won by Edward Horner, and the Dutch series by Robert Knook.

A total of 38 Mantis Challenge cars were built, but the series did not continue beyond 1999, after the GT Championship introduced the GT3 class. Many are still raced, including in the British Endurance Championship (Britcar), and at least one has been converted for road use.

In 2000, the Marcos racing business was sold to longtime GT sponsor Eurotech, a Dutch engineering firm. By that time, all Marcos racing cars and road car chassis were built in the Netherlands, with road car assembly completed in Westbury by a much-reduced staff.

An LM600 driven by Cor Euser competed in the Dutch Supercar Challenge and won the GT Championship in 2002 and 2004, and again in 2009, the 50th anniversary of the founding of Marcos. Euser also has the license to manufacture racing cars, and has done so with a GT3-spec Marcos Mantis, and did the same in a modified Marcos Mantis, named the Marcorelly. He has raced both of these cars in the Benelux-based Supercar Challenge.

<doc id="455728" wikidata="Q6131461" url="?curid=455728" title="United Game Artists">
<text>(UGA) was a subsidiary of Sega headquartered in Shibuya, Tokyo, Japan. Established in 2000, UGA was headed by Tetsuya Mizuguchi, who had previously worked at the Sega AM3 division. It is known for developing the &quot;Space Channel 5&quot; series and &quot;Rez&quot;.

In 1996, Mizuguchi and &quot;Sega Rally Championship&quot; director Kenji Sasaki left AM3 to form AM Annex, and would go on to develop arcade games such as &quot;Sega Touring Car Championship&quot; and &quot;Sega Rally 2&quot;. Mizuguchi later left Sasaki&#x27;s team to form another division briefly known as Sega Consumer Development 4 (CS4), later becoming Research and Development #9 (R&amp;D #9, or AM9). In 2000, the division was spun off into United Game Artists, a wholly owned subsidiary of Sega, with Mizuguchi acting as CEO. In 2003, due to financial issues, UGA was merged into Sonic Team, another of Sega&#x27;s subsidiary companies. Mizuguchi subsequently left Sega in October of that year.

Several games developed by United Game Artists are notable for their reception. &quot;Space Channel 5&quot; is frequently credited with being a unique concept that helped bring about music-based video games. &quot;Rez&quot; is a highly well received title critically.

==History==

Tetsuya Mizuguchi joined Sega in 1990 as a designer of arcade cabinets. Prior to entering the video game industry, Mizuguchi majored in literature at Nihon University&#x27;s Faculty of Arts. Asked how he chose a career in video games, he explained, &quot;I preferred doing something in relation to human senses or entertainment - something more in relation with human nature, a field where I could do some research. ... Unlike the arts, where it is often a matter of taste whether something is good or not, creating good interactive entertainment is more easily definable. I chose Sega because it was using new technology and I was able to study things like human movements.&quot; Mizuguchi has expressed that he originally had no interest in making video games and wanted to be involved in other areas of entertainment, including creating theme parks and attractions. During his time at Sega, Mizuguchi developed an interactive &#x27;ride&#x27; titled &quot;Megalopolis&quot; combining then-embryonic 3D polygonal graphics and CGI with the physical experience of Sega&#x27;s hydraulic &#x27;AS-1&#x27; motion simulator. He went on to produce the racing simulator &quot;Sega Rally Championship&quot; and &quot;Manx TT Super Bike&quot;.

In 1996, while working as a producer for Sega&#x27;s AM3 division, Mizuguchi met with Hisashi Suzuki, the manager of the division. He and Mizuguchi agreed to create a new department separate from AM3 that would be called AM Annex. Mizuguchi selected the initial team himself, a team of six or seven people that would later grow in number. The first game AM Annex began to develop was &quot;Sega Touring Car Championship&quot; on the Model 2 arcade board, and Mizuguchi also contributed to &quot;Sega Rally 2&quot;. According to Hisao Oguchi, later head of AM3, Mizuguchi and developer Kenji Sasaki had departed AM3 with the team of &quot;Sega Rally Championship&quot;, and Mizuguchi later chose to leave Sasaki after being granted their own AM department and set up development in Shibuya. Sasaki became head of AM5, later renamed Sega Rosso.
Mizuguchi&#x27;s department in Shibuya would be known as Sega Consumer Development 4 (CS4) and Sega Research and Development #9 (R&amp;D #9), also known as AM9. During this time, the department developed &quot;Space Channel 5&quot; for the Dreamcast. Mizuguchi had been tasked by Sega with creating a video game that would have a broad enough appeal to draw in casual female gamers. In order to achieve this, Mizuguchi conducted interviews with girls to find out what they liked. He insists that it is difficult to create a game that appeals to both genders, due to different desires in games. During development of &quot;Space Channel 5&quot;, Mizuguchi noted one stage in development where the game was &quot;cool, but not so fun&quot;, and so he tried to introduce elements inspired by Stomp. In order to lighten the mood with his staff, Mizuguchi invited a mime artist to visit the department and help his team to loosen up.

In 2000, Sega separated its development divisions into subsidiary companies, fully owned by Sega. R&amp;D #9 became United Game Artists (UGA), and Mizuguchi was installed as its CEO. According to Mizuguchi, the name was one he wanted to use for a video game studio for some period of time. Mizuguchi set a goal with UGA to create games for a worldwide audience, but not with any particular genre in mind. In transitioning from racing games to music-based games, Mizuguchi noted that while racing games were a good way to show off CGI graphics, the release of the Dreamcast gave opportunities to engineer better music, and he wanted to incorporate interactivity with music in games.

UGA&#x27;s next title would be &quot;Rez&quot;, a musical rail shooter. Mizuguchi initially considered the concept of a video game as an art form after playing &quot;Xenon 2 Megablast&quot;. Later, while traveling Europe in 1997, Mizuguchi had been taken to the Street Parade in Zurich, during which there was a large electronic dance music concert attended by around 300,000 people. Mizuguchi was taken in by the sights and sounds around him and recognized how this experience was similar to the inspiration that Wassily Kandinsky, a Russian painter, had channeled to &quot;[paint] a canvas of the sounds that he saw&quot;. He saw this tie to his previous ideas and envisioned a game where one would shoot down enemies in time to the beat of music that would put the player into a trance, using a theme of synesthesia, forming the basis of &quot;Rez&quot;. Mizuguchi and his team began to research how to structure this game, visiting clubs and attending Taiko drumming festivals. On pitching &quot;Rez&quot; to Sega executives, Mizuguchi has expressed that presenting the game was difficult until management was given the opportunity to try the game, due to difficulty in describing the game&#x27;s concept in words. &quot;Rez&quot; was well received upon release, as were its re-releases on later consoles.

The final release for UGA would be &quot;Space Channel 5: Part 2&quot;. According to Mizuguchi, despite low sales of the original game, &quot;Part 2&quot; was easier to pitch than &quot;Rez&quot; had been due to there being an established base of fans of the original, as well as the prominence of mobile phones and MTV. &quot;Part 2&quot; was designed using real-time graphics instead of the pre-rendered backgrounds of the original game in order to make the game appear more like a movie. &quot;Space Channel 5: Part 2&quot; was released in Europe and Japan, but would not make its debut in the United States until the release of the compilation &quot;Space Channel 5 Special Edition&quot; for the PlayStation 2.

In September 2003, Sega performed an internal restructuring of its staff. Among these changes was the dissolution of United Game Artists and the transfer of its members into Sonic Team. The following month, Mizuguchi left Sega. According to Mizuguchi on his decision, &quot;At that time, I had two choices, basically. One was to adjust with the company, or the company adjusts to me, but the latter was impossible. So I decided to leave Sega. To me, I think this is a very healthy choice, because I get to do my own games now.&quot; Mizuguchi would go on to found Q Entertainment. He has expressed that he would be open to working with Sega again.

==Reception==
The titles developed by Mizuguchi&#x27;s teams at Sega and United Game Artists are renowned for their development and uniqueness. The &quot;Sega Rally&quot; series retained a level of popularity over a decade after its release, resulting in the later development of &quot;Sega Rally 2006&quot;. Of the &quot;Sega Rally&quot; series, Mizuguchi told members of his former staff, &quot;it&#x27;s your game, not mine!&quot;, giving credit to his team for the game. Mizuguchi also credited his work on racing games with AM Annex as being the best way to show off CGI graphics at the time. &quot;Space Channel 5&quot; did not sell well, but has been retrospectively called a &quot;highlight&quot; on the Dreamcast and described as &quot;unlike anything before it.&quot; &quot;USA Today&quot; gave the Dreamcast version all four stars and said it was &quot;all about fun, and [&quot;Space Channel 5&quot;] delivers with a song.&quot; &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave the same version an A− and said that &quot;gamers of all ages undoubtedly will want to help Ulala get her groove back — if not get their hands on a pair of those boots.&quot; &quot;IGN&quot;&#x27;s Travis Fahs called &quot;Space Channel 5&quot; &quot;a product somehow greater than the sum of its parts&quot;, and that the presentation of &quot;Part 2&quot; &quot;had been polished to such a degree that it elevated the game to a new level.&quot;

&quot;Rez&quot;, in particular, has received much positive feedback and several re-releases. The game received an award from The Agency for Cultural Affairs Media Art Festival in Japan. Writing for &quot;Games&quot; in 2002, reviewer Thomas L. McDonald described &quot;Rez&quot; as &quot;a game that carves out its own niche: the art-house abstract musical rail-shooter&quot;, and emphasized the game&#x27;s differences from traditional rhythm games while noting that &quot;the result is awesome, but trying to describe it in words is like trying to sculpt Jell-O. Simply put, it&#x27;s like nothing you&#x27;ve ever seen before.&quot; The game would go on to receive &quot;Runner Up&quot; in the category of &quot;Electronic - Puzzle and Classic&quot; in &quot;Games&quot;″s annual &quot;The Games 100&quot;. In 2009, &quot;Edge&quot; ranked the game #49 on its list of &quot;The 100 Best Games To Play Today&quot;, calling it &quot;Astonishing to watch [and] uniquely absorbing to play&quot;. In 2012, &quot;Rez&quot; was listed on &quot;Time&quot;″s all-time 100 greatest video games list. &quot;Rez&quot; would later be re-released in 2007 for the Xbox 360 as &quot;Rez HD&quot;, which Mizuguchi noted during the show that he &quot;always dreamed of a high-def wide screen and very good sound&quot;, and described the game as &quot;100 percent the same game&quot; as the original Dreamcast version. After seeing the potential for virtual reality, Mizuguchi created a new development studio, Enhance Games, to redevelop &quot;Rez&quot; for VR gaming as &quot;Rez Infinite&quot; for the PlayStation 4. &quot;Rez Infinite&quot; received widespread acclaim from critics. Review aggregate Metacritic assigned the game a score of 89 out of 100, based on 44 reviews, making &quot;Rez Infinite&quot; the highest rated PSVR game on the site. The game received unanimous praise for its immersion, sense of place, visual and sound design, and its new level &quot;Area X&quot;. Despite the age of its previous iterations, many reviewers considered it to be the finest PSVR title to date, and an essential game for anyone owning the device. Martin Robinson of &quot;Eurogamer&quot; called the game a &quot;modern masterpiece&quot;, and Alexa Ray Corriea of &quot;GameSpot&quot; considered it to be &quot;a new classic&quot;. Lucas Sullivan of GamesRadar thought that the game &quot;achieves its full potential with PSVR&quot;, while &quot;Edge&quot; summarized &quot;&quot;Rez Infinite&quot; is 15 years old, and the best VR game of 2016.&quot;

According to Fahs, United Game Artists has a legacy connected with that of the Dreamcast, even though all of their games were ported to the PlayStation 2. He stated that elements of what was UGA can be found in Sonic Team games &quot;Feel the Magic: XY/XX&quot; and &quot;The Rub Rabbits!&quot;, and that when it comes to their legacy, &quot;UGA turned trite criticisms of &#x27;style over substance&#x27; into a badge of honor. Their short run proved just how far dazzling presentation could go.&quot;

<doc id="455732" wikidata="Q5676568" url="?curid=455732" title="Harvard Society of Fellows">
<text>The Society of Fellows is a group of scholars selected at the beginnings of their careers by Harvard University for their potential to advance academic wisdom, upon whom are bestowed distinctive opportunities to foster their individual and intellectual growth. Junior fellows are appointed by senior fellows based upon previous academic accomplishments and receive generous financial support for three years while they conduct independent research at Harvard University in any discipline, without being required to meet formal degree requirements or to be graded in any way. The only stipulation is that they maintain primary residence in Cambridge, Massachusetts, for the duration of their fellowship. Membership in the society is for life.

The society has contributed numerous scholars to the Harvard faculty and thus significantly influenced the tenor of discourse at the university. Among its best-known members are philosopher W. V. O. Quine, Jf &#x27;36; behaviorist B. F. Skinner, Jf &#x27;36; double Nobel laureate John Bardeen, Jf &#x27;38; economist Paul Samuelson, Jf &#x27;40; historian Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr., Jf &#x27;43; presidential advisor McGeorge Bundy, Jf &#x27;48; historian and philosopher of science Thomas Kuhn, Jf &#x27;51; linguist and activist Noam Chomsky, Jf &#x27;55; biologist E. O. Wilson, Jf &#x27;56; cognitive scientist Marvin Minsky, Jf &#x27;57; former dean of the Harvard faculty, economist Henry Rosovsky, Jf &#x27;57; economist and whistleblower Daniel Ellsberg, Jf &#x27;59; philosopher Saul Kripke, Jf &#x27;66; ethnographer and photographer Bruce Jackson, Jf &#x27;67; Fields Medal-winning theoretical physicist Ed Witten, Jf &#x27;81; and writer, critic, and editor Leon Wieseltier, Jf &#x27;82.

==History==
Beginning in 1925, Harvard scholars Henry Osborn Taylor, Alfred North Whitehead and Lawrence Joseph Henderson met several times to discuss their frustration with the conditions of graduate study at the university. They believed that in order to produce exceptional research, the most able men required freedom from financial worries, fewer formal requirements, and the liberty to choose whatever object of study attracted them.

They soon found an ally in then-Harvard-president Abbott Lawrence Lowell who appointed a committee in 1926, with Henderson as chairman, to study the nature of an institution that might improve the quality of graduate education. The committee recommended the establishment of a Society of Fellows at Harvard, modeled particularly on the Prize Fellowship at Trinity College, Cambridge, and partly on those at &quot;Fondation Dosne-Thiers&quot; in Paris and All Souls&#x27; College, Oxford, with the hope that such a society would produce not only &quot;isolated geniuses, but men who will do the work of the world&quot;.

After years of trying to attract outside donations, Lowell funded the Society himselfhis last major institutional act before his resignation in November 1932. &quot;There being no visible source of necessary funds,&quot; he later wrote, &quot;I gave it myself, in a kind of desperation, although it took nearly all I had.&quot; Though it was an open secret that Lowell was the source of the anonymous donation, this was never acknowledged in his presence. After Lowell&#x27;s death in 1943, the donation was officially made public; it is known as the Anna Parker Lowell Fund in memory of Lowell&#x27;s wife.

The society was officially inaugurated as an alternative to the Ph.D. system with the beginning of the 193334 academic year, granting fellows freedom to pursue lines of inquiry that transcended traditional academic disciplinary boundaries. Because of the core belief in the importance of informal discussions between scholars in different academic fields, both senior and junior fellows have met for dinner every Monday night during term-time. They are frequently joined by visiting scholars and Fellows are encouraged to bring guests.

Originally headquartered in a two-room suite at Eliot House, one of the university&#x27;s twelve residential colleges, the society was closed to women until 1972, when Martha Nussbaum was selected as the first female junior fellow.

<doc id="455737" wikidata="Q319943" url="?curid=455737" title="Elpidio Quirino">
<text>Elpidio Rivera Quirino (; November 16, 1890 – February 29, 1956) was a Filipino lawyer and politician who served as the 6th President of the Philippines from 1948 to 1953.

A lawyer by profession, Quirino entered politics when he became a representative of Ilocos Sur&#x27;s 1st district from 1919 to 1922. He was then elected as a senator from 1925 to 1935. In 1934, he became a member of the Philippine Independence Commission that was sent to Washington, D.C., which secured the passage of Tydings–McDuffie Act to the United States Congress. In 1935, he was also elected to the 1935 Constitutional Convention that drafted the 1935 Philippine Constitution for the newly established Philippine Commonwealth. In the new government, he served as secretary of the interior and finance under the cabinet of President Manuel L. Quezon.

After World War II, Quirino was elected vice-president in the April 1946 presidential election, consequently the second and last for the Commonwealth and first for the Third Republic. After the death of incumbent President Manuel Roxas in April 1948, he succeeded to the presidency. He won a full term under the Liberal Party ticket, defeating Nacionalista former president José P. Laurel as well as fellow &quot;Liberalista&quot; and former Senate President José Dira Avelino.

The Quirino administration was generally challenged by the Hukbalahap, who ransacked towns and barrios. Quirino ran for president again in November 1953 but was defeated by Ramon Magsaysay in a landslide.

==Early life and career==
Elpidio Quirino y Rivera was born on November 16, 1890, at the Vigan Provincial Jail in Vigan, Ilocos Sur. He was the third child of Mariano Quirino y Quebral of Caoayan, Ilocos Sur and Gregoria Rivera y Mendoza of Agoo, La Union. A Chinese mestizo descendant, Quirino was baptized on November 19, 1890.

His daughter, Victoria, became the youngest hostess of Malacañang Palace, at 16 years old, when Quirino ascended to the presidency on April 17, 1948. She married Luis M. Gonzalez in 1950, who became Philippine ambassador to Spain from 1966 to 1971.

==Congressional career==

===House of Representatives===
Quirino was engaged in private law practice of until he was elected as member of the Philippine House of Representatives for Ilocos Sur&#x27;s 1st congressional district from 1919 to 1922, succeeding Alberto Reyes. He served for only one term and was succeeded by Vicente Singson Pablo in 1922.

===Senate===
Quirino was first elected as a senator from the 1st senatorial district in 1925. He was re-elected in 1931 and served until the bicameral Congress was abolished in favor of the unicameral National Assembly of the Philippines. 

As a senator, he was briefly assigned by Senate President Manuel Quezon as acting Senate Majority Leader from 1932 to 1933 due to Quezon, senate majority leader Benigno Aquino Sr., and Sergio Osmeña went on leave and made trips to the United States. These were to protect the proposed Hare–Hawes–Cutting bill in U.S. Congress and to amend the bill because of opposition from the Philippine Legislature. In the senate, Quirino also became chairman of a joint committee on taxation.

He was later secured a comeback to the Senate in 1941, but was not able to serve until 1945 due to World War II. During the Philippine Commonwealth, he became Senate President pro tempore from 1942 but did not serve until 1945. His term as senator ended in 1946.

==Vice presidency (1946–1948)==
Soon after the reconstitution of the Commonwealth government in 1945, Senators Manuel Roxas, Quirino and their allies called for an early national election to choose the president and vice president of the Philippines and members of the Congress. In December 1945, the House Insular Affairs of the United States Congress approved the joint resolution setting the date of the election on not later than April 30, 1946.

Prompted by this congressional action, President Sergio Osmeña called the Philippine Congress to a three-day special session. Congress enacted Commonwealth Act No. 725, setting the date of the election on April 23, 1946. The act was signed by President Osmeña on January 5, 1946.

Quirino was nominated as Senate President Manuel Roxas&#x27;s running mate. The tandem won the election. As Vice President, Quirino was appointed Secretary of Foreign Affairs.

==Presidency (1948–1953)==
Quirino&#x27;s five years as president were marked by notable postwar reconstruction, general economic gains and increased economic aid from the United States.

===Administration and cabinet===
===First term (1948–1949)===

====Accession====
Quirino assumed the presidency on April 17, 1948, taking his oath of office two days after the death of Manuel Roxas two days earlier of a heart attack after delivering a speech at Clark Air Base in Pampanga. The inauguration took place at the Council of State Room of the Malacañang Palace in Manila as the second non-scheduled extraordinary presidential inauguration. Associate Justice of the Supreme Court Ricardo Paras administered the oath of office. On the same day, Quirino delivered his short, 47-word inaugural remarks at the same room.

His first official act as the President was the proclamation of a state mourning throughout the country for Roxas&#x27;s death. Since Quirino was a widower, his surviving daughter, Victoria, would serve as the official hostess and perform the functions traditionally ascribed to the First Lady.

====New capital city====
On July 17, 1948, Congress approved Republic Act No. 333, amending Commonwealth Act No. 502, declaring Quezon City as the new capital of the Philippines, replacing Manila. Nevertheless, pending the official transfer of the government offices to the new capital site, Manila remained to be such for all effective purposes.

====Hukbalahap====
The term Hukbalahap was a contraction of &quot;Hukbong Bayan Laban sa mga Hapon&quot; (in English: The Nation&#x27;s Army Against the Japanese Soldiers), members of which were commonly referred to as &quot;Huks&quot;.

With the expiration of the Amnesty deadline on August 15, 1948, the government found out that the Huks had not lived up to the terms of the Quirino-Taruc agreement. Indeed, after having been seated in Congress and collecting his back pay allowance, Huk leader Luis Taruc surreptitiously fled away from Manila, even as a number of his followers had either submitted themselves to the conditions of the Amnesty proclamation or surrendered their arms. In the face of countercharges from the Huk to the effect that the government had not satisfied the agreed conditions, President Quirino ordered a stepped-up campaign against dissidents, restoring once more an aggressive policy in view of the failure of the friendly attitude previously adopted.

====Fireside chats====
To bring the government closer to the people, he revived President Quezon&#x27;s &quot;fireside chats&quot;, in which he enlightened the people on the activities of the Republic by the periodic radio broadcasts from Malacañang Palace.

====Impeachment attempt====
Riding on the crest of the growing wave of resentment against the Liberal Party, a move was next hatched to indict President Quirino himself. Led by Representative Agripino Escareal, a committee composed of seven members of the House of Representatives prepared a five-count accusation ranging from nepotism to gross expenditures. Speaker Eugenio Pérez appointed a committee of seven, headed by Representative Lorenzo Sumulong to look into the charges preparatory to their filing with the Senate, acting as an impeachment body. Solicitor General Felix Angelo Bautista entered his appearance as defense counsel for the chief executive. Following several hearings, on April 19, 1949, after a rather turbulent session that lasted all night, the congressional committee reached a verdict completely exonerating the President.

====Romulo becomes President of the UN General Assembly====
In September 1949, the Fourth General Assembly of the United Nations elected delegate Carlos P. Romulo as its President. The first Oriental to hold the position, Romulo was strongly supported by the Anglo-Saxon bloc, as well as by the group of Spanish-speaking nations, thus underscoring the hybrid nature of the Filipino people&#x27;s culture and upbringing.

====1949 presidential election====
Incumbent President Quirino won a full term as President after the untimely death of President Manuel Roxas in 1948 in the November 1949 presidential election. His running mate, Senator Fernando López, won as Vice President. Despite factions created in the administration party, Quirino won a satisfactory vote from the public. It was the only time in Philippine history where the duly elected president, vice president and senators all came from the same party, the Liberal Party. The election was widely criticized as being corrupt, with violence and fraud taking place. Opponents of Quirino were beaten or murdered by his supporters or the police and the election continues to be seen as corrupt.

===Second term (1949–1953)===
Quirino&#x27;s second inauguration took place on Friday, December 30, 1949, at the Independence Grandstand in Manila. Chief Justice of the Supreme Court Manuel Moran administered the oath of office.

====Regional conference====
In May 1950, upon the invitation of President Quirino and through the insistent suggestion of United Nations General Assembly President Romulo, official representatives of India, Pakistan, Ceylon, Thailand, Indonesia, and Australia met in Baguio for a regional conference sponsored by the Philippines. Taiwan and South Korea did not attend the conference because the latter did not contemplate the formation of a military union of the Southeast Asian nations. On the other hand, Japan, Indonesia, Taiwan, and others were not invited because, at the time, they were not free and independent states. Due to the request of India and Indonesia, no political questions were taken up the conference. Instead, the delegates discussed economic and, most of all, cultural, problems confronting their respective countries. Strangely enough however, the Baguio Conference ended with an official communiqué in which the nations attending the same expressed their united agreement in supporting the right to self-determination of all peoples the world over. This initial regional meet held much promise of a future alliance of these neighboring nations for common protection and aid.

====Huks&#x27; continued re-insurgence====
The Quirino administration faced a serious threat in the form of the communist Hukbalahap movement. Although the Huks originally had been an anti-Japanese guerrilla army in Luzon, communists steadily gained control over the leadership, and when Quirino&#x27;s negotiation with Huk commander Luis Taruc broke down in 1948. Taruc then openly declared himself a communist and called for the overthrow of the government.

====Peace campaign====
With the communist organization estimated to still have more than 40,000 duly registered members by March 1951, the government went on with its sustained campaign to cope with the worsening peace and order problem. The 1951 budget included the use of a residue fund for the land resettlement program in favor of the surrendered HUKS. The money helped maintain the Economic Development Corps (EDCOR), with its settlements of 6,500 hectares in Kapatagan (Lanao) and 25,000 hectares in Buldon (Cotabato). In each group taken to these places there was a nucleus of former Army personnel and their families, who became a stabilizing factor and ensured the success of the program. Indeed, less than ten percent of the Huks who settled down gave up this new lease in life offered them by the government.

To promote the smooth restructuring of the Armed Forces of the Philippines, the military were made to undergo a reorganization. Battalion combat teams of 1,000 men each were established. Each operated independently of the High Command, except for overall coordination in operational plans. A total of 26 Battalion Combat Teams were put up. New army units were also established, such was the first Airborne Unit, the Scout Rangers, the Canine Unit, and the Cavalry Unit. These units all showed considerable ability.

====Assassination plot====
In early January 1951, a communist plot to assassinate leading government officials was discovered following the seizure of documents in a rebel camp, which showed that 40 men had been hired for the plan. Among the intended victims were Quirino, Lopez, and then defense secretary Magsaysay. On January 24, four Chinese nationals—suspected would-be assassins—were arrested in a raid in Chinatown, Manila; they were later held at Philippine Army headquarters at Camp Murphy.

Intelligence sources reported that the plot was directed by Co Pak, a businessman who had been arrested for allegedly supporting the Hukbalahap and his fellow communists in the country. He had escaped every arrests several times. On February 19, he was deported by the government to Formosa through a Philippine Air Force plane.

====1951 midterm election====
After a sweep by the Liberals in 1949, many Filipinos doubted the election result. This brought a sweep by the Nacionalistas in the 1951 elections. There was a special election for the vacated Senate seat of Fernando Lopez, who won as vice president in 1949. The Liberals won no seats in the Senate.

====1953 presidential election====
Quirino ran for re-election to the presidency with José Yulo as his running mate in 1953 despite his ill health. His Secretary of National Defense, Ramon Magsaysay, resigned from office and joined the Nacionalista Party. Other prominent Liberals including Vice President Fernando Lopez, Ambassador Carlos Romulo, and Senators Tomás Cabili and Juan Sumulong also bolted Quirino&#x27;s party.

On August 22, 1953, the Nacionalista and Democratic Parties formed a coalition to ensure Quirino&#x27;s full defeat. On Election Day, Quirino was defeated by Magsaysay with a landslide vote margin of 1.5 million.

Quirino was accused of a Golden arinola scandal which led him to losing the 1953 Philippine presidential election

===Domestic policies===
====Economy====
Upon assuming the reins of government, Quirino announced two main objectives of his administration: first, the economic reconstruction of the nation and second, the restoration of the faith and confidence of the people in the government. In connection to the first agenda, he created the President&#x27;s Action Committee on Social Amelioration (PACSA) to mitigate the sufferings of indigent families, the Labor Management Advisory Board to advise him on labor matters, the Agricultural Credit Cooperatives Financing Administration (ACCFA) to help the farmers market their crops and save them from loan sharks, and the Rural Banks of the Philippines to facilitate credit utilities in rural areas.

The Import and Exchange Control Act of 1948 was fully implemented only after Quirino won. During his term, Congress also created the Central Bank of the Philippines to control currency, banking, and credit. Before implementing controls, the Bell Trade Act required approval from the U. S. President. President Harry S. Truman agreed to the controls if the Philippines accepted an all-American economic mission called the Bell Mission, led by Daniel Bell, which surveyed the country’s economy in July 1950. The mission reported the harsh economic conditions of the Philippines. Its findings led to the Romulo-Snyder Agreement and the Quirino-Foster Agreement, including a $70 million loan proposal from Central Bank Governor Miguel Cuaderno.

====Social programs====
Enhancing President Manuel Roxas&#x27; policy of social justice to alleviate the lot of the common mass, President Quirino, almost immediately after assuming office, started a series of steps calculated to effectively ameliorate the economic condition of the people. After periodic surprise visits to the slums of Manila and other backward regions of the country, President Quirino officially made public a seven-point program for social security which included the following:

#Unemployment insurance
#Old-age insurance
#Accident and permanent disability insurance
#Health insurance
#Maternity insurance
#State relief; and
#Labor opportunities
President Quirino also created the Social Security Commission and appointed Social Welfare Commissioner Asuncion Perez as its chairperson. This was followed by the creation of the PACSA, charges with extending aid, loans, and relief to less fortunate citizens. Both the policy and its implementation were hailed by the people as harbingers of great benefits.

====Agrarian reform====
As part of his agrarian reform agenda, President Quirino issued Executive Order No. 355 on October 23, 1950, which replaced the National Land Settlement Administration with Land Settlement Development Corporation (LASEDECO) which takes over the responsibilities of the Agricultural Machinery Equipment Corporation and the Rice and Corn Production Administration.

====Integrity board====
To cope with the insistent clamor for government improvement, President Quirino created the Integrity Board to probe into reports of graft and corruption in high government positions. Vice President Fernando Lopez was most instrumental through his courageous exposés, in securing such a decision from President Quirino.

===Foreign policies===
Quirino&#x27;s administration excelled in diplomacy, impressing foreign heads of states and world statesmen by his intelligence and culture. He had official travels to the United States, European countries, and Southeast Asia. During his six years in office, he and his Foreign Affairs Secretary, Helen Cutaran Bennett, was able to negotiate treaties and agreements with other nations of the Free World. Two Asian heads of state visited the country—President Chiang Kai-shek of the Republic of China in July 1949 and President Sukarno of Indonesia in January 1951.

In 1950, at the onset of the Korean War, President Quirino authorized the deployment of over 7,450 Filipino soldiers to Korea, under the designation of the Philippine Expeditionary Forces to Korea (PEFTOK).
In 1951, the Philippines signed the Mutual Defense Treaty with the United States to deter the threat of communism that existed during the Cold War. The military alliance remains to this day a key pillar of American foreign policy in Asia that also includes defense pacts with Japan, South Korea, Thailand, and Australia. 

In an apparent show of genuine forgiveness and an attempt to improve public relations with Japan, Quirino granted amnesty to all Japanese war criminals and Filipino collaborators who were serving time or on death row in the Philippines. Quirino had lost his own wife and three children to the Japanese, along with five other members of his family. Despite this great personal loss, he said, &quot;I do not want my children and my people to inherit from me hate for people who might yet be our friends, for the permanent interest of the country.&quot; Due to the high anti-Japanese sentiment at the time, many observers considered his actions to be political suicide. Controversially, Quirino even pardoned Japanese war criminals who murdered, raped, and inflicted other serious crimes towards Filipinos during World War II. The &quot;Manila Bulletin&quot;, an influential Filipino newspaper, has described his actions as &quot;a historic gesture of &#x27;forgiving the unforgivable&#x27;&quot;. All of the convicts were released by December 1953. They had been tried by the American-operated Philippine War Crimes Commission or Filipino civil courts. The pardons contributed to the reconciliation between the Philippines and Japan which eventually led to a friendly relationship.

====Korean War====
On June 25, 1950, the world was astonished to hear the North Korean aggression against the independent South Korea. The United Nations immediately took up this challenge to the security of this part of the world. Carlos Romulo soon stood out as the most effective spokesman for the South Korean cause. On behalf of the government, Romulo offered to send a Philippine military contingent to be under the overall command of General Douglas MacArthur, who had been named United Nations supreme commander for the punitive expedition. The Philippines, thus, became the first country to join the United States in the offer of military assistance to beleaguered South Korea.

President Quirino took the necessary steps to make the Philippine offer. On a purely voluntary basis, the first contingent – the Tenth Battalion Combat Team – was formed under Colonel Azurin, and dispatched to Korea, where its members quickly won much renown for their military skill and bravery. The name of Captain Jose Artiaga, Jr., heroically killed in action, stands out as a symbol of the country&#x27;s contribution to the cause of freedom outside native shores. Other Philippine Combat Teams successively replaced the first contingent sent, and they all built a name for discipline, tenacity, and courage, until the armistice that brought the conflict to a halt.

====Quirino-Foster Agreement====
By the time of the creation of the Integrity Board, the Bell Mission, led by American banker Daniel W. Bell and composed of five members with a staff of twenty workers, following their period of stay in the Philippines, beginning in July 1950, finally submitted its report on October of the same year. The report made several proposals, most noteworthy, of which were that the United States on, President Quirino gamely and patriotically, took in the recommendations and sought to implement them. Thus, in November 1950, President Quirino and William Chapman Foster, representing the United States government, signed an agreement by virtue of which the former pledged to obtain the necessary Philippine legislation, in keeping with the Bell Mission Report, while envoy Foster promised the necessary by the same report.

The agreement also called for renegotiating the Bell Trade Agreement and signing a Treaty of Friendship, Commerce, and Navigation for the U.S. recognition of the Philippines’ independence. Senator Claro M. Recto labeled this a “mendicant foreign policy” since it allowed U.S. advisors into government offices, leading to official American intervention in the country&#x27;s government and economy.

However, much as he tried to become a good president, Quirino failed to win the people&#x27;s affection. Several factors caused the unpopularity of his administration, namely:
* Failure of the government to check the Huk threat that made travel in the provinces unsafe, as evidenced by the killing of former First Lady Aurora Quezon and her companions on April 28, 1949, by the Huks on the Bongabong-Baler Road in Baler, Tayabas (now part of Aurora);
* Economic distress of the times, aggravated by rising unemployment rate, soaring prices of commodities, and unfavorable balance of trade.

==Post-presidency and death (1953–1956)==

Following his failed bid for re-election, Quirino retired to private life. He offered his dedication to serve the Filipino people, becoming the &quot;Father of Foreign Service&quot; in the Philippines.

In the evening of February 29, 1956, Quirino was preparing to attend a meeting when he suffered a massive heart attack. He died shortly thereafter at 6:35 pm, at the age of 65, at his retirement house in Novaliches, Quezon City. President Ramon Magsaysay later declared March 1 to 15 as a &quot;period of national mourning&quot;, wherein all flags at all government establishments in the country were flown at half-mast as a sign of mourning. Quirino&#x27;s remains lay in state at the Malacañang Palace from March 2 to 4. On March 5, a necrological service was held for him at the Legislative Building in Manila and his remains were later interred at the Manila South Cemetery.

On February 29, 2016, his remains were relocated and reinterred at a special tomb site in the Libingan ng mga Bayani in Taguig, in time for the 60th anniversary of his death.

==Personal life==
Quirino was married to Alicia Syquía (1903–1945) on January 16, 1921. The couple had five children: Tomás, Armando, Norma, Victoria, and Fe Angela. On February 9, 1945, his wife and three of their children (Armando, Norma and Fe Angela) were killed by Japanese troops as they fled their home during the Battle of Manila. His brother Antonio Quirino was the owner of Alto Broadcasting System, which later merged with Chronicle Broadcasting Network to form the ABS-CBN Broadcasting Corporation.

==Memorials==
There are a number of memorials dedicated to Quirino. In 1964, the municipality of Angaki in Ilocos Sur was renamed to Quirino in his honor. The province of Quirino, established in 1966, was named in his memory. Streets like the Quirino Avenue in Manila and Elpidio Quirino Avenue in Parañaque are named for him. The Novaliches–Ipo Road, where his retirement home is situated, was renamed as Quirino Highway. The Independence Grandstand in Manila&#x27;s Rizal Park was also renamed to Quirino Grandstand in his honor.

Once the Quirino Avenue station of MRT Line 7 and the Quirino Highway station of the Metro Manila Subway commence operations, Quirino will have three train stations named after him, including the Quirino station of LRT Line 1.

In 2016, a memorial to him was established in Hibiya Park, Tokyo, Japan.

<doc id="455741" wikidata="Q199668" url="?curid=455741" title="Emblem of Angola">
<text>The national emblem of Angola reflects the recent past of the nation. It includes Marxist imagery found on the device (as can be seen when compared with other examples of socialist heraldry), expanded from what is found on the national flag.

In the center is a machete and hoe, representing the revolution through which the nation gained independence and the importance of agricultural workers. Above both emblems is a star, a common symbol in socialist emblems. The star is taken to represent progress. The rising sun is the traditional symbol of a new beginning. These emblems are all enclosed within a circle whose right half is formed by cog-wheel, representing the industrial workers, and whose left half is a half-wreath of maize, coffea and cotton leaves, representing agriculture. At the bottom is an open book that represents education.

The banner at the bottom reads &#x27;, [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] for &quot;Republic of Angola&quot;. This was changed from&#x27; (&quot;People&#x27;s Republic of Angola&quot;) in 1990.

Details of the insignia are laid down in Article 163 of the Constitution of Angola.

In 1935, the Portuguese colonies were officially assigned coats of arms that followed a standard design pattern. For Angola, this consisted of a shield parted per pale, with the Portuguese arms without its usual bordure in the dexter (viewer&#x27;s left) half and in the sinister (viewer&#x27;s right) half the arms for Angola itself: a golden elephant and a golden zebra on a purpure field. The wavy bars in the base (&quot;enté en point&quot;) represented Angola&#x27;s location overseas from metropolitan Portugal.

<text>Andrés Montañez Rodríguez (born May 7, 1942), better known as Andy Montañez, is a Puerto Rican singer and songwriter.

==Early life==
Montañez is a native of the &quot;Tras Talleres&quot; area of Santurce, San Juan, Puerto Rico. He is known by the nicknames &quot;El Godfather de la Salsa&quot; and &quot;El Niño De Trastalleres&quot;.

==Musical career==
Montañez first gained fame as a member of the internationally successful El Gran Combo group, with songs like &quot;Hojas blancas&quot; (White Leaves), &quot;Un verano en N.Y.&quot; (A Summer in NY), &quot;El barbero loco&quot; (The Crazy Barber), &quot;Julia&quot;, &quot;Ponme el alcolado, Juana&quot; (Rub Me With the Bay Rum, Juana), &quot;Vagabundo&quot; (Bum), &quot;El Swing&quot;, etc. He stayed for approximately 15 years, producing 37 LPs. He left El Gran Combo to pursue a career with Venezuelan group La Dimension Latina, creating a feud between the two groups. After leaving El Gran Combo, he enjoyed considerable success on an international scale with his own orchestra, touring Latin America and the United States several times. He represented Puerto Rico at the 1992 World&#x27;s Fair in Seville, Spain.

==Recent years==
In recent years, he had teamed up with fellow salsa singer Ismael Miranda to produce some boleros and bohemian music. By 2005-06 he began creating a new blend between salsa and reggaeton, called salsaton. In April 2006, he released a new album titled &quot;Salsatón - Salsa con Reggaetón&quot;, which was produced by Sergio George and featured reggaeton rappers Daddy Yankee, Julio Voltio, La Sista, and John Eric. In 2007, he filmed various television advertisements on nutrition for the Puerto Rico Department of Family Affairs (including one in which he sang a rhumba to a dancing carrot).

On November 2, 2006, Montañez won his first Latin Grammy for Best Traditional Tropical Album, together with Pablo Milanés. Montañez was selected to form part of a benefit concert titled “Somos Haití”, where funds would be gathered to support Haiti after the 2008 hurricane season.

In 2015, Montañez appeared on Puerto Rican singer Ivy Queen&#x27;s ninth studio album &quot;Vendetta&quot;. The album was split into four separate albums, one being an album composed entirely of only salsa music. On the album, Montañez dueted with Queen on a re-recording of his 1988 hit, &quot;Casi Te Envidio&quot;.

==Personal life==
Andy has five children, two daughters and three sons. Andy Jr. Harold, and Lisa have gone on to become salsa singers and have worked with their father for over 25 years, occasionally serving as back-up vocalists at his concerts. His oldest son, Andy Montañez Jr., died on July 24, 2019, at the age of 54.

<doc id="455749" wikidata="Q55669" url="?curid=455749" title="Ny-Ålesund">
<text>Ny-Ålesund (&quot;New Ålesund&quot;) is a small town in Oscar II Land on the island of Spitsbergen in Svalbard, Norway. It is situated on the Brøgger peninsula (Brøggerhalvøya) and on the shore of the bay of Kongsfjorden. The company town is owned and operated by Kings Bay, which provides facilities for permanent research activities by 19 institutions from 11 countries. The town is ultimately owned by the Ministry of Climate and Environment and is not incorporated (i.e. is not recognised as a town by the Norwegian government). Ny-Ålesund has an all-year permanent population of 30 to 35, with the summer population reaching 114. Its facilities include Ny-Ålesund Airport, Hamnerabben, Svalbard Rocket Range, a port and Ny-Ålesund Town and Mine Museum, as well as a number of buildings dedicated to research and environmental monitoring activities. It is the northernmost functional civilian settlement in the world.

The town was founded in 1917 by Peter Brandal and his mining company, Kings Bay Kull Comp. Initially, mining was carried out until 1929, but it was unprofitable for most of the 1920s. A series of air expeditions were launched from Ny-Ålesund towards the North Pole. The company was nationalized in 1933 and the town was used for tourism and as a fishing port. Mining resumed for some months in 1941 and then from 1945. After several fatal incidents occurred including a mining accident on 5 November 1962 that killed 21 miners in what became known as the Kings Bay Affair, mining activity was terminated and Gerhardsen&#x27;s Third Cabinet resigned. Kongsfjord Telemetry Station opened in 1967 and the town gradually transformed into a research settlement, with the Norwegian Polar Institute having had a year-round presence since 1968. As of 2021, 18 institutions from 11 countries have a more or less permanent presence in Ny-Ålesund – five of them with year-round activity, the remaining are primarily present during the spring-summer-autumn field season.

==Geography==
Ny-Ålesund is located on the north shore of Brøggerhalvøya, a peninsula of Oscar II Land on the island of Spitsbergen. The town is located on the southern shore of Kongsfjorden (literally &quot;the King&#x27;s Bay&quot;), a bay on the west coast of Spitsbergen that connects to Forlandssundet of the Greenland Sea. Across from Ny-Ålesund is the island of Blomstrandøya and the former settlement of Ny-London.

As Ny-Ålesund has no legal existence as a town, it lacks any formal area. If the land owned by Kings Bay is used to define the town, it would have an area of , which would encapsulate both the north and south shores of Kongsfjorden. Kings Bay retains ownership of all land in the area, although the mining claims are held by Store Norske.

==History==

The coal deposits at Kongsfjorden were first discovered by Jonas Poole during a whaling expedition in the area in 1610. They did not receive more careful analysis until 1861, when Christian Wilhelm Blomstrand carried out surveys. A Swedish expedition looked into the coal in 1870 and in 1901 Bergen–Spitsbergen Kulgrubekompani laid claims to the deposits. Failing to follow up, Ernest Mansfield occupied claims in 1905 and 1906, which were sold to The Northern Exploration Co. Ltd. in 1910. The first test shaft was built in 1909, followed by a hut in 1912. The claims were sold to Peter Brandal of Ålesund in 1916, who dispatched two ships and sixty men to Kings Bay for the summer of 1916. Arriving on 21 July, they immediately started breaking surface coal. Kings Bay Kull Comp. was founded on 14 December 1916. Thirty people were sent to Kings Bay for the 1917 season, and started construction of a town. By winter buildings, mines, a port and a railway were completed.
Sixty-four people stayed the first winter. They were supplemented from May 1918, bringing the summer population to 300. In the following years the town was gradually expanded with additional housing and work buildings. During the first years several names were in use for the settlement, including Kings Bay, Kingsbay and Brandal City. Ny-Ålesund came into use in the early 1920s and was soon the official name of the settlement. The mining was hit by two strikes in 1919, the first lasting from the summer to October, and the second from November to January 1920. Because of the ice, each year the shipping was limited from May through October. By 1919 the company had fallen into severe financial difficulties. A British take-over was waved off and instead state coal purchasing agreement, effectively subsidies, were enforced. By 1921 the men had started bringing their families, raising the female population to twenty-two and the child population to twenty-three. An improvised school was therefore taken into use.

The Geophysical Institute of Tromsø established a geophysical station at Kvadehuken in 1920, although it only remained in operation until 1924. Production rose through the 1920, reaching a peak 99,000 tonnes per year. Coal liquefaction was attempted from 1924 to 1927, but proved unprofitable. The labor union, Kings Bay Arbeiderforening, was founded in 1925, although many of the workers had previously ad hoc organized themselves. In 1919 Northern Exploration Company laid pressed that they had claims on Blomstrandhalvøya. The case ended with the Government of Norway buying their claims in 1925, parts of which were sold to Kings Bay.
Between 1925 and 1928, four attempts were made to reach the North Pole by air from Ny-Ålesund. One involved flying boats led by Roald Amundsen. Floyd Bennett and Richard E. Byrd made an attempt. Amundsen and Umberto Nobile&#x27;s airship &quot;Norge&quot; left Ny-Ålesund and traveled via the North Pole to Alaska. Because of controversies over previous efforts, this is regarded by some as the first successful expedition to the North Pole. After two short skirmishes, Nobile&#x27;s airship &quot;Italia&quot; left Ny-Ålesund on 23 May 1928 to reach the North Pole, but crashed on the return.

The first fatal mining accident took place in the Ester Mine on 16 December 1926, killing two miners. Gradually a series of smaller accidents took place. The company&#x27;s lack of profitability caused the government to cease subsidies from 1929. A small guard and maintenance crew was kept in Ny-Ålesund in the following years.

As of 1929 Kings Bay owed NOK 18.6 million to the state and Aalesunds Kreditbank. Thus the state nationalized the company, taking effect on 23 December 1933. A fisheries station opened in 1935, which sold supplies to fishing vessels and carried out steaming of cod liver oil and salting of the cod. As the station was in need of subsidies, it was closed after two years. From 1936 a hotel service targeting tourists opened. Its most elaborate building, Nordpolhotellet, opened on 3 September 1939, although the town was abandoned just days later because of the outbreak of the Second World War. This spurred a Norwegian demand for coal, however, and the town was resettled on 7 May 1941. The entire island was evacuated on 29 August, with critical infrastructure blown up.
Kings Bay dispatched a crew after the war ended, with the first 90 workers arriving at Ny-Ålesund on 13 August 1945. They started reconstruction and mining commenced in November. Production reached 61,000 tonnes in 1947. A 4 December 1948 explosion killed fifteen miners. A trial postal air drop took place in 1946, and regular services were provided from 1949. Weather observations were carried out in 1950 to 1953, and again after 1961. The mine flooded on 26 April 1949 and it took half a year to empty it. On 7 January 1951 there was an explosion in the Ester V Mine, killing nine men.
On 19 March 1952, yet another explosion took place in the Ester Mine, this time killing nineteen men. These caused several investigations and inquiries, leading to improvements to mining safety.

In 1956 Parliament approved a major upgrade to the mining facilities, which would cost NOK 20 million, in the hope that production could reach 200,000 tonnes. In 1956 two brothers, Einar Sverre and Gunnar Sverre Pedersen, through their company Norsk Polar Navigasjon, proposed that an airport be built at Kvadehussletta, on the outer-most point of Brøggerhalvøya. It was met by opposition from both Norwegian and Soviet authorities and no permits were granted, even though they pursued the case for a decade. By 1959 Ester I was depleted and the railway was closed—transport having been taken over by trucks, and production remained low during the late 1950s.

An explosion on 5 November 1962 killed 21 miners. Two investigations were carried out and the issue became a heated political debate. In what became the Kings Bay Affair, Gerhardsen&#x27;s Third Cabinet was ultimately forced to resign in August 1963, and all mining in Ny-Ålesund was terminated from 5 November 1963. For the meanwhile, Kings Bay was to retain the equipment and facilities in case later technological development would allow for safer mining operations. The first research establishment came in 1967, when Kongsfjord Telemetry Station was opened to communicate with the European Space Research Organization&#x27;s satellites. The Royal Norwegian Council for Scientific and Industrial Research took over daily management of Ny-Ålesund until the telemetry station was closed in 1974. The station resulted in the construction of Ny-Ålesund Airport, Hamnerabben, and resulted in about thirty employees.
The Norwegian Polar Institute established a scientific station in Ny-Ålesund in 1966, moving their ionosphere measurement station from Isfjord Radio. An early scientific agent was the Norwegian Institute for Air Research, which has conducted air research in Ny-Ålesund since the mid-1970s. Gradually there was increased interest in research in Ny-Ålesund. In the first years a series of universities sent summer expeditions. Kings Bay also generated revenue from selling fuel, supplies and air transport to shrimp fishers. By 1977 Kings Bay stuck a deal by the then state-owned Store Norske to sell all its claims, although it kept the property rights around Ny-Ålesund. During the early 1980s a plan for cultural heritage management was developed, which included the renovation of several older houses. In 1992 nearly the entire town was listed.

Construction of the Zeppelin Station commenced in 1988 and in 1990 Kings Bay moved its administration from Oslo to Ny-Ålesund. From 1992 the government allowed international research institutions to establish stations in Ny-Ålesund, and thus several institutes built stations the early 1990s. This was matched by Kings Bay, who invested in increased capacity, including dorms, a new dock and better communications. By 1996 there were over one hundred research projects in Ny-Ålesund.

== Climate ==
Ny-Ålesund has a polar climate (Köppen &quot;ET&quot;). Nonetheless, winter temperatures are very mild compared to other locations with the same classification because of the North Atlantic Drift.
==Research==
Eighteen research institutions from eleven countries have a more or less permanent presence in Ny-Ålesund. Five of these have a year-round presence, while the others are active primarily during the spring-summer-autumn field season. In addition there are several institutions that carry out research without having a permanent presence. Most research is centered around environmental and earth sciences (atmosphere, glaciology, terrestrial ecology and marine research), taking advantage of the town&#x27;s latitude, close access to pristine nature and relatively mild climate. Compared to other locations at such a latitude, Ny-Ålesund research station provides a well-developed infrastructure in terms of facilities, laboratories, access and communication.
Ny-Ålesund is owned and operated by Kings Bay, which provides services to visiting scientists.

Representatives for the participating institutions meet in the Ny-Ålesund Science Managers&#x27; Committee (NySMAC) twice per year. NySMAC&#x27;s main goals are to distribute information on existing research and provide input to the coordination and prioritising of future research and research infrastructure. The Svalbard Science Forum (SSF) is an agency that acts as an information and coordination facilitator for research throughout Svalbard. Based in Longyearbyen, it is chaired by the Research Council of Norway. Among SSF&#x27;s tasks is the management of the Research in Svalbard (RiS) database, which contains information on all previous and ongoing research on the archipelago. Kings Bay participates in SSF and requires all researchers to register their projects with RiS. The Americans have a presence in the National Science Foundation funded group known as Svalbard REU, which conducts research on the surrounding glaciers annually.

The following is a list of all actors engaged in research and environmental monitoring on a permanent/semi-permanent basis in Ny-Ålesund. It states the name of the facility, the institute operating it, the nationality, the year the facility was established, and the nature of the research carried out.

 The French and German activities are all part of the joint AWIPEV Arctic Research Station since 2003.

==Mining==

The coal seams are located between the town-site and towards the mountain of Zeppelinfjellet. The coalfields are about wide in the east–west orientation, and about wide in the north–south direction. There are six seams, located at a ten to twenty degree angle towards the surface. The seam thickness varies from a few centimeters (about an inch) to . The varying thickness increased the complexity of mining. From the top the seams are named Ragnhil, Josefine, Otelie, Advokat, Sofie and Ester. Most of the latter three are located below sea level. Each shaft was named for the seam it connected to. The area has further been subdivided into areas: Eastern, Agnes, Eastern Center, Western Center, Western and Lagoon. Only three have seen production, the Agnes, Eastern Center and Western Center.

The coal layers are part of a Tertiary formation created 65 million years ago. It is classified as bituminous coal and cannel coal, with a high petroleum content (16–25 percent) and high sulphuric contents (2 percent). This is the same formation as the coal mines in Longyearbyen and Sveagruva, but the Ny-Ålesund layer has been shifted in relation to these.

==Transport and communications==

Ny-Ålesund has a road network that connects the buildings at the settlement, but this network does not extend beyond the settlement. Off-road motorized transport is prohibited on bare ground, but snowmobiles are used extensively during winter—both for commercial and recreational activities. Ny-Ålesund Harbour is operated by Kings Bay. In addition to serving the research community, it is open to commercial and recreational vessels. It has one large berth that is International Ship and Port Facility Security Code compliant and is commonly used by cruise ships. To reach the Zeppelin Station, located at above mean sea level, there is an aerial tramway that runs up Zeppelinfjellet.

Ny-Ålesund Airport, Hamnerabben consists of a single long and wide gravel runway, located northwest of the settlement. It features a apron and aerodrome flight information service, but lacks a terminal and hangar facilities. Kings Bay charters Lufttransport to fly two to four weekly flights using a Dornier 228 aircraft to Svalbard Airport, Longyear. Tickets are only available after permission from Kings Bay. Svalbard Rocket Range is a launch site for sounding rockets. Owned by Andøya Rocket Range, its high latitude makes it well-suited for launching rockets to investigate Earth&#x27;s magnetic field. It is the world&#x27;s northernmost launch site.

From the implementation of the Svalbard Undersea Cable System in 2003 Ny-Ålesund had a twin 155 megabits per second microwave connection to Longyearbyen. Two redundant fiber pairs were laid in 2014, increasing capacity to 10 gigabits per second. The fiber line is owned by Uninett and cost NOK 90 million (roughly €9.2 million) to install. The very-long-baseline interferometry station at Hamnerabben is sensitive to electromagnetic radiation in certain frequencies. Thus there is enforced a exclusion zone for devices transmitting at between 2.1 and 2.5 GHz. The ban includes mobile telephones, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi and other wireless devices. Telenor Maritim Radio operates a VHF maritime radio transmitted in Ny-Ålesund, which is remotely controlled from Bodø Radio.

==Environment==
Ny-Ålesund is located in a high-Arctic ecosystem within the tundra zone. It sits amid the richest fauna and flora areas of Svalbard, especially along the rim of Kongsfjord and particularly in its innermost parts. Some of the cliffs are heavily populated by birds; Ny-Ålesund is the archipelago&#x27;s richest area for birds, especially waders. The Svalbard ptarmigan is the sole bird to winter. The vegetation is poor and vulnerable, mostly consisting of lichen. Mammals in the area include the Svalbard reindeer, the Arctic fox and the polar bear. All people in the settlement must carry rifles because of the bears, and all doors in town remain unlocked for the sake of people seeking cover in the event of an attack. There are three protected areas in the vicinity: Blomstrandhamna Bird Sanctuary, Kongsfjorden Bird Sanctuary and Ossian Sars Nature Reserve.

The climate is mild for its northern latitude, due to the North Atlantic Current, which flows northwards from mainland Norway up the west coast of Spitsbergen. It also receives heat from the predominant high pressure fronts that bring warm air from the Atlantic to the Barents Sea. The town has its lowest temperatures during March, at an average and a high average of during July. The sun does not set from 18 April to 24 August (midnight sun) and does not rise from 25 October to 17 February (polar night). But there is no nautical twilight between December 11 to December 30, it only has 24 hour of darkness called astronomical twilight. The site is sufficiently isolated that it can be used to measure the background pollution levels in the high Arctic troposphere. The town has some of the cleanest air in the world.

<doc id="455750" wikidata="Q4969771" url="?curid=455750" title="British Columbia Unity Party">
<text>The British Columbia Unity Party was a political party in British Columbia, Canada. The party was founded as an attempted union of five conservative parties: the Reform Party of British Columbia, the British Columbia Social Credit Party, the British Columbia Conservative Party, the British Columbia Party, and the Family Coalition Party of British Columbia. Members from the first four parties joined with the Family Coalition Party to refound the Family Coalition Party as the BC Unity Party on January 10, 2001. The party was formed to present a united conservative option to voters in opposition to the centre-right BC Liberals and the centre-left New Democratic Party (NDP).

==History==
The party was founded in January 2001.

Five months after the party was founded, it nominated 56 candidates across the province for the May 16, 2001 provincial elections. During the election campaign, BC Unity positioned itself as a solidly conservative party, in contrast to the BC Liberals. Despite being included in the leaders debate, along with Premier Dosanjh and Liberal Leader Gordon Campbell the unpopularity of the NDP government was so great that most conservative-minded voters chose to vote for the BC Liberals, rather than split the right-of-centre vote once again. The party received only 3.2% of the vote (51,426).

On September 1, 2004, BC Unity and the British Columbia Conservative Party announced an agreement-in-principle for the two parties to merge under the Conservative Party name. The deal, however, fell through after BC Conservative Leader Barry Chilton withdrew. At the Unity annual general meeting held on September 24 and 25, 2004 in Coquitlam, the BC Unity Party was presented with another proposal of merger by the Conservatives. The Unity delegates did not accept this proposal and instead, affirmed the original agreement-in-principle. This action was not accepted by the BC Conservatives and the merger failed. BC Unity leader Chris Delaney blamed himself for the failure of the merger and resigned.

Many BC Unity members left the party prior to the September 2004 annual general meeting in order to join the Conservatives and to influence them into accepting the agreement-in-principle. When the merger failed, these former members did not return to the Unity party.

In 2005, BC Unity named Daniel Stelmacker as its interim leader. Stelmacker had been a party candidate for the Nanaimo-Parksville electoral district in the 2001 election. In 2005, Stelmacker was the party&#x27;s sole nominated candidate for the 2005 provincial election, running in the Skeena riding. He won 224 votes, 1.74% of the total for the riding.

The party held its last annual general meeting on Saturday, October 29, 2005, in Maple Ridge, British Columbia.

On November 29, 2006, the party issued a news release to announce that it was looking for a new leader and for candidates for the 2009 provincial election.

On January 26, 2008, the BC Unity Party Board decided to poll the membership regarding the merger of the Party with the BC Conservatives or its de-registration. A General Meeting was called for Saturday March 29, 2008 in Surrey. The poll returns indicated 4:1 ratio in favour of a merger with the BC Conservative Party, and the General Meeting confirmed this motion. The BC Conservative Party accepted the former BC Unity Party memberships at their April 19, 2008 executive meeting in Abbotsford. The BC Unity Party de-registered five registered constituency associations, and planned to complete the merger and de-registration process before the BC Conservative Party AGM in Kamloops on Saturday June 7, 2008.

<text>Jing&#x27;an District () is one of the central districts of Shanghai. In 2020, it had 975,707 inhabitants in an area of .

The district borders the Hongkou to the east, Huangpu to the east and south, Putuo to the west, Baoshan District to the north and Changning to the west. On 4 November 2015, Zhabei merged with Jing&#x27;an District, bringing Shanghai down to 15 districts and one county.

Jing&#x27;an District is named after Jing&#x27;an Temple, an ancient traditional Chinese Buddhist temple. Today&#x27;s temple is a new replica of the old one, located in the southern part of the district. An Art Deco &quot;dancehall&quot; is just across the street; the neighborhood is largely residential, but with many bars and restaurants. Jing&#x27;an Park, located opposite the temple, is popular among locals; it used to be a graveyard for foreigners in the old Shanghai.

Historically, the northern part of the district, what used to be Zhabei, has been highly populated with working class residents. However, due to the shift in the structure of industries and increasing number of immigrants from outside Shanghai, partly due to its reasonable real estate prices (compared to its counterparts such as Putuo and Hongkou), the district has become increasingly appealing to city residents.

==Economy and facilities==

Development in the southern part of the district has been rapid. In three years the stock of Grade A office space in the southern part of the district increased approximately 320 percent, from a total of just 333,000 sqm in 2007 to 1,067,000 sqm in 2010. West Nanjing Road is one of Shanghai&#x27;s premier shopping districts and is home to five-star hotels and exhibition centers as well as several upscale housing complexes. Key landmarks on West Nanjing Road include the Shanghai Exhibition Centre and the Shanghai Centre.

The southern part of the district is one of Shanghai&#x27;s key central business and commercial districts. It contains numerous large office buildings, hotels, and many shopping venues at the street level. The district comprises a prominent portion of the Shanghai skyline. The district is also known for having many high-rise residential buildings.

The northern part of the district used to be the place of agglomeration of traditional industries such as flavorings factories and tires factories. In the last decade the municipality decided to move the old industry out to make space for more promising ones, such as the hi-tech and creative industries. It has attracted foreign companies to build offices, apartments and commercial retail outlets over there.

Jing&#x27;An District is also where the Shanghai Multimedia Valley (SMV) is located to attract media and IT talent. Major companies located in Zhabei include TÜV Rheinland, Royal Philips Electronics and Shanghai Bell Alcatel Business Systems Co., LTD.

Daning Lingshi Park, the biggest green area in the downtown area, is surrounded by a series of cultural facilities such as the Zhabei Stadium and Shanghai Circus World.

The Shanghai University, Yanchang Campus is also located near the Daning Lingshi Park.

<doc id="455757" wikidata="Q2936439" url="?curid=455757" title="Cano Estremera">
<text>Carlos Enrique Estremera Colón (2 September 1958 – 28 October 2020) was a Puerto Rican Salsa singer, a native of Santurce, Puerto Rico. Estremera was nicknamed &quot; () and later &quot; (), for his uncanny ability to improvise lyrics to Salsa music. Estremera was albino, and billed as &quot;&quot; ().

==Career==
In his early years, Estremera lived in Residencial Las Casas, a large public housing complex located in Santurce, San Juan, Puerto Rico.
Estremera developed his talent as a singer while performing with other musicians in Barrio Obrero, one of the forty subbarrios of Santurce, not far from Tras Talleres, in Santurce, where many Puerto Rican Salsa musicians and other celebrities (such as Daniel Santos, Andy Montañez and Ossie Ocasio) were raised. Estremera was known by his fans as () until proclaiming himself (), which he used as a marketing concept, emphasizing his prowess as an on-the-spot improviser.

Estremera acknowledged Puerto Rican jíbaro country singers as a strong influence and developed a reputation for being a fast and clever improviser, in the same vein as Marvin Santiago, Gilberto Santa Rosa, Oscar D&#x27;León and other salsa singers who could improvise dozens of &quot;soneos&quot; (improvisations within a call–response format). Estremera participated in &quot;soneo&quot; battles with other salsa singers, most famously with Domingo Quiñones. In the summer of 1990 performing in Guánica, Yabucoa and Juana Díaz he improvised 105, 128, then 130 &quot;soneos&quot;, respectively.

According to Ruben Blades, he met Estremera at a venue in Isla Verde (Puerto Rico) in the early 1970s where Celia Cruz, delighted with Estemera&#x27;s talent brought him onto the stage. Estremera became famous for his uncanny ability to improvise lyrics during Salsa jams.

In 1978, Estremera joined Bobby Valentín, among other replacements to Valentin&#x27;s band -namely Santiago and former Sonora Ponceña singer Luiggi Texidor. Estremera recorded six albums before stating his own band in 1984. He was the lead singer on many of the best selling hits by Valentín&#x27;s band, particularly the band&#x27;s best seller ever, &quot;La boda de ella&quot; (&quot;Her Wedding&quot;), written by Roberto Angleró.

Estremera enjoyed wild success in Puerto Rico as well as in Brazil and Peru, among other places. His best known hit as a solo artist is &quot;El Toro&quot; (&quot;The Bull&quot;), a humorous take on infidelity (and, in one line, about his low vision). A 2003 CD release celebrated his twenty years in the music industry.

In 2013, Estremera said he felt Puerto Rico was no longer instrumental in keeping the Salsa music genre alive, but that other countries such as Colombia, Perú and Venezuela were.
He also faced two incidents where he was vetted from venues in Puerto Rico and Colombia for having had used profanity onstage. As a result, he often polled audiences before addressing specific subjects onstage.

== Health problems and death ==
Estremeda had battled pulmonary fibrosis, a condition that is common among albino people. According to his wife, after Hurricane Maria struck Puerto Rico in September 2017, it became difficult for him to find the medications needed to treat his condition. This caused his health to deteriorate. On 2 November 2018, Estremera underwent a dual lung transplant operation at a hospital in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. After almost a year of his surgery, Estremera was back in Puerto Rico, striving and undergoing physical therapy to regain strength in his legs. The dual lung transplant performed at Penn Medicine in Philadelphia was called an amazing success, however, during the next two years he would be in and out of hospitals until he died in San Juan, Puerto Rico on October 28, 2020, at age 62. In his last hospital stay, Estremera told his wife, Yamira Arce, that he was tired and asked her to &quot;let him go&quot;. Arce said that he told her &quot;I&#x27;m checking in but I won&#x27;t be leaving&quot; (the hospital). Arce also noted that Estremera&#x27;s death was not due to coronavirus.

<doc id="455758" wikidata="Q171384" url="?curid=455758" title="Coat of arms of Armenia">
<text>The national coat of arms of [[Armenia]] () was adopted on April 19, 1992, by resolution of the Armenian Supreme Council. On June 15, 2006, the Armenian Parliament passed the law on the state coat of arms of Armenia.

It consists of an eagle and a lion supporting a shield. The coat of arms combines new and old symbols. The eagle and lion are ancient Armenian symbols dating from the first Armenian kingdoms that existed prior to Christ. These symbols are found on the Armenian Highland from times immemorial. Numerous Armenian dynasties such as Artaxiad, Arsacid, Bagratuni and Rubenid, used these symbols as their royal insignia. Like other post-Soviet republics whose symbols do not predate the October Revolution, the current emblem retained one component of the Soviet one such as the Mount Ararat on the shield. Prior to 1992, Armenia had an emblem similar to all other Soviet Republics.

==History==
===Coat of arms of the First Republic of Armenia===

The present-day Armenian coat of arms has its origins with the establishment of the First Republic of Armenia in 1918. In that year, an early variation of the coat of arms was adopted. The symbols on this earlier version were placed in a slightly different order and the eagle and lion have their tongues out, giving them a more menacing look. Only Mount Ararat (along with Little Ararat) are depicted while Noah&#x27;s Ark is absent. The coat of arms was designed by architect and member of the Russian Academy of Fine Arts Alexander Tamanian and artist Hakob Kojoyan.

===Transcaucasian SFSR===
In 1922, Armenia was incorporated into Transcaucasian SFSR with Georgia and Azerbaijan. The coat of arms of the Transcaucasian SFSR was adopted by the government of the Transcaucasian SFSR. It is uncertain when exactly it was adopted. It incorporates designs from each of the three major groups that combined in the Transcaucasian SFSR, the Armenians, Azeri and Georgians, and unusually features Islamic art and communist elements side by side. The latticework in the star itself bespeaks the former coat of arms of Georgia from 1918 to 1921 and adopted again from 1991 to 2004; the crescent moon represents the Muslim Azeris, on a background depicting the national symbol of the Armenians, Mount Ararat.

===Soviet coat of arms===

In 1937, a new coat of arms was adopted. Like the coat of arms of the first independent republic, this one prominently featured Mount Ararat along with the Soviet hammer and sickle and red star behind it. The inclusion of Mount Ararat brought objections from Turkey because the mountain is part of its territory. The Kremlin retorted that, although the Turkish symbol was the crescent, surely it did not mean that they laid claim to the moon. The Soviet Union broke apart in 1991 and Armenia thus became an independent republic. In 1992, a slightly modified version of the coat of arms of the first republic was adopted and has remained in place ever since.

==Symbolism==
===Shield===
The shield itself consists of five components. In the center is a depiction of the Mount Ararat with Noah&#x27;s Ark sitting atop it. According to tradition, the ark is said to have finally rested on the mountain after the great flood. Ararat is considered the national symbol of Armenia and thus is of principal importance to the coat of arms. Surrounding Mount Ararat are symbols of old Armenian dynasties. In the lower left portion of the shield, there are two eagles looking at each other, symbolizing the length of the Armenian territory during the reign of the Artaxiad dynasty that ruled from the second century B.C. to the beginning of the Christian era. In the upper left portion, there is a lion with a cross, the emblem for the Bagratuni dynasty that ruled during the Middle Ages, between the 9th and 11th centuries. Under this dynasty, Armenia blossomed culturally, making its capital, Ani, one of the most important cultural, social and commercial centers of its time. The Bagratuni kingdom was destroyed by the Byzantine Empire&#x27;s encroachment and by Seljuk conquests in the 11th century. In the upper right portion, there is a two-headed eagle, the emblem of the first dynasty to reign over Christian Armenia, the Arsacid dynasty, which ruled from the first century to 428. Tiridates III made Armenia the first country to adopt Christianity as official religion in 301. In the lower right portion, there is a lion with a cross, the emblem of the Rubenid dynasty. This dynasty reigned in the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia, a state that expanded and prospered during the 12th and 13th centuries, until the Mamelukes eventually conquered it in 1375.

===Eagle and lion===
The eagle supports the shield on the left side of the coat of arms, while the lion on the right side. The eagle was the symbol of the Artaxiad dynasty and later on the symbol of the Arsacid dynasty of Armenia. It holds the Artaxiad dynasty&#x27;s branch of the shield. Whereas, the lion was the symbol of the Bagratuni dynasty and later on the symbol of the Rubenid dynasty. It holds the Rubenid dynasty&#x27;s branch of the shield. The eagle and the lion are a common theme for civilizations on the Armenian Highland. As such they have been represented throughout various Armenian dynasties.

Both of these animals were chosen because of their power, courage, patience, wisdom, and nobility in animal kingdom.

===About the symbol ascribed to the Arshakids in the coat of arms of the Republic of Armenia (double-headed eagle)===
Since 1920, the symbol of the two-headed eagle on the shield of the RA coat of arms has been attributed to the Arshakid dynasty. Despite the lack of direct evidence, a comparative analysis of the available pictographic, chronicle, and bas-relief materials leads us to conclude that the double-headed eagle could refer to Arshakid Armenia, with the only difference being that the symbol in the coat of arms of Armenia does not represent the Arshakid dynasty itself, but their era and fame, being a synthesis of the two-headed eagle of the Mamikonyans and the same eagle of the Armenian Church established by the Arshakids.

===Five vital elements===
Source:
# The sword represents the power and strength of the nation, breaking the chains of oppression.
# The broken chain represents effort shown by the nation to gain freedom and independence.
# The wheat ears represent the hard working nature of the Armenian people.
# The feather represents the intellectual and cultural heritage of the Armenian people (as a quill pen).
# The ribbon represents the colors of the flag of Armenia blue, the sky, orange, courage (Noah&#x27;s Ark), red, 1.5 million deaths on the genocide.

<text>The coat of arms of Belgium bears a lion or, known as Leo Belgicus (Latin for &quot;the Belgian lion&quot;), as its charge. This is in accordance with article 193 (originally 125) of the Belgian Constitution: &quot;The Belgian nation takes red, yellow and black as colours, and as state coat of arms the Belgian lion with the motto UNITY MAKES STRENGTH&quot;. A royal decree of 17 March 1837 determines the achievement to be used in the greater and the lesser version, respectively.

==History==
The newly independent Kingdom of Belgium decided to base its coat of arms and flag on the symbols used by the short-lived United Belgian States. These came into being after the Southern Netherlands threw off Austrian rule. It existed as an independent polity from January to December 1790. The Duchy of Brabant had taken the lead in the so-called Brabant Revolution, the insurrection against Emperor Joseph II, and afterwards dominated the United Netherlandish States. Therefore, the Lion of Brabant (sable, a lion rampant or, armed and langued gules) came to stand for the entire federation.

This was not without precedent. In the course of the Dutch Revolt the provinces rebelling against the rule of King Philip II adopted a common seal in 1578 showing the Leo Belgicus wearing a crown and holding a sword and a sheaf of arrows. The crown stood for sovereignty, the sword for the war against Spain and the arrows for the concord and unity among the rebellious provinces. At first the lion of the (Dutch) Republic of the United Provinces had the Brabant colours or on sable. It was only when most of Brabant was reconquered by Spain in the 1580s and Holland came to dominate the Republic, that the colours of the Dutch lion (or and gules) became the definitive tinctures of the arms of the United Provinces. The Dutch Revolt likewise provided the motto &quot;Unity Makes Strength&quot;. The inscription of the seal of 1578 reads (through unity small things grow), a quote taken from Sallust&#x27;s Jugurthine War. Soon Dutch sources used the translation . The United States of Belgium of 1790 used the Latin version . Their motto was in turn taken over and translated into French by the Kingdom of Belgium in 1831. It was only in 1958 that it was decided that the official Dutch translation should read .
==Belgian Lions (heraldry)==
==Variants==
===Greater version===
The shield is emblazoned: &quot;Sable, a lion rampant or, armed and langued gules&quot;. It is surmounted by a helmet with raised visor, with mantling or and sable and the royal crown in lieu of a crest. Behind the shield are placed a hand of justice and a sceptre with a lion. The grand collar of the Order of Leopold surrounds the shield. Two lions guardant proper support the shield as well as a lance with the national colours black, yellow and red. Underneath the compartment is placed the motto in French or Eendracht maakt macht in Dutch, or Unity Is Strength in English. The riband of the motto is red, with black stripes on either side. The lettering is golden. Since the Royal Decree of 1837 never received an official translation, the use of the Dutch version of the motto is customary rather than official. The whole is placed on a red mantle with ermine lining and golden fringes and tassels, ensigned with the royal crown. Above the mantle rise banners with the arms of the nine provinces that constituted Belgium in 1837. They are (from dexter to sinister) Antwerp, West Flanders, East Flanders, Liège, Brabant, Hainaut, Limburg, Luxembourg and Namur.

The greater arms are used only rarely. They adorn the great seal that is affixed to laws and international treaties.

Since the province of Brabant was split into Flemish Brabant, Walloon Brabant and Brussels in 1995, the greater arms no longer reflect the present territorial divisions of the state. The changes made to the arms of the Flemish provinces as a result of this decision are not reflected in the great seal either.

===Lesser version===
The lesser coat of arms (as used by the Belgian federal government, on passport covers and the official sites of the monarchy and of the government) consists of the shield, the royal crown, the crossed sceptres, the collar of the Order of Leopold and the motto.

=== Royal versions ===
A Royal Decree published on 19 July 2019 and signed on the same day, by King Philippe, reinstated the Saxonian escutcheon in all the royal versions of the family&#x27;s coat of arms. The reinstatement of the shield of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha into the royal arms occurred shortly after the visit of King Philippe and Queen Mathilde to the ancestral Friedenstein Castle. The king also added translations of the motto into the three official languages of Belgium, to reflect his wish &quot;to be the King of the whole Kingdom and of all Belgians&quot;. The latest royal decree therefore reverses previous changes made to the Royal versions of the coat arms which removed the armorial bearings of Saxony during the First World War.

;Reigning King&#x27;s or Queen&#x27;s (Royal Arms) version
Sable, a lion rampant or, armed and langued Gules charged on the shoulder with an escutcheon of the House of Wettin. The shield is surmounted by a golden helm with the Royal Crown of Belgium and lambrequin Or and Sable. The shield surrounded by the necklace of the Order of Leopold. The supporter are two lions guardant proper each supporting a lance Or with two National Flags of Belgium. Motto: &quot;Eendracht maakt macht&quot; - &quot;L&#x27;union fait la force&quot; - &quot;Einigkeit macht stark&quot;, in gold letters, on a ribbon Gules, edged Sable. The whole is placed on a mantle Purpure with ermine lining, fringes and tassels Or and ensigned with the Royal Crown of Belgium.

;Former King or Queen&#x27;s version
The Royal Arms difference with a label of three points Gules, the centre point bearing the royal crown Or. The shield is surmounted by the Royal Crown of Belgium.

;Duke or Duchess of Brabant version
The Royal Arms difference with a label of three points Or. The shield is surmounted by the Princely Crown of Belgium. The supporters each accompanied by a banner of gold, fringed likewise, bearing Sable, a golden lion, armed and langued Gules (Brabant).

;Other Princes or Princesses of Belgium of the male and female descent in direct line of King Leopold I
The Royal Arms difference with a narrow bordure Or. The shield is surmounted by the Princely Crown of Belgium.

;Other Princes or Princesses of Our Royal House
The Royal Arms difference with a narrow bordure Purpure. The shield is surmounted by the Princely Crown of Belgium.

<text>In physics, a rigid body, also known as a rigid object, is a solid body in which deformation is zero or negligible. The distance between any two given points on a rigid body remains constant in time regardless of external forces or moments exerted on it. A rigid body is usually considered as a continuous distribution of mass.

In the study of special relativity, a perfectly rigid body does not exist; and objects can only be assumed to be rigid if they are not moving near the speed of light. In quantum mechanics, a rigid body is usually thought of as a collection of point masses. For instance, molecules (consisting of the point masses: electrons and nuclei) are often seen as rigid bodies (see classification of molecules as rigid rotors).

==Principles==

=== Linear and angular position ===

The position of a rigid body is the position of all the particles of which it is composed. To simplify the description of this position, we exploit the property that the body is rigid, namely that all its particles maintain the same distance relative to each other. If the body is rigid, it is sufficient to describe the position of at least three non-collinear particles. This makes it possible to reconstruct the position of all the other particles, provided that their time-invariant position relative to the three selected particles is known. However, typically a different, mathematically more convenient, but equivalent approach is used. The position of the whole body is represented by:
# the &quot;linear position&quot; or &quot;position&quot; of the body, namely the position of one of the particles of the body, specifically chosen as a reference point (typically coinciding with the center of mass or centroid of the body), together with
# the &quot;angular position&quot; (also known as &quot;orientation&quot;, or &quot;attitude&quot;) of the body.

Thus, the position of a rigid body has two components: &quot;linear&quot; and &quot;angular&quot;, respectively. The same is true for other kinematic and kinetic quantities describing the motion of a rigid body, such as linear and angular velocity, acceleration, momentum, impulse, and kinetic energy.

The linear position can be represented by a vector with its tail at an arbitrary reference point in space (the origin of a chosen coordinate system) and its tip at an arbitrary point of interest on the rigid body, typically coinciding with its center of mass or centroid. This reference point may define the origin of a coordinate system fixed to the body.

There are several ways to numerically describe the orientation of a rigid body, including a set of three Euler angles, a quaternion, or a direction cosine matrix (also referred to as a rotation matrix). All these methods actually define the orientation of a basis set (or coordinate system) which has a fixed orientation relative to the body (i.e. rotates together with the body), relative to another basis set (or coordinate system), from which the motion of the rigid body is observed. For instance, a basis set with fixed orientation relative to an airplane can be defined as a set of three orthogonal unit vectors &quot;b&quot;1, &quot;b&quot;2, &quot;b&quot;3, such that &quot;b&quot;1 is parallel to the chord line of the wing and directed forward, &quot;b&quot;2 is normal to the plane of symmetry and directed rightward, and &quot;b&quot;3 is given by the cross product formula_1.

In general, when a rigid body moves, both its position and orientation vary with time. In the kinematic sense, these changes are referred to as &quot;translation&quot; and &quot;rotation&quot;, respectively. Indeed, the position of a rigid body can be viewed as a hypothetic translation and rotation (roto-translation) of the body starting from a hypothetic reference position (not necessarily coinciding with a position actually taken by the body during its motion).

=== Linear and angular velocity ===

&quot;Velocity&quot; (also called &quot;linear velocity&quot;) and &quot;angular velocity&quot; are measured with respect to a frame of reference.

The linear velocity of a rigid body is a vector quantity, equal to the time rate of change of its linear position. Thus, it is the velocity of a reference point fixed to the body. During purely translational motion (motion with no rotation), all points on a rigid body move with the same velocity. However, when motion involves rotation, the instantaneous velocity of any two points on the body will generally not be the same. Two points of a rotating body will have the same instantaneous velocity only if they happen to lie on an axis parallel to the instantaneous axis of rotation.

&quot;Angular velocity&quot; is a vector quantity that describes the angular speed at which the orientation of the rigid body is changing and the instantaneous axis about which it is rotating (the existence of this instantaneous axis is guaranteed by the Euler&#x27;s rotation theorem). All points on a rigid body experience the same angular velocity at all times. During purely rotational motion, all points on the body change position except for those lying on the instantaneous axis of rotation. The relationship between orientation and angular velocity is not directly analogous to the relationship between position and velocity. Angular velocity is not the time rate of change of orientation, because there is no such concept as an orientation vector that can be differentiated to obtain the angular velocity.

== Kinematical equations ==

=== Addition theorem for angular velocity ===

The angular velocity of a rigid body B in a reference frame N is equal to the sum of the angular velocity of a rigid body D in N and the angular velocity of B with respect to D:

:formula_2

In this case, rigid bodies and reference frames are indistinguishable and completely interchangeable.

=== Addition theorem for position ===

For any set of three points P, Q, and R, the position vector from P to R is the sum of the position vector from P to Q and the position vector from Q to R:

:formula_3

The norm of a position vector is the spatial distance.
Here the coordinates of all three vectors must be expressed in coordinate frames with the same orientation.

=== Mathematical definition of velocity ===

The velocity of point P in reference frame N is defined as the time derivative in N of the position vector from O to P:

:formula_4

where O is any arbitrary point fixed in reference frame N, and the N to the left of the d/d&quot;t&quot; operator indicates that the derivative is taken in reference frame N. The result is independent of the selection of O so long as O is fixed in N.

=== Mathematical definition of acceleration ===

The acceleration of point P in reference frame N is defined as the time derivative in N of its velocity:

:formula_5

=== Velocity of two points fixed on a rigid body ===

For two points P and Q that are fixed on a rigid body B, where B has an angular velocity formula_6 in the reference frame N, the velocity of Q in N can be expressed as a function of the velocity of P in N:

:formula_7

where formula_8 is the position vector from P to Q., with coordinates expressed in N (or a frame with the same orientation as N.) 
This relation can be derived from the temporal invariance of the norm distance between P and Q.

=== Acceleration of two points fixed on a rigid body ===

By differentiating the equation for the Velocity of two points fixed on a rigid body in N with respect to time, the acceleration in reference frame N of a point Q fixed on a rigid body B can be expressed as

:formula_9

where formula_10 is the angular acceleration of B in the reference frame N.

=== Angular velocity and acceleration of two points fixed on a rigid body ===

As mentioned above, all points on a rigid body B have the same angular velocity formula_11 in a fixed reference frame N, and thus the same angular acceleration formula_12

=== Velocity of one point moving on a rigid body ===

If the point R is moving in the rigid body B while B moves in reference frame N, then the velocity of R in N is

:formula_13

where Q is the point fixed in B that is instantaneously coincident with R at the instant of interest. This relation is often combined with the relation for the Velocity of two points fixed on a rigid body.

=== Acceleration of one point moving on a rigid body ===

The acceleration in reference frame N of the point R moving in body B while B is moving in frame N is given by

:formula_14

where Q is the point fixed in B that instantaneously coincident with R at the instant of interest. This equation is often combined with Acceleration of two points fixed on a rigid body.

=== Other quantities ===

If &quot;C&quot; is the origin of a local coordinate system &quot;L&quot;, attached to the body,
the spatial or twist acceleration of a rigid body is defined as the spatial acceleration of &quot;C&quot; (as opposed to material acceleration above): formula_15
where
*formula_16 represents the position of the point/particle with respect to the reference point of the body in terms of the local coordinate system &quot;L&quot; (the rigidity of the body means that this does not depend on time)
* formula_17 is the orientation matrix, an orthogonal matrix with determinant 1, representing the orientation (angular position) of the local coordinate system &quot;L&quot;, with respect to the arbitrary reference orientation of another coordinate system &quot;G&quot;. Think of this matrix as three orthogonal unit vectors, one in each column, which define the orientation of the axes of &quot;L&quot; with respect to &quot;G&quot;.
*formula_18 represents the angular velocity of the rigid body
*formula_19 represents the total velocity of the point/particle
*formula_20 represents the total acceleration of the point/particle
*formula_21 represents the angular acceleration of the rigid body
*formula_22 represents the spatial acceleration of the point/particle
*formula_23 represents the spatial acceleration of the rigid body (i.e. the spatial acceleration of the origin of &quot;L&quot;).

In 2D, the angular velocity is a scalar, and matrix A(t) simply represents a rotation in the &quot;xy&quot;-plane by an angle which is the integral of the angular velocity over time.

Vehicles, walking people, etc., usually rotate according to changes in the direction of the velocity: they move forward with respect to their own orientation. Then, if the body follows a closed orbit in a plane, the angular velocity integrated over a time interval in which the orbit is completed once, is an integer times 360°. This integer is the winding number with respect to the origin of the velocity. Compare the amount of rotation associated with the vertices of a polygon.

==Kinetics==
Any point that is rigidly connected to the body can be used as reference point (origin of coordinate system &quot;L&quot;) to describe the linear motion of the body (the linear position, velocity and acceleration vectors depend on the choice).

However, depending on the application, a convenient choice may be:
*the center of mass of the whole system, which generally has the simplest motion for a body moving freely in space;
*a point such that the translational motion is zero or simplified, e.g. on an axle or hinge, at the center of a ball and socket joint, etc.

When the center of mass is used as reference point:
*The (linear) momentum is independent of the rotational motion. At any time it is equal to the total mass of the rigid body times the translational velocity.
*The angular momentum with respect to the center of mass is the same as without translation: at any time it is equal to the inertia tensor times the angular velocity. When the angular velocity is expressed with respect to a coordinate system coinciding with the principal axes of the body, each component of the angular momentum is a product of a moment of inertia (a principal value of the inertia tensor) times the corresponding component of the angular velocity; the torque is the inertia tensor times the angular acceleration.
*Possible motions in the absence of external forces are translation with constant velocity, steady rotation about a fixed principal axis, and also torque-free precession.
*The net external force on the rigid body is always equal to the total mass times the translational acceleration (i.e., Newton&#x27;s second law holds for the translational motion, even when the net external torque is nonzero, and/or the body rotates).
*The total kinetic energy is simply the sum of translational and rotational energy.

==Geometry==

Two rigid bodies are said to be different (not copies) if there is no proper rotation from one to the other. 
A rigid body is called chiral if its mirror image is different in that sense, i.e., if it has either no symmetry or its symmetry group contains only proper rotations. In the opposite case an object is called achiral: the mirror image is a copy, not a different object. Such an object may have a symmetry plane, but not necessarily: there may also be a plane of reflection with respect to which the image of the object is a rotated version. The latter applies for &quot;S2n&quot;, of which the case &quot;n&quot; = 1 is inversion symmetry.

For a (rigid) rectangular transparent sheet, inversion symmetry corresponds to having on one side an image without rotational symmetry and on the other side an image such that what shines through is the image at the top side, upside down. We can distinguish two cases:
*the sheet surface with the image is not symmetric - in this case the two sides are different, but the mirror image of the object is the same, after a rotation by 180° about the axis perpendicular to the mirror plane.
*the sheet surface with the image has a symmetry axis - in this case the two sides are the same, and the mirror image of the object is also the same, again after a rotation by 180° about the axis perpendicular to the mirror plane.

A sheet with a through and through image is achiral. We can distinguish again two cases:
*the sheet surface with the image has no symmetry axis - the two sides are different
*the sheet surface with the image has a symmetry axis - the two sides are the same

==Configuration space==
The configuration space of a rigid body with one point fixed (i.e., a body with zero translational motion) is given by the underlying manifold of the rotation group SO(3). The configuration space of a nonfixed (with non-zero translational motion) rigid body is &quot;E&quot;+(3), the subgroup of direct isometries of the Euclidean group in three dimensions (combinations of translations and rotations).

<text>In the mathematical field of graph theory, a spanning tree &quot;T&quot; of an undirected graph &quot;G&quot; is a subgraph that is a tree which includes all of the vertices of &quot;G&quot;. In general, a graph may have several spanning trees, but a graph that is not connected will not contain a spanning tree (see about spanning forests below). If all of the edges of &quot;G&quot; are also edges of a spanning tree &quot;T&quot; of &quot;G&quot;, then &quot;G&quot; is a tree and is identical to &quot;T&quot; (that is, a tree has a unique spanning tree and it is itself).

==Applications==
Several pathfinding algorithms, including Dijkstra&#x27;s algorithm and the A* search algorithm, internally build a spanning tree as an intermediate step in solving the problem.

In order to minimize the cost of power networks, wiring connections, piping, automatic speech recognition, etc., people often use algorithms that gradually build a spanning tree (or many such trees) as intermediate steps in the process of finding the minimum spanning tree.

The Internet and many other telecommunications networks have transmission links that connect nodes together in a mesh topology that includes some loops.
In order to avoid bridge loops and routing loops, many routing protocols designed for such networks—including the Spanning Tree Protocol, Open Shortest Path First, Link-state routing protocol, Augmented tree-based routing, etc.—require each router to remember a spanning tree.&lt;ref name=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Spanning_tree&amp;action=edit#&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

A special kind of spanning tree, the Xuong tree, is used in topological graph theory to find graph embeddings with maximum genus. A Xuong tree is a spanning tree such that, in the remaining graph, the number of connected components with an odd number of edges is as small as possible. A Xuong tree and an associated maximum-genus embedding can be found in polynomial time.

==Definitions==
A tree is a connected undirected graph with no cycles. It is a spanning tree of a graph &quot;G&quot; if it spans &quot;G&quot; (that is, it includes every vertex of &quot;G&quot;) and is a subgraph of &quot;G&quot; (every edge in the tree belongs to &quot;G&quot;). A spanning tree of a connected graph &quot;G&quot; can also be defined as a maximal set of edges of &quot;G&quot; that contains no cycle, or as a minimal set of edges that connect all vertices.

===Fundamental cycles===
Adding just one edge to a spanning tree will create a cycle; such a cycle is called a fundamental cycle with respect to that tree. There is a distinct fundamental cycle for each edge not in the spanning tree; thus, there is a one-to-one correspondence between fundamental cycles and edges not in the spanning tree. For a connected graph with &quot;V&quot; vertices, any spanning tree will have &quot;V&quot; − 1 edges, and thus, a graph of &quot;E&quot; edges and one of its spanning trees will have &quot;E&quot; − &quot;V&quot; + 1 fundamental cycles (The number of edges subtracted by number of edges included in a spanning tree; giving the number of edges not included in the spanning tree). For any given spanning tree the set of all &quot;E&quot; − &quot;V&quot; + 1 fundamental cycles forms a cycle basis, i.e., a basis for the cycle space.

===Fundamental cutsets===
Dual to the notion of a fundamental cycle is the notion of a fundamental cutset with respect to a given spanning tree. By deleting just one edge of the spanning tree, the vertices are partitioned into two disjoint sets. The fundamental cutset is defined as the set of edges that must be removed from the graph &quot;G&quot; to accomplish the same partition. Thus, each spanning tree defines a set of &quot;V&quot; − 1 fundamental cutsets, one for each edge of the spanning tree.

The duality between fundamental cutsets and fundamental cycles is established by noting that cycle edges not in the spanning tree can only appear in the cutsets of the other edges in the cycle; and &quot;vice versa&quot;: edges in a cutset can only appear in those cycles containing the edge corresponding to the cutset. This duality can also be expressed using the theory of matroids, according to which a spanning tree is a base of the graphic matroid, a fundamental cycle is the unique circuit within the set formed by adding one element to the base, and fundamental cutsets are defined in the same way from the dual matroid.

===Spanning forests===
A collection of disjoint (unconnected) trees is described as a &quot;forest&quot;. A &quot;spanning forest&quot; in a graph is a subgraph that is a forest with an additional requirement. There are two incompatible requirements in use, of which one is relatively rare.

* Almost all graph theory books and articles define a spanning forest as a forest that spans all of the vertices, meaning only that each vertex of the graph is a vertex in the forest. A connected graph may have a disconnected spanning forest, such as the forest with no edges, in which each vertex forms a single-vertex tree.

* A few graph theory authors define a spanning forest to be a maximal acyclic subgraph of the given graph, or equivalently a subgraph consisting of a spanning tree in each connected component of the graph.

To avoid confusion between these two definitions, suggest the term &quot;full spanning forest&quot; for a spanning forest with the same number of components as the given graph (i.e., a maximal forest), while instead call this kind of forest a &quot;maximal spanning forest&quot; (which is redundant, as a maximal forest necessarily contains every vertex).

==Counting spanning trees==
The number &quot;t&quot;(&quot;G&quot;) of spanning trees of a connected graph is a well-studied invariant.

===In specific graphs===
In some cases, it is easy to calculate &quot;t&quot;(&quot;G&quot;) directly:
* If &quot;G&quot; is itself a tree, then .
* When &quot;G&quot; is the cycle graph &quot;Cn&quot; with &quot;n&quot; vertices, then .
* For a complete graph with &quot;n&quot; vertices, Cayley&#x27;s formula gives the number of spanning trees as .
* If &quot;G&quot; is the complete bipartite graph formula_1,then formula_2.
* For the &quot;n&quot;-dimensional hypercube graph formula_3, the number of spanning trees is formula_4.

===In arbitrary graphs===
More generally, for any graph &quot;G&quot;, the number &quot;t&quot;(&quot;G&quot;) can be calculated in polynomial time as the determinant of a matrix derived from the graph,
using Kirchhoff&#x27;s matrix-tree theorem.

Specifically, to compute &quot;t&quot;(&quot;G&quot;), one constructs the Laplacian matrix of the graph, a square matrix in which the rows and columns are both indexed by the vertices of &quot;G&quot;. The entry in row &quot;i&quot; and column &quot;j&quot; is one of three values:
* The degree of vertex &quot;i&quot;, if &quot;i&quot; = &quot;j&quot;,
* −1, if vertices &quot;i&quot; and &quot;j&quot; are adjacent, or
* 0, if vertices &quot;i&quot; and &quot;j&quot; are different from each other but not adjacent.
The resulting matrix is singular, so its determinant is zero. However, deleting the row and column for an arbitrarily chosen vertex leads to a smaller matrix whose determinant is exactly &quot;t&quot;(&quot;G&quot;).

===Deletion-contraction===
If &quot;G&quot; is a graph or multigraph and &quot;e&quot; is an arbitrary edge of &quot;G&quot;, then the number &quot;t&quot;(&quot;G&quot;) of spanning trees of &quot;G&quot; satisfies the &quot;deletion-contraction recurrence&quot;
&quot;t&quot;(&quot;G&quot;) = &quot;t&quot;(&quot;G&quot; − &quot;e&quot;) + &quot;t&quot;(&quot;G&quot;/&quot;e&quot;), where &quot;G&quot; − &quot;e&quot; is the multigraph obtained by deleting &quot;e&quot;
and &quot;G&quot;/&quot;e&quot; is the contraction of &quot;G&quot; by &quot;e&quot;. The term &quot;t&quot;(&quot;G&quot; − &quot;e&quot;) in this formula counts the spanning trees of &quot;G&quot; that do not use edge &quot;e&quot;, and the term &quot;t&quot;(&quot;G&quot;/&quot;e&quot;) counts the spanning trees of &quot;G&quot; that use &quot;e&quot;.

In this formula, if the given graph &quot;G&quot; is a multigraph, or if a contraction causes two vertices to be connected to each other by multiple edges,
then the redundant edges should not be removed, as that would lead to the wrong total. For instance a bond graph connecting two vertices by &quot;k&quot; edges has &quot;k&quot; different spanning trees, each consisting of a single one of these edges.

===Tutte polynomial===
The Tutte polynomial of a graph can be defined as a sum, over the spanning trees of the graph, of terms computed from the &quot;internal activity&quot; and &quot;external activity&quot; of the tree. Its value at the arguments (1,1) is the number of spanning trees or, in a disconnected graph, the number of maximal spanning forests.

The Tutte polynomial can also be computed using a deletion-contraction recurrence, but its computational complexity is high: for many values of its arguments, computing it exactly is #P-complete, and it is also hard to approximate with a guaranteed approximation ratio. The point (1,1), at which it can be evaluated using Kirchhoff&#x27;s theorem, is one of the few exceptions.

==Algorithms==

===Construction===
A single spanning tree of a graph can be found in linear time by either depth-first search or breadth-first search. Both of these algorithms explore the given graph, starting from an arbitrary vertex &quot;v&quot;, by looping through the neighbors of the vertices they discover and adding each unexplored neighbor to a data structure to be explored later. They differ in whether this data structure is a stack (in the case of depth-first search) or a queue (in the case of breadth-first search). In either case, one can form a spanning tree by connecting each vertex, other than the root vertex &quot;v&quot;, to the vertex from which it was discovered. This tree is known as a depth-first search tree or a breadth-first search tree according to the graph exploration algorithm used to construct it. Depth-first search trees are a special case of a class of spanning trees called Trémaux trees, named after the 19th-century discoverer of depth-first search.

Spanning trees are important in parallel and distributed computing, as a way of maintaining communications between a set of processors; see for instance the Spanning Tree Protocol used by OSI link layer devices or the Shout (protocol) for distributed computing. However, the depth-first and breadth-first methods for constructing spanning trees on sequential computers are not well suited for parallel and distributed computers. Instead, researchers have devised several more specialized algorithms for finding spanning trees in these models of computation.

===Optimization===
In certain fields of graph theory it is often useful to find a minimum spanning tree of a weighted graph. Other optimization problems on spanning trees have also been studied, including the maximum spanning tree, the minimum tree that spans at least k vertices, the spanning tree with the fewest edges per vertex, the spanning tree with the largest number of leaves, the spanning tree with the fewest leaves (closely related to the Hamiltonian path problem), the minimum-diameter spanning tree, and the minimum dilation spanning tree.

Optimal spanning tree problems have also been studied for finite sets of points in a geometric space such as the Euclidean plane. For such an input, a spanning tree is again a tree that has as its vertices the given points. The quality of the tree is measured in the same way as in a graph, using the Euclidean distance between pairs of points as the weight for each edge. Thus, for instance, a Euclidean minimum spanning tree is the same as a graph minimum spanning tree in a complete graph with Euclidean edge weights. However, it is not necessary to construct this graph in order to solve the optimization problem; the Euclidean minimum spanning tree problem, for instance, can be solved more efficiently in &quot;O&quot;(&quot;n&quot; log &quot;n&quot;) time by constructing the Delaunay triangulation and then applying a linear time planar graph minimum spanning tree algorithm to the resulting triangulation.

===Randomization===
A spanning tree chosen randomly from among all the spanning trees with equal probability is called a uniform spanning tree. Wilson&#x27;s algorithm can be used to generate uniform spanning trees in polynomial time by a process of taking a random walk on the given graph and erasing the cycles created by this walk.

An alternative model for generating spanning trees randomly but not uniformly is the random minimal spanning tree. In this model, the edges of the graph are assigned random weights and then the minimum spanning tree of the weighted graph is constructed.

===Enumeration===
Because a graph may have exponentially many spanning trees, it is not possible to list them all in polynomial time. However, algorithms are known for listing all spanning trees in polynomial time per tree.

==In infinite graphs==
Every finite connected graph has a spanning tree. However, for infinite connected graphs, the existence of spanning trees is equivalent to the axiom of choice. An infinite graph is connected if each pair of its vertices forms the pair of endpoints of a finite path. As with finite graphs, a tree is a connected graph with no finite cycles, and a spanning tree can be defined either as a maximal acyclic set of edges or as a tree that contains every vertex.

The trees within a graph may be partially ordered by their subgraph relation, and any infinite chain in this partial order has an upper bound (the union of the trees in the chain). Zorn&#x27;s lemma, one of many equivalent statements to the axiom of choice, requires that a partial order in which all chains are upper bounded have a maximal element; in the partial order on the trees of the graph, this maximal element must be a spanning tree. Therefore, if Zorn&#x27;s lemma is assumed, every infinite connected graph has a spanning tree.

In the other direction, given a family of sets, it is possible to construct an infinite graph such that every spanning tree of the graph corresponds to a choice function of the family of sets. Therefore,
if every infinite connected graph has a spanning tree, then the axiom of choice is true.

==In directed multigraphs==
The idea of a spanning tree can be generalized to directed multigraphs. Given a vertex &quot;v&quot; on a directed multigraph &quot;G&quot;, an &quot;oriented spanning tree&quot; &quot;T&quot; rooted at &quot;v&quot; is an acyclic subgraph of &quot;G&quot; in which every vertex other than &quot;v&quot; has outdegree 1. This definition is only satisfied when the &quot;branches&quot; of &quot;T&quot; point towards &quot;v&quot;.

<doc id="455771" wikidata="Q466938" url="?curid=455771" title="Subsidiarity">
<text>Subsidiarity is a principle of social organization that holds that social and political issues should be dealt with at the most immediate or local level that is consistent with their resolution. The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; defines subsidiarity as &quot;the principle that a central authority should have a subsidiary function, performing only those tasks which cannot be performed at a more local level&quot;. The concept is applicable in the fields of government, political science, neuropsychology, cybernetics, management and in military command (mission command). The OED adds that the term &quot;subsidiarity&quot; in English follows the early German usage of &quot;Subsidiarität&quot;. More distantly, it is derived from the Latin verb &quot;subsidio&quot; (to aid or help), and the related noun &quot;subsidium&quot; (aid or assistance).

The development of the concept of subsidiarity has roots in the natural law philosophy of Thomas Aquinas and was mediated by the social scientific theories of Luigi Taparelli, SJ, in his 1840–43 natural law treatise on the human person in society. In that work, Taparelli established the criteria of just social order, which he referred to as &quot;hypotactical right&quot; and which came to be termed subsidiarity following German influences.

Another origin of the concept is in the writings of Calvinist law-philosopher Johannes Althaus who used the word &quot;subsidia&quot; in 1603. As a principle of just social order, it became one of the pillars of modern Catholic social teaching. Subsidiarity is a general principle of European Union law. In the United States of America, Article VI, Paragraph 2 of the constitution of the United States is known as the Supremacy Clause. This establishes that the federal constitution, and federal law generally, take precedence over state laws, and even state constitutions. The principle of States&#x27; Rights is sometimes interpreted as being established by the Tenth Amendment, which says that &quot;The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.&quot;

== Political theory ==
Alexis de Tocqueville&#x27;s classic study, &quot;Democracy in America&quot;, may be viewed as an examination of the operation of the principle of subsidiarity in early 19th century America. Tocqueville noted that the French Revolution began with &quot;a push towards decentralization… in the end, an extension of centralization&quot;. He wrote that &quot;Decentralization has, not only an administrative value, but also a civic dimension, since it increases the opportunities for citizens to take interest in public affairs; it makes them get accustomed to using freedom. And from the accumulation of these local, active, persnickety freedoms, is born the most efficient counterweight against the claims of the central government, even if it were supported by an impersonal, collective will.&quot;
As Christian Democratic political parties were formed, they adopted the Catholic social teaching of subsidiarity, as well as the neo-Calvinist theological teaching of sphere sovereignty, with both Catholics and Protestants agreeing &quot;that the principles of sphere sovereignty and subsidiarity boiled down to the same thing&quot;.

The term &quot;subsidiarity&quot; is also used to refer to a tenet of some forms of conservative or libertarian thought in the United States. For example, conservative author Reid Buckley writes:

Will the American people never learn that, as a principle, to expect swift response and efficiency from government is fatuous? Will we never heed the principle of subsidiarity (in which our fathers were bred), namely that no public agency should do what a private agency can do better, and that no higher-level public agency should attempt to do what a lower-level agency can do better – that to the degree the principle of subsidiarity is violated, first local government, the state government, and then federal government wax in inefficiency? Moreover, the more powers that are invested in government, and the more powers that are wielded by government, the less well does government discharge its primary responsibilities, which are (1) defence of the commonwealth, (2) protection of the rights of citizens, and (3) support of just order.

The United Nations Development Programme&#x27;s 1999 report on decentralisation noted that subsidiarity was an important principle. It quoted one definition:

According to Richard Macrory, the positive effects of a political/economic system governed by the principle of subsidiarity include:
* Systemic failures of the type seen in the crash of 2007/08 can largely be avoided, since diverse solutions to common problems avoid common mode failure.
* Individual and group initiative is given maximum scope to solve problems.
* The systemic problem of moral hazard is largely avoided. In particular, the vexing problem of atrophied local initiative/responsibility is avoided.

He writes that the negative effects of a political/economic system governed by the principle of subsidiarity include:
* When a genuine principle of liberty is recognised by a higher political entity but not all subsidiary entities, implementation of that principle can be delayed at the more local level.
* When a genuinely efficacious economic principle is recognised by a higher political entity, but not all subsidiary entities, implementation of that principle can be delayed at the more local level.
* In areas where the local use of common resources has a broad regional, or even global, impact, higher levels of authority may have a natural mandate to supersede local authority.

== General principle of European Union law ==


Subsidiarity is perhaps presently best known as a general principle of European Union law. According to this principle, the Union may only act (i.e. make laws) collectively where independent action of individual countries is insufficient without equal action by other members. The principle was established in the 1992 Treaty of Maastricht. However, at the local level it was already a key element of the European Charter of Local Self-Government, an instrument of the Council of Europe promulgated in 1985 (see Article 4, Paragraph 3 of the Charter) (which states that the exercise of public responsibilities should be decentralised). Subsidiarity is related in essence to, but should not be confused with, the concept of a margin of appreciation.

Subsidiarity was established in EU law by the Treaty of Maastricht, which was signed on 7 February 1992 and entered into force on 1 November 1993. The present formulation is contained in Article 5(3) of the Treaty on European Union (consolidated version following the Treaty of Lisbon, which entered into force on 1 December 2009):
Under the principle of subsidiarity, in areas which do not fall within its exclusive competence, the Union shall act only if and in so far as the objectives of the proposed action cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States, either at central level or at regional and local level, but can rather, by reason of the scale or effects of the proposed action, be better achieved at Union level.

The national parliaments of EU member states have an &quot;early warning mechanism&quot; whereby if one third raise an objection – a &quot;yellow card&quot; – on the basis that the principle of subsidiarity has been violated, then the proposal must be reviewed. If a majority do so – an &quot;orange card&quot; – then the council or parliament can vote it down immediately. If the logistical problems of putting this into practice are overcome, then the power of the national parliaments could be deemed an extra legislature, without a common debate or physical location: dubbed by EUObserver a &quot;virtual third chamber&quot;.

A more descriptive analysis of the principle can be found in Protocol 2 to the European Treaties.

===Court of Justice===
The Court of Justice of the European Union in Luxembourg is the authority that has to decide whether a regulation falls within the exclusive competence of the Union, as defined by the Treaty on European Union and its predecessors. As the concept of subsidiarity has a political as well as a legal dimension, the Court of Justice has a reserved attitude toward judging whether EU legislation is consistent with the concept. The Court will examine only marginally whether the principle is fulfilled. A detailed explanation of the legislation is not required; it is enough that the EU institutions explain why national legislation seems inadequate and that Union law has an added value.

An example is the judgment of the Court of Justice of the European Union in a legal action taken by the Federal Republic of Germany against the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union concerning a Directive on deposit guarantee schemes (13 May 1997). Germany argued that the Directive did not explain how it was compatible with the principle of subsidiarity. The Court answered:

<doc id="455777" wikidata="Q242039" url="?curid=455777" title="IEEE 802.15.4">
<text>IEEE 802.15.4 is a technical standard that defines the operation of a low-rate wireless personal area network (LR-WPAN). It specifies the physical layer and media access control for LR-WPANs, and is maintained by the IEEE 802.15 working group, which defined the standard in 2003. It is the basis for the Zigbee, ISA100.11a, WirelessHART, MiWi, 6LoWPAN, Thread and SNAP specifications, each of which further extends the standard by developing the upper layers, which are not defined in IEEE 802.15.4. In particular, 6LoWPAN defines a binding for the IPv6 version of the Internet Protocol (IP) over WPANs, and is itself used by upper layers such as Thread.

== Overview ==
IEEE standard 802.15.4 is intended to offer the fundamental lower network layers of a type of wireless personal area network (WPAN), which focuses on low-cost, low-speed ubiquitous communication between devices. It can be contrasted with other approaches, such as Wi-Fi, which offers more bandwidth and requires more power. The emphasis is on very low-cost communication of nearby devices with little to no underlying infrastructure, intending to exploit this to lower power consumption even more.

The basic framework conceives a 10-meter communications range with line of sight at a transfer rate of 250 kbit/s. Bandwidth tradeoffs are possible to favor more radically embedded devices with even lower power requirements for increased battery operating time, through the definition of not one, but several physical layers. Lower transfer rates of 20 and 40 kbit/s were initially defined, with the 100 kbit/s rate being added in the current revision.

Even lower rates can be used, which results in lower power consumption. As already mentioned, the main goal of IEEE 802.15.4 regarding WPANs is the emphasis on achieving low manufacturing and operating costs through the use of relatively simple transceivers, while enabling application flexibility and adaptability.

Key 802.15.4 features include:
# Suitability for real-time applications with reservation of Guaranteed Time Slots (GTS).
# Collision avoidance through CSMA/CA.
# Integrated support for secure communications.
# Power management functions to adjust compromises of link speed and quality and energy detection.
# Support for time- and data-rate–sensitive applications through the ability to operate with either CSMA/CA or TDMA access modes. The TDMA mode of operation is supported via the GTS feature of the standard.
# IEEE 802.15.4-conformant devices may use one of three possible frequency bands for operation (868/915/2450 MHz).

== Protocol architecture ==
 Devices are designed to interact with each other over a conceptually simple wireless network. The definition of the network layers is based on the OSI model; although only the lower layers are defined in the standard, interaction with upper layers is intended, possibly using an IEEE 802.2 logical link control sublayer accessing the MAC through a convergence sublayer. Implementations may rely on external devices or be purely embedded, self-functioning devices.

=== The physical layer ===
The physical layer is the bottom layer in the OSI reference model used worldwide, and protocols layers transmit packets using it

The &quot;physical layer&quot; (PHY) provides the data transmission service. It also, provides an interface to the &quot;physical layer management entity&quot;, which offers access to every physical layer management function and maintains a database of information on related personal area networks. Thus, the PHY manages the physical radio transceiver, performs channel selection along with energy and signal management functions. It operates on one of three possible unlicensed frequency bands:
* 868.0–868.6 MHz: Europe, allows one communication channel (2003, 2006, 2011) 
* 902–928 MHz: North America, originally allowed up to ten channels (2003), but since has been extended to thirty (2006)
* 2400–2483.5 MHz: worldwide use, up to sixteen channels (2003, 2006)
The original 2003 version of the standard specifies two physical layers based on &quot;direct-sequence spread spectrum&quot; (DSSS) techniques: one working in the 868/915 MHz bands with transfer rates of 20 and 40 kbit/s, and one in the 2450 MHz band with a rate of 250 kbit/s.

The 2006 revision improves the maximum data rates of the 868/915 MHz bands, bringing them up to support 100 and 250 kbit/s as well. Moreover, it goes on to define four physical layers depending on the modulation method used. Three of them preserve the DSSS approach: in the 868/915 MHz bands, using either binary or, optionally, offset quadrature phase-shift keying (QPSK); in the 2450 MHz band, using QPSK.

An optional alternative 868/915 MHz layer is defined using a combination of binary keying and amplitude-shift keying (thus based on parallel, not sequential, spread spectrum; PSSS). Dynamic switching between supported 868/915 MHz PHYs is possible.

Beyond these three bands, the IEEE 802.15.4c study group considered the newly opened 314–316 MHz, 430–434 MHz, and 779–787 MHz bands in China, while the IEEE 802.15 Task Group 4d defined an amendment to 802.15.4-2006 to support the new 950–956 MHz band in Japan. The first standard amendments by these groups were released in April 2009.

In August 2007, IEEE 802.15.4a was released expanding the four PHYs available in the earlier 2006 version to six, including one PHY using direct sequence ultra-wideband (UWB) and another using chirp spread spectrum (CSS). The UWB PHY is allocated frequencies in three ranges: below 1 GHz, between 3 and 5 GHz, and between 6 and 10 GHz. The CSS PHY is allocated spectrum in the 2450 MHz ISM band.

In April, 2009 IEEE 802.15.4c and IEEE 802.15.4d were released expanding the available PHYs with several additional PHYs: one for 780 MHz band using O-QPSK or MPSK, another for 950 MHz using GFSK or BPSK.

IEEE 802.15.4e was chartered to define a MAC amendment to the existing standard 802.15.4-2006 which adopts a channel hopping strategy to improve support for the industrial market. Channel hopping increases robustness against external interference and persistent multi-path fading. On February 6, 2012, the IEEE Standards Association Board approved IEEE 802.15.4e which concluded all Task Group 4e efforts.

=== The MAC layer ===
The medium access control (MAC) enables the transmission of MAC frames through the use of the physical channel. Besides the data service, it offers a management interface and itself manages access to the physical channel and network beaconing. It also controls frame validation, guarantees time slots and handles node associations. Finally, it offers hook points for secure services.

Note that the IEEE 802.15 standard does &quot;not&quot; use 802.1D or 802.1Q; i.e., it does not exchange standard Ethernet frames. The physical frame-format is specified in IEEE802.15.4-2011 in section 5.2. It is tailored to the fact that most IEEE 802.15.4 PHYs only support frames of up to 127 bytes (adaptation layer protocols such as the IETF&#x27;s 6LoWPAN provide fragmentation schemes to support larger network layer packets).

=== Higher layers ===
No higher-level layers or interoperability sublayers are defined in the standard. Other specifications, such as Zigbee, SNAP, and 6LoWPAN/Thread, build on this standard. RIOT, OpenWSN, TinyOS, Unison RTOS, DSPnano RTOS, nanoQplus, Contiki and Zephyr operating systems also use some components of IEEE 802.15.4 hardware and software.

== Network model ==

=== Node types ===
The standard defines two types of network node.

The first one is the full-function device (FFD). It can serve as the coordinator of a personal area network just as it may function as a common node. It implements a general model of communication which allows it to talk to any other device: it may also relay messages, in which case it is dubbed a coordinator (PAN coordinator when it is in charge of the whole network).

On the other hand, there are reduced-function devices (RFD). These are meant to be extremely simple devices with very modest resource and communication requirements; due to this, they can only communicate with FFDs and can never act as coordinators.

=== Topologies ===


Networks can be built as either peer-to-peer or star networks. However, every network needs at least one FFD to work as the coordinator of the network. Networks are thus formed by groups of devices separated by suitable distances. Each device has a unique 64-bit identifier, and if some conditions are met, short 16-bit identifiers can be used within a restricted environment. Namely, within each PAN domain, communications will probably use short identifiers.

Peer-to-peer (or point-to-point) networks can form arbitrary patterns of connections, and their extension is only limited by the distance between each pair of nodes. They are meant to serve as the basis for ad hoc networks capable of performing self-management and organization. Since the standard does not define a network layer, routing is not directly supported, but such an additional layer can add support for multihop communications. Further topological restrictions may be added; the standard mentions the cluster tree as a structure which exploits the fact that an RFD may only be associated with one FFD at a time to form a network where RFDs are exclusively leaves of a tree, and most of the nodes are FFDs. The structure can be extended as a generic mesh network whose nodes are cluster tree networks with a local coordinator for each cluster, in addition to the global coordinator.

A more structured star pattern is also supported, where the coordinator of the network will necessarily be the central node. Such a network can originate when an FFD decides to create its own PAN and declare itself its coordinator, after choosing a unique PAN identifier. After that, other devices can join the network, which is fully independent from all other star networks.

== Data transport architecture ==
Frames are the basic unit of data transport, of which there are four fundamental types (data, acknowledgment, beacon and MAC command frames), which provide a reasonable tradeoff between simplicity and robustness. Additionally, a superframe structure, defined by the coordinator, may be used, in which case two beacons act as its limits and provide synchronization to other devices as well as configuration information. A superframe consists of sixteen equal-length slots, which can be further divided into an active part and an inactive part, during which the coordinator may enter power saving mode, not needing to control its network.

Within superframes contention occurs between their limits, and is resolved by CSMA/CA. Every transmission must end before the arrival of the second beacon. As mentioned before, applications with well-defined bandwidth needs can use up to seven domains of one or more contentionless guaranteed time slots, trailing at the end of the superframe. The first part of the superframe must be sufficient to give service to the network structure and its devices. Superframes are typically utilized within the context of low-latency devices, whose associations must be kept even if inactive for long periods of time.

Data transfers to the coordinator require a beacon synchronization phase, if applicable, followed by CSMA/CA transmission (by means of slots if superframes are in use); acknowledgment is optional. Data transfers from the coordinator usually follow device requests: if beacons are in use, these are used to signal requests; the coordinator acknowledges the request and then sends the data in packets which are acknowledged by the device. The same is done when superframes are not in use, only in this case there are no beacons to keep track of pending messages.

Point-to-point networks may either use unslotted CSMA/CA or synchronization mechanisms; in this case, communication between any two devices is possible, whereas in &quot;structured&quot; modes one of the devices must be the network coordinator.

In general, all implemented procedures follow a typical request-confirm/indication-response classification.

== Reliability and security ==
The physical medium is accessed through a CSMA/CA access method. Networks which are not using beaconing mechanisms utilize an unslotted variation which is based on the listening of the medium, leveraged by a random exponential backoff algorithm; acknowledgments do not adhere to this discipline. Common data transmission utilizes unallocated slots when beaconing is in use; again, confirmations do not follow the same process.

Confirmation messages may be optional under certain circumstances, in which case a success assumption is made. Whatever the case, if a device is unable to process a frame at a given time, it simply does not confirm its reception: timeout-based retransmission can be performed a number of times, following after that a decision of whether to abort or keep trying.

Because the predicted environment of these devices demands maximization of battery life, the protocols tend to favor the methods which lead to it, implementing periodic checks for pending messages, the frequency of which depends on application needs.

Regarding secure communications, the MAC sublayer offers facilities which can be harnessed by upper layers to achieve the desired level of security. Higher-layer processes may specify keys to perform symmetric cryptography to protect the payload and restrict it to a group of devices or just a point-to-point link; these groups of devices can be specified in access control lists. Furthermore, MAC computes &quot;freshness checks&quot; between successive receptions to ensure that presumably old frames, or data which is no longer considered valid, does not transcend to higher layers.

In addition to this secure mode, there is another, insecure MAC mode, which allows access control lists merely as a means to decide on the acceptance of frames according to their (presumed) source.

<text>Lunda, also known as Chilunda, is a Bantu language spoken in Zambia, Angola, and, to a lesser extent, in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). Lunda and its dialects are spoken and understood by perhaps 8.6% of Zambians (1986 estimate), and the language is used mainly in the Northwestern province of Zambia. The majority of the Lunda can be found in DRC, especially Katanga Province, as well as in Angola. A small number of Lunda dialects are represented in Namibia.

<text>&lt;section begin=&quot;Aus infobox&quot; /&gt;
&lt;section end=&quot;Aus infobox&quot; /&gt;

The 1998 Australian federal election was held to determine the members of the 39th Parliament of Australia. It was held on 3 October 1998. All 148 seats of the House of Representatives and 40 seats of the 76 seat Senate were up for election. The incumbent centre-right Liberal/National Coalition government led by Prime Minister John Howard of the Liberal Party and coalition partner Tim Fischer of the National Party defeated the centre-left Australian Labor Party opposition led by Opposition Leader Kim Beazley, despite losing the nationwide popular and two-party preferred vote. However, the Australian Labor Party gained seats compared to the previous election.

Entering parliament at this election were future Prime Ministers Kevin Rudd and Julia Gillard, future Liberal deputy leader and future Minister of Foreign Affairs Julie Bishop, future Deputy Prime Minister Wayne Swan and future Speaker Anna Burke.

==Background==
The election returned the Member of the House of Representatives for its 1998–2001 term and half of Australia&#x27;s senators, who then served in the 1999–2002 Senate.

Despite winning almost 51 percent of the two-party-preferred vote and regaining much of what it had lost in its severe defeat of two years earlier, Labor fell short of forming government. The government was re-elected with 49.02% of the two-party-preferred vote, compared to 50.98% for the Australian Labor Party, the largest difference of six election results where the winner did not gain a two-party preferred majority, since 2PP results first estimated from 1937.
The election on 3 October 1998 was held six months earlier than required by the Constitution. Prime Minister John Howard made the announcement following the launch of the coalition&#x27;s Goods and Services Tax (GST) policy launch and a five-week advertising campaign. The ensuing election was almost entirely dominated by the proposed 10% GST and proposed income tax cuts. This election was not the first to be centred on a GST the 1993 election saw the Keating Labor government re-elected after a proposal by then Opposition leader John Hewson to introduce a 15% GST.

In reaction to One Nation&#x27;s policies, the other significant parties all agreed to preference against One Nation. One Nation lost its lone house seat when founder and leader Pauline Hanson lost on preferences to Liberal candidate Cameron Thompson in the Queensland electorate of Blair. In Queensland, One Nation polled 14.83% of the Senate vote, sufficient to elect one senator without the need for preferences.
The seat initially went to Heather Hill, but she was subsequently disqualified under Section 44 of the Constitution, and replaced by Len Harris.

The election-eve Newspoll reported Labor on a 53 percent two-party-preferred vote.

On election night of 3 October, the exit poll showed Labor on a 53 percent two-party-preferred vote. Labor made the single biggest gain by an Opposition party following an election defeat; the Coalition&#x27;s majority was cut from 40 to 12. It was only when the first returns trickled in from Western Australia that the Coalition was assured of another term. The swing across all states would have normally been sufficient for a change of government, but the uneven nature of the swing left Kim Beazley eight seats short of becoming prime minister.
The uneven nature of the swing saw Labor getting huge swings in seats that they held prior to the election but not enough in seats needed to gain government.

The election for the division of Newcastle was deferred as the candidate died on 1 October, two days before the federal election. A supplementary election was held on 21 November, with Labor winning and holding the seat.

==Results==
===House of Representatives results===


===Senate results===


==House of Representatives preference flows==
* The Nationals had candidates in 13 seats where three-cornered-contests existed, with 88.89% of preferences favouring the Liberal Party.
* One Nation contested 135 electorates with preferences slightly favouring the Liberal/National Coalition (53.66%)
* The Democrats contested 144 electorates with preferences slightly favouring Labor (56.72%)
* The Greens contested 120 electorates with preferences strongly favouring Labor (73.28%)

==Seats changing hands==

* The Labor Party retained the seat of Oxley (Qld) which was became Labor-held in the redistribution.

<text>Jack Donovan Foley (April 12, 1891 – November 9, 1967) was an American sound effects artist who was the developer of many sound effect techniques used in filmmaking. He is credited with developing a unique method for performing sound effects live and in synchrony with the picture during a film&#x27;s post-production. Accordingly, individuals engaged in this trade are called &quot;Foley artists&quot;.

He worked on pictures such as &quot;Melody of Love&quot; (1928), &quot;Show Boat&quot; (1929), &quot;Dat Ol&#x27; Ribber&quot;, &quot;Dracula&quot; (1931), &quot;Spartacus&quot; (1960), and &quot;Operation Petticoat&quot; (1959). For his work in Hollywood, Foley received the Motion Picture Sound Editors&#x27; Golden Reel Award.

== Early life and career ==
Jack Foley was born on April 12, 1891, in Yorkville, New York, to Irish immigrants Margaret Donavon and Michael Foley. Foley was raised in the area of Coney Island. Foley&#x27;s parents were separated as Margaret lived with her father and four sisters. When Foley was sixteen, Margaret married Michael Gilmartin, the son of Sligo immigrants. Foley&#x27;s biological father worked at the docks and was a volunteer firefighter as well as a singer and songwriter for local pubs. Foley grew up with James Cagney, Arthur Murray, and Bert Lahr being among his classmates. Foley&#x27;s first job was as a clerk at the New York docks. During this time, Foley married Beatrice Rehm. They married in secret as Foley was Catholic, and Rehm was Protestant.

In 1914, Foley and his wife moved to Bishop, California, as Foley disliked the New York weather. While in Bishop, during World War I, Foley worked for the American Defense Society guarding the Los Angeles water supply to ensure the water wasn&#x27;t poisoned. He also worked at a Bishop hardware store. During this time, Foley became involved in the theatre and composed a few plays. He also wrote and drew comics for the local newspaper.

During the early 1920s, many farm owners began selling their land to the city of Los Angeles for water rights as the city was growing at a rapid pace. This led to a decrease in wages for many of the locals, particularly those who worked in stores. Being personally affected, Foley began contacting several people he knew in the film industry. Along with the town&#x27;s storekeepers, Foley led a publicity campaign to bring the film industry to Bishop to help stimulate the local economy. This endeavor was a success for Foley as he then scouted locations for film productions. This also led to Foley eventually working for Universal in various capacities, from a stuntman to a silent movie director.

By the latter half of the 1920s, sound was introduced in films. Many production companies began looking to incorporate sound in their movies. Foley became involved with this new aspect in the film industry and worked with sound for movies such as &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot; (1925), &quot;The Jazz Singer&quot; (1927) and &quot;Tarzan the Tiger&quot; (1929), in which he voiced the first Tarzan yell. It wasn&#x27;t until &quot;Show Boat&quot; (1929) when Foley&#x27;s career took off as he helped create sound effects for the movie which led to the name Foley effects. After this movie, Foley solely focused on sound for his career in the film industry. Foley worked for close to thirty years incorporating Foley sounds in movies, such as &quot;Dracula&quot; (1931) and &quot;Spartacus&quot; (1960). He helped bring movies to life by recording everyday sounds, such as chewing, knocking on wood, and footsteps. Foley made sound a critical aspect of movie productions.

Foley won awards for his work, including the Golden Reel Award. The Motion Picture Sound Editors society honored Foley after his retirement in the early 1960s. Jack Foley passed away on November 9, 1967, at the age of 76. Foley himself calculated that he had walked over making sounds for films, and his work and legacy are still remembered to this day.

<text>The Longest Journey () is a 1999 point-and-click adventure video game, developed by Norwegian studio Funcom for Microsoft Windows; an iOS version was later developed and released on October 28, 2014, but was never upgraded for compatibility for the 64-bit only iOS 11 and later.

Written by Ragnar Tørnquist, the story sees players assume the role of a young art student who is thrust into an emerging situation that seeks to undo a delicate balance that has kept two worlds separate. The game&#x27;s setting is notable for featuring locations set on two worlds - one being a futuristic version of Earth with many science fiction elements, and another incorporating elements of high fantasy.

The game proved a commercial success upon release, selling in excess of 500,000 units by 2004, with critics praising it for its female protagonist and complex storyline, though with some criticism for some of its puzzles. Its success later spawned two sequels - in 2006, considered a spin-off of the original game; and &quot;Dreamfall Chapters&quot;, an episodic sequel released over two years between 2014 and 2016.

==Gameplay==

&quot;The Longest Journey&quot; is a point-and-click adventure game where the player interacts with objects on the screen to solve puzzles and advance the story. The game features expansive recorded dialogue, most of which is non-essential to completing the game but contributes to the setting.

==Plot==
The game takes place in the parallel universes of magic-dominated Arcadia and industrial Stark. The protagonist, April Ryan, is an 18-year-old art student living in Stark, identified as a &#x27;Shifter&#x27; capable of movement between these worlds, and tasked with restoring their essential Balance.
The story begins in Stark, where a sleeping April unintentionally shifts to Arcadia and meets the &#x27;White Dragon&#x27;, who identifies her as the heroine of the coming story. Upon learning this, April is attacked by a dark &#x27;Chaos Vortex&#x27; and awakens in Stark, where she dismisses her experience as a nightmare. The character &#x27;Cortez&#x27; later surprises her by revealing his knowledge.

When surreal activity begins affecting her friends, April meets again with Cortez, who transports her to the Arcadian city Marcuria. There she meets Tobias Grensret, Vestrum of the Sentinel; learns Alltongue, the common language in Arcadia; and hears from Tobias that the Balance protecting both worlds is dissolving after the dereliction of its Guardian, and must be restored by the appearance of another.

To return to Stark, April visits Brian Westhouse, a friend of Cortez, who assists her return; Cortez then tells her of the organization known as the Vanguard or Church of Voltec. The next day, April consults Warren Hughes, a homeless boy who agrees to help April if she erases his criminal record and locates his missing sister, in doing which April finds a data cube on the Church of Voltec. Hughes then refers her to a hacker named Burns Flipper, who reveals that the wealthy magnate Jacob McAllen is head of the Vanguard, assisted by Gordon Halloway, a former candidate for Guardianship divided by the Vanguard into Chaos (in Arcadia) and Logic (in Stark), and gives her a false identification by which to infiltrate the Vanguard through its front company MTI.

Meeting Cortez and Father Raul in a Catholic cathedral, April is told that Arcadia is on the brink of war. Later in Arcadia, April meets the innkeeper, Benrime Salmin, and the clairvoyant Abnaxus, ambassador of the Venar, who identifies the coming danger. In the morning, April learns of four magical species, each of whom has prophecies of a savior who will restore the Balance, only to finally break it – and determines to visit one such species, the winged Alatian of the island Alais, having gained sea-travel by rescuing a talking bird that she names Crow. Before departing, she learns that she must defeat an alchemist named Roper Klacks, in order to free the ships&#x27; wind that he holds captive.

At Roper Klacks&#x27; Tower, April challenges Klacks to use his magic against her calculator, and wins. Immediately before her departure to Alais, Tobias gives April the Talisman representing the Balance. &quot;En route&quot;, April kills the monster known as &#x27;Gribbler&#x27; while rescuing one of her captive Banda, whose species later give her the name &#x27;April Bandu-embata&#x27; as a mark of gratitude and grant her part of the disc necessary to restore the Balance.

On the voyage to Alais, a &#x27;Chaos Storm&#x27; attacks the ship, and April sabotages the ship&#x27;s compass to restore its course. When the ship&#x27;s captain seizes her Talisman, April attempts to retrieve it, and in so doing sinks the ship, whereupon the crew abandon her on a raft. She is taken prisoner by the Maerum, a Mermaid-like species related to the Alatian, but currently their enemies. In revealing their common ancestry, April fulfills a prophecy of the &#x27;Waterstiller&#x27;, a foretold savior of the Maerum.

After fulfilling the second prophecy by killing a &#x27;Snapjaw&#x27;, she is conveyed to fulfill the third by re-uniting the Maerum with the Alatians. After a series of tasks and in meeting with the Alatians&#x27; leader, April fulfills their prophecy by flying without wings, and convinces the Alatian to make peace with the Maerum.

In a coastal sea cave, the Teller&#x27;s guard and the Maerum Queen bring stones which combine to form the second part of the Balance&#x27;s disc; whereupon the Maerum convey April, at her own request, to the Blue Dragon, who gives April one of the disc&#x27;s Jewels and takes her to a ship inhabited by the Dark People, who give April the third piece of the disc, and an astral map locating the Guardian&#x27;s Realm.

At the Marcurian Harbor, April is attacked by the Chaos and returns to the Cathedral in Stark. There, Father Raul reveals that he is also a Sentinel Minstrum of Stark, and that Cortez is missing. On returning to her lodgings, April is caught by Gordon Halloway. She is rescued by another character, Lady Alvane, who teaches April to shift at will, and sends April to Abnaxus to receive the disc&#x27;s final piece. April then returns to the White Dragon, who reveals herself as April&#x27;s mother and dies, and a new White Dragon emerges from her egg.

Returned to Stark, April gives Flipper the star map to decipher, infiltrates MTI, and is captured by antagonist McAllen. Unable to escape, she surrenders her two jewels and the disc, and is then imprisoned. Upon escaping in pursuit of her object, she is trapped again; but rescued by Cortez. McAllen then reveals that he and Cortez are two Dragons (called &#x27;Draic Kin&#x27;, in-universe) meant to protect Stark, but at odds after McAllen&#x27;s decision to re-unite the two worlds despite the risk of Chaos. The two then appear to die in combat. Retrieving the disc and the four jewels, April returns to Flipper, whom she finds dying after the seizure of her deciphered map by Gordon Halloway, and gains a copy from him, which she uses to locate the Guardian&#x27;s Realm near the space station &#x27;Morning Star&#x27;.

At the station, April frees Adrian, the derelict Guardian, and escapes with Halloway in pursuit. On her way to the Guardians&#x27; Tower, she imprisons the Chaos Vortex in her Talisman and later summons Crow, who helps her complete the necessary trials. Inside the tower, April re-unites Halloway with the Chaos Vortex to restore his candidacy as Guardian and returns to Stark and Arcadia.

In the Epilogue, the scene returns to Lady Alvane&#x27;s home, where she has narrated the entire story to two youths, and where she reveals that the two worlds re-united under Gordon Halloway. Upon their departure, an aged and graying Crow enters, asking the tale of the &quot;warrior princess&quot; who won the war of the Balance, and she corrects his impression; a possible reference to the sequel, &quot;&quot;.

==Development==
The title of the game is a reference to the quote by the Swedish diplomat Dag Hammarskjöld: &quot;The longest journey is the journey inward, for he who has chosen his destiny has started upon his quest for the source of his being.&quot; Other inspirations for the game included &quot;Gabriel Knight: Sins of the Fathers&quot;, Neil Gaiman&#x27;s &quot;The Sandman&quot; and &quot;The Books of Magic&quot;, &quot;Hellblazer&quot;, &quot;Swamp Thing&quot;, &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;, and Joss Whedon&#x27;s writing in general.

&quot;The Longest Journey&quot; was developed by a small internal team at Funcom led by Ragnar Tørnquist. It was their first original project. Funcom put few restrictions on the developers except the budget (approx. $2–3 million) and the deadline. Since the team had to develop the game engine and most of the required tools from scratch, they struggled to release the game on time. For most of 1999, the team had to work overtime and during weekends to ultimately meet the deadline. In the original Norwegian release, April Ryan was voiced by the journalist Synnøve Svabø.

First published by IQ Media Nordic in Norway in 1999, it was later localized for and released in France, the United Kingdom, Germany, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, Canada, Spain, Denmark, Finland, Sweden, Poland, Czech Republic, Russia, and the United States. The game was originally written and recorded in English, though most of the localizations were released before the English version. In October 2011, it was announced that &quot;The Longest Journey&quot; was being ported to iOS, with the article mainly focusing on the iPhone.

==Reception==
The PC version received &quot;universal acclaim&quot; according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. It was praised for its female protagonist April Ryan, who is considered one of the most memorable female characters in the history of adventure games, and also for its enigmatic, complex storyline and high production values, but was criticized for some of its more obscure puzzles. &quot;GameSpot&quot; called it &quot;one of the best adventure games in years&quot; and applauded the &quot;complex and interesting story&quot;, but found the ending lacking as &quot;the epilogue does little to wrap everything up&quot;. &quot;IGN&quot; said the game &quot;actually reinvents how stories can be told in the medium&quot; and noticed the mature content, including &quot;harsh subject matter, and some big time swearing&quot;. Some of the puzzles were described as &quot;inane&quot;, but on the whole the game &quot;hones the genre into its tightest, sharpest form yet&quot;. The US edition of &quot;PC Gamer&quot; praised the &quot;mature and magical&quot; story, the &quot;sumptuous&quot; graphics, and the game&#x27;s puzzles. The only criticism levied by the magazine was that some parts of the game might be &quot;too edgy&quot; for younger players. &quot;AllGame&quot; gave it a score of four stars out of five, saying that it was &quot;definitely not the kind of game everyone will appreciate and, in fact, may be unplayable after five minutes for some gamers. However, for anyone willing to give it half a chance, the game can provide the same kind of enthralling entertainment as the most meticulously crafted mystery novel or film, perhaps even rekindling a lost sense of wonder in the way reality really works.&quot; Eric Bratcher of &quot;NextGen&quot;, however, called it &quot;a potential epic that seems to have taken tranquilizers. It&#x27;s still worthwhile, but it&#x27;s also a little slow [and] a little dull, and [it] sometimes just doesn&#x27;t make sense.&quot;

===Sales===
Before its release, &quot;The Longest Journey&quot; received positive preview coverage and was heavily promoted in Norway. &quot;Dagbladet&quot; described the title as &quot;the first big Norwegian computer game.&quot; Its target demographics were outside the industry&#x27;s norm: Ragnar Tørnquist reported that Funcom wanted to capture &quot;a more adult audience in addition to the usual teenage buyers&quot;. The game&#x27;s high budget meant that 150,000 sales were necessary to break even. However, Norway&#x27;s market for games was small. According to Herman Berg of &quot;Digi.no&quot;, it was rare for a game&#x27;s Norwegian sales to reach 10,000 units. The game&#x27;s domestic sales goal was 15,000 units, while its global lifetime goal was 300,000 units. Funcom shipped 15,000 units of the game to Norwegian retailers in the game&#x27;s first month and a half on shelves, and publisher IQ Media noted that sell-through and store re-orders were high through late December. Sell-in had reached 10,000 units in Sweden by that time. Based on the available data, IQ&#x27;s Nickolay Nickelsen noted that it &quot;looks as if half of the players are actually girls.&quot;

According to Tørnquist, the game experienced &quot;solid sales across Europe&quot; before its release in the U.S. The game sold 15,000 units in Norway by May 2000, while overall European sales totaled 100,000 units by September 2000. It launched in Germany with a shipment of 40,000 units to retailers; Chris Kellner of DTP Entertainment, which handled the game&#x27;s German localization, reported its lifetime sales between 10,000 and 50,000 units in that market. In Spain, the game sold 50,000 units after roughly one year, a commercial hit for the country. Its English release was purposely delayed to prevent imports from cannibalizing local sales across Europe.

The game struggled to find a North American publisher. According to market research firm PC Data, North American sales of the game reached 12,495 retail units by the end of 2000, of which 10,873 were sold in December. By January 2001, global sales totaled almost 200,000 units. PC Data reported an additional 40,160 retail sales of the game in North America during the first six months of 2001. By that June, the game&#x27;s worldwide sales had climbed to 250,000 units, of which the U.S. accounted for 90,000. PC Data&#x27;s estimate for the title&#x27;s North American sales for January–December 2001 was 71,962 retail units, followed by another 12,044 in the first six months of 2002. By July 2002, global sales of the game had reached 450,000 units, according to Funcom. A new shipment was released in North America that month, as its earlier printing had sold out. Ragnar Tørnquist noted in 2003 that he was &quot;very satisfied&quot; with the game&#x27;s sales in North America, and explained, &quot;There was such strong word of mouth, and so many great reviews, that we managed to get &quot;TLJ&quot; into most big stores and out to the players regardless of marketing.&quot;

In May 2003, Marek Bronstring of &quot;Adventure Gamers&quot; wrote that the game &quot;sold half a million copies worldwide and it&#x27;s still selling, making it one of the most successful adventure games in recent years.&quot; The following year, &quot;IGN&quot; reported that its sales had surpassed 500,000 units. The site&#x27;s Richard Aihoshi summarized the game as &quot;a critical and commercial success&quot;. In 2019, Tørnquist recalled that &quot;at least 50 per cent&quot; of the game&#x27;s players were female, a fact that he believed increased its commercial success.

===Awards===
The game was named the best computer adventure game of 2000 by &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; in its 2001 Premier Awards, &quot;The Electric Playground&quot;″s Blister 2000 Awards, &quot;GameSpot&quot;″s Best and Worst of 2000 Awards, &quot;IGN&quot;″s Best of 2000 Awards in Editor&#x27;s Choice (which was also a runner-up in Reader&#x27;s Choice) and the Seventh Annual &quot;PC Gamer&quot; Awards, and was nominated in the category by &quot;CNET Gamecenter&quot;″s Computer Game Awards for 2000 and &quot;Computer Games Magazine&quot; (the latter whose winner remains unknown). It also won &quot;IGN&quot;″s &quot;Best Game No One Played&quot; and &quot;GameSpot&quot;″s &quot;Best Story&quot; awards, and was a runner-up for the former website&#x27;s &quot;Best Storyline&quot; award in Editor&#x27;s Choice, and for the latter website&#x27;s &quot;Best Graphics, Artistic&quot; award, which went to &quot;Sacrifice&quot;. The game was also nominated for &quot;The Electric Playground&quot;″s &quot;Best Game of the Year&quot; award, which went to &quot;Deus Ex&quot;. &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot;″s staff praised the game for offering &quot;a mature, literate, and compelling story featuring a strong female heroine who, for once, is not exploited for her looks.&quot;

The game was a finalist for the &quot;Sound Design&quot; award at the AIAS&#x27; 4th Annual Interactive Achievement Awards, which ultimately went to &quot;Medal of Honor: Underground&quot;.

In 2011, &quot;Adventure Gamers&quot; named it the second-best adventure game ever released.

==Sequels==
A sequel to &quot;The Longest Journey&quot; began production in early 2003. The game, &quot;&quot;, was released in April 2006. The developers viewed the sequel as more of a spin-off than a direct sequel to the first game, as it revolves around a new protagonist, with a new storyline.

The next installment of the series, &quot;Dreamfall Chapters&quot;, was crowd-funded on Kickstarter and was released episodically. Its first episode was released in October 2014. The last episode shipped in June 2016.

Plans for a direct sequel to &quot;The Longest Journey&quot;, entitled &quot;The Longest Journey Home&quot;, were revealed in 2013. In 2016, Ragnar Tørnquist stated that even though he wants to produce the game, there are many reasons why it may never happen.

<text>Sail Training International (STI) is a non-profit international sail training organisation, with members in 29 countries. Its main aim is the &quot;development and education of young people of all nations, cultures, and social backgrounds through the experience of sail training.&quot;. It is based in Hampshire in the United Kingdom and is a registered charity.

The organization organizes various activities such as regattas, seminars or conferences on the subject of &quot;Sail Training&quot;. Sail Training International is best known for organizing the Tall Ships&#x27; Races, which are now followed and/or attended by hundreds of thousands of onlookers each year.

==The Tall Ships Races==
Sail Training International runs the annual Tall Ships&#x27; Races in Europe and the north Atlantic which attract a fleet of up to 130 sail training vessels and draws millions of visitors to European ports.

==Other activities==
Besides organising the Tall Ships&#x27; Races, STI is a provider of races and events, conferences and seminars, publications, research and services for the international sail training community. In 2014 they launched an International Sail Endorsement Scheme together with the Nautical Institute.

==History==
In 1956, the Sail Training International Race Committee (STIRC) was formed in the United Kingdom to organize a unique international tall ships&#x27; regatta. Due to the popularity of the regatta with the public and participating vessels, the first regatta evolved into the regular Tall Ships&#x27; Races (1973–2003 under the name Cutty Sark Tall Ships&#x27; Races), which continued to be organized by the STIRC. It was later succeeded by the British Sail Training Association or the International Sail Training Association (ISTA), a wholly owned subsidiary of the British Sail Training Association, whose role was to continue to organize the Tall Ships&#x27; Races.

Today&#x27;s Sail Training International was formed in 2002 by the 20 Sail Training Associations and organizations that exist around the world and promote the idea of Sail Training nationwide, to transfer ISTA&#x27;s duties to a new and independent organization – one owned and controlled by the STAs of the various states.[4] Sail Training International took over ISTA&#x27;s property, employees and contracts with regatta and event ports a few months after its formation.

Co-founding National Sail Training Organizations were those of Australia, Belgium, Bermuda, Canada, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Russia, Spain, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the United States of America. Since 2003 Sail Training International has been recognized as a non-profit organization.

<doc id="455810" wikidata="Q1849861" url="?curid=455810" title="Aled Jones">
<text>Aled Jones, (born 29 December 1970) is a Welsh singer, radio and television presenter, and actor. As a teenage chorister, he gained widespread fame in 1985 with his recording of &quot;Walking in the Air&quot;, which reached No 5 in the UK pop chart. He has since worked in television with the BBC and ITV, and on radio for the BBC and Classic FM.

In September 2012, Jones joined ITV Breakfast, where he presented &quot;Daybreak&quot; (2012–2014), alongside Lorraine Kelly and Kate Garraway. For the BBC, he has presented &quot;Songs of Praise&quot; (since 2004), &quot;Cash in the Attic&quot; (2010–2012), &quot;Escape to the Country&quot; (2009–2013), and &quot;Going Back Giving Back&quot; (since 2016).

==Career==
===1970-1990===
Jones was born in St. David&#x27;s Hospital in Bangor, Caernarfonshire, the only child of Nest Rowlands, a teacher, and Derek John Jones, a draughtsman for a shipbuilder. He was raised in the small Welsh-speaking community of Llandegfan on Anglesey, and attended Ysgol David Hughes (a secondary school). Jones joined the choir of Bangor Cathedral at age nine and was lead soloist within two years, although he was never Head Chorister. The remarkable quality of Jones&#x27; treble voice was appreciated by a member of the congregation, Hefina Orwig Evans, who wrote a letter to record company Sain, and he was duly signed. In 1982, Jones won the Cerdd Dant solo competitions for competitors under 12 at the Urdd Eisteddfod.

Jones became famous for the cover version of &quot;Walking in the Air&quot;, the song from Channel 4&#x27;s animated film &quot;The Snowman&quot;, based on the book by Raymond Briggs. The record reached number five in the UK charts in 1985. Although it is often reported that Jones sang the version used in the 1982 film, that was actually performed by Peter Auty, a St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral choirboy.

In June 1985, Jones was the subject of an Emmy Award–winning BBC Omnibus documentary entitled &quot;The Treble&quot;. Jones, with the National Philharmonic Orchestra, was behind the &quot;Santa Claus: The Movie&quot;, original motion picture soundtrack, &quot;Every Christmas Eve&quot; of 1985. Also in 1985, Jones was employed by Mike Oldfield to sing on his single &quot;Pictures in the Dark&quot;, a three-voice song, on which he performed with Anita Hegerland and Barry Palmer, but the song did not reach the UK Top 40. In 1986, he sang the theme song for the Siriol Animation film &quot;A Winter Story&quot;. The song was a modest success, reaching number 51 in the UK Singles Chart.

In 1986, he sang the oratorio &quot;Athalia&quot;.

Jones&#x27; recording career was temporarily halted in the late 1980s. By then he had sung for Pope John Paul II, Queen Elizabeth II, and Charles, Prince of Wales and Diana, Princess of Wales in a private recital, as well as presenting numerous children&#x27;s television programmes. He sang at the wedding of celebrities Bob Geldof and Paula Yates in 1986. Jones also had the distinction of being the first artist to have two classical albums listed simultaneously in the popular music charts, and worked with Leonard Bernstein (&quot;Chichester Psalms&quot;).

Jones&#x27; first biography, &quot;Walking on Air&quot;, was published in 1986.

===1990s-present===

In September 1990, Jones made his acting debut at the Royal Theatre (Northampton) in Shaun McKenna&#x27;s adaptation of Richard Llewellyn&#x27;s &quot;How Green Was My Valley&quot; playing the teenage Huw Morgan.

Jones went on to study at the Royal Academy of Music for three years and the Bristol Old Vic Theatre School, before beginning his adult recording career, which has featured a largely religious/inspirational repertoire. In 1995 he took the leading role in the long-running production of Andrew Lloyd Webber&#x27;s &quot;Joseph and the Amazing Technicolour Dreamcoat&quot; at the Blackpool Wintergardens Opera house stage. From September 1996 to May 1997 Jones played the young Tom Gradgrind (a non-singing role) in a large-scale national touring production of Charles Dickens&#x27;s &quot;Hard Times&quot;. Theatres at which the play was presented included Theatre Royal, Brighton, Bath Theatre Royal and Richmond Theatre.

In 2005, Jones launched his autobiography, &quot;Aled: The Autobiography&quot;, written in collaboration with Darren Henley. In 2013, Jones released his extended autobiography, &quot;Aled Jones: My Story&quot;.

Following the launch of his first baritone album, &quot;Aled&quot; on the Universal Music label in Australia in May 2003, Jones visited the country on a promotional tour. He has since successfully toured in concert there five times: in Dec 2003, Aug 2006, Oct 2008, Aug/Sep 2010 and Feb 2015, performing in eight cities.

Jones released two singles with Terry Wogan in aid of the &quot;Children in Need&quot; appeal.

From 3 July to 30 August 2008, Jones played the lead role of Caractacus Potts in &quot;Chitty Chitty Bang Bang&quot; at the Wales Millennium Centre, Cardiff. He returned to the stage, playing Bob Wallace in &quot;White Christmas&quot; at the Theatre Royal, Plymouth, and at The Lowry, Salford Quays, from November 2009 until 9 January 2010, and again from 11 to 26 November 2011 at the Mayflower Theatre, Southampton, from 1 to 17 December at the Grand Canal Theatre, Dublin, and at the Empire Theatre, Liverpool (22 December 2011 to 7 January 2012) On 8 November 2014 Jones made his West End debut, again playing Bob Wallace in &quot;White Christmas&quot;, this time at the Dominion Theatre, Tottenham Court Road.

Following the publication of &quot;Aled&#x27;s Forty Favourite Hymns&quot; in 2009, a further book, &quot;Favourite Christmas Carols&quot;, was published on 28 October 2010; Jones took the book on his UK tour in November and December 2010. On 29 November, his CD, &quot;Aled&#x27;s Christmas Gift&quot;, was issued to accompany the book.

On 11 October 2010, Jones was confirmed to take over as stand-in presenter of the early morning breakfast slot on BBC Radio 2 following the departure of Sarah Kennedy, a role he occasionally covered in the years leading up to her departure. Jones covered this slot for six weeks until the beginning of his UK tour.

Jones is mentoring Isabel Suckling, the youngest classical recording artist signed by Decca Records and first choirgirl to sign a record contract with a major music label. Suckling&#x27;s debut album was strongly endorsed by Jones, who described it as &quot;breathtaking&quot; and it was released on 29 November 2010.

In 2011, Jones hosted the television and DVD series, &quot;Classical Destinations III, Aled Jones&#x27; Ultimate Travel Guide to Classical Music&quot; which was filmed on his travels in the UK, Europe, Scandinavia and Australia.

On 9 November 2018, Jones released &quot;In Harmony&quot;, a collaboration album with English tenor Russell Watson. They followed on 1 November 2019 with &quot;Back in Harmony&quot;, which debuted at number 1 on the UK Classical Albums chart.

On 4 November 2022, Jones and Watson released the album &quot;Christmas with Aled and Russell&quot;. The album debuted at number 1 on the Classical Artists Albums Chart and number 14 on the main albums chart. The album was preceded by two singles; the first, &quot;A Spaceman Came Travelling&quot;, was released on 21 October 2022. The second single, &quot;O Holy Night&quot;, was released on 4 November 2022. The duo toured the UK in November and December 2022.

==Broadcasting==
===Radio===
Jones is a presenter on Classic FM. In 2006 he joined the BBC, taking over from Don Maclean on &quot;Good Morning Sunday&quot; on BBC Radio 2. He was also a presenter of &quot;Friday Night is Music Night&quot;, and has also been a regular stand-in presenter for Sarah Kennedy and Ken Bruce on Radio 2, until he left Radio 2 in 2012. Jones also presents programmes for BBC Radio 3, such as &quot;Choir of the Year&quot; and &quot;Young Chorister of the Year&quot; and &quot;The Choir&quot; until he left Radio 3 in 2013. On 4 February 2013 it was announced that Jones had returned to Classic FM to present a new show from 9:00–12:00 on Sundays, starting on 3 March of the same year. From March 2016, his breakfast show was moved down to two hours, to 7:00–10:00 (but staying on Sundays). His show reaches over a million listeners, which is a record number for weekend breakfast listenership, alongside the Saturday show at the same slot with Alan Titchmarsh.

===Television===
As a teenager Jones presented &quot;Chatterbox&quot;, a children&#x27;s chat show made by HTV for ITV, in 1988.

Jones&#x27; appearance as a contestant on &quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot; in 2004 brought him to the attention of a wider audience, leading to further tours and albums. It also led to increasing demands on him as a broadcaster.

Jones is one of the main presenters of BBC One&#x27;s &quot;Songs of Praise&quot;. In 2003, he was the subject of the final episode of &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; when he was surprised by Michael Aspel while presenting &quot;Songs of Praise&quot; at the Royal Albert Hall in London. He has also presented the annual &quot;Big Sing&quot;, the 50th Anniversary edition from Alexandra Palace in 2011, and the 60th Anniversary edition from Westminster Abbey (3/10/21). Since 2009, Jones has presented editions of &quot;Escape to the Country&quot; for the BBC. He was also a presenter on &quot;Cash in the Attic&quot; between 2010 and 2012. In October 2011, he appeared as a guest presenter on &quot;The One Show&quot;. In 2012, Jones hosted the Australian TV series &quot;Classical Destinations III, Aled Jones&#x27; Ultimate Travel Guide to Classical Music&quot;.

On 4 May 2012, Jones was confirmed as the new presenter of the ITV Breakfast programme &quot;Daybreak&quot; with Lorraine Kelly and Kate Garraway, replacing Adrian Chiles. On 3 March 2014, it was announced that &quot;Daybreak&quot; was to be replaced by a new breakfast programme called &quot;Good Morning Britain&quot;, which Jones would not be a part of. His last episode aired on 25 April 2014. The following day, Jones began hosting &quot;Weekend&quot;, broadcast every Saturday and Sunday morning from 8:30am.

Since 2012, Jones has presented the annual &quot;Christmas Carols on ITV&quot; programme, which airs late on Christmas Eve. In 2015, he was a regular reporter for &quot;Strictly Come Dancing: It Takes Two&quot;, broadcast on BBC Two.

Since February 2016, Jones has co-presented the daily magazine show &quot;Too Much TV&quot;, for BBC Two.

Since 2016, Jones has presented &quot;Going Back Giving Back&quot;, a daytime programme for BBC One.

Jones has been on the judging panel for the Pride of Britain awards twice.

In 2022, Jones appeared on the third series of &quot;The Masked Singer&quot; as &quot;Traffic Cone&quot;.

===BBC suspension===
In November 2017, Jones was being investigated by the BBC following allegations of inappropriate behaviour. In the interim, he had agreed to withdraw from programmes. It was subsequently confirmed in January 2018 that the BBC had lifted the suspension and that he would resume presenting programmes.

==Awards and honours==
On 28 October 2009, Jones was presented with a BASCA Gold Badge Award in recognition of his unique contribution to music.

Jones was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 2013 Birthday Honours for services to music and broadcasting and for charitable services. He collected his award on 17 October 2013.

On 14 February 2014, Jones was nominated as an Honorary Fellow of the Royal Academy of Music; he was presented with the fellowship on 3 July 2014.

<text>The white-winged triller (Lalage tricolor) is one of the smaller members of the cuckooshrike family, Campephagidae. It is found throughout mainland Australia and possibly on the islands to the north, including New Guinea and eastern Indonesia. It is resident or nomadic over the warmer part of its range (inland Australia and points north), and a summer breeding migrant to the cooler southern parts of Australia.

White-winged trillers are fairly common in woodland, and open scrub through most of their range, and close to riverbeds in the central arid zone. The conspicuous male bird—black above and white below in breeding plumage—trills cheerfully through much of the day during the breeding season (mid-spring to early summer), frequently rising on fluttering wings in song flight.

The female is similarly patterned but in dull fawns and white. In the non-breeding season, male birds appear similar to the female, retaining blackish feathers only on the wings and tail.

Typically 16 to 18 cm long, white-winged trillers eat a variety of insects, which are taken on the ground, from foliage, or in the air.

The correct classification of the white-winged triller and its close northern relative, the white-shouldered triller (&quot;Lalage sueurii&quot;) of eastern Indonesia is uncertain. Some authorities regard them as two races of a single species, in which case the white-winged triller becomes &quot;Lalage sueurii tricolor&quot;.

<doc id="455818" wikidata="Q320146" url="?curid=455818" title="Léo Ferré">
<text>Léo Ferré (; 24 August 1916 – 14 July 1993) was a Monégasque poet and composer, and a dynamic and controversial live performer. He released some forty albums over this period, composing the music and the majority of the lyrics. He released many hit singles, particularly between 1960 and the mid-1970s. Some of his songs have become classics of the French chanson repertoire, including &quot;Avec le temps&quot;, &quot;C&#x27;est extra&quot;, &quot;Jolie Môme&quot; and &quot;Paris-Canaille&quot;.

== Early life ==

Ferré was the son of Joseph Ferré, French staff manager at Monte Carlo Casino, and Marie Scotto, a Monégasque dressmaker of Italian descent from Piedmont; he had a sister, Lucienne, two years older.

Ferré had an early interest in music. At age seven, he joined the choir of the Monaco Cathedral and discovered polyphony through singing pieces by Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina and Tomás Luis de Victoria. His uncle, former violinist and secretary at the Casino, used to bring him to performances and rehearsals at the Monte Carlo Opera. Ferré listened to such musicians as bass singer Feodor Chaliapin, discovered Beethoven under the baton of Arturo Toscanini (Coriolanus), and was deeply moved by the Fifth Symphony. But it was the sweet presence of composer Maurice Ravel during &quot;L&#x27;Enfant et les Sortilèges&quot; rehearsals that impressed him the most.

At age nine, Ferré entered Saint-Charles College of Bordighera, run by the Brothers of the Christian Schools in Italy. He remained there for eight long years of severe discipline and boredom. He wrote about this lonely and caged childhood in an autofiction (&quot;Benoît Misère&quot;, 1970). He graduated from high school in Monaco, but his father did not let him attend the Conservatory of Music.

== Career ==

In 1945, while still a &quot;farmer&quot; and a Jack-of-all-trades at Radio Monte-Carlo, Ferré met Edith Piaf, who encouraged him to try his luck in Paris.

In April 1947, Ferré agreed to tour in Martinique, which turned out to be disastrous. From the end of 1947 Ferré produced and hosted on Paris Inter station several cycles of programs devoted to classical music. In &quot;Musique Byzantine&quot; (1953–54), he expanded his topics on aesthetics, such as tonality necessity, exotic melody, opera (the &quot;song of rich people&quot;), boredom, and originality or &quot;marshmallow music&quot;.

In 1950, to submit Verdi examination at La Scala in Milan, he wrote the libretto and music of an opera called &quot;La Vie d&#x27;artiste&quot; (same title as the song). It transposed his past years&#x27; experience into a kind of a black comedy but Ferré did not seem to like it much, finally abandoning it for other projects. He began to sing in larger venues such as l&#x27;Olympia, as the opening act of Josephine Baker in 1954. In 1956, Ferré wrote and composed &quot;La Nuit&quot; (&quot;The Night&quot;), a ballet with sung sections commissioned by choreographer Roland Petit, but which failed to find an audience.

From 1960 to 1970, Ferré worked with arranger Jean-Michel Defaye, whose classical skills and taste fit well with Ferré&#x27;s musical sensitivity (they were both fans of Maurice Ravel&#x27;s works for example). They maintained a steady pace of creation, recording almost an album a year, sometimes more. This artistic output, including the way Ferré would write for symphonic orchestras after 1970, would have an influence in the English-speaking world over such singer-songwriters as Scott Walker, Martin Newell and Benjamin Clementine.

In March 1968, Ferré did not return home after a gig. In his absence, Ferré&#x27;s chimpanzee Pépée suffered a fall and refused to be approached. Eventually, Madeleine asked a hunter neighbour to put the chimpanzee out of its misery. Ferré&#x27;s requiem for the primate would be his eponymous song &quot;Pépée&quot;. The singer blamed his wife for Pépée&#x27;s death and they would divorce after endless procedures.

In 1969, Ferré settled in Tuscany, in Italy. The huge success of &quot;C&#x27;est extra&quot;, an erotic ballad, greatly expanded his audience, especially among the French youth, who recognized in the poet the &quot;prophet&quot; of his own rebellion. Backed by this new energy, Ferré began to smash traditional song structures to explore spoken word and long monologues. With very precise work on the voice (rhythm, speech) and rhetorical writing derived from the prose of poet Arthur Rimbaud, Ferré ritualized his speaking in an incantatory and dramatic fashion.

In 1975 Ferré conducted successively the orchestra of the Institut des Hautes Études Musicales in Montreux, the Orchestre Philharmonique de Liège, and the Pasdeloup Orchestra at the Palais des congrès de Paris. It was a perilous challenge for Ferré, who conducted the orchestra and sang at the same time. He mixed Ravel&#x27;s &quot;piano concerto for the Left Hand&quot; and Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Coriolan Overture&quot; with his own compositions and reversed the placement of the orchestra. 140 musicians and choir singers were on stage. This was an unprecedented performance, breaking free from conventions and blending separated worlds. Concerts were sold out for five weeks, but critics from the classical music field rejected this hybrid show.

From 1976 to 1979 he toured less. He drifted from his violently declamatory expression of revolt to avoid being typecast.

In 1976, Ferré signed with CBS Records International. From then until the end of his career the majority of his recordings would be made with the Milan-based RAI National Symphony Orchestra under his conducting. CBS soon dropped Ferré, whose commercial potential was estimated too low (his new aesthetics of symphonic down-tempo being against the current of all musical trends, it was complicated to put the artist on the radio and reduced the possibility of a hit). Being dropped by the &quot;professionals&quot;, and disgusted for good with being &quot;a merchandise for producers&quot;, Ferré refused to accept French song prizes. He also refused the proposal to enter the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres (at the highest grade) and to support President of France François Mitterrand in his reelection campaign in exchange for leading and conducting of a first-class symphonic orchestra. He refused being guest of honor in the Victoires de la musique (Music&#x27;s Victories), annual French award ceremony recognizing the best musical artists of the year. Ferré used to say: &quot;The only honor for an artist is not getting any&quot;.

Léo Ferré died at his home in July 1993 at the age of 76. He was buried at the Monaco Cemetery.

<text>The Catuvellauni (Common Brittonic: *&quot;Catu-wellaunī&quot;, &quot;war-chiefs&quot;) were a Celtic tribe or state of southeastern Britain before the Roman conquest, attested by inscriptions into the 4th century.

The fortunes of the Catuvellauni and their kings before the conquest can be traced through ancient coins and scattered references in classical histories. They are mentioned by Cassius Dio, who implies that they led the resistance against the conquest in AD 43. They appear as one of the &quot;civitates&quot; of Roman Britain in Ptolemy&#x27;s &quot;Geography&quot; in the 2nd century, occupying the town of Verlamion (modern St Albans) and the surrounding areas of Hertfordshire, Bedfordshire and southern Cambridgeshire.

Their territory was bordered to the north by the Iceni and Corieltauvi, to the east by the Trinovantes, to the west by the Dobunni and Atrebates, and to the south by the Regni and Cantiaci.

The name &#x27;Catuvellauni&#x27; (Common Brittonic: *&quot;Catu-wellaunī/Catu-uellaunī&quot;, &#x27;war-chiefs, chiefs-of-war&#x27;) stems from the Celtic root &quot;catu-&quot; (&#x27;combat&#x27;) attached to &quot;uellauni/wellauni&quot; (&#x27;chiefs, commandants&#x27;). It is probably related to the name of the &#x27;Catalauni&#x27;, a Belgic tribe dwelling in the modern Champagne region during the Roman period.

==Before the Roman conquest==
The Catuvellauni are part of the Aylesford-Swarling archaeological group in Southern England often linked to Belgic Gaul and possibly to an actual Belgic conquest of the region alluded to by Caesar. John T. Koch conjectures that the Battle of the Catalaunian Plains and the modern name of Châlons-en-Champagne preserves the name of an original continental tribe of Catuvellauni, a name he derives from a compound of the ancient Celtic roots *&quot;katu-&quot; (&quot;battle&quot;) and *&quot;wer-lo&quot; (&quot;better&quot;), thus meaning &quot;excelling in battle&quot;, the same source as that of the later British and Breton personal name Cadwallon.

Cassivellaunus, who led the resistance to Julius Caesar&#x27;s first expedition to Britain in 54 BC, is often taken to have belonged to the Catuvellauni. His tribal background is not mentioned by Caesar, but his territory, north of the Thames and to the west of the Trinovantes, corresponds to that later occupied by the Catuvellauni. The extensive earthworks at Devil&#x27;s Dyke near Wheathampstead, Hertfordshire are thought to have been the tribe&#x27;s original capital.
Tasciovanus was the first king to mint coins at Verlamion, beginning ca 20 BC. He appears to have expanded his power at the expense of the Trinovantes to the east, as some of his coins, ca 15–10 BC, were minted in their capital Camulodunum (modern Colchester). This advance was given up, possibly under pressure from Rome, and a later series of coins were again minted at Verulamium.

However, Camulodunum was retaken, either by Tasciovanus or by his son Cunobelinus, who succeeded him ca AD 9 and ruled for about 30 years. Little is known of Cunobelinus&#x27;s life, but his name survived into British legend, culminating in William Shakespeare&#x27;s play &quot;Cymbeline&quot;. Geoffrey of Monmouth says he was brought up at the court of Augustus and willingly paid tribute to Rome. Archaeology indicates increased trading and diplomatic links with the Roman Empire. Under Cunobelinus and his family, the Catuvellauni appear to have become the dominant power in south-eastern Britain. His brother Epaticcus gained territory to the south and west at the expense of the Atrebates until his death ca AD 35. The grave of the &quot;Druid of Colchester&quot; dates to this period, providing evidence of medical practices and technology within the Catuvellauni tribe.

Three sons of Cunobelinus are known to history. Adminius, whose power-base appears from his coins to have been in Kent, was exiled by his father shortly before AD 40 according to Suetonius, prompting the emperor Caligula to mount his abortive invasion of Britain. Two other sons, Togodumnus and Caratacus, are named by Dio Cassius. No coins of Togodumnus are known, but Caratacus&#x27; rare coins suggest that he followed his uncle Epaticcus in completing the conquest of the lands of the Atrebates. It was the exile of the Atrebatic king, Verica, that prompted Claudius to launch a successful invasion, led by Aulus Plautius, in AD 43.

Dio tells us that, by this stage, Cunobelinus was dead, and Togodumnus and Caratacus led the initial resistance to the invasion in Kent. They were defeated by Plautius in two crucial battles on the rivers Medway (see Battle of the Medway) and Thames. He also tells us that the Bodunni, a tribe or kingdom who were tributary to the Catuvellauni, switched sides. This may be a misspelling of the Dobunni, who lived in Gloucestershire, and may give an indication of how far Catuvellaunian power extended. Togodumnus died shortly after the battle on the Thames. Plautius halted and sent word for the emperor to join him, and Claudius led the final advance to Camulodunum. The territories of the Catuvellauni became the nucleus of the new Roman province.

==Under Roman rule==
Caratacus, however, had survived, and continued to lead the resistance to the invaders. We next hear of him in Tacitus&#x27;s &quot;Annals&quot;, leading the Silures and Ordovices in what is now Wales against the Roman governor Publius Ostorius Scapula. Ostorius defeated him in a set-piece battle somewhere in Ordovician territory in AD 51, capturing members of his family, but Caratacus again escaped. He fled north to the Brigantes, but their queen, Cartimandua, was loyal to the Romans and handed him over in chains.

Caratacus was exhibited as a war-prize as part of a triumphal parade in Rome. He was allowed to make a speech to the Senate, and made such an impression that he and his family were freed and allowed to live in peace in Rome.

Verulamium, the Roman settlement near Verlamion, gained the status of &quot;municipium&quot; ca 50, allowing its leading magistrates to become Roman citizens. It was destroyed in the rebellion of Boudica in 60 or 61, but was soon rebuilt. Its forum and basilica were completed in 79 or 81, and were dedicated in an inscription by the governor, Gnaeus Julius Agricola, to the emperor Titus. Its theatre, the first Roman theatre in Britain, was built ca 140.

An inscription records that the &quot;civitas&quot; of the Catuvellauni were involved in the reconstruction of Hadrian&#x27;s Wall, probably in the time of Septimius Severus in the early 3rd century. Saint Alban, the first British Christian martyr, was a citizen of Verulamium in the late 3rd or early 4th century, and was killed there. The city took its modern name from him. The tombstone of a woman of the Catuvellauni called Regina, freedwoman and wife of Barates, a soldier from Palmyra in Syria, was found in the 4th-century Roman fort of Arbeia in South Shields in the northeast of England.

<doc id="455823" wikidata="Q39658" url="?curid=455823" title="Carl Peter Thunberg">
<text>Carl Peter Thunberg, also known as Karl Peter von Thunberg, Carl Pehr Thunberg, or Carl Per Thunberg (11 November 1743 – 8 August 1828), was a Swedish naturalist and an &quot;apostle&quot; of Carl Linnaeus. After studying under Linnaeus at Uppsala University, he spent seven years travelling in southern Italy and Asia, collecting and describing people and animals new to European science, and observing local cultures. He has been called &quot;the father of South African botany&quot;, &quot;pioneer of Occidental Medicine in Japan&quot;, and the &quot;Japanese Linnaeus&quot;.

== Early life ==
Thunberg was born and grew up in Jönköping, Sweden. At the age of 18, he entered Uppsala University where he was taught by Carl Linnaeus, regarded as the &quot;father of modern taxonomy&quot;. Thunberg graduated in 1767 after 6 years of studying. To deepen his knowledge in botany, medicine and natural history, he was encouraged by Linnaeus in 1770 to travel to Paris and Amsterdam. In Amsterdam and Leiden Thunberg met the Dutch botanist and physician Johannes Burman and his son Nicolaas Burman, who himself had been a disciple of Linnaeus.

Having heard of Thunberg&#x27;s inquisitive mind, his skills in botany and medicine and Linnaeus&#x27; high esteem of his Swedish pupil, Johannes Burman and Laurens Theodorus Gronovius, a councillor of Leiden, convinced Thunberg to travel to either the West or the East Indies to collect plant and animal specimens for the botanic garden at Leiden, which was lacking exotic exhibits. Thunberg was eager to travel to the Cape of Good Hope and apply his knowledge.

With the help of Burman and Gronovius, Thunberg entered the Dutch East India Company (in Dutch, &quot;Vereenigde Oostindische Compagnie&quot;, or V.O.C.) as a surgeon on board the &quot;Schoonzicht&quot;. As the East Indies were under Dutch control, the only way to enter the colonies was via the V.O.C. Hence, Thunberg embarked in December 1771. In March 1772, he reached Cape Town in now South Africa.

== South Africa ==
During his three-year stay, Thunberg perfected his Dutch and studied the culture of the Khoikhoi, (known to the Dutch as &quot;Hottentotten&quot;), the native people of western South Africa. The Khoikhoi were the first non-European culture he encountered. Their customs and traditions elicited both his disgust and admiration. For example, he considered their custom to grease their skin with fat and dust as an obnoxious habit about which he wrote in his travelogue: &quot;For uncleanliness, the Hottentots have the greatest love. They grease their entire body with greasy substances and above this, they put cow dung, fat or something similar.&quot; Yet, this harsh judgement is moderated by the reason he saw for this practice and so he continues that: &quot;This stops up their pores and their skin is covered with a thick layer which protects it from heat in Summer and from cold during Winter.&quot; This attitude – to try to justify rituals he did not understand – also marked his encounters with Japanese people.

Since the main purpose for his journey was to collect specimens for the gardens in Leiden, Thunberg regularly took field trips into the interior of South Africa. Between September 1772 and January 1773, he accompanied the Dutch superintendent of the V.O.C. garden, Johan Andreas Auge. Their journey took them to the north of Saldanha Bay, east along the Breede Valley through the Langkloof as far as the Gamtoos River and returning by way of the Little Karoo. During this expedition and later, Thunberg kept in regular contact with scholars in Europe, especially the Netherlands and Sweden, but also with other members of the V.O.C. who sent him animal skins. Shortly after returning, Thunberg met Francis Masson, a Scots gardener who had come to Cape Town to collect plants for the Royal Gardens at Kew. They were drawn together by their shared interests. During one of their trips, they were joined by Robert Jacob Gordon, on leave from his regiment in the Netherlands. Together, the scientists undertook two further inland expeditions.

During his three expeditions into the interior, Thunberg collected many specimens of both flora and fauna. At the initiative of Linnaeus, he graduated at Uppsala as Doctor of Medicine in absentia while he was at the Cape in 1772. Thunberg left the Cape for Batavia on 2 March 1775. He arrived in Batavia on 18 May 1775, and left for Japan on 20 June.

== Japan ==

In August 1775, he arrived at the Dutch factory of the V.O.C. at Dejima, a small artificial island (120 m by 75 m) in the Bay of Nagasaki connected to the city by a single small bridge. However, like the Dutch merchants, Thunberg was at first rarely allowed to leave the island. These restrictions had been imposed by the Japanese &quot;shogun&quot; Tokugawa Ieyasu in 1639 after the Portuguese, who had been the first Europeans to arrive in Japan in 1543, persisted in missionary activity. The only locals who were allowed regular contact with the Dutch were the interpreters of Nagasaki and the relevant authorities of the city.

Shortly after the &quot;Schoonzicht&#x27;s&quot; arrival on Deshima, Thunberg was appointed head surgeon of the trading post. To still be able to collect specimens of Japanese plants and animals as well as to gather information on the population, Thunberg began to construct networks with the interpreters by sending them small notes containing medical knowledge and receiving botanical knowledge or rare Japanese coins in return. Quickly, the news spread that a well-educated Dutch physician was in town who seemed to be able to help the local doctors cure syphilis, known in Japan as the &quot;Dutch disease&quot;. As a result, the appropriate authorities granted him more visits to the city and finally even allowed him one-day trips into the vicinity of Nagasaki, where Thunberg had the chance to collect specimens by himself.

During his visits in town, Thunberg began to recruit students, mainly the Nagasaki interpreters and local physicians. He taught them new medical treatments, such as using mercury to treat syphilis, and the production of new medicines. During this process, he also instructed his pupils in the Dutch language and European manners, furthering the growing interest into Dutch and European culture by the Japanese, known as &quot;rangaku&quot;. Thunberg had brought some seeds of European vegetables with him and showed the Japanese some botanical practices, expanding Japanese horticultural practices.

Thunberg also profited from his teachings himself. As a former medical student he was mainly interested in medical knowledge, and the Japanese showed him the practice of acupuncture. The exchange of ideas between Thunberg and the local physicians led to the development of a new acupuncture point called &quot;shakutaku&quot;. The discovery of &quot;shakutaku&quot; was a result of Thunberg&#x27;s anatomic knowledge and the Japanese traditional medicine of neuronic moxibustion. Thunberg brought back knowledge on Japan&#x27;s religion and societal structure, boosting interest into Japan, an early cultural form of Japonism.

In both countries, Thunberg&#x27;s knowledge exchange led to a cultural opening-up, which also manifested itself in the spread of universities and boarding schools which taught knowledge of the other culture. For this reason, Thunberg has been called &quot;the most important eye witness of Tokugawa Japan in the eighteenth century&quot;.

Due to his scientific reputation, Thunberg was given the opportunity in 1776 to accompany the Dutch ambassador M. Feith to the shogun&#x27;s court in Edo, today&#x27;s Tokyo. During that journey, he collected many specimens of plants and animals and talked to locals along the way. It is during this time that Thunberg started writing two of his scientific works, the &quot;Flora Japonica&quot; (1784) and the &quot;Fauna Japonica&quot; (1833). The latter was completed by the German traveller Philipp Franz von Siebold, who visited Japan between 1823 and 1829 and based the &quot;Fauna Japonica&quot; on Thunberg&#x27;s notes which he carried with him all the time in Japan.

On his way to Edo, Thunberg also obtained many Japanese coins, which he described in detail in the fourth volume of his travelogue, &quot;Travels in Europe, Africa and Asia, performed between the Years 1770 and 1779&quot;. The coins provided new insights for European scholars into the culture, religion and history of Japan, as their possession and export by foreigners had been strictly forbidden by the shogun. This prohibition had been imposed to prevent the Empire of China and other rivals of the shogunate from copying the money and flooding the Japanese markets with forged coins.

In November 1776, after Thunberg had returned from the shogun&#x27;s court, he left for Java, now part of Indonesia. From there, he travelled to Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) in July 1777. Here again, his major interest lay in collecting plants and other specimens.

In February 1778, Thunberg left Ceylon to return to Europe.

==Return to Europe==
In 1778, Thunberg left Ceylon for Amsterdam, with a two week stay at the Cape. He finally arrived at Amsterdam in October 1778. He made a short trip to London where he met Joseph Banks. He saw there the Japanese collection from the 1680s of the German naturalist Engelbert Kaempfer (1651–1716), who had preceded him at Dejima. He also met Forster, who showed him his collections from Cook&#x27;s second voyage.

On arrival in Sweden in March 1779, he learned of the death of Linnaeus one year earlier. Thunberg was first appointed botanical demonstrator in 1777, and in 1781 professor of medicine and natural philosophy at the University of Uppsala. His publications and specimens resulted in the description of many new taxa.

He published his &quot;Flora Japonica&quot; in 1784, and in 1788 he began to publish his travels. He completed his &quot;Prodromus Plantarum&quot; in 1800, his &quot;Icones Plantarum Japonicarum&quot; in 1805, and his &quot;Flora Capensis&quot; in 1813. He published numerous memoirs in the transactions of various Swedish and international scientific societies. He was an honorary member of sixty-six scientific societies. In 1776, while still in Asia, he had been elected a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. He was elected a member of the American Philosophical Society in 1791. In 1809 he became correspondent, and in 1823 an associate member of the Royal Institute of the Netherlands.

He died at Thunaberg near Uppsala on 8 August 1828.

== Reasons for his travels ==
It was common for Enlightenment scholars to travel throughout Europe and to more distant regions, and to write subsequent travelogues. However, Thunberg was notable in his travel destination and the popularity of his account of his travels, which was translated into German, English and French. Three main reasons for this have been proposed:

# Besides being encouraged by Linnaeus and Gronovius to travel to Japan, the fact that, for half a century, no new information on the country had reached Europe attracted Thunberg to travel there. In 1690, Engelbert Kaempfer, a German traveller, had sailed to Japan and spent two years on the island of Deshima. Kaempfer&#x27;s 1729 travelogue became a famous work on the shogunate; yet, when Thunberg came to Japan, Kaempfer&#x27;s writings were already more than fifty years old. The time was right for new knowledge. 
# The Age of Enlightenment furthered a scientific hunger for new information. In the light of the increasing emphasis on using the rational human mind, many students were keen to leave the boundaries of Europe and apply their knowledge and gather new insights about less well-known regions. 
# Thunberg was a very inquisitive and intelligent man, a &quot;person of acute mind&quot; who sought new challenges. Hence, the journey was in Thunberg&#x27;s personal interest and complied well with his character.

==Namesake plants==

A genus of tropical plants, &quot;Thunbergia&quot;, family Acanthaceae, which are cultivated as evergreen climbers, is named after him.

Thunberg is cited in naming some 254 species of both plants and animals (though significantly more plants than animals). Notable examples of plants referencing Thunberg in their specific epithets include:

*&quot;Allium thunbergii&quot;
*&quot;Amaranthus thunbergii&quot;
*&quot;Arisaema thunbergii&quot;
*&quot;Berberis thunbergii&quot;
*&quot;Fritillaria thunbergii&quot;
*&quot;Geranium thunbergii&quot;
*&quot;Lespedeza thunbergii&quot;      
*&quot;Pinus thunbergii&quot;
*&quot;Spiraea thunbergii&quot;

<doc id="455828" wikidata="Q698685" url="?curid=455828" title="Heinkel He 280">
<text>Originally called the He 180, the Heinkel He 280 was an early turbojet-powered fighter aircraft designed and produced by the German aircraft manufacturer Heinkel. It was the first jet fighter to fly in the world.

The He 280 harnessed the progress made by Hans von Ohain&#x27;s novel gas turbine propulsion and by Ernst Heinkel&#x27;s work on the He 178, the first jet-powered aircraft in the world. Heinkel placed great emphasis on research into high-speed flight and on the value of the jet engine; after the He 178 had met with indifference from the &quot;Reichsluftfahrtministerium (RLM)&quot; (the German Reich Aviation Ministry), the company opted to start work on producing a jet fighter during late 1939. Incorporating a pair of turbojets, for greater thrust, these were installed in a mid-wing position. It also had a then-uncommon tricycle undercarriage while the design of the fuselage was largely conventional.

During the summer of 1940, the first prototype airframe was completed; however, it was unable to proceed with powered test flights due to development difficulties with the intended engine, the HeS 8. Thus, it was initially flown as a glider until suitable engines could be made available six months later. The lack of state support delayed engine development, thus setting back work on the He 280; nevertheless, it is believed that the fighter could have been made operational earlier than the competing Messerschmitt Me 262, and offered some advantages over it. On 22 December 1942, a mock dogfight performed before RLM officials saw the He 280 demonstrate its vastly superior speed over the piston-powered Focke-Wulf Fw 190; shortly thereafter, the RLM finally opted to place an order for 20 pre-production test aircraft to precede a batch of 300 production standard aircraft.

However, engine development continued to hinder the He 280 program. During 1942, the RLM had ordered Heinkel to abandon work on both the HeS 8 and HeS 30 to focus on the HeS 011. As the HeS 011 was not expected to be available for some time, Heinkel selected the rival BMW 003 powerplant; however, this engine was also delayed. Accordingly, the second He 280 prototype was re-engined with Junkers Jumo 004s. On 27 March 1943, Erhard Milch, Inspector-General of the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;, ordered Heinkel to abandon work on the He 280 in favour of other efforts. The reason for this cancellation has been attributed to combination of both technical and political factors; the similar role of the Me 262 was certainly influential in the decision. Accordingly, only the nine test aircraft were ever built, at no point did the He 280 ever attain operational status or see active combat.

==Development==
===Background===
During the late 1930s, the Heinkel company had developed the He 178, the world&#x27;s first turbojet-powered aircraft; successfully flying the aircraft for the first time on 27 August 1939. However, an aerial demonstration of the He 178 had apparently failed to interest attending officials from the &quot;Reichsluftfahrtministerium (RLM)&quot; (the German Reich Aviation Ministry) either in the aircraft itself or jet propulsion in general. Unknown to Heinkel, the Reich Air Ministry had already begun work on discretely developing its own jet technology independently of his company&#x27;s efforts.

Despite having been unable to secure state backing for further work, Heinkel was undeterred in the potential value of the turbojet. Instead, the company independently decided to undertake work on what would become the He 280 during late 1939. This internal project to develop a jet-powered fighter aircraft, which had been started under the designation &quot;He 180&quot;, was headed by the German aeronautical designer Robert Lusser. The project was greatly aided by the earlier He 178 programme, which had not only served as a proof of concept but also yielded invaluable data gathered from flight testing; however, the design of the He 178 was deemed to be unsuitable for further development; particularly as mounting the engine within the fuselage had been judged to be impractical.

For the He 280, a pair of turbojets were used, each one installed in a mid-wing position, which was viewed as a more straightforward arrangement. Despite its novel propulsion, the design had adopted numerous relatively orthodox features, such as a typical Heinkel fighter fuselage, semi-elliptical wings, and a dihedralled tailplane with twin fins and rudders. The He 280 was furnished with a tricycle undercarriage that had very little ground clearance; this arrangement was considered by some officials to be too frail for the grass or dirt airfields of the era; however, the tricycle layout eventually gained acceptance. One particularly groundbreaking feature incorporated onto the He 280 was its ejection seat, which was powered by compressed air; it was not only the first aircraft to be equipped with one but would also be the first aircraft to successfully employ one in a genuine emergency. In contrast to the Messerschmitt Me 262, another German jet fighter, the He 280 had a smaller footprint and is believed to have been more maintainable.

===Test flying===
During the summer of 1940, the first prototype airframe was completed, however, the HeS 8 turbojets that were intended to power it had encountered considerable production difficulties. On 22 September 1940, while work on the engine continued, the first prototype commenced glide tests, having been fitted with ballasted pods in place of its engines, towed behind a He 111. It was another six months before Fritz Schäfer flew the second prototype under its own power, on 30 March 1941. After landing, Schäfer reported to Heinkel that, while somewhat difficult to exercise control during turns, an experienced pilot would have an easy time flying the He 280.
On 5 April 1941, Paul Bader performed an exhibition flight before various Nazi officials, including Ernst Udet, General-Ingenieur Lucht, Reidenbach, Eisenlohr and others. However, the RLM eventually favored development of the Me 262, a rival jet-powered fighter. Yet, Heinkel was given Hirth Motoren for continued turbine development. One benefit of the He 280 which did impress Germany&#x27;s political leadership was the fact that the jet engines could burn kerosene, a fuel that required much less expense and refining than the high-octane fuel used by piston-engine aircraft. However, government funding was lacking at the critical stage of initial development; the aviation author Robert Dorr largely attributes this lack of support to the personal opposition voiced by Udet.

Over the next year, progress was slow due to the ongoing engine problems. A second engine design, the HeS 30 was also under development, both as an interesting engine in its own right and as a potential replacement for the HeS 8. In the meantime, alternative powerplants were considered, including the Argus As 014 pulsejet that powered the V-1 flying bomb. It was proposed that up to eight would be used.

By the end of 1942, however, the third prototype was fitted with refined versions of the HeS 8 engine and was ready for its next demonstration. On 22 December, a mock dogfight was staged for RLM officials in which the He 280 was matched against a piston-powered Focke-Wulf Fw 190 fighter, in which the jet demonstrated its vastly superior speed, completing four laps of an oval course before the Fw 190 could complete three. Finally, at this point the RLM became interested and placed an order for 20 pre-production test aircraft that were to be followed by a batch of 300 production standard aircraft.

===Engine troubles and cancellation===
Engine problems continued to plague the project. During 1942, the RLM had ordered Heinkel to abandon work on both the HeS 8 and HeS 30 to focus all development on a follow-on engine, the HeS 011, which proved to be a more advanced and problematic design. Meanwhile, the first He 280 prototype was re-equipped with pulsejets, and towed aloft to test them. Bad weather caused the aircraft to ice up before the jets could be tested; the situation led to pilot Helmut Schenk becoming the first person to put an ejection seat to use. While the seat worked perfectly, the aircraft was lost and never recovered.

As the HeS 011 was not expected to be available for some time, Heinkel selected the rival BMW 003 powerplant; however, this engine also suffered problems and delays. Accordingly, the second He 280 prototype was re-engined with Junkers Jumo 004s. The following three airframes were earmarked for the BMW motor which would never become available in actuality. The Jumo engines were considerably larger and heavier than the HeS 8 that the aircraft had been designed for, and while it flew well enough on its first powered flights from 16 March 1943, it was clear that this engine was unsuitable. The aircraft was slower and generally less efficient than the Me 262.

Less than two weeks later, on 27 March, Erhard Milch, Inspector-General of the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;, ordered Heinkel to abandon work on the He 280 to instead focus his company&#x27;s attention on bomber development and construction. The termination of the project has been attributed to multiple factors. A major contributor was competition from the Jumo 004-powered Me 262, which appeared to possess most of the qualities of the He 280, but had the advantage of being better matched to its engine. Yet it was believed that the He 280 could have been in service sooner and may have been useful even just as a stopgap measure for the Me 262. The aviation authors Tim Heath and Robert Dorr both note that, in light of Heinkel having become unpopular amongst influential Nazis while Willy Messerschmitt was a favoured figure, there were political factors at play in the cancellation of the He 280. Heinkel remained interested in jet propulsion and sought out other opportunities to design aircraft harnessing such engines; this would lead to the single-engined Heinkel He 162 that would be selected as the winner of the Emergency Fighter Program in October 1944.

<doc id="455832" wikidata="Q1769847" url="?curid=455832" title="Robert Mylne (architect)">
<text>Robert Mylne (4 January 1733 – 5 May 1811) was a Scottish architect and civil engineer, particularly remembered for his design for Blackfriars Bridge in London. Born and raised in Edinburgh, he travelled to Europe as a young man, studying architecture in Rome under Piranesi. In 1758, he became the first Briton to win the triennial architecture competition at the Accademia di San Luca. This made his name known in London, and won him the rivalry of fellow Scot Robert Adam.

On his return to Britain, Mylne won the competition to design the new Blackfriars Bridge over the Thames in London, his design being chosen over those of established engineers, such as John Smeaton. He was appointed surveyor to the New River Company, which supplied drinking water to London, and Surveyor of the Fabric of St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, where he was responsible for maintaining the building designed by Sir Christopher Wren. Both positions he held for life. Mylne designed a number of country houses and city buildings, as well as bridges. As his career progressed, he concentrated more on engineering, writing reports on harbours and advising on canals, and appearing as an expert witness in lawsuits and trials.

Mylne was one of the founder members, with John Smeaton, of the Society of Civil Engineers, the first engineering society in the world, established in 1771. He was also a founder of the Architects&#x27; Club, another early professional body, and regularly socialised with the eminent doctors, philosophers and scientists of his day. Known for his quick temper and for his integrity, Mylne had a strong sense of duty, and could be stubborn when he knew he was right. This inflexibility made him unpopular with some, in an age when corruption was more widespread than today. He died aged 78 and was buried in St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral: there is a memorial to him in the crypt.

==Early life==
Mylne was descended from a family of architects and builders, and was the great-grandson of mason and architect Robert Mylne (1633–1710), remembered particularly for his work as the King&#x27;s Master Builder at Holyrood Palace in Edinburgh. The younger Robert was born in Edinburgh, the son of Thomas Mylne, Edinburgh City Surveyor, and Deacon of the Incorporation of St Mary&#x27;s Chapel, the main guild of masons in Edinburgh. He was educated at the Royal High School from the ages of nine to fourteen, after which he was apprenticed to Daniel Wright, a wright, or carpenter, for six years. During this time he probably also learned stonemasonry from his father. He undertook work for the Duke of Atholl at Blair Castle in Perthshire, and was expected to take over the family business from his father.

==Grand tour==
In autumn 1754, Mylne set off for mainland Europe on the &quot;Grand Tour&quot;, to join his brother William, who had been studying in Paris for a year. They travelled through France together, mostly on foot and by boat, visiting Avignon and Marseille, from where they sailed to Civitavecchia. Again travelling on foot, they arrived in Rome in January 1755, and took lodgings on the Via dei Condotti. They made contact with Andrew Lumisden, secretary to James Stuart, the &quot;Old Pretender&quot;, and Abbé Peter Grant, the Scots agent in Rome. They also encountered Robert Adam, a fellow Scot also studying architecture. Adam was disdainful of the Mylnes&#x27; poor situation, but viewed Robert Mylne as a potential rival, noting that he &quot;begins to draw extremely well&quot;. The Mylnes were continually short of funds, and had a joint allowance from their father of just £45 a year, compared to Adam&#x27;s annual expenditure of around £800.

Mylne learned architectural and figure drawing, and studied the art of architectural ornament, under the direction of Giovanni Battista Piranesi. Piranesi, who had also taught Robert Adam, was a great influence on the young Mylne, and the two continued to correspond after the latter left Rome. Mylne studied the Ancient Roman system of aqueducts, and began to take on paid work as a tutor himself. A letter from the Duke of Atholl enquired when he would return to resume work at Blair, and offered Mylne the post of head carver, but he preferred to continue with his studies. In the spring of 1757, shortly after William had returned home, Mylne accompanied the diplomat Richard Phelps and antiquarian Matthew Nulty on a tour of Sicily. He produced sketches and measured drawings of the antiquities for a projected book, although this was never published.

In 1758, Mylne decided to enter the triennial architecture competition, known as the &quot;Concorso Clementino&quot;, at the Accademia di San Luca (St Luke&#x27;s Academy), the subject being a design for a public gallery. He prepared two sets of drawings over seven months, apparently rejecting the first, and submitting the latter. This, the winning design, was heavily influenced by French neoclassical architecture, which helped it to stand out against the field of mostly baroque entries. On 6 September, all the entrants had to complete a &quot;prova&quot;, a drawing exercise under examination conditions, and on 18 September 1758, Mylne was awarded a silver medal, as the first Briton ever to win the competition. He was presented the award at a ceremony attended by twenty cardinals, as well as James Stuart, the Old Pretender, who was referred to in Rome as &quot;King James III of England&quot;. The event was publicised by his family in Edinburgh and London, and he acquired the patronage of the Prince Altieri, who arranged for his election to the Academy.

Mylne left Rome in April 1759, travelling to Florence, where he was elected to the Academy of Art, then Venice, Brescia, and villas designed by Andrea Palladio. He then travelled through Germany to Rotterdam, arriving in London on 17 July 1759.

==Blackfriars Bridge==
Mylne intended to establish himself as an architect in London, and to begin preparing his notes and sketches of Sicily for publication. However, on his arrival, he heard of the proposal to build a third bridge over the River Thames at Blackfriars. The closing date for the design competition was set for 4 October, giving Mylne less than three months to complete his scheme, although in his favour, he apparently found a friend in John Paterson, secretary of the Bridge Committee, and a fellow Scot. 69 schemes were entered into the competition, which was soon reduced to a shortlist of 14, including designs by the established engineers John Smeaton and John Gwynn, and the architects Sir William Chambers and George Dance the Elder. Mylne&#x27;s design stood out, however, as it was the only one to propose flatter, elliptical arches, rather than round ones. This departure, as yet untried in Britain, provoked a public debate, and brought Mylne under attack from Dr Samuel Johnson, a friend of John Gwynn, who suggested that elliptical arches would be too weak. In response Mylne published a pamphlet, under the name &quot;Publicus&quot;, in which the pseudonymous author praises Mylne&#x27;s design, while criticising those of his competitors.

On 22 February 1760, Mylne was finally declared the winner of the competition, and he was appointed surveyor to the new Blackfriars Bridge, with overall responsibility for design, construction and future maintenance of the structure, on a salary of £400 a year. The foundation stone was laid on 31 October, and on 1 October 1764 the first arch, the wide centre arch, was completed. Mylne corresponded with Piranesi regarding the project, and the latter made an engraving, based on Mylne&#x27;s reports, of the bridge under construction. Mylne introduced several technical innovations, including the use of removable wedges in the centring which supported the arches during construction, making it easier to dismantle. The foundations of the piers were on timber piles, levelled with an underwater saw, and the stonework was then built inside a huge caisson, a floating, submersible workspace, by , and high.
The bridge was opened to all traffic in November 1769. As surveyor, Mylne was also responsible for laying out the approach roads; Bridge Street (now New Bridge Street) from the north, and Surrey Street (now Blackfriars Road) from the south. The squares of Chatham Square and Albion Place were laid out at the north and south ends of the bridge, respectively, and Mylne also designed the obelisk, which still stands, at St George&#x27;s Circus, in 1771. Although Mylne was briefly the target of satirical anti-Scots cartoons and pamphlets at the time of winning the competition, the completed bridge was universally well-received, and tolls repaid the £152,840 cost of building within a few years. Mylne received his final payment for the works, of £4,209, in 1776, and held the post of surveyor until his death, but the bridge had to be replaced in 1869, after the rebuilding of London Bridge in 1831 affected the flow of the river.

==Architecture==
Despite these early successes, Mylne never won the acclaim of his contemporaries Robert Adam (1728–1792) and William Chambers (1723–1796). Although he became a successful architect, he played only a minor role in the development of neoclassical architecture, which was led by Adam and Chambers. Mylne followed the French style of neoclassicism, rather than the &quot;Adam style&quot;, and his work was also influenced by the post-Palladian buildings of English architect Isaac Ware (1704–1766). Mylne&#x27;s influence on British architecture was limited, although the Irish architect Thomas Cooley (1740–1784) was Mylne&#x27;s clerk at Blackfriars, and later produced designs which show the influence of Mylne&#x27;s competition-winning Rome design.

Mylne designed a number of town houses and country houses, and a few public buildings. The first new country house was Cally, in Galloway, south-west Scotland, for James Murray of Broughton. Mylne had met Murray in Rome, and drew a set of plans while still there, although the house was built to a modified design. His largest country house was Tusmore, Oxfordshire, built in a Palladian style between 1766 and 1769 for William Fermor. Of his small town houses, the most successful is The Wick, in Richmond. Designed in 1775 for Lady St Aubyn, the house has oval dining and drawing rooms. From 1794 to 1797 Mylne built a house for himself, The Grove, at Great Amwell.
St Cecilia&#x27;s Hall in Edinburgh was one of Mylne&#x27;s first public buildings, built 1761–1763 for the Musical Society of Edinburgh. The oval, domed hall survives as part of Edinburgh University. Mylne&#x27;s design for the City of London Lying-in Hospital, built 1770–1773, comprised a high central cupola flanked by pedimented blocks. Another public building, Stationers&#x27; Hall in London, was among his last architectural works, being refronted by him in 1800.

One or Mylne&#x27;s earliest works for a private client was for Edward Southwell (1705–1755) whom he is reputed to have met in Rome when Southwell was on the Grand Tour and Mylne was there studying under Piranesi. Mylne&#x27;s first work at Kings Weston House was in 1763 and involved designing and extensive new stables and kitchen garden complex which still remain. In the years following Mylne worked on extensively modernising Kings Weston House and replacing Sir John Vanbrugh&#x27;s austere interiors. Here he created a suite of neo-classical rooms surrounding the remodelled Sallon which he filled with family portraits in refined carved architectural surrounds. His final work for Southwell was for a lodge house in 1768, the drawing for which he gave to his client.

In 1766, Mylne was appointed Surveyor to St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, completed by Sir Christopher Wren some 55 years earlier. Nominated by the Lord Mayor of London, his salary was £50 a year. In this capacity, Mylne was responsible for erecting a monument to Wren, whose only memorial at the time was in the basement. The existing Latin epitaph, &quot;Lector, si monumentum requiris, circumspice&quot; (reader, if you seek his monument, look around you), was re-used on a tablet mounted on the organ screen in 1810, although this was destroyed in the Blitz. He purchased over 200 of Wren&#x27;s drawings, with his own money, and had them bound and presented to the cathedral, thus recording the building&#x27;s history for posterity. On the death of Lord Nelson at Trafalgar in 1805, Mylne was partly responsible for the state funeral, building Nelson&#x27;s sarcophagus in the Cathedral basement, although the design of the monument fell to James Wyatt of the Office of Works. Mylne, together with the manufacturer Matthew Boulton, arranged for a secret deposit of commemorative medals, of Boulton&#x27;s making, to be placed inside the sarcophagus prior to Nelson&#x27;s interment.
In November 1775 he was also appointed clerk of works at Greenwich Hospital, another Wren building, under the surveyor James Stuart. At Greenwich he cleared unsightly workshops from the grounds, and laid out a series of walkways. He was later accused by the Lieutenant Governor, Captain Baillie, of misusing funds and occupying space required by the hospital&#x27;s pensioners. Mylne responded by accusing Baillie of corruption, and the ensuing enquiry vindicated Mylne and led to the dismissal of Baillie in 1778. A fire the following January destroyed the chapel, but Mylne and his superior, James Stuart, failed to work together to design and build a replacement. Mylne made frequent requests to Stuart for drawings, but Stuart, who was gaining a reputation for drunkenness and unreliability, accused Mylne again of corruption and insulting behaviour. A second investigation again found no evidence, but it was clear that Mylne and Stuart could not work together. Stuart was the established figure, so it was Mylne, as the junior partner, who was dismissed. Disgusted at the outcome, he had to be forced from his offices, and successfully sued for damages.

He served as surveyor to Canterbury Cathedral.

==Engineering==
From 1767 until his death, Mylne worked for the New River Company, whose head offices were adjacent to Blackfriars Bridge. He was initially hired as an assistant to the company surveyor Henry Mill, but took over on Mill&#x27;s death in 1769. The company&#x27;s offices burned down at Christmas of that year, offering Mylne the opportunity to design a replacement. Later, Mylne designed and erected a monument to Sir Hugh Myddelton, designer of the New River, at Great Amwell.

He was also involved in the development of the Eau Brink Cut, a new channel for the River Great Ouse in East Anglia. The project resulted in much litigation with his associate Sir Thomas Hyde Page.

==Family==
Robert had been intended as his father&#x27;s successor, but his established position in London meant that his younger brother William took on the family business on Thomas Mylne&#x27;s death in February 1763. William was commissioned to build Edinburgh&#x27;s new North Bridge later in the decade, but the structure partially collapsed in 1769, killing five people. Robert was one of his brother&#x27;s financial guarantors, and was involved in the subsequent problems for several years, until William, his architectural career over, fled to America in 1773. He returned two years later, at which time Robert obtained him a job running the Dublin Waterworks. On William&#x27;s death in 1790, Robert had a plaque erected to his memory in St Catherine&#x27;s Church, Dublin.

In September 1770, Robert married Mary Home, the daughter of an army surgeon, leading to a rift between Mylne and his sister, who disliked the Home family. The couple resided at the Water House, New River Head, and had nine children:

*Maria (1772–1794)
*Emilia (born 1773)
*Harriet (born 1774)
*Caroline (born 1775), married Colonel Duncan of the East India Company, 1797
*Robert (1779–1798)
*William Chadwell (1781–1863)
*Thomas (1782, died aged six months)
*Charlotte (born 1785)
*Leonora (born 1788)

Mary Mylne died of a lung complaint in July 1797, shortly after the family had moved to Great Amwell. Robert designed a mausoleum for his wife and family, which still stands in the churchyard of St John the Baptist. Burials in the vault included his descendant, the antiquarian Rev Robert Scott Mylne FRSE (1854–1920).

Robert junior was initially intended for an architectural career, and was apprenticed to Henry Holland. However, this was unsuccessful, and Robert joined the army as an Ensign in 1797. Sailing for Gibraltar, his ship was captured, and he spent the following year in a French prison. Setting out again for Gibraltar after his return, he died on board ship in December 1798. It was therefore William&#x27;s role to take over from his father, which he did, being appointed surveyor to the New River on his father&#x27;s retirement in 1810.

<doc id="455834" wikidata="Q349448" url="?curid=455834" title="Alex North">
<text>Alex North (born Isadore Soifer, December 4, 1910 – September 8, 1991) was an American composer best known for his many film scores, including &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot; (one of the first jazz-based film scores), &quot;Viva Zapata!&quot;, &quot;Spartacus&quot;, &quot;Cleopatra&quot;, and &quot;Who&#x27;s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?&quot; He received fifteen Academy Award nominations for his work as a composer; while he did not win for any of his nominations, he received an Honorary Academy Award in 1986, the first for a composer.

He wrote the music for the Oscar-nominated song &quot;Unchained Melody&quot;, which was used in the 1955 prison film &quot;Unchained&quot;. The song became a standard and one of the most recorded of the 20th century, with over 1,500 recordings made by more than 670 artists, in multiple languages.

==Early life==
North was born Isadore Soifer in Chester, Pennsylvania, to Jewish parents Jesse and Beila (Bessie). They had emigrated from the Russian Empire to the U.S. around 1906. Jesse was originally from Bila Tserkva and Bessie from Odessa (both cities are now in Ukraine). In Chester, Jesse worked as a blacksmith and skilled mechanic, and Bessie ran a small grocery store. In 1915, Jesse died on the operating table during surgery for appendicitis, leaving Bessie with financial hardships. In the late 1920s, Isadore&#x27;s older brother Jacob began writing articles for radical labor publications. To shield his family from political peril, Jacob adopted the pseudonym &quot;Joseph North&quot;. Soon the family followed his lead, and Isadore Soifer became Alex North.

In the Second World War, Alex served as a captain in the U.S. Army Special Services division from 1942 to 1946. There, he was responsible for &quot;self-entertainment&quot; programs in mental hospitals. He also composed music for more than twenty-six documentary films for the Office of War Information. While in the service, he wrote the score for the documentary short, &quot;A Better Tomorrow&quot; (1945).

==Career==
North managed to integrate his modernism into typical film music leitmotif structure, rich with themes. One of these became the famous song &quot;Unchained Melody&quot;. Nominated for fifteen Oscars but unsuccessful each time, North is one of only two film composers to receive the Lifetime Achievement Academy Award, the other being Ennio Morricone. North&#x27;s frequent collaborator as orchestrator was the avant-garde composer Henry Brant. He won the 1968 Golden Globe award for his music to &quot;The Shoes of the Fisherman&quot; (1968).

His best-known film scores include &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot;, &quot;Death of a Salesman&quot;, &quot;Viva Zapata!&quot;, &quot;The Rainmaker&quot;, &quot;Spartacus&quot;, &quot;The Misfits&quot;, &quot;Cleopatra&quot;, &quot;Who&#x27;s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?&quot;, &quot;Dragonslayer&quot; and &quot;Under the Volcano&quot;. His music for &quot;The Wonderful Country&quot; makes use of Mexican and American motifs.

His commissioned score for &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot; (1968) is notorious for having been discarded by director Stanley Kubrick late in the production process. Although North subsequently incorporated motifs from the rejected score for &quot;The Shoes of the Fisherman&quot;, &quot;Shanks&quot; and &quot;Dragonslayer&quot;, the score itself remained unheard until composer Jerry Goldsmith re-recorded it for Varèse Sarabande in 1993. In 2007, Intrada Records released the 1968 recording sessions on CD from North&#x27;s personal archives.

North was also commissioned to write a jazz score for &quot;Nero Wolfe&quot;, a 1959 CBS-TV series based on Rex Stout&#x27;s Nero Wolfe characters, starring William Shatner as Archie Goodwin and Kurt Kasznar as Nero Wolfe. A pilot and two or three episodes were filmed, but the designated time slot was, in the end, given to another series. North&#x27;s unheard score for &quot;Nero Wolfe&quot; and six recorded tracks on digital audio tape are in the UCLA Music Library Special Collections. He wrote the music for various other TV shows, such as the anthologies &quot;Climax!&quot; and &quot;Playhouse 90&quot;.

Though North is best known for his work in Hollywood, he spent years in New York writing music for the stage; he composed the score for the original Broadway production of &quot;Death of a Salesman&quot;. It was in New York that he met Elia Kazan (director of &quot;Salesman&quot;), who brought him to Hollywood in the 1950s. North was one of several composers who merged the sound of contemporary concert music into film, in part marked by an increased use of dissonance and complex rhythms. But there is also a lyrical quality to much of his work which may be connected to the influence of Aaron Copland, with whom he studied in 1936–37.

His classical works include two symphonies and a &quot;Rhapsody for Piano, Trumpet obbligato and Orchestra&quot;. His music for the 1976 television miniseries &quot;Rich Man, Poor Man&quot; was a Grammy Award nominee and an Emmy Award winner. He went on to score the sequel &quot;Rich Man, Poor Man Book II&quot; as well as the 1978 miniseries &quot;The Word&quot;. North is also known for his opening to the CBS television anthology series &quot;Playhouse 90&quot; and the 1965 ABC television miniseries &quot;FDR&quot;.

== Legacy and recognition ==
North was recognized for his lifetime achievement in 2004 from the Sammy Film Music Awards.

In 2016, the Library of Congress added North&#x27;s 1951 recording of his score to &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot; to its National Recording Registry.

== Death ==
North died on September 8, 1991, in Los Angeles, California. He was cremated and his ashes were scattered at sea.

==Awards==
The American Film Institute ranked North&#x27;s score for &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot; #19 on their list of the greatest film scores. His scores for the following films were also nominated for the list:
*&quot;Cleopatra&quot; (1963)
*&quot;The Misfits&quot; (1961)
*&quot;Spartacus&quot; (1960)
*&quot;Viva Zapata!&quot; (1952)
*&quot;Who&#x27;s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?&quot; (1966)

North was nominated for fifteen Academy Awards throughout his career, one for Best Original Song, the rest in the Best Original Score category, making him the most-nominated composer to have never won. He was however awarded an Honorary Academy Award in 1986; he was the first composer to receive it.

<text>The Prelude or, Growth of a Poet&#x27;s Mind; An Autobiographical Poem is an autobiographical poem in blank verse by the English poet William Wordsworth. Intended as the introduction to the more philosophical poem &quot;The Recluse,&quot; which Wordsworth never finished, &quot;The Prelude&quot; is an extremely personal work and reveals many details of Wordsworth&#x27;s life. 

Wordsworth began &quot;The Prelude&quot; in 1798, at the age of 28, and continued to work on it throughout his life. He never gave it a title, but called it the &quot;Poem (title not yet fixed upon) to Coleridge&quot; in his letters to his sister Dorothy Wordsworth. The poem was unknown to the general public until the final version was published three months after Wordsworth&#x27;s death in 1850. Its present title was given to it by his widow Mary.

==Version ==
There are three versions of the poem:
* The 1799 &quot;Prelude&quot;, called the &quot;Two-Part Prelude&quot;, composed 1798–1799, containing the first two parts of the later poem.
* The 1805 &quot;Prelude&quot;, which was found and printed by Ernest de Sélincourt in 1926, in 13 books.
* The 1850 &quot;Prelude&quot;, published shortly after Wordsworth&#x27;s death, in 14 books.

&quot;The Prelude&quot; was the product of a lifetime: for the last part of his life Wordsworth had been &quot;polishing the style and qualifying some of its radical statements about the divine sufficiency of the human mind in its communion with nature&quot;.

==Structure: &quot;The Prelude&quot; and &quot;The Recluse&quot;==
The poem was intended as the prologue to a long three-part epic and philosophical poem, &quot;The Recluse&quot;. Though Wordsworth planned this project when he was in his late 20s, he went to his grave at 80 years old having written to some completion only &quot;The Prelude&quot; and the second part (&quot;The Excursion&quot;), and leaving no more than fragments of the rest.

Wordsworth initially planned to write this work together with Samuel Taylor Coleridge, their joint intent being to surpass John Milton&#x27;s &quot;Paradise Lost&quot;. If &quot;The Recluse&quot; had been completed, it would have been about three times as long as &quot;Paradise Lost&quot; (33,000 lines versus 10,500). Wordsworth often commented in his letters that he was plagued with agony because he had failed to finish the work. In his introduction to the 1850 version, Wordsworth explains that the original idea, inspired by his &quot;dear friend&quot; Coleridge, was &quot;to compose a philosophical Poem, containing views of Man, Nature, and Society, and to be entitled the &quot;Recluse&quot;; as having for its principal subject, the sensations and opinions of a poet living in retirement&quot;.

Coleridge&#x27;s inspiration and interest is evident in his letters. For instance, in 1799 he wrote to Wordsworth: &quot;I am anxiously eager to have you steadily employed on &#x27;The Recluse&#x27;... I wish you would write a poem, in blank verse, addressed to those who, in consequence of the complete failure of the French Revolution, have thrown up all hopes of amelioration of mankind, and are sinking into an almost Epicurean selfishness, disguising the same under the soft titles of domestic attachment and contempt for visionary philosophies. It would do great good, and might form a Part of &#x27;The Recluse&#x27;.&quot; (STC to WW, Sept. 1799).

Wordsworth pays tribute to Coleridge in his introduction to the edition of 1850: &quot;work [is] addressed to a dear friend, most distinguished for his knowledge and genius, and to whom the author&#x27;s intellect is deeply indebted.&quot;

==Literary criticism of &quot;The Prelude&quot;==
According to Monique R. Morgan&#x27;s &quot;Narrative Means to Lyric Ends in Wordsworth&#x27;s &quot;Prelude&quot;,&quot; &quot;Much of the poem consists of Wordsworth&#x27;s interactions with nature that &#x27;assure[d] him of his poetic mission.&#x27; The goal of the poem is to demonstrate his fitness to produce great poetry, and &quot;The Prelude&quot; itself becomes evidence of that fitness.&quot; It traces the growth of the poet&#x27;s mind by stressing the mutual consciousness and spiritual communion between the world of nature and man.

==Content==
The work is a poetic reflection on Wordsworth&#x27;s own sense of his poetic vocation as it developed over the course of his life. Its focus and mood present a sharp and fundamental fall away from the neoclassical and into the Romantic. Milton, who is mentioned by name in line 181 of Book One, rewrote God&#x27;s creation and The Fall of Man in &quot;Paradise Lost&quot; in order to &quot;justify the ways of God to men,&quot; Wordsworth chooses his own mind and imagination as a subject worthy of epic.

This spiritual autobiography evolves out of Wordsworth&#x27;s &quot;persistent metaphor [that life is] a circular journey whose end is &#x27;to arrive where we started / And know the place for the first time&#x27; (T. S. Eliot, &quot;Little Gidding&quot;, lines 241-42). &quot;The Prelude&quot; opens with a literal journey [during his manhood] whose chosen goal [...] is the Vale of Grasmere. &quot;The Prelude&quot; narrates a number of later journeys, most notably the crossing of the Alps in Book VI and, in the beginning of the final book, the climactic ascent of Snowdon. In the course of the poem, such literal journeys become the metaphorical vehicle for a spiritual journey—the quest within the poet&#x27;s memory [...]&quot;.

<text>James Benton Grant (January 2, 1848 – November 1, 1911) was an American mining magnate, mining engineer, Confederate Army soldier who served as the third Governor of Colorado from 1883 to 1885.

==Early life, American Civil War, and education==
Grant was born on January 2, 1848, on a plantation in Russell County, Alabama. Prior to the American Civil War, Grant&#x27;s family owned a plantation. At the outbreak of the American Civil War, Grant enlisted as a private in the 20th Alabama Light Artillery regiment in the Confederate Army.

While his immediate family was financially destroyed after the American Civil War, a wealthy uncle of Grant&#x27;s who lived in Davenport, Iowa, paid for Grant&#x27;s secondary education. After the war, Grant attended what is now Iowa State University for two years and then transferred to Cornell University, which he attended from 1873 to 1874. He then attended Germany&#x27;s Freiberg University of Mining, which was, at the time, one of the leading schools in the world for mineral engineering. There, he studied metallurgy. Grant then worked in the mines of Austria to gain practical mining experience before returning to the United States two years later.

==Colorado life==
===Early years===
Returning to the United States, he first settled briefly in the Colorado town of Central City. In either 1877 or 1878, Grant moved to the newly founded Colorado town of Leadville. He started his career as a metallurgic engineer and smelting magnate there. In Leadville, Grant constructed the tall Grant Smelter stack, which was at the time of its completion the third largest smelter in the world and the tallest in the United States. Grant was also involved in the construction of the long Yak Tunnel, which facilitated deep mining.

In Leadville, Grant married into the Goodell family, esteemed in Colorado, by marrying the young Mary Goodell, the daughter of Roswell Eaton Goodell and granddaughter of former Illinois governor Joel Aldrich Matteson. The two wed in Leadville&#x27;s newly built St. George&#x27;s Episcopal Church. The ceremony was presided over by James J. Mackay. The wedding was a major social event in the community, and was the newly opened church&#x27;s first-ever wedding ceremony. After the wedding ceremony, a small reception was held at her family&#x27;s home. The following day, a larger reception took place at Denver&#x27;s Windsor Hotel. The couple left for their honeymoon in San Francisco soon after.

After the Grant Smelter was lost in a fire in 1882, Grant and his wife relocated to Denver, where Grant relocated his business and built a new smelter under the name Omaha and Grant. It was believed to the largest smelter in the world at the time. Its tall smokestack, completed in 1892, stood for decades as one of the most recognizable landmarks in Denver&#x27;s skyline until its 1950 demolition. The site of this smelter was near where the Denver Coliseum sits today. Denver had economic and rail transportation advantages. The Grants’ move to Denver likely also was related to James&#x27; ambitions to run for governor of Colorado.

===Governorship===
Grant ran as the Democratic Party nominee in the 1882 Colorado gubernatorial election. Grant was never very interested in politics. However, he was urged by Democrats to run, and agreed to. At the time, Colorado was seen as a Republican Party stronghold due to the fact that most individuals that had moved there were northerners who had supported the Union Army&#x27;s cause in the American Civil War. This made Grant an underdog in the election. Grant benefited from a major divide that year in the state’s Republican Party, as well as his marriage into a prominent family and his ever-increasing notability as a successful smelting businessman. He won on the election, becoming the first Democrat to win a Colorado gubernatorial election in the state&#x27;s young history.

On January 9, 1883, Grant was inaugurated as governor. He was the state&#x27;s first Democratic Party governor. Grant, having been only a week past his 35th birthday at the time of his inauguration, remains the youngest governor to serve after Colorado&#x27;s statehood, and the second-youngest ever governor of Colorado, after only territorial governor Edward McCook. As governor, he worked to expand the state&#x27;s mining industry and its commerce. Many mines opened in the state&#x27;s southwestern portion during his governorship, especially in the &quot;Gunnison Country&quot; area that was formerly a part of the Ute Indian reservation. Mining growth and other factors led to a prosperous economy during his governorship. Grant also proposed the bill which authorized the construction of the Colorado State Capitol. Grant also succeeded in achieving his priority of extending the length of the legislative session of Colorado s state legislature.

During his governorship, Grant and his wife had their first child, son Lester Eames, on March 21, 1884.

Grant, still not very interested in politics, declined to seek reelection in the 1884 Colorado gubernatorial election.

===Post-governorship===
Grant and his wife remained major society figures after he left office as governor, and he remained a major industry figure. Grant became a major figure in finance and industry of the Western United States. Grant also served eight years as the president of the Denver Board of Education from 1892 to 1897. He also helped organize the creation of the Denver National Bank and served tenures as a member of the board of directors and as its vice-president. and was involved in the founding of the Colorado Women’s College. He was involved in organizing the Colorado Scientific Society.

On May 6, 1888, the Grants had their second and final child, son James Jr.

By 1900, Grant&#x27;s Denver smelter had produced $130 million of gold, silver, and lead. In 1899, Grant&#x27;s smelting business interests were merged with the newly founded American Smelting and Refining Company. Grant continued to earn profits from his investment in mining and ore-processing facilities across Colorado.

In 1902, the Grants completed construction on and moved into an elaborate house now known as the Grant-Humphreys Mansion. While his wife would entertain extensively at the residence, Grant himself receded from business and the social scene after his heart attack that year, instead spending much of the rest of his life concentrating on pleasurable outdoor activities such as the ranching on his ranch in Littleton, Colorado, as well as hunting and fishing.

Grant died of heart disease on November 1, 1911, in Excelsior Springs, Missouri. He is buried at Denver&#x27;s Fairmount Cemetery, and his wife was later buried beside him after her 1941 death.

<text>Fredrik Hasselquist (3 January 1722 – 9 February 1752) was a Swedish traveller and naturalist.

Hasselquist was born at Törnevalla, which is two kilometers east of Linghem, Östergötland. He studied under Carl Linnaeus at Uppsala University and became one of the &quot;Apostles of Linnaeus&quot;. On account of the frequently expressed regrets of Carl Linnaeus at the lack of information regarding the natural history of the Levant, Hasselquist resolved to undertake a journey to that country. With a sufficient subscription having been obtained to defray expenses, he reached Smyrna towards the end of 1749.

He visited parts of Asia Minor, Egypt, Cyprus and the Land of Palestine, making large natural history collections, but his constitution, naturally weak, gave way under the fatigues of travel, and he died near Smyrna on his way home.

His collections reached home in safety, and five years after his death his notes were published by Linnaeus under the title &quot;Iter Palæstinum, Eller Resa til Heliga Landet, Förrättad Ifrån år 1749 til 1752&quot;, which was translated into French and German in 1762 and into English in 1766 (as &quot;Voyages and Travels in the Levant, in the Years 1749, 50, 51, 52&quot;).

He was elected a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in 1750.

Hasselquist is commemorated in the scientific name of a species of lizard, &quot;Ptyodactylus hasselquistii&quot;.

<text>Ronald David Gilbert is an American video game designer, programmer, and producer. His games are generally focused on interactive story-telling, and he is arguably best known for his work on several LucasArts adventure games, including &quot;Maniac Mansion&quot; and the first two &quot;Monkey Island&quot; games. In 2009, he was chosen by IGN as one of the top 100 game creators of all time.

While a student in 1983, he co-wrote Graphics BASIC, and he then worked on action games for HESware, which went out of business. He afterwards joined Lucasfilm Games (later LucasArts), and was given the opportunity to develop his own games. He invented SCUMM, a technology used in many subsequent games. After leaving LucasArts, Gilbert co-founded the children&#x27;s gaming company Humongous Entertainment in 1992 and its sister company Cavedog Entertainment in 1995, where he produced games such as &quot;Total Annihilation&quot; for adults.

He cofounded Hulabee Entertainment with Shelley Day, releasing children&#x27;s games between 2001 and 2003. After working with Beep Games between 2004 and 2007, he was creative director at Vancouver-based Hothead Games development studio between 2008 and 2010, also doing some work for Telltale Games and with &quot;Penny Arcade&quot;. In 2013, he announced that he would move on from Double Fine Productions, after releasing the game &quot;The Cave&quot; with them. In 2017, he announced &quot;Thimbleweed Park&quot; with Terrible Toybox, serving as writer, designer, and programmer since 2014.

==Biography==

===Early career===
Ronald David Gilbert was raised in La Grande, Oregon. He is the son of David E. Gilbert, a physics professor and former president of Eastern Oregon University (then Eastern Oregon State College). Initially, he thought of himself going into a career for film direction. He became interested in games when he was thirteen years old thanks to a HP-65 programmable calculator his father used to bring home. He found the ability to program games on the calculator interesting, citing an example of a &quot;Battleship&quot;-like game that was included on the calculator, leading him wanting to learn how to program other games. Gilbert saw the potential to program games as a creative outlet as he continued his studies towards the film industry. Another thing that made him approach the gaming world was the film &quot;Star Wars&quot; (1977). His fascination with programming technology, which allowed gamers to interact with characters and situations, mixed with his love for telling stories, like that of &quot;Star Wars&quot;, were his main inspirations to start making games.

The impact of &quot;Star Wars&quot; and his love for telling stories was so big that Ron Gilbert, at the age of fourteen, and his good friend Tom McFarlane made a couple of films on a Super-8 camera. The first film they shot in 1978 was &quot;Stars Blasters&quot;; it was directed by Ron Gilbert and acted by McFarlane and friend Frank Lang. In 1979, they filmed another movie, &quot;Tomorrow Never Came&quot;, acted by Ron Gilbert, Tom McFarlane; it was also directed by Ron Gilbert.

In 1979, his parents purchased a NorthStar Horizon home computer. At the age of fifteen, he took his first steps in game programming. He used to study and analyze games for hours; capturing in his mind every frame of the layout of games like &quot;Donkey Kong&quot;, &quot;Pac-Man&quot;, &quot;Asteroids&quot;, &quot;Space Invaders&quot; or &quot;&quot;; taking notes of every detail and then trying to replicate them on his computer. Once the games were replicated he would start doing experiments with them, adding changes. He also used to look at Atari 2600 games&#x27; advertisements in magazines, then imagined what the game was like to play and tried to make them on his computer. Once the games were finished, he used to bring his friends home to test the games and tell him what they did or did not like.

===LucasArts===
Gilbert began his professional career in 1983 while he was still a student at Eastern Oregon State College by writing a program named Graphics BASIC with Tom McFarlane. They sold the program to a San Francisco Bay Area company named HESware, which later offered Gilbert a job. He spent about half a year at HESware, programming action games for the Commodore 64 (C64). None of them were ever released; the company went out of business. Shortly thereafter, Gilbert joined Lucasfilm Games, which later became LucasArts. There he earned his living by doing C64 ports of Lucasfilm Atari 800 games. In 1985, he got the opportunity to co-develop his own game for LucasArts together with graphics artist Gary Winnick. &quot;Maniac Mansion&quot; was about a dark Victorian mansion populated by a mad scientist, his family and strange aliens.

&quot;Maniac Mansion&quot; features cutscenes, a word coined by Gilbert, that interrupt gameplay to advance the story and inform the player about offscreen events. Gilbert created a scripting language that was named after the project it had been written for, the Script Creation Utility for &quot;Maniac Mansion&quot;, better known as S.C.U.M.M. The technology was used in all subsequent LucasArts adventure games, with the exception of &quot;Grim Fandango&quot; and &quot;Escape From Monkey Island&quot;. Despite being an internal production tool, the S.C.U.M.M. acronym became well known to gamers since a location in &quot;The Secret of Monkey Island&quot;, the SCUMM Bar, was named after it.

Gilbert created many successful adventure games at LucasArts, including the classic &quot;The Secret of Monkey Island&quot; and &quot;Monkey Island 2: LeChuck&#x27;s Revenge&quot;. In 1992, he left the company to start Humongous Entertainment with LucasArts producer Shelley Day. While at Humongous Entertainment, Gilbert was responsible for games such as &quot;Putt-Putt&quot;, &quot;Fatty Bear&quot;, &quot;Freddi Fish&quot;, &quot;Pajama Sam&quot;, and the &quot;Backyard Sports&quot; series. Many of these games continued to use an offshoot of the S.C.U.M.M. engine.

===Post-LucasArts===
In 1995, Gilbert founded Cavedog Entertainment, Humongous&#x27; sister company for non-kids games. In 1996, GameSpot named him as the 15th on their list of the most influential people in computer gaming of all time. In 1997, &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; similarly ranked him as number 15 on the list of the most influential people of all time in computer gaming for inventing the S.C.U.M.M. engine. While at Cavedog, Gilbert was the producer of &quot;Total Annihilation&quot; and worked on a game titled &quot;Good &amp; Evil&quot;. Widely regarded as his pet project, &quot;Good &amp; Evil&quot; was said to incorporate many different themes and gameplay styles. The game was previewed by several publications, but the project was cancelled when Cavedog closed down in 1999. In an interview with GameSpot conducted a while after Cavedog&#x27;s shut-down, Gilbert said the &quot;Good &amp; Evil&quot; project had suffered due to him trying to design a game and run a company at the same time.

As of 2005, Ron Gilbert was independently designing an unspecified new adventure/RPG, which he was pitching to publishers. He also started a blog &quot;Grumpy Gamer&quot;, offering game industry commentary, occasionally in the form of animated cartoons that he created with &quot;Voodoo Vince&quot; designer Clayton Kauzlaric.

In 2007, Gilbert created &quot;Threepwood&quot;, an exclusively &quot;Monkey Island&quot;-themed guild on the &quot;World of Warcraft&quot; server Quel&#x27;Dorei, and Gilbert began to collaborate with Hothead Games on &quot;Penny Arcade Adventures: On the Rain-Slick Precipice of Darkness&quot;, a game based on the webcomic &quot;Penny Arcade&quot;. He was chosen to be the Keynote Speaker for Penny Arcade Expo for 2009.

In January 2008, he joined Hothead Games as creative director, with whom he was developing &quot;DeathSpank&quot;, an adventure/R.P.G. Although still working at Hothead Games, Gilbert contributed to the design for Telltale Games&#x27; &quot;Tales of Monkey Island&quot;, taking part in the brainstorming process early in the development of the game. The episodic fifth entry in the &quot;Monkey Island&quot; series marked the first time Gilbert worked on a &quot;Monkey Island&quot; game since 1991&#x27;s &quot;LeChuck&#x27;s Revenge&quot;. On April 6, 2010, on his blog he announced that he left Hothead Games but that he would continue to promote &quot;DeathSpank&quot; with Electronic Arts.

In September 2010, it was revealed that Gilbert had been hired by fellow former LucasArts game designer Tim Schafer, to work at Schafer&#x27;s own Double Fine Productions. In February 2012, Tim Schafer confirmed he will be working with Ron Gilbert on a new adventure game. In May 2012, the game was revealed as &quot;The Cave&quot;, which was released as a downloadable title by Sega in 2013.

After the buying of LucasArts by The Walt Disney Company in 2012, the rights to the &quot;Monkey Island&quot; series became the company&#x27;s property. Ron Gilbert has been quoted in November 2012 as not being optimistic about the franchise&#x27;s future, believing that Disney might abandon the franchise in favor of &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean&quot;; however, in December 2012, he was also quoted as wishing to contact Disney, hoping to &quot;make the game he wants to make&quot;.

In March 2013, Gilbert left Double Fine Productions revealing that his joining the studio was purely for the creation of &quot;The Cave&quot;: &quot;I was telling him [Tim Schafer] about &quot;The Cave&quot; and he really liked it, so he said &#x27;come to Double Fine and make it&#x27;. It was really all about making that game.&quot; Most recently he worked on the iOS and Android game &quot;Scurvy Scallywags&quot; with &quot;DeathSpank&quot; co-creator Clayton Kauzlaric.

On November 18, 2014, it was revealed that he had reunited with Gary Winnick, with whom he created his early critically acclaimed point-and-click games at LucasArts, and that they were working together on a new point-and-click game called &quot;Thimbleweed Park&quot;. The game reached its funding target on the crowd sourcing site Kickstarter on December 18 and was released on March 30, 2017, in full &quot;talkie&quot; mode for Windows, Linux, Mac and Xbox One. A port to iOS and Android was confirmed after the project met its last stretch-goal.

On May 23, 2016, Gilbert took to Twitter to express a desire to buy back earlier LucasArts franchises saying &quot;Please sell me my &quot;Monkey Island&quot; and &quot;Maniac Mansion&quot; IP. I&#x27;ll pay actual money for them.&quot;. In 2017, fans of the series launched an online petition in support of Ron Gilbert, asking Disney to sell the franchises to him; as of December 2021, the petition has gathered about 29,000 signatures.

On April 4, 2022, Gilbert announced that he had been working on &quot;Return to Monkey Island&quot; for the prior two years in secrecy. The game was released later that year on September 19, by Devolver Digital and his company Terrible Toybox.

On February 2, 2025, posted on his blog that he was planning to release a new game, titled &quot;Death By Scrolling&quot; with a view to release it within 2025. Gilbert had earlier blogged about experimenting with an RPG engine and tileset in 2018.

<text>The Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne (International Exposition of Art and Technology in Modern Life) was held from 25 May to 25 November 1937 in Paris, France. Both the Palais de Chaillot, housing the Musée de l&#x27;Homme, and the Palais de Tokyo, which houses the Musée d&#x27;Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris, were created for this exhibition that was officially sanctioned by the Bureau International des Expositions. A third building, , housing the permanent Museum of Public Works, which was originally to be among the new museums created on the hill of Chaillot on the occasion of the Exhibition, was not built until January 1937 and inaugurated in March 1939.

==Exhibitions==
At first the centerpiece of the exposition was to be a tower (&quot;Phare du Monde&quot;) which was to have a spiraling road to a parking garage located at the top and a hotel and restaurant located above that. The idea was abandoned as it was far too expensive.

== Pavilions ==
===Finnish Pavilion===
The Finnish pavilion was designed by Alvar Aalto, following an open architectural competition held in 1936, where he had won both first and second prize, the winning entry &quot;Le bois est en marche&quot; forming the basis for the pavilion as built. Finland had been given a difficult, sloping wooded site near the Trocadéro, something which Aalto was able to exploit in creating a ground plan featuring an irregular chain of volumes joined in a sort of collage - with small, open, cubic pavilions together with two larger exhibition halls. The entire complex curved around a shady garden with Japanese touches. The pavilion was also an advertisement for Finland&#x27;s prime export, wood, as the building was built entirely of timber. French architecture historian Fabienne Chevallier has argued that at the time French critics were baffled by Aalto&#x27;s building because though it was built of wood – and thus endorsing an image of what they perceived Finland to be – they were unprepared for Aalto&#x27;s avant-gardism.

===Canadian Pavilion===
Canada had initially not planned to take part in the exposition because of reasons of cost. In February 1936, at a party in Ottawa, Raymond Brugère, the French minister-plenipotentiary pressed the prime minister William Lyon Mackenzie King and his Quebec lieutenant Ernest Lapointe, about Canada taking part in the &quot;Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne&quot;, saying he very much wanted Canada to have a pavilion. King hesitated, saying he did not know if his government could afford the cost of building a pavilion, but Brugère forced his hand by sending a telegram to Paris, saying that Canada would take part, leading to an announcement being made in Paris.

Fitting in the architectural master-plan of the master architect Jacques Gréber at the foot of the Eiffel Tower, and inspired by the shape of a grain elevator, the Canadian pavilion included Joseph-Émile Brunet&#x27;s 28-foot sculpture of a buffalo (1937), and Charles Comfort&#x27;s &quot;The Romance of Nickel&quot;. Paintings by Brunet, sculpted panels on the outside of the structure, and several thematic stands inside the Canadian pavilion depicted aspects of Canadian culture.

=== Norwegian Pavilion ===
The Norwegian pavilion was designed by , Arne Korsmo and . It included Hannah Rygen&#x27;s tapestry &quot;Ethiopia&quot;.

===Spanish Pavilion===
The Spanish pavilion was arranged by the President of Spain Spanish Republican government and built by the Spanish architect Josep Lluis Sert. It attracted extra attention because the exposition took place during the Spanish Civil War. The pavilion included Pablo Picasso&#x27;s &quot;Guernica&quot;, the now-famous depiction of the horrors of war, as well as Alexander Calder&#x27;s sculpture &quot;Mercury Fountain&quot; and Joan Miró&#x27;s painting &quot;Catalan peasant in revolt&quot;.

===German Pavilion===
Two of the other notable pavilions were those of Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union. The organization of the world exhibition had placed the German and the Soviet pavilions directly across from each other. Hitler had desired to withdraw from participation, but his architect Albert Speer convinced him to participate, showing Hitler his plans for the German pavilion. Speer later revealed in his autobiographies that having had a clandestine look at the plans for the Soviet pavilion, he designed the German pavilion to represent a bulwark against Communism.

The preparation and construction of the exhibits were plagued by delay. On the opening day of the exhibition, only the German and the Soviet pavilions had been completed. This, as well as the fact that the two pavilions faced each other, turned the exhibition into a competition between the two great ideological rivals.

Speer&#x27;s pavilion was culminated by a tall tower crowned with the symbols of the Nazi state: an eagle and the swastika. The pavilion was conceived as a monument to &quot;German pride and achievement&quot;. It was to broadcast to the world that a new and powerful Germany had a restored sense of national pride. At night, the pavilion was illuminated by floodlights. Josef Thorak&#x27;s sculpture &quot;Comradeship&quot; stood outside the pavilion, depicting two enormous nude males, clasping hands and standing defiantly side by side, in a pose of mutual defense and &quot;racial camaraderie&quot;. Television was shown as a novelty in German pavilion.

===Soviet Pavilion===
The architect of the Soviet pavilion was Boris Iofan. Vera Mukhina designed the large figurative sculpture on the pavilion. The grand building was topped by &quot;Worker and Kolkhoz Woman&quot;, a large momentum-exerting statue, of a male worker and a female peasant, their hands together, thrusting a hammer and a sickle. The statue was meant to symbolize the union of workers and peasants.

===Italian Pavilion===
Italy was vying for attention between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union who presented themselves as great (and opposing) forces to be reckoned with. Italy was the benevolent dictatorship: sunny, open and Mediterranean, it was founded on discipline, order and unity. Marcello Piacentini was given the job of designing the pavilion exterior. He used a modern reinforced concrete frame combined with traditional elements such as colonnades, terraces, courts and galleries, the tower form, Classical rhythms and the use of Mediterranean marble and stucco. The pavilion was nestled under the Eiffel tower looking out over the Seine to the main part of the Exposition site.

Giuseppe Pagano was responsible for the overall co-ordination of the exhibits and was the first impact on entering the building, its large courtyard garden and its hall of honour. The main entry was through the Court of Honour that showcased life size examples of Italy&#x27;s most important contribution to the history of technology. Arturo Martini&#x27;s Victory of the Air presided over the space, her dark bronze form standing out against a seemingly infinite backdrop of blue-grey Venetian mosaic tiles. From there visitors could visit the Colonial Exhibits by Mario Sironi and the Gallery of Tourism before enjoying a plate of real spaghetti on the restaurant terrace. The courtyard garden was designed a respite from the exhibits with a symphony of green grass and green-glazed tiles set against red flowers and burgundy porphyry.

The Hall of Honour was the pavilion&#x27;s most dramatic and evocative space. It also &#x27;repurposed&#x27; an existing artwork: Mario Sironi&#x27;s Corporative Italy (Fascist Work) mosaic from the 1936 Triennale that had now been completed with numerous figures engaged in different types of work and the figure of the imperial Roman eagle flying in from the right hand side. The 8m x 12 m work towered over the two-storey height space that occupied the top of the pavilion&#x27;s tower, making it the centre piece of the pavilion&#x27;s decorative and propaganda program. The enthroned figure of Italy represented corporatism, the economic policy of Italian fascism. The room was a celebration of all those aspects of Fascist society that Pagano wholeheartedly believed in: social harmony, government input to generate industrial innovation and support for artists, professionals and craftsmen as well as workers. Here Pagano had the joy of working alongside five different artists and placing Italy&#x27;s newest industrial material such as linoleum and Termolux (shatterproof plate glass) next to a sumptuous chandelier from Murano and amber marble.

===British Pavilion===
Britain had not been expecting such a competitive exposition, and its planned budget was only a small fraction of Germany&#x27;s. Frank Pick, the chairman of the Council for Art and Industry, appointed Oliver Hill as architect but told him to avoid modernism and to focus on traditional crafts. The main architectural element of Hill&#x27;s pavilion was a large white box, decorated externally with a painted frieze by John Skeaping and internally with giant photographic figures which included Neville Chamberlain fishing. Its contents were crafts objects arranged according to English words which had become loanwords in French, such as &quot;sport&quot; and &quot;weekend&quot;, and included some items by renowned potter William Worrall. There was considerable British criticism that the result was unrepresentative of Britain and compared poorly to the other pavilions&#x27; projections of national strength.

===Pavillon des Temps Nouveaux===
The Pavillon des Temps Nouveaux (Pavilion of New Times) was a tent pavilion designed by Le Corbusier and Pierre Jeanneret. In 1932, Le Corbusier heard the announcement of the proposed Expo and immediately issued an ambitious counter proposal. When funding for his project failed to materialise, he offered several scaled down versions, none of which attracted the necessary funding. Finally Le Corbusier was offered a budget of 500,000 FF with which he built a canvas pavilion filled with didacitic material promoting his utopian vision of future urbanism.

== Gallery ==
== Reproduction of the Soviet Pavilion ==
After the Paris exhibition closed, &quot;Worker and Kolkhoz Woman&quot; was moved to the entrance of the All-Russia Exhibition Centre in Moscow, where it stood on a high platform. The sculpture was removed for restoration in 2003, intended to be completed by 2005. However, due to financial issues the restoration was delayed. On 28 November 2009 the sculpture was completed and returned to its place in front of the VDNKh. On 4 December 2009 the sculpture was revealed on the recreated pavilion structure.

== Reproduction of the Spanish Pavilion ==
